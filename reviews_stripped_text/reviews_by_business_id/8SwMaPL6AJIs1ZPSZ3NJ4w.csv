59927,2013-07-26,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I've been hearing about this place for some time now and was excited to try it. It's crazy that it took us this long to make it here since it is a stone's throw from our house. We went for lunch and it was pretty empty with only one waitress working. She was attentive but as the place started to fill up she got a bit overwhelmed. The bread they bring is phenomenal and when paired with the oil and spices I felt like I didn't need anything else it was so good. I ordered the Chebureki (Georgian style, deep fried beef dumpling) for us to share; the dumplings were very tasty the beef was very flavorful. They reminded me of an empanada in shape and pastry but the taste was very different. For our main courses I ordered the Bulgarian Mixed Grill (3 sausages) and my bf ordered the Goulash. I liked two of the sausages a lot, the third was ok just not for me sadly I don't know which was which. The beans that are served with the dish are very good if not a bid over oiled, i did not care for the red dipping sauce it is served with. My bf's goulash was very tasty though the serving was small and it was a bit on the salty side. We really liked the atmosphere of the place, there is tons to look at, the discotheque music was terrible and if it weren't for that we probably would have stayed longer. All in all we will certainly be back if for nothing else then to try the yummy looking biscuit cake.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,1,0,4,5w089rLexILm-zmJlYS8qA
66678,2016-06-15,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Not sure what their problem is but I wouldn't waste my time here. I am not one of those people who is impossible to please. I don't expect a lot. But I do expect the staff to not look at me like I'm crazy when I walk in the door. I also prefer a server to not huff and walk away when I say I've never been here before. 

I walked into this place and the bartender looked at me like I have 3 heads or something. I just finished work. I'm a real estate agent and just wanted a little happy hour before going home. I can assure you, I don't have 3 heads, and I don't go to bars looking like a crazy person. I'm not sure why they seemed so shocked I went in their establishment. Maybe they don't like single female customers? Maybe they expected me to speak Russian? Who knows. 

The other bartender stuck a menu on my bar table and asked if I had been here before. I said no. She huffed and walked away. What is that?? 

I sat there for a minute, decided I prefer to spend my money and time at an establishment where I at least don't get looked at like I have boogers hanging out my nose or something. And walked out. 

Bartender who gave me crazy eye asked if I didn't like the menu. Actually I was very interested in the menu. I just wasn't interested in the attitude. 

Maybe they are having an off day. 

The only people in the place at 5:30 were an old man who looked like he parks in that same chair all day everyday, and an older woman who strolled out of the bathroom with a sour look on her face, picked up a glass from the old guy's table, and walked outside without a word.

Forte has an awesome euro-vibe: hip and so authentic.  My husband and I go about once per week and we haven't even come close to trying everything on the menu.  Some of our favorites...patatas bravas, tuna-stuffed tomato with hard-boiled egg, sofiiska baniza (feta-stuffed pastry), queso manchego canapes, stuffed peppers, stuffed cabbage...  Actually, I could just go on and on...oh the lattes, too - fabulous!

Elizabeth M. really captured the spirit of Forte in her review so I won't repeat, but I agree with everything she's written.  And after reading Adam's review, I am thrilled that he won't be at Forte when I go tonight!!

242241,2012-07-23,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I learned about this place from Desert Companion (KNPR's magazine). Tried it out with the bf on a Thursday night (around 9pm) and we're still talking about it. 

Ordered:
Gambas al Ajillo (shrimp with garlic, wine, olive oil)
Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta (marinate baby squid in ink over rice)
Beef and Lamb Confit
Vareniki (potato + onion dumplings)
Adjarski Khachapurri (soft bread boat filled with cheese + egg)
Tolumba (fried dough bathed in honey)
Ginger Lemonade (like a gingery mojito with a hint of rosemary)

All the dishes were standard tapas portions (except that bread boat) and completely delicious. I'm lactose intolerant and not a big fan of meat. Despite that, there were still plenty of items for me, plus some mighty tasty drinks. I couldn't eat the Adjarski Khachapurri because of the cheese, but judging from the single crumb left by my bf, it was pretty good.

We sat outside at roomy, slightly wobbly tables. Ice water was brought without us asking, service was consistently good, as are prices. The only downer was the cigarette ash that was left on our table when the hostess took the ashtray away. Nobody came to clean it off so we shifted to the next table.

We'll definitely be back to try everything that we didn't get around to trying the first time.",yj3CFpmMPU3BHApxO8oO-g,0,1,4,fV04toHcXprrugLe8dco6Q

267394,2012-06-02,2,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"The place gets 1 star for several reasons, most of all for trying to serve crap under the guise of freshly prepared tapas. One such example is their so called spanish tuna which they get from the can and afterwards add some sliced tomatoes and serve it to customers. I come from a cultural background where many of those eastern European dishes are common in our household so I know what those things ought to taste like, I cant say they were terrible but it was definitely not worth the price. Also having gone to Barcelona myself their so called jamon iberico was just another sliced up pork and nothing like the iberico from Spain. The squid stuffed with its ink came semi warm and had a nasty fish taste to it rather than what they make you believe. a combination of bad food, bad service, trying to make you believe that their food is something it's not (dishonesty) gets this place the 1 star review. It's no wonder that we were the one of two tables occupied in the whole place. Stick with firefly and your will be a lot more happier.",R6wTTuYrWBclf1oBaw7LXw,6,1,1,o3JItVM0ztsp9R371Vc9tw

I have been a server and can overlook a lot of things, but this was unacceptable. I finally left and as I walked past the host/server at the front, she said nothing.  I'm sad because the online menu looked excellent, but I am so peeved at the service that I don't think I will ever return.

We had an excellent lunch and we left an 18 percent tip. When we received the charge on our credit card, 52 cents was added to the tip. I generally tip up to the dollar, so it was not an addition mistake. I called the restaurant twice and asked for the manager to return my call. None was forthcoming. The restaurant experience goes beyond the food, and if a restaurant can condone adding money on to a tip and the management can't give a customer a return call, it doesn't deserve my business.",t6NK-E6pFyzXzL0MVHlpxQ,1,0,1,UbD0JgN-aKJzc5jjhZILsQ

Horrible service!!!!
We were sat down and waited for a very long time till we even got asked for drinks. I ordered something and was brought another thing. That can happen, but when we asked about the difference between the Serbian and the Bulgarian Grill (just because it was our first time there and we are not familiar with serbian or bulgarian food and the description on the menu was a different language)  the answer was ""it's just different sausages"" and then she rolled her eyes. This is what made me write the review. That was so rude!

Stuffed Grape Leaves
Chicken Shich Kabob
and for dessert...
Tiramisu with Baileys coffee easy whip ;)

I thought the Mixed Tapas plate was mediocre and not as exciting as the establishment's environment.  The tasty kabobs, flavorful grape leaves and striking sangria definitely made up for it.

406303,2012-06-23,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"On the whole, this restaurant does give a new patron a great slice of  European cuisine and it is worth noting that if you've never been here before that you should try it out because most of the food as it is now is delicious, but having been here in the past and knowing what these foods really were has really soured my experience.

It's been a long time since I had been back to this place since its first inception. Back then this place was one of the only occupied storefronts in a dead strip mall. This place had a menu that was meat and cheese heavy and showcased a wide assortment of Eastern Bloc varieties.

The appeal of this place in addition to the great food was the tell tale sign of a great hole in the wall joint: Authentic European food, sketchy European groups of men and women engaging in non-English conversation and a woman running the show who knew what was good and made sure you ate it.

The most notable things were:

Shopska salad
-It has the creamiest Bulgarian feta cheese. Don't mistake this feta for Greek feta. This is incredible.

Cevape
-Homemade fat finger sized sausages served with lepina, a type of yeasty flatbread.

Artisian Charcuterie Plate/Cheese Plate
-These 2 are definite musts for light eating and drinks

Leskovacka pljeskavica
-similar to the cevape in flavor but served like an over sized burger

There were also a few kabob-like meats and a few other sausages similar to the cevape that were so delicious.

So why the poor rating? Mostly due to the fact that what I described is what I was hoping to find on this most recent visit today.

Our waiter informed us that he was brand new and didn't know much of the menu or the wine selection. He also pointed out on each trip back to our table that nobody was assisting him as he was learning. I'll point out here that for whatever reason he was not our waiter by the end of our meal.

We got the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, Thracian Clay Pot, Chicken Soup, Chebureki, Bacon wrapped dates and the Beef and Lamb Confit. We were really interested in the Thracian Clay Pot as it was recently featured on a Food Network show.

The Stroganoff was ladled over wild mushroom plemeni, a kind of Russian tortellini. This stroganoff had a lot of creamy goodness but was completely lacking the meat.

I'll get to the Thracian Clay Pot shortly. The Chicken Soup was desired by my kids ages 8 and 6, as well as the bacon wrapped dates. The chicken soup was quite chunky with big chicken flavor. The first round of dates looked like they spent about 1 minute too long in the pan where one side was cooked good the other burnt. We were informed that the cook likes to cook it that way to which our reply was, ""Please give us unburned bacon wrapped dates."" They were very good about getting this order back after the rest of our items had come out.

The Chebureki was akin to a samosa where it is a flattened dough item filled with something and deep fried in this case, a delicious meat filling and topped with some dill and chopped scallions. Fairly standard in flavor and not served with any type of dipping sauce.

The Beef and Lamb Confit was tender and tasty served atop a small scoop of a dill and scallion rice. While this was tasty it was not a distinct one. My son said, ""Is this corned beef?"" And you know what? He was right. It did taste a lot like the type of corned beef I'd find in a chunky hash at Hash House a go-go. But that's for another review.

So now back to the Thracian Clay Pot. It would seem that during the shuffling of waiters for our table, either our waiter put in this order incorrectly or it was given to another table because we didn't get it during the course of them bringing the rest of our order. When we questioned why the long wait, we were told that it takes a while. We didn't get it after an hour after initially ordering and 30 minutes after reordering it. So I can't tell you how melty and delicious it looked and how it would taste, but the table next to us seemed to really enjoy it.

I'm not a vodka drinker so please read the other ratings for their extensive vodka menu.

This still doesn't really warrant the low rating based on the food. Where it really lacked was the overall experience now versus where it was. This place used to have people who knew the food, wasn't afraid to give locals some food they couldn't pronounce and keep true to themselves. Now, there are waitstaff that don't know the product and don't make you feel excited about their food.

If your looking for something new in Vegas and haven't been, your experience will most likely be 4-5 stars. It is not something that you will find anywhere else and that makes it unique. You will not have the displeasure of seeing a restaurant jump the shark.",4LPc0QJE3cJpy1wy6e4Rig,3,3,2,OPXkk7QUaHsdbq1WX13kzg

The have a board where they write the ""beer"" of the day and it was advertised Kanika for 4 Dollars, we order several of the ""4"" dollar beers pointing to the board when talking to the waiter. when they brought the check the beers were marked at 6 dollars on the check. We asked the waiter and she said that kanika had 4 different beers and she brought us the one marked as 6 dollars, so she was charging us 6 instead of 4.

even is 1 dollar or 2 dollars more than advertised.. is still fraud.. if they do this with beer I can not even start to imagine what they do when they cook

I had a delicious cocktail that came in a copper mug - can't remember the name of it - it had ginger infused vodka, lime and ..? We'll worth the eight dollars.  Home made bread was excellent - the olive oil was top quality - reminded me of the olive oil that you get in Greece.  The feta cheese pastry was like a dessert.  The meat dumplings were good they were very meaty -almost games which I wasn't I the mood for at the time but they were delicious regardless.

It came with a white bean salad and a tomato sauce dip.I  rate that dish 10 for 10..

749293,2011-07-02,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I've been to Forte three times now and have not had a bad experience.  Here's the deal though, going to Forte is a different cultural experience and is not going to be comfortable for people who are expecting an Americanized Eastern European restaurant.

What I like about this place is the great, very European vibe it has - pulled together, comfortable, eclectic, loungy.  This place is very versatile with an ample porch, a great bar (I will say the bar stools are not great.) and a dining room with a variety of tables.  The walls are covered with a variety of odd and, lets say, eclectic art that would make any hipster coffee shop proud.

I find the staff pleasant and helpful and always willing to give you a recommendation from a menu that is unfamiliar to most.

The food is very comfortable and, to my taste, good.  Things Americans will perhaps know include Beef Stroganoff, Kebabs, and Hungarian Goulash.  Things less familiar will be Plov, a dish of rice cooked with meat and carrots, and Katchapourri, a bread bowl with cheese and an egg.  

The thing that gives this place the 4 stars, along with the atmosphere, is the bar.  On tap, they have Pilsner Urquell, Stella Artois, Sam Adams Seasonal, and Blue Moon for beers and a variety of Russian and others in bottle.  The bar is extensive and all is quality - I don't think I've seen a mid-range bar without plastic-bottled well liquors or even lower-end standards, such as Jim Beam and Wild Turkey.  Also, at Forte, they macerate a variety of fruits in vodka and brandy, and they are great!  I particularly like the Sour Cherry Vodka and the Gypsy Concentrate.

One final note is the pricing, which is great!  My last bill included two appetizers and two entrees, a draft, two double Knob Creeks, and four Sour Cherry Vodkas (full rocks glasses with ice) for a total with tip of $55.  As much as I love Herbs and Rye and Nora's, the same bill would have been doubled.

So, if you're interested in a really good, pretty authentic Eastern European bar/lounge/coffee shop/dining experience, go to Forte.",Og5Uu8lxOTnTT6dQmxFmzg,7,0,4,vd2TmsGy6l9gdHKrIfwIyg

We went on a Saturday and even though the sign said it was open, the restaurant did not open until noon.  Ran errands and returned to some very spotty service.  We had to ask for water refills and the deal breaker is having not bringing both dishes out at the same time.  We'd never been to this place and it would have been nice if the server would have explained what some of the dishes were before just leaving it up to their menu descriptions but she was in somewhat of a hurry since it appeared she was the only server.

Went on a Tuesday night and the place had a decent crowd.  Quirky looking place and kinda strange lay-out of the tables but ok by us.  Servers were pleasant and attentive.  The gf was really focused on one of the servers hair style, "" Should I get my hair like that?""  - must have asked me 4 times, hey !  I'm here to eat, not look at hair !

We avoided liquor since it was a weekday.  They provided a mini-loave of bread with olive oil and they recommended you add a special Bulgarian seasoning mix to the oil - the gf loved it - I also liked it though I felt she added to much of the herb mixture to the oil.

We ordered:

Beef Stroganoff Ragu ( $8 ) - Holy cow, the ragu was perfect !  the pasta shells were like little cups to hold the ragu - also very good but we wish they gave us more !

Chebureki ( $3.50 ) -two beef filled fried dumplings - basically a turnover.  perfectly fried, nice flaky crust, a little light on filling but what do you want for $3.50 ??

Bulgarian Mixed grill ( $10 ) - pork grilled three ways - two are sausage, one a patty.  Different seasoning and texture on all three .  came with a side of white beans and a salad similar to cole slaw but better - overall, an excellent plate of food !

Stuffed grape leaves( $5) - each one had a sausage in it.  I enjoyed but the gf prefers the middle eastern version that includes rice.

I wanted to avoid the sweets but I was being hounded so we ordered the rice pudding( I believe $4 ) and the biscuit cake ( $5).  The biscuit cake was very good - reminded us of tiramisu but the liquor flavor is lighter.  I'm not a rice pudding fan but I liked the generous amount of cinnamon on top of the pudding that gave it a nice kick.

So the server asked if he wanna try Bulgarian red sauce without informing that she would charge $1 for a tiny sauce.

Since this was my only experience here, I will give them a little bit of slack. The food we had was all solid. I cannot say the same about the drink menu. With there being a large jump in price from the house wine to the next selection, I opted for the house red. It tasted like Kool-Aid. I would have tried a second glass, but the aforementioned service prevented that from going down. The specialty drinks on the menu all looked like they would rot your teeth. Unfortunately, throwing sugary ingredients into a cocktail glass is a common trend these days, and Forte is no different. The atmosphere is charming and cozy.

Luckily, everything worked out perfectly as they seated us at their large family table with benches. I think there was only one other table of customers so we basically had the restaurant to ourselves! Sunday nights must not be a big night for them but we didn't mind.

Regardless, this place is really funky inside. The artwork on the walls, the music, and the vibe offers a fun and offbeat experience. They have a fairly extensive selection of beers, wine, and cocktails. I had the Angry Ginger cocktail which was basically ginger infused vodka in lemonade with muddled mint. It was like a mojito lemonade, but with a ginger kick. Delicious!

We shared two orders of the Georgian bread for the table. This is their famous boat bread with the egg and the cheese in the middle. It was a huge hit! It takes a little longer because it's baked fresh right then and there but once it hit the table, everyone dove in. 

The menu is kind of funky so with a party of ten, we just jumped in and ordered a ton of items. We ordered a few Spanish tapas for the table, then a few entrees to share. Some people ordered soups and salads, etc. Overall, I think we did it the perfect way. There wasn't a morsel of food left over and everyone left satisfied. Not one person was unhappy with the food. It was truly delicious and fresh. They are really doing it right in that kitchen!

I had to order the clay plot specialty after having read all about it on yelp and seeing it on Triple D. Once it arrived, I was surprised - it was really not anything special. I thought it was going to blow me away but almost every other entree was much more of a delight. I would skip it next time.

Some items come as tapas and others are large enough to be considered a meal. I usually get several items. I enjoy the restaurant décor, food, service, and entertainment. At night they have a piano player. The restaurant is colorful and comfortable.

My favorite soup is the Borscht (beet soup) and my favorite seasonal salad is the Forte Fetamelon Salad. The soup is served hot and has beets, cabbage, potatoes, and a dollop of sour cream. It is absolutely great! The Fetamelon Salad has freshly cut watermelon, red onion, mint leaves, and Bulgarian feta. I actually look forward to summer to enjoy this salad.

The Bulgarian Easter Lamb is amazing. The lamb is tender and the portion is satisfying. It is served with a small salad and mashed potatoes. I usually get this with the Thracian Clay Pot, which is a small hot pot that is backed with egg, tomatoes, peppers, sausage, and feta. It sounds strange, but it is definitely a must try. This item often takes 20 minutes to bake.
 
My favorite mixed grill is the Bulgarian one. It has a great selection of Bulgarian meats and I love the various bean, relish & slaws as they go great with the meat. Just don't think you can order extra of the slaws - They are served only with the mixed grill and you cannot obtain a side order. 

The ice-tea is freshly brewed. The water is served out of old Vodka bottles. They have great tableside herbs that I used to love putting on the bread they serve prior to your meal. I am not a fan of the recent change in the bread they are using. It is not as good as what they used to have a year ago. Maybe they can change it back!?

I won't try to describe it here. The dishes were all handmade pottery direct from Bulgaria! Amazing designs! Perhaps most importantly, our server, Nataliya, was delightful as she described the available dishes and drinks. 

We started with Bulgarian liquor called Rakija. This clear drink certainly had a kick and was a great apéritif! We then moved on to the main courses. The prices were quite reasonable. For example, my Bulgarian mixed grill with three kinds of sausages was $11. In fact, we ordered three main courses so we could try the Thracian Clay Pot which we found intriguing. It's some tasty comfort food with a strong flavor profile and one hell-hot pepper hiding in the pot. Be careful!

Make sure you ask for their homemade bread. With olive oil and an incredible spice mix already on the table to mix in the oil and then use to dip the bread, it's a taste sensation.

I can't finish this review without mentioning the soundtrack playing over the speakers. It was an awesome deep house mix. When we unsuccessfully tried to identify it with Shazam, Nataliya informed us they are mixes from DJ Mascota from Sofia, Bulgaria! Bulgarian electronic dance music with Bulgarian liquor and food! We've since found DJ Mascota's music on SoundCloud and it does not disappoint! I think we'll have to head to Sofia to check out the music scene!",Zn8tgekH0oCfyk4SUtygoA,5,2,5,svsBYeLRChFyxOzhfX92RQ

I ordered the Chebureki, pelimen and something I'll never be able to spell correctly but was essentially a cross between a pide and egg in a boat. They were so good. I joined the empty plate club no problem.

Located in a strip mall, Forte Tapas R & B has an unassuming exterior but boasts a mixture of Spanish/Eastern European kitsch that's not offensive to the eyes.  It offers indoor and outdoor seating but during our visit we opted for indoor to take in the ambiance of the decor.  (We would've sat outside  but during our visit, there was a food truck gathering that was blaring out really bad hip hop music.  That and the temperature was a million degrees that August 25th evening!)

We were seated promptly and our waitress take our drink order.  My girlfriend and I shared the Bulgarian beer called ""Zagorka"", which was  light and clean tasting with no lingering aftertaste.

We order the standard Almond Stuffed Dates, which was tasty.  Unless you are incompetent, you really can't screw up this easy dish!  My girlfriend orders the Lentil Soup, which she found to be very flavorful and earthy as lentils are by nature.  She also orders the Beef Stroganoff Ragu to round out her meal, which was very light and not overly cloying and rich as cream based meals tend to be.  

I ordered the Stuffed Baby Squid in Ink over Spanish Herbed Rice (Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta) for myself.  After watching ""Bizzare Foods"" I was always on the hunt for a restaurant that served mollusks marinated in its own ink.  All I can say is, ""Wow!""  Do yourselves a favor, gentle readers and try this dish!  You may thank me later!  I also order the Chorizo simmered in Red Wine (Chorizo con Vino), which was good but left a somewhat oily aftertaste.  

Service was very attentive and knowledgeable when asked about the menu and establishment.  Our water glasses were never empty and the wait staff were quick and prompt and also took the time to chat with us, asking us how we liked the food.

I highly recommend this restaurant, especially when our bill came out to less than $55, minus the tip.  This place is a great alternative to FireFly if one finds that venue to be too crowded and loud.",IQ-Mt-LI6SsVzgqSl4IwNQ,3,2,4,DOP44dcat1748pjXNfPbqg

Since my last visit, menu has changed and service is more cohesive with both more employees and a hot black-and-white striped dress as a uniform. I dig it!

THRACIAN CLAY POT: A must-order, featured on the Triple D special. Similar to an Israeli shakshuka dish, the flavors of tomato, egg, and peppers mix well. ""Unlike anything I've ever had before,"" according to a well-traveled friend of ours.

STROGANOFF FRIES: The stroganoff ragu they do so well here is now used in a European version of chili fries, and to great success. These are addictive!

SOLYANKA: traditional Russian soup with lemon and smoked meats, super tasty. Best version of this soup that I've had anywhere, and that's saying something.

SOFIISKA BANIZA: Rolls of filo dough stuffed with feta cheese and served with sour cream, even more delicious than burekas, it's a calorie bomb but so damn worth it.

The decor is shabby-chic with a mish-mash of furniture, wall hangings, flooring and just plain random stuff everywhere. It works.

The food: ahhhh, the food. I had ""Bulgarian Easter Lamb"" (pic). Braised lamb chunks pressed into a tuna-can shaped mold. Accompanied by arugula mashed potatoes, a yummy and very creative spring salad and some rich reduction au jus.

I also had hot borscht (beef based with spud cubes, carrots and of course cabbage ... very savory). Now keep in mind this is not the Russian/Jewish style borscht with sugar, raisins and that distinctive sour salt tang. But oh so hearty and quite grounding.

My consort dined on Shopska (pic), a chopped salad with rustic-cut Persian cukes, tomatoes, green onions and canned Ortega chillis ... all tossed in a subtle herb vinaigrette. She also had a thick and tasty lentil soup, and a rich filo dough roll the size of a danish filled with Russian feta cheese.

The last pic is my Russian vodke  It comes in a mini Russian oil can. Quite smooth. It's called ""Neft"", which means motor oil

1693187,2013-01-08,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Just went here for lunch.  SLLOOOW but friendly service, my feeling is they keep a very bare bones staff, at least for lunch that is. Nina herself seated us, ask if we wanted water but never got it.  While does the restaurant just opened at noon, I noticed that not one of the 8 people seated when we got there  had any food or drinks and it was 12:30 pm when we arrived.   It basically took about 10 minutes for the waiter to ask us if we wanted anything to drink, and another 10 to bring us the drinks.  We realized that since we were hungry we better order our food with our drinks. 

We ordered:
Sofiiska baniza- My husband order this, which is filo with cheese...looks lovely, but it didn't look like light layery filo though, more like a bit too doughy.  My husband said it was dense and just ""fine"". (I don't eat starches.) 

Octopus over rice from the tapas menu.  The octopus was fishy for me, but the rice was nicely cooked, according to my husband. 

Mixed grill- It was very good, one of the sausage links was cooked way more than I like, almost dry, but maybe that is the way it is suppose to be.  Still tasty. The patty seasoning was assertive, but not overpowering.  I liked the red pepper condiment and the onions marinated with mint that come with the mixed grill, it also comes with beans which we didn't eat, but looked appealing.   It really is a good portion size, especially for the price.

Thoracian Clay pot- By this time, we were pretty full, but we loved this and ate it all, but  it reminded me of a great breakfast dish that could easily be made at home, because the little clay pot had sauteed tomato, onions, bell peppers, feta, a few slices of charcuterie, and what probably should be a baked egg with an oozy yolk, but our yolk was cooked through. Still it was delicious. However, that little tasty claypot maybe way too small of a portion to satisfy a very hungry person if this is all one orders.  

You can tell almost everyone in the restaurant that this was their first time.  I guess inspired by DDD.  Yes, sadly and quite embarrassingly, I saw it too and wanted to go.  While I am not above them, I think the ""foodie"" want-a-bes were pretty annoying...one actually playing the DDD episode on his phone, and two old but very plump ladies asking annoying (stupid) questions to the waiter about the owner and trying to get EXACTLY same menu as on that episode of DDD...as if it was a tasting menu.  

Cool environment though, better if I just want to hang out, relax and have a few drinks at a VEEERRY leisurely pace.  I am glad I gave it a try, but probably won't go back, definitely not for lunch.  

My advice: definitely try this place out, but don't go here for a ""quick"" lunch on your lunch hour.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,1,0,3,V3_r0MTjUf9XfI1Wuu3yIw

If you're tired of the usual hotel eateries and yes there are hundreds of absolutely amazing places in LV, try Forte. I found this place, er should I say my husband found it watching diners drive in's and dives (a show I can't watch but he LOVES) - Paul and I have been to a few of the show's recommendations in L.A. and they weren't bad so I was not adverse to the suggestion of having lunch away from the usual confines of the strip hotels, plus I was excited to bring my girlfriend Zana, who recently moved to town, to a place that served some menu items from her homeland of Serbia. 

We arrive at the restaurant in a fairly large but unassuming strip mall, and walk into the just the cutest place ever. Art on the walls, deep rich colors and a huge beautiful bar and a small cozy dining room. For lunchtime on a holiday week it was crowded enough so that my party of 6 had to wait a few minutes for a table large enough to seat us opened up. The owner was so sweet and nice offering my pre-teen nieces flavored sodas from Spain while we waited and sipped our wine.

Serbian Hamburger....don't knock the name. It was the best thing I had there among amazing stuffed grape leaves, grilled meats, rich chickpea soup and the lamb and beef confit over rice was almost like a jumbalaya. Other good picks are the pan con tomate and this dish that comes in a super hot individual pot that has beef/sausage, tomatos, onions, spices, an amazing broth, cheese and an egg for good measure. It's apparently an very old dish dating back to ancient Greece.

I am soooo going back for dinner next time and will take a taxi and leave the kids so we can take our time and enjoy the wine.",DG9O0LEaRbf8fJmMXxOLEg,2,1,5,R3hCI-s38hM5jGNUAvWM8Q

When I first moved here, I flagged Forte on my list of places I'd like to try because it was featured in an article featuring great lunches under $10. 

Flash forward five years later...

Yes, five years.

Yes, I know that's a long time. 

Yes, I'm kicking myself. 

To my credit, I went back a week later. Twice in two weeks. So there. 

Anyway, despite being it the same plaza as La Bonita Market, it's situated far enough away to allow for easy parking. 

Reservations can be made. I'm not sure if they're needed since both of my visits to date were rather early in the evening. In any case, should you arrive and find yourself waiting for a table, the waiting area rolls into a market and small bar. 

Seating is comfortable. There are mostly 4-tops in the uniquely decorated dining room. To no one's surprise, the walls are covered with Spanish and Eastern European decor. 

The menu provides a wide range of selections; I can't imagine there wouldn't be something for everyone here. All of the items were well prepared and, while I enjoyed some items more than others, there wasn't anything I truly disliked. 

Notable items: 

- Ajarski Khachapuri. Two kinds of cheese oven-baked into a crusty loaf with an egg stirred in upon its arrival to one's table. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, unless you have celiac disease, are lactose-intolerant (or both), or hate the little things in life that make people happy. It's worth a trip here for this alone, paired with beers or a few ice-cold adult beverages.  

- Octopus in olive oil. Can't go wrong when all of the components are of good quality.

- Stroganoff fries. This is more of a notable item because of its novelty. If it hurts your heart too much, you can order fries and stroganoff as separate dishes. But, come on, live a little, friends. 

- Biscuit cake. Do I really need to attempt a compelling argument for dessert?

- KBG martini. Pickled martini. With the Khachapuri. Just yes. 

There is happy hour 5pm - 7pm, Paella on Saturdays, and a brunch menu I assume on weekends.

 The ""Garden Vodka"" when used as a substitute for every ingredient in your Dirty Martini excluding dry vermouth, creates an Exceptionally tasty yet one of a kind Cocktail. And I'm not afraid to admit that I am definitely a cocktail snob ;D

There is raspberry infused vodka, potato infused vodka, various Grappas... The list goes on- you need to check this place out if only to discover the rest. In addition they have Banana Sambuca, and while it isn't infused in house it's definitely going to be a pleaser for adventurous types. The bar is very well stocked from recongnizable alchohol to imported beers and wine, and especially imported vodkas; So don't be afraid to get obscure, like small village in the Ukraine obscure.

Service- One thing I couldn't understand are the bad reviews preceding mine! You cannot come here expecting your service to be like The Olive Garden or some other heinous food chain. Forte is definitely an intimate atmosphere if you go early or on a weeknight. Thursday night is quietest. Because like most Eastern European bars/ casual restaurants they like to get a little rowdy with music! It's apart of the culture. They are having Jazz on Mondays though FYI. Service is personable and casual, and perfect for what it is.

The food is incredibly fresh and delicious. The egg boat had a name I won't even try to pronounce (see pictures), and is a dish I've never come across before. So happy I did! My favorites were the almond stuffed dates (Rich and Delightful) and the Feta Burek with its flaky delicate crust and creamy center- Mmmm. For dessert we had the biscuit cake which reminded us of Tiramisu at first glance, but had this incredibly soft texture and taste that did not resemble Tiramisu, and it was a sumptuous finish to a quite filling dinner.

From the outside, the place was nothing special. If there weren't some tables or chairs on the sidewalk in front of it, I don't think we would have found the right place or door to enter. From outside it looks like a smoke shop or a convenience store. There are posters and all kinds of stuff on the windows, not something you would expect at a classier place or restaurant. Inside we were pleasantly surprised however. Place was nice and cozy and nice music. It was overall a nice atmosphere...more lounge like than restaurant like. I think they'll get a lot more business if the make the outside look presentable too. If I was just driving by and wanted to eat, I would have never stopped there bc from outside it looks like a 1 star place. Anyway, we sat to eat. We had a toddler with us but they have no high-chairs for kids. Please get some. There were others with little kids and babies and NO baby seats so parent had to hold all the kids. Good thing ours was old enough to sit in chair without falling. 

Service was great and fast. Waiters were nice and professional. Place was very clean. Our orders were taken quickly and the food started coming out fast. One thing we did not like was that some of us got our meals before we even got our drinks or salads or appetizers. Who does that? Waitress told us that she has to bring us the food as the chef makea it, but c'mon. But why would the chef make our main course before our salad and appetizers. I was already full before my appetizer, soup and salad came out. My family waited to get soup and salad before touching their meals, but by that time their main course meal was already cold. Food was ok. Nothing to write home about. It wasn't bad by any means but the fries were overcooked and hard and crispy and all the meats were very very dry. No juice on the meat at all. My wife and mother had the chicken soup. I didn't try but they said it was so bland that they each started adding whatever salt and spices we had on the table to give it flavor. My toddler loves soup but she didn't even want that one. It wasn't bad people, just  could be better...juicier, more flavor and served IN ORDER....... Drinks, appetizers, soup/salad, main course, dessert, etc. Overall we had a good experience. Place and staff are good. I would go again eventually.

Kind of funky interior, and definitely has a European feel to it

I spent some time with the menu and was a bit overwhelmed by all the dishes available

Finally ordered a few things, and while sitting at the bar ( keep in mind this is a non-gaming establishment )    I notice someone to my far left smoking and then after speaking with the waitress / bartender another guest starts smoking 2 seats down from me on the left.     I overhear the waitress / bartender say something to the effect of ""Smoking is ok at the bar""

No actually its not OK,   you can't just make up you're own smoking policy.    Its disgusting and I refuse to eat anywhere that smoking is permitted - legally or otherwise

Today I had a light meal including their famous gypsy milk cocktail which is ultimately refreshing especially for this Las Vegas heat made with a huckleberry vodka and a secret gypsy juice 

My meal today was a Thracian clay pot that was famously featured in one of my favorite shows drivers dine in dives. It is definitely something to look into. 

The staff here are super friendly especially Jose. He was super outgoing and gave me all my great recommendations this being my first time. I have worked all around in the restaurant business and I am very happy to say that after much exploring in this new city Forte is one of my favorite spots already.

My wife and I had a great experience and the food was fantastic.  My grandparents are Polish and Ukrainian, so I grew up eating some similar foods.  Similar but not the same.  The dishes have a different spice profile and are more delicate.  The food we had was delicious.  The borscht beat my grandmothers.  The pelmeni are tender and so tasty.  We had both the stroganoff and the plain with sour cream and dill.  We had the Thracian clay pot ... yummy.  We also had the Khachapurri which is a bread with a cheese and egg filling.  Also delicious.  They have a nice selection of vodkas, wines and beers too.  Our service was outstanding.  I think she was the owner, but she was friendly knowledgeable and very engaging.  

I highly recommend checking this place out in Las Vegas.  It was better than any meal we have had in the Bellagio I can tell you that.  The final bill of $45 including drinks beats most of prices on the strip as well.",T885UlrHDf5IDEeutDQZUA,3,0,5,_2H3mTLsjvS1RhFPmC7m1A

2220900,2015-01-06,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"It been while since wrote a five star review. Forte is a place that exceeded my expectations not only the food but overall experience was very unique. Lot of things that stood out for me. The fact that small family run business, off the strip not in mega hotel, very reasonable price, interior design screaming personality, and am NOT fan of Tapas style of eating but Forte made me FAN. I came to Forte with my cousins from the 808 visiting also avid yelpers and enjoy food like myself. The few times get together over the years here or back home about trying something new. I was excited too get bookmark off my list and just enjoy time around Ohana.

I knew the interior design has personality from watching the episode on DDD. What you see on television can never prepare you for the real thing. I loved every bit of it! Really small restaurant maybe holds 50 people, the bar area is also small just one row of bar stools, and the dining room is divided into two sections. Each one having its own personality. Lot of bright colors, all kinds of different tables, booths, and even the chairs few different ones so really nothing uniform or the same look around from any angle. The artwork (assume someone did) lot of Day of the Dead influence not that came as surprising since european melting pot of food. One artwork that thankfully my cousins pointed out they did Guy Fieri head with the show logo and his signature on the wall. Hell of cool! It literally feels like walking into another world once open the front door.

The food thankfully hanging out with the right peeps or Ohana this night. I got too try lot of the menu. We ordered decent amount of food for three of us. Six items in all. To go back to my earlier point reasonable price our bill was $60 before tip and we were stuffed. Two of us had drink so the bill would have been cheaper if not in the drinking mood. The HH price for drinks on all of them. Steal of deal. I stuck with beer but my cousin had one of the vodka drinks. I pass on trying but she told me was very tasty. 

Home-made chicken soup was pleasantly surprised! We all thought ok on cold night get some soup. It might be bland your basic soup. Instead this little bowl packed bowl full of goodness. The broth was really tasty had depth, ample amount of shredded chicken in it, nice portion of vegetables, and really tasted like fresh Home-made soup. On chilly day could get super size bowl be soup Happy!

Stuffed Grape Leaves was really good. I really enjoyed the filling. The ground pork or assume pork had great seasoning and flavor. The sauce brought everything together along with the grape leaves. 

Beef Stroganoff Ragu was another winnah. Again one of those dishes just give me super size plate be happy with one dish. The pasta dumplings was on point between the filling and the rich, thick, creamy, hearty stroganoff meat sauce. It heavy pasta dish but so good.

Spanish Rice (not sure forgot called) but talk about bowl of rice. It look more like paella without all the seafood or the saffron. It was popping with flavor. Not protein in it. Talk about flavors. It was really good rice.

The star of the show the one dish excited about Bulgarian Mixed Grill. Two dishes that was featured on the show. This was the one most looking forward too and past on the clay pot dish. Awesome. Not only the three different meats. I enjoy the three different sides. The beans and the red pepper something perfect compliment. If one dish NEED too order if first time, many times, or only time this is the one. 

The only dish that not fan of was the Octopus in Olive Oil. Yay it has really nice depth of Olive Oil had the Octopus. Saying sometimes can have too much of good thing. Olive Oil was the killer for me. The rice that served with was bland not very good dish overall.

Outside of the one dish everything was awesome. All the food felt like had great depth of flavor. LOVE LOVE the atmosphere very much different then most restaurants in Vegas. Great spot to hang out with family or friends over drinks, some food, and weekend they even have live music. The service was fabulous.

2232704,2011-10-26,3,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Another tip from the safety girl.  You need to walk through the patio to get into this place.  The patio is too crowded with tables and umbrellas and you will need to step over the base of a very large umbrella to get across the patio and into the restaurant.  Be careful not to trip!

Ok, now that we have our safety tip out of the way, onto the restaurant.  There's a small bar towards the back with old school video poker machines along the wall.  Not at the bar.  It's more like the video poker set up you would see in a grocery store.  Lots of smokers in this area.  Interesting music videos on the TV screens.  Don't expect sports here.

We came on a Friday night and there was one waitress so service was pretty slow.

We tried the mixed tapas plate, which was just olives, garlic cloves, cheese, salumi, and bread.  Nothing exciting.

The Thracian with Lukanka was to die for.  Sausage, feta cheese, vegetables all cooked in a clay pot.  We had to ask for more bread to go with it and it took a while, but once we could dig in it was pretty good!

The blini with meat was also pretty good.  It's a thin crepe with ground beef served with sour cream.  Simple but good.  

The portion sizes are big enough to share but small enough so you can try multiple dishes.  

I liked most of the dishes but it took forever to eat here and I'm not grasping the ambience.  Maybe I am not European enough but, then again, I'm pretty sure grocery store video poker machines are not European.

We almost always order too much and leave here stuffed. Some of our favorites are the stuffed sweet peppers, the bacon wrapped dates, sofiska baniza, the goulash, and the shopska salad. My husband loves the lamb lollipops, and on this recent visit, I tried a new salad on the menu, with Persian cucumber and sliced radish--so flavorful!

I've always had stellar service here, last night the server accidentally put in an order of the sweet peppers instead of the stuffed grape leaves, but they gave us the peppers too, on the house. 

I love the pottery and eclectic art, it's always very lively feeling. 

The only reason i wouldn't give it 5 stars is the awkward seating. They swapped out several tables for high tops, and being short and stout, it's awkward for me to hip up there on my stubby little legs. The low tops are two round tables put together, which looks cute but can be problematic when you order several dishes. The last time we sat on the low top benches, they sunk down quite a bit, but those may have have been replaced when they redid the seating arrangement.

Local or visiting from out of town, Forte provides a unique dining experience, with delicious food and friendly, helpful service.  Be sure to check out their cocktail menu too - I love their sangria. Happy hour pricing looks great!",45mRoEbA_IvHIyUHpiABBw,27,29,4,coyWeFXWeC3GHg4O1rfUOQ

The restaurant itself is very cute. I loved the decorations, the booths were comfortable, and even the plates were cute. They started us with bread, Spanish olive oil, and that paprika mix. Already happy there. We ended up getting a few items: almond stuffed dates, stroganoff fries,  lamb chop lollipops, stuffed grape leaves, and pelmeni. Each item was better than the last. Honestly, their stuffed grape leaves were the best I can remember having. Warning that the lamb is only two pieces. Delicious, but small portion on that one. Everything else was portioned better. The pelmeni was kinda like a potsticker, in case you were questioning it.
At the end of the night, we got the biscuit cake. I will have dreams about this cake, I swear. It's like if tiramisu didn't suck, met up with some halva, and had a beautiful child. Our waitress saw that my family ate most of it while I was away from the table, so ended up bringing me an extra slice. I just about died.

We ordered damn near everything on the menu and did not have anything we did not like.  The mix of the spanish and eastern european actually works pretty well, and all the dishes we had were pretty well executed.  

From the outside, the place really is just a tiny little dive bar looking place, with some ""drink, eat, play"" style casino/bar type message on the outside.  Inside, it is a little bar, with a dining area next to it.  Incidentally, our friends found out they did not have any high chairs, which was a little odd, but we did just fine.  

They gave us some bread which was good and soft, and we ordered about 9-10 dishes, which were varying levels of good to great and also of value.  The tomato bread was tasty, as it came on a very soft baguette, and was decent at about $4.50.  The garlic shrimp were fine, but at $7 for 5 pretty small little shrimp, it was a bit pricey.  We also had the clay pot, which was good, but nothing that blew me away.  Also very good was the mixed grill, which we got 2 of, and came with a tasty bean salad and 3 pieces of grilled sausages.   I found them to be delicious, although they were very salty, so someone who does not care for that would not like them as much.  We had several other dishes, all of which were good.  Overall, for the 4 of us, with tax and 2 desserts, the meal was around $97, which was good considering we ordered a very healthy amount of food.

You get a basket of bread to start your meal. The Bulgarian spice blend in the wooden spice box on the table, mixed with the olive oil, was so tasty!

The menu is full of intriguing and pleasantly unfamiliar terms, I love to learn new preparations when the background is this authentic. Upon recommendation of the server I had a watermelon and finely grated feta (so creamy it actually melts on your palette) salad garnished with lemon, sesame and finely cut super fresh red onion. The moisture content, texture and brightness was really wonderful on a hot summer day. I also tried the shrimp and garlic loaded with herbs and butter & wine, great contrast to the salad. So many great things on the menu to try I wish my stomach was bigger.

But the two stars is about the service, or lack thereof.  We made reservations specifying a birthday, that was ignored as were we for the first 10 minutes after being seated.   Nothing came quickly, no apologies for the slow service and we had to ask for refills to our water 3 times before anyone brought us some.  There was a large birthday celebration just beginning to set up while we were there and MAYBE that threw them off but then be aware of it and apologize to those who got bad service because of it.  I didn't see anyone who could be called a manager there.

Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and the food and recommended her favorites.  She was from Russia and I trust that what we had would have been considered good by those familiar with the food.

The decor is funky but nice, the guy playing the guitar was reserved and nicely in the background but you can't excuse the slow service.   And maybe the food was good just not up to my tastes and I do think I am adventurous.

Maybe the popularity of this place was the mention of Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives which I didn't see but they promote their appearance on it a lot.

We ordered the Bulgarian Mixed Grill, Calamares Rellanos En Su Tinta, Thracian Clay Pot (which our server addressed that it would take 20 minutes to make), and Baklava for dessert. The food was amazing. The mixed grill was an assortment of 3 types of sausages and pickled vegetables. The Calamares was squid with spanish fried rice. It was wonderful... but we never got the clay pot. It was 40 minutes after we placed our order. We had to flag down another server to let them know we never got the other half of our order and we'll just settle with the baklava. Our server said the clay pot never went through the system. I find that hard to believe considering one of the servers tried to serve the couple next to us who was seated around the same time as us the same clay pot (which they got earlier) and then the server went back. Thankfully, we weren't charged for the claypot and the baklava was comped.

I was part of April's party and she clearly paid more attention than I did so I'll just add my 2 cents.  We tried this place based on a recommendation from my Russian realtor.  

I tried the stroganoff and it was ok - not the best I've ever had but it wasn't bad.  Oh - and the rose nectar vodka - that stuff was good but man it packed a punch.  

I tried some sort of dumpling thing (what April mentioned, I think) and it was *really* good.  I wish I had ordered one of those just for me.  I tried the bread side dish (the description was similar to bruschetta) but it was boring and overpriced.  

That dessert plate the waitress brought with the pastries was excellent.  Those alone are reason to go back.  

The decor is weird - it looks like a bunch of tables taken from peoples dining rooms.  And the artwork is really weird too.

I don't know why, because this place is soooo not any of those things. It's a cozy little restaurant with string lights and cool paintings, dim lit, verrrry cool!
On Saturdays, there's an acoustic guitar player, he plays your favorites, with his twist. Soooo fun! He remembers my fave song, and plays it for me without being prompted (hotel california ) !!!
Great family owned restaurant, the owner ,Nina is so nice she walks around and greets everyone. The servers there are all friends and you can tell, really friendly fun atmosphere. I haven't even started on the food!!!!! 
My husband is so picky, he hates everything, but he LOVES this place. He's from another country and american restaurants just don't cut it for him. They cook basic foods, hardly any seasonings, basically cooked with no feeling at all.  You can tell this food was cooked with love, you can just taste it. Such intricate flavors! I could seriously close my eyes and point at the menu and whatever I choose will be amazing! ( I've actually done that before hehe!)

It was the only thing that we ordered that I didn't eat. I took a small bite but something in me told me I didn't like it. I have a good sense for food quality. 

My husband agreed that it didn't taste like it was bad but the calamari was not hot enough and we think it wasn't stored at proper temperatures. I've been in the food business for years.

Although most of my orginal review was accurate outside of the calamari, I can't get past the fact that my husband was sick for two days because of them. 

NEVER AGAIN.

I've been here at least five times now and the food is always excellent.  It's fun taking new people here to try it, especially people from out of town so they can see all the different foods Vegas has to offer.  Of course, Forte was featured on DDD, so that's always a sign of a great place.  

Everything on the menu is great.  My personal favorites are the Bulgarian Easter Lamb, Lamb Chop Lollipops, the Bulgarian Mixed Grill, the Thracian Clay Pot, and any of the salads.  The Black True Caviar with Truffle Salami Flatbread is awesome, but they don't offer it anymore.  I wasn't really a fan of the Russian dishes, but my wife loved the dumplings since they reminded her of the Ukrainian neighborhood in Chicago.  I wasn't really a fan, but I liked the Perogies we tried when we were in Poland.  With that comparison, I still didn't like the dumplings at Forte, but I'll take my wife's word for it that they are good as related to Russian ones.  

The servers are always nice and friendly.  The restaurant recently remodeled, so it is a bit more comfortable.  The music is like being in Eastern Europe with the eletronica, but it's not too loud.  The service is a bit on the slow side, so don't go here if you're in a hurry.  You might want to look at the menu ahead of time to put in a food order with your drink order since it might take a bit of time for the server to return to take your food order.",7cgp0EXG11v-y4F6sDU1hg,1,0,5,nqiLghVGcxE_e3QKHoH-vA

Atmosphere: Inside kind of looks like a bar/lounge.  Outside is a patio.  We sat inside as it's so hot out.  Unfortunately, on Fridays and Saturdays it turns into a 'club'.  Although the only people there were about 5 or 6 at the bar and our table of 6, the DJ still played the loudest, most irritating techno music throughout the whole meal.  We couldn't even talk to each other.

Food: Almost inedible!  I've had delicious mediterranean food before.  The food here was terrible.  The bread was hard.  My girlfriend called it poor man's bread.  We split the stuffed peppers and some garlic fries with herbs.  The fries were ok had they not been drenched in oil.  The peppers were so gross.  They had such a nasty flavor and were stuffed with some kind of mystery meat/rice mix.  It was all covered with a terrible white sauce with a weird dill flavor.  Our friend had a feta cheese stuffed pepper and it also had that nasty white sauce.  We ordered the tres quesos  pizza for the table and it was too cheesy and way too salty.  I prefer chuck e cheese over this!  Another one of our friends got the cheese in a clay pot and I can't even understand how that was edible.  It was hard chunky cheese and eggs with some veggies in there.  So gross.  

At one point, I had to go to the bathroom because I thought I was going to throw up.  The loud music mixed with the disgusting tasting and smelling food just put me over the edge.

Regardless though, I have a good palette and having eaten a fair amount of traditional eastern european food, I do consider myself qualified to give an opinion.

We also had the Pelmini which was just a delight and the sour cream was the prefect accompaniment.  
   My main course was the Bulgarian Mixed Grill.  The sausages were all unique and very tasty.  The pepper sauce was great with the pieces of sausage.  Again everyone loved this as we shared it.

To hold their fort down, outside of the restaurant are heavy-duty patio furnishings and a green metal gate with two different entrances. Just hop right in whichever side, left or right, and open the darkly tinted door. 

A server, Robert, greeted us and told us to choose a seat anywhere. There were candles to light the dining room. There was one other group that we saw and they were chatting in Russian. 

Apparently, the dining room is split in half and there are other dining tables further back and to the left side of the restaurant because the server went back there several times with food and drink.

I highly recommend trying the Selyodka, Adjarski Khachapurri, Thracian Cheese Clay Pot, and their Pelmeni Dumplings.

Selyodka: definitely fish and potatoes done right with some olive oil, dill and great pairing of flavors that really wow you

Adjarski Khachapurri: Refer to Frank W.'s review for a description. It's a great description. This one was delicious and the bread just sensational

The dining room has an Old World comfortable feeling and the wait staff is friendly and helpful. Service was excellent up to the up to the point of placing our dinner order.

Items ordered were Chicken Salad, Stuffed Grape Leaves, Hungarian Goulash and Thracian Clay Pot. While waiting, a glance around the room reveled that very few tables were receiving their food. Our server apologized for the wait and told us that our dinners would be out shortly and the entire meal with cocktails would be complementary. 
We waited one hour for our food.

The Stuffed Grape Leaves were appetizers however we received something else and it was returned and replaced with the correct item. Several other items were not up to our satisfaction. The Hungarian Goulash was over salted and the dish was refused. The Thracian Clay Pot was heavy on the cheese and light on sausage. It did not look like the one made on the Diners Drive Ins and Dives show. There must have been something seriously wrong in the kitchen on the night of our visit.

Don't let the plaza keep you from trying this place.  It's in a predominantly Hispanic plaza anchored by a Mexican market.  My son thought I was joking when I pulled in.  However, the restaurant inside was quite nice.  It felt like a funky restaurant that you would find in San Francisco.  Cool colors, cool posters, and a good mix of deep house music playing on the speakers.  

Once we walked in we were greeted by some beautiful servers in tight black striped dresses.  Behind the bar was the even more beautiful owner that I saw on TV.  She was charming and I told her that we were there because the show.  

We sat down and our server (I think her name was Nataliya) brought us a loaf of homemade bread and water in a recycled bottle of vodka.  She instructed us to dip the bread in olive oil with an optional mix of Bulgarian spices.  Delicious.  

We happened to be there in the last hour of happy hour so I ordered their Angry Lemonade (delicious cocktail with lemon juice, mint, vodka, and a sprig of rosemary).   They serve this in an attractive copper mug.  

My son ordered a sprite but the nice touch was the carafe of sprite that they left for refills.  

As I said, we were hungry so we ordered the Bulgarian mixed grill, garlic fries, Serrano & Arugula pizza, and Gambas Al Ajillo (delicious shrimp sautéed with garlic, white wine, and other herbs).   

I was a little disappointed that the fries came first, but they were delicious.  They looked like McDonald's fries covered with herbs and garlic.  Only $5.

The shrimp came next and these were unbelievable.  It was so good that we immediately ordered another.  The shrimp were cooked perfectly and the white wine sauce was so good that we asked for another loaf of bread so we could dip it.  Only $7.

The pizza was mediocre.  Generous amount of Serrano and arugula...possibly too generous because it was a bit salty.  The texture made it tough to eat.  I don't think it was cooked long enough.  The dough was soft and the pizza was a bit runny.  We are less than half of this and took the rest home.  

The mixed grill was as delicious as we saw on TV.  Homemade sausages grilled with an delicious bean relish and this tomato sauce.   Only $11 for this plate.  Wow!!

Service was excellent.  The food was delicious and very reasonable.  The ambience was hip.  This is clearly a restaurant that is well-run with attentive owner-operators.  

We will be back with the rest of the family.  I would return to the bar for the beautiful servers.  They were hot!!",sjZ3ScfAJ2bjDVI6MmSNGA,2,0,5,L2GSyRhllIWvRbn8pvuRJA

When I saw Forte featured on ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives,"" I was skeptical that the food could be as delicious as it looked and sounded.  But wow, I'm so glad I tried it and found out that I was totally wrong - this is excellent food and drink, in a lovely atmosphere with great service.

The location is definitely more for locals than Strip-visiting tourists, so I'm glad that we had rented a car (to spend our days at Red Rock Canyon and the Valley of Fire).  At first, it wasn't clear that they were open, because the windows are dark (an open sign would aid walk-in business), but we trudged through the patio area and went inside and were met with a gorgeous colorful interior!  It's a fun and eclectic space, I really loved the style.  (The men's room is particularly awesome, decorated in crazy Eastern European propaganda posters.  Or so I hear.)

The table bread was fantastic, especially dipped in oil with their hand-blended spice mix.  We could've eaten tons of it!  Everything on the menu and specials board was enticing, but we finally settled on a bunch of small plates: Adjarski Khachapurri (really fun dough boat, enjoyed the egg on top), Thracian clay pot (smaller than expected, everything inside was tasty), chebureki (dumplings so deliciously flaky and dill-y that we ordered a second round), kebabche (one of the sausages we saw on the show, as delicious as we'd hoped it would be), and the Bulgarian bean relish (refreshing, something I'm going to try to make at home).  I also got two tasty beverages - the angry ginger lemonade (delicious, not at all boozy) and a bloody mary made with their garden veggie-infused vodka (this was so amazing, I need to infuse my own vodkas immediately).  I was stuffed by the end of the meal and still longing to try more things!

The best part?  It was an incredibly affordable meal, especially for the quality and quantity.  You can easily eat a great meal, with drinks, for $25 per person.",40pYoBJA9rcoXPZqWGyyfg,5,1,5,jZwro5C9JRRUxghICGA5Kw

They have the best seasoning, right at the table. Mix it with the oil for your bread. The octopus on rice has so much flavor.  We usually get the lamb and beef confit..it has pickles also to enhance the flavor.  The fries are crisp and perfect. Never burnt or soggy. Pelmeni is so good, I'd come just for that.  Whatever cheese they use in the breads...are fresh and flavorful. The thracian clay pot is a must try. The egg on top is runny, but it's good.  Pierogis are good too. Can't remember the name of the serbian dish we had,  but it's a burger with a cheese spread and chopped onions.  The meat is seasoned and has a very nice spice combo,  which is situated with tender bread. It's actually really big, so share it with someone if you're planning to eat other tapas.

The first time that I walked into Forte, the owner, Nina, came over to introduce herself and tell us about her menu. Now YEARS LATER, Nina still is the same fun, gracious owner that she was in the early days. 

And the food!!! It really doesn't matter what you order, it WILL BE OUTSTANDING!!! You know how some restaurants lose quality over time, NOT FORTE, they just keep getting better and better. 

Diners, Drive Ins and Dives Guy Fieri did a segment about Forte. He couldn't say enough great things about Forte and they are ALL true. In fact, I believe that Nina and her father, Stephan were the only people to ever PUNK Guy. It was hilarious.

Highlights for me were the Adjarski Khachapurri and stroganoff, though I didn't snag a bite of anything that was less than tasty.

Also, I was enchanted by the painted glass my cocktail arrived in, it was deemed instagram worthy! After checking out their website, it seems it was painted by the owner herself, which between that and her ""punking"" of Guy Fieri (also viewable on the website) leads me to believe she's a pretty neat lady.

I came in during the 4-7pm daily Happy Hour and had a few drinks, the stuffed dates, and the chicken paprikash.  All was very good and unique to the area.  The menu consisted mostly of Bulgarian, Hungarian, and Russian cuisine, but also had some normal tapas selections as well.  The cocktails were tasty but a little light on the alcohol content.

Overall I really enjoyed my meal here.  The restaurant is pretty small but nice.  Happy Hour is the way to go for $5 cocktails and beers and then order your tapas or meals alongside.

Drinks: angry ginger lemonade, all the girls ordered their share of alcohol but I still enjoyed my drink the most so I got two! It has the taste of mule but it was YUMMY! You must like ginger. I believe Gypsy Milk was a close second.

Dates: I love dates and this was alright. it wasn't my favorite dish but would I order again? YES! Gets the cravings away. 

Forte Fries: such a simple yet delicious item. We got the one without the feta cheese. That dill on top was a nice herbal seasoning and it balances out the heaviness of fries. GOOD. GET IT.

Octopus in Olive Oil: lots of olive oil in it. Wasn't a fan of the octopus dish but the rice with it was good. 

Shrimp: We got the shrimp but I didn't eat any of it. I was too lazy to ask or reach for it. Silly reason right? It is pictured.

Bulgarian Mix: All the sausages and meats had excellent flavor. However, they were too salty for me. I wasn't a fan of this. 

Margarita Flat Bread: BOMB. I love margarita pizza and I always want to try it if I see it on the menu. The crust was nice n crispy. nice freshness from that basil and tomato with that crispy crusty goodness!

Feta Cheese roll: This is not pictured. But I think this bread was amazing!!! I couldn't stop eating it even after being full. They have a side of sour cream with it.

The fist time I came here, it was perfect! My group of friends and I were seated in the back at a large table, food and drinks flowed. I ordered the Bangers and Mash dish. To put it simply, it was amazing. I really loved the flavor of the sausage, and the mashed potatoes were creamy and rich. I also got to try some of Vanessa N.'s Watermellon and Feta salad, which was also great. The drink of choice was the Moscow Mule, served in the classic copper mug. Also, I tried the Gypsy Milk. These too, super tasty and well balanced drinks. I really couldn't say anything negative after that initial experience.

Now... The second time was a bit different. I had recently seen Forte featured on TV, and wanted to try one of the dishes I had seen. This turned out to be the Thracian Clay Pot. I was so stoked to taste it, especially after not one, but two of my friends told me it would be delicious. 
Honestly, it was just meh. I didn't think it tasted bad, but it's not something I would ever order again. Nothing about the dish really popped. It was... Dare I say?.... Kinda boring. 

I will say that the drinks didn't disappoint. The mules again were great. And with that $5 happy hour price tag, they were even better. But I'm sorry, I gotta bring it up. There was some lady sitting at the bar while holding her dog in her lap. Really weird, and pretty unsanitary. And that dog really did not look like a service dog. As we left the restaurant, she and the dog were outside in the dark patio area and it started loudly barking at us. Umm, what? Luckily, I'm not scared of dogs (it was a small one), but what if I had been? Pretty much a turn off.

3478421,2014-09-26,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"This place is in need of ""Restaurant Impossible"" makeover.  The place is painted black, with bizarre paintings on the wall, and some strange object that looks like a dinosaur dropping on a table. There was an odd lamp, with a shade that looked like underwear on it. 

I took off one star for the pounding weird loud music that played the entire time we were there. The owner needs to make this place a nice place to dine, or a dive bar. It is more on the edge of dive bar.

That being said, the food...seems to be hit or miss, depending on what you order. The meal started well, with the Mediterranean salad, fresh cucumbers,  tomatoes,  onion, with a delightful sauce. Ample portion for three to have a dinner salad. Another win was the fresh warm bread. The Sangria was weak, pass on that, tasted like Kool-Aid. The Borscht was served warm, with sour cream,  win on that.  The dumplings with meat, I did not care for them,  they tasted of liver to me. The worst dish was the flat bread with basil and tomatoes.  Greasy, not cooked through,  skip this. We also ordered sautéed mushrooms,  served cold, meh...dessert was a honey ""crepe"", more like a pancake.  But it was served with powered sugar and walnuts. The latte I ordered came with whipped cream,  win. 

So, the food was okay...The service was also inconsistent.  We left, and went to Fat burger to use the restroom,  mainly due to the fact we could not stand the music and creepy decor any longer.

3496280,2012-07-02,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Yes, I saw this on DDD.  Yes, I'm slightly embarrassed about that.  However, I'm more ashamed of the fact that this place is walking distance from my house, and it took my tragic Food Network addiction to draw my attention to it!

First things first...this place is pretty small.  There aren't a lot of tables, and the bar takes up much of the main entrance.  There is outdoor seating, but given that this is summertime in Vegas, and the restaurant faces westward, it's way too hot to sit out in the evening.  

Second thing - if you, like me, are vertically challenged, I highly recommend getting a seat in the restaurant area.  My group had a table in the bar area at first, and the chair was so high I actually had trouble getting on and off.  Comfy once I was up there though!

Service wise...this place was fine.  Our waitress was nice enough, but it didn't seem like she got our group's sense of humor.  She was efficient, but not overly friendly.  It was pretty busy, but we got everything we ordered in a reasonable turnaround time, so I had no issues with service.

The drinks were awesome.  I had the gypsytini to start the night, and although it's a ""house secret"" blend that my waitress couldn't describe, what I ended up with was a vodka martini that was lightly tart and fruity.  Very refreshing and tasty.  Another friend had the Ginger Lemonade cocktail, and the addition of fresh herbs like rosemary gave it a wonderful flavor.

We ordered a pretty decent array of food for our group.  It's hard to mess up almond-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, so those were a fab way to start the night.  I ordered the varenikis, and I was a big fan of the fried onion topping.  The dumplings themselves were slightly cold, but it seemed like that had more to do with the sour cream juice (sorry for the lack of a more appetizing descriptor) cooling them down on the plate.  My buddy who hates onions actually loved the onions on this dish.

I grew up with a mom and grandmother who made goulash on a regular basis, and Forte's version was almost on par with my preferred version.  The chorizo we ordered was pleasantly smoky, but not as spicy as I would have liked.

One of my less adventurous friends actually ordered the adjarski khachapurri, which is finished table side by the server, who breaks the egg yolk and stirs it around to made a sort of custard spread for the bread boat.  Although he wasn't sure about it at first bite, by the time we looked up we had eaten the whole thing!  It was addictive and delicious, so definitely try it out.

All told we had six people, five of us with at least a couple drinks, and we ended up with a total bill of about $100 including food.  Not a bad price, and we'll definitely hit up this hole-in-the-wall next time we want something a little off the beaten path.",kkYsGbpZadE9skXgf9m9lw,4,1,4,YY8eiEjoIAmPkj5dJNwYag

First of all the atmosphere is unique.  It looks like someone bought a whole bunch of furniture from a garage sale and threw it in the space.  The chairs with the tables really don't work if you are trying to sit down and have a meal. 

There was only one server working the lunch crowd so service was super slow.  When she finally got around to us, she dropped off a bottle of vodka, what I thought,  to the table.  It was actually an old vodka bottle that they reuse to fill with water.  A little alarming to me as I'm not sure what health code allows but this was odd.   The server also dropped off a stale basket of bread in which they toast to hide the fact the bread was old.  Even my husband who is from Europe didn't even it.  

I ordered a mediterranean salad and the chicken shish kabob.  My husband had the borsht and the lescovacka pljeskavica.  Apparently, the borsht was not very good but the lescovacka was edible.  The flavors were to be somewhat desired in my opinion.  I barely touched my food and the server never even asked if everything was okay when she took it away.

The most disgusting version I had at Forte. Please never order it there. The person who prepared it should go straight to culinary hell. 

Borsht is not a bowl of roughly chopped crunchy vegetables lacking any taste or  flavour including salt. 

My second choice was Hungarian Goulash. Although I am not an expert on this I am capable to figure out that this dish should be not what I got: old starchy mashed potatoes covered with the sauce way too spicy for a goulash (think Indian or Thai level) with 5 tiny pieces of meat. 

I guess the waitress may have known that she is serving food not suitable for human consumption and therefore has never asked how was it.

I had been wanting to try Forte for some time but put it off because it was a bit out of the way from me. After months of procrastinating I finally committed to having dinner here and I'm sure glad that I did. 

First off the dining area was uniquely comfortable with what I can only describe as an Eastern European atmosphere/vibe. Pretty cool. I didn't catch our waitresses name but she was great! Friendly and helpful to us who are mostly unfamiliar with the cuisine. 

My group ordered a handful of things but these are what stood out:

The Bacon Almond Dates:
Unique flavor pairing but it worked. The bacon was the dominant taste IMO

Shopska Salad:
Tasty fresh and light. Perfect balance for a salad dish. The tomatoes cucumbers and feta were a nice combo

Stuffed Grape Leaves:
Loved them. Perfectly seasoned and the yogurt dill sauce was so good I sopped it up with the table bread (also great).

Thracian Clay Pot:
Delicious. I broke the egg immediately and mixed it around with the sausage/tomatoes/peppers and it was the bomb. Really hot but after I let it cool the flavors packed into that little pot were terrific. 

Bulgarian Mixed Grill:
Not sure exactly what was in it (kind of like a rice meat and veg mixture) but it was another unique yet satisfying flavor combination. I had a hint of sweet that joined nicely with the otherwise savory dish. 

Bulgarian Easter Lamb:
Extremely tender meat with some tasty mashed potatoes and another light salad. Again full of flavor

Some of the soups and salads are vegan and vegetarian options for those interested. Definitely something I will look to try another time. Obviously I would recommend this restaurant to friends or anyone for that matter. It was a great experience",kMi3tiQJ4zbK9V3eLJToqg,1,0,5,NC5Wk0IlpLeyMGU9Q0ybUg

I had their dish that was a sample of different sausages. The plate was huge and the price was decent. Atmosphere is nice and its dimly lit. Service is nice with nothing major to complain about.

The food seems good based off the sausage sampler i got and they also have great bread. So with bread being served as a default, the place is going to be extremely filling. I never left a place that full that wasnt a buffet. Also their bread is amazing with that odd blend of spices and olive oil they offer.

Service is alright. My only complaint is water not being delivered as fast.

Atmosphere is nice and a bit divey. Dim lights are always nice and theres outdoor seating available if you dont like the inside or the weather is nice.

They serve water in hard liquor bottles which is humorous. The only draw back to this is the limited water youre able to get at a time.

Pros: good food at a decent price for it, complementary bread which is great and filling, nice sense if humor with the water.

Cons: water is limited at a time and it can take some time to get it replaced unless you just ask.

Advice: if youre still hungry after the main dish, just get more bread. Try to ask for 2 sets of water if you drink water that much or have a group of friends.",xS4eeHlnIyGdyo2qnI9d4Q,0,0,4,2HTqV0Mzyv9mWzb6Zy73FQ

3848813,2015-08-02,2,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Local friends recommend this place so I did no Yelp snooping beforehand, but it turned out to be a huge hit. I will say that food/flavor/atmosphere-wise it deserved 5 stars. However, there were only 2 servers working on a busy Thursday night and although they were trying hard, it definitely hampered the experience a bit.

 
Unfortunately, most of the food was ordered from our friend's memory so I'll have to just describe it rather than name it. Now, about the food:

Starter Salads: 
They ordered two, both of which were topped with generous helpings of a very light and fluffy feta cheese. It sounds like it could be overbearing, but it wasn't and totally worked with each. The first was like a traditional Greek salad with tomatoes, cucumbers, and of course the fresh feta. The second had watermelon and basil with the feta. Both were light, fresh, and very tasty in their own idiom. 

Sleeper pick
We got two helpings of a hot and fluffy pizza crust type bread with a fried egg in the middle. You stir the egg yolk around on top and then tear off chunks of this very tasty seasoned puffy bread slathered in the egg yolk. Words again can't do it justice, but it is sooooo good! Order one just to try and you may have to double down like we did. You are in Vegas after all. 

Main Course Dishes:
We had the Eastern Lamb dish (can't remember the actual Russian title but it was two words with a lot more consonants in a row than usual). It was cooked just a hair too well done for my taste, but in all fairness I didn't order and specify the temperature. The seasoning and flavor was bold and very tasty. 
We also got what was described as ""Siberian Burgers"" which was cooked perfectly and incredibly flavorful. I highly recommend this. 

The ambiance was very eclectic with EDM versions of the latest dance songs playing in the background, but not overbearingly loud. The lighting is low, but the walls and furniture seemed to be painted and bedazzled gypsy style, which makes you feel like your in the Eastern Bloc and not West of the Vegas Strip.

We have gotten the pan con tomate both times because it is so fresh and tasty! We also got a salad with cucumbers, fresh feta, green onions, and roasted peppers and I dusted that dish off quick! We splurged and got the $20 cheese, but, and preserve plate. I did not like the bleu cheese at all but the other 3 were delicious. There was a fig served on the side that was obviously soaked in some sort of alcohol. It was a little overpowering. We ended up taking the leftovers of the cheese plate home.

My boyfriend ordered the clay pot and didn't eat much because he was so stuffed from the cheese and and complementary bread that comes with dinner. We have the leftovers in the fridge right now :P

The first time we came here, we got the vereniki which is like a pirogi. It was so amazing and had a very light flavor. My boyfriend got the goulash and liked it very much! It wasn't what I was expecting but he really enjoyed it. I got the adjarski khachapurri which is a boat-shaped bread with cheese and egg in it. It was soo filling and tasty. I'll definitely get that again!!

As far as drinks, we got 3 different drinks and they were during happy hour so it was cheap! I got an angry ginger lemonade and it was wayyyy too gingery for me so my boyfriend drank it. He ordered the GF forte jackass and said it was too gingery but I thought it wasn't too bad!

Once greeted by the friendly staff, or owner who is there often, you are brought scrumptious bread. You need to order a pitcher of Sangria! It's pretty delish, not too sweet but just right. 
We always order tapas here & highly recommend items from their specials menu. Last time we were there we had the Lamb Lollipops with Forte Fries...HOLY GOODNESS! Then we had the Artisian Characuterie Plate, also spectacular. It doesn't matter which dish you try, it's a great experience & you will be back for more.

2 Stars on Service -- if its crowded, or a line in front of you, walk away and come back another day.

Being of Eastern European descent, I'll try anyplace that serves borscht, sausage and pirogi, no matter what their language calls it.  We saw Forte on DDD and their Thracian Pot and Mixed Grill platters were a calling to enjoy.

Ate here on a Saturday night.  Their website suggests reservations which, if you want service, I'd recommend.  There were seven of us and we each ordered different plates, all cooked so well.  Everything was perfectly seasoned.  I think Forte put ""Tapas"" in their name because this place serves your food like its in Europe, which means that your food comes to the table as its prepared -- its not like in the US where every order comes at the same time.  We had some main dishes before appetizers but most all of it came out promptly and we were all allowed to share each others plates.

The Borscht was basic and tasty.  Like at a food court in Moscow.
The dolmas were great -- it reminded me that we haven't made any since our grape leaf sister-in-law ripped out her plant.
The lamb and beef confit were great.
Ask for a carafe of water at the table because service is slow when it gets crowded.
Feta fries were excellent.  Made us think of the last place that we loved feta fries and we still can't remember its name.
The Thracian Pot was excellent
The pirogies, although they're called something else in Cyrillic, were great.
The stuffed meat deep fried turnovers were okay -- could use some more meat in them.  The meat was seasoned and tasty, just could use a little more meat.
The Beef Stroganoff was very very good.  Its something I'll try to recreate at home.  Their sauce was so intense in flavor.  I'll get this again.

I can't think of anything that we didn't enjoy eating.  Unfortunately, they have some problems -- it appears no one want to be a server.  We watched as table after table of people would just get up and walk away -- leave.  They would be seated, and after about 15 minutes of not being waited on, just leave.  All the while, 3 people are behind the bar just hanging out, pouring some drinks but hanging out.  Maybe the waitress's called in sick that day, but I counted about 16 people get up and leave.  That's money walking and never coming back.  I also saw the people next to us sit for a good 30 minutes before being waited on, and then 10 minutes later for some bread, a draft beer and a soda.   Its quite sad because the food is great, but the staff is scaring away the income.
By the way, after everybody in our party of 7 were fed and full, I was still waiting for my mixed grill.  It was about the time where I was deciding whether to just stop by a fast-food on the way home or put out the wait that our server asked if we wanted anything else.  I told her I hadn't had my plate yet.  Another 15 minutes later, it came.  Great plate - 3 kinds of sausage, some cold white bean salad that's not slimy or vinegary, and a red pepper/tomato whip -- I forget the name.  The sausages are all great to try as each has their own flavor and texture.  I was glad I waited.    Next time I'm here, I'm going for the Stroganoff, probably the Borscht again, and perhaps something else.  If I don't have a waitress next time, I'm just ordering at the bar like in Europe.  maybe that's the gig.",BGA-V3gxUe0m1MXzf1n5Tg,4,2,3,8ARRdt6ZUJZkyvUwqNq6YQ

First they bring out their homemade bread, to die for, with olive oil and Hungarian spices.  My wife and I are not big bread eaters, but this was sensational.


Like many others, I discovered them on triple D with Fieri.  So many things on the menu look great, but we went with the two highlighted on the show, the mixed grill and the Thracian clay pot.  If you are a pork lover ,this is your place!  All three items on the mixed Grill are prepared differently with unique taste and all were exceptional.  The clay pot with feta cheese, tomato peppers and more sliced pork covered with a baked egg was unbelievably good. The feta cheese took on a flavor I've never had and the tomato was cooked down to be cut with spoon but still have body and flavor.  We cleaned both plates.

At that point I asked for the check as we were trying to make a late show. In passing, my wife said it was my birthday. The hostess would not let us leave without boxing up a dessert to take with us. At no charge!  What an unexpected pleasure and it too was delicious later that night in our room!

We were seated at two high top tables right as you come in the door.  While we were looking at the menu and talking about other things, we were approached for our order.  We asked her to wait awhile as we kept studying what we wanted.

We were soon brought some bread.  They were large round puffs larger and flatter than a doughnut.  There was olive oil on the table and we pulled pieces off the bread to dip in the oil.  It was good.

Our things started coming out.  The first plate was a shared Spanish ""nacho"" platter.  It consisted of some chips with thin chorizo slices and topped with a tasty truffle salsa.

We were brought two orders of meat pies that were also good.  Next came a dish stuffed baby squid served over Spanish herb rice.  

We also ordered each of their specialty breads--a feta cheese stuffed filo dough round and Adjarski Khachapurri, described as traditional Georgian boat shaped bread filled with two types of Georgian styled pickled cheeses and a cracked egg mixed on top (after our photos).  Both were good breads.  It was difficult cutting the Georgian bread with the egg but we managed to mangle it enough that everyone got a chance to try some.  The filo round was easy.  All we had to do was pull a piece of the roll off and dip it in the sour cream if we wanted.  The bread was brought straight from the oven because it was extremely hot.

We had two orders of almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates with a sherry reduction.  The dates were OK but I thought they were cooked a bit too much.

Next came some Easter or spring lamb with some mashed potatoes and some salad.  I didn't think the lamb had much of the lamb flavor I was expecting and it was in a dark sauce.  I guess I'm too used to having lamb rare and not done in a stew manner.  It was extremely tender.

We closed out this part of lunch with the Thracian clay pot described on the menu as a ""traditional Bulgarian specialty of tomatoes, peppers, onion, feta, Bulgarian style charcuterie, and egg baked in a Bulgarian clay pot.  For me, this was the stand out of our lunch.  it had lots of flavor.  I used some of the spice on the table to give it some extra flavor.  On the table was a spice boat with a small wooden spoon.  The woman told us that it was a mixture of 40 spices with cumin, garlic, salt, and.....  We didn't ask her to continue.

Then dessert was ordered.  We got some baklava and their biscuit cake.  The biscuit cake was the star!  The menu describes it as ""decadent cake layered with honey biscuits, mascarpone, rich chocolate, Lavazza espresso, and a kick of spiced rum topped with walnuts and more chocolate.  Need I write any more?  The baklava was not like I'm used to in how it's made but it was OK.

I thought the food was pretty good.  I wanted to give the place more stars but the part that held me back was the service.  We had asked at the start not to bring all the dishes out but they just kept coming--not all at once--but close enough together that there wasn't a chance to rest a bit between tastings.  The number of plates and fitting them on our two tables became a bit of an issue.  Instead of giving us clean plates periodically, we had the same ones until the main courses were completed.  We got clean plates for dessert.  We also had to ask twice to get more water.  For such a small place with two servers at least, things should have been done better.  

I might go back to try one of the other main dishes.  And of course, getting some more biscuit cake should always be foremost in my mind.

As always, good company made lunch a much better time!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,10,3,Gpo-2lh59Bru8sKqgRm5Hw
3977808,2015-04-13,9,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I enjoyed quite the delicious dinner at this quaint little place. Offering a variety of cuisine from the European continent, but I settled for the Beef Stroganoff Ragu, not served over noodles, but pelmeni stuffed with mushrooms for $9.

Before the stroganoff arrived, the meal started with some moist house Russian bread with a side of extra virgin olive oil and some red spices, mostly made of paprika. The Russina wheat bread was great and eaten with the dressed up olive oil was bliss. 

The Stroganoff was quite the treat. First of all, the ragu was very well made. It was thick and rich with a great flavor: a deep rich flavor that took time to develop, and some skill to make. Somebody had a great recipe hidden back there.  The pelmeni's mushrooms inside were tender, very well seasoned, and had a great natural flavor. Also, the pelmeni's itself, the shell, had a great chewiness in a very good way. No doubt they were cooked well. I'm telling you, I could of eaten a mountain of these. 

I also tried tasters from a Bulgarian Mixed Grill which was quite good. Nataliya, the server was absolutely amazing. She not only was very well verse in Forte's cuisine and its individual preparations, but she reserved extreme patience. She was very prompt and always had a great smile on her face.

4147130,2016-02-18,3,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Forte has been on my radar for years.  Ever since I saw it on ""Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.""  I don't know why it took me so long to get here but I finally did the other night.  And now I am kicking myself for not making it in sooner because it is so good.  From the food to the friendly hospitality asking me how the food was, how my beer was, if I needed more ice for my water.  This was well worth the visit, long as it may have taken me to get around to.

I had a wonderful meal sitting alone in the back corner of the dining room observing all the art work and people spread throughout the establishment.  It wasn't overly busy on a Tuesday evening around 5:30 but there were a few groups of people.  One small group outside, a small group inside, a larger group a little closer to where I sat, and a couple.  I could not tell if they all could hear the music playing or if they were even paying attention to it but I can tell you that I was rocking out.  I sat almost directly below the speaker.  I closed my eyes and was suddenly transported to an Eastern European night club (think ""Eurotrip"").  I half expected to hear ""Scotty Doesn't Know"" at any moment.  I'm not always into dance hall type music but in this case, it was fitting.

My meal started with the complimentary bread basket with a saucer of olive oil sprinkled with the spice blend sitting on each table.  I know there was a little bit of salt in the blend.  Beyond that, I am at a loss.  It was good though and that is all that matters.  

Next up on my tour of the menu was a Bulgarian beer, Zakorga, which came with a complimentary meat plate.  On this plate was four pieces of cured meat similar to salami in appearance, two gerkins and an olive complete with pit.  The meat was not as salty or spicy as salami.  Rather it was the sweet nuttyness of a natural dry cured meat almost like a prosciutto.  What a perfect accompaniment to a beer.    

To start my actual meal, I ordered stuffed grape leaves and beef stroganoff ragu.

The grape leaves are meat stuffed and served hot with a rich yogurt sauce topped with fresh dill and parsley.  There was a wedge of lemon on the side.  A quick spritz of juice over the leaves really rounded out the plate.  The vibrant acidity cut through the richness of the yogurt nicely.  

The stroganoff that came up next was also very rich.  It was a ground beef strognaoff in a full bodied sour cream sauce served over wild mushroom pelmeni (dumplings).  It was very good on its own but, in hindsight, the spice blend next to me would have been a fitting addition. 

What meal is complete without dessert? I was considering the baklava but after hearing the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake described to me, I knew that was my dessert.  I was told it is made with a type of cake that cannot be found anywhere else in the valley.  And that it was layered with a cream filling like tiramisu, one of my favorite desserts.  How could I even think about passing this up?  I was surprised by the size of this cake.  It was bigger than I expected but not as rich I as thought it may be.  The cake used seemed more like a bread which helped to cut down the sweetness.  With the almost but not quite bitter dark chocolate sauce on top, it was balanced out to perfection and was the best possible way to end my meal.  I left with a soft smile on my face that only ended later when I was at home and the euphoria wore off.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,8,3,4,qk1rIf2MptSRpWcfVTnMxw

4265698,2016-03-02,2,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Nice little unassuming place as a perfect starter for a trip to Europe.  Came here with two others.

Ambiance - 4 Stars.  From the outside patio, it looks like any other small restaurant hole in the wall in a strip mall.  It does have outside seating, but inside is better.  Go inside, and the decor/feel is more like an old Seattle Coffee House or a quaint European eatery.  It was quirky, funky, comfortable, relaxed, charming, and generally upbeat.  Great for loud conversations with good friends.

Service - 5 Stars.  From the host when we walked in to the server, the staff were stellar.   We were greeted and seated promptly, with a welcoming smile.  The server was happy to spend time discussing the different dishes, and free and honest in her critiques when we asked her opinion of various dishes.  She kept tabs on us and our progress throughout the meal, timing herself perfectly so as to never come over when our mouths were full of food, but also making sure we were lacking nothing, and even timing perfectly to ask if we were enjoying our dishes.  At the end of the meal, and after dessert, she was happy to chat with us and give me suggestions of food and alcohol to have on an upcoming trip.  Truly professional, super friendly staff here.

Food - 4.5 Stars.  Our starter was the Epicurious Cheese Plate ~ excellent choice with a varied selection of four cheeses paired with nuts and preserves - my oddly favorite mix was the bell pepper type jelly paired with the Qeso de Cabra (I never expected to like bell pepper flavored jelly, but it worked so very well with the cheese).  For main courses we had Hungarian Goulash, Bulgarian Easter Lamb, and Serbian Mixed Grill (yes, we oddly hit up three different countries there).  The Goulash and Lamb were both reviewed as great (though the goulash had one piece of dried spice that had not fully blended in - thus the -.5 star) by those eating the dish, and for me, the Serbian Mixed Grill was a perfect match for my craving.  The spices for the mixed grill meats were unusual for me, but a nice pairing.  The server warned it might be spicy, but i found it to be very mild with a great overall flavor.  I'm not sure what the name of the sausage was, but it was perhaps the most uniquely flavored (in a positive way) sausage I've had.  For dessert, which we almost passed up because we were stuffed by this time (don't DON'T pass up dessert here), we tried the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake, which is basically a lighter, smoother, more yummy version of tiramisu ~ as in, tiramisu 2.0.  Don't question it, just order it.  What's a few pounds between friends?

Drink - 5 Stars.  They have Ginger Beer.  I got addicted to that stuff in Australia, and to find it here anywhere was amazing.  That aside, my friend had a red wine that was very nice and full bodied with hints of berry and no overpowering wood flavor (sorry I forget the name of the wine).  I had a Troyanska Rakija, which is apparently a plum brandy.  I ordered it because of the name, without knowing what it was, and with instructions to the server to not tell me, which she chuckled at, and warned me not to drink it in one shot when she brought it to the table.  The Troyanska Rakija was excellent, from the nice, vaguely fruity scent, to the warm glow it imparted.

Recommendations - Come here with friends and expect to have light-hearted fun.  Have the Bulgarian Biscuit Cake, and then whatever else tickles your fancy at the time.  Try the Troyanska Rakija.  And if you've only ever had Ginger Ale, do yourself a favor and order a Ginger Beer.

Avoid - Nope, I've got nothing.  Oh, yes, if you're seated inside, avoid the step, especially if you choose to drink.",HFMNedGJjPTo162-YSwqwQ,2,1,4,RxJLbGeGGvlNhsCAMu2p8A
4290806,2012-07-27,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I really wanted to like Forte more than I did. I went in optimistic and came out kind of disappointed. 

Part of it was just bad luck. My wife ordered a diet coke and got light brown water because the fountain was down and the server hadn't noticed. She instead ordered a mango juice only to find that they were out. So she had a peach juice instead, which was good but tasted a little bit too much like canned peaches for my tastes. I ordered a mojito. It was plenty strong, but the bartender didn't use enough sugar and the mint was pretty obviously on its way out. I also don't think it got much of a muddle, if any.

The first thing they bring out foodwise is their house-made bread, which was nice and flavorful, especially dipped in the olive oil which is fruity and fragrant. There is a little wooden boat with herbs for the oil, only we weren't provided a spoon so it was difficult to use it. Not a big deal. We managed.

We ordered the pelmeni, vareniki, serrano and manchego, and garlic herb fries. The fries were tasty and they brought plenty of them, so if you're looking for filler it's a good bet. The garlic could have been a little stronger, but I'm kind of a garlic fiend so take that with a grain of salt. The pelmeni were juicy and delicious and the dumpling wrappers had bite and weren't waterlogged. The manchego and serrano was good, but I would have appreciated the ham being cut into pieces so we didn't have to hack the thing up every time we wanted some. It came with some alcaparrones (caperberries) that added some vinegar contrast to what is otherwise a fatty/salty dish.

The vareniki themselves were tasty, but the fried onions that came on top weren't fried - they were burnt. Instead of deliciously caramelized onions, I got black chunks of carbon with some residual onion flavor. Since the vareniki have a delicate flavor on their own, it overpowered the dumplings and killed the dish.

One other thing: the seating is mostly low cafe tables, so you end up kind of hunching over to get at your food. I think we'd have enjoyed it more sitting at one of the tall bar tables or even at the bar itself.

We're going to give the place another shot, because I don't think anyone should rule out a restaurant based on one experience, but this one wasn't entirely positive.",DjsS89nD3eaoUuFhrkc5Ig,1,1,3,O4tAwDed5pW4A3c0wsbvbg

First the service was sooooo slow. This is not a large restaurant, but it took our server over 20 minutes to bring a menu. We had to ask for drinks several times, and we had to ask for a second set of flatware 3 times. 

I started with a ginger lemonade cocktail served in a bronze mug. Delicious! This was the winner. Well worth my $8.

We ordered borscht, a cold beet and cabbage soup, a particular favorite from Eastern Europe and Russia; truffle mashed potatoes; and stroganoff. Each was good but not great. We followed up with the beef and lamb confit, and the star course of the night, lamb lollipop chops! 

I did not care for the size of the portions. Forte holds itself out as a tapas restaurant, but each of these dishes were large enough for a full course. Smaller dishes and smaller prices would be preferable, otherwise this is just an Eastern European/ Russian fusion restaurant and not a tapas place.

The atmosphere is nice and Forte makes for an interesting date spot. I look forward to trying Forte again and hopefully improving their 3 star rating.",0ZrfHMZ4EaXP9zR6AFd7CA,2,2,3,2zbSqD6Gxjdxpq9OGnxrAg

We made the half hour trek to this restaurant earlier today to give it a try.  We arrived shortly after they opened at noon and were immediately seated.  The place is cozy and dim, which would have been more relaxing if the music had been softer and chill - they were piping in some loud house/techno/whatever it was.  We ordered the lángos, of course, along with the Spanish breakfast and palachinka.  Everything was delicious and filling, however it took a really long time to get our food.  We were one of only three other tables there at the time but all of us had to wait over 30 minutes to even get some bread.  The server was very prompt and efficient so it seemed as though it was the fault of the kitchen, as though it simply wasn't prepared for opening hours.  Not a very good first impression, however we'll give Forte another try later since sometimes unfortunate things happen and we did appreciate the tastiness of the food.",ba-Y0G_SDBqSrklm81baHQ,0,0,3,-4VAqF1-n6ttTlPbA5HO_A

Came here with a group of girlfriends from work, one being from Russia. We had made a reservation ahead of time, for which I was glad. At 7 pm, the place was pretty packed, but began clearing out a bit around 8 pm. 

Here's what was on our table:

Adjarski Khachapurri - giant boat bread with soft cheese and a cracked egg. This was amazing. The flavor wasn't overdone and it was fresh out of the oven!

Beef Strogannoff Ragu - we all know what this is and it was awesome

Vereniki and Pelmeni - two different types of dumplings with sour cream. They were not overly greasy and paired with the sour cream...amazing!.

We ordered some of their signature house drinks and a bottle of wine. 

I have to give the food 5 stars. It was so nice to go to a place where the tapas wasn't pre-made and sitting under heat lamps getting greasy and dried out (*cough* Firefly *cough*). The food was not overly seasoned to cover up the lack of quality...like a lot of places do. The vegetables and fresh seasonings (scallions, parsley, etc.) served with each dish really complimented the home cooking and quality ingredients. 

The service was slow, but due to everything being fresh out of the oven, it was more than acceptable. Plus, in Euro culture, you take your time to eat and talk. Why is everyone in such a hurry?! We stayed here for over 4 hours listening to the live music and chatting away. It was a really nice atmosphere, and we all left happy.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,18,14,5,V1OJf1MBO96nahIMEmlrZg

4447905,2018-01-08,7,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I am unfamiliar with European cuisine so I was definitely in for a treat when I visited Forte! 

I first experienced this wonderful restaurant with one of MGM's executive chefs. He is a die hard foodie so I trusted his recommendation and was excited to explore a new type of food. We went with another friend and shared a variety of dishes and tapas:
 
- Stuffed Baby Squid
My favorite dish. Glazed/marinated in its own ink and served on a bed of herb rice. The squid came out room temperature but the rice was nice and warm! I would not recommend for picky eaters - only if you want to try something unique and are a fan of octopus/squid. I recall the texture being soft and not very chewy like squid can tend to be 

- Braised lamb
Tender lamb was paired with a light salad and mashed potatoes. The lamb was very flavorful/incredibly soft!

- Stroganoff Fries 
Delicious fries topped with beef stroganoff. So. Addicting. It was a great plate to share and the stroganoff ragu was excellently seasoned!

- Bread Boat
Freshly baked bread filled with tasty cheese, topped with a delicious egg that's cooked right into the top/middle of the bread. We heard this was a staple/must try and were not disappointed! We broke the egg into the bread and very much enjoyed this as an appetizer 

- Meat Grill Platter
A smorgasbord of meats served with a side of fries and white rice. The sausages were extremely salty (for someone who loves sodium) but it was neat to be able to taste various traditional European meats

I ordered the Ghost Rider IPA and our server brought out the glass bottle of beer with a sweet clay mug designed with Aztec patterns. I may or may not have been overly excited about how cool this mug looked.   

I remember the service being fantastic which only added to our awesome experience trying new dishes. I have not been back since my original visit but would definitely go back - most likely with someone familiar with the menu!",WJhQpdUHoFCtpU6gHFjVlQ,15,13,5,SuFWtrnsN5VlNl3-WFYJTQ

4484301,2011-01-15,7,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Upon entering Forte on my initial visit, my first thought was that it was very European. This wasn't just because it was dead at lunch, as most restaurants in Europe are, but also because of the eccentric decor, dark lounge-like feel, off-the-beaten-path location, and genuine hospitality. That, and the fully stocked bar featuring very cheap glasses of delicious European wines (this I would find out later).

I've over-ordered Forte at twice now, and though I can't say everything on the small plates menu is a winner, I can say I will keep coming back due to the aforementioned charming qualities and a few unique, inexpensive food highlights.

The menu is broken down by European country (mostly Eastern) and their corresponding regional specialties. Under Russia, you won't find any caviar or borscht, but you will find adjarkski kachapurri, which goes down the hatch more easily than it rolls off the tongue ($6.99). This consists of a freshly baked bread loaf akin to a short, fat French baquette, that is hollowed in the center and stuffed with cheese, butter, and a raw egg. If I lost you at 'raw egg' then let me elaborate. The egg is mixed in table-side and is cooked by the heat of the bread, turning the dish into a protein-filled vegetarian friendly dish that will change your mind about Russian food. The flavor of the crusty bread combined with the egg and cheese reminded me of a quiche, yet this was unlike anything I've ever had. Extra (yet unnecessary) points for that!

The section from Spain features a variety of chorizo sausages, amongst other items. We had the chistora and bilbao (each $2.50) which were fantastically charred and of fantastic value. These rivaled the Polish links at Costco as far as sausage bargains go, and were much better in my opinion.

One note selections included the chicken skewers ($3.25 each), sauteed shrimp ($6.50), and the Bulgarian shopski served in an adorable clay pot ($6.99). Though there are a few minor flops, the thing I love most about this place is that you can try a lot of different foods you've probably never heard of, and, if you don't like them, you haven't spent enough to regret having given them a whirl.

Coming back to the wine, I ordered a glass of Spanish Cosechero Blanco, which I was told cannot be found anywhere else in Vegas. Guess how much? $4.50!! The owner of the restaurant, who was our waitress on my second visit, and a gem in and of herself, offered to sell me a bottle at wholesale cost when I mentioned I liked it. So, I got a bottle for later that cost me just $8.20. That pretty much sealed the deal for me!

This is a place you have to be experimental and open-minded to go to, but if you appreciate other cultures and want to join me on my mission to support the mom and pops in Vegas, then you'll have no trouble mustering the strength to go to Forte.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,15,10,4,k4W6gIHTiEd8aR1rCSfqBA
4484523,2016-08-31,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"After reading an article about Forte in the newspaper, I checked the Yelp reviews.  Buoyed by those, mostly favorable, from my Yelp peeps, we had a go at it last night.  All I can say is ""Cada uno a su gusto,"" or for you gringos, to each his own.  My husband rated this a grudging two stars.  But I'm the reviewer, and I take his ratings solely under advisement.  My extra star is for the beautiful crockery and matching salt and pepper shakers, all available for purchase near the front.  No need to tell your mom the restaurant ""gifted"" you.

We arrived a little before 9 p.m., saw the sign ""Wait to be seated,"" so we waited.  And waited some more, until finally a server appeared an offered our choice of tables in the nearly-empty dining room.  

The cocktail menu was lengthy, but perplexingly, only one single item had a price.  I didn't order it, but what made that one special?  Instead, I had a glass of sangria, described as fruity, and with the addition of Armagnac.  I like it when sangria is kicked up with more than just wine.  In this case, the fruit consisted of a slice of lemon.  There was no sweetness whatsoever, and the brandy was undetectable.  In short, it was a mere glass of red wine.  And I don't drink red wine, unless it's sangria, which this wasn't.

The confusion continued.  I had seen the Yelp photos.  The heralded Thracian Clay Pot was not listed under the tapas menu, so I assumed that it would be a dish that we could share.  We wanted it without the sausage, and our server said she preferred it that way.  We also shared an order of Varenicki.

The Varenicki looked like a very small portion, but I suppose it was adequate, since there turned out to be eight of them.  They were pretty tasty.  But when the server presented the clay pot, we were gobsmacked by the itty-bitty size.  I couldn't tell from the pictures that it was going to be so small.  She told us to be careful, that when we got to the middle it would be very spicy.  It didn't take much to find the single hot pepper; I like spicy, but not the seeds that scorch my esophagus, so after I removed it the dish had no spice at all.  None.  The combination of the tomatoes, pepper, and egg was decent, but nothing I would rave about.  I've made this at home a million times, though in my skillet instead of a pretty clay pot.  We probably should have realized from the price that it was not going to be a main course.  We would have, if the menu hadn't been so confusing, and if our server had given us a heads-up.

After that less-than-Dionysian feast, we could have ordered more.  But after the long initial wait, the disappointment with the sangria and the clay pot, and the fact that the kitchen was about to close, we determined that the holes in our stomach would be better filled with a trip to Yogurtland, and we parted ways with the charmingly decorated, but unfulfilling Forte.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,5,3,12YXHK13GEGDr1KF_Srdhg

Everyone starts with house-made bread, the Bulgarian spice mix and olive oil.  The spice blend (15 herbs and spices) is for sale in cute jars for $6 each.  This is a great gift for friends or for yourself!  I have even used these spices to coat raw cashews (using coconut oil) which make for a great snack!

I have successfully shared the joy of Forte with friends, family, and other visitors alike, from vegetarian to carnivore.  Last night I learned that Forte could make Eric R. a fan of octopus, which he never enjoyed before.  My friends have really enjoyed the sausages made in house, but since I don't eat pork I am not able to tell you how they taste.

Dishes I have tried:
Shopska Salad: basic salad covered in shredded Bulgarian feta.  Tasty but simple.

Fetamelon Salad: special in spring 2014. Huge portion of watermelon squares, Bulgarian feta, mint, and chopped red onion.  Very refreshing but needs people for sharing!

Calamares Rellenos en su Tinto: Stuffed squid marinated in its own ink on Spanish herb rice. Room temperate squid, tasty and different.

Octopus in Olive Oil: super tender octopous on top of warm rice with green onions, served with lemon.  Truly outstanding though simple, converted a non-octopus eater.

Beef and Lamb Confit: beef and lamb that melts in the mouth cooked in its own juices and fat on top of the Uzbeki Plov rice - I ordered the rice dish separately once with a veg friend but just get it here.  The meat juices coat the rice, which has dried cranberry and cornichons.  Love this dish!

Adjarski Khachapurri: bread boat with cheese topped with raw egg at table that cooks on the bread because it is so hot.  This is very delicious but hard to split, so at most 2 people should share one or it loses the fun.  Sooooo delicious.

Thracian Clay Pot: Peppers, tomato, onion, feta, and egg baked together (with sausage typically but I ordered one without, no problem).  Served in a beautiful traditional pot, though all serveware is Bulgarian.  This is topped with a serrano pepper for some nice heat!

Stuffed grape leaves: meat-filled and served warm with a delicious dill yogurt sauce.  Dip the homemade bread in the sauce after the dolmas are gone!

Beef stroganoff ragu: wild mushroom dumplings topped with a beef strogranoff ragu is one of Eric R.'s faves (he loves stroganoff in general).  Very rich sauce.

Vareniki: my favorite simple housemade dumplings stuffed with potato, topped with fried diced onions.  So good it converted 2 non-potato eaters!

Biscuit cake: dessert for David S.'s birthday.  Honey biscuits, mascarpone, walnuts, chocolate - tasty!  I would rather eat more savory food than sweets though if I had the option! :)

There were nine of us tonight. Dinner was was not good but we were enjoying ourselves because of the company and the conversation. We ordered a bunch of tapas all of which were so salty it was hard to eat. The mash potatoes was nothing but a salt lick.

THE SAFETY  ZERO Stars
There is a step down in the restaurant that is invisible to someone walking towards the door. As a result one of my friends fell hard and landed on her hip on the floor. We went to  help her and knew that she was badly injured. Another patron called 911 and we stayed with her while she was on the floor. 

I asked to see the manager and a woman said she was the owner. Her first words to me were ,""there is a reason why we put signs there."" She said it so coldly that I could not believe she was only concerned about her liability and not my friends welfare. I was expecting ""Is your friend okay? Im so sorry she is hurt. How can I help?""

My friend lay there immobile and in severe pain while the whole restaurant acted as though nothing happened.  The ambulance came and my friend was rolled out of the restaurant in a gurney while the owner took pictures of her sign and another woman grinned 

The result a broken hip requiring emergency surgery all because of a dangerous step down!

We shared the Bulgarian Mixed Grille (Kiufte, Kebabche and Loukaniko), Adjarski Khachapurri..spelling?) and Thracian Clay pot.

Every single visit:
-Octopus with olive oil (on a bed of spanish herb rice)
-Biscuit cake (dessert)

Then I choose to mix it up with a few of the following items:
-Stuffed grape leaves (just so good. try this!)
-Thracian clay pot (order at the beginning b/c it takes about 20 min to bake)
-Hungarian goulash (mashed potatoes will never be the same)
-Beef and lamb confit
-Bulgarian easter lamb (meat tastes gamey, but that's expected for lamb but just be aware!)
-Beef stroganoff ragu (wow.. just wow)
-Vareniki (crust is perfect)
-Chicken shish kabob

1. It was hot and stuffy inside the restaurant so we asked our waitress if she could prop open a nearby door. The door was locked but it had a sign on it that read 'Must remain unlocked during business hours' so then our waitress just said 'no that door is locked' and even though we pointed at the sign, she made no attempt to fix the situation, it was pretty rude.

2. After we ate the hostess called us 2 cabs, but only one showed up, and since this restaurant is far off the strip, cabs are essential. So when we tried to go back into the restaurant to arrange another cab, it was locked! They locked us out!!! The restaurant wasn't supposed to close for another hour, sheesh, it was a cold night.

Anyways  ... on to the food:

The grill plate is outstanding, the sausages are dry and firmer that what you may be used to but they are full of flavor. The stroganoff was everyone's favorite, the dumplings were amazing and the sauce of delicious. The claypot was a big disappointment, all the ingredients individually were great but together they did not mesh well.  The egg bread is a must, not because it's so tasty but because it's a unique dish. Overall excellent food, reasonable prices, but sketchy service.",lIM5d1HsNmdkn9LzV8gKNw,0,1,3,VrDSM_6dJHXO5ijzQ9J95A

Both were incredible, with uniquely spiced meats with unusual, but pleasing flavors. I don't know what the names of things were, or which platter was which, but it didn't matter, because everything was excellent. Even the side of ""ketchup"" which was wonderful on its own.

The Shopska Salad, best I have ever had the pleasure to eat,  with Persian cucumber, tomato, sweet softened green pepper and Bulgarian feta - a classic and even though one is big enough to share , don't fool yourself you will finish the whole dish.  The stuffed peppers - words cannot describe. Guy Fieri got this one right!

5227807,2014-06-30,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I'd seen Forte a million times, its in the same strip mall as two of the stores I shop at frequently.  The other night, my fella and I took a walk up to La Bonita, and decided that we would have date night at Forte on Saturday night.

We arrived at about 9:00pm, and walked in, not really knowing if they were open or not, as there were two people out on their patio, but there wasn't an ""open"" sign or anything.

Luckily, they were still open, and the kitchen was working until 10 pm.  
We were seated, and one of the girls brought over two glasses and water...in an old vodka bottle!  How fun. 

We were given some bread with Bulgarian spices and olive oil...this was delicious. the bread was crispy on the outside, and super soft on the inside...I really need to learn to make bread like this!!

We chose:
Marcona Almond Stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon: These were tasty.  Granted, I was comparing them to the other tapas place that shall not be named and has been shut down, because THOSE were always amazing...I found these to be not quite on par, but still enjoyable.  

Gambas Al Ajillo: Shrimp sauteed with garlic, white wine and spanish olive oil.  This was good, but a little disappointing in the size.  $6.99 for 5 TINY shrimp.  Now, the flavor was good.  Really good actually...so good we took the bread and sopped up the ""sauce"" that was left over.  But...at $1.40 per shrimp, I want the shrimp to be a little bigger, even if there aren't as many.  I would have been fine with 4 larger shrimp, not even jumbo.  

Lamb Ragu served over polenta:  I wish I remembered all the details of this special (not on their regular menu)...there was this cheese that they served over it...oh my stars it was delicious. I'm picky about lamb, and this was cooked very well.  There were a few pieces that seemed a little fatty for my taste, but all in all, this was a good dish.  I enjoyed the polenta, never having had it before, and thought that it worked really well with the lamb and herbs.  A winner.

We also have a glass of refreshing sangria.  At $5 a glass or $23 for a pitcher, this was a good choice.  We only had a glass a piece, but I would definitely drink it again. 

Service was friendly, but a little slow.  It took a while for someone to come take our order, and to bring the check, but the food came out in a timely fashion, and we were really not in a hurry, so it wasn't awful.  I'd honestly like to either have the servers speak up just a touch, or turn the music down a little...it wasn't overly loud by any means, but one of the girls that was taking care of us was very soft spoken, so it was hard to hear her over the music.

I love the decor.  It fits very will with the name:  Forte, in musical terms, means ""loud or strong.""   The decor itself is very loud, and very artsy.  They also had a guitar player/singer who played some soft dining music while we were there.  That was fun.

All in all, I really enjoyed my visit to Forte.  I definitely plan to go back and try some more things from the menu, and maybe have a mojito next time!",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,2,1,4,v5eAOJItPsXKof3BfdgK-g
5238624,2014-08-13,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,My 2 favorite things were the stuffed grape leaves and the beef stroganoff.  Those were just simply delicous! Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Went in with my husband and his friends visiting from out of town and our 2 year old. The first impression was a cozy spot to hang out. Then we found out they had no highchairs. At all!  What a bummer! We almost left because of this and then realized we had his stroller in the car so that might work. I had a couple of their cocktails nothing really stood out. My husband and his friend had a bunch of different items. Everything I tasted was good. The only thing I wasn't really fond of was the stuffed dates. The sauce was a little too sweet and thick almost reminiscent of a balsamic glaze I felt that it also needed a crunch or crispness of some type.. it almost felt one note.

We were a group of six who met there on a Saturday at 2:00. The restaurant was not busy at all and we got seated right away. The server did not come for our order for about fifteen minutes. Once we ordered, the food came out quickly, even though I was told the clay pot took 25 minutes to make. The clay pot left a bit to be desired but the stroganoff and dumplings were excellent.  Chicken soup was okay, not great. The bread was fabulous. I think that was the best part of our meal. We had to ask for the check to be brought and the server never asked if we wanted anything other than water to drink, which was very odd.  Overall we were there for about an hour and a half, way too long for the small amount of food we ordered.  I doubt I'll be going back.",pmy2Y7CazBa3t_469KYAbw,0,0,3,QgsOAOmW_V5H_tCY2l5cMQ

Literally hidden by a gated patio in a strip-mall on Rainbow but featured in numerous publications as well as 'Diners, Dives, and Drive-Ins"" Forte European Tapas had been of interest to me even before moving to Las Vegas and recently opting to open its full menu for lunch a visit was planned - six persons cramming into a small high-top near the front door for a multi-course meal marred by hassled service and uneven culinary techniques throughout.  Small in size and kitsch in décor with heavy woods accented by posters, graffiti, and Christmas lights as American pop played overhead it was less than sixty-seconds after the final member of our party arrived that orders were requested and having twice deferred only to be given the first of two strainers of warm bread a somewhat rushed order was placed with a request for items to be appropriately paced - a concept that, along with beverage refills, proved as foreign as the food with the table soon overburdened and serviceware for sharing few and far between.  Opting for specials and staples from diverse regions including Spain, Greece, and nations of the former Soviet Union it was with oddly 'truffled' store-bought potato chips mixed with dry chorizo that our tasting began and rolling next into the duo of oily Chebureki and overcooked dates propped up by an outstanding sherry reduction it was with good fortune that the meal would soon improve, the tender whole squid restuffed with their tentacles and cooked in ink subtly sweet over aromatic rice.  Left precious seconds to digest and discuss a second wave of food soon smothered the table once more and finding far more success than round one both of the breads proved superlative with big flavor and a pleasant degree of grassy funk that I only wish had been present in the tender but flavorless lamb, a 'special' by title only and completely forgotten compared to the bombastic mélange of meat, cheese, and vegetal aromatics contained in the clay pot.  At this point sated but happy to finish with something sweet, two-parts each of baklava and biscuit cake rounded out the afternoon with the former benefitted not by lemon nor liberally applied simple syrup while the latter proved exquisite; a delicate balance of crunch and cream with mild sweetness harkening tiramisu but dressed up with honey and nuts that were perhaps stolen from the baklava and used here to better effect.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,4,3,OAmH6-iRN7belh6A-NKqaQ

5336801,2014-03-17,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"We originally discovered Forte on an episode of Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives featuring their Thracian Clay Pot-we immediately fell in love and make it ourselves almost weekly. If you haven't seen it...check it out their traditional Bulgarian dish here: http://www.barforte.com/ 

When we found ourselves in Vegas a few months later, we decided we needed to try it in person despite
a)being about a 20 minute drive from the strip
b) being located in a strip mall....not my ideal locale for a nice dinner. 

The two of us arrived without a reservation, which wasn't a problem at our time of arrival for a Saturday evening. There is a small outdoor fenced in patio area, but we opted to sit inside instead. The place is seriously cute. Great, cheeky décor, mismatched tables, clusters of seating, a bar area, fun wine cellar, chalkboard walls with specials, etc. We were brought fresh, warm, house baked bread in a turquoise colander with our menus. The bread is accompanied by their own spices and oils. Water is served in old fashioned vodka bottles with seriously awesome labeling. 

Our server was the absolute sweetest (and absolutely gorgeous!) and we put our Thracian Clay Pot order in right away-they take about 25-30 minutes. ($9.99 but we got it on some happy hour special for just $6!)

We ordered the stuffed sweet peppers to start-and WOW, we were surprised. They were delicious with the yogurt dill sauce and we scraped up the last of it with our warm bread. ($6.95)

We also tried the lamb lollipop fries ($9.99) which were a special for that night. The lamb chops were on a bed of amazing fries and gravy sauce. 

We tried the Pelmeni beef dumplings which were also good.

We had the Adjurski Khachapurri-the only thing I wouldn't give a 5 star. It is a bread dish in the shape of a boat stuffed with pickled Bulgarian cheese and topped with a cracked egg. This menu item is listed as ""finished table side"" although all she really did was break up the over easy egg and mix it. This was a good dish, but much more suitable for breakfast or brunch, rather than dinner. 

We tried traditional Bulgarian beer, Argentinian wine (Gascon!), and even the Moscow mule-house infused ginger vodka, limes, and ginger beer in a copper mug. One of my favorites!

The best part is that Forte is extremely affordable. For two people who ordered 5 items and 5 drinks total, our bill was around $60-unheard of!

Get off the strip and check this place out!
They open at 5 pm have live music starting around 8 pm.

5337633,2014-07-06,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"We had been here on two occasions and were ok with the experience and food.  Service was always slow they seemed under staffed but the flavors and food seemed worth the wait.  So much so, that we invited friends to join us for an early Saturday evening meal.  When we arrived the hostess was visibly upset we were there and said, ""You have reservation?""  We said no and that if there were fully booked that was ok we could go elsewhere.  We weren't upset just confused the place had only one couple sitting there and it was 4:30pm.  We assumed maybe they were expecting a large party.  The hostess asked another girl about seating us and both rolled their eyes and acted like they were doing us a favor finding a table.  No greeting, no customer service, just attitude.  It was disappointing.  I get it, it's a European feel and they were on the Food Channel, but don't let it go to your heads folks, this is Vegas and there are plenty of fish in the sea so to speak.  If this was all that occurred I would have been more generous with my rating but it got worse.  We ordered simple items, lentil soups and salads that took 45 - 60 minutes to arrive.  My only item, lentil soup came 30 minutes after everyone else was served.  When we asked the hostess who was now our waitress about the wait on the soup she said it was on its way then waited 20 more minutes.  The soup arrived and tasted ok but wasn't as good as previous times.  It tasted a little strange but after the wait I was starving.  Later on our way home I felt sick and spent the better part of the my night in the bathroom.  The entire time we were there the place never had more than a few tables of people, so we never figured out what the challenge was with seating our small group of 5.

If you alright waiting an excessive amount of time for simple food, being disrespected by staff who present as having a chip on their shoulder, and spending your night sick to your stomach, enjoy Forte; otherwise I would recommend many of the other dining establishments in our fair city that value one's patronage and health.

If this were my hot spot, I would be looking in to hiring staff that value customers and ensure my staff prepare and serve my food in a timely manner.  After your location is on TV people have a certain expectation for service and if that is not met because you fail to have a consistent deliverable your establishment will not remain viable in our market.",V2XFafPs2Ha7kgqW7zvJfA,5,1,1,lF0R6XcFnN36l5t9JInpHQ

However, the food was definantly good, the spices were unique and not bland. The interior decor grows on you as you sit back and look at all the newspaper and media clippings on the wall...feels authentic and almost makes you feel like your in another time and place. 
Service was good when we got service...however, i was surprised that they had one individual working the front (serving, ordering, hosting guests)...this caused some interesting service experience. 

For me (im from eastern europe), the food was good enough to surpass all the negatives about this place...i would definantly come back.",DInhlcOLiYB0p9SGA5b-Bg,1,0,4,BBwu70FRedgMcy1lKptvBw
5350689,2018-04-08,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"This place is a lot bigger than you think!  The decor is interesting, so see for yourself. Our waitress was great with drink recommendations and attentive.  We had a group of 6 people and ordered the Bulgarian mix, the spicy shrimp, olive oil octopus, two types of breads, and dates!  Everyone seemed pretty please with their cocktails, I ordered the gypsy milk, fruity flavor sorta reminds you of skittles.  It has a weird taste I can't pinpoint, but I drank it all and would order it again if I didn't have more to try on their menu.  One of my friends got the lemonade which was pretty darn good!  I would probably get it next time for myself.  The dates were amazing, they wrap them in bacon and carefully glazed.  I didn't have any of the bread dishes, but everyone liked it, some liked the flatbread more than the cheese filled bread.  The spicy shrimp was good, but it left a bit more to be desired.  I was expecting a bigger kick out of them, and it comes in a soup, not a dry dish.  In case anyone is wondering. The potato's in the Bulgarian dish were good, I personally didn't like the beans that much, and the sausage was a bit salty.  I would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't as salty.  The second meat it came with was definitely my favorite!  Great flavoring, though I'm not sure what it was lol. We ordered the forte forte garlic and herbs fries, was not happy with those.  It was missing flavor and not that crispy. I like my fries extra crispy, if not at least a bit more flavoring.  They were bland to me and I didn't taste enough ""herbs"" and ""garlic"". We also ordered the octopus which was a disappointment, it was barely touched.  I only enjoyed certain pieces of the octopus.  The rice it came with was yummy.  Hard to describe how they cooked the octopus, it wasn't chewy, so it wasn't over cooked, but it wasn't under cooked either. Like I said most of us were not a big fan of it. 

Pricing was fair, we spent about $170 here with most of us getting two cocktails for 6 ladies and a baby to share. They got a huge selection on their menu for food, I'm sure you will find something you'd like to try.",qIJ2iA9JwRYZD0akh1nyRA,0,0,4,CINF6r2nEA6GHh_rE2bf3w
5356577,2014-04-04,4,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"It all began 2 weeks ago, when dining at Forte for the 4th time.  We twice requested a change of music-- a loud, constant drone of a musician on the same note--but were told it can't happen because the owner makes the decision & she's not here.  The service that nite was spotty, despite their wait staff (as  usual) being in abundance.  And otherwise, the food was very good.

Since we had made plans w/friends for a 1st time at Forte, we four arrived at 6:30 on Sat. 7/20.  It was crowded & the same music was playing.  This time, despite plenty of wait staff (& owner present), we waited over one (1) hour, and so did most everyone there.  A customer setting up for her friend's B.D. party w/balloons, told me they had requested the food be ready when 25 arrived for this celebration & was upset that at 8:00 when they began arriving, it was nowhere in sight.

To make matters worse:  Forte was out of a favorite beer, out of meatballs & out of the Polish sausage platter w/potatoes.  One friend rec'd. the wrong tapa plate.  One friend's goulash had an amazing amount of salt & was not edible.  My partner never rec'd. his coffee.  The staff did not handle any of this with aplomb, and by 7:30 most of us were uncomfortable because it seemed the A/C wasn't working.

Due to our complaining, espec. the hungrier we became, Forte picked  up our tab.

5373007,2012-11-17,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Atmosphere, service, and taste add up to an experience that makes for a full dining experience. 

I was initially overwhelmed when I walked through the door. The space is plastered with posters of music artist, propaganda pieces, and a hodge podge of colorful artwork. The dimly lit room tames everything down, but also makes it look like a dive bar. The elongated dining area is spaced out with a total of maybe 10 tables. A few stools line the bar and a few tables are located in the front as well. During the winter months, those tables near the entrance will not be so enticing with the constant opening and closing of the door.

Our server, Elliot, was pleasant. Although he was taking care of the entire back area, he was able to control the pace. 

Our drinks took some time to come out, but with two people working the whole front of the house it is to be expected. The cocktails are not as balanced as I would like. I got the ginger lemonade and liked the spiciness of the ginger infused vodka. The citrus and sweetness was almost too much. It was as if all of these components were fighting for supremacy. 

The food was solid. The bread boat stuffed with cheese and a raw egg, adjarski khachapurri, was the it dish to try. The only thing we heard about from the tables around us was this dish was featured in Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. When Elliot presented it, we were impressed by how hot the content was. The center of the boat is hot enough to cook the egg when mixed with a fork. Tearing into this beauty with a light sprinkling of seasoning from the complementary bread was divine. Another dish worth trying is the beef and lamb confit served on a bed of rice. The starch is mixed with dried fruit, whole roasted garlic cloves, and herbs. We had also ordered the bacon wrapped dates because it is a staple when ordering tapas. Unfortunately they were not a hit. I did enjoy the sherry reduction. I ended up dipping the bread in it. Make sure to save room for the biscuit cake. It is prepared like a tiramisu and is ambrosial. I would scale back on the tapas to eat two of these.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,5,3,5,KEhxGjuTmdKw5QZ1407HHA

Cute small restaurant with bar area and outside seating, interesting artwork on the wall, and mismatched chairs adds to the charm.
Staff was helpful, the place was pretty empty so we got good attention.
Alot of us started with a Rose nectar juice vodka, it was light, and strong. We all sucked those down. A few others got sangria or wine.

We got complimentary bread with oil and vinegar, the bread was great, airy and chewy, crisp on the outside.
A  vegetarian friend got the Shopska Salad and she loved it, it was smothered in feta!
We got the Mixed Charcuterie Plate, which was different salami, pepperonis and such. Not worth the price.
The Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates, Wrapped In Bacon were Yummy with a capital Y!
We tried the Adjarski Khachapurri upon recommendations of a fellow Yelper, The bread was hot, it magically cooked the raw egg before our eyes. Delicious!
Beef Stroganoff over rice, I'm used to it with noodles but this version was okay, maybe a bit salty, but good.
Pelmeni, beef dumpling, it was okay, the meat was very peppery, which turned me off, very doughy but done nicely.
Blini W/Meat was good, a bit on the plain side.
Vareniki with Potato, reminded me of a pierogi, which I grew up on, very good rendition.
We dared to try the Stuffed Squid In Its Own Ink, it was good, tender, had a salty briney taste, I was pleasantly suprised.
The owner was nice enough to throw in complimentary pastries at the end. They were light twisted puff pastries with red jelly inside sprinkled with powdered sugar. Thank You! They were perfect.

5473108,2010-08-28,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"I've been wanting to try this place for a couple months, so when I got an email from restaurant.com advertising a $25 coupon for $2 it seemed like the perfect time to finally check it out.  The bf and I went on Friday night around 8pm and when we arrived there were a couple people at the bar, and that was it. Eating in empty restaurants makes me pretty uncomfortable, but we are always looking for places with a little character (and not part of a chain) so we wanted to give it a shot. After we sat down, the girl that was behind the bar came and took our drink order and gave us menus. There was no actual drink menu, which seemed strange for a place that supposedly has all kinds of infused vodkas and intl beers. Anyway, a couple more people trickled in and it seemed like they were all regulars. The bartender/waitress came back and took our order, but didn't write anything down and after I rattled off a few things she asked if we just wanted to start with that. Um, ok, but it's tapas and I'm hungry! There were a couple other things we had already decided on, but whatever. She did mention the portions of some of the things we ordered were small, which I expected from tapas, so we definitely wanted to order more. It's a pet peeve of mine when waiters don't write down orders--I'm sure some people really have fantastic memories, but 98% of the time I've had a waiter not write down an order it's gotten messed up in some way. This time was no exception. We were brought 2 different things that we hadn't ordered and had to remind her a couple of times what we had actually ordered. For a while it seemed like the girl was the only person working and since some of the people that had arrived after us were sitting out on the patio, she was a little all over the place and clearly needed help. A bit later another girl showed up (and FINALLY refilled my water) and things were slightly smoother after that. They were both really nice so I hate to complain, but they were just not on top of it. 

On to the food....first, we ordered a manchego, piquillo pepper toast which was ok, an eggplant dish that really needed bread or something since it was basically a dip (they did bring us bread when we asked for it), shrimp in garlic and olive oil and a Spanish tortilla. Everything had a bit too much oil (except the tortilla) and felt like it was just missing something. It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either. The tortilla was more like a frittata with potatoes than a traditional Spanish tortilla. We also ordered manchego on grilled toast (I looooove manchego cheese) and a pepper stuffed with feta--I think it was called burek on the menu. I didn't realize it was going to be battered and deep fried, so it wasn't exactly what I was expecting. The breading was a bit thick for my taste, but the melty feta inside was good. I wasn't really sure what to make of the creamy dill sauce it came with. It looked like it was going to be tzatziki, but it most certainly wasn't. Oh well. 

Since we had the certificate from restaurant.com our total bill (food, 2 beers and 1 cocktail) came to right about $30. That also included 18% gratuity (calculated on pre-discounted check per the certificate) so it was pretty reasonable. However, it bums me out when I use a certificate that requires gratuity to be automatically added and I receive shitty service. I think if we hadn't used a certificate and paid $55 for our meal I would've been more unsatisfied. I really want to give 2.5 stars, but I'll bump it up because I think this place has potential and I want them to succeed. I would try it again...but maybe just to have a couple drinks and a snack instead of a full dinner.",hHNO8Yk1ljB6Iaeb-Nl2RA,1,1,3,3KPUBwXKOUoO3BHN91srLw

Lisa R's terrific review finally persuaded us to check them out and we actually ran into her having dinner at one of the tables upfront!  It was fate :)

The vibe was really cool.  Definitely don't feel like you're in LV.  They had a one man band doing covers ranging from Depeche Mode to Nelly Furtado in a whole Casio keyboard meets karaoke with an eastern Europe flare that definitely enhanced the experience.

We surprisingly started with a complimentary order of the ""Marcona Almond Stuffed Dates"".  Apparently they made an extra plate by mistake and our waitress gave them to us on the house.  Most tapas joints execute a kind of stuffed date tapas well but the size of these dates were a lot bigger than normal and the jerez sherry reduction gave it a very unique flavor.  Thanks to the staff for that one.

Our favorite dish was the ""Calamares Rellenos en su Tinta"".  They were stuffed baby squids (squid in squid) that were marinated and served in their own ink on top of Spanish herb rice.  We were kind of surprised the squid was served cold but it actually worked with the hot rice.  100% getting a double order of this the next time since my lovely wife hogged most of it :P

The ""Thracian Clay Pot"" almost sounds like a nickname for a torture device in ""Game of Thrones"" but it was anything but that.  It's a Bulgarian specialty served piping hot served with veggies, sausage with a baked egg on top.  The broth was perfect for a chilly evening.  It defines comfort food.  Some might find the broth to be too sausagey but I was digging it.  We also had the ""Bulgarian Mixed Grill"" and both liked the kiufte best.  They could Americanize those babies and make them sliders! hahahaha 

We couldn't get enough of their table spice and put it on everything including the olive oil we dipped their amazing bread in.  I asked the server what the blend of spices were and she rattled off a whole list of things in it.  It was so good that I bought a bottle of their home blended spice before we left.

Their $20 bottles of wine rocked too!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,21,12,5,8szcdAc86OtA6E1pOXEIYg
5540589,2015-04-13,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"This is the place to come for cheap Mediterranean/eastern European food. Staff is friendly, ambiance is very cool and quirky. Good for groups, or date night. On weekends they have free live music which is nice and relaxing.

Their food is very Eastern European. Think Kabobs, goulash, and egg bread bowls. So it's really a mixture of typical dishes with new different ones. If you are from Bulgaria or Russia you will probably recognize a lot of the menu. 

My favorite things here are the strawberry cider beer, the egg and pickled cheese bread bowl and the biscuit cake. The cider is just so fresh and It seriously tastes like juice. Refreshing, delicious and low on calories. The pickled cheese and egg bread bowl sounds and looks weird I know but it is seriously amazing. The bread is freshly baked and you are in for a delicious treat with this. Weird but worth it. The biscuit cake is homemade and so delicious there are no other words. Just know on my day off I have driven all the way to forte just to take home some biscuit cake. So worth it.

I highly recommend Adjarski Khachapuri. I get this every single time. It is freshly baked bread with a pickled cheese & an egg in the middle. You're supposed to tear off a little piece of the bread & dip it in the egg. I've had this in many different restaurants. And, I really love theirs!

I really like their Mojitos too. The person I went with thought thought it had too much mint & lime. But, I thought it was perfect. Although, after you take a few sips, you can dilute it with water if you wish to do so.

Finally, I really recommend the biscuit cake. It's hard to describe it. It does resemble the Napoleon cake. If you ask me. The atmosphere is really nice too. And, they always play great music. Overall, I really love this place!",dEp7BNFhnjaMYWcJ_KqsyQ,1,2,5,3bnr1HqtK4tzGPaVAAFo1w

I also had the fries with feta cheese, the ham and cheese, and the bacon wrapped dates from the appetizer menu.  All of these items were delicious.  I wasn't sure that the feta and fries were going to work but they certainly did.  The bacon wrapped date was sweet but the meat flavor of the bacon really took the dish to a new level.  

I ordered the beef stroganoff and my husband ordered the dumplings.  Both were so full of flavor.  I really liked that the portion sizes were not overwhelming so I was able to taste a good amount of the items on the menu.  My mother order the goulash which comes on a bed of mashed potatoes - I will definitely be ordering this next time.  My father ordered the beef and lamb for $14! He said both meats were perfectly prepared - this was the only dish I did not try as he was at the other end of the table! Beyond that the price for the quality of food you get cannot be beat!  The only thing that people should be aware of is that the place is eastern European food and in true European fashion it takes a long time to get the food.  I suggest definitely ordering appetizers prior to your entree as it may take a while to get the food.  If you are needing to get in and out for dinner I don't know that this the place for that.  But if you are looking to shoot the breeze with friends and have a good time drinking and having excellent food, then this is the place for you! SOOOOO Awesome.

5868378,2012-12-16,1,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Had been trying to go to this place since seeing it on DDD, but every time I was in vegas I was unable to make it.  Its in a really weird spot.  Its in a strip mall between a cigarette store and a jewelery repair shop.  The windows are covered up.  Seriously, it looked like it was either closed or a store front for organized crime.  But when I walked in the door the difference is night and day, literally it's kinda dark.
Anyway I had the sausage combo.  I forgot what it was called. Possibly something with a lot of B's and K's.  Brokkfrughen or Krubbbrrnfffyka maybe; I don;t know.  But it was good.  It came with some navy beans and a sauce that I really enjoyed.  i believe it was made from pimentos or something.  Never the less it was delicious.
The service was kinda slow,  One lady seemed to be the bartender hostess and waitress.  I believe she was Russian.  Nyet,  Sorry thats the only Russian I know.  Wait.....Stolnichaya.  I know that too.

5892647,2011-03-27,0,8SwMaPL6AJIs1ZPSZ3NJ4w,"Okay, I feel like I have been doing a disservice to this establishment and to my fellow yelpers. It's been a minute since I've been to this place. However, here it is and I'm going to put it down for this place as best I can remember, and since I'm reverting back to my Vegas experiences, this place is definitely memorable. Let me tell you, asides from a Brazilian churrascaria, which is a whole category in itself  in which I will eventually have to review  at a later date,  places like this really make it hard to stick to a raw/vegan diet !

      Now, I'll have to disclose, that if you are adventurous, and you like to try new foods and being out of your comfort zone, then this is the place for you. It was like an adventure. 

      Location: Away from the strip, there are a lot of strip malls. This restaurant is in one, and you have to look closely because if no one is outside on the patio, then it appears that it's closed. Don't be fooled, just be open and trust that this place won't disappoint.

      Decor: a hodgepodge of segunda (second-hand) furniture mixed with a touch of ""Design within Reach."" 

     Ambiance: Riveting, yet intriguing. It gives you a feeling of ambivalence because you're not sure what to expect, especially when you get the menu. At least that's the way I felt, but things changes when the food was presented, then consumed. 

   It was my second time in Vegas as an adult. I was able to drink and enjoy all the pleasures of Vegas as an adult, and it was the first time I was actually taken to a local spot by a local, my bro. Personally, I like Vegas for the buffets, but now, this place gives me more of an incentive.

     Food: Here at Forte they offer a more eclectic European tapas from Germany, France, Russia, Italy, and Mediterranean  in addition to some staple Spanish ones.  They also offer Spanish style sandwiches such as Jamon & Quesa Bocadillo, pizzas such as Lox and Red caviar , different soups such as your classic  Russian Borsht, and salads such as Shopska which is a Bulgarian salad containing tomato, cucumber, green onion, roasted red peppers,topped with imported Bulgarian feta. Unfortunately, I don't have much more of description of the other tapas that we ordered since I waited so long to review, but this place was without a shadow of a doubt a place that needed props being that there are so few reviews. Due to hard times,  I know there are leery restaurant goers, however,  this place left such a great impression on me that I still had to bring  awareness the wonderful experience that I had here.  

       Anyways,  with all the countries that I have mentioned, you can imagine the layers of flavors and textures that this restaurant works with offering a cornucopia of European cuisines. One of my most memorable tapas, which I do not remember the name of, was a German dish. It was a beef stew loaded with onions. German food if you are not familiar, is hearty feel-good food, tasty, and filling. This was all of that and more. Could have had another dish of this, but if I did, wouldn't have had any more room to taste the other delicious dishes that we ordered. Everything ..... well, all I have to say is by the time we were done, the plates were licked clean.

     Great place to experience foods not usually offered at those trendy, expensive restaurants on ""the strip,"" good for sharing, great international wine selection, service is very hospitable, and food and wine priced  very affordable. You will will leave feeling ""completely"" satisfied and with a broader food repertoire. With this kind of place, it enables people to appreciate different foods that we are missing out on unless you are an avid  world traveler. 

      Be daring, try new food, appreciate the global  fares Forte European Tapas Bar & Bistro offers, and most of all,

The place is dark and cozy and the service is pretty nice. But the food was terrible. Absolutely godawful. 

We ordered the stroganoff on fries. The fries were great but the stroganoff was with ground beef and had a really thin broth like sauce which they had been very stingy with. Stroganoff usually comes with a creamy sauce and I thought they fries were gonna be covered with them but nah. Still this was the least terrible, can I say that? I don't want to say the best. 

We ordered some sort of dumpling that came looking like a Pirozhki. The crust was nearly burnt, super crunchy and inside was just a very firm and rubbery meetball, no sauce, no seasoning, nothing. 

We ordered the Lamb chop lollipop and we got two really big lamb chops, barely seasoned, the texture was all wrong. 

We ordered the shrimp in garlic sauce. We got 5 pieces of hard rubbery shrimp, swimming in a sour lemon sauce. 

Even though the dishes were very very small, we didn't finish a single one. We didn't finish the shrimp, the second dumpling was left untouched, the lamb chops we're left, the only thing we ate we're the fries. Never again!!",TG0bhYjtbRWrhZyqwpaW9A,10,6,1,P2gqEzAYpsMUkkRhk3nsxw

The seating we chose wasn't the best, since the chairs weren't comfortable and the table too high. What we won't sacrifice for good lighting for our food pictures. 

With a semi-large group of diners, we were able to sample a good number of menu items. We started with the house pita bread, which I didn't love. A little on the doughy side for my taste. We decided on a good sampling from the options on the menu and waited with anticipation. 

As others have noted, the timing of our food didn't come out as spaced out as we would have liked and refills came only after a few reminders, I still enjoyed quite a bit about our meal here. 

My favorites from lunch were the Calamares rellenos en su tinta, Thracian clay pot, sofiiska baniza, Chebureki and Adjarski khachapurri. I would return for any of these menu items in a heartbeat. My least favorite parts of the meal were the sugary sweet and drippy baklava, the overcooked and overly sweet almond stuffed dates and uninventive and incrediby generic-tasting Spanish chorizo chips. The Bulgarian lamb was just ok, I can't see myself ordering this again and the biscuit cake, although a favorite at our table was a little too dense and sweet-tasting for my particular palate. 

I was on the fence on how many stars to give Forte, debating between 3 and 4 stars.
