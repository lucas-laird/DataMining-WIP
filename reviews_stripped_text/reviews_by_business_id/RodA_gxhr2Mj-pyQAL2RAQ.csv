23422,2016-02-17,1,RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ,"Salute replaced the previous Italian restaurant at Red Rock Casino and is definitely an upgrade. The interior is nicely redone, creating a space that feels much more open and welcoming. They even have patio seating now, and an outdoor entrance that allows you to bypass the gross smoke cloud that lingers inside casinos.

For starters the person I was with ordered the chopped salad and I ordered the special of the beet salad. We both found them delicious and almost cleared our plates. For the main entree I ordered their special a la vodka fettuccini which is prepared tableside. What a presentation! Cooked in front of you inside a hollowed out Parmesan wheel, it is an innovative and new table side preparation I had never seen or come across before. Some of the Parmesan wheel melts into the pasta as it cooks giving it great flavor, and the fire gets hot when the vodka is added ;) I choose to add shrimp to the dish instead of the suggested meatballs and was not disappointed. My dining partner had the capellini which was good, but he found to lack a bit in flavor. He added some grated parmesan and red pepper flakes which seemed to suffice, but it isn't great when you have to add things to your food to make it flavorful, which is why it only gets 3 stars. The portions were good size as well, and we both ended up taking home our leftovers.

Lastly, the service was excellent. The wait staff was extremely attentive and helpful with questions about the menu. I especially enjoyed the sense of humor of the gentleman who made the pasta table side who was ""filling in for the authentic Italian guy dressed nicely who normally does this, but everyone has a night off."" The wait staff gets 5 stars!",HusmCtf8S4Q-xU2FXxn8oA,2,1,3,9LIx1MOvSG_CI2Q7EFngZQ

I normally don't write reviews but I think this restaurant needs better recognition. I stopped one day at red rock casino with my good friend after we came down from mountains. He was just visiting so I wanted to show him a nice resort. We like Italian food so we decided to try Salute restaurant...it was Monday...we got lucky :) It was Martini Monday so we started with vodka martinis for only $5...if I remember it was Sky vodka what's not bad for the price, right? Then we switched to glass of good wine. They offer nice wine selection. I ordered a glass of wine Gaja from Italy for my main course and they extracted it by the needle from the btl. so the air won't get inside the btl. how unique...now we are able to taste better wines by the glass. We started we appetizers something what would go nice with the martinis. Caprese and beef carpaccio. Great start, both were delicious. And we got fresh bread after we ordered. My main course was veal chop cooked medium with prosciutto sage crema, wild mushrooms and roasted sunchoaks (sunflower roots). My friends dish was the truffle ravioli with foie gras crema. We both loved it very much and for sure I am coming back by myself or with friends. Our server was very attentive and we felt very welcome. The bar and restaurant look is very modern with open kitchen. I can not wait when they will open the patio part by water for nice outdoor exercise.

To add insult to injury our waiter was lazy.  After waiting 20 minutes for another drink which he never brought, he came asking if we wanted to order desserts.  I don't recall that he even apologized for not bringing the drink.  He just said I can bring you a drink now.  I can deal with things like this on an ordinary night out, but on Mother's Day NO.

203341,2016-11-28,1,RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ,"***Beautiful inside, good service, questionable management, overpriced lackluster food***
We chose this place as I've been wanting to try it for classy Itallian food. 
 As walk-ins we were told they prefer reservations from the man in a suit at the hostess stand and was told by the seating hostess again that they prefer reservations because of something about wanting your name? And they took our name before seating.....uh why? We started with cocktails. My blood orange spritzer was incredibly bitter. My husbands drink was mostly frozen (we didn't realize it had homemade Italian ice in it which was slightly troubling later on when we were picking out pieces of lemon rind from our mouths) but was tastey and had a smoother kick. I switched to ordering this drink instead of the spritzer after the first round. 
Appetizer was arancini with bolognese sauce. The rice was a large grain rice and was undercooked. Sauce was very greasy and meat wasn't very good. I didn't even finish one. Hubby ate most just because he was hungry. I ordered a filet mignon for my entree- I asked for it medium and butterflied. The waiter had to ask if they were able to butterfly my steak. Strange! My steak came out hideous and unevenly cooked. Flipped it over and it was obvious the filet was cooked whole til done, then cut not correctly in half and pressed down causing a weird sort of creased paper effect so the steak didn't lie flat and was very overcooked and was a different doneness almost every bite. Also, by far the fattiest filet mignon I've ever seen. Came with an arugula salad, cherry tomatoes, and balsamic glaze which was awful and overpowering on the steak and the salad was incredibly salty. 
My husbands salmon was dried out and fishy in the middle- not fresh obviously. The risotto was also bland, dried out, and rice pastey/chewy he reported. **We ordered an extra side of crispy red potatoes- those were AMAZING**
As for staff: our waiter first came off very patronizing but he was in actuality very friendly and helpful. Table was cleared promptly, drink refills a plenty and lots of random staffers checking up on us. Thumbs up on service! They were also very kind to us when we accidentally signed the receipt without giving them the payment and walked out. They quickly caught up to us and we rectified the situation apologizing profusely which they insisted was no big deal.",gxTIOq4i9WsKfE0DGiNhjw,0,0,2,n7Yx1-_5iDAt0pVs7MDMhw

Our server was delightful and attentive throughout. Cocktails were good and reasonably priced.
So that's the good part.
Appetizers, Arancina was cold and tasteless. Crispy Calamari was not crispy. We were delivered a little pizza that we didn't order.
Caesar salad was good, We asked for anchovies on the side and for four diners, received four slivers.
And then the bread came?
Entrees. The flaming vodka was nicely presented but the gentleman pushed the cart away from the table so we didn't see 'the show'. Truffle pasta was so bland and veal dish, well I won't go there.
Here's the point. There was no seasoning at all. No herbs, no salt, no pepper. Just dollops of unseasoned and characterless food.

380507,2016-06-23,0,RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ,"I love this place!  The restaurant in this space previously always felt like an overpriced, pretentious, trying too hard Italian ""Cucina"" but following the redesign and reopening as Salute I think the overall ambiance and environment much more closely aligns to the feel of the rest of Red Rock and the location is much more suited to the demographic of people who didn't necessarily seem to latch on to the prior white tablecloth formality.  Not to say that Salute isn't a nice place, but it isn't rigidly formal.  I find myself often sneaking away from the slots or more costly offerings at the casino to wander to the back of the establishment and people watch at the bar.  The service has always been impeccable, and the young lady behind the bar on my most recent visits, Chelsey, exemplifies what I hope to find anytime I am out enjoying myself; attentive but never overbearing, knowledgeable enough to make recommendations and clearly communicate menu items, but without the condescension or brow beating up sell found so often in Vegas.  And while I am perhaps too enamored with the overall flavor of the experience, I can also unequivocally make the case for the spinach lasagna as the perfect indulgence to complement the experience and to ensure an enjoyable afternoon.",vPvhkOkRrJWdUbMsFxzkJg,0,0,5,Q_B6dgbZDA1JnXvgNxgvtA

Our server (Michelle) was very friendly and steered us to some great choices. The Antipasto starter had lots of great little bites and was perfect for sharing. My wife is still raving about her Caprese salad. I've never had a Saltimboca done the way they do it, with the bone in and pounded thin instead of rolled up. I'm a convert. It was great. My wife loved her Lasagna. The donuts we had for dessert (Zeppolis, I think) we're a great end to a great meal. Thanks again Michelle.

Food was very slow to come out but the executive table's food just kept coming out. Someone constantly was keeping an eye on them but we felt very neglected as we continued to wait patiently. Also, it doesn't hurt for the managers to greet clients. Never did anyone else other than the waiter greet or said goodbye or even check on our table.

It was either bland or too spicy. I don't know if they have a rogue cook (see the other unhappy reviews)back there or it was just an off night but with that and the poor service we won't be back. Adding to that was the long wait for our courses, I understand not rushing but you have to go at the natural pace of the table. We were buying wine so it felt like they were taking longer so we would have to order additional bottles.

The four of us checked in at the hostess stand at 7:33pm & were seated at 7:45pm. We were literally at our table for 20 minutes, BEFORE ANYONE greeted us!! What an umbrage that was. 

My husband had to flag one of the staff members to assist our table.  Nine more minutes passed, before a female server (FS) showed up at our table; totally callous about our long-wait (she was amicable, albeit unapologetic). The FS took our cocktail order; and forewarned us about the diminutive serving size of the pasta entrees. And she was correct, since we ordered the ""Table Side"" pasta w/ Vodka sauce and meatballs; and the serving portion was deplorable for $22.00! The FS proclaimed to our table that she will make sure to have the kitchen put four fried zucchini flowers for our appetizer & when the appetizer came out, it only had three flowers! 

In summary, Salute was overpriced with immensely slow and disorganized service.  The decor was elegant, modern, and the kitchen whips up delicious foods. The Assistant General Manager (AGM) - Anna Golden apologized to our table & took off two cocktails from our bill; and gave us complimentary dessert platter (7 types of desserts) at the end of our evening.

I was regular at Terra Rosa before the remodel...and was really looking forward to a fresh new face on good bones. Sadly, they only thing that is well done is the interior design. Its beautiful and chic but ends there. My first attempt was ""grand"" opening weekend, Sat. around 8-9.. headed in for a long awaited plate of pasta, and the sour faced host says they are no longer serving food and over capacity..???? huh? the place is half empty. Id just like to sit at the bar and have some pasta....uh no ""thats not gonna happen"" we're done for tonight come back tomm.... wow you dont have ONE plate of food left on opening weekend?...no apologies, not even a glass of wine, nothing. Strike 1. So I waited a few weeks for them to get it together and tried again. 1 Linguine Vongole, zucchini flowers, tiramisu desert, and $50 later, Im terribly terribly disappointed. All are not only my fave italian dishes but staples of the cuisine and should be served to perfection in a place with all these bells and whistles. 

The Bad and the Ugly:

Linguine tastes like it came out of a sodium filled can.
Clams were the smallest I have ever even seen in my life. (caper sized, literally)
Zucchini flowers overstuffed with ricotta left nothing of the actual flower
Tiramisu was nothing but sweet, over sweet cream. I only ate half 
And lastly but not least the bread.....EPIC failure. Italian bread is art and this was play-doh. Just a sad dinner roll away from wonderbread. 

The people next to me at the bar were equally disappointed in their vodka pasta served over a flame, stating it tasted like rubbing alcohol and sent it back. 

Overall this place should shut the kitchen down and reevaluate. BOOOOOOOO!",VgrHqQfQyiri-heodvqHBg,6,0,1,AqZHoMKponF7Yf2v47kQ0g

For an entree, I shared the Rigatoni Salsiccia.  It was a large portion so glad I did.

You do, however, pay for the ambiance in the price of the food. The food is good, but leaves more to be desired in terms of flavor. My boyfriend and I split the signature pasta and margherita pizza. The margherita was baked well, and the pizza sauce was light but not overbearing. It is a modern style of pizza with no added on tomatoes, but only shredded basil. 

The signature pasta's creation process has a huge wow factor - the staff bring over a huge cheese wheel wherein ignited vodka is used to melt the cheese before coating the pasta noodles. For an additional fee, you can choose to add your choice of protein. But at $26, I felt that this pasta was overpriced because the portion was quite small. 

The best part about the visit was definitely the house bread and butter, and the service. The butter is slightly sweet and adds so much flavor!

1528554,2015-10-30,3,RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ,"We came here for a convenient dinner. We were going to go across the street, but I checked out the menu of this place and decided to try it out and everyone else agreed too. I guess I remembered loving Red Rocks last Italian restaurant so I thought this place should be just as good. The place is really fancy. I guess I didn't really pay attention to the prices when I was checking this place out. We were a bit underdressed, but I thought that if this place is expensive their food must be good. This being Vegas, that's not always true. 

The service was good, our glasses were always full and our waiter was nice and helpful. To start we got a big antipasto plate and I ordered the prosciutto with burrata cheese because I love burrata cheese. Some freshly baked sesame bread came to our table first. It was hot to the touch, the crust was a light brown and it was covered in sesame seeds. I tried a piece only because my Mom said it was really good. Their bread is fresh with a soft and light center. It went great with the olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Our appetizers came fast which was to be expected because nothing was really cooked. The antipasto was alright. The parmesan cheese was served in huge hunks which made it weird to eat, like no one eats parmesan that way. It's too rich to eat in big chunks like that. The mozzarella balls were flavorless, needed some seasoning. The ricotta and basil wrapped in zucchini needed to be served a little warmer, cold ricotta is just really gritty and no good. The olives, prosciutto and peppers on the plate was good though. The burrata was watery and bland which was disappointing because I was looking forward to it. I liked the thick and sweet balsamic that was served with it though. It was tangy and sweet, great on the prosciutto and freshly baked bread. 

Next came salad which only a couple people ordered. I tried some of my Aunts caprese salad that was served kind of weird. The plate had only a few small tomatoes and a huge portion of mozzarella, not very balanced. She just gave me some of the cheese. It was kinda gross, I had trouble getting it down. First of all it looked weird, it had like small black specks in it, which is highly unusual. The cheese was spongy, soggy and flavorless, bleh. There is just something wrong with the cheese here, which is really sad considering it's an Italian place. 

Our final dish of the night and best dish of the night was their veal marsala. My Mom and I split it. It was plated very elegantly with edible flowers. It was a small portion, but it was split and we weren't too hungry so it was perfect for the both of us. The veal was delicate, yet had a good bite. The marsala was excellent with whole pieces of mini mushrooms. It was a bit on the salty side though. Needed some water after eating that dish. My Dad got the seafood risotto that he was very disappointed in. I tried it, the seafood was good, but the rice was undercooked. My Aunt got the salt baked branzino and was also disappointed in her fish, she said it was bland. I tried it and actually liked it, thought it was cooked very well, but I could see how it could get bland if that's all you had to eat. I felt kinda bad that not everyone was exactly happy with their meal because I chose the place. 


This place was way to expensive for the food we got, it wasn't good enough, not worth it. Just an overrated and over priced Las Vegas restaurant.",H_KCkMeFblrh_owAYU9GmQ,6,4,3,acF3anSH24Y4WgIEzc8_dg

I inquired if bread that was brought to the table was sour dough and he said yes. Then server came by and said no it's just a sesame seed bread but definitely not spur dough. Well turns out it was sour dough. So staff wasn't clear on what they were serving. To me this either shows lack of knowledge on wait staff or on management's part for not informing them properly. Secondly, I ordered the Pappardelle Alla Bolognese and pasta was in my opinion tough. My husband ordered Veal Marsala and veal was well over cooked. Not tender as described in other reviews.

I had a nice little table in front of the antipasti station and enjoyed watching the two working behind the antipasti station.  They were very nice and explained the different antipasti dishes and desserts before we were seated.  Unfortunately, that was the extent of the enjoyment before the mayhem started!!  A short black lady was yelling at a server at the antipasti station to ""move"" so she could get in.  It wasn't like there was a fire or emergency.  She could have been more professional but I could hear her complaining about the ""mother-f***ker"" that he needs to move and she doesn't need a lesson on how to talk to people.  This is unacceptable behavior!!  She was in such a frenzy, pushing the two workers out of her way.  The two behind the bar appeared very uncomfortable and quite frankly I felt embarrassed for them.  Then a chef came out drilling the young man to ""go faster, faster...how long does it take to make this...give it to me now"".  Not sure what the young man was making but it looked like he was going pretty fast mixing the stuff in the bowl.  I proceeded to walk out but wanted to speak to a manager first.  The lady I was told was the manager appeared at the antipasti station and began demanding desserts and had that ""b1tch"" face when speaking to the two workers.  Where is the professionalism from these people?  I have no idea how the food taste.  I left without speaking to the management in fear they may bark at me.

Reading the not so great reviews I should have known better but when a business has 3 stars you just never know as it can go both ways. In this case we were highly disappointed. 

Let's begin with the positives. The restaurant is beautiful but doesn't remotely feel Italian but it's very nicely laid out so walking in you're naturally optimistic. The service was great as well and as the food kept coming out it was pretty much one miss after another.

We started with the fried zucchini flowers that were bland & heavy, awful starter that set the mood. Before we were finished with them, out came our Caesar salads and it was the worst thing we tasted during this meal. The salad didn't taste like anything, it was as bland as it gets. Next came out the margherita pizza and again before we were finished with the salads which I couldn't even finish. The pizza was actually really good and is the only thing I would order again. The dough was airy & thin and everything paired very well. Lastly we had the signature pasta that comes out heated & tossed in a Parmesan wheel which was very cool to watch BUT what ended up being served to us unfortunately didn't taste great. Everything was one noted ~ bitter. The meatballs were bland and when the bill came at just over $80 it was hands down the worst $80 ever spent. 

Beyond disappointed & wont be back.",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,39,31,2,NiN92VNB4q7eOMqQ0PT38g

We started at the bar and I asked about the house wines.  They were from a keg and the bartender suggested I order a glass if I was not used to keg wine, but I was welcome to try it. I declined. The ladies next to us asked if their house wine was Italian. No, it was not. One you are an Italian restaurant and supposedly ""upscale"", keg wine is not allowed. Two you are an Italian restaurant and supposedly ""upscale"", Italian house wine is a must. Three your house white is Reisling and when poured looked like it was full of effervescents (bubbles).  That should have been strike 3 we are out of there, but we continued on. I ordered a Rose (I know not Italian at all, but their wine list was not very impressive and not very ""Italian""), they were out. I settled on white that I had never heard of before.

The salmon carpaccio was good, but cut way too thin. Thin as in it broke into a billion little pieces as you tried to get it off the plate.

Great location, pretty restaurant, but I found the food to be bland and nothing special and the service was inattentive and slow. The table side signature pasta sounded amazing but our group found it to be particularly bland and flavorless. Another low note was the baked rigatoni.  I think the problem with this dish is that we had just recently had the same dish at Nora's. It was so outstanding at Nora's and this version just didn't even come close to being as good. On the plus side, we got 3 different salads and I thought they were all very good. Our server was nice enough but we barely saw him and the gap between finishing our dinner and ordering dessert was way too long.

Four of us went to celebrate my Birthday, recent status change, and extended visit to town. The restaurant is beautiful, everyone was gracious, and service was on point. 

The food just underwhelmed three of us, aside from housemade pastas, nothing seemed to say ""I must come back for this!"" And, quite honestly, if we had paid for the meal, we would have sent the appetizers back. 

Dad really enjoyed the lasagna; Scott liked the gnocchi a great deal; and Mom's Carbonara was spot on; I had the House Special Linguini made tableside in Reggiano wheel: it was good, I love fresh pasta, am a turophile, and kvell for a flambèed dish, but it was a little one-note for me. The appetizers were awful: stuffed zucchini blossoms and arrancini, just not well prepared not at all tasty, and these are dishes I grew up eating. Three of us had the whole salt crusted baked branzino and it was flavorful, the Chicken Piccata reported to be very good, broccolini side was fine. 

The best part of the meal for me, was the cake they sent for dessert, and a nice Barolo we shared in the lovely dining room. Again, had we paid for this meal, it would have been very disappointing, and it would probably be bordering a 2* review, except service was truly amazing. But you can't eat service and atmosphere. 

When we staycationed recently at Red Rock, the same friend offered to make arrangements for Scott's extended family to join us for dinner here; I politely declined her generous invitation. I have neither plans nor a desire to return.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,12,6,3,09CgU9FhSNoLxVvNi8GKZQ

This restaurant is another product of the impeccable ""customer service first"" methodology that was behind the Light Group now under the moniker Clique Hospitality.  Andy Masi and Brian Massie put together another home run filled with delicate pasta, flavor bombs in the form of sauce/gravy, tender meat offerings and mouth watering cocktails to wash it all down.  We've dined here multiple times although personally I've never changed my entree (since it's that good).  The service has always been spot on with just the right amount of floor presence by the AGM and GM each time we've visited.  Our meal always starts the same way, an order of ""That's Amore"" (bulleith, aperol, lemon, basil) with a ""Campania Sour"" (50 bleu vodka, liquore strega, citrus, egg whites, lavender bitters) for the wife.  Our appetizer selection is typically the Meatball due to the soak-it-up-with-bread marina that remains once the abundant portion of meat is ingested.  For our entree, I always order the Veal Milanese ""Saltinbocca"" (veal chop, fontina chesse, speck, crispy sage) since it can feed 2 people but mostly because it tastes fantastic the next day as well.  I literally crave this dish.  My wife has ordered various items, the best being the Salute Signature Pasta followed by the Pappardelle Bolognese and the Lasagna (who doesn't like bechamel?).  Overall, I can't wait to go back and love that Red Rock has some serious eats to offer the local population.

The hostess offered us a table right by the entrance but there was too much foot traffic around there so we asked for a booth. She responded with a very off putting and disingenuous smile and response, ""then it'll be another 15 minutes until we can get you seated.""

The food is ok at best. You can go to downtown Summerlin and have much better Italian food at Grape Vine or Tratorria Regiano for half the price.

The service is highly unorganized; you can just take a look at neighboring tables around you as waiters scramble to put silverware on a table while the bus boy stands there with 5 hot entrees in hand, ready to serve people their dinner.

They poured water all over the table when filling up glasses of water and took quite a while to bring out a side of pasta when I found out the  Ciopino I ordered came without any. Basically they brought it out once we had finished our dinner.

Oh and this place is very noisy, it reminds me of a high school cafeteria. Not a great place for an intimate dinner. We won't be coming back here again.",mEQICE5wX2JOP8vcsMjNig,0,0,1,f-VQjB6_W1UADsHP7nfTHg

Started with a very nice array of breads, then the caesar, it was OK. Hubby had the grilled filet medium (delivered rare) sent back to re-fire, 2nd time delivered med-well, I had ""Handcrafted pasta""  with shrimp (scialatiella) tomatoes were mush & the shrimp were so over cooked they were inedible. Since we had already sent the steak back for re-fire I didn't want to send back the pasta, but did mention it to the waiter. Nothing was done about it, no apology, no credit, nothing.

Signature pasta 4.5/5 is a must for the table, especially with the presentation. I had an opportunity to taste my friends meatballs and those were a hit. I would definitely order that next time. I ordered the sea bass grilled 3.5/5. I knew it wasn't going to be earth scattering but it was above average and I was happy with this healthier option.  Two ways to be prepared grilled or baked in sea salt.  My friend had the sea salt and it tasted very moist. My husband ordered the veal Milanese...yum yum 5/5 and it was a huge portion great flavor! Bread 3.5/5 warm and soft inside just not a huge fan of sesames. We shared some dessert platter 4.5/5 that included caprese pie and tiramisu were my favorites.

We found ourselves ignored, our glasses empty, weren't offered bread and weren't sold on any dishes and a simple task as receiving our check took about 15 plus minutes.

2894445,2015-09-27,1,RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ,"I've got to believe that my rating will improve over time, because my only reason for a 3 vs 4 star rating is the slow service.  After soft openings, and 2 weeks of being open to the public, the servers and kitchen should have their issues ironed out by now.  We had dinner reservations at 7:30, and by 8:45 we were still waiting on our dinner salads and drink refills; dinner entrees showed up around 9:15.   When we arrived the main restaurant was not busy at all, nor was the bar (moderately) or outdoor patio area.  I'd say during our entire evening there, on a Saturday night, the entire place never was more than 1/2 full.  So being ""too busy"" couldn't have been the issue with the slow service.  Our servers were all very nice although we had to remind them to bring us drink refills, and our food various times throughout the evening.  It started off well, with drink orders and appetizers served right away, but then it just deteriorated.

The food however, wow!  We ordered the burrata plate and the arancini as appetizers and both were very flavorful and fresh.  The bolognese sauce that comes with the arancini reminded me so much of my mother's, very meaty, tangy, rich flavors.  Yummo!  My hubby and I both split a caesar salad, which was also quite good, but just your basic caesar salad.  My hubs ordered the seafood risotto as his main entree, and he said it was just ""ok"".  I had their Signature Pasta dish, with meatballs and I'm telling you it was amazing!  It's creamy, and everything wonderful that pasta a la vodka should be.  The only complaint is that, although it's supposed to be prepared table side, and provide you with a visual experience as the chef prepares the pasta and sauce inside a giant wheel of parmesan, my order was NOT prepared table side.  Even though, after we reminded the waiter we were still waiting on our main entrees, I was told the chef would be out shortly to prepare my signature dish.  No chef.  No table side fun.

The atmosphere in here is inviting, and nice.  There's niches where you don't feel like you're on top of your neighbors, and yet there's also areas where you're more out in the open.  The bar provides a nice area to sit and have a drink, chat and/or watch a game or two.  And the outdoor seating is adorable.

In all, we will definitely go back as the food and atmosphere redeemed the lack of faster service.  Not sure what the issue was, and I see from previous reviews service has been its main issue thus far.  Everyone was quite friendly, and apologized profusely for the slow service.  Now let's just see if they can get it rectified.  It's harder to fix bad food than slow service, and the food ain't the problem.",5xrHnV-8-TotHbT-dq21WA,3,1,3,AESmBFwgZ4a1ut3Qpbt32g

I always try to give a new place about a month or so to work out all the bugs, bad servers, etc.  It was worth the wait, because it was fantastic!  We made reservations, so we were seated right away.  The service was fantastic.  The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the menu.  The wine list is good and the wine is cheaper than most places.  As far as the food goes, we both had Caprese Salads, which were as good as I've ever had.  I had the Canneloni, which are really Manicotti.  Canneloni has meat in it, and this only had spinach and cheese.  It was a perfect portion, too.  My Dad had the rigatoni and he really enjoyed it, too.  And his portion was huge, so he has lunch for tomorrow as well.  I had coconut sorbetti and pistachio gelato for desert.  They serve it in a cone, but it is served in a stand, so it is more like eating it from a bowl, and it was excellent.  My only complaints is one that is a common theme for a lot of upscale restaurants these days, and that it is very hard to see the menu, because it is so dark.  The wait staff has mini lights if you need to see, but I wish people would think more about that when designing these places.  And my only other complaint is that the bread is nothing special.  It does not fit in with the rest of the meal, which was over the top good.  It was like they bought a bunch of loaves at a grocery store bakery and just warmed them up.  There was no butter or garlic or anything, just some oil & vinegar.  They could do a lot more in improving that, but overall, it was a great meal.  And I definitely look forward to eating there again.",gmYU_SLgpWgafgSejWdzTg,1,2,5,Kx-9UUew0SOBUNOqN4Dubw

We decided to order in family style. Appetizer we shared was caprese. Fresh mozzarella used was very good, I enjoyed this simple salad.

While waiting for pasta, a server brought a complimentary small appetizer of olives and cheese tray. Olives tasted like homemade olives, my friend initially refused to eat olives ended up finishing the plate.

For pasta, clams with white wine sauce. I asked them to make the pasta al dente, response was that's the only way they make it. It came out al dente but something wasn't right. I think it might be the quality of pasta they used. It wasn't bad but it was not what I just enjoyed a week ago in Italy, their homemade pasta.

For the main was grilled salmon. This dish just okay, it was cooked as requested. Just average for me.

For desert, we didn't share. We each ordered what we wanted. I had tiramisu. I liked the texture of mascarpone but didn't quite care for biscuits sticking to my cake. I removed them, had one bite the just left it there. 

They have free wifi, since the cell signal was weak, I was only getting 3G at the best, I appreciate their high speed wifi.

Pizza acqua
Arancini
Aumm Aumm pasta
Truffle tagliatelle
Linguini with zucchini flowers
Linguini vongole
Spaghetti carbonara
Gnocchi
Pappardelle Bolognese
Baked rigatoni
Crespelli Cannelloni
Lasagna
Sciué Sciué
Spaghetti and meatballs
Signature pasta
Chicken parmesan
Lemon chicken
Side of broccolini
Zucchini flowers
Bomboloni
Toasted coconut cake
Flourless chocolate torte

There are some winners in the pasta heavy dishes we tried.  The Signature pasta, done table side with flaming vodka in a wheel of parmigiano reggiano to melt some of the cheese and then having the vodka sauced pasta finished in the melted cheese wheel with some fresh basil leaves pulled off a plant and mixed in the pasta.  The flavors are very good and it's one of those fun dishes to watch being created at your table.

The lasagna is a must try dish.  It's layered spinach pasta filled with tomato béchamel sauce and bolognese gravy.  The béchamel-cheese in the layers is creamy goodness.

The gnocchi, pappardelle Bolognese, and spaghetti carbonara are good choices.

Dishes to avoid:  Zucchini flowers, baked rigatoni, spaghetti and meatballs, and the arancini.

This was opening night but the room was a veritable zoo that night.  The service was all over the place.  Our server was very good but his bussers just weren't up to the job.  There were times that there were main dishes to serve and there were no share plates for the table.  Our server tried to rectify this only to have some of the workers ignore the problem at hand.  You can;'t chalk this up to opening night jitters.  There had been a couple of soft opening nights prior to this one when many of these issues should have been addressed and solved.

I'll be back, but they need time to sort out what's right and wrong with the service and to make some corrections to the food, specifically the meatballs and some other items.

Ahi Tuna Tartara ($18): 5/5. Tuna had a slight kick to it. However, it was nothing special. I enjoyed eating it with the semolina chips provided.

Salute Signature Pasta ($26): 3/5. The infamous pasta cooked in a cheese wheel. I decided to add pancetta for an extra $6. Very cool show. Vodka is poured in a cheese wheel, which is then lit on fire. Cooked pasta is then added and then mixed with the melted cheese. However, pasta lacked seasoning. The waiter forgot my pancetta, but after bringing it to the table, it brought a lot of saltiness to the pasta. Although a very interesting concept, the food left me underwhelmed.

We had dined at Yard House and Lucille's before but were in the mood for something different. After reviewing our options, we chose Salute.

We were promptly greeted and whisked to a table. The location wasn't great, but since the restaurant wasn't busy, it was a fine, very small, table for two in the middle of the high traffic, area of the restaurant. (Later in the evening, 2 servers drove by in rented, handicapped scooters...I guess it was the evening's entertainment?!)

Our server, Mike, was engaging and assisted us in making our selections. He assumed we wanted tap water but we ordered a big bottle of Pellegrino to start. We didn't order anything outrageously expensive or unique. We both wanted Caesar Salads ($10 each), to split the Seafood Risotto ($24), and 2 glassed of Sangiovese ($9 each).  

The salads arrived and they were perfectly sized and delicious. We had to ask for fresh, cracked pepper and the server who brought it didn't know how to adjust the coarseness of the pepper. No wine arrived. Mike came to the table and said, ""It looks like something is missing. Didn't you order wine?"" We reminded him of our selection and he said that the bartender was opening a new bottle. Fine. We enjoyed our salads. 

Our table was cleared and the entree arrived, split on 2 plates (very nice!). It was good. The Risotto was cooked nicely. The Calamari was tender and in perfect, bite-sized pieces. We each got 1 Shrimp, 2 small Clams and a few tiny Bay Scallops. The sauce was tasty but sparse. Still no wine.

Mike finally came to check on us and we mentioned the wine again. We promptly received 2 glasses. It was a nice wine but not sure that it was exactly what we ordered. We finished and Mike brought us our check. I was disappointed that the wine wasn't taken off the bill. I asked the hostess for Mike. He promptly came to the table. I diplomatically explained my displeasure and he quickly took care of taking the wine off the bill for us. 

We tipped 20% in cash on the original amount because that's the right thing to do. We had a departing conversation with Mike and explained that we were locals, this was our first time here and that we would like to come back to try the tableside pasta.",C6kw0Rny7jZAGjTj0MWA3Q,1,0,3,0zmO9X8cUNEmqJMltC-f6Q

We sat at the bar. The service was fast and the bartender did their best at mixing the drinks. I had the seafood risotto which for $25, the amount of food was minimal, I mean I got 1 shrimp some clams and rice, not much. My husband ordered the truffle tagliatelle which tasted.

There was a couple of guys sitting next to us and they got oysters which wasn't event on the menu. It seem the staff was more into pleasing them than everybody else. What am I chop liver? Terra Rosa had better customer service.

Fun little table side experience, kids loved it. Not only was it fun to watch them melt the cheese wheel with the torch, add vodka and mix in the pasta, it was extremely good. Tonight we found out that they have removed that dish from the menu and switched it with another receipt which was more like a fettuccine sauce which wasn't great and the meatballs were not cooked all the way through, needless to say, the family did not like it and asked if Salute would come off the family rotation for dinner outings.

We also asked for bread three times and they kept forgetting until the 4th try! At the end they comped part of our meal. However, it's hard to remove the sour experience. 

After such a disappointing diner it is very difficult to look at the good aspects, but I guess I will try my best.

Negatives: the Caesar salad absolutely tasteless. How friggin hard is it to make a good Caesar? The veal chop was overcooked and tough-too thin with thick breading and quite grisly.

They had this huge parmesan cheese wheel and flambéed it with vodka while scraping the cheese and then they added sauce from the kitchen and tossed the fettucine in it.  It was fantastic.  The new chef scraped it and uses a different cheese and the cheese wheel is about 1/3 the size which makes sense because I am sure they are not selling much of it.

Unlike earlier one-star reviews - which read similarly, as if written by the same person with a bone to pick and include unnecessary and classless personal attacks on the staff - service at Salute was excellent, informed, and attentive. I expected shaky service, because of the aforementioned reviews and the fact the restaurant is new and that's the way things always are at new restaurants before the kinks are worked out, but was pleasantly surprised.

I had caprese, lasagna, and dessert. The marinara that topped my lasagna (instead of the usual bolognese) was fantastic. You can tell a lot about an Italian restaurant by the marinara. Here's a tip - on the dessert menu are individual desserts. For the SAME price you can get a dessert sampler with one of everything. Go with that. It's enough to share with 2-3 people. There's a pasta I saw another table order. Staff rolled out a cart with a reggiano parmigiana wheel to tableside, threw some vodka in it, lit it on fire, and tossed pasta in the well of the just-melted parmigiana wheel. It looked fantastic. I'll get that next time.

The patio outside is gorgeous. It's a great setting with waterfalls and rocks. At the right time of year, you'd never want to leave.",8ma2RgRcGa_tjecw2w34CA,3,0,5,f_SjIB6bhvctMG8gr92RQg

As I ate my meal I was drooling over my wife's chop. The Milanese seemed over cooked and dry. The veal chop was the best veal dish I've ever tasted. I was jealous. We ordered different meals to not have the same thing. Never again. The Milanese definitely did not seem worth the $45 price on the menu as IMHO the chicken fried steak at the breakfast buffet at Red Rock was tastier.

5279103,2015-10-01,6,RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ,"Owned by the suddenly swelling ""Clique"" group, whose Hearthstone has become an across-the-street go-to for a great meal from a kitchen staff I trust, it was after several back-and-forths with PR that myself and a few friends sat down on the patio of Salute just prior to its opening - the service expectedly exemplary straight from the hands of Chefs Sautto and Massie while food proved both bold and well-crafted enough to book an opening-night visit with friends as well as family...or at least so it seemed.

No doubt a beautiful space, the interior long and shotgun straight with the left wall running bar to tiled kitchen to antipasti station as art and tiles decorate the walls, it was after a warm welcome at the podium that our party of seven was led to a large central table, greetings offered by everyone from GM Peter to Maitre 'd Enrico and Chef Luciano, the service from a friend an additional treat though Chef Massie apparently could not leave the pass or even be bothered to turn around.

Acknowledging opening night jitters, the majority a fault of completely lost back-servers and a bar that couldn't seem to keep up with a quarter-capacity crowd, it was after a short discussion with Chef Luciano that the kitchen was given carte blanche with a focus on pastas, 32 of the restaurants offerings sampled over the course of this meal plus a next-day ""Invite Only"" with results running the gamut from exquisite to decidedly mediocre with price-to-portion ratios a bit skewed to the left.

Already altering both the offerings and the costs from what was featured during the pre-opening taste, suffice it to say that some interesting items such as Osso Bucco Ravioli were axed in favor of far too many dishes centered on simple tomato sauces, the tableside Fettuccini delicious with a bit less sauce than what was featured prior while the rich Spinach Lasagna was delightfully decadent beneath Bolognese and creamy Bechamel.  

Less successful with undercooked Carbonara and Truffle Tagliatelle that really has no business being served during the earliest days of Fall, a better bite is found amidst the Eggplant speckled Aumm Aumm or tender Linguini beneath blossoms and lightly bitter pesto, the Rigatoni no better than that from Michelina's while the meatballs atop spaghetti were damn near dehydrated while the larger ones served as a side were far more tender and less overwhelmed by spices.

Almost as overpriced on zucchini blossoms as Wolfgang Puck's CUT while the flatbreads at Hearthstone far outperform the pricey Pizza all' Acqua, a 'best-bet' appetizer is more appropriately found in tartare or crudo, though those not trending to tomatoes as primi will also be impressed by the lightness of fried eggplant, the secondi selections of Chicken Parm or Veal Saltimbocca obviously a bit more substantial with the latter wrapped around Fontina and smoked Prosciutto actually quite stunning.

Fairing well with the Lemon Chicken and what may very well be the best Piccata in town suffice it to say that the dry bomboli are a dish best skipped while Coconut Cake and Caprese Pie, both brought in from Peridot Sweets, are well worth ordering - as were the two celebratory cakes delivered for our family and friends outing.

***At first looking like a place that may be interested in shaking up a stagnant Italian scene in the Western Suburbs it seems as though early on Salute has opted to instead play it safe, a bit of a shame considering the 'lightgroup' thumping music and prices not far off from those found on the Strip.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,6,3,lS88xowwMypDGRD_gqg7Qw

We arrived 10 minutes before the designated time and figured we would be told to sit at the bar since we were a few minutes early, but we are drinkers so figured that would be fine.  However, when we arrived, we were told that our patio request was more of a ""recommendation"" and that if we really wanted a patio seat we would have to wait approximately one hour.  Did the hostess think I was joking when I called ahead and made it specifically clear I wanted the patio? At no point was I advised that my request might be ignored.  

Well Salute, that is NOT how you should treat a loyal customer, who lives within walking distance and who ""recommends"" you to others and returns with large parties.  I might expect such service from a place like Olive Garden, but with these prices and portions sizes I expect more. In the future, I will not ""recommend"" this restaurant to others.

Cons: the cost. For 4 of us without drinking it was over $200. I'd rather go to magal for korean bbq twice instead for that cost. Also their Italian donuts were blah. Fried dough ball covered in like a pinch of powdered sugar.

5349131,2015-11-03,5,RodA_gxhr2Mj-pyQAL2RAQ,"My boyfriend took me to Salute this past Saturday for dinner because I realllly wanted to see them make their flaming vodka sauce pasta by the tableside! He made reservations for 7:00 pm, we arrived at the restaurant early by 10 minutes, and we were seated right away. 

Then we waited and waited and waited. It took a good ten minutes before we were greeted by our server with menus and glasses of water. Though, to be fair, our server was stuck with another table and talking to them. Except, to be even more fair, she was a bit on the slow side. 

We ordered burrata & prosciutto, salmon carpaccio, and their salute caprese salad to start off. Yes, the boyfriend was really hungry so he decided to order three appetizers to share. As for our main entrée, I got the table side salute signature pasta and my boyfriend got gnocchi alla sorentina.

Our appetizers came out all at once. It flooded our table because we were at a two seat table. Let me tell you ... we looked like fatasses. 

The burrata & prosciutto had a very nice presentation. The prosciutto was nicely piled up on once side, the cheese was nicely balled up next to it, the grilled bread was neatly placed like dominos, and the balsamic vinaigrette was in a little jar with a spoon. It was beautifully presented .. however, I feel like it was a mess to actually eat. If the grilled bread was in smaller pieces, that may be better. Other than that, it was a really nice dish. I couldn't really taste much in the cheese though. They put lemon zest on top of it so that was all I could taste. The prosciutto was really good. You could actually see them slicing the prosciutto when you walk into the restaurant. I loved the balsamic vinaigrette...it was the perfect amount of sweetness to balance out the prosciutto's saltiness. 

The salmon carpaccio was pretty much covered in lemon and tangy flavors. It was good but the tanginess can get overwhelming if you do not like that type of flavor. I LOVE tanginess so I did enjoy this dish. My boyfriend, on the other hand, didn't care for it all too much. You can still taste the fish underneath all of the tanginess but it isn't as prominent as some would like. 

The salute caprese salad was already split for us, rather than serving it in one whole dish. The presentation looked really nice but a little different from how we normally see it. The cheese and the tomatoes were separate. They also sprinkled some pepper and salt onto the mozzarella, which is a little different. I sort of like this type of set up because I can control how much tomato to eat with my cheese or just gobble the cheese by itself. Hehe. However, the taste of their mozzarella is on the lighter side.

Now, for their table side signature pasta! This one is a special one. They have a huge block of parmesan, wheel it to your table, pour vodka in it, and set it on fire to melt the cheese. I've had something similar except they don't set anything on fire .. but Salute will set it on fire! It was definitely a joy to be able to watch it happen. After they melt the cheese, they pour the pasta that's been cooked in the vodka sauce into the cheeeese and mix it. Afterwards, they serve it on the plate for you. Great entertainment value! As for the taste... I gotta be honest, it gets a little mundane after a while. I think if they added something else to it, it'd turn out better. Also, the pasta that they use is out of the normal. The fettuccine is wavy -- I'm guess they make the pasta in house. I had the urge to slurp it like ramen noodles because it was wavy haha. 

Overall, Salute is a nice place to dine in. It is a little awkward to me that it's sort of a fancy place inside a local casino. It just seems out of place to me. Not only that, the prices are a little on the high side. Then there was our slow server. Maybe it's just her haha. Bright note, if you gamble and have a players card, you can use your rewards points here! I wouldn't mind dining here again.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,10,3,4,cqzLrGs7odl8xYEZm4bcFA

Once we were seated, we were fine.  The waiter and the assistants were very attentive, also checking on us, refilling waters, taking empty plates.

Our food came very fast, almost too fast.  But it was delicious.  Nice portion sizes.  Chicken was nicely cooked, good piccata sauce.  Mom's Bolognese was yummy.  Good chucks of ground meat, nice tomato taste.

I originally ordered a glass of Sangiovese, and my friend opted for a glass of Cabernet. When I tasted my wine, I immediately sent it back. I consider myself to be a pretty good judge of wine and this just didn't measure up to many other Sangiovese wines I have enjoyed in the past. Brandon was understanding and brought me a glass of the Cabernet. Once again, not real tasty but I drank it anyway. I understand that a lot of times when you order by the glass, the wines are usually not the greatest but their list is truly a disappointment. Ok, on to the food. My gnocchi was ok, a little too much sauce and not a lot of flair. My friend ordered the same dish so I have no additional opinion to offer on other dishes. We did order a sample plate of their desserts which came with biscotti cookies, sugared donuts in a nutella like sauce and a delicious sorbet. We could not finish the whole thing so I brought it home for the family. I cannot complain about the service. It was extremely on point. From the waiter to the bus boys, everyone was hustling and keeping people happy. If I return, it would be because of the service.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,2,0,3,9gNHFhlHC_jJ2tO53j-ilg

My husband and I had dinner here 2 nights ago to relax and distressed from our busy schedule. Unfortunately, our server isn't too nice to us, we tried not to bother us so it wouldn't spoil our night. He was rushing almost to take our order and have a bit of an attitude, not friendly at all. He might be having a bad day that day or something but this place isn't a fast food or cheap place to eat. The food was okay, nothing special about it. But, the wine (pocci) we ordered that night was really good! We tried talking to our waiter about the wine and how pleased we are with our choice and he just brushed us off and said ""are you ready to order??!"" He got friendlier towards the end when we are about to pay. I wonder why? Hoping for a good tip perhaps??

I read the opposite on some of the other reviews... so not sure if management is really cracking the whip now...but we were hardly left alone for a minute without someone asking if we needed anything and were always asked if we were enjoying everything . Dishes ordered were the Pappardelle Bolognese, Veal Milanese and Albacore Crudo. Yum, yum and yum. Very impressed. Portions are not large, but typical fine dining size, which we prefer. They certainly may have had some opening missteps in the recent past or some servers that didn't work out. Happens to new restaurants a lot. We did not experience any of that.

Not a ton to rave about here but it was good. My wife had the Chicken Piccata. She usually doesn't order this in a restaurant because it usually doesn't stand up to mine. This one did. I ordered a first for me, Branzino. They will serve this whole, filet or filet with skin on as well as Grilled or salt baked. I chose fillet with skin on. I fully expected to remove the skin. Nope; The skin was crispy and the meat was mild and perfectly cooked. It comes with a very light, pesto like sauce. For a side we ordered the spaghetti squash with marinara; so good. We decided to also go for desert. We had the dark chocolate pie with gelato. Food orgasm worth the 9 dollars.

In my opinion, in Summerlin there is not too much better than this place for an ""upper scale, feeling lazy not wanting to drive all the way to the strip but wanting the strip feel"" pasta place, it is an upgrade from the previous Italian restaurant formerly in the same location(Terra Rosa)  When this place is good, it can be really good, but the odd time you can order the exact same dish as the time before and it come out not tasting the same or even look the same as the prior visit
 I like it, i give it a 3.5 stars, Vegan/Vegetarians.they DO have ""vegan friendly"" pasta (made without egg, just make sure you ask).

Simply put it's just not worth the price. I gave it two chances. The first time I got a pasta and I'm just as happy with that pasta as the jar pasta I make at home. The second time I got fish. It was pretty good but the serving size was so small that I went out to eat after eating it.

The food WAS good, however, there was a large bone in the middle of my chicken Parmesan, which I've never seen before, and did not care for. The risotto had noodles throughout it, which I've never seen before, and did not care for either. 

You can search, but you may never find a single smile on any of the wait staff's faces. Good luck. 

It was so flippin' loud inside the restaurant that you really can't carry on a conversation with anyone at the table other than the person directly next to you or across from you. There was 6 of us, so it made it very annoying. 

The water boys, bus boys, even the male manager on duty, we're all extremely attentive to the two ladies sitting at the table next to us in tiny dresses, fake lashes, big lips, etc... While we waited and waited for more water, and our empty dirty plates sat ignored for 20 minutes. Thanks for making us feel invisible because we didn't dress like Julia Roberts from Pretty Woman.

All of the sauces we had gotten to try from the various entrees were incredible, they do indeed make the dishes.
My party of 3 sat down at one of the booths available. They were busy, but not overcrowded and seemed to keep a very good pace of seating guests.
Our server promptly greeted us. Since it was our first time she introduced us to the menu and familiarized us with the nightly specials which were available. I was looking for a great Italian wine to pair well with any red sauce dishes. Our server recommended a bottle of Barolo, Cantine Giacomo Ascheri, WELL worth it and highly recommended!

All the courses we had were amazing.
Antipasti we ordered were the Arancini, Burrata and Prosciutto, and the Calamari. All of which were to die for, and if I continued eating could easily make a meal out of them.

Our delightful server let us enjoy our appetizers then recommended a few entrees which we shared as well so we could taste each one.
We had Chicken Parmigiana, the Porterhouse (great for not being a steakhouse), and my favorite.. the Lobster Fra Dia'volo.
Oh my goodness.. absolutely fantastic. And of course we had another bottle of wine brought to the table. After all, an excellent meal calls for excellent wine.

We finished the second bottle of Barolo for our desserts. 

Very Highly recommended. Enjoy your time, don't skimp out on trying some dishes. They have a happy hour but I recommend trying the full menu.",nOTtzy_hWyrjBMb3o33AuQ,0,0,5,YC8T6SaK5koNLScbA5a0gg

First up is Salute.

Here our party of four had dinner reservations, but arrived early and were delayed in getting seated.  Then there was another delay in receiving our menus.  Once they came, everything turned around, and we enjoyed a great Italian dining experience.  Caesar Salad was excellent with Creamy Parmesan Dressing and Focaccia Croutons.  Veal Marsala was fork-tender, and very colorful gooey and cheesy Eggplant Parmesan tasted as good as it looked.  Lasagna with Spinach Pasta, Tomato Sauce, and Bolognese Gravy was excellent, and crispy roasted Rosemary Potatoes with sea salt and Parmesan Cheese were hot and simply delicious.  A table mate's Baked Rigatoni Bolognese glistened from nicely melted cheese and was described as very good.  My entree-size Eggplant Parm was one of the best I have ever experienced, and because it is largely composed of a vegetable, one can feel less guilty about eating this cheesy but meatless concoction.

From the time we ordered, service was spot on.  The chef himself brought my entree to the table.  The ambiance was sleek and modern, with all white dishes.  Rousing, thumping piped in music provided a pleasant backdrop.  Initially our server forgot to assemble two separate checks, but quickly recovered to comply with our earlier request.

I will most definitely be back to sample other fine Italian dishes served here!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,8,5,fHx9rvON_6AUKnIyXKB0RA

I noticed that the servers seemed spread thin and didn't feel like they could devote a lot of time to their customers. The waiter that was assigned to our table barely smiled. Maybe, he was just tired. He wasn't rude or anything, though. 

The food presentation was excellent! My son had the salute signature pasta where it was served through a flaming spinning cheese bowl. Kind's like the Lawry's spinning bowl salad. I had the salmon and my husband had the veal parmigiana. All of the ordered food tasted good and served with right portions. The prices for each entrees is a little bit high.

I had the Salmon w/ rissoto and it was good, but nothing to write home about. I also tried the fried zucchini flowers, which were just glorified mozzarella stick, but came with this amazing pistachio pesto sauce that made the dish worthwhile.

Tastefully done without being overwhelming. Our waiter came to our table and introduced himself within 60 seconds. After going over the specials of the day we asked for recommendations. Our waiter explained all the pastas that are made in house and invited us to take a look at their antipasto display. We settled on all of his recommendations. The antipasto was so fresh. All the meats and cheeses were fresh and so flavorful. We followed that up with a meatball appetizer. It was big enough to quarter and share with the couple we were with. Had I know how good it was, I might have ordered one for me and not shared. Next we had the caprese salad. The mozzarella literally melted in my mouth. For dinner I had the Truffle Tagliatelle (also suggested by our waiter), it was to die for. We had a round of Limoncello, which we were informed is made in house.
