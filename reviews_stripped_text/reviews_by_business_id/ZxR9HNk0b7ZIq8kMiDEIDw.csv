When we asked why the two small scoops are smaller than the scooper used for the sundae he said they do that to make the small ice cream look bigger. WTH?

BTW The cherry came from my wife's sundae. It did come with the HRC flag though. How cute.  I could have purchased two gallons of vanilla for the money spent on the two melon ball scoops of ice cream.

1708670,2015-06-16,0,ZxR9HNk0b7ZIq8kMiDEIDw,"So there are 2 Hard Rock Cafes in Las Vegas: one on The Strip, and this one at the corner of Paradise and Harmon.  To make things more confusing, this Hard Rock is NOT in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, but is a separate structure in front of it (and surrounded by the Hotel's driveway).  Got it?  

Ok, now that we know where we are, let's go in.  The decor is typical of every Hard Rock there is: rock memorabilia (mostly guitars) mounted on the walls with plaques identifying the musician who once used it, and many TV's featuring rock videos.  It felt fresh and exciting in New York in the 1980's; now it seems tame and stale.  Maybe that's why I was the only patron who was not 1) elderly, or 2) dining with small children.  

I was greeted promptly and cheerfully by the hosts, and they offered me a seat at the bar, which I took.  I had slept in too late and so I missed the bacon egg and cheese croissant I had been craving (breakfast ends at 11 AM).  Instead I decided to go safe and order the Legendary Burger.  

My bartender also had tables he was in charge of serving, so he was gone a lot.  Watching him work, he had a tendency to get task-saturated: he would keep running back and forth to whatever table had asked him for something last, rather than taking care of multiple parties in sweeps.  I finally just went to the server station and had him refill my drink from the soda gun.  

The food was fine.  Nothing spectacular, but not bad, either.  The price seemed a little steep, but 1) this is a tourist-trap, and 2) check in with Yelp yields a 20% discount on food and non-alcoholic drinks, so that was nice.

So this place in the 90s was the chit. I mean you had to have the t shirt from any of 10 cities to show how cool you were. Fast forward to today, and I don't think I have sen anyone in a hardrock café t shirt in at least 10 years. Crazy stuff truth be told. The swag here is the same as every other hard rock café worldwide, it just says lost wages on it instead of Albuquerque, Sydney, or London. 

Pro Tip: Yelp check in for 20% off of your check not including alcohol.

I got a burger that was fairly average when I was here. It didn't stand out and make me go wow or think anything specific. To go with it I got french fried potatoes and topped them with cheese and BACON! Sadly it cost me an extra $2.50 for the cheese and bacon O_O   I was totally caught off guard by that. Especially when it was one strip of bacon crumbled and one slice of American cheese. Not exactly a great bang for your buck.

One of my friends had a salad which was purportedly decent. It came with a number of toppings and I bet the total calorie count was more than my burger and fries =X My other two friends there split a meal which they seemed to enjoy but weren't very excited about and I cant remember what they ordered haha.

Drinks were decent pours but that is expected in Vegas IMHO. Several hurricanes were delivered to our table and the girls enjoyed them and got them with the souvenir glasses.

Overall it was acceptable food but a bit pricey for what we received IMHO. The brand is not worth the extra cost at this point in time and it was an average meal with averagish service and bygone swag... so enjoy it if you go but don't expect much...",f8W2Qv9QosVaP-dRQwLEyw,9,9,3,Y2RBFKXBNs0-pQRQR0f91A

Okay, I'm exaggerating, but the service was fast and with a smile. Brett Michaels (well, he looked like him) served us intelligently, even though he did upsell us on a Hurricane glass without saying that we were optioning in to buy it. It's okay though, he's working in the Hard Rock Cafe, I win the moral victory.

Anywho, the food was okay, though the portions felt a little on the drab/small side. The fries were excellent, but the Mojito I had was probably the worst I've ever had. What did they use, Domino and tap water? Nevertheless, the guy took it off my bill, after I made a face like I'd tasted bum.

Overall, this place is way too out of the way as far as the strip goes to be worth it, and price/selection wise really isn't going to blow anyone away. And no I will not ramble at length about the memorabilia - even the Baltimore branch was more impressive.

The first time I came here I had some kind of pulled pork sandwich which was just alright, but I saw a manager scream at my poor waitress which kinda left a bad taste in my mouth. 

Last night my friend and I had the appetizer sampler which came with spinach artichoke dip, chicken wings, chicken tenders, onion rings, and some kind of brushetta flatbread. My friend doesn't like onion rings, so they allowed us to sub french fries, which was nice. Everything was just ok, nothing special. The only thing that was wholly awful were the chicken wings - not only were they cold, they were rubbery and just plain gross. We got bbq because my friend can't eat spicy and they were still spicy. They were just weird and we didn't even eat them. We also had the brownie sundae which is $10 which we thought was outrageous until we saw the size of the thing. It was HUGE. Like bigger than my head. You need like a football team to eat the thing. Four of us still only ate like a third of it. Wow it was big. 

Our server was very nice, I don't remember her name but she was pretty fast and attentive. Only thing she ever forgot was a twisted lemonade that I had to remind her about but once I did she grabbed it right away!

My mom was actually the one that said that she wanted to go here... something about some gift cards that she had been toting around... ok fine..

I think it had really been about 10 years since i've been to a Hard Rock Cafe.... I think it was in New Orleans... and it wasn't that memorable.

This one was a pretty good experience.

I still had my doubts as I was looking over the menu...  $15 for a 10oz burger?  ouch...  I wasn't even going to look on the menu for the $8 shake... thats just out of hte question.

So I ordered a burger to share with my wife... and a side of the Mac&cheese that I read on here was good.

The wait was on the long side....which as it turns out... I noted, but was entertained enough for it not to matter.  I know this will show my taste in music, but here's what I remember of what was playing:

Billy Idol  - White wedding
Rolling Stones - Paint it black
Violent Femmes - Blister in the Sun
Live - Lightning Crashes
Green Day - some song I forgot the name
Paul Mcart - some other song where when he sings he sticks his neck out like a chicken(oh wait.. that's all of them)
some Billy joel song....

the food came and the burger was quite good... the Mac and cheese was pretty durned guud too.

I wandered into the store, and while a onesie for the little girl was a bit on the pricey side at $14, a button down casual shirt for me at $40 wasn't too bad... we'll see how long it lasts.

Overall... I was won over again.. I still don't like the fact that you pay a variable cost of being there in the amount of food that you order, but it's ok as a once-in-a-long-while place to eat.",-gokwePdbXjfS0iF7NsUGA,0,0,4,zipajfAFVTe7gYIxNMxBmg

Anyways I love the atmosphere and all of that rock memorabilia. There's a bar right in the middle with a number of small and medium sized tv's, notice how I didn't say big or large tv's. The customer service was pretty good too as they were accommodating to our party, friendly, and brought everything, food, drinks, check in a timely manner.

For the food, a lot of what we ordered was decent at most. First up was the jumbo combo which was basically a sampler of their various apps it had some wings, chicken tenders, onion rings, artichoke dip, parmesan flatbread and bruschetta, and a few dipping sauces. It was a nice start for a party of 5 and of course I got a little full eatting everything no one else didn't want. The platter was alright only thing I didn't like was the flatbread and bruschetta cause it was hard and messy to eat I might've even chipped a few teeth.

Next came what I ordered the bbq brisket sandwich. It was plenty filling just dry and tough. Maybe the bread took some of the moisture. It didn't come with any kind of sauce which could've maybe helped, maybe. Also came with fries and beans.

The bbq trio was bbq chicken, ribs, and brisket. Good portion but everything was very dry. Funny cause I think I read that it was supposed to be tender.

We never made it to the desserts but everything looked tempting. Probably would be back.

We INTENDED to catch a cab after lunch at Hofbrauhaus across the street [http://www.yelp.com/biz/hofbrauhaus-las-vegas#hrid:LFSpiDUZx54FA6cK7oTi9g], BUT ""hey, let's catch a cab!"" somehow turned into ""hey, let's do shots!""  So I'm told.

... which turned into 5 rounds of shots.  So I'm told.

But inside that hour-twenty, the packed restaurant, with its Rock history paraphenalia and memorabilia is entertaining.  Throw in a dozen televisions, blaring music, and impromptu staff/customer singalongs and a good time is sure to be had.

3079925,2014-09-29,1,ZxR9HNk0b7ZIq8kMiDEIDw,"Well I want to start by saying my rating for this restaurant is misleading. The only reason I gave this poor excuse for a restaurant the one star I did is because this app requires me to do so. I am not the least bit picky when it comes to restaurants and normally have a great deal of patience for the staff as I understand their jobs are difficult, fast-paced and demanding. Despite this attitude, I was nothing short of extremely disappointed with my experience at this location. Although the restaurant was nearly empty at lunchtime, the service was extraordinarily slow and we were greeted with an attitude reflective of a staff that was filled with bitterness and broken dreams. Even the simplest requests caused our waiter Rico (yes I wrote his name in the hope that there is not even a remote possibility of him escaping responsibility for this poor review) to treat us as if we were a burden on par with the bubonic plague. He refused to make the slightest adjustments to the menu despite our friend's preference to not have coleslaw with his meal. Splitting our check (a common practice in the age of debit cards) was seen as an insurmountable obstacle that clearly irritated Rico. I asked for a glass of water and Rico answered me in a hostile manner indicating he had already brought me some. I proceeded to correct him by informing him that the water belonged to my friend. Approximately 10 minutes later he returned with my water and slammed it on my table without so much as another word. Our food finally arrived nearly an hour after we ordered it and while the taste was passable in my eyes, nearly the rest of my party was thoroughly disappointed with the food we had wasted our valuable vacation time waiting on. So if after all this ranting you are still not convinced that the service here is not so poor that it should be reprehensible by law, at least ask not to be served by a stocky waiter with dark curly hair, a goatee, and a beanie who goes by the name of Rico. If you are asked for the reasoning behind this particular request, show the manager this review.",gCOpu5G_45UgLUssEA0ECg,0,0,1,krQWC9Ol-EoyFViEkkT-qg

I got the ""Goat Cheese Chicken Salad Sandwich"". It had no flavor. The sandwich was too small for $13.50.

My man had the ""10oz Burger"" and he said the burger didn't have much flavor as well. The cost for that was $$15.75 and they charged $3.75 for a side on ""Onion Rings"" with it. Way too much money.

We decided to split a dessert and got the ""Mini Peanut Butter Pie"" and that cost $4.25. I have to say this was the best part of the meal.

One perk is that if you have a Nevada ID you get 15% off your bill which is cool but when the food isn't so tasty that doesn't seem like much of a perk.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,3,2,2,War13gScnhB5YQSBASUzRw

Out of the ENTIRE restaurant, two tables had customers, it was a bit lonely in there and a complete dichotomy from the times I've visited in the past. 

We ordered our beverages and took a look at the menu. $18, for a hamburger? $16 for a holiday drink? Something isn't right about that... I've eaten here before and had the burgers, they are good but c'mon! I was recently at the Hard Rock in Pittsburgh and the prices were FAR more reasonable. We ended up ordering one root beer ($3.99 + tax & tip- but oh, not one refill was given..) And one domestic beer in a bottle. We decided to leave it at that and ended up eating down the street at P.F Cheng's (which was fabulous, by the way).

Perhaps the drastically overpriced menu has gnawed at the customer base that kept it thriving for years.

I called back to verify if there were more rooms/floors for smoking ..Isabel at the front desk is who took my call regarding the wrong room preference.. she actually offered more than the second floor which was interesting because I was told there was only the second floor for smoking in the Paradise towers by David. She actually gave me options which included a suite in the HRH suites.. I told her to book me the room & I would wait for Stephanie to arrive at 11:00 to speak with her regarding the mistake .. Isabel said no problem .. I will book this room & will have Stephanie call you .. no more than 7 minutes later ..Isabel called back & said due to the inconvenience we will switch you to the suite at the same rate .. I told her thank You and she sent a bell man.. 10 minutes later Jeffery our bell man arrived & was GREAT.. he had a super sweet personality & good conversation ..

They have a nice sized staged in the back of the restaurant, which is appropriately placed so you can get a good view wherever you may be seated. Sound quality is fantastic. Props to you, sound man! I thought it was really awesome of them to offer a free show without a drink minimum. That alone will keep me coming back here. They didn't try and pressure us to order anything; we simple ordered some tea and appetizers and watched a really great acoustic set.

I decided to have dinner at the Hard Rock Cafe one night because I had one tickets to a concert at the Joint, inside the hotel/casino. As a fan of rock music, I'd been wanting to eat in this place for a long time. 

The first thing I noticed upon arrival - shitty parking. There were HARDLY ANY SPACES, over half of which were blocked off for valet use only. I looked all around for a place to park - none whatsoever. The guy at the valet booth gave me directions to a garage, but I never found or saw it. The only garage I was able to find was for Hard Rock employees only. I finally had to park in a lot across the street. This story continues later in the review. 

The restaurant itself is jam-packed with memorabilia. What Planet Hollywood is for movies, this place is for rock music. Memorabilia from every popular rock band you can possibly imagine is in here. Not to mention they sell plenty of items in their gift shop. It's a music lover's paradise. 

The food was very good. Not the best cuisine I've had in the Vegas Valley, but it was certainly good. Definitely better than I would have expected for a restaurant like this that focuses more on its gimmick than its food, although my girlfriend's mashed potatoes did taste like they came out of a TV dinner. Other than that, all the food was fine.

Remember the parking situation I talked about before? It gets worse. When I returned to my car, I found a big ""violation"" tag on it, and a boot. I HAD TO PAY A $200 FINE TO HAVE IT REMOVED. In other words, I had to pay more money to have this thing removed than I would have paid if I had BOUGHT the concert tickets I had won. Why should I have to suffer because the Hard Rock can't provide adequate parking to its customers? Seriously and literally, I parked in the ONLY PLACE I COULD FIND, and was made to suffer for it.

And just a heads up - If you buy a souvenir glass in the restaurant, they WILL NOT LET YOU TAKE IT IN THE CONCERT VENUE. This is utter bullshit, considering it was merchandise from THEIR FACILITY, and it is a SITTING venue (this isn't a raucous ""standing room only"" venue!) So I had to walk all the way to the coat check booth to deposit it during the show. 

The Hard Rock Cafe is a great place for music lovers, but do yourself a favor and take a cab there. The parking is THAT bad. And don't even think about parking across the street unless you want to pay a hefty fine.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,1,0,3,_oD6GGY5ISAwL39mMOI-Bw

Warily I agreed.   After arriving my friend seemed stunned by the prices and the lack of a locals discount or the specials he thought they had.   To this day I'm not sure if he made those up or was at a different place entirely that he was thinking of.   Never fear, the yelp app was here to save the day!   Check in and you get 20% off.   I love you Yelp app.  

Started with some Jameson and Ginger and they were okay.   For $9 not much value, but I've definitely had worse.   Went with the ""Local Legendary"" burger which differs by location and oddly enough you have to ask the server what it consists of as the Hard Rock apparently is too cheap to have each location have their own menu.    Ours had some fried jalapenos and spicy something or other which was enough for me to try it.   I see someone else in these reviews mentioned their local legendary burger had a fried egg.  Mine did not.   I'm now convinced the ""Local Legendary"" burger is just something either the waiter or cook invents in their own head that day.   Well our waiter sold me on this one.   Speaking of which, our waiter was a joy the entire time.   Friendly, efficient, and with a great sense of humor.   If it wasn't for the last round of Jameson shots I'd probably be able to tell you his name.  He kinda reminded me of Questlove from the Roots if that helps.

Onto the burger:  Pretty run of the mill.   I ordered it medium and I feel like it came out well done.   Very charred and with very little pink inside.  Wish I'd gone with medium rare as I normally do, but then I hate when it comes out rare.   Such a delicate game the burger ordering process.   I also didn't feel it had enough seasoning to overcome the wellness of the cook on it, but the jalapenos, cheese, and whatever sauce it was slathered with all were tasty enough to conceal the meat flavor.   Fries were hot and crispy with a nice flavor, but nothing to really differentiate themselves from any other fry.   

Overall on food I'd probably go a 2.5, with the great service and 20% yelp discount bumping it up to a 3. 

I've come to find out through other reviews that the locals discount is a measly 15% vs the 20% yelp discount.   Go technology!   Next time I expect a 40% discount if paying by bitcoin.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,0,0,3,NF2dE2FQnYK9diAmov7eEQ

5599972,2015-11-23,0,ZxR9HNk0b7ZIq8kMiDEIDw,Excellent service the food was great our server Leilani really took care of us. Then we went into the gift shop I was going to buy an item they didn't have our size so they called the other store not have the size we wanted and had them hold it for us. My only problem with the store and the reason I gave them a four star was because the bathrooms were disgustingly smelly I can smell the urine before I walk into the restroom. I was surprised for such a clean store to have a smelly bathroom,0znknZPDAuqrFofmmUIwMw,0,1,4,YG-8D3TUzhGHPcSesPCWcA

Anyways,  I believe I had their Mac and Cheese and Buffalo wings? Oh and their coconut mojito? I forgot. But eh, I wouldn't come here again.",5M1Kjx4seOmwODw4XZFTPg,3,3,2,bZaO81-1FpGNVXuvNRxQYw

5707243,2016-03-23,4,ZxR9HNk0b7ZIq8kMiDEIDw,"Review is for the RETAIL store.  My friend Karen has not been to Las Vegas for over three years, so I took her to the Hard Rock Cafe to check out the casino and the café.

There's 2 Hard Rock Cafe's in Las Vegas, one on the strip (but it's a franchise), and the original corporate one is this one off Paradise Rd, diagonally from the Hofbräuhaus. The café is not connected to the casino or hotel. Even the parking lot is not connected but has its own separate area.

Karen wanted a shot glass and the café had a bunch, including a limited-edition one. That's when we found out the café on the strip was not a corporate owned store. The one on the strip does not have the same merchandise as this location. Like all the other Hard Rock Cafe is, there's tons of music memorabilia post it all over the restaurant. When you walk in, you'll find Life-size mannequins of KISS. 

The gift shop is pretty large, and the one guy who helped us was pretty friendly. He even signed up Karen for their frequent reward program.  Overall a good experience, except when you're at the parking lot, there's a lot of homeless people which gave me the creeps. The Hard Rock Cafe staff member said there's a water channel located nearby, and that's where the homeless people live.",cKJ0r01eF7E-tYp2FQOyRA,7,6,4,z2bHNXIGD5tW8wJm9O2UHA

With the full moon at the right of the body of the guitar.  Was a perfect welcoming mat to my checking in to the hotel. Seeing it.,9-ahKwMwUhZJfPhA8PUlXg,0,0,5,bTzvao6nU-lmIoZYra9KBQ

I like the breakfast but I feel that the food is more catered towards experience than it is to feed you and fill you. Smart way to get you to order more but not really my style.,55CJNbQXt8a_ILPWBqElxA,0,0,3,WDoY3WP6Zl0KqTjeaFrnkg

They have three party packages to choose from and they're all reasonably priced.  I booked everything via email and it was super easy.  They set us up on one side of the restaurant and seated the other diners on the opposite side, which was really nice.  The food was yummy, they let us hang out for as long as we wanted, and our servers were so awesome.  The memorabilia helped keep the conversations rolling and the atmosphere was perfect for a relaxed get-together for our friends and family.",-pn0Cu1ugw7iZbzq7my08w,0,0,5,XoRghPQ3cyFVVSq0ipXe-w

This time we ordered 2 plates of the buffalo wings, which were some of the best I have ever had, and fries. Check totaled about $25, and the service was super fast and friendly. Totally low key and nothing to really rave about, but if you find yourself in the Hard Rock and need something to nosh on, and don't want to spend a fortune this is your place.",Agbv8YDkOE7V_ZfJseLVOA,16,16,3,uiNH4lxJZm4A1H_8pzm6bg
5837983,2015-03-11,2,ZxR9HNk0b7ZIq8kMiDEIDw,"The Hard Rock Cafe continues to be a prime place for juicy and very tasty 1/2 pound burgers.

On my latest visit I enjoyed an excellent Original Legendary Burger ordered medium rare, with French Fries and fine crunchy but yielding O-rings.  This  bacon cheeseburger arrived with a moist beef patty cooked at just the right temperature, dripping with meat juices.  Potato Skins contained too much potato and from an ideal perspective not enough cheese, but were still good.  

Our booth was quite comfortable in a setting of piped in rock music; service was very good; and acceptance of a Birthday BOGO coupon made the cost of dinner for 3 persons quite reasonable.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,2,3,4,lg4EgBI6mZFwfOFKrMiiBw

I got a salad to go and it was marginal.  They gave me the wrong dressing and no fork.  The dressing was sparse not enough to use with the salad.
The manager reached out and apologized and I will be in again.",kQRonKkxNEuUauXLoJ0OWQ,0,0,4,kS7pan1U754OyRBglhIP-A

The inside is your typical HRC, but there was hardly anyone there and the mood of the restaurant staff did not help, except for the manager.  She was upbeat, attentive, and had a constant smile on her face.  If it was not for her our experience would have been a total flop.  

Kids' meals are $7.99 for an ""entree"", small side, and a drink.  We had 3 kid meals... Expensive!!!Chicken strip meal consisted of 3 strips that tasted like fish and 3 florets of broccoli.  The Mac-n-cheese was very good, IMO, but too ""cheesy"" for the 4 year old.",IEfrWahq335dd6vol7pgog,0,0,2,iQZLcJxicyg2pOGcmfmKGw
