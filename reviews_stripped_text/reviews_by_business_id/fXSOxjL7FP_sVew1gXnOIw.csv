But this was the worst pizza I have had in my life, and I am not a critical person prone to giving one star reviews. I got a 'traditional' vegetarian pie. There was barely any cheese or tomato sauce on it. It was undercooked and doughy, bland, tasteless, and didn't even have enough salt on it. The crust was way too wide due to them not putting much tomato sauce or cheese on it. The vegetarian topping is diced green, yellow and red bell peppers and onions, which I knew beforehand, but which seemed to have put straight from a bag of frozen diced bell peppers and onions onto the pizza prior to underbaking it. Thankfully they gave us some little containers of dry Parmesan and crushed red pepper which helped make it at least edible. I never eat just one slice of pizza but one slice was more than enough. The four other people with me agreed that the pizza was bland and undercooked. We went here at 9 pm today which is not late for them as they were going to be open till 3 am or something according to their sign. I can't believe this restaurant has 3 1/2 stars on yelp.

It was born in the New York, New York Casino ""streets"" area as a New York City style pizza place.  It is a solid New York City style pizza place in the middle of a casino in the middle of the desert.  It isn't perfect NYC pizza.  It is probably a bit more Sbarro's than it is strait from Italy, however, don't hate on the place because it isn't shipped in from Italy.  
The prices are reasonable, not great by any means, but not heavily expensive.  Generally you can get a piece of pie and a beer for $5.  After spending $20/meal all up and down the strip, it is nice to get a cheap(er) meal.   It is ""street"" eating which means you will eat on the outside of the pizza shop, however by no means is it outdoors.  
The pizza itself is good, but not strait from NYC by any means.  It is a nice place to sneak away for a bite for lunch to keep your day moving without having to dedicate 45 mins-1 hour for a meal.  
I don't endorse this place a true NYC pizza place, but I do endorse it in having good pizza, at a reasonable price which serves a need for the Vegas tourist at some point during their trip.",zxMo7emoqvWavJRtJF_9rw,1,0,4,4yTHesCJxu61wBY0Hi16Pw

The toppings and cheese were sliding off and it was just a huge mess.  We literally had to use forks to scoop the toppings back on our broken slices of pizza.

I'm from the same metro as you and I can name at least 10 places that are heads and shoulders better than this. In fact, this isn't even very good pizza, not for the price anyway. If it cost $2 a slice I'd say it was perfect, but since it's almost $5 a slice, gah! It better be something special.

This is not something special. It's your typical Pizza made NY style and the ingredients didn't seem like anything I wouldn't get from your low grade pizza joint. I'd never, ever go back here because the cost of the pizza just was not remotely worth the slice they gave me, which had also clearly been sitting out longer then I'd of liked as well.

I've tried pizza in Los Angeles as well, I also tried it in Chicago, in Alberqueque, in Minneapolis, in Milwaukee, but mark my words the Vegas pizza I ate here was by far the worst, and surprise surprise, also the most costly.

You walk up and choose what slice you want based on what they have prepared, if you want something different they tell you it's not available or to come back later. I chose a slice of cheese and a slice of pepperoni. When I started eating, it was already starting to get cold. You could tell it had been sitting there for a while.

I ended up getting a deep dish pizza with pepperoni & mushrooms and my fiancé got a deep dish pizza with the veggie toppings. Both pizzas tasted fresh, had quite a few toppings, and had stringy gooey cheese. At 1am, they definitely hit the spot!

I will say that when we walked in, I hadn't look at the prices per slice. To my surprise, the total for two was a little bit over $15! They had a special for $7-some for a slice of pizza & a beer but I didn't realize that until after we had already paid.

That memory is forever engraved in my mind. A decade+ later and I still find myself coming to New York New York and getting a slice at Sirrico's.

I try me best at visiting Sirrico's whenever I'm in town. I'll admit it's not the best pizza in Vegas, but I love it for some reason. I guess it does help that it's open until 3 or 4AM. The slices are a little pricey ($5-6) but are generous in size. I typically get a traditional slice and a Sicilian slice. Add a soft-drink and you're looking at about $12.

The pizza itself depends on how long it's been sitting under the heat lamp. I typically wait for fresh pies to come out and never fail to be tasty. The crust is especially good, most notable on the Sicilian style, which is extra thick. The gooey cheese, thick crust, and pizza sauce all add up for some tasty NY pizza. I'm sure Sirrico's is years away from authentic NY style pizza, but it's Vegas after all.

My brother, boyfriend and I were famished after the boxing match and decided to just take food in our hotel room.

This place is a generic pizza place where you can pick a slice of whatever flavor they have available. There isn't really anything too special about this place and the slices are decent in size. One slice should be enough for a snack or a light lunch. Don't expect the crust to be crispy since the pizza are just left on display and are quickly warmed up if needed.

He says, ""Am gonna take you to where the best New York pizza is!"" Uhm, there's that in this city? Am thinking, my my my he knows I heart NY pizza!?! How did he know? Hmmm, a man after my own heart! Yeaaay okay, he picks me up and off we go. Initially, he says to valet park the car and so I thought so we can get in to noshing pizza at once (with a smile to my face) but then the practical me says to him to just park the car in the self park area of the hotel because am thinking this keeps my hunger perked up some more into hunger-ness. It's just that I miss New York pizza. It's been sooo long ago, and so does he! We're both from the Eastcoast so there...New York pizza is a definite go-to food for us. New York pizza have always been the best pizza I ever tasted in this American part of the world. (I just have to dream about real Italian pizza until I set foot in Italy some day).

Sirrico's Pizza is in New York-New York hotel and casino. It serves mighty big slices in that good ol' triangle shape or square shape pizza cuts. It's fresh and hot hot from the oven! A variety of pizza choices. Didn't even shy me from asking for the newest made pizza and the biggest of the slices. Pizza grande!

Like a ""starved"" woman, I was aching for this pizza. Looking at the slices of Sirrico's Pizza from the big wide glass-encased food service counter, the pizza man served my boyfriend first and then me. He served us with politeness to even ask which pizza we wanted. Of course, I asked for the ones fresh out of the oven as he pulls out from the oven a new hot tray of pizza and layed it down in front of us. A side order of garlic bread with tomato sauce also was requested by my man friend. Service was polite, fast and with ease. There was no line or wait as we breezed through with the pizza and beverages into the paying process. I spotted the usual toppings of hot dried red peppers, garlic, oregano along the way to the cashier. Asked my boyfriend whether he likes garlic and not repulsed by the smell of it. He says he likes garlic, oh my! Then so, I got a hold of the oregano, hot red dried pepper, garlic containers and drizzled 'em on my pizza! These, are my usual fixings to the New York pizza for as long as I eat New York pizza ever since. I usually ignore the cheese topping. There's cheese enough in the pizza. Why ever top it with another kind of cheese?  the parmesan cheese. 

Dear boyfriend found a nice round table to seat outside of the pizzeria. It's dining ala outdoors-y from the pizzeria which includes people-watching and strains of music from somewhere the piano bar next to the pizzeria can be heard. I have to say for the cost it took to have 'em, this did not faze either one of us from having two picks of pizza slices each: a slice of ooey-gooey cheesey large cuts of pepperoni pizza and a slice of vegetarian pizza topped with large cuts of onions, olives, mushrooms and green peppers. The pizza had just the right amount of cheeze-iness, tasty tomato sauce, and it appeared moist with oil clearly visible but it lack the desired crunchiness on the dough for it was thick! Oh pleased...gusto, mangia mangia pizza pizza! (eat pizza) Mangiare pizza grande! (eat big pizza!) Aaah, hearty dining! It's my man's treat of a simple meal but mightily appreciated, as it brings a smile to my tummy and memories of our eastcoast lives and New York! To some this may not be the best pizza in this city but sure is to our New York pizza memory. Hungry for pizza? You, am talking to you!

The only thing better than watching Giants fans get pissed off and openly frustrated about their team's play in a loss to Dallas is watching Eagles fans do the same thing. 

So, before finding a nice spot to enjoy the second half, I knew getting a slice in this hotel and casino would enhance the victory. Besides, getting slices in a casino themed for New York had to be tasty.

Well, despite some of the negative reviews here from people who clearly have no discernible taste buds when they are drunk near closing at 3am, I would recommend this pizza and even thought the sauce had a nice extra kick to it. 

There were about eight different types of slices to choose from, in both thin crust and Sicilian. And mine was plenty hot despite ordering a slice that was sitting out on display and then put back in the oven for a couple minutes. 

And since I'm always looking for lunch deals back home that feature slices and a drink, I was immediately attracted to their deal offering ANY slice AND a draft beer for $7.77. I was a little disappointed that tax wasn't included...simply because if you're really doing a Vegas-style deal, you should literally pay $7.77 as the total.

As legendary hockey writer Dicky Dunn would say, ""I was trying to capture the spirit of the thing.""

Besides, the draft beer you receive is a cold, crisp, clean, Busch Light. 

Yes, I've had it before. Yes, I attend NASCAR races. No, I don't drink it often.

However, that Busch Light washed down a large slice of pepperoni in a surprisingly effective fashion while I gleefully listened to one Giants fan after another bitch about Eli Manning over in the sports book.",MmEYowrsA4j3K4gc9Th53g,3,4,4,zyl1onrnOzQmLNCEJwpb9Q

4462541,2009-10-20,0,fXSOxjL7FP_sVew1gXnOIw,"Located inside the New York New York Hotel & Casino, I have to say that Sirrico's Pizza is probably the best deal for food you will get on the strip.  With prices starting out at around $3 and getting a whole pizza for around $16, if you're hungry and looking for something filling at a cheap price, this is your stop.

They offer 2 different types of Pizza ""Traditional"" which is more of your NY style thin crust slice or ""Sicilian"" which is more like a forroccia style slice and they have about 5 or 6 different styles of each pizza ready to be served.  They also offer some pasta, sandwiches, and salads.  Sirrico's Pizza is run like a lunch counter, you pick what you want, slide your tray over and pay at the register.  Not much to it.

I decided to get a ""traditional"" slice of pepperoni pizza.  They guy gave me a huge piece and paid for it and found a seat around the corner.  Took a bit into it and have to say it was alright.  The crust was thin, but not like a cracker so you can easily fold it in half, they were a bit light on the sauce for my taste and very heavy on the cheese.  There was also a good amount of pepperoni on it, so I'm glad they didn't skimp on that.  It wasn't the best pizza I've had, but in Vegas for about $3 and good portion size, I honestly couldn't complain.  It made for a good 3:30 in the after noon late lunch before dinner at 8PM and filled me up.

Overall, yes I would come back because the pizza wasn't half bad and their prices better than most things you would get in Vegas.  It did the job and the job well, normally I would rate someplace like Sirrico's Pizza at 3 stars, but considering the portion and value especially compared to all the other places in Vegas that way over charge you, it's worth rounding up to 4 stars.  If you're looking for something cheap, reasonable, and filling, Sirrico's Pizza is probably one of the best values you will find in Vegas, 4 stars.",BclQLeF-geeAYb5Re98thA,0,0,4,WR0zGU_Tp9RKTCmP3X6Hfg

This place used to be so good, man. Like, super good. They had amazing pizza, though the prices were high. Still, we'd come here every other weekend. We were regulars, and it was our opinion at the time that the pizza here could not be beat. 

That was then. Now, it seems that their pizza is less awesome. I don't know whether that's because the quality has indeed dropped, or maybe it's because I've gotten used to it and now I expect amazing things from this this place. Their lasagna is still good, though I'm certain that it has dropped in quality from where it used to be. 

Because the pizza here is more expensive, it's easy for you to spend $15 on a meal here. Not that it's not worth it, but it just seems kinda pricey.

   It was a busy Saturday night on the Las Vegas Strip. Walking from Fashion Show Mall towards Mandalay Bay, I was up to a light dinner. Secret Pizza was packed. So, I'd drop into New York -New York to finally try Sirrico's Pizza. I'd seen there sign advertising a slice of pizza with a beer for $7.77. However, I never saw the pizza up close. It did not look too appealing. Something about it sitting under the lights. The presentation of the food from the pizza to the pasta, reminded me more of Sbarraros than a legendary pizza parlor from New York. I opted out of pizza and ordered the meatball sub.

 When I ordered the meatball sub, the cook informed me that it would take five minutes. No sweat! I'd take in the detailed replica of Greenwich Village. I have always admired New York - New York's attention to the New York -New York motif from the steam coming out of a manhole cover to the balconies up above. Way above me, I'd overhear the careening Manhattan Express roller coaster. Down the cobblestone street, Billy Kraus belted out the classics in the Times Square Dueling Piano Bar. In a New York -New York moment time goes fast.

  The meatball sub failed to put me in a New York state of mind. It just wasn't very good. Honestly, the meatball marinara at Subway is better. I appreciated that they spent five minutes making the meatball sub. The upshot is that the cheese was hot and delectable. However, I had a below average opinion of the meatballs, which they did give a generous amount of. As I stated earlier in this review, the majority of the food is sitting in trays under lights. This includes the meatballs. When he made my meatball sub, it appeared that he took the meatballs from the tray and reheated it. The outcome was a sub made up of warm and tasty cheese with uninspiring meatballs on ordinary tasting bread. By the time I finished the meatball sub, it was obvious that I will ride the Manhattan Express before ordering it again.

  In conclusion, I understand  that New York-New York  and pizza go together like a horse and carriage. However, I believe that a world renown resort of New York -New York's stature needs a New York renown pizzaria.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,8,7,3,OU46XOOkU2MKnoShtzHoZQ

However, whenever I'm in Vegas and anywhere near NY NY hotel, I try to make it to Sirrico's. But I don't necessarily come away buying a slice of pizza. Let me explain. 

If you are absolutely craving any type of pizza and you see a long line, then by all means wait it out. But if there's no line, go to the counter and check out the pizza on display. Does the crust look pale and lifeless? Does the pizza look fresh? Or does it look like it's been sitting out for a couple hours, looking cold and limp? I don't know about you, but if I'm forking over $4-5 for a slice, and waiting in line, it'd better be worth it. I've had pizza in New York and in the east coast, and I know what I want. 

The key is to get a slice that is piping hot, straight from the oven. Look for the crust to be slightly charred, and should look crispy. Sometimes you'll ask for a sausage or mushroom, and the dude will give you their wannabe ""New York"" attitude and say they don't have any. Just brush it off. It doesn't matter, make a small sacrifice and just take whatever type of pizza that just came from the oven. Wait if you have to. Usually it's pepperoni.

Pizza is really good! It's so hard to decide sometimes which pizza to get! My favorite is the cheese pizza!",6tQloDMH5ZE6dl09n1a4BA,0,1,5,KDSiFf_iREwYjSh-sHvStg
5994995,2016-03-14,0,fXSOxjL7FP_sVew1gXnOIw,The first thing I like about this place is that they are open until 3am on Sunday. I was hungry late at night and there aren't many options after 10 or 11 usually on the strip.  We were going to try shake shak a couple doors down but the line looked long and I didn't want to wait (But we won't leave vegas without trying shake shak). I had the lasagna which comes with garlic bread and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the slice of pizza with beer deal ($7.77) and that was also good! I'm glad we came here to eat. (Located inside the NY NY hotel near the piano bar).,IfDIMGeHWWme-FFjsu_IKg,0,0,4,QUDkJeKwX2haBYHyagTNWw
