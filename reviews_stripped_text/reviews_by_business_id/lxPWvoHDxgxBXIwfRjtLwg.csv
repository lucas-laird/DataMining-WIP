I'm korean, the sushi is blah. the ddukbokki is good, decent - expensive tho! $13 for what should cost no more than $8/9. love the skewers.

there are rice bowls with meat - the portions are not super-sized, so if you're looking for quantity, this isn't the place.

nice chill (not crowded) place to come relax after rough day at work.

My family and I were in Vegas in june of 2012 for the weekend, came here after a night out - thought it'd be a nice fix for sushi. Really couldn't have been more wrong...

Service was horrible, the guys leading this place pay more attention to their friends than paying customers. Also, horrible at taking orders - missed about 3+ orders out of our group of 10. One of us didn't even get out order at all! And one thing, I myself ordered the Avocado lover roll; it's not even a roll! It's basically a big chunk of avocado! $13 for that was definitely NOT worth it. That order didn't even come until much later, the guy taking the orders said he ""didn't get that one"" when that was the first freaking thing I wanted in the first place! Shouldn't have even ordered it at all...

This place is overpriced and so unprofessional. We all hated it.",RCo1iic3w002AXCjnmn21w,0,1,1,tfD6ogI6h7e20-K-PoQ3Mw

Last night, a MASSIVE (12+) group of my friends and I headed to Zizzy's (also called Z2) after a few hours of pool and drinks at a PT's.  It's located right beside the Chinatown Mall, but is hard to spot because it's set back from the road in a strip mall, so look out for it!  We had to U turn to get in...  Parking was alright at 9pmish on a Friday night, but it's surrounded by several Korean and Chinese bbq joints so it may be more of an issue during dinner hours.  

When we first walked in, I was very impressed by the decor and feel of the place.  The windows and doors are all tinted very dark, so even with all the lights around it it was nice and dim.  They have a few tables and a bar in the front for those who just come to dine.  Overall it was very posh and tasteful.  

Our sever led us back to their largest room (room 2 is great for huge crowds!)  It was very dark in the room with a large bench sofa than ran three walls of the room and two large tables.  On the fourth wall was a huge entertainment center with a large flat screen in the middle, the song number puncher (if you can't find the remote...it really is dark!) and smaller screens.  After we all snuggled in, the soju and warm sake started flowing and the server kept it coming!  You can also order food and have it brought to your room.  We got an order of shrimp tempura, and they give a heaping pile of six or seven large shrimp instead of the three I usually see on a tempura appetizer.  I had a bite of one and it wasn't bland or dry like some places.  Veerry tasty if you are a shrimp tempura fan.

The majority of their karaoke selection is Vietnamese and Korean, but they did have a good collection of standard karaoke songs for Westerners like me.  Hit Me Baby, Dirrty, P.I.M.P, As You Are, Eternal Flame, and of course I Will Survive were just a few in our repertoire that night!  They provide you with two microphones but everyone was yelling so loud, thanks to Mr. Soju, that we didn't need more anyway.

The room runs around 25-30 bucks an hour.  The soju comes in around 13 bucks a bottle.  Dunno how much the sake or tempura was, but it totaled out around 25 or 30 bucks a person, and worth every penny.  I made new friends, tried new things, got GREAT pictures, and I will definitely be tagging along for the next outing at Zizzy's!",ScAkGG5VXHNpnMYsGtaadg,1,1,5,YSli5PXcvIA26qYCo1KMzA

The place is pretty cut and dry. There are karaoke rooms, there is a bar, there are restrooms. The rest is up to you! Their song choices are overall pretty decent, there were a few here and there that we couldn't believe they didn't offer. The videos, though as lots of people mention have absolutely no bearing on what song you're singing, were incredibly entertaining! I mean one of the stars in numerous videos was named Banana Girl...how can you not love that??!! Who needs American videos?

My only semi-complaint was that we weren't made aware of a button to get the waiter so we went out and got our drinks every time. Not the end of the world cause you get some fresh air but minus a star on customer service. The drinks aren't bargain basement but they're strong so who cares. A few margaritas, some Sapporo and you're all set!

Came here on a Wednesday night and it was $15 hour. SCORE!!! They didn't ask for a drink minimum, which is great! Though I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't a broader non-alcoholic drink menu. I know, I know...how does one sing karaoke without singing? Trust me, it can be done!!

The song selections, while fairly up-to-date, don't have the original music videos, but rather, Korean actors/actresses trying to dance/walk/sing/(insert verb choice) to the song. Still, a fabulous time was had by all and I would go back in a heartbeat if ever in town!!

The bar doesn't have karaoke, so you have to purchase a room. The rooms are extremely stuffy. The song choices are severely lacking. The books are mostly in Japanese (So not Americana friendly Karaoke), and the machine was broken, so we couldn't line up songs ahead of time. Had to enter them as soon as someone's song was done. In addition (And this is just me being a nitpicky Karaoke girl) the videos don't match what you're singing. There is just a long string of random videos that aren't connected to any song in  particular. So my friend is singing ""Like a Virgin"" and there is a video of a child playing a violin, while an old man looks on. **Awkward** LOL The only redeeming thing about this place was the food.",965QDYAn8jXQ9Wj7whuHsA,0,0,2,iywp68CupN82_hBj2-YleQ

I went there one evening around 8pm, which is usually not happy hour anymore, but Zizzy's happy hour is from 5 to 9pm, so that's awesome for people who have weird shift hours! :)

I ordered some sushi. I had to go up to the bar counter to order because the two waiting bartenders were busy texting and talking to each other. Nevertheless, I finally was able to make my order. Their sushi comes from Kaya, the Korean AYCE sushi house next door. As my suspicion was confirmed, they are both owned by the same owners. 

Sushi was pretty good. I ordered the salmon skin roll, Philadelphia (so I like cream cheese and salmon and no I'm not Jewish) roll, and the spicy tuna roll. I have had KAYA many times, so I knew it would be solid. 

Their yogurt soju was really yummy. It's slightly carbonated as they add 7-Up to liven up your taste buds. 

As I walked to the back for the restroom, I passed by some karaoke rooms and it looks like they have a large selection of Korean and English songs to choose from. The restroom was out of paper towels, so I air dried on my walk back. 

Although their drinks and their food were 4 stars, their service was very poor. There was no attention paid to our table, even when we were trying to give them money, we also had to go up to the bar to pay, but I know that's not the protocol because I saw them drop the check off at other tables.

we hopped in our car and off we drove through and out of the strip and found ourselves front of the large blue neon sign ""zizzy."" 

zizzy is a typical ktown karaoke bar/cafe. 
food: it was after 2am, and this girl's gotta watch her figure so food for me.
drinks: they also serve cocktails but i don't trust koreans with cocktails. soju ($13-14) and beer ($7/hite beer)  cost about $1 more than typical places in la ktown. fruit juice, coffee, and tea (typical cafe drinks) are also available. 
layout: there are about 6-7 tables with comfy chairs and a bar in the front. there are private karaoke rooms in the back.
atmosphere: dim lights... fobby kpop music... it should feel very familiar to you if you've been to ktown joints. 
""service"": service in a korean slang term here refers to free food or free alcohol served to keep the customers happy. they give dry salted peanuts as ""service'
karaoke: the small room costs $25/hr. the music selection is once again very typical (mostly Korean songs, some Japanese and limited English songs), but the sound system is horrible. 

now back to my story...
we sat at the lounge/bar section and ordered our drinks at first and then we decided to try the karaoke. two girls in a small karaoke room singing (it's more like yelling for me) our hearts out, dancing around the room, and shaking the tambourines for almost two hours... we definitely scared the waiters. as we were leaving, i saw their frightened eyes trailing us out the door.  

i would give this place 4stars but the disco light in our room was out and they didn't do anything about it. we asked if we could change our room since it wasn't a busy night and seemed like they had other rooms available but they told us that they didn't have anymore small rooms left and they refused to do anything about.

First we ordered the peach, followed by strawberry then Sonja suggested this flavor that tasted just like an Orange Creamsicle.  OMG!  So tasty and fun!  

I would definitely come here for their happy hour or just an evening on the town.  It's tucked back into a shopping center in China Town.  We didn't go for the karaoke rooms but it looked like they were filling up and people were enjoying themselves.

Looking forward to returning to this tiny but sweet bar!",NEN5RFpZp7DE6K1PK2KZzg,0,1,5,t9t8-TU1wwGMmMYl8NbBmA
4154976,2014-03-29,0,lxPWvoHDxgxBXIwfRjtLwg,Overpriced and not at all worth it for drinks. If you just want to do karaoke it's not too bad. Also it smells really bad in here not sure if they have plumbing issues.,KoZtrrJRH3ukUjciyi3sVQ,0,0,1,06lPbeJHwd5tJr1Y0m0XoA
4196581,2013-07-06,0,lxPWvoHDxgxBXIwfRjtLwg,"Went here for HH -- hours are 6-9. 

We really wanted to try their soju for HH and were not disappointed. For $7.50, the cocktail soju was served in Patron-sized bottles -- it probably was a Patron bottle, come to think of it. I've had better yogurt soju but you can't beat the price. I feel like it's a bit diluted though -- not much for the buck. 

We also ordered kimchi fried rice and the mussels, all delivered from the sushi place next door. (food violation, much?) The rice is a pass, but the mussels are delicious. It states only 3 pieces, but it's actually 5. Sweet deal for $2.50. 

We came at 7pm, and there was only one other party there. The bartender was more aloof than helpful, but nothing surprising for a Korean karaoke joint. My main problem was that it was 100+ degrees outside and it was not better on the inside. Even if there are only two parties in the room, please turn on the AC. It was really too hot to truly enjoy the food. 

Great place to hang out with a large group of people (hopefully with AC), I didn't smell any ""toilet smell"", excellent HH deals.",NBPrqIzMjWJ8zmfXUjjS5Q,0,0,3,oBM2QyVk1p0MiSQikZTEcQ
4286946,2008-03-27,3,lxPWvoHDxgxBXIwfRjtLwg,"We've been going to Zizzy's and Z2 for a few years now. Its conveniently located under the ever popular Ichiza. We're used to running that circuit. 

One of the cool things about this place is you can buy a bottle (of Johhny, Belvedere, whatever) and they'll locker it up for you for thirty days. So you pay for the bottle of booze and every time you come in, you just drink from that bottle, no more tabs (just tip!). Not that we've ever done that ... 

It was only recently that we began hitting up Zizzy's with a large enough crew to karaoke. 

The best thing about this place is they have private rooms. Not that I'm ashamed of wailing out in public. But its annoying hearing other people sing. I really don't care about people outside of my circle of trust. 

This place is the devil. Once the apple soju and Hite beers start a-flowin', they never stop. Its especially asinine coming after Sapporos and sake upstairs at Ichiza. And I think they strategically give you salty bar nuts so you keep drinking. I've grown accustomed to paying a $60+ share of the bill. But then again, we normally karaoke for an upwards of five hours. Karaoke is the new strip club. 

Their music selection is weird. They have some Journey (in my opinion, Journey is the ultimate karaoke music), one lesser known Bjork song, and a lot of Stryper. I don't know that they have much Viet songs (as another Yelper mentioned), but there's a lot of Korean and a some Japanese songs. 

The service is always friendly, but I recommend having a native Korean speaker in your group. Makes things easier. 

I leave when the sun comes up or my bf passes out, which ever comes first. Some how these two events seem to coincide.

4558300,2011-10-12,2,lxPWvoHDxgxBXIwfRjtLwg,"Seriously, how come I hadn't been here before?! This place is awesome!

Here's how it works: you pay a certain amount of money per hour (depending on the room size, but the lowest price is $15/hour). Each room has two mics, a tambourine, a very Korean keyboard for controlling the tv/karaoke system, and of course the awesome hardware. They have a lot of Asian music, but also a lot of cool American songs you know all the words to. Also, each room has a button you push to summon the bartender, who will very quickly return with your alcohol of choice. I had soju for the first time ever, and I loved it!

Anyway. They (of course) have Journey, Queen, Maroon 5... a bunch of stuff. And since it's private, the other rooms can't hear how crappy you sing! It's great!

The bar outside also seems to be really full-service, though I didn't stray from soju. And the shopping center it's in is really awesome, too, home to Ichiza and Kaya sushi. Win all around!",D-ZyQ4iT1XRFkcOAWXnxCQ,0,0,5,hQwFfno4ffQku4a31NWwLw
4620355,2010-07-10,0,lxPWvoHDxgxBXIwfRjtLwg,"My friends and I went here both before and after Ichiza one night. We were there before because Ichiza had a bit of a wait. We thought the place was pretty nice, so we came back afterward for some more drinks. OK the truth is, one of my friends had a thing for the bartender, so he insisted that we return.

We were only in the front bar area, but I understand there are karaoke rooms in the back. The front area is small and was empty when we were there. The bartenders are very nice and friendly, I'm not sure I would recommend the place based on my experience, but it's definitely a chill little bar.

4920563,2012-11-09,1,lxPWvoHDxgxBXIwfRjtLwg,"This is a hip and trendy little Korean karaoke/bar/lounge in the heart of China Town! Usually gets pretty packed on weekends with a mixed crowd! I would suggest coming for Happy Hour 5-9 (half off select food and drinks!) They get their food from over at Kaya Sushi so you know it's going to be pretty good! As far as drinks go.. definitely try the yogurt soju (served in a Patron bottle) taste yummy but can be deadly!!! Or have one of the awesomely HOT bartenders (Sonya, Young, Justin) whip up something special for you! So whether you want to rock out on the mic in a private room, get hammered at the bar or just meet some cool new people this place is a great choice!

Half expecting this place to suck, I was more surprise than ever. I love the room decor, happy hour prices (not sure why Yelp has this as $$$). Compare to SF prices, it is more like a $ ($7.50 an hour). The food/soju was also half off. We sang everything from ""Wild One"" to ""Don't Stop Believing"". One star was dock for the paper books. It should be computerized to save time from all that flipping. Also, one of the mikes needed to be charged so we only had one mike to use towards the end.

Apparently, without saying a word to us, they cancelled happy hour so nothing was half price.  Having such a great deal for so long, they really need to have this posted somewhere obvious because there is no way in hell we're going to spend $80 on a few drinks and appetizers.  Won't be going back there ever again which is sad because we always had a fun time.
