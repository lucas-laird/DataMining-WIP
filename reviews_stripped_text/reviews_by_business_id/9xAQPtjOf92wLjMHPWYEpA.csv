Service was good.  Bread/crackers good.  Water stayed full.  We ordered a burger, an asian chicken dish (good, but nothing too special), bbq chicken pita (decent, with homemade potato chips, again, nothing special), and crab cakes (appetizer, came with 5 about the size of golf balls, again, decent).  I had the burger and it was quite tasty.  Came with cheese (said gouda but I got cheddar, without knowing it), (awesome) bacon, tomato (salsa-like, nice touch), and a garlic aeole (couldn't taste).  Very tasty burger- would definitely get this again.  Got a really nice side of fruit with berries and mango.

Menu is mostly sandwiches/burgers, with a couple of asian dishes and some salads.  Kind of random I thought.  Great spot for a quite, though slightly spendy, lunch outing.  Total was around $70 (tip included) for the above mentioned items.",LR9E4bHOHnYnjLnUGYOV8A,1,1,4,jG2hOx3O9MsfBg_xWNADYA

I ordered the mushroom soup which was very oily and bland knowing that I had enjoyed the chicken chowder the last time made my mushroom soup all the more disappointing. For a main course I had the salmon and was again disappointed. The potatoes were fine, the green beans great and I really enjoyed the maple sauce it is served with but the salmon was dry and way over-cooked.

I stay at THE Hotel often and Cili is nearby.  If someone did not tell me about it, I would never have tried it on my own.  It is located in the club house of Bali Hai golf course just past the Mandalay on the Strip.

I believe it is connected with Wolfgang Puck, or had been in the past. In any event, the lunch menu is extensive, with a varied selection and well executed. Salads, burgers, soups, fish entres are all excellent. The setting is relaxed but not too informal.

I was the type of bride that was somewhat indecisive, especially on the little things (napkin colors, linens, etc). I showed Angel a few pictures on pinterest and he went above and beyond any expectations I ever had. We had about 185 people attend our wedding. The staff was quick to cater to everyone in a timely manner, which was so important to us. Every one of our guests felt special and a part of the big day.

From the beginning of the planning process to the end- the entire Cili staff were so incredible to work with. Sarah, Babette, and the whole staff took genuine interest and care of us. Cili is not one of those wedding factories that turns and burns weddings and forgets about you the next day- they took such investment in my wedding and it showed. I am beyond appreciative to the staff- as their friendliness, service, and attention to detail were top notch! I had around 200 (most out of town) guests who were absolutely raving about Cili! They truly had an experience that they will never forget- and of course the food was delicious!  If you are looking for a tropical paradise on the Las Vegas strip- look no further! Cili is the place to be! I cannot imagine my reception at any other place!

I ended up giving the fish & chips a try.  The fish was delicious, and the batter was nice & light.  I loved the remoulade that was served with the fish, although I lean towards malt vinegar mostly.  I was, however, a little disappointed with the bar quality fries/chips.  There were 3 small fillets of breaded fish next to a heaping mound of skinny, overly cooked fries.  Somewhere beneath the mound of starch lay a few tempura green beans and a small side of a tasty Asian style slaw.

1571056,2006-11-05,0,9xAQPtjOf92wLjMHPWYEpA,"This is based on a Wedding Reception that I was assisting on:

Two of my dearest friends were getting married and having their wedding and reception at Cili, which is on the Bali Hai Golf Course.
This place is beautiful. The atmosphere boasted an array of multi South East Asian designs combined with today's deco(r) of stressed stone, steel, woods, and hand crafted glass.
Cili seemed to spend a good deal of money on their floral arrangements, filling the restaurant with various orchids, and other exotic flowers and plants that give you the feel of being in the tropics. They also have a few paintings of images of Hawai'i. 
The staff is great. The floor manager was quick to assess and respond to the last minute changes we had. The staff worked very hard and quickly to set up the place; making it beautiful and elegant. 
While the bridal party was out taking pre-wedding photos, Cili's floor manager had sent to the bridal room,(where the Event manager and myself were using as our staging area), h'ors devours ; of fresh fruit, vegetables and cheeses, some fusion sushi, and fresh salsa with house made tortilla chips and crackers. They were delicious. I almost couldn't't stop eating, but I had to remind myself about dinner. Along with this, they made sure we always had a full bottle of San Pellegrino flat and soda water, plus a bottle of Champagne. I had a massive hang-over from the festivities the previous night, so I failed to get the name on the bottle. They brought some beer, wine, sodas, and other alcohol beverages to the wedding party and the people involved with the behind-the-scenes operations of this event.
After the wedding ceremony the guest were all escorted to a designated area, where they were served with cocktail and h'ors devours. This was out side of the restaurant, which was surrounded by a moat and the 9th and 18th hole of the course (I was earlier informed). I was able to witness the of the service staff here. They were professional, friendly and cordial. They were making it easy for everyone of the guest to enjoy the blissful event.
The entire course was designed as 18 single oasis's combined with paths to one another. The fees of the course start at about $375.00. This is a Pro-grade course.
While everyone was being escorted to theirs seats by the event-staff, the servers were making sure every one had drinks. One of my favorite things at a wedding reception is the open-bar! What makes it even better is that some one else is bringing you your drink.
The dinner was a buffet set up. Which, I always find it a thousand times better than a prefixed plate. Not only can you taste many different things, but you can eat till you die.

The menu: Spring Mix Salad, various types of steamed and sauteed vegetables, house backed rolls w/ garlic herbed butter, baked and mashed potatoes, baked chicken, salmon in a herbed lemon cream sauce, and my favorite prime rib.
(Now, I have been to 6 wedding in the last year and a half. The is the 2nd best meal I have since the first one in Hawai'i at Orchid's at the Halekulani Hotel.)
So when I say that this seemingly typical menu was far from typical, believe me. The chef and cooks of Cili have taken the common fare to the highest level. The vegetables were fresh and crisp, even the sauteed and steamed one. Nothing was over cooked or mushy. The roll as I have said were house made. The chicken and salmon were moist and delicious, the herbs and spices perfect. The prime rib; The BEST I have had in years!! I had to have another. I went back for a inch+ cut. Topped it with their delicious, spicy horse radish and hot full flavored ajous. Sadly though, my stomach ran out of room, and there was no more for a third cut.
The Cabernet that was being served at the table was great. Full flavored, full bodied, slightly spicy and dry. I could have sworn it was a Rhone. I didn't't get the name, but I did get a second glass. 
Later to be followed with Champagne, a Heineken, Fat Tire Amber, 2 shots of Patron, Corona, and more San Pellegrino. Don't worry!! hiccup, I'm fine!! Brup.
The cake looked wonderful and delicious. I couldn't't summon the will to eat another bite of food. 
Tea and coffee was served to the guest. What ever type of coffee it was, it near perfect. Not too heavy or too light. It really hot the spot after all that food. Which made way for the tequila and beer.
I was  coherent enough to recognize the great service that everyone received, and to notice as we were preparing to leave, the quick smooth disassembly reset-up of the restaurant. ""These guys are real pros"", I thought to myself.",h02t1zNqvg7uUC39WxzN2g,5,2,5,dWrYooS94lWZ2NmcB1Wpkg

It's located next to Mandalay Bay. The restaurant is open for lunch and dinner. Go and check before you go there because sometimes they close for private events. 

I went with my co-worker for lunch and we ordered combo satay and Kobe Sliders from the apptizers menu. My co-worker ordered the lobster and seabass with risotto and Thai salad as recommended by the server. I thought the satay was okay. I like how it's a bit spicy but not too much to burn your mouth. The peanut sauce is lame. I think it's from a jar. The Kobe slider burger was dissapointing. The sauce was way too much and covering the kobe beef taste. My co-worker thinks the lobster seabass is very good. The Thai salad is meh. Too much sauce and taste like soup instead of salad. I'd give 3 stars for the food. 

Service however, is perfect. The host greeted you right away and the server gave us recommendation and information for special of the day. They need to update their website as they are no longer have separate menu for lunch and dinner. Only one menu available. I'd give 4 out of 5 stars. 

Price is expensive for lunch. Starts at $12 for appetizer and about $20-25 for main entree. It is expected since this resturant is located in the golf course so they can upcharge with the right crowd. Nice golf course, it's green and clean. For the price range and food quality you get from ot, I'd give 3 stars out of 5.

It is now much more sandwich and salad intensive (the lobster cobb salad and smoked salmon salad are great). And, in the interest of getting more salad intensive, there's a horrible addition in the form of a smoked ahi taco salad, which I had earlier this week. Not only is the taco shell in which this salad arrives oily, but also there's no smoke in the ahi (in fact, it was very overcooked), and, because this salad is so unwieldy, it's pretty impossible to enjoy! The others at my table ordered the blackened chicken pita (average per the eater); the thai chicken salad (which was great but dripping in dressing); and the bali hai burger (great but not a great lunch option). 

Apart from the food, service is great, as are the views of the golf course from where you sit. And, I agree with the other reviewers that it's a pleasant break from the wackiness of the Strip.

The food is amazing!  The hors d'oeuvres were so delicious and even the simple lunch of a blackened chicken caesar salad was the best I have ever had!  Not to mention their wonderful mimosas.

Angel Kroenecke and the entire staff at Cili at Bali Hai truly provided my husband, guests, and I with the best day ever. Angel took my fairly vague ideas about what I wanted and spun it into stunningly beautiful place settings, tables, flowers, and venue. 

The bar was open and plentiful with attentive servers who never let a drink run empty. The food was delicious; many of my guests were foodies and said it was one of the best meals they've had.  

The officiant chosen by Angel was charming and funny; it seemed like he knew us forever. Everyone was in tears. The DJ got the music started and kept everyone pumped the entire reception. 

Did I mention this was the best day of my life? I couldn't have dreamt of a better day, everything went off without a hitch and I didn't have to worry about a thing.

I've popped by here a handful of times over the past year and a half to enjoy extended lunch with clients. The hostess and servers have  always been very attentive and welcoming. The atmosphere is upscale without being stuffy and the prices are very reasonable considering the venue (see pics of menu). 

I always order their Chicken/Steak Satay for an appetizer for the table - always super fresh and served on skewers stuck in a hunk of pineapple for an artsy presentation. Additionally, I always order their lobster cobb salad- Fresh diced mangos, cherry tomatoes, diced cucumbers, and hearty hunks of lobster. It's super good and you should come here just to gobble one up- YUM! Their desserts and bread basket are great. I've had their crème brulee and fresh seasonal berries with whipped cream (all very nice).

I decided to split two apps with a coworker, the seared ahi tuna and crab cakes. The tuna came with a delicious cucumber salad and three pieces of delicious, perfectly seared tuna. The 5 crab cakes were small but flavorful. 

Creme brulee was the perfect way to end our meal. The assortment of berries it was served with were all so fresh and very complimentary to the rich dessert. 

The service was top notch. I never had to wait for a refill on my Arnold Palmer, and they even brought out extra fries for another person in our party.

4094625,2010-11-25,2,9xAQPtjOf92wLjMHPWYEpA,"I go to Cili almost monthly for the AMA (American Marketing Association) luncheons. I have to say that this place is always on point with service and food. 

Right when I walk into the semi-private room where the lunch is held, servers always have ice tea or lemonade on trays ready for me as I walk in. But I'm a little difficult so order an Arnold Palmer and the server finds me and gives it to me. Then I find a seat, put my purse down and mingle with other AMA members. 

When the luncheon is ready to start, I go back to my table and the salad is already pre-set. Salads vary from a caprese, to melon salad, to arugula, and more. I'm always impressed by the variety and that it's not always that lettuce salad with yucky creamy dressing. 

Entrees also vary and I've had chicken cordon bleu, short ribs, and other standard lunch entree dishes. There will always be a protein, starch and vege with light sauce. The portions are generous. The meat is cooked properly. I've been on a less meat diet recently and the last time, I opted for the vegetarian dish. I think when people saw what I got, they wanted mine instead of their beef. 

Dessert is presented very well and delicious. From chocolate cakes with raspberry sauce (I devoured that one) to fruit salad with aged balsamic, it's consistently good. 

Besides the wonderful food, the staff is always professional and courteous. As I mentioned, they are there at the beginning with beverages, then during the salad with dressing, in between courses with water and beverage refills, after entree coffee and tea service, basically everything and everywhere. 

It may sound like this is all normal but for luncheon banquet staff to be always on top of it, that means management is fair and treats them well. Kudos to Cili management. I understand that their service reflects on guests coming back and I'm sold. 

Just like another Yelper mentioned, if I ever needed to have a party, I would not hesitate to book here.

The only downsides are 1) you have to drive/Uber/cab there as it is part of the Bali Hai Golf Club (you prob could walk from Mandalay/Delano/Four Seasons), but well worth it, especially if you are on your way in or out of Vegas, and 2) they only serve lunch.

This review would be more helpful for people planning something like a reception at this restaurant, not so much for people just stopping in for a meal.

The first course was a mixed greens salad with cherry tomatoes, and an assortment of breads served with pineapple butter.  
The salad tasted fine, but the greens were definitely bruised (a commonly occurring phenomenon when someone tries to toss a ridiculously large amount of lettuce in one huge bowl).  The breads were delicious, and the butter wasn't obnoxiously pineapple-flavored.  I still think plain butter would have made more sense.
The second course was a choice of chicken with a cheddar potato cake served with green beans and garlic sauce, or beef with parmesan risotto served with asparagus and a red wine sauce.  
My boyfriend and I split both, and overall they were pretty good.  The worst tasting thing was the chicken.  It was well-seasoned, but way too dry.  Everything else was good, but not really amazing.
Dessert was creme brulee with fresh berries.  I was really excited about it, because I love creme brulee, but this was probably the saddest one I've ever had.  Someone else at the table said that it was more like vanilla pudding, and I absolutely have to agree.  The consistency, and flavor were way off.
Overall, it was a fun dinner, and a good meal.  However, at this price point, I think you could find a restaurant that's more consistent with their preparation of dinners in bulk.  
I would be curious to try this place in normal circumstances.  I'm sure the food would be a lot better without quite so much pressure to crank everything out at the same time.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,2,1,3,QoI-VPBVOgSTNhYKG06uFg

It was a top-notch event that met my daughter's hopes and dreams, and garnered glowing comments from our guests.

The setting is gorgeous with the tropical golf course backdrop and patios, and the interior spaces (entry hall, reception/bar area, dining room) are expansive and luxurious. The indoor-outdoor layout can accommodate any weather conditions. The dining room was beautifully appointed with high-end linens and place settings. The floral arrangements were beautiful and a perfect match to my daughter's vision.

Cili provides an all-inclusive service that covered the service, cocktail hour, dinner, and dancing, along with the previously mentioned excellent florist. The food was delicious, beginning with the plentiful appetizer selections picked by the couple, and on to dinner that was on par with any fine dining experience in Las Vegas. The entree selections were raved about by the guests (my sea bass was great!) and the presentation was wonderful. We had a mixed drinking and non-alcohol crowd, but everyone's glass was kept full by the amazing servers. There were plenty of servers both for cocktails as well as dinner and they provided first-class attention while being personable and fun. Also fun was the included DJ, who ensured that special wedding elements (first dance, etc) were conducted and encouraged guest enjoyment in an engaging but not obnoxious manner.

So the event itself was outstanding in every way. But from my perspective, also important was the planning experience. Tracy Horn, the catering sales manager, coordinated the planning and was a joy to work with. She is professional, competent, a great listener, and fun. Tracy was able to accommodate our desires (you have a lot of control over the layout, food, music, flowers, etc) and also suggested and arranged for aspects we would not have thought about. Plus, she personally ensured that everything ran smoothly on the day of the wedding. You can rely on her completely.

Everything about our experience with Cili was positive. Costs were fully and accurately disclosed, and we believe we received excellent value for every dollar spent. It is really astounding that for such a large affair (we rented the entire space and had about 100 guests), I can truly think of no negative at all.

Then  I was forced to pay 20% gratuity,- when the service provided deserved no more than 10%.  I brought my clients here for a business luncheon and was embarrassed that I chose Cili for this luncheon.  Calamari was super salty.  Shrimp in Shrimp Tempura tasted bad.  It's a shame that someone doesn't have to provide excellent service because they know they will get 20% gratuity (no matter what type of service is provided),- simply because of the size of the party (which was 8 people).  I will never return to this restaurant again.  The one bright side was the level of service from the car valets.  They were friendly, very welcoming and efficient.",-K9RaftVYrQMY6ExNbsuTA,0,0,2,98d7VhoFxjjO3DyH0dhKQQ

Cili is located at Bali Hai golf course, almost directly across from the ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" sign on South Las Vegas Blvd.  It is definitely best to enter the property while heading south on LVB (exit the freeway at Russell Road and turn right), as I came from the opposite direction and traffic was NUTS!  

The restaurant hosted the Southern Nevada Hotel Concierge Association Choice Awards Gala, so they closed down for the private event.  There is valet parking and self parking available.

We entered from the backside of the restaurant, where the patio is located.  It (and the restaurant itself) have an awesome view of the golf course, and the patio also has ceiling fans to help with the heat.  It is glass enclosed, but I am unsure if that space is air conditioned in the sweltering summer months.

There were passed appetizers and drinks during the reception portion of the event.  Some of the appetizers were jumbo shrimp (HUGE), individually served and topped with cocktail sauce.  Also, meatballs on a stiick which were very delicious.  There was also some sort of fried mashed potato thingy, which had a spicy kick to it and were really good.  Lasty, I remember seeing a sausage appetizer, which was also tasty.  There was red/white wine, a great selection of beers (Magic Hat #9), and a really delicious signature drink, which we were told was made with blood orange vodka, grape juice and some other stuff.  It didn't taste like alcohol, which is always dangerous!

This is definitely a perfect place to host a private event or wedding reception.  The set up of the room was great, and there is enough room for a lot of people (there were appx 200 people at this event).  The decor was beautiful and the service was a highlight of the night!

Our dinner was pretty amazing.  The first course was an heirloom tomato and fresh mozarella salad with baby greens, olive oil and balsamic reduction.  I can't believe this was just the start - the portion was huge!  And everything was really good.

The entree was braised boneless beef shortribs with garlic potato puree & seared sea scallop with sauteed swiss chard and blackberry pinot noir sauce.  The meat was pretty much to die for.  It didn't need a knife it was so tender.  The scallop was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and swiss chard were great accompaniments.  I did hear that they offered vegetarian options for those who requested them.

Lastly, dessert!  We were served dark chocolate mousse torte and white chocolate drizzled raspberry cream puff.  I am not a big chocolate eater, so my torte pretty much went untouched, but the cream puff was super delicious!!  It was light and airy and not overly sweet.

As I said previously, the service was the highlight of the evening.  At no point were our drinks even close to empty, and everyone's meals were served about simultaneously.  Everyone I encountered was very friendly and offering help in some way.

I definitely want to come back in the future and try the full menu, and I have a friend getting married next year - you better believe I recommend she have her reception here!",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,1,5,knC2QPBu1eoruO-ZO5sAEA
5736584,2013-10-30,2,9xAQPtjOf92wLjMHPWYEpA,"5/11/15 update - I wanted Mrs. C and Baby C to experience Cili, so it was our last meal before heading home.  The patio was really nice & the shrimp cocktail is not to be missed!  The whole chilled shrimp hanging off a wine glass with cocktail sauce in the glass has been done to death.  Cili's version is DELICIOUS with the shrimp sitting on a bed of chilled sushi rice, and it is straight up amazing.  Get this appetizer & thank me later.

On my way in from Los Angeles, I needed a quick lunch & didn't have time to stop anywhere else.  I really enjoyed my lunch at Cili, but maybe that's because it was the one time out of the year where I guessed correctly on what would be delicious on the menu.

First of the all, the prices at Cili are extremely reasonable.  Most salads & sandwiches are in the $12-$15 range, and I don't think anything on the menu was over $25.  I thought it might be more expensive, given the cost of the golf here, but that was not the case.  I ordered a Mediterranean salad & satay skewers, & both were excellent!  The satay skewers were a mix of beef & chicken, elegantly presented on a cut pineapple with a few vegetables thrown in.  It also came with 2 sauces & I couldn't make up my mind which one tasted better, because both were so dang good.  One was a red curry sauce, and one was a ginger/soy sauce.  Just cut your meat in half & try both.  You can't go wrong.

The Mediterranean salad was also good with a nice mix of greens, feta cheese, olives, tomatoes, etc.  But the one thing that I thought was particularly clever was that the croutons were toasted pieces of pita bread.  Why haven't I seen this in other greek salads?  It's such a great idea!

Four stars for good service & good food that doesn't break the bank.",m8nDqQ7a3zQWfkNK1_vwnQ,3,3,4,qlSbytQqEU_UWXKUKvwGpQ

We used to go to Miralago out at Lake Las Vegas for the ambience and relaxation, but since it closed we have been on the hunt for new places.  Cili delivers, with a large outdoor patio, and top notch staff.",Cm3jrFTO6vQghQMc52MDvQ,1,0,5,KeMvH9M8Vl6mLxa1iTjU_g

The food was Very good and the new menu offered a variety of selections.  Afterwards when leaving my Mom had a dizzy episode and the young men outside were very helpful helping us get her in the car.  We so appreciated this kindness after such a nice lunch experience..
