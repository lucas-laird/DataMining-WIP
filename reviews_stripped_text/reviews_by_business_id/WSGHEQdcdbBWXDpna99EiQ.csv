488292,2015-08-02,0,WSGHEQdcdbBWXDpna99EiQ,"My husband and I ordered two entrees and two egg rolls to go at this location. When we got home and bit into the egg rolls we discovered they tasted bad, like chemicals, and we couldn't eat them. We went with bad rolls in hand to get our money back for the defective food and was informed they do not give refunds. The cashier said she was not allowed to give money back and would have to call the manager. The manager then said the same thing, no refunds. While they offered two new egg rolls we did not want them because we feared they would taste the same and we were turned off eating them by how bad the first ones were. When we stated we did not want replacement food but just our money back they said there was nothing they could do for us and then effectively ignored us. It's not about the four dollars lost, it's about the rudeness and lack of customer service. When something is inedible you should be able to return the product and get your money back, not have to accept something that could still taste badly so you no longer want it.

The basic beef teriyaki is sliced thin and in a generous portion.  Very flavorful with a good balance of the teriyaki flavor without drowning out the meat which is always nice and lean served on top of a bed of rice.

969082,2013-06-21,3,WSGHEQdcdbBWXDpna99EiQ,"T-MAD.  Don't be MAD at it...embrace it!  I love this place and yesterday I went way out of my way to curb my craving...sometimes you just gotta do it.  It was quite worth the drive.  I don't usually visit this location because I'm a Centennial girl and frequent that location but I've been to this one a couple time before.  This one seems a little older and not as freshly decorated and modern as the one in Centennial.

Upon entering the place was pretty busy as it was like 1:30 in the afternoon.  There was a cute young girl at the front ready to take my order.  I ordered the chicken breast plate extra spicy with a side of the mac salad....my usual and full intentions on make 2 meals out of it.  The ""plates"" are huge and I would never order it if I didn't have intentions on having leftovers.  I would just order the bowl and even the bowl is big.  A lot of the reviews I've read rave about ordering your food spicy.  It really is so good if you like spicy.  I wouldn't want it any other way.  I believe you can order any of their dishes spicy for an additional charge.  Do it!  Occasionally I will change it up and order the steak yakisoba which has such an amazing flavor.  You cant go wrong with that either.

While I was waiting on my food to be prepared the girl who took my order took full advantage of in between customers to clean tables.  She was all over it.  I love hard workers especially young people.  Nice to see. 

As she brought my order out to me I asked her if there was some Sriracha packets and fully expecting her to point me in the right direction she said to wait a second and she would get me some.  I don't know why stuff like that suprises me!  Probably because we live in such a lazy world!  Funny but not funny.   Anyways great customer service.   I like it.  I ordered my lunch to go and could barely wait to get back to the office.  It was great-as always.  Yummay!  ...and I have leftovers for today!

1163592,2010-12-15,2,WSGHEQdcdbBWXDpna99EiQ,"Its a good try at a good teriyaki place. I went here twice, figuring that maybe the first time I just came on the wrong day. Sadly enough I feel like I spent way to much money for what I got.
For $6.50 I got fried (unseasoned) tofu and rice. That's it. I even had to put on my own teriyaki sauce! I could have made this at home! So the second time I got the tofu stirfry and was suprised to get unseasoned tofu on a bed of cooked cabbage. Not exactly the vegtables I was thinking of.
The reasons they do get 2 stars is their service is amazing, their teriyaki sauce is amazing, and the restaurant was clean!

Had the two protein plate since I wanted to try both beef and chicken and this meal was good for 2. The beef was tasty but felt dry and it was sliced super thin. Spicy chicken was so juicy and flavorful and hit the right amount of spice and it didn't overpower the teriyaki flavors.

Plainly said, it SUCKED.

I ordered the Spicy Chicken Plate with no vegetables, and WOW, I have not tasted such garbage in a long time. I know that it doesn't necessarily take much to make chicken spicy, but they could have been more creative than just pouring syriachi sauce on the meat and stir-frying it. It tasted like that was the ONLY seasoning on the meat. 

I have to also mention that the white rice was crunchy, and the macaroni salad was so runny it reminded me more of potato salad. Just nasty.

For quick Asian eats, check out the aforementioned Panda Express, because even the Samurai Sam's has gone down hill in this area.",UAF1qKkTIcZOVpx0lhU3gA,2,0,1,MUH5Oxgw5K42dvB9LkrhKw

 We just moved here from California and love teriyaki joints like Waba Grill, and we were hoping to find something similar here in Vegas. Well we got a flyer in the mail for a buy 1 get 1, so we decided to come in and try Teriyaki Madness.

My first impression was that it was a little trendy looking, which isn't necessarily bad. I also noticed that there were quite a few people in there for it being a Wednesday. The place looked clean and staff looked friendly. 

We were greeted by Yuliana (Julie) who was super friendly. I told her it was our 1st time at Teriyaki Madness, and she offered to answer any questions we may have. She was super attentive and definitely paid attention, so I didn't have to repeat any part of my order. She was great. 

The food was really good. A lottttt of rice, but only  an average serving of meat. Great amount of veggies. The teriyaki beef was my favorite from the 3 meats I tried. The other 2 I tried were chicken teriyaki and chicken Katsu. Both good, but the beef was amazing.

I came on a Saturday at 12pm, no line and about 3 tables in the decently sized restaurant. I was greeted by the cashier immediately and ordered a Spicy Chicken teriyaki bowl (7.49) with brown rice (no additional cost, that's a first!) and stir fried vegetables.

The menu is simple. You can choose between a bowl or plate, your choice of protein (chicken teriyaki, spicy chicken teriyaki, chicken breast teriyaki, beef teriyaki, orange chicken, chicken katsu, tofu teriyaki, a base of your choice (white rice, brown rice, or all veggies (no extra cost) or noodles or fried rice (additional $1.00). For a bowl you get stir fried vegetables and for a plate you can choose between fresh green salad, macaroni salad or stir fried vegetable.

I probably only had to wait about 8 minutes for my order to be taken out to me. The chicken was tender, moist and nicely marinated however I was not a fan of the spicyness and taste of the chicken. After taking the first bite, I admired the quality and tenderness of the chicken but immediately regretted my selection. Next time I come I will probably just get the regular chicken teriyaki and spice things up with the Siracha they have at every table or get a salmon bowl.

The chicken was spicy with spice level just about right for my taste, not too hot and not too mild. The shrimp tempura was good also, it was hot and crunchy. My daughter had the kids meal with teriyaki chicken, she didn't enjoy it as much because there was too much teriyaki sauce on it but overall everything was good.",G5HJ8ojD6Dx515m-eJYaXQ,0,0,4,Zwfym_fExCBGWb2-F1x8wg

Kisha wanted something healthier, and fast, which as you all know rules out a ton of choices. I jumped on Yelp and found this gem...Teriyaki Madness....where have you been all my life??? 
I've driven by this place tons of times and never even noticed...I've gotten doughnuts from Pinkbox and never batted an eye...shame on me!!! Yelpers hit it on the head. The food here is awesome!! I ordered the Chicken Katsu, Kisha and Kylie went with Teriyaki Chicken and Chase had the Orange Chicken. 
You know a place is good when no one touches their phone and all talking ceases for minutes. The Katsu was bomb!!! Super crispy on the outside, and hot, juicy and flavorful. The steed rice and Stir Fry Veggies that came with it were equally awesome. I tried some of the Teriyaki Chicken as well and it was delish. 
The prices were reasonable and you get what you pay for and then some. Serving size was well worth the $8 and change I paid. Will I become a regular here? Most definitely!",hnhTHPE9_6OQrEZocNw4gQ,0,0,5,AjhdMtcn6D_SbQjT5bmjGw

I also added a side of the shrimp tempura, and they were good as well. Didnt really care for the dipping sauce that it came with. It was like a really thin watered down teriyaki tasting sauce. It wasn't horrible, but I would have preferred a thicker textured sauce for dipping. I'll probably try steak or chicken next time.",px8P3jO0Jgr_Amwdvo-vuw,3,1,5,JirdiVDK-gn8drHM91rhQw

Staff was helpful and friendly. Vibe was casual, laid back. 

Ordered the Chicken Breast platter, veggies instead of rice and side of green salad.

Minus 1 star as chicken was slightly overdone, but not too bad. Just have pet peeve about chicken being on dry side. Veggies were average with moderate crunch and very small green salad.

This place is alright, but I prefer Flame Broiler.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,3,3,4,gjY6a1TBjzZyalDQwWD7HA

5574064,2014-03-28,0,WSGHEQdcdbBWXDpna99EiQ,"Of all the Teriyaki Madness locations I've been too (like 3-4), this has been my favorite. I regular this place on my lunch breaks at work and every single time I've been there, the customer service was awesome. The people behind the counter are friendly and know what to ask you, as well as how to ask it. They also smile, which is a bonus. I hate when I go to food places and see people that look like they want to strangle somebody. Sad days. 

If there aren't that many people, the transaction from ordering to getting your food is usually super fast and they are always willing to give you more of their delicious teriyaki sauce. I don't know what they put in that stuff, but gosh darn it, it's amazing. It does tend to get busy at around 12-1 p.m. though when most people have lunch. I haven't had anything on their menu that I didn't like, however, I can say, that their gyoza is misleading. It's more like a gyoza shaped eggroll then ACTUAL gyoza. Oh well, the little things. 

All and all, love this location. The best in my opinion,. If you live on that side of town, go there. Be mad. T-Mad. :3",1hJVutieYDBwGx8INWv3IA,0,0,5,OJdlb8RHVj-S4-fDeCquLw

Food is amazing!!unfortunately service is very hit and miss. I probably eat here once a week and today I waited for almost 40 min for my food. People who ordered after me ate and left before my food even came out. When I went to tell the cashier she was annoyed and told me they didn't forget about me and my food jus wasn't ready yet. She didn't apologize until she brought my food out. And she forgot a side order and when I mentioned that she again got annoyed! The sad thing is I think she's the manager. Maybe she's having a bad day.. idk but the food is worth 5 stars but the service is 2 stars. I'll jus order to go from now on!,AOsi2jaSvA_GHBvwOGaQ1w,0,0,3,s8s4SCDiP80U9Lj3Jav7DA

Only complaint was the veggies were not drained well so the bottom was a little soupy. If I had rice I'm sure it would have soked it up. Complimentary sriracha is always good in my book too.

Also the crab Rangoon. The Teriyaki sauce is practically to die for. OMG. Could eat it with a spoon. Chicken was nice and tender. The veggies were cooked perfectly, still had a bit of bite to them. I put just a touch of the Teriyaki sauce on them too, because I couldn't get enough of it, lol. 

Crab Rangoon were very tasty. Preferred them plain than with the sauce, they were that good. 

Only thing I didn't care for was the salad. It was just OK.   Service was very fast and friendly, and everything was correct with our order.",ER4VikNscGAqk8O2pX61WQ,1,0,4,FmN_4DxtSvIcIsuPKUE68A
