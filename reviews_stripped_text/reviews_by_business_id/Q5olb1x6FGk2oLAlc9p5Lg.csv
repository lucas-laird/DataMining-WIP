We went for drinks, appetizers and dinner.  The drinks were okay.  Some of our martinis were only 2/3 full.  The appetizers were fabulous, crab cakes, shrimp and ahi tuna...no complaints at all.  Dinner was sea bass and those awesome potatoes au gratin.  Not a big fish fan so it would be unfair to judge but my husband loved the seabass.
The staff was spot on with the service. Lots of staff around and very pleasant.  i would return.",R2r-X5ClWFQk8KPKow-Q1g,0,0,4,Zpa_x5hwYAt-tnE3TVsD2w

The bread was amazing! Had the mahi special which was delicious.  The service started off really well and slowly started to decline due to the large party that our server had to attend to.

Not fresh or flavorful . The complimentary bread was the only thing worth eating . 
Never again. Would not recommend . 
4 stars for this place is very deceiving. If you want to go to a restaurant where everything tastes the same, this is your spot. If you are a foodie this place is not for you.",aahxmN1tsvlufuU_y4OT1A,1,0,1,rN4S8qcMO4nYfd524rFc9g

89529,2015-06-08,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"My husband and I came to this one very often, mainly for their grilled rib eye and burger. Sometimes I will order their regular grilled trout too. So we mostly get these three, very stable, and that's how I can say that their quality has been very consistent. 
We always order our food well done. And they are able to wood fire grill our food (including steak, fish and burger) to well done without burning them. There is char, but not burnt. That's a very very admirable thing and please keep up the good work. 

There was only one time so far that they made a mistake on our burgers, it was underdone (we wanted them well done). They humbly acknowledged the mistakes and fixed it for us. The manager would even come out to apologize and gave us a coupon for the bang bang shrimp as a gesture of apology. It was very professional and good work ethics. We didn't end up using the coupon because we are allergic to shrimp. But we admire and appreciate the gesture, so we keep going back after that mistake. Mistakes don't happen often anyway too, that was the only one mistake we experienced out of numerous visits. 

I don't know if they age their steak, but I don't really care for those long aging taste anyway, and I don't feel that their steak is aged, I like the texture of the rib eye they offer, soft and tender, good quality.

The staff are all courteous and friendly. There was one particular young waiter that we really like. I think his name is Cameron according to the receipts. He is easy to make conversation with, and he gives good service and also very energetic and has good work ethics. 

Please keep up the good work. I really like this restaurant. I like this one so much that I didn't even care about visiting the other location on Charleston as I want to keep having this good image of Bonefish by only coming to this one in town.",gm8nNoA3uB4In5o_Hxpq3g,0,0,4,cPnG-kUbNwIgcx85lrPadg

164646,2014-08-15,4,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Gave this a 2nd go a few weeks back.  I wish I had something better to report. 

We ordered the lobster tail special & bang bang shrimp. Just like my initial review, my meal was okay.  Lobster tail was okay. It could have been better. Not the freshest or tastiest - I've had worse. It was obvious it sat in the pass longer than it should have.  It arrived room temperature, not hot, but not cold either. It was served on the shell; I was able to manipulate it without burning my fingers on the shell. Mash wasn't great...again, room temp.  Bang Bang shrimp was ok. The sauce its tossed in is too creamy for the amount of batter these are fried in. 

I've spent a good amount of time trying to figure out what it is about this place that doesn't sit well with me. I think I figured it out. 

Atmosphere? Great
Service? No complaints. 
Food?  For a seafood place, the menu confuses me; it just seems heavy. Too much batter on the fish & chips & bang bang shrimp.  Too many ""fried"" options...and burgers, & I recall a steak?

During my last visit a plate was brought out to a nearby table. The smell alone made me ill. When I realized what it was I vowed not to come back. BROCCOLI by CHEF MIKE!!  You DO NOT MICROWAVE BROCCOLI.  You steam it, sauté it, serve it raw but you never nuke it. Not only does it kill the nutrients but it stinks to high heaven. Seriously makes me wonder what is going on in the kitchen...in a Gordon Ramsay Kitchen Nightmares kind of way. 

I know this review may read a bit bipolar, but Bonefish kinda is. I really wanted to like this place...I really did. Subpar food & confusing menu vs. Great atmosphere & nice staff. The broccoli though....killed it for me.",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,4,1,1,F_F_7EYGWOIcQ28HMm3Hpw

308130,2015-12-06,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,Based on service alone this was the worst I have ever experienced in Vegas. I'm a local here and don't expect to be treated any different. The food took almost an hour to get out to us along with the drinks. We waited for almost 45 minutes for just the ticket to pay. We were in the restaurant for over 2 hours. Waiting. We were told  there was an issue with the system. Then we were told that the system went down. Then the waitress made a snide comment that because someone in our group of 7 moved to another seat that it ruined everything in the system. The surrounding tables all paid and left long before we even got our ticket. It's the worst service I've ever had. The food wasn't worth the cost either. It was severed incorrect to almost every person who ordered. Medium burgers come out as charred. No gluten means everything is served with gluten. And if you want warm food forget it. It was like eating food fresh out of the freezer. Ice cold. And to top it off no sorry from the manager. I wouldn't suggest eating here unless you are waiting for the world to end because that's about the amount of time you'll sit waiting for your food and ticket,fqEidPjUarV52QxVwrr8fg,0,0,1,8DyEcUvby4rnUPuiXCGQhA

When finished, We asked for our check and once he dropped it off, he disappeared. I was going to pay on the card but after waiting too long I chose to pay with cash and leave a less than satisfactory tip.

We went at 6.30pm on a Friday, and tried ordering the special... ""We're out of the special"", so my wife ordered the seabass that happened to be more expensive than the special, but asked for the pasta that was described on the special. So the bill comes, and they charge an additional $5 for the pasta, in addition to the $25 for a piece of fish! Annie never told us about the charge when ordering, then argued when we disputed the $5 charge. I gave her my credit card, the check comes back for signing, but with no adjustment! Then she has this attitude and slams the check back on the table and says (in a very sarcastic voice) ""have a nice night you two""

719080,2013-04-30,1,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Writing this review was tough. I want to like, even love this place but I just can't seem to get over the unpleasant experience we had. Lets get started. 

We came here because some of our friends said the food here was great. I'm always excited when friends rave about a new place. Upon entering, I was quite impressed. The hostess was friendly and the atmosphere was open and very trendy. What a great start, or do I thought. 

We found our group and sat down. As we were chatting, this lady shows up and stands by our table and doesn't say anything. When we finally greeted her, we found out she was our server. She didn't even say her name or hello, just a 'can I get you something to drink?' We ordered some drinks and they took a really long time to arrive, one by one. Not a very good sign.

Ordered our food and hoped for the best. Here's what's on the menu:

APPETIZERS:
Ceviche: good, not great. The fish seems like they were already cooked before everything was tossed together. The overall dish lacked flavor. It was precooked fish, scallops etc. tossed with lemon and avocados. The avocados gave the dish some flavoring. Not my favorite and will not be having it here again. 

Bang bang shrimps: This dish is great to those that love mayo. It was good, I don't know if I would give this dish 5 stars. It over dressed and reminds me of having walnut shrimp at a Chinese buffet. 

Caesar salad: Nothing too special here either. Both of your salads were overdressed and soggy. Not very appealing, especially when it seems like the dressing wasn't even made in house. 

ENTREES:

Shrimps and scallop, mango salsa and green beans: To my surprise this dish was good. The scallops were cooked nicely and well seasoned. The shrimps were a bit undercooked so I didn't eat them. And my green beans were no longer green but brown, so I didn't eat those either. 

Fish tacos: These were very good. Fresh and light. There's only two tacos so if you're hungry, order two orders. 

Salmon and asparagus: salmon was flaky and not over cooked. Asparagus on the other hand were soft to the touch and brown. 

Sea bass: I didn't try this dish but it did get great reviews at the table. 

The food here isn't bad, but it also not amazing. But then again, what are you expecting from a chain restaurant? What would have made our experience better was the service. Our server was not friendly, didn't seem to know the menu items and it was slow and completely unorganized. Everything about the service aspect of this restaurant is unorganized. 

They have a concept call ""team work"" here. This is when the team/staff needs to help each other by delivering food and clearing the table etc. this is a nice idea, except no one at this location seems to know how to do it. Drinks came one at a time. Coffee came one at a time. By the time we got our coffees, the rest of the table had already finished theirs and was waiting for us. Our table wasn't clear of all the empty appetizer plates before dinner got dropped. Our server failed to be a decent server. I'm sure if I went to Denny's, the server there would have done better job. Such a waste of a restaurant space. Bonefish has a lovely room and prime location but the staff is a joke. 

I would recommend this place to people under the circumstance that they just sit at the bar. Here's a tip that I live by, PEOPLE COME FOR THE FOOD BUT COME BACK FOR THE SERVICE. Get it together bonefish. Look at your entire staff and start picking out the weeds or you'll be packing your bags and leaving not just henderson, but Vegas, for good. 

Happy eating everyone, ciao :)",hgGRHZsGPPoVD3JXBwEr6Q,3,1,3,F918UvYcRs1jsgpMVkaPgQ

So was looking forward to a second time. However, it was a letdown and makes me not want to rush back for a third time.  The bang bang shrimp themselves have no flavor, but that's what the sauce on it is for. The complimentary bread they offer is wonderful, especially when freshly baked and warm. Even better with some balsamic vinegar in the olive oil. Most of the appetizers and entrees seem about $1-3 overpriced. 

Our server was adequate, but no real enthusiasm. During the time we went, there must have been an issue with the grills or the kitchen itself because for about 40 minutes, no entrees seemed to be coming out of the kitchen. The surrounding tables were all waiting for food as well. Things happen, which is understandable. However, our server never kept us updated or apologized for the long wait. Between the time our appetizer of bang bang shrimp and wagyu beef potstickers and our actual entrees was close to 50 minutes.  But again, the whole time there was not a peep from our server or communication as to why food was taking so long to arrive.

Just felt like they didn't care at all how long we had to wait for food. So not exactly jumping at the chance to return.",XYSMRBNxdOOvJCkWyCZUfw,0,0,3,rUR-glyMpcShNdlnWAWRvw

In Las Vegas as you know there are many many choices and good restaurants to go to and I choose the bonefish Grill, sadly it was a complete mistake!!!

When we first walked through the door there was The strong odor of fish and it wasn't a good odor!

We had made a reservation and I was really surprised at how few people there were at the restaurant even during the hour we were there

Appetizers came first calamari and the mussels. The calamari was excellent but the muscles had somewhat of a fishy taste and yes I know it's seafood but I get muscles all the time that don't taste like this. In spite of it we ate the mussels but not all of them. 
It was Friday so we specifically came here for Fish being a Catholic family and it being Lent. I opted for the crab crusted cod with green beans and potatoes au gratin.  My wife had the Rockefeller cobia with potatoes and broccoli.

She said her fish was decent,  she wasn't thrilled with the broccoli and the potatoes tasted like they came out of a box.  the crab crusted Alaskan cod had zero taste it was extremely bland I ended up having to get some of the dipping sauce from the calamari to pour on it

I originally ordered an iced tea and my wife ordered a cocktail her cocktail came out one before my ice tea when I finish my tea I had to ask two different people one of them twice for an iced tea. I also asked for better for my Green Bay which they immediately forgot. When I finally did get the butter which was after I decided to eat no more of the cod or the potatoes I could barely cut the green beans with a butter knife they provided in the green beans were hard and crunchy

The only two things good about the meal with the calamari and my wife's cocktails.

Despite the restaurant being very empty, for some reason I did not get my food until a couple minutes after the rest of our table.  My friend ordered fish and chips with vinegar but the vinegar did not come out with the food, and the waitress did not check on us so he was stuck nibbling on fries for 5 minutes until he could flag her down.

Food - I ordered the rockfish with a pesto sauce on it, and broccoli as the side.  The fish was slightly larger than a goldfish, and came with 5 or 6 small broccoli florets.  The portions were definitely too small and most of my plate was empty.  Normally I couldn't care less about presentation but a plate that was 75% empty space really left me wanting more.  The broccoli was delicious, but that's the only part I enjoyed.  If I had boiled a piece of chicken breast in plain water it would've had more flavor than their rockfish.

I'm very disappointed. we ordered, the famous bang bang shrimp, Chilean sea bass big order and the shortcake dessert. so.. the shrimp was ok, I felt like it was overrated.. I've tasted and tried a lot but these were definitely not the best or my favorite.. the sea bass was alright but it lacks flavor and kick.. the plating was also lacking... the dessert was just ok. nothing to be excited about.. overall 3 stars for friendly staff and cleanliness. the waitress tools little time even though it's not busy at all.. they are accommodating. I have my strollers and babies.. so that's always a plus! anyways, it might take a very long time for me to go back to this restaurant.",SM0Xp-MXq-afA-wZ8qkk5g,0,0,3,9nYWWvd9Tm_l3PLBNx0aJg

We said no and then she said, ""so you're a walk in?""  My husband, being funny, said"" well we drove.""  The hostess didn't get it.  She took us into the bar to be seated.  She never asked if the bar was okay.  Don't you normally sit in the bar if you don't want to wait for seating?  The entire restaurant was empty except for 2 tables and there was 1 other couple in the bar.  I have no idea why we had to sit in the bar.  My husband asked but he was ignored.  We didn't really make a big deal of it because it was our anniversary (30th) and we didn't want the evening to get weird.  So after that we ordered but the food was just okay.  The soup wasn't hot and the entrees were decent but not excellent.  The service was also mediocre.  Our server was there to bring the food but that was it.  The rest of the time, he and the other 4 servers were gathered around a tv in the bar watching football.  At one point, he even walked out the front door and was outside for awhile.  The bar music was blaring.  I guess for the prices, which I think are somewhat high for the food you're getting, I would expect better service and better ambiance.  We'd been there before and sat in the restaurant and the food seemed pretty good, but then again we had an attentive happy server and we were in the restaurant.   We won't be going back.

Our drinks weren't bought out at the same and the waiter had to be reminded of the drink order for our friends and husbands side of orange juice.

1316308,2017-03-11,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Bonefish Grill has usually been a consistent favorite of ours - consistent in food quality, service no matter which Bonefish Grill we go to - although our dinner tonight would make us think again. 

First off, our server, Rachel, was awesome even with her hands full training a new person. She did everything within her capabilities to remedy our dinner experience. If not for her, I rate this barely a 1 star.

Main issues:
1. Bang Bang Shrimp - flavor was still there but...bed of lettuce seemed like it had slightly brown edges but brushed it off because it.may have been the sauce, and the batter on the shrimp was ""slipping"" off. Definitely not a good start.

2. Fish-n-Chips - portion sized was SIGNIFICANTLY smaller and there was batter than fish! We inquired about this and was told that it could have been a result of inconsistent cuts. 2 additional peices were then brought in to make up for the issue.

3. Shrimp Pad Thai - had this dish before and it WAS good, now no longer. It tasted over sweet like it had been drenched in sweet chili sauce, noodles stuck together in clumps, and the shrimp was added in like an afterthought instead of part of the dish as it had ZERO taste and was rubbery. Now I don't expect it be the same as in a real Thai restaurant but this dish has been on their menu for awhile. 

4. Ice tea refill was so watered down that I had to being it to their attention to get the real stuff

5. Overheard the tables around us also having issues i.e. sides listed on the menu not available because they were given an old menu, food not cooked as expected, etc...

We hope this was just an off night for Bonefish Grill but to be safe we will wait a bit before our next visit that is if we dare to return.",DqfB47fIOTuvVY3ARmDtxg,0,0,2,SmfHXQsmoHLAZ_JzMJ6E9Q

Our young waitress cane over & introduced herself (forgot her name) & asked us about drinks & apps. after I had to tell her I couldn't hear her. She had a very soft voice & the place was busy & nosey. 
Our cocktails took some time to get to us but they were really pretty & tasted yes yummy! (see pictures). I got the pineapple martini....made with rum not vodka. I asked if bread came with the meal since I saw some at the table next to us & was told yes. The bread was delicious, tasted homemade but the oil & herb dip wasn't so good. Had a odd taste to it. I was soooo hungry I ate it anyways, though it would of been better if I had some butter! 

We both got a lobster tail dinner on special $u13.90 & added a lobster tail on $8.00. A tad cheaper then the lobster tails dinner on  the full menu. It was OK, but had this different odd fishy taste to it. Now, now I know lobster is a seafood but I've never had a lobster that tasted so fishy before. Now the menu had a ton of shrimp items in it & also other fish & steak stuff too. 
All non-pasta meals come with a side of veggies but all I saw was squash in my veggies. Tastes as if they sprinkled cheese on it....I could of done without the extra calories. We also got to chose a side. I picked the potato au-gratin which wasnt very tasty or good!  
We waited too long for out checks after our table was cleared too......
I don't like the set up inside. The tables were all to close to each other. No room for a private conversation, or to hang your purse on the corner of the chair without someone knocking into it or worrying if someone People had to walk almost sideways to get by & through the dinner room.

The Miyosaki Sea Bass was the killer for the night that made the lobster tail look bad! The fish was marinated with misoyaki then grilled over oak. It has pickled ginger, sautéed spinach, mushrooms, and served with jasmine rice. All these flavors were splendid together.

And of course, there's their famous Bang Bang Shrimp that's how I started getting hooked with this place. Let me not forget their hand crafted martinis! I absolutely love the drinks here!

I would highly recommend this place to friends and family. 

One suggestion is that you need to try and do more to tell people about you guys. We just got lucky by driving by.

Thanks again and see you soon!...:)",hGv_XkuDFUyjYqF7dXjeHA,2,0,5,K9BNbszj5_4q8cWkx1PAgg
1588539,2017-07-23,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Bonefish Grill is Bang Bang Delicious

This review is for Bonefish Grill, 6527 Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89119, 702-407-0980, for a visit on July 22, 2017.  It's located in Town Square.  I first heard of this restaurant when I earned Reward Points through visits to Outback Steakhouse.  It is one of several restaurants where the discount Rewards coupon can be used.  I read a few reviews and decided to use my coupon there.  I attended the restaurant with my adult son Richard.

We entered the dining room at 6pm and were offered a table or booth.  We chose a table in the center of the room.  The ambiance was wonderful, carrying over the open yet rich interior design from the bar area, onto cloth covered tables.  I love that the restaurant has great lighting.  I hate eating in the dark or struggling to read a menu in minimal lighting.  Keep in mind it is summertime and the sun does not set until 8pm.  I imagine, after sunset, the restaurant probably offers a romantic lighting.

Upon being seated, our server ""Billy Balantine"" immediately brought us menus and filled our water glasses with cool water.  Water at the table is such a highlight in Vegas during the overheated summer, and I was glad to see that we did not have to order it or ask for it.

The menu was only one page front and back, plus a short Summer Specials menu on the table, but the offerings were more than adequate.  Most of the menu comprised of seafood delicacies including Chilean Sea Bass $30, Rainbow Trout $20, and Filet with Lobster special for only $22.  Keep in mind that this restaurant presents itself in an atmosphere of upper class gourmet yet the prices are only moderate. While we looked over the menu, our server ""Billy"" kept up a lively banter, answered all our questions about menu items and made several great suggestions.

The first item we ordered was the Bang Bang Shrimp appetizer $12.  People raved about it online, so we had to try it.  ""Billy"" stated it was a customer favorite for which they received tons of orders.  Within minutes, literally minutes, ""Billy"" returned with our order and a plate of bread and oil dip.  The bread was a wonderful soft crusted sourdough with a side of garlic oil that was devoured so quickly by the two of us that we worried we might not have room left for dinner.  The Bang Bang Shrimp did not disappoint either.  We quickly gobbled that up too.  It had a wonderful flavor that was a little bit spicy and simply delicious.  I could have made a meal out two or three orders of just Bang Bang Shrimp and the delicious bread.  [Hint:  If you can't afford moderately priced restaurants for a full meal, I suggest going during Happy Hour, purchasing a couple of $5 drinks at the bar, carry them to your table, then order two Bang Bang Shrimp appetizers with bread, and really make it a meal.  It will only cost you about $40 for two people.]

For our main courses, my son chose the Chilean Sea Bass and had another Blueberry Lemon Drop $10.50 (tableside).  I had to try it.  The bass was so tender it fell apart in huge flakes of perfect white meat.  I took one bite before my son shooed me away, and it was a flavor burst in my mouth.  You could taste distinct flavors of seasoning and lemon, that seemed separate yet blended.  You could taste four different flavors along with the delicate fish' own flavor that was just exquisite.  I began to wish I had ordered the same item.  Instead, I had ordered the Rainbow Trout along with ice tea.  I'm a bit picky when it comes to trout.  I like it pan fried, but that was not an option,  Everything here is grilled, hence the name ""Bonefish Grill.""  I still tried to get it the way I wanted.  I asked for the trout to be grilled hard on the skin side to crisp it, and also requested it blackened (meaning cajun spiced).  It seems these requests could not be filled, but the dish was stiull very good and a fair sized portion.  I recently had trout at ""Cracker Barrel"" and found it to be a bit slimy, flavorless, and the portion was one small side fillet about 2"" x 4"" in size.  Barely a mouthful or two.  The portion at ""Bonefish"" was two full fillet sides about 3"" x 5"" in size.  I only ate half and took the rest home for  a second meal later.

Both meals came with a selection of two sides.  We both chose the same sides: Garlic Whipped Potatoes ($4) and Crab Fried Rice ($6). The potatoes were so yummy and so was the rice.  Whoever heard of Crab Fried Rice?  It was a nice sized portion and so flavorful.  Just yummy!

The total bill was $88, minus our Rewards coupon for $20, and we were left with balance of $68 with our savings covering the whole tip for our excellent server.

Just batter fried shrimp with an orangish sauce on it that wasn't even spicy at all. Same sauce seemed to go on the Sriracha Pepper Chicken (crispy chicken tossed in a creamy, spicy sauce) that a friend ordered which again was not spicy in the least. I think the tacos would have been better had they a cole slaw mix instead of the lettuce. And mine seemed to be missing the sour cream which was ok since there was no spice to it & that would have made it even more bland. Tuesday & Thursday they have all sorts of Lobster deals & another friend ordered some of them & she said they were just ok. Not really sure I'll go back again with the way the food tasted. Would rather spend my $$ somewhere else.",uByIGcI5EJeKNGyBtCkWBw,0,0,2,1STRbH0xVs2Z-gqJ3IYnOQ

The foods in the dishes just didn't really meld together and the plates that came out all had some differences from how they were listed on the menu. The staff was very good, the place was clean and the service was fine. All the negatives lie with the food. Overall, I wouldn't come here again. 

Had the cobb salad and the swordfish special with bacon and spinach. The dressing on this salad was just terrible. It was okay on its own, but combined with the rest of the salad the flavors just did not work well together at all. The swordfish was ""eh"", the bacon and spinach were a disappointment. I have high expectations of bacon. The spinach had a poor texture and flavor.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,3,1,2,UZ-hE3QfPANQWS4qlDkX6Q

We sit down and ordered two appetizers bang bang shrimp and crab cakes. The shrimp comes out but the crab cakes doesn't and had to wait longer for them because they waitress forgot to order it. Then I ordered the Caribbean Cobia special while pointing to it on the special sheet which was supposed to come with coconut, grilled pineapple grilled shrimp and pineapple salsa, my meal came with none of that just the fish and two sides I ordered. We also ordered two house salads and never got those either until the middle of our meal after saying anything.

We sat with John, bless his heart we were a handful! Haha and he rocked it! Well done John and thank you Chris behind the bar for some yummy drinks! We have been here before for happy hour and the menu has gotten a lot smaller. For example they used to have their bang bang shrimp on happy hour but now they don't. Kind of a shame it was yummy. But you can still order it as it's on their regular menu. Anywho what we did have was pretty good. The boys had a couple wagu sliders, which they both really liked, then the cod sliders were also very tasty! The calamari was a little weak which was a shame because it looked good coming out of the kitchen with all the tentacles and rings but we liked the sauce!  And the mussels were slightly cold and so we sent them back and they nuked them and sent them back to the table. All in all this spot got a 4 star because of our great service!

She made some good suggestions and gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu. She didn't offer us a happy hour menu, which she did to the table behind us, so that was kind of disappointing since we had already ordered our drinks, but all in all that's ok.

My husband had the rainbow trout which was excellent! I had the seasonal sword fish with pumpkin ravioli which was just ok. 

While I go really don't like chain restaurants, we will come back here. It's a convenient location, the service was great, and the food was descent.",TGo6H2hP6myp1tFgDsbP0g,2,1,4,JR9uk1I8rK6ANdv7R3phZw
1628469,2016-02-10,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"After hearing so much about this place, we finally had a chance to visit for and early Valentines Day date night. The reason I rated a 2-star was because of the sodium content in both entrees. It was incredibly salty almost unbearable. I should have made a complaint but we were having such a romantic moment that I just could ruin it. We ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and the Filet with lobster stuffed shrimp. The sea bass was flavorful but salty. Don't order the filet with lobster stuff shrimp, you will be disappointed. The shrimp were small (you would think for a fish house they would serve jumbo tiger shrimp) and there was disappointing portions of lobster meat. The fact is that the shrimp were too small to stuff with lobster meat. Too bad for me as I was really looking forward to it. The filet was cooked just right (Melted in my mouth) but the masala sauce was way too salty and the mash potato was unbearably salty that I didn't even eat it. I hope this was an oversight or there was a cook in training because someone didn't check the spice portions or taste the food. Needless to say, there were some bright spots. The appetizer, Bang Bang Shrimp was amazing. I should have ordered two servings and I would have been completely satisfied. Served on a bed of spring mix, the spice, pea nutty sauce was simple delicious. The chopstick were a plus as a utensil. The bread was to die for...with the garlic infuse olive oil and pesto based spices. Lastly, the chocolate Crème Brule was yummy. If you want a private space, ask the host don't settle for other tables as they are extremely close. Without a good experience with appetizer, bread, dessert and my hot date (wife), I would have given it a 1-star.",ehAvwDt4Fpsz9KPordu5lA,0,0,2,syvmekzM3tsJabQoNDVy8g

1692099,2013-05-31,2,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"So Jason wouldn't shut up about the Bang Bang shrimp since he'd had it while on TDY in Florida, so naturally after we rolled by Bonefish Grill after a day shopping at Town Square, we had to make plans to visit. We did so a couple weeks later after the Wine Walk in Town Square.

We started with the Bang Bang. Jason noted that the portion was much larger than he had received in Fl and it tasted exactly like he remembered. Maybe it was the wine talking, but I wasn't that big of a fan- I'll probably have to try it again sober.

Jason had the trout in the lemon sauce, and opted for the potatoes au gratin. His fish was delicious! The au gratin gave him a little trouble though, he noted that it was delicious, but when he took a deep breath over his food, the breadcrumbs of the au gratin had gotten lodged up into his trachea. DON'T BREATHE HEAVILY OVER THE AU GRATIN!

I ordered the fish n chips.. but with quinoa instead of fries. The quinoa was AMAZING! Very fresh, and crisp. The fish was also much better than I had expected following finding out it was tilapia. I was very happy with it, but even better was the tarter sauce. The best I think I had ever had.

Service was also on point. Was a good meal, and we will definitely be back, but won't be making any special trips down here for it. If you're in the area, definitely stop by.",lluNN1aQlFN7NQQ2BxFBUQ,4,2,4,bn_76UpvfrjU-oDdLSRlnA

Let's start with the food~  We started off with the Bang Bang Shrimp Appetizer for the table.  There was a enough for 4 of us to share for a starter.  They were delicious! Had a great creamy and spicy flavor.   I could have probably ordered just that for my entree.  But since it was our first time here, I kept truckin on...  The fresh bread was delivered to the table with dipping oil and seasonings.  This was also pretty great .  The bread was warm with the great flavor of the dipping oil.  My stomach was filling up fast but I'm still going to power through.  :-)  I ordered the Longfin Tilapia Imperial.  It took a little while for our meals to be delivered but mine was worth a little wait.  It was stuffed with shrimp, crab, scallops and cheese with a great butter flavor and seasoning.  I chose to accompany my fish with the steamed broccoli.  I might as well have part of my meal to be healthy right? The broccoli was perfectly steamed with a seasoning that did not over power any flavor.  If I was judging my dining experience alone... it would have been at least 4 stars but I was not there alone.

Why only three stars?  Our waitress was pleasant when we saw her, but few and far between.  She messed up a friends drink order, twice.  But this could be overlooked if she had acknowledged her mistake. She rarely came back to our table to check on how our meals were and let our drinks go dry a few times.    My husband and friends steak was over done.  I realize we are at a seafood restaurant but if steak is offered, know how to prepare it as requested.  Our friend sent his back but my husband ate his as he doesn't send food back.  We've all seen the movie Waiting... right?  

I'm hoping to come back here since I loved their bang bang shrimp.  Keeping my fingers crossed for better service and meal for the hubby.  Happy that we were there with great company!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,5,1,3,nKxh2GV2K4a53egCNZfMOA

In addition the side of green beans was undercooked! Greas and burnt pieces of foods were all over the plate it looked like a methed up greasy spoon diner cook slopped it out. But here comes the shinning moment where service out shone the bad experience. I told the waiter the food was overcooked he promptly appologized and took it away to fix it. It came back fast and we'll cooked it was delicious. The scallops had the light fluffy buttery goodness I know. The shrimp was well cooked and flavorful just how I wanted it. Then the manager Eddie came over apologized for the food and then found out we had been here for well over an hour by this point. He comped our appetizer which made me happy then bought us dessert and gave us a complimentary appetizer for our next visit. Which we will do. Thank you Eddie and staff because of the service and attention paid to us we will be back and I will recommend this place the food was good. Thank you Bonefish for a great meal to end a great day. We will see you soon.",YqAff_qHfUzt7TdScB0ihQ,0,0,4,kqN1fAyyaLk-Uz1I6CpCYg

I had a bite of the trout and it was really good as were the scalloped potatoes (more casserole than potatoey). 

My house salad with chicken was perfect (had brazilian meat service the evening before so this was a great light dish). The dressing was citrusy and light with no cloying aftertaste.

Amazing portions, high quality food, very tasty and well presented.  My son had the grilled chicken, and my husband had the bacon cheeseburger which was incredible.

The biggest standout of the night was our server, Jamie.  She was friendly, knowledgable, attentive but not intrusive!  I adored her and we even gave her our cards to stay in touch.

Here's the not so great part - This is one of the most awful dining rooms I have ever been in.  The tables are set NYC style and so close that our chairs not only touched the chairs of the surrounding tables, but I heard more about the other's tables' relationships and work issues than I would have liked.  Additionally, the kitchen entrance is so large you look all the way down the line.  Not in a sexy, open air kitchen kind of way, but in a ""did the drape not come in"" or ""is that a mistake"" kind of way.  And, lastly, the way that the booths are set around the perimeter combined with the height of the tables and the color of the space made me feel like I was squished at the children's table.  It was so uncomfortable that we actually left earlier than we would have had the space been more comfortable.

I would love to go back, but I would not sit in that dining room again.  Which means that I'm stuck in weather permitting dates when I can sit on the patio!

PS - One final thought - The highchair to table hight was so awkward that my daughter's forehead was literally up against the table edge.  Not safe and felt very unnerving!",Rl_Xp1f4c0_ej5w_vjwZUA,0,0,3,cwd83kewLkheHNxwrZu4Lw

Looking at the rest of the eateries in the center we decided to head to BoneFish because of the reviews on Yelp. So glad we did.

Firstly if you are staying on the strip pick up a $5 Tix4d restaurant card kiosk that are all over or up the road from  as it will save you 20% here!

Food excellent, service excellent too.  

Huge variety of items on the menu, Thursday is 50% off wine. Which makes a bottle of Malbec $14.50.

Our table ordered a mix of ahi, burger, steak. All perfect.  Salads and sides were excellent too.

The sourdough & pesto oil you are seated with is very good and especially good if you mix in some fresh lemon

Oh and my entree came 15 minutes after everyone else's even though we ordered together. We asked twice about it... Then it popped up. They offered to spilt our checks, which was nice (we were prepared to pay cash). And when we got out checks, half were messed up. Then one of the waiters accused two of us for not paying for our drinks... When we explained they were on others tabs and we straightened it out, he never apologized. I realize group outings can be difficult for restaurants but we were a considerably easy table with a lot of blunders. Service, 2 stars (with the exception of the initial greeter/manager?)

I ordered the red sangria which was great! Tastes like grape juice, much sweeter than your average sangria. So may be a no-go for some. And the baja fish tacos with chips. A fresh mango salsa topping the tacos was definitely above par! My food was a solid 4.5 stars.

We were seated immediately at a nice tall top in the bar area.  Great ambiance and I have to say for the crowd they had not loud at all. 

We ordered drinks and my friends who had gotten there a bit before us had already ordered Bang Bang Shrimp and I ordered crab cakes.  They bring out a nice fresh loaf of bread with olive oil for a nice light snack.  Our shrimp arrived and it was amazing!  Our crab cakes were amazing as well so full of crab and the sauce was a nice touch. 

My hubs and I eat ordered the crab corn chowder and he ordered the steak while I went with their chicken as my friend was getting the other item I was eyeing, the tilapia.

The soup was so nummy, large chunks of crab through out the soup.  So GOOD!  Our main course arrives and it looks amazing.  Sadly, they overcooked my hubs' steak so he had to wait a bit.  The manager and the GM came over both to apologize which was quite thoughtful of them. My chicken had goat cheese and artichokes layered on it making it even better.  My green beans were smothered in butter which is not good for me but great for the hubs who ate them while waiting for his refire. :)
I did taste my friends tilapia and it was a good choice as well. 

Now to the reason I gave them only 4 and really debated on giving them a 3.  Our service was HORRIBLE.  My hubs orders his soda with no ice.  She brings it with ice and doesn't apologize when he mentions it to her. Does she correct it on his refill?  Nope!  I brought it up to her on the side and then she brings him seltzer water instead of his Sprite.  During the entire meal our water glasses were empty and I had to ask one of the servers who brought out our food to get another glass of wine. Let me explain, she had 4 tables she was working and I really wasn't paying attention to what kind of service they were getting but both my girlfriend and i kept commenting that we really never saw her with anyone else.

5/5 Calamari cooked to perfection.  Never had Calamari so soft and breading was just right. The sweet spicy Asian sauce was a nice change from the standard marinara.

5/5 Fontina Chops.  Tender and juicy.  The Marsala sauce wasn't too rich or overwhelming as other sauces.  Spend the extra $5 for the white truffle Mac and cheese. 

Wife had the sirloin and crab cake and only had great things to say about it. 

Didn't have enough room for dessert this time but on my first trip I remember having the key lime pie and being extremely happy.  Worth the extra 1000 calories

That's understandable on a Friday evening, but it gave me a little time to look around.  Couldn't help think what a low budget place this is.  There's just nothing interesting or nice about it.  Cheap finishes, unarticulated surfaces, bathrooms that could be found in your run of the mill McDonald's...environment 2 out of 5.  

After we were seated (2 adults, 2 children), we waited over 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order, and only after we asked the hostess for help.  Not a good start.  When the waiter finally showed up, he tried pretty hard, but everything was very slow, and with kids, slow is tough...service 3 out of 5.

The salads came first.  Two ""watermelon salads"" consisting of a few small cubes of watermelon, a few small cucumber wedges, and a lot of leaves of I'm not sure what, all swimming in oil.  Great idea but way too much oil.  Then I had scallops wrapped in bacon.  Good, but the relish that came with them ruined the flavor.  My wife had a filet.  She ordered it medium well and it came out very well, and completely dry.  Sent it back and the 2nd try was perfectly cooked, but they butterflied it for some unknown reason.  She thought it was ok; I thought it was tender, not tasty.  The kid's food was fine (chicken and broccoli), but they were out of kid's cups and we had to monitor their drinks very carefully, since one is 3 and the other just turned two...food 2 out of 5.

This would have been bad enough until my pant leg touched the underside of the table and pulled down a piece of gum that had been stuck to it.  Scraped and rubbed my jeans for 10 minutes and got most of it off.

The place was overcrowded, and the vibe seemed fairly old.  Music was elevator type; waiters, bus boys and expeditors all wear the same ill-fitting jackets with faded black pants in various shades of gray.  Most of them looked like they hadn't showered...ambience and vibe - 1 out of 5.

Everything was medium priced to expensive.  The filet was $26 with corn on the cob.  Shots were $9.50...value - 1 out of 5.

We wanted it to be good, but it's a place we'll never go back to, and frankly have a hard time understanding some of the positive reviews.  It's the kind of experience you'd expect from Applebee's but at twice the price (and we aren't Applebee's fans).

Bottom line - don't bother.",-p8wuuA3HPDRMhciLYlomQ,0,0,2,4Fy6-Ego-onyLmm3Jw1SkQ

I once ordered a plate of fried calamari as a starter. For some reason, our calamari came with small pieces of shrimp mixed in. Being allergic to shrimp, this was unacceptable. We alerted the waiter. Not only did the waiter take the plate back immediately, but the manager came out, apologized profusely, brought out some fresh calamari with no shrimp in it, and comped our drinks. The manager continued to check up on us that night and made sure the rest of our night was perfect.

As far as entrees go, the Spinach Bacon Gorgonzola Swordfish is a must try here (whenever they have it, as it is only on special during certain parts of the year).

Good food, great service!  I love great service and our waitress came back to ask how we were doing a few times, water was refilled very quickly, and we were asked more than once if the food was good.

The food was presented very well and was rather tasty, but much too salty for my taste.  Additionally, avoid the ""white sauce""...it's super fattening and salty. Urg.  Besides that, the shrimp and fish tacos were pretty good.  The bacon-wrapped scallops were amazing. We enjoyed the appetizers a bit more than the main entrees so keep that in mind when ordering as it's likely you'll experience the same!

Side note - I left my credit card there! I only noticed the next day when I was leaving to come back home as I was at the gas station about to pay for gas! I called them immediately to see if they had it and as sure as Dahmer is burning in hell getting gang-raped by strap-on-wearing lesbians, they had it at the front desk waiting for me!

Great service, awesome dining experience.  Food could be a bit better~

Service: A+.  Awesome~

The one saving grace for this place was that it was not too expensive.  We had a complimentary card for the appetizer, so the bill with tip was exactly $50.  I can think of literally a dozen other places $50 gets two people a better experience and food.

The waitress was aloof and impatient. When we got our dishes, I asked where my garlic mashed potatoes were, and her response was ""The kitchen made an error and put your mashed on her plate"" (pointing to my friend). Um, ok?

Still hungry, we decided to order more and some drinks. I caved and got one of the specialty drinks because it did not appear that a glass of wine was part of the happy hour special. After we ordered (the bang bang shrimp, yum!) we found out that there were more options for happy hour--including a $3 glass of wine!

Boyfriend and I always order the Bang Bang Shrimp. One of their popular favorite appetizers. Crispy shrimp tossed in a spicy aioli sauce. 
For entrees, I usually switch between salmon or Chilean seabass. The outside is seared and the inside got a smooth, buttery and tender. I made sure to specify that I want it well done. Completely cook the sh&t outta it!!!!! I know some restaurants serve their seafood medium. So make sure to specify if you have any special requests. You get to choose two sides; I picked steamed broccoli and potatoes au gratin. Yum!!!! Portions were just right. (Didn't have any leftovers, perfect 4 oz. portion. You can choose between 4 or 6 oz seabass. It was either 4 and 6 or 6 and 8). Boyfriend chose his entrée from the special menu for the night. He got soft shell crab and really enjoyed it. He got the garlic mashed potatoes as one of his sides and man that was good!!!! Personally, I liked that better than my potatoes au gratin.

Overall, great ambiance, customer service was good and it wasn't an expensive bill. It's healthy....well...healthier than most restaurants and it never disappoints.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,4,1,4,-Cr9NuWzkhnsIXNqFM6JsQ

So we were very happy to see them back at Town Square. 

Stopped in Friday night. They had a good crowd, fortunately it was only a 15 minute wait. 

The décor and set up looked almost identical to the other, nice and comfortable 

Once seated we were greeted immediately and our drink order was taken, we were told about the specials, all but the one we saw on Yelp.. So not sure if that's really a special. Because it wasn't shown as a check in special...

We started off with Bang Bang Shrimp! Always a winner. Crisp, fried shrimp tossed in a spicy remolaude sauce. Plenty for a table of four or more.. 

My husband ordered the fish tacos which he said they were good. .

I ordered the Crab Corn Chowder and Ceviche. The chowder was rich & creamy... with a few lumps of crab and corn. I would have liked it if it had more crab. 

The ceviche was good. Nice and light. Lots of seafood, scallops, shrimp & fish..

Anywho, we waited about 15 minutes and my husband got the text. The hostess seated us. Jon was our waiter, and quickly gave us water and soon some bread. I ordered a martini which tasted wonderful. We ordered some appetizers and quickly came out. We were so hungry he came with another bread.  Lol. Then our entree came and surprisingly ate it all.

It's always great to have food options when venturing around Town Square and I'd gladly recommend this establishment.  Upon arrival for lunch, my family was seated immediately and they provide slings for infant seats which was nice.  We ordered:

Bang Bang Shrimp - Crispy fried shrimp tossed in a creamy and very mildly spicy sauce.  5/5, would get it again.  There was enough shrimp for at least two people.  My wife, who dislikes spicy food, enjoyed it.

Cup of Lobster Bisque - Not the best, not the worst.  A nice chunk of cooked lobster makes the soup worth it.  No bread or crackers are provided unless you ask the server for it.

Tilapia Imperial - Nicely sized baked tilapia with stuffed shrimp, crab, and scallops, tossed in a lemon butter and caper sauce.   The fish was perfectly cooked.  The lemon butter and capers gave it a delicious flavor.  The entree came with two sides of which we had two types of potatoes, both good.  

Spicy Tuna bowl-  My only slight disappointment.  ""Premium"" sushi grade, sesame-seared rare, on top of jasmine rice, a half avocado, along with a sweet chili sauce and passion fruit salsa.  Compare my photo with that of the company's.  The tuna I had was very dark in color, not very fresh tasting, and the chili sauce just seemed out of place.  I'll give them a pass here as maybe raw fish is not their specialty.  The small slices left more to be desired.

Chicken tender kid's meal- Doubt you can do this wrong.  Came with a small drink and a side of fries.  

Our server was okay.   Not super fast but she was able to be flagged down when we needed her.  Sometimes she forgot our requests for things like extra spoons or napkins.  Also, I'm not a fan of having to ask for bread for it to be served.  I would suggest having the servers at least offer it.  Once we asked, a generous loaf of bread came out with olive oil and basil. 

All in all, a good business worth checking out a second time if not just to try their various wood-grilled fish options.  Stay away from the raw stuff and do ask for bread.

2721200,2014-04-27,1,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"I want to group Olive garden, cheese cake factory and bonefish grille etc. into the same categories of resturants. Probably not very exciting due the standard menu, but you would expect reasonably good food and decent service. But based on my recent experience, I do not think I will go back any time soon. My review is based primarily on the quality of the food and one problem with the service. 

I went to Bonefish Grille a couple years ago at another location and I remembered liking the Bang Bang shrimp, but not like my entree back then. 

When I was here tonight, I was surprised to find the Bang Bang shrimp is $13 or something like that, quite a price jump from my memory. I ordered the sea bass with Asian sauce and it comes with seasonal vegetable and I can choose another side. I chose the couscous. It turns out to be a major disappointment. The fish recipe is not well designed in the first place and I think the execution is poor as well. 

In my opinion, Chilean sea bass is very good fish. It taste good by itself and it is really hard to screw up. But somehow Bonefish made it happen. The only good thing is the fish is still tender and juicy (as I said the fish is very forgiving). 

The first problem is the sauce is awful and it totally overpowers the delicate fish. The sauce is labeled as pan Asian sauce, but it tastes somewhat sweet with a tomato undertone. So it tastes like a cheap generic sweet and sour sauce. Diluted soy sauce or salt/pepper would probably be much better. When the food itself is good, the recipe should be simple to show-case the food material itself. There are also some shredded carrots on top of the fish. They are totally unnecessary and so out of place. Who on earth wants sweet and sour fish with carrots? Why on earth call it Asian sauce? I do not know any Asian cuisine cook delicate fish in sweet sour sauce with carrots.

The second problem is the outer surface of the fish steak is burnt. I understand the fish is probably seared in the pan first and then baked or grilled. But apparently the temperature of the pan is too high. The fish surface can be slightly crispy, golden brown, but not bitter and burnt. So I think it is not executed well. 

Thirdly, the menu says the dish comes with a side of seasonal vegetable and it turns out to be Garbanzo beans. I would not consider them to be seasonal and when I think of vegetables, I generally do not think of Garbanzo beans either. It tastes ok. But if you would like fresh vegetables (i.e., broccoli, zucchini, asparagus etc.) like I do, please ask the waiter what the seasonal vegetable actually is. Make no assumptions. 

Lastly, the bathroom is out of towel paper and there is no hand drying equipment either. I think it is a negligence of the management. 

With all above being said, our waitress is attentive and friendly. The ambience is comfortable and trendy. If you are not very concerned with the food taste and would rather choose familiarity from the chains (i.e., the food and the ambiance), I think this may still be a good place.",FcxklVcaLYlDO_KDzsRZXw,1,0,3,tvdpkRSL10NlGB-4ZooBBw

1) We showed up on a Saturday without a reservation so we were expecting to have to wait and have some cocktails at the bar first.  We were told 20-25 mins. Not bad at all. The reality was that 55 minutes later we were finally seated.  UGH!!!  Hostess was very kind to offer us a free appetizer to make up for the wait though(more to follow on this)
2) Always have had AMAZING food here.  This time TERRIBLE.  Both fish entrees were very under seasoned and had a mushy texture to them.  Rice was dried out and no seasoning at all.  Asparagus and spinach was WAY overcooked and with no flavor at all.  Not sure what happened, as the previous visits the food was the star and second to none.  Maybe new kitchen help?
3) Wait service was the worst ever.  I was going to leave the waitress name, but I thought better of it.  She failed to put our free appetizer order in that the restaurant comped us for the long wait for the table.  We ended up having after our entrees.  VERY long waits in between her checking back on us for drinks or to even see if we needed anything at all.  She came to our table 3 times. Once to take order, once when we requested from another staff member to have her come to our table, because we didn't receive our appetizer, and the last time to bring check.

Pros:  Service, Clean
Cons:  Food is sub par

My wife and I dined at Bonefish Grill last Monday.  While we found the server very friendly and attentive, the food was mediocre and sub par.  

Apps (Wagyu Beef + Ginger Potstickers / Wedge Salad)

The potstickers were really unmemorable.  I wouldn't say that they are bad, but I wouldn't say that they are better than frozen ones you can get at Trader Joes.  For the ""wagyu"" beef, it really didn't taste like anything, which made me believe that they were frozen or likely prepared at a central commissary.  As for the salad, it was good, but slightly under dressed.  I wondered if the server is the one who prepares the salad.  If so, then the salad will probably be inconsistent depending on who makes it.

Entrees (Georges Bank Scallops & Shrimp, Caribbean-Style Fresh Cobia)

Starting with the good, the cobia was excellent.  I would order this again, but since I'm never going back to Bonefish, I'll just order it when I go to RM Seafood.  The garnish on this dish was notable since it was so much superior to the garnish on the Georges dish.  First, the scallops were simply insipid with a strange texture.  Second, the accompanying shrimp were the same, except that the shrimp with the cobia was much tastier and seasoned better.  Third, the salsa on this dish was strange in that it was mushy and felt like it was overcooked (not that I've had a cooked salsa before).  

Dessert (Chocolate Lava Cake)

This is not a lava cake.  It is a bundt cake that is covered and filled with strange tasting chocolate.  

Anyway, if you're the type of person who likes the Cracker Barrel, you'll probably be impressed with Bonefish Grill.

2950232,2017-02-11,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,Very disappointed. It is just that simple. I have been to this location on 4 occasions and the last 2 were so  disappointing that I doubt I will return. The hostess was just a step above rude and definitely a terrible first impression. This was the case on both of our last 2 visits. The last time I asked for some extra salad dressing on the side and it was brought to me when I already was 1/2 way through my main course. I had lobster and was not given any melted butter. Our server knew she didn't bring it and as I waited and waited I finally asked someone else for some butter; because now my lobster was getting cold. Our waitress brought the butter and was put out and confrontational as she asked if I needed more because I was asking her peers to bring me butter. Food was good. Service is not only substandard it is rude. Management was nowhere to be seen. There are too many restaurants in this city with friendly staff to waste your time and money at this Bonefish Grill.,dQ0GYDvuqAe76sl2CSW3Wg,0,0,1,clBV7ZWN7k0yfmegFnQiJw

This guy was hands down one of the best servers I've ever had, period; fine dining included.  I highly recommend that the management at Bonefish does whatever it can to retain him as an employee.  This guy has the skills of a well seasoned fine dining server.  Because of this I am granting this establishment a well deserved 5 stars.

I have had some AMAZING meals here and I have had a couple really mediocre meals. I am not sure I really understand. How can they be so great and so meh at the same time?

Now, I will always ask for the waitperson to make recommendations.
That seems to be the way to go here. An insider's tip.
And hopefully they will become more consistent, now that they are preparing to open one really close to our house.

2960053,2014-04-05,2,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"We were excited to try Bonefish Grill when we were visiting Las Vegas because of all the great reviews. Their menu items looked appetizing and it was conveniently located at the Towne Square (an upper scale version of The Americana or The Grove).

The GOOD:
[Substitutions]
I chose an entree that was supposed to come with two skewers (scallops and shrimp). Being slightly allergic to shrimp, they were able to change it to another skewer of scallops. They didn't have anything else on the menu that was just scallops or scallops without shrimp.

[Not Crowded] 
We were seated right away.

The BAD:
[Slow Service]
It was awesome that we were seated right away, but when it's not crowded and the dining experience is a two hour long one, not cool.

[Mojitos Sucked]
Everyone was raving about the Black Cherry Guava Mojito, but for some reason it had an after taste (maybe artificial sweetener?). I'm a REAL sugar type of girl and the drink would have been better with real cane sugar or just regular simple syrup. FYI - it wasn't indicated on the menu what type of sugar was used.

OVERALL:
It was nice to try once, but if I had a choice between dining here or a casual eatery like California Fish Grill back home, I would pick the later because of taste and variety alone.

We decided to sit in the bar area and take advantage of their happy hour specials. When we sat down, the hostess came by with some menus and told us their specials which was great, however it took awhile before a waiter acknowledged that we were there. 

We noticed that there were several waiters, standing around and just chatting and they just kept walking by us and didn't say anything. One waitress, that walked by us several times did finally say to us that she apologized for the delay, she didn't know who was our server and that our server did not come in yet and she will be taking our order.

We ordered the steamed mussels and several other items that were on the happy hour menu. Our food came fairly quickly, but no one brought us any silverware. We waited for our waitress to come by so we can ask her, but she never did. My husband finally decided to get it himself and went to the bar to ask for 2 place settings. 

I have to say that the food was excellent and delicious as I remembered the first time I ate at this establishment several years ago, when it was in Henderson. I would definitely come back, but wish the service was much better.  I realize they just opened a few months ago and have to work out a few things. It looks like they have a lot of help, but all of them just stand around and talk. They need to work on this.

We went on a tues night for dinner and were given an electronic device that would vibrate and light up when our table was ready. My gut said leave but we stayed. The wait was short and we were taken to a table right at the kitchen opening. There are no doors and we spent our meal watching the staff pick up plates of food and listening to yelling in the kitchen. It wasn't angry yelling but it also wasn't enjoyable. Our waitress was super nice and told us about the menu and emphasized the fresh fish delivered daily and the oak char grilling. We started with crab cakes and a caesar salad. The salad was ok, dressing a little heavy, had an odd flavor, maybe too much dijon? The crab cakes were dry and served with a small dry seedy bit of lemon. (Some sea food restraints have learned to put elastic cloths over lemon halves but i guess not this place.) The crab cakes were ok, a bit  dry, crumbly and bland. not great at all but not so bad to send back, just boring. Entrees were grilled salmon and the grilled scallops with shrimp. The salmon was ok, not bad not great just ok. The scallops had faint grill marks and were cooked through, as were the shrimps. Both seemed a little small and under seasoned and under seared.  For a place that emphasizes their oak wood char grill it was pretty disappointing. The scallops were sadly boring and bland. the grill marks were minimal, char or sear almost non existent and over all presentation and flavor just plain and underwhelming. Sides were adequate - spinach and green beans. Again nothing wrong but nothing stood out as good either. The coconut pie has a weird texture, pretty much shredded coconut without much binder leaving the impression of a coconut hash brown served with a way too sweet Myers's rum sauce. The whole meal was adequate, just ok. Nothing terrible, nothing wrong but also no passion, nothing stood out. It seemed like the work of a C student, it got the job done and not a bit more. I went on line to find out they are indeed a chain with dozens of locations and that explains why the entire meal I felt like I was at a Claim Jumper or a Yard House or an airport.",uc5SI7_91nonDnujTB7tug,0,0,2,c3bS5Wwm7TaMzwUceeIOWg

Dinner: All of their fish is amazing but we usually get a seasonal special. Tonight we split the swordfish topped with crab and served with pumpkin ravioli. With the appetizer it was more than enough to share.

Bonefish Grill is one of those places it seems all my friends are raving about and I didn't see the point in going to...until I went. This place was a great time. The food was remarkable, especially considering how affordable it was. We are talking quality sea food for a price that isn't too much more than TGI Friday's ""fancy"" menu. 

We dined here for our 3 year wedding anniversary and the service was superb. Everyone we encountered, especially our waiter, was very kind. We struck up conversations with nearly every staff member we spoke to and to top it off the food was great. 

I love swordfish, the steak of the sea. I always order it when I go out to seafood places as a gauge of said place's quality. If you're bold enough to serve swordfish, you better make sure you do it right. Spoiler: they did a great job.

Overall, I would absolutely eat here again AND recommend the place. Give it a whirl, kids!",1dM27ursYQBTH2NR2ggtSw,2,0,4,dbfS_e2nRaekQysMU_zZCQ

The events manager, Andy was great. Their policy for group reservations was really flexible, as well. We only needed to give a final headcount 2 days ahead (we gave a ballpark when we booked) and people could choose that day from among the 3 entree options we selected when we booked. No having to get people to RSVP to us with their meal choices - heaven for a wedding! We even had 2 vegetarians in the party and they could select from among a few vegetarian options at no extra charge. The group events menus they have start at very reasonable prices - less than other options in Town Square we had considered using. 

They let us use the projector screen in the room, which we used to put up a slideshow of combined family photos that my mom made. That was a great addition to the meal. Everyone was happy with their food, and the waitstaff made serving and clearing smooth.

All martinis on the menu are just $5 on Mondays and happy hour goes from 4-6:30pm- I tried their dirty martini and it was fab. I was pleasantly surprised with the blue cheese stuffed olives and a hint of pickle flavor, for the win! They have a bar specials menu with a variety of dishes from cod sliders, ahi poke to the yummy mussels, and if you have a child with you- they will even accommodate their happy hour menu in the dining room - I really appreciated that policy, not every business does that.

On our most recent visit, we started with their warm crisp-on-the-outside-soft-on-the-inside house bread with garlic-herb pesto. Delicious! (side note: check my tip on the bread, just to be safe)

On to Bang! Bang! Shrimp & Ceviche. The B!B!S is a crowd favorite with fried shrimp, perfectly crisp, liberally tossed in a flavorful sweet and spicy sauce over a bed of lettuce. It's a good portion for sharing amongst friends and make sure to toss the lettuce in the dressing for a delicious little salad, to boot.

Not to be outdone, the ceviche of the day is a mixto of scallops, shrimp & sea bass, marinated in lots of lime, cucumber and avocado- served with tortilla strips. Ceviche was good, aside from large pieces of butternut squash that didn't mesh with the rest of the dish. I would request extra jalapeño if you're into spicy and ask for extra crispy strips; they were a little chewy and under-seasoned.

I had the Mussels Josephine from the bar bites menu. A good portion, plenty to make a dinner out of- with a delicious lemon butter broth underneath and tomatoes that paired perfectly with each bite of mussels. I thoroughly enjoyed each bite of succulent garlicy mussel with the diced tomatoes, it was a great mix. I wish I had saved my bread to sop up the broth, it was just super yummy.

Hubby had the filet with lobster, green beans and potatoes au gratin. Sides were all good. The cook on the steak was as requested (medium rare) but needed seasoning. We shared the lobster- it was cooked and presented nicely with side of grilled lemon and butter for dipping. Not mad about the lobster.

As for service, Nicole K. was a rockstar- some of the best service we've had dining out in a while. She was right on top of each detail, whether clearing plates, replacing utensils, fresh waters- next rounds of drinks, and even brought my son a special little dish of chocolate covered strawberries with whipped cream and chocolate chips in honor of his kinder-graduation.

Located in Town Square, it's than fancier Wahoo Fish Taco's. The decor much nicer than WFT. Not quite elegant, but nicer than cozy.

They had what read as a nice non-alcoholic mocktail. Muddled blackberries, coconut water, ""lightly sweetened"" and a touch of mint. Sounded amazing, so I ordered it. I KNEW, I knew I should have asked about the sweetener, but I didn't.....and I didn't care for it. The waiter said it was a simple syrup but I've never tasted a simple syrup with such a weird taste. Also, nothing in that description would lead one to believe it's tea...but it's brown. Had it referenced tea, I would not have tried since I only like unsweetened tea. Anyway, on to the food!

We started with the humus appetizer. I enjoyed that A LOT. Very tasty humus, garnished with roasted cherry tomatoes', golden raisins (I swear, I dont like raisins, but I think I'm just kidding myself. I LOVE when they are added as an ingredient!) and some seed (not sunflower) on top. It is served with a salty like flat bread. I really liked this. I'd come back just for this!
For lunch, I ordered the fish sandwich; tilapia. It was better than OK, but not good. There was nothing wrong with it, but it didn't say WOOOOW either. I got the asian cole slaw and, to me, there was NOTHING asian about it except the chinese cabbage. They sweeten it waaaay too much, which is odd, since I really like a sweeter cole slaw. I think they are very heavy when they sweeten something here. I wanted to like the slaw, but I only had a few bites as it was just toooooooo sweet for me. (what's happening to me? next I wont like chocolate???)

Our server was Jason and he was nice and friendly. Drinks and food came out pretty quick. He checked on us occasionally to see if we needed anything else. The manager stopped by our table, looked like he was gonna say something, and walked away....kinda weird.

We shared a HUGE strawberry shortcake for dessert. 
I was stuffed and brought home about 1/3 of my dinner.  (I needed to save room for dessert,  right? )

Our server,  Joe,  was fantastic. When we told him it was our first time there,  he explained the menu and gave us his recommendations. When we told him we would definitely be back, he said he had been there since they opened so he would probably see us again. 

All in all, a great dining experience.",CM7-dWmlc-12c14ECJ1Wzw,0,0,5,Ta1LCWwZA6BDEQLQUDpsoA

If dining in at the restaurant side for a date night:
Portions sizes are not too heavy but not gypped 
Recommend 2-3 sides for the table to share (for 2)
Wine and beer are reasonably priced (IPA about $6)
Check online for their specials going on
Make a reservation if going on a weekend for dinner

If having a casual drink for happy hour after work:
Check online for their specials (Monday Martini $5)
Can order the full menu at the bar
TVs at the bar so you can catch a game
The fish or beef sliders plus an edamame to share is enough to fulfill your dinner needs

I'm not sure if it was because of our appearances we were a younger couple and family but she had a bad attitude toward us since the moment she walked up. I have been a server for 5 years from high end steak house to bar and grill, and I would have never got away with treating a table the way she did . Being my first time and bonefish I wasn't real sure what all was on the menu but we wanted to just go ahead and order cause we had a movie to be to in just a little bit , so I had saw fish tacos and asked which were the best she personally liked, she paused for a good 5 seconds before saying ""uhhhh there's only one kind"" I apologized as I just wasn't sure sometimes there is different kinds, when my husband went to order he didn't know he could get two different sides , as I looked up I saw her rolling her eyes as she asked what else he wanted .. Anytime we thanked her for our drinks or anything we never got any type of response, never got a smile or anything nice so we felt welcome. The booth beside of us of (an elderly couple) she was being completely different to as I started watching after my husband and I looked at eachother and were saying how rude she was.. She was smiling at them checking on them, making sure everything was great etc. last but not least , we were sitting in a booth with direct vision into the kitchen, as I was watching her get our food together , and she switched plates because some had gotten hot as I could see, without ever seeing her go wash her hands she grabbed a handful of fries from one plate setting it on the other that we were eating.. In total disgust and Awh I watched to see if she actually was going to set it down for me to eat, and she did.. So I did not touch my fries ... As I was looking for a manager to talk to no one came by my table , so I went on to eat the tacos , and I needed a different hot sauce than the one Caitlin had set down originally. Mind you it was completely empty in the restaurant other than 6-7 tables . So finally I caught the hostess who was cleaning a table and asked her is they had a different hot sauce , she said she'd go back to check and came back with another one . We didn't see Caitlin again until we were finished and she asked us if we wanted our check, but we watched her in the kitchen laughing amongst other employees talking the whole time we were eating except when she checked on the table next to us... We paid the bill and left and told my sister about the experience whom advised I complain to a manager , but I didn't see one and just wanted to leave after that experience and said I'd email someone ... I have never left a negative review in my life, being a waitress I get we all have bad days , but it didn't seem that way.. That was hands down the worst experience I've ever had & have never been treated so horribly and felt so uncomfortable or disgusted .. I will honestly never be back and never go to another bonefish.",nv-yWNKv_P22Woyh-Jh0-Q,1,0,1,yt0tEUdi579FNKZzYzLXiQ

3 Words: Bang! Bang! Shrimp! - It will rock your socks off. Seriously, the Bang Bang Shrimp app and Key lime pie dessert are worth the trip alone. I Pinky Promise... 

All in all, Bonefish is consistent.... which is a big deal to me when dining someplace multiple times. My love and I try to come here every few months on a date night and have enjoyed every appetizer, drink, entree and dessert we've ordered. 

During my last visit, we ordered: Bang Bang Shrimp, Salmon (with lemon butter sauce), Rainbow Trout (with lemon butter sauce), Key Lime Pie, Spiked Blackberry Elixir (Malibu rum, blackberries, sage, fresh lemon juice + coconut water for $5), and their Classic Sidecar & Mango Twist (Amber brandy, mango + sugared rim $5).  The service, food, and atmosphere were all top notch. I would even push my review to 4 1/2 stars.  

TIP: Wednesdays at Bonefish is $5 bang bang shrimp= ALL NIGHT.  Also, they have a great happy hour menu (see pic) that runs 4:00pm - 6:30pm Sun- Thurs.",3Qv2rjPXC2eNKyV5lh3J_g,4,1,4,phpKXxrUZQk-UMJk7QD1Jw

One of the best parts about the restaurant (aside from the deliciousness of the dinners) is the price.  Instead of going to Bartalotta's at Wynn and spending $200 a person, you can go to Bonefish and really indulge there for a mere $100 per couple (including everything).  So, when it comes down to it - both places give you super-fresh fish, but only one gets it to you at a great price.  I love this place and am hoping to visit there (and eat) again soon.

However, after checking out the Bonefish Grill menu (with pictures) I was certainly enticed by all their seafood options and thrilled that they had a non-seafood appetizer I thought my Hubby would be interested in trying. 

Last Saturday we decided to give it try for lunch. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted and told we would be seated momentarily. It wasn't busy but the hostess needed to cleared off a booth for us.  Shortly thereafter we were greeted by our server whose white shirt was a mish-mish of food stains~ not sure if he had been helping out in the kitchen or what. He was very polite and answered our questions although got confused when we were asking about portion sizes. 

Since we had already checked out the menu on line we knew pretty much what we wanted to order: oysters, crab cakes and Wagyu beef potstickers for appetizers then a steak with garlic mashed potatoes & Truffle mac & cheese for my Hubby while I had Chilean sea bass with mango salsa, steamed broccoli and crab fried rice. Overall, everything was very enjoyable: my oysters came with fresh raw horseradish instead of the creamy sauce, the Chilean sea bass was perfect with the mango salsa and my Hubby's steak, although ordered well done, was not a dry charcoal briquette as it sometimes is when he orders is meat well done.  The only real disappointments were my Hubby's garlic mashed potatoes that just seemed to have an odd texture and my crab fried rice that just had shards of crab sprinkled on top. I don't think there was even a tablespoon of crab meat thought the dish. 

During our meal I noticed several other tables with bread and dipping oil.. I was already too full but wondered why we were not given any. Later a friend informed me that you have to ask for bread otherwise it will not be served. Geez, since it was our first time you would think they would have asked?!! Anyways, you've been warned--ask if you want bread.

I reserved our spot with 1 hr time frame to get ready and head out so that we weren't rushing. They also have text reminders to let you know when your table reservation is ready. Unfortunately even though we were right on time, we still had to wait an additional 30 min to be seated or get a response from a text message. The waiting area was cramped full of hungry people lol. Other than the waiting, my server had utmost unmatched guest service for us throughout our dinner. I apologize for not remembering her name but I left a generous tip for her. 

I love the layout of the area. They kept it old school with a revolving entrance door facing a rustic gatsby style bar. Our dining experience was a candle light dinner for the romantic intimacy. They covered the tables with white sheets and disposable paper - I guess it's for the easy cleaning after each brutal food slaughting experience. 

To get you prepared in advanced, expect to pay around $100 for the full course dishes from appetizers to dessert. We both started with their famous bang bang shrimp  which was super delicious! I want more!! Then we went straight for the specialties! I had the ""catch of the day"" Mahi Mahi with asparagus, creamy smashed potato, broccoli.  My other half got the lobster stuffed shrimp and fried rice! 

I will tell you this!! I will definitely come back for the bang bang shrimp! We skipped the dessert because our course dishes were so filling. For a plate that didn't look big and full, it sure made my stomach full. I guess it was all that bread and pesto from the start lol

My favorite brunch option is the Bang Bang Shrimp Benedict, but anything with their Bang Bang Shrimp is amazing. The Bang Bang Shrimp isn't spicy but it has a really great small kick to it. Almost all of the options are worth trying. The Surf and Turf Benedict is probably my next favorite. If you are really hungry definitely go for the burger.

I got invited to a Friends & Family brunch service which was also a training day.  There were limited spots and my indicated time of 12:45pm was pushed back to 1:00pm when I called in to reserve my spot, which actually worked out better for my group & me.

I am  breaking this into sections since it is all still fresh in my mind:

Decor - It is a nice, contemporary look with lots of windows & great outdoor seating.  The bar has a nice feel while the bar itself being, nearly, the width of the restaurant.  The tables are covered with logo'ed, slightly course, tan paper.  I sat in a bar high-top so I only viewed the regular dining area.  BTW, the happy hour runs until 6:30pm, Sunday-Thursday with 5 or so food & 5 drink specials.  I didn't really pay too much attention since I am reviewing the brunch service.

Cocktails - I ordered Bloody Mary's & tried a sip from a Passionfruit Mimosa.  The Bloody Mary consisted of Absolut Citron muddled with fresh herbs & tomatoes & something that makes it spicy (horseradish + ???) Garnished with cucumber slice, olive stuffed with cream cheese, and celery stalk.  The overall flavor is freshness.  Not the sweet/Worcestershire tomato vodka combination that I am accustomed to.  A big plus, the muddled tomatoes & herbs hide the vodka bite.  The Passionfruit Mimosa was sweet & bubbly; during regular brunch, this is an ""endless"" drink, YMMV, though.

Appetizers - Though Michelle, our server, called the A la Carte items appetizers for today's brunch, we ordered a chocolate croissant.  It was very tasty with some type of maple glaze on top & dark chocolate within.  Appetizing, yes.  Appetizer, no; more like pre-dessert 

Main Course - I ordered the Shrimp and Creamy Corn Cakes.  This was an outstanding dish with a good amount of spice for a Creole inspired dish.  The 6 large shrimp were served in their Creole sauce over 2 ""creamy cheesy corn cakes"".  These were lusciously fried with a light cheese & cornmeal sweetness.  A great platform on which to serve the shrimp.  This was a great dish and I would be hard pressed not to order it again instead of trying a new item. I sampled the potatoes au gratin.  For you potato & cheese lovers out there, we may have your new addiction.  I could have eaten this one item & been happy; very full, but happy, nonetheless.

Our server, Michelle was very fun & excited about the menu.  She had just gone through the tasting/training day and definitely was enthusiastic about many items.  I am excited about going back for dinner (Chilean Sea Bass in the Pan-Asian sauce).

The cost of our meal for 4 which was 4 entrees, 8 cocktails, and the ""appetizer' was around $100.  This seems a good price for the quality of food, which I would rate at 4/5 to 5/5 stars.  

Warning, the overall flavors here are bold with mild (IMO) spiciness in many items. So, if you can't handle the heat, ask your server what's spicy & if they can turn in down a notch or 2.

Watch here for a dinner review, hopefully, soon!",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,4,0,5,p8Gh5qO7z9pPirfpY37B6A

Came here for my first time this past Sunday!! So brunch is only available sundays here, their brunch menu is pretty small but tasty nonetheless! They have a deal which is $20, which includes bottomless bellinis, mimosas, and bloody Mary's, AND select breakfast items!! That's a pretty good deal considering some places charge $15 alone for drinks. Their drinks also come in a lot of flavors as well. I ordered the surf and turf eggs Benedict on English muffin, which come with a side of potatoes or seasoned veggies. It was super good! Came with one English muffin split in half, so it was two of the eggs Benedict pieces and it was really good!! I'll be back",fj-cFMD2qheCcv3FNvMcEg,1,2,4,X65oLUa3iR1qu_IxT6CVpw

I was well taken care of. I started off with the lamb chops. They were cooked medium. They were tender but no real taste or flavor. They were bland. I had the mango salsa salmon with haricots and sautéed spinach. The vegetables were delicious. The salmon, however, was well overcooked. It was very dry. It was not very appeasing. Thankfully the spinach was sitting in a bit of garlic au jus. That helped me through the salmon. If I was asked to come back and visit here again I think I would choose somewhere else.

The restaurant is located in the outskirts of townsquare by las vegas blvd at the NE section of the shopping center.

We arrived just before dinner was starting and were seated in the dining area within a few seconds.  The waitress was complaining to the manager saying, ""really i have to do all these tables?"" This really irked me and literally made me want to leave but i figure i would at least try out the food and enjoy my company with my lady.

Initial Service: The waitress wasn't very pleasing as she came to our table with this ""Why do i have to serve you"" sort of expression which continued to ruin my experience there.  Took about 15 minutes for our drinks to come out.  I got the bonefish martini which was actually pretty good and gave a decent buzz.  She got the fresh cucumber collins which was refreshing.  

Entrees: We read all about the bang bang and we basically did a drive by.  We ordered bang bang tacos,  bang bang chicken and bang bang shrimp lmao.  Plus it was a good ""bang"" for the buck being $6 for each entree during happy hour on i think it was a wednesday?  The entrees were all very good but it was too much bang.  The sauce they use is like a spicy mayo with green onions.

Ending:  I ordered another martini and noticed something shiny in my drink.  Thought it was a golden ticket for Wonka's chocolate factory but it was aluminum from a whisky top.  I reported this to the manager and he apologized by saying hes not sure how they got there but it must've been from the ice machine.  He ended up comping one of our bang bangs and getting me a new drink ""metal free.""

Overall:  Poor service with the waitress.  Great alcohol and good food. Check your ice cubes before you sip your drinks

We ordered the Hawaiian martini and let me say that I felt like I was in Hawaii after taking a sip of this beautiful drink accented by coconut water. 
After enjoying fresh hot bread and pesto,
we started with the ahi sashimi...one of the best and better than Roy's. The ahi was so delicate and had a perfect sesame crust with a light wasabi sauce that wasn't overpowering but complimented the ahi.
We both order the filet mignon...available in 6oz or 8oz portions. Get it with the Gorgonzola butter!
Service timing was on as the sashimi came out within a few minutes and our filets were ready right after we finished the appetizer.
The filet was cooked to the perfect temp for each of us and very flavorful even without the delicious Gorgonzola butter...but it made it so much better. The potatoes au gratin were the perfect portion and cheesy with a breadcrumb topping.
Our favorite dessert here is the strawberry shortcake. In season strawberries with whipped cream atop fresh creme anglaise (it's like melted rich vanilla ice cream) and a flakey shortcake biscuit. Great way to end our wonderful meal.

Unfortunately the food quality has gone down but the kicker for us was the very apparently sick waiter. Sneezing continuously in FOH and even heard him from BOH (seated by the kitchen door) to the point he wiped his nose on his work sleeve as he approached our table to handle our setting.

We stopped in as a family on a Saturday night (admittedly, after another restaurant next door had a 45+ minute wait) on a whim (read, no reservations... not usually a good idea for this town) and were seated immediately even though the restaurant looked pretty busy.  

The hostess was cheerful and friendly.  Our waiter (Josh W. I think-- it was a few weekends ago) was great.  Fantastic attitude, expertly handled multiple random questions from the child, and was attentive but not overbearing.  He answered all of the questions we had and made good recommendations on the menu.  The rest of the staff who helped out at the table did so without getting in each other's way, were all professional and courteous, and they were all smiling (I remember, because I wasn't having the best night and it really made a difference in my attitude to see them all smiling).  


The food was great, portions were just right and flavorful.  The atmosphere was appropriate for a Saturday night dinner.  It was conversation-level noise, not too much but not too quiet.

4451774,2014-10-12,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"This chain located in Town Square (right next door to Texas de Brazil) has been one I have been meaning to check out. I have heard friends and co-workers tell me it is pretty good. I'm always a little hesitant to check out a chain over a locally owned place, but it wasn't half bad.

I came here for a friend's birthday, we were seated in the large, darkly lit dining room. I began my meal with a really great riesling - Chateau Ste Michelle from the Washington valley. A very easy-to-drink, and not overly-sweet riesling. 

Next we had appetizers - crab cakes, which were disappointing, small and poorly plated. Served with some sort of sauce I did not partake in. 

The ceviche app, however, was pleasing - with large portions of shrimp, scallops, and perhaps some type of white fish? I wasn't sure. However, I did enjoy the sliced fresh jalapenos and chunks of avocado. This ceviche is served with a good portion of chips that are salted.

I had to have their ""bang bang"" shrimp which I have heard rave reviews about. Instead of getting it as the app, I got it in their ""Bang Bang Shrimp Tacos"" - which come out in a set of three with flour tortillas and your choice of sides - I got the kettle-cooked potato chips. Overall I would say ""eh"" to the tacos. I thought they would be more spicy - they were not. Fortunately, the tacos were filled with shrimp, so you get a good portion for $13.50, and the tacos themselves were generously sized.

Lastly we had their macadamia nut brownie, which arrived warm and gooey, with raspberry sauce and scoops of vanilla ice cream. We all shared - and we were all stuffed. But, at the end the management also brought my friend out a plate of chocolate-dipped strawberries with some cream and we also had those.

Service was up-beat and management did check on our table. At the end of the meal my water glass was left un-filled, so that was kind of disappointing, but none the less, a small ding against what overall was a good experience.

I would come back, especially since their menu has a lot of seafood items (obviously). I would say good for a party, especially if you have people that are not ""outside the box"" with their food choices, but you would rather go somewhere other than say, Chili's or Applebees.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,0,4,A2tnDLdOUxlxFOTgISrgcg

was new. He was friendly enough but that's about where the positive ends. 
- The server brought bread out to the tables after we were done eating our entrees
- Food (everything!) was SO SALTY. I'm talking beyond what is normal for restaurants adding excess salt. My friend ordered steak and she was embarrassed that she had to send hers back because of how salty it was. They brought her another and it was just as bad.  
- Prices a bit on the high side
- SALTY!!!!! I know I said that already. I still can't get over it. Holy salt!!!! 
- Lot of mistakes with entrees and sides. I ordered a side of steamed rice and got some weird cheese potatoes. Eugene took it back to the kitchen and brought me the correct rice right away, not sure if perhaps the mix-up was the kitchen's fault? Other people at my table also got wrong sides, or their entree orders were completely wrong.  
- Servers made us pass steaming hot plates to the back of table instead of individually serving dishes to us. Huh? Who does that? Is this pure laziness, lack of training, or bad management?

It was my friend's birthday celebration so we tried not to moan and groan about the service too much...but sheesh!!! and one of our friends asked the waiter if he could bring out a special birthday dessert which  she offered to pay for, and they didn't even have a candle. I know this is a petty little thing.. but thought it was a little odd for a franchise restaurant like this to not have birthday candles?

Nice venue, mixed age crowd, overall it seems to be catering to the 30+.

4. Special ahi ahi in wonton tacos (9/10), comes with a salad. Out of everything I would get this again

To start we both had the blackberry sangria which was $12 for bottomless as an add on to the entrees. The flavor was very good, it honestly tasted just like juice to me which is typically a dangerous thing. For a meal I had the caesar salad with added shrimp.

Ashley was our server and she was quite delightful.  Very prompt with service and not over checking in on us as we devoured our food.

Maryland Crabcakes kind of small, but I guess it matches the price. It's the lump type of crab cake if your wondering, what every crab cake should be! Not as thick of a patty, but in flavor, delish.  Side sauce complimented it as well. I think it was a spicy mayo sauce.

I went with the Chilean Sea Bass since it was a recommended entree.  I got the full order and I'm glad that I did.  If you are familiar with my appetite, I eat a lot .  It wasn't as flavorful, but i did order the sauce on the side.  It had more of the grill taste than flavor.  It was served with garbanzo beans and asparagus.

For those that are looking for healthy options, this is the place for you.  But if you have a sweet tooth like me, you need to try their brownie a la mode...hot brownie, drizzled in raspberry sauce, with macadamia nuts and topped off with vanilla ice cream.  Whoa, I just drooled.

Another patron at my table had a question so naturally I ask the first person I see about whether or not a drink is a well drink, our bearded server comes back as the other guy who was nice enough to answer leaves. 

Our server, yes the bearded short haired hot tempered guy gets offended immediately that we were talking to anyone other than him or the other server assigned to our group and says ""we are the only servers for you tonight don't talk to anyone else""

Things are great so far yeah!?? Anyway we have our water he takes some drink orders and all is fine then he's back and taking dinner orders. Great! Food! 35 minutes or so and still no bread and we had to ask for it! Thank god for this gem named Sadie (sorry if I spelled it wrong) she sure turned the night around the best she could.

Though shortly before her timely and welcomed entrance to our lives he took some dinner orders and then forgot some others at the table, and I don't even think he put in any of the food orders until he got all the drink orders down (we all know they make their money on alcohol) so as more of our party gets here, the few of us in the first pack that didn't order wait until either he finishes taking all the drink orders or thankfully Sadie showed up.

She was quick to take the orders and get any drink orders he missed and was very polite, and she overheard us r alking about the bread we wanted and jumped right on it.

We arrived and settled into our seats (the first group) at around 6:30ish, we didn't get our food until around 7:40ish, as some people were late but some of us ordered well before people arrived but no one cares they just want their tips!

I came here for a birthday brunch and the service ruined the experience. They only had one server to attend to 30-40 people who came for a bottomless brunch. Before even pouring our first glasses, the server gave us attitude and mentioned that ""the minute that anyone becomes too intoxicated, this party will be shut down."" Although I understand the reasoning behind the warning, it was extremely off-putting.

The next big red flag is that we arrived to a pre-set menu that no one was aware of - including the birthday girl who made the reservation. She had a large party but no one mentioned that she would be under contract with a set menu and price point. This made things extremely difficult at the end of brunch as it took us over an hour to pay and the price/gratuity (which wasn't even well-deserved) just kept increasing.

I've been to bonefish grill before brunch and warned my friend that they would likely ""run out"" of supplies for bottomless brunch. And just as I predicted, they did. 2 hours in and barely any of my friends had been served more than 2 drinks and they no longer had supplies for the mimomas or sangria.

My visit last August was pleasant with just minor hiccups. I spoke well of them and planned on returning. Six months later, my dining experience was just okay -- not bad, but nothing spectacular.

By no surprise, I was really taken by their Bang Bang Shrimp ($10.90) -- fried shrimp tossed in a deliciously creamy and spicy sauce. It's their signature dish (complete with trademarked name) and there's a reason they build all their marketing around it. The appetizer, however, wasn't as good the second time around. I'm not sure if it was just the preparation that evening or if that's just how it's served now. They also offer their prized shrimp in tacos and for $5 on ""Bang Wednesdays"" (4pm-closing).

Other appetizers: Twisted Edamame Hummus ($5.50) -- topped with roasted tomatoes, pepitas, and served with crispy flatbread chips and Wagyu Beef and Ginger Dumplings ($9.30) -- pan-seared with crispy onions, Thai peppers, and soy sauce. The hummus was all right, but the dumplings were pretty good.

During my first visit, I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass ($29.90) with Chimichurri sauce (no longer offered) with two sides: Chorizo, Edamame, and Corn Slaw and Red Quinoa Salad. The entrees come with a seasonal vegetable and additional choice of side, however, I requested another side in lieu of the vegetables and paid an extra dollar. The fish was exquisite. All their fish are grilled over their wood and it was delicious. It was a really nice size for the price as well. The Chimichurri wasn't very good though. I really liked the slaw topping, but the quinoa salad was flavorless. 

Ruben and I shared the Baja Fish Tacos ($14.10) during my most recent visit. It's made with grilled Tilapia, flour tortillas, mango salsa, lime crema, shredded lettuce, and served with housemade chips. The fish was good, but I didn't enjoy anything else. I'm not a fan of the use of flour tortillas for tacos, I didn't care for the mango salsa, and the lime crema didn't add enough pizzazz. The housemade chips were okay, but had no flavor.

For beverages, my friend and I shared a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc: ""Attitude"" by Pascal Jolivet, France ($36) and I also tried their Signature Pomegranate Mango Red Sangria ($5.50). Both were really great selections. They also have a white sparkling sangria, but the server suggested the red.

Desserts: As a recommendation from our server, we tried the Jamaican Coconut Pie with Rum Sauce (no longer available). It was a warm coconut pie (well, ours was improperly reheated) with very strong rum sauce. Not very good. I also tried their Crème Brûlée featuring Madagascan vanilla custard served with fresh seasonal berries and whipped cream ($7.30) and Chocolate Crème Brûlée - decadent and creamy chocolate custard made with a hint of Grand Marnier and housemade whipped cream ($7.30). The Crème Brûlées are definitely good. I really like that they used Madagascan Vanilla since it has a more robust flavor and the Chocolate version was delicious! That splash of Grand Marnier really made it.

Service has been odd. Both times, the servers have been really nice, but there's been disconnect between the servers and the kitchen or something. The servers would disappear for long periods of time, but otherwise would be very attentive. One of our friends didn't receive his pre-dinner course prior to our entrees, but the server was nice enough to remove it from our bill. It was still difficult for him to enjoy though. Also, there was absolutely no timing between appetizers and entrees. The complimentary bread is delicious, but it wasn't offered the first time.

I do like the ambiance and decor, but it seems to have identity issues. The decor, menu, and prices portray a nice ""date night"" dining establishment, whereas the butcher paper, vinyl tablecloths, and heavily fried menu feel like your typical casual dine-in restaurant (without the benefit of cheap prices). For the most part, the food quality seems (slightly) better, but not sure if it's worth it.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,6,5,3,YMBmA5xQXugmnpsWCknaig

When we arrived they did not have our reservation so they gave us their private room which was nice (without charge I might add). The food was delicious, the service was a little slow but really considering that they probably were not prepared since they did not write down the reservation, the wait staff did well. I also want to thank the manager who did take care of the mistake and treated us well. Many of our lunch group members had not been there before and said they would go again. 
A very pleasant experience. I would also go again. My only other complaint is that they do not have clam chowder. I am always surprised when I go to Bonefish and they tell me that.

4744400,2013-09-16,4,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Holy fried seafood, Batman.  Between the Singapore Calamari, Bang Bang Shrimp, and Fish and Chips, I think I've had my fill of fried food for a while.  

We started with the Singapore Calamari and Bang Bang Shrimp for appetizers.  The calamari is generic, with too much breading for my tastes.  It does come with some fried peppers, which was a nice treat.  The Bang Bang Shrimp is their most popular appetizer, and consisted of crunchy breaded shrimp in a very mild sauce.  Both the calamari and shrimp were supposed to have a spicy sauce, but on a scale of 1-10 they were both probably a 0.5.  A positive is that the portion sizes are very generous; if you're not sharing, it could be an entree for one.

I opted for Sir Will's Fish and Chips because the description said it was tempura style, and because the fish was tilapia instead of the usual cod.  The fish itself was really good, nice and juicy and again, generous portions.  Sadly, the batter was less tempura style and more Long John Silver's style; a giant block of fried batter that encased a filet of fish.  Crunchy and thick, it didn't do anything for the fish.

I don't think Bonefish Grill would ever be my first choice if I'm at Town Square, but I also wouldn't dismiss it if someone else wanted to try it.  Based on the tilapia in the fish and chips, I'd want to try their grilled fish entrees.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,6,5,3,WnVIPnDDwRm4bYbomwQgUg

We ordered the bang-bang shrimp benedict, a denver omelette, original eggs benedict and a salmon salad.  Oh, we also ordered calamari for an appetizer, more on that later.  

For $11 the omelette was small, however the asparagus side was a nice touch.  This breakfast would leave anyone that was hungry, still hungry.

The potatoes that came with the eggs benedict were tasty although without the ""browned top"" you get when home made.  Both of the orders of eggs benedict came with undercooked eggs.  The bang-bang shrimp them selves were ok, however I hoped for an unusual flavor, but they were just spicy.  Since they appeared on the menu three times I expected a ""wow"" factor.

The salmon salad was a bit pricey but generous and pretty good.

Lastly, the calamari.  This of course was the first thing we tried, or tried to try.  They were overcooked and under flavored and hidden in a mass of lettuce and crispy noodles.  In retrospect we should have sent them back, they were that bad.  This is a seafood grill and they cannot get calamari cooked right? Come-on!",jVV1jqwx7MTKm1nhs1gVpA,0,0,2,WqaBilFtFpPrrmsEQe5wjQ

I know I ramble...so I thought I'd put my bottom line up top! :)

Anyways, so I had seen Bonefish Grill a few times while driving by Town Square and I'd made a mental note to come back, about 500 times... 

Finally...I remembered!  Boy am I glad I did. 

I really didn't know what to expect...the restaurant is a new build and seems quite large from the exterior.    

While walking up, I noticed a cute little seating area out front, I imagine it would be a nice place to wait when the weather warms.  The front door is a revolving door, SO EXCITED!  What can I say?  I like it. It reminds me very much of New York and gives the restaurant a very cosmopolitan feel.  

After going in, I was pleasantly surprised.  The restaurant was just that...a real restaurant.  (I didn't know what to expect...corner bakery style, chipotle style, a super loud Cheesecake Factory style...or what?!  It was none of these!).  We were greeted by a dark wood bar area with ample seating and also high tables for quick sit down dining.  Adjacent to the bar was comfortably lit and serene dining room.  Windows all around, but with shades so you don't feel like you need sunglasses while indoors. (Don't you hate restaurants like that?!)  The hostess was very nice and friendly. We were seated right away in a long booth. Very comfy.  Our waitress greeted us shortly afterwards and since it was our first time (she asked) she went through specials and favorites. I loved her introduction. Sometimes, I find the waiter/waitress (at other places) insincere or uninformed...but out waitress seemed genuine, knowledgable, and interested in us having a good meal.  Ordering was difficult only because I can only eat 1 meal at a time.  :)

Our food came in no time. And I mention this because the dining room was about 75% full with one table that was a large party of about 15.  I ordered a salad with grilled chicken. Salad, onions, corn, black beans, feta...all fresh and delicious. The grilled chicken breast was cut super thin, which I appreciated since it was on a salad. Without me asking, the dressing was on the side. And oh my, their house vinaigrette...LOVE!  I think it's a white cider vinaigrette...but I could be wrong. SO GOOD!!!  

My lunch date ordered tilapia tacos...I didn't try them, but she said they were YUMMY!

I decided I had to come back for the sea bass.  I CAN'T WAIT!

I got the grilled scallops and shrimp. The scallops and shrimp were small. Got like a dollop of the garlic mash and it was salty. They put a bunch of carrot and green onion garnishment that was just a waste and in my way of the food since it was on top. I had a piece of someone's hamburger meat mixed in my sauce. I got the Pan Asian sauce cause the waiter said it went well with the scallop and shrimp. It was your typical ""sweet and sour"" flavor. It just tasted salty to me. The side of veggies were corn, beans and I don't even remember. It didn't pair with the dish well. 

My husband got the salmon or halibut. I don't remember. He said he liked his dish. Also got the bang bang shrimp as appetizer and that was good. They had a happy hour or sale on that app. I also had the corn chowder soup which was delicious. Lead me to believe my entreé was going to be good. 

We were celebrating two birthday celebrants and they don't do candles or singing here. The ambience was low lighting and small space. It made the birthday boring! Food was boring, place was boring, service was boring! 

We ordered dessert for the birthday celebrants. We got the flatbread sangria thing and that was just disgusting. $12 for that flatbread. That just needs to be taken off the menu. We also ordered creme brûlée and brownies with ice cream for the kids.  I think those were good according to the kids. Guess you can't mess those up.

4934646,2014-03-21,2,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Hmmmm,  I really liked Bonefish and when I was there entertaining clients at their Orlando Florida restaurant, I was wishing that they had one of these restaurants in Las Vegas.  My dream came true and I am tried this place yesterday with the family.

Overall, I have to give this a weak three star.  Here is the deal, it is both good and bad, I will go back again, just that it was not what I expected.

1.  Let's go with the good stuff first:

a. Ambiance - Very nicely decorated franchise restaurant,  good size bar with Sports on. Very friendly staff and greeters. Very efficient.

b. Availability - I like the fact that I made a reservation 1.5 hours before dinner and was able to get a nice table by the window.

c.  Service - Pretty darn good, very attentive and very willing to please.

d.  Menu - Very large menu, something for everyone.  From seafood appetizers, hamburgers, salads, fish, chops and steaks, dessert, very cool.  Plenty of draft beers and a ""just right"" selection of wine.

2.  Now, let's go with the odd stuff next.

a.  Ambiance - As the sun was setting, why would they lower the lights in the restaurant and open up the window shade that was at our table?  It brought in the oddest, most unpleasant light from the dusk that was not light, but an eerie glow and feeling. It was also odd to have a motorized shade going up while you were eating right next to it.  I don't want dusty bits flying around while I am eating....

b.  Food - We had salmon, seared Ahi Tuna, Chilean Sea Bass, Atlantic Swordfish Oscar, steamed broccoli, steamed asparagus and steamed medley of vegetables.  To me, the sea bass was absolutely wonderfully just okay. It was small, and I ordered the asparagus which cost 2.00 more.  Now I know that asparagus compared to broccoli and string beans is more expensive, but for 5 sprigs of asparagus, I would think 2.00 extra is a bit much.  Also, the sea bass was okay, but what got me was the size.  I am thinking the size was either small, or the plate was way too big.  Perhaps the 5 sprigs asparagus took up too little room?  The grilled salmon was good, I stole a taste from the kids, but I am not sure if they were happy to see a glaze on the salmon. I think it was a miso glaze, but you know, it should be on the menu.  The Ahi Tuna was pretty darn good, just that it looks like a lot because it is presented over rice so it looks like a good portion. 

c.  Overall, I find the food was uninspiring and not excitable for me. I would try perhaps the steak or hamburger next time.  Also, some non seafood appetizers would be good for the kiddies.

I will try the place again, just that I need some motivation for this place.

Service was terrible...both of our drinks were empty when our fish came and the guy never offered to refill them, not during the meal or even at the end of the meal...

Also, I showed the girl at the front a gift card at ""Roy's"" upon entering the restaurant which is in the same family of restaurants and asked if they accepted it...she said, ""yup, expires 4/30, we take this"". 

When the bill came they wouldn't accept it and the manager didn't care what I had been told before we sat down.

That reason on top of the horrible service moves them from a 4/5 star review to 2 stars.",r52bugu98l77gdqTnIJ2oQ,3,1,2,n7dG-uCkeF6tK9y-J9S2_Q
5123831,2015-02-22,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Just speaking from my experience, this seems to be another chain restaurant like any other Applebee's or Chili's. I'm solely basing this on non fish items.

When we first arrived, we were greeted and informed that a table or booth would be about a 20-25 minute wait, which is not bad at all, or we could sit down immediately at the bar area or at some communal tables. We decided to sit at one of the communal tables and we're quickly given a menu and ordered some water. The menu had a majority of grilled fish or shrimp as entrees. We opted to skip this and order other items as I always like to see what else chefs are putting out, in my experience, if you're specializing in one protein but have other items as well, the other items tend to lack. 

To start we ordered a Lobster Bisque. When it came out, it looked very promising. The color of the bisque was very vibrant, there was a reasonable chunk of lobster meat centered on top. The flavor was delcisous but was a bit thick in my opinion to be a bisque. The consistency was that of a gravy, it could've and should've been a  it looser. Entrees ordered were the Baja Shrimp Tacos, Basil Fettuccine and Truffle Mac and Cheese. Drinks ordered were a BlackBerry Smash and Raspberry Iced Tea. Our drinks arrived in about 15 min, a bit long, but seeing as covers were high for the night I did not mind. I did notice that there servers were wearing chefs coats, or are they actually the chefs serving you?? I was a bit confused. I did see 2 people who seemed like chefs come out and give people their plates but, came out of the kitchen with their aprons on. From my schooling, I remember that this is a big no no! Anywho, back to the food! All the food arrived at the same time, under 20 minutes which was good. The reason it was not a bad wait is, one of the servers was walking around handing out free samples of their Bang Bang Shrimp. Nice touch. These are battered, fried shrimp covered in a sauce. It almost reminded me of orange chicken from a Chinese restaurant. 

The tacos ordered were good. The bang bang shrimp were used for this. It included some cabbage slaw and a mango salsa with a fried ""tortilla"". Not really a tortilla of course, more like a thin fried dough. Next! The fettuccine looked great so I was anxious to dig in. I was disappointed when I put my fork in the pasta, I got a huge lump of pasta. All of it seemed to be stuck together as if sitting in my plate for some time after served. I literally had to use a spoon as well to tear apart the big chunks. Oh, and did I mention I got a BASIL fettuccine, where's the basil??? I had more artichoke hearts and grape tomatoes, just call it what it is! The mac and cheese, if I could call it that. Presentation was nice, served in an oval shaped ramican, the mac was topped with crunchy panko crumbs. Mac was in a white cheese sauce with mushrooms and truffle oil. First off, the sauce they tried to pass off as a cheese sauce seemed to be a thickened bechamel sauce. Where's the cheese??! I dug deeper into the dish and noticed that the bottom of the ramican was lined with mushrooms. Seemed like I was served half mushroom and half mac. The blackberry smash I ordered was nothing special either. Blackberrys muddled with lemon then served with water and a bit of sugar. That's exactly what it tasted like! Did I mention that the plates being used were extremely hot! So hot, that on two different occasions servers had to put plates down on our table on their way to their destinations because their hands couldn't handle the heat, even though some had cloths to hold the plates. One guest to my right did not seem too happy when he had to send back his steak because of it being the wrong temperature. His friends were waiting to start because of this mistake. Their party of 3 arrived before us, and we left first. 

Is it bad to say that I left this place still hungry? I'm not attempting to discredit anyone, I'm must hoping that this place can improve as I had been looking forward to tasting the food here for some time.",AQ0NRRasg_FA403S5gKEDA,0,0,3,xKjimEtV_w51vnb5fiJg2A

5138132,2014-01-04,0,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Bonefish Grill is part of the same company that owns Carrabbas, Outback, Roy's, and Flemings. I am a huge fan of this place. They have a great menu with daily specials. When you walk in, you'll notice a nice dimly lit restaurant and the wait staff well dressed and uniform. 

We went the week of Christmas and I got the Lobster Thermidor Dorado. I finished my plate as I usually do when I dine here.

I suggest the Bang Bang Shrimp or the Singapore Calamari for appetizers.

For main entrees, you basically select the fish/seafood you would like and then you select the sauce it's cooked in. My favorite is probably the Sea Scallops with Mango Salsa. The four choices are: Mango Salsa, Chimichurri Sauce, Lemon Butter, and Pan Asian. 

This is a great place with reasonable prices (under $20 for most entrees). If you like Carrabbas, Outback, Roy's or Flemings and you enjoy fresh seafood - this is a must try. 

5 Stars for service. 5 Stars for the Quality vs Price of the food. This is much better than most chain restaurants but it's not fine dining.",w_5hU-XrILq_lH1Ctkaa7Q,2,1,5,8DZoFkBZm-8MM2gdNr5X6A

She ordered the kids scrambled eggs with bacon and toast, and I ordered the bang bang shrimp eggs Benedict with the au gratin potatoes.  Service was pretty decent and attentive.  However, when the food came out, both of our orders were incorrect.  Instead of the kids scrambled eggs, they gave her eggs benedict (which is not even on the kids menu), and gave me asparagus instead of the au gratin potatoes.  We ended up having to wait for my daughter's order, so obviously this wasn't a ""we just brought you the wrong plate"" kind of mistake, they totally didn't even do her order.  They brought my potatoes out right away, but I wasn't going to eat while my daughter was waiting for her meal. So I ended up eating cold eggs benedict, which I can tell is not very tastey.  To top it off, one of the eggs was only like half an egg, couldn't find the yolk.  

I would also recommend that you tell the wait staff how toasted you like your english muffin for eggs benedict, because mine were hardly toasted - it was like eating straight out of the package.

Edamame- Pretty run of the mill and nothing to write home about, but damame is always delicious.

Coconut shrimp- Definitely the winning appetizer dish of the evening. Some of the best coconut shrimp any of us at the table had ever had! Even my mother, who is not a shrimp eater to begin with, absolutely loved them. And the Thai chili sauce was delicious.

So first off, we came in and asked for a table for two. They took us to the high top tables at the bar that are so super close to each other that you are practically sitting on your neighbors lap. That may be ok if you are at happy hour and open to mingling and doing a little networking. Or even if there is a long wait for the dining room and you are just famished that you just don't care. Totally not appropriate for a Saturday night date with my man. When we asked the hostess if there was another spot we kind of expected her to have to check first. Nope. She knew right where to take us. It's as if she was coached to take us to the uncomfortable bar table first to see if we would just settle first. Not cool!

Now I will say our server (I believe his name was Justin) was awesome. He was on top of it and helped us navigate through the menu. I settled if the the crab crusted cod. It was just kinda meh. I sucked it up because it wasn't bad. It just wasn't tasty either. My boyfriend got the trout which he hated. It was extremely oily/greasy to the point where he had to send it back and order something else. We both had the bacon Mac and cheese which was mind blowing. Put a cape on that dish because it literally saved our dining experience. Now thumbs up to the manager (Shelley?) for coming over and addressing our dissatisfaction with the trout. She was great and extremely professional.

Because of the great service by our waiter, the attentiveness of the manager and the bombalicious Mac n cheese, I will probably give it another shot but most likely just for happy hour drinks and appetizers.",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,9,9,3,Q8fTpp67Ep-6XNFJtkZkeg

This was at 12 in the afternoon, there were many staff members standing around, since there was only about three tables I would expect them to try to clean the place a little bit. Skip to the food, it was not very good for the price and even if it was a little cheaper I would have still thought it was bad. The service was actually good, our waiter was very nice so it wasn't his fault that the place was dirty and the food was bad. I went back to the bathroom an hour later and it was still Not cleaned. Needless to say I won't be coming back. Cleanliness in a restaurant should be very important to the owner.",tTHcfWDlnap6HbxURFzlOg,0,0,2,VpFN6DiCZczR71XBsZ80Bg

Tito's Texas Martini may be the best in town and such a deal as well. We really enjoyed the Paco & Lola Albarino but it's $10 less a bottle at King's Fishhouse.

We loved the Bang Bang shrimp and Seared Ahi appetizers. However, the dinners were the real stars: Dorado with mango salsa on the side was incredibly fresh with a nice taste of the grill. Ditto for the Redfish special with Romesco sauce, on the side of course. Overall the food quality may be better than my memories of the old store in Henderson.

A couple of suggestions: I don't think open bus/service areas will ever be as popular as open kitchens were, so build a wall and add a door. It's ugly and distracting to have that area open to the lovely dining room. About those window shades, they're going the wrongway! Something is needed to block the lower part of the windows, to obscure the view of the parking lot and keep headlights from shining into the dining room.

A few minor issues that should be addressed but great food and drinks at reasonable prices. Hope they stick around for a long time.",6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw,0,0,4,lj42bSL1g5HUO2FH9Pba0g

My girls and I have been here several times.  When that happens, the husband gets sad because he feels like I am keeping him away from something amazing.  So, I had to take him there for my birthday dinner one year ago.

This review is for my overall impression of Bonefish from multiple trips.  Delightful happy hour specials.  I cannot come here without having the bang bang shrimp.  The last time I was there, I decided to opt for the bang bang shrimp burger.  With shared apps, I did not finish my burger, but that meant I go to take it home and enjoy the following day for lunch.

Sign up for the email.  Bonefish will send you emails for discounts or other fun events.  I feel like they are teasing me with the brunch that they offer on holidays.  I will make it there one day!",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,1,1,4,f3k_XKh1WKxnh3N2zVKMHA
5531156,2013-05-30,1,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"Our birthday girl (mother in law) is on a diet and wanted a low carb dinner so we figured bonefish would be a good spot, she had never been there before. 

Location is in town square,  but a stand-alone building so parking was ample.  They have a cute outside area which would be nice to hang out and have drinks. Interior was nice, looks similar to the bonefish that was on Eastern that has sadly closed. 

We went for an early dinner and we were one of the first diners in the joint. our server Jamie was very nice, chatty and patient with us. They have iPads to take our order which was nice to see a company embracing technology an using it to their advantage. 

We started off with the Hawaiian martini, it'a a little sweet for my tastebuds but the MiL loved it. We also ordered the mango martini which was very refreshing and had a nice little spice. I enjoyed the red sangria taste, however no fruit included- which I though was a little odd. It was entered into the iPad and instantly sent to the bartender- pretty cool!

We had the bang bang shrimp appetizer and edamame, both excellent. The soup is so tasty, that was slurped up in an instant! Eric enjoyed the Lily chicken and gobbled it up!  I had the server surprise me and she ordered the sea bass which was cooked to perfection. The MiL ordered dori picatta and was deeply disappointed. She had a few bites and ate her green beans and half of my sea bass. Honestly the scallops, fish and shrimp tasted quite awful and dry, like it was a frozen meal thrown in the microwave. We aren't the type to complain and the server saw she barely touched her food, so she sent the manager over to talk to us. The server and manager did the right thing and it was removed from our tab. It was a nice surprise and refreshing to know that there are still restaurants that care about the food, their reputation and most importantly, taking care of their patrons. 

We polished off our meal with a coconut custard pie and they gave the birthday girl a small box of chocolate which made our dining experience better with the birthday girl leaving with a smile on her face. 

Had it not been for the picatta, i would have rated this dining experience a 5!  But we'll be back!

First of all, the service was GREAT. We barely noticed that the drinks and food were coming out slowly because our server was so helpful and attentive. We even took a while to decide on what to get and he never rushed us. 

The drinks were pretty delicious and a good amount for the price. We had the grapefruit margarita, a sangria (I don't remember which one), and a white cranberry cosmo. The cosmo was too strong for my friend's taste so our server kindly brought us white cranberry juice to mix. 

I won't bore you with every single detail of the food. Let's just say that you definitely need to get the bang bang shrimp. So worth it. The highlight of the food for me was that their portion sizes were perfect (read: not 10 servings on one plate) and the seafood was cooked amazingly as well. It's easy to overcook seafood but everything was tender and of good quality (firm, turgid meat). 

The price is a little steep but I think we were just unprepared for the epicness so my friends and I will definitely return once we're ballin'. You do get what you pay for.

Every time we have been here we have excellent service and the food is amazing. The only thing I ever had that I thought the portion was small was the french toast. It tasted good but not enough . The food is placed on your plate really nice and always looks so good when it comes out.
The flavors are always wonderful.

I always order the lobster bisque soup no matter what. It is so good here. 
For one of our lunches we ordered the hamburger. It has to be one of the best we have had in Vegas. You can taste the quality not some cheap greasy meat!! Its awesome!
Another thing they serve before dinner is the bread. Oh wow me and my husband could not stop eating it. Its so good we could make a meal just out of that! lol
Everything from the time you sit and eat to desserts are the best!
It is almost like eating at a very expensive restaurant without the expensive prices!!

Usually we are too full to get desserts but this one time we had to try one our waitress recommended ~ it was the Crème brûlée oh wow it is THE BEST!!! So creamy and the flavors just burst in your mouth! You will savor every mouthful!

5829303,2018-05-14,1,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"My boyfriend and I went to the Bonefish Grill last night to celebrate his graduation. We made a reservation online, however when we arrived we were sat in the bar area and not the dining room... even though we had a reservation. Therefore, our server was the bartender who didn't come around to greet us or bring us water for about 20 minutes. It seemed like a semi busy night so we let it go. He eventually came over and we ordered a drink and the Bang Bang shrimp appetizer. The appetizer took another 20 minutes to come out, and BOY WAS IT DISAPPOINTING. I do not know how this is a signature menu item, in fact the thought of it makes me sick. Fried shrimp that is extremely overdressed with their overly creamy bang bang sauce. We then ordered our meal and sat there for 40 minutes without our server coming to check on us or to tell us that our food was on the way. In fact, several managers walked by us and never asked us how we were doing or reassured us that our food was coming. Honestly, we could have probably walked out without saying anything and no one would have even realized that we were gone. Our server, the bartender then returned to talk to us at 8:18 (mind you our reservation was made for 7:15) he told us he would check on our food. So we see him go to the kitchen and then he never came back to tell us anything about what he just went to check on, he just went back behind the bar and continued serving drinks. At this point my boyfriend and I were fed up, we just asked if we could pay for the appetizer and drinks because it was getting ridiculous by this point it is now 8:35, the appetizer was disgusting, and the service was extremely poor. Mind you, once again a manager never came over, she was hanging out with servers sipping on a coke and chatting. The bartender allowed us to leave without paying for anything even though we offered to pay for the drink and shrimp (that we didn't even eat because it was disgusting). No wonder this place has so many bad reviews!!! Businesses in Town Square often close when they are subpar, can't see this place being here in two years. Never again.
ALSO - there are 3 other bad reviews just on this one day!!!! 05/13/18.. what horrible restaurant management.",5HqZ2NYwDivAchQa_HY9nQ,0,0,1,lmUFWreHUckK-y1lmkpo4A

We also had the calamari which was good but not near as good as the shrimp.  For entrees we had Chilean Sea Bass with Asian sauce, spaghetti squash and steamed asparagus and another entree of filet mignon and Maryland crab cake with garlic mashed potatoes and spaghetti squash.  There isn't one bad word to say about anything we had.   Everything was hot, fresh and tasted amazing. We were all impressed with our dishes.  And dessert....holy crap was it good too.  Pumpkin Creme Brûlée, flourless brownie with raspberry sauce-ice cream & macadamia nuts and last but not least cinnamon sugar doughnuts with chocolate and sea salt caramel dipping sauces.

We ordered the fish tacos and pad thai shrimp; the tacos had a little kick to them and the shrimp were so thick and delicious. 

What made this experience that much better was our server Billy. This guy is super cool and genuine, unscripted and real. It's nice to come across these rare servers that I wish could be copied and dispersed amongst all other restaurants. 
When I come back I'll definitely ask for him

There are many items on the brunch menu that include shrimp, lobster and crab if that's your thing!  I had the California omelet which was probably one of the best omelets I have eaten.  My husband enjoyed the bottomless bubbles a little too much.  Service was fantastic!  

We are using their event room for an event in January (which is why we came to sample brunch) and WOW!!  The room is very nice with floor to ceiling windows, seating for 55, a drop down projector & screen and a podium.  The room is no charge and they don't require a number count which is a great benefit since people don't know how to RSVP anymore.  They offer a brunch, lunch and dinner event menu.

5890413,2014-06-22,8,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"We ventured over here for lunch away from the strip. It's a nice mid-range restaurant. The server was friendly and very efficient, which made the dining experience pleasant.

I had the bang bang shrimp. I was curious since it seems to be a 'thing' at Bonefish Grill. It was just ok. I expected something spicy that would be filled with a burst of flavor. It wasn't. It was fried shrimp with a light creamy sauce coating. If you're going to say something is spicy - it really should be spicy. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't heat either. The tortillas on the soft tacos were hard. I'm not sure if it was because the tortillas were not fresh or if they were grilled and left out too long. The side of pesto couscous was good. It was light and refreshing.

One dining companion had the grilled fish of the day lunch entree which was rock fish. Mango salsa was added. He got a side of Asian slaw. This dish was so good, he didn't even share one bite. He said it was really good. The other companion had the Lily's salmon lunch entree with fries. I didn't try this one either, but at least he offered. It was a beautiful presentation on the plate (except for the fries).

For dessert we shared the coconut pie. Keep in mind this isn't a cream pie (in case you're more familiar with that). It was served with whipped cream on top. It smelled sugary and sweet. Once I took a bit, I was intrigued. It had a familiar taste. The consistency and flavor was different, but it reminded me of coconut butter mochi. It really seemed like this dessert was inspired by one of my favorite treats. Yay! This dessert will definitely bring me back here!",j7yDFhbyYf9JDJRdbCTHZg,10,8,3,7eM8-oEvWJ6JEcubpl-49A

I decided to start with the oatmeal for breakfast $3.90. Not much you expect from oatmeal... But the problem is that they gave me super sour/tart with awful tasting blueberries that weren't ripe. I had to remove them from the oatmeal. I told the waitress about them and didn't really get a sincere response. Next thing I see is another guy taking the box of blueberries somewhere else from the kitchen...I hope I don't get sick from it. Then I had the oscar omelet which was so so.

When we arrived we were promptly seated, and our waiter approached to take our drink order, once we received our drinks we then ordered some appetizers to share... we started with the Cold Snap Fresh Ceviche and Thai Coconut Shrimp.  The ceviche was not that exciting to me, felt there was something missing from other ceviches I have had- but the coconut shrimp was delicious! For lunch I chose the Shrimp Pad Thai, I was very pleased with my selection. 

I would recommend Bonefish Grill- they had decent lunch specials, and the food was good.  I wish that our service had been a lil better- our waiter seemed to be a bit sparce on the appearances even though the restaurant did not appear to be full. Once we ordered the appetizers our waiter did not return till after they were delivered by a food runner, he then proceeded to take out lunch order- just seemed to be a large gap of time in getting the appetizers after we ordered them followed by quite a time gap in actually getting to order out lunch.",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,1,0,3,HoBcs70gKbl00ReVfRKOHg
5913675,2018-04-19,1,Q5olb1x6FGk2oLAlc9p5Lg,"We had a bad experience here the other night so I definitely need to downgrade my rating to two stars. 

I got an email about two weeks ago for a pineapple shrimp and coconut risotto special which sounded great and thats what brought me in. While looking at the menu I didn't see it listed. I asked our server about it and she thought they still had it but said she would double check. She brought our drinks and still hadn't checked on it. 

When she came back to take our order she said they didn't have it anymore, that was awfully fast to take it off. Anyway I ordered the seared ahi with potatoes au gratin and steamed broccoli. Although the ahi was very good the sides were absolutely horrible. The potatoes were way undercooked, almost raw and the cheese sauce tasted like something from a birds eye frozen box. The broccoli was so overcooked it was totally limp and tasteless. I showed the server and she said she would tell the manager. 

We had plenty of room for dessert since I didn't eat the sides. They had a chocolate lava cake specials described as ""hot molten chocolate center"". When it was delivered it was completely cooked through. No lava in the lava cake. It also was only served with whipped cream, no ice cream. The server saw we weren't eating it and we showed her the inside. She said she would have the manager make us a new one. The manager brought us a new one but it was practically the same. Again we didn't eat it. She brought us our bill and nothing was taken off. 

I don't ever expect free food, but I sure don't think I should have to pay for something that I didn't eat because it was cooked improperly. The manager said he was sorry for all the issues we had and gave us a card for a free bang bang shrimp. Ya, thanks but we won't be returning.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,2,0,2,qNtO0PHaNH_P0ZERmLUU-A

The first.. Amazing - 5 stars
Our waitress was fantastic, our martinis full to the top, and the food was delicious. I was a big fan of this place.

The second...  Atrocious - 1 star (only because they have to get at least one)
Our waiter was rude... First thing he said when he came to our table was 'are you all 21?' (our group ranged from 28 to 40s...) He proceeded to take our drink order, and at the very end asked for our IDs - Why not do that at the beginning? And why the attitude?
* He didn't bring our waters - first thing we asked for...
* We had to ask for bread.. Our waitress the first time brought it out first thing!
* My martini was about 3/5ths full this time... I didn't know I paid for a partial drink!

I am giving this 2 stars due to the bad taste left in my mouth and the fact I will not be returning.

If you do go, stay away from the waiter with a tattoo of a blue ball or something like that on his arm... He will ruin your experience. Consistency is important and this place does not have it. And so is employees with a good attitude!",Y9MQoKoHkD62iGT1_hikag,8,1,2,ZtOtu6ZvJwMGkyPi0c1Tzw

We had crab cakes, a bisque, Fontina Pork chops with mashed garlic potatoes and the Lily's Chicken.

The service was exceptional for the place being super busy. Our waitress was very attentive to us and even loved the baby. She made our experience great. 

We got the bang bang shrimp to start and it was delicious. It was highly recommended on yelp which is why we choose to get it for appetizer. For our entrees we tried the lobster stuffed shrimp and the crab crusted Alaskan cod. Both dishes were delicious. Even the garlic whipped mashed potatoes and potatoes au gratin that my husband got was good. The spinach made my husband's mouth dry/itchy so it was hard to eat and the green beans needed some salt because they tasted bland.
