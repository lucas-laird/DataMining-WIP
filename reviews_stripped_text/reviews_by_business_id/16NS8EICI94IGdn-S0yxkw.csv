The play area here is not only inside but there's no separation so all the screams echo off the walls and theres no area to sit where you don't have to hear other people's brats. Also, as usual, in public for some reason people think their kid becomes everyone else's problem and let them run through the whole place without any supervision!! The manager just watched and said nothing.  All doors are supposed to be open during business hours, but the door near the drive through was locked, I only know because I tried to walk around so I didn't have to deal with the three homeless men camped out at the main door begging everyone for money. I even told the guy if he was hungry I would buy him food, his reply ""you don't have cash?"" Wtf?!! And the manager walked right by them and didn't say a word.",MrgrBZBe9Fix0oGncpYTAQ,0,0,1,71Tz0tNdwu98485L_dcmYg

Okay, let's get straight to the point. I always get the worst customer service EVERYTIME she's the cashier. She shouldn't be there. No smiles, no greet, she just takes orders, tell you how much is the damage and would give you a weird look if you give her exact change.

Recently, i went there again to grab a quick lunch. Same thing did happen! Lol i ordered Mcbites and she forgot to put the sauce in my bag. As i was going through inside my bag, not even knowing something was missing, take note i was holding my bag in my arms, she shoots the sauce inside my bag like a basketball pro and then stares at me like ""there's your sauce bitch, you can leave now."" Lol it was sorta funny but come on! Say atleast excuse me?

Never heard any word from her besides, ""medium or large?""

She needs to go back to training or stay in kitchen.",vLViu2g_fVFqexb-NBhx4Q,2,1,1,WFKsa3U8DHiRNrxry4yp7w

1983986,2012-04-03,0,16NS8EICI94IGdn-S0yxkw,"We used to live in this area and have seen the deterioration over the past few years. They tried to keep up with the remodel that was going on through most of the McDonald's locations, but I want to say within a year (definitely less than 2), the community had already trashed most of the remodeled area. The seats are all torn (and taped together), tables are crooked, chairs don't swivel smoothly. 

The staff definitely lacks customer service skills as well as many of them lacking a basic understanding of the English language - which is a totally separate pet peeve of mine. 

We've been greeted with hostility, attitude, lack of any sort of pride in their employment. 

The only reason we go here now is to run in for a quick drink and run back out.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,1,0,2,R_4rjEzrYLzwJv9gV-TxWg

Blame Fast Food Nation, blame their rash of bad publicity, or blame common sense, but the ""food"" here isn't really good and we all know it. That being said, their double cheese burger tastes like childhood and you can't deny that, either.

I usually stop here to hit up the Redbox machine, but occasionally I'll pop in to grab a treat for my BF or a friend. Somehow, in the handful of times I've gone in, they've always been out of chocolate shakes. And half the time their coffee is lukewarm despite being fresh-made. 

Without fail, this place is always kind of messy, and their parking lot layout is a disaster waiting to happen- it's small and seems like half the spots are handicap-only, but luckily the lot itself connects on either side to the car wash and the Walmart plaza. Because you can't go to one without going to the other.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,2,2,gVEN1SjG6Lv6XwUqtQ9FYg

2705196,2015-02-17,0,16NS8EICI94IGdn-S0yxkw,Not a big fan of the Arches but I stopped here because they have WIFI.  I felt I needed to order something quick so I went right for the $1 menu.  Hot n  Spicy and Double Cheeseburger would be just enough for 5 minutes of internet.  Food was actually decent and came out hot and fresh.  My issue was that there was no place to power my computer.  The one outlet they had in the restaurant did not work. I am sure it was intentional because of the area it is located.  I looked everywhere for additional power but none was to be had.  Oh well  back to Starbucks I go.,8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,0,0,3,mxo9vZ15gUXC63jKj242Bg

I make it a goal in life never to step foot in these nasty soulless establishments, but AMEX was offering 5$ off of 5$, so I went into this place (looks as good as a McD can look from the outside) and as soon as I step foot I notice there are napkins all over the floor like if it was a part of the new tiling scheme or something. 

I grasp my Chipotle bag a bit closer. Get in queue.

There is this guy in one of the front-row stools facing the action at the registers that is praying over his poor, chemical/GMO laboratory-concocted excuse for 'food'. I thought I entered one of those live art installations I learned about in Art Appreciation and on World's Dumbest (which my girlfriend watches, not me!). Try to ignore him. 

Finally, after what seems like fifteen minutes (how is it that Chipotle next door not only took my order immediately, but had my food bagged and charged in less amount of time and it is REAL FUCKING FOOD?), I reach a really short Latina lady that seems like she has zero happiness left in her life and she wishes she was in whichever state in whatever country she is originally from instead of here. 

""Good afternoon.""
::weird look:: from the cashier
""Five dollar gift card, please.""
""Fif dolla.""
""Yes, ma'am.""
I try to hand her my CC in an awkward misunderstanding on procedure at McDonald's in 2012. 
She points at the self-serve CC machine aggressively angry.   
Seconds later, I am about to slide my card and she updates me on breaking development: no cards for gift card; cash only.
""Uh, really. Cancel that then."" 
I walk out in defeat. 

I have asked around regarding this seemingly concocted policy rule and was told to go to a nicer McDonald's. Well, it's really relative, because there is no such thing as a 'nice' McDonald's, simply varying levels of shittiness accompanying your shit faux-food. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,1,0,1,EiO8LnBMdV_0OQj1MpJRrA
