Pizza is true New York/Philly style. Good cheese, great sauce. We like the $7.99 large pickup special... you can't beat that price for a good pizza. Never any problems with ordering or staff. I can't imagine why some people posted complaints about them. Maybe they're trying to knock the competition? Anyway, a truly excellent pizza, and the price is right.

My previous review dated 11/1/14:
Pizza is amazing! Everything about the 16"" cheese pizza I got was spot-on. As close to traditional ""East Coast"" pizza as I've ever gotten in Las Vegas. Their $7.99 pick-up special for a 16"" pizza with one topping (I got extra cheese) is the best deal in town. It was delicious! And no problems picking it up, either.

I'm happy with everything I ordered, the 30 inch pizza half of it was Supreme and the other half was the Brother's Special, it was delicious (everyone who ate the pizza said so) and the service was great.

I ordered the large carry-out special for $7.99 and a canoli, I was told $11.87 for pickup.  Cool.  I ordered in front of a co-worker that was going to split the bill and food with me (not the canoli) when she went to pick it up, she was given a small, lunch-sized pizza - DEFINITELY NOT the one in the window advertised for the carry-out special.  She paid before they brought the pizza out, she protested and stated that we could not share that tiny pizza and there must be some mistake.  The guy there told her ""no mistake - that is what he ordered"".  She told him that it definitely was NOT what I ordered as she was present when I ordered and that she would wait for him to make the correct pizza.  He told her ""No"" if she wanted a different pizza she would have to buy ANOTHER pizza!!  She said she would pay the difference, if there was one (BTW....I was quoted $11.87 and she paid almost $16) and he still refused and said she would have to pay for a whole new pizza - he would not take that back.  He said the mis-communication was my fault (even though both of us heard me say ""LARGE CARRY-OUT SPECIAL ONE-TOPPING, PEPPERONI FOR $7.99"" and he was not to blame!  What BS!!  What happened to the customer is always right?  Plus two of us heard my order and he still claims that we were wrong.  He refused to take his pizza back or give us credit for it toward the correct pizza!  I told him his restaurant is on my way home and very convenient for me and he was giving away a lot of business.  He offered 10% off my next order!!!  What preposterous gall!!!  I told him ""Absolutely not!""  He said that was the best he could do.  I told him it wasn't good enough - he got my order wrong and that I would NEVER return if he didn't make this right.  I told him that we were both having a mis-communication, because I said ""Large One-topping Carry-out Special"" and he heard ""lunch pizza"" and now he was saying ""that is the best he can do"" but what I was hearing was that I could ""go ""F"" myself"" and then he actually said it!  He told me to ""go F@%# myself!!!

It is my opinion that the carry-out special is a loss-leader and they do not make much money on it, so this probably happens a lot.  Mis-communication and people get a MUCH smaller pizza.  I think this place is a SCAM!!!  Definitely not worthy of the ""Best in Las Vegas"" stickers!!

If you like decent service and want to be treated like a paying customer, AVOID THIS PLACE!!!

So we have become familiar with restaurants that make their dressings fresh. It's a big deal to us.

Prior to ordering online I called to ask about their eclair, the lady confirmed me that it was a chocolate filled eclair.
Which when I got it wasn't.
My fries were cold, tasted old.
And when I called back to tell them about my disappointment about my dessert, the guy sounded really ""bothered"" by my comment and said he couldn't do nothing about it because the owner wasn't there and when I asked him to get my number down he ""did it"" (who knows) and then hung up on me, no goodnight no nothing.
So now I ate cold old fries, and spent money on an eclair I won't eat.

I don't know where else you can get a 16"" large pizza W/2 toppings, 12 wings, 8 fingers (dipping sauces), 2 litter soda and we usually add fries for about 2 bucks more for around 33-34 bucks Feeds the family happily. Next time I have a receipt I will post a pic. Best deal in town and they save our order in their system for easy re-order. As for food we like the new your style pizza, my fav is the fingers get the hot sauce on the size and they are super crispy and not overly breaded. The wings are usually pretty plump not small and dehydrated like some places and love them hot. The fries are super good they just need to leave the container open a few or they get mushy from the steam on take out.

This time I walked in, saw the same sign to seat yourself, so I did. Almost immediately a the server came over and asked what I would like to drink. When she returned with the drink she took my food order. I ordered lasagna.

The lasagna is served in a soup bowl, a square of lasagna in the middle and covered with marinara sauce, with mozzarella cheese. The sauce was alright, a little on the sweet side, but tasty. The lasagna was nothing fancy, no ricotta cheese, just lasagna noodles, sauce and a little mozzarella on top. It was served with two pieces of garlic bread.

As I said in my previous review, the lasagna, bread and soda was one of the lunch specials, so it was $6.99.

Was it good lasagna, no not really. Was it worth the $6.99 price, definitely. You get a bowl of marinara sauce with pasta in it, some cheese on it, two pieces of bread and a soda. It was a filling lunch for $6.99.

I will probably go there often when in the area, I liked the lasagna, and the wings from my last visit. Maybe I'll work my way through their lunch special menu, there are 15 items to choose from.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,1,0,3,Mj5bUSGujnYZ_vqG4A3DNA

Regardless, I was excited to see a new pizza place opening up in the NW in my neck of the woods.  The menu is extensive and everything sounds great so I thought I would give it a try.  Last night I got a 10"" 4 item combo pizza.  I got pepperoni, meatball, mushroom and black olives.  It took about 20 minutes for the pizza to come out of the oven.  That is about average.  What took far too long was waiting for somebody to take orders.  There were no diners inside.  Cashiers were missing too.  I stood around for several minutes before somebody came from the back to start taking orders.  Not that there were many orders to take.  The phone never rang and I was one of just two people in there to place an order to go.  This is not a good sign for this business.  If it keeps this pace they wont last long.  Anyhow, I took my pizza home and ate the entire thing for dinner.  A 10"" pizza, it turns out, is not terribly big.  This was cut into 4 pieces.  It had sauce, cheese, pepperoni, mushroom and olives as expected.  It seemed to be missing meatballs though.  Usually when I order a pizza with meatballs it comes with sliced meatballs.  This, however, came with what appeared to be simple ground beef.  It was strange but at least everything was on there in one form or another.  The sauce was fine.  A little bit spicy I think.  The crust was thin.  Thin enough that it was crispy on the bottom.  Yet it was thick enough to still be chewy on the top.  And it kind of flaked apart.  That was nice.  But the crust seemed almost too perfectly round and too uniform in its thickness.  It was almost a prefabricated crust not unlike Pizza Hut or Little Ceasars just edging them out with better quality and more appeal.  This is not the greatest pizza I've had.  It is alright but I had higher hopes.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,4,2,3,jEtdMJYUMNpiwEDGDPsp7w

Our order for delivery consisted of Chili Cheese Fries with a side of ranch ($5.99), Smoked Gouda Macaroni and Cheese bites with a side of ranch ($5.99), a small 14"" Blanco pizza with extra cheese ($12.99), a medium Calzone with extra cheese meatballs and pepperoni ($14.99), a small dinner salad with extra BBQ blue cheese dressing ($3.99) and finally their large Kiwi flavored Italian soda ($2.49).

    Their ""small"" salad is a great size and LOADED with fresh veggies. Being the blue cheese dressing lover I am, I was intrigued to see a BBQ Blue cheese (?) on the menu. But, I was like, let's try it. It wasn't bad, but it's was literally just blue cheese with some BBQ sauce squirted on top.

    I was a little skeptical (and was warned by the boyfriend to not do it, lol!) about ordering the Smoked Gouda Macaroni and Cheese bites because of past experiences with places similar to this. But I was pleasantly surprised, they were really good! Very creamy and tasty! I had them for delivery, so of course they were not that crispy, but it didn't matter! The boyfriend ordered for his appetizer an order of the Chili Cheese Fries. I had a few bites. They were tasty too, but way too much beans in the chili itself.

    My white pizza was very tasty, albeit a tad over garlicky. Which is crazy because I LOVE garlic but it was just an over amount of what seemed like raw garlic? But it was great size for the price. I even called once I placed the order to add extra cheese on the pizza and the calzone because the third party delivery website didn't have the option, and the man who answered was super nice and did it for us. The calzone was HUGE. If your just ordering for one person, just get the individual size. The medium will feed like 3 people!! And holy moly, their marinara sauce must have been lava temperature because it melted the container like crazy. The only real complaints I would have would be that we ordered it with meatballs but got ground beef instead and the crust was super super doughy. 

    The Italian soda was yummy too, the kiwi was sort of a strange flavor, but hey, it grows on you! Also, we did stress in our order message to please call us beforehand because we sometimes have a hard time hearing the doorbell....We didn't get such a call :/

But hey I guess they thinks it's okay to treat customers badly.",fzqzea_ZSJLApdjUkj-U1A,0,0,1,1E_cGTtUg7SPTBR1z7C5pQ

The quality is just mediocre, definitely not the best I've eaten, but better than little Caesars (but more expensive too so I would hope so).

I came in here and sat down, no one greeted me or came up to me, I was the only person in the place and there were clearly atleast two workers who noticed me and ignored me. Waited about 2 minutes before walking out and going across the street to get sushi. I guess this place doesn't like making money.",4N-HU_T32hLENLntsNKNBg,19,5,1,oYKot5YYS3IPh405kEg2OQ

My address doesn't even match the one that was listed under my profile in their system and it's not an address that I, or anyone else in my family, has ever even lived at before. My father has ordered from them plenty of times and never had a problem. I asked to speak to a manager and the guy who answered the phone was rude and said she was out of town.

I ordered the pickup special, which is a one-topping 16 inch pizza for only $7.99. What a great deal! I also ordered a combo pizza. Very delicious. I will most definitely be going back!",A0Z_UchZuzddAJjnay2f0g,2,2,5,bdFOMGaxNappkKzK4GcAow

 Look, this is a mini-mall pizza place. It's not a 5 star restaurant that offers a violin player and valet parking. If you want good pizza and good food at a good price you will be fine here. You can get a tasty large pizza with 12 wings and a 2 liter of soda for $20, it feeds 3 easily. The ordering is a bit bizzare, you sit look at a paper menu and then get up and order at the counter...big deal...it is what it is and it isn't that big of deal but I do think having a regular server that takes the order at the table would be a better system.

They call themselves a NY pizza place. I got news for you. I lived in NY for 20 years. I never got a 24"" Pizza cut in squares like a party pizza. Here's a clue if the pizza rectangular then cut it in squares. If it's round cut it like a pie. ""Pizza pie"". The 1st time I wrote it off. 2nd time I called and requested them to put a note ""cut like a pie"" on my computer profile so when I order they know. Happened again. And it happened again. Now I have to assume its on purpose or their just plain ignorant. Either way I'm NEVER going back.

5647331,2015-06-16,0,DZwXQUa5KGUcJ0y4TO1pFQ,Tried this place for the first time last weekend. When I went inside their wasn't one customer and no one was working the counter. After about 5 minutes a Russian woman came out to the counter to take our to-go order. We ordered 3 Hot Pastrami sandwiches and one Chicken Parm sandwich. We are Sicilian so we are very critical of Italian food. The Chicken Parm sandwich was one if the best I had tasted in NW LV. Lots of sauce and breaded chicken Breast with a lot of cheese melted on a large roll. The Pastrami was marginal at best and NOT high quality meat. We decided to try this place again last night. This time we ordered another Chicken Parm sandwich and a Pizza with Pepperoni and Mushroom. This time there was less Chicken and the sauce was non-existent (none) hardly. The pizza was beyond thin - thin crust and the ingredients were scarcely on the pizza. The best pizza joints give you a Healthy dose of ingredients. The taste was also not much better then a frozen pizza. There was also not a soul in there on a Sunday night. Not a good sign !! The business has signs all over the windows that say Best Of Vegas but these were left over from the previous business Buzz BBQ. I will not be back.,-Ia1lWvBNdgGySyB2VSgNQ,1,0,1,lkgJ-dhYpEovcTTteJ0Xfw

I tried BBQ Chicken pizza things about pizza not setting well - first off there using the sauce idea completely wrong its either a BBQ pizza meaning no Pizza SAUCE or not consider having it on menu, I got it with Pizza sauce on bottom and the BBQ sauce on top first witch was way too sweat and im 30 so don't think I am some old person ( sorry ) but it was def. bland too couldn't taste cheese. I think if they had a tangy BBQ sauce and no pizza sauce ( actually saving money on the pizza because know your eliminating 1 sauce. Sorry but I am part Italian and pretty particular on my sauces. Honestly I could probably guess it was sweet baby ray's bbq sauce. Also got a red velvet cake witch was descent but could kinda tell store bought. Overall save a few bucks and go to little ceaser's and for those who say prices are cheap you gotta be kidding me at nearly $14 dollar for a small ( bbq) and some range higher for 14' the most expensive 14' pie is almost $17 dollars !!!! for a small pizza for that matter -- to me that seems a little expensive just for a 14' pie. This was a toss up between pellegrini and this place well guessing I should of done Pellegrini",8hJM27VoDr3rrOqWSQfrLw,1,0,2,6vNalzdFhqE-FajlZPwzFg
