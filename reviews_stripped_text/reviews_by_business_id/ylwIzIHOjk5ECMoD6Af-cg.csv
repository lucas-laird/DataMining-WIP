Ordered zucchini fries with marinara. I guess they usually serve them with ranch but they were out of ranch. Personally, I preferred them with the marinara. They were pretty tasty & there was a lot of them. 13 I think. My husband got the juicy Lucy. It had micro greens on it, cheese on top & a little inside, & tomato. He said it was tasty & would get it again. I got the caprese grilled cheese. The flavor was really good but it was incredibly hard to eat. Dare I say it had too much cheese???? Cheese & tomatoes were oozing out everywhere making the bread really soggy. I couldn't pick it up like a sandwich. I could of used a fork & knife. That's not how it like to eat a grilled cheese. Not something I'd get again. Too bad since it did taste good. Total food bill was just under $20. Can't beat that!",8Ox2EA8A7FVSzVEM3TRn7Q,3,3,4,9X3nAD7Ig6SFyLJe-QyE3g
1531157,2017-06-25,6,ylwIzIHOjk5ECMoD6Af-cg,"I'm bummed to see that Dish Functional All Chefs has closed! The punny name and juicy Lucy burgers brought me in, but this location just does not seem to be conducive to consistent business. Staff were friendly when I visited and it seemed they tried several promotions and specials to bring in traffic (rice bowl Wednesdays and Vegan Sundays!) but this is the second solid spot to utilize the kitchen and not be able to stay open.  I've heard rumor the staff are working on a different menu and planning to reopen, and I'm crossing my fingers it's true while simultaneously kicking myself for not revisiting when I had the chance.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,14,11,4,hGh7GiPVbMHJunK_gmuvcw

On a side note the drinks were great and the bartender Traci was very hospitable and was playing some great tunes. I planned on just coming for 1 drink but ended up staying for a few.  :)",NrAM-PnXUVJonZLeOL6NQQ,1,1,5,bGs010UqPAjcCo8GizluLg
3321544,2014-07-14,0,ylwIzIHOjk5ECMoD6Af-cg,"Daniel made dinners for me and a group of friends when we were in Las Vegas for a conference. Every meal was great.  We had a range of types of food from Italian to Phillipino to seafood. 

Several of the people at dinner were foodies and they all raved about the food. Every day friends would talk about how much they liked the meal from the night before and look forward to what was coming up that night. Standing at the refrigerator eating leftovers was a favorite past time of our guests.  

Daniel was very accommodating and asked for feedback on the menus before we arrived in Las Vegas and went over the menus with me before the meals. His prices were very reasonable.

If I were to be back in Las Vegas I would definitely have Daniel cook for me and my guests.",VH7y4oQwB86tdyuJcXSZ-w,2,0,5,z46HYrYVKEEc7uTIRWcUDA

4052488,2017-03-11,7,ylwIzIHOjk5ECMoD6Af-cg,"Dish Function All Chefs is located inside the Hard Hat Lounge.  If you've been here before, then you know that this place is tiny.  I bookmarked DFAC immediately after I seen the recent burger photos posted on Yelp.  I also browsed the menu and noticed that the prices for everything is dirt cheap.  It was just a matter of time before I finally checked off this burger bookmark.  

Daily Menu:
-7 different 8 oz. burgers ranging from your classic to a handful of gourmet beasts. 
-4 grilled cheese sandwiches
-Sides:  fries, onion rings, chicken fingers, zucchini sticks, mozzarella sticks, and a spring roll
-2 different desserts, a Funky Monkey and a mystery dessert.  

Specials:
-Tuesdays: Burritos and Tacos
-Wednesdays:  Chicken, Pork, and Shrimp Bowls.  Loco Moco's too. 
-Sunday is Vegan Day

I tried their Mushroom Swiss Burger and the Juicy Loose Burger (cheese stuffed burger).  Both burgers were huge, but I didn't have the same experience the rest of the Yelpers had.  Part of the massive size of their burgers is the bun.  I don't prefer burgers with too much bun.  I think it takes away from the actual main attraction and that's the meat.  Both buns were also hard AF.  The actual meat in both burgers were pretty good, but not as juicy as I expected.  I requested both burgers medium and was served something that was close to well-done. Overall, I just wasn't impressed.  

I understand all the 5 star reviews.  I really do.  The service at DFAC is top notch and sometimes excellent service makes food taste better.  At Dish Function All Chefs, you get a lot of burger for a small price.  My review shouldn't discourage anyone from coming here. Besides, DFAC has a lot of 5 star reviews already. I wish them the best.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,10,9,3,OGMrJ4pw0DgH0Jz5cavwFg
4072600,2017-03-03,1,ylwIzIHOjk5ECMoD6Af-cg,"I HAD A BURGER! 

It was everything i hoped it would be. I had the guy (sorry didn't get name) make me whatever he would eat, which turned out to be a mushroom swiss burger. When he asked if i wanted fries, i asked if he would have eaten it with fries and he didn't bring me any (nice to know hes not just trying to sell me something). The burger was a nice size, well built, and looked very tasty just sitting there. On first bite i was so happy inside, and continued to inhale the rest of it. The meat was of quality, the mushrooms cut ""meaty"" and of substance, with cheese that was very melty and not processed tasting, finished with a basic soft white bun. It was so good in fact that i went back and asked the gentleman to make me some more food please. When asked what i want, the reply was ""What would you have after that?"" Please just make me that, and out came some stuffed peppers. 3 peppers total, with cheese and bacon stuffed in them....whoa so serious. I don't even like stuffed peppers and I crushed those as well, although not as good as the burger they were still something i would order a second time after a burger of course. The atmosphere is definitely divey, sharing a space with the bar but the people were welcoming, smiles and good times had by all this Thursday evening about 10pm or so. Ill be back for another, maybe tonight even.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,1,2,4,Cy9WLYSYFiLoGQsBfLyIlg

4996412,2017-01-07,2,ylwIzIHOjk5ECMoD6Af-cg,"I'm so glad I stopped into the Hard Hat Lounge tonight and found this amazing source of fuel.

Dish Function All Chefs have a extremely loaded menu, great quality ingredients and my favorite being able to see your food being prepared.  Paul was the cook tonight and made a delicious Vin City Burger : I ordered the meat (medium well) egg (medium) and it was on point!!  So much flavor in every juicy bite!  

The Vin City Burger patty consists of ground beef, lamb and pork topped with cheddar cheese,  bacon (candy of meats) and a fried egg. scale of 1 to 5  I gave it a solid 6.5!  

The look and vibe at the bar has been recently updated and that burger sure did go down great when paired with an ice cold IPA from Tenaya Creek. 

It was definitely worth the visit and I look forward to trying the many other items on the menu. 

Enjoy!",u6wAG4h60a0vOikJ1wtjcg,8,7,5,DRwLV0My3qNqDGFnQfRoFg

They are a team of very talented crazy different individuals that come together and make a masterpiece. I definitely recommend them to your catering needs. I wish they had a restaurant that I can eat at on a regular basis .,0zBrNtzbCM-VhGjAXKfcLA,2,1,5,pYcs9m4LTzqcOhkhN5yOUw
