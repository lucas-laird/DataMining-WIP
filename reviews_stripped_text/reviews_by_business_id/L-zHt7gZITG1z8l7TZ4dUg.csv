Mango Gelato was bad.  Tasted sour.  

Mocha was not any better than drinking drity water.

This place is so dirty.  All the seats were sticky and no one cleaned the tables.  

Service here was so slow.  It took a long time to get my order in because they took so long to fill orders that they are supposed to bring to your table.  This place is terrible.

The prices were really high.  My gelato one tiny scoop was $7.

The Thanksgiving-themed panini was SUPER-hot, but oddly tasteful  with cranberry-studded bread, slightly dry turkey, stuffing, and bacon.  The sweet potato fries that came on the side failed, requiring tons of salt and pepper.  The roast beef, on the other hand, was ice-cold and was lacking.

Further I should have realized that when an ""ice cream shop"" is EMPTY in 110 degree weather, something was wrong with this picture - my fourth mistake.

Upon ""eating"" a spoonful of FOAM, yes, FOAM, I promptly cursed Rachel Ray and threw out the ""stuff"" and left.  By the way I also cursed MY STUPIDITY for not ""reading"" the signs before I purchased.

You can expect to throw away good, hard earned money in Vegas. Everyone goes there with that expectation called Entertainment value/expense. However, when an ""Ice Cream"" shop sells what tasted like 80% FOAM, you can expect to get angry. 

NEVER AGAIN.

I seriously prefer getting Casino Royale's lemonline margaritas for $1.   

For a nice mid-day snack, I recommend their kobe beef sliders.  Not sure if it was because of the kobe beef, but their sliders was juicy and so tender that leaves that MmMm feeling in your mouth even though you've long finished your meal.

We ordered two scoops of ice cream - cookies and cream and stracciatella (vanilla with flecks of dark chocolate).

The stracciatella was also yum, with chocolate laced generously throughout. The scoops were large - still not worth $6, but definitely not skimpy.

I ordered Kobe beef sliders to go, and we took it back to our hotel. The little burgers were perfect bites - with tiny tomatoes, melted cheese, and the rest of the fixings! The fries were also perfect - crispy, crunchy and just hit the spot. Sure, I paid a hefty price for it - so I was going to enjoy every single bite.

Sugar & Ice is located in the esplanade at the Wynn.  Near the many boutiques, Sugar & Ice should be the perfect place to grab lunch, a snack, or something sweet before venturing out onto the Las Vegas Strip.  Unfortunately, it's far from perfect.  

First of all, you can expect to wait quite some time for your food to be brought to your table.  The menu is quite limited unless you are looking for gelato or cookies.  If you're looking for a salad or sandwich, you will have to make due with very few options.  We ordered the grilled chicken panini.  To our surprise, it was just sliced deli chicken and not a real grilled chicken breast.  The bread was incredibly greasy and the cheese and aioli was way too salty.

My friends were all pleased with their selections too. I sampled the coffee and the chocolate and both were really rich and flavorful. I will definitely have to go back their again and try others. I do recommend getting them in cups and not the cones. After a few bites of the cone, it didn't compliment the fancy dessert.

* The four star rate is only based on their desserts.",lmDHMxksPqtfjhYJPMr_Rg,0,0,4,T0NHqDMIs5xO9_DSo3RAYg

The coconut crunch, cherry almond, and pistachio ice creams are really good. The double chocolate with oreos is really sweet. I have yet to try the rest. I've had the blt sandwich, and I think it tastes good with the crossiant as the bread. Again, this is a place to appreciate the Wynn hotel. They have an outdoor patio area with its very own lake and waterfalls. Great picture taking place!",Tk_FWXueutKii3f9yJFsdw,0,0,4,MprwOjQxS3uhzv4UUYsHsw

I highly recommend the pizza though if you are hungry for a snack or you want a quick lunch. Only $4-4.50 a slice, this place is very affordable! We came here twice just because of the convenience. 

They also have Free Wifi =)

Just fyi..they get you with the drinks. A coke is $4 !",ibvH1Y7Rh_tstiWgH0OFTA,1,0,4,mXER3lRKjocxvswnCBDHxw
5653441,2009-09-14,0,L-zHt7gZITG1z8l7TZ4dUg,"Whenever I find myself in Las Vegas and in need of an icy treat, I always come here. Hours are pretty awesome -- closes at 12am, which is great since I'm always out late during a Vegas trip!

My sisters and I have come here quite a few times and found out about it through Food Network. I'd say that this place beats the more well-known ice cream places such as Dreyers and Haagen Dazs.

They offer a variety of treats, from gelato to sweet potato fries. My sisters and I always get their gelato, and it never fails to disappoint. My mom even likes this place a lot -- whenever she wants to eat ice cream, she says, ""Let's go to the gelato place in the Wynn!"" My favorites are the Cherry Almond, Pistachio, and Coconut Crunch. They've got sorbets as well, with a number of fruity flavors. The cost is a bit steep (about $4) for a ""single scoop,"" but they actually give you two fair scoops, so it's not so bad. The flavor is great, especially since the summers are so hot in Nevada.

Decoration is awesome, but the service is kinda whack. The cashiers aren't so nice all the time, but it's not a huge deal. There's outdoor seating near the Wynn waterfalls, so it's great and relaxing. Come by if you want a break from walking and want some refreshing treats!",RPgHIlmwH0F-mlg6Ny42og,2,1,4,DDGsEXLTa74naKD44Ts1GQ

We stopped in here because wanted to have an easy, affordable breakfast. I had a croissant with bacon, eggs, and cheese. It was a little greasy, but that's probably what made it delicious. My boyfriend had an omelet. They were about $10-12 each. You order at the counter and they will bring the food to you promptly. The cafe has a great location overlooking a waterfall and miniature lake. There are plenty of umbrellas so you can sit cool in the shade. I'd definitely recommend it if you are looking for an affordable place to eat for breakfast or lunch!",T7x7M9xhScyFx1tnawzDOQ,2,2,4,A3EoKEQVvdU55jAYplAy9w

After vetoing every borderline-fancy restaurant inside the Wynn we had one choice left, Sugar & Ice.  Thank jesus we lucked out.  We got to wear our shorts, we got to sport our tennis shoes AND we got to enjoy the purdy Wynn waterfalls on the patio... and didn't feel like scrubs.

Sugar & Ice has a pretty basic menu of sandwiches, salads and burgers... it's a bit pricey... but it is the Wynn and it does have a super cool patio.  I'm not really justifying it.. but I wasn't surprised and you shouldn't be either.

My only regret is not having a chance to try some ice cream.  Boo hiss.",ZtmeHAQyNFku338dJMIfTg,0,0,5,AhX5j2-uznZ3UWaBb3lbCw
5806963,2007-06-21,0,L-zHt7gZITG1z8l7TZ4dUg,"This is as close as Wynn gets to an ice cream parlor. This place serves desserts and light snacks. It has a view of part of Wynn's water features. I've been here a few times, but so far haven't had anything except gelato. Coconut crunch varies from very good to excellent - very good coconut flavor, rich ice cream, and a pleasing crunch. Peanut butter ice cream is merely good - rich ice cream, but the peanut butter/chocolate flavor is too sweet.

While the food is nothing to get excited about, it's a very pleasant place to stop and relax, especially if you can snag a table outside, right next to the waterfall.  Stare into the mist and forget you're in Las Vegas (ignore the minor distraction of a 3,000 room hotel in the background).",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,0,3,B2H67FGawFKAu-rQ9gq4gQ

Price: Pretty cheap, a nice place to dine for lunch

Location: Located in the Wynn, a short walk from Fashion Show Mall or Treasure Island.

Atmosphere: I liked the atmosphere here. Sugar and Ice is very cute, it looks like the inside of gingerbread house or something! Also there is outdoor seating near a waterfall.

Service: Okay, not super friendly at all",fccMIyBd6ZhFUVAhvSqsrw,0,0,4,1E4-zZH0pJlFt5gkyzZcrg

5919914,2012-11-19,3,L-zHt7gZITG1z8l7TZ4dUg,"Having had fig gelato in Bellagio at Lake Como in Italy I was expecting something out of the ordinary here in Las Vegas. When I stepped out back to the patio and heard the roar of the rushing water, my senses were enveloped.     

It was as if gelato reached way high and met Yosemite's Bridalveil Falls.  Even though the waterfall might have seemed out of place, I appreciate all the hard work and imagination that went into this patio.  My dad being a retired landscape contractor likes explaining to me what an endeavor of this proportion takes to build.  A spectacular patio all just for gelato?  

Ok, so you don't like gelato?  Just walk in the back and walk out.  

A lady in line repeatedly asked for frozen yogurt and she was told they only served gelato.  I ordered salted caramel and and even though it was somewhat sweeter than I usually have, I liked it nonetheless.  More of a sugar rush than sugar & ice for me.",cZzrlxbs_JaYW1hraGfzaw,3,2,5,yNOfBG0xgFl4G2Rtu3zcUg
