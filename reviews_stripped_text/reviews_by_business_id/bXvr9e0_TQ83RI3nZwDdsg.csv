180663,2014-01-22,0,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,I keep telling myself to give this poor place another chance but unfortunately I went again on December 2013 and the service was horrible and the food as usual not good at all.. Whenever there is any Latinos in town or Colombians I highly DO NOT recommend this place at all since I do not want to make any enemies..If you are craving Colombian food go to Los Angeles there is quite a few places there that are authentic and deeeelicious! the decor is horrendous I feel like I'm in a cave someplace,pbaUro52jT5UAJv2uXFbgA,0,1,1,GT8K0TArmuLalSqZh15Qew

I can only think of a handful of times I have actually walked out of a restaurant in which I intended to eat at. Unfortunately, this was one of them. This is why:

My fiance and I bought a deal over a year ago on restaurants.com to try out this place. We were actually really excited to give Columbian food a try, but for whatever reason, hadn't gotten around to using our coupon. We finally decided to just make a plan, and go for it. We looked over the menu and were really looking forward to coming here. We were expecting a little hole in the wall, with simple but tasty food. 

And maybe that is what we would have gotten on a different day. Unfortunately, the day we went, two major red flags were present. 

1. When we walked in, a handful of people were sitting in the ""front"" room, which is basically a convenience store front with a few tables. We weren't offered a seat in this room. Rather the hostess walked us to the larger back room- where the lights were turned off. She told us they were off because they were trying to cool the restaurant down- there is no air conditioning in the building. 

We arrived at 6:00 pm on a Wednesday. It didn't seem as though they were expecting customers. 

2. The second we walked in, my fiance and I both instantly noticed that the entire building wreaked of sewage. The smell could not be ignored. Sorry, but if the place I'm going to eat at smells like waste, I don't have confidence in your sanitary practices. 

I've never been in a restaurant that smelled, and we immediately left. The health department might want to drop in for an inspection.",BruI-D395yclzw0Xc1-dAg,1,1,1,KgFmfrooxR45qtbMU9R1RQ

369805,2012-11-22,2,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"We go to this little spot on Sahara and Decatur quite frequently! Ever since the day when we wanted saimin at Aloha Kitchen but by the time we got there, we had changed our minds and wanted something different? So I remember one of my friends ""checking in"" to Oiga Mira Vea and her caption was pretty eye catching. It said : "" YUUUUUUMMMMMM""... Yeah, that's pretty much all I need to hear or see to know where I'm going for lunch! So it's small inside and there's a wooden door that slides back to reveal a restaurant/night club during late night hours! GENIUS! Also, the entire staff is family which I always love! This is definitely your typical hole-in-the-wall that serves some of the best food kind of place! Try the Cuban sandwich which is marinated pulled pork (carnitas) on a soft grilled french style bread smothered in white melted cheese, pickles and a little mayonaise.. I know, doesn't sound healthy when you write it all out, but hey, you don't go to a Colombian spot to eat healthy that's for sure! Oh yeah, if you're not a fan of oil drenched soggy fries, (which I'm not) then you might wanna skip out on eating them or getting them all together... Just stick with the sandwich! But honestly now, we all know the real gem in this place is their empanadas! I can't explain how I feel when I bite into one of the beef delicacies? By the way they have chicken and vegetarian as well for you non red meat people out there. Just make sure to ask for extra Aji sauce because that darn sauce is the closest thing to eating pure bliss! It's so simple and fresh and I love it! If you're still not full then head on over to their glass case where they hold their baked goods and try one of their freshly fried bunuelos!!! Pronounced: BOON- WELL- OHS...I think?  Anyhow, they're balls of dough that has mixes of different mild cheeses inside and then it's deep fried! A very heavy snack but it's worth a try! So just so we are all clear on this... When making your way to Oiga Mira Vea; please make sure to either 1. Wear spandex for comfort purposes. 2. Bring a designated driver because you might not fit behind the wheel after wards. Or 3. Go on a juice diet 3 days prior so you can prepare your body for the experience you're about to have here! ( FYI, I would personally go with number 2. since it's never fun to eat alone anyways.... OK yelpers- Buen provecho!",7a2R54AK5a75uKmXes8XbA,1,1,5,yG2LO-6_fOLE0m7v9XkE8Q

I have celiac and felt great about everything made from scratch with few flours except corn and hominy.  The corn/cheese and the corn/cheese/beef empanadas are a must try.  And the selection of Latin sodas and juices are amazing, literally from all over Latin america.  The service was amazing friendly and helpful... Bragging a little about the homemade choices is a sign of pride and knowledge.  Hubby tried the skewers... Were very good... And the soup with chicken (galleta) was delish.  Not fancy.  Humble yet tasteful.  Kind of like grandma's from the other side of the tracks.  Must try.",YOT2Subnl2MhtWktFrZjwg,5,0,4,Lo9dvfGiV8zZQTz9Kgf0Sw

Clearly she loves her native culture and cuisine!  The adjacent large dining room was occupied by a small ""meeting"", so we ate at the small tables in front.  The food was very good, and probably quite authentic.  With the gratis samples (lagniappe, a practice that probably reached both New Orleans and Columbia from the Inca), we were able to sample a variaty of new foods.  We were very satisfied with the experience.  We felt we got more than our money's worth (even besides the voucher), so we tipped generously.",OcfNKrvTrOxSiJi3VoeKyQ,0,0,4,z_uaStF3c2XMH5Z0zW5qog
1292249,2013-05-01,0,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"Based on Yelp reviews, our party of four headed over to Oiga, Mire, Vea, excited to try a cuisine that we weren't familiar with.  Truth be told, we hesitated going in.  The outside of the restaurant is off-putting ... but hey, we're here.  Let's give it a go.

And boy, did we enjoy our dinner!

I actually jotted down and ordered other posters' recommendations.  We had sweet plantains, arepas, vegetarian empanadas, bunelos, garlic potatoes -- wow, that's a lot of garlic! --  skewers of chicken and beef, what looked like pork schnitzel.  Yum.  I particularly liked the Columbian condiment aji, a piquant mixture of cilantro and onions.

If you go to this restaurant, know that it's not fine dining.  The décor is hum drum -- perhaps even depressing -- but the food?! Real good!  And plenty of leftovers to take home.

March 2015 Update:  We were ushered into the same bleak dining room, but the music was at such a high decibel that we walked out.  Rather than turn it down,  the server  seated us in the front room which doubles as a store.  (Subsequent patrons also refused the dining room.)

The food was as good as I remembered.  My daughter's steak look nondescript, but it was loaded with flavor.  Same with my grilled chicken.

My problem -- and I didn't deduct a star for this -- was the wait.  Service was interminable, and while our waitress was awfully nice, she refused to be rushed.  (We waited forever for our check, as she chatted with another table.)  An older woman -- the owner?  the server's mom? -- knocked over my fruity Columbian drink.  About half spilled on the table.  Did she bring me another?  Did she deduct it from our bill?  No!! (With the language barrier, I decided against making an issue.)

Next time, I think we'll make our order a take-out.",ZFR1aPaMDgWbzsBkVEHxQA,1,0,4,xU8VGo9wkX_iyK4TVw3A0w

The small dining room was very busy and the main dining area was being used for a meeting of sorts. Anyway..we were promptly seated and drink orders were taken. The take out business was non-stop while we were there. The server was fantastic with comments and suggestions on the various dishes.  

My wife had the empanada's (which came with a green sauce - not spicy) and I tried the arepa with beef, onions and red bell peppers. Very tasty. Never had Colombian food but we thoroughly enjoyed the food, the place and the service.
The meeting in the next room kept the servers busy so the kitchen staff was constantly playing catch-up. But it was all good. The Colombian soft drinks were especially good. The also have a small selection of beer.

The small dining room (about 10 tables) was decorated with hats, shirts and food items from Colombia. I recommend this place for those looking for an adventure in dining. Note; give yourselves plenty of time between the hours of noon to about one as that's when the daily meetings take place.

I love all the food from South America, but I've only had Columbia food via Florida. Florida's version is very heavy on the plantain sliders. My husband and I both ordered the milenasa. He chose the green plantain and I had the Maduro. The food was amazing! Rice  was perfectly cooked! My husband had half the amount of beef as me but mine looked  gnarly. I was expecting it to be disgusting but it was delicious. My husband ended up stealing my food. We used all the green sauce on the table! In San Francisco I can't even find culantro.

1702286,2015-12-29,1,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"I found this place a couple of years ago. I remember when the Bandeja Paisa was $9.99 and now it's $16. I know the price of food goes up but the plate has stayed the same- except for the steak which gets smaller every time I go. I don't usually come to this part of town. I live in Henderson and each time I'm here I have hope that it will be better -but it's not. Today the steak was tiny again, barely fit in my palm and the beans were so bland! No sabor whatsoever which is disappointing. Pollo loco has better beans. The menu is small for entrees and they should offer the specials menu everyday. 
I need to find a new place becuz I don't plan on coming back. ONLY GOOD THING IS THE EMPANADAS AND THE COLOMBIANA sodas. They know they get busy but they don't seem to be doing anything about it. Expand ur menu, get more staff so people don't wait 30 minutes before u get their order and don't be cheap with the food.

1868839,2010-11-18,1,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"My sisters columbian friend pointed us in this direction. I enjoyed this new ethnic experience. The moment I walked in, I was reminded of my my aunty's old restaurant shop. I do mean to say ""restaurant shop"" because that's exactly what it is. a restaurant and shelves of snacks, toys and other take-home things. I guess that's one reason why I love this place, for taking me back to a childhood I almost forgot.

I've never been to any other columbian eatery, but word is that the portions are huge. Which they were.. for me and my sister anyway. We shared this plate of ""Tamal"" which came with a side of rice. By the way, the rice was surprisingly sweet. Almost like sticky rice. It really complimented the spices in the tamal. I've also discovered the best made empanadas ever! probably even better than filipino empanadas =X. It's unique for it's crispy crust and its pasty potato & beef mix inside. And what set it in stone for me was the aji/ahji/ahhee (oh whatever the spelling is) sauce.

That place brought together family. Mainly because we realized we were sitting next to the family of my sisters friend. They also have a huge extended area. Cus the area we were in was the ""restaurant shop"" But the other side is specifically restaurant. It's good for big groups and such. Cus yeah, I'm all about rolling deep!

There seemed to be a whole family working. Food was made fresh to order and took a few minutes longer than one might usually expect to wait for an order, but the quality of the food more than justifies any delay you might experience.

The EMPANADAS with the green sauce were a great start to our meal: BF isn't typically a fan of these small meat pies, but he inhaled one and had to be warned not to eat mine as well. Acidity of the green sauce brightened up the flavor.
The LENGUA IN SALSA was to die for. No kidding, the sauce of tomatoes and onions and potatoes is heavenly, the perfect south American comfort food. The lengua itself was a plentiful portion, stewed to just the right texture and doneness that it fell apart beautifully.
The CHULETAS dish was also a gigantic portion, and the green sauce came in handy here as well, keeping the dish from becoming boring. Speaking of boring, most people don't consider rice to be all that exciting. The rice here is perfect: fluffy, light, warm, and flavorful, rather than just filler. I generally stay away from or go light on carbs, and this rice had me sneaking bites until it was all gone. Chuleta was served with a side salad, which came with several tomato wedges and nearly an entire lime- all very fresh!
Side of YUCCA- this version was nice and crispy like very thick steak fries, but I prefer them with a stronger garlic seasoning to them. Added a bit of salt and ate with yet more of the green sauce. Fabulous.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,5,5,4,JQ4z44HMnrIXRGGMw1fMaw

The table next to us was a group of 6 ladys.. And they were all furious too! They said they had been waiting 3 hours . The survice sucks!!!",KMfCGRqe-xNlVftRWnLMPg,1,0,3,g4o2_Gt_L3GOkEe6zTm5Aw

When I parked, I couldn't tell if there was a seating area, it looked like a walk up/ counter.  My sister and I were just planning to order some empanadas to go, but after meeting the owner and being fed his spanish greeting and his cultural energy, we decided to sit in. We looked thru the menu, very different of course, from a Mexican menu. But I have this weakness for tamales. So we ordered a couple empanadas and one Tamal, it comes with side of lightly sweet n sticky rice. Allow me to emphasize on the aji sauce. I love celantro and lime. Therefore I love this sauce. Dont be afraid to drench your empanadas in aji or drench you aji in empanadas. 

Its a family oriented little restaurant. Has that ""downtown shack"" feel to it, but it's no biggy to me when the food and service is on beat.

We also had some Colombian soda. Nothing special. But, we did buy some Colombian chocolate candy. Pretty nifty. 

Something I did notice, sis and i were already done with dinner, and just chatting it up, when I noticed the workers putting up chairs. I realized they were closed 9 minutes ago. It's truly amazing when these folks are patient and not trying to rudely get rid of us. I appreciate great hospitality.",DASkWfrV6kWHE_4xC7BkYQ,3,2,4,RrKQdln8q1rtAuFsURDTWQ

Tried the empanadas & they were delish. Had the carne asada with rice & beans. Rice and beans were good but the steak was a little tough but flavorful. The aji(green sauce) definitely enhanced the flavor of every thing. Will be back. More foods that I want to try.

We weren't very excited when we first walked into the door since the entrance area looks like a tiny deli place.  However, we were seated in the area that was adjacent to the shop area, and it has music and disco lights, yes, disco lights.

Since this is our first time Colombian cuisine adventure, we decided to let the very lovely waitress help us decide what we should order.  (on the side note, the owner and the wairess here are both SUPER FRIENDLY!!)  We ordered the Empanadas and the Papas Rellenas for our appetizers.  Both the Empanadas and the Papas Rellenas are to die for!  The only thing is, that the prices shown on the meny are ""per empanada"" and ""per Papas Rellenas.""  (so your bill could come back pricey!)

For the main courses, we had the skewers and the Tamal.  The skewers were wonderfully flavored, however, a bit on the dry end.  The Tamal tasted wonderful and has a WHOLE CHICKEN LEG in it?!!!  We ended up paying for $30 after our gift certificate, it wasn't bad at all.

We'd definitely visit this restaurant again; the food is wonderful and very VERY different from Mexican food.",fly4T2PUvDd3w1wWfxLhuA,2,1,4,_g_xXYLX1fqxn6qsIVSmRA

Usually salsas are too spicy for me but this one is just right and not your run of the mill tomato salsa. My staples are their empanadas and their papas rellenas. They also have a good fried plantain with a unique cheese on top that's good I just don't remem the name. The main waitress and possibly owner is very bubbly and friendly. All other staff seem to only speak Spanish so we're usually always helped by the bubbly lady.

The down sides to the place: it can get hellllla hot in there, the main restaurant area is kinda dark and with the fans spinning it hits the lights and creates a strobe light effect... So u may get a headache from thatz Service is also slow, so if you're looking to get in and out quickly, this is not the place. If you're thinking ""I'll just call in the order and skip the wait"" I thought the same thing. I ordered at about 1045am on a Sunday (today) and went in to pick it up a couple min passed 11. Food wasn't ready. The bubbly lady asked me if I ordered empanadas and I said yes, and I believe that was when my order was given to the kitchen bc my food was ready about 10 min later

2426756,2012-09-06,2,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"So here we go.  I ordered Chicharron con arepas y bandeja paisa.  Now had I known the Bandeja Paisa came with Chicharron and an arepa I would have just ordered that.  That being said those two things plus a Guava nectar were $22 which I thought was a bit pricey.  In any case - the chicharron was good.  Good amount of crunch, right amount of meat and fat left on it.  I thought it could have been seasoned a little better but they are probably just trying to tailor it to the American palette (which mine is not).  So what is the deal with Arepas?  They are just plain tasteless little corn meal patty things?  I mean I like corn meal but they are white corn meal not even yellow so not much flavor?  That being said they are soft and lovely to soak up 'other' flavors with just don't come with any flavor of their own.  

Now to the Bandeja Paisa.  They should just call this a sh*t load of meat platter lol.  Cuz wow.  Came with sausage, steak (flank or skirt), chicharron, yellow plantain, arepa, rice and kidney beans (on the side), and an egg.  Now I don't know about you but when I open a food container and see a rice with an egg on top I'm pretty much thinking SUCCESS!  LOL.  So similar feeling when I saw the Bandeja Paisa.  In pieces:

Rice - perfect (no flavor but none needed as it had beans and an egg)

Sausage - started out feeling weird about it because the texture is weird it has meat chunks in it vs. ground stuff but it's SOOO flavorful and soon became my favorite part of the dish.

Beans - They were OK.  Our beans (Puerto Rican) have a lot of flavor and these were a little bland but not bad.

Steak - thin and a bit dry - could have used more flavor again but not bad at all.

Egg - over easy.  

Yellow plantain - sweet and delicious - hard to mess this up

Chicarron - same as it was in the appetizer plate

Arepa - same

Overall I enjoyed it - felt stuffed and enjoyed the new food experience.  Service was fine - I called the order in to go and the guy behind the counter was pleasant enough.  On a side note - God help you if you speak Spanish from a different country other than Colombia because the girl that took my order over the phone spoke at mach speed.  LOL.  But no biggie.  

Was sad I forgot to order Flan.  I am ALWAYS disappointed in Flan I get outside of my grandmother's kitchen so I will order that up next time.

UPDATE:  I later came back and ordered CHEESE arepa and it was yummy so I give them another star now that I understand the whole arepa thing.",kWCkJR_xj2av_tS29q-QWA,4,4,4,da8ykaU6kgtw2zm-JuUSvg

2633130,2012-09-02,4,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"Must begin this review with full disclosure: it is owned and operated by one of my best friend's Dad & Uncle. Mom usually cooks. Even if I didn't know and love the family, I'd love this place. 

Very pleased to see that Yelpers agree with me, and have nailed the ""Mom & Pop"" storefront vibe. The fact that it turns into a great spot to salsa on weekend nights (till 5AM) is a bonus. Last night I had stopped for a nightcap @ Mario S.'s nearby bar & my friend Diana called to say ""come dancing!"" 

Food here is authentic Colombian, cooked to order and rich with depth of flavor, pride in culture and tradition: just downright feel good. They have fruit flavored shakes and sodas from Colombia. Other products adorn the front room (think smaller, Colombian Rocco's) 

Either version of the plantains are addictive (patacones, or platonos maduros) the Arepas are deliciously authentic, and empanadas (including vegetarian!) are amongst the best I've had. The Bunelos look like orancini but are filled with cheese, puffy balls of love I tell ya! Basic dishes from Arroz con pollo to Ensaladas de Frutas (fruit & cheese salad served in half a pineapple) and specialties from chicken, beef, fish and sides round out the something for everyone hearty fare. Portions are plentiful and prices are very reasonable. 

This is comfort food and it shows: soups include oxtail, tripe, hen and chicken, Pescado (fish) is on Friday (they have a special of the day @ 7.95 generous portions, usually include rice, salad, platanos or Arepas) Sandwich combos include fries and soda. 

Do you like tripe for breakfast? Done! Though I love the Huevos Pericos con Arepa (eggs w onion tomato & mozzarella stuffed arepa) or Desayuno Paisa: (eggs w onions, tomatoes, rice & beans w a mozz arepa = hangover food) There really is a choice for any craving here. Having traveled extensively throughout South & Latin America (and Puerto Rico, DR etc) I can see why folks gravitate toward this down home spot. Once you take your first bite...you are no longer in a Strip Mall @ Sahara & Decatur! 

I like to go for a late dinner on a Saturday & eat family style (UYE is coming) in the back room; walls are covered with paintings for sale by local artists. After a delicious meal, a beer or my favorite: Cristal = Colombian licorice liqueur (almost like a less syrupy Sambucca) the tables move to the side, the lights dim & Salsa rules the floor and the speakers. You can still sit at a table, order food and have water, soda or drinks, but I suggest you get up and dance the night away at one of the truly special hidden gems in town. 

You can check out the full menu online. If you happen to be in the area, stop in. Or, come to TBA UYE, places like this are few and far between and worthy of Yelp love.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,8,9,4,psbMwa20IeCPLcN0w9fZkw

The photos on the menu look amazing.  I wanted to try everything.  

There were a couple different kinds of arepas and they were decent, but none of them compared with really good arepas I've had outside of Vegas.  The empanadas were so-so.  They hard-sell you on their fresh juice - I got the tamarindo and it was pretty good.

But the dish did not taste as good as the picture looked.  Very bland and the cliantro wasn't fresh.  Also the yucca root was undercooked.  The plantains were decent.

Sorting my bookmarks to 'distance from me' Oiga, Mire, Vea resulted. They were open, I was hungry, they were close by. Pulling and pushing on the entrance door, it was locked - a little dark. Hours indicate they're open. So I peek into the window, seeing people inside, I pulled and pushed the door again until someone heard and saw... Right? That's the stubborn bag lady in me ppptthh.

I'm seated by a young girl, given a menu. She acknowledges me for it being my first time there. Then offers a beef empanada to start. I browse the menu and notice it's empty in the restaurant except a couple watching sports. 

Beef empanada is presented to me with a green onion sauce. I order arroz con pollo and a sprite. While waiting on my dinner I take the first bite of the beef empanada. Holy cow! Take another bite with the sauce... That's some tasty delicious combo cow! At this point the wheels in my mind are spinning and thinking why I don't have this kind of reaction to Filipino empanadas. Cuz THIS beef empanada tells me why. 

The beef empanadas are filled with meat, lightly wrapped, and has a perfect texture to the dough. It's not overly doughy nor oily. With the sauce is how they always serve it. Eating their beef empanadas came with a lesson. One of the owner's daughters told me about AJI. She told me the ingredients. It's one of those sauces I smother onto everything. The sauce recipe is Googlable.

My dinner plate came out after about 15 minutes. The yellow rice was really good. Here is another culture that serves plantains with a meal. Very nice flavor. It looked as good as it all was consumed. 

They're a homely people. Extremely pleasant to speak with. They introduced me to Bunuelos and Columbian soft drinks. I enjoyed this cuisine a lot. I must return to order more beef empanadas with aji. That will be the number one for me at this place. 

I recommend to try them. Especially for their lunch specials only $7.99 - their busiest time of the day. I'd totally go for it if they were only a couple blocks a way. However, the beef empanada won my attention with this dining experience.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,21,26,3,sGBWHrxCWKjrGmnETzjOuQ

Both my parents are Colombian and I first generation American, so that means I love food (American) and I know what Colombian food SHOULD taste like (Colombian Mom who is/was a GREAT cook). My background aside. REVIEW: This restaurant is easy to miss. It's just outside of view from Decatur and a short walk from Sahara. We took Bus # 204 from the Strip Monorail to make it to this place. Well worth it! The restaurants carries all the favorites. Tamales, Bandeja Paisa (Colombian Smorgissbord of Food), Authentic Soups, Arepas, Pony Malta Drinks (yum), Shakes, Pastries, you name it. They do an excellent job covering the spectrum of Colombian cuisine/treats to take home with you. Now, the restaurant isn't very pretty on the inside. As you come in, it looks like more of a Hispanic hole in the wall shop (Bodega) than anything else, adjacent to it is the dining room with overused tables/chairs you'd find at a cheap Party store, the wall decorations are thrown together and appear dirty... the bathroom is well...functional. We were served by the little old lady of the house...who was very kind and hospitible...She informed us they've been there 7 years and business was OK. I was saddened to see such things as Cuban Sandwiches/Dishes on the menu...because I guess the locals craved such things and they must be good sellers. I think they have no place on the menu, but that's only my opinion. The food: SPOT ON Colombian, delicious, rice perfectly cooked, arepa/cheese gooey, airey, and scrumptious, and Tamale, just plain authentic and tastey. The restaurant must not be in the best of times, because it must be taking corners on food prep, certain ingredients looked to be missing from certain dishes and a full drumstick was taking up space in the center of our tamale...instead of pulling the bone/fat/joints from it. Otherwise the meal was perfect. Service: Slow and Forgetful, but you loved her anyways. Recommend it: Definitely!

She found out about Oiga, Mire, Vea Columbian Cuisine via Urban Spoon. I looked it up on Yelp and was again, pleasantly surprised to see that Christie O., Christopher G., & Kevin P. were fans so I knew that this was going to be good. 

We were definitely noobs to the whole experience. When we walked in, I was not quite sure what was going on since we didn't notice the restaurant to our right hand side but only the shop in front of us. Our hostess/server told us to pick anywhere to sit and asked if we had been there before. She gave us time to look over the menu before taking our orders and even helped my friend learn how to pronounce ""Sobrebarriga."" Lol!

When the food came out, mm mm it was delicious! Especially topped off with the.. sauce? That she gave us before we even ordered.

We were served family style and we enjoyed the following:

Empanadas with Chimichurri-Crisp, Flavorful, and a great start to our Columbian feast.

Chicken Skewers with Rice, Beans and Sweet Plantains-Love the combination of sweet and salty, so the beans and plantains complimented the juicy chicken and addicting arroz!

The Picada is seriously a Carniwhore's heaven! a plate filled with veggies, Tostones(fried green plantains) Beef, Chicharrones, an interesting vinegary tasting Columbian style sausage, and a blood sausage which had a similar taste to Filipino Dinuguan with rice and stuffed in a sausage casing. 

I personally prefer the Colombian Style Arepa to the more familiar Venezuelan arepa that Viva Las Arepas serves. OMV serves it in a griddled corn cake(your choice of yellow or white corn topped with a generous piece of queso fresco. this again is a nice combo of salty and sweet. YUM!

After a some Pastel de Guayaba, we enjoyed Tres Leches and enjoyed the club like atmosphere at the same time as our dinner which made it kinda difficult to communicate with others in our party, but nonetheless fun and festive. Salsa dancing and the Karaoke stylings of Henry Churches with his rendition of ""Bailamos"" and ""Hero""
had the crowd hootin' and hollerin'!(If you're still having a brain fart on who Henry Churches is...en espanol= Enrique Iglesias). Big mahalo to Christie, and we'll most definitely be back...ALOHA!!!",3nDUQBjKyVor5wV0reJChg,7,6,4,W5P9OQ4-x_d50EAHuLFWmQ

3698181,2012-10-16,2,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"Seriously, I have a new found love for Colombian food, and I owe that to Christie O! I was stuffed, satisfied, entertained, and blown away with the quality of the food. The best characteristic that makes it of great quality is that it is HOMEMADE and made from scratch. There's nothing like eating your friend's mom's homemade cooking.

The empanadas? AMAZING! Sad to say that I actually like these empanadas than my country's empanadas. The crust was crunchy and soft, but not too thick where it dries your mouth and over powers the stuffing inside. PERF! It was made with a mixture of meat and potatoes. It wasn't super filling. Oh..you just had to be there.

Next dish was the chicken skewers with a side of beans and rice. What's in the rice! It's flavored rice and it was so good. I wanted to eat more of it, but I just didn't want to get sucked into the asian stereotype of hoarding rice (...ehem). The chicken was so tender and well marinated.

My favorite though was the arepa con queso (I think that's the one)...it's this tortilla topped with this nice sweet creamy cheese! It was so good, and fattening for sure, but I wanted so much more it. That will surely be one of my motivations to come back. 

Second motivation, is the Picada. It's like a big plated feast for royalty! It has this DELICIOUSLY flavored grilled steak, pork rinds, sausage, this blood sausage (which everyone was raving about!), potatoes, and these awesome fried green plantains I kept picking off. Oh it was so good and the helping is good to feed a family of four!

Third motivation is the entertainment. Karaoke? Oh yes they do! Some Colombians sure have vocal chords built for the gods! They also have this cute little salsa session where you can bust out your DWTS moves on the floor. Get your ball change on! If I had the choreographic skills to keep up with the pros I probably would have busted a move on the dance floor for much longer. 

Thanks so much Christie O for introducing to us this amazing place! the owners are SO SWEET and HOSPITABLE! It was as if we were their guests in their home! I felt super welcomed! Also, I do recommend to try their Apple soda. DELISH!!!",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,2,2,4,M4nkbzcm4WBVMJVmUYK0sw

When we first walk in you see just a small area, you know.. like your first college dorm room but to the right you see a doorway that leads to huge room with small tables and many chairs.  We met with the owner and our host/server for the evening.  Apparently, every other Sunday they have Salsa dancing.  We came on a night when they had this event.

Salsa Sunday's pro: Great entertainment.  
Salsa Sunday's con: Beyond loud music, louder than most clubs where you can't have any kind of conversation or little chit chat.

We were told to put the menus away.  We were first treated to our own empanadas, it was so delicious.  We had some herb sauce to accompany the empanada.  Our server then brought out a sampler of appetizers (chicaron was deliciouis).  Some I've tried before, some I've never had ever.  Then she brought out their three main dishes and set one set on the table and we were able to cut and split it amongst ourselves so we can sample their three main chicken/fish/beef dish.  After our main courses she brought out our dessert.  I've never had them before.  Our drinks were strawberry soda and a cola tasting soda.  I would definitely get something other than their tap water.  

If they would tone down their music during dance breaks that would have been more than satisfying for me.  But the entertainment value (you can even get up there if you know dance) was worth it.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,4,2,4,rrGvFXI1kSnowUq3YmDA8g

We were at a lost on where to have a late lunch, until I remembered this place (thanks to Kevin P and Nelson Q for writing those amazing reviews, which is what made me bookmark this place.

It was easy to find, located in an eclectic strip mall far away from the main part of LV where there is plenty of parking! Walking into this family owned restaurant we were greeted with a friendly Hola! I was not expecting this as I stumbled over my own Spanish and answered her in a half hola/hello (insert embarrassment).  She said we could sit anywhere, which we picked to sit in the larger dining room/dance area. In the dining area, it is on the dim side but with the large screen TV, we could see. 
The set up of their dining room/ dance area is hard to explain, I have seen it a couple of times when I would eat at Ecuadorian restaurants in LA.  Dark tables and dark chairs with high backs.  Artwork is hung on all the walls around the dining area. At one point, I kind of fell in love with the fat Jesus painting and wanted to take a photo. Mama was out in the dining room cleaning the table closest to the stage, at first I thought she was talking to someone else but then I realized she was speaking to me and in which again caught off guard I stammered and stuttered as she asked if I spoke en espanol. To which I said to her un poco. Ahhhh she said and walked away. 

Our waitress brought us our menus and some churriauce to use for later. I ordered an ice tea, which was kissed with lemon and a hint of sugar. Not too bad tasting!

After looking over the menu our waitress asked if we were ready to order, in which we said yes!

Appetizers:

-Empanadas-Turn-overs stuffed with meat and diced potatoes
-Chicharron- This is not your Mexican mama's chicharron that she would give you back in the days, instead this was more south america mama style which I kind of liked better- Each rind was crunchy and soft, squeeze some lime on it before you start eating it!

Each of these appetizers was single serving but just enough for two to share!

The MAIN EVENT-

Arepa with shredded meat- The meat has a lot of flavor and was not dry, but still I wanted to kick up the spice flavor and added some churriauce sauce and it brought out the taste even more!

Everything was delicious and the service was wonderful too, we left feeling full and happy! Will we be back? Por supuesto que para más sabrosa comida!",coKnuxLznH0FHb34m4ZLCw,5,5,5,aQHJei1o0qQ8KtLpMNYfMg

4484716,2013-12-23,3,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"At first we didn't see the big doors leading to the real dining room.  Just the 5 little tables and a lot of ""stuff,"" making it look like more of a convenience store than a restaurant.  On a weekday night, on the late-ish side, the only signs of life were the owner eating soup at one of the tables, and a young waitress newly arrived from Colombia, hesitantly speaking English.  No prob for me, since I speak Spanish.

I was a little dismayed to think that this ""atmosphere,"" or lack thereof, would be the stage for our first venture at this restaurant, but then I heard noise and noticed those doors.  The waitress explained that there was a meeting taking place in there, and so it was off-limits.

The owner came over and gave us a thorough explanation of the menu, making suggestions, too.  We took most of them:  a couple of empanadas and an arepa de choclo to start (choclo is the word for corn in So. America), a meal-in-a-bowl soup and an Arroz con Pollo entree to share.  Right after we ordered, the small ragtag group - some biker types, some jocks - holding the meeting in the dining room adjourned, and we were able to move into the very big and much more pleasant room.  I wondered what was so secret about that meeting that it had to be kept private???  They couldn't have taken up more than a table or two.  

The empanadas were astoundingly good.  The arepa was a little too sweet for my taste; I don't know whether the corn was just naturally sweet or whether sugar is added to the dough.  It was topped with a mass of mozzarella cheese that was probably heated a bit too long - each bite was squeaking when I chewed it.

The soup was simply fantastic, a large bowl of tasty chicken broth that was not overly salty.  We chose the one that had shredded chicken, since we're too damned lazy to deal with chicken on the bone.  This one also came with potatoes instead of rice, which was perfect, since we were having Arroz con Pollo.  And therein lies the problem:  that dish was ghastly.  Both the chicken and the rice were completely dried out.  I threw some of the parsley condiment over it to moisten it, but it didn't really help.  Normally we're not shy about complaining or returning a dish that isn't up to snuff, but this time I was too full from the soup and appetizers to start in with the wait for another dish.  So when the waitress passed by and asked about our food, I told her about the dried-out dish.  She asked if we wanted to change it for something else, and we declined the offer.

But here's the kicker, and the one thing that has really soured me about this place:  I was already outside when my husband went to the register to pay the bill, and he mentioned to the owner about the dried-out rice and chicken.  The response:  ""Well, rice dishes are always dry.""  Really?  Tell that to Mr. Risotto.  And that was the sum total of the answer.  No apology, and no acknowledgement that maybe that pot of chicken and rice had been reheated a few times too many. 

Any restaurant can have problems with any dish.  I've gone back over and over to restaurants at which we had problems, mainly because the owners were genuinely concerned about the quality of the food and desire for the customer to have a positive dining experience.  On the other hand, why should I return to a place where the reaction to a critique is a shrug, even if there are enough good things on the menu to warrant a second visit?  Karma kounts, in my book.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,5,0,2,_Ix1zEfRH8tQTsK00xcKlQ

4620523,2010-10-12,1,bXvr9e0_TQ83RI3nZwDdsg,"Talk about an interesting spot. It was my cousin's birthday and she loves salsa dancing, so we found this place late on a Saturday night. Walking up to the entrance, it was a little confusing. We were looking for a dance club and it looks like a Mom & Pop sandwich shop. One of my cousins made the comment that it felt like a Speakeasy. He's right on. The entrance to the ""club"" part is through some doors to the side that are ""guarded"" by a guy in dark clothing. I put quotes around ""guarded"" because it's not like he was checking IDs or anything.

Anyway, the dance floor was fun. Most of us aren't much in the way of salsa dancers, but we all managed to have a good time. The only problem I had at the time was when the waitress came over for drink orders. I wanted something basic, like a gin and tonic, but she didn't understand what I was asking for. I'm not dinging them for that; I'm just mentioning it. We ended up just getting Sprites and strange coconut-flavored sodas. I wouldn't mind trying some sort of Colombian alchoholic beverage.

A 'bandeja paisa' in the land of 'Disnefied' strip restaurants and where locals assume all Latin American food is represented by the great, but numerous Mexican restaurants here.  

I had to check it out.

Oiga, Mire, Vea is located in the S. Sahara Pavillion on S. Decatur and W. Sahara.  It's not pretty, but the people at the counter greet you with a smile and engaging conversation.  The entrance leads you to a small bakery/seating area filled with flyers and Colombian merchandise.  Off to the side is an opening to the larger room, where live bands and dancing take place on the weekends.  It's tight, old and messy with local business advertising their wares on a table jam packed with business cards and posters.

I was ordering takeout and will continue to do so.  Not very inviting to sit down.

The food.  Having been deprived of my beloved Colombian food for too long, I placed quite a large order:

-Empanadas (overstuffed mini cornmeal meat and potato pies)
-Chicharron with arepa (pronounced 'chee-chah-rrohn' - don't forget to roll your 'r's. (fried pork rind with white cornmeal cake)
-and the mother of Colombian plates, the Bandeja Paisa ('ban-deh-ha pie-sah).  A huge platter (enough for 2) of grilled steak (thin, but tasty), chicarron, red kidney beans, white rice, chorizo (choh-ree-zoh), fried ripe plaintain and a fried egg.
