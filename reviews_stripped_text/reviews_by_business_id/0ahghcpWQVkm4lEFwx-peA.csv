The food is comparable to what you would get in LA or Orange County and the atmosphere was delightful.

Like I said earlier, the food is comparable to what you would get in LA or Orange County, but I believe the food is  a little better in California.

My son is only tow years old, and ordering a whole meal would have been a waste. So, I politely asked if I could have an extra plate. Waiter was fast to add that he charges $5 for sharing a plate.

Enough mushy shit now lets  get down to business..

I ordered the chellokebob koobideh (grinded filet mingion) That was executed to perfection!! Juicy and succulent and tender oh man no exaggeration this was thee best Iranian food I had in awhile (excluding home meals)

The wife got chicken kebob and again executed to perfection..  Juicy and tender I was trying not to eat her portion too lol.

Would've been a 5 star rating if it wasn't for the slow service.. But when the waiter did show up he was a cool professional guy..

1244534,2012-03-13,3,0ahghcpWQVkm4lEFwx-peA,"I had heard some things about the owner (Habib) saying that he was a rude person etc etc. During the time I lived in Las Vegas I dined there 2 or 3 times and didn't experience anything too bad BUT during my last visit during a trip to Las Vegas I had an experience with the owner that makes me doubt that I will ever be going back again. I had always heard that the owner was rude and finally saw it with my own eyes.

Habib was taking our order. My mother asked if the fish was fresh and Habib said yes. My father asked again in the most polite words and soft spoken, friendly, respectful tone of voice if the fish was fresh or fresh frozen (my dad eats a lot of fish!)? Habib SNAPPED back in a rude, confrontational and aggressive tone of voice and said ""I already answered you once! I do not need your business!"" I was frankly shocked. This was after my father had earlier paid him a compliment on his restaurant when we first got there. Frankly it ruined our mood, our meal and whole evening. My mother at this point preferred to leave but we were already there, settled in, tired from travel and we stayed and ate our food.

The persian food here is reasonably good. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing. The prices are high for what is offered though. There are other places in town with better persian food (see reviews for Royal Persis and form your own opinion) but the physical location etc is not quite as nice, although my limited interactions with the owner there have been pretty pleasant. The inside of Habib's is more upscale, say, if you wanted to bring a guest from out of town, but frankly with an owner that can pop off at any moment does it really matter? He can ruin any physical attributes the restaurant has with a few words.

The other wait staff were pretty friendly. I think they may know that the owner acts the way he does and may try to make up for it (or are just trying to avoid pissing him off themselves).",uAiImgXphvsTP-xWlNgbaA,7,1,1,A3cfboT9eQSoEt4UKd7jrA

I have no idea what they were doing but messing with TV. Guys, this kind of stuff needs to be done during closed hours. 

The hostess was sitting down having tea and on her cell phone while the other guy was running around as fast as he could. She told us to sit anywhere we want, then the other guy said sorry this side was closed.
The hostess didn't bring us menus or give us a set up. Just an empty table.

 The manager or owner was clearly late to work and played it off like everything was under control when he got there.  The phone ring tone is for a house, not a restaurant. It was going off like crazy. very annoying.

 I ordered the chicken - which didn't have any saffron on there, actually the marinate was disgusting. The koobideh didn't have the right amount of onion in it. it was essentially hamburger meat. There was two items that I did like - one was the tahdig (which was not on the menu), the other was the bread and butter (complimentary)

The decor is very nice, and elegant do kudos on them for that. My husband ordered the sultani and I ordered the Fesenjoon. We also ordered the kashke bedemjan as an appetizer and Doogh ( yogurt soda drink) to drink. Ok... well the Kabob Koobideh portion of the sultani was dry, the sultani was dry, so as far as kabob here, neither of us were fans. The kashke bademjan literally tasted OLD. Im talking like, it was sitting in the fridge prepared for three days just waiting for someone to order it..... that was a big disappointment. The doogh wad very bland, and I needed to add more salt to it to make it drinkable. The fesenjoon however was VERY good, even though it did not taste like traditional fesenjoon, it was excellent.... so based on the fesenjoon and the decor im giving them 3 stars, and also the owner was not there that day... he was on a trip out to California apprently, but the gentleman who was managing the restaurant that day was very nice.",RL9D51_-fD3DsUgGtqWUBg,0,0,3,nLL9KNo6FXVYuAoqwFsnbw

Initially I had called to ask if they had a certain drink and appetizer that is not found in all restaurants the gentleman who answered the phone was very polite and explained they did have it. I speak farsi as I am 100% Iranian and the man spoke to me with respect.

When arriving i realized I was a little under-dressed as I did not know how formal the setting was however there was maybe 1 party other than ourselves there so I felt a little more at ease. The server came by and I wish i remembered her name but have forgotten now. She was sweet and sincere.   

The gentleman that was on the phone approached our table and said did you put drink orders in and I explained I was the lady on the phone. He looked at me up and down and said you are welcome- as I did not say thank you. He took my order for appetizers and the sweet kind server came and took our meal orders. 

The order HE placed in never came to the table and i had to ask the server where it was and she explained he never put it in. 

The food was ok, I got an authentic dish and it tasted bland and lacked flavor and the rest of my party ordered beef koobedeh which was dry. 

Afterwards i went to the grocery store/market in the back. I was walking around and there was no one there to assist me. This kind lady came in and even though I speak farsi I do not read or write it. I had to ask her (a customer) if that was the jam I was looking for. The manager came in and started shouting the difference between the 2 which was not my question, mine was what kind of jam is it. He was hassling me and giving me a hard time to the point where the other customer stepped in and told him to stop being mean to me.

I am happy to agree that the food, years later, is still legitimately amazing. The bread basket has three different kinds of pita and other carby deliciousness, which all go perfectly with the HERBS & FETA appetizer ($7), plated with fresh mint, tarragon, basil, and vegetables. The KOOBIDEH and CHICKEN KABOB plates ($15/ea) both had heaps of heavenly rice and roasted tomatoes, plus tender and well-seasoned skewers. The chicken was some of the best I've had, juicy and flavorful throughout.

They have a variety of kabob plates and more traditional dishes like stews, but the prices are going to be steeper than you expect- average entrée is $20-30 but again, the quality is top notch. 

The service also deserves a shout out, as the staff are exceedingly professional. Interior is much classier than the location and exterior might suggest. Heavy carved wood chairs, white linen table clothes, fresh flowers on each table. Your date may even get a long-stemmed rose with the check!

So as far as Persian and middle eastern restaurants in las Vegas are concerned Habibs is a must go and try.,Z_Wg1YxaxFnqMPydhFJ8xA,3,0,5,ATVZac9TYJonM6ChMPrOtA

The decor was very traditional and atmosphere was vibrant. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken kabob over long rice. The koobideh kabob tasted a bit gamey for my taste. The chicken and koobideh rice platter was on the pricier side, $20 to be exact. The service was good just very very slow. It seemed as if the host was the only one working on the floor on the night that I came. He greeted, seated, took our drink and entree orders, brought out the food, refilled our waters, brought us our check and to-go boxes. Maybe because it was a Tuesday night and they figured it wouldn't be a busy one that they didn't need anyone else working on the floor? Aside from the slow service, they get an A+ for making their female patrons feel loved and appreciated at the end of their meal. Every woman is offered a long stem rose to take home with them. I've never experienced this at a restaurant before so I thought this was a brilliant idea.

I have never been to Iran, would love to, so I can't say that I'm an expert in Persian food.....however, I have eaten at Persian restaurants in NYC that have floored me with their flavors and interesting recipes.  It also may have been what I ordered since it was roasted chicken with a mild flavor.  However, if you like the typical assortment of shish kabobs, I'm sure you might be satisfied.  I tend to draw more toward ""stuffed"" anythings....casseroles and stews so maybe I'm not being fair because I didn't see much of a selection on the menu.

After that we ordered Tahdig which is a very common appetizer for Persian restaurants and usually runs about $8-$12 max. He charged $10 for the rice, and $12 for two stews (not a full serving just about a cup) so $34 for an appetizer, SUPER SHADY. 
The food was ok at best but there was definitely no salt added to anything which led it to be not that great. The owner's disposition did not change throughout the entire experience and I would NEVER go there or recommend it to anyone.",LDBCJDxy_kWgOlmHTMmoPA,8,0,1,DI7IaHd8MZxvjfo9DUzK9g

We had a waiter and the owner both taking care of us (the place was empty at 6pm on Friday).  I can see why people don't like the owner - he has a VERY dry sense of humor.  Personally, I found him really funny and he treated us well even though we tried his patience by asking the same questions over and over (menu is a little confusing and if you don't pay attention you'll forget which item you thought you wanted). 

The waiter didn't do much more than bring drinks and bread but he was very well trained and very attentive to our needs.

I was worried at first the food would be overpriced from how rich the place looked, but the prices are very reasonable after experiencing the amazing dishes!! I am from California and have been away from authentic Persian food for a while since being away from my family, and this place brought me back to home. 

We ordered the dolmeh as our appetizer, which had just the right amount of sweetness and excellent flavoring. I had my doogh on the side of my Barg kabob, which was the best I have ever had! It was delicious and perfectly cooked - I highly recommend this dish! My boyfriend ordered the chicken kabob which was also to die for. 

We ended our dinner off with chai (hot black tea) and sugar and were treated marvelously by the waiting staff and Habib himself. 

Another plus of this place is that they have a small little market on the other side of the restaurant where you can purchase Persian foods and products that are difficult to find anywhere else. 

I am so happy to have found this place and will definitely be coming back again in the near future. Nush-e-jan!!!! :)",C7pIYlCMPOH1iDuPZt10oA,0,0,5,YZ5fjLUPByNLXyF-isLH4A

The food is bad, the service is horrible, the dishes are dirty, the owner is out of it. So here is the detail of my experience:
We got there around 5:00PM, got seated. There were only 3 other tables with customers. The menu is like Denys with pictures, only the picture are really bad quality and they are laminated. The prices were written on them with a marker and some of them were gone!!!!!!! 
So finally our waiter comes and we asked few question, well he was not Persian, therefore he did not understand any of our question (which were asked in plain English!!!!) and just mumble something. 
Finally, we were able to order something. After a long time the orders came. They were all cold and not the way we wanted them. But there was no waiter to point it out. So we decided to eat. Oh I forgot their glasses were really dirty we gave them back to the boss boy!!! 
While we were eating we notice the owner walking around. So then in front of every one he calls one of the wait staff loudly and tell her very loud in front of all of the customers why she has not refill someones water??!!!! Well all the customers were not comfortable with this situation. In what world would you do that to your employee in front of people who are eating. 
Anyway, after partially eating the food. The waiter finally came to ask if we would like desert, we said yes we want Baklava and Tea. 
He goes and some one else comes back with only the TEAS. No baklava. The waiter again is no were to be found. So we drank the cold teas, and asked for the check. We get the check and saw that we were charged for the baklava that we never got. So we asked for the waiter he came by after a while and we point that out to him. His response with rude tone was:"" Well I ordered it, are you sure you did not eat it1??""!!!!!!!!!!!! Gosh, I said you have not boss the table do you see a dish!!??? He took the bill and brought it back with no apologies and left. 
So we left no tips, and we left. 
Again, the food is not worth a penny, the service is horrible and who wants to see employees and owners discussion while they are eating!!

The little market next door has great persian items. I was so excited to find candied almonds! My favorite. We had the boorani (eggplant with yogurt sauce), which was excellent. Also we had the special stews. The sabzi with filet, kidney beans, and sabzi (spinach) was very good. The real winner was the chicken with pomegrante sauce though. It was absolutely amazing! The nan was generic. But that chicken was just so good I would go back to vegas just to have that stuff. The service was great and the atmosphere was nice, a little fancy, but you don't need to dress up.

He would yell, verbally abuse, and humiliate both the customers and employees on a daily basis. When I was first hired on, he payed far below minimum wage and under the table. He liked to call it a 'salary'. The food I saw the owner and the chef cook was horrific. The meat kabobs greasy, and soups were frozen, never fresh. The yogurt drink was expired as well as many of the market items he had next to the restaurant. He simply took the items and added a further expiration date. He took my tips and said I had to earn them by working there longer.

Food:  3.5 stars. I thought the food was not bad. It was pretty good. I loved the eggplant appetizer that we ordered. Although it's only 3 strips of eggplant, the sauce it was covered in was so good.

When I was in Vegas in December, my dad and I saw an ad in the yellow pages in our hotel for Habib's.  Being Persian and constantly craving Persian food, I asked my dad (who is from Iran) to go with me.

We came here for lunch, and ordered entirely too much food.  We started off with must o'khiar to dip the bread in, and it was fantastic.  I ate too much bread though, which is probably why I left here feeling so painfully full.  We also each got doogh (a yogurt drink) which is carbonated - again, probably contributed to the fullness.  He got kabobs of some sort (I can't remember what kind), while I ordered koresht fesenjan (chicken in a pomegranate and walnut sauce).  It was absolutely delicious, and I was sad that I was too full to finish it.  So I got the rest of it to go and gave it to my dad, since he was flying out that day and could eat some while at the airport.  The total bill was $48, which was quite expensive for lunch for two, but like I said, we ordered way too much food, considering it was lunchtime.  But the quality of the food was fantastic, and Habib came over and talked to us quite a bit and made sure everything was to our liking.  There were quite a few people that came in who you could tell were regulars - they were greeted like they were old friends.

5177154,2017-04-14,1,0ahghcpWQVkm4lEFwx-peA,"This is the best Persian food restaurant in Vegas. Of course it might also be - the only Persian food restaurant in town but that doesn't diminish its appeal in my eyes. 

Habib - I assume that's who it is, runs his restaurant with an iron fist and from the moment you enter and he greets you, it's apparent that he's in charge - right down to his letting you know that they will be closing at a certain hour  (implying of course that if you can't time yourself accordingly that he doesn't even want your business).  No matter - I've dined here many times over the years and Habib (or whatever his name is) is a sweetheart under that gruff exterior and goes to pains to serve his clients with gourmet food. 

At most Persian restaurants I recommend the chicken barg which is a flattened tenderized boneless chicken but Habib doesn't offer chicken barg, so we went for the chicken kabob, which is a similar boneless chicken dish on rice, and one lamb shank with dill rice dish.

We asked for and received as an appetizer, Tadig - the crispy rice from the bottom of the rice pot that isn't usually on the menu at a Persian restaurant and is served only when available and even then - only after the server has sized you up and deemed you ""worthy"" of the unknown-to-outsiders delicacy.  Habib brought us an eggplant side dish to scoop on the Tadig (Geymeh Bodamjon) which is odd actually, because it's usually the meat based Geymeh that goes on the Tadig and not the eggplant variety. 

We also had panir sabzi (cheese and dark greens) to substitute for salad. 

The corking charge for your own bottle of wine is $15.

Honestly, his Geymeh Bodamjon was lacking - in salt, and wasn't the greatest.  But the chicken kabobs and rice were all first rate, as was the house doogh (yoghurt and mint based drink, nice LARGE glass).  This is pretty much the way of all Persian restaurants, unfortunately - inconsistency, that one visit the chicken or rice will be off the chart good and then on another occasion something else will be perfect and the chicken or rice lacking.  But over all - Habib's is worth visiting and a splendid break from the casino restaurants. Would recommend. 

And at the end of the night - his gruff exterior faded as Habib presented our female guests each with a rose, and a smile.",VzdF-Eqnp3FpKb8cYWeTSw,0,0,4,QBkajIIsJHgbwRegtg_W4w

The owner, Mr. Habib, had us seated next to the only occupied table in an empty restaurant and served our meals himself. The kebabs (with rice) weren't good at all and we didn't finish our dish, however the restaurant looks nice and neat.
Worst part - While eating our meals, the owner kept coming out talking to the two gentlemen sitting next to us in Farsi and in a psychotic like behavior - they sounded friends or knew each others. To our surprise, he was using very very bad words and dialog in Farsi in his conversation with them that totally shocked us. Specially when you are at a dinner table you don't want to hear words shi #...... and stuff like that. In an Iranian culture (almost any culture ), this is too rude and absolutely unacceptable, anyway he is a very rude man.

Please Note: On the top of the very expensive bills, there is a big % charge under TAX, this should include the "" tip "" as well. The "" % Tax "" is to fool us to add an additional $ for the tip !!

Have you paid attention to those names and locations giving this place 4 or 5 stars?  Either they are not much familiar with Persian foods or most of them live in Las Vegas !!",gsl6oCNxlUs6dxBrLpWjJA,3,0,1,bkvo-n7FGEySbYGXs31H3g

On monday July 27th we were a party of four that made the mistake of choosing Habib's to have a late lunch. The restaurant was not busy and to get to it we had to pass through a ""strange"" market stocking foodstuffs, housewares, giftware, collectibles etc. The store's dangerously overstocked shelves and crowded ailes were most probably non compliant with city safety codes. 
We ordered the following items:

Ghaimeh Stew :   was stale and watery.
Ghormeh Sabzi:  was stale and watery.
Lamb shank with rice: tough shank meat & low quality rice.
Chelo Kabob Barg: tough meat and low quality rice.
Chelo Kabob Koobideh: overcooked meat and low quality rice.
Shirazi Salad : VERY GOOD.
Doogh :  EXCELLENT.
Service: O.K.
THE BILL:  We were shocked at how high our check total was which included an 18% tip already added.",8qCYYs_L7hbxvAhIxV3mmw,1,1,2,KRGJcWdsnSd7iYgpY59-SA

5718303,2009-04-13,0,0ahghcpWQVkm4lEFwx-peA,"I have been to Habib's a couple of times and like the place.

The kebabs are up to snuff.  One basic place everyone will want to start out at when tasting Persian cuisine is the Koobideh.  If you're Persian you will know right away whether the rest of the menu items will be good and if a follow on visit is needed.  If you are American (and are meat eater like me) it's a safe dish to go with.  I can tell you the Koobideh at Habib's is very good.  The Basmati rice served at this place is also perfect.  

Don't forget the Maast-o Khiar either.  It's another standard to tell you not only how they prepare the food, but also how they hold the items prepared for the day.  A good Maast-o Khiar like the one served at Habib's is always a pleasure.

The Ghormeh Sabzi served was also good.  I would have preferred some lamb in the stew as well.  But a vegetarian Ghormeh Sabzi is always delicious stew.  For you dyed in the wool American out give this dish a chance.  It may look super dark green like overcooked spinach, but the flavor is definitely tasty and nothing like spinach.   

For those reading this review I am not Persian.  But I did fall in love with the food and now cook a wide range of Persian meals often at home.  Habib is not a strictly Persian place as evidenced by having hummus on the menu.  Some of the dishes are a little Americanized to bridge the gap.  But I would say this a decent place to start your love affair with Persian cooking.

Though it's not on the menu you should ask for a serving of Tadig to go along with the stews.  This portion of the basmati rice preparation is a great compliment to the stew. 

As it's been mentioned Habib's interior does have a few failing points.  And the location itself can be easy to miss when tying to find it.  But remember that you came for the food and enjoy yourself.",yR731OlfuI4585U4_HhHlg,1,0,4,TDPegA0wgWvjuV7FSvjuLQ

The waitress brought us two menus- one with text and the other with pictures of some of the dishes. There was a list of ""specials"" that all had Persian names... And none of them had English descriptions. So I asked the waitress what these were and she doesn't know. So she goes and gets a guy from the back who proceeds to read the names of the dishes to me but doesn't say anything about what the dishes actually are. I ended up googling the dishes in front of him in order to decide what to get. We arrived at 12 pm and the place was empty the whole time... And we didn't leave until 1:30! It took that long to prepare two plates of food for two people. We had to keep signaling the waitress to bring us pita bread because she only brought two or three pieces each time. We asked for a hot sauce, she brought a bottle of Tabasco and put it on the table. The final bill before tip was $56.

The beef lole kabob was too old and the color was black , no spice, it was blend. The barg kabob was uncooked and tasteless. The only good thing was the decoration, which is not part of the menu lol. My worst nightmare was the owner, Habib, he was rude, dirty, and unpredictable. He was kind of crazy, was talking to himself loud. and repeating Mochakeram to himself. He was asking how is the food before he serve the food.  He was getting the order, bringing the food and check. His waiter and waitress, seemed were intimidated by him. they were not allowed to take tips. and He was charging service charge which will go to his own pocket or his credit card. In general , I will never recommend this place to anybody. Doesn't worth the food and specially facing an angry, rude, unprofessional person like Habib.

5792119,2012-01-05,0,0ahghcpWQVkm4lEFwx-peA,"I am giving Habib's a 3/5. Overall, the new location is bigger and better than the old place. The decoration is still one of the best I have seen for a Persian restaurant. You will definitely enjoy your time there if you're a little bit open minded.
I'm giving a:
Atmosphere 4.5/5: As I said earlier, it's definitely one of the best atmosphere I've seen for a Persian restaurant. I'm not giving a 5 because I think that the owner could have included more of the Persian art into their decor but it still looks really good now.
Food 3/5: I read all the Yelps review and yes the food isn't maybe the one your grandma will cook but I think it was some descent food. I didn't have the feeling to eat something bad. I definitely ate worst than this! But as a key note, I usually always order a side of Hummus everywhere I go because I can tell first, if the Hummus is fresh made or in a can, and second, it gives me a good feeling of how things turn in the kitchen. Well at Habib's, they unfortunately use Hummus from a can which is ok for certain people, but not for me. A simple appetizer like that should be freshly done and it gives you a nice overview of the rest of the food. That's one of the reason I am not giving a 4 or 5 because I think they can still improve in their food presentation and preparation.
Service 2/5: Service tends to be sporadic I agree. It really depends if you know the owner, if he had a good day or not etc. at the same time, it's rare to have also exceptional service in a Persian restaurant. It's pretty much in the culture.
Overall, a 3/5. I would still go there and I like to support them. It might be a little overpriced maybe depending on what you're ordering and you can end up with a bill of $70-$80 for 2 persons.",L4S915BUVypnswOLWUWlYw,2,0,3,keXYZG4zhPmNj5daGBugKg

Biggest issue:  The bill came and I noticed just about 30% added to the bill as ""tax"" ... yes, 30%!  When I asked the server about it, he said that that includes 18% as service fee and 8.1% as tax ... and that that is explained in the menu.  I have several issues with this:

1. Shame on me for not reading the menu and the fine print ... my mistake, but if you are reading this review, you don't have to make this mistake.

2. Why am I forced to leave an 18% tip?  The tip is not at my discretion.  If the server is not helpful, I can't express myself in any way.  

3. Why is listed as ""tax""?  I bet you most people do not even see it and add tip on top of it automatically!!!  That is stealing!

4. Now, it gets worse:  I asked the server that if there is an 18% service fee plus an 8.1% tax, that adds up to 26.1%.  So, why is there an almost 30% charge?  They add 8.1% to the bill and then they add 18% tip on top of it.  So, the effective percentage for tip is higher than 18%.

Food:  It was no special in any way.  I am very familiar with Persian food.  I have had it in many cities and many countries.  I look for Persian restaurants everywhere I go.  This restaurant is not bad but it is not good either.  The food in NO WAY justifies the prices they charge!  I had chicken with bones, and it was not cooked well.  For appetizer, we had tadig which the crispy rice that is cooked in the bottom of the pan, and we had it with two kinds of stew.  Tadig was good but not enough for 6 people.  Stews were OK, but again not special.

Service:  It was OK.  The server was not really pleasant: smiling or welcoming.  He was not rude or anything, but I felt like we were bothering him being there.  And the place was not busy.  The service in NO WAY justified more than 18% in tip.  But think about it the guy didn't care because he knew he will get his tip any way.  

I will not recommend this place:  not for food, not for service and not for being overcharged!",XUdQrMFDlpKbC6Zx6MPWxw,16,2,1,8l8QwxjWzBR6Jrp_Oj207g

Being of Persian descent, I know what this food is supposed to taste like. Just the right spices, fresh vegetables and not too much oil. 

One of my all time favorites is Ghorm? Sabzi. Its a Khoresht, which means a stew served over piping hot Basmati rice with a smidgen of Saffron.





Habibs Ghorme Sabzi is FANTASTIC. 
Fresh and aromatic I was impressed.
