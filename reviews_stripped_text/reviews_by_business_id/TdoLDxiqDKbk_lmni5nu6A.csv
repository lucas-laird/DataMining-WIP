Get the rolled taco combo. I always fear rolled tacos because they are so oily and over cooked creating a real hardness to the shell. These are crisp and tender at the same time. The meat is tender. Their refried beans are a bit salty and the dissapointment of the combo. 

I also tasted the cheese quesadilla. It was very large; the tortilla was the right thickness for an authentic tortilla. It came with very little guacamole and some thin sour cream. Both dishes came to $12.
