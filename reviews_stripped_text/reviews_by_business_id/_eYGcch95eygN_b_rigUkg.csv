Have given it good reviews to friends in the past so have to be fair... if this had been our first time here, we would never go back. They need to revamp their Deli. The produce section is good, but the deli people are rude. All except for the nice hispanic lady that worked the register. This happened on 9/29/16 at 11:30am. Wanted some hot wings. Bought some carnitas, and chicken, they said 10 minutes on the wings. We shopped, came back, and hot wings weren't done. The rude guy that was the one making the food items told the cashier 2 minutes. I asked him about it like 10 minutes later, and he says, ""the fryer was off. it will be a while."" This is all while he just finished deep frying some jalapenos and added them to the already massive stack. He should have took them out, put the wings in, knowing we were waiting when noone was waiting for the peppers.
I went and got a supervisor, she went over there and the guy tells her in Spanish that he told me 10 minutes and that there was nothing he could do as one fryer was broke. Well he lied to her obviously, good thing I speak enough spanish to know what he told her. 
I showed her the initial receipt that we had when we paid for the carnitas and the chicken...11:35am. then showed her the clock at that time... 12:25pm. 50 minutes and no wings!

2832755,2017-09-05,0,_eYGcch95eygN_b_rigUkg,"UPDATED 2/5/18:  BEST BAKERY SO FAR!
Well, I still love Cardenas, and last time I shopped there I tried a bakery item.  I picked a ""single serve"" square cut of cake from their bakery.  The first thing I noticed was the price was reasonable for the size of dessert I bought.  Secondly, the ingredient label?... ONLY listed things I have in my own kitchen - meaning, nothing I couldn't pronounce, no additives, no artificial anything, as if I did the baking myself.  I knew it was going to be fantastic before I even opened the clear plastic box it was in.  Of course, I had to ask for a plastic fork, this cake was not going to make it home without me trying at least one bite (and I only live a short distance from the store!).  
The first bite was awesome - fresh, creamy, and tasted just like I said, homemade.  Another two bites on the way home, just to be sure my feelings for this cake were honest and not because I hadn't eaten anything that day, and YES, it still tasted like Heaven.
Well, that ""single serve"" piece of cake lasted me a couple of days.  It was so large I couldn't eat it all in one sitting.  It was so good, I (really!) had dreams about eating it that night, and then again a few weeks later.  I swear, I've never dreamt about eating food in my dreams, that was just weird.  Point is, the bakery (which I had not tried yet if you noticed in my previous review) is awesome, and I highly recommend it for any special occasion, and for every day as well, if you prefer that homemade, natural, ""old school"" way of life without preservatives, additives, and artificial who-knows-what in your baked foods and desserts!  

The first time I went to Cardenas at this location, I was not very impressed.  I didn't buy anything; I was escorting someone there who was doing her shopping.  Unfortunately, I didn't take the time to look around at the things I discovered on my next visit...
The prices are very, very reasonable, especially in the meat department.  The meats and seafood appear to be very fresh, which is the most important thing I look for in choosing a grocery store.
The staff, from stocking to managerial, were all very kind and helpful.
There are a lot of Mexican food items that I haven't seen anywhere else, yet I also found all the brands I'm used to getting as well.
I haven't tried the bakery items yet but they smell so good, I can't wait to go again just for the sweet bread choices, sandwich rolls, etc.
Besides the meat department, the produce at Cardenas is outstanding.  I just bought a huge bag of cherries, which usually run at least $2.49 / pound, for 99 cents a pound, and believe me, they are very good - sweet and ripe.
I love Trader Joe's for produce but because of their vast selection and really great prices, my new favorite store for produce is Cardenas.",iAA4lycfsrwFucAnnPMQVw,0,0,5,Ft1U3gB-1JyoUwVLfyr1hg

I get my pre-marinated ranchera meat, al pastor, ceviche de pescado, fresh guacamole, fresh tortilla and even the homemade tortilla chips.  The vegetables are fresh and I grab all my ingredients to make my own fresh salsa for cheap.  

The place is clean, there are employees on-hand most of the time and the inventory is fully stocked.  With limited English with some of the employees, they do try their best with non-Spanish speaking customers.  
Come get your fix with the pan dulce, the agua fresca and all the goodies to satisfy the craving all in one spot.  

Though it's a bit far, I don't have much better options around the same area. La Bonita is pretty comparable to this place.",sAOdKC09kMqFfnVCrJRWvQ,4,4,4,T1LOOt53El5oJpXuhPNGFg

When I got here, the quality of their sales were poor. For example, their ad says 3 mangos for 99 cents, when I got in there, there was no matching sale sign and the mangoes were small and dark green. Their guacamole receta was not on sale for $4.97, but for $6.99. No one helped me inside and concluded that this was more of an upscale Winco.",g8OozJjZwliRYdAZOTILPw,0,0,3,70UD9jIraJsjDufD-gFnOA
