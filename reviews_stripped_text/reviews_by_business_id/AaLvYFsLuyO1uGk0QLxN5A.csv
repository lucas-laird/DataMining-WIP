We missed it my first time trying to find it, but after doing better research, found it on our 2nd day in Vegas. We came on a Sunday afternoon for lunch, and there were only 2 people in front of me, but it took a while to get my food (hubby went to try something else as he wasn't in the mood for hotdogs).   It started out as one person taking orders, making food, etc, so it took a while for me to actually get my food.  Hubby came back to order food from here too after browsing around, but I told him to go elsewhere b/c it was taking too long, and I'd already ordered. I got the dirty chilidog and dirty esquite (corn in a cup). The chili dog was amazing, and the bun was fantastic - crispy edges and perfectly buttered.  I had to save some for my husband to try since it was too good not to share.  The corn, absolutely delicious.....

We opted for the Red Dog, the Mutt Dog, the Dirty Chili Cheese Dog, elote corn in a cup and chili cheese fries. The highlights were the Red Dog and the elote. The Red Dog ended up being my favorite because it had the most flavor and it was super tomatoey and spicy. The Mutt Dog to me was a brighter 
-milder version of the Red. The Chili Cheese Dog was good but lacked flavor compared to the other two. As for the sides, the elote was clearly better than the chili cheese fries.

We came across this hot dog stand that looked great, so we stopped to look at the menu. We only tried one thing and it was the Elote dog. Delicious! A grilled all beef dog, wrapped in bacon topped with a citrus, mayo based sauce, grilled corn, cotija cheese, bits of chorizo and cilantro on a soft, lobster roll like bun, that had been crisped up on the sides with butter. It was so satisfying! It had all the elements, that balanced out every bite and was just enough for a snack to share. It is outdoors and it was freezing that day. You have to find a spot to eat, which is bummer but the bars allow you to eat inside... if you buy a drink. This isn't the easiest to thing to eat and you are going to want to scoop up every, single, delicious bite. The service was good.

My guest ordered the 'red dawg' and they asked/offered to make a combo for addt'l fee - which included fries and a beverage - Coke is a cold glass bottle (no fountain options available - so no cups with ice). They were told to take a seat and they're bring to table - they got theirs pretty quick - I ordered the 'dirty chili dawg' - and made mine a combo - asked what options besides Coke was told Gatorade so I had that (it was cold). I was too told to take a seat and food would be brought out. You have to pay on a tablet (no register) I was not provided option to give email for receipt (the young man doing the order taking didn't seem too interested in offering or was very personable for that matter )(was suprised on cc statement was charged about $15 for hot dog, fries & small bottle Gatorade). Anyways so my guest is about 1/2 way thru with their meal before I get my hot dog and they dont' bring the fries. I have to go back - try to get the guy's attention that took my order (he's in tunnel vision mode) to get my fries (read previous comments about the order taker) - had to wait close to 8 mins or so as they had to make a new batch (after getting attention of the lady that brought out my hot dog btw). The fries were very greasy and didnt' give good amount (since they were so greasy didn't mind). Anyways - I don't expect 5 star service at a place like this but it could have been better.

I knew it was going to be heavy and overwhelming, so I ended up throwing most of this away. It wasn't horrible though, but I would probably try something else next time.

Thankfully, the chili cheese dog wasn't too overwhelming. They use a buttered bread roll and it looks like it's a lobster roll basically, so that was really yummy.

it's a little on the pricy side , but i'm sure it's due to location.... then again, they are gourmet hot dogs. they have hot dogs with fries on top, corn, avocado(you know everyone's crazy about avocados) , limes & they even have a bacon wrapped dog !!! who doesn't love bacon.

Honestly after the several years I've known him, I've never seen him this happy before.

I went with the Elote Dog and shared half of it with another friend who ordered the Dirty Chili Dog. I loved the chili on her hot dog, but I'll have to say the Elote Dog is pretty unique.

Located at the Grand Bazaar shops out front of Bally's near the Las Vegas Strip. This place is a must try for tourists and locals. The bun is slightly toasted giving a unique flavor to the bread. The chili  is unreal and the cheese sauce drizzled with bacon bits and onion tastes amazing. Although there was not a whole lot of seating available the atmosphere surrounding the shops definitely draws you in. Glad I got a seat but if it were peak tourist season I could see many people wishing for a place to sit if you are in small groups you might have to share a table with strangers which is understandable and what I had to do. Taylor was very helpful and she knew the menu and made great suggestions pointing out several tasty items for a first time goer. Giving multiple options as a greeter is nice because it let me know ""You can't go wrong."" She made me feel excited to try something new which seems to come naturally to her she just has an inviting personality. I will definitely be back for more. I valeted at Bally's they charge $15 for the first 4 hours David and Jimmy were really nice at the Valet booth and Blue was my driver and he was very polite. I asked to tip the valet guys through the credit card payment option and the valet guys told me this was not possible unfortunately I did not have cash on me.

It was tasty! Had the elote dog. Worth trying.

More detailed version: 
$9 hot dog is pricey but it's gourmet I guess and on the strip, so the price reflects that. Bun was buttery and toasted, aka delicious. The elotes were flavorful and the dog as a whole was filling. I kind of viewed it as paying $9 for a premium hot dog with a side (the elotes) on top. 

My wait time wasn't bad at all, only had to wait 5 min (on a Monday early evening). People have mentioned the long wait, and I'd say if you see a long line might be worth revisiting at a more convenient time. 

Unclear why it's called Dirt Dog...

The good: 
It was cheap, fast, and convenient. Has some outdoor seating nearby, whether its specifically for Dirt Dog I'm not 100% sure. 
The Hot Dogs were plump and juicy, the buttered bread was cripsy on the outside and soft on the inside. I had the spicy option on day one then last night I had the number one with the peppers and onions. 
Both were excellent although i'll give the nod to the spicy dog. 
Didn't try anything but the two dogs. 

The ok: 
Communication between staff was good on Tuesday, Wednesday needed some work. When i went on Tuesday there was no line so ordering was easy, pickup was easy etc. Wednesday night was a little different as there was several orders in front of me and it seemed like the staff had no clue who ordered what even though you provided them your first name for the order. There were more people working as well which could've added to the confusion as it such a small space. 

All in all I had a great experience. It's making me hungry just thinking about it... I may go back a third time before my flight home. If I'm back next year for our annual conference I'll definitely make my way over to try another option.",CcXLBU79nKfH8djrzJ6fBg,1,0,4,rQnuOKbJPoK_GXGL1NeNFw

I ordered both the Elote and the House dog. I felt both were slightly odd flavor/texture choices. However, the bun was ""lobster roll"" style, which I guess just means it was buttered. This was quite decadent, in its savoriness. 

The hot dog is large and of high quality. It tastes of pure beef and fat. It holds a solid bite. 

The Elote dog is covered with corn, parmesan cheese, and some endless panoply of other toppings. 

My advice would be to stick to the most basic dog you can find here. The toppings just sort of distracted from the nice hot dog.",EOajY1L3ole3gLTCZ2xw1g,1,0,4,mVHbKA829u7LQUflDXzoQA

All the hotdogs get wrapped with bacon. Now I remind you we got these Hotdogs at night when this place was closing. Usually when it's later in the day or better yet your last orders you wouldn't expect things to taste all that fresh or good. But Kenny and his staff must love what they do. I honestly felt like the hotdog couldn't have been made any better. Kenny also was kind and generous and gave Kate and I dessert. This place wowed me, who knew you could make the hotdog this special. 

The House Dog: The hotdog is wrapped in bacon and has Thousand island and green chili spread. It's a heavy hotdog with tons of flavor. Honestly a little too much flavor for myself. It tastes good but was not my favorite from the ones I picked. 

The Dirty Dog: is every mans dream hotdog!! The classic chili cheese dog gourmet styled. I haven't tasted a good chili dog like that since I was a kid. This hotdog far exceeds the one I had as a kid to be honest. I wish I lived in Vegas just for this damn hotdog. 

The Patti Melt Dog: this hotdog came loaded with cheese and bacon and French fries. It also has an aioli spread that ties in perfect.   Katie said she wished she got one for the plane ride back home.

Slide over to Sin City next door and sit down to drink while Heather makes you a drink! You can eat your food there... Thank me later! Enjoy!",EiKacsolqKd6_SntAD5r2A,1,0,4,-2GREtq_-NDhBR-X7HdRZw

I waited about five minutes before the Cook told me the cashier would take my order shortly. Every order the cashier would open up the box and ask everyone did you order this (there was only about 4 customers) eventually my order came up (about 13 min) and he didnt even asked me, he just walk past to the other two customers and then into a restaurant eventually one of the employees standing outside had to go get him and tell him that it was my order. Not organized at all!!

Overall The House Dog is definitely better than their customer service. Very good snap on the dog lots of ingredients and all for under $4 dollars on the strip!!",8W4969tAJqsmzQVeCRnRZQ,4,1,3,ZKjgUHmPQwnEy1PxBmU8GA

The place is located right in front of Bally's near this little area with different food stalls and mini shops. It is kinda hidden in the back so look carefully! My family ordered the dirty dog, elote dog, and the  dirty corn on a  stick. All of them were heaven in each bite. So buttery and flavorful. Highly recommend.",gF8E2gC8JKXdF7tD8uYabw,0,0,5,to5zml6gV75nt-SGQdUgyA

The staff is incredible!! The place is clean and fun. I truly enjoyed my experience here and as I local will be returning! Thank you.",k_NXT8qEr-_ZWkS58mBUPA,0,1,5,Zp9Gz4inyFQYwDum1ok3Pg

Now to the food..AMAZING!! Best dogs I think I have ever had. Buns are amazing, skin on the dogs snap when you bit them, all the ingredients taste fresh and work well together. Fries are good here also.

Service is great, very patient and willing to explain what is what. Listen to their history..pretty cool. Cook was amazing to watch.",ftul9cQ-TO_fLCiAUeM7eQ,2,0,5,-N_IFhgJdFhiztSL6LYOpA
