The texture of the pulled pork was not bad, but it could have been more flavorful.  The waitress recommended we get the sweet potato fries because they were oh-so delicious and we shouldn't come to Buckingham's without having them.  OK, I was sold.  The ""sweet potato fries"" they serve has got to be one of the nastiest things on earth:  The texture was all wrong, almost like they cut and fried the sweet potato a week ago, let it sit around for a week, soak it in water to prevent it from drying out, then refried it when I ordered it.  It was served with a ""dipping sauce"" (the little black container in the picture) which tasted like they took pancake syrup and cinnamon, and reduced it to the consistency of snot.  Literally.  

I do give them props for serving actual barbecue, and not being one of those places that boil their meat.  But, I really don't think I would go back to Buckingham's.  Unless I felt like having lunch meat and snot, which doesn't happen very often.",E7sk9jsImePqLT4roNgotg,1,0,2,KcDZhHXHQmq_csMfWW1_Kw

I suspect they have changed hands at some point because the quality and portion size has drastically dropped. LIke Mona C. I had gotten the combo place once and everything on it was dry. Not just overcooked dry, but turkey jerky dry. I liked the Bruswick Stew, but I have no idea if it was good or not having never had it before. With chains like Famous Daves and Memphis around, I wanted to give the 'little guy' a chance, but they have really disappointed me. The food isn't terrible, but it's not good. If you do find yourself there, try the fried pickles, you'll feel like Elvis.",yvWZJA-h-UEC_Xf51eE0OQ,0,0,2,ajBdOzZ2l8BmFrapX471XQ

Being closest to my house Buckingham's made it 1st on my list.

This place is in a great location right next door to the movie theater.

As you enter you are greeted by a very friendly asian lady and a large dining area with boothes along the walls and western decor on the walls.

They have quite a deisplay of trophies & plaques touting their accomplishments & merits.

I ordered a pulled pork sandwich w/2 sides for $8- I also got horseradish cole slaw and mustard potato salad.

This place is for real. Great smoky taste, the pork was slightly crunchy but very moist & tender. The BBQ sauce was spicy with some real zip to it.

The cole slaw was the biggest surprise. Horseradish-very spicy but crunchy and delightful. The potato salad was incredible too.

I saw an order of ribs and they looked like some of the best I've seen. I will be back to give them a try.

For now I'm off to my next BBQ destination.........",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,7,7,4,0hiM7oypB-kwfTVPt0SdKw
