Twice now I've done the online ordering from this location (it's closest to my place) and every time I go in their to pick it up, and I'm usually 15 minutes late, they never have my order ready and act totally surprised when I get there. So I have to stand their and wait while they frantically make my order and receive death stares from the other guests waiting in line. Pretty aggravating.

I gave it 2 stars because my heart couldn't come to leave 1 star for a chipotle, since it's still an amazing restaurant (just not this location)",mLHZCvOoxazyUjGxWN7MwA,1,0,2,BCV95BJthprpgMwBBsVWUg

I once ordered online to pick up at this location, but I still had to wait to jump in and pay for my meal. In fact, when I online ordered, they hadn't even made it yet so they made my burrito quickly.

The food is yummy, like most Chipotles, and the price is reasonable for the amount of food that you get in return. I always take my burrito to go, but glancing at the rest of the restaurant and I see that it is usually clean though filled with people eating. The downside to this location is that it opens at 11 am (boo!) and there is always a line.

The good points are that the burrito's and burrito bowls are pretty good sized although half of it is usually rice.  The meats taste pretty good, the salsa is good and the prices are cheap.  I also think the place is usually pretty clean and the staff has been nice.  The negatives are simple, not enough main dish selections.  Pretty much a burrito, bowl, or tacos is about it.  Would be nice if they had other selections, like quesadillas, nachos etc.  I also don't understand why the staff has to pass you from one person to another like 4-5 times during the course of one order.  I have seen this situation cause some confusion with people's orders.  Why can't one person just follow me through the whole process and than maybe pass me to the register person?

Well the good are that they're convenient located between a Chevron and Outback Steakhouse in a large shopping center near the strip, they're fast at least at night when there hasn't been a lot of people during lunch it get busier but they manage, they're friendly they sometimes crack jokes, and they're huge in size. Sometimes, well most times, their burritos are so big that they struggle to close it up which are both good and bad because it spills out while you eat even with the foil wrapped around but it's fills you.  They're huge that after I eat the whole thing I ask myself why did I do that.  More of the bad are that the fillings are cold not warm or hot but cold.  It just kills the burrito for me when I'm eating it and bite after bite I get a cold piece of something here and there.  There is a solution for this though order the bowl and ask for additional tortillas.  You can heat up the ingredients in the bowl and wrap your burrito to manageable sizes.

I didn't take the chance of asking for more meat because I know there would be an upcharge. Even after salsa, cheese and lettuce, I was left with a burrito bowl fit for the size of a small toddler. Many of the other burritos I saw go though the line seemed under stuffed as well. The chips were chewy in a bag that was 10% filled and the guacamole tasted like lemons (which means it's old).

Ok, so I walk in and it's not too busy, like 3 people ahead of me. So the guy in front of me orders a bowl with no beans. So the employee gives him 2 scoops of rice instead without the customer asking for it. So when I go to order my steak bowl with no beans, the employee only gives me one scoop. Wtf? I just saw you pouring 2 scoops for the dude before me. Is it because I'm a small person? Anyway, I asked for more rice. He put the steak on and it was time for the veggie part. So off I move along the line to the female employee putting the salsa. I ask for salsa, corn, lettuce and a small amount of sour cream since I know they always put a huge dollop of it. When I go to pay, I ask the cashier for a side of guacamole and a side of sour cream as well. When the cashier asked the female employee for my sides, she looked at me and went ""ugh."" Jeez, I'm sorry I want sour cream on the side instead of all over my food. It's not like it's coming out of your check. Give me my damn sour cream and shut up and do your job.

I entered the premises, requested for two scoops of their chicken/brown rice and I was out with the quickness.  Roughly 10 oz of chicken for less than $10.

This location can get really busy since it's in the parking lot of the outlets, but the line moves steadily. I also like that you can order and even pay online to bypass the line to speed things up. The food quality and service quality are up to standard with the chain in general. The only negative for this location to me is the parking lot since it can get pretty crazy. Other than that it's a solid location with the food you'd expect.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,1,1,4,YK8G3FYbfyfn6lljn-0RSQ

The quality is generally consistent and they know how to get through a line quickly! This place fills up since it's so close to the outlet mall but because of that you know you're getting fresh food.  A lot of the time the chicken that's on the grill while you're in line is the chicken that goes into your bowl when its your turn to order.

Once we got through the line, the staff are warm and friendly and really go out of their way to make you what you ask for with some extra in it.  The food is good and the place even though busy seems to have a good crowd.

The service was pretty fast and the staff is very friendly with generous helpings in their burritos! The inside is pretty standard and spacious if you have the time or desire to seat down.

Cons: Nothing really wrong with the place but not ""as good as it gets"" per say.

We go to this Location  almost every Monday. There is a young gentleman named MAURICE. He is so professional and hospitable you""Chipotle"" should feel lucky he is on your team. Every trip is a pleasure to me and my wife and three children. Truly MAURICE is great and lifts the spurt of all the team members working with him. The burritos are always spot on due to the Burrito specialist that are awesome as well.

From the moment we walked in, Richard the manager, was communicating with us. While we took forever to decide our meal he kept engaged, he even kept up with the small talk as he was helping out his staff. 

My wife and I continued to be ""those customers"". After we had him start making burritos, we asked to both switch to salads and he didn't even blink an eye of frustration. So good. 

Then Paloma took care of my wife's very picky choices. And she had a gentle and sweet demeanor. 

Maurice checked out us and was diligent to help me out with information I asked for. 

If customer service was what they sold, they hooked us up! 

Oh yah, the food was really good and they gave us a lot. :) We ended up with steak salads.",i8wvDa8VMLkUwC3M0POYVw,0,0,5,sfGbcQ5bbTUmy3AAzZ3M8g

I'm honestly just SO sick and tired of being excited to get home and eat a burrito bowl that ends up being filled with more fat on chicken than actual chicken. Having to spit a bite into the garbage, sink or a napkin is literally beyond annoying and disappointing. After 10 years of eating chipotle, why am I STILL eating fatty chicken almost every single time I indulge? Also, why am I still eating there?
