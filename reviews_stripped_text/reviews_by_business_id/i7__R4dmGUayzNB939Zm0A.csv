Its not the best ramen, sushi, or Japanese place in town. But its still good and way cheaper for most items.  They're canton-ramen adds a Chinese flavor to the ramen with a hint of sesame oil and corn starch. Tako wasabi is straight up wasabi flavored octopus. Agedashi tofu is pretty good. The mapo tofu could use less starch but its still yummy. Sushi is on the menu, but with all the ayce places, its only if u want a quick fix. The Stir-fried Udon has delivered every time... I highly recommend.  Overall its a good place for the price and the variety of dishes from curry rice and noodles to grilled meats and much more.",HFOQy-DOugDxxrdvT4dP8Q,1,0,3,k9vnXi0UKszI5JqfsGWX_w
165811,2010-10-12,1,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"It had been a long while since I last ate at this place. On a previous visit, I recall trying their Japanese katsu curry and shoyu ramen. Both were decidedly mediocre, which would explain my long absence. However, my wife had read some promising reviews about Shuseki and was particularly interested in trying their takoyaki and tonkotsu ramen, so off we went. 

Our order consisted of kakuni don, okonomiyaki, takoyaki, and tonkotsu ramen.

The kakuni was nicely marinated with five spice and soy sauce. Although it could have been braised a little longer to improve its tenderness, it was easily our favorite part of the meal. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.

As for the tonkotsu ramen, the bland broth was far too thin and utterly devoid of the rich porky flavor that it ought to have. They used yellow ramen noodles which were nothing special. Their ""chashu"", if you can even call it that, was atrocious! It was a single thick and leathery-tough slab of the saltiest pork either of us have ever tasted. We both scrambled for our water glasses after taking a bite and left the rest of this hunk of meat untouched.

We did not fare any better with the okonomiyaki or takoyaki. They both suffered from the same gummy and soggy batter and were completely unappetizing.

While the service was okay and the prices were relatively inexpensive, Shuseki is a poor value because of the low quality of its food. I am sorely tempted to assign it 1 star, but because of its decent kakuni and mediocre katsu curry and shoyu ramen from a previous visit, I suppose it just barely merits 2 stars. Will we return? Highly doubtful.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,4,2,2,WyxJ4-su0Gfm6E_TfjyFQQ

As we waited various different  groups of people arrived and in total there were about 20 people scattered amongst the seating area. We waited and waited and waited for our food, everyone around us gets their food and after about 1 hr and 15min I receive my food. I get it and it is a half order of ramen and 6 pieces of gyoza... Barely puts a dent in my stomach but I am afraid to order anything else because if I did I might as well order dinner since it will take so long. How long does it take to make a ramen order? The broth is already made, the noodle just have to be warmed in boiling water, and the Kalbi doesn't take much to cook and throw in soup????

The ramen noodles are pretty good but the broth was average and the Kalbi was tough and rubbery. Gyoza was average, no better or worse than the frozen ones at the grocery store.",9qMz5MDVSUvBs3UC1UOeMA,0,0,2,N092NGfUorxfNUueojNSRQ

I eat here about twice a week, and I have no intention of stopping anytime soon. They have a small crew of sweet, polite, fluent Japanese-speaking waitstaff, composed mostly of females. 

When we go there, they seat us promptly, and if you go often enough (like we do) they remember your preferences. For example, we always order green tea and water, and my boyfriend dislikes ginger and miso soup. They always remember this, after about the third time they didn't ask anymore. 

I appreciate the ambiance, it's low-key and somewhat earthy. I like that the girls who work there shuffle their own iPods on the stereo. It is changing all the time, and mostly Japanese, but I like that.

Sharing dishes is encouraged, and the entrees are pretty big. Sushi is exceptionally fresh for being in the desert. I love the mochi ice cream and the bathrooms are always clean.",Q7XH8lfEzWEIRtfsUfgbPQ,0,0,5,KD3Sd3UXwBLGfFhLTXT9wA

The service was quick at first, then as we got our order, they disappeared to talk to a single guy at the bar.  Water was never refilled, we were ignored unless they were bringing the next part of our order.
Their Korokke (Potato Croquettes) were ok, but nothing special.  I also tried an order of the kara-age, and it was the only thing I had that night that I enjoyed.
Since I wanted to try a bit of everything, I tried the tonkotsu ramen, the gyoza, and the okonomiyaki.
The ramen was the worst bowl of noodles I've ever had.  Instant noodles would have blown this out of the water.
The gyoza was the only time in my life I've turned down a plate of potstickers.  They were obviously pre-made and frozen, poorly cooked, and probably expired.  They tasted like rubber.
Okonomiyaki was half decent, but was trying to be too much.  Keep your okonomiyaki simple, don't throw in everything you have in the kitchen.  It was also far too thick, and a little under-done in the middle.
I'm normally not one to complain like this.  I tend to only review out of happiness, but I was so disappointed with the food I had to post this.",PD9AKxAYTzIWsRvVyrFbrA,1,0,2,2l4HyzTfpgeKq9yCF104_g

It used to be a pretty tasty place, but after this last visit, they -have- to improve ALOT for me to return. The place was decenly busy, but only one waitress for the entire place. Therefore, she was not very attentive.

The food was pretty disappointing, as well. I got their tonkotsu ramen, and I guess Monta has REALLY spolied me for the good stuff. The broth was weak, and flavorless, the 2 slices of chashu were unseasoned, boiled bits of nothing.

My husband ordered the katsu curry set, and whar he got was just gross and unacceptable. The curry sauce seemed from a pre-made boxed mix, and it was cold, and seperating from itself. I know that a boxed Japanese curry mix -can- be fantastic, if it's hot, and decently tended. It looked VERY unappetizing. The katsu was freshly made, tho and was decent. (so he said) 
The waitress seemed to avoid us, and never -once- asked how the food was. No matter, as we were running late and actually getting a fresh order just wasen't going to work that day.

I mean c'mon, on one occasion after we ate our food, we had to cancel our ONE order of sushi because the waitress said they ran out of rice. I guess there's a first time for EVERYTHING! 

The most upsetting experience was not too long ago. My boyfriend and I were eating and ready to pay our bill so we give a debit card and ONLY JUST THEN did the waitress say CC machine is down and it's cash only. I asked why weren't we told earlier (because I don't ever carry cash on me) and she said there's a sign on the cash register which no one ever sees cuz we all pay our bill from our tables. The sign should've been placed either before the entrance or right upon entering or staff should've told customers before ordering. I believe we weren't the only customers in this situation because there were two families dealing with this inconvenience. While my boyfriend stayed at the restaurant, I had to leave and get cash in order to pay the bill, delaying our after dinner plans. Our waitress and other staff didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. They just wanted to get paid.  We WERE regular customers.

It's a crazy relationship. One minute I'm in love, the next I'm like ""What was I thinking?"" There's some items on the menu that are good, and others that need improvement. Even my friends and family members that have tried Shuseki feel the same- they don't hate it, but they don't love it either. Perhaps I'm just eating the wrong dishes.

Chicken Katsu Curry Rice- Pretty good. The rice is fluffy and sticky, the curry sauce is overflowing and flavorful. Not the best Japanese curry I've had in Vegas, but definitely in the top 5.
Shrimp Tempura Udon- The dish that I order the most often from Shuseki. You can't really go wrong with an udon soup dish on a cold night, the broth is delicious and really fills you up.
Takoyaki- Your standard Takyoaki with Japanese mayonnaise and fish flakes. Definitely fulfills my Takoyaki cravings whenever they occur.
Korokke(Croquette)- One of their better appetizers. Always crunchy on the outside, soft and moist on the inside. 

Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen- Not a fan of Shuseki's ramen. I've tried most of their ramen dishes, and the Spicy Tonkatsu Ramen is the one that disappointed me the most. It's flavored with chili oil that separates itself from the broth, the broth itself is bland and watery, and ramen noodles overcooked. The bowl only looks huge, but it is mostly filled with soup rather than noodles and pork. 
Yaki Udon- Again, a dish that falls flat on flavor and content. Flavor is OK, tastes like something I could have made at home. I like my noodle dishes with more noodles than meat or vegetables. This one has more bean sprouts than noodles!
Sushi- Some rolls are better than others, but you don't really come to Shuseki for sushi. For the price that you're paying, you can find fresher/better quality fish at restaurants that do specialize in sushi. 

Service is decent for a Chinatown restaurant. It never truly gets crowded (meaning I've never seen more than half of the tables full), but when a few tables do come in at the same time, I've noticed that the one waiter or waitress on duty gets overwhelmed at times and rarely gets back-up. Prices are decent, the lunch specials and bento boxes are pretty good deals.

Shuseki serves Japanese dishes, known for its ramen bowls, and a assortment of other foods that include sushi, and seafood in general. Although it is a 'Japanese' restaurant, its owned by a Chinese man raised in Japan (I believe) who speaks mandarin.
Shuseki is hardly ever a busy place, so its actually an ideal spot to chill out where its quiet. Every time I have been to Shuseki there is at most 2-4 other tables. Otherwise, what keeps this place afloat is the regulars who come here and elder groups of Japanese men who frequent at night.
Service is average here is kind of slow, the servers could do a better job of circulating around the tables and pay attention more. You're better off paying at the counter than asking for your bill! However, they are polite and informative if you have questions about the menu.
To make up for the slow servers, at least the food comes out in a good amount of time!
Fish here can be a hit or miss, so be weary when you order sushi or sashimi of any kind. Best time to get the fresh fish from them is actually during lunch time.
The ramen they offer here is actually decent. But its sometimes a hit and miss again with the ramen.

What does it matter unless you are properly trained? People ought to judge food based on taste and not on who/what race is the person makes it. Food for thought.

LOCATION: Tucked away in the corner of the plaza near the bottom-floor garage, I feel like it often gets overlooked. Definitely not as packed as Ichiza, which also serves japanese dishes, it's a nice change. Food came out relatively quick.

PRICE: Relatively low-priced around $7-$8, the dishes left us pretty full. My friends ended up having to roll me through the door because I decided not to waste any food.

FOOD: My friends and I ordered the omusoba and yakisoba. My yakisoba arrived greasy, crackling, and heaping. The omusoba is the exact same thing, but with over-egg encasing the top of the noodles. Topped with pickled ginger and japanese mayonnaise, it was the perfect food soaker for the late-night drinking crowd. How can you go wrong with uber-greasy noodles, lettuce, beef, and sliced carrots?! It was filling and tasty.

As far as their sushi and ramen go DON'T. I've been here enough times through the years to order the food they're good at making. The problem with shuseki is, it has this massive menu but they don't have specialty in making any one dish. They aren't really known for spectacularly done items. I believe they try to tackle too much. 

This might explain why this place is always dead. Everytime I come here, it's pretty empty. Even on the weekends, I hardly see it filled up or too busy. Great place to meet up with a whole group of people.

Our server was attentive, and went to check on us often to refill our waters.

It's a decent place to pop in for something simple, but not somewhere to impress out-of-towners. I would just suggest Shuseki to make cut their huge menu down and focus on improving on the dishes they do well/improve the ones they do not.

The interior of the restaurant is decorated with different earth tones and lots of wood. It is a very calming design, until you see the menu of course. 

The menu contains TONS of choices with TONS of colored photos. You may think this helps in organizing your order, but for me it only made things crazier. After some hot tea and about ten minutes of menu investigation, I ordered the following: 

Agedashi - Nicely crisp, flash-fried tofu bathed in a deliciously light broth. I really loved the salt that the broth infused into the tofu, and would absolutely order it again. 

Tuna Sashimi - Very disappointing, this tasted like the tuna you may find frozen at your local Asian supermarket. The texture was a bit tough, and it was sliced way too thick, which only exaggerates the unfavorable texture. I took my two bites, and pushed the plate out of reach. 

Grilled Rice Ball - Good Texture, but tasted heavily like charcoal and fish. This is a result of cooking it on the same spot of the grill that some seafood was prepared minutes earlier. I didn't mind the taste, since grill + fish = mouth party, but this is not how the dish should taste. 

Omarice - I have been eating Korean food my whole life, and consider this dish something of a novelty. It's fried rice wrapped in an egg omelet, covered in ketchup. I'm not a ketchup fanatic, but the flavors usually compliment each other really well. Unfortunately Shuseki's was the worst I ever had. The egg was still raw, and the rice was inconsistently cooked, parts were overcooked and others not. Again, two bites and I was done with this. 

Chicken Skewer - No complaints, grilled wonderfully, lightly seasoned and delicious. 

What makes Shuseki worth the trip is the assortment of items and the value. Everything is very inexpensive, to the point that you may not believe your eyes. It is a good way to try new things, and expand your palette capital, if you follow me. I will definitely be coming back to experience more of this menu. 

Not a big fan of the Shuseki t-shirts for sale on the wall though. It's just a little too campy for how good this place could be.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,3,1,3,rIU7xcSmWFz8gRb2keJ4Tw

Did try one of the spicy ramen bowls - really liked the broth - the noodles, hmmm, can you say, TOP RAMEN

sadly, had to knock it down one star because the salmon sashimi my daughter ordered was partially frozen !   Admittedly, i tried to convince her to avoid the sushi since my sense was this is not a place to go for the sushi.

should also knock it down a slight notch because the bacon wrapped asparagus was a disappointment ( raku is on a totally different level with this dish )

I had ordered a Takoyaki and a Yakiudon. Had a friend order their Cold Tan Tan Noodles and her boyfriend ordered an Omusoba, another friend had ordered a fried rice. 

The cold tan tan noodles are different from any of the traditional ones you may find. this is more of a noodle salad vs the ramen style or sichuan style. Lots of veggies (lettuce and tomatoes) with a ""spicy"" dressing/sauce. 

Omusoba is a normal yakisoba with a okonomiyaki style egg/dressing wrapped like if its was an omurice. Friend had said it was good but too salty (apparently was a on-going trend being the noodles....)

The takoyaki was good. Freshly made and hot. Flavored well. Thoroughly cooked without any residual flour taste. 

Yakiudon. huge portion came out on a sizzling hot plate. overly salty. caused me to drink a lot of tea to balance it out. Otherwise would have been good. If you are a small eater, this may be big enough to share. 

Service was mediocre. Even when it wasnt busy. A lot of workers were just sitting/standing around and needed to be called on.

They have a huge menu with over 100 different dishes including appetizers, sushi/sashimi, ramen/udon, skewers, bentos, and desert.

My favorite meals are probably the Karubi Don (BBQ short ribs) and the Katsu Curry. However, their ramen is worth a try and most of their appetizers are good. I also recommend the tempura ice cream for desert. The food generally doesn't let me down and is worth the price. If you can make it to lunch, their lunch specials are a steal.

I also really like the atmosphere. It's comfortable, big, and quiet. The place can fit a lot of people, but there usually aren't more than a couple other tables when I go.

Though I am only basing this on 3 trips and having only tried the tempura udon noodles, chicken katsu curry and the OMG roll, I was very satisfied with the eating experience.  The food is decent, and the staff is nice enough.

1.  Udon noodles - 1.  Perfectly cooked noodle texture on a late night snack cravings around 1030 pm.  2.  Slightly overcooked on a lunch meal around 3 pm on another day.  Overall.  The tempurature of the soup was so super hot that I burned myself the first time I ate it.  That's how noodle soups should be!  I like it!
2.  Chicken katsu curry - Can't really go too wrong with Japanese curry, right?  hmmmm.. went back and it actually be subpar
3.  OMG sushi roll - Inside was tempura shrimp with avocado.  Outside was a layer of tuna sashimi, deep fried onions (yes!  fried!) and a drizzle of some tangy sauce.  nom nom nom....
4.  gyoza is juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside
5.  Omellete rice is decent but could be better

7.  deep fried squid is a winner

This is VERY helpful in an ethnic restaurant, even if it's a food you are reasonably familiar with.

Do NOT go if you are on a time crunch.  I don't think I've seen more than one waitress at a time every time I've gone there.  And, their English isn't the best, but they usually take the time to make sure they clarify your order.

I should state, I cannot speak to their sushi selection as it is the one area of their menu I am completely unfamiliar with.

Can't exactly remember what i ordered but there was a lot of skewers. Honestly the skewers at Kyara are seasoned a little nicer and grilled to perfection.

I heard very mixed things about this place - that it was past it's glory days, that the very particular Japanese dishes such as Takoyaki and Okonomiyaki were a disappointment, that it was not authentic Japanese, etc.  Which is a shame because my MO was to locate a restaurant that has great Okonomiyaki.  After the enormous shame that was Doh! Tapas and Sushi (again, another restaurant that has no business serving Izakaya style food), I was SO hopeful.

First off: Not Japanese run.  This restaurant is Izakaya style and when I asked the server if this was a Izakaya, looked utterly confused.  Okay, then.  Plays Japanese music, serves Japanese food, Japanese notes on wall - not Japanese.  

Lousy service.  One poor, friendly waitress running around for seven tables.  SEVEN tables.  My water sat empty after my initial gulp and my hot tea sat in a similar fate.  (And they only have sweet iced tea?  Who does that?)

The server attempted to sit me next to a giant family table with a screaming baby.  Meanwhile, about twenty other tables sat empty.  Uh, what?  WHY would you do that?  

I ordered Takoyaki, Gyoza, and of course, Okonomiyaki.

Takoyaki - Best thing I had.  Perfectly executed.  
Gyoza - swimming with grease.  Tasted like it came from the Chinese hands of someone at Orchid Garden, oily and flavorless.  I wanted to gag after eating that until..
Okonomiyaki - SO DAMN GREASY and BURNT and what IS this?  Is it that hard to make?  Do I have to open up my own Okonomiyaki restaurant?  For shame!  There was a booth, a BOOTH at last year's Aki Matsuri that served up only Okonomiyaki and it was so simple and delicious and perfect.  

The only saving grace this place has is that it's cheap.  

Also - .50 cent charge for credit cards.  Get out.  So disappointed.  You know when the local restaurants in the plaza don't even recommend to eat at an establishment that there's a problem.  From service to food, I cannot and will not return.",lxf_9ap6K75XdSn97V8_Mw,1,1,2,wBYjFVtaaL3LkBMI3_ygxg

We found the joint with little trouble, and found quick parking. from the outside, the size of this place is a bit deceiving. it looks small, but is very big inside. our party of 7 got sat right away, by a very nice lady with a thick Japanese accent. after surveying the vast menu, the 7 of us made our selections. i opted for the Tonkatsu Ramen, and the groom got the TanTan Ramen. all the guys ordered different stuff and agreed to share. after a short while, our food began to make its way out of the kitchen. my Ramen arrived in a rather large, tank-like, bowl. the broth was decent, and the noodles had a good consistency. i had a sip of the grooms TenTen Ramen, and enjoyed the slight spicy-ness it offered. i sampled Sushi, Tempura, and a concoction called a ""Japanese Pizza"". all of it was tasty, and everyone was happy.

Thank you, Yelp, for helping me look like a hero to my bro's. hang-overs alleviated, and the groom re-vitalized, we gladly tipped the service heavily, and made our way back to the strip. from there, its all pretty much a blur...thats my story, and im sticking to it.",h8w5nGWM3-CPA0mVIvXwHQ,2,4,4,AT47S0HqnpCN3v5DYAKK9Q

I was really excited to see the extensive menu here which included common izakaya staples, sushi, sashimi, and ramen. Maybe I ought to have held my enthusiasm until after I tasted the food.

We ordered the okonomiyaki, the takoyaki, the kakuni and a bowl of their tonkotsu ramen.

The tonkotsu ramen has a long way to go. The broth was too thin to really let the pork flavour shine through. The noodles were okay but nothing to shout home about. The worst thing about this bowl of ramen was the chasu - it wasn't chasu at all. It was one large slab of really oversalted pork. I grabbed for my water glass soon after taking a bite.

The problem with the okonomiyaki and the takoyaki was the same because they used the same batter. The texture of the batter is too gummy and was unappetizing. Also, I think the wetness of the batter also made it hard to remain crisp on the outside because relatively soon after it came to the table, it started to become soggy.

The highlight of the meal was the kakuni. The kakuni was marinated nicely in a soy/five spice concoction and was relatively tender. It could have used a little more braising but it was okay.

When our crew arrived, the restaurant was empty. We had a few moments of second guessing, wondering if we found the right place, but the waitress eased our fears and seated us in a booth.

Right off the bat, I ordered my favorite; Takoyaki!  I find something inherently beautiful in a skilled grill-maestro crafting crisp rounded exteriors cradling molten hot, gooey, yamaimo/nagaimo infused batter and tender chunks of tako. These rounds are then doused in japanese mayo, benishoga/red ginger and wispy bonito flakes- though toppings vary depending on the establishment.  HERE, they were crisp on the exterior and more chewy than gooey on the inside, with a few small pieces of tako suspended within. Less toppings than I'm used to seeing, more solid and perhaps a bit more overcooked. They were satisfactory, but not outstanding. 

After the takoyaki, we shared rounds of sushi rolls around the table. The rolls were pretty normal, Americanized rolls. Nothing particularly outstanding. We tried the; Kamikaze roll [spicy tuna inside with eel & avocado outside], a Tiger roll [shrimp tempura inside topped with spicy tuna, avocado and masago] & a Cali crunch roll [deep fried california roll topped with masago]. We finished a couple of the rolls but the cali crunch had most of it left when we departed. Meh.

I ordered the Spicy Pork Miso Ramen, which was recommended by our waitress. It was  A HUGE bowl, with enough food for me to donate several bowls around the table and to share with my boyfriend. Chewy egg noodles, ground pork and a hearty, umami miso-rich broth with lots of chili oil floating on top drenched in a lake of soup. It was a flavorful broth, but not  anything to scream ""YATTA!"" over. There was 1/2 a hard boiled egg, which was cooked beautifully [the yolk was still creamy and custard] and one gristly, fatty, sad looking piece of pork. sono buta wa mazui deshita... :{ Better than top ramen, yes, but not particularly crave worthy.

Maybe we went at a bad time of night. The tempura seemed well done, but I only had a few nibbles off the pieces my boyfriend pilfered from our friends, such as the asparagus and pepper. The vegetables seemed crispy, which is a plus.  I'd like to try other items, such as their grilled meats, okonomiyaki & sashimi menu before I completely write them off. 

There are a lot of Xs on the menu, and the specials weren't available while we were there. They advertise Asahi on their beer list but really only offer Sapporo. 

 I'll probably be back, eventually. I want to give them the benefit of the doubt because they were suggested to me by a friend who's lived in Japan. I'm hoping it was an off-night. :}",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,3,1,2,BDuntc94Zk5SvosiR6DxgQ

The food was ""ok"" (if you are gaijin and don't know any better), but I think they're losing their business to the newer Japanese specialty restaraunts where they take pride in what they serve, like Sora, Monta, Zen, Ichiza, Tonkatsu Kiyoshi. I can't see this place staying in business much longer unless they come up with something new (like servers with mini-skirts or something) Also watch your bill closely, they will sneak a Gratuity to your bill without letting you know about it, this happened to me many years ago and apparently this criminal practice still continues today, Becareful not to double-tip !",xdQKvjzjH9JOnEKwhxoqQg,0,0,2,1B9MawdcEpkQ1RFIxHseJg

Food:
We ordered...
Salmon Sashimi - I wasn't impressed with the quality of the salmon. 
Philly Roll & California Crunch Roll - Both are very similiar deep friend rolls.  I thought they were ok but didn't quite have as much CRUNCH as I thought it would be.
Beef Tongue - Very flavorful.
Omelette rice - I've never had this dish before and it was very tasty. It's topped with ketchup which I'm not use to eating with an asian dish but it made the dish. This dish is perfect for comfort food. Simple yet good.
Shuseki House Ramen - I was excited to finally try the ramen here and was a little dissapointed. Could just be a bad night. The Shuseki ramen had a hard boiled egg, pork, shrimp, bamboo, scallions, etc. I felt that the bamboo flavor was a little over powering in the broth. 

Service:
I thought the service tonight was horrible. It took a while to even be acknowledged when we were waiting at the entrance before we were seated. Once seated, it took several minutes again to get some service to ask a few questions about their specialties and order our beverages. The food took forever and so did the check. Oh...and I never got my extra bowl to share the ramen dish nor did I get my hot chili. =(

They have great sushi and their other dishes are just as excellent as the udon...but I CAN'T HELP IT.  I GET IT EVERY TIME.  I'm incorrigible, I admit it.

They have this one really cute waitress there.  She has the daintiest voice I've ever heard and her smile makes her look just like an anime character.  She's my fave...and the guy with orangey hair.  He's legit.  He reminds me of Jet Li for some reason.  I always feel like if a fight were to go down, he'd be jumping over the booths and knockin mofos out with bamboo sticks.

It has egg, chicken, noodles, etc.  I suppose the flavor of the broth is what sets it apart, very good stuff.

I've also liked some of the lunch specials.  The curried pork is pretty good, although I am personally not a big fan of this style of curry (kind of a thick Indian curry).

Shuseki is a nice location because it's not too overly crowded or a squeezed tuna can venue like some other restaurants I've been at Spring Mountain.  Plus parking is so easy, I never have to circle around trying to find a space.

The food is great and all, but one thing that sticks out to me, that almost EVERY restaurant seems to get wrong, are the menus.  Not Shuseki, though, their menu is perfect! I mean every single dish in their menu has some sort of picture or visual.  I love it! Now we don't have to deal with any messy translations or foreign dish titles we aren't familiar with (like how would you explain what Natto is without a picture? Fermented stringy Japanese beans.  Doesn't sound very appetizing, does it?)

I had the Karaage, Ten Ten Ramen, Philadelphia Roll (my fav), and some fried rice.  So good.  I would say that the ramen was a pinch too salty, but it could just be me.  Prices are off the CHAIN, it only came out to about $20.  I just love it when I eat good food with a good price value (yes I'm cheap).  The only tiny detail that left me from giving it a full five stars is that they were out of too many selections.  If you see on the menu there's a number of ""OUT"" or ""Not Available"" foods, and the Shisamo (Grilled Smelt Fish) that I ordered, the waitress returned only to tell me they were out.  :( :(

Still, service is off the chain, location is nice, parking is swell, and food price and quality is yummy.

2988517,2014-11-05,0,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"Ate here a few times, mostly out of convenience because it is in a part of Chinatown I usually go to.  The food was always okay, not great, and the service was mediocre.  However, after my terrible experience with my last visit here, I don't think I'll ever eat here again.

First off, the service is terrible.  Their open hours stated that they were open today from 11:30AM-1AM, although when we got there around 4:45, they were closed.  We found out later that they re-open at 5, although there was no way of knowing that just from going there, since it doesn't state that anywhere on a sign.  However, we didn't mind waiting, although they didn't open the doors until well after 5:10.  We were the only customers in there, yet the waitress hardly paid us any attention and instead seemed to be actively ignoring us.

We ordered what we came there for - the beef udon soup, which was good as usual.  We also decided to try their nikujaga and omurice, which is where things started to go wrong.  First of all, their nikujaga clearly states ""beef and potatoes"" under it, yet when we received the dish there were no potatoes to be found, only a few pieces of fatty beef stewing in an overly-salty sauce, along with an egg.  No onions and no potatoes, which I was willing to overlook (although it was definitely a rip-off).  However, when the omurice came out, it was soggy, disgusting, and nearly drowning in ketchup.  We only had to take a bite each to know that it was nasty.  We wanted to let the waitress know, but she didn't come by our table for at least 15 minutes more (despite there not being any other customers) until we waved her over.

After letting her know we didn't like the omurice, she stared at us blankly and asked what she should do.  We asked her to send it back, when she rudely and bluntly told us ""Well I can't, because you ate it"", even though we literally took two bites from it before knowing it was inedible.  We were taken aback by this rudeness and didn't even know what to say.  I offered to order something else in it's stead (the yaki udon, which was also mediocre), but when it came time to pay, she still tried to charge us for the omurice we didn't eat.  We said that if we were going to pay for it, we might as well have kept it instead of sending it back with her.  After making a big deal of calling someone, she grumbled ""Fine this time, but not any more,"" as if she was doing us a big favor for not charging us for something we didn't eat.  We left quickly after that.

On a side note, their water tastes strange.  And they charge $0.50 for using a credit card if your order is under $20.

When you enter in the place has a nice ambiance and decor theme that enjoyable. 

I was immediately greeted and seated and ordered a beer while I look through the menu.

It looks as though noodles bowls and sushi are a large part of their offerings. I chose to order a Teriyaki Chicken bento instead.

The bento arrived and It looked ok. I think the portion of chicken was meager portion & for the salad, it was simply iceberg lettuce with a tomato wedge dressed in thousand island dressing. I could make this entire meal at home. I was hoping for something a little more authentic, less Americanized, especially being in China Town.

I wouldn't recommend this place, there are better places to enjoy noodle bowls and basic teriyaki chicken.

But enough of the crappy service, let's get to the food.  The ramen - good.

They overcooked the noodle a degree or so, but otherwise the soup stock was good.  I had the korean bbq style, which was a bit unorthodox, but was nicely filling with a shoyu base soup.  I also tasted the miso based, which was just fine.  The best part is that the gyoza appetizer was $2.95 for 6 pieces.  Most places have gotten into the habit of charging up to $7 for the same.  Tsk, tsk.

Interestingly enough, though owned by Japanese, the waitress here was not (Chinese, I believe).  So, do not necessary roll in and bust out your Japanese language skills.

Naturally, this place would be in direct competition with another LV izakaya favorite, Ichiza.  Unfortunately, I cannot comment on this because I was there for lunch and did not have the izakaya menu.

Judging from the ramen, I would say that this place will do nicely.

During the day, this place is pretty empty, so there is only one waitress and probably one cook.  With only three parties in there, the service was actually kind of slow.  Not a big deal, but good to know if you are in a hurry.

Shuseki is tucked away in the corner of the first floor of the strip mall, so keep an eye out for it.  I did not even realize it was there until this visit there, though I had been in the plaza several times before.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,0,0,4,LRMuoLLziK2AHkD3AYZNNQ

The noodles weren't too soft and they weren't too hard. The soup was super hot so you know that this is the good stuff. The sushi rolls looked great, but I wasn't in the mood for sushi.

We went to Shuseki yesterday at 5pm for a snack, and my favorite dessert, honey toast, which is almost comparable to Ichiza's.  Since was not so hungry, we shared the sashimi salad and spicy miso pork ramen.  Both were quite tasty and flavorful.  The spinach and arugula was crisp and taste delicious with the light dressing.  Some of the pieces of fish taste good while others were chewy.  The noodle was cooked just right, with the broth having so much flavor.  It came in a huge bowl that got me really full with just a quarter of the bowl.

When it was time to order my fav dessert, I was told that they ran out

3543670,2013-10-30,0,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"Not one of my favorite places, but the boyfriend & I came here yesterday because we wanted ramen since it was cold and our usual place (Ramen Tatsu - must try!) is closed on Mondays. 

One of the reasons I do like this place is it's never really busy so we always get seated quickly and we've never waited a long time for our food to come out. It's a good place to eat as a ""plan B"" if your first choice doesn't work out. They also have a good variety of drinks, alcoholic & non-alcoholic. Another plus is that there's a picture for everything on the menu. 

I normally have the house ramen but wanted to try something new and was in the mood for spicy so I asked our waitress if the spicy pork ramen came with char siu. She said no. So I asked her if I can add char siu to it, and she said no. Then she told me besides the short rib ramen, none of their ramen come with char siu, they only have pork. I pointed to one of the pictures and said ""Really? That looks like char siu to me!"" Her reply was ""That's not char siu, that's pork."" WHAT?! Char siu IS pork! For a waitress that works at a ramen place, I am really surprised she didn't know what char siu was. Anyway, then she asked another waitress who was MUCH more helpful. I heard them speaking Chinese to each other so I busted out my Chinese and got myself through the order. 

Finally, I ordered the spicy pork ramen and added char siu (turns out I CAN do that, just had to pay extra which is okay with me). The flavor was good and I like their noodles. 

My boyfriend got the short rib ramen. The short ribs had no flavor but the soup was really salty. Backwards much?

Also ordered a Kamikaze roll. They don't have the freshest fish, but it's still okay. 

Total was around $32 for 3 food orders with 2 drinks so not bad. Shuseki is not so bad where we wouldn't come back - In general, their food is OKAY; not spectacular but not horrible either. We do come here once in a while and I would've given them 3 stars had our waitress not argued with me about the char siu.",NV-2HTbjZhxCSpQQqBXZGg,1,0,2,lkP1l-gWbdcFhyZ170Hpqw
3563396,2010-10-24,0,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"This restaurant has me very torn.

Pros:

* Everything on the menu has a picture.
I personally like that because it whets my appetite and it is a fun idea for a menu.

* Good food.
 My favorite thing to get is either the short rib bowl, ton katsu, or katsu don. If you order a bowl from the last page of their menu then you get a complimentary miso soup, which is a big plus for me. I always find that my shorts ribs are a bit on the burned side but I can live with that. 

BUT don't eat the sushi here. It sucks really bad :p I had the Baked Japanese Lasagna Roll and couldn't bring myself to eat it after the first piece.

*Great variety.
Tons of good food to choose from because of their extensive menu!

*Great prices.
$8.99 for a short rib bowl with tons of rice and kimchi is a fantastic price! Not to mention the free soup ^.^ Everything on their menu is very well-priced for the good-tasting food so it always has me coming back.

Con:
 *The service =_=
That would be my only big complaint. Every single time that I have been there, we were not seated or greeted immediately. Whenever anyone from our group wanted to order something extra, it seemed like the servers were never paying attention to us and it took them awhile to notice we needed a refill on our drinks. I just wish they were more aware of their surroundings and more attentive to customers seeing how it is never packed or very busy when we come in.

Shuseki's menu had an eclectic mix of Japanese and Korean dishes.  My mom and stepdad ordered a variety of small dishes, including several grilled squid, spinach, a rice ball, and a broiled salmon dish my Issei mother found on the untranslated specials.  My boyfriend and I stuck to comfort food and ordered shoyu ramen, tonkatsu curry, and croquettes.  My ramen was decent though the noodles were slightly overdone.  It was traditional style with bamboo shoots and pork.  The croquettes were perfect on the outside but bland in the center.  The curry was a tad sweeter than I prefer. I didn't try the robata dishes although they looked tasty.

3675193,2014-02-25,1,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"What can I say, I'm a big fan of Shuseki. Yeah, I know the fish isn't the freshest I can find in the valley and the menu doesn't really set itself apart from the other Japanese spots... But hey, I rarely have anything to complain about when I hit this place up. Not a fan of the loud and boisterous vibe of other tapas places? Looking for a place to come and dine and have a casual conversation without shouting over your tapas? Then Shuseki has got you covered. I am a big fan of a relaxed, chill dining experience and Shuseki is low-key enough to coax me back for multiple visits of the same expectation; a big plus in my book. Also, the servers are always nice and friendly so that's additional cool points that I'm throwing their way.

Some of my favorite grubs here include the sashimi plate, the grilled whole squid, and the garlic tuna sashimi cuts with avocado on the side. However my usual go to plates are the Japanese fried rice omelet, the okonomiyaki, or the oyako don (the latter being my favorite). I could go on and on with all the other dishes, but these are the few that I find I order the most. The thing I love most about this place is the price. For example, the oyako don (my favorite) is big enough to ease my belly into satiety as it comes with a big bowl of chicken with an egg on top and a flavorful bowl of miso soup. Surprisingly enough, it's only $7.99 and I somehow find a way to take some home as leftovers. When you have an appetite like I do, the fact that I can take home some leftovers is just.. Wow. Even when I'm with the lady, we usually never hit the $30 mark when we are just grubbing and have no intention of getting involved with libations. Now that's what I'm talking about. 

Like I said, some people prefer the loud and exciting atmosphere of the other Japanese Tapas bars in the area but Shuseki hits the spot better for me. Price is good, food is grubbing, and the atmosphere is nice and comfy.",zB1GFKkXqn-vgoIgkjhPYg,8,4,5,MpW3yD9oHCeyK42iuMda0Q
3698083,2012-06-18,0,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"This restaurant is nooked in that small corner by the parking garage of the Pacific Asian Plaza. It's one of my favorite spots to go to! I love their food here, and to me it's always been the best udon noodle soup I've eaten (unless someone can show me a place that offers a better bowl). I always order the beef udon soup here, and occasionally their kimchee fried rice with is also delicious! Prices usually range in the $5-10.00 group for their dishes so it's actually a fairly decent price if you're going out late at night with friends or for a date.

I guess I find their space appealing only because it's bigger than Ichiza or Tratorria Nakamura-Ya. Obviously, those restaurants are built to have a small place like they do in Japan, but Shuseki's space is alittle bigger, and less busier. Which I love! I don't have to talk over other customers! I don't have to wait so long for service, and there's just so much space to...ah...breathe. 

So if you're looking for a place to eat with a group with an intent to have a decent conversation that you can carry I'd suggest this spot. I think it could be intimate with their booths that they offer, and the quiet atmosphere. However, be warned. The decor is slightly tacky with their red walls and cheaply done as it seems, but I PROMISE, if you're date isn't too high maintenance and is just looking for a place to talk and eat, it's a good go and a thumbs up for me (trust. i went on a date there once, and it was a good date)",a48HhwcmjFLApZhiax41IA,1,2,4,uMhp70I0qxrzloq3zgpN_w

the inside is very nice, family run restaurant.  nothing fancy but neat, clean and presentable.  we were seated on a long table with a bench along the wall and chairs opposite it.  and any place which has food items written in the native (non-english) is alright by me.  

the food was tasty and had a lot of choices: ramen (noodle soup), don-buri (some meat over rice), sushi, yakitori (grilled meat on a stick), and the small little plates kinda of like japanese dim sum, but more to be eaten with beer or alcohol.  they also had some unusual dishes such as, omurice, omelette over rice, and okinomiyaki, japanese style pancake.  their alcohol selection is also very nice, with a choice of beer, shochu, chu-hi, and sake as well.  all in all a very complete menu.
 
me my buddy henry got all the yakitoris, about 8 varieties, there was also a nice selection of ramen.  my wife ordered the shoyu or soy sauce broth, which had a nice soup base and had 3 slices of cha-shu pork as well as a bevy of bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, green onions, and a sheet of nori (red laver, kelp).  my buddy the wyster got the tantan noodles, which were hot and spicy, chopped meat with soybean paste and lots of chili peppers.  my other buddies, mike and shay, ordered the sushi, which was great.  they have some pretty unique rolls and a lot of deep fried makis as well.  all in all the food was very delicious and came out pretty fast.  

so if you are looking for some japanese food in las vegas and you are around chinatown, come to this place, you will not be dissapointed. and they are open until 2 a.m. every night, or is that morning?

cons... parking is tight, and not too many spaces for the size of the mall, but i think there was more underneath or behind the mall.  oh the bathroom was clean but the toilet in the men's bathroom was missing the top of the commode, so when you flush it you get a little spurt of water, funny but interesting.",f7pbQuon-3GbyNbzcNSQdQ,2,1,5,9LiWdu1I4PjrhZj154M-RA

Shuseki's a sort of fancier version of Ichiza, with many of the same items on the menu at a slightly higher price and no specials on the walls. The food is still very good, and the people were nice enough, catering to a large group like ourselves. We were seated in the take-your-shoes-off section, which was fun but not so fun when your legs start to cramp because they don't have the convenient pit in the middle like Ichiza.

Are they that busy with the other two tables that the okonomyaki will take that long?  My brothers odered sushi and the spicey pork ramen, while my sister ordered some udon.  

My brother who ordered the sushi and sashimi was the smart one.  The restaurant might have been out of tea this night, but they sure as heck were not low on salt!  I didn't think drinking a salt lick was possible, yet here it was.  The oden was incredibly salty.  Good thing I guess, that I had hot water instead of tea since I had to pour my entire cup of hot water into the oden to dilute the saltiness.  I thought the oden might have been a fluke, but sadly no....my sister's udon, my youngest brother's pork ramen, even the oyakodon and accompanying miso soup were just grossly over salted.  Sure enough, the okonomyaki did take a while to come.  When it did, boy, it was obvious why it took so long: they had to bake it!  It was a two layer cake, it was so thick.

For an appetizer I wanted to order the Creamy crab croquette but sadly that item was crossed out with a black marker so the waitress suggested Takoyaki (Fried Octopus Balls) - she said everyone orders that so I felt  peer pressured and I ordered that. I love most seafood and I can really enjoy me some Octopus however, this dish was too fishy tasting for me. The batter for the balls was good but when you got to the octopus it was just too tough to eat. Good octopus is chewy but still tender at the same time. On top of the Takoyaki was sprinkled fish flakes which just added to the strong fishy taste. Too bad though cause I really wanted to enjoy this dish.....
We also got Bento Boxes - mine consisted of Ginger Pork,rice,salad,croquette, a small piece of daikon and miso soup. The BF's had all that but Chicken Teriyaki instead of the Ginger Pork.
The Ginger Pork was tasty but too soupy-maybe if it was a bit drier- I love daikon and I wish places would serve more of it as a side dish- The sauce for the Chicken Teriyaki was good. I was disappointed with the salad dressing - it was just Italian-No No No, when I go to a Japanese Rest. I want some good Japanese Dressing not Italian. I could go to my nearest pizza place or even McDonalds for Italian Salad Dressing.

Our orders consisted of:

- Beef Tongue Skewers - Very delicious, especially with a hint of lemon. 

- Chicken Gizzard Skewer - Chewy, yet interesting. Something different, but definitely yummy.

- Buta Sausage - OMG! Amazing! The juices oozed out of the sausage like crazy! I wish there were more than 3 on a skewer, that's my only critic. 

- Japanese Pizza - Very strange, but tasty. The dough's stuffed with some kind of pancake or mochi like mix, with veggies like corn and onions, and some other greens. The flavors for this is such a mind blowing amount of flavor that I was kind of overwhelmed.

- Omusoba - Yakisoba noodles with an omelette and Japanese mayo served on top. Another dish with many flavors, I couldn't pin point it.

The prices, are OK I guess.  I wouldn't consider it too expensive.  But paying $1.50 to $1.00 for a tiny skewer does seem a bit up there.",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,2,2,4,rN5T_eJ1t0ZnEbw7FebtHw
4341452,2007-10-04,1,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"Shuseki is in the bottom corner of a two story Asian strip mall. Once inside, it is pretty large, with booths, tables, and only a small sushi bar of about 7 chairs. 

The night I went, there was one young sushi chef named Gagyou. actually, that is his Japanese name. His real name is He You, and he is from Tianjin, China. But he did live in Osaka, Japan for a year and worked for Panasonic. He came to LV  because his dad was here. He studied sushi making for a year from the Japanese chef who was here and returned to Japan. Turns out not only He You is Chinese, but so is the owner of Shuseki. 

This revelation explains some things. They do have Japanese style wood menus on the wall, and other Japanese influences and touches. They had 2 young Japanese waitresses that were fluent, but didn't quite act Japanese on first impression. But when it comes to the Sushi, it was definitely not Japanese in preparation, quality or feel. It was reasonably fresh for being in the desert, but not that great. He You sliced the fish improperly too thin, and the rice ball was too small to be considered good sushi. 

He You is fluent in Japanese, having studied it since he was 10, and speaks to the waitresses in Japanese. He just wasn't taught sushi making well, and I owe that to the Chinese ownership, not his Japanese sensei. Nothing against Chinese owners, but sometimes the game is how little they can get by with and make money, instead of how much they can build up a business into a success. The nigiri was reasonable, with the average price being about $4. The Hiyayakko (cold tofu) was prepared and seasoned well with daikon (white raddish), negi (green onion) and katsuyoboshi (dried Bonita fish flakes). 

Shuseki is worth a try, but not the best to be found. Still, compared to the prices of the sushi at the MGM Grand, it's a good deal.",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,2,1,3,tkiXHHnRlGBro7GgmmDNiA

Most of the times were because of Ichiza being too long of a wait or forgetting to make reservations there.  This particular night a friend wanted to go , so I agreed, hoping to see a new and improved place.  Wrong !  
     We went on a Saturday night.  The place wasn't crowded, maybe 6 tables full max.  There were two waitresses working and a guy sitting at the counter helping out whenever he wanted ( maybe owners kid ?? ) It started alright when the waitress came by and got our order.      When the food started coming , she didn't bring any plates or utensils.  We got it after waiting a few minutes when a different waitress brought another round of food.  While she was there we ordered some Kurosawa sake bottle.  During the course of our wait for the other orders , I observed, us getting the wrong plate of food, having to reorder because waitress said we didn't order a certain dish, never getting the sake ( she said they were out, blamed that other waitress who took our order was new)  , table next to us also asked for extra bowls and never got it ( had to get up and grab it themselves).  
            The food and prices were decent, but service was horrendous . The food kept this place from being a one star rating .  It's no wonder this place will never get the crowds like Ichiza.",2CX2v20dckGIryABgzL-zg,1,1,2,aEHCfG6XAMPRJY_2u3x_9A

The one thing I love about this place is their affordable prices for a Japanese restaurant. I know it's a hit or miss for some people but not once was I ever disappointed in any of the dishes. I'm pretty sure I've ordered 90% off their menu throughout the years. I know that the owners aren't Japanese but I see Japanese customers come here all the time so that's telling me ""if it's good enough for them, then it's definitely good enough for me."" So I don't know why some are making it a big deal if they're not Japanese owned *shrugs* 

I admit the service can be really slow, especially when they only have one server on a busy night but they've always been friendly and they always check up on you. I just found out that they now have restaurant.com coupons for Shuseki and I'm a little worried. Restaurants use that website either: if they're new and need a little help promoting their new business, or old restaurants use it when they need help boosting their slowly dying business. I really hope it's not the latter, because it's definitely not the former. I guess I'll have to eat here once a week just in case *knocks on wood* this place is going downhill :(",YUzqKt7hmG5BkRykHeZ0gg,2,2,4,4hLKytMZe_iIaZsrSs_8rA

Just a stones throw away from the strip it serves up pretty authentic Japanese dishes and is open late (which I love!!!!!!)  After eating here I was shocked at how empty it was.  Perhaps it is too close in radius to Ichiza, but the food was really good!  

Had the Katsu don which came out in a large bowl with a nice serving of katsu and plenty of rice.  We also ordered the fried bean sprouts and croquets to share among our party.  Fried bean sprouts were actually very tasty.  First time I've ever had something like that.  One of my friends had the mabo ramen he said he liked it but it was a little too salty.  

Waitress would rather talk to friends than take our order though.  However once we ordered everything came out rather quickly.  Would definitely go here to escape the crowds of the strip or ichiza.

4451525,2013-05-15,0,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"I came with a friend and a Restaurant.com gift certificate for $10. I was pretty excited to come here because I rarely eat Asian cuisines. Usually I am a pho person and nothing more, unless it's sushi, which sometimes in the good 'ol U. S. of A. you can't really even consider the type of sushi served actual sushi per Japanese standards. With the being said, launch into my review.

Food - My friend and I shared the Octopus Balls and the Poki. Immediately I was overtaken by the saltiness of the poki dish. Just too much. Octopus balls were a nice treat and actually had a decent amount of meat in them

Both my friend and I ordered the Tan Tan Men Ramen. This was my first time having ramen. I thought it was decent. The noodles were good, but it wasn't too spicy to me anyway, until I happened to get a bit of the broth in my eye. Yes, go me. Broth in the eye. Overall the taste was not totally satisfactory, but I don't have much to go off of. I believe now I will branch out and try some ramen elsewhere, just to see how Shuseki's stacks up.

Service - Meh, meh, meh. Although our server arrived to our table quickly to take our orders and bring food he was non-existent for most of the time. My water glass sat unfilled for quite awhile while I was really wanting some water. 

My Restaurant.com GC was met with some speculation when we were ready to pay our bill. I was just getting ready for a confrontation, but then the server whisked away my debit card and the GC. When he came back he had charged my debit card an additional $4.43 for ""included tip"" which I was not told would be included. Um, what? We were only a part of two. Pretty sure the ""tip included"" part came because we had used the gift certificate. If it's the restaurant's policy to include tip along with gift certificate's they should include that on the GC. But my GC said nothing of a tip being included and I've used Restaurant.com quite a bit and I have never had this happen to me before.

The $4.43 tip was annoying and the fact that they did not bother to tell me I would be charged a tip prior to running my card was even more annoying. It is not okay to charge someone more just because you feel like it and especially if there is nowhere on the menu, in the restaurant, or on my GC that says I will be charged.

Considering I *was* going to leave a tip for $5 the server got shorted. I'm guessing the restaurant does this because they might assume people who use gift certificates may leave poor tips. I am not one of those people and I think it's poor business to assume everyone who comes through your door are cheap-asses. Also, if Shuseki put out the gift certificates they are obviously trying to get business in the door. Unfortunately for them and their assumptions regarding myself - I will not be back.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,1,2,8JHyFxMMgH8tXasfCPeYGw
4470099,2013-03-06,0,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"This restaurant was very difficult to find.  It was located before you enter the parking garage of the Pacific Asian Plaza on W Spring Mountain Road/S Decatur Blvd in Las Vegas.  Even when I entered the restaurant, I wasn't sure I was in Shuseki.  The name wasn't on the menu, only on the chopsticks.

I placed the Restaurant,com coupon on the table before I ordered, The menu was full of photos.  There were quite a few Korean appetizers on the menu.  I ordered the Potstickers and the Small Assorted Sashimi.

The server leaned over the 3 foot tall wooden banister to deliver a glass of water and 2 small dishes rather than walking around the banister.

Within 10 minutes of walking in, the server leaned over the banister again to put the Small Assorted Sashimi on my table.  There were 3 slices of salmon, 3 slices of hamachi, and 3 slices of tuna on a bed of shredded daikon on a plate.  The tuna was artificially colored red.  The hamachi had some pieces of skin on it.

I saw the sushi chef sit down at the bar and watch the basketball game after he cut my fish.  There was a school-age girl wandering around the restaurant.  She was playing with a plastic cup behind a glass partition.

The server leaned over the banister again and delivered the Potstickers.  There were 6 potstickers on a plate.  No garnish.  No dipping sauce.  Eating the potstickers was like biting into a Xiao Long Bao dumpling.  There was so much liquid/grease in each bite.

I asked the server for the check.  The Restaurant,com coupon was still on the table.  She cleared the table without taking the coupon.  She returned with the bill.  Just as I suspected, the discount was not taken off.  She recalculated the bill, crossed out the total, and told me the tip was already included.  No where on this coupon did it say an 18% gratuity would be added.  That was the icing on the cake.

4484302,2010-03-26,0,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"Last week my husband and I chose a random new restaurant to try, which happened to be in the same Chinatown strip mall as a few other places we like to go (Hue Thai, Penang, and Provence Bakery). The name of the Japanese restaurant is Shuseki and we were thrilled to make the discovery since from the street you wouldn't see it nestled in southwest corner of the first floor. Though the decor is unexciting and kind of tacky with amateur pictures of specials on the wall, our hostess/waitress was polite and efficient and we immediately felt comfortable. The first thing that appealed to me when we sat down was the layout of the menu, which has mini pictures of each dish so you know exactly what you're getting. I love to be adventurous in ordering, but it's always great to know you'll be spending money on something you'll enjoy. Also, because the pictures are small, it is easy enough to look at every dish so you can make your selection amongst the 179 items.

Since they have a sushi bar we decided to order hamachi sashimi to see how fresh their fish was. The sashimi ($7.99 for 5 pieces) was not the best I'd ever had, but it was certainly fresh and had a subtle but good flavor. The rolls all looked pretty drab and mainstream, so we decided against ordering any of them, even though the prices were reasonable. After the sashimi we had two dishes prepared in a way I had previously thought was only done at Raku, the authentic and superb Japanese restaurant down the street. These were what I like to call ""Japanese tapas,"" or mini items that are cooked on a robata grill. We had the Bacon and Asparagus (#64, $1.50) and the Korobuta Sausage (#67, $1.50), both of which were excellent and a terrific value. Though the selection of items like these isn't as wide as it is at Raku, the prices are lower and the quality is comparable.

The real show stopper of the meal was the Spicy Pork Miso Ramen soup (#151, $7.99). This soup was so richly flavored and delicious (yet still light) that we found it nearly impossible to put down our spoons. The spicy ground pork, miso, and ample sprinkling of sesame seeds enhanced the broth tremendously, and the bean sprouts, scallions, and coddled egg gave added texture. The noodles added another dimension, and were fresh and chewy (not at all overcooked). Ramen noodles are wheat based noodles, which I personally prefer to rice noodles because they can stand up to the temperature of a big bowl of hot soup for a longer period of time. In my opinion, they also taste better. This soup was the best I've had in a long time, and ranks up there in comfort with my mom's chicken matzo ball soup. Unlike Jewish penicillin, however, this soup has some heat, which is great for clearing your nostrils of all the nasty pollen this time of year. If you are not a spice lover, they have seven other kinds of ramen to choose from, as well as four kinds of udon. I can't vouch for any of these, but based on what we had I'd be willing to try any of them.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,1,1,4,7fYt-RFxSKoRNDxPzRmG1Q

To top off the slowness we ordered a honey toast about 15 min before everyone was about done and it took them an additional 15 to finally serve it to us.

The tonkotsu ramen was ok.  There was a chunk of tough pork in the middle of the pot which I decided to avoid after gnawing on the first bite for a minute.

The karage was a bit soggy which made me sad because that crunch is just as important as the flavor to me.

Vegetable tempura was ok. I wish I could tell you about the shrimp but it never showed up.

Here's what we had:

Vegetable tempura -- your standard tempura with dipping sauce but no grated daikon for the sauce

Agedashi tofu -- again, standard, wasn't the best I've ever had, but the young man liked it well enough

Buta-kimchi -- wow, hardly any kimchi at all and only about 5 pieces of buta -- but very large pieces. I like the one at Ichiza a whole lot better!

Spinach in sesame dressing -- this was delicious!! I could've had 3 orders of this with rice.

Grilled rice ball -- hmmm, they sure give you a huge ball but it wasn't grilled nicely -- didn't have the crunch on the outside, in fact, it was just like a regular onigiri. Nice flavor though, but I would've been happier had it been 2/3 the size and grilled more.

OKAY, so this was all we ordered (2 rice balls) plus a bowl of rice and edamame, 2 glasses of beer.... our total was like over 50 bucks! I thought it was kinda pricey for what we got!

5049588,2010-07-04,4,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"Yelpalicious Dishes. Came to top off the night with some of my Yelpies and the BF. 

Suggested this place since theres small plates and big, a little something for everyone, and it's fairly quiet so we can just hang out after feeling rushed out of DCR. 

I was curious about their ramen so the BF and I shared the House Ramen, Omelette Rice and got two yakitori sticks: chicken heart and kurobuta sausage.

Chicken Heart- Nom and nicely seasoned. Sausages were tasty with a great snap to the skin and a sticky,char to the outside...me loves.

The ramen bowl was huge. Holy cow I thought it was going to be a decent portion, but not that big. If we knew, we could have happily shared this and be stuffed. We left quite a bit in the bowl, simply because it was a lot more food than we can eat.  Had sliced pork, boiled egg, seemed like sliced king mushrooms, and julienne veggies that were tempura style. This was not bad at all of a soup base, not as salty as most bases go, but a nice take..milder, but not bland. I liked all the toppings but specially appreciated the crunchy tempura veggies. The key with the veggies though is to have a small plate on the side (or ask for them on the side) and put them on there or they'll sog into the broth and are a lot better crispy. The pork is sliced thicker, not deli thin here. 

Oooh omelet rice how I love your simple goodness. Out of all the items most people who don't know would probably skip this, but let me tell you that other than me, you'll see a lot of Japanese kids order this late at night.  Firstly, the egg is mad fluffy and soft the way it should be, some of the best cooked egg while eating out (this includes breakfast places) . Then the rice is in a tomato base with pieces of pork and little veggie pieces like peas, corn, etc and are cooked well that the veggies and meat have a slight crunchy char to them. Then on top is a squirting of ketchup. I was full but I found myself still finishing up the little bits. It's one of those things that the wow is in how something hits that comfort spot and how something so normal can be done well instead of the bells and whistles. 

Everyone seemed satisfied with their food and we were able to take our time and just hang out, and talk. After our First Friday in the hot, hot, heat and our DCR rush we just needed a place to relax and not be bothered. 

Just a cultural note, if you're hanging out at a izakaya style place, out of respect they never hassle you to leave or bring you the check on their own accord.Many people hang out for a long while and even sit with empty plates to have a second wind of plates or dessert at this kind of place.  It's very disrespectful to assume one is done or want more food so don't think you're being slighted because they see you're done, but haven't brought you a check or asked if you want more. It's just one of those things you have to ask so they know for sure if youre done or want to order more. Speak up and you'll have a great time. 

This is one of those late night places I like, not because it's one of the few late night choices and/or I am inebriated enough to not care, I come because I think it's good food and has a comfortable atmosphere. Now that they have the lunch bentos, I definitely got to make a try for it.  ...though it seems that the night staff has better service by the looks of reviews and what friends tell me. 

Even though most times it is a 4 star kind of night here I will give them 5 stars for having grown to become a favorite by being consistent with their food (ordered some same items a few times now and each time has been right on and not ever worse than the last visit ) and friendly,  polite and attentive staff.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,6,7,5,yfc_QxGTqawpq6BXhfEkhA

As a person who doesn't enjoy eggs, I was skeptical about eating rice wrapped inside of an omelet. After the first bite, it was game over- I can't say I don't enjoy eggs anymore considering we both come back to Shuseki like fiends! The other dishes that we've tried were the katsu curry, Japenese lasagna, a couple of the ramen and udon bowls. I love that they're open til late (which was awesome when you're shift ends at 11pm) and the service there is pretty on point! (I love Jennifer and Ryan) The only reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is that I think its weird that they have Christmas decorations all year long and because there was an incident when part of the ceiling fell down.. they've fixed that though!",xz81pPXEuon4-7yRg2ptDQ,2,2,4,i4qcLy-Ty5ahpi-efyGlqw
5199090,2010-04-01,12,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"You know Raku and Ichiza, dah-duh and dah-buh, but do you recall, the most forgotten izakaya and yakitori joint of all? Shuseki the red-walled restaurant... Okay, I can't carry on the Rudolph parody; it's straining my brain and my corny-bone. 

We ventured over to Shuseki last night because we were ready to give the underdog a fightin' chance, and I must say that if the place were a little cuter and a bit less fluorescent-lit, it would be giving Ichiza a run for its Japanese small-plate money. The interior is simply not the most comfortable. I have been trying to figure out what it reminds me of, but the best I can come up with is that it looks like Frank from Trading Spaces did a rework. Frank is a nice man, but he himself describes his style as ""eclectic country,"" and that can never be good. So, imagine that Frank showed up and built some Longhorn looking booth structures, painted the walls red, and then hot-glued some bamboo sticks here and there: that is a pretty good visual.

The menu is extensive with lots of small plates, grilled fish, noodle dishes, tempura, sushi and soups (and I am probably missing something). We both had soup: a spicy pork ramen and a veggie tempura udon. The spicy ramen broth was flavorful without inching into being salty. The udon soup flavor was also delicious; however, the tempura upset me because it was julienned vegetables. That's right: little thin slices of tempura vegetables put on top. Perhaps it is more traditional, but I had never seen that. It was a little frustrating because the pieces were hard to fish out despite my very respectable chopstick skills, and before I could fish them out, all of their tempura breading had sogged up and fallen into the broth. This scenario made the broth a little greasy. When I did catch one, it tasted great, but I would really liked to have had some nice full pieces of tempura. 

Still, the overall dish sure beat some other offerings I have had around town, and I am eager to try some of their small plates. So, on one foggy Sin City night, I'll definitely say: Shuseki with your menu so bright, won't you feed my belly tonight.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,10,4,NfnapqQ_mDSdQM86uOWEKw

They have the entire menu available for lunch (Ichiza only has a small menu of 15 or so items), and honestly it's bigger and to me had a better atmopshere. Additionally the service was WAY better.. no comparison. I have yet to try this place for dinner.

We tried the pork ramen, fried rice, gyoza, and a rice ball. All were excellent and prices were on par if not a little cheaper than Ichiza. The ""burnt"" rice ball was the highlight, the gyoza filling was probably the biggest let down (not much flavor).

5320622,2011-07-15,1,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"Shuseki is a very authentic Japanese restaurant located in the corner of the smaller china town plaza just off Spring Mt. and Decatur. The first impression you get when you walk in is one of authenticity and culture for this place is decorated very old fashion Japanese style. There are mostly wooden booths in this restaurant with high backrests and mats for seating. The servers greet you with traditional greetings upon walking in and they even bow their heads. They will also bring you complimentary hot green tea upon request, which to me is a lot better than water. 
As for their menu, it is rather extensive. They carry bento boxes, to finger foods and sushi rolls. If you've never tried their udon, you're missing out. Their shrimp tempura udon is my absolute favorite. The broth is sweet and smells of onions and shrimp. It has seaweed, fish cakes and two large tempura shrimp in it. The shrimp is chewy on the inside with a crunchy exterior. When soaked in the broth, it makes the flavors irresistible. You must try it with their Japanese chili pepper. It will add a mild spice to your soup that gives you the perfect amount of heat mixed with sweet. The broth taste almost similar to the tempura sauce you get when you order it alone, but less concentrated. 
Another thing that is amazing there would be their whole grilled squid. It is grilled with ginger on the side and marinated with sweet soy. It is topped with scallions and literally taste like butter when you bite in. The squid tastes best with their sweet mayonnaise. I like putting the ginger into the mayo and dipping the squid in it. Its crunchy to the bite yet melts in your mouth...This makes my mouth water every time.
The price range for both of this is about $6.95 and pretty much everything on their menu is just as cheap. Now if you don't want to spend so much, then get their mapo tofu with rice. It is an appetizer dish and is only $5. The tofu is made with minced pork in a sort of gravy consistency. However, it is so spicy, so beware. If you eat it with rice, the combination will perfectly balance itself out.

Overall, I definitely recommend Shuseki to anyone who wants Japanese food with quality Japanese hospitality and service.",3HXyXpdkH1rNAEEaSxQucw,1,2,4,gqa8QRmOAv-Y7_DeW6OKVA
5373033,2011-02-27,1,i7__R4dmGUayzNB939Zm0A,"I must be a masochist, because I always seem to get awful service, but keep going back. After a night of drinking, there is nothing better than going to the Chinatown area for food. 

An overwhelming craving for ramen lead my friends and I to Shuseki despite our complaints. The tantan and miso ramen are amazing. The tantan ramen is a spicy ground pork base soup with bamboo strips, bean sprouts, and half a boiled egg. The yolk is always cooked perfectly, where it is a bright and vibrant yellow. The miso is just as delicious. The broth is so good that I ignored my friend chastising me about filling up on soup and downed it.  The tonkatsudon is a great deal. A thick pork cutlet served over rice filled up my normally insatiable food partner. We also ordered the mixed tempura, which was served piping hot and crisp. It was worth it because it consisted of yellow bell pepper, pumpkin, asparagus, onion, potato, and shrimp. We also got the Japanese pizza, but it was not a big hit with our group. The benito shavings on top overwhelmed all the other flavors and by the time it came out, we were all full.

The thing about Shuseki's service is that it is hit or miss. You should not expect anything to come out in any certain order. An appetizer might come out at the end of your meal and your ramen might be the first. I have to hand it to the waitress tonight. She understood that a bunch of drunk ass fools need to stay hydrated and refilled our waters in a timely manner.

Not the best japanese food but definitely, definitely worth the price. I even stop by once in a while just to eat their tempura ice cream (yuuummmy!). Quality has definitely gone down in the last year or so but I can't really complain too much, it's still worth trying and eating at. You still get more than you pay for. 

The only thing that really bothers me is that about a year ago there were two separate occasions where me and my girlfriends had a roach crawl over the banister and almost got on the table. Now, I'm a tomboy. Love taratulas, lizzards, pet rats, etc. I rarely squeal in fright, but I am an absolute pansy when it comes to roaches and I especially do not like seeing them in restaurants that I eat at. I have not seen anymore since then, so I am not sure if it was just a temporary problem, but even just thinking of it give me the chills. I hate roaches that much.

All in all, the price will get you more than you pay for and is still tasty. Though I have had a couple roach sighting over a year ago I have never gotten any food poisoning or an upset stomach to indicate that the place is not safe to eat.

I agree with Charlie L. that their beef udon is amazing. Simple but done so well.

Some of my other favorites there is the Saba (grilled fish), the Agedashi Tofu (fried tofu- it's very light and silky), and any of their tempura items!

So let's start with what matters: THE FOOD. Well, of course by now you should know I already think it's great. Ramen is superb, sushi is fresh, selection is GREAT, their menu is very user-friendly (they have small pics of each numbered dish), AND it is one of the few places I have come to find that serves OKONOMIYAKI -- one of my favorites. 

Service is always very friendly and courteous, though sometimes a liiiitle slow (and it's not busy) . I have never seen it busy in here so that's good for no wait time for a table and the establishment is fairly large so it's nice and roomy.

This is a similar concept to Ichiza, but with more ramen and sushi options.  I can only rate this for the izakaya items and ramen, since I haven't tried the sushi.  

Pros: 
1. Large bowls of ramen
2. 1/2 orders of ramen available
3. Pretty tasty takoyaki and chicken karaage
4. Lunch specials (1/2 ramen+gyoza or fried rice)

Cons:
1. The noodles are somewhat overcooked and often the tempura elements in the soup are already completely soggy when they arrive at your table....
2. Soup is slightly bland (the tan tan (spicy) ramen is tastier than the house ramen)
3. Takoyaki is missing the dancing bonito flakes on top....one element that is essential to legit takoyaki in my opinion.  

I don't know if I would choose to come here, but my co-workers don't like waiting for a table...so we end up here.   Service is quick, since there generally are not too many diners in the restaurant.  I'd say the better bets are Ichiza (but they have a limited lunch menu...so wait for dinner) or tough it out in the Monta line since it moves pretty quickly.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,0,0,3,u9QEs3lc4Iz8FQSJS6Tsug

Whenever we would have friends come visit us in Las Vegas, we would always head out to Shuseki for late night dinner.  It was usually what our friends were looking forward to doing when they came out.

The menu is written in Japanese so it's a good thing they have pictures for every item.  We always ended up getting the same things every time so we got used to order them.  Definitely order the potato croquettes, they are one of my favorites, and just be adventurous.  The items on the menu are usually pretty cheap so we would order a ton of food family style for the table and just have the server start bringing it out as it was ready.

The service is probably the worst part of Shuseki.  It's really hard to get your drink refilled and the servers are usually running around so much that it's hard to get their attention for anything.  If you really need something, you have to really have to flag somebody down.

We ended up ordering several dishes but all I remember was the one I ordered that night. Curry over rice and udon is common usually but I've rarely seen curry over ramen. So that caught my eye.

Yes, it usually only happens when they are not crowded, and by not crowded I mean that only 2-3 tables are occupied.

Even though my Dad is 100% Japanese, he does not speak the language since his family came to America in the 1800s. So, my Dad was like: ""what the f*ck are you trying to say to me?"". And then the  old man informed him that he could only eat for 40 minutes and then have to leave... but he did not say this to any of the ""western"" customers. I didn't believe this story when my Dad told it to me because I thought it was exaggerated. My Dad tends to talk a lot of sh!t on people and pick fights so I assumed the old man had to have asked him to leave on account of his bad behavior. Well, in the last 2 months I had a conversation with my favorite Japanese sushi chef and he told me the exact same story. The old man had singled him out for being Japanese and given him a time limit. This makes me believe that Ichiza is trying to market themselves towards ""western"" customers, and they really don't wanna see our faces there anymore. You won't get sh!t like that at SHUSEKI.  

 I have probably eaten at SHUSEKI more time then I have eaten at Fukumimi, Monta, Sora, and Anime all combined. Mainly because they are happy to  stay open when I show up after midnight. I work 12-16 hour days and usually SHUSEKI is the only Ramen-Ya still open after 11PM. We all hate how Japanese businesses usually close very early....but, SHUSEKI is actually owned and operated by an ethnically Chinese resident of Japan, so he is willing to allow his business to open later.  

When you walk into SHUSEKI, you will most likely recognize a person eating here who works for another Japanese Restaurant.  The evil old man from Ichiza frequents this place. The girls at INABA can be seen here. The legendary Hiro-San(the former fugu sushi chef who is semi-retired and working at Sushi on Rainbow now) can also be found here and he actually tells me that this is his favorite Ramen-Ya.  So, it does tend to be popular amongst the LV Japanese community even though they see it as a Chinese restaurant. 

Because this place is operated by an ethnically Chinese man who was born and raised in Japan, it's gonna have Tan Tan Men on the menu. The Tan Tan Men here at SHUSEKI is more of a Chinese style with a miso broth.  At Los Angeles Ramen-Yas they would actually have this on the menu as ""Tan Tan Style Ramen"" instead of Tan Tan Men. 

Well, I guess due to some of the negative comments by yelpers, the cook here at SHUSEKI has decided to modify the Tan Tan Men a bit.  I'm a little disappointed because some days I'm actually in the mood for a more traditional Chinese variation. 

I like the service here.  Ryan is my personal favorite worker. If he is working, he will make sure you get your ramen the way you want it. For example, Ryan can actually get the cooks to make me a bowl of Ramen that is so spicy that I just can't finish it. Last time he made me a Spicy Miso that was hotter than Orochon's. He also can get the cook to make the noodles more firm or soft depending on your preferences.  
The girls who work the late night shift are really nice, but tend to be on the super shy side. Unfortunately, only Jen and Ryan speak perfect English and it's difficult to communicate with the other workers. 

My recommendation is to get the Tan Tan Ramen with a side of Karage and Gyoza. Why? Because I command you to do so...",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,15,12,5,WD64Fcag3QEcfgJQQ6l9qQ
