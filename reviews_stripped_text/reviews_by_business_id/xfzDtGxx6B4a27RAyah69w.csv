We ordered 3 cut rolls and one of them came back as a hand roll. One of the rolls was drenched in sauce ( and there's nothing like a soggy roll). The second roll the fish did not seem fresh (my breath was kickin'). To top it off while finishing the last roll the chopsticks broke (not cool). 

Note: We were the only people there and our food took forever and maybe that's why our rolls were soggy. To add on the service was not that great either.",oA_cyKMPIBsjgynv7ro1yg,0,0,1,_xNrr7CbwCpWLLWR-de7oQ

We ordered a teriyaki chicken dish, the middle pieces were literally raw... We show it the waiter, he agrees, takes the whole dish back. He comes back sometime later with the same dish with the same chicken cooked. The raw chicken was sitting on a bed of cabbage n he re-cooked the chicken and put it on the same used plate. Unbelievable! 

Otherwise none of the dishes were that great...

We ordered a ""Popcorn Lobster""roll... It was almost $20 for this roll... Would be a fair price if we had actually gotten lobster, however, we got some nasty crawfish bites that were fried...

This place is awesome.  

Fresh fish, imaginative menu items, and friendly service.  A totally solid, surprisingly high quality spot to get FRESH sushi in the middle of the desert - at a REASONABLE price!  ;)

The ONLY reason I had to give it 4 stars instead of 5 was because the menus and table were kinda grimy/sticky.  Not really dirty - just seemed like maybe the sanitizer solution was a little old or heavy when the tables and menus were wiped so they weren't dry and were getting a little filmy.  I would only take half a star off for it if I could - it was a little ambiance lowering and kind of made me leery about how the food would be - but it was great!

The reviews seemed great so we tried it out. We sat down and ordered and the first thing I asked for was a side of yuzu sauce because I do not like/use soy sauce because of health reasons. They told me no that I couldn't have it because it's too expensive.  Too expensive I asked? Ok, so can you charge me for a side of it? They said no, but brought me a very small side of it, enough to dip three pieces of sushi in.  Not a normal amount like you would in a normal soy sauce dipping tray.  When I asked for more, they all of a sudden ran out.  We then ordered the yuzu yellowtail off the menu and lone behold more yuzu sauce appeared.  All of our sushi rolls came out, with the thinnest pieces of cut sushi I have personally ever had.  They were basically just rice rolls.  This is not what I call sushi. This restaurant should be called Rice Rolls 21 not Sushi 21. We should have just gone with our first Yelp review which was Sushi House Goyemon. They had awesome sushi and great service!

As my boyfriend was at a conference close by we had to reside in The Orleans Casino for the week...We were so sick of the bad food on site that we ventured further afield. A quick search on-line and we found this place a 5 min walk away. The in-house sushi restaurant in The Orleans is overpriced and not very good...How happy we were we found this place and so reasonable too. For those of you staying in The Orleans you are mad not to check this place out. I also commend Sushi 21 for their notice about fish sustainability...Bluefin Tuna will probably be extinct soon and they are actively promoting other varieties and not stocking Bluefin anymore. I'm not sure people really understand how much in peril the ocean fish stocks are. Hopefully Sushi 21 will raise awareness of this serious environmental issue.",YxTLJfOmU2vFdgMn8x1P0g,2,2,5,LBGjwTvaPyEx1ki_TH4Nlw

Sushi and appetizers were fresh and delicious. Great variety of special rolls so it was easy to branch out and try new rolls that I normally wouldn't. Everything we tried today though, was spectacular! 

Service was very quick and staff was nice and attentive. Made me feel very welcome and refilled our drinks and took our old plates before we could finish saying thanks! Very fast!

Atmosphere in here was great too! Went during lunch so it was relatively quiet, though I'm sure they get very busy during dinner. There was a projection of k-pop music as we enjoyed our rolls. Fun music and inviting atmosphere.


We'll definitely come again! Great food, good prices for AYCE. If you're in the area, and you're hankering for some good sushi, come to Sushi 21!",Xf64inF86ar3z8PqNuKbJA,0,0,5,YCQXTw4RvdFUs1sTSRrlgg

They give you a list to check off what you want, and we told them we wanted two lists, but they'd only give us one. They kept bringing out only what two of us ordered, and the other two wound up sitting and waiting, because we'd order stuff they didn't want. They only brought two rolls at a time, and we'd wait anywhere from 10-45 minutes for the next roll. We never got everything we ordered, and every time we'd tell a waitress we were still waiting on rolls, she'd just nod yes. There was a huge language barrier and when we asked to talk to the manager, she didn't understand what we were telling her. Everyone went home hungry and wound up eating at home. 

Also when it came time to get the check? Somehow our 4 all you can eats, with 4 drinks totaled to $150, they totally overcharged us AND added an 18% gratuity for our table, nowhere in the establishment does it say that gratuity is charged for parties of 4.",-lnV2uuxpVV-QD9loWO6AQ,0,0,1,CpGJ_NkTJQGxjXonhWzCrg

435770,2015-03-20,0,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"I have been a fan of AYCE Sushi since I escaped Makino. I cannot speak bad about Makino seeing as that was the 1st place my best friend took me to that got me started enjoying it.  I will never go back because raw fish sitting out cannot be healthy!  Having said that, some people question these AYCE Sushi joints for the same thing, and I have seen some things that were not good. But I see things wrapped that aren't being used, food kept at excellent temperatures, and nothing is ever left out!  I have walked out of another place and left my stamp card behind to tell them I would NOT be returning. As a cabbie who actually cares about my riders,  and who happens to be a ""non-Strip"" food fanatic,  and who happens to be rather large,  I like taking guests to food havens and looking at the faces of full and happy customers.  21 does it very well. The fact that it's not in Chinatown makes it an easier drive (J/K). You can also have sashimi   at dinner.  BTW if you need a driver that 1. Speaks English 2. Is 100% Honest 100% of the time.  3. Has a personality and is funny.  4. Knows a lot about this crazy town (history and food. I may not know ALL the clubs because they change almost weekly ) 5. My #1 concern is the safety of my customers.  Both on the road and in situations where people get ripped off.  Vegas is a fun place but some people target good people who may make drunken choices.

Ok, overall - service was just ok despite there only being a couple of tables to wait on. The sushi menu is huge though, over 50 types of specialty rolls. We sampled the gyoza/edamame and both were quite good. I was lukewarm on my specialty roll - if it weren't swimming in ponzu I'd have probably liked it more. The spicy salmon roll was better, for me anyway.

I'd come again to try some of their other funky rolls, but I wouldn't go out of my way to.",y7YskWeE1yRHwRcT3GvsYw,0,0,3,V--uQXLtuNTofOCI-0mzOw

Being that my husband and I came from a trip to Tokyo not that long ago it is the next best thing. In fact we came back the next day to eat more tuna nigiri and try their udon soups. It was as good as the first day.  If you want Japanese chef go to Japan where you might be surprised that not every sea urchin is fresh either.  One reviewer was taken by the sea urchin taste: when you are in the desert, what do you expect, a mini ocean in the back yard?

Quality: fresh and what it should be. However they do not put wasabi right away in nigiri. Rice was warm and not hard, in a perfect proportion to the amount of fish.

Atmosphere: it is not  a fancy restaurant but a pleasant one. Family, friends and dates  would feel comfortable there.

In my sushi rolls I like cream cheese, avacado, salmon or yellowtail. Our new chef now, Johnny, asked me what I like and I told him.

The table service is pretty inconsistent though. I have had AMAZING service (and make sure to let them know with a tip they did well) and then I've had some pretty awful service as well (sitting on an empty drink for 20 minutes, stacks of empty plates waiting to be taken away. I've even seen the chefs having to remind the waitresses to get the food and bring it to the table.) Soo....I gotta knock a star off for that.

Sashimi portions were generous and very tasty. I had mackeral, octopus and salmon. All were excellent. Best of all was their iced green tea. They use gunpowder green tea which is very flavorful and not cheap tea leaves.
I spent $102 for lunch for two people which obviously isn't cheap but I'm expensing it on the company so I didn't really care about price!

For appetizer, the Miso Soup is not too bad and the Golden Spoon is an interesting dish to try, but the Garden Salad was so tasteless and the greens weren't fresh. The raw sushi was decent in quality and freshness, my only critique is that the fish on nigiri was sliced too thin so it didn't satisfy me. The Ami Ebi (Sweet Shrimp) was actual really big in size compared to other restaurants and they at least serve Giant Clam, which many sushi restaurants having been serving lately. The Fresh Water Eel (Unagi) Nigiri was not made well, it was extremely cold when it's supposed to be warm, it was drenched in eel sauce, and there was a lot of rice. There were three people doing sushi at the bar and the sushi that came from the main chef was more impressive than the sushi made by the other two chefs who looked like young teenagers.

Over the last few months,  though, quality and service has steadily declined. As such, tonight may have been the last time we dine at Sushi 21. 

It took us 10mins before I could flag down the two waiters working the near empty restaurant. I think they must've felt bad because after I got their attention, it was relatively smooth.

Despite the service, I would be okay with the place if their food was something to write home about. This isn't the case. Fresh oysters were served at room temp; literally almost every piece of nigiri sushi was on top of a piece of lemon; the rice either had too much sushi su or something like yuzu. Almost seemed like they were hiding bad fish quality.  Even the cooked foods like the mini beef steak was off somehow. Best I can describe it the meat had a strange consistency with a slightly sour taste.

To top off this great dining experience, half the kitchen staff blanketed the entrance with cigarette smoke when we left.  I could've opened up my mouth to mask all the citrus I ate at dinner.",ld6Y4P4lntLEgMvVe81-2A,0,0,2,1wkgsGPFnUfQnOdbZ5MbkQ

I used to live a block (or so) away from this place, and ate here (or grabbed take out) sometimes three times a week.  Loved it. LOVED it!

The prices were fantastic, very affordable, especially given the quality of the food.  Damn good!

The service...always friendly, though communication was often limited.  There was the occasional cash register dilemma...usually with a new server who didn't quite have the hang of it...but whatever, i was gonna be waiting anyway, no worries.

My favorite sushi chef was a blonde-dyed guy who would only give his name as ""Josh.""  That's cool, man.  My name was still Robert, and our high fives were many and heart-felt.  Your skills were finely honed, your humor genuine, and your creative flair MUCH appreciated by this humble diner.

Whether I was there alone or with a lady, when seated at the sushi bar I was always treated like a prince.  Never failed to be gifted with some special sushi treat, a custom concoction from Josh.  Yeah, my generous tips may have had something to do with this, but hell...how many times do generous tips just get absorbed into the gelatinous maw of the self-important?  My man appreciated the money, no doubt, but probably not as much as I appreciated his craft and attitude.

I had too many good meals here to go into specifics, and a lot of the rolls I had weren't even on the menu.  Suffice to say I never left disappointed, and even when doing take-out, everything was always very fresh and delicious.",4hs36fF3pr-qF0fLAfpxrw,4,3,5,2bNQ4ksNK4JZnOS_RfA0qg

1294164,2015-03-06,1,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"Good afternoon,

I have lived 2 blocks from Sushi21 for 10 years, and it has been my local restaurant. I have taken family and friends over the years and most have become regulars. 

For me that ended 2 days ago.

I was there with a friend, he has been going to Sushi21 for 5 years. We both order the ""All You Can Eat"" as it usually saves us a few dollars. My friend ordered a roll he couldn't eat, they charged him $10 on top of his AYCE price. 

Now I am not one of those people who expects discount because I have been going for years. I am however one of the people who continues to be loyal if the service is right and the food continues to be good.

This reflects a downgrade in service to me, and over the last 2 years the food has been going down. 

Example: there have been dishes that where supposed to be served hot that came to our table, well chilly... Normally the waitresses would have your green tea filled without you even having to ask. Lately you have to constantly remind them.

I started going there as it was close, I kept going there for the service, food and value. 

Now they have none.... Can't see going back, my friend either.

The best I've had is in anchorage Alaska.

This stuff WAS: fairly fresh.
What it was NOT:
Was complicated.
I am used to a complex medley of flavors in every bite.

We paid 92$ not including a tip, for two,people.

It was a 50$ meal, not 92$

I am used to spending 75-95 for a complicated orgasmic oral experience.

There was maybe three tables total, we sat at the bar. As soon as we sat, there happened to be a lady towards the back of the restaurant waiting for a take out order (thank god) I'm not one to shame, but her kids were screaming and hitting each other and crying. The mother then screamed and cussed back. Since there was only three tables in the whole place you can imagine how awkward this was and nobody did anything about it. They probably screamed for about 10 minutes. 

When things finally calmed down we were able to think and order some appetizers. The miso soup, spicy garlic edamame and corn cheese was really good! The Gyoza weren't anything special! We had the garlic tuna, shrimp, and yuzu yellowtail nigiri! Pretty delicious!! As for the rolls, I didn't get the ""wow"" factor. We actually ended up sending one back because their crunch roll wasn't anything like we were used too. 

I think the real winner here was the deep fried Oreo dessert. We truly do appreciate originality and that's something you don't typically see on an AYCE menu. 

The food was very hit or miss, but when it hit we loved it! Unfortunately, we decided before we had even left that we wouldn't be returning. Ultimately because of that screaming lady.",XnAR0_QuT4PZSacMxKNs4Q,0,0,3,sLx9ZkakvPbSQsC-LsH2Yw

This got to be my worst experience of AYCE sushi place ever in my life.

This place is own and run by Non-Japanese. 

Sushi were terrible! Service were terrible! Prices are terrible!!!

Don't go!!

There was seven of us that night. My friends was there first and told them that we wanted AYCE. I arrived 10 minutes later. We told them again. another 10 minutes later, we had to tell them one more times that we want AYCE. Finally 20 minutes later, this girl took the regular menu away and threw this paper to us and said ""just check mark next to the items we want"". 

Ok, I guess it's self service.

We decided not to order too much sushi and everything we order was going to be 7 orders for each one of us. We gotten each order of sushi every 5 minutes. (You have to understand that one order of sushi is two bites, two bites every 5 minutes is annoying) 

Half way through our orders, this rude younger girl came around again and asked us if we wanted anything else. We told her that we never got the rest of first round. She told us ""just wait"" and ""it's coming"". Ok....so we ordered a little more.

10 minutes later, we got all of the second round(salmom, yellowtail, and eel for the second time), but still........ half of the first round was not here. 

Most of the first round items are the expensive items. Spider hand roll, sea urchin(uni), sweet shrimp , makerel (saba) and snow crab. 

10 minutes went by again, no first round. We asked and got the same answer. Then we decided to order shrimp tempura. And we got ""fried shrimp"". Very disappointing. The ""fried shrimp"" was breaded with PANKO. This is just unbelievable.

After the shrimp disaster, we asked again about our first order. The rude girl finally tried to ask us what they were. By this time, it's almost one hour since we arrived. The kicker of the night is she elected to tell us that she is worried that we won't be able to finish and they are only going to give us the first round orders one at a time.

This is just MADNESS.

At the end, of course we did not get all of the food we want. We were too angry to deal with them, and we did not want them to spoil the night even futher. 

Of course they charged us mandatory 18% tip on the check after the sales tax. 

Of course the hot tea we have to beg for was not included. 

And of course nobody said ""thank you"" or ""goodbye"" to us after we just spent almost $40 a person for the wrost sushi ever.",ju3HIitwo4seyPGiZIc40w,5,0,1,x3ogY0IhGvH9ynt5ESYcwQ

We walked in and the restaurant was basically empty and so we sit and the waitress took our order . They forgot my baked mussels a couple of times that I asked and did I mention the quality of the food wasn't that good ? Idk it might be just me coming from Hawaii (with some of the freshest yummiest fish) to Vegas with some crappy not as fresh  quality fish but yeah the mussels tasted like over cooked really hard chewy mussles with some really bold sauce to cover it up . And the miso soup was SOO salty omg my mother couldn't even finish it because she said it was waaaay too salty for her . But the spicy poki was actually kinda good only cuz it was really spicy but to also add the fish was still extra chewy bleh . We also ordered a yum yum roll and that was pretty bland not as ""yum yum"" as I expected . The wonton soup though is good I'd recommend but the portion is SOO little you'll probably finish it in a couple of bites . Overall I wish I dined at goyemon tonight instead but it's always good to try new places and I can't say it was completely disgusting since it did fill me up so 2 stars because the customer service wasn't terrible but only 2 stars because $26 for a person for such low quality food is not agreeable to my standards",EYwvNonD5kUGGNRTGjAAHA,3,1,2,kVSo3SaeG4ZdyBlsGQIwoQ

The popcorn lobster roll might just be the most beautiful thing I've found in a sushi bar in a very long time.  It will have me coming back for more of its delicious fried beautifulness.  I think this is something that this bar can call its own - that it has actually created something I'd never tasted before at a sushi bar.  And I think that says a fair amount.

One of our favorites is Sugarfish, just to give you an idea of the quality we are used to. Sushi 21 has the staff and a cute location, but the chefs are definitely not what we had expected. The rolls were much smaller than at other restaurants and the tempura shrimp tasted as if it had been breaded with bread crumbs (!). It was strange to taste the albacore tuna with a liquidy garlic sauce on it and the eel was tasteless. The mussels were also covered in a clear liquidy garlic sauce rather than a spicy mayo mixture that normally accompanies baked mussels. My bfs rolls were smaller than he had preferred (philadelphia but the other I forgot) and he said that the quality was poorer than other sushi restaurants in the area.

The only reason I am leaving two stars is because the staff were courteous and the environment was pleasing, they also offer affordable ayce (but again, the quality of the food is lacking).",8YZr5uHehjZDrmry-0lYug,1,0,2,E1ie9iTa9V_mSdC7GDToug

Their menu is comprised of 81 items for entrees and 45 items for appetizers on the AYCE menu alone. There is absolutely no limit for how much you can order or ""Rounds"" as some places limit you by having 3 rounds of food. Pricing isn't bad either their lunch is 21.95 and dinner is 26.95 which is standard in California(where I am from). 

Personal recommendation would be the S.W.A.T roll and the Rattle Snake roll. Those two were definitely among my favorite with Eel in them. But they also have your usuals as every other place, but also have many other rolls and twists from a usual to spice it up a bit. There is Bound to be something on their menu you will LOVE. Another recommendation for my mushroom fans is the Mushroom Cap. It's a mushroom upside down with crabmeat topped with baked goodness.

I think the higher star ratings were so that people could take advantage of the check in deal, 10% off the bill if you show them your review on Yelp. Seems a bit fishy (haha) if you ask me. 

The reason why I came here was because I was craving a bento box. I chose the teriyaki chicken box and added a Japanese lasagna roll. The roll came out first, and it was meh. Japanese lasagna is my go-to roll at any sushi place. Many places fail to make it to my liking, this happened to be one of those places. Oh, before I go on, I ordered the iced green tea which sounded delicious and refreshing, but it tasted like fishy rice! Seriously, it tasted like a sushi roll. I thought I was trippin, but after a few sips I had to give it back. I quickly exchanged it for water and they told me they would take it off my tab which was nice. By the way my server was very nice and checked on me often, so I have no complaints about the service.

Anyway the bento box is huge and you won't leave hungry. It comes with your entree (teriyaki chicken) with veggies, rice, 4 pieces of a California roll, salad, and veggie tempura. Everything was just okay, I didn't care for the dressing on the salad, and I didn't care for the teriyaki sauce that came with the chicken. I like the tempura veggies, zucchini and sweet potato, yum!

For AYCE, you can pretty much order off the entire menu. Their special rolls were decent, nothing spectacular, still good. I had the salmon and white tuna sushi. It wasn't as fresh as I'd like it to be. Not that it wasn't fresh though. I just prefer it to be slightly colder when I bite into my sushi's. The ahi poke salad appetizer was good. Had a bit of a kick to it. People that enjoy spicy food may like that.

Service was decent. Although, our friends told us that the serve indicated we would receive a sake shot with ordering AYCE after 8pm. Well, we did not receive it. When we had asked the server, she said because it was busy they had to move the time to 9pm. Really? With at least 5 tables still empty and still plenty of chairs available for the bar area, that was busy? I don't think a small order of sake would make any difference in how busy a restaurant is. Because of that, they weren't a favorite in my opinion. We asked for separate checks, 3 bills. The bill for 2 people with gratuity included came out to be $72! They added $11 in gratuity. There was only 5 people dining. I always thought gratuity gets added on for a party of 6 or more, something 8 or more. I definitely wasn't pleased about it.

Paid my dues and left. I don't think I'll be making a stop here for sushi if I'm ever in the area.",xEfWrET-mCCeoN4dSOLwNQ,1,0,3,pDDwAc6ZheuIjm3hDWEHig

We told the waitress we were not going to eat the food because it looked and tasted bad. The sushi chef comes out, finds out about the situation and goes ""What the fuck!!!!!."" He kept asking us why we couldn't eat the sushi and did not take ""Because it tastes terrible"" as an answer. After we were done paying, the same chef followed us all the way to the door and started yelling in his own language and started throwing salt all around us. I know in some Asian countries they use salt for purification purpose, and therefore by throwing the salt around us he was treating us as ""bad luck.""

Before going vegetarian and even after I'd rate this place based on service - cleanliness and decor as your run of the mill sushi joint. It's not anything to run home to mom about but nothing terrifyingly awful that I'd tell you to stay away. 

It's just kind of there if you're hungry and it's open and available. 


Although -- the way they make the cucumber salad I must say is just very lazy. It's a pickled cucumber as opposed to the traditionally sliced and cut with dressing cucumber-- mucho disappoint.",8g-IA2xZoWkt2Ui4ThQ90g,0,1,3,by4AjJ1dZe9Lt-c5NQ6ihA

2231268,2015-03-09,1,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"I wanted to wait till I got home and in front of a computer to write this review. We've eaten at many sushi restaurants in Reno and other cities BUT, we have never eaten at a sushi house this good. 
Yes, you do get 10% off if you write a Yelp review but, they didn't check to make sure we wrote a review. It must be a service Yelp offers or the pop up coupon you get when you check in on Yelp wouldn't work. That's fine anyway, Yelp is one of the best ways to advertise and I would write a review one way or another.  
There are instructions on the AYCE menu so pay attention. There are certain items on the menu you can only order one of per person, but I own a bookkeeping service and can tell you restaurants run on a pretty slim margin. You can't blame them for not wanting waste. Also, if you do not eat all of your meal you will be charged regular price for that roll. 

I'll try to keep this short even though I could go on for a while. We were a party of 5 and we were hungry!  We were looking for something close to the condo and Sushi 21 was there. 
We were seated right away and ate easily over a dozen rolls and appetizers. We all agreed that every roll they brought was delicious. The edamami was hot, salted, and the freshest we've had. Yes, I know it was most likely frozen from the supplier BUT, the difference was that it didn't taste like it had been sitting in the steamer all day.
Second, the service was amazing. Never once did empty dishes sit on the table for longer than it took us to put the dish aside and start eating another roll. We asked for fresh wasabi which was brought out in short order and it was delicious! 
The oysters on the half shell were fresh but, could have used a little more in the way of accoutrements, like horseradish and lemon but, was served properly cut away from the shell and excellent with a spot of sriracha sauce. 
The tempura battered anything was delicious. The tempura was light, crispy, tasty, and we could tell the oil used was fresh. We had one order each of the ahi tuna, which was thin sliced served two ways.  There's mayonnaise sauce on each style but, one was spicier than the other and both ways were delicious.
Have I said ""delicious"" enough? No. 
This is a little gem off the strip, away from the tourist traps and we are so happy to have found it.  If only it was in Reno! 
The servers are friendly, QUICK and attentive.  We didn't have to wait long for anything. 
One thing I can say for sure, the sushi houses in Reno need to step it up.  Every sushi house we've eaten at, the tempura is either soggy, or tough, and tasteless and/or cooked in old oil. If the owners of Sushi 21 ever open a sushi house in Reno, we will have permanent reservations! This was the best sushi we have ever eaten.
This will be our first dinner stop next trip to Vegas! 
When in Las Vegas give Sushi 21 a try. I can't guarantee you will have as good of an experience as we had but, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy your meal.",fOQ1TXu28ipbSO5hrABh9w,1,2,5,F162fcRcmur0lny1vTu4fA

I trust my fellow yelpers and my friend Shayda had only positive things too say about it. Cool. New tradition take my roommate out for his birthday some AYCE sushi. 

I never knew they had great HH prices half off rolls and all you can drink for $10 added charge only if you get the AYCE. Right off the bat talk about making great first impression with the specials. I like dam already have reason too come back again. 

Talk about small place not too many booths, the sushi bar has nice amount of seating (two nice widescreens that can watch sports; one got too be close too 50' right on the corner and another smaller widescreen slightly off the side) though, and of all things even have tiny koi pound (more like baby size ones or look like but YES actual fish in it) interesting. More in the back area they have a projection screen type playing music videos and feels little more like asian club cause can hear the music good in the restaurant. Lot of stuff going on comes too the decor for such small place. Honest I kind of fan breaks up the traditional sense of sushi restaurant. 

The sushi ordered mostly nigiri that always given whenever I go AYCE style. I felt like ALL the fish I had was fresh, looked great, and tasted awesome. White Tuna, Hamachi, Albacore, Uni (not fresh; so took it for what is worth OK), scallops not what I expected or say am use too, Salmon, Cajon Albacore, and Unagi. My roommate birthday boy ordered two rolls tried both. Nothing wow factor so not remember what it was. I ordered spicy yellow tail hand roll. It was one of my favorite sushi the whole night. They don't really list hand roll on the menu more cut it up rolls. The sushi chef was great not problem at all. The only thing that feel like lack for five star is diversity comes too the menu. Unlike my only five star comes too sushi goyemon they offer more different cuts of fish, special menu with bunch of grill items, and diversity. 

The service was fabulous! We were constantly being checked up on. Too drinks never even had chance too get half empty before asked if needed refill. The sushi chef was very friendly. Awesome! Nothing worst sitting at sushi bar the sushi chef stay all stuck up. Sushi 21 if want football (MNF style)  no worries about being packed getting your fill in. We sat front and center too the tv the whole game. Winnah! It always helps that not only is it so close too goyemon no worries about it being packed. But it always nice second option if line too long just being down the road.

Oh and we ordered a few things that never came out but I'm thankful for the mistake since the nigiri pieces are thin, the rolls are drenched in one sauce or another so the rice is soggy and most of the hot food was over cooked (popcorn lobster & baked aka crispy mussels).

Hunnie Bunnie got her Edamame and Japanese Udon Noodles which she enjoyed.
This is what I ordered:

Baked Green Mussels - these were really good, whatever sauce/toppings they put on I really liked and they were served nice and warm.

Calamari rings - crispy breading and served with a spicy dipping sauce. Not bad at all.

Soft Shell Crab - small soft shell crab, split right in half. Good stuff. I love sscrab!

Lettuce Wraps - they were out of this item!!! I really wanted to try these cuz it involved pork belly :-( Next time!!

Tuna Poki Salad - this was aiight. I've definitely had better. It's some kind of different sauce they put on and I think the spiciness of the sauce overwhelms the flava

Screaming Orgasm - not enough sashimi but lots of daikon

Yellowtail Jalapeno - they put sriracha on the jalapenos. I usually LOVE sriracha but i didnt care for it on this dish. And i wasnt really a fan of the sauce they used for this sashimi plate.

Tuna, Yellowtail, Salmon, Super White Tuna Nigiri - SO good! This fish tates SOOO fresh and melt in your mouth! Nicr size cut of fish and a small serving of rice accompanies it. REALLY REALLY GOOD! I had given up on AUCE sushi because the fish just didnt taste that good to me anymore but this place changed my mind! 

Scallop: It's mixed with something, crab mix maybe, and not tasty at all.

Sweet Shrimp - I actually only ordered this so I could eat the fried shrimp heads. Nom. And to think I never ate them before... The shrimp itself wasnt very good but the heads were tasty!

They also had a saki buy 1 get on 50% off style happy hour which included my husbands soju, so he was very happy about that. He said it was the absolute best soju he'd ever had.

The inside is kind of pop-Japanese style with traditional elements mixed with LCD screens playing Japanese boy-band videos the whole time. A cool distraction. I've mostly eaten here in the middle of the day, as opposed to the evening.

Seeing as though we were ravenous an hour wasn't going to cut it. This place was the exact opposite of Sushi House Goyemon with only a few patrons. At least I wasn't bored since the guy next to us was apparently a pimp trying to hire the girl he was with to his escort service. It was quite entertaining to hear him talk about his business as though it was a Fortune 500 company. I almost expected him to say, ""we offer all our ho's 401ks too"". Ok this was totally off topic but it was much more interesting than what Sushi 21 tried to offer in terms of food. The iced tea tasted like mop water but seeing as though I was tired and not in the mood to quibble with waitress, I tolerated it. We ordered the gyoza as an appetizer and it was decent but not special. I ordered the #4 Spicy Crabmeat Roll and the #20 Roxy Roll. The Spicy Crabmeat was very underwhelming and I left half of it on the plate. A sushi chef messing up something as simple as a crabmeat roll is like a pastry chef messing up a batch of cookies. The Roxy Roll was the complete opposite however. This delightful roll saves this place from a dubious 2 stars. One of the best speciality rolls I have had anywhere. I would definitely hit this roll up again. Despite the ho hum experience here I would be willing to go back but probably never will.

They have an unbeatable price for lunch, while still being very competitive at diner time. They will provide you with wonderful appetizers and fresh looking nigiris!!!

Located at Tropicana Avenue near by the Strip, this restaurant is a great destination for you and friends to try it out. I would recommend going for their All you can eat special and then ordering some appetizers first, moving on to some salads and finally ordering your sushi!

The chef and servers were extremely friendly and willing to make sure that you get your sushi craving taken care of! This restaurant gets a 5 stars because they have really good sushi for an astonish price.",J4sI9iOi0ZmB7Q1t1vSqPA,2,2,5,VG41lm3b5c_NZRFJhau7pA

HONESTLY would have to say that is pretty much all that is really good about this place in my opinion... only because I am a definately picky sushi eater but you can't expect too much from an AYCE place I guess. 

We always just let Justin prepare anything & we tell him which fishes we don't like. Presentation of the dishes are cute & fun.

 Service from the chefs seems to be a LOT quicker than the serving staff though. But it could have also been because maybe they thought the chefs would just do all the work.  One this that did kind of bother me visually was the employees that were eating & drinking at the sushi bar & the just strolling around the resteraunt in their pjs.... but maybe they could have been the owners who knows...

Their unagi was delicious, bulgogi lunch combo was great too, and it was really inexpensive, compared to what we'd been used to on the Vegas strip. They're open until 1am, and I kept that in mind in case I wanted to make another trip here before my trip back home.  Definitely will make it a point to stop here to grab a bite again.

The chili oil is not very fragrant or flavorful. The best thing about our visit was the rolls. I'd give the rolls like a B.

We did the all you can eat so we were able to try a bunch of different items and every one of them was really bad. Nothing is made fresh. Everything is frozen and the result is no flavor, awkward unpleasant textures and very poor quality. Presentation was also weird. Even the pickled ginger was flavorless and harsh to eat. I can't think of anything positive about the experience and I felt like my money was completely wasted. It was completely empty which should have been our first sign to walk right out before even sitting down. I can't believe it is still in business.

3622263,2015-07-15,2,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"UGH. UGH. I was in Vegas for a business trip and picked this AYCE (26.95 dinner) over another 2 in the area and I am SO glad I did! This place is so good that I felt compelled to start this review while I'm still eating but probably won't finish since the food is that good. Haha. 

The AYCE menu is pretty extensive and impressive.. With 45 appetizers, 27 nigiri selections, 15 classic rolls, 12 deep fried rolls, 52 special rolls, 9 baked rolls and some dessert options. 

What I ordered: 

Nigiri; salmon, garlic tuna, white tuna, octopus, yum yum scallop. The nigiri here isn't buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness but for AYCE, it's definitely above average and I don't think you'd complain. 

Sashimi chef choice: it was salmon and same as above. 

Oysters: so big and good! Only one order per person though. 

Crawfish: this dish is so yummy. It's a bunch of crawfish cooked in a delicious sauce. It is a bit greasy though and for a fellow fatty like me to say that means a lot because I love grease. It does have a kick which is great.  

Baby octopus: they're actually pretty big for being ""baby"" and I liked them but without the sauce, they're kinda bland. 

Seaweed salad: a must at every sushi restaurant for me and this one was great! 

Orleans roll: OMG. This is the best sushi roll I have EVER had. I love cream cheese in my rolls. If you do too and you love salmon and spicy mayo, get this roll. The spicy mayo is actually spicy which is so awesome. This roll makes me want to move to Vegas. Okay that's me being dramatic but seriously, it's just really good okay? 

I got the strawberry, green tea and red bean ice cream for dessert and both were good! 

The waitress that was working was such a sweetheart too. She was so nice that when she told me they ran out of uni today, I didn't even get upset and if you know me, I NEED my uni.

Last night my friend and I were downtown and we were craving the lobster roll. She called Sushi 21 and asked for the hours for all you can eat. The man who answered the phone said that the AYCE was until 2 and the restaurant was open until 3. We got there right before 2. When we came in we were told that we can only order takeout. My friend explained that she had called and was told the restaurant was open until 3. We were not told we could only order take out. The guy said we didn't call and that he's the only one who answered. Once she showed him the outgoing call in her phone, he changed his story. He didn't try to accommodate and wasn't polite about it at all. 

We ended up going up the street to another sushi spot. Sushi 21 lost out on the $70 that we paid for sushi and tip at the other location. More so, I just don't like people who lie so I won't continue to tell other people about Sushi 21.  The food is great which is the only reason I gave two stars. Customer service deserves negative stars. 

Update: went back on 9/13 because I do like the food. My transaction was pending with my bank then disappeared. On 9/19, Sushi 21 charged me the actual $23 I approved plus an additional $23 duplicate transaction and both cleared the bank. That's one expensive all you can eat.

3947820,2015-03-25,0,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"This place was AMAZING! It may even be a new favourite for me in terms of AYCE on the West Side (I live in Green Valley area) because the quality is phenomenal without overdoing it on the rice side.

I always started out with seaweed salad and edamame. The salad was on the small side in terms of portion, but very sweet and delectable flavour so it did compensate. It leaves room for much more anyway! The edamame came out steaming which is great because nothing is worse than cold edamame as it tends to drop in temperature rapidly anyway.

Their menu has very unique items compared to most AYCE places. I tried the Screaming O Salad, which was three pieces of seared tuna with the sauce slathered over cabbage and lettuce. At first I expected it to taste bland due to the lack of colour but it was actually a very similar sauce compared to Ohjah's, which is a more expensive a la carte bistro in Summerlin- my only point of reference really. This was very close, and quite enjoyable for trying something new.

Their nigiri was just as comparable in quality to my favourite Henderson spot Sushiwa. The fish itself was a little smaller but at least not coupled with a snowball of rice and leaving you to order more. The salmon and tuna were both moist with flavour and I enjoyed the Pepper-Seared and Super White- both hit me with that va va voom melting effect.

BUT if you want melting- then you WANT to ordered their baked rolls. I suggest a half-roll so that you don't have to be wheeled out of the joint, and it works if you're sharing so that you can try more. The two rolls that blew my mind were the Baked Salmon and Baked Lobster. Absolutely delectable, especially Lobster for me. 

At this point, if you're still open to another order before getting dessert, I suggest another half-roll of something fresh like Philadelphia per my friend's suggestion or perhaps another simple roll. 

Despite bikini season approaching quite quickly, I knew I needed to experience their Deep-Fried Oreo. It was the first I'd seen in the desserts section of an AYCE before and it came out with a beautiful dollop of whipped cream, rainbow sprinkles, and deep fried chocolate. My waistline was happy it was only the size of 2 oreo cookies but my stomach was a little sad not to have more because the rich chocolate complemented the entire meal. Don't expect it to be creamy like the cookie though, and it's no complaint from me because I have a slight allergic reaction to anything too thick or frosty hitting my throat (no innuendo pun intended).

Came here because Goyemon estimated us a one hour wait time (as soon as we started getting our food at Sushi 21, Goyemon called -.-.  

This is not sushi. This is garbage. STAY AWAY!  The quality is absolutely horrible. 
Something that stood out was the uni.  This was THE worst sea urchin I have encountered in my life. It was faaaaar from fresh, and the consistency was disgusting.  I have eaten fresh uni in Tsukiji fish market in Japan, right out of the sea urchin, still moving... So I know exactly how fresh and good uni should taste.  I dont know what I was thinking expecting it from this restaurant.

It is Korean owned, and not authentic Japanese sushi.  The sushi ""chefs"" did not know the proper way to prepare the dishes or what sauces go with which.  They are also not very good at preparing sauces, as we had a roll that came out tasting exactly like a sour lemon... Ummm yikes!  Please wait the extra 20 minutes and go to Goyemon.

rolls - there are about 30 diff ones on the menu...the ones that i can remember the best were the ""coco roll"" (seared yellowtail with ponzu sauce over a spicy tuna roll(?)) and the sushi 21 roll (eel and tuna on top, cant remember the middle)...we also had a bunch of other ones floating around the table, which were all pretty good, but these 2 were my favorites

nigiri - a little bit dry...liked that they didnt put too much rice, but some of the fish just didn't look too appetizing...

appetizers - tried the edamame, seaweed salad, and gyoza which were all pretty good, but also pretty standard...

if you have a car, it might be worth visiting, but if you have to cab it, i would try some place else since its about a $15 ride from the strip",PkWAYvkhhn03NBB_6i2TkQ,1,1,3,dWPY2pAWFTSGaMGKE6NqLQ

We were headed to Goyemon and discovered the hostess was not friendly and the wait at 5:40 on a Friday night for a party 3 adults and 3 kids was going to be 1 1/2 hrs.  Seriously?  There was just one other couple waiting ahead of us.  

We yelped the nearest sushi restaurant with 4 or more stars.  And turns out this was literally just around the corner.  

- AYCE was $27
- Decent selection on the menu
- Favs:  (rolls) Sexy girl, Heartache, Johnny, Snake (or rattle snake...snake is in the     name or something)  Anyway, we tried a lot of rolls and enjoyed them all but these were our favorites.
- VERY kid friendly (customized kids chopsticks), owner brought out crayons and color pages, and topped it off with balloons.
- Dessert:  MOCHI (strawberry) - delicious ice cream in the middle and a chewy sweet rice cake on the outside
- Sake bombs on the house the night we went.  (Who doesn't like sake bombs, especially when they're on the house.)
- Friendly and entertaining sushi chefs.

4046850,2015-06-09,0,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"A few hours of swimming at Temptations Pool Party at the Luxor, you work up an appetite. My boyfriend, his best friend, and I decided to check this place out after finding out the AYCE Chinese Buffet next door turned into a Dim Sum a la carte restaurant. The place was fairly cramped with the booths real close to your gut. It was almost like my man boobs were actually sitting on the table when we were done. We all decided to get the AYCE sushi dinner (1 hour time limit), which was fairly priced.

The service was fast and so was the sushi that came from the sushi bar for the first 15 rolls. Most of the flavors seemed to have originated from Korean style, Kim chee especially the ahi poke. 90% of the rolls that came to the table were drenched or overly sauced. When I go to a Japanese restaurant, I expect my sushi to come out fresh, with natural flavors. So all the sauces on these rolls today, is masking the low quality fish.

The last 5 orders depreciated the ratings of this place.  They should watch the quality of all their products, especially the ""mini beef platter"", the meat tasted past due. So guess who had the runs for the past day and a half? So I didn't know if the meat was actually meant to be on the fermented side, cause the whole Korean influence, or they were trying to sneak away with serving the meat til it was sold out so their food cost wouldn't be so high. There was a sushi roll that had corn and grilled onions on top of it, like who does that? With over powering, mayo based sauce drenching the rolls underneath, It would be awesome if all their rolls came with a description of what's inside or on top, My boyfriend is allergic to tomatoes, citrus, and onions. So then my ramen came out. I was thinking it would be a homemade ramen noodle, with a nice broth. Nope, top ramen, Kim chee flavored, with a sprig of green onion, dusted with more Kim chee seasoning!

If. It weren't for the e.coli infested beef tips, the drenched and soggy rolls, the mediocre tempura ice cream, and the southwestern, over kill on the onions on top of the sushi, or the imitation ramen, I'd given this whole in the wall a higher rating!",eMwXdbCwnXgNpvEAttH3-w,1,1,3,0-bSJ5Vvr1p4MNfQfqcH_Q

Since my friend is still new to the world of sushi, we decided to stick to rolls, and mainly to ones she had tried already. So I called in and ordered a Philly roll, a Spicy Tuna roll, and a Las Vegas roll. I was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. 

The rolls weren't ready when I arrived, I waited a good 5-10 minutes for them. Service was friendly though,  and the rolls were fairly inexpensive, the total was $22 and change.

The rolls were tasty although the Philly was a little loose, they kept falling apart on us...  Generous amount of tuna in the Spicy Tuna roll, and I appreciated that they gave us eel sauce on the side for the Las Vegas roll. 

Was this the best sushi ever? No, not even close. But it's inexpensive and close to work, so it's likely I will eat there again...",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,1,3,UDf8No0rVI3BB4mYf7uGqg

I got the baked scallops, and as a baked scallops lover, I was extremely disappointed. For some reason, they shredded the scallops. I've never seen that before.

Food was good! Amazingly good. The sauces. The fish. The variety. The waiter forgot to hand us back our sheet with what we ordered sooo I'm sorry I can't remember the names of the rolls we ordered :( my favorite had salmon on top. Inside was crab and shrimp tempura. ) I'm assuming maybe the waiter did not bring back the paper because he thought we were done eating. But you should still always bring it back after each round just in case.    We actually ordered other rolls but got full and told the waiter to cancel the upcoming rolls.

He said sure but one roll still came to our table from a different waitress.. I felt bad to tell them to please take it back and reminded them our other rolls were canceled... 

Also they have typos on their menu which is frustrating. It wasn't until after I finished eating that I saw the correction at the bottom of the menu ""rolls that say 6pcs are actually 8pcs but you can ask for half roll of 4pcs"". UGH why why why didn't I see that sooner???????? I would've tried way more rolls in half quantity and not been confused why I have 8 instead of 6 ... please just get new menus and fix them. Don't do a little note. It's just lazy. Or atleast put that Little note at the top of the menu where people are more likely to see it. 

The menu to order gives you only 2 rounds. Most places give you 3. Also, there's no section for appetizers and desserts to check what you want. There's a memo section in the back so that helps I guess. 

There must not be much communication happening because two diff waiters came to us and we reminded them we've been waiting for our shrimp tempura for awhile. Our wonton soup never came so we didn't even mention it. And we ended up getting two plates of the tempura :/ plus it's an appetizer so it was kinda pointless eating it at the end of our meal but oh well. We overheard another table asking for the same thing so it wasn't just us.

I like ""real"" sushi...lol...ok, ok, ""real"" in terms of my definition, which is old school nigiri, where you can taste if the quality of the fish (and even rice) is there or not. With rolls, it's easy to get away with masking lack of quality and freshness with all the cream cheese, various sauces, cucumber, etc, so you can't tell anyway. We had tried to get into Goyemon but there was a long wait...so we tried this place, which had no wait at all. So that's a plus.

1.5 stars. I usually round up but here I'm rounding down for the dishonesty of their check-in scam.

We were craving sushi around 1am and this was the only AYCE we saw that was open past 2am.

Service was friendly and not inattentive though that may have had to do with the fact that we were the only ones there at 1am (despite their supposedly closing at 3am).

Last call is posted in the window as 2:15 but when we sat down we were informed last call was at 1:45am. Did not contest the sign on the door. Maybe they changed their hours, but if that is the case then they needed to also change their signs.

The sushi rice was too sweet.

Fish across the board was not very fresh.

Uni was not great. The brighter the color, the better. Pale or brown uni has either a plasticky or seaweedy (and not in a good way) taste to it. These were pretty brown, but surprisingly not as awful as at JJANGA or Goyemon.

Oysters were far from the worst I'd ever had, but the freshness of a raw seafood item is still worryingly called into question when you feel the need to put lemon slices directly on it.

Snow crab was so cloyingly sweet it was sweeter than the shaved ice we had at Chada St on Tuesday. It did not taste like crab at all, real *or* fake.

We asked for no sauce on anything but they only remembered to not put sauce on our shrimp tempura roll, which had surprise ""krab"" (fake crab) in it.

Which brings me to the rolls. Rolls on the special, baked, and fried rolls lists (basically everything that was not on the traditional roll list) were not very varied. Almost everything had fake crab in it even if it was not a listed ingredient. Everything that didn't have krab had spicy tuna and everything that didn't have spicy tuna had krab.

We ended up only getting a couple rolls because after they couldn't get ""no sauce"""" right we were not confident they would be able to do ""no crab"" reliably and did not want to fill our stomachs with that sweet crud.

Disappointed that they had run out of tempura green tea ice cream. I wasn't sure how they could still have green tea ice cream and still have tempura and not have tempura green tea ice cream (I had horrific thoughts of soggy, pre-tempura'd ice cream dancing rudely in my head, but the DH informed me that they have to super-freeze a ball of ice cream in order to tempura it without it melting, and that this takes 2 hours or more, so apparently that's how).

Don't like the scam they're running for the check-in discount. Have encountered the whole ""write good review for a discount"" scam before, but never seen it attached to a check-in, or seen a place where they want the review up front. Makes no sense.",SkGhMBBRcvKq3bwjcjbs_w,1,0,1,4Gnl15ZOfzeOxI_opSXzhg

When I got the agedashi tofu it was served with Ponzu and not the traditional dashi sauce.  When the sushi chef asked me if everything is ok I told him no and can I have some tempura sauce.  the server came to me and told me that it's supposed to be served with ponzu sauce.. Then i Replied ""no it's not.  The name of the dish tells you what it is.  It's called agedashi because age means to deep fry and Dashi is the sauce that it's served with"".  

the Eel bowl to my dismay was served on top of sushi rice and not regular steamed rice.  which is the traditional way.  

Later i found out that it is a Korean run restaurant.  So I must say that they should learn to make food the right way or rename it to fit their serving ways.  don't call something one thing and then serve it a different way

The 2 most basic staples in a sushi restaurant is Tuna and Salmon and I could not express my level of disappointment in the Sushi, the Salmon wasn't the freshest or the highest quality so it tasted like bland slabs of meat along with the fact that there was too much vinegar was used in the rice.

The rolls on the other hand were flavored very well, but if you're trying to cover up the taste of bland fish, you're going to have to use the right sauce.

Came here for dinner after a very hard day. The old check-in offer listed here on Yelp is not even valid, but I had to learn that from some mysterious person in the back who viewed my phone offer. Ummm WHY is it still on their Yelp page? ! 

I like to sit at the bar because you usually get the best service, but wow!  That's simply NOT true at this establishment.

 5:30 pm on a Friday, and the restaurant was dead. There were only 3-other parties, and  3-sushi chefs behind the counter, yet not one of them even bothered to acknowledge our existence until about 3-minutes after we were seated. Mind you, they were standing right there in front of us!  

I guess their grub hub order took precedence over customers inside the restaurant. Bottom line: we couldn't even eat here because the servers wouldn't even acknowledge us long enough to take our order. 

I won't be back!  To the new Yama we go!  At least we know the food and service is always amazing at Yama Sushi.

The restaurant was empty (on a Friday night) and we were seated right in front of the sushi bar. I felt like I was on watch the entire time. 

Menu items are priced to make AYCE a better deal. The sushi had more rice than fish. They don't have sashimi in their buffet menu and you're expected to eat all your rice. Many of the rolls were fried and/or drenched in sauce, disguising their low quality fish. Presentation was lacking. My maki rolls basically looked like kimbap with fish in it. My server wasn't really knowledgeable of the items and didn't know the answers to my questions. Not a big deal, assuming that he's new.

Rolls came out fast and were good the SWAT was my favorite since I'm a shrimp lover. Our friends grabbed single menu items and we both did AYCE which was alright up until our friends had to leave. The server brought everyone's check even though we weren't finished eating which wasn't a big deal at all until our server started not coming to our table. We made eye contact with her multiple times and it still took her about 5 minutes to come by and check on us. She cleared our table as well without asking if we had wanted anything else (hadn't even ordered our last rolls or dessert yet). She ended up coming back after seating a table behind us at which point we were 1 of four tables with two servers in the restaurant. When she asked if we wanted dessert we were relieved and put in our final order. The deep fried Oreo was amazing as was the mango mochi really all the dessert was good (we got 2 of each). 
All in all good service at first that had a sheer cliff drop off after our friends. Sushi came out quickly but the nigiri was covered in some type of brown vinegar stuff that made it rather ""eh"". Rolls and dessert were great. More attentive service throughout the whole experience would've been nice instead of being placed into the ""I'm getting auto gratuity I don't need good service"" category. 3 star nigiri, 5 star rolls and dessert, 3 star service.",5LU8ejCPg88auLUHatSz_w,0,0,3,txAPSCneGz5-bKE3IJfehQ

My low score does not have to do with the fact that they were less Jan accommodating to a paying guest. Though it may partly influence me a bit. 

The restaurant itself is very clean, well lit and fittings for a few parties. 

They have a larger variety of sushi rolls and if you're a sushi fan you'll love their all you can eat menu, and the different rolls.

Their dessert menu is limited to one dessert option per person which is somewhat standard as other places.

The main reason for my low review score was the bad customer service I experienced in this establishment. The servers were extremely rude and were less than helpful when helping me select menu items. Don't get me wrong I understand that it's a sushi place you have to eat fish, but they were less than pleased to serve me and made a paying customer feel like she was not desired at their establishment.

We are from out of state and HATE the business of the strip and casino restaurants. This place was easy to get to and had plenty of parking. A serious plus in our book!
We were seated and immediately brought our drinks. The waiter took around 10 minutes to make it around to our table but my food came out within 5 minutes of ordering!! So quick!

I ordered the gyoza which came with a delicious dipping sauce. I wasn't hungry enough for the AYCE menu so I just got one roll. I chose the yum yum roll which was delicious! Super light and fresh. I ate the whole roll and appetizer and felt very satisfied. 

My husband however was starving and chose the all you can eat option which was very reasonably priced at $26.95. (Each roll averages to about $11 dollars so this option made sense) 
His order took a little longer to make, I had finished my whole meal before he got his. It would have been nice to maybe have at least one roll of his brought out with mine. 
He chose the TNT, caterpillar, and the vegas lasagna roll. 

The service was great overall, our waiter was attentive and checked back to let my husband know his rolls would be out soon. Sure enough they were brought within 3 minutes.  

The atmosphere is laid back and casual. We appreciated this after a long day of driving. 

The price point was good; the AYCE made up for the lack of the ""half price sushi"" option. The restaurant was pretty spacious so it wasn't too loud. LOTS of booths.

With over 70 awesome rolls to choose from, you know you gotta go AYCE (and I did).

Now, when going AYCE I typically stay away from appetizers.  DO NOT make that mistake by skipping the apps here!  The Dynamite appetizer is a soupy taste of the sea you just have to try.  Little bits of sea creatures in an onion, corn and mushroom soup make this funky bowl of sea goodness something you gotta try.  Second on the ""gotta do"" is the ""cherry blossom"" app: spring mix salad with a ball of avocado slices stuffed with spicy soft shell crab) and a sweet eel sauce.  It's an extremely good way to start the meal.  Oh, and I'll let you experience the ""Screaming Orgasm"" appetizer for yourself (trust me, you'll thank me for allowing you to do so).

Rolls you gotta do: popcorn lobster, fire fire and kiss of fire (I like hot and spicy, and the hottest on the menu is the ""fire fire"").  But look, you really can't go wrong with anything here. From the ""plain"" to the special stuff, it all tastes great!

I'm one of those weird people though who need a little rice with her sushi, hence the rolls.  I was really craving some softshell crab, but the roll we ordered was just chopped up imitation crab, which I did not care for.  The other roll we ordered was a spicy tuna with other stuff and that was really good.  

All in all, it was a good experience.  The restaurant was a bit empty at 9:30pm, and the service was quick and friendly.  The prices are very reasonable too.  Definitely one of the better non-strip sushi places.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,2,2,4,jAk9oC1KvBT_lZQWzKQUgg

I went with a group of 5 for a co-worker's birthday for the all-you-can-eat-and-drink menu ($36 per person - total of $46 including tax and mandatory 18% gratuity for group over 4 people).

After an hour of happy devouring, my hungry co-workers (3 men and 1 girl) finally slowed down, with half a roll of tuna and baked salmon left on the plate. The waitress came by and urged us to cancel the rest of our order until we finish all our sushi, otherwise she said they would charge us. We figured the remaining sushi was equal to one more piece per person to finish, so we insisted on our order of 2-piece sweet shrimp nigiri anyway, because we were craving sweet shrimps. 

We waited for another 15 minutes and asked the waitress twice, yet the sweet shrimp nigiri didn't come. Finally the waitress said that they ""ran out of shrimp and is waiting for shrimp to defrost"". That was when we realized that the waitress was counting on us not to finish our roll, and she was not going to bring out the sweet shrimp nigiri until we finish everything. 

So we did clear our plate, and finally the sweet shrimp nigiri came. I know sweet shrimp is considered a more expensive item, but this behavior from the restaurant management just feels petty. Considered how much the cost was per person, and that our group was well-behaved and not rowdy, this is no way for a business to treat customers!",bXYpGn8KJHfMRjBC2gN38w,3,0,2,Xdxkat7kXmlIg3XxYP9dsg

Tuesday night, 6 pm and there were 3 people in there, and no one else came in there the hour that I was there.  That's a BAAAAAD sign.  Typically tuesday is when sushi restaurants get their fresh fish and deliveries. If I recall, the fish markets are closed on mondays and there are no shipments.  So Tuesday & Wednesdays are the best days to go.  

Without even asking, they brought me edamame and miso soup.  I don't particularly care for when someone brings me something that I didn't order.  Their miso soup was lacking flavor and only had 2 spoonfulls, their edamame was fine.

On an all you can eat place, portions should be small-medium.  I ordered the sashimi salad and it was in a large bowl (toooo much) and the taste was just ok, it tasted like they put their garlic sauce that they put on their sushi rolls, onto their salad.  Maybe some people like this, but I sure didn't.

Their sushi rolls were avg. I saw lots of rolls on their menu that were based on california rolls and to me that is a sign of cheapness.  Another typical bad sign is when you can't order directly from the chef. They use the paper order forms and quite frankly I HATE the paper order forms.  

I ordered 2 sushi rolls and they were just ok

and then I ordered some nigiri and this sealed the deal that this place is bad...

I ordered 2 hamachi and 1 super white (both were good)
I ordered 1 order each of snow crab, uni and amaebi (sweet shrimp)  I didn't get any of those orders. The show crab was still frozen (I saw him put the large frozen block of it into the fridge behind the counter), and then he apologized they are out of uni and sweet shrimp.  Guess what folks...  Sushi mon and Goyemon are never out of it.

and that leads me back to what I wrote above. Everything is usually fresh/delivered on tuesdays.  So where's your fish at?????

As with a typical AYCE sushi place, they make the sushi on demand. They have a huge assortment of rolls, a subset of the traditional nigiri, and some other (mostly Korean) appetizers: bulgogi, ramen, and spicy pork.

Part of this was an ordering error on our part, but most of the rolls ended up tasting the same despite having different sauces. The rice had a strange texture, probably an artifact of mass production. The fish was fresh but medium quality and sliced thinner than a traditional sushi restaurant would slice it.

On the up side, the servers were very prompt and friendly. They used preprinted sheets to take your order (like a dim sum place). Strangely they ran out of hot water to make tea but were able to heat some more in 10 minutes. Dishes were efficiently whisked away. One of the servers had a hard time understanding us and took plates we wanted to keep and didn't refill our tea when we asked.

All in all, we would be Grinch-like to complain about the super good deal we got. But if I were paying full price, I might try one of the more established players closer to the heart of Chinatown. So four stars for he Christmas special deal and maybe 3 stars if we were paying full price (as of Dec 2015, their prices were $21.95 for lunch and $26.95 for dinner).",vWVRXAbZ-JuEZiRm52-s4w,0,0,4,sN_NnMW6gobN4yhx7jXJtg

My favorite specialty has seared salmon with kiwi - one of Kenny's awesome little creations. Just the thought of this delectable little dish makes me want to hop in the car and head over for an early dinner. 

Meanwhile, if you're going to stick to the menu, I would suggest the popcorn lobster roll - somehow the sweet of the eel sauce and spicy mayo mix with the coolness of the California roll and the heat of the deep fried lobster bites to form the perfect symphony of greatness. Seriously. Try it.

HOW DO YOU EXPECT CUSTOMERS TO WRITE A REVIEW EVEN BEFORE YOU EAT THEIR FOOD AND EXPERIENCE THEIR SERVICE? THEY OFFER 10% DISCOUNT IF YOU WRITE A REVIEW AND YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM THE REVIEW YOU WROTE. THATS JUST SO SKETCHY. SO I CAN ONLY ASSUME THAT THE HIGH RATING OF THIS PARTICULAR RESTAURANT IS BECAUSE EVERYONE REVIEWED FOR THE 10% DISCOUNT.

I walked in the restaurant with the boyfriend and OH MY GOSH, I have never seen a waitress that look so rude and mean before in my life. She had hell of an attitude that just showed so clearly on her freaking face, the way she talked and handed our menu. YOU KNOW WHAT? IF YOURE GOING TO GIVE A DIRTY LOOK LIKE YOU DID, CAN YOU NOT WORK? NO CUSTOMERS WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE AND DINE THERE WITH THE CRAPPY SERVICE YOU 'THINK' IS SERVICE.

So you think I am overreacting? Oh hells no. I have to admit I am very sensitive about customer service. My boyfriend? He likes to keep it to himself and he always tries to stop me if I want to complain to the waiter/waitress. He was the FIRST one to tell me about that waitress. He immediately felt like he wanted to leave but we already stopped by 2 restaurants before this one and we were just SOOOOO HUNGRY to go elsewhere.

Sushi was so thin. PERIOD. Fish to rice ratio was so bad. Too much rice and fish was so thin that it was so TRANSPARENT. We didnt order much on our first batch and there were only one or two other tables besides us and it took FOREVER to get our order. We specifically asked no sauce on any of our nigiri and they forgot and put sauce on it. I told that rude waitress about it and she went to go tell the sushi chef and she comes back asking very ruthlessly, 'are you not going to eat that?' I wanted to freaking get up and tell her off because of her arrogant attitude. UGHHHHH. Miso soup was salty as hell. I took a sip and put it to aside.

You can only order two rounds compared to three at other restaurants. I dont know why this restaurant is still in business and not only that, they definitely need to re-hire the servers and get rid of the rude and arrogant ones. Also, fish meat has to be much more thicker. The sushi chefs need to be more professional. They curse and talk too much when making sushi. They walked out of restaurant with the apron on and came back inside and didnt see then washing hands EVEN THOUGH they wear gloves to make sushi.

I wanted to go to Goyemon but their wait was way too long for two hungry stomachs. This restaurant was probably the worst one out of my Vegas trip this week. I didnt want to leave any tip for the waitress and I do not feel bad about not leaving tip because I have no reason to give her any. My boyfriend said to leave it for the other waitress that was slightly 'better' than the rude one.

I am korean and I do go to Korean owned susbi restaurants because AYCE sushi is mostly ran by Koreans BUT!!! This place is missing every component of a good restaurant.

1. Good food.
2. Good service.
3. Good portion.

I am not sure IF this restaurant is affiliated with other Sushi 21 in California in cities like Oceanside and San Pedro but one of them is CLOSED and the other one is BARELY running. Their rating is so low. At least they didnt 'buy' the reviews from customers.

To start the sushi quality and freshness is what earns my repeated visits. Originally recommended by a friend that also drives off the strip every visit to Vegas this has also become a place I highly recommend to visitors.

Coming for Los Angeles my choices for sushi is far and beyond. At $26.95 a person for dinner the price may be a little steep but they offer it back in value that can't be beaten with a few one per person orders like Giant Clam, Uni, sweet shrimp, Fresh Oysters, and a lot more.

The place features fusion sushi rolls and many creations by the sushi chefs here. Things like Cherry Blossom which features spicy soft shell crab wrapped in avacado are just delicacies to crave and earn the right for another visit!

If you are a green mussel fan, my wife and i order 5-6 orders of 2 pieces each every time we come lol... And it's sad you'd think you get better food in LA but this place has it done right!

There is also fusion of Korean delights such as galbi and bugolgi.

The decor of the place is very izakaya friendly. They even have an area where you purchase and bring your own chopsticks and they will wash them and place it a area dedicated for you to use when you visit.

Those of you that follow me know the amount of sushi I enjoy on a regular basis and this place has made it to my top 3 in value and variety of all time.

I highly recommend the place and encourage you to give a chance.",piW4AGHQmsKMpBL-8YZujw,2,1,5,5G9TG0-xYg0X1kzwerdW_Q

- MEDIOCRE sushi at best. I've never seen such a wimpy sushi roll that cost 13 in my life. The soft-shell crab that they use are the legs! not even the body. it was far from crunchy. The yellowtail was so cowardly, it made the sushi look worse. it looked like a roll from a GROCERY STORE. horrible presentation. 
- Tempura ice cream was good. They put sprinkles on it. It reminded me of a birthday cake. haha

We sat down and they gave us a sheet of paper where in you have the list of most of the items except for appetizer and just check which you wanted. I thought it was cool but at your second order they never gave the list so eh..

So we're done for the first round but still have a few rolls on our plate (angus and chicken teriyaki roll which didn't taste so good for me ) and I wanted some more seaweed salad and other things so I called the waitress, before I could even speak she already opened her mouth and told me ""you do know that we charge if you have any left overs "" and she was looking down at my plate. As if we were done eating and trying to get the check but no we were still going to order and that kind off loss my appetite for a little bit, I obviously know your policy cause it's in the menu, and we wanted to order more and obviously we will finish all what we ordered because we didn't want to be charged.

5574271,2012-01-05,0,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"First off, I feel sorry for any sushi place that I visit when I was craving Goyemon but it was a 45 min wait and we had to catch a movie after grub. Sushi 21 was just down Decatur and had a 4 star rating on here so we decided to try it.

This place is pretty good. The appetizers and rolls with AYCE are amongst the better places in town. The server we had was back very frequently to check on us and the sushi chefs were engaging. One of them even made me a half roll at the end of our meal even though they don't usually allow it when doing AYCE. 

The only complaint that I had is when I ordered my first round of yellowtail, super white tuna, tuna, salmon, and unagi. It came out and looked very fresh but it smelled as if it were treated with something to preserve the fish. There was a slight taste of vinegar or something as well. I couldn't really place it. But the cuts were very generous and once past the ""treated smell / taste"" it had a good taste. I base my sushi experience pretty solely on the freshness / taste of the nigiri / sashimi so they're gonna take a hit on this one.

Overall, a nice substitute for my fave sushi place in town when I was on a tight time schedule. Not a place I'd visit again unless the same circumstances arise with better places close by.",aGNvO5rjmeHspcpGZNOoQw,0,0,3,RIcJL3gJKMvssfJ1c0iQDQ

You know when you have a favorite place and hate to try a new place this is exactly what happen the other night!!

Going in we check in and there was a 10% off with Yelp check in which was nice, As soon as we were seated I showed the guy who was going to be our waiter,

His name was Jay and he was very helpful. We told him we had never been there before and did not know what to order,
He asked what we liked and we explained we were fans of Yama Sushi and he told us he had been there before so he was aware of what we explained we liked and that we did want lot of rice to whatever we ordered.
,
It was really nice you can order 1/2 orders on the rolls. Were not big on the rolls especially if there is a lot of rice. We do not want to pay for AUCE and have tons of rice that is not why we like Sushi. I want to taste the flavors and enjoy what I am eating.
Jay did a great job picking out some items. One of my all time favorites they make here Japanese Lasagna and he brought out 1/2 roll. That was really good here. I was not crazy about the dynamite with all the corn in it. This was completely different than what I have had before,

Over all service was very good, food was really good and well worth stopping in.

They were out of a few of the drinks that I wanted to try so I had to ""settle"" for a bottle of soju.  The waiter, a little astonished by the severity of my alcohol tolerence, i guess, made hand gestures to demonstrate the size of the bottle.  Having played this game before, I quickly smiled and blushed like an anime character and threw up the thumbs up sign, with both hands. The waiter quickly understood and I thought that I heard him proudly tell another waiter as he walked away, "" Errr, ohh thats a Meesta Amerika, Meesta Uuu Ess Aye!"" But that might have been the soju talking or maybe racism.  
Anyway, the nigiri, which is always my favorite was acceptable.  It came out fast and I did not have to wait.  I had almost everything and all seemed reasonably fresh.  I had to order the AYCE dinner to get the uni, and as always in vegas it is never orange; it's always a little on the brown side, but it was delicious.
What really gives this place four stars, at least for me, was the amount of made up quasi japanese fusion shit that is on their menu.  I had a japanese burrito.  It is basically like a california roll wrapped in a tortilla and deep fried.  I also had a monkey ball, which was like pork and california roll ingredients, breaded, sauced and deep fried.  It was weirdly awesome.
Really, the little things on their menu, like crawfish, golden spoon, dynamite, the above and all the other things makes their AYCE well worth it.  I tried sooooo many things and was quite pleased by the end of the meal.


Oh Wait!!!
Tempura Oreo!!!!!! 
Yeah, I did it, the only down fall was the canned whip cream that accompanied it.  But still, I had a deep fried oreo.  Was it all that tasty?  Any tastier than a non deep fried oreo?  Not really.  But sometimes it's just about the absurdity of the decadence.

Then hit the rolls... I love spicy, so most of my selections come hot! My favorites thus far are the kamikaze, ugly, and the double yellowtail...
Oh order 1/2 rolls so you can try even more of their variety. They have over 100 rolls to pick from!

Now, remember....it's an AYCE sushi place so don't expect Top Grade fish... it's not Jiro's place... but  it is still pretty good... with that being said. Hope you enjoy the grub.

Oh... service is good too! No complaints other than the fact that I asked for a miso three different times and it was never brought out... but meh.",Ks9-MpXiODd_5jfIHSwQOw,3,0,5,wxB1ICe-ymf_FsYwXUkgLg

5911589,2016-02-15,0,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,Second time I have been to Sushi 21 and another great experience. We came in and were told there was an hour wait but some tables were leaving and the got us right in. They're very accommodating (we have 2 small kids that come with us) and they make us feel so comfortable. Hip environment and friendly staff. But excellent sushi! If you are in the area and in the mood for some fish definitely stop by!,0uSLt3BODXJBG1CQE2KfiA,0,0,5,sQbwOCqYNtnC7hN9uj7iUw

5947293,2015-05-23,0,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"Ordinary sushi joint. Nothing really stood out except for the following:

They don't serve soft shell crab (my favorite), hand rolls and their uni was definitely not fresh. 

The uni was a brown pasty color that resembled beef, opposed to the bright yellow/orange. The chef claimed that the uni was bought that morning and can provide a receipt. The chef stated that the uni was brown due to ""the wind,"" aka oxidation. 

The servers were nice and I was super impressed with their memory! They retained all of our orders verbally and did not take any notes. 

The AYCE was about $27/person.",NKhfyW5xvbDX8Wr7TzScJQ,0,0,2,vrOEbTbJaQ7MmwKLpXZf2g

5957084,2016-08-15,0,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"wow!!! let's start with the service:.... TOP NOTCH!!! from the greeting, to ordering, to check out! The whole staff is friends and very helpful. 
The menu: You can order off an all you can eat menu for a really good price for lunch or dinner. They had great choices, but we chose the ala carte menu, which of course adds up to a lot more, but we wanted things specific that weren't on the all you can eat menu. 
The food: really good!! the rolls are packed tightly and the baked rolls were perfect temperates. The sashimi was so very flavorful, but I personal would have preferred it more chilled than warm.  But the presentation was beautiful.
The only con - is the music videos???? They're a mix of strange asain pop and techno, and just odd and comical. 

Overall this is always a great place to go and we will continue to eat here as long as we are in town.",tSYtizQzigOT9cdVIodoww,0,0,5,l5I8sqfBeNGsTKNzVYRo1A
5959920,2012-04-21,2,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,"Craving sushi on the quick and not willing to leave the house to go to our favorite sushi joint in town, Goyemon my fella made the executive decision to order some delivery from Sushi 21. I was reluctant, but let him have his way. 

We called in our order and the food was delivered very quickly. Since I didn't dine in, I can't comment on the service but the food was ok. Nothing amazing, but definitely solid sushi for the price and convenience of delivery. We ordered rolls mainly and they were tasty. Definitely not the best sushi in town but definitely good for convenience. 

They offer dine-in all you can eat options as well as all you can drink.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,3,3,LPfAP682eQ9DX5KHRwNLxg
5960729,2015-08-03,1,xfzDtGxx6B4a27RAyah69w,Not a very good sushi place to go to. We got to the restaurant at 6:15pm and sat until 7:30pm not even one customer. We were the only one. No one at the Resturant on a Sunday. It my first time here. We did all you can eat. When I ask how much dose it cost for my 12 years? First he said 1/2 off from$26.95 but then 5mins later the waiter came back and told us that my son will be a full price. It seems that they don't know how to run a precessional business at all. The all you can eat was not fresh and mostly not much to choose from. It all sushi roll. I would never come back. If I could only give them a zero star I would.,oQXISRtghCcGo2qUdcxxBg,1,1,1,qxg1cj8dwTOGizZ4c8pIjA

I've eaten here a few times for the convenience and never got sick so I don't think it's a freshness issue and instead is just really cheap quality.
