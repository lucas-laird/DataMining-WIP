Well, was pleasantly surprised. In the central valley Sahara and Rancho area is this Amazing little place to eat and socialize. I recommend the molcajete. A fusion of different types of Cheeze and proteins grilled stewed and steamed inside a hot lava rock bowl with this Amazing sauce. It's worth the trip alone. The people are friendly and the atmosphere inside the main restaurant, the patio, and the bar is quaint and personal. 

Good check average for the amount of food.

The service was exceptional.   There was no rush to order.  The food was served in good time, and a great presentation.   
I ordered simple hard shell fish tacos.  Awesome !
The soup served first was very good. With just one taco, the small soup, and a few fresh chips, I was stuffed.  
Next time may try an alcoholic  drink and/or desert.   

The owner came over and talked with us. Thought at first we were going to be asked when were going to leave, as we had been there for a time just talking.  He asked how we liked the food, and we got into a great conversation about how it all came together at this location.

I was surprised and annoyed to be asked to pay extra for items available at every table in the restaurant. I decided against any further monetary investment. I made a mental note to NOT do business here again.

When I got the food home, I realized that the food containers did not include any salsa as a condiment for the food.

Lots of flavor and thin vermicelli type of noodles.  What was also a bonus was the coffee served here.  Dark, rich, flavorful coffee, similar to what you would get in a coffee roasters place.

Server brought me Chips and Salsa which were perfect. Salsa was not too spicy and had excellent flavor. She then took my order and I asked for an a la carte Pork Tamale and Beef Enchilada. I asked her about the sauce and she encouraged me to get a red and green sauce so I could try them both. Only an experienced server would do that....thank you! I'm sorry I can't remember her name but very caring and she understands guest service. She first brought me a cup of Sopa de Fide.  It was lightly flavored and gentle on the palate. Served hot.  It was a wonderful way to start the meal.  My entree came out and to put it simply, it was as authentic as I've ever had. I've stayed down in Mexico and completely understand the cuisine. I used to think my mother-in-law's tamales were the best but your tamales stand out. Beef Enchilada was great and the Shredded Beef I could tell was made fresh and seasoned properly. I usually can tell a lot by a Mexican restaurant with their Chips,  Beans and Rice. When Chips/Beans are served old and Rice is served hard, I know that I'm in a bad place and I don't return. But what makes my lunch and La Cabana 5-STAR is that every component on the plate was superb. You can tell the kitchen is PASSIONATE  about cooking!  Keep up the terrific work as you're doing many things right with your food quality and your FOH service. I did want to add the host person helped the server's by handling the guest checks. The team works well together. I will return soon. Thank you.",b1qtc-J8FLFfCfrQD26cvQ,2,0,5,ANj4IxTDh-_5XZtbDQbP6Q

The team of Cabana was very attending.
Although a few of the orders got mixed up and delayed, which is normal and acceptable for a ground this large, generally they provided great customer service.  

Everyone was satisfied with their food ... we had plenty of vegetarians / vegans on the table and the food seemed to go very well with their choices.  Their chips and salsa is fantastic and their avocado / guacamole dip is amazing.

Outside seating area was exceptionally clean and the restroom and other inside facilities were spotless",Zw4d_4rqPAF3TavdbRfisg,0,0,4,euh2pBiUvfphghsUoYYB0w

After driving around, for what felt like hours, to find something appealing for lunch we ended up here (luckily). 

In an interesting building & slightly hidden but don't let that scare you away; from the food to the cocktails this place has unique flavor. 
I'm not into tamales but the boyfriend is & he LOVED his; along with the enchilada & taco. There is something really sweet & flavorful happening with the beans & rice- some of the best I've ever had.  I enjoys some tacos- was impressed when I asked about the fish being grilled or battered, she said battered but could do grilled...I was really happy with that answer & impressed with the fish taco.   
The complementary soup & chips/salsa are beyond satisfying.  

The margaritas are HUGE & delicious!

The plaza where it is located is older and not very inviting however the restaurant is decorated nicely. I really liked the metal stars hanging from the ceiling. 

Our server was pleasant and brought us each a complimentary cup of fiedo soup. Only one person liked it. We ordered a wet carne asada burrito, chimichanga, tacos, and enchiladas. The food was good. My only real complaint was that my food was barely warm. The cheeses inside the enchiladas was not even melted.  If I had had more time I would if sent it back.

5653743,2017-12-03,0,nVHrMUiXqt3bMAia27gRhA,"I used to patronize this restaurant now and again at their old location on MLK Blvd. I knew they had closed due to the Neon Project going on but I had no idea they had relocated. Going out for a work lunch, my co-worker drove me to this new location. I have to admit, I wasn't real excited at first as the last couple of times I had ate at the old location my lunches were disappointing. 

The new location is really pretty and way more upscale then the old place. Lovely and inviting interior and very colorful as you would expect a Mexican restaurant to be. They have a large patio to accommodate many people for outside dining. I can see sitting out here on a summer evening with a refreshing margarita. 

We were quickly sat and our server was at the table right away with fresh chips and salsa. I really enjoyed the tasty salsa and the chips were the right amount of crisp, We then perused the menu for the lunch specials. We both kept it simple by ordering tacos but the menu selection and specials is vast. Our meals received two sides - rice and beans. After we ordered, we received a cup of sopa de fideo. Very mediocre but then it is pretty hard to beat my Grandma's homemade sopa. Our lunches came out quickly and hot. My dish was ok, but to be fair I was still getting over a cold and no food was tasting good that week. The service is where I want to rave. Our server was so kind, I wish I could remember his name. There were a couple of other gentlemen that came over to check on us as well making sure we were being taken care of and asking us how our meals were. I was really pleased with how attentive the service was and I will go back again to provide a better review on the food. 

The location is pretty easy to find however not super visible from the street. If you are familiar with this area of town, then you won't have trouble finding it.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,1,0,4,9m9iMUTVuotHfYxUmgHsEg
5663516,2018-03-09,0,nVHrMUiXqt3bMAia27gRhA,"We decided to try La Cabana based on the reviews so we ventured to west sahara to check it out. When you walk in you are greeted by these beautiful lights and wall hangings that could easily remind you of mexico.  We were greeted  by the hostess and soon our waiter brought out chips and salsa.  Our waiter was very attentive the entire meal. The chips were fresh and flaky and the salsa was very bland with a heavy garlic flavor.  We ordered and the waiter brought out a great sopa de fideo.  The broth was very tasty and well seasoned however it was lacking in the fideo (pasta).  We all 3 could have easily had another bowl of just the broth.  Well sadly it was down hill from there.
When our meals arrived all the food looked boring and you could tell that the rice and beans were not fresh.  Beans were over cooked and had been held for quite some time and some pieces of rice were hard and just had no flavor whatsoever.  Just a plain red tomato colored rice.  I have the ground beef burrito.  The burrito was filled with over cooked ground beef again with no seasoning at all.  it was very bland and not even the red sauce I had to pay extra for to make it a wet burrito could help this guy. The tortilla was also very chewy.  Uriel had the carne asada burrito and experienced the same thing. No flavor and no seasoning.  Ignacio had what were supposed to be poblano chile rellenos. But he said they were a frozen relleno and again, no flavor whatsoever.  I know this place has a lot of great reviews but there are just to many great places in town that are much better than this.  I guess the true test of a fresh made mexican restaurant is when the tell you they do not have any fresh whole jalapenos and they bring out the sliced ones out of a can.
