Streets of NY is among my favorite places for take-out pizza - it's delicious! I love the pizza - it's definitely more of a NY pie (a little greasy, thin, floppy) - but it's SOOO good. I've had both the supreme and pepperoni. I recently ordered the artichoke dip, which I'd skip in the future (a lot of calories for not a lot of taste)...

Is this a NY thing? I've been to NY numerous times in the past and loved getting a big slice of cheese pizza while walking down Time's square, I don't recall the crust being like a cracker or being cut into squares. I remember having to fold the slice to eat it and having gooey good cheese dripping off.

I came in to get my chicken wing fix because they closed the Hooters at Sunset station, and at risk of confusing you, the naked wings brushed with the honey hot sauce is only rivaled by B-dub's mango habañero and more manageable for the mild pallets out there. 
The fresh passion bread tossed in their garlicky butter and Parmesan cheese is the best rendition in the valley. 
I also had a slice of pizza with mushrooms but there is something else besides mushrooms and it the zing I experienced makes me think that what they have is better than any New York style.
The service is top notch. I saw 4 people grace my table of one as I enjoyed some NBA action. Loud enough to here commentating but not so much as to have to yell over surrounding clatter. 
For now, 5 stars until I revisit to try the rest of the menu. Since the stuff I had was surprisingly original and not like the hole-in-the-walls who serve the same bowling alley grease troughs.
Lastly, Jared, my server, made me feel right at home. Well, not really- I don't have servers at home, but welcomed I was. And between 3rd and 4th quarter, I saw the delivery driver in and out a couple of times. He must be really fast.

992683,2013-01-20,0,QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ,"I'm always excited to try new places, especially those close to home. We were headed elsewhere, but popped into Streets when we noticed they were open. The space is nicely decorated,  it offers a warm and welcoming atmosphere, with a large dining room and bar with a few taps. The sign suggested seating yourself so we grabbed a table in the center of the dining room.

We sat a little too long before someone came over. Our drink order was taken but we weren't certain what we wanted, a menu would be nice. He realized and brought two over. We had questions about slices that he couldn't answer. He walked off and I thought he was going to ask, but ended up on another task. Our waitress came over. Fortunately, she was able to help. Slices are pre-baked as cheese pizza and they add whatever toppings you like. 

She further explained they've been open two weeks in this location and the original location is up north. We mentioned this was our first visit and we'd like to know what's best to order. She suggested the slices, chicken parm, eggplant rollatini and a couple subs. I went with two slices: sausage and pepperoni. My husband chose the eggplant with penne.

Breadsticks were brought over with marinara sauce. The sauce was more of a paste which I don't care for, but my husband didn't mind it. The breadsticks were ok. Rosati's does these too and theirs are warmer, crisper and more chewy. They were too similar not to compare them. 

While we waited we noticed the restaurant had a lot of bodies, few customers (us and another table) and waits were longer than expected. I've never seen so many people moving about but doing absolutely nothing. Our waitress and the other checked on us periodically so service wasn't bad it just was up to par.

Finally our food was served. The pizza didn't look particularly appetizing, but I dug in. The sausage was terrible. I took two bites to confirm. It tasted like frozen pizza. My husband wouldn't even eat it and he eats most everything. He thought it tasted like microwavable pizza. The pepperoni was a bit better when loaded with chili flake. It was cooked more evenly  too. 

The pasta and eggplant rollatini were a bit better, but the eggplant wasn't heated all the way through. It was still cold in the center. We waited way too long and paid too much for what seemed to be microwaved eats. The bill was $23, usually I'd consider that pretty affordable, but in this case?  It was too much.

They have a lot of work to do. There are several solid pizza joints nearby, they will have to seriously step up their game to even begin to compete.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,13,1,1,rWwHEj5iAAB6PI6IZcEvyw

The other lady waited almost as long. She came back in to ask my opinion on her cheese pizza and I told her that yes it is overdone and that I wouldn't eat it. They were good about giving her a refund, but they can't give back her time loss. I think they might have given her some broasted chicken, because she didn't stick around too long after. Their excuse was that they were overwhelmed, but I thought to myself, ""self don't they have a time oven?""

It's got actual whole pieces of artichoke, which would be great except the artichoke is drenched in oil and completely flavorless. No bueno. The server immediately got us something different when she realized we weren't digging the spinach dip. She recommended pesto mozzarella crostini. That was very good. Really cheesy and fresh. Saved by the server!

Although I do wonder why they hide behind a New York subtitle, because it's better than any pie from back east. 
But all I got was a cheese pie. Mainly because the marriage between their pizza sauce and their mozzarella is a heavenly combination. And then when they jump onto  that pizza crust- the devil has to be jealous of that hotness. 
I do notice some subtleties of the dough make up. I do miss the New York-ish like thinness you get from a rolling pin. I can totally tell they're handling it completely by hand to tossing it. You can tell because it has a flaky like crispness reminiscent of Sicilian pies. It looks thicker but it's airy; no way like the travesty Chicago pies end up being. 
Either way, and whoever ends up making my pie, the sauce is delicious, the cheese is delicious, and these are the only slices where the crust disappears too.",dMEY3L5_h18ZFXivo8IYSQ,0,0,5,kt6ePn_O9-AfupX6DMXx7w

The house salad was good but I can make a salad at home.

The pizza was New York style think crust. Could've used more sauce and cheese but it was decent for what I paid.

My favourite thing was the pasta dish I got. It had sundried tomatoes, fresh mozerella, and garlic chicken. It was bomb!!!

Server was decent. She seemed a little peeved when I said I had a coupon. Oh well, still tipped on the full amount.

To be safe, I ordered a salad with no dressing and made my own of oil, vinegar, and lemon.

We ordered the pear and gorgonzola salad that was NOT easy on the eye. The greens were old and wilted with brown edges. When tasting the salad, it wasnt any better. The pears literally came out of a can! The best thing was the candied pecans. 

Now for the pizza. My gluten free pizza came to the table way over done, as I had to scrape off the burnt around the edges. The crust is my favorite part but couldnt eat it because it was burnt.The pizza sauce was extremely bland and may have come straight out of a can. The best thing about their operation is they have candle-lit pizza stands that help to keep the pizza warm on your table.

Another plus was the cleaniless and spaciousness of the dining room, after all it is a brand new restaurant. Their happy hour consisted of $1.00 off all beers, draught or bottle. Although the waitress did not know much about the menu, she was nice and apologized for my burnt pizza with a smile. Sorry, we will not go back, even if they run a groupon. There is just much better competition out there that I would rather spend my money on.",BbnxMn4ysHRqvXULXehwyg,2,0,2,aCqaWsBPVn5IJt44_OFXaw

2786204,2015-07-16,0,QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ,"DON'T ORDER DELIVERY FROM THEM! I've ordered from this place a couple times in the past year. Their food is tasty and something I crave every now and then. But after my most recent experience I don't think I will be ordering from them again. 

I placed a simple order of fries, spinach and artichoke dip, and kid's mac and cheese through GrubHub around 6:50 pm. I was quoted a prep and delivery time of 1 hour. Almost an hour and a half rolls by and no sight of the delivery. Called their sister store by accident, but they were nice enough to call the correct store and find out what was going on. The store stated that the delivery driver had already left and it would be there any minute. Mind you the store closes at 9:00 pm and I first called around 8:10-8:15 pm to check the status. 8:30 pm rolls by and still no delivery. I called the correct store this time and the guy on the other line apologizes and tells me the same thing. It wouldn't have been a problem if it weren't for the fact that they're located right down the street from my home! It's literally only a 7-8 minute drive from there to my place WITH traffic. 

Unfortunately for me, because I ordered through a third party and not directly through them, they couldn't refund me what I paid and what I tipped ahead of time. I didn't want a full refund anyways. Just wanted to remove the tip amount since I didn't feel like giving them extra money for a poor delivery service. The only option I had was store credit which I accepted for the heck of it. The delivery guy finally arrived just ten minutes before the 2 hour mark. There were no apologies from the driver for arriving so late. He just handed me the GrubHub paperwork to sign and off he went.

As expected, the food quality arrived slightly above room temperature. The spinach and artichoke dip tasted super sour and the bread it came with tasted stale. The mac and cheese looked and tasted as though they had left it sitting for awhile and then nuked it in the microwave before delivering it. It didn't even taste like mac and cheese. It was just penne pasta with a small amount of cheese drizzled on it. The oil from the cold soggy fries had seeped through the wrapper and immediately tore when I tried to take it out of the bag. Plus the drink that came with the mac and cheese wasn't even the correct drink and it was watered down by melted ice. It just seemed like they had made my food quite some time before the delivery was made and was just left to sit for awhile.

I've had better delivery experiences from Pizza Hut, and that says a lot with how crummy their deliveries are. Looks like that store credit is going to go to waste because I won't be ordering from them again.",xW_X0yteWRQGYd43V2pqTw,0,0,1,Nt8CvrcO5HCNqZcZIycIrw

Based on the pizza we got, I have a hard time believing the person that cooked it ever set foot in a pizza place anywhere in the NY/NJ area, ever.

We ordered a half meatball, half pepperoni pizza. We expected for the pizza to look at least a little like the pizza on the menu.  What we got would barely pass for Dominos, but for twice the price. Thick, doughy crust, sauce that was more like tomato paste than anything resembling sauce, and way overcooked cheese.  And ""meatball"" as a topping should be just that-sliced meatballs. Ground beef  spread over the cheese is not meatball.

Just really bad. I was hoping for another of a handful of NY style pizza places here in town. This establishment just doesn't cut it. We'll stick to our regular places.

FYI-we only had the pizza. For all we know the sandwiches or other dishes could be just fine. But for a place to call itself ""Streets of NY"" would imply a good pizza pie.  Which this wasn't.",nhxboACN_-bFGQHBTAr2DQ,0,0,2,xCUDGKnMc3NhnqLc4t6mbA

Ordered a white pizza with bunch of topings, wings and two cups of baked minestrone soup and one slice of pepperoni pizza.

Please do not bother with the pizza. It was probably the worst I've ever had. I'm from NY, this is not NY pizza. It was too salty, super soggy and too thick. 

Wings came cold

Mild sauce was absolutely nothing but vinegar. It was inedible. I think they make it in house so this must have been a bad batch. 

Single slice of pepperoni was pretty decent and crispy. 

Baked minestrone (with baked mozzarella cheese) was a bland soup with pieces of curdled cheese at the bottom of cup. Was not hot or warm. 

WORST customer service. Called to express disappointment with soup (anticipated that cheesy goodness) and the girl on the phone could not possibly have less ""I don't give a F"" in her tone.  ""Said OK thanks now we know. I don't know that cheese goes to the bottom of cup for deliver because"", and get this, ""no one has EVER ordered soup for delivery and we have no way of knowing"". I guess they do not bother to check the food before they send it out and it's impossible for them to lift a lid and make sure the food made matches menu description. 

Also please note that when you order ""kalamata olives"" you will get canned black olives. I don't think they know the difference between the two. 

I am across the street from them. We waited well over an hour for a delivery. Probably closer to an hour and a half--I will check the times. 

I am so angry that I spent $58 on this awful awful experience. I will definitely not EVER make that mistake again. What a waste of my money.

The pizza was good.  I prefer thick crust pizza but this was a credible thin crust pizza with a small amount of tomato sauce and more cheese and pepperoni.

I'm a sucker for any pizza place with great reviews.

This was my first time visiting this location but all of them are roughly the same. This Streets of New York is located across the street from Walmart and directly beside Veggie Street. 

Menu:
They offer a huge selection of New York style foods. They also offer a lunch menu and happy hour menu. 

I lucky made it just before the end of lunch and ordered a slice of pizza and wings. My pizza was so yum that I wanted another slice. They also offer 2 slice lunch special but I opted for one.

The next time,  I made it a bit more clear that I wanted thin and crispy crust to make sure I got it. We got a square cut (my fav for thin crusts) pizza full of toppings. Sadly,  I liked the regular crust better. The thin had very little flavor, and got mushy with the sauce after a bit. Bleh.

It was really good cold the next day though.

This restaurant is beautiful and spacious.

Beautiful tables and booths all dressed with candle center pieces, and of course, shakers filled with chili flakes and parmesan cheese. 

My son and I came here for lunch and we were excited. With a name like ""Streets of New York Pizza"" who wouldn't be excited to eat a slice? My son ordered the kids, in house made, ""Mac and Cheese""(refer to pic) which he enjoyed. It came with seasoned fried and a big bowl of mac and cheese.

I ordered a #3 which is ""2 Slices with 1 Topping""(refer to pic) from the lunch menu. The pizza came out, which i then asked for my usual ranch to accompany my pizza. I ask for ranch just in case the pizza is not flavorful enough. Surprisingly, this pizza did in fact, have LITTLE flavor. Which in my head, was absurd! I'm thinking, ""with a name like Streets of New York Pizza there's NO WAY i'm going to need this ranch!"". I was wrong. The crust was perfect. Nice and crispy, just the way i like it. But the pizza, just wasn't singing, like it should have been. A very big let down.

The tastiest food there was definitely the complementary ""Garlic Bread and Warm Marinara""(refer to pic). Woo Wee!! This stuff was awesome! The bread was sooo fluffy and flavorful, and The marinara was DELICIOUS! I would come back just for that.

The one thing i wouldn't come back for would be the service.The service here was just, eh.. I told the waitress that we have never been here before, and she gave us nothing. I asked her what they were famous for, or what was their specialty and again, nothing. I even went as far as to inform her that this location was not on Yelp and i would be adding them today, still nothing.

She handed us a stack of menus and said I don't know and then went made a phone call behind the bar.  We ordered and were ignored from the remainder of our stay.  There was a woman typing on a lap top singing to herself (looked like a manager of sorts) at the bar and the bartender who thought it was better to stare into space than to talk to the ONLY two people there.

We were pleasantly surprised with the looks of the place inside.   People were friendly and they were well staffed.   We figured that they were going to be getting busy with the amount of servers on duty.                We had 2 minutes left before happy hour expired, so we ordered appetizers on the special menu.   Drinks were served immediately and then the plates of yummy goodness started arriving.   First we received a basket of garlic bread knots with marinara sauce, a plate with ramekins of bruschetta AND hot artichoke dip served with seasoned sliced bread, then the garlic cheesy bread arrived.   Unbeknownst to us, they give an order of complimentary garlic knots for lunch and dinner.   The dips and garlic cheesy bread we ordered.....so our table was fit for appetizers for 4+ when there was only 2 of us.  So, we indulged in a bit of everything that we ordered and got free and we are pleased to say that  everything was delicious!    The hot artichoke dip was divine, the bruschetta needed a bit more seasoning, the garlic cheesy bread was true comfort food and the complimentary garlic knots were yummy.   The marinara sauce that came with the cheesy bread and garlic knots was  very nicely seasoned and made like home made, not like plain tomato sauce flavor you get at restaurants nowadays.   
     For our main meal we ordered the New York Combo which is their  ""Flagship Pizza""  It has a great medley of flavors including Italian sausage, pepperoni,
meatballs, along with mixed bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, black olives and mozzarella cheese. Simply put, it's great!   Along with the pizza we ordered Broasted Chicken!    I haven't had broasted chicken in years, and they had a special deal on the price if you ordered a 20"" or larger pizza.    Oh MY!!   The chicken was absolutely AMAZING!!   Needless to say, we took a lot home and left very full and happy.  
     We will definitely return and bring friends to experience the food with us.   They had pricing for ordering large amounts of broasted chicken (50 pieces) and I am going to order this for a special occasion we have coming up.    Many people have never even heard of broasted chicken and they will not be disappointed when they try it.

Having been tricked by the signs for at least that long now, if not longer, he thought it was open a couple of weeks ago and swung by on his lunch break to grab a few slices.  Sadly, the wait continued.  

Today we went for the first time at lunchtime.  The place was completely empty except for us and we were able to seat ourselves.  Plenty of seating, both tables and booths.  There are some flat screen tv's in the middle of the dining room.  Overall, decor was very nice and the place is spotless.  

We were greeted with smiles by the staff and immediately a waitress in training came over with her trainer to give menus and take our drink order.  

I tried 2 plain cheese slices and my husband had cheese ravioli with bolognese.  Before getting our meal we were given complimentary bread sticks, which were warm but a bit ""chewy"".  The marinara dipping sauce seemed typical but good.  

My husband enjoyed his ravioli and, for $8.95, it was a pretty decent sized portion.  As for the slices... well I expected to be more impressed by a place with ""New York"" in the name.  At the risk of sounding harsh, they were really no better than something I'd find at pizza hut, except maybe that the crust was a ""crust above"".  The slice was thicker than I'd hoped and there was this overly thick layer of cheese.  Definitely failed the cheese to sauce ratio that is so important to a slice of NY pizza.  The sauce was bland.  

I had an issue where they refilled my soda and it was just a watered down version of Coke.  I told my waitress and she apologized and offered to get me a new one, so no problem there.  But we were already out the door.

It is a quaint little spot and their staff is very friendly and helpful with suggesstions since we had never been there.  We had pizza and salad. Not sure it is like New York pizza but still very good...better than most places that claim the name or style.  I will definitely return and try other items on the menu.  Definitely reccommend this place!!",5XXg3gm8HGq7g7ZNe8X_kw,1,0,4,rw-L0NLn8a-HOl08Ls6OBg

We had the chicken parmesan, spinach and artichoke dip, lasagna, spaghetti, and salad. The spinach and artichoke dip was not as expected but it was delicious! Our kiddos loved the spaghetti and chicken fingers and our other pasta dishes were delightful. Only suggestion our salad arrived without dressing. I mean, who eats garden salad without dressing?? Luckily we had our own. Overall we were highly pleased with our meal. If you are craving delicious Italian eats, this place is great!",vSnYdIYsF6SJ7mHS9ESSjQ,2,0,4,fawMNmILlhkol8d4AO-wDw

The garlic bread and wedges that came with the chicken mix was pretty good. Some of the garlic bread was bit tough but still has a good flavor. The wedges are nicely flavored and crispy. Was a bit pricey but sort of worth it. Overall I give it a 8 1/2 out of 10.",x8su_76WAbnKlv9CZiZLrA,2,0,4,8Hq0iTfH98PgBFGfe20dfQ
5727140,2013-09-21,0,QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ,"I gotta say, we really like this place. We've ordered delivery from them twice. Their marinara sauce is damn good. Hubby likes the eggplant rolotini, and I've had their chicken parm and my daughter had spaghetti with sausage. The first time we tried their margherita on thin and crispy crust and didn't care for it at all. Too many tomatoes and the crust just seemed almost pre-made or packaged. Second try we had the combo pizza on regular crust and it was really, really good. Definitely our new go-to pizza/pasta joint. Oh and the girl over the phone already remembered me on my second call and was super friendly and helpful.",H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw,0,0,4,1i8Fpe5vziaZ9_KwmYGTmg

Perfect place to take kids or just go and have pizza and beer with friends.  Laid back, not formal, good value.  Lastly, I agree with other reviews that it is not true ""New York"" pizza if that is what you are expecting by the name, but still good.",maoBXt4RwbJv46QOoFm9Nw,0,0,4,7bEL53-4r27-2Gt12HcAFQ

5868924,2018-02-28,0,QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ,"My family is VERY familiar with this restaurant. We used to order delivery from here quite often since they first opened. When the food is done right, it is AMAZING. BUT, that only happens about 25% of the time. I am embarrassed to call them anymore as the notes in our account are probably the size of an encyclopedia. We have probably been credited so much money that it costs them more to answer our phone calls than what a week of profitable business brings in. Every person we have had interaction with has been very pleasant and understanding, and unfortunately even the store manager remembers us and we have only spoken twice. I am sad to say that the past history (spaghetti calzone orders, delivery times, order discrepancies, poor food) and with tonight's cold congealed toasted subs have brought us to the point of just being to tired to try again. I have no idea what has happened over the last six months, but our patience is gone and IMO the franchise owner needs to step in and do something. We cannot be the only persons that are being credited 75% of the time. I mean that our free credits are even being credited...I will end on a good note though, if you get a spaghetti calzone that is complete, it will alter your taste buds! Sorry to cut ties, but there are just too many other places that make the grade.",4nMuuWnro8loQQv9Q9I8Gw,1,0,1,UYglY-_GUG12xCcxsEffQA

5915290,2014-07-13,2,QnfAHUr5-HTiaA5-va3glQ,"I decided to hold off on the review until we actually dined in so we can give a full review experience. 

So SoNY is our default place for our take out. We have picked up pies here 4x and have been satisfied every time!! 
Crispy crust, gooey cheese and fresh veggies! Every pie that we have gotten for take out has been excellent. Yes, it is a bit more expensive vs the giant pizza chains there is no comparison when it comes to the quality. 

The same compliments aforementioned above cannot be said about the lunch spcials. We came in here for lunch and ordered the 2 slice deal. Like most places that offer by the slice, a blank pie is baked and the topping are added then rebaked. I understand this and it is fine however on our visit the slices that I got looked and tasted like they were we baked several times, the cheese was all brown and dry and the pepperoni were also dried out and crunchy; a total disappointment. 

Ordering a whole pie: 5 star
Lunch specials: 2 star
Service: 4 star

Final rating 3.5 star",E_Ts8j758tpiAZknHR7k4g,5,3,3,yODyKbZnLuXYWLEHSbN5lg

I went there tonight with a friend.   

The waiter ""Stirling""  was very nice and very friendly.   The food came out quick.. We both ordered the Chicken Parm with Angel hair.   The sauce was ok a little chunkier than I like it...  other than that it was great the drink cups were big and the Waiter kept them full.   The portion was really big which is good because I like to eat.   

I really enjoyed the food the atmosphere and the how friendly the staff was.   I will defiantly be back real soon! check it out!",fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,0,0,4,76nwAVlQT2nnEO97kSdNOw

We're originally from Chicago and have really missed the broasted chicken that was a staple there. The broasters at SONY are even better than the chicken we used to get back home. Our server, Sterling, made our dining experience even better. He greeted us as soon as we walked in, gave us menus and took our drink order almost immediately after we were seated. He was very pleasant and attentive. He's definitely an asset to this restaurant. We ordered potato skin appetizers that were some of the best I've had. Our chicken and broasted potatoes were piping hot. The chicken was moist and delicious and the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft and tasty on the inside. I have a feeling we'll be spending lots of time at this restaurant.",E95rnaSlscaxghXM62afpg,1,0,5,U4MpwlhSH2yc8yt0Ypx0Xg

I've tried almost everything on the menu from pasta to pizza and everything tastes fresh! The spinach used in the pasta is not frozen and the mushrooms are not canned!
