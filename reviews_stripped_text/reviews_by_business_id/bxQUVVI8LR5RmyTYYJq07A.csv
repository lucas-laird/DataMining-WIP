143661,2016-01-25,1,bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A,"Moved to Vegas about 3 weeks ago. Tried 4 American-Chinese fast food places and this is by far the best Ive found. 

Food was good. Lomein wasnt too saulty or too garlicky. Eggroll was fresh, crunchy, and the filings were not smooshy. Lunch specials (11am-3pm) comes with soup, eggroll, and rice. Super cheap at $5.99. Ordered to go. I appretiated that they packed the sweet & sour sauce separately and that they included utencils. I didnt get utencils in the other places.

Took 6 people told them the place looked pretty good! Got there and NO I was totally wrong! However still decided to order to try the food, while I was ordering my sister asked to use the restroom when she came out she told me to void my order to get my money back I asked why? She said these people have their meat in the restroom inside the womens restroom! She was making a pretty big deal of it and I kinda got embarrassed so I didnt ask for my money, we took the food to go and when we got to our hotel i decided to try every single thing and sniff it! And I swear to you not, the broccoli beef smelled like piss! Like straight out urine! It had a nasty texture and all! Threw all the food away! This place is seriously disgusting! I have no idea why it is graded an A with the meat inside the restroom!!!!!!! Save yourself time and money, do not go to this place!!!!!!",DzGDXYnRcuUJhSbyZOs99g,0,0,1,f67q2izl5y-JPf-XhHMXcw

Lemon chicken is spot-on in flavor, and perfectly crispy because they poked holes in the box lid. Good attention to detail!

Moo Shu pork is decent but not my favorite dish, served with pancakes that are reminiscent of tortillas. Healthy-seeming dish with lots of cabbage, mushrooms, and other veggies. Menu also offers steamed veggie and protein options for those seeking healthy choices.

But the won ton soup. Lord. The $5 bowl is huge, has 6 plump and stuffed won tons, but the broth is the star! Perfectly savory, probably packed with MSG, topped with a ton of shredded green onion. Perfect when you're under the weather.

EDIT: Subtracted a star for lack of consistency. Have gone back for the wor won ton soup, and the broth isn't as good and the wontons were soggy despite being allegedly  ""fresh made"".

1793945,2016-01-04,0,bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A,"I live down the street from Pearl Wok and finally decided to try them. Typically I only get Chinese take out from restaurants that offer noodles AND rice with the lunch special. Because it only comes with a very plain (but good) fried rice I ordered a side of plain noodles for $1.50. The total for my lunch came to almost $9. I will say you also get your choice of soup to go (unlike most places), and an eggroll. 

The food was really good. Even the eggroll which I don't normally eat. 

If you don't care about various offerings in a plate, this place is a must try for good Chinese.

 I would highly suggest Pearl Wok to also include noodles with their lunch. If they did I would give them all my business vs. my normal place.

2517074,2008-12-22,6,bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A,"So I'm on my way back from the DMV (that's another story for another day) and am hungry.  For anyone who doesn't know, they actually have a food counter at the DMV.  It reminds me of the food counter that used to be in the ice skating rink when I was a kid.  Well, the DMV food counter sends the smell of popcorn out into the crowd - perhaps to cover the stench of those who haven't showered for the day, week - whatever.  So this made me hungry enough to pull out my Blackberry and start searching for Chinese takeout on Yelp.

Thanks to location and the few reviews, I found the Pearl Wok.  
I ordered the $5.50 daily lunch which included egg roll, soup and steamed/fried rice.  Chose the Beef & Broccoli.  Also ordered an appetizer/side of (6) Chicken dumplings and had them steamed ($4.95).  The beef/broccoli was yummy - broccoli was cooked well and not fatty beef.  The fried rice was fried rice - not extraordinary but good nonetheless.  The dumplings (or potstickers, as I call them) were great but the best part was the dipping sauce.  That awesome homemade brown potsticker sauce that has fresh ginger and green onions ... oh so good.  And now here's my favorite part - when I asked for the hot oil - they had it!!  Some chinese places look at me like I'm speaking ... well, English .. when I ask for the hot oil.  I'm sure it has a name but I'm going with hot oil - the one with the chili pepper seeds.  Oh my, put a little of this on your potsticker and dip into the sauce ... oh my.  Obviously this is written by a girl who likes a little ""heat"" ....

Of note:  They offer free delivery with purchase of $15 within 3-mile radius.  I'd definitely order again.",u5BVBiS1l0VPD4JCx8NKiw,7,5,4,ZPC2_tvktfjSeY0An5qk4A

2838541,2015-03-23,1,bxQUVVI8LR5RmyTYYJq07A,"I just ordered here using Eat24 as I always do when I order delivery. I ordered the Kung Pao Chicken lunch with Wonton soup and Fried Rice, The Orange Chicken Lunch with Egg Drop soup and fried rice, and General Tso Chicken entree size.


I got the Kung Pao Chicken... it was in every single form bland. It had hardly any taste and the meat was fatty, very mushy. I asked for it with no peanuts and no celery, but they included those anyway. Strike one.

The fried rice was... Im not sure if it was actually fried rice or not. I saw NO EGG whatsoever, no veggies, nothing, just very dark colored brown (like almost burnt looking) rice. 

I ordered the Kung Pao with Wonton soup and got Egg drop instead, I hate egg drop, so I didnt taste it. Strike two. My brother says he has had better and that it lacked in flavor, and was salty tasting. 

My brother got the Orange Chicken, with the egg drop soup, and lucky him (or maybe unlucky him) he got my soup to since it was incorrect. The orange chicken which I snagged a bite of it. it was good.. BUT NOT ORANGE CHICKEN. It tasted like an orangey bbq sauce. It was weird, but still good. My brother agreed with me. The pieces were also really chewy, almost tough. Some were crunchy.. 

The egg rolls which were included were.. umm how do I put it... different. Yes different. They weren't bad, but they lacked in flavor.. well unless you like cinnamon, it tasted like they sprinkled cinnamon in their egg rolls, they SMELLED like cinnamon. They were sweet. and the cabbage tasteless. It was really weird. They were edible but I have had way way better. 

The General Chicken, was good, but again tasted like a faint bbq sauce which in all my years of ordering Asian Food I have never ever experienced.  The chicken again was really chewy, some bits crunchy, and fatty. After 3 chicken dishes I realize They must not use the best cuts of chicken here.The flavor was okay but didnt remind me of the general chicken Ive had from any other place, and I didnt really like it. Strike THREE! Annnnd they are OUT! 

I may as well of eaten the $20 I spent on lunch here it was a waste of money. Incorrect orders, the food was weird, bad cuts of chicken, it was all very very odd. I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone, and we won't be ordering from here again.

They did get it here in 20 mins, but still it was not worth it. I do however love how they delivered it (In a big paper bag, they put a piece of cardboard at the bottom to keep the food steady so it wouldnt spill) So two stars it is.",rHcUWmQ3nKJuT7G0z5kdug,2,2,2,_dUCT7o95EEgDmQR4rRvlQ

They cook all the food in an open kitchen that faces the counter, several times I've  walked in just as they were putting the final touches on my Mongolian Beef (My favorite) on a fired wok. 

The value is amazing (most dishes are under $8 and come with rice and an egg roll) and they can usually wip up your entire dinner for take out in under 10 minutes which makes it a faster than pizza joints and other take out I might consider. 

I don't want to be pompus, but I lived in China for a year and every menu item is 85% authentic, which is as close as you will get for Chinese food in the US (at least in my experience.

They delivered a couple of times and harassed me asking me if the credit card belonged to me and not my Mom! Yeah, it has my name on it. My Mom is in Texas and has a different name. Do you need her permission to sell me some greasy food which will keep me up all night and make me sick for a week? They called me 5 times before they brought the food which was sub par even for Vegas and that's an achievement boys and girls! 

Picked up food from there once and they left part of the order out but since I was doubled over from abdominal pains, I let them keep their little bonus. Everybody in the house was sick for days.

Still I give it five stars because of the price and the taste of the food.

I could definitely not taste any in there for sure. Great food, and friendly people. Good prices. Especially the lunch special!

The menu is pretty standard for Chinese takeout. I recommend the Hot & Sour soup, the Lemon Chicken (not overly battered) and the Kung Pao Chicken. The takeout menu is also marked with the owner's favorite dishes. Of these, the Sesame Chicken is my favorite. There are lunch specials listed, and anything that's not there, just ask for it, they'll make it if they can. The lunches also come with rice, an eggroll, and a small order of soup.

Portions are always generous and they never leave out the extra soy sauce, spicy mustard, and complimentary fortune cookies. And there's a nice big Buddha on the counter - good luck for us all.",c33Z36u5N8h5JgYsnweXlw,4,2,5,xtAKkM1rRMdCBF_9ULI3ZQ

Being raised in a Chinese household, I never saw the appeal of American-Chinese food. So yeah, ordering this is an adventure.

Chicken lo mein, kung pao chicken, beef and broccoli, fried rice, and complimentary egg rolls.

The chicken was of fair quality. The beef was sometimes fatty and chewy. The fried rice was absolutely doused in soy sauce.

I think every single dish tasted the same, save for some variation with the kung pao (peanuts and bell peppers have a strong taste). I'll never see the appeal in this cuisine, unless I give myself a generous service of siracha on the side. The fiancé was happy, so I'll bring this up to 3-stars for him. 

While the restaurant is run by Chinese cooks, the decor is outdated and the ceilings have water stains. They received an A rating, but the leaky ceilings are awfully suspicious and something they should to talk to their landlord about.",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,1,1,3,mByHUrQpvG4GrT_a8PIwuA

They are super fast - I can pick up my order in less than 10 minutes! One thing I love is you can turn any menu item into a lunch special... For $6 you get the meal, egg roll & choice of rice & choice of soup (even for to go!) They also have an entire healthy steamed section with wide array of veggies & choice of meat or tofu & I love having a healthy option!  The only reason I dropped a star, is that the storefront is tiny with just a few tables, so you basically must get your food delivered or to go. I live close so this is not an issue to me, but if I wanted the option of eating out, this is not a restaurant I would dine in.

What I mostly got was onions and a lesser amount of peppers in some sauce. One star for the eggroll - flavored with 5 spice powder and containing some meat it was better than almost all of the eggrolls I've gotten here, which are all pretty much the same eggroll over and over - vegetables, no seasoning and thus little flavor.

Maybe if I'd gotten a chicken dish it'd been better. Oh, and there was some soup...",Yx_Eu3rowxIOnGjmrtdvKQ,0,0,2,xTquMYtMxpdL2SgqKEEgqQ

I stopped on by here for lunch with Jen S. on Christmas Eve (12/24/10) because I was staying with her for the week while my family was out of state. We weren't sure what to get and I was dying for something hot and spicy, and cheap. Luckily, Pearl fit the bill. I ordered the $5.50 lunch special - Mongolian Beef (ordered with double the hot red peppers because I love them!) wonton soup, steamed rice and an egg roll. 

Holy moly, do I love Mongolian Beef. It's my go to dish. It was scalding hot when I got it and it was so spicy, my eyes were about to burst - just how I like it. I crave those hot red peppers. The meat was so tender and yummy, I want to go get some right this second (too bad it's so far away from my house!)

The eggrolls, which I usually never like at any place, were pretty good. The soup was also good, but one wonton was under cooked so the wrapper tasted a little doughy, but that's okay. 

Jen ordered the broccoli chicken. I ate her leftovers a couple days later, and it was okay, so I'm not factoring that into this review. 

The fact I want to go get more of that Mongolian Beef, and have wanted to for the past four days should attest to the fact that Yay! I'm a fan. Four stars!",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,5,2,4,jcxX6SDXMY-AXrGCElXEYQ
