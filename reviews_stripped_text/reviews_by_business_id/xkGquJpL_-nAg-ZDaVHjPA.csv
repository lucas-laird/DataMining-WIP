My boyfriend and I split the Reuben on rye with a side of potato salad. We also ordered two drinks and only spent $15. The Reuben was delicious, I couldn't have been any happier with the sandwich. The potato salad was also excellent and made a filling accompaniment. We left with full bellies, wallets intact.

The pastrami was also very greasy but dry and extremely fatty. The cheescake was plastic wrapped on a paper plate cafeteria style and was not very good. It almost seemed like it wasn't baked.

Thoroughly confused?  Here's the explanation:

When playing poker at MGM (and clocked in with your MLife players card), you'll earn $1 an hour at the $1/$2 table, or $2 an hour at the $2/$5 table.  That might not sound like much, but it actually adds up pretty quickly and unlike regular MLife comp dollars, these NEVER expire.  After wracking up those dollars, see the floor man for your running total, and to redeem a voucher for discounted or FREE food at Stage Deli.  He'll even have a Stage Deli menu available with all the item pricing (including tax) so that you can have that voucher printed out for the exact desired amount.

Sometimes during a long poker session, you might not feel like taking a long break for a fancy lunch or dinner.  A quick, simple sandwich might hit the spot, and that's exactly what Stage Deli offers, in addition to soups, salads, breakfast, drinks and desserts.

The service is extremely fast, moderately friendly, and the sandwiches are reasonably priced ($8.95 to $10.25).  All meats are delivered from the East Coast.  The taste is...  Acceptable.  Do expect to dress your sandwich up a bit with the provided condiments, and donn't expect to be blown away by quality or uniqueness.  Speed and simplicity should be what is appreciated at Stage Deli.",5Af5mVbYDRQ_24dBFfMgmg,9,8,4,2OYuXNFM3d155VdIoK7bIQ

Salads come with one dressing but we were able to get another one, and even with two, half the salad was dry and ended up in the trash. They're large salads, but all lettuce, not much else. For the price we should have gotten a great salad, these were just meh. The Mister had a pastrami sandwich and wasn't thrilled about it. Said it was okay, and he's far from a picky eater!

The dressing came on the side, so I was able to put exactly how much I wanted on top. 

I also ordered a side of potato salad and a Dr. Brown's Ginger Ale. The potato salad was better than average. The Ginger Ale tasted too 'dry' for me, and I would have preferred Canada Dry. 

The service was a bit of a challenge to deal with. As I was ordering, the clerk would yell over to the cooks item by item. My order could have been taken more efficiently if she would have listened to my whole order and then told the cooks what to prepare. It took a lot longer to order than it should of, and she was already taking the next person's order before she gave me my receipt.

My plan was to grab a quick bite somewhere since I knew I'd later have to take up the challenge along with the rest of my friends to knock out bottles and bottles of drinks along with 40+ drink tickets we received for the VIP bottle service we requested that night. 

Stage Deli serves as a casual dining spot for those looking to get a quick bite to eat in between gambling, shopping, bar hopping and what not. Located in between the nightclub, Rainforest Cafe and the MGM casino, this place is definitely easy to find. The prices here are very reasonable compared to other MGM dining spots and they are also quick in preparing their sandwiches. After placing an order on a Reuben sandwich, the order was quickly prepped and ready to eat in a matter of minutes which was perfect! I actually liked the sandwich and how tender, juicy and flavorful it was! It's definitely no Earl of Sandwich,  but it's decent and not so bad as others have expressed.

So the guy decided to slice 3 pieces of cheese put it on a plate and wrap it in clear plastic. I didn't find out until I took it to my room. 


The only reason this is a 3 star review and is because the sandwich was good. I asked what was in the sandwich after I paid and the lady sighed and said just lettus. Who wants to eat a sandwich with just meat and lettus. How hard is it to say ""would you like tomatoes and onions?"" especially if your paying $9.50 for a sandwich.

Limited seating.  I sat in the sports book area adjacent.  

Accepts credit cards.  Had a few other sandwich choices - Reuben, pastrami, turkey.  A pre-packaged salad.  Krispy Kreme Donuts.

5275766,2009-01-12,1,xkGquJpL_-nAg-ZDaVHjPA,"I was staying at the MGM Grand this past weekend.  I was playing poker for most of Sunday, but around noon I needed a little something something while waiting for dinner later that night.  The Stage Deli was right there near the poker room and there's no line.  Close and easy, two of my favorite characteristics of a restaurant.  So I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich.

The sandwich was expensive - nearly $8.00.  Kind of to be expected in a casino.  OK.  I can deal.

I'm not sure I would actually call the meat inside the sandwich chicken.  It was some sort of processed, white, rubbery chicken imposter.

((pause))

I paused for a few minutes to think of some other substance on the planet that I could liken this chicken to, and I can't.  It must be from another world.

It was absent of any flavor, and had it not been for the lettuce, tomato and mayo i put on the sandwich, it may have been one of the least flavorful lunches of all-time.

The sesame bun wasn't very fresh.  It had that ""I've been sittin out for several hours"" taste to it.  And the pickle that accompanied the ""sandwich""  wasn't cold and fresh; it was luke-warm and limp.

A complete let-down.

To make matters worse, the girl who took the order barely stopped talking in spanish to her cooks standing a few feet away.  I ordered and she talked right through the order.  Pretty freakin' rude if you ask me.
