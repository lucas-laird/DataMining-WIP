I got the chicken sinugba (the pork was sold out when I went - obviously it's popular!), and it was a fantastic choice. My friend got the lumpia and said that had an amazing flavor, as well.

We didn't have any cash and luckily this cute little Filipino food truck accepted credit cards. We are so glad this was our first stop, since it was the best truck that we tried of the entire night. 

The BBQ pork belly sandwich sounded like it was right up our ally. The sandwich looked simple and there wasn't anything else inside the sandwich except for pork belly, but it was love at first bite! It was packed with delicious flavor - salty, sweet, really moist and tender like butta! It was satisfying and addicting. I enjoyed it! If sandwiches aren't your thing, you can totally get it on top of rice as well. 

We've also tried their lumpia which are Filipino egg-rolls filled with savory meat. They were bite sized and absolutely addicting! Hot, crispy and filled with bold comforting flavor. They also came with a tasty sweet and sour sauce to dip them in.

I would love to try their other offerings, their menu isn't big at all - probably 5 items at most.

The service here is like family! Oming (the chef) and Naz (runs the front) are super genuine and awesome foodies as well! We loved chatting it up with them about great local food finds and about where we've eaten since we moved to Vegas. Their passion of food shines through in their delectable bites that they offer on their truck! I even overheard customers eating in front of the truck saying their chicken adobo is crazy tender and flavorful. Definitely come check them out!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,7,6,5,-HDVC47GdxsG9fX8W1JHkQ

I got my Pork belly combo with lumpia. The pork is cooked thoroughly and even has a char taste which I was surprised, I thought it would have been marinated in some sauce to mask the flavor of the meat but it was quite tasty this way! The bowl cost me around $12.

After being burned out on Burger Fest, Taco fest, sausage fest (the only food trucks that are ever on campus) trying this truck was a no-brainer. I'm glad I did, this is delicious! 

The only reason I didn't give this experience 5-stars is due to the price. The combos are $12 dollars ($13 if paying with credit) and are about the same size as a bowl from panda express. Options are pork belly or grilled chicken with lumpia and rice. I got the chicken and lumpia combo.

He really enjoyed the glaze on the pork belly and ate all of the lumpia asap. They were super hot and fresh so he was mad because he wanted to eat them faster xD  

The glaze on the pork belly is very sweet. It needs something to cut through the thick sweetness, it's a very rich sweetness. Without the lumpia, he says, the taste would have gotten to be too much. It was $12 and my boyfriend was completely stuffed. He actually ended up taking some leftovers home.

The menu is basic but quality. The lumpia is delicious, addictive like most lumpia. We would come back but we wish it were a tiny bit cheaper. Good service though! :)",giZgTnDxds-FQLi7nBxsBA,7,4,4,v8LaWGYONiiMuDwTx-9GNg

Oming's Kitchen is a Las Vegas food truck dishing out Filipino cuisine. They've been at Great American Foodie Fest several times, and my friend was interested in trying them today. I didn't even remember having them before, so I guess that's the kind of impression that they left at that point.

They didn't have the sandwich that I evidently tried last time, so it was pretty obvious that we had to get the Pork Belly Combo ($13 at event premium price). This is a rice bowl with their signature pork belly and six lumpia. The pork belly was still more chewier than it really should be, but it was tender enough that I didn't mind. The sweet sauce on the pork belly was excellent and carried the dish. The rice was cooked properly, which is to be expected if not demanded. As for the lumpia, they're tiny, thin and vegetarian, but they lend enough crunch and flavor that they're enjoyable.

This is a proper four-star rating this time for Oming's Kitchen. They're not perfect, but they're one of the better food trucks at Great American Foodie Fest and in Las Vegas in general.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,8,4,l-MrbiASvQ6Plb708sSaqQ

I went for the Chicken Combo which included chicken, white rice, and Lumpia. So simple and yet so flavorful. The chicken had a great marinade on it and the perfect amount of char. The chicken flavor and char worked it's way nicely into the perfectly prepared sticky rice. The lumpia was also very tasty and had a nice crisp on the outside. I really enjoyed the sauce that came with the lumpia as well.

Last week I tried the pork belly for the first time and loved it! It kind of put me off since I really wasn't sure I wanted something that said it was from a ""belly"" but after someone explained to me what it tasted like, I decided to give it a try. Glad I did!

All I could do was thank her.   Because it was hitting the spot at a time where there was nothign but hot dogs and pizza slices all around the show.    

The marinade reminded me of a sweet teriakyi jerk flavor, but also this had just a nice and subtle punch of heat and more flavor.    I believe that would be the 22 hours it was marinading though.
