I ordered a California burrito and all it had was meat and rice on the  inside.  My sons rolled tacos were stale.  My husband spent $9 on carne asada fries...basically fries with halfway melted cheese and skimped on the meat.  I didn't trust actually eating any of the food, so we just threw it all away.",Kto_EVYkya-RcHsLkuXQyw,0,0,1,pX3nUvm19pp49iX3jKSwKA

Tacos are legit.",tcYeVBtwYty07akw3kbmxQ,0,0,5,xH1jxNmMVRykb5Qsyj8WtA
2626738,2017-10-08,0,kMGfuOZeBDNQJ4_pBjE26Q,"I placed an Uber Eats order for two Carne Asada plates. When I received my order, I was given two Carne Asada Fries. When I called the restaurant to address the issue, the employee insisted that I placed Carne Asada fries. She continued with stating that it was two Carne Asada Fries that came to the total of $23. Carne Asada Fries are $9 each, therefore two Carne Asada Fries would not be $23. I was not given an option since the restaurant does not deliver. I was also not given the option of being given a refund. Terrible customer service. I was not given a solution for the establishment's own mistake.",DCZLJP7mDCD9Vld2ehydBw,0,0,1,UXJezS_Fu7w2AEl6oKwydg

When i first walked  in on Sunday afternoon I walk up to the menu but before I could even do that the lady asked me what I wanted ,i told her can you give me a min I'm looking . She replied ""what?! "".Don't tell a customer what. Use your professionalism and simply say excuse me I couldn't hear you . I know the ins and outs of the culinary industry customer interaction is important. So i finally ordered one torta cubana and two carne asada tacos, the wait was 10-15 mins. That's way to long lol I suggest before you open try and prep most of your ingredients already so You won't have that problem, if it would of got busy you guys would of been in a lot of trouble. Last the food , the food was very bland salt can go along way ,even my torta was very bland even with the salsas you provide. There's hundreds of taquerias in Las Vegas  if you wanna stand out you need to be on top of your game in every aspect of the restaurant business. I hope you  don't take my review as a bad review but instead of a learning review. Yelp is here to help your business not destroy it okay . I will come back if you make these changes god bless.",2V_oIMdrPBsq5u8rXACG2A,0,0,1,aS5ZdMOPbQGfrbP4RfiPSQ

I love their bistec ranchero and my friend loves their fish tacos, even if its a little spicy. I've gotten Horchata from them but its not that great. But its always a fast delivery because they are right there. Their food has been good so far! Keep it up.",UiDMyonfkwPB_OhfKn3CAg,0,0,5,LDCr0WYUj3StqhrFXog0qA

We passed by once and noticed it, ran our errands and decided to stop on our way back. It was definitely worth stopping, we couldn't believe how amazing and REAL the food was. I grew up with these flavors, you can taste the care the cook had in making the food. Met the owner and the girl up front was awesome. My wife asked for lime wedges and the girl said one minute let me cut you some, my wife saw her go wash her hands and then cut the limes. we live in henderson and we will definatley go back and take that 35 minute drive and tell all our friends about it.",eBfAyDvKDzvY2fXa24xlYw,1,0,5,72fV8KgVAuEGPZ82GF_1ng
