Bartenders were very unresponsive to us due to them wanting to party with their friends. The bartenders were doing shots during working hours. not sure if that's even legal in the state of Nevada drinking on the job. I would of been good if they got me a drink when I asked for it. After all I'm a paying customer. And local as well. When I tried to say something about it. One of the other bar tenders wanted to manipulate me into not saying anything to the manager with a shot or a free drink. I told him it's that that I want a free drink I wanted good service. The mangers came by and apologize and said he was going to talk with the bartender who was doing shots while on the job with his friends. That bar tender came over and smeared to apologize for the mis understanding. I told him there was no mis understanding he was just not willing to wait on anyone else but his friends. He said whatever with a big attitude and walked away. I will never return to the Phoenix for the poor service they provide. Being local there are plant of other options with great service. Flex, fun hog ranch my favorite, free zone, quad, among others. A business should cater to everyone not just their friends.......",3F5h5f5Lp643kRl7_lL7LQ,1,0,1,AiyvEgAT_fr652ioTUstoQ

On Saturday night may 17th we had a large group
Go to the bar because we heard they had a 
Dj.  We requested a few songs and he played them with attitude
However when asked to play a third song he said
No because he had not gotten tipped and was very rude. 
We tip very well and he would have been very happy

The drag show was cool, definitely liked the performers. Hahaha... They play games with their audience. What was hilarious was that they do birthday shots, which my boyfriend had to partake in 'cause his friend ratted him out. Also liked the friendly staff at the bar.

At first, you don't really know what you're getting yourself into when you walk through the wildly painted enclosure. Unleash the power of the spray painted Phoenix!!! Once inside you are greeted by delightful LED lights and strange pieces of art throughout the establishment. The bartenders are always pleasant to look at and my do they like to booze you up (one of my favorite things). There's a stage to one side with a mike overlooking a smooth dance floor, Couches for audience members and booths for nom noms decorated with exotic images of fire spinners. On the other side you find more comfy couches where you can destroy people at some super smash bros wii....if you look closely you'll see a collection of hulahoops just in case you're feeling frisky enough to give them a whirl...towards the back you'll find a massage chair- 1 dolla make you holla...2 moh will probably make you snohhh  oh...and a schmokes vending machine for when needed..(there is something sexy about smoking and gambling right at the bar)--last time i was there a man won about 5 hundo.

We couldn't figure it out as it has no name posted outside. We would make wild guesses like a secret  society meets here or a super Asian nightclub or....we were just so confused. 

Then one day with nothing to do and happen to be driving by we thought ""let's check out that fire pheonix place with the colorful ball lamps."" Lol. Well, excitedly we pulled in, walked up and opened the door to the greetings of a giant rainbow flag. Ohhhhh....that makes sense. We had a good laugh as we finally figured out what this place was. We popped our head in to check it out then kindly left as we weren't feeling a bar scene at the moment (I think it was 6pm at the time).

So we leave and look this place up online, since now we knew the actual name. Then to our glory we saw the burner Mondays flyer. So excited to see burners outside of Black Rock City; We returned the following Monday. I will say it takes a bit for the regulars to warm up to you because they are literally there every Monday (or more). But the rest is history. 

Bottomline: 

Fun place. Lots to do here...drink, video poker, play pool, sing karaoke, play video games and be gay. Happy that is. Well in both respects.

The locals come here for many good reasons--friendly staff, cheap drinks, accepting cards (unlike others that only take cash), themed nights, and so much more. I'm impressed with all that there is to offer here!

Shawn is one of the owners and is always receptive to feedback and opinions. He makes sure everyone feels welcome and is having a great time.

If you're needing a snack before drinking, the kitchen is open 4pm until late. On Tuesday nights, my favorite, there are Smash Bros. tourneys--free of charge--and you can win bar tabs and gift cards! Definitely follow The Phoenix Bar on FB to see all the upcoming events!

Overall, still a 5/5 star rating. I'll always come here first unless my friends are dragging me elsewhere. Keep up the great work!

(Original review below, posted fall 2015)

I recently moved to Vegas from a small town in South Carolina. I had heard about Phoenix being very gamer-friendly, so I went one afternoon and didn't have a great experience. Turns out, it was just bad timing on my part and a slight miscommunication with the staff!

Since I've settled in my new apartment, I quickly learned that Phoenix is THE BEST gay bar in town. This is the consensus from both visitors and the locals! Drinks here are extremely reasonably priced (in other words, cheap!) and unlike certain other bars in town, they WILL accept credit and debit cards to keep your tab open. Yes, I've been to certain places here that were strictly cash only... Dislike.

I highly recommend coming on a Tuesday evening (after 7PM). The LV Gaymer group is really welcoming of new faces, and they love playing Super Smash Bros. (Wii U) on the projector screen--which obviously means they have good taste! This is a fun place for easy Streetpassing, and as a side note, the staff here work very closely with the LV Gaymer group. More and more events are held here at the Phoenix and I only see them both growing at this rate!

Be sure to follow and like their page on Facebook! They're actively posting with updates and events so you will know when are the best times to stop by!",YYTgfKDiTWJ0bx3LuRP9OQ,4,1,5,gSB52st9_pwP8Epoy09Yig

The atmosphere in this place is always so friendly, and you show up for a good flirt and not have to worry about getting creeped on by the gender you weren't targeting, if you know what I mean.

Another major aspect of this place for me, is the totally Safe vibe I get here. I've had my drinks roofied before in other places so I can get a little paranoid, especially if I'm somewhere alone. But I don't have that problem here! Time and time again, this bar, its staff, and its patrons have shown me that this is somewhere I can let my guard down, even if it's only to get a dance in.

I also happen to be a Burning Man habitué, and this cozy neighborhood gay bar also happens to be Burner-friendly (they host a lot of Burning Man-friendly events). So I feel doubly comfortable here!

Very reasonably-priced drinks, great food, al fresco patio and roomy interior, with lots of theme parties and karaoke nights.

However, they typically will let you buy up on 2-for-1 happy hour drinks before the cutoff if you get there early. 

The local clientele is fairly low-rent. Many regulars that can be gruff to meet initially, but may warm up later, maybe. 

Some of the bartenders are friendly, and some of them not-so-much, especially if they don't feel that you've tipped them according to their expectations. Bartenders bring a lot of their friends in here so don't expect a warm welcome if you are not part of their clique. 

The section of town is so-so. Some of the worst neighborhoods in LV are right near here, but some of them are not so bad. 

Food is decent, but not really in-line with the finances of the local clientele. Thumbs up on the taconauts. 

Have had some unnecessarily rude interactions with the KJ over issues(feedback) that was not my fault. If it rains or the humidity gets high, the AC leaks onto the stage right near mic. 

Some bartenders may skip jukebox songs that you paid for that they don't happen to like. The music, particularly the sub, has been cranked up way to high on multiple occasions. 

I have never felt that the bar was particularly smokey, although this does seem to be a common complaint. They do run fans and smoke eaters and AC. This is definitely a smokers' bar - be prepared for this if you plan to go.

It is hard to tell from the outside that this place is open(particularly during the day), but it is open 24/7. If the door is locked, ring the bell.",xFWfc4ZaUJFHbIgtBWhEaA,5,0,2,8ysE7gQET4rnbc-qhkv_wA

From cheap drink and food options, to attractive dancers and great music, the Phoenix offers a little something for everyone. 

Most recently I was there for a viewing party for RuPauls Drag Race. They had plenty of screens for the show, spaces for seating, and a drag queen for commentary.

I have been frequenting Funhog Ranch for over 10 years, and seriously like that place, but Phoenix seems like the bar was made specifically for me!

My friend and I went 11/11/2017 (Saturday morning) after my car broke down the street. 

We got there around 8 O'clock in the morning because the mechanic was just a block away. 

We were greeted by Estefano as a bartender. He was incredibly friendly! Seriously, the nicest, most friendly bartender I have ever had at any bar, period. 

Since the bar was empty, Estefano sat next to my friend and I while we played pool, and talked to us about his life, the bar, the events at the bar, and many other things. It was really nice of him to do that for us, and it was definitely appreciated. 

I think the drinks are fairly priced. Many people complain that the bar's drinks are a little at the pricey side, but I think they're priced just right. People, you have to keep in mind that this bar has invested lots of capital not just in the bar, but also in the games, atmosphere, and all the events they have DAILY. (There are events going on EVERY SINGLE DAY of the week!) The bar has a couple of pool tables, a dart board, and a giant projector screen with games for Wii, PlayStation, and Xbox. On top of that, they have fantastic graffiti inside and outside of the bar. For the atmosphere, and all the extra things they offer, I think the drinks prices are perfect. 

My friend and I ended up playing Marvel VS Streetfighter for around 8 hours. We were there for so long, Estefano left his shift, and met a new bartender. (I think his name was Shane?) Sean was an excellent bartender as well, not as extroverted as Estefano, but was incredibly sweet and thoughtful. He kept coming to our table by the projector screen to ask us if we wanted any more drinks whenever the place wasn't busy. 

The atmosphere. Well, this is what I loved about this place. I'm gay myself,  but the friend that I was with isn't. The crowd is a very diverse crowd of races, genders, and sexual preferences. He met a few cool girls and myself a few cool guys. The clientele was equally friendly. 

We ended up staying here aaaaaall Saturday long. From 8am to around 11pm that night. And now we go everyday. (We're huge nerds and love the video games and table games they have.) 

Phoenix, excellent job at hiring great people. Other people have mentioned that the bar and bartenders are ""cliquey"" but I personally never experienced that. They were super friendly! At the end of the night we had about 15 people surrounding us playing games with us, including some of the staff.

Love the owners and now their kitchen is open!! Great food cooked by Gary and his crew. Do yourself a favor and try the Taco Nauts but all the dishes I've tried are delicious.  The mural on the building rocks.  They have fun events all week long. You can play Wii on a big screen with your friends, beer pong and pool are there as well.  The juke box takes your picture! The bartenders could use some urgency during service but that is my only critique. Stop in for a good time and wonderful food!",Rt2bGBdgwBdi2pBot6MwPg,5,1,4,-L2ndquFPGtKwBI0KNOspg

There was an amazing special around New Years, where they were giving out wristbands for $10 for AYCD until midnight. I was here for a few hours just hanging out, and, if you're not a fan of smoky environments, you would absolutely hate this place. I'm not sure if its the lack of air ventilation, but it was by far one of the smokiest bars that I've been to in town. 

A great place to come with small group of friends to chit chat. There were some dancers, but I wasn't paying too much attention. I would come back since it's one of the few bars that actually has a dance floor.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,2,3,VbQaeg5yWFw6mNEwIm3bLA

Those are the only two options here at the Phoenix where drinks are cheap, activities are everywhere and food is delicious. Whats awesome about the Phoenix is that even though its a gay bar, a straight guy like me can go and enjoy because they are inclusive of everyone, which is not something I can say for all gay bars believe it or not. This place has existed for years, but I never even considered it until the new owner took over. They repainted with some sick art that catches your attention when you're driving bar. They host a lot of special events and whatnot here, so anytime you come in, you see anything from karaoke to car washes, to everything in between. The drinks are more than reasonably priced, the bartenders make sure your cup is always where it needs to be, and last but not least, they have SUPER SMASH BROS!!!!!!!! I didn't realize it until i came here, but drinking on a couch and playing Mario Kart with my friends is quite possibly a pastime that every needs to adopt. They recently added a kitchen, and I can get all culinary on you but ill say this: open your mouth, put a taco-naut in there, cha it, swallow it, then profess your undying gratitude.
Overall, this place has an incredibly authentic vibe. Its always buzzing, and unlike almost every other bar in town, I've never met any belligerent, drunk idiots here. The patrons to the bartenders, to the owner, everyone is always in a good mood here. I've never had a bar that i call ""my bar"" but this is about as close as any bar will get to that status.",KyMkKb5IohKb0S7v4Jv-oA,7,6,5,nZ36PJDHQReYsvEbSRX1dA

Plus the grill is open, and Lando and Gabe promise an awesome experience. You've been warned; miss this one and you'll kick yourself! He spins at DISTRIKT.",nq6zoRgcesFA46TefSDP6Q,0,0,5,--0lKeKQHBYT6Wh6ziEmqQ
