I try to pick up poke atleast once a week but damnn its gotten expensive. Its not the owners fault cause the price of tuna has gone up everywhere, so instead of ordering a pound i'll order just half a pound for lunch. My favorite here is the limu poke and limu tako, it taste sooo good. Some days when you come here you'll see fresh fish on display(parrot fish,kala fish) great for grilling. The owners are also very nice people thats why i've been coming here for years.",L37Sl7MNYnyugc-682LQwA,0,0,4,ZcycJcMVCuXBaStXijRYVw

I got the Shoyu Ahi, and a Spicy Ahi Poke bowl. Both selections were really good and made in small batches to keep everything fresh!

90401,2012-10-26,0,pi4FLFEOn9AhNUxiLbBeHg,"Poke was on the extensive list of foods that some college friends and I wanted to try, but never did. When I found Hawaiian Style Poke, I felt guilty at first, but that went away once my stomach took control of any thought. Sorry about that, friends. Kinda... no, not really, I take that apology back.

About the somewhat hidden location, it's neatly tucked into the side that borders Wynn Rd and is across the street from 99 Ranch. There's parking in the front or on the street, but sometimes it's difficult and frustrating to manage. I parked in Chinatown Plaza and walked over.

At first glance, their selection seems limited and looks like there isn't much poke left, but I'd take quality over quantity any day. Also remember that it's deli-style and there isn't an indoor dining area, so you'll be taking your order to go. They sell the poke per pound and have smaller 1/4 or 1/2 pound containers for those who want single portions. With my order ringing up to $8 at 1/2 pound, I could hardly wait to take my poke home to devour.

Back to the important stuff: the poke. Mmm spicy ahi poke. Fiery enough to feel the burn while still being able to relish the fresh tuna! The fish was cut up into bite-sized pieces and mixed with the right amount of chili oil, sesame seeds, and onions. Usually, I'm not a big fan of raw onions, but they were a little sweet and provided a crunchy contrast in texture. I liked eating it plain or adding a dash of light soy sauce. 

Curious about the other types of poke they have, so a future trip is definitely in the works.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,4,2,4,dxWkKadKxUEcRtavcQdhkQ

We got there around 11:30 but a lot of the trays were running low (maybe they were still prepping for the day?). They had the limu which I wanted to try so I wasn't too bummed. The fish tastes very fresh and since it is marinating in the sauce it has more flavor right away (unlike Island Sushi). Also got the Kim Chi cucumber and seaweed salad and they were both really good.

FOOD-The poke is so yummy. I absolutely loved every item that I  purchased.  I always go for the ahi shoyu poke and the ahi oyster poke, those are my faves!  I also purchased the poi, which was expensive but well worth it!!  Everything was good.

Hubby and I decided to try this place after our drive from LA to Vegas.  It got high ratings on Yelp and we were in a poke kind of mood.  The restaurant is easy to find and when we arrived, we were welcomed by a bright open space with a large cooling case with a small selection of poke.  The majority of the space is taken up by the kitchen/behind the counter area.  There is also a small gift case and some chips and other munchies hanging on the wall.  A refrigerator also has some Hawaiian Sun and other drinks.

After looking at the Poke Bowl menu, we decided to share:

Furikake Poke
Spicy Ahi Poke
Seaweed Salad

We ordered to go since there wasn't anyplace inside to eat and it was 100 degrees outside.  When we started eating, I noticed that the cold poke was placed on top of hot rice so the bottom of the fish started to cook.  I also noticed there was not much fish and about 5 times as much rice.  The poke bowls are $8.95 and a pound of poke is ~$14.  Based on the amount of fish we got, we would've been much better off ordering by the pound.

The seaweed salad was 2oz and $3.95.  Definitely not worth the price.

The poke itself wasn't bad, but definitely not worth the price they are charging.  We won't be back.",K7vTmYHTnr0fjw807c8E2w,3,0,2,Y4WnjCRaqHm5zGYdc5Y19A
1096666,2013-06-05,0,pi4FLFEOn9AhNUxiLbBeHg,"Being from Hawaii I was SO happy I found a place that sold poke like places back on the island. So this was a great find. We got the spicy ahi, tako poke, lim and shoyu ahi. All delicious. The ahi was fresh and so yummy! The tako poke was good but I've had better. If you are a tako lover this is not the place for you. But the ahi....love,love it.  The only disappointing thing for us was the boiled peanuts. I was excited that they sold them but they were MOLDY! Could not eat them and I've been so busy I haven't got a chance to return them. That is why one main reason I didn't rank this place so high. How can you sell moldy food? Hoping to give this place another try and hopefully they will redeem themselves. 

Update***
Went again the they were nice enough to replace my moldy boiled peanuts. And now I'm hooked! Need to get my fix of boiled peanuts and now I have some where to go. The tako poke is still eh...I've had better. The pieces are too small. Fish is yummy. A bit on the expensive side but just to get access to poke close to home can't complain too much.

1352508,2014-01-24,0,pi4FLFEOn9AhNUxiLbBeHg,"Located across the street of Wynn from Chinatown where 99 Ranch is located, its a small poke joint that is something we need more of in Vegas. They are the ONLY poke place in the central LV area (that i know of) too. So if you arent SE and N, and have poke express accessible, this is the place to go ! 

They have a large variety of different styles of poke, and if they are out, they'll make more ! Always fresh and wonderfully seasoned. The few times ive been here, i've been trying different ones. To my memory, if it doesnt fail me, ive tried a spicy ahi poke, limu ahi poke, and a shoyu ahi poke. 

Shoyu Ahi Poke is simple. Seasoned with shoyu, and some chopped green onions. Simple but wonderful.

Spicy Ahi Poke is slightly spicy. Seasoned with some chili sauce, chopped green onions and onions. Nice kick. Not too spicy. 

Limu Ahi Poke is one of the hawaiian poke staples. Limu coming from algae or in other words, seaweed, it adds a nice color attribute, as well as a textural crunchy aspect. Together with the chopped green onions, onions, and sauce.. Yummy !  

Good place to check out if you are in the central valley area and craving for some poke like i do sometimes ! Friendly owner ! 

Only downside is parking. Either park on the side in front of other shops or park across the street by 99 ranch and walk over. But its nothing too bad that would stop you from experiencing some yummy poke !",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,0,4,2rdqbLx1HY5wOYEA7WXChg

The tuna was extremely fresh and I also enjoyed a rice ball. Overall, worth the trip and strange parking in Chinatown.

They were all just okay. I mean they were good but I guess I expected something a lot better.  The spicy ahi wasn't spicy enough for me and I've had better shoyu ahi at other places.

I love a good poke, and appreciate that I can try several types here, and the Chinatown location is super convenient. In addition to poke, shop has Hawaii memorabilia and some clothing items.

Love the fresh-made spicy garlic poke, ordered it as a bowl for lunch, $10- the rice was steaming hot and began cooking some of the poke, unfortunately. Additionally, my bowl was 90% rice with a layer of one-fish-piece-depth poke, which I felt was a little stingy. Bowl was oddly served with soy sauce packets, but I quickly discovered while: the rice is plain white rice with no flavoring, in the past I've had bowls with rice and also cabbage, with the poke liquid to flavor it. Proportions were off and rice quickly got clumpy and boring.

My first review I gave them 4 stars but having been there several more times and finally noticing the menu that they have on the upper left wall by the entrance, I realized they made other styles of poke to order.

From my experience there is usually about 1 to 2 pounds of poke in any given tray in the morning as soon as they open. I guess this is to ensure freshness if business is slow, but the fish has never tasted bad to me before. In the afternoon around 2, the trays are usually depleted but don't be alarmed, you can ask them to whip up a batch. 
 
Today I bought a pound of spicy ahi (not the mayo with masago kind) and a limu style. Love the limu style with the seaweed things to make it crunchy.

**Atmosphere - when you come in, you don't realize it's not fit to sit in and eat.

Both were much better with soy sauce. The Poke was good, just a little bland (And the Spicy Poke was not spicy). It's cool that you can get a pound of poke for $14. That's a super reasonable price. 

However, I am not sure if eating 3/4lb of pure ahi Poke in one sitting (like I did), is a good idea.. This place makes it too easy to expose yourself to mercury poisoning... 
But, they also offer poke bowls, in addition to the by the pound option...

What I do know is that it is ridiculously great!!  The only downside is that I can't get it anywhere else that I know of.

Poke is always freshly made and never sits for long.  Most times it's made to order like today.

You are basically parking where the shops unload their things. When we came inside the store, they have the display of poke right in front of you. They only had 4 different types of ahi poke so we ended up trying a 1/4 lb of each. 

What we tried:
Spicy Garlic Ahi Poke: So this was the most liked only because it actually tasted like something. It wasn't spicy and you couldn't taste the garlic, but it was visible. I had to dunk it into the sauce that they gave to us.

Ahi Limu Poke: limu is the hawaiian word for algae. And like the Spicy Garlic Ahi, you could see the limu, but you couldn't taste it.

Spicy Ahi Poke: this was not spicy at all and it looked exactly like the Shoyu Ahi, except that it had white sesame seed and basically tasted the same.

Shoyu Ahi Poke: tasted the same as the Spicy Ahi, but instead of white sesame seeds...it had black sesame seed...dunk it into the sauce they give you to taste something!

Service:
It was okay. It was just 2 workers behind the counter and I'm guessing they were husband and wife? She didn't understand that we wanted 1/4 lb of each of the ahi poke they had in the display case until her husband? explained to her.

Their claims had reached all my expectations however In the end I found myself disappointed at the quality. They had claimed to have fresh fish but being that i am a fisherman l can tell you it's not as fresh as they claim. It was nothing like hawaii in both taste and preparation. Portion wise I felt ripped off I find them to be a bit greedy at an unreasonable price. For the most part I found this place to be unsatisfying and upsetting imitation to my standard of poke so just a heads up if your expecting it to be like island quality personally it's nothing like hawaii,JScm6fLHK_Znrf-3Lu3iqw,1,1,1,i_mVm7cBO8CijBL6QYSdYA

This tiny little place located in the China Town area of LV, is pretty tough to find if you don't pay close attention while driving down Wynn Rd... 

Once you are here, you will notice that the place is small, unattractive, and simply plain in overall appearance including the cold counter where they they ""hold"" the pre-marinated pokes...

So why did I give it a 4 stars?

1)  Flavor!  Love their Spicy Mix Ahi Poke!  Spicy mayo mix all combined with fresh ahi, sesame, green onions and red onions may this poke super delicious!  (Reminded me of those that were in Maui)

2)  Freshly made!  Yes... there's not much in the counter, however, all items can be made to order!  Just tell the owner and he will be more than happy to whip some up for you quickly!  And of course, FRESH TOO!!!

3)  Decent price!  Price actually cost slightly less than Maui!  So I'm happy to pay for more delicious ahi!

4)  Friendly service!  Owner is real cool, real chill, and very nice overall!

They have many other varieties of poke to choose from, so I'm sure there is a flavor that suit your tastebuds as long as you are a fan of fresh ahi!

Next time you are in town, give this place a try as a nice little appetizer to one of your delicious meals in Vegas... and while you are at it, why not take a picture in front of Floyd Mayweather's boxing gym location just around the corner?",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,11,9,4,eenAH30riOe-7QozkVDlVg

It's a small store that's run by a couple with lots of different styles of Poke. We ordered the spicy garlic and limon poke with a side of seaweed salad.

The taste of the poke was pretty good and very authentic. Taking my first bite reminded me of our past visits to Hawaii. If it's good enough to remind me of Hawaii, then the poke here is damn good! The spicy garlic is yummy and real spicy. The taste gets spicier as you eat it and of course gives you bad breath after, but it was totally worth it! The limon poke is your basic original poke that you eat with soy sauce. Very yummy and authentic!

Poke is a dish of sushi like fish which is marinated in soy sauce and sesame seed oil. It is often futher dressed with green scallion dice and/or seaweed.

I had the large bowl which allowed me to pick two of the pokes to be served on Japanese style seasoned rice. I chose the Tako (octopus) poke and a seaweed tuna poke.

It was delicious. It was fresh. It was very affordable. The blend of sesame and soy accentuated the fish and rice perfectly. 

Try the Hawaiian Pinapple soda they sell from the case and go outside and eat it on the bench.

4286919,2009-01-13,4,pi4FLFEOn9AhNUxiLbBeHg,"Hawaiian Style Poke is an awesome hidden little gem. Its on Wynn, just south of Spring Mountain. 

They carry fresh poke and they make it in small batches (I'm assuming so its fresher). 

They don't have a huge variety. But they have the basics. Tako poke and ahi. They also have a spicy ahi and an oyster sauce ahi. The oyster sauce ahi is kind of gimicky to me. Like anything drenched in oyster sauce is good. But it is good. The tako poke is so good. The very first time I had it, it was so tender, nicely seasoned, and the ogo (limu, or seaweed) was so fat and crunchy. The next few times I had it, the tako was still yummy, but the ogo was all sad and small. 

The seafood is fresh considering we live in the middle of BFE. 

And the prices are reasonable. Like a pound of tako poke is $10.99. 

They also sell opihi, poi, haupia, a varitey of Hawaiian kine snacks (like taro chips and kaki mochi), t-shirts, and stickers to sticker up the back of your Tahoe like all the Hawaiians that move from 808 to the 702. Okay, seriously though, not all people from Hawaii have to sticker up their cars. People don't actually do it as much in Hawaii. Its only after they've moved away. But a lot of them have to make it known that they're from the greatest place on Earth. Get over it. You don't live there anymore. MOVE ON. 

I always see the same two Hawaii guys working the counter. They're both really nice and happy to answer your questions. 

There's street parking or parking around the corner in the alley. 

I never see a lot of people in here, but the counter guys says they've been busy. Good. I hope they stick around. If business is threatened, I'll single-handedly support them.

We decided to come back on the last day of our trip before leaving and this time there was enough rice for everyone to have their own bowl.

Limu poke mixed with spicy poke is just right.  Limu style is mixed with raw onion, tiny bits of crunchy dark seaweed, sesame, mixed in sesame oil.  Shoyu poke was so-so compared to Limu.  Spicy was all heat by itself and lack flavor, but perfect when it's mixed with another flavor.  

Also bought a $20lb bag of opihi, little abalone looking shellfish from Oahu, each is the size of a dollar coin.  Owner recommended this native Hawaiian delicacy.  To enjoy, rinse under cold water, drain, sprinkle on some Hawaiian sea salt (ask the owner), spoon out the meat from the side and enjoy.  It's one of the most interesting exotic food I've ever tried.  Out of the entire bag of 40-50 pieces, only 4 pieces were not edible, which is expected given it's raw shellfish.

There isn't a inside seating, but outside there are some stone tables and benches. It was way too hot today so the inside of the car was our lunch table.

The BF and I got about half a pound of each:

Garlic Ahi poke- pretty good. Good garlic flavor and I like the two kinds of onions in it plus green onions. We asked for a little spice and there was pieces of chilies thrown in it. 

Wasabi Ahi Poke- this had a creamy sauce base, onions and a bit of green onion. This was no joke wasabi. I complain that most wasabi poke just mix a tiny bit for flavor into some shoyu and call it a day. I like that they aren't afraid to give you wasabi here and I like the creaminess, BUT this was seriously overpowering. I love wasabi, but this was my nasals and eye ducts were burning at every bite experience. Even with taking bites with the other poke and some rice it was a bit much so I tried to scrape some of the cream off. Maybe gonna ask them to go a little lighter next time and mix.

Limu Ahi Poke- fairly good, but lacking something for me..I should have asked for a little dab of shoyu to open up the flavor. For those who love the bits of limu- they are generous about putting a lot here. 

Poke is $10.95 and can be ordered in sizes as small as a 1/4th container to a big ol' bucket. 

I got a package of rice ($2) to go with the poke. We also got some Arizona Green Teas and I've never seen ""Extra Sweet"" version of it but they have that here... (is that a Hawaiian thing?). For dessert, some LiHingMui covered peach gummis ($1.75) from their small selection of Hawaiian snacks. 

I am a big fan of Poke Express (Craig Rd.)  and they are compared all the time on reviews. After trying it here, I would say they are different. The fish is about the same freshness and the way they season their poke isn't even close to being the same so it's about taste preference. Taste preference wise, I think I learn towards Poke Express overall.

The fish just tasted bland. The Hawaiian style poke was missing something. The spicy garlic and spicy poke were just spicy. IT over power any possible flavors.Not sure how this place got great reviews. 
location is hidden too. Not the easy to find. Especially if you are a new transplant to vegas. **points to self**

I've been craving some poke hardcore since then but honestly I've always been scared to try this place. Poke in the desert? Plus I figured there's no way it could live up to the poke I had in Hawaii (oh yeah and I'm a bratty fish snob to boot!).

Well folks, this is honestly Hawaiian quality poke. Yeah it's *slightly* tastier in Maui, but not by much. The fish was so fresh tasting. YUM. The place was uber clean. No weird smells, no chewy fish. YAY!!

They had about 5 types of poke and then some fun containers they make themselves (I wanna try the seaweed salad next time!), plus they had warm spam/rice they had just wrapped up. Lots and lots of fun Hawaiian drinks, foods, shirts, etc, etc. A tiny place, but lots of goodies hiding all over the place!

I had a 1/4 lb of Garlic Poke and 1/4 lb of Shoyu Poke ($10.95/lb) and tried my friend's limu poke. All were incredible!! The fish was the star, but it was perfectly salted and the onions were so fresh and crisp too. 

They have a cute little bench area outside that's shaded where you can eat your lunch if you can't wait till you get home. Drink were reasonable too $.65 - $2 or so. 

This is definitely going into my weekly rotation - cheap , healthy, and tasty - LOVE IT. Thanks yelp for the killer find.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,4,1,5,5f_pMpC0T3qPFr0ql-fjsA

Also grabbed two spam musubis. The amount of rice was far too great compared to the spam. It was triple the rice compared to the slice of spam. There wasn't much flavor.

I decided to get the spicy ahi poke regular bowl. In all honestly, the spicy ahi poke in particular was okay. The spicy ahi was a little too tarty for me and the amount of rice in the poke bowl was a little too much.

My friend returned to the restaurant and described it as it being a deli, akin to a sandwich shop.  He picked up a pound of poke, not sure exactly which style, and some steamed rice.  Fresh, flavorful, and authentic is what flashed through my senses.  One pound was not enough for as I had to hold back in order to share.

I do have a quick little theory though about the fact that this place wasn't as good as the other Poke I've been too here in Vegas, well the thing is, we came in here about 10 minutes before this place was about to close. But if you own a poke spot you're expected to have fresh fish all the way up to when you close, so I can't really use that too much of an excuse. Just like I said this place is great though, people that run this tiny poke spot are really really courteous, nice, and everything else that goes along those lines of words.

We ordered the usual stuff just more of it because we just came here right before we left back home to the bay. We came here to bring a bunch of poke because we don't have anything like that around the bay. Anyways we had the squid, ahi garlic, and pretty much all the other ahi flavors.

The operating hours are interesting (as in, I finally found a way to go when they're actually open) and the store is somehow also a souvenir shop? That was a bit confusing.

The price was a bit steep in my opinion, probably only because I'm used to making poke in large batches at home so buying the smaller portions doesn't seem as worth it. The poke itself was quite delicious though. I had the limu poke, shoyu poke and the tako poke, both of which were flavorful and fresh - the tako especially.

Please be aware this is *not* a dine-in restaurant!

I was taken aback by this when I came in, but this seems to be a family owned business (closed on Tuesdays, random day to be closed!) Their selection is small, but what makes up in little quantity goes for A LOT of quality in what they have. You can choose which sizes you want to take to-go (which makes the beauty of this place so worthwhile, you are able to order a half size and even 1/4 size for a very reasonable price!) I went with the 1/2 size of spicy tuna and limu, with a little container of rice (you can do a combination of different ones to switch it up!)

For $10 I dined on an excellent lunch of ahi poke. I'm astounded by how affordable it is, not to mention I feel this is much better than any sushi bar I've ever been in (it's literally like making your own sashimi sushi at home or on the go!) Cheaper than any sushi bar, and you get more for your buck. Plus, family owned businesses are always more hospitable!

Food 5/5  Poke, but not your average Chipotle poke but rather your counter poke that you see while in Hawaii. With so many choices to choose from both fish and sauce it was quite amazing. Fish was fresh tasting and there wasn't the slightest bit of fishyness at all. 

Parking - Parking was easy I guess having not been in that specific area it took a little bit to figure out where to park as there is quite a lots of spaces available but a kinda odd layout.

But it is the greatest mix ever. The spicy options are very spicy and delicious. 
This time i got the spicy garlic ahi poke bowl and the spicy ahi poke bowl. The big chunks of fish and the raw onions mixed with the sauce is just so amazing. The spiciness blasting the flavors in your mouth. I'm drooling thinking about it.
