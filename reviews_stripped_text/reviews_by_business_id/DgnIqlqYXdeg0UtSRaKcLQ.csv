129172,2016-07-25,0,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"My dad and I liked Mykonos so much after our first visit we went back again a couple of day later. We ordered off the Early Bird menu the first time, which has several entrees that come with soup or salad and are only $9.50. The avgolemono soup was yummy, as was my huge portion of half chicken. 

Our second visit, I stuck with appetizers. The tzatziki was so delicious it made a convert out of my Dad, who had never liked it before. The chef told us that's because they make it from yogurt from Greece so it's a high quality, true Greek yogurt. The spanokopita was tasty but the pastry was kind of tough. Maybe it had been microwaved?

The service was excellent and the waitress gave us delicious free Greek butter cookies for dessert. Dad ordered the baklava with the sweet grape sauce on the side. I enjoyed the tiny bite he shared with me.",dFBClLvlK0um_xQLXmLIBw,0,0,4,DxM63VRMDKOhvDNFCTZdHA

221069,2015-08-09,0,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"We had a wonderful family dinner at Mykonos on Saturday night. Great food, very pleasant atmosphere, and two of the most gracious, friendly, and informative hosts you could imagine.

Starting with the saganaki and fresh pita, we were impressed. The feta on the Greek romaine salad was creamy and not overly salty, the herbs and oil in the dressing complemented the lettuce very well. Entrees included the beef tips, lamb chops, shrimp, and chicken souvlaki. 

Each dish was expertly prepared and had a depth of flavors that showcased the main ingredient. Fruit with the shrimp was a brilliant touch. The sauce with the beef tips was rich but never overpowered the meat. Lamb chops were grilled to perfection and served over arugula with a bright fresh sauce that was enjoyable to the last drop. The souvlaki was traditional, very well seasoned, and accompanied by fresh vegetables. Everyone ordered rice as a side and agreed that it was a great choice.

Excellent wines - be adventurous and try the Greek selections - are affordable by the glass or the bottle. Ask about a dessert wine for a special treat.

As for our experience, we were treated extremely well. Our hosts were engaging, attentive, fun, and created a memorable evening for us. Helen was sweet and understanding, and Chef Sakis helped with everything from the wine selection to a Greek geography lesson that we really appreciated. 

For authentic Greek food, an amazing evening, and a good feeling that lasts long after you leave the restaurant, don't miss Mykonos!",gt7WAjMx3eXojOM81bkg3g,0,1,5,MSihd6788ZKIwU2QrkM_fQ

I also do not work for any restaurant, Greek or otherwise, but just give my honest opinion based of my experience.  One of the things we do (or most of us do) on Yelp is give an honest opinion of the restaurants we frequent.  I have many reviews on Yelp, some good, some not so good, but all of them honest.  I have spent a lot of time in Greece, I cook Greek food, and have frequented many Greek restaurants in Las Vegas and  other parts of the country.  I based my opinion on that history, and found Mykonos lacking compared to other places I have tried.

We had the calamari & it was good, not the best we've ever had but something we would order again. We tried the Greek Mythos Beer & we both enjoyed that! It's a bit pricey $90 w/tip!

279195,2015-10-02,0,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"I was craving for some Greek food and thought to try this place after seeing all the good reviews; however, it was a huge mistake! The only people in the restaurant was a couple and my family during dinner. The lack of people should have given me a clue to turn around and eat elsewhere.
2 of the 6 items we tried to order, they did not have. How can they not have a half a roasted chicken or some pork chops? So, my son ended up ordering chicken kebab instead and because they did not have any pork chops, I ended up ordering chicken kebab as well.
The food was horrendous! The $17 grilled octopus appetizer was burnt and very salty. I ended up eating it so as not to waste my $17. My husband's boiled salad was so nasty!! The chef insisted that everyone who tried this salad, they end up ordering again...I highly doubt that! My chicken kebab was soaked in oil and was very sour. It seemed like the chef just poured a bunch of olive oil on top of the chicken and the rice it came with and called it a day. The only good thing they had was my son's Greek salad, which I ended up eating instead of the chicken kebab.
I do have to say that service was great. But, it doesn't make up for the fact that the food was horrible. I don't think I'll ever recommend this place to anyone.",eQ4l1kOOX6eNYXgibUouoQ,3,0,1,DByFiDA-pnvhTlSJ9j5f6Q

My wife had a piece of white fish that was boned at our table, she selected the potatoes to go with it, excellent. My Mom had a shrimp plate with fruit, amazing, what flavor!  Me, I had the special, and I can not tell you the name of it, but man was it good. This will be my first 5 star rating ever and I will tell you why.

588572,2015-06-20,3,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"Tucked away in a tiny office strip in, of all places, Sun City Summerlin, is one of the Valley's best restaurants and clearly the best Greek food I have found in Las Vegas. Everything is made from scratch and made with love. In addition to the wonderful favorites like lamb or chicken souvlaki, lamb chops, spanakopita, dolmades (the best I have ever tasted - served hot) tzatziki, etc. there are several wonderful dishes I have never heard of before. Among the best  a diced eggplant appetizer called maritzanosalata, a drizzled sweet beet salad, various wonderful spaghettis, and Helen's Shrimp Heaven, grilled shrimp with sautéed fruit and citrus sauce served over arugula. Helen, the owner is delightful and welcoming, and the chef will be happy to come out and discuss any special needs or desires with you. My only (tiny) negative is that because this used to be a crappy breakfast cafe, there is only a high counter (now supporting an attractive display of wines) separating the kitchen from the dining area. I am not a wine lover, but the wine selection seems extensive and should please those who find vino a necessity with a fine meal. And a very fine meal it is, finished, if you have room, with a wonderful baklava or other dessert that wold seem equally as good. And did I mention that the pita is homemade and freshly baked for your table. We live around the corner so this is a neighborhood place for us, but if you live in Henderson or Boulder City or are on vacation or business on the Strip, it's worth the drive and effort to find Mykonos.

606027,2016-09-12,0,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"You've tasted the tapas at Jose Andres' Jaleo at The Cosmopolitan.

You've ciao-ed and chowed at Mario Batali's B+B Ristorante at the Venetian.

You still can't pronounce his name, but you now know why Joel Robuchon was given the title ""Chef of the Century"" by the Gault Millau -- the illustrious French restaurant guide, whose name you can't pronounce either.

You've eaten all the unreal food that increasingly is why people travel to this unreal city. So when you're ready to skip the strip and go local, make your way to Summerlin, the planned community that Howard Hughes's heirs built at the edge of the Spring Mountains and Red Rock Canyon. 

In a shopping center on Sun City Boulevard, you'll find the unexpected Mykonos restaurant. On a business trip last year, my husband and I ate dinner at the restaurant and left wishing we had brought a suitcase to fill with moussaka and baklava with sweet grape sauce. 

Tyche, the Greek goddess of fortune and luck, favored us with a return business trip to Las Vegas this year, and we headed to Mykonos with a colleague for dinner. With the goddess's favor, we arrived in time for the Early Bird menu. 

To start, my husband and I ordered avgolemono: chicken, lemon and rice soup. It was mother food, hot and homey. Our colleague ordered choriatiki, a composed salad that included dolmades (stuffed grape leaves). 

For entrees, our colleague and I chose the lamb souvlaki (chunks of grilled lamb, green peppers and onions), served on a bed of rice mixed with orzo and with triangles of grilled, buttered pita. It was cooked the way I had asked the server: pink. My husband ordered the moussaka, served with rice and orzo and grilled pita triangles. Light -- yes, not like a Parthenon slab.

We had no room for dessert, but we couldn't resist ordering it. Karidopita, walnut cake with cinnamon and sugar syrup, for my husband and bakalava for me and our colleague. You would think that baklava doesn't need ""finishing"" with orange and cinnamon-infused honey and sweet grape sauce. But it does, and we finished it. 

The wine list has many Greek gems. Order a bottle or two -- it's cheap and cheerful.

The Mykonos murals on the side walls add to the ambiance. But the gigantic television set hanging from the back wall is about as appealing as Medusa.

Kristela Colloku is charming. Chef Frank Difloe is a big man -- in stature and talent. And then there is Chef Maurice, an African-American who played professional basketball in Greece for two years, speaks the language, and told me that the Greeks taught him how to live. Opa!

The next evening, Tyche favored us with a return to Mykonos. But she didn't favor us at the hotel casino.",uLCiqgFQWGdG7nvG5ZX5wA,0,0,5,xW6tL52-WDcdqWW4QuX9qw

1393200,2017-05-30,0,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"Seriously one of the worst meals in our lives.  The first clue should have been the place was completely empty on a Saturday night at 6:30pm, the staff was staring out of the window wondering when the first person sucker would walk in.  I ordered pan fried cod with some kind of mashed potatoes and beet salad.  17.00 for this. You would expect a pretty fresh and hot meal.  Not the case.  
Beets were anything but a salad maybe sliced from the can and placed on the plate.  Not really what I would call salad.  Speaking of salad. There was a bit of salad on the plate. Fresh. No I wouldn't call it fresh by any means.  Brown and turning is more like it. A space filler is what it was. Mashed potatoes with garlic. ICE COLD. Told them to heat it up waiters says oh sorry about that then comes back and says that's not mashed potatoes there supposed to be cold. Really and you work here and didn't know that. What would you call a potato that has been pulverized. Looks mashed to me.   Alright on my the pan fried cod. Should be nice and light flakey warm and FRESH. hahaha that's where they really screwed up.   SOGGY. Overcooked frozen fish was like chewing a tough steak with no flavor  absolutely inedible.   The second meal salmon special.  Oh it was special alright.  23.00 on sale for 16. About a 3.00 piece of frozen overcooked tough salmon is what it really was.  A side of reheated God knows how many times potatoes and all of this floating in a nice pile of some sort of grease / oil whatever.  Waiters asks how's your fish I said inedible overcooked soggy and anything but fresh. His response oh sorry to hear that. Would you like to order desert.  Lmao. Seriously did you not just hear what we said.  And another tip. Change the table clothes.  The fresh food stains make it really unappealing to sit there and eat.  So here we are $45.00 later and both of us are sick to our stomachs thinking we caught something .  I guess we will find out in a few hours.  What a disgrace !!!  I wondered how there could be so many 4-5 star reviews
And then get served this slop.  Makes you wonder who wrote those reviews.  I hope we get food poisoning because then you will be on the news with the health district shining a microscope up your rear

UPDATE. : We are now receiving threatening messages from the owners husband.  I guess they think 2 cases of food poisoning is something to joke about.

Service was friendly and attentive!  We went for a late lunch, so not too many other diners at the time.  The restaurant was clean and Greek themed, of course.

We had a nice house Cabernet that was not overly priced with our lunch.

The pita bread was by far the best that I ever ate!  It was freshly baked, soft and flavorful, but firm enough to handle the nice sized slabs of lamb in the gyro.  Very yummy!  The rice was bland, so I won't choose it next time, but they have other options available to go along with the gyro.  It typically comes with fries, but next time I'll go for a small Greek salad to accompany the gyro.  They have many selections on their menu, but I grade Greek restaurants on the quality of their gyros, first.",nAgJVz0prIH01Cs0QCvZEg,1,0,4,GAg0mT_iVZoPE5UumYlwsg

I ordered baklava. It disappointed me because of the fruit sauce poured over it which detracted from the flavors of honey and butter for which I love the dessert. But I am convinced that under that sauce is one of the best baklavas I have ever had. Next time Ill ask them to leave off the sauce.

1976642,2015-01-25,12,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"Nestled into the sleepy Sun City area is a new Greek restaurant- lunch menu has great well-priced specials and dinner menu has more traditional fare, but they also offer breakfast! Check their website for discount coupons and specials before you go.

STEAK SANDWICH is packed with grilled veggies, a perfectly-juicy medium-rare steak, and feta: simple and tasty. Side choice of salad is a mix of cucumbers, green bell peppers, red onion, tomato, and olives, with olive oil and more feta.
MYKONOS BURGER has tzatziki, feta, and more of the grilled veggies: burger itself was a messy fall-apart version better eaten with a fork. Bun was dry and fell apart pretty quick, may need to find a different option. Side of greek fries was topped with herbs, simple and tasty. 
AVGOLEMONO is the best my BF has had- tart, thick, lemony, good amount of chicken, ample rice, solid and balanced flavor. Cup size is large, bowl is probably enough for an entrée.
DESSERT Plate had baklava with a hint of cinnamon and another sweet pastry, good contrasting flavors and textures, liked the small portion- didn't feel overly indulgent.

Good pricing, very friendly service, chef came out to check on us. Love the bright and airy location with several windows and giant photos of the Greek coastline. No alcohol license yet, beer and wine to come.

EDIT: Dropping my rating due in large part to the decline in service. Just look at the manager Helen's rude and condescending responses to other low reviews.

The zucchini chips just to much olive oil in it !
Spanakopita and pita was the only thing that I can said was good !!!
Lamb chops soaked in olive again and also the side roast potatoes with extremely over pounding garlic !

The downsides are what others have said: polite service, but very slow.  It was a little harder to take when there were only 2 other tables (of 2 people) at the time.  That, and the menu was somewhat limited than my experiences at other Greek restaurants in Las Vegas and California.  Of course, in a Greek place, you usually can't go wrong with a gyro, but if you don't like that, you'll feel a little painted in a corner here.

Finally we ordered, I asked some questions about the menu and the server was not impolite, but indifferent impersonal is the best way I can describe it. The easiest way for me to describe the food\atmosphere is this: Some things good, nothing fantastic. We liked about half of the stuff we ordered. Overpriced Dinner menu and not a lot of choices. Atmosphere was clean and pleasant. 
We were mostly ignored after we got our food. Husband got his drink filled one time and it was about 20 min to late. Then we waited again for her to come back and remove out plates, and she did not ask if we wanted dessert. I took a very small amount of food home and she brought back the bag to the table with no check and then disappeared. I think we seriously waited about another 15 minutes without seeing her in the restaurant at all. We finally came to the conclusion she could only have been outside smoking. finally she returned through the side door to bring us the check. After paying, we left out the front door to discover she was, in fact, out side sitting at a table on the sidewalk smoking a cigarette.",qCUj7AdgpTJKepJEw_7rXw,2,0,2,gaMeAgK1MSwixR0FASY9GQ

Since we were in the front room watching TV that noise made hubby and I jump.  Hands over the bag of food and rushed away. (note NEVER give them the tip during payment of order, wait until they show up), he would have NEVER been given the tip I had prepaid for.

We ordered taramosalata, kokkinisto, greek romaine salad and chicken kabob plate.  My husband ate the salad, and I nibbled on the kokkinsto (big mistake, i've been sick since last night).  The rest of the food was unpalatable.  The taramasalata was SO salty, I spit out what was in my mouth.  My kokkinsto and the chicken kabob were bland and not cooked properly.  Kokkinsto especially is supposed to be slow cooked until the meat melts in your mouth, this was so chewy and tasteless.

The entire meal was horrible, one of the worst I have had in I can't even tell you how long.  We have crossed this place off of our list.",ZGoIAIfTuJeR0pwWDRL6sA,0,0,1,ZrsiNByIPKonv96JVY3lDQ

I was greeted by the owner Helen who is Greek, sweet and friendly. When asked for a suggestion entrée since it was my first visit here, she suggested the whole red snapper - made Greek style. I also ordered a side salad and lamb gyros. The side salad arrived first which was refreshing on a hot day and contained  capers, tomatoes, bell peppers, cucumbers and a thick slice of cheese. The meal included pita bread & delish tzatziki and went perfect as a starter. The snapper and gyro arrived simultaneously  and the snapper was stuffed with dill, garlic & grilled to perfection. The fish was moist, flavorful and was delicious.  The gyros were solid too and it had chunks of lamb mixed with tomatoes, onions and lettuce  - It was another hit. For dessert we ended up sharing the baklava which was warm up and had a sauce on it. I'm use to the dry version of baklava and this was sweet. I think ice cream would have been a nice addition but it still cured my sweet tooth.

Overall, a great meal that didn't break the bank for solid quality this family run business offers. It was better than the Greek dinning experiences I've experienced in So. Cal.",o4tYl3Hz0oDfpNn4k02DCw,22,15,4,V-PSUKjR1nJm93NRi_er1g

Located in Sun City Summerlin, the location in a small Strip Mall really no different than much of the dining in an age restricted community, Mykonos Greek Cuisine has received its fair share of praise from area residents since a recent change in ownership and dining as a trio in the dimly lit room this past Saturday the experience generally proved quite pleasant, though prices seem a bit precious even as portions trend big.

Admittedly unfamiliar with the area, reasons for anyone in their twenties or thirties to venture into this part of the valley few and far between, Mykonos 'strives to bring the culture and elegance of the Mykonos Islands here through Authentic Greek Foods and Service"" and with a menu highly focused on Lamb, Beef, Mezze and Salads it seems odd that Guy Fieri is featured prominently on overhanging flatscreens while service is efficient if not a little overwhelming, an ever-present hand failing to clear extraneous dishes while at the same time incessantly trying to top-off Iced Tea.

At times showing its authenticity by way of subtleties of spelling, recipes or descriptions while at the same time featuring Early Bird Specials and several plates that seem ""Americanized"" for their typical clientele, those sitting down at Mykonos are well advised to investigate the collection of housemade spreads offered individually or by way of combination, the creamy Hummus and Melitzanosalata each priced at $7 with accompanying warm Pita while the $10.50 Sweet Beet Salad is an interesting presentation with sliced rounds encircling Garlic Mashed Potatoes with Olive Oil, the Red Wine Vinegar not particularly perceptible while the menu-described Greek Yogurt was nowhere to be found.

Really going all-out with the Pita, in reality a good thing as the warm housemade rounds are lightly tinged with herbs and near-perfect for scooping up any sort of sauce or spread, entrees arrived perhaps fifteen minutes after starters were presented and although the Mousaka was as authentic as any experienced it was actually the fall-apart Beef Tips in Red Sauce that were truly outstanding, the ""Heaven for Helen"" apparently a relic of prior ownership that was all-over-the-place in terms of its flavors, the handful of tail on shrimp largely forgettable while the admixture of warmed fruit over bitter greens was actually quite great.

Acknowledging that the $23.50 Shrimp would likely be *too* sweet for some, those familiar with Greek Desserts will be happy to know that Mykonos cuts no corners as relates to either of their three options and whether one fancies something as traditional as Rice Pudding or as dense as Karidopita the smart money is in a truly exemplary slice of housemade Baklava served in the cosmopolitan ""island"" style, bathed in sautéed Grape Sauce.

***Totaling over $120 after tax & tip, nearly a Strip-priced meal compared to other Greek Restaurants in Town, Mykonos Greek Cuisine takes a unique look at Mediterranean food in one of the city's least likely dining spaces, perhaps not worth ""going out of the way for,"" but good for a change of pace.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,4,3,80Vr46KNmsCbyQAv5_p0IQ

5902326,2016-08-09,2,DgnIqlqYXdeg0UtSRaKcLQ,"Okay, I get it.  Mykonos is in Sun City, where the locals eat at 5:00 and are fast asleep by the time we decide it's time for dinner.  But c'mon, millenials, it's only a block off Lake Mead Blvd, and it's worth the trip from anywhere.  And if you decide to forgo the Early Bird dinner, as we do (which has recently been extended to 7:00 p.m. and the price lowered to an unbelievable $9.50), you won't have to contend with the likes of all those cranky seniors, ahem, showing up for the deal of the century.

I also get it that our second and latest visit was at 8:00 p.m. on a Monday, in the summer.  But this pretty and comfortable restaurant, with a chef-owner who is a talented chef, personable, and is passionate about his food and making his customers feel like valued guests, deserves to have the joint packed to the rafters every night.  Disclosure:  I'm not being paid for this rave review.  I think every customer gets the same delicious little cookies at the end of their meal; we did the first time, before I'd penned a word.  But I'd almost bet that at other restaurants you won't have an owner bring not one, but four different wine samples to taste before ordering a glass!  

But my greatest fear before moving to Vegas was not having cozy, privately-owned ethnic restaurants to go to, as I was accustomed to on the East coast.  Now my mission is to encourage others to take a break from the big chains and the ubiquitous sushi places, expand your culinary palates, and support your local businesses.  As I said the first time, this is not the same original owner, and the early reviews don't give a contemporary picture.  This is seriously good food.

I don't usually eat beef, but went for the Makaronia Kokkinisto, beef tips over spaghetti.  It was a huge portion, with a mountain of tender beef in a very thick fresh tomato sauce with a hint of cinnamon.  I will be enjoying it for more than one day to come.  My husband savored his Moussaka, which comes with a generous amount of those delicious lemon-enhanced roasted potatoes.

I could be wrong, but the prices seem to have increased since my last visit.  Probably to make up for the lowered EB cost, but there are discounts to be had.  Still, it's a good deal since, unless you're training for the Olympics, you'll have leftovers.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,8,7,5,lGJHsmMSuvi8H02KVpe2RQ

Amazing service. Kind and always up for giving suggestions. I will be back for more.,HRIb0iFXXbA1qEtBzYS2jg,1,4,5,IEVE4CM43qazvkCQa0-cNQ

Big portions and awesome price! That is the hard part of Vegas... Finding a Greek restaurant. If you're nearby, stop in and meet Frank (the owner), he is the best! Service was fast and appropriate too! Great experience overall! 5 Stars!",AapTaQ78p_SpQqj8mySt3Q,1,0,5,D0lPaHboZGyRGo07DdlLOw
