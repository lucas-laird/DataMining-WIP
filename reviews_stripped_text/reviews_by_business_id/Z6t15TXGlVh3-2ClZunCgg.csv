41286,2016-05-18,0,Z6t15TXGlVh3-2ClZunCgg,Love this place. Tacos were $1.50 or $2 for supreme(cheese and sour cream). I got the supreme asada and they were crazy good. They are cash only. I also got the asada fries to share with my boyfriend and it was okay. The fries tasted a little fishy. Kind of like they weren't fried in fresh oil. Won't get them again. But I will definitely be back for the tacos.,AhhFEDxHhA5kjtDzezh2HQ,0,0,4,qf2EUSoKsQxrP6fE2LGnFw

The pambazos, sopes, & flautas are so good especially the pastor supreme burrito!!!! The green salsa is better than any other salsa I've tried, it is not your watered down salsa. i also asked for xtra toppings on my regular tacos and did not get charged (they told me they only charge for the supreme ones) but of the 4 days I came to eat out of the 7 I was in town I did not have a bad experience. I come every 4 months and decided to now give me them a great review! They have low prices, and the quality of the food is great! Portion is good too if you want more you can ask for it and pay an extra price :) Will definitely come back again! And I recommend others to try it out for their own experience!!",yXQfIV7ZtBT6LHWsI48Rjg,0,0,5,3eM4zD7__el-Xxr9jl8HuQ

The reason i only gave them 3 stars is , because they are VERY GREEDY with their salsa.  No matter how much you spend,  they dont want to part ways with it!  So weird!  I've even offered to pay extra for more salsas with my order,  and you can tell by their facial expressions they are bothered by it.

Also they have messed up our order twice.   On both occasions we didnt notice until we got home.  We were short tacos both times.  

Probably won't be back for these reasons.",yI27yodFNujaCHlNDr_rVw,0,0,3,AKEafrSgqAkaPLWAuz9ZDw

The fries were good not great they kind of remind me of those crinkled fries from the grocery store that you buy at smiths still good though the prices here are reasonable and they always have deals going on overall this place will probably end up being my go to place as the food here pretty much won me over.,Unhr6Ut9xQowzzohevNdxg,1,0,5,BtzA25jPDp-k2501apsiQA

Maybe I'm just spoiled by the taco trucks in LA. It wasn't bad by any means, but nothing I would rave about. 

Again, maybe I'm biased, but the portions weren't big to me. There could have been more meat in my tacos and there could have been more burrito to my burrito. 

And they were super stingy with the salsa. I've never in my experience known salsa to be a bank breaker and I cannot take people who try to control my condiment intake. Especially with enough food for 2 people and 1 salsa for each of us.",2kMMpWAhwLxTsP9-AKKp8A,2,0,2,xLNf3V_PjYHnDOxJxt7d0A

I had to try it out. And thank God I did because these are some of the best tacos I've ever had. Everything about the meat to the tortillas have so much flavor!! There flautas are very light and crispy with a lot of meat inside of them. And the co-pays are just to die for. And both of their red and green sauces have a competition with my taste buds every time I tried them. They are both to die for!!

2778848,2014-08-02,4,Z6t15TXGlVh3-2ClZunCgg,"Finally got to try this place after driving by them for the last year and a half. Not really a taco truck but more like a small trailer that you can tow. Judging by the size of it, makes you wonder how they can make whatever you decide to get tasty.

For my first visit, I got 3 tacos ($1.50 each). I got Al Pastor, Asada, and Carnitas. The Pastor was not your typical cut of pork off the spit. It was more like grilled after being sliced. The Carne Asada was your standard sliced seasoned beef. Was ok. The Carnitas were pretty good and not dry. All three had good flavor especially with the chopped up cilantro, onion, and radish. Also comes with a slice of lime and two different kinds of salsa. One is supposedly medium while the other is hot. To me both were good but both seemd to have the same spice level. I ended up mixing both up and which complemented the tacos well.

The second visit I wanted to get the Asada Fries ($8.00) but wanted it with Al Pastor instead. The nice lady said that was not a problem. If you refer to my pic, they have sour cream, pico de gallo, and cheddar cheese. It was really good.

Some random info. They take cash only. Since they are right next to a convenience mart, you can get more choices of drink from there. Make sure to take one of their flyers so that you know what the specials are for certain days.

All in all I thought what they serve here is pretty good. I just think that you should get just a little bit more meat for what you get.

They are located on the corner of Flamingo and Lindell. They have a number of daily specials and even items I had never heard of before. Once I see something new I know that's what I'm ordering. I was craving al pastor so I tried the pambazo with al pastor. It's a bit like a torts but the bread is marinated and fried I think. My fella for the al pastor burrito. Both of our orders came out quickly and we were on our way home with a back full of inexpensive goodies.

Both items were great. Not the best al pastor I've ever had, a little on the dry side, but good. We both preferred the pambazo to the burrito, though. The salsas were super spicy and I loved that.
