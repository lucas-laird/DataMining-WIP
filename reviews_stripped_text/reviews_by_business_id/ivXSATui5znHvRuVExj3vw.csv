2366687,2017-10-20,1,ivXSATui5znHvRuVExj3vw,"After going to other Subways in Henderson and Las Vegas, NV, they always provided mil/vet/police/sr discounts but not this location. I bought a 6"" salad bowl that you don't get much in it with the price of $6.76, is pretty sad. The owner is David Bonbara and I was told he won't offer discounts to anyone and that's ashame after few heroes who worked hard deserves this discounted rates. It sounds like the owner doesn't want to give up his comfort in collecting more but only for himself and here we sacrifice our lives for his freedom!",BVIgaaMBLKEUCSmASwuYjQ,0,0,1,nUvB-6KSs0jxXjkqjh58yQ

I am pleased to say everyone seems comfortable here.  It's easy to stay and chat even if it's past midnight.  I have brought friends and family here after picking them up from the airport with late night flights.  I can count on this stor.  I will be returning again and again as usual.  Thank you, Subway.

2568298,2018-05-12,0,ivXSATui5znHvRuVExj3vw,Second time buying a veggie wrap at this specific Subway and I am as disappointed as the first time. There is an employee that certainly thinks she is making a burrito instead of a wrap. This Subway gets one star because of that. Please train your employees so they know how to make a good sandwich the Subway way. I would NEVER go back to this location. Very upset!!! Btw I called to talk to a manager and theres only one from M-F. Woowww!! No wonder.,uLAXgk7m_gtB6gMV_kR7Ng,0,0,1,FCddZZgXuL3tS8R42brhwg
2753381,2014-11-21,0,ivXSATui5znHvRuVExj3vw,"Since I work late, I stop by here about once a week to pick up dinner on my way home. This is usually around 1 a.m. when there is no long lunch line. Still, there always seems to be at least one customer hanging around. I am usually greeted pretty quickly, food is made very quickly to my specifications, and what can be more simple than that. I only give it 4 stars because once I came to give in to my sweet tooth and they were totally out of cookies. But, it was 3 in the morning and if I would have waited a whole six minutes I could have gotten some. But when you're tired and you just want to go home, six minutes is a long time.  Other than that,  no complaints.",dq4MLIMiPDzfEuhxJ72U7A,0,0,4,gZCINVVQLFwW-RdfYai33w
2803789,2014-08-01,2,ivXSATui5znHvRuVExj3vw,"Pros:
1. They packed my sandwich full!!
2. Friendly employees.
3. Open 24 hours. 
4. 5 minute walk from my place. 
5. Their pastrami is delish! (Yes I know it's a chain not specializing in pastrami, but I still like it.) 

Cons:
1. The floors were filthy. How am I supposed to enjoy my meal if you can't keep your vacinity clean? 
2. The teenage boys hanging out on the corner table were kind of weird. They had their music blasting and were just chillin like it was their house. I didn't know subway was the new hit spot. 
3. That oh so significant smell once you walk in. 

It's a Subway. What more can I say?",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,0,0,3,bWBAkk1q0dcEkWIqbIdeuA

Everything is always fresh, even at 2am. I've never had a mistake made on my sandwhich, though it's a pretty simple order.
Workers there are amazing. Always greet you right when you walk through the door. My favorite is the assistant manager. He always puts me in a better mood and makes me laugh every visit.  There's hardly a wait, even during lunch rush everything seems to run smoothly.
The cleanliness of the store is great as well, someone is always cleaning when I am there.

the sandwiches. I had to ask for a full scoop and the employee gave me an attitude. I used to be a regular, but I will take my money else where where it is appreciated. I advise you to do the same.",h_e-wJ19OBZbKI2JHxmKDw,0,0,1,uOUSySrAlxMi_SVCtKnP3g

We ordered and paid for 3 sandwiches on line and we were quoted about 20 minutes. They were ready in 5 and tasted great. Staff well trained.

We walked in and was greeted by the guy behind the counter; he was nice and friendly.  He made the sandwiches as requested. Everything would have been perfect had it not been for the stale wheat bread.

I even read the reviews before going into this Subway shop but I figured it couldn't be that bad, right? I was wrong.

5516438,2008-03-06,0,ivXSATui5znHvRuVExj3vw,"All Subway foods probably taste the same- the main difference is service. Some Subways are incredibly slow, some places are dirty, etc.  What got me at this one was that the person making the sandwich put the lid for one of the food troughs on top of the plastic that separates the food from the customer, and it slid off and landed on the floor where customers walk in.  On my way out I picked it up and handed it to the person and she PUT IT RIGHT ON THE FOOD!  I will not be returning to this Subway.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,5,0,1,scoqW3iDKmeolelBgJBf3w

5850462,2018-03-31,0,ivXSATui5znHvRuVExj3vw,"The level of cross-contamination in this restaurant is disturbing.  I watched the employee making someones sandwich touch multiple utensils, equipment, surfaces, and cash register using the same pair of gloves.  She  used her knuckle to work the register, but that just displayed her level of lazy. She seemed annoyed when I asked if she could change gloves before starting with my food.  

All was well until she went to toast my sandwich.  While she was waiting, she began to touch everything again including her hair.  She knew I was watching and still was touching everything anyway which meant she either didn't care or had no understanding of cross-contamination food safety.  

This location is in desperate need to retraining.",eRsIWgIoaVkzgdF6_bgCwA,0,0,1,LMBr4fc0fbZkSdN94RrrVQ
