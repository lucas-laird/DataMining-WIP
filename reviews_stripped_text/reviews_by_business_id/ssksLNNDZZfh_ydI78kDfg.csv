Ok...truth be told, it isn't really punishingly hot as it is persistent.  The spiciness is there but it's not immediately overwhelming.  The numbing feeling and the chili oil stick on your tongue though.  After 5 minutes, I was dying.  I've had spicier things before but the feeling dissipates...here it sticks around.  For that reason, I can't take their mapo tofu.  I did like their hot and sour soup, kung pao shrimp, and the shredded pork with bamboo shoots.

I ordered the boiled fish, which was excellent and typical for most szechuan places.  It is oily (as is most szechuan cuisine), which may put some people off if they're not expecting it.  However, the spice level is pretty darn good.  The string beans are also excellent.  Price is good, and the cold dishes definitely provide a nice touch - again, I would only go for these cold dishes if you're either a) used to various organ meats or b) feeling adventurous.   I read on prior reviews that the service here is poor.  I didn't have this experience when I ate here - the server regularly checked on us and refilled our tea/water/rice as needed.

If you don't like spicy, they have mild dishes, but I like spicy so this place is great.  I really like the cold bar that they have, and I like that they change it up somewhat every now and then.  It's also probably some of the most reasonably priced food in the place, $4.50 for a plate with 3 choices.

When it comes to their hot food, I really love their lamb dishes.  Yes they can be a little oily, but I think that the flavor is spot on.  I like letting it sit on the rice for a bit as it cools so that the rice picks up the flavor.  Also, this place can go very ""traditional"" on you, in that they serve offal.  I've had the tripe here, and I was pleasantly surprised by it.  It wasn't very chewy and didn't have that gamey flavor that I'm used to with tripe.

588199,2016-04-20,0,ssksLNNDZZfh_ydI78kDfg,"Excellent Szechuan. My personal favorite in Las Vegas.

We had Boiled Fish in Hot Sauce, the crayfish in hot sauce, and finally the Szechuan flavored noodles. The fish was excellent. It's a dish I order every time I come to a Szechuan place and here it was what I expected - tender fish and flavorful hot oil with the perfect hit of spiciness. The crayfish was great as well. I expected it to overwhelm me with its spice, but it was very flavorful. It was rich, spicy, salty, and a tad sweet. Very great complex flavors there. It was also fresh as the server explained the cooking of them beforehand. Lastly, the Szechuan noodles were the perfect finishing touch. They weren't that hot, which was perfect as everything beforehand was. Instead, they had a great tang from vinegar and a slight sesame oil taste to them. Everything was great. 

The service was great. The waitress spoke English well enough, and was even able to explain items to us. She was prompt with service, was very nice, and towards the end of our meal when the restaurant suddenly was swamped with service, she never lost a beat. The interior is really nice as well. Modern, with traditional touches, and very clean.

773420,2016-12-23,2,ssksLNNDZZfh_ydI78kDfg,"I came here with my family a couple of weeks ago for lunch. We picked this place because we always used to come here for our Szechuan food fix. When we got there, there were only two other tables of customers, even though it was only 12:30pm.

We started off with two plates of their cold dishes, which always used to be my favorite. If you're a fan of cold spicy dishes, I recommend the ???? (basically Chinese cold cuts). As a family, we also ordered the ???? (Boiled Fish Sliced in Hot Sauce), ??? (Chicken with Chilies), ????? (One Choy Garlic in White Sauce), ???? (Cumin Lamb), and ???? (Sliced Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce). Flavor-wise, everything was good, but the spice level was not there at all. I'm the weak one in the family - usually I'm sweaty and snotty and on the verge of tears when the rest of my family is just eating away. While the food here was flavorful, it was definitely not spicy. Of the dishes we ordered, I would probably recommend the Cumin Lamb, just because that was the most authentic one in my opinion.

Service was mediocre at best. The food took a while to come out even though we were the only table that had ordered food at that point (the other tables were already almost done eating by the time we ordered). They also forgot our Sliced Pork with Spicy Garlic Sauce. So, although that's a cold dish, it came out last. They were also playing some sort of religious program really loudly on the TV, which was a little distracting.

At the end of our meal, they asked us if we'd be willing to pay cash instead of credit, which I was fine with. I think we got a little bit of a discount for that but unfortunately I don't remember how much. Anyway, I'm a little disappointed all in all. This was not a very satisfying meal for me or for my family.",NXwCnNHTI4kEQQTgXry5Xw,1,1,2,eZKAHiPI9yLYQh_HY7Gdnw

It's like Tom Coliccio's Crafsteak at MGM getting a bad review from someone who prefers to eat at Denny's.

This place is pretty good.  To give some flexibility and credit to the first reviewer, she probably wasn't too accustomed to eating Szechuan cuisine and probably did not know what to expect.  The cold appetizers are good, and you can choose up to three per plate.  We had the Szechuan style lamb (but substituted beef) and the ma po tofu, which was spicier than Jennifer Lopez (before her music career tanked).  

This place is definitely not for the bland at heart.

The Americanized, inexperienced Chinese food eater should avoid this place and go to one of those Chinese food places that sell lottery tickets and egg fu yung.  Those who want a spicier take on authentic Chinese food should check out this place.

We ordered 4 different dishes; the boiled lamb in hot pot, the pork intestines with hot peppers,  the pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot, and a cold dish of beef and tripe.

The boiled lamb and the cold dish were the best dishes; both were decently done, but not spectacular. The flavor was okay, the quality of the lamb and beef were good, and the portion was right.  It's what you would expect of a quality szechuan place.

The pork intestines with hot peppers was a bad dish.  The intestines were properly cooked, but there was ZERO flavor with the dish.  It was as if the intestines were just deep fried and then thrown on top of hot peppers and not even stir fried with the rest of the ingredients.

The pork blood and bean sprouts in hot pot was just all over the place.  The flavro was fine, but the pork blood was not good.  It was low quality and overcooked.  Then also within the dish were slices of bologna.  BOLOGNA.  YES.  WTF?!?!  Why on earth would anyone put bologna in this dish as a filler?  I have no clue.........plus it wasn't mentioned on the menu.

All in all, this place actually isn't terrible, but it's definitely not what I would call good. The service is actually good, and our waitress was quite accommodating.

Last night we ordered Spicy Boiled Fish and Kung Pao Chicken at J & J, then tonight ordered the same thing at Cheng Du.  J & J was okay, but their competition was amazing!  
Food here was good, considering we haven't eaten this sort of food in a very long while, but it just missed the mark for me.  The KPC wasn't as tasty, and it was short on peanuts, and missing that wonderful sliced toasted garlic which gives the dish so much taste. Boiled fish was enjoyable, lots of spice.  The best dish we ordered was the garlic A Choy.  Now that was the best Chinese veg dish I've ever eaten, and hubby loved it too. Very balanced, and slight smoky taste, very fresh, we loved it. 
A few reasons J&J fell short:
-we almost didn't go in because the place was completely empty. During our meal, only one other party of two came in to eat.
- waiter only came when we called him, and we had to ask for things like extra napkins more than once
- during dinner I distinctly smelled cigarette smoke coming from the back room where some employee was enjoying a smoke break.  Eeeww not pleasant.
- there was a very loud Asian singing show on the tv which was driving us crazy but the staff and other customers were watching it
The pluses: 
free hot tea with the meal

The spicy hot pots with lamb, beef, or shrimp is always a good staple and I always order some variation.  You will need 2 rounds (big ass bowls family style) to curb the burn.

We should have gone to BBQ King.

We started with a cold seaweed appetizer which was mixed with cilantro. This dishes flavor had a  nice pop to it because of the cilantro but the texture was mushy and overall- mediocre.

The appetizer  of cold chicken with hot and spicy sauce was okay. It really just looked like steamed chicken marinated in siracha sauce. It was rather disappointing really... but what can you expect when the exact translation of the dish is ""saliva chicken."" (gross)

The spicy lamb soup noodles came out in a giant bowl with almost a curry red and yellow color to the broth. It looked really promising. But then, when you got  a whiff of the soup, WOOOOO WHEEEEE! That's some game-y ass lamb! My mom and I each took two bites, and pushed it aside.

Her bowl of red braised beef noodles had very little braised beef and the giant bowl was really deceiving once you dipped into it for the noodles. I could have eaten a full 2 bowls of these portions in order to be full.

The restaurant is actually a step up in decor from most chinese fast food places. But... the waitstaff needs some serious training. Sure they smiled. Sure they took our order, but that was it. No checking back. And certainly no understanding of customer service when the food itself sucked. We sent back the lamb noodles and the waitstaff was totally puzzled. Like... this has never ever happened and they don't know WHY anyone would ever send food back. Even worse, the waitstaff didn't speak any english so outside of sticking my tongue out, squinting my eyes and pointing at the bowl of soup, they had no idea what was going on.

They still charged us for the lamb and didn't apologize or offer us an alternative.

We paid our bill and left.
Done deal. I felt really cheated and bad that the one time my mom and I get some time alone to have dinner together we ended up here.

The only saving grace is that BBQ King was just across the parking lot and a bowl of wonton soup there could chase these szechuan blues away.",qQecSd0lynfB4g-LPa9JCw,5,1,1,eTvEICdR8N-18uxigbGuhw

J&J Szechuan Cuisine is not a very big restaurant, but service was attentive and friendly, and I had my water refilled multiple times. It probably also helped that I could speak Mandarin. 

The interior is simple, but clean. The menu is of a decent size, though smaller than some places. 

Portions are decent for the price, and the appetizer 3-item combo for $5.50 in particular is a steal! The cold side dishes in the glass tray were all tasty, though I've seen slightly fresher preparations in California.

As for my food, I ordered a plate of three cold side dishes, a fish and tofu dish, and fried intestines. I love intestines, and the texture of the dish here was nice and crunchy, but the intestines were a bit fishy overall (not sure if that's quite the right term for the adjective I am thinking of in Chinese, i.e. ?). The fish and tofu dish, while light, was a little too bland. It had flavor, but was a bit watered down. 

Overall, I was still satisfied with my meal and had lots of leftovers. I've had much better Sichuan food elsewhere, but this place is not bad by any means.

P.S. The rice came in a very unusual and not-characteristically Chinese container, which I found somewhat amusing. There is a $1 charge for rice, but you get a decent amount of rice per serving.

P.P.S. $25 minimum for credit card.",lQCY0csLfjdDn6cdVq43UA,0,0,4,AmYsbnxHfLW_Feq4K9LjgA

I would have to say that I agreed with most of the articles picks for best Chinatown eateries, at least the ones I have been to. J&Js was my first attempt at the ones I have not tried, and I am already disappointed.

That is the reason I went to this place.  I ordered Kung Pao Chicken and told the waitress that I liked spicy food and on a scale of 1 to 10 with 10 being the hottest, I wanted my food to be 8 in spicy.  I told her a second time, I like spicy and wanted a lot of spicy sauce.  The Kung Pao Chicken came out with very little sauce and very bland, about what I'd consider a 2 on the spicy scale.  I was disappointed and do not understand that no matter what your instructions are, they bring out what they cook disregarding explicit instructions.  If restaurants want to stay in business, they better start listening to their customers.  The Hot and Sour soup was average and I would not order it again.  I told the waitress that my food was not spicy.  I thought I'd see if I requested something different, my request for extra spicy would be fulfilled.  I ordered Shredded Pork and Rice to Go and again requested an 8 in Spicy.  When I ate the take-out later that evening, it was bland with absolutely no ""heat"".  I was irritated and disappointed.  I do not like to give bad reviews and try to be fair because people's livelihood are effected by reviews, but it's time for those in business to listen to what the customer wants.

Back at the table we ordered ground pork and crispy green beans, mushrooms in a brown gravy and spicy crispy chicken and hot peppers. All really good, and all very very spicy. I loved it. My dinner date loved it.. we will be back!

The stuff off the buffet table was really tasty -- not overly salty, but also, not overly spicy either. I think the spicy beef at Yu Nan Garden is stronger in flavor.

5918593,2014-12-30,5,ssksLNNDZZfh_ydI78kDfg,"So I wasn't hungry when I dropped in to visit my friend at his storein Chinatown.  But it was lunch time, and they were craving this lamb hotpot that they said was really big and good from this Chinese restaurant I don't know about by their Chinese name.

The restaurant turned out to be J & J Szechuan Cuisine, which I had bookmarked to try their lunch specials earlier this year.  The interior of the restaurant looks and feels really vintage (not in a good way). But from experience, I know some of the best Chinese food are served at this hole-in-the-wall type restaurants.  After we were seated and handed our menu, my friends proceed to order the Lamb Hot Pot (which they said was off the menu).  Sounds good.  I love the whole secret menu concept.

After a fair amount of time has passed and we have completely demolished the appetizers and the Cold Noodle we ordered, the waitress finally brought out the hot pot.  The reaction from my friends was that this was not what they were served on their previous visit. The portion is a lot smaller (as in about half of what they were served the last time).  So instead of it being a hearty large portion that could be split with 3 people, it was just enough to accommodate 2 people at the most.  It was a good thing that I was not hungry to begin with.  The noodle was also cooked so much that you can't even pick it out with a chopstick, as it has pretty much been cooked to mush.  They spoke to the waitress and asked why this did not look like what they ordered previously, but the waitress just argues back saying we do not remember what we ordered the last time.  Considering the portion is less than half of what my friends ordered the last time. And he took pictures of what he ordered from his previous visit. I highly doubt that. Smh.

When they asked if it can be returned, since it was so different from what was served before, the waitress just said no!

To add insult to injury (or is it injury to insult? I wonder which is worst) one of my friend found a random string from who knows what in the Lamb Hot Pot.  We should have taken a picture of it first.  Because when we showed it to the waitress, she dismissed it as just a piece of noodle (It is right there on our table. Try eating it!). Then she said it was the string from the noodle package and just picked it up without offering an apology. Yeah, that was about the only smart thing she did. Get rid of the evidence!

So inconsistency in what is served, even if it is a secret off the menu item, is already a big red flag for me to never return here again. But the fact that a foreign object was found in the food and the customer received the ""No F Given"" attitude when confronted about it, is just the final nail in the coffin.

So yeah, even by Asian/Chinese restaurant standards, this place has crap service and subpar food.  Thus probability of return is less than 0.1%.  But in the event of a zombie apocalypse, I will bookmark this place since it will still be low on other people's list of places to scavenge for food.
