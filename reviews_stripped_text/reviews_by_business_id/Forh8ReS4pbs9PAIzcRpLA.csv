550521,2012-04-07,0,Forh8ReS4pbs9PAIzcRpLA,Ahhhh...just had a perfectly toasted everything bagel with their flavor of the day garlic parmesean cream cheese.  The restaurant is nice & clean with a comfortable seating area & nice decor.  I wish I lived closer cause I would eat here often.,HktpxyNS2B2E4tFts6Qh-g,0,0,5,kHcLf7Euy39yGi_sY51RFw

1589190,2012-09-15,0,Forh8ReS4pbs9PAIzcRpLA,"I had high hopes for this place. I gave it a shot after getting a deal on Living Social, and was disappointed. The ""bagels"" are not ""bagels"". They have a bready and airy texture, that of a bagel you would find at say.. Vons. There is no dense, chew that you expect when biting into a real bagel. Not only this, my order was wrong, and when we asked to dine in, they brought us a to-go container.. 

I'm sorry to say, but I don't see this place lasting much longer. They are blatantly overstaffed, and while the owner was taking our order, he had to stop TWICE to explain to the cook behind the counter how to read the order slip of previous orders.. 

With that said, the people working were very nice, and the establishment looked very clean and well kept.. 

Please avoid this place, the bagels are literally.. bread. They look impressive from the case! Large, fat, and enticing.. But don't be surprised when you bite into a dry bready bagel. 

Save your money, and go to Bagel Mania on Twain and Swenson. The bagels are infinitely better, and true New York style. I would know, I'm a New York native!",pCpWHjAiEf6ptK_W6Qb2jw,0,0,1,C2eHmDUtaTnJdi5i-rXATA

This place has gone through some change's/owners but they have finally gotten it spot on.  Good coffee, and bagels are just as they should be-soft on the inside and nice crunch on the outside.  I am not from NY, but this seems like it would fit the bill for many a Eastern seaboard transfer.",Ig4MBERqYl9fSjQRYSWOlA,2,0,4,e5n0Vj892yhBV_zVx6D_oQ
2263315,2012-01-26,0,Forh8ReS4pbs9PAIzcRpLA,"Bobby's serves up some pretty great bagels at awesome prices! I noticed this little cafe in the same plaza as German Bread Bakery during a recent bread run, and convinced myself to try it with the justification that GBB doesn't serve bagels. (I'm pretty loyal to my German breads!) What I discovered is a nice Jewish deli with fresh bagels and very friendly counter service.

I was impressed that I could order a cappuccino made with Illy espresso for only $2.89. It was served up hot and with a nice amount of foam. I also picked up 5 bagels and a bialy to sample, including a tasty blueberry bagel with a nice amount of fruit, and another sweet one coated in cinnamon. I was tempted by some turnovers overflowing with fruit fillings, and I also spied a rack with $2.00 loaves of pumpernickel and other discounted breads. In the end, I paid less than $8.00 for a half dozen bagels and a cappuccino. Bobby's beats the big bagel chains!",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,4,1,4,Kfl8NaUXuPy2CAZ6Xg0H6w
2359461,2012-08-27,0,Forh8ReS4pbs9PAIzcRpLA,"i read the reviews on Yelp and i bought the Groupon $10 for $20 worth of food. there is no menu online so, i went to Bobby's not knowing what to expect. it is really easy to find. it is really far from my house,but i had to try it out since the reviewers seem to rave about it. when i walked in, the aroma sucked me in. it is obvious they make everything fresh here. even at 1:30pm on a sunday, they still had nice selection of bagels. since it was lunch time, i went with a Turkey, Swiss sandwich and pick up the turkey , bacon sandwich for my husband to-go. the girl at the register is so kind , friendly, and patient even though i know she has been on her feet since 5am(they open at 7am, 7 days a week. close at 3pm). both sandwiches, with macaroni salad and cole slaw side, plus, 2 drink, was only $21! THAT'S cheap! they toast the bread in the classic European toaster and the meat was sliced right in front of me. they had plenty of kitchen staff that worked in sync with each other to expedite every order. mine was ready to go in less than 8 mins from the time of ordering. they even have fresh, homemade Chicken Salad, White Fish salad, egg salad, Tuna salad too. you can get 2 scoops on a bed of lettuce , or, you can have it as a sandwich. the Illy Coffee is out of this world. i am definitely coming back.",TPbGlI0S0atAURmNl3P_sw,1,1,5,7zedeQhGfr9Q4LO_HNq8GA

The counter girl could learn to speak up a little bit, and if you're sick, please stay home (she kept wiping her nose on her sleeve)

2633143,2012-06-23,7,Forh8ReS4pbs9PAIzcRpLA,"This is one of my oddest reviews ever...under the influence of post spinal injection Propofol...apparently I insisted to my driver/Momma that I REALLY had to have a bagel, stat after fasting NPO (nothing by mouth for all you playing the home game) Even though I hardly ever eat bread...High me is apparently a carb whore. Also, never eat bagels unless I'm back home in NY or a friend hand carries one. 

Anyway, I was told that I had my go to Pumpernickel with a schmear of veggie cream cheese & inhaled it in the car. Sexy. Guess I bought half dozen to go for the folks. They packed them in a PLASTIC BAG. Now I know I was high cuz bagels go in paper bags...and snotty me calls anything referring to itself as a bagel outside of NY ""round disks of dough with holes in center.""

For the half dozen I got: ANOTHER Pumpernickel (fat ass!) Salt, Everything, Cinnamon Raisin (x2 = Mom's fave) & a Bialy. Mom ""loved"" her Cinn Raisin but 11 years in the desert has done something to her and she eats friggin Costco ""bagels"" she cannot be trusted in this regard. Daddy proclaimed the Everything ""doughy"" but then he also said he hates that variety & it is his fave (FU Alzheimer's!!)

So, after a frantic text session w my trainer I guess all my hard work was not undone with one bagel & for good measure I will take a bite of one or two others. 

Judging by my folks' response: on par with Bagel Cafe, better than chains (duh) and Mom said place was clean, service friendly & prices reasonable. Perusing take out menu I agree & see they offer Dr Brown's sodas; Black & White Cookies, Danish, Rugelach & Kugel for those of the deli sweets persuasion. Savory options include: meats & cheese by pound, matzo ball soup, chopped liver, tuna/chix/egg salad & bagel sandwiches. Also a wide selection of Coffee drinks hot & cold & Chocolate Phosphate for old school East Coasters. 

In all, I'm told this is a nice addition to the Smith's Center @ Lake Mead & Rampart. Trust my Momma. Daddy did call his homey in Brooklyn and asked to have a dozen H & H's shipped. Stoned me created a diabetic monster. 

Verdict: AOk probably better for Non NYers.


****Mini update: the sea salt bagel is BBBOOOMMMBBBB just had a piece after stopping by Mom's after an early morning run 4* to sea salt (day old!!!)",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,6,4,3,wPXeQlVu5e6dbvaeNGvCiA

I asked them to ""deconstruct"" them, meaning not putting the bread on the meat.  We got potato salad and a pickle with it.    The pastrami was really good when I made it at home.    The bread, not so good.  If it was rye, it sure didn't look like it or tasted like it either.       The other day we went back to get the pastrami again and this time it did not even look like Pastrami.   It was not ""brisket pastrami"" but ""round pastrami"" no the kind I wanted.   The young lady behind the counter just told me that they get what ever is sent to them, and wasn't too helpful.    I will call the owner-manager tomorrow.

3916773,2012-08-20,1,Forh8ReS4pbs9PAIzcRpLA,"It's going to be difficult to not draw comparisons to Bagel Cafe, seeing as how I've been going there for years.  Not only did my heart belong to Bagel Cafe, but it's only 1 mile from my house as opposed to the 3 miles it takes for me to get to Bobby's.  But they won me over today on my first visit.  Follow my adventure...

I actually didn't know this place existed until the Groupon deal came up recently.  I Yelp'ed the place and saw how well rated it was, so I picked up the $20 for $10 deal.  The place is only open 7am-3pm, though, and I'm rarely awake during those hours, so I wasn't sure when I could use it.  My sleep schedule flipped over today, though, so 7am was around mid-day for me.

I walked in and was instantly greeted by the girl that worked there, damn I can't believe I'm forgetting her name.  I asked what was good for breakfast, and she said the grill was on and she was making breakfast sandwiches on a bagel.  SOLD!

""What kind of bagel would you like?""  ""Sesame.""
""How would you like your eggs?"" ""Umm.... (eggs are eggs)  Surprise me!""

** I lose a lot of servers here, as they're afraid to bring me something I didn't order, but she was up for the challenge.

""What kind of cheese would you like?"" ""Umm... (challenge accepted!)   Surprise me!""
""Do you want to add ham, bacon, or sausage?""  ""Yes.  Surprise me!""

Not scared in the slightest, she asked if I wanted a specialty coffee drink.  This I'm a little more picky about, so I ordered a vanilla latte.

She went to ring me up to pay, but I asked her not to, yet, since I had the Groupon and planned to figure out what else to buy while I ate.  No problems with that request either.

While I waited for my food, I looked over the menu and realized just how little I had spent so far.  Bagel sandwich was like $3.50, add meat for $1.25, and a vanilla latte was like $3.00.  She showed up with a huge, delicious beverage while I figured out my plan to burn off the rest of the Groupon.

The waitress showed up with a breakfast sandwich pretty quickly, and I was about to dive in when she asked me if I wanted to know what it was.  Sure.  Eggs over hard.  Muenster cheese.  Sausage.   She seemed proud of the combination, and I can't blame her as it was great.  This ain't no McDonald's breakfast.  And Bagel Cafe has nothing on the speed at Bobby's.

After my meal, I discussed my options.  I ended up with a half dozen of assorted bagels (3 sesame, 2 cinnamon, 1 oat), 1 small tub of nova cream cheese, 1 small tub of tuna salad, and 1 small tub of chopped liver for the ex.  I think I ended up paying like $1 or $2 over my Groupon after all that.

Here I am, 12 hours later, eating my second bagel.  Cinnamon bagel was a nice dessert/snack, but the toasted sesame seed bagel with the nova cream cheese on top is sooooo good.  This CRUSHES Bagel Cafe's nova cream cheese.  Bobby's has huge chunks of salmon, and it tastes amazing.

Good food, really friendly staff, great prices, there's not a lot to dislike about Bobby's other than their hours.  Sadly, I will likely not get to enjoy Bobby's very often.

Oh yeah, keep your eyes on LivingSocial this week... a little birdie told me they're running a $4 for $10 promotion for Bobby's, so you can try it out AND not feel like a glutton buying everything in the store like I did!

Oh yeah part 2, I'm sorry Bobby that owns Bobby's, but the video I posted below is Internet comedy gold.  The guy at 1:13 makes the video.

The bagels are made fresh and they are perfectly crisp on the outside, and flavorful and chewy on the inside. They also sell fresh baked breads, serve sandwiches, pastries, and have a small deli selection as well.  But, I keep coming back for the bagels.

I love the fact that this is a locally owned business and is on my way home from dropping off the kids at school. The service is quick and friendly.
