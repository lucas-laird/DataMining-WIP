62203,2010-11-11,0,oYWixgv1kiPV1j02TYzaPA,Delicious thai food at half the cost as other restaurants. Service is fast and friendly and the area isn't awful but seating is limited. Usually you can sit right down because there take out option is so popular. They also had an amazing duck curry (a favorite dish of mine) but took it off the menu because the price of duck was too expensive to offer the dish cheaply. But keep checkin to see if they bring it back cuz its worth it!,lVghs-Bwgh9aGKp4BxH7Yg,1,0,4,6NQl7SxgqM7WK8BGkAZPhw

I normally would go there and pick it up myself however I could not leave my office on this particular day, it took them over 2 hours to get me the food, I talked to the woman several times on the phone trying to explain to her where I was located which was not difficult to find. She had to go out on Charleston and take a left on 4th street that is all.  I could not believe they still charged me full price for cold food that took her 2 hours to deliver.  To say I was disappointed is an understatement.  If you are getting food from here I do not recommend having it delivered until they figure out how to understand directions or at least use GPS.  Still appalled that they charged me full price. I would have not written this review however this week I decided to give them a second chance but decided that I will have a runner in my office go get the food for me, I call to place my order and tell her that I want to pay over the phone.  It took over 30 minutes for me to place one order of the pineapple fried rice with shrimp, they lady did not have a clue as to what she was doing.  I will take my future Thai food cravings to Le Thai downtown just as good if not better than Mix Zone they are just way busier.",Wt8h3I54TSVVDl8vphyfJQ,0,0,1,tbPv72rX-oHTrzUYemovvw

By that, I mean, we were the only ones there. Towards the end of lunch, that hadn't changed much.  With the ""Best of LV"" reviews I've read previous, I was rather surprised there was no other customers.   Knowing this was a bad sign; we were parched and hungry from earlier activities and ventured inside.  We ordered the papaya salad, chicken on a skewer, pad Thai noodles, and a grilled pork plate.   Every dish we ordered was bland and lacking in ""wok hei.""    What is that you ask?  Wok hei is the Chinese term describing the fragrance of food that is cook correctly in a wok.  Also, it's a pet peeve of mine when drinks we ordered were served in plastic cafeteria cups.  I'm not 10 years old and am certainly not paying cafeteria prices.  After a $50 lunch bill for 2 adults and one restaurant phobic child, we were told that restaurant is under new ownership and would not accept the Restaurant.com certificate.

She was told to eat it anyway because they were still charging her for the meal, regardless of the quality of the food. Then she was told to take the food home to her kids.

There are so many Thai restaurants in town, it is difficult to find a favorite.  Let me save you some time and gas money, Mix Zone Cafe is the best Thai food you've never had. 

Friendly wait staff, good music, great lunch specials. 

Generally speaking, a Thai restaurant should be judged on three dishes:  Pad Thai, Panang/Red Curry, and Tom Kha.  These three dishes are simple staples of Thai cusine, and should be safe bets when dining in a new spot.  All three of these dishes have been delicious everytime I've ordered them.  The best card this Thai dream has up it's sleeve, is the varying degree of spice you can request with your dish.

Order from 1 - 4 stars; the higher the number the spicier.  They also have ""underground hot,"" which goes up to 100 stars.  I am a lover of hot foods; the type that clear sinuses and make you sweat.  I ordered the panang curry at 60 stars and it was almost too much, but still really flavorful .  Dare to be adventurous, go for the 100 star spice level but be warned, its no joke.

Bottom LIne:  Fresh ingredients really shine in the authentic Thai cuisine at Mix Zone Cafe.  Great for a quick lunch, or a delicious dinner.",sADnfWdDNhHnrox8vc4Kkg,2,1,5,j5cBwuaM_YGOP55_oOTyUw

1309308,2013-11-18,0,oYWixgv1kiPV1j02TYzaPA,"The hubby and I were starving and pulled into this plaza to eat. You know when you get a nasty feeling in your gut when you walk into a place but you are so hungry that you pretend you didn't feel it? Yeah, that was me at the door of Mix Zone Cafe. It's a dark and dirty looking place but it got pretty good reviews on Yelp so we gave it a try.

We ordered some chicken satay which was decent...a bit dry but the peanut sauce was yummy. We also ordered some curry chicken (the white curry) which was also OK. The lemongrass iced tea was a bit on the sweet side but still refreshing. The curry was OK. The noodles were OK. Everything was pretty much OK considering where we were eating (not the classiest joint, if you know what I mean). Everything had kind of a funky aftertaste, though, but we were so hungry that we didn't care....yet.

The wait staff was kind of strange. Telling me what I would like and adding things like we were at a nail salon. The house salad was horrid. Their house dressing was pretty much mayo squirted all over the top of some lettuce. When I asked our waitress if there was any other kind of dressing she seemed annoyed and took the plate into the kitchen. Then she came back and told me that ""he"" (I'm assuming she was referring to the cook) said since ""we have to throw it away now, you have to pay for half"". She was pretty straight-faced and awkward about it. What the?? I wasn't trying to get it taken off of our bill! I just wanted different dressing! She didn't even bring it back. 

I was a waitress during college so I have very high expectations from the waitstaff of every restaurant I go to. Personality goes a long way. If my waiter/waitress has a bad personality, it ruins my whole meal. I was pretty much done after that so we paid our bill (which ended up being almost $40 for lunch!) and left. They do have lunch specials which cost less. We just ordered off of the regular menu.  

 All I can say is, we were dragging for the rest of the day. Zero energy, gross feeling in our bellies, etc. Maybe it was all the MSG??? It felt like we abused our bodies for lunch. Why would I expect more from a hole-in-the-wall type of place in a shady strip mall?

And I stood at the front waiting to be greeted for almost 3 or minutes.

All three people saw me standing there waiting to be seated but not a one of them greeted me... Poor form and customer service to the max. Also very unprofessional move that they were talking about money and lost checks and servers getting scolded right there in front of me while I'm ordering. I understand that conversation may have started before I arrived but it shoulda stopped as soon as I came in.

I normally order the Thai beef jerky because this is one of the only Thai restaurants that I know the jerky comes with sticky rice. Normally sticky rice has to be ordered separately. They were out of beef but had pork jerky... I have to say not as good in taste as the beef jerky. 

The server was nice enough to still give me the lunch special even though it was like 2:56 when I was ordering. The food is overall good. But the service ands magnet is completely unprofessional. 

I also ordered Thai tea and I will never order Thai tea there again. Total rip off!! They have the ball shaped crushed ice and my cup was ALL ice with Thai tea mixed in it... I had to ask for a cup of water and mix that with my Thai tea just to suck it all out of the ice... I was so upset.

The fried catfish was just okay- lots of peppers and onions, good amount of basil, but spicier than expected. The three-color curry is hyped as being ""only available here!"", but the version at Le Thai is a bit better, this one was watery. I keep wanting to try their green curry fried rice, but it has been out twice now- which is baffling, considering they still obviously serve both rice and curry.

The Good: The food is good. The prices reasonable. It is independently owned. It used to be off the beaten path. I like those facts & tried to support this restaurant. 

The Bad: Over the years it has gotten busier & busier especially at lunch (the hospital people figured out its location.) The atmosphere used to be trendy &laid back, it is now rushed & kinda dirty. The food has always been SLOW to come out & is usually not ready when stated for picking up take out. Service has always been mediocre. I was able to overlook these points until today. 

Today as I was dining at a small table for 1 today and I was asked to move. Not to just another table but  to an even smaller crappier one.

My husband and I were at Walker Furniture, so I decided to take him there so we could try it out.  It was so good!

I got the 3 color curry and my husband got something that he usually orders (not pad thai...).  We asked for 2 or whatever gives us a kick without ruining the taste of the food.

2361225,2012-12-28,0,oYWixgv1kiPV1j02TYzaPA,"I thought I'd written a review for this place, but I guess not. I've been here maybe like 4-5 times over the last couple years and the first few times, I thought it was pretty good. I only come here for curry. I usually order the Panang curry and I get it really spicy. I  was in the mood for it yesterday and stopped by for the first time in maybe 6 months or so. My boyfriend and I agreed that they were off their game yesterday.

Firstly, my glass of water tasted funny. It had a weird... sort of floral flavor to it. I thought I was imagining things because my nose was a little congested and I thought my sense of taste was off, but then my boyfriend said that his coke, which was flat, tasted a bit like soap. I'm guessing they didn't rinse out our cups all the way. Next, my curry was all bamboo. I've had curry (and other dishes) where there were a few strips of bamboo in it, but it's not like it's the main part of the dish. My curry yesterday was just a mound of bamboo with sauce that went halfway up the pile. I found a few pieces of green pepper. I asked for chicken in it and I had like 4-5 small pieces. I had to really look for them underneath all the fluff.

There was just so much bamboo that after eating a few spoonfuls, I had to leave the rest of it. Don't get me wrong, I don't not like it, it's just that it was too much and I thought I got chicken curry, not bamboo with some curry sauce dribbled on top. To top it off, I asked for a 3 (you get to choose the spiciness, 1 through 4 with 4 being the hottest), but it wasn't even remotely hot. It was borderline mild. I remember coming here and starting to sweat over the 3 and 4 (wasn't in the mood for a 4 yesterday), but what I had yesterday felt like nothing.

Lastly, the bathroom wasn't terrible, but when I walked in, someone used the sink that was out of order, so it was backed up and full of dirty of water, someone had used up all the toilet paper, and whoever that person was, they didn't bother to flush.

So not only did I not really enjoy my meal, I couldn't even go piss out some soap water before we left.

I liked this place in the past, but I have reservations about coming back now. I would've given it a 4 before today. Maybe I'll try some other dishes if I ever go back, but I don't think I want to have their curry anymore.",Ylnzp7o02wCziyMdHmN8Tw,0,0,2,DsCd-nGiOWUxXq5-Gq8GQg

2621902,2011-01-04,0,oYWixgv1kiPV1j02TYzaPA,"Today I reaffirmed my opinion that Mix Zone is a bit Americanized, however done well.  We ordered the 3 Color Curry, the Dan Special, the pineapple fried rice, and the pad see ew.  I also ordered Thai Iced Coffee, and tried my friend's Thai Iced Tea.  Unfortunately, I would recommend giving both of these a pass.  The cream that they use in the Thai iced coffee is similar to the cream used in Vietnamese coffee.  It doesn't mix well with the iced coffee, and the coffee itself doesn't have a good flavor. 

The Dan Special is a flat rice noodle dish with scrambled egg, with a sort of mini-salad on top. It is covered by a sweet, slightly oily sauce.  This dish is not spicy at all, and I'm pretty sure it is an invention of the cook rather than a traditional Thai dish.  It was tasty though, and a yummy way to eat salad, although a little bit on the sweet and sugary side.

The 3 Color Curry, which this place is famous for, is an interesting curry.  It has some Indian flavors in it, and it isn't sweet.  While not very traditional for Thai curry, I enjoyed it.  

The pad see ew with chicken was a little bit sweeter than normal.  The chicken was slightly dry, but nothing to complain about.  It came with nicely prepared Chinese broccoli.  Other than the added sweetness, this wasn't a bad dish at all.

The pineapple fried rice was my least favorite of the bunch.  It had canned pineapple chunks, which is a big no-no in my book.  The rice was a little dry for me, and a little bit salty.  This is better than having greasy fried rice, and it definitely wasn't terrible, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  

Overall, I think that Mix Zone is a good restaurant, but it definitely is not traditional. This probably isn't a bad thing for the customer base that they are going for (there is a hospital right next door that filled the place up at lunch time).  Stay away from the Thai iced tea/coffee though.  Those were both really bad.",wOGfOjBaP-lCS1NW_En2LQ,2,2,3,DLxYlR_sd31XAzMCwn6LMA

I was in need of some beef and meatball noodle soup so I called ahead of time to place the order so that I could have the food ready when I arrived. They are really fast because when i got there it was ready and waiting for me.
The atmosphere is like any small asian food shop in a shopping center. Not too fancy but with just a touch of traditional thai elements around the room. The music was a chill loungy techno which made me feel like I was on vacation somewhere in Europe. The people greated me with a nice smile and where pleasant thru the whole expereience. Now on to the food.
 The bowl was overflowing with noodles. So much that I couldnt even mix in some extra spices with out spilling it out of the sides. The flavor was pleasant but not anything out of the ordinary. The only issue I had was that there really wasnt that much meat and veggies and was really just a bunch of noodles. I would suggest bigger bowls or just a little less noodles so that it isnt so overwhelming when adding any extras.
A warning to all of you non cash carrying people. There is a $10 minimum on credit/debit transactions. I ended up just ordering a Thai ice tea to go in order to bring it up past $10. 
The thai icetea was a let down. Every region of thailand has a different style of flavors so maybe im just used to everything being alot sweater. But it wasnt really great. Just ok.
Overall I had a pleasant experience and will definetly be giving it a second try for one of their lunch specials.  This is a great spot for a quick lunch or maybe a late night snack if they are open late.",H2HRJFCnSSM28Jdn0A_UTA,0,0,3,KOKuJK8j74eArc-GvORwrg

It is a typical Thai restaurant, but I'm a little bummed out with the fact that Chicken Pad Thai isn't included on the lunch special menu. My buddy decided to get some chicken dish that was on the lunch menu but I stuck to the pad thai and paid the normal price for it.

The Pad Thai was not very spicy at all when I had asked for it to be. No big deal though, I added some chili sauce and crushed pepper to my liking. The chicken dish my friend ordered was ""ok"" and wasn't really anything spectacular. The Thai Iced tea however was ON POINT!!! Loved it!! 

Service was ok...it kinda seemed like the waitress wanted to get us out of there as quick as possible.

I ordered the lunch special with green curry chicken. I've actually prepared green curry myself at a thai cooking school and tasted it many times-- it's my favorite of the thai curries because it tends to be the spiciest.

Service was prompt, and my server was a delightful woman who was very proud of Mix's Yelp certificate.  I decided not to eat all the curry but to take some home for lunch.  She packed the in a small container and also put a container of rice so I had some rice for my leftovers.  Then she stapled the bag shut so it was easy to carry.

Def wouldn't order it again.  Pot Stickers was whatever.  But the Three Color Curry though made the most impact.  Sweet, sour, and spicy all at the same time.  Loaded with veggies but only a few piece of chickens -;( Never less we still enjoyed it.

Came back a few weeks later with my sis again.  I love her BTW, she's always down to try new places with me even though we spend way too much money eating out and getting our *fat mode* on.

I have ordered from Mix Zone I think twice in the past year and a half.  Compare that to the almost weekly visits to other places like Pad Thai and Weera Thai and you begin to see a pattern.  It is not that the food is bad at Mix Zone.  The curry dishes are good.  The BBQ pork is fine.  I'm not a fan of thin bone-in grilled pork chops but the flavor is pleasent.  I guess the real reason I choose not to visit Mix Zone is that they do not have many options on the lunch menu.  Furthermore, when speaking of value, the price here is higher than at some places that still have quality food and more options.  It is nice that they offer a drink with their lunch special.

Staff is always friendly and good atmosphere!  I recommend this place...",A8hDu7xzn0pefcIY29rXHA,0,0,3,_DHIDdDJmCYQigNjthxqTw

An amazing blend of spice and flavor.  Definately a top pick!  The Thai Iced Tea cooled off the heat of the salad.  I tried the three color curry and it had plenty of kick at a number four, fresh veggies and tender chicken, with just enough lime leaf.  Others tried the panang and yellow curries, but I was partial to mine.  Great service with an attentive wait staff.",fL9eamFi8LvZg8eYm5flkg,0,0,4,JcoSgrGnfwAHSIFnF2W09Q

The Grilled Beef Salad ""grilled beef with red onion, tomato and cilantro, seasoned with lime juice and Thai chili"" ($7.95) was an easy choice as this is one of the Husband's favorite Thai dishes.  He initially chose ""Hot"" for their heat level and I reminded him that others have commented on how extra hot their heat was here.  So, he changed it to Medium.  Disappointingly, it was more like a Mild heat.  It was good, but we wanted the heat after all!

We also shared their signature dish of 3 Color Curry ""A Mix Zone special blend of red, yellow, and green curry and all their vegetables with choice of meat."" ($9.95) with tofu.  I also went for Medium too, but did wish it was spicier after we got it.  I also appreciated the mix of veggies in there - string beans, carrots, bamboo shoots, carrots, bell peppers and cucumbers.

Another incentive was that they were now offering all day lunch specials and a free brown rice upgrade.  Well, this wasn't the case anymore when we went.  (Although they still had the lunch special signage outside even though it was clearly dinner time.)  Brown rice now costs $.50 more.  And we also discovered they are no longer accepting coupons.  

Overall, we enjoyed our meal but left a bit disappointed.  The heat just wasn't there, so I guess it depends on who is working the kitchen when you go.  It's definitely worth checking out when they are running their lunch specials though!

The menu is not very big, but has good variety. I think thats the downfall of some Thai places in town is they are trying to do too many too much and some dishes fall to sub par.

Wanted to try this famous 3 Color Curry. I got it medium with beef. It had such an interesting flavor combining the three...I did like it but it was hard to place the flavoring but it was savory yet had a lemongrassy/kefir leaf kinda after taste which I dont know which color did that come from but I like. I think Misti hit it that it is a throwback to a Massaman.

Angela got Shrimp Panang and I took a bite and that was legit. Got eggrolls and they were decent. I really like the vibe of this place and our server was very sweet and chatted us up a bit specially about their 100 star beef noodle and that yes, the guy wears a gas mask and gloves while cooking it and will bring it out like he's carrying out something explosive. No entertainment today, but hopefully we one day get to cheer some one on the mission to eat it. 

I wont do it. We sat there with our 2 star/mediums and had a bit of a random heat flash. Kinda weird but it wasn't my mouth burning but I just felt hot like the chilies made my blood boil. Don't know what happened but I havent had that body feel without a firey mouth before. 

The lunch specials are the deal so coming back for some of those sometime. I liked it a lot that I'm coming back next weekend with the BF and probably his moms and grandma. Very curious to try their Pad Se Ew, Spicy Fried Catfish and Beef Jerky.. 

to be continued next weekend...

5129707,2013-11-06,1,oYWixgv1kiPV1j02TYzaPA,"I don't know what it is about Thai Places, but I never eat at the restaurant, I am always order to go.  Mix Zone is not an exception to this fun fact about me.  I've driven by this place many times and I figured I should give it a shot since it is so close to home.  After trying their food, looks like this will likely be my new usual Thai place.

Tofu Curry Fried Rice - This is outside of my normal ordering pattern, but I was intrigued when I saw it on the menu.  Normally, I don't order fried rice from restaurants because it is something I cook at home so often, but I rarely make curry so I figured, why not? I like spicy food so I ordered this dish at a level 3 spicy and it did have a kick.  The curry flavor was clear in the rice and it was filled with lots of veggies including green beans, which I really liked.  This was really enjoyable and I will definitely keep this in mind during future trips

Tofu Pad Thai - When you first try a Thai place you have to order the Pad Thai, it is almost the unspoken rule that this is how you judge a Thai Restaurant.  The noodles were cooked perfectly, the sauce was great, and the portions of everything were great.  This was a classic well done Pad Thai.  Mix Zone you pass the test.  My order came with fried tofu, which made me wish I could have a steamed option, but I won't hold that against them

I decide to wait 20 more minutes. Still nothing. I contact eat24 and they inform me there delivery drivers car broke down. I'm that's understandable but the lady really should've told me that over the phone instead of hanging up.

Ordering was difficult (due to me and my funky restriction) :) It went something like this :
----------------------
Me: ""I'm trying to avoid sugar - what do you suggest""

Waitress: ""Are you like allergic to sugar, because we have nothing that doesn't have sugar""

Me:""No, not allergic, just trying to avoid it... What about the duck""

Waitress: ""Duck prices have gone up, don't have any""

Me: ""the beef salad with no dressing?""

Waitress: ""Sure, how hot?""

Me: ""MILD""

---------------

I was then brought the hottest food I've ever eaten. Rather than being a total brat and sending it back, I attempted to get it down. I've never been so ""hot"" in my life! I felt nauseaus, the room was spinning, I downed 5  twenty ounce glasses of water. I don't get how you spice lovers do it :) . It was truely painful to eat ! 

So I know this was not ""mild"" because my coworker got the tri color curry also ""mild"" and it was perfect. A nice subtle heat that builds as you eat the dish. Not something that knocks you on your a** on the first bite. I realize heat levels are hard to ""regulate"", but it's one of my major pet peeves when a place can't show some consistency. When both dishes are ""mild"" and one is 10x hotter than the other there's an issue!!

On a side note, the tri color curry was fabulous and addictive and I completely understand the love it gets! One of the best currys I've ever eaten, although I'm hardly an expert in curry. 

After lunch my coworker and I were both feeling pretty lousy all afternoon. Not stomach lousy but I want to pass out lousy. Had trouble staying awake, killer headache, etc. After eating freaking lettuce + a few ounces of sliced beef and 2 bites of curry I shouldn't feel like crap! I suspect too much MSG, but I know I'm pretty sensitive to MSG so others may not be affected. 

Overall it was cute, homey, and the tri color curry was damn good. It will probably be awhile before I return - the MSG and the raging heat level on my ""mild"" salad have scared me off .",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,6,5,3,AbhKFAPYWkiRk6GV1JsBXA
