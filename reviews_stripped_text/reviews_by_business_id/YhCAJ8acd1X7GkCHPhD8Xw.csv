a bit pricey, but which rest in vegas that isnt? lol
nice huge tvs around the place if you want to watch games.
i loved my burger the patty was nice and thick & juicy. it was simple, but i could taste all the flavors.
chili and the waffle fries were okay nothing special about it.
the pickle was gross! i love pickles.. but not this one.
the tshirts the waiters were wearing were hilarious. 

my only complaint was that they don't do anything for birthdays! 
anything would of been cool! especially when they are charging ppl up the whazoo for a simple burger ;)",c9ljz9m6Fmmz6A8ITdubqg,3,0,4,jjFmOgnXqX_PPbDTfqFZTQ

That said the burger i had was pretty damn good and the shake was tasty, but should it take one and a half hours for 2 burgers and a shake?

Nup.

The staff was either super busy or doing nothing, the waiter was afraid to go back and ask the chef about some pretty basic easy changes for a burger joint.  The managers and hosts obviously didnt want to make eye contact with ANYONE!

My guess would be that the chef owner is a huge prick and has everyone scared and apathetic to the point of inaction.  Thats pretty bad just being open a couple weeks.  I asked the waiter and he gave a look and said ""hes from new york"" and rolled his eyes.

This was proven to not be the case

 Now I would have to say that I am a little bit of a burger snob. When it comes cooking a burger I will not tolerate a burger that is cooked past the point of medium and always want medium rare. Being that this place cooks hundreds of burgers a day I thought i would definitely get a MR burger.  Evidently on the day I dined the cooked missed a very basic instruction that is necessary when cooking any juicy delicious burger. Don't press a spatula down on a burger to make flames!

Overall, I received a dry (because of the pressing) medium instead of MR burger on a very high quality bun with great ""Blue Veined""(Not even Maytag) cheese and bacon along with a side of pretty cold fries. Not exactly what I thought I would be getting for 25 dollars. Now I have no problem paying 20.00 for a delicious, well cooked, high quality burger and this one was only high quality.

This is a gripe you will start seeing more and more from me. If you are some famous chef and you're tying your name to the feature burger joint of the 'INSERT CASINO NAME' you should take the time to design a few creative burgers. This is what you do.

The meat was completely lacking flavor, not cooked to order, and just not what it should be.  The first thing that pisses me off about a burger is if you can't serve it medium-rare when I order it that way. You're a burger joint, if you can't handle that then you might as well give up now. The bun wasn't great, very dry and typical. The toppings weren't good either, 3 for 3 so far!

I've been to BLT a few times now - each time the experience is pretty consistent.  I've had the lamb, classic, and buffalo - but my favorite by far is Shaft's Bleu.  It's really easy to screw up Bleu burgers, but BLT does it right -- not too much cheese, onions aren't too wet, etc.  Crisscut fries are great, as are the sweet potato.  I've only had one of the shakes but I can barely remember it, so I won't say anything on that.

Service is great and they really take great pains to ensure you get a good burger.  Case in point - 2 of our friends placed orders and then disappeared for 30 mins to find a lost cell phone.  I asked them to place the orders under the lamp, but the kitchen ended up bumping their orders to the top when they returned and gave them fresh burgers and fries within minutes.  Now that's quality service right there.

Burger is $13, fries are $5.  Pretty much what you would expect in Vegas.  I'd rank BLT higher than Le Burger Brasserie at Paris - but I wouldn't run across the strip to go to either one.

It wasn't particularly busy for lunch on a Sunday. The atmosphere was good, lots of televisions, a basic sports bar. It was a little loud, but this is expected for a casino restaurant.

We were seated quickly, but it took a while for the server to take our drink order and then even longer to take our food order. We had the BLT burger, the classic and we each had skinny fries. The burgers were cooked exactly as we ordered. They were a good size but still easy to eat and both were delicious! The fries were average, but tasted good. The pickle that came with the burger did not taste like a pickle at all. It was not good, one bite was enough for me.

Overall the food was much better than I expected, other than the pickle, everything was great. The service was slow and refills were hard to get, but our server knew the menu and had suggestions.

That said, this hit the spot for us. I got the BLT burger with sweet potato fries, and the boyfriend got the Kobe slider trio with buffalo fries. I learned a very important lesson here: always ask how big the burgers are, especially in Vegas. At home, I'm used to medium sized ""big"" burgers and and expecting an average size every time, so I forgot that everything is bigger in Vegas, literally. Welp. My burger was so high that it would've required two mouth-lengths (for lack of a better term) to even bite into all at once. That's not to say that it wasn't good. It was delicious, just very intimidating and I couldn't even finish it all. And with the prices that were charged, I felt very badly for not finishing the whole burger. The sweet potato fries were good (as always, I am a sweet potato fiend). I did not try my boyfriend's kobe slider trio (in hindsight, I should've gone with that instead - much more manageable portions), but we did share the buffalo fries and OMG! Amazing, amazing, amazing! I am daydreaming about them right now. Buffalo wing sauce, blue cheese dressing (mmm, mmm), and (I think) chopped green onions to top them off - just simply wonderful. I would and could make a meal out of just those. So, to recap - the food is great, the service was friendly and not overbearing, but the prices are a little shocking.

The staff is rude and just too cool to pay you any mind whatsoever.  After sitting for 10 minutes, our waiter (who barely spoke English) took our order.

My wife got the bleu cheese burger while I got the Cowboy burger.  She ordered hers medium well and I got mine medium.  The waiter got that backwards and we had to send them both back.

When we finally did get served, hers was nearly inedible with the amount of bleu cheese that was on there.  It also had no texture: soft all the way through with no lettuce or tomato for some crunch.  My Cowboy Burger was better, although the barbecue sauce they use is way too spicy. 

I got the skinny (shoestring) fries which were so overdone as to be nearly teeth-breaking potato chips.  She got the thick fries (wedges) which were covered in that orange special seasoning some places use.

We sent her burger back again and she didn't eat.  They took her burger off the bill - acting like they were doing us a great favor - so the final tab with my burger, two fries and two diet cokes was over $30 (soft drinks $3.50 each!).

They advertise 'combos' on the menu, but that only covers the classic burger and the turkey burger.

We were ravenous, considering that our morning flight had been delayed for over three hours and we hadn't eaten anything substantial all day (with the exception of over-priced airport lattes and pastries). We were pleasantly surprised.

It was an odd hour, about 4:30 in the afternoon, and there were limited dining choices open at the Mirage. We were hungry but not really in the mood for the mile-high pastrami sandwiches at Carnegie Deli, or California Pizza Kitchen. So BLT Burger it was.

My boyfriend ordered the Tex Mex burger while I ordered the turkey burger. Both were juicy and cooked to perfection. For me, one of the true tests of a good burger place is the bun. At BLT, the bun was reminiscent of a good onion bagel but much softer, with bits of onion on the top.  The menu had a good balance of classic items as well as more exotic options like the lamb tandoori burger and kobe sliders.  We also shared an order of waffle fries and onion rings which were perfectly crispy, not greasy at all.

The overall energy was casual and laid-back, with wait staff wearing funny t-shirts that said things like ""Always use a condiment"". The service was friendly and helpful. Originally my boyfriend wanted to order the buffalo fries, but quickly canceled that when he found out it was topped with crumbles of bleu cheese (or what he like to describe as ""nasty, stinky, rotten cheese""). Figuring that my boyfriend wanted the spice without the bleu cheese stench, our waiter  served our waffle fries with sides of ranch and buffalo sauce.

It's $13 for a plain cheeseburger and when I say plain, that is what it is.  No special sauce, no mayo, just a bun, burger, lettuce, cheese, tomato, onion and pickle.  It wasn't horrible, but I guess I was expecting a little more flavor for $13.  You get a half of a pickle with your burger and if you want fries, it's an additional $5.  My daughter ordered the corndog and it seemed a bit smaller than your average sized dog.  They did provide her with more than enough fries that she was able to share with me.  I found their skinny fries to be rather good and not too crispy or burnt.  

Our bill was $84 including tip for 3 burgers, 1 fry, 1 corndog and drinks.  A bit steep for a mediocre lunch.",wVanzGVjZ0KZi4RydIsUzA,2,0,2,sAV61q5Si-i6499C8gJ36A

530572,2010-01-27,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"After visiting Downtown Vegas and the Outlet Mall, it was 2:00 pm and we needed to grab a quick lunch.  We stumbled upon BLT Burger and were happy to find that 1) there was no wait for a table and 2) that they had the NFL playoffs shown on tv's throughout the restaurant!

The menu is basically just a bunch of unique burgers, wings, sides and milkshakes.  My mom and I decided to share the lamb burger, which was topped with tzatki sauce and fresh fixings.  It was cooked perfectly, nice and pink in the middle, and was a fun spin.  My dad tried the slider trio; he ordered them medium rare and they were practically mooing still!  He thought that they were the best sliders he had ever had, and they really do cook to order!

We also tried the chicken wings, and the onion rings (yummy), but our favorite part had to be the Malibu Barbie Milkshake!  It was under the ""Spiked"" Milkeshake section and had Malibu Rum in it....yummy!

Next time I am in Vegas looking for a mid-priced meal (burgers were around $12 with no side), I will go back to BLT Burger for sure.

Funny side note, after we ate, my mom and my sister went to go and  see the white tigers....only to find out, the restaurant is now located where the White Tigers used to be kept!  They moved them into the Dolphin Habitat and now you have to pay to go and see them...boo!",NFgvM7LMx5Ocsxr7J2_sVA,0,0,4,0t7qhbpm09lGgCt4PuNPCg
532808,2013-04-03,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"My son who does not live in Las Vegas told me about BLT Burger and their milkshakes. He said they were some of the best milkshakes he had ever had. So I just had to hunt this place down and give it a try.

When you get seated, which only took about ten minutes, you see there is not much to call decor. The restaurant is fairly plain but comfortable. It took quite some time before we were acknowledged or asked if we wanted some water. But they were very busy, so maybe that is a good excuse.

When our order was taken I was a bit bothered by the burger combo. It was on the menu as a burger, fries and a shake. Well, you could only order one of the burgers to be in the combo because of the cost. You also had to select from the less expensive shakes for the combo. The other shakes were a dollar more, so the combo was a dollar more as well. You could get onion rings though. They were the same cost as the fries so no problem there. Plus the discount for getting a combo was only 50 cents. I get more of a combo discount at fast food burger joints.

When the food arrived I do have to say that the shakes were very good. The size was nice and it was very creamy and flavorful. The cost was six for some and seven for others. Well worth the price. The burger was OK. But that is all I can say about that. I would rather go to other places and get a better burger at half the cost. The fries were served nice and hot, but they lacked flavor. You are not going to miss anything by skipping the fries. Overall the price was too high, the service very lackluster and the food only OK. Don't bother with this place unless you just want a really good shake.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,1,0,2,VnWm8uCcOF_ETaEpNDc6_Q

I was on the strip yesterday and needed to grab lunch with a couple colleagues and we had heard that there was a new burger bar at The Mirage and figured we would try.  All 3 of us prefer food to just about anything else so it was a leap of faith to go to a new place without yelping first (please hold the....serves you right comments)

BLT is a new boutique burger and shake restaurant at The Mirage with an acclaimed chef, Laurent Tourondel. 

We were seated pretty quickly but given a table toward the back of the restaurant by the kitchen so didn't really get a great feel for the décor, but then again we came for the food. 3 hungry guys mid day for burgers and shakes, what could go wrong?

The waitress was attentive and helpful but based on some small talk; she is a bit disappointed in the crowd and mentioned the slow economy and hoped it would pick up.  After ordering drinks and burgers and some fried pickles, we were all excited for the food. The shakes and soda took about 10 minutes but came and the shakes were decent. The Twinkie Boy was tasty but tasted like a vanilla shake with a touch of Twinkie, wish I had gone with the PB&J shake that went by....that looked yummy.

The pickles came and wow! They were tasty; juicy, crispy and all around great when dipped in the spicy ranch dip. For $5, would have expected more than 8 pickles slices (about a half pickle total) but they were awesome which really helped my rating. 

On to the main course.....our burgers and sides come and we are psyched. We made sure to get 3 different sides so we could experience them all... 
1)Onion Rings- greasy by any standard and way too much batter
2)Waffle Fries- good but cold...must have been waiting for the burgers!
3)Skinny Fries- hot, cooked perfectly, though a bit salty.

Now the reason we came...the meat!
Burger 1- The Kobe w/ Swiss and grilled onions- Not mine, but the headline from Raf was ""pretty good but just a burger""

Burger 2- The Classic w/ Cheddar, Bacon and their ""BLT sauce""- Again...burger was fine, but the exact words Paul uttered were.....""Would prefer a double-double from In-n-Out""

Burger 3-.....This was mine and the real reason for the post/rant

I ordered the Classic with Grilled Onions, Lettuce, Tomato and their Vermont Cheddar.   Now; my burger had been ordered Medium so when it showed up with an ""MW"" toothpick in it, I began to get skeptical. It's a burger and since I don't think I have ever sent back a burger, I figure I will try it. One bite tells me that this thing is Well Done....Gray all the way....the only red/pink I could find would be my ketchup....so, I showed the waitress and with her eyes she told me that ""it happens all the time and this place really sucks to work at!"" She took it back while my friends began their burgers and I snacked on the cold, salty, greasy fries. 

She told me that they chef looked and said it was Medium but would make me another.....was she kidding? Not only did it have the wrong toothpick in it and no pink but this is customer service for a brand new place charging almost $20 for burger? Whatever....

So, everyone finished their burgers and mine shows up....boy did the chef show me.    How about some guesses for what toothpick held the bun together this time?????

Obviously, it wasn't the Medium one I would have liked; it was MR, for their Medium Rare. I pointed it out as she served it and she shrugged.  So as I get ready to take a bite, I notice that it does have the grilled onions but also has raw red onions....really, if you order your onions grilled should you have to tell them to leave off the raw ones?
Well, I can tell you that the toothpick with MR was wrong...Should have said R, for Raw, not for Rare. No exaggeration here, it was still cold in the middle.  

At this point, I clearly was done with this joint and had the manager come over. When she saw the burger, she actually agreed that it was undercooked for Rare and not even close to Medium and took it off the bill graciously. (they've been open for a month but she has already mastered the...""I'm sorry, let me take this off the bill for you!"") Again, this is the first time in 20 years of eating out at least 10 times a week that I refused to pay for something.   

Chances are 
A)  This place has way too many issues to get it fixed quick enough
B)  The waitress is probably already looking for a new job
C)  The Mananger seemed beaten in less than a month of being open. 
D)  The chef should thank the folks that acclaimed him in NYC and go back to the concepts that he must have found success in since this one will likely not cut it.
E)   In a city with as many food choices as freaks, I can't imagine anyone eating at this place more than once.",FLmu8E-MjRAM9YVllvt52A,3,0,2,o_F45I-7wrjlcqmZPAl8nA

First of all, I know what you're thinking: why just a plain vanilla milkshake when there are so many other options on the menu (Nutella milkshake, for example)?
Well, sometimes I just want a good old fashioned vanilla shake. When they're done right, that's really all you need. Let me tell you, it was done right. Perfect thickness and sweetness!

The Tex Mex burger was scrumptious. I couldn't stop commenting on it while we were eating. The chili on the burger was good by itself: just the right amount of kick, and a little corn for texture. The slice of avocado were freash and creamy, and the beef itself was juicy and flavorful (I ordered mine medium).

As far as price goes, it is pretty pricey. You can get combo of one of three simple burgers, a shake, and fries for $21. The Tex Mex isn't a simple burger...so plan on spending around $30 with tip.

My fiance and I went and could have ordered 2 burgers, 1 order of fries, and 1 shake and it would have been more than enough...2 meal deals was way too much food, even for buffet champs!

Good service and a delicious selection of beers, shakes and fried items. The fried pickles are the most delicious. The burger's my group had were all cooked perfectly and were delicious. I personally had a Kobe burger with bacon. It was the best burger I have ever had. The Kobe patty was delicious, juicy and unforgettable. The star of the show however was the bacon. It did not take over because to proportion was small enough, but DOUBLE SMOKED BACON and cheddar made the Kobe even better. Double smoked bacon is a delicious German treat that smokes for around 24 hours which is significantly more time than regular bacon (4 hours give or take). This bacon will blow your mind when added in the right amounts. I cant wait to have the same meal again every opportunity that I am given.",Ej3FjEvnzJE4TisXCs4ypw,2,2,4,oRJCVGDrZM-pHq9oBaDU1w

1047052,2009-01-19,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"Went to BLT Burger for the first time for lunch on Friday 12/26/2008. BLT Burger is located at Mirage Casino and Hotel. Walked up and there was a little bit of a line and waited for only a few minutes. Looking into the restaurant I was surprised how nice it was inside. Nothing special but nicer then I expected for a burger joint. Nice atmosphere for a place like this for lunch. Service was just average at best. Had to give up my first born (if and when I have one) to just get my water refilled. The waiter was pretty nice he joked even though I'm sure he heard a thousand times I'll take a white tiger burger. He said they have been out of them for awhile..lol. The fried pickles are pretty good but nothing to go to Vegas for. My first complaint is you can only have a combo with the classic burger and can't substitute it at all. So that is pretty stupid in my opinion. Considering I wanted a cheaper burger then the classic but willing to pay the higher price for the combo. We ordered the BLT, Tex-Mex, and Turkey burgers. My friend that had the BLT seemed to like it however when I tried it it was pretty much like a Big MAC with bacon. I was not a fan at all! Other friend got the Tex-mex burger and he hated it! I thought it pretty much sucked when I tried it. The Chili on the burger was plain at best and just lacking of any flavor. I got the Turkey burger and I thought it was decent. Had good spices and the onion rings were good. For a burger here I would skip it. I've not had In N' Out burger but I'm going to guess its a lot better and a lot cheaper. I did not get the Milkshakes since I was pretty hungover from the night before already. The milkshakes are what you come for from what I understand. I would like to go back and just get a spiked milkshake in the future. For a turkey burger and onion rings total was 18.32 before tip. Amount of food was pretty good but not worth the price. I would eat here again if I had to and would pretty much only stick to the turkey burger.

Ordered the veggie salad with grilled shrimp. The salad is about the only thing you can order if you're trying to be careful. With that said, it was very, very good. Lots of vegetables, great dressing and the shrimp add-on was outstanding.

Now to be fair, the fried pickle appetizer was delicious.

This burger is amazing and become a must have when in Vegas.  I've tried to make it at home to no avail, upon mentioning it to the bartender he said he's tried to copy it at home without success as well.  It is a triumphant burger that outshines the numerous other amazing offerings at this place.  If you haven't had it, stop in and get it.  
Like other BLT restaurants, there is a lot to choose from on the menu and it all looks great.  Each burger here is great.  The fried pickles are fantastic and are worth a shot provided you like pickles at all.  The beer and milkshake selection here is also very impressive.  
Regarding the prices here, it isn't CHEAP cheap, but you're going to get high quality food at a better price point than a lot of other places.  Instead of stuffing yourself on low grade food at a buffet (for the same price or more) or dropping $40-50 per entree at a gourmet place, a burger from here is a bargain in comparison.

While the burgers are good, (try the Kobe burger cooked Medium) the real reason to come here is for the milkshakes.

While packing up in our room (At The Mirage) we saw a clip for their new Burger joint. The ""SPIKED SHAKES"" hooked us! We headed downstairs and finally located BLT in the far back corner of the casino. We sat right away and the wait staff assisted right away. Our waiter was nice, but seemed new- you know how that goes! :P
We ordered 2 burgers, 2 SPIKED shakes (I recommend the Night Rider if you like chocolate!) and since they didn't have chili cheese fries ON THE MENU, we ordered a side of chili and criss cut fries. BEST CHILI EVER! seriously. I recommend splitting a burger though cause they are VERY large! Filled us up all the way home to LA! :)",S17pN9eBS4oJHCgAb626ow,1,1,4,bZIxOkBS_VlB_f6qJDHQDA

Before coming on my Vegas trip I has seen this place on the food network to find Vegas's best burger. The Shaft Blue was the winner so I thought hey why not visit this place again and be amazed. 

Sad to report the burger was juicy for like 2-3 bites then it got supper dry, keep in mind  I ordered the burger medium. I have an idea that if you pay 3-5 times what a fast food burger cost it should meet a specific expectation. This left me so unimpressed when I could cook better in my own kitchen its a bad thing. For the pricing and what you get it was not worth it. I could admit the shakes looked amazing although I did not have then I think 2 burgers, 2 cokes, and shared fries for $50 is not such a good deal if the food is mediocre.

Just inside the entrance to the Mirage is BLT Burger. I have tried many burger joints on the strip and this one is by far my favorite. I usually order The Classic, a 7 oz. Black Angus beef burger ($12) and one or two of their 20 or so draft beers. 

This time I spurged and ordered the American Wagyu, a 7 oz. grilled Snake River Farm American Wagyu beef ($17). It was outstanding!  

Instead of my standard beer order, I tried the All Nighter mikshake with Kahlua, Bailey's, espresso and coffee ice cream. The meal was very tasty, but I learned I'm more of a burger and beer guy.

1471538,2010-03-16,1,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"So we found this place because a group of friends were staying at The Mirage. We came here on Sunday morning when it turned into daylights savings time and they turned us away because they said the kitchen closes at 3:15am (mind you, it just turned 3 because of the time change and they still didn't offer a seat after their 3:15 explanation).

Anyhow, we all got seated relatively quickly for a Sunday lunch. We all got different burgers. I had a bite of the salmon burger, quite interesting but wouldn't be surprised if it was just canned salmon with some fancy shmancy sauce. I got a burger that had onions, mushrooms and bleu cheese. I also added a fried egg for 1.50. It was definitely a 3.5/5 tasting burger--I probably couldn't get over the fact that all of our burgers, though medium rare came out in different shades of pink to brown. The taste was good... but 14 something bucks for this burger seems on the pricey side + because mine came with cheese, I didn't have to add it like the other burgers. It was a reasonable size but for 14 bucks I think I could get a better burger elsewhere.

We tried some of the different sides. They were all about 5-6 bucks.
Sweet potato fries: 3/5 - Average, still would put Boiling Crab and Father's Office over this place
Onion rings: 5/5 - Really good combination of batter to onion
Jalapeno poppers: 4/5 - Pretty good here
Waffle fries: 2/5  - You think cheese and sour cream would save this side, but it doesn't.

I did enjoy the decor of the place, looks pretty hip. The kitchen is in the center of the restaurant and they have this cool artwork of what looks to be like the road to Vegas (from California).

For 4 burgers, and 4 sides, it came out to about $25. I think I'll check something out next time, this place was more out of convenience.",bW6VMyB5r05Yze44Ora0pA,1,1,3,9mFlE3b9QphzLC1xNNqGoA

That is very sad because the extra upgrade is $7.00 and up.  2nd Kobe Beef Sliders:  Looked great.  However, when we received them, they were ice cold to touch.

Perusing the restaurants list (which changes constantly in this town like the hotels) I noticed a listing for a place at the Mirage with the familiar acronym 'BLT'.  Having tried the  Bistro Laurent Tourondel steak place in Hollywood back home, I was intrigued enough and seeing the number of positive yelp reviews I convinced my friends this would be our lunch spot sometime before the end of the weekend.

So to cap off our sunday lunch we made our way to the Mirage resort to find a nice open air, indoor burger joint with hip club lighting, decor and audible but not overly loud R&B and hiphop music playing over the speakers.  Our waitress was friendly and cheerful and service was nice and fairly quick.  All of us ordered different burgers, me going for the lamb tandoori which i ordered med rare.  My friends ordered a couple different more traditional beef burgers which I can't remember but all of them were cooked really well, fat, juicy with some of the best sweet potato fries on the side that I've ever had.  Even FO's fries back home in LA weren't as crispy and well seasoned as these and honestly I'm not a big fan of the 'sweet potato' taste and these were much more subtle and almost tasted like regular potatos with a hint of the sweetness making them stand out.

Alcoholic milkshakes also made their way around the table, my friend ordered a Kahluha oreo cookie mudslide and i got the Malibu Barbie which I found a better choice than the heavier chocolate rich drink.  Almost like drinking a pina colada ice cream sundae in a glass it was the perfect way to finish off a great lunch and a fun weekend.  

I suspect I will be coming back here some day especially given they run til 2 am, making them a quality late night food haven after clubbing or taking a break between venues.",C9WHeAxjoR9Nxo7l-Y-F0g,0,0,4,Gu48a-_5b0K9VWMXJ--AJQ

We had the fried Mac and cheese and the buffalo shrimp off the happy hour menu for an app and then I had their specialty blue cheese burger for dinner. The Mac and cheese was good . Crispy outside and cheesy inside. It did fall apart once you took your first bite and it was served with a pomadoro sauce I suppose to play off it's similarities to fried mozz. The buffalo shrimp were amazing until they very last one. My last bite had bits of shrimp shell and grit that I fear was from a shrimp that had not been cleaned properly. The burger was great however. Cooked to a juicy medium crispy bacon with tart blue cheese. We also got a side of sweet potato fries which were the big Debbie downer of the meal. Don't get them. Unseasoned cardboard sticks. Maybe I got a bad batch but I won't be trying them again. How do you mess up fries other than sandbagging then and leaving then under the heat lamp?

Then..... we sat, and waited for our server for at least 10 minutes; (and not a I'm impatient 10 min, a real 10 min)  Finally, a very impersonal  serer came over to pour us some water.  No hello, no name, no welcome.  As someone who manages restaurants and trains servers and has been one, our server was super disappointing.  The entire meal she could have cared less about us.  Most of the order was right when it came, just a few fry miss orders, which the food runner fixed immediately.  

On to the food.  My ""classic"" burger was cooked MW as I ordered.  The bun was soft and the produce fresh.  I added Oregon Cheddar and CRISPY bacon which I got (yeah, I hate soggy bacon)  They defiantly skimped on the cheese though.  The patty its self had no flavor or seasoning, at least it wasn't over cooked.  I ordered the waffle fries (which I had to ask for when my burger came).  The fries were good, not super hot but seasoned well  Everyone at the table ate all their food but had no RAVE reviews.  My BF got a black and white shake, which is a mix of vanilla and chocolate, it was good, a little too chocolate but the whipped cream on to was amazing!!  All of our sodas were flat when they came to the table, so we informed our server.  She brought more flat soda, so we stuck with water.  She still charged us for the sodas even though we informed her twice and no one drank them.

The sides and shakes really brought the place down.

I ordered the Classic with BBQ Onion and Vermont Cheddar.  The onions were a sauteed mix of onions in bar-b-que sauce. It was so good. It was cooked perfectly to my request (I was warned they were cooked a bit under - so ordered medium well). Really loved the burger.

The sides were such a disappointment. There were four of us and we ordered fat fries which were served cold and kind of mushy. The onion rings were warm and crisp, but nothing special.  My least favorite was the fried dill pickles that my group ordered.  They were doughy/breaded so thick and huge - but not breading. It was kind of sweet, like a donut. A pickle donut. So, sandwiched in the middle of this dough was a little hamburger-slice style of dill pickle. Not my thing. At all. 

Went back at about midnight the next night to get shakes to go. Was surprised to see the shake mix come out of a soft-serve style machine.  I got the Twinkie Boy which tastes exactly as it sounds - a Twinkie all mixed up in a shake. It was average. I was on a sugar high for the rest of the night.

It was made with chocolate ice cream, oreos, and kahlua topped with a ton of chocolatey whipped cream.  The fries were fresh and crispy. 

That's where I should have stopped.  I ordered the BLT Burger, but substituted turkey burger for beef.  It left a lot to be desired.

Now, don't get me wrong, the burgers are solid. In fact, if quality burgers aren't a regular thing for you, this place may blow your mind. But alas, the burgers just aren't as juicy and flavorful as other burger places in town. 

There are a lot of burger options to choose from, though, including lamb, vegetarian, etc. - so there are legitimately more options here than other burger places.

Everything else on the menu has been great (waffle fries, onion rings, chili, etc.). The two best things about BLT Burger are the jalapeno poppers and adult milkshakes.

The jalapeno poppers are long and thick. They deliver a powerful punch of spicy and come with a spicy salsa-type dipping sauce to dip them in (double spicy!).

The adult milkshakes are an absolute must (a.k.a. milkshakes with alcohol). I have repeatedly taken tourists here just for the milkshakes. I personally recommend the Malibu Barbie (coconut fruity goodness). The milkshakes are tall and thick and so deliciously yummy. Beware, though, the shakes are incredibly filling.

The server asked how we wanted the meat cooked, medium rare and dressing on the side.  The meal came - the beef on the salads was so tough you couldn't eat it and it was cooked until it looked like shoe leather.  The server came by, we complained and she took the dishes back to the kitchen.  then nothing.  The men finished their burgers and we waited and waited and waited.  I finally asked for the manager after watching the server wander around doing nothing.  He came, we explained and he was almost snotty when he said well he'd take care of our bill and go find the missing salads.  He came right back so they must have been just sitting there.  The steak was still overcooked and tough and the salad had one cherry tomato cut in half and a pile of spinach.  It was horrible and neither my friend or I finished ours.  It was so bad that I actually complained to the hotel operations manager.  First, if you are going to advertise a salad as a special, make it special.

The good: The shakes were phenomenal. Literally the best I've ever had which is saying quite a bit cause I've had them from many places. Prices are $7-$9 I would go here just for the shakes and the Berry me is out of this world.

The meh or OK: Being a burger place in a beautiful hotel like The Mirage, you expect great food especially for the price. However the burger fell somewhat short of that expectation. It was more towards the greasy side and literally had a pool sitting on the plate. Note: not juicy as there is a difference between the two,  I tried my partners burger and it was outstanding. Maybe I just made a bad choice or had a burger that had a bad day. Would be enough to still make me come back and try another in hope for a better taste.

The horrible: Having a career in hospitality and working in Retail, Hotel, and Restaurant hospitality, the service here was disappointing, nonexistent, and surprisingly appalling. Once seated it took a good 15 minutes to have a waiter come by and take our order (food and drinks) as we had plenty of time to figure out what we wanted. After waiting 30 minutes for the food to come out (which is ok) a different waiter brought our food out and walked away without even asking if we needed anything else. The bottle of Ketchup was empty and we couldn't find a waiter, so I had to go to another table and swap out bottles. Our waiter showed up at the end of our meal asking if there was anything else he could get us and when we said no, he magically protruded a check already printed out. The service at a restaurant is very important to me and this experience was enough to not make me want to come back

The restaurant wasnt very busy so i feel like the dining experience should have been better. Maybe we will try this place again in the future...or just stop by for a shake. .",7-TZM9-8rEHBiH1HCQzbgA,0,1,3,rRvqcc0acuNip2o-xJdzOw

The cab burger had mushrooms, bacon, frisee and truffled aioli. The flavours of the smoky bacon overwhelmed the umami of the truffles and mushrooms. The burger itself was a little on the dry side even though we ordered medium rare.

The rosemary garlic fries fared a bit better although they weren't shoestring fries. They were crisp with a subtle hint of rosemary and beefy flavours.

The s'more dessert was way too sweet containing peanut butter, melted marshmallows with the graham crackers dipped in super sweet milk chocolate. There was no textural contrast between the softness of marshmallow and the crunch of cracker. On top of it, it wasn't very warm.

For being a gourmet burger restaurant on the heart of the strip of Las Vegas in the Mirage, this place does not measure up to par. However the fault and the experience was not diminished by the whole staff. Personally the only thing that was outstanding and really is the glue holding this place together is the wait staff. So humble, so attentive to your every need, not once did I have to ask for a refill. They where always there like Eve was to Adam. Thank you wait staff at the BLT Burger.

Now the food was another story. See when a place like this is grinding their own meat, its something special. I decided to go with the Highway 80 burger and I told the nice waitress I wanted it cooked medium, she nicely replied that itll be pink in the middle and I nodded in reply to show that I comprehend.  Excited to have a 15 dollar burger that might be worth every penny, I  recieve a well done burger. Now what kind of chef, wait no wrong title, I meant to say cook, overcooks ground beef? Cmon man. Is it that BLT burger has gotten into the habit of what every franchise/company does by hiring desperate underpayed, unexperience and unmotivated cooks who cant even cook meat to its appropriate temperature and serve fries that have been sitting around and where stale and cold.

Please dont make the same mistake I did. This place is over priced and is just meeting their quaterly profits by pure hype.

And the Hangover wins.....

It was our second day in Vegas and lets say it was a good first night. We were determined to make it to the pool especially since we had already paid for our reserve lounges at the pool at the Mirage. 

Per recommendation from a pedicurist at the spa in the Aria, we decided to give BLT Burger a try and it was well worth it.

Drinks: Some of us went for the Bloody Mary. I had a sip of it and it was not good. I don't want to say awful but it was pretty close. I like a spicy bloody mary but I nearly choked on it bc it had a strong kick to it and wasn't a building heat. The tomato juice tasted to sour for my taste. I was not impress. 

Appetizer: We got a plate of fried pickles. They were great. Fried in a light almost tempura like batter. 

Burgers: I had the Shaft's blue burger. The bun was light and soft but strong enough to hold a juicy burger. The patty was just the right amount of fat and lean meat that gave it great favors and kept it juicy but not greasy. Beware this is a strong blue cheese. Only get if you are an avid lover of all cheese blue. 

Fries: We choose the fat fries. It was crispy and seasoned well on the outside and very fluffy on the inside. 

Service was great and fast. I would totally recommend this place if you are looking for a quick place to grab a bite and are at the mirage.",IOyvme2n-lPfBT2lyb_Lsg,2,0,4,A20EYjrmTG3GdpFmTi-V0g

However, at 2 in the morning and a little tipsy I can still tell this place is not very good. The skinny fries are worse than Mcdonalds but twice as expensive. Their waffle fries are worse than Carl's Jr's criss cut fries by a large margin. They were so stale. The waiter insisted we get dipping sauce... I think he knew it would help with downing the disgusting french fries. 
The burgers aesthetically looked pretty awesome. Too bad thats the only plus. For the price of a cheeseburger at BLT you can get 5 In n Out burgers and it doesn't taste as good. The thing with burgers is that they are everywhere. So you have more reference points. I cook burgers at home and BLT looked like they forgot to add salt and pepper when they were mixing the meat to make the patties. Totally bland, a huge disappointment. If I had to compare the taste of this to a burger you all know, I would say its better than the Mc Donald's double cheeseburger, but worse than a whopper from Burger King. 
The milkshake 'Berry Me' was pretty yummy. big serving with fresh fruit was the only highlight of this sad sad meal.

I walked in and had a seat at the bar.  Two woman behind the bar.  Black lady who was clearly a server but was at the prep area making sodas for her tables.  I was right in front of her.  She can't say hello?  Hi?  How are you?  Let me get you a menu?  Or just let the bartender know that I'm sitting there?  Anything other than that miserable look on your face?  The bartender was actually right next to her but she seemed busy making drinks and can't say hi and pour a beer at the same time.  Eventually she greeted me and brought me a menu.

I know, I made it seem like the service was sh-t.  It wasn't.  It actually got much better after this.

I ordered the tandoori lamb burner medium rare.  It was cooked medium well.  It was just dripping in fat and grease as I was eating it.  It tasted fine though I didn't feel like I tasted much tandoori. They did do the right thing and offered to make me another one, but I only send food back if food is inedible.

I ordered the trio of sliders, and asked for them to be cooked medium. The sliders included a bleu cheese burger, a bbq onion burger and a BLT burger. They all sounded AMAZING. I was starving and looking SO forward to them. My other friends also ordered burgers. 

The meal came and they looked phenomenal, but I quickly realized that my burgers were beyond well done - NOT medium like I asked for. If all you cook is burgers, you'd think you'd get the difference between juicy and pink in the middle and completely charred beyond taste. What a disappointment!

We ate a late lunch here during our stay. When we arrived, we waited maybe 5-10 minutes for a table. If there is a line, don't fret, because tables turn over quickly. My friend had a #1 combo (burger, waffle fries, and a soda for $18). The combos are a better value, but lately, I have been trying to only order enough to satiate my hunger, so I only ordered a lamb tandoori burger with fries. I thought my burger was outstanding--a perfect combination of ground lamb with Indian-inspired as well as traditional toppings. The fries were a miss--I've certainly had better and preferred my friend's waffle fries. I would probably forgo fries and order a milkshake or dessert on my next visit. Just one burger was enough for me and even thought I was tempted by the milkshakes and desserts, I was simply too stuffed to order anything else.

As far as price goes, I felt it was the price point was fair. We have gourmet burger bars in DC where just a burger would set you back $12-18. This is on par with the competition. And did I mention I still think about this burger every time I log into Yelp and see my saved review from eons ago?

Bacon makes everything better ;o)

2256144,2010-09-17,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"Hands-down, this is one of my favorite places to eat in Vegas. I went with my girlfriend. We shared an order of fries, she had the classic with American cheese, I had the ""BLT"" with Oregon cheddar, and we shared a strawberry milkshake. 

The shake was, by far, the best milkshake I have ever had. We got Strawberry because it is my girlfriend's favorite, but they have many more interesting flavors, like Twinkie Boy (made with twinkies), Campfire Marshmallows (made with toasted marshmallows), the Lunchbox (made with peanut butter and jelly), or the Nut Jub (made with hazelnut ice cream and Nutella). Being in Las Vegas, they even have a section on their menu devoted specifically to Spiked Milkshakes! Both of the burgers were a good size, big enough that I wasn't annoyed at the size, but small enough that I wasn'y amazed by it. My girlfriend's burger was very good, but not special because she didn't add anything to it. The ""BLT"", on the other hand, was amazing. The double-smoked bacon was crisp, but not at all burnt or overdone, and the ""double-smoked"" flavor was fantastic. Also, there was something special about the Oregon cheddar and I enjoyed its flavor much more than other cheddars. I didn't notice until after I ordered, but they offer fried eggs as an optional topping. That really made this place for me, because fried eggs are awesome on burgers (if you haven't tried one on a burger, you are seriously missing out). I can't decide if I want to try the ""BLT"" again, with chili, a fried egg, and Oregon cheddar, or if I want to try the Buffalo Chicken burger next time. Either way, I'm positive I won't be disappointed. To top it off, though, the fries were delicious. They were cooked to a slight crunch, but not over done, and the inside was light and fluffy. Also, they didn't obliterate the fries with salt before bringing them out, allowing you to add the amount of salt you like, which was great for me because I hate salt on my fries.

The service here was good. We didn't have to wait very long for lunch and our server was friendly. She was very good at knowing what time to check on us and took good care of us. I especially liked that she didn't get annoyed when we needed a few extra minutes to decide what we wanted (like at the Carnegie Deli down the hall) and just came back in a few minutes, instead of checking every 30 seconds for the first 2 minutes and then ditching us for 20 minutes (which is what happened at Carnegie)

To all the complainers about the high price, THIS IS VEGAS. Yes, the price is high, but don't pretend like you didn't see it coming. EVERYTHING on the Strip is expensive. For the Strip, I found this place reasonable, especially for the quality and size of the food, along with the service. If you don't like the prices, you picked the wrong place for your vacation and you should just go home so the rest of us don't have to wait.

Anyways, I'll definitely be back here next time I am on the Strip. Can't wait to try those shakes!",df_wr-hXaxeb1b_KCAX3BA,0,1,5,EeiNK6Q5RU-YYYlEhCXIvQ

Great selection of beers on tap, I was happy to see both Shiner Bock & Abita Turbodog.

My wife had the classic, I went with a tex-mex burger which was great, but loaded up with chili, sour cream & avocados, did make it a little messy.  We split the waffle bites, I expected a basket of waffle fries covered with cheese & jalapenos, but instead we got a dish of maybe six or eight well done up large waffle fries.

The only downside is that it's pricey. The burgers are standard burgers, and then you wind up paying $20 for a drink, fries, and a burger. I guess that's what happens when you put a burger place in the Mirage, but still.

The burgers are just ok.  Here is a little tip to the cook: try salting the meat.  It works wonders.  Special tip:  feel free to use the shaker with the word ""salt"" on it.  I know burgers are not your specialty here so you get a free pass on this one.  Oh wait, the joint is called ""BLT Burger?""  Good grief.  

The ""adult"" milkshakes were also boring.  If I cannot tell if there is any booze in the drink, then really, I have seriously paid way too much for a nice milkshake that costs at least twice what I should have paid.

I am also not impressed with the location.  Maybe it is just me, but I like my restaurant to feel just a little bit independent and closed-off from the hotel it is located in.

Sat at the bar & had a good chat with the bartender.  He was super insightful about the Las Vegas housing market.  I didn't take advantage of the post 11pm happy hour menu, as paying $5 for a single slider or what sounded to be way too gluttonous a cheese/bacon/french fry order (and this is me talking) didn't do it for me.

Classic Burger: Very tasty. The bun is done well, the cheese is delicious, and you get a good chunk of beef. It was incredibly under-seasoned in my opinion, but some might enjoy that, as it enables the flavor of the meat to push through to your palate. Clearly fresh meat, and cooked to perfection (my medium was a true medium [pink and tender on the inside], not a medium-well, as so many places mistakenly make them into).

Sweet Potato Fries: By far -- by FAR -- the best I've ever had. Good texture (not crunchy, not mushy) and extraordinary seasoning. I'd come back just for these.

DRINK: 5/5
Nut Job Milkshake: Delicious! It really tasted just like Nutella and almonds. There were even almond shavings on top. The texture was terrific, and the whipped cream was the best I've ever tasted -- truly home-made.


SERVICE: 1/5
The Good: Not the worst I've had, as our server wasn't out-and-out rude and did bring us the correct orders.

The Bad: She was incredibly slow and inattentive; I'm not sure I've ever seen someone more bored with their job. When we'd try to catch her eye at various points, we'd find her behind the bar, chatting with other employees and getting giggly back rubs from the bartender. It took her nearly twenty-five minutes to glance over at us and bring us our bill once we'd finished our meals.


ATMOSPHERE: 5/5
Space: Nice, open little area. Tables and booths are spacious. You can watch passers-by as you dine.

Decor: Very well decorated. Red and gold might sound like a recipe for a gaudy disaster, but BLT's actually managed to make it work quite well.

Cleanliness: Didn't find anything wrong with the dishware, silverware, floor, or tables/seats. Absolutely clean.


PRICES: 4/5
There's a lot of complaining on here about prices, but come on, people -- it's BLT Burger! The name alone carries some prestige. Sometimes, food is simply worth an extra few bucks, and if you're scared of higher prices, it's your responsibility to judge whether a restaurant's bypassed your comfort level by looking at a menu BEFORE you take a seat. If you want a super cheap burger, there's a McDonald's right across the street.

That said, for the quality, I think the prices are maybe a dollar too high, or two dollars at most. It's not the best burger I've ever had, and $5 for a side of fries is a bit much, even considering how spectacular they are. But all in all, I'd say BLT mostly warrants its prices.",1M-hALVhFgzz9iX_7-RjiA,2,1,4,Kn3YNLkOi2Wu7F0Kw836HQ

We found some seats near the bar area since seating at the tables were scares. Our bartender/server hand us our menus. I was already decided on what to order, but wanted to check out the drinks offered here. I opted out on alcohol this time since we had to be up early the next morning. I order the cream soda, since I've haven't had it in a very long time. It must have been a popular drink since I ordered the last bottle in the restaurant. The soda was clear and crisp. It had a gentle taste of vanilla. For my main course, I went the the kobe slider trio. I wasn't really hungry, but could be satisfied with this small burgers. 

The slider trio came with slider flavors consisting of BLT, BBQ Onion, and Blue Cheese. The kobe patties were tender and juicy in all three sliders. The bacon, lettuce, onions were crispy and crunchy.

Maybe because of the time of day we went, but it wasn't busy at all, so our party of four people got seated right away.

The menu is just the right size, with enough options to keep it interesting, yet not an overwhelming amount to have to study and narrow down to just one choice.

Burgers, sandwiches, apps, sides, shakes, floats, beers, etc.

We ordered a pitcher of Hoegaarden, which came out to about a beer and a half for the four of us. The worst part of our dining experience was our waitress' beer pouring. She began pouring the first glass with one hand. Everyone knows you need BOTH hands to pour beer - you need to tilt the glass and pour it on the side so that the head isn't ridiculously large. She didn't do that, so while she was moving on to pour the second glass, the first one began overflowing and got everywhere. She laughed, apologized lightly, and wiped it up. My friend jokingly said that we should get a free beer for that, but either she didn't hear or didn't care to respond. Either way, beer was wasted and we didn't get compensated for her mistake.

Anyway, moving on to the food...

I decided to get the ahi tuna spring roll but they were out of that (another disappointment), so I ordered the California Chicken on wheat instead of a sesame seed bun. The food came quickly and looked appetizing. The portions are reasonably large, but they should be for the amount you're paying.

Located in the Mirage, not far off the casino, BLT Burger is the perfect casual yet substantial burger bistro that highlights the best the BLT bistro can offer.  The space is casual with some sexy lighting and the service was friendly and attentive.  Luckily I didn't have to wait for a seat and our orders arrived in a short time afterward as I was starving for some good burger.

You really can't go wrong with the flavor and juiciness of the burger meat as it consists of a blend of beef cuts (some lean, some fatty) ground together.  Signature burger options are unique as well as the option of building your own burger.  The burger I had was perfectly cooked and seasoned and accompanied with lettuce, tomato, onions.  If you're like me and don't like cucumbers, don't eat the ""pickle.""  It's only slightly pickled tasting and tasted more like a cucumber.  Nothing to dock these people off for - just a personal preference.  

What I really liked about the menu is the option to get a combo.  A classic burger, classic milkshake and fries for $20 is a bargain and worth the price tag to try the best elements.  For a surcharge I got the Mocha Mudslide, and it was absolutely amazing.  What would make the milkshake more perfect was if I got the Night Rider, but I'd only go that way if you're able to/willing to have it alcoholic.  The waffle fries were delicious and a perfect complement to the burger and shake, though I'm still on the fence on how they compare to Chik-fil-A waffle fries.

Every time I passed the restaurant, the memory of that burger compelled me to visit BLT once again.  This time I added the sweet potato fries and they were excellent as well.

Kobe Sliders - My boyfriend got this and there were three small sliders, all different flavors. I liked each one equally. Good flavor! He got a side of curly fries as well and those were nicely seasoned.

The shake was really good, we had the oreo cookie shake and it was plenty to share. The fried dill pickles also hit the spot and the breading was really tasty. Our burgers came out and unfortunately the bacon was wayyyy to well done and that turned us off a bit. Other than that, they were tasty. I didn't like that there was no lettuce, tomato, onion served alongside the burger. That should always be available in my opinion in case you want to add some of that fresh crisp to your fried goodness.

I don't eat burgers but I saw some salads and veggie burger-type items on the menu so I gave it a try.  I opted for the falafel burger.  First of all, it was huge.  The falafel patty was really big and it had a good flavor - just a bit spicy.  It came with lettuce, tomatoes, a creamy sauce and tons of avocado.  I definitely could not eat it all but I would order it again.  It also came with a nice pickle.

Speaking of pickles, I did try a few of the fried pickles.  Personally, I would never order these on my own because I take a firm stance against the gratuitous frying of things that don't even need to be cooked, like pickles and candy bars.  However, I sampled a few from my friend's plate and they were tasty.  But still, this whole concept seems silly to me, and it made me sad to see the little pickle slice with all this blown up batter around it.  So, they did taste good yet I hate them on principle and I think it's mean to do this to pickle slices.

Sweet potatoes do need to be cooked so I did order the sweet potato fries.  They were good, although not the best I've had, and I was a little disappointed that they came with ketchup only and not a special sauce.  But, of all the fried sides to choose from, I might order these again (or onion rings because they had those, too).

The service here was good and I like that you can watch people walking in and out of the casino here.  I found the atmosphere to be pretty much in line with the whole rest of the Mirage and I enjoyed the background music.  Additionally, in the past I have ordered spiked milkshakes to go from here and they were darn tasty.  But, they're filling - I can easily forego a meal and just have the milkshake.

I had to ask for cup of BBQ sauce because it was bone dry (asked for medium). Others in my party had the Mexican burger and just a plain hamburger and both claimed that they were nothing special. Burgers don't come with fries, you have to pay extra which is unheard of these days. Combo options are not a good idea as you are limited to three very boring burgers.

Our waitress was attentive and checked on us multiple times during the meal. Overall this place wasn't cooked up to be the great burger place it makes itself out to be.

2716416,2010-04-08,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"The first night in Vegas I refused to go here, not wanting to spend over $10 on a burger. Fancy as they were, proudly claiming the 100% Certified Black Angus beef (or CAB, as the menu referred to them) at the center of many sandwiches, I wanted something different than a burger. I mean, I was in Vegas and, really, how special can one make a burger?

I gave this place a shot on the next night when we had just an hour before a show in the Mirage. We had to wait in line, but it moved quickly. While waiting, I saw amazing-looking milkshakes served from the side bar. We could see people dining, but when the roles were reversed and I sat, I didn't feel impatient eyes watching me eat. The decor of the place is actually interesting and modern. I really liked the exposed grill and kitchen area set in the back of the restaurant. You could see the chefs and wait staff interacting, hard at work. It felt open with no unnecessary divide.  

Not realizing it, I unintentionally often test my waiter or waitress at restaurants when I order water with lemon as my beverage. I'm not trying to be picky but a lot of wait staff forget the lemon. The waiter at BLT Burger brought me a small plate of them promptly. We told him that we had a show to catch and he understood. He and all the wait staff moved so quickly yet with precision. I felt like I was with pros. 

Okay, so was the over $10 burger worth it? I actually ended up ordering the BBQ brisket. I enjoyed it but found it a bit dry and just a bit more sauce would have solved that problem. My mom really enjoyed her Salmon burger, which was fresh and tasty. The others split a ""BLT"" burger (someone had to get it) and I must admit that the bite I had was filled with bacon and burger goodness. The carnivore in me sometimes enjoys that. We also shared waffle fries and started with the Waffle Bites, which were very much like loaded potato skins. 

Not a healthy meal by any means, but it satisfied us and got us to our show on time. I'd go again, but next time I'm trying a milkshake.",jC_pYRP1M2LmimVd8zZB7w,0,0,4,nEPmfS8b-h5pEvrgo9bJ_A

When it comes to a good quality burger, you just don't want to be let down. BLT offers quality ingredients, a good variety of burger options, taters and of course, what american meal would be complete without a milkshake?!?

This isn't my first visit to BLT and each time I come, I try something different. But all in all, the Shaft's Blue has been my favorite. With carmelized onions and chunks of bleu cheese, this is nothing short of delightful. 

As for the milkshakes, since you ARE in Vegas, you might as well go for a spiked milkshake. The All Nighter is delicious.

2718767,2009-03-01,2,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"I didn't want to eat a burger at all when I came here but many months before, as I was leaving the Mirage I glanced at BLT's menu before walking out. I saw something that sounded unbelievably delicious: Krispy Kreme Donut Bread Pudding... WOW there is such a thing!? I LOOOVE Krispy Kreme donuts and I love love bread pudding. Unfortunately I wasn't hungry that day so I wasn't able to try it out until last week. 

I always feel weird ordering just one thing when I go out so my bf and I split a Combo #2 that included:

Classic Burger - $1 more for cheese. Some of the yelp pictures (including mine) make the burgers look way bigger than they are. They're just a bit bigger than In-N-Out burgers but those are only like $3! Ugh...at least it was tasty. 

Fries - We chose to get the sweet potato fries and these were damn good. So crispy, sweet, and satisfying! Why would anyone ever get regular fries? Oh and don't ruin it with ketchup. Just enjoy...

Milkshake - Another extra charge ($1) for an upgrade to a special milkshake. We got the Nut Job, made with hazelnut ice cream, nutella and topped with slivered almonds. I really liked this. The nutty flavors were great with the ice cream. The milkshake wasn't super thick which I liked because you can't drink it otherwise. I wasn't a fan of the whip cream though. It just tasted like air! No hints of sweetness or even creaminess. Normally this thing costs $7. It was good but it wasn't THAT good. That's just pushing on crazy.

Finally after the good but too pricey split meal we ordered the dessert. Officially on the menu it's called ""krispy kreme"" Doughnut Bread Pudding' so I'm wondering if they actually use the real thing. No matter because it tasted perfect! It was everything I imagined it would be. It came out hot and bubbling. The cool rum raisin ice cream was great with the hot pudding. I've had the hot/cold combo hundreds of times but it never gets old. I could still taste the icing on the donuts even though they were mashed up. So delicious! It was $6 and I would order this over and over again. Now I can't ever come to Vegas and leave without one of these in my tummy. I've been thinking about it ever since I left!",WWP06D5BncW30kSOkOC6WA,3,2,4,P-52_qENRAuCdlarFUoW6w

The Service:  Friendly staff, waitress was attentive and nice and made sure we liked what we ordered.

The Shakes:  WOW!  I had a Berry Shake that was just so pretty I didn't want to mess it up by drinking it but I did anyway.  I'm not the biggest fan of shakes but that one had me sucking it down in one fell swoop.  My husband ordered a mocha type shake that even had chocolate whipped cream.  Chocolate?  Whipped cream?  Who doesn't love that?

The Burger:  Ordered just a plain ole regular burger w/cheese and fries and waffle fries with potato skin type toppings.  The burger was just mouth wateringly out of this world.  It was juicy, cooked perfectly, flavorful without all the seasoning salt and paired perfectly with a toasted sesame bun.  WOW.  I don't think I've ever had a burger this good.  The waffle fries were interesting.  Nicely fried with cheese, bacon, sour cream and a jalepeno on each fry.  

Bottom Line:  For $20, you get a burger, fries and milkshake.  By Vegas hotel standards, that's positively cheap!  They also have spiked shakes that sounded delicious.  Will def go back again.",Liavg01xIuUtIFBRaxIsaA,4,3,4,N9QujAt5F1ctanJJkFaKPA

Asian Banh Mi burger - it's a pork and shrimp burger. I was expecting a pork patty w/ shrimp on top, but instead they put pieces of shrimp in the ground pork to form the patty. With the cucumbers and sriracha mayo it's a tasty burger.

Shaft's Blue burger - the blue cheese is in the beef patty. Very tender and juicy. The caramelized onions and mushrooms on top were great.

Onion rings - large slices of onions that are fried perfectly. These onion rings are definitely better than the ones at Burger Bar.

Kid's grilled cheese - it's a standard grilled cheese sandwich. My kid wasn't feeling it but loved his fries.

Chocolate milkshake - delicious, but overpriced for $8. I should have picked up 3 shakes from In-N-Out on the way home instead.

Dinner:
The burgers were fantastic. The fries were also really good. It was on the pricier side. The burgers are $13-21 and then it's another $7-10+ if you want a drink and fries. I'm used to burgers coming with fires, so that was a little weird. Service was prompt and good. My husband had the Wagyu burger and was pleased as punch. I had the BLT burger and my only regret was having it cooked over the standard medium. It dried it out just a little - having it done medium would have made it more amazing. The bacon though. Oh my god, the bacon. It was the most perfectly cooked bacon I've ever had. Crisp without being overdone and still chewy without being hard to bite through. I could sing songs about that bacon. My sister had the chicken avocado burger (not sure of the name) and she says she enjoyed it.

Dessert:
We were desperate for dessert. We wanted nothing else but dessert - it was a quest. We came back here on our last night for the deep-fried oreos. We were feeling snacky so we started with the nachos. They were pretty good. Get the chipotle sauce on the side, that stuff is like liquid fire. The deep-fried oreos come with 5 and a little container of cream and one of chocolate sauce.

BLT Burger is just past the casino near Carnagie Deli, RhumBar, and California Pizza Kitchen. My husband and I have ate at BLT Steak in Scottsdale, Arizona, so we thought it would be fun to check out another of the BLT concepts, so BLT Burger it was!

The interior is two levels and has a slightly upscale diner feel to it. Service was mediocre - our server was nice but not that attentive which was annoying as the restaurant was maybe only half full at 7 pm on a Friday evening.

Our group of four tried:
*The All-Nighter, Malibu Barbie, and Night Rider spiked milkshakes - they were all delicious, but I think the favorite was the Malibu Barbie. The Night Rider was my second favorite, but the whipped cream was a bit too thick.
*Buffalo Chicken sandwich - my husband is very picky about buffalo chicken sandwiches and while he liked it, he was not wowed
*Caesar salad - I don't eat beef, so I opted for a salad as my meal. The salad was large and I enjoyed the large crouton that came on it, but it was not the best salad I have ever had. It needed a bit more dressing to give it more flavor.
*BLT Burger - our friends really enjoyed this burger. While it was simple, it hit the spot.
*Asian Bahn Mi burger - one of our friends ordered it as it was not a traditional beef burger and while he liked it, it seemed that he liked his wife's BLT Burger more.
*Onion rings - cooked perfectly and I liked how the breading was not too heavy.

The burgers do not come with a side, so if you want fries or onion rings, you need to make sure to order them as a side. Our bill came to about $65 per couple (includes tax and tip), so it's a tad pricey for a burger and milkshake joint.

BLT Burger is a nice place to get that fix.

I have been here twice. Both times, I ordered the Classic Burger. $18 for the meal: Classic burger, fries, and a soda.  And there's one for $23 that has a beer instead of a soda.

The burger is pretty thick, and it can fill you up pretty fast.  It does the job, but it's still not the best thing ever.  It is a really good burger, though.

My friend was catching a cold and asked for hot tea - they didn't have tea - so they offered her hot water- mmmm now doesn't that sound tasty - she took it anyway...  Usually the foods you crave when intoxicated are not the healthiest - so what did we end up ordering: spicy chicken wings, fried dill pickles, jalapeno poppers, sweet potato fries, a strawberry milkshake, and onion rings.  I was surprised how good the fried pickles were - i am not a huge fan of pickles nor of fried food but this was particularly yummy.  Also the jalapeno poppers were one of the better one that i have tried.  They use the whole jalapeno and they don't load it with cream cheese.  The food was filling!

As for food, we shared the money business shake which was banana flavored with Reese's peanut butter cup pieces. It wasn't as sweet as I thought it would be and had a homey taste to it. It tasted of fresh banana, none of that artificial stuff. I got the American Wagyu Burger which had truffle aioli, brie, spinach, portabello  mushrooms and of course wagyu beef! It was delicious! It reminded me of the funghi burger at Holsteins except for in this burger, you could taste much more of the meat and the truffle flavor wasn't as extreme (which doesn't bother me but anyways). I would definitely eat that again! My boyfriend got the I-80 Burger which had peppercorn crusted bacon, bbq sauce, sharp cheddar, and caramelized onions. Delicious also! You could really tasted the peppercorn which made it a little different from the typical bbq bacon cheeseburgers. Both were good portions, about the size of Gordon Ramsey's burGR, and the meat had more distinct flavor in it compared to Holstein's and burGR.  The only thing about our food that I didn't care for were the two orders of fries we got. I got regular curly fries and they seemed a little stale, like they were cooked in advance and were just sitting for an hour or two under the heat lamps. Pass on those. Next, my boyfriend got buffalo fries which are fries drenched in buffalo sauce topped with feta and green onions. It's a good concept just not executed great. The fries were super soggy! It would have been a little better if the sauce was just drizzled on.
Our service was nothing special, she was friendly enough, and checked on us twice to make sure our water was filled and didn't take forever to bring out the check so it was still good even though she was really quiet.
Overall the food was delicious, but I still think I would choose BurGR and Holstein's over this place mainly because I liked the shakes and fries much better in those other two locations.

Great place to go to to forget that you're in a one of the weaker 'themed' hotels.  You'll never actually catch me at the Mirage unless my boys and I are playing 'Briar Patch, Barely There, or Bald'.  (And in that case, we're the degenerate Asians with cocktails just past the bridge laughing it up as we watch the hoochie patrol come marching in at 10PM to go to Jet.)  

Otherwise there's very little reason to go to the Mirage***.  

But I will go to the Mirage to eat at BLT Burger usually every 2nd or 3rd trip or to Vegas.  It always ends up being very much worth the lunch visit - especially when you've just tanked a quarter of your bankroll across the street during an erratic, up & down losing session, and you need a friggin' breather.  I mean, dammit - you just need some ""consistency"" in your life & BLT provides that ""CONSISTENTLY good burger"" to fill that ridiculous void left in your soul after that bitch of a dealer pulled a gotforesaken '5' after showing the '6' of a Dealer 16.  And just your luck you doubled down a high bet to a '20' .  Man, he might as well have ripped your heart out & showed it to you in the palm of his hand... like that dude in the Temple of Doom.   I... I...just... gahhhhhhhhhhhSONNAFAWHORE!

[BRB.  Kurt's stepped away to go punch a hole in the wall.]

Anyway, whenever I get the crap kicked out of me by a dealer named ""Romeo"" and 6-deck shoe I've nicknamed ""Satan"", I like to sit down at a table and peruse the menu at BLT:  http://www.mirage.com/files/BLT_menu.pdf.  Not that it frickin' matters.  I know what I want.  I want the only combo that will help me forget the dearth of $100's in my right pocket:

1) FRIED DILL PICKLES
Okay, so this is the immediate gratification portion of my meal.  They're small.  They're tasty.  And they're salty but substantial and can get your stomach feeling adequate in very little time.  They look more like ""overly battered tempura pickles slices"" but who cares.  You didn't come here to judge how the food looks.  You came here to eat.  Stop objectifying your food.  You gotdamned pig.

2) NIGHT RIDER MILKSHAKE
""Hey Kurt?  Do you want liquor in your milkshake?  HELL YEAH, I WANT LIQUOR IN MY MILKSHAKE, M@#$%F#$%$#R.""  That's right.  Spiked with a noticeable amount of Kahlua & Chocolate Liqueur, this milkshake promises to slide the meal down and then make you forget you ate it.  It's a definite dessert, but who gives a damn.  Now man up and chug it down.  CHUGCHUGCHUGCHUGCHUG.

3) SHAFT'S BLUE BURGER
All you dumbasses keep ordering plain, not so special, Kobe Beef based burgers instead of ordering something distinctive... the hallmark of the restaurant.  How about Shaft's Blue?  This delectable morsel of melted blue cheese over a cheeseburger will more than likely delight your mouth with the contrasting tastes of the pungent cheese and the soft juicy beef.

Fried Pickles 4/5
Night Rider Milkshake 4/5
Shaft's Blue 4/5

JUST DOWN THE STREET
Now remember:  BLT is central to a lot of hotels... being within walking distance to Caesar's, TI, Venetian, Palazzo, Wynn, and Encore.  So you can get thrown over a barrel at the casinos in any one of these places and still drown your sorrows @ BLT without hailing a cab.  Heck.  You may want to walk even if you AREN'T within walking distance of BLT.  Yeah.  Walk there from frickin' Mandalay Bay and you think long & hard about what you've done.  Maybe next time you won't gamble away your kid's college fund, you degenerate pig.

CONCLUSION
As burgers & shakes go in Las Vegas, this is definitely one of the best.  Bradley Ogden's $29 burger's better but BLT can give 'em a run for his money and you can't get an alcoholic milkshake at Bradley Ogden's.

4-stars.

The meat was tender and cooked to perfection, and the three different tastes were amazing, as well, each in its own way.  The flavor more than made up for the size.  The BLT burger was good, though I can't really say it was all the wonderful.  I'd definitely eat it again, but I'd probably rather try something new from their menu.

The first time we came, I had the classic cheeseburger, and my friend had the BLT burger.  Both of them were amazing.  The meat was so tender and juicy, and you could really tell it was high quality beef.  She had onion rings that were awesome, but the real star of the meal was my waffle fries.  They were so crispy, and they held onto the ketchup nicely, which is very important to me :)  Also, they had a delicious crunch when you bit into them, but the insides were really fluffy.  Soooo delicious!!  On this particular trip, our waiter was awesome and attentive and had great suggestions.

The second trip we made was at about 10pm because we were craving something sweet for dessert.  Our waiter was NOT GOOD.  He was surly, sullen, didn't introduce himself (I still don't know his name) and was clearly not happy to be there.  He seemed put off if we asked for things like spoons for our ice cream.

Food took about 15 minutes.  We got the BLT burgers.  Nice sized burgers.  Although we ordered them medium they came medium rare.  Not a big deal to us but some people may be displeased.  Order medium well if you want a medium.  Adding fries and a Coke adds $7 (!!!) to your $14-20 burger.  Rip off for sure..  But that's Vegas.

Food: I ordered the caesar salad but it came with these weird croutons that had gunk all over them. I'm sure it was edible but it just looked incredibly gross. Other than that the salad was a salad and satisfied my cravings for vegetables after an entire weekend of being starved from them. 

Appetizers: BAD. We ordered nachos, fried pickles and buffalo wings. The spicy buffalo wings were by far the worse. They were not so much spicy but just incredibly tangy. Trying to finish my one wing was like torture because everytime I tasted the sauce, my face would have no control but to make a face from having eaten something very tangy/sour. Fried Pickles were probably how they were supposed to be but just not my cup of tea. To describe them for you readers though, it was warm and kind of mushy. I prefer my pickles crunchy and cold, and I think that's how most people do too.

Having walked past BLT Burger over the years on my many trips to Vegas, I finally decided it was time to try it. Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay, with its numerous customization options (buns, toppings, etc.) and quality meat patties, has always won be over. I was nervous about BLT Burger. Could it live up to the hype? Short answer- Pretty damn close.

The wait to get in was short which already edged out Burger Bar.
Our waiter was prompt and let me order the Cowboy Burger (BBQ chiptole sauce, tobasco onion strings, lettuce, tomato, bacon and pepper jack cheese) with customizations. I swapped in a turkey patty and avocado instead of bacon at no extra charge which was nice. 
The onion rings were great, with flavorful batter and vidalia onions (and I'm an onion ring snob!).
They also had a variety of craft beers and tempting milkshakes.

Overall, I was pretty happy with my meal at BLT Burger. The flavors hit the spot and there was quality in the ingredients used. That being said, the antibiotic & hormone free beef, free range turkey and vast amounts of customizable toppings slightly edge out Burger Bar as a superior restaurant for me.

What an asshole.

Because everything that they said about this place, ""rude service"", ""undercooked or low quality food"", ""burnt fries"", are a whole load of bullshit. 

This place is GREAT. I have been here about 6 times so far, tonight being my 7th and I love their service and the items on their menu.

Take for example, the ""Twinkie Boy Shake"". Somehow, and I don't know how, they managed to blend the white part of the twinkles with a vanilla ice cream milkshake, and then OVERSTUFFED the cup with whipped cream and left a half of a twinkie sitting on the top. It tastes and looks so delicious that it reminds me of the Hash House Agogo's cappuccinos, drizzled with mocha sauce and melted marshmallows. It is so overloaded with twinkie creamy awesomeness, that bits of the cream starts dripping over the side of the glass if you don't drink it fast enough. 

And you can use it to cover up the ""blue cheese breath"" if you order one of their nommy burgers. Tastes good, and makes your breath smell sugary and sweet for your date. 

The waitresses and waiters in every one of our visits are talkative and friendly. They know what they are working and busting their ass for, our tips. So maybe it isn't their ""rude service"", its that you are a narcissistic douche that wants to find flaws in everything. 

I hate butthurt reviewers. 

The only gripe I have against this place is that the bill adds up pretty fast. Burgers are about $10-15 bucks, but if you order a coke, beer, or shake that bill goes up to $22 a person. Don't forget, those ""Spiked Shakes"" with alcohol inside run for about $12 a piece.",USpN4MpgR9RpwT7eKUA3aw,2,1,4,ySd68Sd27Y1TNlxnkYHEqw

I ordered the BLT burger which came with double smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and special BLT Burger sauce.  The burger itself priced out at $14; I chose to make it a combo for an additional $7, which added fries and a soft drink.  They offer waffle fries, sweet potato fries, skinny fries, fat fries, buffalo fries or curly fries.  I went with the waffles.

Our meals were delivered in an acceptable amount of time considering how busy this place is, and that they also filled several ""to go"" orders while we were here.  The burger and fries were both good, not life changing, and I was impressed by the fact that any time either my friend or I drank our sodas down to about 1/3 full, our server was stopping by with a fresh glass of soda for us without being asked.

I tried ""the stripper"" burger, which was a burger with red peppers, onions, avocado, and did not contain a bun ($12).  Want a bun? add 1.50 please.

My friend tried the wagyu burger, which he said he could taste a slight difference in the quality of the meat, but his overall conclusion was that he had just paid $17 for a hamburger.

The waitress that we had took people's orders, asked if they wanted bacon or whatever addons, but be careful, since these add-ons each run about $1.50 (I believe they have fried eggs, bacon, avocado, etc. available) on top of the $12-$17 dollar burger that you're purchasing.

Their milkshakes are pretty good and run about $7 each, and their spiked milkshakes run about $12.

Garlic Fries: $6.50 and although the portions seem a bit small, it is easily enough for two people to split. 

Tried the smore cupcake and was thoroughly underwhelmed. $5 for a cupcake that tasted like it came straight from a package at the grocery store? no thanks.

Some of the waiters were wearing shirts that said ""If we are what we eat then I'm fast, cheap, and easy.""  That cracked me up!",zbahX7xiLbjWWM4_L43lhg,1,1,5,jFR67p3d7gqqvTmBg0fj6w

3248172,2009-11-29,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"The wife and I had been looking forward to trying out BLT Burger at The Mirage for some time and last night we finally gave it a shot.

I ordered Spicy Buffalo Wings and a Tex Mex Burger with a ""Nut Job Milkshake"" and wife had a Vegetarian Falafel Burger with swiss and mushrooms, a side order of fried pickles and the same milkshake.

Things started well with the milkshakes which were simply put, unbelievably delicious. I'm not normally a big fan of milk based drinks, but I could chug one of these down all day long.

Wife really enjoyed her fried pickle appetizer with chipotle ranch dipping sauce and I was encouraged after a bite of my wings. At this point we thought ""WOW! What a great place we have discovered"".

Unfortunately things took a sharp downturn from that point on. By about my third wing (of eight) the taste had become overwhelming and unpleasant. Also, I had deliberately asked for the ""spicy"" wings as opposed to the ""tangy"" ones, so why did they taste so strongly of lemon? Wings were also very mushy without any sort of crispness about the exterior. Eventually I gave up after about four - realising I had been forcing them down for the sake of it.

Burgers arrived and I was surprised to see something that really didn't look like a $13 burger on my plate. The meat was not cooked to my specifications (but it was close, so I was OK), but the whole thing was BLAND - The Chili included in the burger was tasteless and so runny the bottom part of the bun turned into a soggy mess. The ""sour cream"" and ""jalapenos"" supposedly in the burger simply got lost in all the chaos. In the end it was edible, but not something I would ever pay for again.

Wife pronounced her Falafel Burger burnt tasting on the outside with a tasteless interior. She got through perhaps 1/3 of the thing and left the rest on her plate. We were both quite surprised the staff member who took our plates didn't ask her if there had been a problem with her meal.

Only the excellence of the shakes and the fried pickles saves BLT Burger from a 1 star rating from me. It's a really high price for a great milkshake and mediocre food.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,3,0,2,ebY1lj3aIRht-DFW5y7Dcw

We sat at our table for 10-15 minutes before being acknowledeged.  The menu is basically a la carte and completley overpriced even for Vegas standards. If you want a plain burger, fries, and a drink its almost 20 bucks.  The food took forever despite the restaurant only being half full and about 8-10 guys working in the exposed kitchen.  Told our server if she could put a rush in the order that would be great considering we had to catch a show and we had already waited insanely long, she gave me attitude and said everything is made to order so theres nothing she can do, rather than just saying ""ok sir"" to shut me up, which I would have preferred.  She then said she was leaving cause her shift was over and someone else would take care of us (no problem).  He checked on us once, and gave us the bill.  There are a lot better options for a place to eat and I suggest finding one of them (unfortunately mirage really does not have that great of options).",cCP3iDku86d68cUrWyePLg,1,0,1,AqIZE4UwzgelRMsIBlHXGw

There were a lot of different types of milkshakes to choose from, but out of all I decided to try one of their spiked night rider that had Kahlua and chocolate liqueur.

It was extremely heavy, a little too sweet, but could have added a little bit more chocolate. Since it was heavy I ended up not finishing my nachos, but it didn't matter anyways because the nachos weren't so great. 

  BBQ Nachos came with shredded pork. The shredded pork was dry, it was all bundled up below the chips and cheese. As a result it made it hard to scoop it up with tortilla chips, so I ended up using my fork. After using my fork the shredded pork was still tangled, so I used a knife to cut it up. NO it was so difficult to cut it so I ended up using my fingers. The BBQ sauce however was very flavourful, tangy and reallly spicy. 

  Waitress was very nice, she took our orders in the nick of time. However afterwards the service just got slower and just when we received our drinks, the food came.

Our party ordered the following:
- turkey burger & skinny fries (All White Meat Natural Turkey Breast Ground With Fresh Herbs) - $12
- chili bowl - $8
- Buffalo chicken sandwich & fat fries - (Fried Chicken, Red Hot Sauce, Avocado, Chopped Lettuce, Maytag Blue, Buttermilk Dressing) - $12
- vegetable salad & sweet potato fries - $12 + $5
- chicken Caesar salad - $15
- BLT burger & waffle fries (7oz. Grilled Certified Angus Beef, Double Smoked Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, BLT Burger Sauce) - $13 (add cheese for $1)

It was AWESOME! No one had any complaints.

We tried every fry variety at our table of five - sweet potato, waffle, skinny and fat. I really liked the fries in particular (sweet potato and waffle)... waffle fries are just not something you see in Canada very much. Yum! And I've rarely met a yam frite I didn't agree with!

We decided on this place, my treat seeing they had Vegas/LA prices and my cousin was suffering sticker shock.

We asked for a booth which they accommodated us with after a wee wait even though there were plenty of booths available but I guess it's all about spreading resources.

We dilly dallied about ordering, thinking we would get one of the combo of burger, fries and drink.  $19 for soda and $21 for milkshake, then realized that these combo's were only options for three of the burgers - classic, veggie and turkey. LAME!

We decided on the BLT ($13) and the Cowboy Burger ($13) to split. We ordered them well done as we both don't like raw mystery mince, though we both order steak medium. The BLT was fresh and the Cowboy had some kick. We added a side of fried pickles ($6) - amazing but not as good as Tinhorn Flats in Burbank - and onion rings ($5). The fries looked good too. 

There was plenty of food and we were stuffed when we left but it was nothing special or amazing.  Staff filled up our waters regularly - we were so dehydrated - and as we had arrived in an off peak time, we stayed there a while.

Only annoying thing, toilets are located in the casino. Is it just me, but the last time I was here (a while back in 2002) I don't remember every square foot of any casino smelling like an ashtray?

3442624,2009-10-12,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"BLT Burger is the latest eatery addition to the Mirage.  Since this place had so much hype, I was expecting quite a good burger.

I wanted to try one of their best items and  ordered their American Kobe Beef Burger.   Even though I had requested medium-rare, they served it to me well-done.  Huge mistake,  you never want to cook any marbled meats well-done since all the juices will go up in smoke.  Since the only way I could tell it was well-done was by biting into it, my first taste of their burger was terrible.  It actually tasted like I was eating a charcoal brickette.

Even though they offered me to re-fire up a new burger, the damage was already done.  First impressions are everything and this place truly missed the target.  Even their fries were lackluster.

I had high expectations for this place, but they let me down big time.  I really don't know if I am willing to try this place again.

They had a combo special -- fries, burger, soft drink for $17.

If I'm going to spend $20 on a meal, that burger better have some foie gras or some truffle on it.

I left. I never ate the burger or fries. Maybe it is good.

It started out with them making us a wait a short bit - when the restaurant was half empty. Not sure why they did this. We're seated in a nice booth - we ordered an alcoholic milkshake that we said we wanted to split. They were very accommodating and provided us with 2 separate cups. I liked that they did this, because it never happened on previous visits. We ordered dinner - we each ordered a burger and we split fries. The fries came out cold. It was next to impossible to find our waiter to ask for fresh fries - by the time we found him, we were half done with our burgers. He didn't apologize - fresh fries came right out. As for our burgers - that was the biggest disappointment. There is nothing I like better than a juicy, medium rare cheeseburger. That is exactly how I ordered it - and I received the opposite of that. It was the driest burger I've ever had. It had no flavor. It was completely overcooked. And to make it worse - there was inedible gristle in my burger and my gf's. We were chewing and couldn't chew it and had to pull it out of our mouth. Disgusting. It might say that they grind their own meat in house - which is great. However, they need to work on their quality control because no one likes to eat that. I'm not even sure if it was bone...or gristle...it was inedible.
As I said before, we've been here many times and had great experiences. However, it's a burger place - I should be able to depend on a quality meal every time I go. And for the number of burger places that now exist on the strip - there's no excuse for this. I will take my business elsewhere because I will sacrifice the convenience.

It was pretty busy but the wait wasn't too long considering the restaurant was packed. I ordered the tandoori lamb burger and sweet potatoe fries. It was sooo good.

The Hispanic hostess with her hair tied back in a ponytail was pretty rude when I requested to move to another table because it was cold where we were sitting. She could tone down the attitude, it's not like I was asking for something so difficult. The waiter was okay, but not very talkative and just took our order without seeming very hospitable. 

I ordered the route 80 burger and it was basically just a step better than a bbq burger you can get for much cheaper at Carl's junior. $16 for a burger with burnt, super salty bacon with a dry party is definitely not worth it. I ordered my burger medium well and it was not cooked that way. I would have requested a new burger, but judging by the attitude of some workers, I'd rather not risk then doing something weird to my food. The skinny fries are basically just regular fries that have been reheated. Do yourself a favor and save your $5 or order the onion rings instead. On the bright side, if you manage to finish the whole burger, you should be full for a while.

Sweet potato fries (mine were not hot though which kinda ruined it)

Note: Cheese is extra if your burger doesn't explicitly say it has cheese -1 dollar. All other toppings are a 1.50 which isn't too bad

BLT is located in the mirage. They have a decent selection of draft beers, which is always a plus. The burgers are pretty expensive (12-17) but it's Vegas. Also there are combos like a burger, fries, and beer for 23 which is a decent deal. I went with a bunch of friends and we tried a couple of burgers. They had many unique choices in the menu but I tried the American wagyu burger, and I also traded for a bite of my Friends lamb tandoori burger. I also mooched off a bunch of my friends food to try everything else to help my fellow yelpers out :)

I should point out here that the Service was AWESOME. Always had a full cup and our server made awesome recommendations and was super friendly

*The mudslide milkshake was super good. Very chocolatey with a great aftertaste. 

*I sampled the skinny fries. They were light and crispy with a potato chip taste. The sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well. They came out luke warm though, which probably made them my second favorite after the waffle fries. The waffle fries were definitely the best out of the three flavor wise

The wagyu burger was certainly tasty. And by tasty i mean NOM.  It was full of flavor and the Swiss cheese I added complimented it well. The bun was lacking and very typical, otherwise it would have been a perfect burger. Definitely get it medium rare to get the full flavor profile. 

*The tandoori burger was good and was interesting but i liked the wagyu better. The brisket burger was very tasty but it also had the most sauces and components so overall mine was the best judging just the meat

This place falls into this final example - a stylin' burger joint with kobe, turkey, lamb, veggie, beef and salmon burgers flooding their menu.  At about a 15 buck average, these burgers are big, tasty, but lonely - a fiver more gets you a small side of fries or rings - and a decent tap selection, highlighted by a restaurant-named pils from hawai'I, gives good options to wash down the meal for a few bills more.  Shakes seemed big but too desserty (I like mine to be an alternate for the 'wash down' option, not be spoonable, topped with whipped)

Decor is cool, service efficient.  Overall a great meal.

Did the Kobe burger ruin my palate for the next regular beef patty in my near future though?

Not this one, no.  Damn tasty, and worthy of joining some angus on a top 10 list - but not requiring its own superior list.

I guess my real issues are that I can't drink beer and they were out of several of the wines they offered on their menu (and they only had like four red varietals and four white varietals).

I had a salmon burger and my boyfriend had the burger with mushrooms, etc. (can't remember what its called), which he had been warned to get medium-cooked because when he said med-rare, the server warned that med-rare was pretty rare. He thought that medium was too well-done for his taste. My salmon burger was fine. But nothing to write home about. 

I know that Vegas inflates prices, but I still found this place a bit over-priced for the diner theme. Other gourmet burger places in different casinos offer more for less. 

The sweet potato fries and onion rings we ordered extra (at ridiculous mark-up, to be sure!) were good, but again, the quantity was minuscule for the money we paid.

After first impressions, it was a little bit pricy (even for a gourmet burger), but the menu looked real interesting.

Food:
Burgers were great -- the meat was definitely the highlight, and very tasty. They made my medium rare burger perfectly and also hit the mark with my gf's medium. She wasn't as much of a fan of the seasoning as I was, but overall the meat was fresh and tasty and really made the burger.

The sweet potato fries were absolutely amazing -- best sweet potato fries we've ever had.  The criss-cut fries were decent -- they supposedly had a special seasoning, but I couldn't tell. I was a little bit disappointed that the fries came out luke-warm, but overall they're worth it.

Oh yeah, and they give you a true pickle (not one out of a jar) with your burger.  Props for that.

Drink:
My gf had the nutella shake, and it was divine.  The whipped cream had the perfect texture.

They had an OK beer list, but they had Chimay on tap, which earns points for me.

Price:
There definitely is a premium on the food, but for a gourmet burger it wasn't bad (with food and drinks, it was about $30/pp after tax and tip).

Service:
Absolutely terrible -- our server was slow to respond, and our quick meal turned into an hour and a half ordeal.

If you're an onion ring fan, then you'll love these.  Right about of sweet and crunch.  I rarely order onion rings, since I don't like them limp and stringy (like the blooming onion/onion loaf you find at Outback or Tony Roma's), so I was blown away when these arrived. 

I ordered a Hoegaarden from the menu which they served with a lemon slice which is wrong, but whatever.

I always get the BLT Burger -- it's their classic burger with bacon and some sort of sauce that has a mayo base.  Adding cheese is like $2 (I think?) so I tend to skip that and use my $2 towards a drink.  They recently expanded their wine list and I was pleased to see quite a few additions that I enjoy.

Caution: It's SUPER loud and cramped in this place...definitely not a romantic setting whatsoever! 

Food: They have pre-built ""meals"" if you want with a regular burger, fries, and a milkshake for $24. That's really really expensive for a burger to me...I could get TWO buffets for that!!!

I got the Lunchbox Shake which was inspired by a peanut butter and jelly sandwich...OMFG it tasted EXACTLY like one and I LOVEDDDD it!! I'm ready to go back right now for another.

Our other friend got the Double Barrel float which was Jack Daniel's and rootbeer float. His was our least favorite of the group. My husband got the Bad Moon Rising which was Blue Moon beer and orange sherbert....holy baby Jesus it was SO good! We are planning on making our own of this one! What a great idea since you put oranges in that beer anyways! 

Service: It was busy, but the annoying thing was our waitress didn't think she had to ""write"" down our orders. Instead of just writing them down like a normal person, she tried to remember them, but then she had to keep coming back and asking us to repeat them. That's freaking irritating!

For the price, our burgers were nothing to rave about but were not bad by all means. They should have put the veggies on the side because our lettuce on the burger was that ""not so awesome warm lettuce"" that was far from crisp. The buns are pretty good though, they were the highlight because they actually tasted fresh. I was most disappointed in the curly fries. They completely ruined my experience along with our waitress.

My friend and I both started off our meal with a Fuzzy the Bear milkshake: peach milkshake spike with peach schnapps! It was a fantastic appetizer. Decent size shake with lots of whipped cream and an oversized straw so nothing gets caught. You do only get the glass, unlike some places that give you the ""leftovers"" in the metal tumbler. 
I ordered the fried chicken cobb and my friend the fried pickles. The cobb had some different toppings than usual and I wasn't a fan of the endive in it which gave it a somewhat bitter taste. Other than that, I enjoyed the salad. It had a spicy dressing and the fried chicken had a light and airy batter surrounding it, somewhat like a light donut or funnel cake. It was different. The fried pickles came in the same batter which was nice since they weren't too heavy after drinking a milkshake. They came with a spicy dressing as well, probably the same that was on my salad. 
Service was friendly and pretty quick. We were very grateful that the waiter left the water jug on our table after filling up our glasses!

First off, they've got a great beer, mixed drink and 'adult' shake selection. I'm a beer guy and I don't think there's much to do to improve it. Boy, I was wrong again. I had a Blue Moon float with orange ice cream. Anyone who likes wheat beer, knows that it goes great with an orange wedge in it. Combining the beer with an orange ice cream was brilliant.

The fries are awesome here. They have skinny or fat fries. The fat fries are like the KFC potato wedges of old. (Not sure if KFC still serves them, because I haven't been in one, in a solid decade.) Crispy and delicious. A little thinner than KFC. They also offer you multiple dipping sauces, at no extra charge. I love condiments.

Burgers, of course, are also very good. While they are not cooked the way I would 100% prefer (char broiled or BBQ grilled) they are still quite good. I ordered mine medium rare and it was done perfect. I had both the BLT and the blue cheese burger, on two separate days. Both were excellent. 

One day, we were in a big hurry and they went out of their way to get us in and out. I appreciate that. Service was friendly and helpful, both days. The music was a little loud, but I'm not a huge fan of the music they were playing (mostly classic rock, yuck.) But it did make it a little hard for conversation in a restaurant. I could understand that, in a bar. Prices were reasonable, although the burgers do NOT include fries. Typical Vegas pricing, to say the least.

The salad was delightful - crispy veggies, a few exotic ones that I looked and went ""What are you?"", and a tasty but light oregano dressing. The burger, which we ordered medium as suggested, was only ok. I guess I expected more than run of the mill, but it wasn't terribly exciting. It wasn't bad, necessarily, just not great.

The fried pickles were okay. Nothing to write home about. About 9 pieces, so a buck a chip.  They're fried chips with a batter coating in case your wondering. 

Burgers were good. I'll admit it.  However, I've had just as good for a hell of a lot cheaper. Fries were nothing special.

The kicker, and two star rating, was when we got the check.  We were charged $3.50 apiece for 8oz refills of flat diet coke. The wife did not even ask for a refill.  It just showed up. Really?

3887666,2008-07-02,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"BLT Burger just opened today. It's a high-end burger restaurant with a big-name chef behind it like The Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay. 

The kitchen is open with a squad of sous-chefs furiously flipping meat like they were cirque du soleil jugglers; the decor is as thoughtful and deep as a Hallmark card; the staff are energetic and earnest as if  they were about to auditon for ""American Idol"".

The meat is ground by a butcher in the back; a combination of Black Angus sirloin, short ribs and chuck. The buns are made to order by La Brea bakery. 

The regular burger is very good ($9), but under-seasoned (you might want to add some salt). The various cheeses are $1 each. I had the sweet potato fries which were excellent with just the right degree of crispness. There is a good selection of draft beers; and a few choices of wines by the glass (there should be more than 3 in a restaurant with this pedegree). Not to mention that they serve it in Italian-bistro glasses instead of proper wine glasses.

When I asked for dijon mustard, the very eager and agreeable barman brought me some packets of Grey Poupon (they had better fix that!).

They also have an American Kobe burger ($17), a lamb burger, a chicken burger and a few other concoctions that didn't capture my attention.

I was disappointed to see that there was a line behind a velvet rope, waiting to get in, even though there were many empty tables. One of the managers told me it was because it was opening night and they were just getting their bearings. 
I hope that's the case, and that they haven't fallen prey to the ""manufactured exclusivity"" hustle that other places indulge in, including The Burger Bar. I've got some advice for all those places that think diners will enjoy their food more if they are forced to wait for it:  You're a restaurant, dammit, not an after-hours club!

In any case, BLT is a good addition to the vast Vegas burger scene. It's not the best burger I've had here, but it's better than The Burger Bar, and way better than Burger Brasserie or Stipburger. 

So unless you're willing to go off-strip to an unadorned little joint like The Burger Stop where the outstanding Kobe Burger is half the price, BLT will do just fine.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,1,0,2,R8fP2Gguz_1TfClqAnJcvw

A few pointers: pricey but worth it, fun atmosphere, no convenient bathroom (so don't hold it), sit at the bar, and order waffle fries!

So, random tidbit, they all wear these shirts that have statements on the back. Definitely good conversation starters. One for example was ""tip waiters not cows.""

I sat at the bar, ordered my customary ice tea and was given a menu.  There are several exotic burgers to choose from, but I opted for the relatively healthy grilled salmon since I was going to wreck my health with the marshmallow shake.  The sandwich didn't come with any sides, I ordered some onion rings on the advice of the bartender.

The shake came in the blink of an eye.  I was impressed with the speed and the taste.  It was a really good shake.  I might haved developed diabetes from it, but it was worth it.

The food on the other is a bit of a different story.  When everything was finally served, it looked beautiful.  Everything was neatly stacked and plated.  The burger was immaculate, a bit on the small side.  I think only 4.5 inches across.  It tasted fine, you could taste the salmon and the tartar sauce.  The other condiments were somewhat lost between the two.  The rings were a bit below average.  They were thick cut, but had a bit too much breading on them.  An order of rings consisted of about 15-20 neatly stacked rings.  The food wasn't bad by any means, it just wasn't fantastic, especially for the price.  The service however, was fantastic.  Everyone was friendly and my ice tea was always full.

Skip the sweet potato fries and maybe give the shoestrings a try.  The portion was small and they were soggy.  

The best thing we had was the nut job milkshake, which is pretty much a nutella milkshake.  You can never go wrong with Nutella, so this was a success.  Altought quite pricey at about $7.

The fried pickles were the absolute best I have ever had - EVER.  They were melt in your mouth, hot, juicy, and phenomenally excellent!  $6 and the portion was way more than fair!  I would go back just for a drink and fried pickles any ole time.

Shake was tasty.  Blended chunks of perfectly blackened marshmallow inside.   They very kindly split the shake into two cups for us and garnished each with a toasted marshmallow and a big straw for sucking ease!  1/2 a shake was more than enough for this girl!

VERY loud would be a one negative.  Another negative would be the seating.  Imagine a 4 top but where 2 strangers sit elbow to elbow with another 2 strangers.  It was odd for this type of setting.  I have no problem with places like the Hofbrau House where you sit with a large group of strangers, drink beers and sing songs.  It was just an odd experience in a setting like the BLT has.... it doesn't work IMO. 

Food....  my wife ordered a burger medium... it came out medium rare to almost rare.  This is a burger joint... serving thousands of burgers a week... they should know how to cook a burger to medium or however the guest requests it. 

I would say the burgers are on par with Red Robin or Johnny Rockets... again... nothing amazing.

I decided to go in around 11pm one night with a friend on the recommendation of a buddy that had tried out BLT recently for the first time as well. 

I am a sucker for a good martini and a great burger, (or steak but in this case a burger.) I ordered a Vodka martini and some chicken wings for my friend and I. They had 3 sauces available and I asked the server to mix it up with a few of each kind. He said ""No we can't do that"". He said.. NO WE CANT DO THAT. Lol... I know that being a Vegas local, I am used to most restaurant's giving you want you want to an extent. It's not like I was changing a recipe.. I wanted a bit of three different styles of wings, all the same price, no change in the portion size. At that, he didn't offer an explanation... just NO. So i'm like, cool.. We will just take them Spicy. No big deal.

The martini arrives. The server literally kicked a few pieces of trash on the way to the table when delivering the drink. Looking around, there was trash everywhere. I  mean alot of trash, not like a little bit. Many dirty tables and the floor was ridiculous. I'm guessing it was due to being understaffed, because the server took off after delivering my drink before I could order. 

Long story short, the second martini was a different size (less), I mentioned it and the server said they were trying to close up the bar. The wings didn't taste right, and when I asked the waiter why they tasted burnt.. he said they are ""double cooked"".. when I mentioned that I think the oil  they were frying them in was old, he said ""oh really"". 

Haha.. listen guys, I'm not that bad of a food snob, this is wings, burgers and martinis.. if it doesn't taste right I'm not going to just eat it. 

Burgers show up, over cooked but still tasty.. onion rings... burnt tasting and apparently fried in the same oil as the wings as they did not taste right.. like rancid oil was the flavor. The server dissapeared, most likely afraid of me asking him more questions. 

Finally he came back with the bill, and even as it was just after midnight he seemed to be rushing us. I asked about the 'deep fried oreos' as I had not had them before and he ordered them for us. Listed on the menu they were to be served with a berry sauce. They showed up with a ramekin of melted vanilla ice cream. When I asked about the berry sauce, he said ""it's not served with that'. I showed him the menu, and he said the menu was wrong. LMAO. This guy is a piece of work, and I actually had to laugh out loud. I just let it go and ate the Oreo's, paid the bill and left. 

I'll go back for one of these shakes someday.. the spiked ones every one talks about. It will be earlier in the evening when there is a full staff, a manager and when they aren't trying to close down the place for the night.

Ummm . . . . well, I wasn't just sitting here for fun, what the heck?!?!  She really never grew a personality from there on, every interaction was more annoying than the one before.  I don't remember ever tipping as bad and I did this person.  I like to believe I am a generous tipper, especially for good service, but this was not one of those experiences.  

I asked about the lamb burger and she replied, ""I'm not the one to ask, I hate lamb"".  Oh great.  I'll take the turkey burger then.  And it was average, a little hard, but average.  Hubby had the bacon burger and said the same - average, very average.   The kids ordered the chicken strips and lo and behold, LOVED them!  Their milkshakes were good too, devoured in a minute, but I wouldn't go back just for a milkshake and chicken strips.  Afterall, they are a burger place, right?

Besides the lack of special items, the food we got was only ""ok"". The waffle fries and the onion buns were really good, I admit. But the turkey burger was fairly dry and not too flavorful. Yes, I know that is the nature of turkey but it is possible to remedy that with certain techniques. On top of that, I had avocado added to it and it didn't take too long to realize that 4 slices were completely black and rotten tasting. Their apology?

My order has always been the same, but this year I changed one item...I will go back to my old ways!  My order is always the BLT Burger with waffle fries and a Black and White Milkshake.  This year, I decided to go with the ""skinny fries.""

The BLT burger consists of a 7 oz (I think) good beef burger with Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and something they call their Burger Sauce (kind of like a Thousand Island).  I always ask that they put American Cheese on it.  Well, this year, they forgot the American Cheese, so I had to send it back and get that added.  They also allowed the bun to get soggy, so I had to send it back AGAIN to get the bun right.  After the corrections, the burger was outstanding, as usual.

The skinny fries...well, let's just say that you should go for the waffle fries OR the sweet potato fries...the skinny fries tasted like they came from a bag of frozen fries.  While I often have this type of french fries and do not complain, I am not paying BLT Burger prices for them.  Back they went...and bring on my waffle fries.

The Black and White Shake?  What can I say...I rarely allow myself the luxury of a milkshake...but...this one...always...and it was as good as it has ever been!

Service is quite good...and they were very good about making ""repairs"" to my order...but...no one offered any type of reparation for my troubles...another troubling factor.

Now...in years past...and I have done this for 5 years now...none of these issues have ever occurred...was it an off night?  Who knows, maybe I will go back tomorrow night and try again!  But...I give them 3 stars because of the issues...in the past, they would have received 4-5 stars!

What I liked about eating at BLT Burger was that most of their selection was made up of standard ingredients that you can find at most burger places.  BLT Burger separates itself from other places by using high quality products instead of obscure ingredients to create unique, tasty flavors.  

My meal here consisted of a BLT burger and sweet potato fries.  The burger was very good.  All of the ingredients tasted fresh and very flavorful.  The sweet potato fries were a bit too shriveled, and I would have preferred for them to be chunkier.  However, they were still very good, and my wife kept raving about them.

MY BOYFRIEND TO THE WAITRESS: ""I'LL HAVE THE NUT JOB.""

Git your dirty minds outta the gutter!!!!!  It's not what you think!!!!  ;) 

BLT Burger may seem like your typical burgers, fries, and milkshake spot buuuuuut it really isn't. Their burgers and shakes are pretty fancy schmancy (yet reasonably priced) with different variations offered depending on the ingredients used.  Seating is a plenty and there's even a bar where you can watch either the multiple TVs OR you can watch the cooks cook and build your burger.

My favorite 'burger' here is the Salmon ($14) consisting of Atlantic Salmon, Avocado, Red Onion, Watercress, and Zesty-Cayenne Tartar Sauce. Mine and my boyfriend's favorite milkshake here is The Nut Job ($7), hence my boyfriend asking the waitress for a Nut Job! It's made with Vanilla Ice Cream, Nutella, and Slivered Almonds. OMG, it's all yummy goodness!

During our weekend stay in Vegas we ate here 3 times!!!  I ordered a different burger each time, but aside from the Salmon I can't remember the other ones I had (must've not made that much of an impression on me).  As for the fries, the burgers do not come with fries so me and my boyfriend shared, which was good since the burgers are pretty hefty.  Out of the skinny, fat, and waffle fries I preferred the waffle fries. 

Needless to say, I was strung out on burgers and fries after our 3rd time here, but we still couldn't get enough of the Nut Job. Before leaving Vegas my boyfriend was craving a Nut Job and so we took one to go.  If you happen to come to BLT, get the Nut Job: it's amazeballs!

I stayed at the Mirage where this place was located and after two nights in a row of clubbing and heavy drinking my friends and I stopped her both days to catch their half off happy hour foods. 

First off, the staff was friendly and really accommodating especially for some of my friends that couldn't handle their alcohol as well and got the 7 of us seated within a few minutes with waters already poured and placed around the table. For less $30 both nights we got a really large spread, one order of nachos, two boneless wings, two brisket sliders and one order of fries, all for under $30! And yes, enough to feed all 7 of us. 

Late night happy hour goes from 11pm to ~3am and there's other options such as fried pickles and popcorn shrimp, but I would have to say that the brisket sliders were really tender and filling and went really well as a cure alcohol in our systems. The fries were covered in this ranch/bbq mix sauce that could've tasted more amazing because most of us were inebriated, but I'm they simply were just that flavorful! The wings were alright, nothing too special as they were like hard chicken nuggets that were simply over bbq sauced. 

Overall a great place to stop by for a post clubbing snack, especially for the cheap prices! However, the only downside is that after we got our check and paid we were ignored; something I felt was a little unprofessional; my friends and I were buzzing still, but we weren't obnoxious to the point where you'd ignore our requests for water and even the possibility to order more food. So, sorry, but that explains why I had good things to say about the food, but service is also an important factor in the restaurant business that I feel they shouldn't have ignored especially in a place like Las Vegas.",1_WCnEFLFI6igUYtwbCbTw,4,2,3,AO3fExNzJSDmu5S16-FmnQ

Considering its location, I don't have any gripes about the price (~$35 for a burger, shake, and milkshake), and the restaurant certainly provided a great meal.

blt burger is alright in my book. the menu seemed to have some appealing options, but none i could decide on. i debated between the lamb burger and falafel burger. the lamb burger came with olives and cucumbers, and not being a fan of either, decided i should just go for the falafel. 

not to mention our waitress was pretty unhelpful at making suggestions. when both me and my friend asked her for her recommendation she would just say, ""it just depends on what you like!"" well, of course it does, i guess, but we're asking for at least a half-assed fake, ""most people order this"" at the very least. meh. 

the falafel burger, sure enough came with a very large falafel patty which i couldn't finish at all. it is HELLA falafel, is all i'm saying. it's a good falafel, but LOTS of falafel. almost an overdose of falafel. i enjoyed it, but wished the patty might have been thinner or something... hm. perhaps that's just me.

also ordered the sweet potato fries, which were as good as any sweet potato fries in my book. if i were to go back in time i might want to try the waffle fries, just because i haven't had waffle fries in a long time.

I had the Atlantic Salmon Burger. This is the first time that I've had a salmon  burger. Salmon can be bland tasting but the condiments that came with it complimented it finely. The burger held together well. The meat wasn't too flaky or mushy.It was pretty moist and the bun was toasted well. I liked the tartar sauce but didn't detect the spiciness that the cayenne in it should of carried out. Perhaps i just have a higher tolerance for spice. 

I got an order of sweet potato fries as well. They weren't the best ones i've ever had and are a thinner cut than how i usually like them ,but they were  still crispy and had good flavor. I can't go wrong with sweet potato fries.i just love them so much haha.

I was glad our server recommended the Patty Melt Burger from their daily special menu... it was a burger beef patty with apple wood smoked bacon, swiss cheese melted perfectly, their BLT sauce, all between two pieces of thick cut rye bread.  And I just love a burger place that asks me how I would like my burger, to which I responded medium, and that is exactly what the server recommended.

It was a perfect, melty, juicy burger.  I am confident everything on their menu has to be fantastic.  My boyfriend had the original burger, and enjoyed his.  We shared a hard milkshake which was AMAZING. It was called the ""Night Rider,"" chocolate milkshake with oreo cookie crumbles and kaluha.  The shake alone was so amazing that I came back the next day and ordered one to-go from their convenient to-go counter.  Although I think you get more of the shake if you dine-in, I thoroughly appreciated the portability.

The other occasion we came to BLTs, I ordered a Wagyu beef burger... it was like eating a steak it was so good.  I ordered it with cheddar cheese and it was wonderful.  

They also offer deep fried oreos on the menu... didn't get a chance to try them! I also like the clever saying on the waiters'/waitresses' shirts that said ""Tip Waiters not Cows.""  Great service and awesome food.",kRab6yMf80baJ2RxY-7a9A,2,1,5,PvO72xE7WmmYdmfvzIeZMw

We were here for fourth meal around 11 PM during the middle of the week.  We originally wanted to go to California Pizza Kitchen which is next door, but they were closed.  There were four of us, and although we probably thought we were awesome, I'm sure we were obnoxious.  So kudos to our waiter for being friendly, attentive and for putting up with our awesome jokes.   

We ordered waters and shared the Night Rider spiked shake.  It's a magical concoction of Kahlua, Chocolate Liqueur, Oreos and Chocolate Ice Cream.  You could easily have a sugar overload on it, so I'm glad we all shared it.  We also ordered their fried pickles as an appetizer and they were delicious.  I'm used to fried pickles just having a slight breading on them, but they were almost fluffy with the breading and were very tasty.  I ordered the American Wagyu burger (portabello, spinach and truffle aioli) with sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked perfectly, but just underwhelming compared to the pickles, fries and shake.   I ended up taking the toppings off and just eating the bun and patty.  The others ordered breakfast sandwiches and the kobe beef sliders which they all enjoyed.  I think our bill came to just over $100 for four people which isn't too bad for Vegas.  

They weren't too busy that late, so we had pretty good seats close to the bar and it wasn't loud at all (well, except for us).",fw94lNhwRxeklb2ZKAFe2w,2,3,4,nCHmmLDKN3dJR2WDIje7qg
4414602,2010-01-11,6,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"So it's pricier than In N Out but what did you expect? Just look at the establishment, you know you're not about to buy two cheeseburgers for $1. They have the menu right in front of the restaurant, so you should peep at it before you make your decision. If it's too much for a burger, then go directly across the street to McDonald's.

Our waiter was on the ball. I never had to ask for a refill on my soda. He would bring me a new glass before I made that funny noise through the straw when there's no more drink left in the cup/glass. He didn't do this just once but twice without me saying a word. He repeatedly checked up on us. This is an example of how service in Vegas should be like. You don't want to send anyone home a loser. Least you can do for stripping their kid's college fund or taking their home's mortgage is give them good service and make them feel somewhat better about themselves.

I was tempted to try their kobe beef burger for $17. However, I just went with the combo: soda, classic, burger and fries which was not much less but it did come with a soda and fries. I substituted my regular fries for sweet potato fries which was not a problem at all. I'm a sucker for sweet potato fries. They were alright here. 

My classic burger was made just about right. Medium - slight pink in the middle. Tender meat and all the condiments and toppings complimenting one another. All this sided with a pickled cucumber which I'm not usually a fan of but it goes together after every burger bite. Wash it down with tasty beverage and everything plays out like a
perfect harmony.

My cousins ordered the chocolate milkshake to share. The shake looks like it's 1000 calories, the drink is massive (no joke, I'll put up a picture soon). Between the two girls they were not even able to finish it. Maybe it was too sweet for their blood. It was more of a full on dessert than a drink.

Our tab for three people came out to $40ish probably close to $50 after I put down the tip because I thought our waiter deserved it. Pricey but it was a pretty darn good burger and I'm not much of a burger person myself. Once in a while a joint like this isn't a bad idea. I'm not eating $15 burgers daily anyways. Besides, you're in Vegas, live a little.

Throughout the course of our meal, they had a lot of classic 80's jams on. No complaints there, can never get tired with that musical selection.

Variety of burgers all made to order, which in my experience have come out perfectly cooked.

Shakes which are spiked with alcohol, each one with it's own distinctive flavor and just the right amount of alcohol that you can barely tell it's there, but enough to have me slightly tipsy at the end of a full shake (I'm a lightweight drinker btw).

While the price is far from cheap, you're talking about a restaurant directly on the strip, and you've come to expect to pay a price for having a location like that.  

Verdict:  If you're looking for a burger/shake place on the strip and have $30 to spend on it, this is an excellent choice.  If you're looking for cheaper (say In-and-Out), you better have a mode of transportation (car or cab) and be willing to shell out to get there... which may end up getting close to same cost anyway if you're traveling alone.

I had originally tried to go there back in July 2008 when we had tickets to LOVE, but there was some sort of incident that closed the restaurant down and we had to find another option.  It had remained on my radar ever since though.

We went on a Monday evening, arriving something between 8:30 - 9:00 p.m.  I was pleasantly surprised that there was no wait.  We also got a nice table right by the breezeway, which led to some nice people watching and a game I like to call 'real or fake'.  

The service was good all-around, quick, friendly and the server even was kind enough to fake laugh at some of my jokes.  I ordered the #2 combo, which is a basic burger (with cheddar), fries (waffle style) and a milkshake (nut job).  The burger was good, but nothing particularly stood out about it.  The waffle fries were below average, a little too much seasoning I though.  The milkshake tasted pretty good, but the one problem with it was that it came with two HUGE straws (if you've ever been to Panera Bread and gotten a frozen drink, like that, but I think bigger).  I didn't try, but I'm pretty sure I literally could have fit three regular sized straws within this straw.  Anyways, the straw sucked, and not in the good way, I wasn't even able to get all the milkshake from the glass.  I also tried one of the wife's onion rings and it was average at best.

The remainder of the party was basically 'meh' about this place.  I didn't think it was a great value, but we were in Vegas, so what can you expect.

Burgers - the burgers are delicious! Savory, beefy, cheesy, and all things yummy. I can't say anything more about the burgers except that they were very good. You really just need to bite down on one yourself.

Anyway, I ate their Falafel Veggie burger and I've eaten it every time ever since. If you enjoy crispy falafel, you'll like this. It comes with a tangy spread that is probably hummus and avocado. The falafel is green because of the veggies inside but the flavor isn't overwhelmingly green. The veggies keep it from drying out too.

We stumbled upon BLT, when we saw the line for the Carnegie deli.  
BLT has cool decor.  The floor and ceilings are made from ends of different sized pieces of wood, think 2x4s cut off at different ends.  It makes for interesting textures on the ceiling. The floor has a similar motif, but all the same size and polished to look like tile.  In the rear, there is a grill area with brick red shiny tile, flanked by huge black and white murals of the desert.  

We were seated in a booth.  The table with kinda low for the height of the booth seats.  

Our waitress was excellent.  She was helpful and pleasant.  Her recommendations were spot on.  

Jeff and I split an order of onion rings and a bleu cheese burger.  The burger had carmelized onions and bleu cheese.  They were in the right proportion for the burger.  I didn't eat my part of the bun, but I really enjoyed it.
The onion rings were terrible.  The waitress admitted that they were frozen.  I get that, but serving cold fried things is just gross. 

I also ordered a bowl of chili.  At first, I wasn't impressed.  I make a mean pot of chili.  But, the more I ate it, the more I liked it.  The little slice of cornbread that came with it was pretty good, too.

4654879,2016-04-05,10,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"When I hear the song ""I've had the time of my life"" I now think of Dirty Dining and ""Dirty Dancing."" If you are unfamiliar with Dirty Dining, it is when the Southern Nevada Health Department (abbreviated SNHD) hands out demerits for health violations. If only we had been cognizant of their dirty dancing with the SNHD , there would be no review. Just this past month, not only did the SNHD appear on March 8; they returned on March 16. On March 8, the SNHD handed BLT a 39-demerit C-rating. Did BLT learn their lesson? Apparently not, considering that on the 16th the SNHD handed them 19 demerits. The consequence was that the SNHD shut them down on March 16. But they reopened the next week when we ate here. The ultimate consequence is that BLT is getting a bad name being in the paper and will shut down on Tuesday to become LVD Burger on April 7.

   Whether it is BLT or LVD Burger, it is really the Mirage Burger. The Mirage has a role in operating the eatery. The health inspection failures at BLT might of been avoided if Mirage management was on top of the cleanliness of the restaurants. It seems that the Mirage involvement was to take the restaurant off the hotel's website and to change the name. 

    Before the Dirty Dining chapter ended the BLT story, the first chapter began about a decade ago when the Mirage decided that they could make money by moving the tigers from the Mirage entrance to the Secret Garden in the back and make additional money by replacing it with a burger restaurant. It was one of the leading fancy burger restaurants on the Strip. When I tried it years ago, I wasn't crazy nor did I dislike it. If the restaurant conditions weren't gross, after this month's visit I'd be of the same opinion. 

     When we dined here in late March, it was obvious that I wasn't the only one unaware of the demerits. The former home of the Mirage tigers was busy. There was no wait. Jennifer, I believe was her name, did a good job serving our table. Being a restaurant on the Las Vegas Strip in the MGM-owned Mirage paying more than what the meal was worth was expected. I chose the Shaft's Blue Burger for $16 and to add fries and bottomless Coke for an additional $7. If LVD serves the exact burger with a different name it will be all right. It included Shaft's Blue vein cheese that was as unnoticeable as a shy person in a party. The blue vein cheese had no presence. The burger included balsamic caramelized onions, and mushrooms. Nearby was the cup of potato wedges. They were allright. If I had done it all again, I might of ordered the milk shake. Our table afforded a view of the milk shakes on the counter that looked good. Unaware of the restaurants Dirty Dining fame, we left the restaurant with the impression that we overpaid for okay food. 

   In conclusion, I am of the opinion that this review and the canon of BLT Yelp reviews will still be resourceful when the Mirage retires the BLT name. I feel that they are putting lipstick on a different pig. In other words, my analysis is that BLT now has a bad name causing the Mirage to keep the burger and milkshake restaurant in the exact spot with a new name.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,14,9,2,guj8RA2uksPhEHqcKM6Wgw

Before I ate at BLT Burger (Laurent Tourondel's place) inside the Mirage at Vegas, my viewpoint towards chef's who ordained their name in front of the marquee was respectable.  Now I say...let me eat at a restaurant that doesn't have a person's name attached and if I like it and it just so happens to be a food mogul's place than I'll give him/her mad-ass props.

BLT Burger deserves no props and I attach a scarlet letter to any BLT franchises around the world.  Without going off on a tangent about the prolific appearance of ala-carte burger joints in every major city, BLT Burger is subpar to a Chili's and Fuddruckers.

It was late when I went, and I was nursing a good daytime soiree of inebriations.  I thought BLT was the best choice.  Wrong.  The meat by itself was tasteless.  Any burger can be accessorized; there is nothing special with all the combinations offered on BLT's menu.  The fries - In N Out has them beat hands down.  I tasted a chocolate shake and vanilla one.

FIRST
Buffalo Fries: Curly fries topped with bleu cheese crumbles and herbs with sides of buffalo sauce and ranch dressing. Much better than I was expecting! The best part is that the sauces are on the side, so the fries were still crispy throughout the meal.

Garlic Fries: The fries are really fantastic and the amount of garlic was perfect. Yum. I'd eat these fries again in a heartbeat. These are definitely on the top of my list now.

SECOND
I-80 Burger: Peppercorn crusted bacon, smokey sweet BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, sharp cheddar, pickle. Great combination of ingredients to make a very tasty burger. The burger itself was nice and cooked to order.

Salmon Burger: Atlantic salmon, avocado, red onion, watercress, zesty cayenne tartar sauce. The server didn't ask for cooking temperature, but the stick indicated Medium. The salmon was actually a bit overcooked and dry. Either way, the toppings were great.

California Chicken Burger: Grilled chicken breast, arugula, sundried tomato, avocado, red onion, mozzarella, pesto. I really enjoyed this burger! The chicken breast was moist and everything played so well together.

THIRD
Chocolate Sundae: chocolate ice cream with fudge. Nothing special. Plain ol' chocolate ice cream and fudge.

Deep Fried Oreos served with frozen custard and chocolate sauce. These were pleasantly surprising. This may have been my first time having deep fried Oreos and oh my, I see why they're so popular! The Oreos are softened like cake and the batter is nice and doughy. It was also not overwhelmingly sweet, which is why they were even better with the frozen custard and chocolate sauce. Total YUM.

Overall, the food was fantastic! All of our burgers were delicious and the fries and dessert were also pleasing. I know that the burger prices could be a deterrent, however, you're getting great quality and they're large burgers!

Service was just okay. Our server didn't seem very happy to wait on us and it seemed a bother when we asked for anything. Also, toward the end of our meal, I asked for Sprite (or whatever lemon-lime soda they offered) and it was COMPLETELY FLAT. I mean, literally, there were NO bubbles in the glass and it tasted horrible. So, I asked for a replacement and I received the EXACT same flat, horrible soda. I couldn't believe it.

On the dine in visit, he never checked back on us to see how the meal was and we had to flag him down to get a refill and then again for a check.

Food:
Burgers are decent, nothing out of this world, but better than your typical chain restaurant.  You get a choice of fries and we had 2 different kinds, both came out a bit undercooked and lacked a nice crisp/crunch that should be automatic in these ""high end"" burger joints.
Shakes are ok and the one we had was ~$9, which is highway robbery.  There was also about 1/2 a portion left in the mixer after she poured it into our to-go cup.  I asked her what she would do with that and she replied ""We spill it out"". I said that most would throw it in as a side car.  She gave me a blank look and poured it in the sink.
So ~$9 for about a 12oz shake.

It wasn't too stuffy or fancy pants as the menu and location might lead you to believe. Definitely recommend you stop in for a bite!",8Z3kcbaTUvAWJw4o5_Sk4A,5,2,4,ZE3BQA0r7e19D3A8oQWZdA

The lamb tandoori burger there is simply to die for.  As my friend put it:  ""You don't want to swallow it because you don't want the flavor to go away.""  The flavor of the lamb really comes through, and was not overly dressed.  As a fan of Twinkies, I really enjoyed the Twinkie milkshake -- they did not skimp on the Twinkies, and the additional of caramel sauce made the Twinkie shake enjoyable even for those who aren't otherwise Twinkie fans.  I also enjoyed the School Lunch shake, which was a peanut butter and jelly shake.  The vegetarians enjoyed their falafel burgers, which was humongous.  I have also had their s'mores sandwich dessert, which was really captured the essence of a smokey campfire; I only wish the marshmallow were warmer and more gooey.",_QqastpJJmlxEScLaI4Mow,0,0,4,CJ2iPUYi_Xhq-IjSPnJN8w

My wife's Shafts Blue Cheese Burger was tasty-the onions were perfectly caramelized.  My BLT burger was a traditional bacon burger and both were cooked as ordered.

The waffle fries were okay... chic-fil-a is still better (lol), my sweet potato fries were over-seasoned, by the end I was scraping off the seasoning before eating them. I do have to say that they were cooked correctly, I've had them over-cooked and dry and under-cooked and floury/chalky tasting. The onion rings were salty. It was a good amount of onion rings, but they were salted on the outside, which I thought was weird... never had salty onion rings.. We did enjoy the chocolate milk shake, tasted like chocolate ice cream with chocolate whipped cream (yum!).

I ordered the classic burger with Swiss and a side of sweet potato fries. If it weren't for the fact that I was starving, I would have sent everything back.

The burger was supposed to be medium and it was raw. The menu didn't say anything about the toppings so I had no clue there was raw onion on it. Ewwww! Talk about a rude awakening when taking the first bite.

Upon entering this establishment it seemed promising.  The host which we found out was a UFC fighter, but above all the ONLY pleasant employee in BLT Burger.  

Since we were pressed for time, I decided to just have a couple drinks while Dave had a Turkey Burger and we both agreed that we were going to sit at the bar for faster service.  

The bartender I think her name was Jessica, not too sure she was the only one not wearing a name tag came over to us and with the grouchiest face and attitude asked us what we wanted to drink.  Being from Michigan, I was debating between a Michigan beer or a Guinness and as she stood there arms folded, rocking between her left leg and right leg, huffing, and making me feel like I was wasting her precious time, I finally said ""I am sorry can you please give me a moment""  She very loudly huffed a huge sigh and walked away......never to return again.  

I had to flag down a guy and we gave him our entire order, after placing our roder with him he proceeded to wash down the counter and either he smelled like major B.O. or the rag he was using was EXTREMELY dirty!!  It was the most disgusting thing I have smelled in a restaurant....we also ended up sitting next to the condiment tray, you know with the fruit and what not, every time it opened fruit flies came out.  

While waiting for our order I did notice that not one single employee in the entire restaurant had a smile on, not one person tried talking to customers after their meals were dropped off, and while sitting at the bar not one person ever bothered to talk to us.  Our food was dropped off, dried up burger and burnt onion rings.  

I am not impressed at all.....finally Jessica came up after the meal and asked us this time with a smile, ""would you like some dessert?""  My response....""I would never order anything from you or this place again!""  We left and I will never eat here again, Bad service, bad food, and just overall bad atmosphere!

Ahi Tuna Spring Roll ($12.00) - I thought I was getting an actual spring roll, but what came out was a roll sliced into resembling sushi. Ugh, the deception. Much disappointment. ""Roll"" consisted of raw tuna, cucumber, herbs, avocado and served with side of pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy lime dressing. I didn't see any avocado in my roll and mentioned it to a passing waiter. He asked me if I wanted a side of avocados and since I had a craving for it, I said yes and ended up paying an additional $1.50 for three thin slices. 

Lamb Tandoori ($14.00) - Interesting mix of Mediterranean salsa and mint-cilantro yogurt sauce over the slightly charred lamb burger. This was messy to consume and I'm already a clumsy person so it did not bode well for my dress. 

I-80 ($14.00) - Bacon, cheddar cheese, onions and slathered with BBQ sauce. Things just taste better better with bacon. Yay for perfectly crisped bacon!

Hearts Combo ($7.00) - added Curly Fries and a Monkey Business Milkshake to top off the meal. Each burger combo comes with a slice of dill pickle that just tastes bad. The curly fries were all right. I really liked the milkshake made of bananas, peanut butter, chocolate, and vanilla ice cream. I'm not too fond of whipped cream, but even the whipped cream swirled on top was tasty with bits of peanuts!

It's pretty good burger. Between here and The Burger Pit at the Mandalay Bay though, I'd say the Pit takes this one. That isn't to say this place isn't good. It's constantly packed, but where in Vegas isn't. It's my second time back so that says something. They get your burger done right. Good lunch spot.

*If you're not that hungry, share a burger. Although don't ask them to split it for you.. there's a ridiculous splitting fee, you might as well get another burger.

First, we walked up and there was no line.  We walked up to the hostess and told her there were two of us. She said ""Sitting in the bar might be faster for a seat..."" (There were plenty of seats in the restaurant)

We went to the bar because we had been on a plane and we were hungry, so wherever got us the food fastet was A-OK with me.  But I thought it was a little snippety of her to reccomend the bar.  It's not like we were poorly dressed in a fancy restaurant or anything.  It was weird. When we got to the bar, a bartender (I thought) greeted us and asked what we would like to drink.  I saw a bottle of Grey Goose on the counter. I also saw martini glasses.  So what did I ask for you think? A martini.  Bartender screwed up his face like I had asked for a big heaping pile of steamy dog shit.  Martini. Give me the shaker and I'll do it myself. No biggie.  He said (face still screwed up) ""Wouldn't you rather have beer? We have some on tap.""  Not a super cool, only in vegas beer on tap, just ""some.""  Sensing his martini apprehension, I ordered a Blue Moon Belgian Summer Ale. Still good.  No martini, but good.

I got the Kobe beef burger. I tasted NO difference from regular beef. Matter of fact, since we were sitting at the bar, I had a view of the chef.  He had all the burgers in one place, with no obvious distinction of Kobe beef vs regular beef.  And once they were covered in cheese, he moved them around again, so I really don't even know if it was Kobe beef.  It was a little overcooked, even though the menu says medium, I repeated medium, it was more well done for my taste.  I thought it was OK, but not $17 worth. I've had similar quality at Red Robin, which doesn't say much.

The shining star of the night was the milkshake we shared for dessert.  Campfire Marshmallow.  Toasted marshmallows in vanilla ice cream.  Yum.

We went back for lunch on Saturday before we went home to get another one. I got the regular beef and it was cooked fine, tasted the same as the other burger. Doused it in mustard to make it better.  Hubby still said it was fine and ordered his own marshmallow shake.  I got the PB&J.  Too much PB.  I was SO thirsty afterward.

Overall, it was not horrible, and obviously I went back,  but I was told that Burger Bar is MUCH better. I will go there in the future.",SCMxOlCKgfqcbBemv48AnA,1,0,2,pGmIqYdTNafTVspIhkG_0g

Located in the Mirage near the side exit toward The Forum Shop.  it is a close walk enough to be away from the casino floor.  

For me, it is a must-do tradition to eat here at least once while I visit Vegas.  My ""usual"" order would be the Classic with no onions, add cheese and a fried egg.  In addition, I would make it a combo with fries and nutella milkshake. 

Sounds a lot and usually I can't finish but I always have to order it. 

There is a nice list of unique Milkshake flavor to choose: from the traditional to the fancy, alcoholic or non-alcoholic. fruity to nutty... I think it is worth trying one of your favorite flavors. 

Staff have been nice and occasionally they would get my order wrong but they are quick to change and fix it.

We all opted for starters as we had the munchies from a couple of hours of beer drinking, I opted for the 8 piece buffalo wings, packed a nice spicy punch and the chicken was cooked nicely with the skin nice and golden but before we finished those our mains turned up, I know it's a busy place but i hate being rushed through my meal, and i'm a fast eater anyway so it was quick. For the main I went for 'Shaft's Blue which is a 7oz. Grilled CAB, Shaft's blue vein cheese, balsamic caramelized onion and mushrooms and sweeet jesus was it lovely, i asked for the burger to be cooked medium/rare and they didn't disappoint, the combo of all the ingredients worked well, also would like to mention the Lamb Tandoori burger, my friend said it was a winner, and it must of been, he wouldn't let me try it.

Thus, a plate of bran flakes would've probably gotten a decent number of stars for the chance to be on the ground in Vegas after the trip.

Clearly, BLT Burger provided a better meal than bran flakes. We got one of the 'combo meals' of burger + regular fries + shake, and a side of sweet potato fries and another shake (malibu/ pineapple/ something for her, espresso/ kahlua for me).  This was plenty of food for two people, and saved a bit of money that we could later spend on the slots.  The sweet potato fries were much better than the regular, and the burger was properly juicy with a nice, soft bun.  Nothing super special, but still good.

The shakes were the highlight.  They were thick, rich, and topped with plenty of whipped cream.  I wish the straw had a slightly larger diameter, but that's a tiny criticism.  There was some vigorous sucking involved in getting all that goodness up the tiny little straw.

Service was good, water service was reasonable, price was what you'd expect from Vegas, and shakes get the place to about a 3.5, and I'll round up for the happiness that I had from getting off that plane and into a nice, comfy booth.",dKA5pV924YpE3zmAzShLcw,2,1,4,NqKMCK7ualzok77wcmBoEw

First of all, the lamb burger is the thing to order here. It is amazing. Delicious. Spectacular. From what I've gathered, the other burgers miss the mark. They just aren't as good, and are a tad disappointing.

I opted for the veggie salad, which the waiter stated came with all sorts of veggies. When it arrived, it was a sad sight.

Which led me to desperately dig into the onion rings and fries the others had ordered. The onion rings were not bad hot, but the batter was very thick and when they cooled a bit it was very doughy, not crispy at all. The fat fries are more like potato spuds, and were just ok. For $5 for each side of fries or rings- not worth it. Not to mention tacking on a milkshake or soda...

The others all got burgers which seemed OK, but what a ripoff! Even for the Strip... Burgers were around $16, but each topping you add was $1.50. So to add some bacon, cheese, etc.... My boyfriend spent an additional $6 in just measly add ons! Our meal here was much more expensive than eating at the trendy Thai restaurant at Aria.

So we had returned from a show at the Aria and were looking for a place to eat.  After considering all our culinary options @ The Mirage, we ended up at BLT Burgers.   They had plenty of burgers on their list that looks delicious, I opted to try their Kobe beef burger and sweet potato fries, my husband had the Tex Mex burger with onion rings.
Neither of us tried the milk shakes, as it was getting late and we didn't feel like filling up with milk shakes at that hour, however I did see some milkshakes ""walking by"" our table and oh man do those look delicious!  I'll have to return back for one of those some day.

Anyway, my burger was fantastic!! I opted not to add anything to it, I figured that if I was going to taste a Kobe beef hamburger, I didn't want anything interfering with the taste of BEEF so I ate it with onion and tomato, plain as it comes, and it was a great decision on my part, the burger alone was so flavorful, it would've been a shame to spoil it by adding something to it.
The sweet potato fries were delicious, they were lightly seasoned with chili powder (I think?) and were ohhh so good!

My husband's Tex Mex burger was good also, their chili there is very smooth and flavorful and the onion rings were great... the kind you can actually bit into without the entire string of onion following.... that's always a plus! 

The service here was really good, the waiter we had was attentive and frequently refilled our drinks.  

I'm close to giving this joint a 5 star review, but although such prices are to be expected when you dine out in Vegas, AND at a gourmet burger place, I'd still like to knock off a star for the steep pricing.  I'm also withholding 1 star due to the fact that they DO infact have a combo option, but it doesn't allow for you to choose any burger but the Classic one.   I've been to other gourmet burger bars where you are able to substitute the burgers in their combos, they just adjust the price accordingly.... so .... that is why I'm not giving 5 stars.

That's it though, no minus for service or food, I highly recommend this one, just be prepared to pay somewhere between $12-17 per burger, an additional $5 or so for a side and then theres the drinks.

Go, eat, have fun & be merry.  Chances are that if you're in Vegas to begin with, you're not here to save money so instead of dropping another $20 on a slot machine which yields nothing in return, bring it to BLT burgers instead and invest in a burger ;-)",MpJfcgUY6gz7TY1yK5u7Qw,0,0,4,5Z-B7qSbp86oAVh10aeQXw
5134936,2012-08-01,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"A few thoughts --

1.  The only cheaper eats in the Mirage that is NOT out by the pool OR in cigarette smoke.

2.  Best tap beer in the Mirage.  (Walk up to STACK or the bar at KOKOMOS.  No tap.  Mind boggling.  Party CITY and no tap.  You can't explain it either, can you?)

3.  Not everything on the menu is good.  Lamb and Turkey burgers not to die for, for which for these prices and location should be.

4.  Many items are crazy delicious. 

5.  I had missed the CRAVINGS BUFFET breakfast and dreamed that BLT would offer a breakfast sandwich for us late risers.  While I was dreaming I discovered they did.  WOW.  (Regrettably, the sandwich is salt laden as the homemade pototo hash brown is grease laden.  I'd ask for them to put the meat on the side and serve simple french fries.)

6.  A year or two ago I felt service and cleanliness lacked.  Sometimes a restaurant is such a hit it can actually HURT the restaurant.  Apparently new management has arrived to save the day, because service was again solid and the place was spotless.

7.  BLT Burger wasn't the first strip burger joint, but it was one of the new modern joints and set a solid standard.  It's impossible to be the best burger place anywhere anyhow but it is definitely one of the better.  And so if you're walking by and need to grab a bite in the Mirage, a good choice.  Especially late night.

OH WAIT!!!  I ALMOST FORGOT!!!

8.  You're not a red meat person.  You don't want a fattening meal at 1AM.  You want a snack with protein.   TRY THE FISH TACOS.  Not Los Angeles authentic but very tasty in their own right.  Honest.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,0,0,4,UmO0VWFIBtSP3pHVZi4zdQ

Will, our waiter was very pleasant, had good knowledge of the menu and was always ready with refills. 

The prices were a bit much for the amount you received on your plate but it is Vegas after all. It's not the place of 5.99 steak dinners anymore.

I ordered brisket mac n cheese. I would not recommend it, nor would I order it again (it was on the happy hour specials list for the day). BBQ brisket and mac n cheese, though good separate, did not combine well in the same dish. It was served tandoori style. I love the baked in taste but again it just didn't go down so well. I was not going to complain though since I wasn't paying the bill this round. Again it was just OK.

The Twinkie shake I had on the other hand, I could have as a meal replacement any day of the week. So rich but oh so delightful.

I ordered the Shaft's Blue burger (blue cheese, caramelized onions, mushrooms) and the Night Rider boozeshake (Kahlua, chocolate liqueur, Oreo cookies, chocolate ice cream). For dessert, the ""krispy kreme"" doughnut bread pudding with rum raisin ice cream. 

The burger was good. Not great, but good. The booze shake was good too. Definitely got a little buzzed from it. The krispy kreme bread pudding was DISGUSTING. It was just sugary and gross. I'm surprised I didn't get diabetes after eating a few spoonfuls of it.

I also tried the fried pickles and enjoyed them, they're different than most  because they are fried with a soft batter that reminded me of something you'd have on fish and chips. They give you a large order so skip the fries and share these with someone.

5414790,2012-07-30,0,YhCAJ8acd1X7GkCHPhD8Xw,"We were in the area and needed something to eat. Rather than consult Yelp and then figure out which hotel an eatery is located at (especially in the midday heat), we looked around for a place with a long line and decent looking food and BLT fit the bill. 

Despite the moniker including the word ""burger"", we only opted to try both a salad and a burger - specifically the vegetarian falafel burger and the citrus salmon salad. We went with the server's recommendation of the fat fries. The falafel burger was literally a crunchy falafel patty tucked inside a burger. Generally speaking, it was pretty good though I think they could find a new burger bun supplier as that fell a little short. This is very filling and somewhat heavy, so we were glad we went 50-50 and split the salad and the burger. The salad was surprisingly good since this is a burger joint. The salmon was seasoned well and had a nice char to it without being overcooked. The salad was dressed well and the lettuce and avocadoes were fresh and light. 

The fries were definitely fat and seasoned; since I don't really care for seasoned fries, I only had a few pieces. I noticed most people just split an order of fries (or whatever fried item) since the portion is fairly sizeable. For what it's worth, it seemed like only the skinny fries were not seasoned. I would also caution against the onion rings as some of the orders I saw around me were clearly burnt with black patches on the onion rings themselves. This is the first time I've ever seen burnt onion rings. I think the waffle fries were also on the very well-done side since they were very brown and hard (like a board), based on what I saw at other tables. The sweet potato fries looked okay, however. 

Service was okay and not particularly attentive, though in their defense, this place is very busy. We had to flag people down for more water and it took about 10 minutes before anyone came to take our order, even though we had closed our menus and were clearly looking around for a server.

I reserved a table for the nominal (relatively nominal - as it was much more expensive elsewhere) fee of $125 per person which bought us reserved seats, unlimited menu food, and an open bar that afforded us water, soda, well liquors, milk shakes and an impressive assortment of beers.  I thought this was a great idea until I did the math and came to find out that there was NO way I would eat or drink $125 worth of food within the 4 hour game window.  That being said, on to the review:

This is a stylized burger joint.  Two bars.  It offers 11 televisions and your choice of bar, booth or table seating.  

The Menu consists of Burgers (of course) and a wide variety of pupus.  We ordered BBQ nachos (by fair the best), curly fries, waffle fries, hot wings (these were NO joke, HOT as Hades), chili cheese fries, and an Asian salad.  Unfortunately we NEVER were able to order anything else.

The service, although pleasant, was MEDIOCRE at best.  I understand that they may have been overwhelmed at the sudden onslaught of orders, but damnit please bring my food in a timely manner.  Not only was it slow (45 minutes!), once we received the food there were 3 extra orders of wings, 1 additional nacho, 1 additional waffle fries and they tried to give us a BLT burger, too.  Crazy right?  With a table full of carbs (that we didn't order and that we could never finish), our waiter never once asked if we were ready for the protein portion of the meal.  Although our friend, who ordered the Asian salad, wretched after taking two bites and sent it back.  Sad really.

My wife enjoyed her two milkshakes ordered to cool off her mouth from the wings.  Mocha mudslide I think.

Even though the service was suspect, they STILL added on an automatic gratuity.  Are you f'n kidding me?

I had a few drinks but, I swear, after the second one, there wasn't a drop of alcohol in the rest.  Probably a good thing, maybe he was watching my back, NO IDEA.

My friends and I decided to order to-go from this place because we didn't have much time to eat before going out and this seemed like a reasonable place to go. 

The prices weren't too terrible. About $6-8 for burgers and $5 for customized shakes. Once placing our order, the cashier said that the order would take about 15 minutes to complete. I didn't think it was too long because they did have a dine-in option and I assumed it would be worth the wait. 

20 minutes go by... Nothing came out. ""It should be done in a few moments,"" the cashier said. I gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

25 minutes go by... Still nothing. ""The kitchen is almost ready with the order."" 25 minutes to make two burgers and French fries?

31 whopping minutes. I repeat, 31 whopping minutes before I received my order. I wish I had the energy to yell at this restaurant because no way in HELL is 31 minutes excusable. 

I work in a restaurant where we serve burgers and fries. Granted, our service is a lot faster because we are not necessarily ""fine dining,"" but in no way is 31 minutes even okay. It takes about 3-5 minutes to cook a burger patty with seasoning and close to 3-6 minutes for fries depending on the style of their fryer. 

Especially for a to-go option, to have 31 minutes before getting your order is completely ludicrous. I am so glad I did not decide to dine-in because I can only imagine how much longer it would've taken to get my food. 

To make matters worse, when I finally opened my bag I saw that the burgers were the size of SLIDERS!!! I waited 31 minutes to get 2 sliders and COLD fries?!? I have never been so disappointed by terrible service and terrible food in my entire life.

Similar to Holstein's in the Cosmopolitan, BLT Burger serves up a variety of specialty burgers and alcohol-infused shakes in a casual yet trendy atmosphere.  The menu also includes alternatives like salads and a variety of starters/appetizers (and desserts!), but let's be honest - the burgers and drinks are all you really need!

Although the menu offered more unique varieties (like the Lamb Tandoori burger),  I kept it simple with the BLT BURGER (Double Smoked Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato, and BLT Burger Sauce...$13), and added Monterey Jack Cheese (+$1.00) and a Fried Egg (+$1.50).  However, looking back on it now, I suspect my order was flipped with my friend's since I don't remember getting any lettuce or tomato in mine.  In any case, whatever burger I had was still pretty good (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=VZ1VhnLdQzaVWhnHd2tobA#15VvfHSg8YpS4B9oUo17dg).  It was cooked exactly as ordered, had a decent char, and it was still fairly moist (though not quite juicy).  The patty could have used a little more seasoning, but it was fine given the egg, cheese, and bacon (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=VZ1VhnLdQzaVWhnHd2tobA#B-HfvbJeqjSZWBJZed4ZqA).  I wasn't a big fan of the buns though.

Since the burgers don't include fries, our table decided to share orders of the ONION RINGS and the SWEET POTATO FRIES.  On both counts, they were fine, but not ""must try"" items either.  The Onion Rings were wrapped with a thick, crunchy batter (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=VZ1VhnLdQzaVWhnHd2tobA#LDHquMHWZfWsqRlFXtwBiQ), while the Sweet Potato Fries were nicely thin and crispy (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blt-burger-las-vegas?select=VZ1VhnLdQzaVWhnHd2tobA#Gc1m4O_xOmTixEkSIRBikA).

While I certainly wouldn't have a problem coming back to BLT Burger, I rounded down my THREE AND A HALF STARS if only because I'm not sure the value is there.  It's really not that expensive overall (especially for The Strip), but I'd rather go back to Holstein's since the fries are already included and their menu offerings are a bit more appealing.",JKIkdVqAJLEXTq92gF98bA,6,6,3,rfdkU3XZmS0FCsqMdfpgyA

Overall, it was an average meal for a pretty extravagant price and it didn't make my ""MUST GO WHEN IN VEGAS"" list.

The only reason why this place doesn't get one more star is because the customer service was pretty horrible.

We asked to sit at all separate tables as we didn't mind not sitting together and it was more important that we get in and out in a timely manner. Instead we were sat altogether.  Our server came over to greet us and we informed him we would need separate checks, to which he responded, ""It will take a lot longer to separate your checkout. It would be better if you could just all throw cash in."" ....um duh. If we could all throw in cash, we would. He continued to give us attitude and was rude throughout our entire meal. Now, the fried pickles and milkshake were amazing. But when our burgers came, the patties and fries were cold. Like cold cold.  Not even a couple warm bites or warm in the center. Because our food had taken so long already and all we wanted to do was leave, we kept our mouths shut, but under any other circumstances, we all would have sent out entrees back. Our checkout process was an absolute mess to boot. Hector was our server.  Maybe he had a bad day, and I don't mean to judge, but geez Louise he was a disaster of a server in all areas. If you're a hot mess, the least you could do is pretend to be accommodating and friendly.  Needless to say, not one member of our group will ever be returning, but I'm sure the place does well enough without us, considering most of their patrons are drunk and can't tell the difference.",Cp8xfCijg_DRUWXima73WQ,1,0,1,UM6PX2Fhe0m3JCrhD6LmNA

Blt is an attractive restaurant, but in the end it's just another formulaic place with decent food, created by an out-of-town, absentee, big-name New York chef in order to seperate tourists from their money.

A few notes:  The skinny fries are not skinny.  The beer list is lame.  Bbq nachos awful and unnecessary.  One of their appetizers is a waffle fry topped with cheese and runny, canned-tasting chili and a jarred jalepeno.  The pickle that accompanies the burgers has no flavor whatsoever.  It was apparently house-made, but had no snap and no flavor and was a flaccid, sad, bruised little afterthought of an attempt.

I love when you order a 15 dollar burger and the server asks if you ""want cheese"" on that.  Really?  Cheese is an upcharge?  Wow.

Wings were good.  Burger decent.  Service was okay.  I just felt duped and unsatisfied when I finished my meal.

2.5 stars I'll round down due to lack of imagination and inconsistent execution and insane prices.

Service 4/5 prompt and friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.

Personality 3/5 Has a nice vibe but is not a stand out when it comes to a unique characteristic that makes it stand out from the brew pub contenders in Las Vegas.

Quality 3/5 The Raspberry Mojito tasted more like a cranberry cocktail, and the Lamb Tandori burger tasted of nicely cooked lamb but was missing seasoning while the Shafts Blue Cheese burger was tasty but unevenly cooked ranging from medium on one side to rare on the other.  The milkshakes are awesome.

Recommendation. 3/5 I first went to this place over two years ago and have been 3 times since. It seems that the quality and consistency have dropped off.  If those are fixed it is worth the price if not, have a milkshake.",BZ5_Ldr9sgmQRrvrTBq_Mg,1,0,3,HU_k7sI2iycCrE_TIId8ng

The food came out pretty quickly and although they forgot to put avocado in my burger, it was still delicious.  The appetizers weren't too shabby either.

Turkey Burger with bacon and a fried egg. That's my GO TO burger at these customized burger places. Maybe throw some grilled onions on there too. This burger was a good sized meal. The turkey was somewhat overcooked. The flavors were there. Nothing overly spectacular.

Skinny Fries - They're regular sized fries but lower in calories most likely. They were decent.

BLT Burger opened in the Mirage hotel July 2008. Those of you familiar with the Mirage hotel, this is where Sigfried and Roy's White Tigers used to lounge around. Also right down the hall from the famous Carnegie Deli across from the new Starbucks.

I am a New Yorker. I live in New York City but truthfully I have not been to the BLT Burger in NYC so I got the chance this evening to have a quiet evening me with a nice juicy burger and a cold beer, decided to go to the BLT Burger.

BLT Burger is a very casual restaurant. People here come for the burgers, fries and shakes. Their Combo #2 is the most popular option which give you the ""Classic"" burger, fries and a shake for #19. If you opt for a draft beer instead then the Combo # 3 is for you for $22. There is a nice selection of draft beer available but only few bottle options.

I decided on the Lamb Tandoori burger (recommended and ordered medium but it came medium-well so consider when ordering) for $13 with waffles fries for $5 and an ice cold glass of Stella Artois for $7. If you consider this casual burger joint prices are not that budget friendly but you do get a great value for the quality of the food. I finished my meal with the Campfire Marshmallows Shake with marshmallows for $7. You also have the choice to spike up your shake with few options of shakes with liquors. It's the perfect place to have a quick, wallet friendly meal on your own or with friends. Also it's open late on Friday and Saturdays for those may want to grab a burger and a shake on the way back from their clubbing.

The portions are ENORMOUS.  The burger was meticulously put together and oh-so-delicious with mushrooms oozing with juice.  The blue cheese was a little bit strong and left a smell on your fingers afterwards, but the buns were toasted to perfection and the meat was perfect (recommended to be cooked medium).  My 5 spice salad was devilishly spicy!  Served in a seemingly endless bowl, I felt that even though I continued to dig into it, it was always still full.  I loved the crisps, but was not particularly drawn to the grilled chicken (in the dim lighting it seemed burnt).  The bf found it too spicy, but I enjoyed it a lot a lot a lot!

American Wagyu was just okay. When you see the words wagyu and truffle in the name and/or description, you can't help, but get excited to see how they executed the dish.

Buffalo Fries - I don't know why it's one of their specialties. It's just fries with bleu cheese and buffalo sauce on the side. It definitely doesn't warrant the price tag.
