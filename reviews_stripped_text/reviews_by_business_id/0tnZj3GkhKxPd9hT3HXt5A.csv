Well, I finally went in this morning for brunch and I was actually amazed at the '50's vibe in this place. It was pretty awesome! The music definitely went great with the vibe, too.

I went with the John Wayne burger and it was amazing. I think this is the same as the cowboy burger. Either way, I did enjoy it because it was not soaking in BBQ sauce like most places happen to over do it.

My girlfriend went with the Bye Bye Love Bananas Foster French Toast and she said it was ""SO DAMN GOOD"". Of course I did not just take her word for it; I went in for the dive and It was a warm gooey deliciousness!

This place smelled like smoke/very old. But give this place a try regardless!

It should feel like the cozy little hole in the wall where the floor isn't that clean and the booths are slightly broken, but the beer and liquor are well stocked and the characters are colorful.  Think dirty enough that T.G.I. Friday's managers would be disgusted, but safe enough that you're not getting a knife in your side when you sidle up to the bar.

And in Las Vegas, Huntridge Tavern is that bar.  I head here a lot during happy hour and find a collection of folks who are happy to be drinking--the clientele is usually a mix of folks just off work, folks down on their luck and smart ass regulars lined up along the bar talking to the bartender.  There's a lot of attitude is this bar.  Go with it and you'll have a good time.

And Huntridge follows through on the crucial requirement for a dive bar: cheap drinks.  Beer is $2-3 from the tap, liquor was pretty damn cheap (for a generous pour as well).  It's definitely my favorite hole in the wall in town.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,2,1,4,sfHfMcfi0xHZYLgtl2geNA

First visit I had the Huntridge Burger (with cheese, grilled onions and mushrooms, hold the steak sauce) he had the John Wayne Burger (cheese, barbecue sauce and onion rings) our sides of fries were requested and served extra crispy. We both had malteds: strawberry for me, chocolate for him, both ordered extra thick as some reviews said they were thin, they were delicious! 

Enjoying our meals enough to return, I had the Greek Salad, which was very good and quite a large portion; he had the John Wayne Burger and chocolate malted again. He lives in New York, where Kosher restaurants are plentiful, and enjoyed the Huntridge quite a bit, particularly at their reasonable price point. 

Definitely a fan, I'll return again for inexpensive and tasty veggie burgers, salads, and malteds.

They have a pretty decent soda bar menu with classics like the egg cream chocolate soda (no actual egg) or the chocolate cherry coke (you sensing a pattern here?) but by far my fav thing to get here is the Cowboy Burger. Meat is grilled to order and the cook is happy to personalize it any way you want things. I love mine with grilled mushrooms and onions, the onion rings just dont satisfy the onion lover within. Bread is basic but its a classic good formula of good portions and out of this world add ons like a real strawberry malt that make this place all comfort and no guilt. Well no guilt for me, Im pretty comfy in the corner of awesome and bombdiggity.
Prices are reasonable and the place is kept super clean. They're serious about running a Kosher kitchen but honestly that just means to me that they pay super close attention to food quality. Everythings always fresh and again you cant frown at a place that has specials for families in the area like $1 ice cream Wednesdays. I used to live around here and its nice when a burger joint caters to their neighbors.

We stopped in for a bite after getting cut next door at Hi-Rollers. HPSF is Drugstore/Pharmacy/Diner run by a couple of gentleman, and as you step inside, it is as if you went back in time to the 50's and 60's. It is very spacious with dining booths as well as counter dining if you wish to do so. 

Perusing the menu, it seems like a lot of choices on paper, but they seemed to be out of a few selections as we were inquiring on certain menu items and descriptions.
Wifey and I narrowed it down and we split a Cowboy Burger with a couple of shakes.
She got a Strawberry Shake and I went with the Watusi Whopper. FYI, all burgers, sandwiches, and items that are usually made with meat are not. Every item is vegetarian, and they use veggie meat from Morning Star.

The burger and fries were pretty good even though nothing is made in-house, and the shakes were not as thick as I prefer, but decent. Service was good, and price point is reasonable. Stop in if you're in the area and give these guys a try! ALOHA!!!

When I walked in, I was not expecting the food to be as amazing as it was! Especially since I'm a meat-lover but damn these guys can cook!

We ordered pizza fries, pancakes for the lil kid, the Huntridge burger, onion rings, and Mac and Cheese. My order was the Mac and cheese and I am in love. I think they ran out of macaroni pasta and substituted it for penne but I didn't care, it looked more fancier with penne lol. They topped the Mac and cheese with some crispy bread crumbs and paprika which was a nice touch. & actually when I got home I found that the Mac and cheese tasted even better than before (is that even possible!?).

Hubby ordered the pizza fries and that was bomb af too. Fries were a bit soggy but it was appropriate for the pizzaness. The onion rings were fresh and crunchy & we also ordered a chocolate milkshake. That milkshake was bomb af too and I'm not the biggest fan of sweet things. They use Thriftys ice cream which is probably why the milkshake was so good too :)

But somehow I missed a refurbishing and was surprised to see News channel 8 do a story on it. It looks like a 50's malt shop now, and has expanded about 15 people's worth if you've been in there before. 

You can see how it used to look like by looking at the floor. It's black and white tiled, but under the counter where they employees stand is the drab floor it used to be. And look at the ceiling tiles, you can see the cutoff from the restaurant to the pharmacy, the old faded yellow color used to be above the diner as well. Looks like it was stained from age and cigarettes. (Incidentally, it looks like original painting work on the back wall of the pharmacy.)

There were 2 guys working the restaurant: a cook/ cashier and a server/ busser/ cashier. After the news piece, I believe they weren't prepared for the rush we experienced when we were there. there were a lot of older people there, we were probably the youngest. But no one minded, this was an environment where people weren't jerks about planning their 20 minute break in a full service restaurant. People didn't mind waiting just out of wanting the ""reopening"" of the place to do well, economy and employment considered.

Some tables weren't bussed, in fact I wanted to help the guy and clean some up so more people could sit. Wonder if they'll add on a new person...

The best part was the food! They changed the menu, they used to have some Chinese food and the fried rice was my favorite. I hope they eventually bring that back. But they have burgers, Philly's, hot dogs, soda fountain, breakfasts. They don't appear to be open for dinner anymore, which was when I went the most. But I have spent some mornings regretting what I had done the night before my hangover over their breakfasts.

I had the Pizza Philly, which was EXCELLENT, light, crispy bread. We shared a fries and a choc shake, mmade with real ice cream. If they had a host/ cashier, they could be allocated to blending the desserts, too. (I worked at a Marie Callendar's long ago where that worked out fine.)

Oh, I got their take out menu *skimming*

They are open 8:00AM to 3:00PM, and even feature free wi-fi, which is interesting. The lady up front at the register for the Pharmacy couldn't even accept credit cards because they didn't have a phone line to connect their card reader machine to.

I noticed a lot of tug of wars between technology and vintage in this place. I hope they maintain the best of both. There are a lot fo companies that try to build a 50's place, but there are places here that HAVE stood the test of time and are still here, these Mom and Pop places I love going to.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,5,4,5,RfC17k40b2YvVCaivA0QTw

The bartenders are friendly and entertaining, and the working-class clientele is refreshingly unpretentious and relaxed.  

Warning: it is smoky as all get out in there, and smells like smoke even when it's empty! So if you're sensitive to that, don't go here.  

They have a great jukebox, random bar snacks, and an array of bar video games to entertain the drunkards.  I always seem to gravitate toward this place around 2-4 am because it's right on my way home from pretty much anywhere else.  

The Huntridge is open 24-hours, but if you feel the need to take the party elsewhere, you can always buy 6-packs or bottles of liquor to go!",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,2,1,4,7xzOPsHam0qpuh8sFC4uRw

I can only vouch for the burgers at this point, but they are truly outstanding, well seasoned, fresh beef, in the top 20% you will find anywhere. The fries and onion rings are good, but the burgers shine! Hand made shakes are available, but I have not tried one yet. The place is clean, plenty of old original features making for an authentic ""diner"" experience. Just a mile east of  Las Vegas Blvd, corner of Charleston and Maryland Pkwy., makes this an easy find for tourists who enjoy a little local downtown Las Vegas flavor. I hear the Philly cheese steaks are excellent too. Very limited hours, which have changed over the past several months, currently open till 4 p.m. Closed Sunday. One can search ""huntridge restaurant"" on youtube to get a feel of the place. It's a total 50's throwback tucked inside a pharmacy. Staff has always been friendly and attentive. Gotta love the free wi-fi too. A door through the pharmacy leads to a full bar.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,4,4,4,ms5u3NT-pxJusIOi6USx1w

The Elvis - Peanut Butter and Bananas, Grilled, with Onion Rings
Bye Bye Love Bananas Foster Pancakes - Sauteed Bananas, Walnuts, Caramel, Whipped Cream, Thrifty Vanilla Ice Cream

Closed on Saturdays in observation of Shabbat, and the sort of place I imagine to have changed little since opening in 1962, it was on a rare Sunday dining expedition that I finally visited Huntridge Soda Fountain - the sizable restaurant tucked inside Huntridge Pharmacy where several families already sat enjoying any numbers of shakes, sandwiches, and diner favorites offered at prices harkening an era long past.  Every bit a reminder of a Woolworth's back home in Ohio, with short-order cooks overseeing a menu of classics frequently tinged in whimsy, it was to a service team of one that I was greeted on entry and with a floor polisher whirring in the background as its driver weaved amidst aisles of toiletries, tablets, and even some toys a two-part order was crafted - the total bill less than $14 even after tax and tip for food that was served not only piping hot with a smile, but also surprisingly delicious despite its simplicity.  Admittedly a bit strained in service as my empty beverage languished it was with the $3.95 Elvis Sandwich that my meal began and although buttery Texas Toast surrounding ripe bananas plus ample peanut butter was as tasty as expected the basket of onion rings proved far less foolproof, the flavor of questionably fresh oil rendering the batter entirely off-putting - a $1.50 upcharge eliminated from my bill when I mentioned the issue to its cook.  Moving on to something far more decadent it was after only half of my sandwich had been consumed that the $5.95 stack of pancakes arrived and although impressive on their own with soft notes of buttermilk imbuing each bite it can only be said that the addition of bananas sautéed in butter represented a significant upgrade, the drizzle of caramel and mountain of whipped cream atop a generous scoop of ice cream and walnuts pushing the whole thing into dessert territory in the very best of ways.

Touting a menu far more interesting than several other local diners with prices that rival many chains for 'bargain' status Huntridge Pharmacy & Soda Fountain is a truly authentic experience in a city that many bemoan for being entirely too fake, the food far better than you'd expect given both the price and the locale.  Admittedly a bit lackluster in service given the skeleton staff, hand-written bills, and orders that occasionally back up when cooks are asked to prepare kosher options suffice it to say that the Soda Fountain is one of those spots everyone should visit at least once, and one that only stands to gain if and when the Huntridge Theater renovation finally takes place.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,7,3,tusg_raORdbWVntfJ_kocA

Even the butter they give you with the toast was delicious!  They gave me a mountain of hash browns!!  I couldn't finish it!!  Also, I put up a picture of the OJ served being only half way full, I must say that Joseph, the red bearded guy walked by and filled our glasses with OJ, so I stand corrected.  My plate was only $3.95!!!  Also, they didn't have banana's for the Elvis pancakes but that did not stop them!! They promptly sent someone to the grocery store to get some so we could have our meal!!  I must say I give them props for going out of their way to please their customers!!!  I wanted to try a milkshake but I was so full I couldn't have one.  

I would come back if I am in the area.  One of the best holes in the wall places!",xFTwjBMXHJwp8MSTUD-rlQ,2,1,5,xI-QqNI-Z6LK7GvQt6uq9Q

I do not keep kosher any more, but to me a restaurant should have good food kosher or not. First when we walk in I think this place could be a really special little place. But to be honest I really don't see it lasting very long as is. The location does not serve it well. And from the outside you would never know that there is a fun looking retro diner vibe going on. If they are going to rely on word of mouth among the Jewish Community and think that will bring in enough people to sustain the business then they need to do some serious re-evaluating. This place is Kosher, but if the owners want this place to last the menu and food should be a place anyone regardless of being Jewish or not would want to eat there. But to be honest, the food would need to be elevated quite a bit along with the menu. I had the tuna sandwich. Basically it was tuna swimming in mayo. The bread was kind of stale, and with all that mayo it was hard to taste any tuna. My grandson asked for something and they didn't have it, so he made his second choice and they didn't have that either. As I said the place has a cool vibe with record vinyl  up on the walls with the record jackets. But no music playing in the background. It's Sunday, around 10 and the place is dead, we are the only 5 people in the place. The place should be packed. But with mediocre food at best and a basic boring menu along with no signage to attract you I think it's days are numbered.",JEDRhFdrscbsWierJA0-jQ,0,0,2,GeVaJtn5XHJvLC5xJIWxrg

My secretary/friend was recently promoted so we decided to take her here for a goodbye lunch since she is a devout vegan. When we walked in I wasn't sure if we were at the right place as it smelled kinda smoky and dingy but then I saw this cute little diner mimicking the 1950's. We were the only three people dining in the restaurant and ""William"" took such good care of us. I wasn't super hungry as I had eaten a late breakfast but my friend had the Caesars chik wrap with fries and then I split a pizza with my other friend. We all really enjoyed our lunch. I think the main reason was the great customer service provided by William and how welcome we felt at this establishment. I had read some other reviews by fellow yelpers and most gave a four/five star rating so I  thought why not, we could give this place a try which I am glad we did.  If you are in the neighborhood, stop by and check this place out and I hope William is working as he is a da bomb!",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,1,1,4,jcPNDUGTF9R1Il4C_BUp3w
