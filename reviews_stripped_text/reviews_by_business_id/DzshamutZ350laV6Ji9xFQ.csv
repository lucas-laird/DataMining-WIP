It's pretty much like a go to place where you miss home (Philippines) and you want to taste authentic Filipino food, feel the Pinoy vibe, chill eat some awesome Lechon, this is the spot right here! So, when cafe de cebu reopened their store by Jones (which is great btw, because they have a bigger place and space for some dancing and open mic nights), we went here two nights in a row!! Friday and Saturday night!! Flipside5 band was rocking the house yo!! Great ambiance!! Art works were nice. Wish it was more on the Filipino side. But all in all, our experience was wonderful and definitely out new hang out spot for some Pinoy vibe! Thumbs up! And did I mention they have bomb ass food?? Haha! Come and chill at Cafe de Cebu!

Never in my life that I got refuse as a customer to eat in a restaurant because ""they don't have anyone to cook the food"". Unfortunately, the cook was on break and no one can cook our food! Seriously???!!! 
Maybe next time they will ask you to get the food in the kitchen because they don'thave a server!!! Too bad i have to put at least 1 star! I would rather give this place a 0 star!!!!",zy8ns6YFgOu0ure9sJOiew,2,0,1,f_N7xaakLSy12Yvf9CpfLQ

My parents cook Filipino food ten times better. I've never had Cebuano food before, and I'm probably not going to try it again.

We ordered the whole belly.All 10 lbs if it. It was huge. There was 11 of us .We were not able to finish it, maybe because we also ordered the milkfish, the sinigang broth, the chicharon bulaklak. Everything tasted good although it lacked the signature taste that will define them from the rest of the businesses.That is why I am inly rating it 4 stars. If they add some twist to it, they could be a 5. The ube cheesecake was a first for me and it was good.The calamansi juice was perfect for the hot Vegas weather",BO3nQv-wja42r63HIjscRA,0,1,4,3KKn0LRnUzpclYYEgxkY9Q

We also ordered lechon and as usual they serve it with their homemade liver sauce. It was so flavorful,we don't need to go to Philippines just to have this taste of Cebu. They have a lot of specials posted on their board and can't wait to try them all. I hope it isnt too late when I come back for their specials. For dessert, ube cheesecake is the best and halo-halo is worth the price a lot of ingredients are put into it with ube ice cream .",qU97oiEYcvwwOzh2tPHqfw,1,1,5,9rG_6D3qYXFQSq_SFbSoSw

249661,2017-03-09,0,DzshamutZ350laV6Ji9xFQ,"Very disappointed! This is our second visit to Cafe de Cebu. First was in the old place and this is our first on this location. 

This place is a 100 degrees turn around from the first location. The kitchen is in front left side as you get in the eating area , and as soon as you go in you can smell what's being prepared in the kitchen. When we get into the restaurant , I smelled an uncooked smelly pig smell. It smelled ' MALANSA' in Tagalog !  Eww and in that moment my appetite just went down from 100 to ZeRo..

There's a band equipment in the front and we were told later that they now have  karaoke at night! In the middle of the room in front of the band is a  seating area made of wood pallets and the seats are padded, but still didn't impress me. The eating tables lined up against the wall and the bench are so hard and uncomfortable to sit on. Whoever designed it should be fired !

Now let's discuss about the food! We ordered the lechon belly;  this is the reason we came back to Cafe this Cebu, because when we first tasted it at the first location , we fall in love with it. It was crispy and sizzling hot. This time, it was at room temperature and the skin was leathery. We ordered a 1/2 pound which cost $8.00, not worthed at all . We were very disappointed. We also ordered Pinakbet worth $7.00/order. When our order was served, my hubby and I looked at each other and I said 'That's it?' Lol. Very poor presentation on both dishes.

To sum it up, Big disappointment! We'll not come back and not recommended at all! Sorry but not sorry!",xIKAjit6Sh_-9pmcQkKjJQ,6,0,1,mCxiPlZBdJgisRI1IybkMQ
330702,2017-05-15,1,DzshamutZ350laV6Ji9xFQ,Had a terrible experience here. Will probably never come back. It seems they want to offer the same poor quality service and food as if they were still in the Philippines. The seating is terrible. It was hot inside as if they couldn't afford to turn on the air conditioner. The food took forever to arrive at the table. And there were several things on the menu that were just not available at all. We were 1 of about 3 tables dining at that time but the service was so slow. I'm not sure what image they are trying to go for but it's not good. The old location was so much better.,beJUC85ZILKuwOB4rofy6A,0,0,1,9i26ruqmxHp7bNPELZFDbA

I am not surprised that this business got bigger and better. I always come to them for my Filipino food cravings. The dishes are always on point and by far one of the better places to go for Filipino Cuisine in Las Vegas.

I am a fan of their Lechon, consistently crispy and yummy. The Bagoong Rice is another winner and the Isaw is something I always order. I try to order something new everytime I visit and my family enjoys coming here with me.

Doj is great! Very friendly and we love his customer service. Always a pleasure to talk to and recommends the best dishes to order.

They immediately stopped the karaoke singing and music minutes before they arrive and the time when they are having dinner. The reason , Aegis group is tired with the recent performance.

We have a reservation for 8 adults; friends from San Diego. My sister and I was there 1/2 an hour early noticed some 4 tables with guest got seated, in about 30 min the waitress came and ask if we need something to drink, I ordered hot tea and sister ordered mango juice which is NOT available, water then is fine. My tea was served later in a coffee mug, no sugar or honey or any sweetener so I ask for sugar, about 20 min later she gave me sugar in a small cup. We read the menu and most of them are all marked with black marker, NO LONGER AVAILABLE. The famous lechon is NOT AVAILABLE UNTIL 9:30 PM! reason: we RUN OUT earlier! We ordered as if we haven't eaten for weeks, almost everything on the menu. Good thing!!!! because their family size is not even enough for a single hungry Filipino on a diet!! I thought we are in a tapas place where servings are all appetizer size. I am not a good cook but I can tell when a Filipino food is good, and the food came lukewarm almost cold!!!

The egg rolls I had were not even cooked on the inside and just tasted like it was bought from the frozen section of an asian store.

Seriously tho ~must try~ Anyway, I'm usually skeptical when it comes to Filipino restaurants simply because there are so many styles to cook the dishes depending on the different Filipino provinces/islands, also because most Filipino restaurants tend to be more on the oily side as well as on your he pricier end too. Well, Casa de Cebu is great. They relocated from their Flamingo location and this location is so nicely put together! The interior design and beautiful and they do occasional live performances and they have a nice lounge-y area in the middle of the restaurant for that. 

In my opinion, this new location is much better, but the service in the original location was better before. I've been to the old location twice and the owner and the servers they had seemed much more happier and kind to customers whereas I've been to this new location 3 times because the Kare Kare just doesn't compare to anywhere else, but each time I've had this one lady seat and serve us and each time she just didn't really care, nor smile... yannoe basic customer service. So eh kinda takes away from the experience so that's why I knocked a star out. Otherwise it's a pretty solid Filipino joint!

Nearby tables had not been cleaned. It was as hot inside as it was outside. 4 different menu items were not available. They only had sprite and Diet Coke. Our food took so long too. We ordered lechon sisig and Bicol express, and this was after we were told that 4 different menu items weren't available. Me and my fiancé could only hope that the food was amazing. Unfortunately it wasn't. 

Ordered ngohiong for appetizers. It was very bland. The server hands me a small cup that was stained and wet. I kind of stared at it for a while wondering if it was dirty. I didn't want to be difficult, I seriously thought she gave me a dirty cup.  She also suggested to use vinegar. So I didn't bother asking for ngohiong sauce - which isn't vinegar by the way. At this time I just wanted to eat and didn't care for a good dining experience.

The lechon sisig which was recommended by the server wasn't hot nor warm. You'd think it would be sizzling if it was on a sizzling plate.  Bicol express wasn't great.

The Lechon belly meat also lacked the crispy skin and it was seasoned with star anise, or some type of Chinese 5 spice. The Mang Thomas sauce was a sad grey colored mess that tasted as such.
The Pinakbet was very soupy; no bitter melon, squash, or meat or shrimp. Just green snap beans and eggplant. The green snap beans were crisp.

Came here for lunch, got seated immediately. 
The interior had industrial touches combined with natural wood. It is a casual and clean restaurant.
My friend ordered the nghiong (the reason why we came here.)
Our server came back saying they ran out. Oookaaay?!
We moved on to ordering the next favorite veggie dish on the menu, then the server came back telling us they run out of the veggie dish. Oookaaay?! This is not looking good. So we opted for another dish. 
My friend and I were looking at each other hoping that the rest of the dishes we ordered will be amazing and driving here from Henderson was worth our time.

Our server started bringing in the food and we definitely had a little feast on our table.
The chicken tinola soup was a little salty but the chicken was tender and cooked perfectly.
The Cebu Lechon tasted amazing, my friend who ordered chicharon bulaklak was having a blast! It tasted crunchy and barely greasy.
I could have rated this place a 5 star, but running out of favorite dishes on the menu is not an excuse for not having them on a weekend.
There's a lot of popular and favorite Cebuano dishes that could have been added to the menu.
The menu has limited choices.

3877829,2016-12-27,0,DzshamutZ350laV6Ji9xFQ,"Before anything else, let me just say that this review is mainly for the bad service and not the quality of the food.  The lechon was superb and it exceeded our expectations. However, the lack of courtesy on their end was so disappointing and unprofessional that I am forced to give them a 1-star review.

My friend pre-ordered a lechon and informed them that we would pick it up on Dec 24, 6pm. That morning, my friend called a couple of times to make sure that the order would be ready by dinner time. Since no one was picking up, we decided to stop by around 4 just to check if they were open. The lady said that it was not yet ready and advised us to come back at 6. 

When we got back, they said the oven was not working and they made us wait for another 2hrs without really telling us what time our order would be ready. We kept asking her to give us an estimate  and she never gave us a straight answer. Instead, she kept walking away to call the owner. She also gave us a lot of attitude and kept asking if our order was intended for dinner (6pm) or noche buena (12mn), so we got the feeling that they probably forgot our order. Finally, when we spoke with Roy, he asked us if we wanted to change our order to something else. Obviously, we came for the lechon so we said no and told him it was embarrassing for us to go to our friend's potluck EMPTY HANDED. Only then did he offer to give us free BBQ (which we really appreciated btw) and said that they would deliver the order to our friend's house in about an hour. We got Roy's number so we could get an update from him, but he never picked up our calls. He just sent us an ETA that was actually 45mins late. 

The owner arrived with our order around 10pm, but it seemed like he was in a hurry and gave us the most insincere apology.  Mind you, it took them 4hrs to deliver the food---which is approximately how long it would take to roast a lechon, so you do the math.

As we were getting our food, we noticed that the trays were already over half empty. There was only spaghetti which had one spoonful left in the tray, pancit, bbq, rice, and chopsuey on the table. Our first thoughts were maybe, our friend chose the most least expensive package as we all know cafe de cebu can be expensive. The staff failed to even refill the food trays promptly. They brought out a small basket of lechon twice which was enough to serve about 6 people. So anyway, as the party progressed, we found out that my friend was charged $4,200 for 76 people on this 3 hour party. I was flabbergasted! Honestly, the quality, selection, and the size of the food entrees served to us would not even be worth $1k. They served us egg rolls towards the end, small servings of cold lechon, spaghetti, chix/beef bbq, rice, pansit, chopsuey, and turon for dessert. Really???!! Even Nanay Gloria's $140 package is more food than that! Taking in consideration you had to close your restaurant for 3 hours to accommodate this party, it was still way overpriced!

As with most Filipino restaurants, it's best to come with a group because portions are large and you want to try different things.  I was looking forward to the lechon but when I saw that the smallest portion was 8 ounces, I decided to hold off on that until I come with a family who adopts me or a group of friends.

Instead of eating too much, I opted for a small starter of Ngo-yong, deep freind palm heart flavored with Chinese 5 spice powder.  There was a dipping sauce served with it that had the wonderful five spice flavors.  A very good start and a smaller starter.

For the main course, I got the kare-kare.  The beef in this traditional Filipino stew was tasty and came off the bone easily and the ""gravy"" of the stew was very good especially when mixed with some of the shrimp paste served with the stew.  

For dessert, I went with the turon with ice cream.  Two small banana filled, fried spring rolls with the yam ice cream.  It was a good ending to the meal.

Service was very good and the young woman answered all my questions.  With the tab;e set up being like family picnic tables, I wouldn't come back solo during busy times and I think I'd avoid evenings when there's music.

He tried the lechon and lumpia but wouldn't even touch the other stuff.  

The lechon was fatty and not good.  We also ordered a kind of sweet style adobo which turned out to be overcooked tough chunks of pork in a bowl of colored water.  We also ordered dinuguan - the worst we've ever had.

Ok so our drink (finally) and food got served.
We had Tinolang Manok first, it was really oily that the only taste I could distinguish was the oil. The chicken was really fatty which made the soup a lot more oily.

The lechon belly came with the garlic rice and Laing. The lechon belly was dry, cold, and the skin was burnt. I like lechon so much and I've tried the original lechon belly from Cebu. However, after having tried this place, I think this is the worst place for lechon. You're better off making your own roasted pork to be honest. The lechon we got served were just all fat! My mouth was extremely oily! 

Then the Laing was decent. But the rice! OMG! It was garlic salt and SOY SAUCE! It was like eating rice with soy sauce. Horrible!

Finally we tried the Turon. The banana was unripe and all I could taste in my mouth was the sap. If you're looking for a nice place with good food this is NOT THE PLACE TO GO! Rather, go eat at a Filipino grocery store, you'll probably get a better quality from there!

Dining with someone from PI whose dad's hometown is Cebu,  our expectations were high, and Cafe Cebu delivered. 

A word of Filipino food wisdom for those Yelpers who have not been to PI or are used to places like Goldie Locks... This is authentic Filipino food and is not white washed. The sauces are homemade and the food is not washed out to accommodate the American palate. That's what makes this restaurant so special! 

1.) Milk Fish Sisig: Fried milk fish is a staple of Filipino food. This dish was made to perfection. You cannot eat here and not try it!


2.) Lechon Pork Belly: the lechon sauce is made from scratch. I've never had sauce made this way except at home. The lechon is tender and the skin is crispy and delicate. It practically melts in your mouth. 

3.) Kare Kare: One of the best I've ever had 

4.) Adobo Fried Rice: The serving is very generous. The adobo is tender and the fried rice is made perfectly. Even though it already has egg in it, I added an over easy egg on top. Perfection!

5.) Ube Cheesecake & Buko Pandan: Try them both. The buko is perfection in a glass and the Ube Cheesecake is like non other you've ever had...there's a special surprise on the bottom.

Guys, order the isaw!! Its the best thing next to the boneless lechon! Ugh. The isaw is prepared on skewers and its lathered with sweet BBQ sauce and it cooked with a crisp. 3 skewers and a cup of rice for $7.99.

The lechon is different from what you're use to compared to all other Filipino joints. This ones better and you'll just have to trust me on that. Haha. 1/2 pound is $8.00.

Aileen was nothing but helpful. Wonderful customer service and you can tell she was way excited about the grand opening. She told me a lot on Cafe De Cebu's plans and I'm way excited! 

They will be open for lunch tomorrow for the grand opening then at 8pm there will be live entertainment.

What I love about this new spot is that you now have space for multiple families when eating here. You know Filipino's and their outings! Also, they do have Red Horse beers and San Miguel light. So you know y'all can drink! Haha. 


Try it out and I promise you won't be disappointed!

4962911,2017-03-08,1,DzshamutZ350laV6Ji9xFQ,"When I was out in Vegas my friend wanted to go have some authentic Filipino food! Our co worker suggested to go to this place since it just opened!

From the moment we walked in I loved what I saw. It looked like their furniture was hand crafted by a really good designer. They had a lounge area made of pallet wood and their lighting was made of mason jars. So very original and tasteful. 

Our party had five adults and 3 kids in our party. The hosts was very accommodating to the kids. Which was nice. 

Now on to the food! I am very picky when it comes to Filipino food because my family cooks really good, and I was craving some really good authentic Filipino food. We probably ordered everything on their menu! They had alot of really good choices! They even had pork intestines, talk about authentic, lol I didn't try the pork intestines but my friends who did said it was a bit crunchy and hard. But they still enjoyed it.  The kare kare was a bit on the sweet side for my taste, still good, just too sweet, I wanted to taste more peanut butter. 

My favorite thing would probably be the sisig, singing and bagooang fried rice! Both were amazing!!!! 

The food portions were a really good size for the price as well!

They had great Filipino background music playing and also offered kareoke. They also have a live band playing almost every night, which I thought was awesome! 

I would've given them 5 stars but the service was a bit slow. Don't get me wrong they were super duper nice!!! I just think they need more help. It was one girl taking care of the whole restaurant. Other than that I love this place and will definitely go back when I'm in Vegas!",-YOWfjjosuaxfsh8kSpiVA,1,0,4,9YYcIhnNHnCVMQ2aQ7S0fw

OK, that's all I know.  I've half jokingly asked a very good friend to be my guide in the Philippines only to be told, ""enjoy yourself.  It's hot.  There's no air conditioning.  They don't have electricity all day"".  That said, I blame him for my lack of knowledge on Filipino cuisine.  JK.  Though, ever been to a restaurant and had no idea what anything is?

With zero street cred other than watching Anthony Bourdain's single No Reservations Philippines episode, here goes.

Cool dining space.  The lounge is actually made from recycled shipping palates.  

The lechon, boneless pork belly rolled and roasted (not deep fried).  Golden skin, uber crispy with juicy, fatty sweet pork inside.  Good eats for sure.  Digging in with your fingers makes it taste that much better.   Minor observation, shouldn't this have been roasted over an open fire to maintain authenticity and add the smoky bitterness?

Kare-Kare was intriguing.  A stick to the ribs stew.  Well braised oxtail, its melting cartilage creating a gelatin packed broth, with peanut butter.  Savory, rich, and earthy and good eats.

Grilled boneless Bangus (milkfish) is definitely a fish lovers fish.  The fish has flavor.  There is a fatty richness around the belly and a ""fishy"" flavor throughout that is enhanced by grilling. 

Ginataang Kuhol (freshwater river snails cooked in coconut milk) is interesting.  Obviously from frozen, the snails are slightly tough.  Unlike saltwater shells, these have a slight muddy, bitter vegetal finish that is toned down by the garlic, onions and coconut milk.

And then, Isaw BBQ.  It looks great.  Beautiful caramelized BBQ sauce on pork INTESTINES.  No, no, 1000x no.  Fatty, chewy, like well cooked tripe BUT the taste.  Barnyardy?  Screw that.  It taste literally like what comes out of the backside of an animal.

Follow up the Isaw with Chicharon Bulalak.  This isn't deep fried pork skin, rather deep fried intestines.  Unpalatable due to the overwhelming smell.

Service is very friendly and welcoming. 

A meal that is a journey to a foreign land.  Highs far outweigh the lows and the unusual is just part of the experience.  Truly one that beckons you to return.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,24,23,4,AUUiqQ1wl9-yMq8ZMYN00A

5604020,2016-10-07,1,DzshamutZ350laV6Ji9xFQ,"It was the first time my family and I tried this Filipino restaurant. We were craving for some lechon and so have decided to try it. First off, this place is not suitable for a nice family meal time because it was too loud in there due to their karaoke feature. You cannot have any decent conversation in there. Next is the food. We ordered the lechon belly and it's really disappointing because there's only 3 small pieces of the pork skin, which were not crispy at all and a lot of fats...I would say that sure porkbelly has naturally a lot of fats in it, but the part that was given to us was the one with thickest fat with only a thin layer of edible meat. Then came the bulalo, which was the worst one I've ever had. FYI, bulalo is suppose to be beef shanks and not oxtail. The bulalo came with two sad pieces of oxtail, along with two sadder pieces of baby bokchoy and plenty of soup with most likely powdered seasonings, just like the ones you put in instant noodles. I think it's overpriced, amounting to like $6 per piece of oxtail. The lumpiang shanghai was good enough, but who could mess that up? The greenbeans is fine too, which I think is the best one among our ordered food. We also ordered the halohalo, which was good. We were was also very disappointed by their burnt turon, which was quite bitter to the taste, with the banana inside still a little raw. The waitress that we had also doesn't know that much about the food they're serving. She served us the bulalo and didn't give us rice with it, not until I asked for one. The food here is overpriced, for the quality that we had. We ended up paying $70 for these subpar meal. We surely regret coming here.

I found out that some of the realtives of the host did not eat just so that others could. Really? Is that how you satisfy your customers? You should be ashamed if yourself for thinking that you did a great job. I only wish that Yelp had an option for 0 stars, because 1 star is too high for the service we received.",Zb0fUCk5EizyN4shEgu6IA,2,0,1,06ntfabIBtk05uUDod42Bw
