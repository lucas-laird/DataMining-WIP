I have visited a few Central American countries, but lived in Honduras. So with my Honduran adapted taste buds, I was not impressed. Perhaps it is more Nicaraguan? I couldn't figure it out, the menu is sectioned out by country, with a bit of overlap. Best advise? If you are looking for pupusas, head to an El Salvadoran restaurant. Baleada? Head to a Honduran- and so on. This might be your restaurant if you are looking for Nicaraguan food, but I am not 100% on that.",iZAAjkPZ0sopzfajcfdOUg,0,0,2,EkOT7kge1D0-qHOowSRfJg

1112926,2014-03-02,3,5t9kTG9DakuamJgY65HA7w,"Here with this place you get a 3-for-1 kind of venue which consists of a restaurant and karaoke on one side and a nightclub on the opposite side. The nightclub has a fully stocked bar so have at it. 
If you're in the mood for hookah, well you can get one here for around $25. You're feeling hungry? Go ahead place your order.
Now, the nightclub really gets going around midnight and it's very much happening. I've gone only on nights when the nightclub is open and had a blast. Inside you'll see couples, some cougars on the prowl and your young chica hottie that belongs in a centerfold of a magazine.
No, it's not a fancy club like the megaclubs you'll find on the Strip with all the extra bells and whistles. It's just a cool local latin hangout to kick it for a few hours.

There are two DJs and they take turns back and forth playing different types of Latin music to appease the taste of everyone in the crowd (salsa,merengue,bachata,raggeton) It has a small dance floor with tables surrounding it but you can manage a few moves. The DJs are pretty cool, they keep the party going till around 5am.

The staff from the bartenders, waitresses and bouncers hold their own. Professional and quick, especially the bouncers standing outside, don't expect to wait in line to get in, you get to the entrance, they pad you down and in you go. Best of all, admission is free. Once inside, you can come in and out of the club to have a smoke or catch a breather from all the craziness happening inside. The one thing that has been added is valet parking, it's not needed and totally pointless. It's coming off as a little bit pretentious.

Check out the karaoke if you feel like letting out your inner Pop Star then later hit the dance floor. It's low key but would suggest guys wear a nice suit or a blazer, you never know if ""Ms. Right Now"" will be in attendance! So check it out.",SvkOt67Q4pOw2oviK_13og,7,3,3,iyXh5yYDfIOEADvzdRxHCw

I let her know that I was charged for 2 and was expecting 2 as my confirmation receipt shows, she said for the inconvenience I can pick up a new order. I let her know that I was unable to pick up, hence why I utilized Uber Eats, she was totally unapologetic, didn't even offer to reimburse me for their mistake, just said ""We can't deliver the food you can pick it up""

Have wanted to try it for a long time, it's so cute from the outside and lit up so pretty at night.  3 cars in the parking lot should have been our first clue, on a Friday, at dinner time.  Still wanted to try it... walked in, the restaurant is huge on the inside, yet we were the ONLY customers.  We were seated and ordered our usual, iced tea, no lemon. Ice tea delivered, with LIME.   Arghhhh!!!  I know this is a bit soon in the review, but the taste was intolerable, disgusting... not drinkable.... had nothing to do with the lime, I love lime, it just tasted rotten.

The complimentary chips and salsa were good, have had better salsa but okay.  Chips disappeared quickly and still had nothing we could drink. Waitress was not within eyesight and was not attentive toward her only 1 table to serve in the entire restaurant.

She finally returned and we told her about the iced tea and she seemed to just smile a lot and shake her head, we were finally able to communicate, ""bottled water, please"".

We ordered vegetable fajitas and queso fundito.  The queso, average tasting with an over abundance of grease, my husband is a queso fundito expert... he was NOT impressed.  The fajitas, ZERO flavor, there is nothing else I can say.

After a brief conversation, we decided to get up and leave, we went to the counter to pay, the waitress approached us and we explained or dissatisfaction with our meal.  Surprise... not only did she not speak English, there was nobody in the entire restaurant that could speak English.  Luckily there was a customer at the counter picking up a take out order, and was kind enough to explain and interpret our position to the waitress... he told us that she said we only had to pay for our drinks, we insisted that we pay, she insisted ""NO"".... we insisted that we at least pay half the bill and she took it.
