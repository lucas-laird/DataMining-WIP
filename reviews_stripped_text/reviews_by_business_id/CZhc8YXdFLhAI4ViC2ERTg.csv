The chips and salsa are good and they also serve some bean dip for the chips.  It a took a little longer than anticipated to get my beer order. 

On this occasion, I ate the Carne Asada.  It could have used a little more flavor but in their defense, they also offer different versions of the Carne Asada with different flavor combinations. I went with the traditional.

I'm very picky when it comes to Mexican food, so a 4 1/2 star rating means this place is legit.  The service is above average.  You can't go wrong here.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,0,0,4,DuzdzOqJu1fJ7m8KkahkUg

Today I went and got a combo 2 tostadas for my son who does not eat much just been and cheese $15.95 for BEAN AND CHEESE..... I called Juan's Flaming Fajitas & Cantina and they charge $12 which I believe is still a lot but much better than $15.95 AND I could hear a Mariachi band in the back ground...

We have been coming here since they opened at this location.  Really enjoy the service, the food and the margaritas.
Today was a completely different experience.
Service was not there at all from our server.  Supporting staff was great, server could have cared less.  He actually brought dessert while we were still eating our entrees.  I know it's complementary, but there is a correct way of doing things.  If I would have been by myself, he wouldn't have gotten more than ten percent tip.
Now for my food.  These were hands down the worst carnitas I have ever eaten in my life. No, not exaggerating.  For $18.95, not ever again!  There couldn't have been more than three ounces of dried, tough pork butt on my plate.  My kid ordered the same and he hardly touched his.

This is the best Mexican food in Vegas.  I really can't say I've had better Mexican food anywhere.  Do yourself a favor and go....even if it is a drive.  We live in Centennial hills and make the drive any time we want Mexican food.  There is a movie theater in the same shopping center so a great one stop for dinner and a movie.  The service is always great.  Anything with shredded beef is amazing and they have the best nachos on the planet.  I'm a creature of habit and mostly get the same thing, but everyone we take there loves it...regardless of what they order.

The waiters and staff are always very nice and quick.  Several have been there for a very long time.  Our cups are rarely empty, as anyone going by will fill it up if they see it empty.  They usually bring out a small dessert for free - which is always a nice treat for the kids.

We were seated as soon as we walked in. The menu here is huge! I have to be honest, I was a little overwhelmed with how many choices there were. We both placed our order and I swear five minutes later, the food was at the table. 
 Both of us ordered the one item combination plates. My wife had the chicken enchilada and I had the carne asada burrito. Combination plates come with your standard fare, rice, re-fried beans and a tiny salad. One thing that wasn't standard, at least not to my knowledge, was the bowl of fideo soup that accompanies your meal. All of the side were good. I especially liked that the beans were not greasy! The burrito was tasty. My only complaint if you will, was that I felt the tortilla that was used might have been a little thin. More along the lines of an enchilada rather than a burrito. The carne asada was cooked well and was flavorful. 
 I could see myself coming back. Preferably when I have more time to look over the menu and try something else besides a combo plate. For now, I will rate this as a three star visit. The service was good. The interior was colorful and lively. So if you are in the area, give this classic restaurant at it's new location a try!",oSE7FyiHO3l4w29NaqHjiw,1,0,3,P4hzBvW6NpW7m7ToBIptuA

It is my Dad's favorite restaurant so they were very excited when they opened up at this location on Sahara.  The atmosphere is great, good service and everyone was super friendly.  The menu is very extensive and it was hard to decide what to get.  I ordered the same thing as my dad which was the three item combination.  I got a cheese enchilada, chili relleno and a chorizo hard shell taco.  
Okay, can I just say how happy I was with everything?  The chorizo taco was delicious, not greasy, perfectly flavored and well seasoned.  The chili relleno was the star.  It was not overly breaded, but just right and the enchilada was great as well.  My sister got the Enchiladas Suiza and they were delicious.  The sauce on them was perfectly garlicy.
The only thing is that the restaurant is located in the same center as the Regal Cinemas but across the parking lot.  It is a little difficult to see in the shopping center, but it has a big red umbrella in front of it.  They are located in the southwest corner of the center.

Unfortunately on our last few visits the service has been terrible. Tonight we sat at the bar area and our bartender asked us what we wanted without offering us menus. He eventually offered up the happy hour menu, but when we said we wanted to order off the regular menu he just stared blankly at us. My girlfriend had to order from memory and I asked him to go get a menu. I very clearly ordered a shrimp entree and pointed to it on the menu. Both of our entrees came with soup but it didn't get served and we had to ask for it. Then when the entrees arrived, mine was wrong. It was beef and not shrimp. No apologies from the bartender. And while offering to refill beers for the couple next to us, no one asked my girlfriend if she wanted another beer. Overall, this is extremely disappointing. I work in the service industry and rarely ever complain because mistakes happen, but this is becoming a common experience at Viva's.

I kindly appreciate your feedback. The beer that took so long was the first.  The question about temperature that I had is because I don't understand why the rice didn't come out warm nor hot. The salsa that was brought out initially was not good, our server brought out a salsa level 5 which then... I said tasted like my moms. 

I did take the albondiga soup home and it was not good at all.  The A grade was not visible Sir but I will not question you as the information is online on SNHD.

Another thing is that I nor my family drink ice tea nor water that sits on a server station because of our industry. So why would my husband want to drink ""Diluted"" mountain dew. That is where the comment came from.

I know Mexican food as my father is from Durango and my mother is from Chihuahua. I accept that nothing will be like home cooking but please don't make it sound like this is authentic.  I wish as a business owner you would consider taking constructive criticism and better the issues that your patrons make instead of defending yourself.",n__pv31sBiYtuNqkanlPsw,3,2,1,I3A_KE5NCDcBJsbypFdUrQ

I went into this restaurant on a whim for lunch because I was in the area. They gave me a menu with fairly expensive items so I asked for the lunch specials and was told that was the lunch menu! 
Not wanting to take out a 2nd mortgage, I just ordered some albondigas soup (my favorite).  The menu said it was $5.95 for a bowl which is actually one of the few reasonably priced items on the menu. It took some time to be brought out even though there were only a few customers in the place. To be honest, I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because of the soup. It was fresh and delicious. probably one of the best I've had. It's when I got the bill that the problem began. I checked my bill to pay and noticed that the price of the soup on the bill was $6.95, a dollar more than the menu stated. I asked to see the menu again just to make sure. I called the hostess over and pointed out the mistake. It took almost 15 minutes to come back with a new bill. This bill was computer generated which means the price in the system is wrong.

Love the food, ambiance and service.  We stopped in late Friday night, and enjoyed a wonderful meal and terrific service.   The menu has so many items, I can't wait to get back and try more.  This time we ordered our ""standards"" to see how this place stacked up against others we frequent.  It is the BEST!  Hubby had the carne asada burrito -they make it just they way he likes it - with pico inside.  I had the comb shredded beef taco and chile relleno, very tasty. Each dish came with rice and beans, and Fideo soup.  All items were so tasty, and not at all heavy.  Of course the chips and salsa and bean dip were also excellent and plentiful.  
What really made this meal was the service and the hospitality.  Yes, it was late and abit slow so there was time for the extras, but our waiter was so friendly and quick and even brought us a nice little dessert - very yummy fried flour chips with chocolate sauce and carmel drizzle and whipped cream - on the house.  The manager, came by to ask how everything was and both of them asked us to come back.  They WANTED and ASKED for our repeat business!  Refreshing!!!  We will be back - SOON, and I am sure often - how we missed this great place just down the street I do not know.

Note:  This was the first of two ""new to us"" restaurants we tried this weekend and the other really lacked hospitality.  Viva Mercado's experience was so pleasant, (fantastic food, too or course) I wish the management team of ""other place"" would dine here to see how to bring great service.

Coming from the Northwest (and a heartbreaking shortage of authentic Mexican cuisine), we were camping for a week when a hankering for burritos kicked us in the pants. We hopped on Yelp! and were taken right to Viva Mercado's - it was anything but a disappointment. 
Reasonable wait times and a lively, decorative atmosphere had us chomping at the bit upon catching eye and nose of the hot meals being served to parties nearby. Everything - the chips, sopa de fideo, habañero salsa, fajitas - was absolutely spot on. A perfectly balanced margarita, vegetarian and vegan friendly menu items (in Vegas?! Yes!), and the best damn service at a restaurant we've ever had were the perfect combination of filling and delicious. 
Special shout out to Ignacio, our server, for absolutely killing it on the server grind. Great job, Ignacio, I'll be asking for you every time I go to Viva Mercado's.

Disgusting.  Plus they gave us flour tortillas when we ordered corn.  Not the best date night, but an interesting experience whether or not it was authentic in any way or not.  Plus it seemed like the servers and bussers were staffed only by men and the hostess/host positions were filled only with women.  I definitely don't like that.  Can't we break the glass ceiling in America even if they can't in other countries?  I want a good mix of race, sex, gender, and culture when I go out.  Rant over.

If I think that your barbacoa is disgusting, isn't that my preference?  Sorry if offended you, but I had to take a star because you didn't like my review.   I asked the server 4 times if it was sweet and he said no.",buCuVZ0dywS3mVyPHnz6Gw,2,1,1,vZDSrz23v5fLKw4HBh21-w

He made us feel like we were murdering someone or completely breaking the law when we asked permission beforehand. If the restaurant has a policy that someone can't be in the bar area without an ID even if they aren't sitting at the bar then it should be communicated to all the employees. The bartender wouldn't even listen to me when I told him that the hostess said we could wait here for our food. He kept saying ""this is the law so she can't be here.""

The service is always great. Their micheladas are the best I've ever had (besides in Cabo). Fresh chips with homemade salsa and the best bean dip I've ever had always hit the table immediately.

I usually sit at the bar, have a beer and some chips and do one of their unbeatable happy hour specials. 

You canta go wrong with the chicken or the steak tacos. The chicken taquitos are also tasty.

If I'm dining with someone I love their fajitas to share. The Chile relleno is also a must try. 

My friends always order the margaritas and say that they are unbeatable for taste and price. If you're in the lakes area, check this joint out.

Great price, great service, amazing Mexican food.",O9Dbdo2LZut3e8VqIY9gtg,0,0,5,8jP-ERsrJwRSaO44UG9EZg

It's  much larger inside than we expected, but still only a couple small tables were open.  There's a bar on the left of the dining area, separated by a subtle divider and walkway. The staff were friendly, busy busy bees.

Chips, spiced-right salsa and warm refried beans were set out as soon as we were seated. Grilled onions and Serrano peppers were added later.  We asked our server, Tony, about Mexican beers on draft and he recommended Victoria, which he described as smooth.  It was a good cerveza that both BF and I enjoyed. Viva has an extensive menu, including pages of platillos combinations grouped by fish or seafood and meat or poultry.  These came with the typical fideo soup, rice, and refried beans.

BF tried the machaca con huevos with steak, served in his choice of corn tortillas.  He was very pleased with the flavor and portion.  I decided to try the  sizzling, flambe of carne asada borracha which had tequila and citrus notes.  Everybody always watches as a sizzling dish is brought to the table.  But it was so much more exciting to watch than to eat as, for me, it had too much of a barbeque type of flavor with way too many onions.  Still on a fiery flambe kick, we finished with the dessert of platanos (their bananas foster dish), which was a perfect way to end our date night meal.

Speaking of date night, this is a good location for a dinner-and-movies night, with the Regal Cinemas a short stroll away in the northwest corner.",WlhETinld_UJHcFp6F8C0Q,4,2,4,YrPlF7Q1RVo9mJZK5q-kBA

Combine both and add in their free chips, salsa, bean dip, and grilled peppers/onions, and you've got a large meal for under $10.

Sangria isn't as fruity as I like- seemed like the fruit was added for presentation but not present in flavor. Chips weren't too oily, tasted fresh with a light sprinkle of salt. Salsa and bean dip were decent. Tried the fish tacos on the specials menu, one of the healthier options on corn tortillas with grilled fish instead of traditional fried. Filling portion, great price.

The moment we sat down, tortilla crisps, salsa, bean dip, as well as sauteed jalapeño with onion were served.  The crisps were a little thick, but the salsa and bean dip were delicious.  The sauteed jalapeño was cooked to a perfect texture, but didn't have much flavour, aside from the spiciness itself.

The rice was relatively good, and it was not overcooked.  The tamale I ate was the first I had ever eaten, so I cannot really judge it since I have no other experiences I can compare it to.  However, I thought it had a good texture, and the corn flavour was evident.  The fish taco was sadly mediocre; the fried fish lacked crunch, and the lettuce was a bit soggy.  I was, however, a big fan of the tomatillo sauce on the taco.

The Pollo Ala Parrilla was delicious.  The chicken breast was surprisingly juicy (considering it is chicken breast) and the garlic and citrus flavours were robust.  It was a great piece of chicken.

The Chilaquiles were my favourite.  The moment it was bit into, a hint of a tang of white vinegar (or some other sort of vinegar) hit, and the other flavours followed.  It was a unique, simple, and easy-to-eat dish that I would love as a snack rather than dinner.

The service was fine.  The staff seemed to be following some very firmly established operating procedures, and therefore was efficient (although not necessarily genuine).

2310801,2013-11-30,1,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"So great to see Viva Mercado's is back in action.  The new place in the village square in Summerlin is a perfect location with ample parking, a movie theater close by, and plenty of shopping.  

The restaurant has a great vibe to it with an open dining room split into two sections and a good sized bar separated just enough from the dining area.  The atmosphere is a perfect blend of privacy without feeling too detached from the crowd.  The decor is a good mix of traditional Mexican flare and a modern sophisticated feel. Unlike some other Mexican places I've been the entertainment level of mariachi doesn't overpower the room or your table conversation.

The menu has all the traditional fare that I remember from the old location and the prices for the food are definitely reasonable.  The bar is stocked with plenty of tequila choices and margaritas (I'm partial to the Cadillac with Don Julio on the rocks with salt).

The chips, beans, and salsa they provide to the table hit the spot to start the meal.  The chips are always fresh and the salsa is a tomato based that isn't too chunky and just enough spice. If you are looking for a little starter the guacamole is a good addition to the chips and so is the queso fundido. The fideo soup has a great broth to pasta ratio and comes to the table piping hot.

I'm a big fan of the cheese enchiladas and Chile rellenos because they are expertly crafted, just enough sauce and cheese.  The rellenos batter is delicious.  You can't go wrong with the carnitas or Chile Colorado too.

One of the best parts of the experience is the staff. Even though they just reopened the staff is well trained and ready even when its packed.  Everyone was friendly from the host station to the server.  They all made sure the glasses stayed full and the chips and salsa were never empty, even if they weren't assigned to our table.

Overall kudos to viva for:
1. Reopening (missed you guys)
2. Great location with good layout and decor
3.  Awesome food and reasonable prices
4. Deep bar selection and well crafted cocktails
5. Well trained and super friendly staff

The menu is extensive and I like how it's categorized by seafood, pork and chicken etc...

I chose to build my own combo. I ordered a crispy shredded beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco shell was light & crispy, yum. 

A cup of Fideo soup accompanied my meal. It was very good.

We ordered and ate and the food was pretty good....BUT, the server came over and insisted we pay cash! They said their credit card machine was "" down"" and suggested we use their fee atm on premises. This seemed very fishy given that the place was full and no mention was made as we (or anyone else) arrived that cash was required. It would have been nice if we had been advised BEFORE we ordered that cash was needed. obviously after we ate it was very inconvenient to be asked for cash, given most people do not carry hundreds of dollars unless they are strippers or drug dealers. So, perhaps this was some sort of an effort to boost their atm fee revenue. When my husband questioned the manager, the very large cook came out of the back as a show of force. Their food is pretty good...but I won't go back. An apology would have been nice or perhaps a free desert??? Oh well.",xZzgLUz1FDhFDm01FLUBbA,0,0,2,Fv5jsDf8vEEPqHCHvxHwhQ

First, this is only one of TWO places in town we've been to that obviously make their chips and salsa in-house; an important detail of authentic Latin cuisine that never goes unappreciated.  And the PORTIONS...AY, DIOS MIO! I ordered a very generous Taco Salad with Grilled Chicken and a Quesadilla with Carnitas added, and by the time I got halfway through the salad, I was STUFFED...no entree or desserts needed! Well, not quite true...I counted my second Banana Margarita as my 'dessert'!

So one of the things to keep in mind when you come here is to bring an OUTRAGEOUS appetite to match those more-than-worth-your-dinero portions.

2503405,2015-01-27,1,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"I think of this place in terms of 2 out of 5 stars, but the shrimp ceviche is so dang delicious that I bumped it up to 3.

The restaurant is nice inside.  It's clean, well-decorated, nicely lit, and the layout is nice.  It's not huge, it's not tiny, it's just right.

The service is fine. The wait times are average and the people are nice enough.  I don't think anyone goes out of their way, but the good thing is you don't see people hanging about, chit-chatting either.

The food.  Everything (with the exception of the shrimp ceviche) is just ok.  It's not awful, it's not amazing, it's just ok.  This includes the chips, salsa, meals, desserts, etc.  We haven't tried anything there that has been enough to make us say anything other than, ""it's ok.""  My husband is kind enough to keep trying because he knows how much I love the shrimp ceviche.  

In my opinion, there are too many items on the menu.  It's way too overloaded with options.  Maybe if they trimmed back their offerings, perhaps they could concentrate on the food itself and take it to another level.   I think they are spread too thin.

The prices are high for what you get.  I think that the prices are too out of whack for the level of service, food quality, and atmosphere.  I think little things would be forgiven more easily if the pricing was more in-line with typical expectations.  

Take out.  I recently had the bright idea of getting the shrimp ceviche as a take out item.  I was disappointed to see that the portion is significantly smaller than what is provided during dine in, and that the price is the same.  I had to beg to get some extra tortilla chips, and even then they told me that they ""should charge me.""  That really rubbed me the wrong way.  Don't act like you're doing me a favor by short-changing my order, and then saving me $2 for extra chips.  

To the owner:  I appreciate that you take the time to read the reviews and respond to the less favorable ones.  I am hoping that you will actually take my recommendations and thoughts into consideration, rather than just dismissing them or ""checking into"" things.  I am truly writing this review because I want your restaurant to succeed this time around.  Besides, I'd go crazy without my shrimp ceviche fix!",zwzB0nCc-dzNMR_qewcogw,3,0,3,ye0wEvuiEU64oQIj2ByBAQ

2696344,2015-12-16,1,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"Mexican restaurants are a dime a dozen, so I'm not usually looking forward to eating Mexican food, but a friend had recommended Viva Mercado and it worked out Saturday night that we could head over there while in Vegas for the weekend.  I AM SO GLAD WE DID!  

It was Saturday and there were a few parties ahead of us so the wait was to be about 30 minutes.  The place was packed.  Luckily, about 20 minutes in, a man asked if we'd like to sit at a bar table.  Why, yes I would!  So we headed into the bar area and I'm glad we did.  My biggest disappointment is I threw away my receipt somehow between yesterday and today and I cannot remember our server's name.  This is important because our service was outstanding.  Between our main server and the bussers assisting him, I felt like I was in a fancy five star restaurant.  My iced tea was kept full at all times, chips and accompaniments were kept full and empty dishes whisked away.  When we first sat down our server brought us chips and salsa and a small bowl of beans - I don't eat them, but my husband was loving beans to dip his chips in!  Then he asked if we like spicy food, we said we did.  he brought out a plate of freshly roasted jalapenos on a bed of grilled onions.  WHAT?  This never happens!  They were tasty and while spicy not too hot for me!

The menu is HUGE (too big!!!) but I finally narrowed it down to the tomatillo carnitas enchiladas.  I asked for my beans on the side so the husband could have them and they brought a massive plate of beans ""on the side""!  My husband ordered steak machaca and eggs.  Both dishes ordered were a great size and along with all the chips and salsa, there was NO WAY we could eat it all.  I had mentioned to the husband that I thought it looked a little pricey for mexican food, but for what you get, it's an awesome deal.  We weren't drinking, so we only paid for our food and for both meals came out to about $34 before tip.  Oh, after we had boxed up half of our food to take home for breakfast, our waiter brought us crispy tortillas with cinnamon sugar and whipped cream to finish up with!

I know this sounds crazy, but this was one of the finest dining experiences I've had in Las Vegas and I'm there a lot and I like to eat good food.  I cannot imagine how there are negative reviews for Viva Mercado, because my experience was top notch.

The final kicker, I ate my leftovers for breakfast, MICROWAVED.  I'm a food snob and picky and I never eat leftovers unless it's like pasta or something simple, but this enchilada was so damned good, I wished I'd had more of them the next day.

  Not much to say about the food, except that we have ordered perhaps 10 different menu choices and have never been disappointed.  Best value, IMHO is the barbecoa beef burrito.

3167892,2015-03-17,0,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"We frequent the Village Square area pretty often. So when some friends of ours invited us out to Viva Mercado's, which happened to be one of my bookmarks, I couldn't turn it down. Sadly, the quality fell way short of what I expected after reading so many great reviews.

The restaurant itself, which sits in the farther SW corner of the center, is actually quite nice. It's a bit smaller than I expected just judging from the view outside, but there's still a decent amount of seating. On top of the bar and dining area inside, they also have a really cool patio area outside. Alongside a few tables, they have a neat family style, bar height fire-pit type thing that looks to seat about 10+. Since our visit was on a chillier night, we decided to sit inside, but if I were to return and the weather was nice, I'd request those seats. And for what it's worth, our party of 6 arrived just after 6pm on a Friday and got seated within 15 minutes. 

Much like similar restaurants, Viva Mercado's has a pretty extensive menu. Several pages offer everything from appetizers to combo plates. They also have one of the biggest seafood selections I've seen from similar style restaurants, which I now wish I had ordered from. I ended up going with the Mulitas, which they serve basically like a big open face taco. They offer it with several types of meats, and I opted for the carnitas. Quality wise, I'd say they're just about a notch above Macayo's, which really isn't saying much. The meat was dry, the tortillas were stale and there was so much sour cream on top of it, that I could barely taste anything else. After picking through it, there was little flavor to anything else on the plate anyway. I'm also not a huge fan of the rice and beans they have, which just seems like those cheap heat and serve sides. The highlight of our meal was the complimentary chips, served with a side a fried jalapeños and onions. I ended up eating more of those than my meal.   

For the most part, our service wasn't terrible, but it could definitely use some work. I ordered an iced tea that was obviously old and had been brewed a while back, so I just ordered a water on top of it that I planned to drink, but I never got it. That was a slight mishap and easy to overlook, but the biggest problem was with one of our friends who had a huge headache with his meal. He ordered a combo meal, which normally comes with rice and beans, but he requested no beans and double rice. When his plate came out, they gave him the rice and beans like it's normally served. He immediately told them that it was incorrect, so they took the plate back, but then brought out double beans and no rice. After having to tell them 3 times and sending his plate back twice, they still couldn't get it right and just ended up bring him a side plate of rice. Something so simple just turned into a huge ordeal. 

Overall, if you're a fan of restaurants like Macayo's then you will probably like Viva Mercado's. But I am not, and Macayo's is actually one of my least favorite restaurants. So with food that is barely a step above that, and service that is lacking, I can't say I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,2,1,2,9iBMW7vYq2Q5vV-WFpDjhg

I usually don't eat the refried beans but these were tasty and ate most of it, loved the rice and liked they had a mini salad with guacamole on the plate too. By the way I find guacamole flavorless and don't eat it but this guacamole had flavor and I ate it all! The Flan was good too especially loved the fresh whipped cream. When we were leaving the super friendly reception again acknowledged us and asked us how everything was and wished us a great day. I live in the southern part of county and wish they were closer to me but had this bookmarked in Yelp til I could get here and will return when I'm in the area again.",CrEBVkzIQs7tS-wWfaCjNQ,1,1,4,87o39zcbSP4d3nSX3PNitA

Sis and I both like Mexican food, so this was an acceptable solution. 

And we were met with all the food we could possibly want! The prices seemed steep at first, but we received plenty of your standard chips and salsa (but with delicious bean dip to boot!), tomato soup, generous portions of our meals, and a lovely sopapilla concoction with whipped cream and chocolate and caramel sauces. Mimi and I ordered the shrimp tacos while Sis ordered the steak fajitas. Yes, there was the hanger factor, but we devoured our meals and loved every bite. 

Service was great. Our waiter was very attentive to beverages, chips, and the overall state of the table. It was fairly quiet on an early Sunday evening, so any less attention would have been bordered on unacceptable.

Really, everything here was just so darn delicious, I can't wait to go back. I think the only thing I have seen done 'better' elsewhere is some restaurants have homemade chips, but this is such a trivial thing that is doesn't affect my review at all. The complimentary salsa was wonderfully flavorful and the bean dip was the best I ever had. (I never really understood why beans were served with the chips - who ate that stuff? - until I ate here, and then I couldn't stop eating it!) While we were looking at the menu (the lunch menu), I noticed there was a choice of a complimentary sample of either salsas or toriados. The toriados was described on the menu as fried jalapenos, which didn't sound great, so we decided to ask for the salsas. But when the waiter came by, he automatically brought the toriadoes. When we told him we actually wanted to try the salsas instead, he said no problem, and brought us those as well. Winner! The toriados (which turns out to be both onions & jalapenos sauteed) were phenomenal, tender, delicious, (seriously might be the best sauteed onions ever) and the salsas were great fun to try, with different levels of spiciness, and all with their own flavors behind the heat.

I ordered a combination plate with a chile verde (pork) enchilada, a chile relleno, and a chicken tamale. I was a little surprised that the pork was in chunks instead of shredded, but no worries, it was so tender it didn't matter. Delicious. I actually haven't had a chile relleno before, so I can't really compare it to others. It wasn't my thing - I guess I am not a fan of the breading. But it was still pretty good. And I immensely enjoyed the tamale. It did not have cheese in it, which might disappoint some people, but this made it perfect for me. My husband ordered steak fajitas, and he said they were phenomenal.

We did also order two rounds of margaritas, rocks, no salt. I know some reviewers thought they were too strong or tasted like pure tequila, but we loved them. The first round was perfectly mixed, but as it was made with standard tequila, it was a little sharp (as expected). We had the second round made with one of the premium tequilas, and it was divine.

The service was great, and I enjoyed the decor. I liked the bits of hand-painted vines on the walls, and the artwork for each booth. I had been wanting to try Viva Mercados for a long time because of the great reviews, and I am only disappointed that I didn't eat here sooner.

This is your average Americanized Mexican place that is lacking in depth of flavor and quality but still likes to charge for it. The salsa is just meh and did not have any spice, the dishes we got were just ok and way way overpriced for the quality.  I even asked for spicy sauce with my tacos and I did not even have a lick of spice let alone flavor.  I could have made something better at home. 

The service was ok but the waiters act like they get extra commission for the more liquor they sell.  The table next to us was ordering margaritas and our server was milking them like a cow and he barely even asked if we were ok until we were done with our meal.  

I felt like I had a ton of bricks in my gut after eating here and felt blah just like the meal.  They also don't take American Express. Will not be going back that is for sure.

Came here last night off the suggestion of yelp (so I blame all you 5 star-ers) and was hoping for some half decent Mexican food in Summerlin (yes my expectations were already simmering low).

I ordered pibil which I do not eat often so when it arrived I was half wondering if I got the right thing. I powered through the meal, dry pork loin (which is the worst) and my mom got chicken fajitas. Her's came as a burrito because the menu is so confusing she thought she ordered a sizzling fajita but it was chicken cooked fajita style in a burrito ( who comes up with such sadistic things?)

I wrangled a menu and realized the server gave me the item above pibil, fine, honest mistake, they took almost $9 off of a $18.99 meal (yes that's up there and for $19, I would have expected my mistake food to have tasted good too). I tipped them back the $9 and we left.

Then today I found out they gave my mom PORK or who knows what meat. 2 wrong orders in 1 party is not acceptable. I would not have tipped and been so understanding if my mom would have told me. UUUUUgh why did she have to wait until I tried it first to let me know (the mom paradox) Anywho the bus boys were amazing and came to our table waaaay more than our server and I'm glad I found out now about the second mix up because I would still be there screaming about a $50 ++ meal where the only things right were the bean dip and chips.",CWiWYWLSHoxw4HMCm5126w,1,0,1,-3AUSshgs77sIevCduHolQ

Nothing inspiring. The menu was Ok, but man alive, I thought it was pricey. $8.95 for ONE TACO. You dont need glasses, you read correct eight dollars and ninety five cents for ONE TACO. The waiter insisted it's because it comes with rice and beans. (They must be magic beans!). I'd drive way across town to Taco y Taco for some damn delicious tacos' @ $2.19 each.

3607012,2014-07-22,3,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"OK     Been looking for a local place for Mexican...      Just a casual, flavorful place that I can get great tacos and guacamole and not spend too much money.   So I arrived here at Viva and immediately was surprised by the inside of the place.    From the outside...   its unassuming and looks like it could be a local answer to baja fresh Chipotle...(did I spell that right?)    but its not that...      at all.     The dinning room features a long and inviting bar area and a lot of table space.   So much that almost half of the dinning room was closed off for the lunch service...   no matter.     The decor is warm with a hint of...    dare I say elegance.   (More on that later)

Ordered 2 margaritas and some guacamole.     We keep trying to find guacamole that compares to Segundo on the strip at the Fashion Show Mall.    So out it came...   a bowl of guacamole.    Now...     Having it made table side really makes a difference.   That said...   they didn't do that....   It comes the way it comes.     I like having to option to put a little more lime and heat in it when someone makes it for you at the table.     Listen, it was good, but i found myself wishing it had more of this and that.    Ah well.

Ok Margaritas...      I get it...     you?    a guy?    a margarita?    Ok don't judge me...    the wife and i wanted one...   we got one...   well kind of.    It sure looked like a margarita...   but what it was was likely 3 straight shots of tequila.   That's all fine and good, but I'm not a college student trying to get a girl drunk...      took one sip and ordered a coke    (OK it was a Diet Coke...   again don't judge me)    Here's where we take a turn.     After telling the waiter that it was Waaaay too strong and that I was not going to drink it...   it sat there...    full and mocking me from the glass for the entire meal.   I wonder...     Will I be paying for that drink that I didn't drink and complained about?   Hm

Food was good.   Wife got the enchiladas...   I the Caritas and they were good.   Very good.     and here is the kicker...    they seem to welcome you with little freebies like bean dip,   Fried jalapenos, and after everything they send out a little cinnamon type dessert.      Nice!     Classy!

Ok bill came and yes the drink was on it.     No worry...   I was a waiter in my youth...   I get how booze on a bill is great for your bottom line for tips and I realize that taking it back to the bartender would have been bad for him...    ok.    The classy thing to do would have been to take that one off the bill...   seeing as how it was barely touched and commented on early on in our experience.     

OK so about the place....      It feels nice and welcoming...    a little fancy.    Not what we are looking for.     Listen, I love a burger place, but its not fancy food and I hate a burger place that tries to be an elegant gourmet experience....    I feel the same about Mexican food.      I just want a place that is bright and casual and not fancy...   not so casual that were in baja fresh, but not so fancy either.     

I think I just wish that Segundo had a restaurant closer to us on the west side. 

All in all...   good food...   would defiantly do it again, but was not and is not what we were hoping for.      And hey guys...       when something is not good and commented on, just take it off the bill.     Don't make people have to be that person who asks to ""Talk to the Manager"" to do what you know is the right thing.",2WRkx_wAvetUVWnnJa5KYA,4,2,3,vvUfFwxPa_vryRNPfuxQ4Q

The things I've had and have sampled by sponging off of a friend's plate...
Pollo en mole pablano which was delicious, the Mole sauce was dark, rich, and tasty.
Chimichango de pollo asado, had it with both the green and red sauce.
Pollo chile chipotle con crema, creamy and spicy sauce which was very tasty. 

One of the things that I like and the reason that I always leave with leftovers is that besides offering complimentary tortilla chips and salsa and refried beans, they also start you off with some sauteed jalapenos and onions.  It's great to start off with a few chips and top it with some of the jalapenos and onions with a spoon of salsa...super satisfying to wash that down with a sip...I mean gulp, of margarita!  They also include a cup of fideo soup if you order an entree.  

And if that wasn't enough, at the end of the meal, we were brought some deep fried flour tortilla wedges that were sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and drizzled with chocolate syrup, then topped with some whipped cream.

To Go items and had a margarita at the bar while waiting. The drink was grreeat and I was tipsy half way through :) Met some nice people at the bar and made new friends!

I ordered the 3 combo with chicken and fish tacos and a burrito; a steak quesadilla, chili con queso and a large side of guac. Everything was awesome. Portions are huge, so the 3 combo is perfect for 3 people. Steak quesadilla is pretty darn good but was insanely salty. Omg omg Omg. So much salt. I had to break it up with lots of beer at home..... 

Tacos were aight. Nothing really to die for but did the job. I had to give the grilled chicken from one of them to my dogs because they were losing their minds. Happy kids when they get human treats. Ah.

Burrito..l will have tomorrow and update this post. 

The only thing that I was absolutely disappointed with and wish I could just smash against the wall is the FLAN. Completely curdled and a fricking mess of a dessert. Curdled, egg-y tasting bullshit. Goddamn it. This is what I was looking forward to the most. 

Side note: We had Sierra Nevada Otra Vez beer with dinner and it was pretty darn good.

Having said that I was stumbled across this restaurant in accident as we were looking for another place for dinner. As I walked in we were greeted by a very nice hostess who welcomed us and directed us to our table. Immediately our waiter came up and offered us drinks, I hadn't had a chance to look at the menu due to the amazing atmosphere and live music that I just ordered coke. When he brought out drinks I saw that they had orchata (my favorite) which he happily exchanged for. My wife ordered chile rellenos and I tried the nachos (because it's very hard, extremely hard to mess up nachos) and my son ordered from the kids menu. When the food arrived they looked amazing and to my surprise tasted even better then they looked. I really enjoyed my meal and even had enough left over for the next day. I have gone back to this place like three times since I had those nachos.

A good waiter should ask if anything was wrong with food upon seeing barely eaten tamale? I will eat here again but won't ever order Tamales here again.

In the past I have always rated a Mexican restaurant by their chili relleno - is it greasy from too much oil, is the cheese totally melted inside, is the batter crisp and covering all of the chili or is it sloughing off, and is the sauce flavorful with a touch if spice - and Viva Mercado's met my expectations with one if the best chilis rellenos I have had!  Service was good both times, and they will make your margarita to order - Sauza Commeritivo and Cointreau on the rocks, sin sal!  Que bueno!  Their sliced, grilled jalapeños and onions are a delight; you cut them up and add to whatever you want, as much or little as your preference. My second lunch I was able to speak at length with Victor, Bobby's brother, and we reviewed restaurants past, such as Viva Zapata's on Tropicana and Maryland - yes, I was born here - does anyone else remember El Cholo on Fifth Street - I mean Las Vegas Blvd South?  And their carne asada tacos were very good as well.  However the great draw for me is their veggie tamale!  I came to love green corn tamales in Phoenix, at Manuel's on 32nd and Indian School, and until Viva Mercado's opened they were not to be found.  I have died and gone to Heaven!  In addition, their beans are flavorful and not runny, their quacamole is very good with the jalapeños and onions to add for more heat, their salsa and chips are fresh and the latter not greasy either time I was there.    And even better - nopales!  Their interior decor is lovely, the ambiance and noise level is great, and I am taking our daughter and granddaughters there on Saturday.

Our drinks were so bad we had to order extra shots to taste the tequila. Husband always orders the same Green Chili Pork Burrito and it always comes with green sauce. I ordered my dish with Flour tortillas (corn torts are never my preference). His arrived with red sauce and I was given corn tortillas. We wait for our server to do the two bite check back (basic service standard), and after about 5 min we give up and dig in. I ask our awesome busser for flour torts and our server. When our server LAZARO dropped the check, I asked him why we were given red sauce and he got very defensive and said we didn't ask for green and the computer always prompts him red (??). So then I say just so you know I ordered flour not corn and he nearly lost it on me. He vehemently denied what I ordered and I felt like I was in trouble and at fault. So unprofessional and prideful!! I've been serving for over 15 years and know better, and so should he! The WORST part is that he was chatting with the gentleman (I assume the owner who is always standing at the bar) and as we got up to leave he gave me an epic stare up and down.

We were seated promptly, brought our iced teas, and given plenty of time to look over the lunch menu.  We were also brought chips and salsa and refried beans.  The salsa was very good with a very nice tang to it.

My wife ordered the pollo ala Mexicana and I ordered thew chicharrones with nopales.  Both dishes were very good.  Each was served with refried beans and a small salad.  I wish the nopales were fresh but they were pickled and mixed in with the chicharrones.  

We were looking at the dessert menu when a server brought us some fried tortillas dipped in cinnamon and sugar with a dollop of whipped cream and cherry and some chocolate syrup.  There was no need to order dessert.  This was just the small kind of ending we were looking for.

Service was excellent!  Our iced teas never wanted for refills and the food is good.  I like the layout of the restaurant and it's larger than it appears from the outside.

The server never mentioned they only had Pepsi products. Oh and my other friend ordered a water and received a Pepsi. They brought us some sort of soup before the meal which tasted a lot like a can of microwave noodle soup. Not impressed. When I got my beef enchilada the meat was actually cooked wonderfully, however, it was accompanied by the most horrendous beans I've ever tasted.

Well I decided to stop in a few days ago and found that the place was pretty empty... strange I thought bc this place was always crowded and lively...I should have taken the hint... apparently others feel the way I do. service was very slow even though it wasn't crowded.. took forever just to get water... oh yea also ordered the fried jalapeños twice and they were never brought out...I ordered chili rellanos... when they came out the chesse was a hard brick of cold cheese and the flavor was bland. Long story short.. this used to be the bomb but looks like they lost their touch.....

This is an add on after the manager's comment:
I love how the manager attacks anyone that has something critical to say about his restaurant.. instead of apologizing for the incident and trying to make it better... and no sir I did not bring it up to the waiter because I'm not looking for a free meal.. it was edible and I ate it therefore I feel I should pay for it.. it was however NOT good... furthermore after my wife(who left a review as well) discovered a 3 inch long piece of ""tissue paper"" ...as you so duly corrected her in her review... buried inside her Asado salad we were really just ready to cut our losses and leave... your contempt for the customer is simply amazing and I was going to drop the issue with the foreign substance in her food but now we will move forward with a complaint to the health district. And of course we will never nor will any of our friends eat there again.",HxSxxtGRRLt9QDSSmEQ4zg,1,1,1,mmMF04o49CAWTMNYA5QCDA

The tortillas were soggy and the green chili sauce just didn't taste good I thought it was a little watery.

A lady had a table reserved as well next to us.  She made a big fuss about not wanting to sit by the kitchen and not wanting to share the room, so we where asked to move. The waiter was the only good thing about this place, he was very knowledgeable about the dishes, but the dishes where misleading, they use artificial chicken for a $17 plate, which one of my guest had to send back because it left a lingering taste in her mouth. We both work in the food industry and we know our food... Overall the food was bland without flavor and very over priced. I love Mexican food and have been to plenty of Mexican restaurants and this by far was one of the worse food, as food and service. That's just sad the busser continued to brush me off as I asked him questions,  just act like they where really ready for us to leave,  so we just got to go boxes and left because it was an unwelcoming feeling.

Viva Mercado's used to be open on Rainbow, but has moved to the shopping center where 808 Tapas, Bachi Burger, and Buldogis is located. It is actually deeper into the shopping center located next to a coffee shop and a few boutique clothing stores.

I dined here with a co-worker during a slow afternoon around 2 PM. 

Chips are served to each table with salsa AND bean dip, yum! Choices my friends, I love choices. As for my meal, I selected the chicken burrito that comes with rice, beans, and pico de gallo. My co-worker was paying for the meal, so I didn't want to get too spendy. He ordered the carne asada torta, which looked great and he said was awesome.

My chicken burrito was excellent with moist chicken inside and a red sauce on top with melted cheese. What I really enjoyed about it was that it was not MASSIVELY HUGE. Nor was the amount of beans and rice on my plate. I think in a time when people are just eating way too much food I applaud restaurants that are willing to NOT slop massive amounts of side dishes on plates OR create such huge burritos no one in their right mind would sit at a table at eat it all at once.

Service was a bit slow. Our drinks were refilled, but we waited quite awhile for the check. Our server disappeared from the restaurant floor for about 10-12 minutes and we had to wave down the busser to get him to come out and bring our check.

4484770,2015-02-28,3,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"I haven't enjoyed a meal this much in a long time.  I'd been to Viva Mercado's once before, when it shared a parking lot with Walmart on Charleston and Decatur (or maybe it was somewhere else).  It was our friends' favorite Mexican, and we liked it.  Maybe it was the location, but we never went back.

Fast forward more than a few years, and this new incarnation, in a reincarnated shopping center with bunch of trendy restaurants, is a winner.  From the service to the ambience to the food, we couldn't have been more pleased.

Our waiter, who I think was named Alfredo, was exceptional. He recommended the sauce (Costeña) for my chicken, and it was spot on - rated 5 (out of 10) on their heat scale, and just the right amount of spice for me.  Like all the dinner plates, it came with a cup of tasty fideos soup, refried beans, rice, and some salad.  The chicken was so astoundingly good that when I took home half the dinner and couldn't have it the next night (due to a ""previous commitment""), I was actually craving it!  I did manage to scarf it down the following night.

My husband had the Tilapia Salad and that, too, was terrific.  He didn't bring home any leftovers, but not because it was a small portion.

Sangria was supposed to have a ""crown of brandy"", but I didn't taste any.  I think the crown needs a few more jewels.  It's not sweet, which might be off-putting to some, but I was glad it wasn't syrupy.  While nicely decorated with an orange slice and a couple of pineapple slices, there wasn't any fruit in the drink.  The chips weren't overly salty, and we enjoyed the bean dip.

Our waiter gifted us with buñuelos for dessert.  Normally, I'd never order them, but who could resist the pretty, cracker-like triangles, drizzled with chocolate syrup and a dab of whipped cream, placed in front of us and crying out ""Eat Me!""  We sure couldn't!

Since moving to Vegas a decade ago, Mexican food hasn't been high on our list of go-to places, but our recent first visit to Frank & Fina's, and now Viva Mercado, has upped the ante.  I can't wait to go back!",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,7,8,5,lh3q7aEU71jr_nmLQi2h_g

I ordered the Mulitas, corn tortilla topped w/beans and cheese then your choice meat... I had chicken and carnitas... then topped with cabbage, queso fresco, guacamole, and sour cream. These were very tasty! I liked the carnitas a bit more than the chicken. I will def try the carne asada next time!
My husband had the Parrillada de Marescos.... Marinated Basa Fillet, Shrimp, Langostino, & Scallops over grilled onions & salsa quemala... the flavor of this dish was AMAZING!!!!
Food was really slow coming out, but they were really busy.
I ate so much of the chips, beans, and salsa (which again were great) that I couldn't hardly eat my dinner.

4533507,2014-01-18,1,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"This place is the real deal. My friend and I came here for dinner because the owner is from Chicago and I heard about the place from Chicagoans in the Desert. It is a new place in a strip mall next to the movie theatre. Can't remember which Mexican place it used to be but the interior is exactly the same. Very cool atmosphere. 

The complimentary chips and salsa they bring you are sooooo good. They also bring you a small plate of spicy grilled jalapeños and they are amazing - a little on the hot side but I love em. 

The menu is HUGE!! If you can't find something to eat here you have issues because they have a little of everything. I ordered two apps - seafood taquitos and 
Nopales. Whaaaaat!! Fresh nopales are quite rare at Mexican places so I always order when I see them on the menu. They are definitely not from a jar. 

The seafood taquitos are decent but not my favorite. Had pieces of baby lobster and shrimp which was tasty. 

My friend ordered combo tacos beef and chicken. She also ordered fresh guacamole which was incredible. 

Back to the nopales. They are served hot win onions and bell peppers. Seasoned nicely. I could have eaten this all week. I took some home and ate them cold the next day - they tasted even better!!!!! My mom used to make them fresh like this so it's sort of nostalgic for me. Nom nom nom!!!

There was also this mariachi walking around and singing some great music. He was so sweet. He came over and talked to us for a while, just a real nice man.  

Come and check this place out!! And get the nopales!!!

4606147,2015-04-04,1,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"Sadly enough I actually have to give my used to be favorite Mexican restaurant in Vegas a 1 star rating. I have been going to Mercado's for years, even at the old location on Rainbow (which I must say was WAY better than the new one). Ate here last night. First off, the server, Alfredo was very unfriendly and rude. My order of plain cheese enchiladas was wrong because I asked for green sauce instead of red. He grabbed the plate off the table and acted disgusted that I wouldn't eat what was given to me, wrong order or right order. The rice was cold and hard. I was not trying to chip a tooth! The salt on the margarita was slim pickings and whatever salt was on there fell off on the table as soon as the waiter slide it on the table. Next when we got our bill, the prices were higher and different than the ones on the menu. I would like to point out that both of our menus reflected these prices: The combo plates showed as 9.95, 12.95, 14.95 on our menu and I noticed the Brunch price was 14.95. When we brought this to Alfredo's attention he basically called us liars and then went to the register to grab menus to prove to us that he was right. I could see him fumbling through menus to find the ones with the prices that we were charged and higher. What I am thinking was they updated their menus with new pricing and maybe gave us an older menu. The menu he brought over showed the combo plates at being 12.95, 15.95 and 17.95 and the brunch at 15.95. He then proceeded to tell us that the menus were never updated or that the prices had never been increased. 

It's not about the 1-item combo plate being 12.95 versus 9.95 on our menu, but the fact that they basically called us liars. I know what I saw on the menu and I am not blind. Talked to the manager, I think that's who he is and all he says, ""well I'll have to find those menus!"" Are you kidding me? Bad customer service. Our entire family will never eat here again because of the service.",Mjb4SAwruFA7R2t_kFOy4A,3,1,1,FKMArnsuGcYvBnJQ5WQmJw

My husband and I ordered a pretty simple meal 1 item combo and I a chicken tostada salad, and guac as an appetizer. Our waiter Lino was super nice but disappeared for a long time after he took our drink orders. About 10 mins go by and we get our drinks. But no guac. That's fine. Another 10 mins go by still no guac. Then right before we get our entrées the guac finally arrives. So I take a few bites of my salad and suddenly I bite down on a hard piece of ""something"" so I take it out of my mouth thinking it's probably a piece of chicken or hard piece of lettuce. Well to my surprise it's a piece of wax paper. Not a small piece but about 2 inches long yellow piece of wax paper. The kind of paper you get your tortillas wrapped in.  So again our nice waiter is no where be found. I get up and go to the hostesses to explain and tell her I just want a new salad. She's apologetic and takes my food. Minutes later our nice waiter comes by and apologizes I tell him I just want a new salad and not to worry. Well... like 10 minutes go by when I finally get my salad and by this time my husband is done with his dinner and I'm just over it. What am I going to do eat my meal while my husband watches me since he's long done wafting?? We ask for our check and more minutes go by like 5 minutes and my husband has to go find Lino to get our check. Well he claims he was ""fixing"" our check. Of course he didn't charge us for the salad. Thank goodness. The service was horrible and my food well what I ate of it was ok until the wax paper hurt my tooth. So not coming back here again.

I calmly pick up my phone and dry it he ignores it and doesn't even cater to bringing towels for the water spill. So my friend speaks up and tells him that he covered my phone in water and my screen at this point is turning green from the water. He looks at my phone and says sorry it was an accident and I told him no worries I understood calmly stuff happens I'm not worried about the phone.. then he proceeded to tell me after it doesn't mater cause the phone is still useable and it doesn't matter about the green on the screen and it wasn't his ""problem"" at this point I'm getting pissed and another manager comes over and is very polite and takes care of it and send the ""owner"" on his way. She asked me do I need anything at all I asked for my drink I ordered 45+ minutes ago and she says yes and brings me the wrong drink then says she gave me a better one.. I ignore it and just drink it anyway. So by this time my phone screen is not working and the touch is not active anymore... never got an apology from the gentlemen that did the damage or anything other then told it's not his problem that he threw a shirt at our table unprofessionally and ruined my phone. So because the fact I decided to go eat there it cost me 175$ to insurnce claim my phone for a new one.. on top of that I'm greeted with a bill for my 20$ burrito and on top of that with the drink I was given that I didn't order placed on my buddy's bill.. Worst customer service ever! Understand accidents happen and it was buisy due to the night but it wasn't my fault this employee/owner decided to throw a shirt at a table where no one was paying attention to him.

This shopping center has become a great dinner and a movie spot - so many great options now!  This was my first time at Viva Mercado's - I didn't even know there was another location before.  We really enjoyed our food.  I tried mulitas for the first time (sort of like a soft tostada layered with toppings, like a fried but soft corn tortilla with beans, and I had it with carnitas).  It came with great quality queso fresco and other toppings, and it was really tasty.  I really loved how they bring out the fried jalapenos and onions upon request.  We enjoyed putting them on chips with the bean dip and salsa (complimentary) and also I added some to spice up my food.  

My husband had some sort of seafood dish.  I don't remember the name of it, but it was a huge saucy plate with fish, shrimp, peppers, etc., and with a second plate of beans and rice on the side, and a side of tortillas.  I laughed when his 3 plates of food came out as his single dinner plate!  

I didn't love my margarita - it was a house margarita and a little sweet for me (maybe too much triple sec or mix, if they use a mix), so I would definitely splurge on a more specialized one next time.  They have a huge margarita menu, so I will need to try something different.  But I won't hold that against them.  My mistake for choosing the plain house margarita.    

They brought us a cute cupcake for Valentine's Day at the end of our meal - a very nice touch for a restaurant with casual food and lower prices, when we didn't order dessert.  :)  

I should note the menu is huge.   It has to be 10 pages.  At first I said, ""I love this!  Lots of choices!""  But after about 5 minutes of reading the menu, I felt a little overwhelmed and was actually laughing - so much food to choose from!  I do appreciate that though - it is unfortunate that to so many people, Mexican food is a taco, enchilada, or burrito when there are so many more authentic dishes!  So here, you can find them all, and then some.  I was happy to try something new.  

We usually go to Macayo for sit-down (not take out) Mexican food, but I think this will be our new Mexican spot - closer to home and the food seems better.  I will update and comment after we try this with our kids.  :)",eArDc4Z-1oM1NirhGRlk0A,3,3,5,lLL5C4RNarSW_ij4PK7iKg

The food. We ordered two three combination dishes and two tamales. Every single thing was amazing. My favorite was the pork enchilada and the chicken tamale. The sauces were slightly spicy but perfect. The cheese was actually melted in the enchilada. If you get cheese enchiladas a lot then you know most of the time the cheese inside is not melted.

But be warned, if you get the burrito, that thing seriously weighs as much a small child. There is no way a normal person could finish it. When we do get this, we always eat half and box up the rest for the homeless.

Even after I got it, examined it and even took a bite out of it; I couldn't believe it.  The last nine times we were there the chicken mole was made from a real chicken breast plus some. 
So, I asked the waiter that there was something definitely wrong with my chicken mole and it's not what I'm paying for. He said that he will ask the cook about the frozen chicken. At first the Cook said, that it's always served with a frozen chicken and the last times I've ordered the chicken mole, I must have not been paying attention.  I said it's sad that you think of me that poorly, but I was pretty sure he was wrong. Then, I told him that I had yelped this place before with pictures of the mole not served with a frozen chicken; I started looking through my phone, then he apologized that he just remembered that just recently they started using frozen chicken on the mole. My waiter was definitely embarrassed of his remarks, apologizing for that, then telling us that he was going to remove the mole off our bill. He asked me if I wanted anything else to eat, I said no.

They offer additional salsa flavors for $2.5 each, but we just stuck to the original.

I opted for the chile relleno and he had the rajas con crema with chicken.  Both were good.  Before the meal we tried the queso, which proved to be quite a challenge to eat.  The cheese was stringy and greasy, not like a dip.

The complimentary chips, salsas, and bean dip, are always a winner! :)

Apps:

Queso Fundido - Yum! This ooey gooey dish is so tasty! Definitely messy, but that just makes it more fun to eat. 

Chili Con Queso - This was a bit spicy for my taste, but my boyfriend loved it. However, I found that I kept eating it despite the spice, so it must have been good! lol

Guacamole - One of my fave things on the menu! Super fresh and delicious, my boyfriend is lucky if he gets any at all!

Main Dishes:

I have tried most of the dishes available for the combination platters, and I have thoroughly enjoyed them all! One of my favorite parts is the sopa de fideos. I don't know what it is about this simple soup, but I love it! 

If I had to chose my favorites, it would definitely be the crispy shredded beef tacos and the chicken enchiladas with green sauce. They are definitely my two go to dishes here. The chili verde is very good as well.....and the tamales......and the burritos....and the tostadas......I could go on and on and on!

I did get three limes on the side and tapatio packets wich I loaded the toastas with wich by the way we're all broken. I also order a tinga sope wich was a load of oil there was so much freeze that one bite was enough for me . The camarones en mojo were spicy as hell im not sure if they mixed my order but my bf can't eat spicy so his dinner was a waste . I think for 50$ worth of food it was a complete waste /: even the guacamole was flavorless idk how you mess that up.

The salsa they give you with the chips is sweet,  I saw one person on here describe it as tasting like spaghetti sauce and I would have to agree.  No flavor of onions, cilantro or Chile only sweet tomatoes kinda sad.
The green Chile pork burrito I had was very light on the meat and was nothing but a few pieces of fairly bland pork with on ok green tomatillo sauce.

I got beef sopes and my husband and his friend got the chicken tacos. husband's friend got 2 beers and then we had 2 margaritas each.

When we got our bill we were charged for 5 margaritas, we told our waiter about it and he apologized and said he'd get it fix. Next thing you know the manager came over and pretty much interrogated us about why we were only going to pay for 4 margaritas and not the fifth one. 

We definitely didn't like the manager's attitude about the situation then he stood with the waiter only a table away from us, in front of other guests, and argue with each other about what had happened.

That was my dad's concise review but I will expand a little. Our family ate at Viva Mercado for our Sunday meal this week. I was most impressed by the service. The waiters and bussers were moving quickly around the room without pause to assist every patron. I always measure a restaurant based on how quickly they refill my water because I drink lots of it, especially with spicy food. I was never left wanting at Viva Mercado, I was continuously checked on and brought water, napkins, more chips, etc. 

The meal comes with chips, salsa, and bean dip, all very tasty. The prices are a little higher than what I would normally pay for this type of food but so worth it for the service and all the little extras you get. My meal was simple, just a chicken quesadilla, but delicious and the chicken was nicely seasoned. 

The meal was followed with a delightful little dessert course of a crisped tortilla with cinnamon sugar, drizzled with chocolate and caramel sauce and topped with whipped cream. So yummy.",P78ReKnTlf5QmG5TEta5LQ,1,1,5,ni6LYiCrzh9WxmkinCes_A

Most members of our family can't remember the first time they ever ate Mr. Mercado's food. A typical taste first begins even before we walk if not vicariously in utero. Around the table at our most recent visit, we witnessed a third generation initiate of only 11 months experience enlightenment. The menu is massive, the recipes are unique, the friendly service is genuine, the atmosphere is authentic, and the transformation is permanent. Not a believer yet? I challenge you to just take one single bite of a regular taco here and not give the place at least four stars based on that bite alone.

5806462,2017-03-24,0,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,I finally visited viva mercados after living next to it for 4 years. I don't know what took me so long. It seems hard to find good and authentic Mexican food in Las Vegas. This was comfort food to me. It was very close to the kind of food my grandma makes me for back at home. We went on a Sunday night for my husbands birthday and had a lovely time. There was no wait and the decor is nice and clean. We will be back!,hfIb8X76IZwOa8ioE34ZRA,0,0,5,PREQpO9X2N0_4-UiOXMLTg
5821483,2016-07-31,1,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"I stopped by here for HH deal, and the best part is they have it daily, so you can get some deals on the weekends. I believe it was 3-7p.m. or something like that. 

The house margaritas are $5, and tap beer was $3 or $4? 
I randomly asked if they served Michelada, and they said they can make it even if it's not on the menu. It wasn't the best I've had, but I appreciate them for trying. 

The finger foods are small portions, but a good way of trying some of their food during happy hour deals.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,1,4,VkrH3qFqtByDIACSBT6kOw

No shows for 2 hours... yet again. And I'm not ordering complicated items... ablondigas, which I would imagine is sitting and waiting to be scooped, and chilequiles, with a fried egg. Who knows.... but this goes back to the fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me. Once I finally gave up on waiting 45 minutes past the delivery time, I see the guy pull in and he looks puzzled, and irritated that he left the store 30 minutes prior and couldn't make it the 1.3 miles in that time.


Edit: and when I checked the voicemail he left me as I told him I already called and cancelled the long overdue order, he says, ""are you talking to me you stupid, effing, beach"" (you do the math)",Oi8rMmCMOyCNCZE3vSkepw,0,0,1,jabtvJtgjDxnrTh6JJtUcA
5835079,2018-03-23,0,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"This restaurant is definitely not what you'd expect from the outside. What do they say... never judge a book by its cover? It is so roomy and nice on the inside and I was not expecting that at all since it was in a business complex. The decorations were warm and inviting. The hostess sat us down and right away they brought out chips, salsa and bean dip. The chips were fresh and crispy. The salsa was the perfect blend of flavors and spice. I ordered the chimichanga, and my partner got one of each flavor of tamale (beef, pork, and vegetarian). All three tamales tasted amazing. My chimichanga has nice flavor. My only complaint would be that it is a little bit on the pricey end for Mexican food. However, I throughly enjoyed the ambiance of this place and would definitely come back again. I wanted a mariachi band to come play (and I don't even like those) it was just that nice.",ocC1kDdcWg6hVaTDJssM-Q,0,0,4,X8fbwW53YFKvfl07ctN78Q

Fajitas with Grilled Marinated Steak, Green Chiles, Green Bell Peppers, cilantro, White Onions, and tomatoes topped by Guacamole and Sour Cream sizzled with excellence, and I was pleased to note that the meat sported no fat.  A Shredded Beef Taco with marinated meat on a crisp Corn Tortilla tasted very good with Queso Fresco.  An included accompaniment, Mexican Fried Rice, was okay; and another, Frijoles Refritos, very good. 

A cup of complimentary Fideo Soup was good and hot but arrived at the table late.  Other than this,wait service was good except for one service lapse on drink refills.  The atmosphere of a festive fiesta added authenticity to the locale, and enhanced our enjoyment of the meal.

This is a really long drive from North Las Vegas but I expect that I will be back.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,5,6,4,m0b3k9d2NKQJ62sqnEEQzA

I love that you get chips and bean sauce at the table. I usually have to exhibit some self control not to spoil my appetite eating those chips before my main. The only thing that is strange is that I don't see much of a difference between their shrimp ceviche and mariscos.  Both seem to contain mainly shrimp.  Definitely save room for their buñelos, which are cinnamon sugar crisps with whip cream and chocolate sauce.",zD7nzkNvZHEA64yaE8uc2A,0,0,5,vMbv1mWB2zy6n8AnFOSC1A
5866746,2014-06-29,7,CZhc8YXdFLhAI4ViC2ERTg,"I was craving tamales and found this place on a Yelp notification highlighting local Mexican restaurants with a great tamales selection.  Something in the highlight made this restaurant stand out.

Viva is located in a strip mall, which I will warn is towards the back corner.  We came in the wrong side of the complex and had to drive around to find it.  From the outside it looks like a fast food place, and I was quick to become reserved about my choice.  The owner greeted us when we walked in.  He actually took the menus from the hostess and seated us himself, which I thought set an excellent tone for our dining experience.  We were immediately asked for a drink selection and the margaritas (@ $7.95 a piece) were recommended.  We chose the strawberry and regular margaritas.  The strawberry was good, the regular margarita was not...don't recommend anyone try it.  :/

The inside of the restaurant doesn't match the outside at all...so don't be judgmental!  The decor is beautiful.  There is a running water feature and traditional Mexican music in the background.

The menu is extensive.  If you are craving it, they probably have it.  There is a whole page of drink options, appetizers and multiple pages of entrees.  I was disappointed in their tamales selection...there was only one and it was on their ""make your own combo"".  They offer a brunch menu on the weekends only.  It had a nice variety and included a small mimosa or margarita.  

The back page of their menu book listed all their homemade salsas.  They offer a sampling of each for a small amount, I think it was like $2.95.  

They bring chips, bean dip and salsa when you are seated.  The chips were standard quality, but fresh and crispy.  The salsa had small pieces of onion, cilantro and pepper in it.  Again not the best I've had, but it was flavorful.  The best part was the plate of grilled jalapeño peppers and onions.  They were AWESOME!  Their Fideo soup was good, but not the most flavorful I have had.  The carne asada quesadilla was very flavorful and large enough for 2 people.  It didn't come with any sides, just a dollop of sour cream and guacamole.   

In summary, not a bad place at all.  I would have preferred to give 3.5 stars.  The service was good, the food was good and the atmosphere very nice.  The prices were pretty high.  Most entrees were $15.95 and up.  For the size of the margaritas I thought $7.95 was a bit much.  So just a heads up that this is a more pricer place to eat.  I heard the owner previously had the Viva location on Rainbow, which closed, so I hope this reincarnated location is more successful.",9Ms5wpxVloadWFvDbb77kg,8,10,4,L9VQ4T4zqDqUi0c3Wi4B-A
