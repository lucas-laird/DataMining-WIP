Homemade potato chips were gone too quick next time will need an extra order. Then to top it off had the brownie sundae and was in heaven. Great servers and a wonderful atmosphere. Next time I have company in town will deffinetly take them there.,rafmR5depZVP9lPYI8Rn4w,0,0,4,XO85e4vQTX30HyBmLh6Eww

We were helped (or shall I say, not helped) by 4 different waiters, because they were all busy flirting with a cute waitress and chit chatting to help costumers. Our order was taken incorrectly, which wasn't easy to correct since it was hard to get anyone to help us. The wait time in between taking orders, receiving drinks and food was ridiculous and to top it off the only time we were asked for refills was when we received our check. It's sad that the only time we were helped was when they wanted us to leave. 

The food at Bottles & Burgers is good, but the service probably would have been better at In N Out. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. Go across the street to Boca Park and eat at Cheesecake Factory. Don't waste your time or money at Bottles & Burgers.",G_oFAGZraoLnlZDkl35Rrg,0,0,1,7fc35Ogu9m0C-852DU9NVw

Thank you for taking burger making seriously!  All I wanted was a good burger and a night out, so my hubby suggested B&B at Tivoli!  The location was beautiful and relaxing, the restaurant clean in design yet welcoming!  We sat down and my eyes dissected the menu until I decided on the Bootlegger Burger, Fellini Fries and a shake (cannot remember the yummy name) and it was all seriously good and satisfying!  

Let's break it down, the burger starts on a homemade bun, with real cheese, homemade sauces, and the meat is seasoned great with fresh toppings!  The fries WOWZA were good **but ask for more dipping sauce**  

I don't crave a burger very often, but when the crave comes again you can bet on where I'll be in Vegas!",DK01jsn-JcbiBamE1pB1mQ,1,1,5,7-v0zJIQx5uLlAX2CxHpPg

I mean who charges 7$ for a shake??? And it was  runny and more like sweet runny milk then a nice creamy thick shake the meat in my burger was cooked well but the meat was bland and tasteless my wife had the sliders witch was the same wen the plate came to the table FINALLY"" I was like wheres the beef!! Or more where's the rest of the burger I'm paying for? And i had to by the frys separately? the frys wer a nice concept nice thick cut and ridged but were way over cooked... I am a chef myself and believe me anyone that's looking for a better tasting and better value for money burger better just go burger king!

My burger came out and the onions on the burger were weak- it looked like a sauce. Though the burger meat was good, the burger as a whole failed. If I ever came back, I'd order the fries alone, and only the fries. They do have tasty French fries, but that's about it.

First off we went on a Monday where all bottles of wine were half off!!! Burgers are on the small side but tasty. I was worried when the server said that the chef recommend the burgers be cooked medium but when we got them they where between medium-rare and medium. Needless to say they were very tasty and since we had hit up the very overated bellagio buffet early in the day, the food portions didn't bother us. Also, my wife had a strawberry cake vodka milkshake and downed the whole thing...fun times ahead indeed! Overall, a great place to go (especially on half off wine day) to get a great tasting burger that will give you a break from the gluttonous time you are sure to have in Vegas.",J_M3LpQfenoXhL8SI9cFjA,0,0,5,IyiUPF-psqDfaJBD6womUA

694979,2012-06-27,0,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"I love Tivoli Village, the European-style development in the Summerlin area of Vegas, and not just because of its charming wrought iron balconies, stone facades, water fountains, and faux boulevards.  In a city that prides itself on vast casino spaces bent on sensory overload, it's almost cozy.  Tivoli Village has a quiet energy that encourages meandering among the shops and sitting on benches sipping a cocktail under trees accented with twinkling lavender-colored lights.  It's also close to home, which doesn't hurt.

All that strolling and shopping requires refueling, and Tivoli Village offers a nice variety of places to nosh. One of them is the gourmet burger joint Bottles & Burgers.  One Friday night after work, my husband and I picked up my brother-in-law and headed to B&B to get our burger on.

Kicking off the weekend, the place was hoppin' ... and filled with beautiful people.  The servers are not only selected for their customer service skills, apparently, because they all looked remarkably buff and attractive.  It wasn't just the waitstaff that was easy on the eyes; a majority of the patrons were good looking as well.  Not sure how well we fit into that mix, but no one made us feel uncomfortable.

Our booth was roomy but located right next to the restroom, a little too close for my taste.  More hustle and bustle than we wanted, but not too bad.

We started with an order of onion rings accompanied by a creamy green salsa.  The onion rings were nicely battered and crisp, and I really enjoyed the salsa.  The creaminess gave it a body that worked well with the rings, which wouldn't have been the case with a typical salsa.  It was nice step up from the standard ketchup and mustard.

I ordered a veggie burger that came with homemade potato chips.  My husband went with a nacho-style burger. My brother-in-law chose the sliders with a side order of fries and a milkshake.  The milkshake came first, along with the onion rings, and we all enjoyed a few slurps of chocolaty goodness.  It was delish!  The fries were another unqualified hit.  With both cheese sauce and gravy, they were yummy.  My bro-in-law wasn't wowed by the sliders but enjoyed them.  The homemade chips were bland enough to let the burger flavors shine... assuming they were there to shine.  My husband wasn't wild about the cheese sauce on his burger - he prefers his fromage shredded - but the tortilla chip strips stayed crunchy, and the burger was well done, just as he requested.  My veggie burger, unfortunately, was a disappointment.  It was mushy and lacked pizazz.  Even with a slice of cheese and sauteed onions and mushrooms on top, it remained blah.  I didn't finish it.

I firmly believe that a meal isn't complete without a bit of sweet, and both my husband and I indulged.  My husband's banana split reached new heights - literally and figuratively - of gourmet-ness, piled with whipped cream and topped with sugar art.  No real difference in taste from the diner version, which my husband appreciated.  He likes his classics to be classic, so he was happy.  I tried the opera cake.  It sure looked lovely with cocoa polka dots, a dainty dollop of whipped cream and a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  The taste was just so-so.  I was bummed because I relish my desserts, and I couldn't bring myself to finish it.  Can't win 'em all, I guess.

The verdict on B&B? Fun atmosphere with interesting selections that don't always live up to their billing.  Worth a second visit.",_VhWwXj4E1qks3b-7Zmkpw,0,0,3,JIVS4a0yPtUDgMh9b560iA

Second the food, I have read some bad and good reviews so was kinda skeptical. I have to agree with the bad reviews, first off my burger was over cooked. Then it doesn't help when it has no flavor. I ordered the bootlegger and expected the whiskey onions to be great but it was only a couple of chopped up onions and some runny gravy. The fries are good but you can tell they are frozen. Boyfriend had the salmon salad and must say it looked like it was only a couple of uncles. When he asked the server about it she said that's how they come disappointing, and extremely overcooked.

761998,2012-06-02,0,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,Sat in a booth with my wife and my friend. We had a bartender with short blond hair take our order. We ordered drinks. Drinks did not come in a timely manner. She brought me my beer  but forgot to bring my buddies margarita and my wifes adult shake. It was about 945pm and the place was not busy. I watched her go to the corner of the bar and eat a burger. Our food comes and we tell the guy that we never got our remaining drinks after 20 minutes. He took care of us and got us our drinks. My buddy tasted his drink and didn't like it. The blond came up to us and said she had a rough day and that it was 110 degrees today and people were rude. She was totally not a friendly bartender.

906347,2012-05-26,0,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"I was really excited to try this place, but I left feeling pretty disappointed.  

FOOD: 
The cucumber martini was nothing special - lukewarm with a sliced cucumber floating in it (our waiter was also off in the kitchen for awhile, and I watched my drink sit at the bar).  The week before I had been over to Kabuki, and their cucumber mojito was amazing.  I can't help but to compare since both places are in Tivoli.

My veggie burger was decent, but my husband's turkey burger definitely felt like something that was thawed out and put on a bun.  Once again, just down the street we had burgers at Bachi Burger (they just opened on Sahara and Ft. Apache), and they were outstanding.  Thus, restaurants need to make sure their products are outstanding every time because it's easy to just go somewhere else nearby that does the same thing ten times better.

SERVICE:
There seemed to be so much staff working that they didn't know what to do with themselves (it wasn't that busy, and it was happy hour).  Staff were hanging out by the bar, and people from the kitchen were coming out and kind of hanging out in the restaurant area.  This ruined the atmosphere in the restaurant for me because there literally were more staff hanging out than patrons.  Also, the manager was standing right next to me counting a till of money for everyone to see - it was really awkward - I kept thinking if someone runs in to rob this guy, I'm sitting right next to him.  If this place were better managed (less staff scheduled and better trained to be more cognizant of the restaurant patrons), I think it could be a great place.",p6BTpaxCLOXhX2pFRd52GA,0,0,2,ZID3ToWPAxh9psuQ2PAH_Q

The service was completely disorganized; orders came out wrong over and over. I was offered scotch and wine at 11:30am, while dressed in a suit and tie. I know this is Vegas, but really? The menu reads great, but the actual product was underwhelming. Burgers are petite, nearly flavorless, and bare almost no resemblance to those described on the menu.

1404942,2012-09-13,0,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"Went to B&B on 9 Sept. for late lunch. Got there around four. Nice place at Tivoli, too bad the service was so deplorable. From the hostess (who'd rather chat with the waite staff) to the manager. The whole time we were there it was like a social hour for the workers. The bartender(?) took our drink and food order. 

Two of the kitchen staff brought out the burgers which were good. We were sitting right at the end of the bar so the staff (including the manager) had to walk right by our booth. Not one time did anyone there ask if the food was ok, need another drink? etc..... I flagged down the manager for the check. He had the bartender bring it so he could continue his conversation with a newly arrived waiter about the Packers/49er's game. When the bartender brought the check THEN he asked if I wanted a beer? Really?

The primary reason we went is that our friends in Solvang CA 'Sort This Out Cellars'
are the suppliers of the 'Double Helix' brand wines and soda sold at this poor excuse of an eatery. When I asked about the wine they said it was 'good' and from CA but
'not sure where'. Wow what a review. Did I mention that the place was almost empty.
Some guy slobbering over a girl at the bar, A guy homesteading a booth with a baby in a car seat. (The baby was good.) And there was the waite staff chatting it up. 

The place is real nice and the play list is eclectic and enjoyable and not too loud.
The location is good and the food was ok. One of the burgers was $15. 

For what it's worth if you want a burger AND friendly service there is an overwhelming list of good burger joints within 3 miles of this place.

They also serve ""chips"" with the burgers which are homemade.  However, we did have an issue at first with the hostess.  Me and my two friends were interested in the Happy Hour menu.  We were seated at a booth by the bar and the hostess left.  One friend has a weight issue and could not fit into the booth.  I went back out and asked the hostress if we could have a table as my friend couldn't fit into the booth.  She said yes, however, we couldn't partake in the Happy Hour menu unless we sat in the bar.  I repeated that my friend could not fit into the booth and she repeated that we had to sit in the bar for Happy Hour.  I said so we are penalized and she said no, we could also sit on the patio.  We decided to try it even though there had been smoke and wind blowing all day but it turned out to be surprisely pleasant.  The bigger issue was the hostess was like a robot, reading from a script.  She showed no compassion for my friend or any interest in finding out if an exception could be made in this case.  There are tables just on the other side of the booth and it wasn't busy.  If the weather had proved too much on the patio, we would not have been able to partake in Happy Hour.  Hopefully someone in a wheelchair gets treated better.   

On the other hand, our wait service was excellent, along with the food, so we decided not to complain to the manager.  Feeling good about the rest of the evening, we did say goodbye to the hostess on the way out but the incident still bothers me.  The hostess is the first introduction to the restaurant.  Personality is way more important than a pretty face and if a customer is getting a little upset like I was, then she should have brought in the manager and not just recited the ""rules"".  My friend was embarrassed enough by not fitting into the booth and felt the hostess did nothing to make it better.

Our server was nice enough and suggested we try the sampler appy plate, as it is large enough to share.  He was right!  Our appy sampler included 2 pulled pork sliders, 2 regular sliders (these were subbed for the wings, as they ran out of the wings), one Mexican hotdog (sour cream/avocado/jalapeno peppers), fries (soggy and a bit cold), and half a dozen risotto balls (deep fried....so good but so bad for you!).  Hubby ordered the DH draft for $2 and pronounced it ""really good!""  Yeah, it actually was pretty good (I'm a non-beer drinker, so that's a big compliment).  

The food all tasted great, with the exception of the fries, which were cold and limp.  Not too impressive.  Overall, I think B&B really wants you to like it, but can't decided how to market itself.  Would I come again?  Maybe, if only to see if the fries are hot!",zwhty_ZmxbHAHoDfMjNbag,0,0,3,hsLWZW74nTSyzrlCURHiqA
2250567,2012-05-30,5,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"Returned to Bottles + Burgers today and nothing has changed: this restaurant is still as excellent and as underrated as ever. It seems they've listened to the comments here on Yelp as all burgers are now larger than they used to be and also come with chips. 

Meaning that I, a hungry chick with plenty of belly room, ended up leaving several bites of burger on my plate, and the chips - while light and tasty - went mostly untouched in favor of the sweet potato fries and Double Helix fries on the side. I know people were complaining here about not getting the artisan fries included with their burgers, but that's a boggle. This isn't a diner, folks, and prices are low enough to encourage ordering a $4 side of fries. 

But now everyone can be happy, so come on back, ye grumpy little Yelpsters, and please give B+B another go. (My prodding here is entirely selfish; I don't want to lose the best vegetarian burger in Las Vegas.)

This time I tried a different salad (the one with bleu cheese and mandarin) and it was every bit as subtle yet flavorful as the ""Pear""fection salad I had last time. As my husband suggested to the waiter, it would be good if they offered half-salads (even if not for half-price) because the salads are almost a full meal. Now that the burgers are bigger and include chips, I would have to rethink the salad next time or else be more wasteful than I'd like, and it would be a shame to miss out on the salad.

What I didn't try was the old-fashioned sodas, which is odd because normally I'm all about notching new soft drinks. I think I avoided it because, in the photos on the table, the ""special"" sodas look like nothing more than bottles of Jones Soda knockoffs. I like Jones, but it's not amazing. Besides, when I hear the term ""old-fashioned soda,"" I'm thinking of hand-pulled egg creams and lime rickeys. But I guess they call it BOTTLES+Burgers for a reason.

Still, if they're taking suggestions, it would be great if B+B became sort of like the restaurant version of Rocket Fizz, selling a wide variety of lesser-known (or less-available) drinks. Surely the valley's many soda fiends would love to be able to go out to eat and get something more exotic than a Jarritos or IBC. (Locally made Joe's Cola, with that hint of honey taste, or Fresh Ginger Ale, with the pulpy ginger bits, would be my top choices.)

I wouldn't mind more non-alcoholic milkshake options, either. I'm sure the standard choc/van/straw offerings are tasty given the quality of the rest of the fare (there is a daily special, but on today's visit it was just double chocolate), but I still dream of BLT's Nut Job milkshake, and I loathe BLT in every other way. Not to get greedy, but if B+B had even a fraction of Cheeburger Cheeburger's shake/malt (malt!) selection, I wonder if I'd still be able to just walk in and get a table without a wait. Summer is coming. A more inventive shake (or malt!) selection for all ages would be a great break from the oppressive heat.

But again, this is a great restaurant, casual for any time of group yet aesthetically pleasing and creative. The servers are friendly; the owner often checks up on tables to make sure all is well; their social marketing presence is useful and personal, and the food is just screaming tasty.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,5,7,5,I1Z8n0NwwQEdGS1AM7oM8g
2261614,2012-02-22,0,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"I came here for a pre-fixe menu for Valentine's Day. It was actually pretty fun.  It's a casual place, don't expect anything fancy.  Diner type tables and decor.

We started out with the cheese and charcuterie plate, which was pretty good.  Nice prosciutto.  The brie it came with was a little boring.  Next we had the garden of Eden salad, which was pretty tasty.  A nice light salad with lots of vegetables.  

Then we got to try three different sliders: blazin', BBQ pork, and Mama's meatball.  The BBQ pork blew them all away.  Yummy, tender goodness. The blazin' was pretty good, but just a typical slider with bacon.  The Mama's meatball was bland and hard to eat.  A round meatball in a tiny bun with a little bit of tomato sauce is not the best idea in the world.

They also gave us regular fries and sweet potato fries (what they call Southern fries) with some sort of pink dipping sauce.  I'm usually a fry fiend, but these things were not too good.

The dinner came with samplings of the Double Helix wine - sparking wine, chardonnay, and zinfandel.  I wouldn't recommend it.  Definitely get something else besides the house wine. 

The best part was the Hostess with the Mostess adult milkshake.  They blend a Hostess cupcake with ice cream and cake flavored vodka.  It sounds disgusting, but it was actually pretty amazing.  

It looks like they have a strong beer selection on tap.  A dedicated kegerator for Stella and some selections from Stone and other craft brews.  Service was good and enthusiastic.  I definitely want to come back to try more of the adult milkshakes and other booze.  Maybe a few sliders.  Glad its in the neighborhood.",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,6,1,4,-DZqwl8_-hdDq6bLwNVAUA

When we saw the waiter bringing the $26 ""carafe"" for the 3 of us, we knew it was going to be trainwreck sangria. We each got a tumbler with something that tasted like watered down Sprite with a couple itty bitty pieces of fruit then the waiter poured red wine into them. From the alleged carafe that was maybe 12oz. Dear B&B, have you been to Firefly?, Tommy Bahama?, Gordon Biersch? THAT'S sangria. The restaurant itself has a nice design. The music- with the exception of Mary J. Blige's Real Love- was a downer. A total mismatch to the vibe of the restaurant. As far as the menu, this was one of the few times in my life that I had a hard time deciding... not because there were so many awesome prospects that I couldn't settle on but because I would've rather had an In-N-Out or Five Guys, after reading my options. Over & over. Hoping there was something I'd overlooked. One of my g.f.'s got the sweet bacon bleu burger, our other g.f. & I got Stan's Italian job (?) sliders & we shared fellini fries & Baltimore fries. Our entrees were good but nothing that would solely get us back in the door. On their own, the fellini fries would've been good (minus the warm parmesan/mayo'y tasting dipping sauce) but the Baltimore fries stole their thunder. When we got to B&B, were pretty shocked by how few fellow diners were there with us on a Saturday evening... by the time we left, we understood why.",hd343st7cOIUSfAd5r0U7A,1,1,2,5KBazd5N-ZkNdFufxnIjCg
2604350,2012-06-02,2,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"Stopped in around 8pm last night after shopping for Prom accessories with my niece. Hostess was friendly and informed us of a 10 minute wait asking if we wanted to leave a phone number to shop which I thought was very nice, but we chose to wait on a comfy couch as my feet were hurting from shopping in heels. 

Mija & I perused menu while waiting less than 10 minutes. We were asked if a booth was ok and seated at a large and comfortable booth in back. Previous reviewers have knocked the decor, but I liked the industrial feel to black walls & high ceilings and those big red booths. 

Our server arrived promptly and was very courteous. We ordered immediately: a to go Lobster Roll (which I intended as a treat for my Dad, more on that later) Repo Man for me (small, expensive but packing a punch) a strawberry milkshake for Mija (small, expensive but she LOVED it). I had the veggie burger and Mija build your own with cheddar and avocado. 

My veggie burger is pictured: I found it to be very good, but impossible to eat without fork and knife as it was very loosely packed and almost undercooked (no sear on outside) however it was very moist and tasty and anything but run of the mill (4*s) the bun was a brioche but rather greasy for my taste. Accompanying chips were great. One thing I truly missed was a pickle: how are you going to serve burgers and no pickle?! Mija's burger was cooked to a perfect medium and she proclaimed it ""bomb"" Service was attentive though I did have to ask once for water refills. As in previous reviews, I have to agree that there did appear to be a large number of staff on the floor. 

There were a couple of odd instances that occurred at nearby tables: a woman knocked her chair over and took out an entire tables worth of a poor waiters tray with it: immediately several staff members rallied to clean up and even reassured the visibly shaken woman that ""it happens all the time"" thought that was nice. Then, a very pregnant lady with her husband and toddler were seated across from us in another booth. Both the husband (and I) said ""she can't fit in there comfortably"" and then, oddly, she tried and when they asked for another spot the hostess replied ""yes but I'll have to check where because I'm not sure how to work who's table is up next!"" strange thing to say, almost like she was thinking out loud. 

Here is where my Pet Peeve-omoter kicks in: the waiter boxed our leftovers & I was perusing bill. It was $49 & change with a $1 ""to go"" charge added for Lobster Roll. Personally, at a ""premium"" joint, I found this to be tacky. When I got home and looked at the ""lobster roll"" my heart sank. It was literally minuscule on a brioche the size of a golf ball! The claw meat was so tiny I was convinced it wasn't lobster at all. (see photo) tasted it pre run this morning and it was not at all what I was expecting: very little ""lobster"" lots of peppers:filler..not at all the juicy succulent New England/Hamptons Lobstah Roll. Sadly, it went into the trash. 

So, we had some hits: service, atmosphere, shake & we both enjoyed the burgers. I do however agree that for the price, you are not receiving bang for your buck. Burger Bar, LBS are better value IMHO. Lobster Roll a complete miss. 

I'd go back for sure, there are several salads that sound divine (particularly a pear/walnut ensemble) and I enjoy Tivoli as a nearby destination to shop, listen to music etc. 

Hopefully they will work out the kinks. I rounded up from 2.5 to 3 because I see potential here and have been searching out ""the perfect veggie burger"" for a while now. As a former vegan & mainly pescetarian, a great veggie burger will make me loyal beyond compare.",eZfHm0qI8A_HfvXScwIYsg,4,2,3,JVThHvdmzX4wsdsCohh3eA

We were initially greeted with a reception of ""oh crap, another customer"" at 7:00 pm, then no server for ten minutes, then no drink for five more and then after asking, told they were out of it.

 After requesting a server to come to the table, the bartender sent the bar back, to serve us. He, was totally inexperienced, and had the personality of a wet mop.  We had to coach him through the ordering process. Again after asking for our originally ordered drink we were told ""Oh, we don't have any coffee"". 

After asking for a manager, she  came out and totally looked uninterested and then left. Never to return. 

Had lousy service to follow.

Upon leaving we asked to speak to the manager again. She came out of her office and said WE interrupted her. She said that they had a problem keeping employees and felt that they did the best to be expected. She said that the reason we could not get a coffee was because they had none. Their order did not come the day before. (wouldn't you tell your staff that?). She had no explanation for the continued poor service.  Even her own.

Anyway, she said she heard we were rude to the staff and had no apology, and gave us the owner's email address and washed her hands of it.

The service was just okay. I was eating at the bar at it took about 6 minutes before anyone approached me with a menu. He never gave me any silverware when my food arrived.

The slaw had a great flavor. The fries tasted like larger, thicker In N Out fries! It was just the right amount of food and it came out quickly. I had a glass of Zinfandel to go with for 6 bucks, and it was a nice size glass. All of the happy hour wine was good quality, and you definitely got a good deal on a nice wine.

Although B&B is decent, I was somewhat deflated after the experience and hoped for just a touch better.  First, their menu is pretty enticing.  I've never tried short ribs stuffed into a burger before, so I went for it.  I even ordered a Cesar salad and some fried risotto to start.  My other half ordered the classic burger and we shared some parmesan fries.  First off, the cesar was just a salad, nothing special, something bottled, so we weren't impressed.  Next, the fried risotto balls were okay, but they weren't something I'd go nuts over or dream about.

Here's the kicker.

I was hoping that my first short rib stuffed burger experience would be great.  Unfortunately, it was just okay. I think if they mixed the short ribs in to the burger patty, it would've been a better result.  In the end it was okay, but not something I'd come back for over and over again.

We decided to try the soda fountain, so we ordered an old fashioned soda.  It came in a bottle.  I was somewhat confused because I assumed the soda counter had the club soda and the syrups to mix by order, but I guess not.  Oh well.

3248222,2011-12-29,1,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"I'd been keeping tabs on this place for some months and waiting for them to open, so when we found ourselves out in the area of Tivoli Village and needing a meal, I was pleased to see that Bottles & Burgers had finally arrived. Today, it turns out, was their first official day of opening -- having unofficially kicked things off with some freebie food on the preceding two days. I was even happier after we glanced over the menu and both my picky self and my vegetarian wife found many appealing options.

We decided not to hold back and ordered the ""Pearfection"" salad to share. We also shared a serve of the beer rings and Helix Fries with our burgers. The wife got a Veg-Out burger and I went with the Block 16 with chipotle aioli.

The first things to arrive were our salads - Before you say ""but wait, Michael, didn't you just say you shared a salad"" -- the people in the kitchen evidently decided to split our salad into individual bowls (very thoughtful!) so we each had a half sized Pearfection salad, complete with spiced, grilled pears, walnuts, some sort of leafy greens, and a delicious vinaigrette. The salad was really intriguing and made a mockery of my problematic relationship with pears. These were not at all mushy as you'd expect from a pear that's been anywhere near a heat source, but remained crisp and light. The walnuts added some real complexity and I had soon cleaned my bowl.

My burger was cooked just as I had requested and at a mere $9 was, to my mind, an absolute bargain. Yes, sure, you don't get any fries or sides with your burgers here, but at only $4 for the quite outstandingly spiced and cooked Helix Fries, it's still a great deal considering this is easily the best burger I have eaten in five years in the Las Vegas Valley. A few days ago I paid $18 for a ""HK Burger"" at Fleur at Mandalay Bay, but this burger from B&B knocked that one into a cocked hat - at half the price. The meat was delicious, the aioli added that bit of moisture without turning things into a dripping mess, and the brioche bun was that perfect mixture of freshness and denseness, maintaining its shape throughout the experience. The burger isn't a monster, but it's hardly ""slider sized"" as some have suggested - think ""larger than a Big Mac, but not as big as a double whopper"" (and a lot better tasting than both).

The onion rings were good, but I felt they were superfluous to our experience and I probably wouldn't order them again. They tasted good and I appreciated the presentation, but I usually prefer slightly thinner cut rings than these monsters. your view may differ. I think part of my problem was that I just couldn't stop eating the fries!

As this was only their first day of full opening, there were a few understandable glitches. The speciality sodas aren't due in until tomorrow so we couldn't sample those. Also the brownies to be featured in one of the fascinating sounding deserts were also not available at this time. We also had a minor issue where the order didn't print out quite right and our onion rings were delayed - despite all this, the staff handled everything to perfection. No fewer than three managerial types came past and asked us about our experience and our waiter apologised profusely for the glitches and suggested alternatives for unavailable menu items. In a couple of days, when they have ironed everything out, I can see this level of service really turning a trip here into a meal to remember.

Bottles & Burgers is a really great addition to the pretty, but otherwise pretty spartan, Tivoli Village. These are some high-end burgers at a fraction of the price you'd pay at some less impressive Strip locations and the menu offers enough variety and customisation features to keep any burger fan coming back for more.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,2,1,5,x7XskLAbX3cnRmbacKFyKQ

The servers, bartenders, etc. all looked kind of young. The bartender was leaning up against the counter talking to (I think?) a customer all night long. Only once did I see her elbows come off the counter.

Our server eventually made his way over, smiled, seemed moderately friendly, and took our order. We split two starters (lobster rolls and a mexican dog), and shared two burgers (black & bleu and block 16) along with sweet potato fries.

I have nothing against the price... it's expensive rent at Tivoli, and the food was all great. Burgers were cooked precisely to order, everything tasted fine. It shouldn't be too much of a challenge, given that the restaurant wasn't busy and the menu is pretty straightforward.

We just kept getting bad vibes from the service. No one asked, 'how is everything'? We had to ask for share plates to split apps (something they should have provided without us asking), and I had to wait a long time for a refill, finally getting someone's attention just as they were taking their phone out of their pocket. Note to servers - don't take out your phone while working on the floor.

It seemed like there was no manager on duty, that the kids were left alone to run the place. They would gather together, seem to joke around, not really being useful as servers to the paying customers. 

At the end, despite all that, as we were leaving, the very same hostess managed to cut off her conversation with two other employees and smile, saying 'thanks for coming, have a nice night.' At least there was that...",oPLAdhhC6XudE6CPTSFVyg,0,0,2,KmL2wgJYnR4TPUJhEp2o_A

For starters, the mascarpone and white truffle aioli added a lot of richness to an otherwise bland arancini ($8) dish. The DV tacos ($9), however, were delicious with their tender chunks of flavorful beef atop flour tortillas.

The sweet bacon bleu burger ($9, certified angus beef, sweet onion marmalade, bleu cheese, arugula, roasted tomatoes, applewood bacon) was tasty but the bun was too small in comparison to the large, juicy patty. The Fellini fries ($4) were solid, especially if you're a fan of truffle oil.

They've got a wide range of shakes (virgin and the adult variety) and floats, not to mention beer and wine. I tried a Blue Moon float (Blue Moon and orange sherbet) which sounded better than it tasted.

My biggest complaint is about the service. It drives me crazy when waiters don't write down orders. I don't care how good they think their memories are, they have a pen and paper for a reason. So, of course our waiter doesn't write our orders down, walks away, then comes back twice to ask us about our order. I'm not sure if the guy was new or not, but he seemed to be overwhelmed by everything. All the more reason to write stuff down.

Service: We sat in the bar booths.  Our waitress came by right away to take our drink order and wanted to take our food order, but we had barely looked at the menu.  We told her we needed a few minutes to decide, and then she didn't come back for almost 15 minutes!

Food: I very much enjoyed my veggie burger and the order of Baltimore Fries (read: fries smothered in brown gravy).  My husband, however did not enjoy his bacon and bleu burger.  He ordered it medium rare and it came out well done.  No pink at all.  The bacon was burnt and too crispy for a burger.  You could tell the bacon had just been sitting back in the kitchen.  The burgers were $9 and came with a small serving of potato chips, which I thought was a fair price.  The fries, however, were $5 and such a small serving!  Disappointing.  Also disappointing were the drinks.  I ordered their take on an Old Fashioned which didn't resemble an Old Fashioned at all.  It was really basically just a bourbon and ginger.  And it was $10!!  Man, I can go down to the Strip and get a better drink for that price.  This is a burger place!  In a shopping mall!  $10 for a drink?  Oh, and the sliders are $8 for TWO of them.  Are you kidding me?  This place is flat out too expensive.

Setting:  If you sit in the bar booths, be very careful because the bottom of the booths are extremely raw and sharp!  I was wearing skinny jeans and flat, so my ankles were exposed.  At one point my ankle grazed the bottom of the booth and it hurt!  I thought, ""Geez, they need to sand down the edges or something.""  When I got home, I realized my ankle was still stinging.  I looked down and there was dried blood on my ankle!!  The booth freaking cut me!!

Valet:  When you walk out of the restaurant, it is located right next to the valet parking lot.  As my husband and I were crossing the street, a valet driver came screaming out of the lot like a bat out of hell and literally drove straight toward me, slamming on the brakes and stopping just inches from me.  I am not exaggerating.  I looked at him and cursed at him.  He didn't respond, just slammed on the gas as soon as I stepped out of the way and then he cut off another car.  What a horribe valet driver!  No remorse for almost hitting me or cutting off another vehicle.

Lackluster food/drink and a near death experience left a bad taste in my mouth.  Not sure if I'd go back.",QPREECpJrp8Dj3_TK22oqg,4,2,2,MNAo4XrK8STAGr8W92CO_w

Good decision.
It was 7 on a Saturday night, and honestly, the place was a little empty. Kinda strange I thought, but whatever, we got seated right away.
Good selection of beers, draft and bottle, tons of wine options, full and half bottles. They have a nice house Double Helix Chardonnay as well as a good, light house Double Helix lager on draft.

The burger selection was good, plus you can build your own. Would be nice to have more topping choices for the BYO, but they have the basics covered.

I had the sweet bleu bacon burger, nicely cooked, great toasted brioche bun. Fries were server in one of those conical stand with the faux newspaper wrapper, keeps those bad boys hot through the entire meal. And at no time every do I consider a 1/2 pound burger small. It was cooked perfectly and definitely big enough.

We got a side salad too, and the one annoying thing about that was the plate it was served on was a small rectangle shape and every time you forked a bite, stuff went flying all over the place, a bit annoying. Guys, serve it a larger plate or put it in a bowl!

When we left around 8pm and there may have been 4 people in the entire place...the guy at the bar looked like he was about to cry, sorry man, it's gonna be a long night for ya! Too bad, hopefully it picks up for them, I'd go back for sure.",CwzhFRwIkYFGkaggG0sTlA,0,1,4,SFLn5R8abX91c_zbUcWZ6A

I'm a lightweight so I can tell when there is alcohol or no alcohol in my drinks. For my meal I had the pluck university stuffed which was ground chicken stuffed with mozzarella with a red chili chutney, slaw and a taro bun. Sounds good on paper, right? It fell apart immediately and I had to eat it with a knife and fork, and the chutney was too strong for this ""burger"". My sweet potato fries were burnt, not edible. The entire table got a different order of fries so we could all try them, the gravy fries were probably the best. 

Our server needed some extra training, we had a table of 7 girls, he acted very scared to approach us, he would drop stuff and run, as if he was nervous to ask if we needed anything else. Not sure if he is new or what, but needs some people skills. The overall con census at the table was this place isn't worth it.

I learned after a while that this was an accommodation:  she's in a wheelchair and Happy Hour is only in the bar area, which has high stools and booths.  Neither one works for her, so we were in the front dining area.  She said it was handled graciously and wasn't an issue.  Score one for the restaurant.

She was too hungry to wait for my arrival, so she ordered the goat cheese appetizer - a mound of the cheese, surrounded by home-made potato chips.  Individually, they were both terrific, but together just doesn't work.  The chips are so light and thin that they can't be used to scoop the cheese, and even the little spoon supplied doesn't work; the chip just crumbles instantly.  The tasty goat cheese deserves a different pairing.

We ordered a Build Your Own Burger from the regular menu, adding only avocado.  The burger wasn't overly large, but there was a good amount of avocado.  The burger came with -- more chips!  But the bun was the smallest I've ever seen, not much bigger than a slider bun.  We were sharing the burger since, apparently, my friend eats like a bird, and neither of us would have eaten a whole bun anyway.  Still, you'll get full from a burger from TGIF, but here you'll have to order other stuff.  

I had their Sangria, made from a ""Special Recipe.""  When I tried to find out what was in it, the waitress said she doesn't know, it changes all the time, whatever the bartender wants to throw into it.  It was very good, and indeed, the second glass didn't taste exactly like the first!

We wanted some fries so we ordered the Fellini Fries. The fries were yummy with the truffle aioli but there wasn't enough aioli for all of the fries. The aioli only filled up the lower bottom of the sauce cup. I think they should at least fill the cup half way. The aioli is what makes the fries tasty so they shouldn't be stingy with it.

Another case of an unfocused restaurant trying to please everyone.  The decor is cool, retro chic.  They offer retro sodas, drinks, and even ""adult"" milkshakes.  Great.  The problem, nothing makes these gourmet burgers and fries taste as good as wine.  The food is so wine centric, playing off the natural acidity and refreshing, clean fruit finish  that drinking anything else doesn't work.  If you are a wine lover, this place elevates the humble burger and fries to a new level of enjoyment.

For beef lovers, the double helix stuffed burger is excellent.  A traditional burger stuffed with very flavorful braised short ribs and finished with horseradish.  Juicy, beefy goodness.  For veggie lovers, the quinoa and mushroom burger with charred tomatoes watercress cheddar cheese and an explosively flavorful rosemary aioli is a must try.  Even this hard core carnivore loved it.

The fries, while not the crispiest or fluffiest, come with toppings and dips that make them good eats.  Parmesan with truffle aioli. 

Small selection of fresh but simple salads (the salad of poached pear, fresh mozzarella and candies walnuts on a bed of arugula with the vanilla infused champagne vinaigrette is outstanding; creamy, peppery, tart, sweet and a nice play of textures).

Note:  If you are not enjoying some wine or other calorie laden drink, you will find the portions small.

The local service (as opposed to the [insert adjective] service of the Strip) is quick and friendly.

Very good selection of well priced half bottles.  

Great concept that would benefit from some editing and relocation to the Strip.  Great for wine lovers but not worth the drive for the casual Vegas visitor or those living in Henderson for the food alone.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,7,5,4,sawOO2VBvp5UwaTyDlyBRQ

Cucumber Martini $6
It was a gin Martini with a cucumber twist.  I have been on a gin kick recently so this was the perfect happy hour drink for me.  It was the perfect blend to go with my food.  

DH Draft $2
I wasn't sure what was on tap because this was my husband's drink and I didn't steal a sip, but $2 bucks is a pretty damn good price and he seemed to enjoy it.   

Sampler $23 - Thyme wings, fancy hot dog, sliders, delicious fries, quesadilla, It was pretty much happy hour happiness.  Each of the different food items came with a different dipping sauce which I think was my favorite part.  What can I say...I'm a dipper.  My husband and I ate most of the food because our friend had a buffet for lunch earlier and just wanted to hang out, but it could have easily feed all three of us.

The facility that B&B is located in is beautiful.  For those of you yelpers familiar with LA it is a little bit like a Mini Grove in Las Vegas with easier parking and hotter/colder temps outside (depending on what time of year you come).

I had the ""Block 16"" which includes sharp cheddar. The burgers seem small compared to the gigantic versions you get at other restaurants, but they are actually the right size, I believe. The bun tasted good and didn't steal the show. The homemade potato chips were large and not over-salted. I could have eaten a larger portion of those and skipped the fries. The garlic fries were yummy but not special at all. The burger was oh, so juicy! Juicy the way my dad used to make them when I was a kid- that man is a genius in the kitchen. 

The decor of the place is pleasant, industrial chic, brightly colored but still sophisticated. The booth was comfortable. The flatscreen TVs were unobtrusive and all showed sports events. I liked that they showed a variety, including Lacrosse, instead of having all the TVs show the same channel.

The servers were friendly (although the hostess came off coldly) and added to the nice experience.  As I'm not much of a meat eater I can't say I'll be back any time soon, but I'd suggest this place to friends wanting a burger cooked nicely, in a pleasant environment.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,0,0,4,rDXj4Xoeh8mmOeKnbi3pqw
5583187,2012-03-26,0,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"Having been disappointed by the many ""gourmet burger"" places I arrived at Bottles and Burgers with high hopes but deep inside expecting to be disappointed.  I mean whenever you tag the word burger with the word gourmet it seems that means over priced and poorly executed as was my experience with the burger bar which is both overpriced and poorly executed with inattentive wait staff, small portions and unwieldy dining area. But I digress, this is a review of Bottles and Burgers, one of the more delightful food choices in Las Vegas.  

To begin, the atmosphere is like that of an upscale 50's diner.  One bar for the adults and a milkshake bar for the kids.  Yes, you can bring your kids and seat them at the bar!.  You also won't miss the big game as they had several flat screens scattered around the bar area.  I had checked out the menu on line but the prices aren't available so I expected this to be another 20 dollar burger place.  Boy was I wrong.  The burgers are reasonably priced between $8.00 and $15.00 with the $15.00 burger stuffed with ribs.  You can also make your own burger starting at $7.00 with a $1.00 per topping charge.  The meat is all Angus.  We tried the Sweet Bacon Blue and the Bootlegger after an appetizer of arancini (fried Risotto balls with truffle oil)  We also got the Baltimore Fries (gravy and cheese).  The Risotto balls were perfect, even my 7 1/2 year old loved them.  The Sweet Bacon Blue is a must have, cooked perfectly.  The Bootlegger was a little blander than I could have hoped but still quite tasty.   We wanted to try the Double Helix (burger stuffed with ribs) but we can only eat so much in one visit.  They also have interesting salads (try pearfection) and sliders to try our next visit.

The service was excellent.  Our waiter Eric was the best, not just because he has a great name or that he looks like Wilmer Valderrama but because he was honest, attentive and informative.  He even brought us an extra scoop of icecream for my birthday desert because we couldn't decide between vanilla or white chocolate caramel.

Bottles and Burgers just misses the 5 star category for one reason.  The portions seem a little small. To me they were just right because I am dieting and also always seem to have leftovers at the larger burger places like Islands or Fuddruckers, but it was the one complaint I observed and I can't argue with it.  Still, with wine we got out of there with a party of three for about $50.00 which isn't bad for the great meal we had.  Definitely worth a return visit for that Double Helix.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,3,1,4,gcs65G98iz9bEt0htNgl2Q

I hate the ""Bottles and Burgers by Double Helix"" name.  First off, when I hear bottles and burgers i think beer and beef and buns, not wine and beef and buns.  They have wine pairings for the friggin french fries for crying out loud?  Please.  Stop.  

I know that the 16 dollar burger joints are all the rage, but stop with the wine pairings and upscalifying of it.  If you're gonna charge that much for a burger and then $4.50 for an order of fries they better be badass.  My burger was overcooked and underseasoned  and underwhelming.  Not bad, but small and overly precious.

I also hate when joints like this serve their food on a fancy plate to make it look fancy.  They have these fry server things with a sauce receptacle that makes an order of fries 18 inches tall and all fancy-looking.  Problem is there's only 20 fries and the fancy aioli sucked in spite of the special serving containter.  Fries with champagne and shallots?  No thanks.

So, the concept is wrong.  The value is not there.  The portion sizes are laughable.  The food is ok at best.  The room is schizophrenic.  Is it a bar, a restaurant, a soda fountain?  The accoustics stunk and the room stunk.

One last beef.  What's with the ""by Double Helix"" in the name?  Is that a household name?  Is that a signifier of quality dining?  Is that a trustable brand that everyone recognizes?  Nope.  It's a struggling wine bar for tourists @ a casino that 99 percent of locals don't know about  and a newly opened, lame rehash of a wine bar @ Town Square.  Don't get ahead of yourselves, rich guy restanteurs.  You haven't proven anything yet except that you have enough money to burn to open a few restaurants.

Check out Shake Shack in New York if you want to see how this idea should be executed.",xymN6nkSGPL4A2D3C2DuaQ,3,3,2,VbrOrO6PfmcafiUyBulOdQ

I have started to use Open Table for reservations with varying degrees of success. the first time I booked here, I received a phone call shortly afterwards to tell me they could not seat us. This time I tried again, I waited for my phone call to cancel me but it didn't come. Good! Off we go.

We arrive on time and are seated immediately. Nice.

We order some drinks and some wings for an appetizer. Wings were a little crispy, I am not sure if that was the intent. OK, only OK.

Wifee, myself and teenager ordered Burgers. I took the one with lobster, $5 extra for a tiny piece of crustacean and sauce. Hum? Wifee had Turkey and teen built his own. The burgers were good, cooked medium and a good size. But it's $5 extra for fries. Burgers , in my opinion, should be served with fries NOT soggy potato chips. I believe it is complete gouging to charge 50% of the burger price for the fries.

Smaller son had kids chicken fingers and fries and it was ok but the portion was small.

So 3 burgers, 1 kids meals 2 wine, 2 beer and 2 sodas $100 . Too much, food was ok but I can spend $100 on better.

This place was way overrated the service was terrible.   I shouldn't spend $16.00 for just a burger ala cart and still leave the place hungry.   It wont be missed!",fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,0,0,1,p5_GpCL3fOwx9Y0qKBUffg
5928929,2012-10-21,1,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"My husband and I came to Tivoli Village for the first time today. After checking out the Farmer's Market and noticing that there were only a few shops to browse through, we decided to stay for lunch. On a side note, I do see a lot of potential for this place. It reminds me of something I would see in my old hometown of Irvine, CA. Hopefully when the economy recovers, more stores will open up and it will be a great place to shop, eat, and hang out.

We wanted to eat at Leone Cafe, but after seeing how crowded it was, we walked down a bit further and found ourselves between Brio Tuscan Grille and Bottles & Burgers. Brio also looked like it was filling up pretty quickly, so we decided to try this place out. We sat on the patio since the weather was so nice.

Our server Andre was very friendly and attentive. He explained the menu very well, making suggestions from their most popular gourmet burgers, adult milkshakes, and he gave detailed descriptions of their desserts. I ordered the Blazin' Sliders (comes with 2), which were great! The Angus ground chuck was very juicy and cooked well. The bacon and guacamole also made them very tasty. The sliders came with their regular hand cut fries, which weren't very good. Most of it was soggy and didn't have much taste. I suggest ordering any of the other fries that they have on the menu, which look more delicious! My husband ordered the Double Helix BBQ burger and really enjoyed it. He said it was one of the best burgers he had ever eaten and that it was ""life changing."" lol. I gotta admit, it did look like a great burger because they put BBQ Short Rib on top of the Angus beef. My only complaint here was the plate they used for the sliders. It gets messy when you eat burgers and the small rectangular plates are not a good fit for that. Bigger plates please?

For dessert, we ordered the Opera Cake, which was excellent. It was kind of like a Tiramisu, but with more chocolate. Thin layers of chocolate cake and a hint of coffee bisque. Not too sweet and yummy! Also served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream. My only complaint here was that our scoop of ice cream kept moving around on our plate because they put it on top of a bed of whipped cream. 

Not a bad find. Prices were reasonable as well.  I would like to come back to try the BBQ Pork Sliders and more desserts! According to their website, two out of the three patios that they have are pet friendly. Yay! I wont have to worry about bringing my dog along next time!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,2,4,4,uJ_Fj7CGbBZe3fy3NPWy7w
5944388,2012-05-11,0,eDn45jTzYgCXhG4a_1wykQ,"I came here the other day with my cousin to check out the happy hour. I gotta say when I heard bottles I thought beer bottles, not wine bottles. So I was a little disappointed by the beer selection here. I'm a huge microbrew fan so I was hoping to try some local Vegas brews, but alas, it wasn't meant to be. We tried some of their blended drinks and the peach bellini was totally yummers!! The banana one was too banana-y. We had the bacon and bleu cheese burgers with chips and they were pretty good. The appetizer fries (I forgot what they were called) were awesome!! And they were hella cheap during happy hour. I highly recommend those!! This place was nice to check out, but I'm gonna need them to step up their drink selection before I come around again.",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,1,0,3,rjGNd8xZ52JuZiYIQuMugA
