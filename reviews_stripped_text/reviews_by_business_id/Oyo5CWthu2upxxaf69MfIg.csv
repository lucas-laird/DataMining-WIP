The lunch special menu is very inexpensive, only $5, and you get both quality and quantity. The food is made fresh and served hot. The rice plates, vegetables and noodles are all great. You must get a drink to wash it all down. I recommend the passion fruit green tea and milk tea boba...so refreshing! Also, you must try their turnip cake. It's the best I've ever had. Great consistency, crispy outside and overall delicious. If you're not full by the end of the meal, take a Chinese waffle to go. It's a tasty treat. I visit Vegas often and crave Chinese food...I've eaten at Anna's Garden four times in the past two weekends!!!",tTMSzXgn0STBxJz6Vf2eWg,0,0,5,GCi0Jp3_uyOQuzUuF7BTNQ

The bf and I grabbed dinner here last night and heres what we got: shrimp w/ baby bok choy, salt and pepper fish, and beef and mushroom w/ onions. Everything was deelish.Although I didn't try the beef dish since I dont eat meat, I figured my bf liked it. He gets the same thing all the time.

The reason for the star deduction is because the service was turtle slow. I guess partly because a bus full of Asian tourists decided to unload and dine there and the only server we had went ape shit then disappeared. I mean the whole restaurant was completely packed in less than 2 minutes..it was quite a scene.  But I don't blame him, I probably would've gone bananas too. Overall, the food is good and I would gladly come back here again.",kDUoBp9SgJSeS7-5443k5A,0,0,4,cJpx-jjLv-bo7kBBP9roHQ
747985,2010-03-29,0,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"Went with the bf for a weekday lunch. We read about the $5 lunch specials and heard from a friend it was good. Well the place was packed. We only waited about 5 min before we were seated. They have so many choices I would sugest going with a group so you can try more items. We ordered 3 items, way too much food for 2 people and my bf is a big eater! We had enough to take home for a second meal.
We ordered the beef stew curry, sauce was tasty the meat pieces were a mostly tender with good flavor, although I am not sure what part some of them came from.  Beef and black bean chow fun, tates like most places chow fun. And the salty fried pork chops, they were all they said they were, salty, fried, pork chops! Great for when you are craving something salty. we wanted to try the hot pot, but the waitress all but told us we couldn't order it. She told us it would take a very long time at least 20 min. and she kept asking if we knew what it was.
All in all they have a huge selection of better than decent food. It is not spectacular, but pretty good and for the price and quantity it is worth a try!",BpV-KsJG8ojaT13JIzG8KA,1,1,4,JIILbXPJDTp0XTSnIO-q0w
758738,2009-06-17,0,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"I totally agree with Yelper Heinz comment. Vegas was in desperate need of a HK style cafe and I've been craving it ever since I've moved here from L.A and for all of those that lives in L.A. you have something to be very thankful for. It's HK cafe paradise in L.A compared to Vegas. Anna's Garden did meet those cravings. Food was tasty and the price was not bad at all, the staff was very attentive and friendly. The decor was okay not as fancy and modern as some of those you've been to in L.A. There was three of us and we order 6 dishes and all was good except the steamed fish wit black bean sauce. Just don't order fish at a chinese restaurant if you don't see a fresh fish tank there. It was a couple of fish fillet sitting on cubes of tofu with some chinese greens, the taste was there but not very satisfying. Other dishes we had were Jellyfish appetizer, fried chicken wings, seafood udon, beef chow fun, and honey with walnut shrimp... all tasty.  You also get a house soup of the day along with the meal. I might be a regular if another cafe don't open up soon! O... they also serve dim sum all day.... have yet to try that!",XybrvLEZUD6lJpsy5P3gSA,1,0,4,AUmTBiRvu2Lyp_TOC1Yl-A
856522,2010-05-16,0,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"I go to Anna's as you can't really beat the price for lunch.  Taste is ok.  If you go there for dinner, it is pretty empty and the prices are ""normal"" prices.  I guess I probably would not go there again for dinner as I find there are much better places for dinner for about the same price. 

I think the service is mediocre, and what's more I dislike the owner.  I think she's a complete idiot and a snob.  Three times (twice by phone, and once in person) I would ask a question and get the wrong answer.   Very simple questions like, do they take a certain credit card, or like what time does the lunch special end?  She should not be answering the phones!  If the lunch prices weren't so cheap, I wouldn't go there.",wcah6DV2AjuVDacc8Kb-DA,1,1,3,9m6-jyJBFpDumenGrlNdbQ

Excellent service and staff.   The thing i like most about this place was their drink.  This is a cafe style restaurant which you do not see a lot in Las Vegas.  I'm from California and I'm use to seeing cafe style places.

Mid-day lunch deals are all the trend amongst the chinese restaurant competition in the Chinatown area.

As soon we ordered, the chefs or cooks came out to eat their dinner and this waiter joined in with them. Needless to say, the food we ordered came to us one dish at a time, and the waiting time for each dish was about 5 minutes between. The food was OK, nothing fancy, service was not so good which is very typical of Chinese restaurant. Will we go again? Probably.

2036200,2009-11-10,0,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"Okay so you think why the hell are you eating at Anna's Garden in Las Vegas when all these nice restaurants in Vegas are around?

Well if you go to Vegas often you gotta try different places and you can't afford to eat nice meals everyday...and you definitely don't wanna eat buffets everyday....

So I land here with my friend who is now a local in Vegas...
The food is pretty plain HK style Cafe food much like you can get throughout Los Angeles.  

So trying to compare this to the same style restaurants in LA is no comparison.  

The plus side is they have Dim Sum all day long...bad thing is we ordered the spareribs to go from the Dim Sum menu and it took forever!!!!!  It almost thought they forgot about us.

It's weird too their Green Onion Pancake is made outta WHEAT...what the heck!?!?!?

So we ordered a couple of the $5.00 dishes and two other things -- a whole roast duck and Chinese beef stew.  Everything was pretty good and I was not disappointed.  However, the roast pork was not as juicy and I would have liked.  I was crispy, but the meat was a little dry.  But all-in-all, it was pretty good.  I would go back again with more people when we return to Vegas in July.",v2WrKPkRI1TikXDKAi8VFw,0,0,4,vqu5e0i43ZB2iuVRFA_0Fw

2673271,2010-06-02,1,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"When I think of Chinese take-out, Anna's Garden is what comes to mind. I have only been here for their $5 lunch specials and have been utterly satisfied. They have so many choices, but I really like the salty pork, chow mein, and miscellaneous fried rice. I had a few friends try it and they were quite satisfied also.

Seating was quick even though I went with a decent sized group. Service was a little better than average, but they do get busy during their lunch special hours so it was expected. Drinks are not refillable; you're paying for one can.

I like that they let you actually ""take out"" the $5 specials. But, do NOT call it that when you go there; they refer to it as ""to go"".

I wish this location was a lot closer; I would go more often if it was.

Don't forget to take a copy of the lunch special menu (paper copy version). I highlight my favorites and keep the paper in my car for when hunger strikes!",2VABkVdFhHGMo7wAqfofGA,2,2,4,ksz4vFZMEiPvQRGJkWanHA

3334859,2010-12-30,0,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"I was delighted to find a Hong Kong style cafe in Vegas, which for a long time I thought were non-existent.  I've been here about 8 times and I've had mixed experiences.

The food here is dirt cheap, especially if you order the lunch special.  You can get stuff like baked pork chop rice, curry seafood, and wonton noodle soup for five dollars or less.  They also have some uniquely Hong Kong stuff like spareribs rice noodles (jiu cheng fung) and egg waffles. 

I've ordered the baked pork chop rice almost every time, as it is one of my favorite dishes (not from here, but in general).  And I'll have to say the BPCR from here is pretty unpredictable.  Some days it's pretty good, and on other days... PUKE!  Puke, mainly because all the ""pork chops"" on the rice are fat and bones, and you won't know until you bite into them as they are concealed by bright orange sauce. This happened  a couple of times when I ordered it. 

I guess if you are really craving BPCR, this is one of the few places (that I know of) in Vegas where you can get it.  And for 5 dollars it's worth a gamble that you may end up with a baked pork fat and bones rice. 

Another thing that's unpredictable is the boba milk tea.  I also get that a lot and it's usually fine, but the last time I was there the bobas weren't chewy.   They were like cake balls.  Yuck.  I suppose it's standard for cheap Asian restaurants to keep serving stuff that's gone old or bad.

I also wouldn't recommend their dinner menu.  It's ""regular"" priced and while it's not awful, nearby places like HK Star and KJ Kitchen have much better food overall.",8Djl-ak1mohpq36WRpnbyw,1,0,3,FPEWK2XOcisbRUSNrMGIww
3671557,2010-11-19,0,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"After visiting Anna's Garden a few times on 2 trips to Vegas in the last 3 months, I can firmly say 'two thumbs up'.  Each time I've gone has been a completely different experience.  (I suggest going for lunch before or after the typical lunch rush hours.)

The 1st time was with a Chinese friend and his parents.  They go every week and I was lucky enough to be invited along one time.  The 4 of us ordered 8 dishes so they could take home a bunch of left-overs for the week.  Obviously, they love Anna's... mostly because it's authentic and has no MSG!   

The 2nd time was with a group of non-Asian friends, English and Latin mostly.  Again, everyone really liked their food, especially since we went for lunch and most of the dishes we ordered ended up being only $5-$6 each!

The 3rd time was with a mixed group of friends, some Asian, some not.  Again, we went for lunch, though this time I knew to go later to avoid the rush.  We arrived at 2pm and it was perfect.  Again, everyone thought it was delicious.

So all in all, I've probably tried at least 15 dishes at Anna's in the last 3 visits.  My favorite is their pan-fried noodle with chicken and veggies.  It's the hard noodle that softens when you put the sauce on it.  I used to not like that dish much, preferring rice noodles to egg noodles but ahhh, how times have changed!

We ordered a set for 10 people. The order is one of those dinner set for 10 people. it has 8 different dinner entrees and we added an additional one. The menu said there was fish, but the what we got was a cheap plate of vegetables stir fried with 4/5 slices of fish (that's not even enough for 10 people). Also 3 of the 10 dishes wee the same. All three had green peas, mushroom and stir fried the same way. One was served with cashew, one with peanuts, one with some kind of other stuff. My guest were like WTF? 3 of the same stuff? 

just wow!

4060030,2011-04-22,0,Oyo5CWthu2upxxaf69MfIg,"Ended up here after trying to take my parents to Noodle Palace (they are closed for remodel apparently).

Since it was still early (about 10:30am) my dad was starving and my mom wanted wonton noodle soup- we ended up here since they were close by, OPEN, and had a lunch special, $5.95 for most of the dishes!

My mom and her cousin had the wonton noodle soup, I had the duck wonton noodle soup and dad had a pigs feet noodle dish.
My mom didn't complain, which is a good sign cause nothing is as good as her's.  
My dad enjoyed his but I thought the noodles needed more flavor.  He had some type of stewed pigs feet with egg noodle dish- the noodles were a little bland but nothing a little soy sauce didn't cure.  The pigs feet was flavorful and soft, fell off the bone.

I had the duck wonton noodle soup.  The soup was a little bland and the wonton was also a little bland but the shrimp in the wonton was firm and fresh.  The duck was the winner here...it was moist, thick and just the right amount of fattiness.

The duck was so good we ended up leaving with a whole duck to go!

I've had much better in So Cal but the Hainan chicken was a hit! The rice was so tasty, good portion of fresh chicken, yummy dipping sauce and pickled chicken may this entree a hit and all for $5.25

It's been a long time coming...  Vegas is in need of a good Hong Kong style cafe serving some yummy Cantonese fare.

But is it too good to be true!?!?  Ahh, Yes!

House Special hot pot ($5): Rice cooked in a ceramic bowl with chinese sausage. Tons of sausage, overall excellent. Love scraping the burnt rice off the sides.. mmmm

Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce ($5): Good portion. Fresh broccoli. Beautiful shade of green and perfectly steamed. Just the right amount of oyster sauce. Thumbs up. 

Spicy salt pork chops ($5): this sounded nasty to me, but my coworker insisted. Wow, this was freaking incredible. I'm officially hooked. Very salty, perfect amount of fry, and personally didn't encounter any sketchy chewy pieces of meat. Favorite dish of the day!

-1 star for the subpar shu mai. Stick to the $5 lunch menu, avoid the $2 dim sum menu! 60+ choices for $5? Incredible! Portions were great, and at least for now the service was great as well.",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,1,0,4,BKZ-QeNK-TdHuYOo77mPyg

I've also gotten their Hainan Chicken Rice (#2), Beef Chow Fun (#38) and Pork Rib in Black Bean Sauce Hot Pot Rice. They are all pretty good.
