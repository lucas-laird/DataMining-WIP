The charge more at night even though it doesn't say anywhere that this is a policy in placed. When I asked the waitress where it said this,  she said that it's no where. It's just a policy they have to charge more at night. They messed up my billing and my sister's. The math was done incorrectly even by her prices that seemed to be made up. We asked for an itemized receipt and she was overcharging us. All in all,  never coming back to this place again",aeXVjC8lHUjsesMMjvcwqw,0,0,1,lbkzWqmHhadtEdms1jIS2Q

The walls had Valentines decorations, even though its past Valentines and their decorations just look disorderly and dusty. And with only one couple seated in the whole restaurant and practically no foot traffic, you'd expect to find clean floors and tables, but the floors were dirty. 
But... I decided to try because it's so close to my house. Well, it appears that they get a lot of phone pick up orders, cause I had to wait about 25 minutes for my order since the were busy working on a large 30 pupusas order before they could get to my order. The waitress wasn't the warmest, so I took my food to go instead. 
The cheese and cheese/chicharron pupusas where good, although the accompanying curtido and salsa roja lacked in taste. I also tried some tamales de pollo which were a tad on the greasy side but they were decent in flavor. The platanos fritos were also to greasy. And yes, I know they are fried, but they still were a little too saturated with oil. This was all I tried, not too much. But that was enough for me to know I would not be going back . Hope this review help for those of you thinking of trying.",Yf2KPtZhh3Emr52WggLMjw,0,0,2,qAQq-Iu100MvWK73CCDdUg

They initially told us 20 minutes, this is unacceptable that we had to wait 70 minutes. Once we got them, Pupusas weren't great.I certainly wouldn't recommend this restaurant.  The beans had an odd flavor. Don't bother with this place.",dvNvry0WcWj-OcOXEiKjGQ,1,1,1,GUJeQkNvIdK9l0ZoWwO3gA

I will definitely go back and try some of the other items that they offer and continue to practice my Spanish laugh out loud,dyasNvlRh290wLZ3XqKmxQ,1,0,5,uFbdrdDZ2NLNQyhCuh1SQw

1340256,2014-06-11,1,24wnyPyir6-Bmv6zq7OXHg,"Viva Elvis , viva Zapata, viva Arepas, viva Mercado, viva Michoacan ...so many vivas are popping up in viva Las Vegas and so many pupuserias but I'm not complaining, we need more options beside those fast food restaurants that only make you miserably fat, we need instead more places that make us happily voluminous. 
 Enter...Viva El Salvador pupuseria restaurant. Here you can find many Salvadorian dishes but like all Salvadorian restaurants pupusas are the main star of the show, thick corn tortillas filled with your choice of ingredients like chicharron (pork) frijoles,(beans) queso (cheese) or revueltas (mixed) covered with curtido (pickled cabbage slaw) and tomato sauce. The good thing about ordering pupusas is that you can order only the amount you want, for me usually two are enough but it all depends on how fluffy you are, also don't forget to order some to go or you'll be wishing you did.
Service is good, order at the counter, find a table and they'll bring the food to you.
Place is clean and very affordable. I can't tell you that this are the best pupusas in town but I can tell you that they are very good and I'll be stacking on pupusas every time I'm in the area.......I give this place 4 stars, although everything here is made from scratch, it could be a little bit faster!

  Viva Yelp for showing me the way to this pupuseria!",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,4,1,4,GJCVePbARDdKldEtnHKbvQ
1476033,2014-06-20,0,24wnyPyir6-Bmv6zq7OXHg,"I live in the area and have had my eye on this place, stopped by on my way out of town for lunch with my BF. Ordered the carne guisada plate and 2 pupusas (pork and shrimp). One other customer present when we ordered, waiting for takeout. Wait was a little long, all was made to order right behind the register at an exceptionally slow pace- 20 minutes for the two of us. I doubt their ability to handle more than a small family ordering at once.

Pupusas (which they're apparently known for) were bland and had little to no meat evidenced in the flavor or composition of the pupusas. Disappointed.

Carne guisada though, I haven't seen on a menu since I left Texas! Here it's made with stewed tomatoes, which is a little different than the gravy sauce I am more accustomed to but tasty nonetheless. Rice was moist and flavorful, beans were downright velvety! Plate was served with additional plain pupusas instead of tortillas as menu stated, bf thought they were overly thick and tasteless.

Props for having one of my favorite dishes on the menu. Underwhelmed with service speed and lack of understanding the English language- cashier should be able to successfully greet patrons and take an order in language of this community not just  the one the food is from.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,4,1,3,JAGJ45qv8qGtNQAjamDU0w

3767412,2016-03-23,0,24wnyPyir6-Bmv6zq7OXHg,"Basically if you don't know their language then you don't get that much good service. We've gone here many times with ourSpanish speaking friends and their are always so hyped and service is good, they even offer us the 'special hot sauce' that comes with the Pupusas.   
But me and the spouse realized that when we are not with our Spanishs friends, and order the same thing, they dont Know what 'special hot sauce' we are referring too and claims they have one sauce only, and their attitude changes very quickly... What really made me upset was when I called to order 20+ Pupusas, and they claim they don't speak English which is bull because they speak to us in English when we used to dine in. And so the lady gets frustrated when we ask for the special hot sauce that it comes with... She totally blew it out of proportion didn't know what we were talks about.. (Even mentioned no we are closed) it was 6pm.. When they close at 7. Then I had put my Spanish speaking friend on the phone and he said 'special hot sauce for the Pupusas' and she immediately got it right away, and totally forgot that they were closed! Lol! Terrible! 
On purpose When we order in and tell her the same order she has a bad attitude, as soon as we have our Spanish speaking friend  come up to order with us, she's happy and has a 'thankful' service... Just that alone makes this place shitty. If you can't treat all your customers with the same kind of customer service with the hospitality as all restaurants do, then you'll loose a lot of business.",u34Ic1W0lDFz5F7Xn-4m9Q,0,1,1,Oixz2iPIrDkoN7gJFke-gQ

$21.85 for 10 pupusas. 
$4.95 for 2 bottles jarritos. 
This is absolutely ridiculous ( what a ripoff!) 
They're trying to make the most out of it. 

Food not great, salsa after taste was awful...I think they may put the hot salsa into a plastic container because it has that plastic taste ew! What Ever it is...Not pleasant.  

I was here several months ago and only I paid $13.65 for 10 pupusas. 


-I asked the lady in the counter ""why so much $ from last time I was here""
She couldn't answer me.....
I'm sure she couldn't understand me....

What in the world are they trying to do here?!!

Temperature was very bad...HOT! They didn't want to bump up the A.C.

Our waitress was very friendly and started conversations with us. She was also very patient with me, since I took forever when ordering. She brought us out some waters, chips and salsa and let me tell you... The salsa was sooooo good!! Anyways, I decided on cheese and pork pupusas and a shrimp quesadilla. It was my boyfriend's first time eating pupusas and he got cheese and chicken and the carne asada quesadilla. When the food came out my mouth was watering. The quesadilla was a lot bigger than expected!! We couldn't even finis out quesadillas. The pupusas, of course, we devoured.

5471997,2015-05-30,0,24wnyPyir6-Bmv6zq7OXHg,"By far the best Salvadorian restaurant In Las Vegas. It's near my workplace and I'm so glad I found this gem of a place! The pupusas are delicious, thin crust with the right amount of filling. The tomato sauce is great! I never eat it with my pupusas at other places because it's so watered down and lacks flavor. I also tried the fried tilapia meal that was simply amazing. It came with a whole crisp tilapia that tasted very fresh, fluffy rice, flavorful beans, a well dressed salad and warm tortillas. If I had one complaint it would be the horchata. It's a little watered down, so my solution to that issue is to order the tamerindo! If you are ever in that area, give this restaurant a try.",_O6Q4ScLO4-FVieEzCibXA,1,1,5,9m9McAW6H904Lq5C_sfsQQ
