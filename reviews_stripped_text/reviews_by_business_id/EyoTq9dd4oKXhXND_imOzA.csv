The reason being the New York bowl comes with mango salsa and avocado if i make my own you have to pay extra for the avocado n salsa. I went there last night and asked for a New York bowl the guy told me they were out of avocado I said ok that sucks and have him put the cucumber on and I say as a Substitute for no avocado can i get cream cheese he puts on the cream cheese n goes it will be a dollar more. I'm like then take it off that's why I asked can I substitute you not having the avocado in the end I wasn't charged the dollar extra but then the rest of the order the guy acted like I was wrong and stealing from them.  it put a bad taste in my mouth.

1772287,2018-02-26,0,EyoTq9dd4oKXhXND_imOzA,"Sweet Poke is a small storefront restaurant located in a very small strip mall across from the UNLV campus (with Cafe Rio and Bowlogy), its really easy to miss. Like other poke places I've visited, you order at the counter and the servers put together your bowl inn front of you. I opted for their 808 bowl rather than put one together myself. The protein is ahi tuna. I got it with a base of brown rice (you could also get it with white rice). Lots of lettuce on the side. A few other ingredients. Plus a generous portion of ginger on request. The ingredients tasted very fresh.
On the plus side, the staff was very friendly and the tables and bathroom were clean. They do offer free wi-fi. On the negative, it is really a small restaurant, which is important if you are looking to eat in rather than take out - only 4 tables plus a small counter area. Compared to other poke places I've eaten at, the portion size was small relative to the price ($10 for a really small bowl). Too many other places really close by to get a fast lunch.

2290957,2016-11-19,1,EyoTq9dd4oKXhXND_imOzA,"Not much to say other than...I'm gonna need to get more!

It was fast and exactly how I wanted it. I mean, you get to choose each individual ingredient from the type of wrap to the choice of white or brown rice to the main ingredient to the sauce to the 'fixings'. If you don't like it, it's your fault, lol. 

It was fresh which is one of the most important things here. 

The only thing ( I mean the ONLY thing ) I would change was the seating. Yeah...that's it. The seats go right up to the counter which is sort of blocking the aisle there but that's an easy fix. And, part of me thinks they did that so people will know where to enter. 

There's basically only a two ways to get it - wrap or bowl. 

I don't really like how they call them burritos because that implies that it's Mexican...when it's not. Besides, the idea of burritos were actually first made in Korea as street food centuries before Mexico was even a country.

2887632,2017-07-27,0,EyoTq9dd4oKXhXND_imOzA,"Sushi available in a subway-esque, build your own roll style setting.  You pick the seaweed or rice paper wrapper then the proteins, veggies, seasonings and sauce.  Built and rolled immediately before your eyes within a moment.  Cut in half as a sushi burrito or cut like a traditional roll.  Not to mention they are BIG ROLLS.  Eating fresher couldn't be more easy or delicious!  Located strategically across from UNLV and in the same shopping center as one of the trendiest Vape shops and a Boba store.  I couldn't be more thrilled to come across Sweet Poke!

As of late I have returned to a pescetarian diet, meaning no meat, only seafood proteins.  This is now my only fast-food.  The atmosphere is casual and the decor is ambient.  The service is refreshingly pleasant.  All high marks so far.  There is a small dining area, enough for a quick lunch or between classes bite.  Did I mention there is a drive thru?

Have a certain favorite sushi roll?  It's probably on the menu already.  You can just pick away at the menu or if you're like me than you'd rather individually pick out your dream sushi roll from all the standard sushi ingredients.  All of this is also available in a poke or SUSHI BOWL, kinda like a Japanese salad.  I haven't tried this yet.  They also have pork or chicken TERIYAKI BOWLS with rice.  Then to round things out you can even order some good looking RAMEN too.

My favorite is a large sushi burrito with: 
seaweed wrap - black rice seasoning - soft-shell crab - Unagi (bbq eel w/sauce) - Yellowtail - Wasabi Aioli - green onions - smelt eggs - spicy crab - cucumber - jalapeno - seaweed salad - garlic chips 

Good sh*t!  With the new quick-hit generation these days, a place like this is poised to fulfill the gap between wanting better specialty food - and not wanting to go through the whole sit down experience.

They let their pork bone broth sit for two days. FOR TWO freaking days. Oh man. I start drooling just thinking about it, even though I just ate it before this review. The creaminess of the pork broth just makes me melt every time. This best of all the best ramen places in town. 

Best part yet, their ramen bowl include a half hard boiled egg, corn, green onions...... Dude check out the photo.  All for $7 and they'll apply student discount with your UNLV student card.

2976459,2018-05-28,0,EyoTq9dd4oKXhXND_imOzA,"Hipster ""sushi"" has landed in Las Vegas!!

No, just kidding.  But sushi burritos do seem to be a big craze now, much like Boba, FroYo, and AYCE sushi that has become mainstream.  I will offer ONE view to this experience:  as if it were the first time.  For anyone who would prefer my personal preference without a star rating, please ask me separately.  Here goes:

LOCATION
Located right in front of UNLV, this place I can see getting quite busy during school hours, especially lunch and early afternoon times.  Beware if you plan to dine during that time.  Any of the restaurants nearby will likely be busy around that time (In N Out, Starbucks, SmashBurger, Chipotle, etc).  Convenient spot, with lots of plaza parking.  Be careful of some drivers; this area is known for bad drivers.

ATMOSPHERE
Nothing particularly outstanding, but not bland either.  The place doesn't pop out like a Rainforest Cafe, but it also doesn't make you feel like you're in a basement restaurant in NYC or Berkeley CA.  They play modern hits (I heard a song as far back as 2008 - Boom Boom Pow).  Otherwise everything stayed within the past few years.  Very clean and well presented.  The sushi burrito (also known as SUSHIRRITO or SUSHIRITO) has an a la carte style like Chipotle or Subway would.  You could pick an item from the menu, or make and design yourself with your standard base ""protein"" or ""meat.""  At the end, there are refrigerators where you can select bottled, can, or boxed drinks, and lastly a dessert freezer with mochi ice cream and macaroons.

SERVICE & PRICE
Service is catered more towards university students, it seems.  The staff was very casual, conversational, and kept things light hearted.  If you're looking for a fast-paced experience then please skip these types of establishments.  These modern ""hipster"" locations are meant for the experience more than the food.  The pricing is fair.  Base rate is $9.99 for a sushirrito and climbs with the more premium options.  The food is not glutinous and will not fill you up like the Bellagio Buffet or Lux Cafe at Venetian, so expect moderate to small portions.  Still, for the quality and experience, it can be worth it.

GOOD FOOD
What surprised me was the fresh quality of the food.  One would think that since it is a pick your item bar like Subway, the options would get stale, hard, dry, etc.  nope.  It has to be a preservative of some sort (perhaps diluted vinegar) that keeps items very fresh.  Unless of course, they rotate the options with fresh batches all the time which could be a possibility being right next to a university... but I digress.  The seafood selections were of good texture, quality, and taste as well.  Me being picky, I wish any tempura-based items like the tempura shrimp, was deep fried fresh.  Here it was cold, and placed in a toaster oven for a minute.  It still did the trick and did what it was supposed to do, so I can't be upset at all.

OVERALL
You do get what you pay for, with a hipster hospitality in mind.  Be careful of the time you go, but don't be put off by what it is or how much it is.  Next time I want to try a poke bowl item and update this review when it happens.",xqu43YW0vd8txTf1FBEPcg,1,1,5,jjy-twVp1fOodPJPpVH80A

It was very refreshing. They also have this legit deal called the Rebel combo where you can get a small bowl of ramen AND a burrito or bowl for 13 bucks. That's such a good deal! I ate the ramen and half of my burrito and saved the rest for later. Both items were absolutely delicious. It's hard to find good service now a days, especially in a fast casual setting. I was impressed.",MQnpouUfsn9_0ltOhka3Bg,2,2,5,kkaXgEEhVBcsRsy6dGxabg

Parking: Easy to find next to the Cafe Rio and right next to the new parking garage that opened up for UNLV. Lots of parking inside the plaza, so no worries there. Walking takes five minutes from the SU. 

Customer Service: 5/5 The workers were patient and cordial and said a loud farewell as we were leaving. Much appreciated to see the effort.

Reminded me of my days in Hawaii where I took for granted how great the poke is. I've run into some lousy fish since I've been in Vegas but this place does not mess with the old stuff. Not only is their fish nice and fresh, their veggies and other toppings are as well.

The only disappointing part of coming here yesterday was that they didn't have avocados/all their avocados were bad. That's pretty crazy, seeing as the majority of their items include avocado as the featured ingredient. 

I wish they had mentioned that to us before we ordered, we found out after they were already halfway building my husband's dragon sushi burrito. They at least let him change his order, and he ordered a bowl instead.

I ordered the Vegas Sushi burrito, which usually contains avocado, but was still pretty good without it.

The fish is fresh, the sauces have distinct flavors that are not overwhelmed with sugar. I appreciate the choice of using tofu base, which makes it easy to create low carb bowls. 

They just started serving a caramelized garlic crunch that has a bite of a bitw and a bit of sweetness. 

Go to bowl : tofu base, half tuna, half eel, sea weed, tuna topping, cucumber,  garlic crunch, tempura crunch , switch up the sauce.

Most poke places have spicy tuna as their protein option. So it's pretty nice to get my tuna fix with spicy tuna and the double scoop tuna as well. They also have a wide selection of toppings to put on as well. I chose the seaweed salad, edamamme, cucumber, cabbage and a few others I can't remember.

When I found out that there was one right up the road from my home, I was excited, until I found out they have been closed due to a kitchen fire. I spent the next three months pressing my nose longingly against the windows until they finally reopened. Now they see me at least once a week. The staff is amazing, they always treat me with respect and remember me, usually by name. I love getting the large bowl with a very generous amount of fresh sushi and lots of veggies. Plus, they understand my masago addiction and are generous with that,  too. It's nice that they have brown rice as an option, I wish that they had quinoa. Literally my favorite place to come for lunch and usually I end up with dinner left over.

My husband loves their burritoes, his favorite is the Seattle. He swears it has nothing to do with that being where we came from.

I try to be healthy so I always get my bowl with half tofu half spinach. The combo is delicious because the poke sauce coats it and it feels so much lighter than eating rice. The sauce combo I do is the spicy mayo, sesame shoyu, and spicy garlic ponzu. I like the sweet and spicy balance. 

The workers there are nice and are generous with the toppings. I load mine with tons of veggies including avocado, cucumbers, bell peppers and seaweed salad. Also try adding fried onion or garlic chips to your bowl. Adds great flavor and texture!  They also have a bonus reward program.

It is conveniently located directly across the street from the UNLV Student Union and in the same shopping center as the Chewy Boba Company. Prior to studying at the library last semester, we would come here weekly to pick up a poke bowl as ""brain fuel"". Due to a kitchen fire, this location was closed for a number of months; however, when we found out about their re-opening, it was like Christmas morning! 

The customer service here is superb. Upon walking in, each individual has a smile and is ready to offer help. Two indecisive girls and the idea of building a poke bowl is not the best combination; however, everyone always offers recommendations that result in great tastes every single time. 

I have had bad experience with the fish at other poke restaurants; however, the fish and vegetable here are consistently fresh. I usually do half salad and half rice with the proteins of tuna (fresh caught ahi) and yellowtail. The Chipotle Mayo is always a solid, along with the Sweet Poke House Sauce (if you like spicy things). In addition, you get to a choose a topping. My friend and I agreed that the spicy crab is definitely the way to go. You also have the choice to choose additional toppings. I always go with seaweed, edamame, cucumber, and tempura crunch (which all come at no additional cost).

To make it even better, there's a discount if you have your student ID card, a rewards program, AND you can order online if you wish.

So this time I was in the area so I stopped by the Maryland location, this location wasn't as fantastic as the Eastern location though I still enjoyed it. For some reason my poke bow at the Eastern location tasted better and the fish seemed fresher, I could tell the girl making my bowl was somewhat new so that may have been a factor in it. 

I got white rice as my base and double salmon as my proteins (you get to choose two proteins for the regular bowl I think $10, 3 for the large I believe $11.50). You get to choose a sauce which they mix up your proteins in so each piece is covered they also offer masago as a topping for no extra charge. After proteins you move on to toppings they have a good assortment of them. They offer surimi crab (regular or spicy) and avocado and no additional cost which is amazing. At most places surimi crab would be considered a protein not an included topping and avocado seems to always cost extra. So far out of all the new poke bowl/sushi burrito spots I think the Eastern location of sweet poke is at the top of the list with themaryland location right behind it.
