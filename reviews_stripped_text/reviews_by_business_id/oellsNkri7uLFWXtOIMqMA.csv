My face hurt from laughing so much! The cast was spot on and so full in character that you forgot you weren't really at a wedding! My favorite was Josephine, the mother of the bride! Her character was unexpectedly hilarious and unpredictable. And she stole the show at the end with her singing! The next day, my thirteen year old (son) said we need to go again!

All of them spoke with us several times. The audience participation is not like getting up on stage, the cast mingle and speak with you briefly, mostly sharing a few jokes. 

The plot is a soap opera Italian wedding, played for laughs. It's not Chekhov but be honest, you didn't come to Vegas for Chekhov did you? 

The actress playing Tina's Mum is a perfect mixture of warmth and hardcore. The girlfriend of Tony's father is an aging stripper, played with more class than you'd expect. The Priest loves himself way too much and his besotted colleague, a nun, kicks up some glorious dance moves. 

The food's about par for a dinner show - it's not fantastic but you won't leave feeling hungry - but it makes the ticket price great value for money. 

A super fun show - if you've never seen it, it's a must.",MgZsAipZgnyHA4Svk0TI6g,0,0,5,lUpwEW-Bgmaj-WZ2SEkVAQ
