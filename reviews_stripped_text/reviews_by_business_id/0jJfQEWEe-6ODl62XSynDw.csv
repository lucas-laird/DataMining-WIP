Now company in chapter 11 so that everybody that is owed money gets screwed. I hate people that declare bankruptcy, hurting those honest people that had faith in them. Avoid them.",F1WsGDu1pXHtzVZ6SdL8uA,2,1,1,SUJp-SyKDAAVPRH-fJNb5g

When I mentioned it to the clerk checking me out, she was well aware of it and very apologetic.  She said they were short staffed.  Really?  So short staffed for 3 days you can't take 10 minutes to grab a cart and pull the milk?  How fresh is your seafood?  Or your meat?
What about the poor fool that doesn't check expiration dates?  Are you knowingly selling expired product to your customers?  Yuck - huge turnoff.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,4,0,1,U6zDHgop5gqCTAAVRu0p5A

1557501,2015-11-08,1,0jJfQEWEe-6ODl62XSynDw,"I am not surprised Haggen's had possibly the shortest life span of any grocery store chain I have ever seen. 

I will say that for Going Out Of Business (GOOB) prices are still about 20% higher than Whole Foods - and Whole Foods has ORGANIC.

It is crazy to think that Haggens GOOB prices are this bad. A box of Quaker GO-ed out granola bars are more expensive than Whole Foods ORGANIC granola bars.!

Grapes are $2.99/lb for ORGANIC grapes at Whole Foods. Haggens GOOB price for green NON-ORGANIC grapes - WITH the 10% discount - $3.59/lb.

When going into the store with GOOB sales, I at least expected to walk out with a few decent deals. I walked out empty-handed and saved money by going down the street to Smith's - and stopping at Whole Foods for a few organic-only necessities.

It has been made public that Haggen's is suing Albertsons to get their money back from this purchase. If it was me, I could not see raising pricing from buying stores with already the highest prices (Vons) and raising prices 27% would be Albertsons fault.The prices were priced out as though we live in Alaska and a 3 1/2 hour trip was needed to go grocery shopping. Las Vegas is not a remote area where price gouging is acceptable. Maybe Haggen's was for the 1%ers out there - but the 99% of the population will price search and look for quality.

If the prices were SLIGHTLY higher, but competitive and had a lot more organic choices, I could understand. THIS was price gouging. Going out of business prices should not be more than the regular price of Whole Foods.

I personally hope Haggen's management rots in a sack. Very poor management.",VZfIzNPiO_5eNkGNFSNZDw,3,2,1,R5b8_qZ8lt57-NZp4L4fvg

I've found moldy produce, produce priced higher than whole foods, and had to wait a long time for someone to show up at the meat counter. Not happy with the change.... I see a lot less shoppers in the store and a big drop in how many employees they have working at any given time.

2488329,2015-06-25,1,0jJfQEWEe-6ODl62XSynDw,"This company has entered into the Las Vegas food market and I personally think they have badly judged the market.  They seem to want to be thought of as a cross between a convenience market and a whole foods.  They are neither.

Their pricing is high, much higher than Albertsons and Smiths.  The produce we have had so far is not up to Whole Foods quality but they seem to charge on par with them.  I went looking for advertised shrimp on sale.  They didn't have what was advertised but had something called ""brown shrimp"" of the same size for even less.  I bought it as recommended by the guy at the counter saying it was even better shrimp, time will tell.  no sign of the product they advertised.

I am searching for a reason to shop here.  Well something other than that the store was empty at 1:30pm on a thursday.

I find the employees friendly but I even saw places where you couldn't figure out the price of an item so I didn't even consider buying it.

I know they are new but they say they have been in business for over 80 years, they should have a better handle on all of this.

If they don't lower their prices, we will not be shopping there much.",Du9u6dXgWYubbnZuor1KqQ,7,2,2,eNEj1cObO0fwDeIdEipoMw
2926354,2015-08-03,1,0jJfQEWEe-6ODl62XSynDw,"So much more expensive than Von's. Everything is still set up the same, but just with Haggen brands and jacked up prices. I miss Von's so much!!!!",Yi9eWvE3-uGCUhhBNfqf7w,6,1,1,gGZMF-khkHAsKK6idAvfrw
3044368,2015-08-21,0,0jJfQEWEe-6ODl62XSynDw,"I had been wanting to try the store since they took over the Vons store, today was the day. I managed to get two stops at the store in one trip, my first and last. The fact that the parking lot was a ghost town at 3 in the afternoon, should have been a hint.

Their prices are outrageously high, figure on paying 1.5 to 2.5 times as much for any item, compared to Albertsons or Smiths. Comparing items on sale, they are still 1.25 to 2.0 times higher than Albertsons or Smiths on sale price. I'm talking exact same products, in both the above comparisons. This was true for the bakery, deli, produce, meat, etc, basically everything in the store is over priced for the Las Vegas market.

I remember many years ago Raleys came to town, they came from Northern California and were charging Northern California prices in Las Vegas, it didn't work then, it won't work now. By the time Raleys realized they needed to lower their prices, it was too late, they had already lost their customer base. The Las Vegas stores closed. I expect the same thing to happen to Haggen, if they don't address the problem immediately.

They had fresh ground sausage on sale according to the flyer, I searched and could not find it, so I went to the meat counter rang the bell three times to no avail, called the store on my cell phone, line busy, finally found an employee, she got on the PA system, finally the butcher showed up, I asked where the sausage was and he explained that, ""I didn't make any. It was on sale a few weeks ago, it didn't sell very well, so I stopped making it"". I believe in empowering employees, but this type of autonomy, where they can arbitrarily not make an item they are advertising, is not empowering the employee, it's showing a complete lack of respect, consideration and concern for the customer.

It's been mentioned in other reviews, but I noticed the 2 days left on the milk this was a premium brand, their own brand had 11 days left, if I came back in 9 days their brand would probably only have 2 days left.

I went to check out, there was only one line open, since there was less than a dozen customers in the store, it was more than enough. This was at 3:30 in the afternoon.

In general this store is pathetic, as I said I've been planning to come here since the change back in June, but it appears at least this store is already in a death spiral. They came in with high prices and lost the customer base, no one is going to pay twice as much for the same food they can get at Albertsons or Smiths. They are so short staffed they can't keep the product fresh, maybe they can't afford staff due to loss of sales, due to high prices. And the staff they do have are over empowered to make decisions such as disregarding corporate's decision on sales items.

If you like to throw away money paying higher prices on questionably fresh product, this may be the store for you, it's not for me, I won't be back. I'll just sit back and watch the place implode under the incompetence.",rAa-LxHwU8IP989kvMUJSA,2,0,1,djOYcujr9-jwJry5HOzU6w

4086867,2015-09-17,1,0jJfQEWEe-6ODl62XSynDw,"Well, it's been a few months and I'm afraid I have to update my review.  I came in the store the other day and many of the shelves were barren.  I took a photo of the meat department (which I will upload) and there were few meats available.  I asked a Manager if they were shutting down the store and trying to get rid of inventory and he told me they were in Chapter 11 reorganization and would have the shelves stocked by vendors the following day and were promised better support going forward.  

Now, I hope that is true and they make it because they have good products and it's convenient for a quick stop on my way home from work.  I think I may be willing to fight a small bear for their bakery's brownie cookies as well.  In addition, I also think their produce is nice compared to Von's.  

As far as pricing, you just have to look for deals. They have come down it appears and I still say Albertson's has higher pricing.  

Even though this location is not my main shopping spot (nor was Von's previously as something happened where they went downhill a year before Haggens came along), I am rooting for them to get their groove on and succeed",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,2,0,2,aCxWrvkFVPw3MM9Td0mKcg

I wouldn't shop there when I lived in up north, and I won't shop there now. The store was completely dead on a weekday late afternoon right before dinner. I walked through the product dept. to check prices...OMG. Exorbitantly high prices on basic fruits and veggies. The meat was even worse. I paid $4 for a gallon of milk and we went out that night....probably cheaper than buying food to prepare a meal based on what I saw.",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,2,0,1,ozqCOeG_CTiwDr2_bEku6Q

Just learned today that Haggen will be closing all their Vegas stores by end of November, so this store is history.  This company apparently way overexpanded and is now in bankruptcy.  This stupid store was only at the Vons location for about a year!  And now they're gone. So the question now is: what will take its place at this location?  Stay tuned!

5990914,2015-07-03,2,0jJfQEWEe-6ODl62XSynDw,"I've been in Haggen's twice, and so far they're only middle of the road. My first visit I would have rated them 4 because the produce department has an impressive selection of good produce. My second visit they rate a 2. Their fresh-baked bread was very hard on top and their deli is lacking in cheese. There was a variety of deli meats, no problem there. But where's the cheese? There were only signs for four types of cheese and zero blocks on display. But it's a large grocery store deli, they gotta have cheese, right? I ask for a half pound of provolone and the employee reaches into the case where there's a small saran - wrapped package of cheese. He tells me this is all the provolone he has and weighs it. It's .45lb so I say close enough, but I ask him where's all the cheese? He's apologetic but all he can say is this is all they have. If the cheese truck broke down or the cheese cooler died, he'd have said something, right? Okay so, the only other cheese I can see is one small package of maybe swiss. So, every other deli customer for the rest of the day (or until whenever they find a couple of blocks of cheese) was s.o.l., other than that one lucky guy who only wants a small packet of swiss. Go to the prepackaged dairy section? Go to another store is more likely. I have to agree with another reviewer who said something along the lines of, this store says they've been in business for 80 years, they should be a little more together than this. PS Haggen's - Don't let the 3 stars swell your head, I would've given you a 2.5 if I had the option. But don't worry, I'll be back. I have to see how this ration on cheese plays out.",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,2,0,3,7L5AR5X9lcAsbArpqt2tKw
