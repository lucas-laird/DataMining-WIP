The fry was light but full coating. The fish was obviously fresh as it was glistening on the inside. The sauce flavorful and not spicy. The slaw was sweet and perfect balance. Portion is large. Price good.

54644,2015-12-08,0,-C8sSrFqaCxp51pyo-fQLQ,"We had heard that the former Executive Chef of Heritage Steak (at the Mirage) had gone off to launch a small ""Rice Shop"" in very small west side location and went off in search of the offerings.  We arrived to find Chef Anthony Zappola (search the name) piloting his newly-launched hidden treasure all by himself.  

The place itself is a cozy little take out joint, located in a west side strip mall, with only three or four tables and a chalkboard wall adorned with the menu.

Speaking of the menu, it's minimalist but each of the 7 offerings are pure treasure.  He has five core entrees (chicken, beef, shrimp, pork belly, and fish), Pickled Vegetables (which go great with every entrée) and one simple green salad with a selection of 3 homemade dressings.  

Over the course of our two visits, we tried everything and there wasn't one weak item in the lot.  Though the pork belly was surprisingly delicious, my favorite was the fish dish served atop a tangy and refreshing ginger-citrus Asian slaw.

Honestly, I can't wait to go back.  It's the best quality value this foodie has ever found.  Kudos Chef Anthony - The Rice Shop is Da Bomb!",_d7Wy2vcdrXxr5chUgb1bg,0,0,5,gKN7iBFC9_GfBCTSfFBWNQ

Its a very small place, mainly for lunch with only a few tables. You can get the food to go as well. 

The food is amazing. I ordered the chicken bowl which had big juicy chunks of white meat chicken with a crispy golden brown exterior. The accompanying sauce was very flavorful and really added to the dish. Thrown into the bowl was some nice fresh greens and of course the delicious and excellently cooked rice. The pickled vegetables were also a great addition, giving a different flavor profile as a side dish. Finally, the dressings/sauces which come with the salad double as a great dip for the meat from a bowl. The wasabi ranch is a brilliant combo.

This place is run by one guy, the owner. He takes the orders, does all the cooking, and runs the place. He was an executive chef at a big fancy restaurant on the strip, but left to pursue his dream of having his own place. I could see that there is genuine care that goes into his business and food.

This is a Asian Southern Fried Fusion place. They serve white rice bowls with various Asian meats and veggies, each with their own light sauce.

I ordered the Fried Fish Bowl and for the picky eaters in my house chicken bowls. The dish bowl was really tasty. I really loved the quality of the rice. Nice texture to it and cooked to perfection. The fish was yummy too. Crisp on the outside and soft and hot on the inside.

The chicken bowls came with broccoli and peanuts. My family hates nuts in their food. I tried my husband's chicken and it was very heavily coated in bread and over fried. My husband refused to eat more then a few bites. I finished off his rice. 

I know Tony wanted to go with something different. I admire him for that. But please take my suggestion to heart- the masses want they are used to. When I go into a rice place I expect to see fried rice on the menu. And there is none. Sad considering it used to be before Tony revamped it. Use your current menu as your specialty menu, but please add more of the normal dishes that Americans are used to. Fried Rice, Brown Rice, White Rice. Teriyaki Chicken, Orange Chicken, Kung Pao, Curry- all that can be added as the topping to the rice bowl. You get the idea.

Also, all the meat is fried. A healthy wok option with Asian veggies is a must. I will come back to give it one more shot in a few months once he has time to see what people are looking for in a rice establishment. As it stands, my husband will never eat here again with their current menu.

Tony did a bang up good job. Loved the flavor and the size. It was nice talking to him as he explained the menu and glad we stopped by. My kid loves the chicken but could have done without the spice on the rice. Next time I'll ask to have that omitted.

The Mochiko Chicken Bowl is the only one I've tried so far and it was great- generous portion of fresh, juicy chicken with a great sauce, crisp veggies, and a scoop of rice. So long as you go in knowing it's mochiko influenced and not some strictly-authentic version of the dish, you should enjoy it. There are a few sides available, one being a salad with a choice of three house-made dressings (black sesame vin was my favorite.)

The pork belly was okay. What I really liked from this dish was the kale salad!! I hate raw kale but the dressing on it changed everything.

2303988,2016-02-01,5,-C8sSrFqaCxp51pyo-fQLQ,"Talk about HOT new business. Yelp could not be more on point!!! The passion Chef Tony has for his food amazing. Not only does it show in his food but hearing him describe the menu (it was first time for both Suzy H and I), and later talking about food the kim chi vinaigrette (the thought process about making small batches keeping everyday fresh) first time I seen vinaigrette with that kind korean twist. The vibe the guy exuberates passion for his food, such small business (literally ten chairs in the whole place) he literally takes your order then makes your food, friendly, easy going next thing know talking stories about running/jogging, and cares about his customers. The menu for all its simplicity cause five different bowls and few sides. I love it! Cliche. Quality over quantity. The same thing could be said for menu in restaurants. On this late lunch between two of us just about ordered the whole menu. Not that hard too do. 

We ordered ""Korean Beef Short Rib"", ""Mochiko Chicken"", and ""Kentucky Fried Fish"". The sides ordered the ""Pickled Veg"", and ""Pho-King Egg"". I start with the Star of the show also the most popular bowl out of the five Mochiko Chicken. Hands down. The BEST Mochiko Chicken ever had in Vegas. I had it few times mostly in Hawaiian theme restaurant but the one at The Rice Shop. The things stands out is the breading is amazing. It not heavy batter on light side more tempura batter light. Nice crispy. The chicken is nice pieces and perfectly cooked and moist. The sauce perfect compliment especially get some on the rice. Onolicous. The Kumg Pao Broccoli. If ever went vegan give me bowl of that Broccoli be good too go. The portion size is great and even better is only $9. Steal of deal. It redefine chicken bowl non of this mass market teriyaki bowl that so had been food. Mochiko Chicken Bowl that should be the standard for chicken bowls. 

The Korean Beef Short Rib not your kalbi style but marinates the beef same style and truth Kalbi just without the bone. The beef was nice tender and juicy. Mention earlier the kimchi vinaigrette with the bok chou/cucumber salad. Refreshing with kick. Not at all over the top spicy way. Perfect light side salad compliment the short rib and the rice. 

The Kentucky Fried Fish. Again the batter was delicious. Fried Fish all about only good as the batter. This one nice light not heavy and get nice chunk of fish not small scrapes. The fish cooked perfect. The aioli sauce on top is awesome. Just like the previous two bowls on point but yet each one completely different with different textures and tastes. It puts the gourmet in rice bowl. Still your simple brown paper bowl all the bowls served in. Another love it. Nothing simple about the flavors going on in every bowl.

The sides the Pho King Egg was different. Soft poached egg. The best part crack the yolk get creamy yellow river comes out combine it was the chicharrones. Amazing. You can use it as dipping sauce with your bowls. We just had it by itself. The pickled Vegs assortment of cauliflower, carrots, cucumbers, and one more forget. All very tasty. 

Really everything had was five star awesome. The service if busy might have wait cause not much of staff just Chef Tony. We went for late lunch so perfect time. NO doubt plan on coming back for more.

The menu isn't too complicated. It features 5 rice bowl dishes (Korean beef shortribs, Thai shrimp bayou, mochiko chicken, Kentucky fried fish, and BBQ pork belly) and 3 sides (leafy greens, Pho-king egg, and pickled vegetables) making it super easy to order. The chef literally explained the entire menu while he was busy at it in the kitchen which is only a few steps from where you're ordering. 

As a recommendation I went with the Kentucky fried fish with PK egg. The fish was moist on the inside and crispy on the out, fresh out of the fryer so you'd probably like to have it cool down a little before diving in. The fish, rice, cabbage slaw, jalapeño, and hot sauce aioli all went together nicely. Really enjoyed the whole dish it was delicious though it wasn't as spicy as I hoped. It is a bowl so don't expect a huge plate. I was still a little hungry after. Can't remember the PK egg but I probably enjoyed it too. 

The interior is simple and small, very small. I think there were no more than 2 two seater tables and a 4 seater table with a counter cut open into the wall where you order and can view the kitchen. Expect to take your order to go since there aren't to many seats available, maybe you could share a table with some random person. The chef was very friendly, quick, and took the time to chat.

The map location on Yelp is slightly wrong. It's located more towards Twain in the strip mall so expect a map update soon.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,17,15,4,yW9bH7Op9eJGMfgaye29cw

Every dish we ordered was overly battered and extra salty. I really wanted to like the pho-King egg. But it was just a poached egg in pho broth. Also salty :(

Made to order, the batter was a dynamic mix of seasoning, fried with crispy precision around tender, juicy fish.

Chef Tony was cool enough to let me sample some of the specialty beverages such as coconut juice and ginger soda, both stellar compliments to the Fish Bowl.

2880678,2016-01-04,7,-C8sSrFqaCxp51pyo-fQLQ,"Another strip mall jewel has set up shop in Las Vegas. Chef Tony, who has experience as an executive chef in both NY and LV, is hustling and bustling in his new Westside venture. I was turned on to this place by a friend at my gym who said she heard a lot of people raving about a rice bowl place on Durango. The rumors were true - this place delivers on tastiness and freshness! My husband and I shared the pork belly rice bowl and the fish (aka KFC rice bowl).  We both preferred the fish, but I liked being able to share two different meats. We're going to go for the chicken and beef next, since I'm sadly allergic to shrimp. The bowls came with perfectly cooked rice - the kind of perfectly cooked, fluffy rice judges expect from chefs on cooking competitions, but very few people actually execute successfully. It's the kind of rice my mom makes in her expensive Tiger rice cooker, but I can't replicate in my admittedly crappy Costco rice cooker. I stress the rice perfection because of the couple of (misguided) reviews who have a problem with the rice --- this is steamed rice, not fried rice. Fried rice is best made from day old rice that is separated in a wok. This space used to belong to Angel's Fried Rice, so a few of their former patrons seem to be taking out their longing for fried rice on this place. 

We also split the pho-king egg, which was my favorite item we ordered. I'm not a pho person, so for me, this dish reminds me of the best quality Filpino arroz caldo you can imagine with a yummy and yolky egg on top. We also ordered the side salad, which came with 3 generous portions of homemade dressings - wasabi ranch, creamy miso/sesame, and chinese black vinaigrette. My husband loved the wasabi ranch, where I liked the vinaigrette the most. We didn't even bother using a fork, we just grabbed the veggies by the handful and dipped them in the dressing. The vegetables in our salad, and in our rice bowls, were very fresh and paired well with the rest of the food. One of the many reasons I was so excited about this place was it gave me another healthy option to dine out at. Yes, I know, their meat is fried, but you can load up on delicious veggies here and actually enjoy it!

TLDR? Come here for a quick lunch or dinner option, where you don't have to sacrifice freshness or flavor to enjoy. 

Only con about this place? Chef Tony is a Cavs fan, but we won't hold that against him ;P. I'm hoping this place thrives in 2016!

EDIT - Updated this from 4 to 5 stars because my husband would sneak off here on his own because the dishes were so tasty! I had his leftovers and everything was still amazing the next day!",Y8adrWFzckrjuC11aAs9Og,9,9,5,1yKEFSzifwtMXGUZ9IKzpA

However, you will not be disappointed.  The food is exceptional.  The name of the place can be deceiving, I thought I would have the option of ordering different types of rice (brown, fried, etc.).  At The Rice Shop, the rice is secondary in the meals. Let me explain.

Ordered the Kentucky Fried Fish.  WOW.  Just as the name hints, the batter is deliciously seasoned and crunchy to perfection--not so crispy it's burnt and not so soft that it falls apart. As soon as you dig your fork through the batter, you enter a superb piece of filet: steamed, flakey, and juicy.  Mix that piece of fish with the cabbage slaw (which is filled with garden-fresh herbs and vegetables), some of the aioli sauce, and of course, some rice--Lord, have mercy!!  The flavors and texture was on point.  Loved every bite and the serving is hearty. 

My friend ordered the pork belly bowl and did not want to share any of it with me because it was, in his words, ""perfectly put together.""  

**TIP: TRY THE PHO-KING EGG, it's an optional add-on to the bowl of your choice.  For us, it was mind-blowing. Ask the Chef what this awesome treat is all about.  

We enjoyed ourselves so much we ordered and split the Korean beef short rib bowl.  Two thumbs up.  Each bowl offers something different and is unique in its own right.  Hands down, 5 stars.  Easily.

Fresh made to order rice bowls with various premium proteins and sauces. I went in around 4pm, Tony walked me through the menu and gave me a brief background on himself and his concept for the Rice Shop. He recommend I try the Kentucky fried fish bowl, and the Mochiko chicken. I also ordered a pork belly bowl and he threw in the egg with dashi and chorizo so I could try it with each bowl. The Mochiko chicken is definitely one of the best chicken dishes I've tried, it comes out moist and decadent with a ton of flavor in the mochiko breading. The sauce and veg bring everything together with the BEST RICE for a rice bowl ever. I grew up in Hawaii and married into a Filipino family, so I like to think I know how rice should taste when paired with any given protein. The Rice Shop has the BEST RICE tho. It's akin to sushi rice in grain size and flavor, and is served in soft scoops like you'd find at a Hawaiian Okazuya. The fish is also spot on in terms of seasoning on preparation, fried flaky and moist with a nice crunchy flavorful coating. The slaw and creamy tangy spicy sauce he pairs with the fish is incredible, and makes for a perfectly composed rice bowl fit for any food snob or picky significant other. The pork belly bowl was very very good, yet still pales in comparison to the fish and chicken bowls in my opinion. Tony(owner/operator) just knows what's up. Great flavors, super value, simple menu. A fast, easy, delicious spot with a local feel. Can't beat it. It's located right next to Other Mama and is depending on word of mouth and fundamental quality to sustain it's business.

I have been twice, once with my family and once with my SO and they all raved about it as well.  The BBQ Pork Belly Bowl ($9) is so flavorful and if you follow my other reviews, then you guessed it, it's also gluten free :) I don't normally like to eat pork but I highly recommend this. Mmm, that sauce though! My family also highly recommends the Mochiko Chiken ($9), Korean Beef Short Rib ($10), and the Kentucky Fried Fish ($10) bowls. Basically, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Every bowl packs lots of flavor! Also, can I just say that the rice is cooked perfectly?!

You'll be pleased to meet the owner, Tony, a fantastic chef who cooks up these delicious meals. He's really knowledgeable about the ingredients and totally cool to talk to you about food allergies and what you can and can't have. Hopefully we will see some tofu substitutions in the future for vegetarians :) If so, I'll be back again and again!

Chef Tony Zappola took rice bowls to another level.  I have had this review on draft for a very, very long time. I was just too afraid to post it because I fear that the whole world will rush over here, then there will be long lines, then the prices will go up, and then I can't have them for myself.  I know, I'm a little selfish.  Speaking of fish, the Kentucky Fried Fish is amazing and is currently my favorite item here. The secret to Chef Tony's Kentucky Fried Fish is the large pieces of double-breaded cod. I don't know how he manages to keep this dish crispy without the grease. And at the same time, the fish is still as flaky as it gets.  I would eat this dish Kamayan Style (with my hands only) if no one was looking.  Heck, that's the best way to eat this dish. 

I have also tried their shrimp, short ribs, and Mochiko Chicken.  The shrimp and short ribs is good.  I recommend the Mochiko Chicken if it's your first time here. You can't go wrong with the Mochiko Chicken at The Rice Shop.  Like the Kentucky Fried Fish, this dish is also breaded to perfection and the serving is huge.  If you're torn between the fish or the chicken, then do what I do and get both. My typical order is their Kentucky Fried Fish with an extra side of Mochiko Chicken.  It's the best of both worlds. 

I can't end a review about The Rice Shop and not mention the rice.  I know it's just rice and anyone can cook rice.  Trust me, there's something special about the rice at The Rice Shop.  It is so good and may possibly be the secret to The Rice Shop's success. 

Bottom line, 5 stars all the way for The Rice Shop.  You won't find long lines or expensive dishes here.  Simply put...you'll only find some of the best fish and chicken bowls at a very low price.

I was a bit disappointed as I wanted and had expected pork belly with a crusty skin but soft and juicy on the inside. The sauce that they put over it is a bit on the spicier side so just beware. I guess you can always get the sauce on the side if needed too. Overall did it satisfy my hunger???This is definitely a lunch place and if you are really really hungry like me who skipped breakfast you may still be hungry. I burn a lot of calories teaching 4 periods of math before I get a lunch break. Apparently the best dish to get is the fried fish which at the time didn't seem appetizing to me. I'm willing to give it another chance though to see how it shapes up.

I work close by, and placed my order right before heading over to pick it up - to my surprise, it was ready by the time I got there not 5 minutes later. That's quick turnaround for fresh food, and you can really taste the quality. I got the mochiko chicken and loved every bite; it was wonderfully crunchy on the outside and tender and juicy on the inside. The sauce that was in the dish was well done and not overpowering, adding enough flavor that it really helped turn the meal into something great. Delicious!

The menu is relatively small, but that's not a negative to me: whatever you're in the mood for is probably covered. Chicken, shrimp, BBQ pork, fish, and beef are all available (in one item each) with their own complementing sauces and vegetables.

Chef Tony was very friendly and focused on service, which is fantastic for a place he seems to run solo. I'll definitely be coming back again and again! For the price (about $9) this place is a must-try.

Korean Beef Short Rib ($10): Bok choy, cucumber, kimchi vinaigrette.
Mochiko Chicken ($9): Kung Pao broccoli, peanuts.
Kentucky Fried Fish ($9): Cabbage slaw, jalapeno, hot sauce aioli.
BBQ Pork Belly ($9): Honey-mustard kale, sambal sour cream.
*All rice bowls are garnished with Thai basil, cilantro, and scallion. 

Everything is delicious. The only bowl I didn't love was the Korean Beef Short Rib, but there's a good possibility that's due to my bias (there's no pleasing me when it comes to Korean eats) and I am willing to try it again. Either way, the other three bowls are amazing. I love the proteins and the different ways they're prepared, I love the different complements/vegetables, and the different sauces. You're getting a completely new experience with every bowl. I also love the garnishes - Thai basil, cilantro, and scallion just really freshen up and tie everything together. I love my herbs! 

I can't even pick a favorite among the three. The Mochiko Chicken has the perfect mochiko breading and flavor with juicy meat. The Kentucky Fried Fish is really stellar. I had to be convinced about this dish because it didn't speak to me in any way, but I am so glad Anthony told me to go with it. The fish is lovely and the crispy exterior is insane. Plus, that aioli and slaw is so good. The BBQ Pork Belly is amazing. The best flavor and texture on the pork belly and I love the kale and sambal sour cream. YES TO ALL OF IT!

Sides
Leafy Greens ($4) with Wasabi Ranch, Creamy Miso (Sesame), or Chinese Black Vinaigrette.
Pho-King Egg ($3): Sous vide egg, pho broth, crumbled chicarrones.
Pickled Vegetables ($3)

The Leafy Greens is a rather simple salad, but the housemade dressings will blow you away. The Wasabi Ranch has that same delicious creaminess you love about ranch with a tiny punch of robust wasabi. It seriously goes with everything. The same can be said about the Chinese Black Vinaigrette. OMG, I am obsessed with this dressing. Seriously, the best flavor EVER! I'm kicking balsamic vinegar to the curb!

The Pho-King Egg is something else. A really, really good ""something else."" First, you have this thickened pho broth that is already delicious on its own. Then, add the most perfectly-cooked egg ever (sous vide FTW). Last, top generously with crunchy chicarrones and fresh scallion. After you're done admiring the beautiful dish, you mix everything really well and shove it in your mouth (or pour it over your rice). It is very good.

So, I've tried everything on the menu except the Thai Shrimp Bayou Rice Bowl (and the Creamy Miso dressing). It's not that I don't want to try the shrimp, but I love the chicken, fish, and pork belly so much that it's hard to stray! The bottom line is that Chef Anthony Zappola (previously of Tom Colicchio's Heritage Steak) is doing it right and you needed to be here yesterday.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,7,6,4,sV9WtRbN5f3MdQ96rfh0ZQ

I've gotten the Kentucky Fried Fish bowl and the Mochiko one. I love how fresh the Kentucky fried fish bowel tastes and the way the fish just melts in your mouth. The sauce they use is both unique and perfectly compliments everything. 

The Mochiko chicken reminds me of a fusion of a sweet and spicy Chinese sauce with crisp chicken pieces. They always load up on the chicken which is awesome and it's extremely filling compared to the Kentucky fried fish.

I would recommend trying both, my favorite is the Kentucky fried fish but it isn't as filling and value driven than the Mochiko chicken.

The food was excellent.  Rice was cooked to perfection and the korean chicken was very tasty.  The bok choi would have been amazing if it was steamed a little but it was still good.

Overall, pleasant experience.  Great place for a quick bite where you're not needing to be rolled out.",XQOWYd0VM9gDEepzzcRNEg,2,1,4,m1Jbk77FHAfwNkw-1QnOLg

I went there today with my family and found PERFECTION in a bowl. Seriously. Very fresh, flavorful, and delicious! We tried the Mochiko chicken, the Kentucky-fried fish (my favorite!), and the pork belly bowls. The rice was perfect, not too much. (I think jasmine rice). The vegetables were fresh and included Thai basil and cilantro as accent flavors. The meats were great; the fish was PHENOMENAL. (I'm not a huge fan of pork, but I could tell that quality pork belly was used, nicely marbled with fat). I can't wait to go back and try the two other bowls. It's a small spot with only four tables and the owner is the cashier/cook/waiter, BUT, the food is cooked to order, fresh and the service was great.

This is a hardworking guy with a great concept. I had the fish bowl which was fantastic. Perfectly fried and seasoned fish, cabbage had an excellent viniagrette and a lightly spicy cream sauce perfectly drizzled over. This is the kind of food you get when someone truly cares about the product coming across the counter.  Hearty and filling rice bowls with inventive yet accessible flavor combinations.

There are no more than 5 tables, and at that time, a parent had about six kids with her after soccer practice, so only one table was open. I ordered the korean beef short rib and my friend had the bbq pork belly. Both tasted great, very healthy and full of flavor, but the pork belly was definitely the winner of the two. There's only one staff, Tony, who is super friendly and runs the entire restaurant. The food style is similar to that of Mochiko Chicken, but if you want an alternative to only chicken, this place is definitely it. Getting a table here would be tricky, but if you're in the mood for not only something healthy, but also filling and delicious, it's worth the wait!",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,2,1,4,xWYc9soUXLMRittIaAOv2w

That's my go-to dish at this little shop on Durango owned and operated by Chef Tony, a one-man show.  He takes your orders and then cooks up the food, serving it to you hot and fresh.
The Mochiko Chicken is served with kung pao broccoli, peanuts, and white rice. The chicken itself has a slightly sweet crunch to it, Asian comfort food at its tastiest.  This bowl of goodness is my favorite thing on the menu here and I would probably have it every day if we lived closer.

We ordered the Korean beef and mochiko chicken. He tasted both and gave me the beef. I can see why. I was expecting it to have a classic Korean sweet flavor like a bulgogi--nope. It was like it was boiled? And then covered with a mayo siracha--no flavors. Served over raw bok Choy. I didn't care for that taste. At least on a bi bim bap the veggies are blanched. 
The mochiko chicken was good. Or maybe was excellent after tasting the beef. My son said the red in the sauce taste like  candy (he is 8) but an expert meat and rice eater. He liked it but it's not his favorite",IPlLcdNG426qOopHH4EwkQ,2,0,3,InydtWnfX0rS1PzC02p8sQ

I've had two dishes: the eggplant dish (a new one) and the Kentucky fried fish. The seasoning on both of them were pretty similar, actually, at least in regards to the sauces. However, the former didn't sit entirely right with me, but the latter was a better experience, and a dish I'd recommend, more for eating there than taking home, as the owner/chef advised that it was better to eat it there.

The prices are reasonable considering the level of sophistication of the dishes.",YE54kKTuqJJPNYWIKIpOEQ,0,0,4,wfKTjy_rsxj7E08zwOHTxw
5750273,2017-12-13,0,-C8sSrFqaCxp51pyo-fQLQ,"The mochiko chicken bowl and kentucky fried fish bowls I have tried. 

The fish comes with coleslaw which was suprisingly good and acidic.

Chicken comes with brocolli.

The chicken is my favorite definitely, the flavors are on point and the sauce is tasty. My only wish is that they offer different levels of heat and sweetness to their sauces as the sauce they serve with the chicken is a little too sweet and a little not spicy enough for my liking. Other than that the food was really good, the brocolli was a bit on the cold side which makes eating it with hot rice and chicken a bit odd. Nitpicking aside pretty solid food, and the owners are friendly as well. 

Wish they would open later than 6 since I work almost every night, so eating at this place for dinner for me is just not possible. I know its a mom and pop operation though so I understand, hopefully they do well enough to start staffing and staying open later.

Now, don't be fooled by the White guy in the kitchen scooping up rice and talking you through the menu. I know what you're thinking cuz I thought it too:  ""I just made a huge mistake. Why would I ever come to a fusion rice bowl place?"" or ""Is this going to be even halfway decent? I should have gone to Panda Express instead""

But fear not! This was definitely NOT a mistake... It was a very delicious decision!

First and foremost, the RICE. It's cooked perfectly. It's the perfect consistency of soft/fluffy/chewy. Like the perfect fusion between sticky rice and sushi rice.  I think the only reason I'm giving this place 4 stars is because I feel they actually skimp on the rice portion!  GIVE ME MORE RICE! 

Now onto the fixins'.  I ordered the Korean beef short rib - and the beef was tender and flavorful. It was mixed with a spicy sauce and some raw veggies, which mixed really nicely. I'd have to say, I never thought I'd enjoy raw bok choy, but it added a nice crunch to the bowl :)

Also, being the total fatty that I am, I ordered the Kentucky fried fish...which is my new favorite thing EVER. This fish is soooooo good. Nice big portion of perfectly fried fish, delicious cool cole slaw and yummy spicy aoli, all on top of fluffy soft rice?!?!?! YUM. 

It's a super limited menu, but this place is great! 

+1 for Tony, the super cool and friendly chef/owner

5928959,2015-12-27,2,-C8sSrFqaCxp51pyo-fQLQ,"Read reviews about The Rice Shop here on Yelp and decided to give it a try. I wasn't sure if this place would be open on Christmas Eve. As I walked in, Chef Tony greeted me and he was very friendly. He said that he wasn't sure about how many people would stop in, but his plan was to be open for lunch only. As I was looking over the menu on the wall, he kindly explained to me that there were five different rice bowls with different Asian meats. Each bowl comes with rice, but different vegetables and sauces are used to accompany each meat. So it was basically Asian rice bowls with a Southern twist. 

Decided to try the Mochiko Chicken bowl. I took my order to go and waited about 5 minutes while he cooked everything. Good to know that everything is made to order! When I got home, the food was still hot and fresh. The portion size was pretty big, I couldn't finish the whole bowl. The chicken was good - somewhat crunchy on the outside and nice and hot on the inside. Not sure what kind of sauce was in the bowl, I'm assuming it was some sort of Kung Pao sauce? I thought it was alright and appreciated that it wasn't too spicy, although it did have a kick to it. 

Overall, I wasn't impressed, but please keep in mind that I am a picky eater. I think the only fusion dishes that I like are from Sushi restaurants. Glad that I got to try this place, but I think I just prefer my Mochiko Chicken on a bed of Furikake rice or plain rice for that matter, LOL.
