The prices do reflect that but the quality of food makes it worth while from time to time. The 3 meat Hero sub and brisket are a couple of my favorites but everything is good, you can't make a bad decision. Bottom line is, if you like subs and haven't been here, it's a must.

First time in life trying Firehouse subs. I do like that they offer a smaller menu for those of us who don't want to wolf down an entire sub. 

I ordered the Cranberry and Turkey, hold the mayo, it was way too sweet for my taste. Next time I'll tell them to only do a small amount of cranberry because it was too intense for my taste.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,3,2,3,gn-aYVezbRwv3yDkFHy4UQ

Since I can't specifically explain I'll just say the management is very bad, employees all great but owners are bad. Food is bland and skimpy on portions. Instead of trying to respond and help an upset customers they  look for excuses to have reviews removed. Lost a customer for life.",2YiBYO8n32upYTJnpWgqLg,4,0,1,MMVKBGoafJ8qb61b-H5n3Q

Or meatball sub chips and drink were delicious. The Decour was the bomb. The location was very clean and cute. Great customer service,iZlQ8XE0UsKhfYdG3VZ7zw,0,0,5,X2JARV_oQRsagDYRznwzsQ

You can only imagine my excitement when i found out that firehouse just opened on charleston & decatur, right around the corner front where i live. Today my husband and i came in for the first time for lunch. Sujey M was the cashier. Im very picky about my subs so i made sure, like always, to give her my order slow and clear. I had to keep repeating my order like 4 times. I said i wanted a medium pastrami and swiss on white with ONLY mustard, lettuce and pickles. Pretty simple 
WOW what a headache trying to get THAT in the computer
When i asked again if there was swiss and pickles and made sure there was no mayo on it, she smirked and then fixed it like it was funny.
When i got my order, it was wrong just as i expected. My husband was almost done his sandwich while i waited for mine. He could feel my stress and said maybe we shouldve went to port of subs. I understand that we're all human and make mistakes but c'mon
I had to tell her THAT many times and it still came wrong but the worst part was her basically smirking at the situation
Lottiera and Oshay were very friendly and quick to get my order correct and back to me. They cared.
In this world today with how the economy is, restaurants (all businesses for that matter) really need to care more who they hire. This girl is clearly there for the paycheck.
I shouldnt have to dread ordering lunch. 
The sandwiches were bangin once it was right!",ySYuJSuamBP9cH6yDy_0ug,0,0,2,TTWML08hc1QjZqzhcTv-fg

 More expensive than other sandwich joints, and worth it.
 Ignore the fact that they give back to the fire department LOCALLY at every turn, are always clean, have free for what's for me and My Kayden.
 Ignore, if you have no soul, the soda machine that dispenses dream mixed AND has Cherry Limeade, in Sparkling or Non. Not to mention Vanilla Rootbeer or Cherry Dr Pepper.
 You cannot ignore the Barbecue Beef sandwich. The exact name escapes me at the moment. It's 3AM and I am insomniac, drinking coffee in bed. The counter people will absolutely help you. I add fresh onions, they also offer saut√©ed! Little cups of one of the 40 flavored of Barbeque sauce on the counter to personalize it, too. Damn. Best thing I've had in my mouth in way too long to count. (Sadness)
Anyway, go. Get it. Eat it. The UFC me. You'll want to.

I enjoyed their meatball sub, but it could of used a little extra sauce, but that's just me. My sister had a vegetarian sub. I didn't try it, but it looked appetizing and she liked it. I highly recommend this restaurant and rate them an A+!",X1Fa5Cu3lOWvcjFkilHFXA,0,0,5,jKzGt0WMOBEHNlx7ioQoQg

They talk about personal things right in front of people who come in. Me and my boyfriend were eating here and they were yelling across the place. It was very odd I've never been anywhere where I've experienced this. It was very unprofessional. But over all the subs are good service sucks.",O71CIBAp-_15i3ix1RODmA,0,0,3,L9xulGG6VcRIsVc7pHPWig

Had the Firehouse Brisket sandwich, it was amazing.  My friend had the HookNLadder and look great and she said the taste is one of the she had ever had!

Only problem we in counter the three times we have been here is the young lady working the counter taking orders has blow our order each time.  If your in line make sure you read the servers name tag and try to stay away from Sujey three times she blown our order.

Once we get our food it's a amazing, but ordering it's a crapshoot.
