1076,2015-03-29,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,Some of the most authentic BBQ I've had in Vegas to date. Brisket was by far the best item on the menu. They know what they are doing.

I have to give them a 4 instead of a 5 because they really do need to work on better assessing their raw goodsinventory food-wise. They were almost out of everything by 6 pm on a Saturday night, and they weren't supposed to close until 9pm. That's money down the drain. This isn't the first time that this has happened so once they get a grip on that issue they'll be a 5. I would suggest calling first to see what they've run out of before making the trek in person.",4vP0IKq8qt7h-CsTLFhSxg,0,0,4,uBK-nYD9x_GQRXyga86-Dw

32100,2015-02-28,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"This place is small but it definitely has the summerlin feel. High ceilings, floor to crawling window front, very open. Only about 15 tables. Its best if you come with someone so they can hold a table while you order. 

Counter service. They have kids running the food so the guy that dropped off our Mac and cheese had his thumb in it. 

The food is absolutely delicious. I don't particularly enjoy BBQ, but this place has love in their food. We ordered the brisket, sausage, and pulled pork should. The sausage was super tasty but it's a finer ground and I didn't care for the texture. The brisket and the pork shoulder were fall apart tender, juicy and smokey. THAT BARK! It's so serious. Mac and cheese was very good. Breading was too thick on the fried pickles, maybe if they used a larger cut of pickle. Fries weren't anything special. 

They have three different sauces, that you don't need because the meat is delicious, but the hot BBQ was very good. They also had a regular BBQ and a secret white BBQ sauce, it's milk based, I didn't care for it too much. Tasted like sour milk. 

There was one person that was particularly helpful. I believe her name is Adrian. She was very friendly and remembered us from our previous visit.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,2,1,4,RpXlgUIiptVFSA5kvcQJ1w

The pulled pork was extremely dry, no flavor.  Speaking of flavor, what happen to the white barbecue sauce? Two meat plate portion was small, brisket was sliced thin, maybe they were afraid of running out. The baked beans were not quite the same, a little undercooked. Change your vendor for the tortillas, not very fresh. 

Now about the service, constantly had to remind the cashier that there was no forks, as our food was getting cold. No forks, no white sauce, no lemon for my tea and no soft serve ice cream.

Hopefully it was just bad day, will give them another visit.",9OtrPjErXjWwyVKCpnpS5Q,1,0,2,S-8DY142_rXZSCmfWvIrdA

160834,2016-06-17,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"The Service here is fantastic!! The food is amazing and I will most definitely be telling my friends and family to come eat here!

I tried the sampler which includes 1/4 lb. each of pulled chicken, sliced brisket and pulled pork, 4 baby back ribs, 1 sausage, 2 small sides. 

I had lean brisket which is tender, juicy and full of that slow smoked flavor. The Pulled Pork was my second favorite meat, again tender and juicy with a nice flavor. The sausage which is different now than what it used to be is much better in my opinion, more of a smoked sausage than a polish. The RIBS are my favorite and I would say is the Best in Town by far. Fall off the bone tender and smothered in the yummy goodness of the made from scratch BBQ sauce. The chicken is also very delicious but I didn't have very much room left for it after all of the face stuffing of the ribs.

I tried the Bacon Mac n Cheese and was very surprised at how creamy it was but yet had that perfect golden brown cheese bake on top and sprinkled with bacon because you know bacon makes everything better.

Baked Beans are truly a must have here. Bursting with that smoky BBQ flavor but still sweet and heaven in your mouth.

Save the best part for last...the to die for Peach Cobbler. OMG I could seriously eat this every time and the best part is, is that it is Complimentary!!

I absolutely love this place and will be back many more times to come!!

164581,2016-02-14,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Even though I believe my meal was 5 stars, I'm giving it 3 stars, and here is why: our lunch was ""brought in.""

We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, mac & cheese, and corn bread. In the large aluminium pans. 

Even though we ordered ahead, by the time we received our order and got it back to our office it was warm-room temp or cold. 

And it was absolutely fantastic!!

Even cold, the brisket & pulled pork was tender, full of flavor, and did not need any sauce to enhance its goodness. The brisket pulled away easily & without effort; the pull pork fell apart. As they should. To me, just like a steak, if you have to add sauce to it, it wasn't good to begin with. 

The mac & cheese, even cold, was a huge pile of creamy goodness on my plate. The pasta was perfect. 
Instant mac this was not. 

Everything was fresh. That it was cold did not disappoint. I had fridge cold leftovers that night...30 seconds in the mike & was perfection!! 

(I wasn't keen on the corn bread. While it had a good sweet flavor, it was dry. But I won't blame Billy's for this-they bring it in from an outside source here in town. I forget the name...)

Born & raised in Texas and having eaten at some of the best BBQ joints in all of Dallas & Ft Worth, I have been searching for a BBQ place to do my taste buds proud since leaving in 1996. It's taken 20 years to find it, and it was worth the search. I only wish I found it sooner. 

Hopefully I can visit Billy's BBQ as a dine in and update my 3-stars to 5.

(It is true, they do run out of meats. Meat for next days service goes in the night before. Once they're out, they're out. I suggest going for lunch so you're bound to get what you want instead of slim pickings for dinner.)",9BuTUHt6Zlm-UCjaGD6aJQ,0,0,3,ma4NBFSM2rYACSV-sYDdrA

211671,2015-03-20,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Stopped quick for lunch and it was good. I got the Pitmaster samich. The sauces weren't my cup of tea as they're about as thin as water and vinegar based. The ""hot"" vinegar sauce didn't have any heat at all for me. The original sauce was a bit too sweet for me. The menu looks expensive at first glance but the Pitmaster samich was piled high. It's one of those samiches that spills out after every bite you take so you know they're giving healthy portions. Plus, the meat was juicy and not overly smoked... could even have a little more smoke. I was kinda disappointed in the non-lunch portions. What you order for lunch is the same portion that you order for dinner. So for me the 2-3 meat platter didn't make much sense for lunch being that it also comes with 2 sides. I woulda been extremely unproductive in the afternoon had I eatin the platter! I'd like to see a smaller samich that also comes with a small side for lunch.  For $12 the samich seems a bit spendy for lunch but when you leave you're full. Having said all that, I'm looking forward to going back... it was good, better samich than Famous or Lucille.

Today they baked beans were not anywhere close to as good as on our first visit. They tasted like canned pork n beans with a little brisket meat and onion added.

The pulled pork was overcooked. The pulled chicken was overcooked. The ribs and brisket were ok. 
The really outstanding recipe at Billy's was the baked beans. Today it was not outstanding. It was weak. It seems that there is a recipe consistency issue.

872534,2014-11-25,1,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"I ended up in Vegas because of the military, I've been INCREDIBLY disappointed with the BBQ in this City.  Billy's has filled the void. I'm from Texas, so BBQ is a BIG BIG deal for me.

MEAT- So far I've tried the sausage, pulled pork, and the brisket.  Most places either over season or smother the meat in sauce. Billy's allows the meat to talk for itself.  Billy's meats don't have a heavy smoke taste. The brisket was incredibly tender with just enough fat that adds to the taste.  One thing that stands out is how much of the natural juice stays in the meat. One problem I've found in Vegas is that none of the meat is tender and juicy.  The meat at Billy's literally falls apart from being so tender.  The sausage has a hint of heat, but nothing to mask the natural flavor.

SAUCE- While Billy's doesnt sauce the meat, they do offer 3 different sauces that you can add on your own.  I only tried the smokey and the hot.  They appear to have a white sauce which I am only guessing is a vinegar based sauce.  Billy recommended it to another customer for the pulled pork.  Both the Smokey and the hot are light in texture so it soaks into the meat without changing any texture. Both sauces are incredibly subtle, which I think is once again goes along with letting the meat do the talking. Being from Texas I'm usually a dry rub guy, but the sauce doesnt mask the taste of the meat

SIDES- I had the pickle fries/ fries/ and pork and beans. The pickle fries are amazing. Nice and crisp and they don't fall apart. The fries were waffle fries, which is always a ++.  The pork and beans were amazing. Nice chunks of pork inside.

TACOS- I had the chicken tacos and an brisket tacos on a separate night. They are street tacos that you can add coleslaw to.  Let me start off by saying I have HATED coleslaw since I was a kid.  I just have never understood the point.  I decided to be brave and try it one the tacos.  OMG......... The sauce in the coleslaw is AMAZING.  The pepper taste completely transformed the taco.  Once again, the chicken and brisket were incredibly tender.  They used corn tortilla, which is the best way to make a taco.

SERVICE- The first night i came in i didn't know what time they closed. I puttered in at 815 only to realize that they closed at 8pm...... The staff was more than happy to welcome me in and remain patient while I asked them about the menu.  The cooks were tossing me suggestions through the window while the cashier was more than happy to allow me to ramble about my love for BBQ.

The brisket here is unreal.  Big, beefy, smokey, and so tender it almost falls apart.  It is HARD to cook brisket like that.  I've owned a smoker for years and smoke meat frequently enough to know how long it takes to cook a brisket like Billy's.

The pulled pork is also amazing whether on the hog heaven sandwich or the pork tacos.  The bark is great, and the flavor is perfect.

Seriously everything here is fantastic -- the pickle fries, the smokey mac n cheese (with Bacon), the cole slaw.

So this visit was great. We've now tried everything on the menu and I hate brisket but it's great here. The beans are full of meat. The corn bread is sweet and not dry. The tacos are perfectly filling and the gut busters full of meAt and the white sauce is so good. They also give free ice cream after your meal. Also I saw a sign that said pickle fries and we asked for some and they gave it free of charge. They were perfectly crispy not soggy at all.

I ordered a full rack of ribs with mac n cheese and sweet potato fries. I got a half rack with okra and beans. I told them this is someone else's order so someone else could get their food. They offered to substitute another meat ""for free"" to replace my other half rack of ribs. Um, I paid for a full rack, how is giving a replacement for free when I never got what I paid for in the first place? I was ready to just ask for a refund, but the brisket came out and it was so good and tender that it made me shut up. Then they brought out the correct sides and said we could keep the other 2 that we didn't order. Ok, so now i got my food and i better eat it too. 


The bbq sauces are delicious, who needs ketchup anymore?


The ice cream machine is broken and no longer there, but the old ice cream cones are still behind the counter. I hope they aren't saving them for when they get a new ice cream machine.

Also got some peach cobbler. 1st I'll start with the negatives: they were out of root beer, and macaroni and cheese, and the pulled pork looked pretty dry. For someone who has been in the food industry for nearly 30 years, we know we can't please everyone, because they were raised to think and eat differently, and our taste buds mutate every seven years. But common sense weighs in that their selection of root beers must be flying off the shelves and a mad crowd came in and cleaned out their macaroni. Now, I could go to albertsons and pick up up some ingredients to whip up a batch in 20 minutes but the integrity of the dish can be compromised. So good call, chef. I'll gladly wait for a serving next time. But the baked beans and the collard greens were phenomenal. I made a meal out of those and some crinkle cut fries. By the way, skinny fries DOES go better with bbq dishes but crinkle cuts are my favorite also. Keep doing what your doing. The pulled pork....well, I put some bbq sauce that they graciously set on the side for me and as I tossed it and wedged in between the dinner roll provided, it was tender and juicy and tasty. My taste buds had changed at least 5 times by now and for now, I love this place. Famous daves has something to worry about. There were a couple of other tender juicy items I would've like to spoon off my plate, but I'll save that for when I come to try that Mac n cheese.

1571001,2015-03-11,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"TL;DR version: nothing is seasoned (meat or sides) but all the meats were cooked very well, so somebody knows how to control the heat. I wouldn't call it BBQ because nothing has any flavor and BBQ isn't just about how meat is heated to cook, but how it's rubbed, marinated, mopped, basted, smoked...FLAVORED. The only flavor I got tonight was salt from the food and major sugar from the sauces. The bright spot of the night were the pickle fries, which despite the rest of the food were absolutely delicious. Overall, this place is definitely a no-go. Details follow.


My food had no seasoning other than salt, if anything. My brisket taco was incredibly salty and the corn tortillas tasted super cheap, but the meat had great texture and bark and was cooked well. I couldn't taste any flavor at all from the taco's coleslaw over the meat's salt, so it was basically totally flavorless. Great size though, for its price I'd order these in a heartbeat if they tasted good. My french fries tasted like cheap frozen fries cooked in old oil. My pulled chicken was cooked very well also, but seasoned with only salt as far as I could tell. It seemed like it was made to be eaten with the sauces, but all the sauces were disgusting (more on that in a minute).

The wife's pulled pork had great texture like my pulled chicken, but was again basically unseasoned, and just had salt and cooked alright. However I did get one bite that was all bark (which was pretty thin) and it tasted like pure salt; I had to spit it out. The brisket had good texture and one end of the cut was seasoned but as she worked down the piece of meat the seasoning faded to nothing about halfway through and the second half was unseasoned. Her side of coleslaw also had no flavor at all.

Pickle fries were absolutely excellent. Simple as that. Pickles had snap and tasted fresh. Breading was great thickness and cooked perfectly. We asked for some ranch to go with them, and the ranch they gave us was definitely a store-bought ranch put into those little plastic cups, but they didn't charge us for them and at least it was a good store brand. No complaints on these two items. Easily worth the $2.50.

So about those sauces: original barbecue sauce tasted like ingredients are corn syrup, water, and vinegar (in that order); ""hot"" barbecue sauce tasted to me just like the original, and was not even remotely spicy (I couldn't tell the difference betwixt the two sauces, truly). Not even my wife thought it was spicy, and she's exceptionally sensitive. White sauce was super watery, even though it was called a mayo-based sauce, and it was short on flavor too. All three sauces were super watery and the two barbecue sauces were super super sweet. I'm not surprised that people are raving about these sauces in some of the reviews. They're basically sugar water, and if you're into eating lots of sugar, then you'll probably like them. But the only flavor they're going to add to the food is sweet, and there's nothing nuanced or subtle or flavorful about it. They have no depth. They are just sugar water.

I felt personally insulted by the menu. $14.99 for 2x 1/4 pound meats, and 2x small sides or one large side. Small sides alone are $2.50, large is $3.50, and 1/2 pound of meat is $7.99. $7.99 + $5 = 1/2 pound of meat and two small sides for $13. So for 2 extra dollars I get the privilege of getting half-and-half meats? OR I could just buy a half pound of meat and the sides on their own and save $3. I thought combo plates were supposed to be a better deal than buying things individually. Apparently not. It's insulting, basically like saying ""we think our customers are too stupid to do basic math.""

Given all the positive reviews, I'll try this place again and hope they just had an off night with the seasonings. But seriously, it was a really really off night. And I'm pretty sure the menu prices and sauce ingredients were chosen in purpose, no ""off night"" on that part. Despite the (un)flavor, the meat was all cooked pretty well. It wasn't inedible, that's not my complaint, it's just either super bland or super salty and it's the sauces (or more accurately, sugar waters) that are inedible.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,3,0,1,sEcQwKVJWrrZpLw7vCyJiQ
1578700,2016-08-26,3,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Disrespectful to BBQ everywhere!

Im only giving 1 star because I cannot give fewer.

This place was such a huge disappointment for myself and my boyfriend.

The ribs leave much to be desired. That's putting it mildly. Even though they weren't dry at all, they lacked flavor (and they were smothered in bbq sauce). Ribs are supposed to be seasoned, BBQ sauce should be optional, not the only way to choke them down. There was no smokiness at all, I doubt they had spent any time on an actual grill or in a smoker, you could have even used liquid smoke!!!!
The bbq sauce tasted like it was just poured straight from the bottle.

The sausage.... The sausage tasted like store bought kielbasa sausage. Actually that's disrespectful to store bought kielbasa because even that has more flavor. Not sure I'd even feed this to my dog. It looked like they microwaved it and sliced it into the container.

The baked beans had absolutely no depth in flavor. And the chunks of whatever meat product they use (I think it's supposed to be brisket) cut the inside of my mouth because it was so hard. 

The Mac and cheese was just all around dry. The bacon tasted old, there was an aftertaste.

We read though the reviews on this place and believe that any review for Billy's barbecue that has been rated four stars or better has to be fraudulent, just to boost their score on Yelp and increase sales. This place was empty at 5pm. If you feel that this was good barbecue and you gave it a four star or five star review, you're probably used to the taste of Elmers glue.

Meat menu includes shredded pork or chicken, sausage, and my personal favorite, brisket- available three cuts (fatty, lean, or chopped). Prices are fair and portions are large but quality could use a boost.

Opted for the three meat plate to get a good sample of all the products offered. Meats are dry across the board and sparingly seasoned, the brisket was okay- I have had much worse in town. Added on the sausage (more like a hot link) for $3, and it was solid. Combo included two small sides: the mac was overwhelmingly creamy and cheesy while the baked beans were flavorful with bits of brisket. I don't usually care for cornbread but the piece that came with our mean was good, but the accompanying cinnamon-honey butter was amazing! 

Barbecue is one of those foods that can get pricey for a family to eat out, and Billy's has large portions for small prices: the above easily fed two grown adults, for about $22. Tables only seemed to have one unlabeled barbecue sauce, which I assume was the house creation- it was on the sweet side, while I prefer mine with a bit of a kick. 

Service was polite, space is modern and clean, but overall they need to work on the details: season the meats, make sure not to overcook them to dryness, and add more sauces. A partnership with Larry's Western Meats is suggested- their sauce selection is unbeatable.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,7,3,oT9OwA4fOan-U-rqxboMHQ

1818244,2015-07-01,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"For a little over a year now, my boyfriend and I have let our weakness for good BBQ get the best of us. Many an evening, we have set out to enjoy a different type of cuisine (Thai, perhaps... or a burger joint) only to be manipulated and circumvented the moment we see a sign for BBQ. What can I say? We just can't resist the smell of wood smoke, roasting meat, and that sweet, sweet sauce. 

This very thing happened to us a few nights ago. We were all set to enjoy a quick burger at Fudruckers, when - lo and behold - I glimpsed the sign for Billy's BBQ, and all of our best laid plans went out the proverbial window. We were helpless against it. As suckers for BBQ, but even bigger suckers for local, independent restaurants, it was meant to be. 

We were greeted the moment we entered by the friendly staff behind the counter. Having never been there before, I asked for the cashier's recommendations -- and I'm so glad I did! She suggested the brisket, the ever popular street tacos, and - if my boyfriend and I were planning to share - the sampler platter. 

As recent transplants to the Las Vegas valley from the NYC area, I was a bit worried about the lack of BBQ in our new home. After all, BBQ is experiencing a renaissance in Manhattan and Brooklyn these days. It's the newest, hottest trend in artisan, gourmet cuisine -- new places popping up everywhere, and lines snaking outside for blocks and blocks. Since we LOVE BBQ, we were thrilled about this, of course, but also devastated to leave it behind. In our travels from old hometown to new, we drove cross country through Kansas City, Oklahoma City, and Texas -- choosing that route precisely because we would be in BBQ Country. I say this just to emphasize my point: we LOVE us some BBQ. 

But back to the sampler platter! It typically comes with a quarter pound of four separate meats: pulled chicken, sliced brisket, pulled pork, 4 baby back ribs, 1 sausage, AND 4 sides. All for $22! The day we went, they were out of both chicken and sausage, which momentarily broke our hearts. They offered to double up on two other meats of our choice, to make up for it. We chose double brisket and double ribs. BUT THEN! When the food had arrived and we were already scarfing down, a waitress came up with a piece of sausage on a plate! They weren't out after all, and brought us a piece on the house. This small gesture made a big impression.

And the taste! I loved everything, and boyfriend - though more discerning - was pleased as punch. The brisket was a fatty cut, marbled throughout, tender, and delicious. The pulled pork was decadent, shredded into thick strips with chunks of crispy skin still attached in places -- AMAZING. The ribs were pork - tender, plump, and crazy tasty. I'm not usually a fan of ribs, but these had me literally licking my fingers clean. The sausage was great too - the skin was tight so that it burst when you bit down. 

As for sides, we ordered double cornbread (great texture and taste, but somehow missing the honey butter that everyone keeps talking about... sad day!), the steamed veggies (plain as can be, absolutely no seasoning), and the mac and cheese (mm! mmm! mmmmmm!). The portions were perfect. 

For that price, I was blown away by not only the quality, but the QUANTITY. It was truly an insane amount of food. We stuffed ourselves to the brim and still somehow managed to bring home leftovers for a bangin' lunch the next day. 

I also have to mention the sauces. As I've said in Yelp reviews before, I'm a saucy broad. I truly appreciate it when restaurants allow me the autonomy to drown my food in sauce as I see fit. Billy's BBQ offers each table a selection of their sauces: original, smokey, and hot. They were all spectacularly good, really. The original sauce is the thickest, tasting like a traditionally sweet BBQ sauce. It had those expected hints of molasses, brown sugar, and I even tasted a bit of apple. The smokey sauce had a bit more tang to it. Still thick, but with more depth of flavor, not as sweet, and with a definite current of smoke, as the name suggests. The hot BBQ sauce was my favorite! It was vinegar based with crushed pepper flakes, and the perfect amount of zing and heat. I was alternating dunking my bites into each of them, but I turned to the hot sauce the most frequently. 

Awesome experience, incredible BBQ -- thank you, Billy! We will be back!",Wy1QW1iUzTYVw0jw970sUg,0,0,4,D48SuJFtKWkLfZpQGsyYcA

The pulled pork was juicy and the sauces were great. The baked beans stole the show though. They put meat in the beans! It reminded me of home. 

Now for the negatives.. Firstly and most importantly, they don't offer sweet tea! This is a travesty! Their only tea options are unsweetened and raspberry tea (wtf?). get it, we're on the west coast, but you can't serve BBQ without sweet tea. Secondly, why is there a soft serve ice cream machine?

2190662,2015-12-11,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Billy's was great and below average.  There were two huge red flags for me, first there was no smoke in the air or aroma of BBQ outside of the restaurant and there were not a lot of people there  

The great was their brisket, both fatty and lean were excellent, especially the fatty, no matter where you get brisket, the lean tends to be a bit dry especially if you, like me, are not going to eat it right away.  Nice, flavorful crust that was heavenly.  Their smokey BBQ sauce is awesome.

Now on the to ribs, really disappointed.  I was prepared for the ribs to be not very good as soon as I looked at the menu.  I usually avoid BBQ places that serve things like shrimp,  tacos and fries, IMHO they are doing too much and need to focus on BBQ.  I don't see any Mexican or seafood restaurants serving BBQ ribs.   I was correct in regards to their ribs.  No flavor whatsoever, tasted like they seasoned the ribs with paprika only, I wonder if they had seen an outdoor charcoal or wood pit.  I bet they were cooked on an indoor grill on in the oven then finished on a grill.  If so, shame, shame, shame on you Billy!  Their website claims the ribs are smoked daily for 12-15 hours, interesting. I wonder where all of that smoke goes.  Could barely finish them, thank goodness I ordered the brisket too.  The beans were not good either.

I'll definitely return for the brisket.

Oh, one other problem.  They have no bread!!!  All they have is cornbread and you have to buy it separately if you order just meat, most places give you bread free when you order a pound of meat.  Any self respecting BBQ joint must have plain white bread!!!   That's the golden rule!!  No pork or chicken links either, just beef.  WTH??",u4BHxiH2fBlH6bRJxDl8Xw,0,0,3,cIl4EIG_n13M3bGvx_kCSw

The first time we came in the food was PHENOMENAL. Seriously, so good.
Tonight, it was subpar. We ordered the sampler platter (this is more than enough food for 2 adults and a child), with an extra side.
The sampler comes with brisket, sausage, 2 ribs, chicken and pork. You also receive 2 sides and a piece of cornbread.
The brisket this time was ALL fat. There was barely any meat on any of it. The pork and chicken were dry both times. Ribs are good. I didn't particularly care for the sausage, but my husband really likes it.
My three year old devours the brisket baked beans (they've since changed to smoked meat baked beans- not as good, but still tasty). The waffle fries are gross. Seriously, just don't bother. There is a weird crust on them. Is it breading/batter? Is it a weird cheese type situation? Idk, but they were inedible, and were tossed . Sweet potato fries were a better choice. My husband RAVED about the smoked bacon Mac and cheese. 
There is no dessert on the menu (unless you count a weird cornbread fritter thing.)

All in all, I think this place is a decent addition to the SW, but we won't be back as frequently as we originally thought.  Keep the meats from drying out, don't serve a meat sampler platter with 1 of your meats being only fat, and if a customer says something about it- take charge of the situation.
New containers are cumbersome also. Paper type products don't hold up well with sauces, fat juices, and bbq sauce.

It included brisket, pulled pork, chicken, 4 ribs, a hot link, and 4 sides for 21.99.  Very good amount of food and 2 people could easily split it.  Excellent price and overall the food was very good.

In order of excellence...

Pulled Pork: 5/5.  The meat was well cooked, juicy and tender, and very flavorful even without sauce.  Would make a great sandwich.

Pulled chicken: 5/5.  Same as above.

Ribs: 3.5/5.  They were good...but not great.  The meat was a little soft, and I like my ribs a little more taut so to speak.  The flavor was alright, but a little weak.  They were definitely not bad, and I would not be unhappy to eat a rack of them, but they did not blow me away.  Still solid though.

Hot link:. 1/5.  I hated it.  Simple as that.  I did not like the flavor or the texture.  The only low point for me.

The sides...

Greens: 4/5.  Spicy and tasty.  Could have used a little meat in them, and they were a little soggy, but they were still good.

Okra: 4/5.  Well fried, good texture.  The flavor was a little weak in the seasoning department, but they were good and very well cooked.

Beans: 3.75/5.  They were good.  They had large chunks of meat in them, but I did not think the flavor was robust enough.  Still good though.

Cornbread: 3/5.  Too sweet.  It was good but tasted like a dessert.  I want my cornbread a little less sweet, and I would love corn in it.

They offer free soft serve to everyone in the place, and the service was pleasant enough, and it was pretty quick (except for the link which came out way after everything else).  Overall, the food was very good and well done, and actually tasted like actual BBQ.  The price was also excellent at $22 for the huge amount of food I got.  I would put the food on quality overall at a solid 4/5, but given the price and the value, I would bump it up to 4.5, and since I am overall pleased and can't give 4.5 for some inexplicable reason, I round up.",8M4TrpX2jPcz4_Wd7S4qcQ,5,1,5,DZp7Zeb-eNbMOzXtWffU6w

The Mac n cheese is no longer rich and creamy. It's now baked and oily and comes in a clump. All you taste is macaroni and oil. That's because that's what the owner likes. The French fries are no longer skinny French fries. They are now crinkle fries because that's what the owner likes. This has been the worst BBQ I've ever had. I would rather eat at Famous Dave's and I don't like their food. 

The owner can out and asked if how was everything and I told him that it was horrible. He asked, ""is there anything I can do?"" I told him bring back the old menu. His response to me was, ""not going to happen"" then he walked away. 

The fact that he cares more about what ""he"" likes versus what the consumers that keep coming back like is a horrible way to run a restaurant.

Yes, I did receive a refund. I never asked for one. I'm not one of those people that do that. As for your former employee, I've never met the guy and he is a friend of a friend. I came by to enjoy great BBQ not knowing that it was under new ownership and chef. I was unaware that recipes were changed. 

I am willing to try this again as I understand that not every plate comes out perfect.",3g0SGzfgzev_g_KwValD9Q,2,0,1,1It2XYb4T07OSZep4jP0Nw

2521689,2015-12-01,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Billy's has been on my radar for a while as I'm always looking for a good BBQ place in Vegas.  It's kind of a no frills approach to BBQ but in a good way.  The main focus is the BBQ and food not all the other stuff.  By that I mean it's a pretty casual setting where you order at the front and they bring out the food.  

The food ... I was able to sample pretty much everything as we ordered a lot of food to share between 10 people.  The standouts were the ribs and brisket.  The ribs had a spicy touch and were served dry (not loaded with BBQ sauce).  Which is a good approach so you can add how much sauce you want.  The brisket was tender and had a nice pepper finish, also served dry.  The sides were all good but the beans and mac and cheese were the standouts.  Both full of flavor and made a nice addition to the meal.

A good addition to the Vegas BBQ scene!",8V4y5czt5cn2ioVBjz78UQ,1,1,4,_VBRRD7AoBfqMgqO6nKm6w

I also added mac'n cheese and pickle fries. There wasn't a single item that I ate that I wouldn't give 5 stars to. The meats were tender, smoky and so juicy. I think the best part though was the bark on the brisket. The dry rub mixture here is phenomenal.

The reason is so you can have the opportunity to sample the brisket, ribs, pork, sausage and chicken and two sides. We picked the fried pickles (my favorite) and potato salad. Then we added collard greens which were surprisingly good.  The meal comes with a roll which was light and fluffy. It was perfect for soaking up the juices in my plate.

We called the day prior to see what time they closed, as 8pm is advertised. The staff member told us that they didn't know because sometimes it was earlier. This was a bad sign, as typically that only happens if there's no business and the owner is trying to save money on payroll. Though you end up frustrating customers if they show up at 7, and your door says you're open until 8, only to find out you closed early.

Three guests (two dragged all the way out from Henderson on my recommendation, to try a new local spot that's supposed to be good). -- The free soft serve ice cream sealed the deal for at least one of them. 

- Ice cream machine broken. (Sorry, Ken.)

We were still looking forward to the food, which is supposed to be good. 

- Sold out of sausage. 

Please keep in mind that Adrienne, our cashier, was amazing -- even under pressure. She gets 5-stars, and should probably work somewhere that doesn't set her up for failure.

- Food took forever, presumably because Adrienne was also training two new employees in the kitchen. My friends' orders were first to come out: Cold mac & cheese, room temperature meat, dry as a brick cornbread.

Adrienne was great, and remade one of the plates. 

- My order came incorrect (3-meat platter, with the wrong meat), and also room temperature. However, I don't like piping hot food - so that was fine. Sides came much later. 

We let the staff know that my brisket never arrived, but 30 minutes later (about 75 minutes into our dining experience) we hadn't heard anything - so we packed up a few boxes, washed our hands, and prepared to leave. The missing brisket arrived as we were about to walk out the door. 

A ""sold out"" sign was placed on the door, and the doors were locked, prior to 7pm. Our last 30 minutes or so featured about a half dozen customers looking at us enjoying our food through the locked glass doors -- unable to give Billy's their money (even though 8pm is the advertised closing time).

I love BBQ. I love local BBQ joints. I hate seeing them fail. Even more, I hate seeing four kids (two brand new) thrown to the wolves during a busy dinner rush. Where was ""Billy?""

Got there at 6pm, got most food at 6:30pm, got corrected food at 7:15. Not a good experience at all. (Except Adrienne, who was just trying to hold it all together in the absence of a manager/owner.)

These issues are easily fixed, and I hope they are -- because the food was pretty good. (Aside from the cornbread)",_SUkHEry6KXNQtfIvxnzqg,2,3,1,0R84Q7U191w4DQPnsB7SSA

Have not decided if we will try this place again. Two ad out is probably our limit. I worry about the low temp of the meat and where it was setting -- not on a warmer or in a refrigerator.

My husband and I entered and were warmly greeted by Nik on register. She lead us through the menu and made suggestions.

My husband ordered the 2 meat plate with chicken and pork plus a large side of fries. I ordered a 2 meat plate with brisket and chicken plus 2 small sides of baked beans and corn bread.

It was a short wait and then Nik came out, her arms full of food and set it all down in front of us. Ut oh, did we order too much for just two people?

Very nice sized portions. My brisket slices were thick and had a delicious salt crust along the edge. I didn't need a knife, the brisket fell apart with just the pressure from the fork!

Pulled chicken was fantastic! Nice and juicy, big pieces, not little shreds.

The pork was well cooked and tender.

There are several sauces to choose from. ""White Thunder"" is a vinegar and mayo based sauce and was perfect for dipping fries into. There are also original, hot and smoky sauces to chose from. I mixed the hot and the original to create my own blend.

The staff was very friendly, especially Nik who is very sweet and charming. The food is exceptional. A perfect lunch experience. 

My husband was pleased to see Dr. Pepper as a selection in the fountain sodas.

Where's Phil Collins when you need him?

Anyways, I was really hungry so i ordered the 3 Meat Plate ($17.99) which consisted of Baby Back Ribs, Pulled Pork, and Brisket. Their other meat choices were Pulled Chicken and Spicy Brisket Sausage. Comes with your choice of either 1 large side or 2 small sides I wanted to try more than 1 side so I went with a small Mac n Cheese and Corn Bread. I also opted for a soda ($2.49). Total I spent was a tad over 21 bucks.

At first I thought this was a bit much but after receiving my meal you could say the price was somewhat justified once I saw that portions were generous. After all, they are located in an expensive part of a plaza. The previous restaurant before them was what I thought pretty successful so I was kind of shocked to find out they closed. 

As for the food, the Brisket was really good. It was juicy and had the a touch of smokiness to it. I like the pepper seasoning that they have on it. The Pulled Pork was average compared to some other places. The Ribs? It was kind of a disappointment. It was not all that tender which leads to it not easily falling off the bone. It was kind of bland actually.

Service was just ok. Of course the day I went, they had a new girl working so some mistakes were made but they were genuine in their apologies. You order at the counter and then they bring it out to you. Memo to management: You guys need a better system of figuring who's order is what instead of walking around trying to remember who ordered what. I was given somebody else's order which was similar. Good thing I didnt start digging into it yet.

Lastly, i cant forget to mention their barbeques sauces. They have 3 flavors. Original, hot, and smoky. The hot is a kicked up version of the original. The smokey has a hint of smoke and vinegar. These sauces are available next to the soda machine. Feel free to bring them back to your table. They also have little to go cup containers for you to take some home. Im not sure if you can purchase the bottles because I forgot to ask them. Their sauces are pretty good. in the end, I put all three together on the brisket and pulled pork. They taste pretty good mixed together.

Overall, I thought the brisket here is what really stood out. I will reserve judgement for the chicken and fried pickle chips which I heard were really good. For now I will always compare every barbeque joint to my favorite 5 star location in town. Message me for that particular place and no, its not a chain.

The workers here, especially the ladies at the front, are very helpful and want to make sure you enjoy your experience. I prefer the 3-meat plate of pork ribs, pulled pork and pork brisket (fatty pieces). Aside from the delicious and succulent meats, their sides are on point. The fried pickles have a nice texture (but are not on the regular menu, see if they have them available) and the baked beans come with small pieces of meat mixed within it. My favorite side though is the corn bread.. the butter that comes with it pairs so well with it! The only side I didn't really care for is the mac n cheese, just not my cup of tea.

I know that sounds a bit dramatic, but it is kinda true!

I am doing 4 stars because I liked a so many things here at Billy's...not everything but most everything! The counter service was friendly and a pleasure to order from. 

The most important part of BBQ...THE MEAT!!! Moo, Oink, YES!
REALLY like the flavor of the 3 meats plate! I had Fatty Brisket (DON'T JUDGE! OK, you can judge! I judge myself, but I love the flavor!), smoked sausage and ribs. All three were great. The brisket was delicious and tender, totally fork friendly. The ribs were tasty, and smokey. The sausage was good, had great flavor, a little over smoked but still good. 

The sides I had...Mac and Cheese was my biggest disappointment of the meal. Usually one of my favorite parts, but here is was kind of MEH. A little soggy, and the flavor was nothing special. But for redemption, we ordered ""pickle fries"" - YUM!!! Sliced pickle spears lightly battered and fried. Enough for the table to enjoy for sure!

3167798,2015-06-07,2,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Billy's is one of those places I really wanted to like. We already have a pretty disappointing BBQ scene in Vegas, but Billy's hasn't been open long and seemed to be getting mostly positive reviews. It's been one of my bookmarks pretty much since their opening week . Lately though, I've noticed more negative reviews popping up, so when I walked in and the first thing I heard was a customer asking ""is this supposed to be cold too?"" I had a feeling why...only confirmed after our experience started. 

The restaurant is fast casual style where you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. There's not a whole lot to it, but I liked how it has a locals feel to it. After browsing the menu, I walked up to start placing our order and it turned into a back and forth ordeal. The wifey wanted a pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese, no mac and cheese. Someone at our table wanted chicken breast, out of chicken breast. When they wanted to switch to the wrap, it's made with that same chicken so they could only do it with pulled chicken. My order was the 2 Meat Plate which they thankfully had, but out of greens for one of the sides. I then went to order my son the Super Mac & Cheese forgetting that they just said they were out, but she put it in no problem. I didn't end up putting the two together until after I sat down, but it ended up coming out without a problem. Unless it's just frozen and put into the right size bowl, it was pretty confusing. 

Our food didn't take long to come out, but came out in weird strides. I had my sides of fried okra and sweet potato fries a good 5 minutes before my meat came out. Both sides were okay, but the wife's fried pickles were the best side of the night. I do like that they give you a good size portion on the sides though. If anything, it was maybe even a little too much, as I couldn't even finish mine. 

After we got all of our food, I figured out what the customer I overheard was talking about being cold. My sons Super Mac & Cheese was cold to the touch. Even the meat on top of it was cold, so I don't know if they made it first and let it sit, or what happened...but it wasn't good at all. Even he barely touched it. 

The meat was definitely the star of the show, but it wasn't necessarily shining. Their brisket had a great smokey flavor, and it was tender, but it was much dryer than I thought it would be. I really enjoyed their sausage though, and is my biggest reasoning behind the 3 star review. It's a little tough on the exterior, possibly just a tad overdone that day, but had absolutely amazing flavor. There was great smoke flavor, a really bold peppery taste, and it was probably one of the best sausages I've ever had. It may not look it, but it's not even the least bit dry either. Thankfully so, because I wasn't a huge fan of their sauces. The hot had pretty much no heat, and even though I thought their original was the better of the 3, I couldn't help but feel like they were all just straight from a branded bottle. Had the brisket not been on the dry side, I would have stayed away from the sauce altogether. 
 
Aside from the food, their service isn't the greatest. They have a lot of younger kids working in here, but they didn't seem too familiar with the menu and they seemed more interested in loudly goofing off with each other. We also saw some kid walk in who supposedly use to work there, and walked right into the kitchen. I even heard one of the girls say ""he used to work here, I'm not just letting some random guy in the kitchen""...but then he was kinda wandering around, messing with their POS system and making jokes that they already took him out of it. I don't know if they have a management issue, or don't have one at all, but they kinda just do whatever they want. At least it's a clean restaurant though. 

For 3 adults, and 1 kid, we spent about $50. I like that they give you big portions on the meat and sides, but I wouldn't say the food justifies it, or the drive we have to make to get here. Because the sausage was so good, I'd recommend at least trying that. I myself would come back for it, and maybe even try the ribs that seem to get great reviews...but it probably won't be anytime soon.",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,8,4,3,7buIVSSfvNbjfPvlCAA_tA

The brought things one at a time and also my came out 10 minutes after my fellow guest first item.  My daughter and buddy had ordered the same 3 tacos and in 3 plates with the same tacos on each plate.  Instead of bringing them all at once with the 3 varieties on 1 plate for each of them.  The delivery was a true miss and a big letdown.  They said the smoked chicken taco was the best and the other two just so-so.  I had the Pork BBQ sandwich and sweet potato fries.  The pork BBQ had a slight smoked taste which was deep in the background.  The meat was dry which was another letdown.  The bun had a funny taste from the old oil they had used to toast it on the grill.  
   The sweet potato fries were very good.  Their sauces are spicy and remind me of TX BBQ sauces.  I had asked the young lady who took my order the style of BBQ and got a blank stare.  I have had better BBQ in Vegas at Rolling Smoke which I recommend.

I even order mine lean, and it was still juicy and flavorful.   It was seasoned perfect and it was melt in your mouth delicious.  And much like the brisket in Texas, it really doesn't need any sauce.  They have three choices of sauce, but I didn't have any of them.  The brisket was just that good.  I wanted to try the potato salad, but they were out.  However, after finding out it had onions, I'm glad I didn't get any.  The Mac & Cheese was great though.  The service was good,  I waited five minutes at the most and they were friendly.  The place was also very clean.  Now for the reason it didn't get five stars, besides being out of the potato salad (and it having onions).  The Brisket Baked Beans were quite possibly the worst beans I've ever eaten.  It tasted like someone opened a can of Ranch Style Beans and poured sweet BBQ sauce in them and added some chopped brisket.  And they needed to cook about 30 minutes longer.  It's a little hidden as well.  Just look for the Target and it's in the little strip center in front.  This is definitely the BEST BBQ place in Vegas, hands down.  It was so good, on Friday I got a half-pound of brisket.  I went back Saturday and got a full pound.  And no I've only a small portion of it so far.

3514863,2015-04-02,5,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Despite only being open a few months I think Billy's BBQ has already outlasted the previous tenants, Manhattan Fish Grill. The space is set up as fast-casual restaurant -- order at the counter, grab a seat, and they'll bring the food to you. My two trips here have been for take out. Not an ideal way to sample a restaurants food, but definitely convenient when you're in a hurry shuttling your kid to and from activities. 

The pulled pork was my favorite of the three proteins I've tried. I love the flavor and crispy edges despite the slightly oily aftertaste. When ordering brisket, they give you the choice of a lean or fatty cut, or a mix of the two. The mix was a nice ratio of the two, leaning more towards lean cuts. The dry rub on the brisket provided hints of smokiness and heat making additional sauces unnecessary. The ribs were tender enough but lacked the charred exterior, or bark, that I prefer. They weren't the best ribs I've had but better than what you'll find at any of the chain restaurants around town.

Sides and dessert are their weak link. The mac and cheese, using shell pasta, was thick and gummy, while the cornbread was dry and crumbly. You'll be reaching for a drink with every bite. The s'mores brownie seemed pedestrian -- quality akin to a basic store bought brownie, topped with marshmallows and caramel sauce.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,4,5,3,MGVVYRiz70ub2NkoGlq2Wg

3875214,2015-01-16,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"I really like this place and I'm glad I found a restaurant like Billy's to try authentic BBQ. I actually saw that they catered one of the UNLV basketball tailgate's and Yelped them after I saw comments on the post stating ""I love Billy's."" Normally I would of waited some time to try a place like them out because they are on the other side of town from me! Luckily the same day I Yelped them I needed to be in the area after work for an errand I needed to do.

Originally I was going to try the different taco options, however I was quit hungry so I opted for the 2 entree combo. In my combo I ordered the brisket and pulled pork with sides of corn bread and fried pickles. I am a fan of both of these meats whenever I can have it and Billy's version certainly did not disappoint. I truly tasted the smokey flavor in the brisket and this is something that differentiates real BBQ from all that other stuff. The smokey flavor was mild, but not too overwhelming. The funny part is that when I ordered the brisket, the cashier asked if I wanted a fatty piece or lean piece. I asked lean because I would of felt sick after eating an piece of fatty brisket. I guess that's how know their truly southern when they ask questions like that, haha! Billy's BBQ sauce was okay, if I'm not mistaken there's another review that feels the same way. The pulled pork was good too and was pretty standard. Although I was not amazed by it, I still did enjoy it. I have yet to find one that knocks my socks off. I think I would of enjoyed the pulled pork more in a sandwich? The corn bread was pretty amazing. It was really moist, which is difficult to do with corn bread considering corn meal is so course and try itself. I've corn bread from a ton of other places and theirs is probably one of the better versions. I'm sure the butter that came with it would of made it that much better, I'm trying to sort of cut down on calories. The fried pickles are not on the menu because it's the side special of the month. I read in another review the fried pickles compliments the BBQ well and I don't know if it does but they certain do taste good. I've never had fried pickles before, but I'm glad I tried it. It did not taste odd at all, but pretty good actually. I saw that in the condiment area there was this white sauce submerged in ice. The cashier explains that's their version of another of sauce and adds it's more a vinegar base. I tried it and it was different. It wasn't exactly bad tasting, but I wouldn't use it on my meat entrees the next time I come. It may be awhile till I come here again, but I will definitely recommend Billy's to my friends looking for a good BBQ spot. Please try them out, they deserve your business!

I heard they have free soft serve ice cream cones for dessert, but we were too stuffed to indulge!  I would rather eat BBQ from a place like this than one of the chain restaurants any day!

We are usually John Mulls regulars but it's so far from our house so we tried these guys out today and was not let down! First of all, the girl at the counter was super friendly. We got ribs, brisket, sausage, Mac and cheese and pickle fries. I am a brisket junkie and theirs was so good I had it for lunch then the leftovers for dinner later.  My fiancé LOVED the ribs! The servings were so huge he hasn't tried the sausage yet, so full!! The Mac and cheese was creamy but not soupy. I usually say leave bacon to breakfast but I really liked it in there. The pickle fries are a must try! They were crispy when we got home which normally doesn't happen since they steam in the takeout boxes.

3977811,2015-04-10,5,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"I stopped in with some friends for a late dinner with some friends. What immediately caught my eyes were the BBQ Tacos given I figured that would an interesting unique item to eat. I ordered a trio, the Smoked Brisket, Pulled Pork, and Smoked Chicken for my tacos, and we shared some sweet potato fries. Both the Brisket and Pork tacos were $2.75, and the chicken was $2.50, and the small sweet potato fries cost $2.50.

I liked the tacos, each having their pros and cons. I ate the pulled pork taco first and the meat was good, and they put plenty of the of it in the taco. However, the coleslaw, which I liked, was very saucy. The taco quickly became drenched and sauce just kept dripping out at each bite. The pork was tender and had good flavor. Three Stars..

The Brisket taco came with tender smokey beef, but the meat had to much salt. To make sure, I pulled out of few pieces of brisket to eat on its own, and yes unfortunately is was the meat. This taco also came with the good coleslaw and suffered from the same heavy sauce. Three Stars...

The Smoked Chicken taco was my by far my favorite. It came with an abundant of tender plump pieces of flavor juicy chicken. This too had a lot of sauce from the coleslaw, but the sheer amount of tasty chicken, quickly made up for that. Great taco and an easy four stars.

The sweet potato fries were good. They had a nice crispy exterior and soft center and were well seasoned. Service was hit and miss. It was friendly and efficient at the counter, but there not able to get our food to the table simultaneously, so we politle waited for everyone to have their orders, before we began to eat.

Holy cow can these guys cook cow. It is fork-tender, perfectly smoked, and lined with just the right amount of fat.  It is...well...perfect!

I cannot count the number of times I have gone to lesser BBQ joints for brisket and received something dry, thinly sliced, overly smoked, and chewy.  It is a real treat to find a place that understands how to make it right.  You guys are the super ninja, transformer robot, Obi Wan Kenobis of beef and I salute you.   Now for the intervention...

You guys have mastered the whole meat thing, and are doing our nation's long history of BBQ proud.  But what is up with the fake tea?  What BBQ bureaucrat in your organization tasted this stuff and said to himself, ""Oh yeah, this will be the perfect complement for the world's best brisket!"" (Insert rhetorical pause here...)

BBQ, more than any other food, cries out for freshly brewed tea.  Great BBQ masters around the country spend years perfecting their craft, and see fit to accompany it with such condiments as sliced bread, dill pickles, and real ""brewed"" iced tea. Serving brisket such as yours with soda fountain tea is like serving a perfectly prepared prime filet with Spaghetti O's!  Yeah...I know...now that I have written it, it sounds kind of good...but never mind that...  

You really need to understand the travesty here.  We live in a world that is full of McNuggets, Gorditas, Velveeta, artificial flavors, MSG, and Wolfgang Puck restaurants.  BBQ, on the other hand, is real. It takes us back to our forefathers, out on the open range, cooking meat with fire.  It is food at its purest, and part of our American story! How can that rich heritage be accompanied with tea flavored drink?  It is wrong...almost immoral.

Look, you have done the BBQ-eating world a great service with your outstanding brisket, ribs, and fried okra but you have fallen into fast food purgatory with your simulated iced tea. It does your great food a sad disservice.  On behalf of BBQ lovers everywhere, I implore you to dump the tea-like brown liquid and realize your true potential. Your fifth star awaits!

I have shrimp and links to still try along with some of the sides like fried okra. My favorite sauce was the tangy sauce.

They fell victim to the ""we gotta get bigger"" syndrome. With that being said when I walked through Billy's doors I was beyond happy to see it was a smaller restaurant. Low overhead, no fancy decorations, and no wait staff... This is important because places who fall victim to the ""we gotta get bigger"" syndrome usually fail quick in this town.... 
    I decided a 3 meat combo was in order to see how Billy's does BBQ. I ordered the Brisket, Pulled Pork, and sausage with smoked mac n cheese and fried pickle fries... I knew I was at a TRUE BBQ place when I was asked how I like my brisket, fatty or lean.. The Second giveaway that I was in good BBQ hands was NO SAUCE on my meat!!!!!! Amen Billy's!!!!!!!! I do like sauce but I'd like to taste the meat and decide for myself if it needs any... I tasted the meats and decided they didn't need any sauce, until I tried a spoon of their hot BBQ sauce. It's more of a vinegar based sauce that's not sloppy sticky and sweet. The perfect compliment to pulled pork. Both the pulled pork and brisket were some of the best I've had in Vegas( yes, even better than buzz) the sausage wasn't my favorite but I'm not here for sausage. The fried pickles and smoked Mac n cheese were delicious! My wife got Baked beans and slaw for her sides and loved them both. 
    I hope Billy's never catches the dreaded ""We gotta get bigger"" syndrome and just continues pumping out tasty BBQ. If your food is good enough people will wait!!! I'm excited to add this restaurant to my favorites but will remain cautious because us Las Vegan's have been burned by Q one too many times.",u6oAlwJwpkQywvbTvPgWfQ,2,0,5,cumgyEc9Fu_frzKD3p9N_w

Located along West Flamingo, the restaurant is a few doors down from the children hairdressers Snip Clips.

A nice casual atmosphere, Billy's is an inviting restaurant and friendly staff and a nice aroma will get your engines salivating! When walking in take a sharp left and join the line up.

I can recommend:
 - Tacos: (chicken, pork, beef) they have a wicked Homemade coleslaw that really is something to try!
- Baked Beans: these are the best BBQ baked beans in Vegas. It's a big claim, however I'll stand by it till I sample better.

Service is quick, friendly and well worth the trip!

The Pulled Chicken & Pulled Pork were so tender & flavorful especially when dipped in that Vinegar Mustard Liquid Sauce that is located near the drinks. If you are from Guam like I am its like a good Finadene! The Spare Ribs were fall off the bone tender. Good Sweet Potato Waffle Fries, Tangy Creamy Cole Slaw, Delicious Baked Beans, Soft Bread & Butter & even the Deviled Eggs are yummy. They gave you one Deviled Egg on your platter which is a nice touch offering you a different texture while enjoying your BBQ platter. One star off for not offering homemade Sweet Tea. I love me some Sweet Tea with Lemon! Washing down your BBQ with Sweet Tea go hand in hand & homemade Sweet Tea tastes even better. Sweet Tea is offered but it wasn't made in house so I opted for water. I also saw on their Instagram that last year that Fried BBQ Shrimp was offered but I didnt see it on the menu yesterday. Bring back that shrimp cause it looked Delish! Lucky us we scored some complimentary Peach Cobblers yesterday & it was awesome! Suggestion- Strawberry Shortcake would make for a yummy dessert as well & surprisingly hardly any other American BBQ places offer that dessert. Service was good! Anyways, Billy's isn't located near me at all but the Hubby proclaimed ""I am not eating at any other BBQ place again"". So with that said Billy's has gained 2 more customers & I will spread the word starting with Yelp. Go get your American BBQ on! Go get some!

I know that is not saying much but I feel this place can pretty much hold it's own anywhere it might have been built. So why only 4 stars. I have been there 4 or 5 times and occasionally consistency is an issue. Not a very big issue but still an issue. If you go a recommend the Brisket highly. After that most everything else i have had is good. Start with the brisket and work backwards. I will also let you know most of the side i have had here are good as well.

4156707,2016-01-24,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Cute place, good food...what they had of it. By 6:15, they were out of chicken, brisket and ribs. So I had a pulled pork sandwich. No complaints on that. But why on earth would they be out of 3 out of 5 of their menu choices early on a Friday night? I can only imagine that something must have happened that was beyond their control because certainly a business cannot survive if this is a routine occurrence. That said, I would give them a second chance because the pulled pork was very good and I like that they serve the meat undressed. You select which sauce, if any you would like to use. I know others have raved about the mac n' cheese, but I was not too fond of it because the macaroni was too firm, almost chewy and the cheese was like a runny cheese sauce similar to the consistency of nacho cheese sauce that you get at the fast food places. It also did not have enough flavor for my taste. I like mac n' cheese made with a sharper cheese, preferably cheddar and this seemed like it may have been made with mild cheese or american cheese.

I also liked that they had many different root beers to choose from. I ordered one and was not asked what kind of root beer I wanted, so they must have one for people who don't specify a brand. I can't remember the name of the one I was given. It was ok, sweet but not very strong.

Considering the bad news the person taking the orders had to convey to the customers, he was still courteous and able to smile throughout the dreaded task delivering the ""we are out of"" news to the customers before they ordered to minimize the risk of unhappiness.

Coleslaw now tastes like typical store bought stuff unlike the vinegar based slaw they used to have. The mac and cheese bowl is like commercial mac and cheese and not the rich, creamy, smokey mac and cheese they used to have. Also no more bacon in the mac and cheese.  Again the brisket was bland with little smoke flavor and pieces of dried meat. The pickle fries seem to be the same as is the dipping sauce. You can no longer fill your own bbq sauce cups to go. You have to ask for them to fill sauce for you. Also the sauces have changed. The vinegar based sauce is almost all vinegar and little smoke or spice. Severely disappointed.  Don't know if I will be going back. They had a sign posted that they are changing the menu. Basically adding deviled eggs, collard greens,  crinkle cut fries, peach cobbler, strawberry shortcake.

Our group ordered the pulled pork sandwiches and I had a half rack of the baby back ribs.  The pulled pork portions were generous for $8.95. The half rack was 6 bones which I thought was a little light for $15.99.  The meat was moist, great smoke flavor and done perfectly.  The sides: fried okra - everyone gave 2 thumbs up,  cole slaw - very good, nothing edgy, plain cole slaw with a Marzetti's like dressing, can't go wrong with that, smoked mac and cheese with bacon was loved by 2 of our group and not by the other.  I thought it was well executed with the cheese tasting like a heavily smoked gouda and the bacon adding a nice salty touch.   The BBQ sauces were a slight disappointment being very syrupy.  There were 3: original (very sweet), smoky (almost as sweet as original) and really redundant since the meat was smoked perfectly and a Tennessee hot which was thin and I really didn't enjoy even though spicy is my thing.

I ordered a half lb. of brisket,a half lb. of pork, a large Mac and,a small slaw, and a mini loaf of bread.

Brisket: I ordered 1/2 lean and 1/2 fatty. I was expecting slices of brisket,what I received was what looked like a bunch of scraps. It brought nothing to the table. Dried out and bland (which was weird because there was a big pool of grease at the bottom of the container 

Pork: usually it's chopped or pulled. This was presented as a few big , seriously dried out chunks. Even after dunking in the sauces (which were actually good and almost saved the sub par meat) it was seriously chewy and took work to choke down.

Mac and cheese: Dried out a bit. Not terrible,not special.

Slaw, I didn't try it, my wife had a couple bites and the rest went in the trash

Mini loaf of bread. Pretty stale- like it had been sitting in a steam drawer all day

Complimentary cobbler. Had a few good bites,again seemed old. Would not have paid for it

I'm not sure if it was the time I ordered (7pm) but everything was dried out or stale. It didn't seem like there was any pride taken in this food, and that makes me sad.

4723736,2016-03-15,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Wow...in a city like Las Vegas, there's always going to be too many places to eat...but the good thing is that there's only a FEW places that are actually GOOD!  Finding good barbecue in Las Vegas shouldn't be a task, but it can be.  Some places I have gone to were essentially in really sketchy parts of the city whereas others were way up in North Las Vegas in areas of undeveloped land that had odd hours of operation.

Thankfully, the most heavenly of barbecue restaurants came to me by randomly putting in a Google search of nearby BBQ places in the Summerlin area.  I have to say, it definitely deserves a spot in the Top 5 even Number 1 if possible! Many reviews said that Billy's BBQ was primarily a 'eat til it's gone' type of place; once the available meats are all gone, they're gone.  But that is often to be expected especially when it comes to BBQ.  I accepted this fact and figured I should still give it a shot, who knows?  Given the fact that the photos other reviewers had uploaded were making my mouth water, I knew that was a sign that I had to try it!

My fiancee and I went there on a Friday night to find it tucked away in a nice area of a major shopping plaza on Flamingo and the 215. Walking in, the place reminded me of the Capriotti's in Downtown Summerlin.  Somewhat small in terms of width, but very tall in height.  Seating appeared to hold roughly 18-25 people.

The photo that enticed me the most was a signature dish of Billy's and that was their BBQ shrimp.  I have always loved fish but shrimp was something I never got into until I was about 9 or 10.  I didn't like the idea of fish that was crunchy.  Shrimp to me always felt weird when I bit into it and heard an audible 'crunch' sound.  But I got into it more as I got older and now it's one of my favorite fish to eat.  I'd tried shrimp of wide varieties over the years, grilled, pan fried, stir fried, popcorn, coconut, shrimp toast, shrimp po-boy...listen to me! I'm starting to sound like Bubba from Forrest Gump!  But, truth be told, I had NEVER had BBQ shrimp before!  The photos shown made it look absolutely incredible so I knew I had to try it.  Another thing I have always loved is baked beans.  BBQ baked beans can go one of two ways with me; incredibly delicious or absolutely tasteless.  The look of photos depicting Billy's brisket baked beans looked to be a winner, so I knew I would be ordering those as well.  Finally, the last item that enticed me was Billy's pickle fries.  I have eaten deep-fried pickles before at Buffalo Wild Wings where they serve them sliced as 'Pickle Chips', but what Billy's does is serve them as spears so they more closely resemble fries, hence the name 'Pickle Fries'.

Many reviews recommended that you call ahead and find out exactly what the restaurant is currently out of, especially if you're planning to call after 4-5 PM.  Justin, the owner was nice enough when greeting us as new customers to let us know what he still had available for the night.  This night he was out of ribs which my fiancee and I are big fans of, but we accepted this, me especially since I knew what I wanted was still available.  My fiancee ordered another Billy's signature dish, the 'Super Mac'; an interesting concoction of mac and cheese with brisket, barbecue sauce, and pieces of bacon.  She also ordered one of their hot links which is smoky beef sausage.  With two drinks, altogether our meal cost roughly $29.00.

I had read online that the restaurant serves a wide variety of root beers from around the world, but I decided to leave that for another time.  I am not a mega huge fan of root beer, but I do enjoy sampling different beverages from other countries.  Plus, they have a Pennsylvania staple from when I was a kid, Birch Beer!  I will definitely have to try that the next time I go!

When we sat down, the time it took to get our meal was minimal, we did not request them to bring out everything all at once, nor did we ask them to bring out whatever was ready when it was ready, but we got our main courses first.  The bbq shrimp...let me tell you something...I knew this plate looked appetizing in pictures...but to actually taste it...wow.  They also did something very helpful which was to remove the tails before throwing them into the deep fryer.  I hate, hate, HATE having to use caution when eating fried shrimp not knowing because of the breading, whether to eat the thing whole or to only eat up to the tail area for fear that the shell will still be attached.  NOT AT BILLY'S! The whole shrimp, in the mouth, and pure savory barbecue delicousness!  With a hint of spiciness thrown in as well! The beans? Exquisite! Pickle fries? Out of this world! I even tried my fiancee's plates and again, equally astounding!

I would write more but I'm getting that ""wrap it up"" notice, so I'll just say, try Billy's BBQ and I guarantee, you will be back again!  I myself actually ended up ordering from them again the VERY NEXT DAY!

I got the super Mac bowl /w Brisket.  The smoky flavor was great better then I have had in this town so far. My wife got the brisket sandwich. The portion is pretty large she enjoyed it and wouldn't share!  The two meat plate is huge when you are wanting a lot of food or looking to share a meal this would be your go to. You get two choices of their delicious BBQ. 

On to the sides the sweet potato fries were nothing to rave about they were just sweet potato fries. The Mac was really creamy as a side. Adding the  bacon really gives it that BBQ flavor we crave. The corn bread and cinnamon butter are really good. The corn bread is a sweet corn bread almost like cake with a little bit of that grit you expect from corn bread.  when you add the cinnamon butter it's great even as a dessert. I recommend getting that as a side. 

The banana pudding was really thick pudding with good tasting bananas, and traditional vanilla wafers through out still crunchy. The only thing I would add is a homemade cream on top and not the ready whip. Still it's a great and a good addition for something sweet.  


The down side we had to wipe off our own tables. There was some sticky BBQ sauce left over from the last group of people enjoying their meal.  The bottles were also sticky to touch and made it a little less enjoyable, but still 5 stars.

Smokey flavor-
Any BBQ aficionado would agree that the flavor is in the meat, not the sauce. Billy's has got it down. All of their meats are smoked in high-end equipment that cooks the meat evenly and injects the smokey flavor throughout, so that each bite is packed full of delicious flavor.

Quality meat-
What good is smokey flavor on bad meat? Billy's does not disappoint. The chicken, brisket, pork, sausage, and ribs are all so juicy and tender. The meat falls off the bone, and retains its succulent moistness.

Awesome sauces-
BBQ sauces are enjoyed subjectively. One person may prefer tangy vinegar, while the other may prefer sweet and savory. Billy's offers a variety homemade sauces, each appealing to these different preferences.

Amazing sides-
Pickle fries, southern mac n' cheese, brisket baked beans, sweet cornbread, and much more. I haven't had a side yet that I haven't thoroughly enjoyed.

As we waited we heard the staff say they were on the verge of being out of sweet potato fries and chicken. As customers I don't think we should hear about the shortcomings as we sit in the dining area awaiting our food. Apparently they found some chicken. Our order was delayed while waiting on the chicken. I watched our order go from bagged and ready to go, to removed from the bag and placed back under the heating lamp. As the food sat, the bun (chicken sandwich) became very soggy... I also ordered the Mac and cheese with bacon bits. Sounded really good.

We were in the mood for some BBQ so we thought what better time to try the newly opened Billy's BBQ. I had high hopes for this place seeing that there had been several raves. We ordered the 3 meat combo with 2 sides. The pulled pork was ok, the brisket I was dissatisfied with. Maybe I was just expecting too much. All the flavors were there but the quality of the meat was inferior. They asked me if I wanted fatty or lean brisket and since I couldn't decide, the lady helping me suggested one of each. In less than 10 minutes our food was ready to go. I had a minor issue with the place seeming aloof, they didn't seem very friendly in welcoming customers and I found it offensive they would say bye to some patrons and not to some and in hindsight we were not even offered the ""free"" soft serve they have. But that's just me. 

So fast forward the drive home. I was disappointed when I saw the brisket, one piece was supposedly lean but it was still very fatty and the fatty piece was almost inedible. I thought it'd be just a little fat on top which with the right amount of char will add a flavor burst but it was big chunks and unpalatable. On the brighter side, all 3 sides we tried (mac and cheese, baked beans and honey cornbread) were on point in taste and texture.",JqjAthJThuVYgTh4iWDZ2A,3,1,3,TjiOxrop8rSARcTfElx4Ew

The place has a very simple, minimalistic decor...nothing really special there. Open ceiling, a few TVs on the wall...nothing much. What it lacks in ambiance it makes up for in taste and it does so in a HUGE way.

I split the 3-meat platter with my buddy (MORE than enough food for the two of us) and we each got a BBQ taco as well. The tacos were simple but yummy...great shredded pork with cole slaw...good stuff, but the meat platter was to die for!

We got sausage, ribs, and fatty brisket. For sides, we got Bacon-Mac and Cheese and baked beans. First the sides...they were awesome! Mac and cheese was thick but not curdled. The bacon infusion was amazing and as good as that was, the baked beans were even better. A+

On to the meats...served nice and hot, the sausage was well cooked, just a little spicy, and very flavorful. The ribs fell right off the bone and complimented with their incredible BBQ sauce, they were spectacular. I feel as if I am a better human being now knowing a pig somewhere gave it's life for me to eat it in such a culinary delight. The brisket...it was like eating butter with meat flavor...it melted in your mouth. I'm salivating all over my keyboard at just the thought of one more bite of this delicious BBQ.

Still a decent place to go.,rUF1kmoZWeRb4Bgr2grFzQ,0,0,3,BWgHnY8leWnqkrLM4AMcPQ

Truly a story of following one's passion, owner Billy Palmer a former lawyer turned pit-master at the bequest of legions of local fans, it was just prior to noon on Saturday that myself and two friends stopped into Billy's Bar-B-Que, and finding a large menu with no less than five smoked meats on offer it was with an 'all-in' approach that we invested our appetites, a half pound of each ordered along with three sides and drinks for just over $50 inclusive of tip and tax.

Founded on the motto of ""Real Smoke, Real Flavor"" and featuring what the small restaurant refers to as ""Competition-Style"" 'cue, the process at Billy's is much like that at recently launched Downtown Summerlin's Ribs & Burgers with counterside ordering and tableside service, but with more focus on BBQ than branding the experience is decidedly different, drinks freely refilled at a nearby fountain instead of languishing for water with All-You-Care-To-Eat Soft Serve replacing boozed-up, overpriced shakes.

Clearly focused on the ribs, a lightly mopped dry-rub variety ready to be treated to four additional house-made bottles of sauce including hot, original, smoke, and white, one would be hard pressed to name a better baby-back in the city and although both the pulled pork and chicken proved to be a bit of a disappointment with the former dried out and the later too modestly flavored to be memorable at all the beef options and sides to follow sang an entirely different tune...

Beginning first with the sides, suffice it to say that any beans that include almost as much beef as sauce are likely to be a success and with supple chunks of brisket juxtaposing the creamy red legumes the smoky sweet bowl was amongst the best I've ever had, the creamy macaroni also a well made rendition while the piping hot cornbread was the best 'slab' version in Las Vegas discovered to date - even before the addition of honey butter than further wet the crumb and brought both sweet and savory flavors to a head.

Saving the best to last, though in reality it was the first thing each of us consumed, both the house made beef sausage and, more so, the brisket were of reference standard quality - the former cited as too greasy by one member of the party but to my tastes absolutely perfect while the brisket, offered lean or fatty, was imbued by a thick smoke ring with light char on the surface giving way to the natural sort of flavor that did not require even a drop of sauce to shine - the sort of stuff that would make even a native Texan raise an eyebrow, whether they'd admit it or not.

Like several other Sin City BBQ pits, Billy's is the sort of place where selective ordering can yield the sort of smoked meat likely to impress purists and locals alike, and while not every option is equal the same can be said of any place in America - it's not like anyone is singing the praises of North Carolina Brisket, Texas Pulled Pork, or Kansas City sausage with any regularity either.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,10,3,nmZmrpiBW1xVgIrrvaRkhA

Bad: Portion size for the sausage link was ridiculously small.  Paying over $14 for a two meat plate and only getting one link was mid boggling.

They offer the full line of BBQ meats and sides here, it's a smaller place where you order at the counter and they bring out your meal. I had the combo brisket/pulled pork sandwich (sans slaw) and was impressed. The meat was well smoked, wasn't fatty, and they serve huge portions. Their BBQ sauces are okay but a little sweet for my taste since they don't have a mustard based option. I preferred to mix their smokier and vinegar sauces into my own custom blend. As for the sides, the BBQ beans are excellent with a smoky flavor and the fried okra is tasty as well. Service is really friendly as well.

5749923,2016-07-24,0,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Located just off the 215W and Flamingo (within Target parking lot, bascially next to The Vitamine Shoppe) is Billy's BBQ. Checked out reviews before heading here and pretty much everything is on point with Billy's.

The restaurant is order in or take out. Its a walk up style ordering system with a great squareup check out process that makes things easy or super easy if you have Apple Pay. 
Pretty much Brisket, Pulled Pork, Ribs, Sasuage, Sandwichs and many sides with a few deserts. Be sure to check out their online menu within yelp. 
As for pricing, seems to be consistent with Vegas BBQ and some other competitors with my rating at $$. 

I ordered the 2 Meal Combo which I choose Bristet and Pulled Pork, comes with 2 sides, mine were; sweet potato fries & baked beans and there famous Loaf of Bread. I also ordered 1/4 lb Ribs (dry). The Meats were certainly served in a good portion amount. Brisket was certainly good. Pulled Pork was dried out. Ribs were good with a little bit of fat. Sweet Potoates are just that and baked beans were good as well, not the best but good. The Loaf of Bread is pretty awesome, esp. if it just comes out of the oven.
If you dine in, your meal also comes with Peach Cobbler, which was pretty good as well. 

This is a Southern Style BBQ so it's a little different than the KC and Texas BBQ I am used to but was certainly good. The sauces offered were good, water in nature but just not my particular choice. Again, its more Southern Style.

The restaurant has standard fountain drinks and some speciality bottles to order with a bench style seating along one side of the wall and small 2 person tables thoughtout which can be moved together for more table seating. 
TV and Projection screen are noted.

They do offer All You CAN EAT - DINE IN ONLY.

5913606,2015-01-18,1,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"Heard about Billy from some friends and decided to give them a try. Overall I really liked it, but it did have some negatives. 1) They had a very limited menu. 2) Many of the sides were crossed out (taken off the menu) and  3) only one dessert was offered, soft serve ice cream. That was a big disappointment as I can get soft serve at McDonald's. I would have loved some banana pudding or a slice of pie. 

I ordered the 2 meat mixed plate with ribs, brisket and 2 sides ($14.99). The ribs and brisket were delicious. I love that they use very little sauce, and you definitely don't need any. The ribs were fall off the bone tender and the brisket was juicy and flavorful. The BBQ brisket beans were also very good. Unfortunately the ""smoked"" mac & cheese was not good at all. The menu describes it as made with 6 cheeses but it was very dry and there was no smoke flavor at all. 

I did enjoy our lunch but not sure I would drive across town again just to go back. They need to add some more sides and desserts but the meats are the star here.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,4,1,4,cIq0OPCKMd8DQL29oa3NBw
5953011,2015-06-14,1,dVQFNgVlnxgitEXDQR7tfA,"This review is based on the two times my girlfriend, my friend, mom, dad, and myself went here today, lunch and dinner.

First off the meat quality is phenomenal. I had the sampler plate for lunch and the 3 meat plate for dinner so i got to have a taste of all their meats. The smoke ring on the pulled pork, brisket, and ribs had such deep flavor. All the meats were super tender the ribs pulled away from the bone nicely (i dont like my ribs super fall of the bone which is a good sign a place boils them first). Another great sign this place way awesome is their chicken. Chicken sometimes can be dry and only flavored by being drenched in sauce. Billy's chicken is super moist and very well seasoned. I didn't find it necessary to use any sauce for their chicken infact it was gone before any of the other meats. A tip for their brisket, it comes in a lean and a fatty cut. I was not aware of this durring lunch and thought it was a bit fatty (still delicious ) but when i went back gor dinner the girl that took our order informed us and the lean cut was amazing! The Pulled pork just like the brisket and ribs were smokey and packed with flavor. I can imagine how awesome it would taste on a sandwich with coleslaw. Each meat was moist and flavorful enough i didn't really need the selction of sauces they had at each table (although their smokey sauce was fantastic!)

Now onto their sides: 
Pickle fries: really good! Fried perfectly and wonderful concept of making dill pickles into fries although i prefer cornmeal batter for fried pickles (ie BWW fried pickles) but these were really good!
Mac n cheese: delicious! Perfectly cooked spiral tube noodles in a super creamy cheese sauce.
Baked beans: wonderful sweet and smoked flavor with large chunks of their brisket mixed in. Very well seasoned and the brown sugar sweetness is a nice balance to all the smokey meats on my plate
Cornbread: just the right amount of sweetness and very moist.

Only cons i can think of is their soft serve ice cream was out and after all that meat some soft serve vanilla sounded amazing. So it was basically a tease lol. They also ran out of sausage by night time, but I'm not a fan of hot links (i did try them durring lunch and they were good but it's not something i would order no matter where i eat) also they dont have potato salad yet.

If i didn't have to cut weights for fights i would be at this place a couple times a week especially since i live down the street. All in all besides fancy appetizers and desserts this place beats Lucille's and Rollin Smoke for taste, quality, and convenience.  It wasn't  too packed (maybe because it's still pretty new) they had great combo selection ( 2,3, sampler meat plates) a few nice ala cart selections ( bbq mac n cheese bowl, gutbuster loaded waffle fries, sandwiches, bbq soft tacos,  etc) the service was really friendly too. I can see why the owner won those trophies they have on display above the drink fountains. 

I officially stamp this place RIDICULOUS APPROVED
