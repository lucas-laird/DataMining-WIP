2807179,2017-04-13,2,FgPANtTwZqXB-edLkZTXQg,"When my partner and I went to Las Vegas we walked from Stratosphere all the way down the strip. I was fascinated by all the food options I he never tried before. I was like a kid in a candy store. I couldn't decide what I wanted to eat, but we both knew it had to be somewhere cheap. We walked past what looked like a good court from all the many fast food signs located on a single building. That's when we both saw the Del Taco sign. I didn't think anything of it since I'm from Chicago and we don't have any around there. My partner, however, couldn't hide is enthusiasm. Being a fan of fast food, he told me I had to try it.

Now I'm a huge fan of Taco Bell (this is where you hate me or agree with me) so I was already walking into it thinking I'd hate it compared to TBell. I have to say I'm glad I tried it. The prices are cheap, and they have a pretty decent selection on their menu. Some which you can't get at TBell like fries, burgers, and fish tacos. I decided to go with the fish taco and fries.

I fell in love with it instantly. The fish was crispy, and piping hot. The batter had a delicious flavor to it because it is beer battered. I can't express how much I love beer battered food. On the taco it came with a combination of cabbage and a secret sauce which honestly combined tasted like coleslaw. I was fine with that though because the cabbage was crunchy and the sauce was creamy. It went perfectly with the fish. 

I have to mention the French fries too. I'm surprised a taco place could make me gasp in amazement at their French fries, but Del Taco did it. They were crinkle cut, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, salty, and the right amount of greasy. A perfect fast food fry. The whole meal was delicious. I just wish I hadn't eaten at a buffet a couple hours before so that I didn't feel like death after stuffing Del Taco down my gullet.

It's fast food, but no food should be discriminated against. Give it a try if you're cheap and got a hankering for some good fast food. I obviously recommend the fish tacos.",uwavnlkvnttiDEbrNXYgvA,1,1,4,Slq1PlWUzA0h_qBUR5XhPQ

But as Josh Q says, this Food Court is terrifying. The odd combination of overpriced fast food that is available in 99% of the rest of America for like 1000% less than is sold here is disgusting. 

After waiting in line for what felt like an eternity, the less than chipper young chap takes my order of 1 carne asada taco, 1 chicken asada taco and chips/cheese. You know I'm a high roller when I get the $3.00 taco! 

I wait...and wait....and wait....food finally comes out. I was really hoping they were back there slicing the carne asada to perfection for my delicious feast I was awaiting. Turns out, after one bite, it was more suited for the little doggies in Mexico. 

On the first bite of taco #1, I can't identify the meat which was room temperature. NO WAY it was steak! It was a gelatinous square chunk. The texture was one that makes me cringe when thinking about. 

So, I push the first to the side and ravenously bite into my second taco...chicken, that should be better, no? WRONG. Same texture, different color. They must have some machine that is manufacturing meat pellets, made with two different colors (yellow for chicken and brown for steak). 

Even after a few glasses of champagne and feeling what I can only describe as Ethiopian hunger...I threw that nasty stuff away! I couldn't even choke down 1 bite.

This DT caught my eye one night while we were driving back to our room. Had I been driving, we surely would have been rear-ended because I have a tendency to slam on my brakes when I see their happy signs.

Note: I only order crunchy tacos. Whether I'm at Del Taco or Taco Bell, I do not stray from my simple order: between 3 and 8 crunchy tacos. I usually prefer them with light meat and extra lettuce. They have to have 3 packets of hot sauce (I like to use one mild, one medium, and one hot) and a half-packet of salt. 

So here we are in Vegas and I see DT, so of course (!) I made my husband park even though we'd been on our feet all day and were exhausted. We found a parking spot several blocks away and walked through a detour for construction and around some dark corners until we were finally back on the strip and headed up to the food court. 

A polite employee gave me my tacos ($1.59 each) and the night was complete.

Several hours into a hike on the Las Vegas Strip taking in the Christmas decorations that took me from Mandalay Bay all the way north into the Fashion Show Mall and back, it was time to get off the trail and enjoy a quick bite. 

    This Del Taco is the only location on the Las Vegas Strip (as of 12/27/2015). It is located upstairs in the Showcase Mall Food Court. This is a popular food court that frequently fills up with people. By the time I reached the Showcase Mall I was hungry. I was undecided on the food court's Panda Express, Wendy's, Popeyes, and Subway. When I saw nobody on line it was a spontaneous decision to make my ultimate meal of 2015 on the Las Vegas Strip Del Taco. For years I was cognizant that they serve the underrated Del Double burger. 

     The woman that took my order was friendly. So was the price. The Del Double Value Meal (number 4) with  fries and fountain Coke up sized to medium came out to $7.35. This is a similar price that I have paid in the local Del Taco locations. Kudos to Del Taco for not price gouging. 

    Fortunately there were a few available tables. More fortunately this was a good fast food experience. The double cheeseburger did the job. What is unusual about the sandwich is that the tomato was in the of the meat on the bottom bun. With that flaw aside, the double cheeseburger featured the right amount of chopped onions, cheese, and flavor. The cup of fries was a good but not spectacular tasting compliment to the sandwich. 

  Del Taco is more than just tacos but less than some of the new generation fast food chains such as Shake Shack just across the street.

I just needed a snack, so the order was two crunchy Del Tacos and a drink.  Service was friendly (we even made a joke about how the total came out to $7.00 exactly), and the food didn't take long.  Although the tacos weren't as tasty as Taco Bell's, they were a little bigger and seemed to have better quality ingredients.  The beef wasn't as greasy, the lettuce and tomatoes were fresh, and the cheese was plentiful.  By the way, they get points just for having tomatoes, as Taco Bell took them off their regular tacos long ago.  Only problem were the taco shells - while they were crispy and tasty, half the taco would shatter at the first bite, so I would have to do some remnant shell scooping action.

For a quick snack, this place was just fine.",f4UOzbbwydfhqOic1PKYvg,0,0,3,VzzOlTPBmNFqJWOQHFMyJQ

Received bean, sour cream, avacado and egg and a minimal amount of sauce.  It definitely could have used more.  It lacked overall flavor, just not very tasteful.  It could have used some pico de gallo, or at least salsa.  It did fill the stomach, just didn't satisfy the taste buds.  The one good thing about the burrito is that the way it is wrapped, It can be eaten while walking down the strip.",OHA60MI7B5tYBzE_4HaZTQ,0,0,2,AM7wZP4nTR1nW9-IQN_rFA
