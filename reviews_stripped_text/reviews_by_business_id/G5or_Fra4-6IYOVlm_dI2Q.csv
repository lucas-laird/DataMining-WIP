4352,2013-06-19,0,G5or_Fra4-6IYOVlm_dI2Q,"My boyfriend and I stopped in here for dinner. First we went to the bar directly off of the casino, where we waited about 5 minutes and were not acknowledged once. We figured maybe we would have better luck getting a table. We stood in line at the hostess center, where there was one party of about 6 ahead of us. I'm not sure what was going on, there was a lot of back and forth between the party(who I don't think spoke great English) and the hostess, but we waited our turn for 5 minutes or so, while doing so the line behind us grew even longer of people waiting. At no point did the hostess even look up at any of use, and since the party of 6 was still in front of us, we waited. From the other door a couple walked up around the waiting party, and asked the hostess about seating, and she put them down!!! UMMM Excuse me??? You have a line of people waiting honey, why don't you try looking up! 
Needless to say we left, plenty of other choices in Vegas, although I think it's important to point out, we looked in the windows after leaving, and there were plenty of open tables. REALLY?",cwmozH0btTWP1a84TLoSJQ,1,0,1,2kLDaM2LFlrrapnnGrBVLw
10141,2012-03-24,1,G5or_Fra4-6IYOVlm_dI2Q,"Went for Karaoke on Tues/Weds night 8 pm. We went ""early"", not knowing how the set-up was. Sat at the bar, bartender seemed ""aloof"" and annoyed they he had to serve drinks. We did not tip him at all. We then moved to the seating around the bar area which was getting crowded. Service was a tad slow, but OK. The bigger room was closed off for a private party at 6pm. We thought this party was going on all night, but actually ended at 8. However, no signs telling anyone of this.

So the Karaoke guy shows up at a few minutes before 8 and seems pissed off that I'm asking him his procedure. You know, like sign in sheet, or internet choices etc ? Every Karaoke is different. 

So, anyway, Karaoke gets going and I'm 2nd up and was great, Excellent sound system screens etc. Only got to sing 2 songs because everybody and their brother starts coming in and gets to sing immediately, so rotation keeps getting pushed back.

We will be back in June again. Waitresses dressed in Bikinis with chaps seems a little corney, and mechanical bull is really corney, especially with 50 something lardos  mounting up.",6UXGaTo6_xySXmEah0gzGA,0,0,4,X4MuG98cyzeK8BxJ0L5ejQ

The food was nothing remarkable, just bog standard burgers and fries etc but it was pleasant enough and the cocktails are good!

There were big TV's which kept our children happy with the baseball and soccer coverage.  We went at a Monday lunchtime so it was quiet.

The brisket at Gilley's is a glaring memory from my last Vegas trip (and having any memory of something in Vegas is saying a lot). It was just plain GOOD and I will go here and order it everytime I come back to Vegas. The corn muffins were also really tasty. My boyfriend got the nachos and loved them.

We also stumbled upon our new favorite whiskey at the bar...Red Stag. It's a black cherry whiskey an dis incredible...ask the bartender to serve you a shot chilled and it's even better. Sadly we were only in the bar while waiting for our table so we didn't ge tto party there that night, but next time we're in Sin City one night will be spent there.

Of course, but we went in the abr area, had some drinks and watched people ride the bull....we were seated in no time.

My mom, sister, and I were here this past Thursday and out of our entire trip, coming to Gilley's was the one thing on our to-do list. We had previously scoured websites for things to do in Las Vegas that would be different and interesting and not terribly expensive. So imagine our excitement when I stumbled across the website that boasted Thursday Night Ladies Night and free dance lessons at 7pm! We left our hotel down the strip early enough to arrive in an Uber just after 7pm. Having donned our ""Gilley's outfits"" and ready for a good time, we ordered our drinks with the expectation that the Ladies Night Special $1 well drinks and Bud Light Drafts would make our bill 3 dollars for our first round and then we'd learn how to do a country dance. We were heartily disappointed and utterly upset that we paid 23 dollars instead and were so discouraged that we entirely missed the 5 minute dance demonstration (Only 1 dance? C'mon.) Yes, we should have gathered the courage to mention something about the $1 dollar drinks before paying (and I will say that we never got a receipt), but the whole reason we came was to see what Gilley's was about and not break the bank. 

We had sat at a table with our cups and beer bottle empty, ready for another round, but feeling quite deceived...and none of the scantily clad bikini wearing waitresses came to see how we were doing. So I let go of my pride, went up to the bartender, and asked if tonight was Ladies' Night and if that meant $1 drinks. I told her that we paid 20 dollars for ours (plus tip) and that it was no big deal, but that if I wanted to order anything else, would I be getting the deal? At the same time I was talking with the bartender, one of the waitresses approached my mom and sister at the table (or my mom tracked her down. Either way, they were talking to someone, also). The bartender I was speaking with pointed to my table and said that ""oh, they're talking to someone now. I'm sure she can help you with that"" and said it in a way that made me feel like an idiot. Not only that, but it seemed very dismissive, as she walked away and expected me to return to my table, sans drinks. 

When I took a seat, the waitress said that if we wanted the special, we had to mention it. She, too, walked away. It was clear that we would not be receiving a refund (not that we expected it), but neither bartender, nor waitress, seemed inclined on taking an order from us now that we knew the secret to cheap drinks. 

I felt embarrassed and furious that we had planned this amazing time here at Gilley's on our last night in Vegas, and not only had we paid way more than expected for our drinks, but we didn't get to learn how to dance. 

We left in a pretty terrible mood. Customer service was severely lacking. The dance session was bogus. We were drawn in by an advertisement that wasn't automatically applied. And we left upset without a backup plan, having had the expectation that Gilley's would be amazing. 

We tossed around the phrase, ""oh, that's Gilleys"" if something was lame or stupid. 

I don't mean to be a sourpuss because the rest of the night turned out great. We spent full price on our drinks everywhere else up and down the strip and had a ton of fun making fun of Gilley's, knowing that no one there probably actually gives a shit how our night started, and that we won't ever be back.

Lesson Learned: if there is an advertised deal online, you HAVE to mention it. Don't expect it to be automatically applied. And there are plenty of bars on the strip that have amazing service...there's no reason to stay in a place that disrespects you and chooses not to take your order.",qU60OvB7Hy9L9j7ymhaU3Q,11,3,1,i5Iusp6S1EztsZDepZvWUg

Beer selection was ok. Being very misleading on the happy hour sign was not. The sign says there are specials on all draft beers during happy hour, but apparently they define All as only being bud light, michelob ultra, and some other meh beer.

That leaves the roughly 6 other draft beers (where all the craft beer is hiding) to be left out of the special. It also leaves me with an incorrect definition of the word All. 

oh, they also don't tell you all the beers you were expecting to be on special aren't actually on special until you attempt to order one and verify that it's on special. If you don't verify, you just order a $7 beer that you'll be surprised to find is $7 later.",JTbWKeaQLH0w2TWCiRjq4g,2,0,2,g_-2w1kk7pzPBtLqLdTL8Q

The sweet potato fries could definitely have been crispier and I would have sent them back but decided it might take too long. A decent but not outstanding meal. 

After dinner at around 8, I believe , there was a complimentary line dance class and two of our party jumped right in.  The rest of us sat back and watched and it was very enjoyable. The resident dance instructor was personable and clearly knowledgable and I later learned from another patron that he (Tim) also teaches at other places like a Revolvers, etc...although I'm actually a ballroom dancer I was fascinated to watch the crowd having a great deal of fun in class.

We were extremely disappointed in the bar and restaurant service. First thing was that they do not offer a small appetizer type menu in the bar. It's strictly for drinking. Ok, no big deal. We hung around to listen to a few of the patrons sing some karaoke while we got familiar with the bar atmosphere. After about 20 minutes we decided to head into the restaurant area to order some dinner. Although it was a slower night, It still took a while for our waitress to pay us a visit to take our order (10 min) She was a semi friendly waitress. While we waited for our meal we noticed a good size bug (maybe roach) walking across the floor near our table. So when she brought our order back, within 8 min, we informed her of the bug and she didn't seemed too surprised. She flagged over a bus boy and told him about the bug. He moved a chair or two and then went about his business. Basically he didn't do anything.
The meal was brought out quickly but it had major flaws. The entire meal was luke warm. Like it had been warmed up in a microwave. We had a slab of ribs, macaroni, some cheese tots and a muffin. All the food had basic dull flavors. We decided to go ahead and eat anyways since we were rather hungry and also didn't want to waste more time walking to another location on the strip. I was expecting the meal to be a little tastier based on the description on the menu. I guess that's what we get for expecting.
In the end, we informed the waitress about our experience and she did apologize for the experience. However she said we could have told her sooner and maybe she could have had the chef cook us something different. The funny thing is that she didn't pay us our second visit until the end when she brought us our check. Not once did she return after serving us to check how things were or if we needed a refill or anything. Had she returned at least once, she would have been informed sooner. I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends. Its one of those gimmicky restaurants and we experienced the faults of it. Oh we'll, that's one to learn from.

Now, 4 years later, we were thrilled to know that it opened up again at TI.  It was the very first stop we made when we arrived in Vegas.  Honestly, we were disappointed.  It lost its charm, it appeal, it became commercial.  The food was decent but defiantly more expensive.  You could no longer choose from a huge list of burger toppings to personalize your burger.  The portion sizes were smaller and the prices significantly higher.  The menu had a very limited selection as well.

One of my favorite movies ever is Urban Cowboy, so I HAD to visit Gilley's while visiting Vegas!
We came in around 5pm, through the restaurant. We weren't hungry, I just wanted to check it out and maybe have a drink. It wasn't super busy, the bar was full but there were tables all around and an area that was roped off. We took next to the dance floor and ordered a beer to enjoy while we watched the scenery. I was excited just being there. Seeing the stage, mechanical bull, taking it all in.
After a bit no tables opened up so my husband went to ask if we could get a stool and sit where we were. A nice guy went to check on that, came back and said there were none left. We asked if we could sit in the roped off area and he said yes, but that we would not have a great seat for the show. Wait, what show? We had no idea there would be a show, we just came in on impulse. He said that at 7pm Uncle Cracker would perform! It was already 6ish so we decided to stay. Finally 2 seats opened up at the bar so we grabbed them. Great view of the stage and the TV that showed a close up, right behind us. The bar started filling up quickly.  The show moved to 8pm but we did not care we watched the dancing in the dance area, made some new friends and had a blast! Time flew, Uncle Cracker came out and did a great show!

Drinks are the same as everywhere else. Expensive. But knowing that, you won't be disappointed. We had a great time here. We had no idea they have shows every week! The week before had been Gretchen Wilson.

We went there for Sunday brunch before heading home. We did not have high expectations, and yet, it was really disappointing. To drink we had Bloody Mary's - $10 each and were so SO basic... not strong and only tasted like gross tomato juice. And to eat, we shared the Pulled Pork plate, with a side of the Jalapeno Tots and Mac & Cheese. It was just sad, like they don't even care about the flavor or quality of the food AT ALL. The pork was luke-warm and lacking any flavor whatsoever, piled atop a piece of mushy bread, which I think was supposed to be Texas toast, but was basically just some soggy goo under the meat. The Jalapeno Tots were pretty tasty but clearly just something out of the freezer that was thrown in the deep fryer. The Mac & Cheese was beyond flavorless and totally mushy and overcooked. We were sharing a plate and didn't even bother to finish our food. On the bright side, the waitress was nice and the water wasn't terrible. The decor was kind of fun and the concept is a good one.

Entertainment: It was a Thursday, so ladies drink for a buck in the bar. There was line dancing, bull riding, and with the low cost of alcohol there were plenty of poor decisions to witness and enjoy. We got a lucky table between the mechanical bull and the dance floor, and it was non-stop entertainment. The sound levels were just about perfect, too--they made sure you could hear the music without trying to blow out eardrums in the process.

Food: This surprised me a bit. We got a couple appetizers and split a BBQ combo. It was delightful, and we enjoyed the meal without feeling like we over ate yet again on the trip. The portion sizes were just right in my book.

Atmosphere: Very laid back and casual. Wide range of ages, and not too many recycled prom dresses you generally see most nights out. It was comfortable, and we liked that.

Service: Our waitress hustled. She had a lot of customers to serve, but we never felt like we were forgotten. Orders were filled quickly, even my soda cup (I'm not really a drinker) stayed topped off. I didn't need the somewhat sexy uniforms to make me enjoy the place, but most importantly they didn't detract from the service by feeling sleazy. That's a very difficult balance, and it was great to see how they pulled it off successfully. To some degree, showing the extra skin meant they weren't sweating so much as they hustled around the bar.

My wife and I are certainly fans. Our total bill came up under $60. We'll be back on a future visit to Las Vegas.",ABDX6W3QRkiKYd36fMfn_Q,2,0,4,CraabHXPQ5vGzEKhSjo6Zw

Ok.....I like about 8 country songs, so getting dragged to a country bar was not my plan, but last Friday (4/13) I obliged, and found myself in the epicenter of silliness and random nonsense.  

Before arriving, I was asked by a friend if I could ""two-step?""  My response:  ""Like, my drink and my two-step?""  Then I was told that two-stepping is what they do at country bars, it's like hillbilly ballroom dancing.  This bar has that. 

Here's a bunch of other random stuff I noticed on my visit:

Lots of dirty old cowboys doing inappropriate things (spitting beer all over their wives for example).
A mechanical bull with an operator that knew what he was doing.
A very authentic country band (very talented, I forget the name, sorry)
In a well-lit, country bar, the stereotypes about white people being bad dancers are hilariously true.  I think copious levels of alcohol had something to do with all the bad moves.  
If you learn the electric slide, you never need to learn another line dance again, they do it to every song.  



This bar reminds me of a lot of college bars around the country:  Same level of intoxication, but more tourists, and less lacrosse hats.

After walking the strip for the past few hours  we kept smelling that damned BBQ so naturally with us being from the south (ATL shawty lol) we opted to eat here and get our 'grub' on.

We chose to sit inside because the restaurant sits literally BTW the boat at T.I. and the boardwalk where everyone walks and I am not a fan of putting on a show while eating. 

The guys ordered a pitcher of beer and the girls got either soda or water. I'm assuming the server was new bc it took him forever to bring our drinks (not beer bc I understand that comes from the bar, but 10 min for water and fountain drinks for 4 people in a slow restaurant is not a good look). The bartender ended up taking our orders and waiting on us for the remainder of the meal. I can't recall what everyone else ordered but I think one of the meals might have either been quesadilla (i can never spell that right) or sliders. But 2 of us ordered the short ribs, including myself and man-o-man was that good. 

The Shot rib (rib because it was only one, and had I not have had two sides I may have been a little pissed off) was prepared the right way, whichever way that may actually be, but the meat fell off the bone! They had variations of sauces at the table people could choose, don't remember the flavors all to well but they were what I would expect from a west coast Vegas-y restaurant, and with my expectations not being set too high for the sauces to blow my mind, I was pleased. My side dishes consisted of baked beans and mac & cheese. Again, my southern roots didn't sway me to expect them to be like moms homemade dishes, I was fairly pleased with them. I give the place a B- simply because I love BBQ and that particular day we hadn't eaten except maybe once and had walked from PH to the N & S parts of the strip all day so maybe my stomach appreciated the meal more than my taste buds.

The server/bartender whom we saw all of 3 maybe 4 times got the minimum tip from us bc she wasn't as attentive as she could have been esp with it not being crowded at all. And had this not have been Vegas they might not have gotten anything.

The meals are not cheap, but then again what is 'cheap' in Vegas. Even the McDonalds isn't cheap, but one should expect to spend $$$ when you come here for leisure otherwise, why come right? All in all, I would come again if I have the urge for BBQ. I won't expect the best service, they just better be sure to have my food right.",UuWKm_gpXDcnPguoDbwUAQ,0,0,3,I2PuZeLZtUFdvWehYLkd5Q

First of all, someone please tell me why the kitchen is out in the open right when you walk in...with bright cooking lights shining and only a few feet away from the dance floor. Talk about mood kill. When you are trying to have fun and dance and drink with friends... it's kind of awkward to have an open kitchen right in your face. Just a stupid and awkward set up. The kitchen should be in the restaurant area, not the night club area. 

We did go sit in the back and grab food before we headed to the ""club"". It was just okay. Nothing to write home about. Too expensive for what it is. I got a cajun hamburger and fries, which cost $16. Then, I got a Sangria to drink which was $10. After it was all said and done after tip, My meal alone was $32 bucks. A little ridiculous for one person for average food that wasn't even that good.

I went last night which was a Sunday, so not sure how the rest of the nights are... but this place is 100% country. Stoneys at least breaks it up and will play some booty shakin freestyle dance music every hour or so to change it up, which I like since I don't really country dance well. Unless you are a die hard country music lover, this place probably wont be for you. They didn't even play cupid's shuffle or the cha cha slide. The basic fun and less country line dances that everyone knows and loves.

Now the final straw.. This bikini bull riding. It went on ALL night long pretty much. It consisted of mostly overweight or obese women in bikinis and underwear trying to look sexy on the bull... while the lighting and jiggling of the bull accentuates every dimple and unsightly flaw. I was embarrassed for them. However, this was mildly entertaining, plus there was some fun and nice people there to talk to from a convention that made good company.... so that's why I give 2 stars. 

The old Gilleys was a blast. Had a bigger and better lay out. Had better ambiance and appeal and seemed more with it.. and more like a night club and bar. This Gilleys has the wrong lay out and you are next to a bright kitchen and a small dance floor, and watching the bull is the highlight of the night.

He, his wife and a couple of his friends were coming out to Vegas to participate in a Spartan Race and celebrate his birthday. 

This Gilley's is located inside Treasure Island ( I mean, the T I...) facing Las Vegas Boulevard. I will say, the whole country and western thing ...not really my cup of tea (or sarsaparilla ). But, I am always up for good barbecue if that's what's advertised and so I will reserve judgment (or at least try...). So, its Saturday night and my wife calls to make a reservation, but apparently they only take them for parties of 12 or more...huh? We decide to take our chances and head down to the Strip anyway, and after an hour of waiting we were finally seated (we almost decided to bail and go to Señor Frogs next door). 

Our waitress and waitstaff were nice and very attentive, even getting my brother-in-law a strawberry shortcake dessert with a candle and singing Happy Birthday to him...I won't get into what everyone ate, they all seemed to enjoy their meal. I will only comment on what I ordered...I usually judge a barbecue joint by how good their Brisket is, so I ordered the Brisket filet which comes with 2 sides. I decided to get the 3 cheese Mac and cheese and BBQ beans, figured you can't go wrong with those ( or can you?)...the beans were a little soft and bland, the Mac and cheese tasted a little gritty (I think the flour in the cream sauce hadn't cooked off maybe and it was topped with unmelted shredded cheese...good Barbecued Brisket is usually juicy, smokey, and kind of melts in your mouth...this Brisket was dried and chewy and way to fatty. Not even the drenching in BBQ sauce could help it, kind of disappointing considering this is a Strip restaurant.

So then it was on to the entertainment portion of the evening, we took the party over to the club and dancehall part of Gilley's. Just in time for the band to take the stage ( I forget the name, but they were pretty tight), playing what I'm sure are decent covers of today's top country hits. I only recognized the country song that Hootie did (wagon wheel?)...look, there's the mechanical bull! That looks like fun...mm, maybe not. Not drunk enough. Also, a big dance floor for the two-steppin'. Looks like fun...not for me.

If country, cowboy hats, NASCAR caps, and the two-step are your thing, this place place is for you...I probably won't be back for the BBQ, but I might come back for the bikini and chaps-clad waitresses and the drunken girl ""R"" rated mechanical bull riding.",rkZ_FQ1yWxPOm3JCv_wKwQ,1,0,3,z_qyvn6eFqgBhlh_wvUn0g

There are posters all over TI advertising the place, with the girls in their (tiny) black bikinis front and center. My husband and I were looking for a bit to eat on our last night in town and got tired of walking around so we settled on Gilley's. I am an avid country music (and western wear) fan, so I felt right at home. You walk through the bar and dance hall section to the restaurant in the back, which has a completely different feel than the front of the establishment. I immediately regretted our choice when I realized Yelp's average was an unimpressive 2.5 stars, but since we were hungry we decided to stay anyway. And boy, am I glad we did!!

 My husband had the pulled pork sandwich with a side of the two-cheese mac & cheese, and I had the Gilley's chili with a side of mac & cheese. The chili wasn't at all anything to write home about - a little too thin and runny and the texture of the beef reminded me of Taco Bell. However, the chili came with jalapeno corn muffins which were AWESOME... cakey and dense but not dry with the perfect amount of jalapeno flavor. I ordered two more on the side for $1. My husband made a complete mess of himself eating the pulled pork sandwich, declaring with confidence that it was easily the best one he had ever had. While I make dramatic declarations like this all the time, he does not, so this is quite an impressive comment coming from him. The mac & cheese was excellent, and service was very friendly and prompt. Lona, our waitress, took care of all our requests very quickly. I did leave with an empty plastic boot, which you can get filled with a margarita for $17. Since I wasn't up to being three sheets to the wind 16 hours before needing to board a plane, I opted to take it home empty. It was cheaper than the cowboy boots I had been ogling at Boot Star in Fashion Show the day before!

In the past few days, I joked about wanting to check out a one star venue. I now feel the pain of the "" be careful what you wish for"" theory. 

I popped into Gilley's at TREASURE ISLAND for the ""first night of business"" aka #epicfail

As my friends and I were in line, we were notified by the ""host"" (guy in black polo indicating security) that there was a $20 cover, but free if we are guests in the hotel. Luckily, my friends were indeed guests at the TI and I snuck in with them. No way in hell I am paying cover for a bar inside a hotel...especially since it's not a club.

Next...why should I be paying cover for a place that hasn't even had it's grand opening yet? And shouldn't a complimentary cocktail ticket be in order? SOMETHING...ANYTHING?

Once we got in, we were introduced to a large dance floor a few people were line dancing. I'm not going to slam this place on it's ""culture"" because we chose to come to this ""country"" themed bar. But this place was kind of empty. Lame. Fail. Get me out. 

Next to the dance floor, there is a gigantic mechanical bull, where cougars, and less than attractive women pay five or so dollars to ride it. Fun for a little giggle. My friends rode the bull, and we took pictures. It was fun.

Unfortunately, the drunken messes before and after my friends, made the mechanical bull less of a novelty for tourists, and more of a shaming device for men and women who need a bull to feel ""wild"". I'm not going into this any further...use your imaginations. This place needs a better crowd...especially for the first night.

On to the drinks. Beer selection is your usual Budweiser garbage. No craft beer. Drinks are reasonably priced. A friend got a tequila shot (double) for $13. Beers are about $5. Reasonable for Vegas I suppose.

My real ""beef"" with this place isn't the bad beer, the crowd or the line dancing to Lady Gaga (yes, it really happened, and I have video). 

The fact that this was ""opening night"" and they were willing to charge people a $20 cover is disturbing. Also, they should have packed this bar with the plethora of girls and dudes that stayed at TI....this is spring break season. 

I'm no crystal ball or anything, but I don't believe this place will be in business long.

If you want the novelty of riding a mechanical bull, do it now, before this turns into a better, cooler joint.

Before I go, I do want to point out one thing. There are hot girls here, but they are the shot girls, and servers. It was all great for the usual ""ha ha"" the girl is wearing chaps. But it got old when this place was so dead, that these girls were dancing with hammered patrons. Count. Me. Out.

We waited a long time to find two bar stools for 4 of us to sit. It almost reminded me of the first day of college and trying to find a parking spot and people parked at the ends like vultures, when someone would get up from their seats. So when we finally got some seats it made me nervous to get up to dance or use the restroom in fear of someone taking our seats. The bartenders/waitresses never asked us if we wanted drinks. Oh yes! there is a kitchen inside the club LITERALLY (making food) which at first I thought GREAT we can order some food! When I went up there to order some food I was told that it's for the restaurant....which made me confused because WHY IN THE HELL IS THERE AN OPEN KITCHEN IN A COUNTRY BAR IF ITS NOT FOR THE CLUB??? 

Another major complaint...I had (4) margaritas which tasted more like sugar water with the lack of tequila. The drinks were overly sweet and very little alcohol. So unless you're planing on taking shots or drinking beer...I don't recommend any of the girly drinks.

Gilley's Saloon may be over the top, but that's what else would you expect from a country saloon on the Las Vegas Strip.  It's the quality of the experience that matters in a casino bar.

Gilley's is known primarily for hosting bikini bull ridin' on its mechanical bull (Thursdays & Sundays at 10pm).  And I have to applaud them for the showmanship.  Vegas runs on skin.  And putting skin up on a bucking mechanical bull draws a crowd.

They have other nice touches to drive home the country bar feel.  Bar stools have been replaced with saddles (with stir ups for your feet to make sure you don't topple over after one too many shots).  There's country music and dance floor that gets going some nights.  The drinks are served up at casino prices which are a little high for your average country bar, but you're paying for the real estate--drinkin' on the strip ain't cheap.

Ofcourse there's rodeo type paraphernalia all around the restaurant! Now I know this is a bar be que spot,  but since I'm not the biggest fan of BBQ, I had the salmon.  And the food was simply amazing! I like to think that I'm a very picky eater because there's plenty of things that I don't like.  But every last thing that was on my plate I greatly enjoyed.  The salmon was delicious!  For sides I had cream corn,  mashed potatoes,  and the jalapeño cornbread.  Each of those were amazing in their own right.  I wanted to order a second plate to go just so that I could have more for later. But I didn't want to seem greedy, plus my room didn't have a microwave in it.  My boyfriend ate the BBQ and he seemed to have fairly enjoyed it.  I'm not sure why there isn't a Gilley's in LA, or if there is one for that matter,  but I am sure that every time I find myself on the Las Vegas Strip this is where I'll be eating.",qlNPLTOWh19Oa6zU5SrZ6Q,1,1,5,V_INogS5QthvbLo7ko0-TQ

2176273,2012-07-01,0,G5or_Fra4-6IYOVlm_dI2Q,"I tried out this bar/restaurant while staying at Treasure Island in Vegas.  This place is located inside the hotel but also has two parts.  This place touts itself as a place that has a Hooters theme with a cowgirl twist.  Basically, they have servers dressed in bikinis and chaps serving you food and drinks. The kicker though is that they only seem to work the back side of the place where there is a bar/dance floor area.  If you are looking for that you probably should ask to be seated in that part of the restaurant.  The funny part is if you're entering from the inside of the hotel that's the area you walk into...the actual restaurant looking place is located a walk down past this part which takes you to the actual front part of the place which you can also enter from the street side on the strip.  Here the servers are wearing a cute little get up with jean shorts and a black halter top shirt.  So when I actually ate at this part of the restaurant I thought it was odd they were advertising chicks walking around in bikinis serving you food when there was none actually working this part of the place.  It wasn't until I left I saw those severs working the bar/dance floor area.  Maybe they have stricter rules on attire on the front part of the establishment since it is on the Vegas strip?  Anyways on to the food review...I had the southern style fried chicken with butter whipped mash potoates, and coleslaw.  It was a good meal and a lot of food.  The hostess who I checked in with told me it was 15 minute wait but I also made a note to look down at the waiting list and literally saw one name.  She recommended I sit at the bar for no wait which is what I did.  Funny because when I panned around the room there were quite a few empty seats...I think she was just too lazy to actually look for a seat for me to be honest.  Good thing I didn't tip her.  The bartender ( a dude) was nice enough and got to me pretty quickly.  The manager also checked in with me and saw if I liked my meal which I did.  At the end I got the wrong bill but the tender caught his mistake and gave me the right one.  However, when checking my credit card info a few days later I was double billed with my bill and that wrong one.  Still waiting to see if that wrong bill actually gets charged on to my account as its pending.  Overall, the food was good, the hostess could use some work, the tender was cool except for that mistake.  If you're specifically looking for the servers wearing bikinis and chaps go to the back end of the restaurant inside the hotel.  If you want to eat at the front you'll get more of a cute country chick serving you food.",-fUARDNuXAfrOn4WLSZLgA,0,0,3,OyZ8nkl-tramncqi8fkpJg

The dance floor is a good size and the band was pretty good. There were a few people there who knew how to line dance but they weren't exactly friendly. I am not the best teacher but I was able to help a few people with some steps so they can join in on the fun. 
It would be nice if there was someone on staff that could help people try and learn. Not necessarily someone to teach but someone who people can follow. 

The DJ was really nice and very open to requests. 

The drinks were standard but I would not ask the bartender to come up with something on her own.. She just rolls her eyes and seems annoyed. Plus the drink she made was terrible and I am not the only one who though so. Maybe she was just having a bad day? The guy bartender Eric or Alex? was nice and quick with drinks though.

At $19, the cowboy burger is no bargain.  But it was big enough for two semi-hungry people to share and it was well-cooked and delicious.  The fries were great, too.

I can also strongly vouch for the kid's chicken tenders which came with a huge vat of mac and cheese.  The tenders were indeed extremely tender and they tasted terrific.  Plus, the mac and cheese might have been the best thing on the table.  Incidentally, the kid's meal was big enough to satisfy your average Vegas tourist fattie but the menu specifically states that you have to be 10 years or younger to order from the kid's menu.  That's too bad because I would have no qualms about ordering this particular meal myself.  Still, the first wife and I stole early and often from my daughter's plate.

The drinks were really weak.  I don't think it's my own personal pet peeve when I say that weak drinks suck.  Everyone hates weak drinks.

The ambiance/atmosphere of Gilley's was exactly what I expected. I haven't been to many (if any) country-western bars before, so this being my first one, it did not disappoint, appearance-wise. Saddle-seat bar stools, a mechanical bull, loud country music and several televisions playing the corresponding music videos for the songs, plus a decent-sized dance floor with a few people two-stepping. The waitresses were wearing bikinis with chaps and cowboy hats, which I guess is the 'Vegas' spin on country attire, lol. 

Anyway, we spent some time in the bar area while waiting for our table, but we didn't order anything. The food smelled great though, and we were looking forward to our meal. But, that's about as good as it got for us.

We were seated and it took a while for the waitress to come around and take our order. Then we ended up waiting a for what seemed like nearly 40 minutes for our food to arrive. The waitress stopped by and said the reason for the delay was that one of us ordered salmon, so the other 3 plates were ready, she was just waiting for the salmon to be cooked. Umm, ok. So, when our food finally came out, 3 of the dishes were only luke-warm, having been sitting out, waiting for what must've been 20 minutes. I would assume that if the kitchen knew the salmon was going to take longer to prep, wouldn't they start that dish FIRST, and the others later, so that all our orders came out together - and hot? We could've sent the 3 other dishes back, but by the time everything finally arrived, we were too hungry to bother.

As it was, we were all disappointed, not just with the service, but with the food itself. The ribs were overcooked and very dry. They looked and tasted burnt. The salmon was alright, but it's pretty hard to screw-up salmon. The mashed potatoes were good, but that wasn't enough of a plus to redeem the failure of the BBQ. I've eaten at many other BBQ places before...and this place had the worst ribs and BBQ I think I've ever had.

 Seated in a great seat overlooking part of the strip...right by window.

 I asked for a child size salad as I usually am too full from a full sized  salad to eat an entree.At all restaurants I have been to, this request is accommodated. It is not a difficult. Just choose a smaller dish.The server told me they do not make child size salads.I asked why she could not put it in a smaller dish. She just said 'sorry.'
 My chicken was so bland. It was supposed to have chipotle but there seemed to be none on it. The avocado was scooped onto one side of the burger so I got big chunks in one bite and none in the next. I finally poured hot sauce on the chicken and ate just that.
My husband left half of his burger as it was tasteless...no salt, no flavor at all.
We were in a  huge rush to make it to a show and as a result of having to wait for a table we had no time to waste waiting for a manager.
 I DID tell the server of our disappointment. She was polite and apologized but that was all.

Didn't try any food, barkeeps were fast, drinks were cheap, music is loud and I guess everyone knows the same dances in country bars?! Watching people ride the bull (projected on big screen) was amusing in a train wreck Vegas-y way.  Love the saddles on the barstools, loved the band one night, the crowd was interesting to watch and I'd go back if asked to. They offer discounted or free admission with NV ID (depends on night) and that was kinda cool; Thursday is ladies night. So, if you are into country, dressing in matching cowboy outfits with your homies and/or know the secret dances = you're golden. Probably 4* for country people, who are not me.

In those days Gilleys featured not only a mechanical bull but also bikini mud wrestling. Cold Beer and Dirty Girls was the mantra and it was a trip to remember.
 So my excitement was peaked when i found out that the place had relocated to the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino.  However my excitement was short lived ( as was my peak) when i found out that the dirty girls wrestling in the mud had been replaced with senior citizens line dancing the night away. The term ""titty alert"" which had been used at many a mud wrestling events to describe a fighters wardrobe malfunction had turned into a ""old bitty alert"". To add insult to injury , the only person riding a bull was a thirty something year old male misfit from Brokeback Mountain. So with a broken spirit i had the hostess find the wife and I a table.  She was nice enough to sit us in a spot that overlooked the Vegas Strip, nice, but still not mud wrestling.  Gilleys specializes in BBQ and has always done a good job at it.  After reviewing the menu Simone and I started with Sweet Potato Fries served with molasses ketchup and a maple marshmallow dipping sauce. For some odd reason the marshmallow sauce was a light green ( i dare not ask why). It worked well with the crispy fries and probably would have worked just as well with a peanut butter sandwich.  The molasses ketchup was also good and Simone and I finished it all. For our Entrees Simone tried the house chili. It was average and light on the spice, and reminded me more of spaghetti sauce then it did chili.  I probably could have made some at my own house for a fraction of the cost and it would have been much better and i at least would have served it with some chips. For my own entree,  I choose the Classic Pulled Pork Sandwich. It was a huge portion of pulled pork piled high on a garlic toasted bun topped with creamy coleslaw. The pork was smoked perfectly and had great flavor and moistness.  However this did cause the bun below to quickly get soggy which was disappointing because the bun was very good before it turned to mush.  The fries that the sandwich was served with were some of the best i have had in a long time. They were super thin and super crispy and may have been the highlight of the plate.  Overall this version of Gilleys left me a little dissapointed. It still serves great BBQ ( and good fries) but the other offerings were lacking in flavor. I still prefer the Dirty Girls and Cold Beer days of old. I hope that some day the mudd will return and Gilleys will once again be a little more country and a little more dirty",jyvmC6G9S0LnkJgHrW_12Q,0,0,2,OuL43rJ5hYwsm9VeQG9G0Q

We wanted to sit on the patio to eat, we are told they don't serve food out there. Great. So we sit on an enclosed patio next to a super loud couple having an intense conversation about who knows what, so obnoxiously loud neither of us could even think of something to talk about with each other. Why not seat us on the other end of the patio where there are like 15 open tables?
Then, we realized that their draft beer on ""special"" wasn't special at all. It was a 12 oz beer for $4, where the usual draft beer is 16oz for $5.50. That's not a special, that's just serving less beer for less money....
 So then we decide to get the bucket of 5 beers for $20. We are told they can only do bud light or 1 other beer in that, and I pointed to the menu where it has a total of 5 or 6 choices. The waitress stood corrected and we got another type of beer for the bucket, fine. 
We ordered food, it was fine as well. 
We finish our food, take our beers to move to the patio, and are stopped and told we can't go out there until our bill is paid. Even after another employee told us it was fine. Wtf? Just bring us our bill out there?

Located off the strip in Treasure Island, Gilley's is the place to be for those who enjoy country music. It has that cowboy saloon ambiance that I don't experience too often where I come from. 

When the girls and I came in, this bar was packed!! There was even some filming in progress of some country/western/line dancing. I'm not too knowledgable in this field, but it was definitely impressive watching the professionals perform.

So the reason why my friends wanted to take me here was so that they can see me ride on the MECHANICAL BULL. While we were hanging around the bar, it was so funny that this guy comes by and asks me if I want to ride the bull and that he would pay for it ($10). Not only that, but he buys all of us shots of Fireball to try and convince me with liquid courage. I would have done it either way, but I like being convinced with freebies! 

I've been on a mechanical bull before but the place I went to was empty, this place was packed. Not only that but some of the guys here do rodeo professionally. I can't compete with that... Well good thing for me, the crowd was cheering me on. I was reassured that I didn't have to do it well. According to this group of girls near us, it was just hotter watching a girl do it... 

1 minute and 16 seconds -- good enough. The crowd was too sweet to be cheering for me. One guy was even like, ""I've never seen that before,"" since towards the end I just grabbed on to the bull's neck to resist falling off. He hasn't seen it before probably because it's not a real rodeo move. I was just trying to hang on for my dear life. 

Despite light bruising and my left shoulder feeling some pain from falling off the mechanical bull, my friends and I had a blast. I love the positive vibes and how welcoming and supportive everyone was. Gilley's is a solid spot and I recommend checking it out even if it's out of your comfort zone.",W81-CPVrM9c6F8XiNuEUvA,24,22,4,BtOCSjYOQwZp9UtW8tRQZw

A little while after, a woman came to take our order. A normal wait time, then a food runner dropped off our food and asked if we wanted more beverages, which we did. The man never came back and was waiting on other tables, but, the woman never came back either until it was time to pay the bill. 

The food was pretty bad. We ordered a giant pretzel, which was ok, not great, but edible, and salads. The salad I had was chicken, apple, spinach, blue cheese, dried cranberries, with a tangy vinaigrette dressing. My friend ordered a chicken ceasar salad. My salad was so drenched in dressing I couldn't taste anything other than dressing. It was basically the taste of the dressing with different textures. It was just unpleasant. My friend's salad was also bad, huge globs of dressing with wilted romaine lettuce.

The worst part is that we could never have even asked for something else, complained, or anything because the waitress never returned to ask about our meal, refill or offer more drinks. She just dropped off the check and that was that.

It was our last night  in Vegas and last dinner, so my father in law picked this place because he heard it was a bbq rib place and that's what we craved. We had tickets to a comedy show later that  evening so we left 2 hours earlier so we could have dinner. We parked at Mirage hotel next door and we walked over to Treasure Island (thats where the restaurant is located) MIND YOU ON THE WAY OF PASSING MANY GOOD PLACES TO EAT ---California kitchen and the deli Joint in Mirage.. When we first got there we passed through a bar where people were taking cowboy dance lessons, there was a bar, dance floor and a bull riding area. We walked up to reception and she stated it would be a 30 minute wait meanwhile I could see in the backround empty tables. So went back to the bar area, had a bear and was listening to an annoying dance instructor, left, side step and so on so on, over and over. After 20 minutes we went back to see if they had a table and she said it might be another 35 minutes but, she stated if you sit at the bar you can be seated right away and you can eat there. Even though I don't like to eat at the bar we were pressed for time as it was already 8:05pm and the show started at nine so we dicided to take the bar area. When we get there we were greeted by Kimi the bartender/waitress, she asked if we would like something to drink and I got an ice tea and a beer for my father in law.When we were in there we noticed multiple empty tables, so my father in law tried to mentioned if we could sit at one. She stated that we would have to speak to the hostess and said ""we were confusing her""--dumb waitress syndrome.......Anyways we oredered ribs/pulled pork combo with a side of baked beans and mac and cheese...We waited another 25 minutes as it was 8:35 pm and we had 25 minutes to spare. I asked the other bartender Liz if she knew when are food was coming. So Liz went to our original waitress Kimi (literally 2 feet away from us ) and asked about our food, Kimi then stated "" it is really busy""---sarcastically. She went in the kitchen came back and stated to us ""the ticket is still on the board,there is nothing I can do, sorry"" sorry was very sarcastic. We recieved our food at 8:40 pm, when we got there an hour earlier, finally. First of all I felt rushed and the food really sucked. Let me elaborate  on that the ribs were cold and tuff, the beans were blah, the mac and cheese was horrible and the pulled pork was on a wet piece of bread (awful). I tried everything but, I couldn't eat---it was that bad. 90% of waht they served me was left on the plate. They asked me how was it, we stated it was awful...At that point we asked for the bill and they went on to speak to the manager. They spoke and came back with the bill. They only charged us for the drinks and I asked were was the food on the bill, they stated we took it off _---which was a nice gesture but, we still tpped 11.50 as the bill would have been approx $55 dollars and they only charged us 8.50 for the drinks. At that point they ""the waitress"" ignored and gossiped about us two feet away from us as if we were deaf and did not acknowlede us on the way out as we still stated thank you. Note: the manager was out socializing with one table before the incident as I observed him taking pictures and with no mind of the action as the restaurant was full by this point and he did not apologize to us, rather he went to sit right back at the same table after the waitresses spoke to him---poor mgmt skills.....Kimi should not be in customer service---probably the worst service ever and attitude galore. The manager/owner is to blame in all of this as he's running a train wreck waiting to happen...DO NOT GO TO THIS RESTAURANT ----IT SUCKS
DO NOT RECOMEND NOT TO MY WORST ENEMY--If I could give a 0 star I would as it is not deserving of even one star, poor food, poor service, poor management....With so many good places to eat in Vegas this place is on the strip and a tourist trap--It gives Vegas reputation a shot in the gut....",tvCFNvnZ9HC9y-Koa_12dw,0,1,1,1ZyCxS-y-piSLsOL_GPR-w

I went with my sister and brother-in-law to see some bull riding on a Sunday night.  I think they have bikini bull riding on Sunday nights and Thursday nights.

When they say any female can join the bull riding contest to win $200, they mean ANY...  When we went there were these two older ladies, a nasty Asian girl, and a woman who was just married.

As they were riding the bull, slowly, they were told to be sexy, but they weren't.  I think they were TRYING to be, but they weren't even.  All I can see is cellulite moving around.

There were a lot of old former biker dudes that were into it, I guess, but for me, it was pretty bad. I would give the experience one star, but since I was very entertained at seeing these women TRY to be sexy and fail, I gave it 2 stars.  I was entertained - but for a different reason than the old biker dudes were entertained.  I was entertained by their failure to be sexy.

There were both men and women in there watching and most people were just laughing or talking smack about the bull rider.

Expect to see a lot of Ed Hardy shirts though.

Cant go into real details for you since I had plenty of $1 drinks and really didn't care what I ate, just know I needed to.  The Treasure Island show is right outside however you cannot see anything from here and they even block off the exit that goes out that way during the shows.

We ordered the Sweet Tea to start and boy, it was nasty tasting stuff, so I wasn't expecting too much for the meal.

But, I had the Green Chili and it was really very good and so too was the Mac & Cheese that I had along with the Chili.

Mrs. G enjoyed the Fried Chicken.  It was crisp, moist, and quite tasty.  Her two sides were the good Mac & Cheese and the let's just say not so good Baked Beans.

We had a great seat right on the Strip and the service was friendly and decent.

We went to the Bikini Bull Riding contest they have on Sundays, and even though most of the girls seemed like legit volunteers, I know at least one of them worked there.  She's blonde, and they pulled her out of the crowd and she said it was her 21st birthday and that she hadn't ridden a mechanical bull in a very long time.  She then proceeded to strip down and ride the bull like a pro.  She hasn't ridden it in a very long time?  I saw her there the night previous to that riding it and then doing some well-choreographed line dancing.  This girl clearly works at Gilley's in some capacity.

It's conveniently located in the heart of the Strip and typically doesn't have a cover till after 10pm. Gilley's has a restaurant where I've eaten one time several years ago. It's BBQ which is pretty standard for a country bar and the food is good for the price. I had the country fried steak for $17 which came with 2 sides and corn bread. 
My favorite part about Gilley's isn't the food though... it's the bar. Typically before 10pm there is no cover, and after 10pm the cover is $10 which is pretty cheap by Vegas standards. Get geared up in your cowboy and cowgirl attire and walk on in as there's usually no line. The first thing you'll notice as you walk into the bar is the huge dance floor. Whether you're into swing dancing, 2 step or line dancing, you'll get your fix. The music is almost always country (though some line dance songs aren't country) and sometimes they have excellent musicians that'll play anything you request. If you look past the dance floor, you can't miss the mechanical bull. It's not a rare thing to see girls in bikinis climb on up and go for their 8 second ride. There are contests Thursday's for the guys and Sunday's for the ladies (in bikinis). I believe the payout depends on the amount of contestants and the rides usually cost $10. The actual bar in this place is very long and there's never too much of a wait to order a drink. The one issue you'll find is there may be standing room only if you're looking for a table. The waitresses are showing off their bodies in bikinis and chaps and aren't afraid to hit the dance floor to dance with customers. 
Gilley's is a great place to go if you're looking for a bit of country in the heart of the Strip at reasonable prices and great music.",OqPgIdARuBZdUjwG4WYcQA,1,0,5,bieDbKu7G5p-V9W8upnxjQ

The only good part about this meal was that I had a beer outside on the first non-oppressive night of the Vegas summer. The bad part is that I chose Gilley's.

Maybe my palate is becoming too sophisticated for this shit, and I really don't want to be that guy. I literally couldn't eat my meal. We started with nachos - it's been months since I've had good nachos. These were covered in black olives, chili, salsa.... nacho cheese sauce. Like - movie theater nacho cheese sauce. It was never my favorite, and it really didn't seem to go right for me with the chili. My parents polished off that plate, though, so what do I know? I asked for a side of guacamole, but it never came. I think that was for the better, though, since I got guacamole on my burger.

So, I get another beer, because god knows I need it to get through the entree. My burger - in theory - sounded good. Guacamole, jack daniels BBQ sauce, a tasty burger, onion strips... bar food, you know?

Guacamole. Man, I should have known better. Guacamole is tough sometimes... if you fuck it up, you really fuck it up. Gilley's - come on. Take it off your menu. It tasted like old cheese mixed with armpit. I ended up not eating my burger and just polishing off the fries (which were good).

Final verdict? I'm literally still shitting, and this review has taken me like 12 minutes to write. Not like - just sitting here writing, but sitting here and actively releasing. I'll never eat at Gilley's again. The only way someone could drag me here would be to stare at the waitresses asses and ride the bull at 3AM.",-k5yFUChotBMGQgHdFZvLQ,4,5,1,JMWkC2qTrisNxX90dzZUoA

It's a pretty big place with an open kitchen, large dance floor, stage, mechanical bull, bar with tables, and both indoor and outdoor seating. We arrived around 10:30 on Sunday night and found one ""stool"" at the bar. That's in quotes because the seats are actually saddles - love it! Shortly after, we scored a table right by the dance floor and center stage. Nice! 

We only ordered drinks since we had already eaten, but the food I saw looked good. The drinks were good - not necessarily strong, but not totally weak either. There was a band playing and singing country music (my favorite!), and people dancing. When the bullriding started, we didn't have the closest seat but a drop-down screen replaced the band on the stage, which gave us a pretty good view. The riders were just customers that had signed up or been coerced - not professionals or the staff (like we initially thought). The girls stripped to their bras/panties and rode the bull. The true winner was robbed as she was the only one who lasted without falling, but the audience chose the other girl (who fell off) instead.

The bar area is self-serve, which isn't my favorite, but the bartender made it good. He remembered our drinks and the name on the card each time, even though he was busy. He was very friendly and also gave us a round of drinks to go in plastic cups when we were cashing out. Why can't more places be like Vegas!?

One of my party slipped on a puddle of liquid that was already on the floor outside of the kitchen as she walked back to our table from the restroom. nobody helped her up, employees saw but didn't come to her aid, somebody came out with a mop and mopped it up quickly. 

Soon after that a guy came up to our table and asked what happened? We told him she slipped on water but was okay and she said wanted to be left alone (she was very embarrassed). He asked her where the water was, and he didn't say it as if he cared, but said it like, there's no water there. I told him it was cleaned up and it was right there (near the kitchen door). He went away. Next up was another guy. He came out with a clipboard to another of my friends at the table and said ""I heard you fell, what happened?"". We told him it wasn't this person, it was Another at the other end of the table. Now by this time, My friend is completely embarrassed. She has said she just wanted to be left alone. New guy goes up to her and asked her to describe what happened. She said she slipped on liquid and fell but that she was fine. He started asking, well where is the water? She explained it was cleaned up already. He jokingly said, are you sure it wasn't that French fry (pointing at some food on the floor)? Come on, she is humiliated and now you're joking around, possibly implying again she fell on purpose?! Then he decided to ask if she needed an ambulance. She told him again she was fine and wanted to be left alone. He took down her information and after making us all uncomfortable, he walked away.

The waitress, who didn't care whatsoever about what happened and never even said she was sorry, took about 45 minutes to bring us our bill. They didn't even discount her plate for her fall, which would have at least been classy. Nobody apologized, they just made sure that she was not going to call the police or sue.

The restaurant is pretty family friendly and the staff is nice too. Our server was always on top of everything and took really good care of us.

As far as the food goes, I wasn't mind blown but it was enjoyable. Between the two of us, we shared a Cowgirl combo where you can choose from 3 meats and 2 sides. The baby back ribs were delicious and so were the hot links. The half chicken seemed like it was reheated and a bit dry but still edible. My husband ordered the green chile chili but it was not good, and more soupy  than chili. On the other hand, the sweet potato fries were nice and crispy. What I loved most is that it came with two dipping sauces. One was like a ketchup and the other was like roasted/melted marshmallows with a hint of cinnamon? It was delicious and great for sharing!

Overall a good time. My only complaint was that the food took quite a bit to arrive and we were sat near the kitchen where you could heat a loud ringing sound once in a while (the beeping of a broiler when it's ready?

The bar seems so out of place in the Treasure Island, with the loud country music, line dancing, and bull riding. Overall the atmosphere is cool, and they had someone teaching some line dancing routine's which we thoroughly enjoyed.

We sat down at the small area in the back (which only has maybe 10 tables) and yet were ignored for the first 10 minutes until we walked up to the bar and asked for a waitress. I asked if they were doing happy hour (knowing that at some point in the night they were doing $1 drinks), the waitress said yes and we ordered 3 cocktails. To my surprise she came with 4 drinks -- apparently we ordered at 6:50 instead of 7 so they were BOGO -- at $7.50! We could have certainly waited 10 minutes had I known that was the case. 

We all ordered the vegetarian chili -- which was OK. I hadn't eaten anything all day, so I couldn't complain. We also ordered the sweet potato fries, which to my surprise came with a cinnamon frosting dipping sauce (sounds weird, I know, but it was actually very good!)

After we ate we closed the check, but continued to order drinks at the bar. Again, customer service was very meh. When I went to order drinks, I was told I could only order one because ""one drink special for one person"".

The food is typical sports bar fare: burgers, sandwiches, wings, nachos, etc. Highly salty and very average. It's not bad, but it's certainly neither creative or gourmet.

Being a bar, and being in Vegas, I was hoping for some decent selection of beer. Nope. They carry the big breweries only. No drink specials either.

I don't know off-hand what the ""winner"" gets paid, but let's just say self-respect is going for pennies on the dollar.

This isn't to say you won't be entertained, especially if your daily vocabulary includes words like, ""trainwreck"" and ""shitshow"" or if you find it impossible not to stare when your visit to Baskin Robbins happens to coincide with a special ed group outing.  Rather, this is to set the expectation that you won't see shapely bikini models flashing their lady bits as they gyrate their way into your spank bank.  Instead, prepare to watch corn-fed big'uns getting tossed around like sacks of potatoes.  If that's your thing, welcome to hog heaven.

4282299,2016-09-06,0,G5or_Fra4-6IYOVlm_dI2Q,"This place in Treasure Island is so fun! I stop by to dance and to eat! Locals night Monday and Friday's are my favorite. DJ Shaddix is so nice and will play all the line dances that you want. Trent is an awesome bartender and I just need to look at him to get my usual drink!

Line dancing tips:
Wear Boots or something that will slide on the floor. I see so many people try in flip flops or heels and they look like they are going to break an ankle. Ouch!
2-step is really fun if you have a good leader. On locals night there are a lot of good dancers. So just ask and you can generally get a Yes. 
Some more advanced dancers will add a bit of flare, but the general steps are more basic. Try to follow along or ask someone in between songs to show you off the dance floor or off to the side. Most people are very nice about that. 
Gilley's does offer lessons at 7 or 8pm most days I can't remember which.

On Mondays a few tips. $1 drinks for locals till 10pm. A lot of locals will be there and they are REALLY good dancers. The locals get annoyed with some of the drunk tourists, but at the same time the drunks will get mad at the locals. They claim they need to practice in order to know what they are doing. The locals dance a few nights a week and definitely get their practice in. I agree that the locals on Monday's should be a bit more inclusive of people just trying to learn. I know that I help when I can. I suggest that you try and control your liquor and practice respectfully and don't bump into people. ha ha. Drunk dancing starts about 11pm if that is what you are really into. Or there is a Senor frogs down the way that offers that all night. 

On Fridays a few tips. Bull ride watching on Friday's are my favorite because there tends to be a bachelor or a bachelorette party and they put the person who is the most intoxicated up there. It is $10 to ride the bull. I will not be getting up there. Toughest Man-Bull riding competitions that they do every so often are fun to watch. They also do bikini bull riding on Sunday's if they get enough girls.

The food is also really good. My favorite is the pulled pork sliders. 

A few things that would make it that much more spectacular:
Better drink specials on Friday's. For a local, it can get pricey on Friday's.
I wish you could have food in the bar area after 9pm or at least appetizers.",834vg5H4ZeNnnwEfUrpJzA,1,2,5,77ksalcYknZYNx-hEn9f7A
4284323,2012-07-28,0,G5or_Fra4-6IYOVlm_dI2Q,"We were in Vegas from july 22 until 26 and we ate here one the 23rd. My husband and I decided to eat here. Our first choice was Senor Frogs but the wait there was a 20-30 or 30-45 if you wanted to sit outside. Even though the atmosphere at Senor Frogs looked like fun (there was a live show of sorts), we had build up a hunger from shopping all day long and decided to take our chances on Gilley's. We were seated immediately near the window. We had a great view from the strip there and if we turned around we were able to catch the pirate show. 
Our waitress, Catalina was a very nice girl and when we decided on appetizers she even gave us the advice not to start with the nachos grande plate because it was huge and it will spoil our dinner. So we started with the chicken strips.They were good, crunchy and a bit spicy. We had two dips of choice, one was barbeque and another was ranch. My husband and I usually enjoy the ranch sauce, but this one we kept doubting over. Do we like it or not? We decided that it had weird tangy taste, as if they used a lot of lemon in it. So we emptied the barbeque sauce. 
For dinner my husband had the baby pork ribs, with a side of corn and fries. I had the steak with the side of corn and fries. The steak was a bit luke-warm when it arrived and I am a very slow eater, so that turned my steak to become a bit cold. It wasn't a big deal for me, the steak still tasted good, but I would prefer a very hot steak the next time. My steak was sometimes a bit too burned, which caused me to scrape some of the burned bits off. 
For my husband the baby pork ribs slided right of the bone and I could see that he was really enjoying his food. For the side the fries were good, crispy and small very nice. We got two pieces of corn, but the corn was too buttery.
We both enjoy our corn un buttered and it had us cleaning off butter from our corn. 
Other than that, we were treated really well, our waitress, Catalina was a very nice woman. 
The view is nice and fun as well if you catch it around the pirate show. We saw the other ship coming in and battling with the other one. Lots of fun, imagine if you would catch a seat on the patio!",kiaR9ftoNBpIYf-VSw3kbQ,1,0,4,VMatud16CyXtnqn7UPnxwA

On my way to be seated, I see a bar, where I could have been seated but wasn't. I got the 4 top.  ?? While waiting I drank at the bar and dance club part. Half the place was roped off, so it appeared to be packed, but because most of the space was dance floor and no one would venture there,  and half the bar space was blocked off... It appeared to be very busy. Bartender would take my empty beer bit not offer to refill. 
The line dance lesson was 10 minutes. 1 dance instruction and the run through. 
 Let me move onto the food and service. I told my waitress, ""Alex"", my drink order 3 times before she got that right. She gave me directions to the men's room, and then the food... to her credit, she did tell me to order the pulled pork. But I didn't want bbq pork. I wanted to taste my meat. So I order brisket. It is nearly inedible. There are chunks of fat on it. The French fries have no flavor or seasoning, seriously. Not 1 drop of anything. So if you like that, have at it. I could make the same at home with frozen fries and an oven. The bread was a poor choice for the bread since it took a fork and knife to pick up and after 1 bite, the bread fell apart.

I ordered the fried catfish. The portion was HUGE, but the fish was not fresh at all. They were basically pieces of catfish dipped in batter and then fried. The first piece I had I couldn't eat. They left on the dark meat and if the chef knew what he was doing, he'd know that that's where the blood is concentrated in the fish, making it taste fishy. I ditched that piece and ate one with only white meat, and it was obvious that the cat fish was not fresh. It tasted like it was frozen or has been sitting out for too long. They also overcooked their corn on the cob, which is something that annoys the daylights out of me when it comes to most American restaurants. 

My boyfriend had brisket, which he didn't seem to be too happy about. I tried a piece and it was a little dry and hard, not moist, melt-in -your-mouth, fall-off-the-bone like a proper bbq should be. 

However, I will give them props on their hush puppies, which were delightfully flavorful. I also enjoyed the green bean casserole, but I could've easily made that at home...

The hostess then spoke up and explained that a few waitresses were on break and that she couldn't seat anyone in those areas until they returned. We decided to wait it out 

The hostess was accurate in her estimation..it was just about 20 minutes before we were taken to our table. This is another restaurant in Vegas that offers street side seating. I love to people watch so this was perfect to me. I ordered the blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich and a salad. Oh my...was I pleasantly surprised! One of the best sandwiches I had ever eaten. It was sooooo good! My husband tried it and agreed which is surprising because it wasn't fried. He is a fried fish guy all of the way! He had even said that he wished he had ordered it. 

The salad was made with an assortment of dark, healthy, fresh, greens and a homemade vingearette. It was delicious. The meal was around $20...a bit high...but it was a great meal...great scenery, no regrets. I'll also mention that the waitress was great!

Cons: The restaurant side, however, prevents you from seeing all this cool action unfortunately. The food is very average. The buns were too spongy and the meat was too loose. The waitress also took forever with my check. Avoid the blueberry lemonade cocktail... Too watered down and not tasty.

Me and my girlfriend were not down to be a line dancing and doing the honky-tonk dance or anything like that-all we wanted were drinks and shots. 
We had a very rude bartender that was going out of their way to not give us drinks and it was very noticeable I think it was because we weren't dressed up like hillbillies
By the way if you're not dressed up like a hillbilly you're going to get very badly treated so make sure you show up looking like a dirt bag

This is the best part security came up to us and told us that we weren't allowed to be in a certain spot that we were standing in
We were all by ourselves.

Maybe it was the lover of country music in me, the fact I've walked past it's adorably-themed exterior, many times on the strip, or because the words meat and BBQ, ring louder than other food words. Yet, the 3-stars, should have made this Elitist, think again. 
We walked in on an early Saturday night, and was pleased it was just a 10 minute wait. We were told to head to the bar, for a drink if we wanted, while we waited. 
The bar area is pretty cool, with actual saddles for sitting on, tables, a mechancial bull, restrooms, and a large dance floor. We ""saddled"" up to the bar and watched as a busboy and at least 2 bartenders paced back and forth, with no one even greeting us, despite them being slow! No joke, it took over 5 minutes before someone DID take our drink order, and once we received the beer and Cape Cod, the buzzer went off, to be sat for dinner. We headed to our table.
Now, during a meal rush, I don't expect everything to be immaculate, but it was a turn off to literally sit down with a straw wrapper, sugar packet and other table debris, right near/under my feet. I just kicked the crap aside and shook my head. It take 5 seconds with a pooper-scooper, people. Show some pride, in your establishment. 
Our server was ""pleasant,"" but not a happy lass and definitely wanting to get-through the end of her shift. She did point us out to ordering the combo with 2 sides, and splitting it, since we weren't that hungry. My boyfriend and I picked the Tri Tip, Brisket of beef, Creamed Corn, and Green Beans. The green beans were good, the creamed corn was delicious, but packed a kick (if you aren't into spicy dishes), and the meats okay. Despite them being marinated previously, they did need more and I like how there were several sauce bottles to choose from. That always grosses me out though, as I imagine people coughing, sneezing, licking their fingers and then touching the communal, plastic, sauce bottles. The jalapeno cornbread was too dry and flaky. Kinda awkward to eat and continue pinching at, after dissolving from its cupcake liner. It needed a butter and/or honey packet with it. So simple, not to expensive, but would have helped it go down. 
For the price, I likely wouldn't dine there again, but would visit the nightclub part.",H6wRKRGN7k13GgFvE_-P3A,2,0,3,LMQdbTGq06qJ173n_UTWTw

He gave me the look of death and said he was taking care of the bar and had to wait my turn. He wasn't going in any specific direction so I thought I'd just ask him nicely to get it to me when he had a chance. He was super rude. I eventually got my beer even before the group of guys that were next to me and which had been there before me.

Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of BBQ and was very excited to try Gilley's for the first time. I was disappointed from the minute I opened the menu. I must have flipped through it front to back and back to front three or four times because I felt like I was just overlooking a section that listed brisket. Sadly I wasn't overlooking anything. Gilley's does not have any type of brisket whatsoever; not even so much as a chopped brisket sandwich. How can a place with a huge neon outline of Texas on the wall with it's original roots in Houston, TX serve not serve brisket? I know there are a lot of other types of BBQ out there and I am sure I am biased because of the fact the I was born and raised in the Lone Star state, but I have a hard time accepting a BBQ place that doesn't have brisket as at least one of it's offerings. Aside from the disappointment of not having brisket, the food I did have was definitely not anything special. We started off with the ""Texas"" nachos, they must have felt the need to get the word TX in there, but they were just nachos and we're a sad version of them at that. I can't take your nachos seriously when the melted cheese is a liquid you poured out of a can. The BBQ ribs, side of mashed potatoes and corn bread we're decent at the very best. I may visit the bar again at some point, but will definitely be eating elsewhere.",noYFSPIOkxs0luJbtIlyJA,1,1,2,_Ed1dIhS2cCbYhPVU6Pcig

The bartender did not serve up service with a smile.  He asked us what we wanted to drink.  When I asked him what the specials were he responded and I didn't hear the second thing he said so I asked him to repeat.  He seemed truly annoyed and put out by this.  I guess when you mix overpriced drinks with drunk tourists you don't really have to smile to get tips?  

The happy hour deals weren't that great - 3 dollar drafts or an extra shot in your well drink, which was regularly priced.  There's a big dance floor, stage for live music, and a mechanical bull.

They have a happy hour menu until 10pm and select cocktails are $7. I ordered a midori sour and it wasn't bad.

I was pretty full from lunch still so I had a side of mac & cheese it was only $4.99. My sister and her friend ordered the sweet potato fries and it comes with a sweet marshmallow type of dip that was really delicious! I highly recommend ordering it!

The drinks are definitely Strip price. The cocktail waitresses, clad in bikinis and chaps, make their way around the floor rather often.

Don't get me wrong, you can't ask for a better country bar to break in a newby into the scene, but BBq was just not up to power.  

I got to sample the rack of ribs, the famous brisket sandwich, and the country fried chicken.  All of course accompanied with a symphony of sides; home style mac' and cheese, biscuits, gravy, cornbread, smashed potatoes, and cole slaw.  Everything looked appetizing but tasting it was sadly a whole different story.

Ribs that were promised to be falling of the bone were tough.  The brisket sandwich that promised to be famous was infamous for lacking deliciousness, and the country fried chicken.... well that was actually the only thing I took to.  

However, there was an upside.  Wait staff was wonderful.  They really know how to give you that warm country welcome.  Drinks didn't cost a pretty penny and it was nice to know that it's okay to have a plastic bucket of beer on your table while you dine the night away.

Loved the food, a lot more than my husband and I could eat and the waitresses really took care of you even when you were just ordering drinks.  We sat out in the bar part by the mechanical bull and had great sevice even during the busy times.  

Every night they have a special theme, we really enjoyed World Famous Bikini Bull Riding.  There was a DJ and 5 girls rode the bowl and they had promotions where you could get free stuff from their sponsors.  I had a lot of fun both because of what I was drinking and the entertainment.  They have line dancing classes at certain times, you can ride the mechanical bull or just watch others partake in it.  If you want to have a seat you need to get their a little earlier than it starts or if you don't mind standing don't worry about the timing, either way you will enjoy yourselves at Gilley's.  

The waitresses are all dressed cute and they get on the dance floor at times and are very good at the line dances.  They are willing to take pictures with the customers and it makes for a great memory of your trip.  You are encouraged to wear your western wear while you are there, but not required.

Pros:

If you go early-ish (before 7:30/8) it is fairly easy to get a table, especially earlier in the week. Waitresses are also fairly attentive, again, the earlier in the week the better.

No cover! I hate hate hate paying covers. They also have pretty good drink specials

I have never been on the floor when it was too crowded to dance. Have certainly come across your typical drunk chick doesn't know what she is doing type dancers, but overall there is room to get away from those people and not be squished against the person next to you.

If you get a table next to the bull, you not only have easy access to the dance floor, but great people (on bull) watching as the night progresses.

Dance lessons M-F at 7pm. 

Music is a reasonable, can carry on a conversation at your table, volume

Cons:

Can be loaded with tourists, which can make you feel like an animal being watched in a zoo while dancing...maybe that is just an issue for me though

Everyone (tourists, regulars, waitresses, etc.) will walk straight across the dance floor, which is generally know to be fairly bad etiquette. When the floor is empty, it isn't the biggest deal but I have turned during a dance and nearly taken out a bus boy walking right through a line of dancers. 

Floor is so-so, fairly sticky as far as dance floors go.


Overall, I like Gilley's. The older I get, the more I appreciate the more laid back, not as loud, not charging you for everything under the sun, not being slammed into by barely conscious club girls vibe that is getting more and more difficult to find out here.

It's located right in front of Treasure Island, It's entrance gets blocked every hour due to the Pirate show right in front of the hotel as spectators block it's doors.

Ordered the combo platter which includes pulled pork and ribs with corn on the cob, corn muffin and fries.  We arrived just when they opened at around 11am but surprisingly, the food tasted old, like it's been sitting there for awhile.  The fries were cold and didn't have the reliable crunch factor we were yearning for.  I wonder if they just took the leftovers from the Buffet tables.  The only thing decent was the pulled pork.  The entree costs a whopping $26!  Definitely not worth the money or the calories.  

Also, the service here sucks!  Older Male Bartender is really snippy, Oscar the grouch and a true @sswipe.

We did have to wait a couple minutes which was no big deal. Once sat, a gentleman who we thought might be our waiter asked ""do you want drinks"" well sure, 3 waters. We needed some after drinking all day. 

Few minutes went by and we see the guy walking around but no waters, weird. Finally he arrives with the water and says ""waitress will be with us"".... okay, starving now, I start trying the BBQ sauces to keep myself busy from the minutes of passing by( we had just had bad service at the Wynn and left after 20 minutes of no service) lol pretty good so if you are waiting just start dabbling with those.

Our waitress is now here and taking our order and everything after that is really great. 
Huge pretzel was amazing, burger was perfectly cooked to medium and a nice toasted bun like we had asked. My sister also got the house salad which was very big and had great flavors especially with the field greens. Check out was a breeze too.
I thought the prices were high but after seeing and tasting what we got, not disappointed.

The pulled pork sandwich came out with a great smoked flavor that wasn't overpowering and not drenched in sauce so you had a choice of which sauce you wanted at the table. Loved the coleslaw on the sandwich for that nice acidic crunch that elevates the sandwich flavor profile.  The sandwich was big enough for 2 people to share as the portion of meat was very generous. 
My husband ordered the wings and said they had a nice crispness to the outside  and the  sauce was good. He has never had a wing appetizer with this many wings on it before, so once again the portions were plenty.  
We were thinking of getting the nachos, but when we saw them come to the table next to us we changed our minds.  The portion was way too big.  At the end of lunch we were glad we didn't order them because the 3 big burly guys that did couldn't even finish them.
We were greeted by the manager when we walked in and he seated us at our table.  Oscar was there immediately to get our drink order and Isabella our waitress was a delight.  Made sure to ask the chef if there were bell peppers in the chili my husband originally wanted.   She told him she didn't think so, but would check anyway.  Thank goodness she did because the chef said he blends them.  Which means you can't see it, but it's there.  Saved us a trip to the ER for food allergy.

5847200,2011-03-10,3,G5or_Fra4-6IYOVlm_dI2Q,"Why didn't i read Yelp before i went here??? Lesson learned. I'm from Texas and shouldve known better, but I used poor judgment and came here with my wife anyways. Ive eaten pounds of BarBQue at all kinds of Texas BBQ joints and i failed to heed Rule #1: 

Don't patronize any BBQ place if you cannot locate the smoker. This place has none and their sucky BBQ and the rest of their food should be avoided at all costs. 

I thought because this was Vegas, maybe they carefully disguised their smoke pit as a fake rock or they rigged it to come out one of those pirate ships at T.I. Alas, no. 

I ordered the chicken fried steak. It was clearly a frozen rectangle patty and tasted like the kind you would find near a convenience store microwave. In fact, i thought i saw a cook run out the back and cross the street to the AM/PM and then run back. 

I don't remember what my wife had. I do remember her saying it sucked and was overpriced. The waitress was always in a hurry and literally threw our plates of food on our table as she zipped by to attend to other customers. I felt like hitting her in the head with my frozen patty. 

Much like the song of the sirens next door and the T.I. pirate show, the menu lures you in with dreams of gastronomical delights. And just like the show next door, your meal ends with a ship battle going on in your stomach because of the poor food quality. 

P.S. Gilleys: I wouldn't tout the fact that your menu claims your sausage is imported from Elgin. You re making it sound as if Elgin is this magical, mystical far away place. Its like saying your Budweiser is imported from St. Louis. So what? the rest of your food is imported from the generic food aisle of the grocer's freezer.

There was an awesome band (Chauncey Williams and the Younger Brother Band if my Googling is correct) and they had the place swinging. The mechanical bull provided endless horrifying entertainment as girls in skirts shoved their asses in the air. 

The bar was crowded and understaffed, leading to a bit of a wait for a drink. One bartender in particular (didn't get her name unfortunately) was a goddamn champ.

I'm sure its hard for restaurants to keep flysout but that doesn't mean it isn't gross. And it doesn't mean that swatting a fly for my entire 45min dinner was any less annoying. 
The service was alright, the server we had was nice but definitely too used to have food runners and bussers. A huge pet peeve of mine is sitting at a table for a prolonged period of time with dirty plates ( napkins on plates to signify being finished) while the waitress walks by, asks if we need anything thing else and brings and closes our check. The dirty plates where still there when we got up to leave 10 minuets after we received out check from out waitress. 

Now, I have been a server for 3 years, so I can understand a bad night, being busy, etc. The real disappointment wasn't the service, it was the food. I just wanted some tasty BBQ. That is not at all what I got. First of all, we ordered the nachos, which were picture in the menu and showed up completely different. They were pictured as being laid out on a plate...they came piled a half a foot high and smothered with all kinds of crappy looking toppings. 

So that happened, we ate what chips we could find that weren't soggy yet and put some toppings on them ourselves. Then our entrees arrived. I got the half of a rotisserie chicken with the mac and cheese and green bean casserole. The chicken tasted OK, but it was cold. The mac and cheese was cold, oily and disgusting...I had no idea you could mess that dish up! The green bean casserole was also cold and gel-like. : / ....My boyfriend got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes and mac and cheese. His food was super hot(which tells me that mine was sitting in the food window as his chicken was fried) but his sides were crappy too. His chicken was hard as a rock. Needless to say it was gross. 

Usually we say something when things go this wrong, but we were late for a show and we dont like to receive free food so we left and vowed never to return.",5HmaNREIlTjGPf2pCAKUwA,0,0,1,fvVyyHg5ntW7xn3DK_J0ug
