Price is definitely affordable, and the food choices are the BEST. I've never seen so much side dishes in a korean restaurant. The first time we've been, we were full because of the side dishes so choose wisely!

The only thing that troubled me was the fact that the soup choices (tofu soup and steamed egg) options were only limited to 2 per table. Usually, those who want their own soups can receive them with any issues.",UkuJKl-ahupSB-tN2WOC1g,0,0,4,Dcx7HR_kXX8CMrZ7--VEmw

Arirang's customer service is five thumbs down. First time i've encounter rude waitresses. We started ordering and the waitress said ""5 orders only at a time you might not finish the food"". . We didn't say anything we just look at each other just say ""ok that's just for now"". What a stupid service. This is AYCE!!!  I ordered plate of shrimps (4piece) after that I ordered another shrimps this time I said two plates. I'm expecting I will get 8 pcs shrimps but no the waiter brought 1 plate with 6 shrimps. This is lunch hour. All meat are sliced  so thin. Lastly, our pitcher of water never got refilled. I think they only cater and nice to people of their own. I also suggest better go to Tofu Hut.

Decent quality meat and great side dishes with good music too. But I found the food, in general, getting less tasty; rather feels like they cut down the quality a lot from their food overall..  

this week I had the worst service experience ever by one of their servers who charged me more than 18% tip after the tax for 3 adults and one 3-year-old without even asking me ahead. Though I agreed he might travel a lot back and forth so I paid whatever he charged me, but when I asked for his explanation (because I never ever had this kind of absurd pre-charged tip experience in my 14 year US life) he says it's a Vegas rule and applies to any BBQ house, which made me leave this review. He never apologized or said sorry. 

I don't think he provided an exceptional service, rather he was just busy as he took care of 6+ different tables at once. Not sure if he'd do the same thing to every customer, but I definitely felt kinds of unfair service against Korean customers by that Korean guy.",-pBei_oIhtZ1qZ6IY-FiMw,0,0,2,SQv7NOL30PR-ECrtVJIYgg

This restaurant is chill, friendly, and clean (yes, I said clean and it's Asian. Lol).  We had about 10 items and we could barely move when finished, steak, chicken, pork proteins. Spicing was excellent and the service was five star. Our waiters even cooked for us!

First, we were welcomed and sat promptly, and since the menu is somewhat fixed -you're getting the barbecue - they immediately brought out the side dishes and got us going with the order.  The sides are absolutely delicious -the bean sprouts, the pickled beets, all of them are fresh, pleasingly cool, and wonderfully tasty.  The appetizers (we got egg rolls, several chicken dishes, and a pork dish) were also excellent, if a bit over-whelmed by the rest of the meal.  You select a number of meats which they bring to you and then you grill away.  They will continue to bring you more meat and side dishes until you concede, but it's tempting to keep going.

Noticed only 1-waiter working.  We ordered about 4-meats and a couple of sides for this 1st round.  Our sides came out, along with a plate of pork belly.  

We then noticed a woman helping out, bringing trays of meat out to the other tables, which by now a few more tables were occupied.  Every time she came by with a tray it went to other tables who came after us.  Note at this time we only have been brought out a plate of pork belly and it has been 15-minutes that had gone by.  The waiter kept passing by our table.  He saw that we only had the pork belly, but yet did nothing to bring us the rest of our food.

We flagged the woman down and asked where the rest of our order was.  She seemed clueless.  Beef belly and brisket that she brought to us were literally scraps and leftovers, lots of frozen ""meat dust"" on the plate.

It was not a very pleasant experience to say the least.  They do not check on your table unless you come in a big group, which we were only 2-people.  Meats were pretty sub par.  We will stick with Sura BBQ.",ZvNDnyc0uTSeelyWXSN-OA,0,0,2,MH-fDk3FWxyHII4i8bVRJg

We wanted to try so many things, we opted for Dinner C - lots of choices, so there was something for everyone.  My favorites were the pork belly and beef jowl - cooked perfectly!  Try the sesame dipping sauce (just a bit though - it's quite salty). So addicting!

Another must try dish is the steamed egg.  Bubbly and delicate, wait a moment, take some video, and enjoy. Incredibly light and fluffy.

1847216,2017-04-27,2,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,I found a diamond in the rough when I stumbled upon this awesome restaurant!  This is hands down my favorite Korean BBQ spot in Las Vegas.  When you walk in the decor and atmosphere is similiar to most Korean BBQ places with the booths equipped with grillers and the Korean pop videos/music playing through the speakers....BUT what separates this joint from the rest is their attention to the customer experience.  Their food is fresh and amazing but the staff are the real stars.  They have great suggestions and even help you cook the meat to perfection!  If you have NEVER been to a Korean BBQ restaurant or you are a seasoned foodie that frequents Korean BBQ spots...you will have an authentic experience and walk out knowing EXACTLY what you like and how to be creative with your entrees.

The family and I came here after getting out of a late class at UNLV on a Friday night. Instead of venturing out to one of our usual spots on Spring Mountain we decided to come here due to the proximity to school and the yelp ratings. The place was fairly empty, only about 3 other parties on a Friday night around 9pm. There was no fish cakes which is my favorite side to snack on during KBBQ. We did the 20 dollar option which came with quite the variety of meat. I loved seeing that they had beef belly and beef tongue which we got for our first round. We also ordered spicy pork belly, regular pork belly, brisket, and shrimp. In my honest opinion, the quality of meat is just not there. The only thing I was impressed with was how thick their cuts of pork belly are. The gyoza was amazing though, we reordered this 3 times! Service is mediocre, I expected a little more from them considering the fact that it was not busy at all. They are not too generous with brisket sauce. Every time I asked for extra I'd get it at like 1 tablespoon a time. We had to order some things twice and ask for water twice. The facility itself is very sticky.

The staff was all quite friendly, the bulgogi, chadol baegi, and all of the banchan were just right, and a regular A+B order was very filling and satisfying without the ""stuff yourself until you aren't even enjoying it anymore"" aspect of AYCE hanging over my head.

Some places try too hard to be absolutely perfect in one area and forget others. Arirang doesn't try to revolutionize Korean BBQ, they just do every single part of it well and that's worth something.",m2a1WvdBx9tCohxvhPaTyQ,0,0,5,-Z2b9oSECpGcnKH3K_302w
2170418,2017-05-01,1,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"READ FURTHER AS TO WHY I GAVE THIS RESTAURANT A 1 STAR

First of all, the food was great and I've been to multiple kbbq in Las Vegas. Servers were very fast and nice. They bring the orders fast, ask how the food is and also help cook the food (*often* which might be annoying to some customers). Overall, I had a good dinner experience with the servers as well as the food although they overdo helping in cooking. 

Why 1 star?
We had a great eating experience at this new kbbq place but after we paid using credit card and tipping with cash which was left on the table next to the check book, the cashier girl (wearing red shirt) who's at the front counter who gets the bill/check chased us with the check book as we walked out the door asking if we left any tip. Like are you seriously asking that?

Problem #1: You never ask that to customers. That question is offensive and insulting to a customer especially if they did leave a tip. 
Problem #2: We DID leave a tip in cash next to the check book which is why there was no tip value in the credit card receipt. 
Problem #3: CHECK the table first! Not everyone tips on the credit card receipt and prefers tipping in cash. 
Problem #4: Tipping in general is NOT required. It's just courtesy and customers have the choice if they want to tip or not. 

The only problem with this restaurant is that girl working front cashier wearing red shirt is very unprofessional. The Filipino guy server, the other Asian guy and girl servers wearing black were awesome at what they do. They served well. Sucks that the cashier girl had to ruin it for them. I told this story to other people I know and they were shocked to hear that we got asked that question if we tipped or not. It's never happened to me until now and it never happened to anyone I know. It ruined our whole dinner experience at this new restaurant because it pissed is all off.",kTpYMVkmUdwdSh5kpcvwqQ,0,0,1,oXF_mLXme_oR2pkInlcLPw

Came in during dinner time 7pm on a Friday night. It wasn't busy so we were seated immediately. First thing I noticed and liked is there menu has a picture for everything! This was really helpful for me and my parents who aren't familiar with Korean dish names. It's always good to see what your ordering. Service was GREAT! Our servers were very attentive and friendly, food was brought out quickly, empty plates were retrieved quick and occasionally servers would come help cook/ cut up meat and serve. It was very nice of them and we appreciated it and didn't feel rushed. 
Their menu is includes all the customary meats you would find at any Kbbq with different appetizers, I really liked that they include cheese corn and spicy rice cake!! (Haven't seen that at any other ayce kbbq in Vegas) 
Here's the downer, only one order of kalbi and premium steak per table...... when it's AYCE. For four people we got one steak, and 4 strips of kalbi. 
Ofcourse we filled up on a bunch of the other meats, but kind of a disappointment for the most popular dishes be limited like that. Especially since dinner that includes everything is 25.95. 
So with this, I wouldn't come back. I'd rather pay 19.95 at other places that offer the same deal with AYCE kalbi and steak.",2nrVIZj0wCbBliCFwUvRBQ,1,0,3,SmdAQhYfBI6z-ZLr-6YEXA
2304031,2017-05-02,5,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"I had friends visiting from back home. They wanted to check out this new all you can eat Korean BBQ spot that got good recommendation from another mutual friend. Shouts! Always down for Korean BBQ especially all you can eat. Over the years just like ramen the growth over the past ten years is nuts. I could count only handful of spots now there all over the valley. Arirang Korean BBQ is still relatively new spot opened couple months ago near the UNLV campus or off major intersection of Maryland Parkway and Flamingo. It not exactly the most pleasant part of town just keeping it real. The little shopping area that it located in looks run down and wonder how the business that are there stay open. Arirang Korean BBQ is located next to CVS. It depends the direction coming from because you could pass it or look for the CVS.

The outside not exactly welcoming or just odd for me. Once you walk inside realize it really nice set up. The ice cream MACAROONS. Talk about first food impression between the vibrants colors and literally smack turn left see in open refrigerator display. The universal smell of all you can eat Korean BBQ all the food grilling you just want sit down and dig in. They have all your banchan set up before we sat down. They have nice assortment. Honest seen lot more at other Korean BBQ spots but the staples like kim chee (my favorite along with japchae) and had japchae all I need and order refill on both. It all you can eat so have couple less not exactly deal breaker for me. The menu I really like all the pictures comes to the proteins and sides. They basically have three different set prices comes to the all you can eat. The cheapest is lunch, middle price, and highest price or go by A, B, C. We went with the middle. The biggest difference is not getting some of the premium meats like ribeye, kalbi, and couple other things. For us the things that came with the middle menu was mainly the stuff we wanted tongue more tongue, pork belly, and couple more items. We got the baby octopus that not sure if going like it. It was much better then I expected. The sauce or marinade made big difference in flavor. It was not rubbery at all. It had kind of teriyaki sweet flavor to it. One worth trying for sure plus interesting see it curl it once hits the girl or thinking it still alive. ;) All the sides are solid. At one point they put the kim chee on the grill. We found interesting or never seen that done before. The server was telling us that the owner recommends or most part see them put some on the grill. It does add different twist but would stick with traditional way. 

The Ice Cream Macaroon Sandwich. Da Bomb!!! Disclaimer NOT part of the all you can eat menu. The server never told us. We kind of figured the way things set up not part of the pre set menu. They look so dam good we expected pay for it and well well worth it. We ordered the Strawberry, Green Tea, and Mango. I ordered Green Tea and Mango. I never tried the Strawberry but my friends said was ono. The Green Tea and Mango was perfect way end great meal. The things truly stood out. They have this perfect uniform shape crazy. The whole time never loses it shape. You would think ice cream would melt it would fall out NOPE. The macaroon and ice cream could have separate be loving dessert life. I would!!! The colors so vibrant and the green tea love the color pink macaroons with green tea ice cream. I know pay extra but would do best save room for one of them. They do offer other desserts besides Ice Cream Macaroons.

The service was totally five stars!! The minute we were greeted when walked in, they were on top of constantly changing out  grill, keep up on our drinks, friendly, and great service. 

The prices are most part same like other spots around town.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,5,7,4,oQY4xp6FkpWMRQb2iwTs_Q

At 10:45pm they welcomed us in with no problem! Didn't tell us to leave or anything lol. Before hand we called to ask what time their last call is and they said 11:30pm which gave us plenty of time to eat and enjoy our dinner.
We had the AB dinner combo. We have yet to try their signature steaks or anything on the ABC combo but we will be back!
We pretty much just got the basics ofcourse to compare to the other kbbq places we've been to. The pork belly was super thick which I'd rather prefer than the paper thin slices they give at other places. The brisket had the perfect balance between meat and fat and the beef tongue....man..their beef tongue is by far the best I ever had.  It wasn't too chewy and the flavor of the meat itself was UH-MAZING! The only thing that let me down a little was the marinade for the spicy baby octopus. In my opinion, I like my marinade to be a mix between spicy and sweet but this one only had a tiny bit of kick and a tiny bit of sweetness. But it's okay bc a little extra dip of sauce and a bite of garlic did the trick! And I'm sure this place will get better in time!
At this place they let you cook your own food but they do come by once or twice to flip or cut the meat which is okay! I don't enjoy having someone consistently at our table cooking every single thing for us and not giving us that privacy like at magal or hobak.
Overall, I loved the customer service! I didn't get the name of our server(s) but everyone there was really accommodating, helpful, and friendly! They came to our table numerous times to make sure everything was okay and it was perfect.

2647385,2017-05-18,0,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"The place is nice and clean, as expected of a grand opening. Sat down, ordered our food, and the waitresses brought the food out quickly. However, the whole ""cook yourself"" experience was taken away from us. I think it was the manager who kept coming over and was flipping the meat for us. It was awkward at times because she'd stand there tossing the meat around the grill and we felt rushed, like she wanted us to finish and leave ASAP. She turned the heat on the highest setting, burning all the juices and sauce from the meats, and quickly charring up the grill, which left a burned taste to the meat also. After we finished cooking the chicken (ourselves, thankfully), we were taking them off the grill to eat, but then the manager came by and quickly moved all the chicken to the side of the grill and dumped a whole plate of beef bulgogi on our grill? We didn't order the bulgogi in the first place so I was kind of like ""What was that for?"" The waitresses were nice though. They were quick to refill beverages, bring napkins, and ask us if we wanted more side dishes when we finished them. 

I also had friends who finished eating their Korean pancake appetizer, and they asked for another plate. The manager came to our side of the table, took our pancake and sauce and just gave it to them instead of making a new plate for them. Is that a trending money saving strategy in new restaurants? It concerned me because what if I wanted more kimchi? Would she take a neighboring table's unfinished kimchi and give it to me instead of giving me a new dish?

After this, we still decided to tip, but honestly, we didn't feel like being generous. We were a group of 6, so they included a gratuity, which is common in most restaurants when serving a bigger group. However, they defaulted to the 20% gratuity without even asking us. What if we wanted to do the base 18% instead? At that point we just paid and left. 

The place is very much outclassed by other KBBQ places in town. Hwaro and Gen are my top two places for all you can eat. 5/5 for them. Goong is my favorite KBBQ, but it isn't AYCE. It's a relatively pricey, but the meat is absolutely phenomenal. Great place for a date or any special occasion. 6/5. Arirang?

As well she would come often to check on our food move it around and toss it on our plates, kept bringing the food trying to cook it for us as if they wanted us to leave and eat as fast as we could. 

We paid $25 each and that includes ""all you can eat"" we LITERALLY ONLY ORDERS 4 meats!! to get a couple of meats and be force to eat and eat as fast as we could. Totally not worth the money being spend. The meat was super chewing and hard to eat. And to top it off we never got a refill on our drinks.

We got the C-$25.95 cuz I love galbi (short ribs) and it's probably one of the chewiest meat I've ever tasted in a BBQ place.  And a few other meats from the C, and non were good neither.

So don't WASTE your money on C, just get the basic B $19.99!!!!!

Now the appetizer: Do NOT get the orange chicken, yucky!! It's so soft and mushy with too much sauce, took one bite and we threw the rest away.

The salad  is Not Korean style sauce, creamy and no flavor.

To start the meal, they offer a green salad with a light miso dressing and 12 other banchan items that were fresh and flavored well. 

What separates Arirang are the appetizers and additional side dish offerings. To complement my meal, I really liked the appetizers that I tried, which included the gyoza, japchae, and corn cheese dishes. Also, included with the AYCE offering is a choice of soup. I choose the Soon Tofu soup which was very good. The meats that I tried were the beef brisket, beef bulgogi, pork belly, marinated pork belly, chicken teriyaki, and baby octopus. All of the meats and seafood were fresh and tasty. The ones that I liked the best were the beef brisket and the pork belly. The pork belly was a premium thick cut piece and very tasty.

Due to the recent opening of the business and proximity of the restaurant, the restaurant was not busy when we arrived. The service was exceptional and our server and waiter were very attentive to our requests and needs.

3065920,2017-04-01,1,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"My cousins and I have agreed that this will be the place we are going to if we are ever craving AYCE Korean BBQ. 

Only having been opened for about 2 months, this place has gotten some dishes right. 

First, let me start with service. Quick, attentive, and helpful, the servers took no time in getting our orders out or checking up on us. They never lowered the heat down to the point where the meat wasn't even cooking. That one bugs me a lot when I go to some kbbq places. The heat would be way to high, then almost no heat at all. 

The meats were pretty good. We decided on the A+B just to try it out for our first time there. We had an order of pork belly, a couple of brisket, an order of bulgogi and like 6 orders of the beef belly (see pictures, almost looks like bacon before cooking), and the steamed egg which was a lot better than most kbbq joints. Haven't been to all so cannot say all just yet. The steamed egg wasn't watery when we got it and it stayed fluffy even after breaking it. 
The meats tasted clean and were cut nicely especially the pork belly. It was thick, not thin like most places. 

Ordered some appetizers such as the gyoza, cheese corn, and agedashi tofu. All three were finished pretty quickly, which meant they were really good. The tofu were thick slices with a thin coating of batter. The cheese corn was almost like a dessert to us.  The gyoza did not taste like it was frozen. 

They do have a lot more options in bonchon than others which include pickled daikon, bean sprouts, Kim chi, cucumbers and more. The salad was ok. Wasn't a big fan of the dressing. 

Overall I believe this place can do wonders. Location is not the greatest IMO, but they are close to UNLV and Yama sushi, who is right next to them, has made it in that location for some years now. 

I'll definitely give the $25 menu a try, especially for the jowl. My cousin has been wanting that stuff for a while now.",TESKhJp4c8cXmJwh5wXkXQ,5,1,5,DS0w1yr-2XB7FCAS5rRRsg
3087747,2017-11-27,1,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"I'd say this might be the AYCE Korean BBQ I've been looking for. After visiting a few hit or miss spots in Chinatown I've mostly settled on non-AYCE Gangnam nearby. Arirang is comparable to Gangnam but with unlimited food! They give you a ton of banchan and appetizers are also included in AYCE. We ordered the egg rolls, orange chicken, tonkatsu, and japchae. I didn't have the egg rolls but would recommend all of the above (especially the japchae). For the meats we got the spicy bulgogi, bulgogi, pork belly, and a few orders of kalbi. At Arirang the waitresses come around and maintain the cooking for you, which is different but fine. They also change out the cook tops often to keep the meat from getting all burned and crispy. I will say it's a lot more efficient than cooking it ourselves, even if it is a little awkward making room for them to reach over your plates to cut, flip and serve meats. The spicy bulgogi was perfectly spicy and I could have eaten this all night. The kalbi was my second favorite, though it was a little fatty (as was the pork belly). I would say Gangnam is just slightly higher quality with the meats. It's also hard to tell if I save any money coming to Arirang because I don't actually eat that much meat. Probably the best part is ordering all the appetizers though. It makes up for it. As far as the service, it was decent. They brought multiple orders to us that we didn't order and they had to bring to a different table. Not sure if they're rushing or the communication is off but we had to tell a server we didn't order prawns about 3 times before she almost placed them on our stove top. It also says on the menu that parties of 4 and over will have an automatic 15% gratuity but it appeared we got charged 18? I'd say this is the best AYCE Korean BBQ I've had in town. Whether or not I can justify coming when I don't eat that much is hard to say but it's definitely fun for groups.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,3,3,4,LQIn_0l6czUMbM21cTyaaQ

Saw this Korean Bbq very near to Yama sushi and end up there instead. We were very very happy we did that. It was so very good. Staff were very friendly and quick. The side dishes/banchan(6-7 kinds)were all delicious. Its an AYCE Korean bbq, mind u. There are 3 menu A $15.99, B $19.99 and C $25.99, more selection and better cut of meat. We could have easily gone with menu A but opted for menu C which includes A and B...we dont eat pork but there were ample other meat to choose from. We had LA galbi/short ribs, spicy chicken, spicy baby octopus, marinated steak and thinly sliced brisket. Wow, were they wonderful. Oh ya, we also had slicy toppoki/korean rice cake, corn and cheese and soon tofu soup. They were also all yummy.

They also have appetizers like corn cheese, pork katsu, and gyoza that are included in the combo as well.

I don't need an hour to eat, they couldn't even give me 30 minutes.  With service like that I'm sure the food is horrible but I'll never know because I'm NEVER going back.  I wanted to like this place.  I wanted to make it a weekly thing but now I'll never know.  As a business owner myself I hate to say this,  but I hope they fail miserably.

I went to go get Itea with my sister and we hadn't had lunch so we looked around and figured KBBQ was safe a bet as any so we went in.

It was a bit past lunch time so the place wasn't too busy and we were sat immediately. This place was a little different than most KBBQ'S we visit. They give you the choice of having noodles, bentos, or all you can eat.We usually get the all you can eat so we went for it.

I swear the number of sides they have... I was in love with this place. We ordered the gyoza, orange chicken, spicy rice cakes, corn cheese, bulgogi, and teriyaki chicken. BIG MISTAKE! 

We ended up filling up on appetizers that we barely ordered the meat but we weren't complaining. They served two gyozas with sauce but I'm assuming it's because we ordered so much already. The orange chicken was good. The sauce wasn't too tangy but it did have a bit of a kick to it. The spicy rice cakes were more traditional here than at other places I've had. It was cooked nicely and the sauce wasn't super spicy. Sadly, I didn't try the corn cheese cause it's not a dish I prefer but my sister loved it. The meat was marinated nicely. All and all I'd come here again.

*Beef bulgogi (thinly sliced & marinated sweet and savory beef
*Teriyaki chicken (marinated chicken teriyaki style)
*Yangyum baby octopus (marinated baby octopus)
*Shrimp (head on raw shrimp)

4108156,2017-05-15,7,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"AYCE KBBQ in 2017? If it's here, then heck yes.

I know that a la carte Korean BBQ restaurants really captured local foodies' attention last year - see my own reviews for Hobak and Magal - but just like those restaurants offered higher-quality food in the non-AYCE niche, there was room for great gluttonous feasts if the right business came along.

Enter Arirang Korean BBQ, which opened up a few months ago in the UNLV area. It's not in the friendliest neighborhood in town, but it's just a short walk from a sushi joint that's also all-you-can-eat and has found success for at least a decade.

You may have noticed the date on this review. It was Mother's Day, and I was concerned that it might be busy, but it was surprisingly not crowded at all. There are numerous a la carte lunch specials available here, but I managed to convince my mom to partake in the endless onslaught of meat that appears to be the main focus here.

I was a bit dismayed that I hadn't previously noticed the fine print about the lunch menu - $15.95 for section A only, which has 10 meat options - being available only on non-holiday weekdays, but I was more than willing to go for the $19.95 A+B meal, which included six additional seafood and meat choices. I'm sure that I'll eventually go for the $25.95 A+B+C meal if only because of galbi and pork jowl, but that will have to wait.

Korean dining typically is accompanied by banchan, a varied selection of complimentary side dishes. They arrayed on our table quite a cornucopia: kimchi, spicy cucumbers, beets, some sort of pickled onion and daikon, potato salad, salad w/ a white dressing, pickled red onions, bean sprouts, and a non-seafood pancake. The freshness and crunchiness of all the veggies was a pleasant surprise, and I really enjoyed everything. Banchan refills are complimentary.

The AYCE price also includes a small selection of ""stews"" and AYCE appetizers, which sometimes distract from the main meat smorgasbord. Definitely not the case here. I only ordered the soybean soup and the steamed egg, and both were quite good. For the appetizers, Japchae (glass noodles) and Corn Cheese both called out my name, and they were both surprisingly awesome. I would be happy with ordering those at any Korean restaurant, so having them available endlessly (if so desired) was a treat. Perhaps I'll venture into the Gyoza or Cheese Pork Katsu next time and hope for a similar surprise.

The meats are clearly the main event, and we ended up trying all of these:

#1 Beef Bulgogi (""A"" menu)
#5 Premium Pork Belly (A)
#12 Yangyum Baby Octopus (""B"" menu), aka marinated baby octopus
#13 Shrimp (B)
#14 Chadol, aka beef brisket (B)
#15 Beef Belly (B)
#16 Beef Tongue (B)

My favorite was the beef belly. These thinly sliced and fatty morsels aren't a typical menu item, and they alone make the B menu a must. The bulgogi and marinated baby octopus were also delightful. I'd characterize the rest as very good - nowhere near the mark of the premium Korean dining spots in town, but certainly not bargain-bin cuts. The unmarinated meats were complemented well by the sauces: oil with salt and pepper, a sweet sauce, and gochujang. Even on a weekday, the A+B menu is definitely worth the premium over the A-only menu.

The raw proteins ended up being mostly left to us hungry carnivores to cook, although employees did step in to cut up some larger meats and to change the grill. You can see charcoal placed by the flame, which seemed to impart some smokiness (especially to my fingers). The grill seemed to be at about the right temperature such that everything cooked up quickly but didn't easily burn. Service was attentive enough that they were at tableside to take our second order of meats not long after I held up a menu in reading position.

A few more notes: rice is available, but rice paper is not (and I only asked at the very end of my meal for you picky eaters out there). The hot tea on the menu is a matcha green tea ($2), and additional hot water is free. Decor is welcoming and clean (including the restroom, per my mom's report) and ventilation is great. Music is a mixture of Korean and American music.

Arirang provided my favorite all-you-can-eat Korean BBQ experience in recent memory and, by a good margin, the best that I've had in Las Vegas. There is still a place for variety, affordability, and deliciousness, and I'm glad to have this unexpectedly memorable and satisfying carnivore's paradise close to my side of town.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,14,11,5,QG6KJZDMKhdsuvnXdEWwHw

For starters, the meat we ordered was outstanding we loved how the quality was for $19.95, but let me take the time to talk about the customer service we have experienced.... not the best one ever.

We walked in very hungry, and was very happy there was only two other tables not including us, we ordered 3 orders of chadol (that felt and looked like one order), pork belly, spicy pork belly. My friend wanted to order the beef and pork bulogi, the server said to him ""why don't you finish the meat you ordered first before placing those order just in case?""
He was sure he would be able to finish what he ordered on top of the other meats we have ordered so said he wanted it. Our meats came out, everything was fine. We tried to order more meat, we tried to get every servers that was there attention, we made eye contact but none came to us. Also can I point out that they were all sitting at a table eating??? But never-mind that. Every time our two servers brought out our order they gave us the stankest eye look ever. I also couldn't help but listen to our servers talking bad about the customers. Little did they know, I am korean and can understand and speak Korean.

I get that we are teens but they should give us a good customer service either way.",ALfSQXTgOdMRULi_-4LkTg,2,0,2,OwN8CY_8wos-HUiVJ6nf5w

Service: Great servers. Dishes came out quickly. We had a sweet lady that would come by to flip the meat or replace the grill. Some people don't like that the servers will cook the meat for them, but I think it's great service! They'll also cut up the bigger meats so yay less work for us.

Thanks Chris V. for the recommendation! This place far exceeded my expectations with all the KBBQ places that have been opening up lately. What I love about this place is that they offer STEAMED EGG & CORN CHEESE! Two of my favorite dishes and they're all you can eat?! 

They offer 3 different tiers of meats, with their respective price points. We usually get the middle option, which offers everything we like. We usually get the beef tongue, brisket, pork belly, and bulgogi. You also get 2 choices of soup with your order and unlimited appetizers and banchan! Their kimchi is really good! And I probably order 3 plates of japchae. They also have 3 dipping sauces, which are all delicious. One spicy, one sweet, and sesame oil with salt and pepper. 

The first time we came, we were offered some dishes that were complimentary of the chef. The seafood pancake was great! 

They serve their soju in a tea pot which I think looks cool. They also have ice cream macarons and mochi for dessert. Get the green tea ice cream macaron! Perfect way to end the meal. 

The servers are also very attentive. They help cut and cook your food. They also change the grill without being asked. And whenever I want more banchan, they're always quick to refill. 

Arirang has quickly become one of my favorite spots! What are you waiting for?! Go check it out!",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,23,17,5,KV5xTeuMxUdU_UDndHqKnA

The marble of the meat and fat was so appetizing I had to order another round with marinated steak. Everything comes with drinks and unlimited orders of appetizers which compliments everything you eat. They have 3 tiers of pricing which compose of $15, $20 and $25.

This place is tucked away on Flamingo and it has only been open seven months. 
    When we entered the building we were immediately greeted and taken to our table, I called in advanced and asked for a reservation, from that moment we sat down another server with a huge smile took our drink order and went over the menu. He explained the two different dinner options and we chose option B (25.99). Option A (19.95) but I wanted the steak so option B was perfect for us, but both options have a lot of variety within them selves so regardless you would be complete. Immediately once our order was taken, our side dishes were on there way. Each one of the sides dishes were delicious, perfectly seasoned and the kimchi was marvelous! It wasn't too acidic which we've had and it overall had great flavor! We ordered that four times! The meats came out shortly after and each item was of better quality!

The service here was top notch. We ordered some meats we weren't totally sure how long to cook but we're helped by the observant staff who made sure to keep an eye on your grill and help you with the cooking when your meat needed flipping or your grill was looking a bit burnt. As a result, we were able to enjoy the octopus without fear of over or under cooking.

Price was very reasonable. We chose combo a+B and tried a variety of different meats. Good flavors on the teriyaki chicken and bulgogi. Beef was thinly sliced and therefore easy to cook. Nice variety of side dishes and

You can order ayce bbq or right off the menu. We decided on menu dishes in order to try the soon dubu. Both of us ordered combos which gave us the soup and I got kalbi, my wife got bulgogi. 

We got tasty, hot soup and tender, delicious Angus beef in portions large enough that we both had leftovers. 
The banchan was delicious and bottomless, including a great salad, kimchi, cucumbers, rice, fish cake (so good!), squash and potato salad. 

We were more full than after a buffet and took home leftovers for tomorrow. 

The service was equally good and the bathrooms were clean-always a good thing. 

They do use msg (I'm allergic), however,  I guess in very small amounts because it enhanced the food's flavor but did not affect me at all.

This place is super clean and has some hip K-POP music videos playing on multiples TVs everywhere..super cool! We came here with empty bellies so we both chose option C (25.95 each) which comes with all the poultry cuts and seafood items, 2 appetizers, 2 stews, and various side dishes to accompany your meal. For the appetizers we chose the pork katsu and Orange chicken. Pork katsu was ok but the Orange chicken was really yummy! Came with some orange slices and was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. My friend got the steamed egg and I got the kim chi stew. Steamed egg was so soft and fluffy; very flavorful! My kimchi stew was yummy as well! 

For the grilling items we chose:
-3 orders of Beef tongue
-Spicy Bulgogi
-Julmulluk (Marinated Premium Steak
-O Sam Bulgogi (Squid and Pork Belly)
-Shrimp

The beef tongue is always my favorite! I like to grill it with jalapeños and garlic cloves..yum! The spicy bulgogi was good however I didn't eat too much of it because my friend loves that stuff so I just let her eat it. The O Sam Bulgogi was superb as well! This squid was so fresh and nicely flavored and even had the tentacles! My favorite! The pork belly in it was good as well and had thin fat attached to it so it was really good with out being to oily salty. The jamulluk was really good too! It was very flavorful and super tender which I loved! I kept dipping it into my kimchi stew! Shrimp was really good and fresh too. I wanted to keep ordering more but they really give you a lot of cuts every time you order and I like to finish everything I get so please don't be wasteful! At the end of our meal we also ordered a green tea macaroon ice cream sandwich. It was hard to bite in to because the ice cream was solid cold but once we let it thaw out a bit it was delicious. 

What really stood out to me was the service here! I didn't catch our server's name but it was this cute male asian server with a little pony tail working on the morning of NYE. He was running that place all by him self and it was getting really busy and he was still on top of his game! Coming to change our grills frequently and getting me whatever I asked for! He even cooked our meats making sure it didn't burn so that we could enjoy every last bite! Keep up the hard work and I hope you are given the recognition you deserve!

And so it begins...

AYCE KBBQ and current Vegas leader of the pack.  Good flavors, good selection, good service, inexpensive.  Hawaii yeeps, this beats any AYCE at home.

Note on ordering:

Selections are grouped in sets each with ""better"" choices that must be ordered by the entire table.
Set A (Lunch only) $15.95
Set A+B:  $19.95
Set A+B+C: $25.95

Banchan, any of eight appetizers (japchae good, corn with cheese strange) and two stews (tofu and kimchi stews solid but not extraordinary) included.  One order limit on a few items.

Straight forward USDA select or LOWER beef, everyday pork, neither of which is well trimmed with lots of residual fat.  Previously frozen seafood.   Use the fat to your advantage.   Proteins are well marinated, slightly sweet, chicken is not.  Gas grills with some charcoal added for a mild smoke flavor.  

Carnivore on a budget wanting to make the most of it?  The ""LA Galbi (bone in, thin cut) has  a lot of residual fat that goes so well with the gristle surrounding the bone.  Meaty, beefy, goodness.  The pork jowls, slightly tough, but very flavorful if you cook it 90% on the fat, rendering it and making it crisp.  Beef tongue (frozen, sliced, thin, and rolled), cooked as a roll in five seconds leaving the inside raw, tender, and flavorful.  Finally the spicy octopus, it's just good eats.

Attentive servers, quick to take re-orders.  Grills changed regularly.  They will get you started and cut up some proteins, then it's all you (preferred).

Not as crowded as some Chinatown AYCE joints making satiating one's hunger much quicker.

In Europe where I live this is harder to come by as in many US cities, so when in the US I always reserve some meal times for Korean. Having visited many Korean restaurants over the years, this restaurant easily ranks in the top 3, if not at nr 1. I was here on a Tuesday night around 20:00h and it was pretty quiet (50% of the tables busy), services was impeccable? Both beef as pork bulgolgi succulent and spicy pork belly to die for.

We ended up just ordering one stew which was the kimchi stew iv never had anything like it before it was amazing. For the appetizers we ordered fried dumplings and cheese corn which both were very delicious.
Also before the meat comes out they bring you a big bowl of salad for the whole table and even that was delicious. When the meat came out the server immediately placed it on the grill which I thought it was nice that they help you with the cooking of everything unlike any other place iv been. They also gave us suggestions on how to eat everything and there advise was well taken everything was just so good. 
All in all if I ever return back to Vegas I will for sure be making a stop here again!!",xQqYgOBeGgJNJgyazUiETg,3,1,5,RFUiFjfr_66gNkOqZMuNdA

This includes all you can eat appetizers even though I get it you don't come for all you can Korean BBQ for appetizers but it's still nice and there is no limit on steam egg, yes some places do have limit on steam eggs. Service excellent, food excellent and love the macaroon ice cream! 

The server definitely gave some good recommendations and he was on point. I'm telling you if you are feeling Korean BBQ you need to come here. They use charcoal and propane to cook the food, which cooks the food evenly and fast. 

Oh FYI space wise this place is roomy we had a baby stroller and there was enough room for that and 5 peps, honestly because most places are tiny if it's a good place lol.",9wfFBzEf-kikxhUTVAgCog,1,0,5,mFvv0k6zmYGaXs1vkCp_Uw

They have either single order of what you want (meat choices) or AYCE (all you can eat). Either way you will walk out a happy full person.,2xtI-3rrmq551NPwtOGNzQ,0,0,5,qdFd-ODm1Zz6y8OJs5WRMw

Just this be aware of the bill, I understand they charge gratuity in large parties but it's ok to charge 20 percent but they charged it after tax and not before tax... I heard you charge tax before taxes, so annoyed she said I am the only one to complain or am I the only
One to call her out... won't be going back",NNhPCJQ_oHA9w9cZuy1AOA,5,0,1,vuh6V-4UldYvSIs6lnVV9g
5463266,2017-05-18,0,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"Dropped by this AYCE joint a few hours before my flight--who says you can't stuff your face before getting trapped on a plane full of people? This establishment is located in the UNLV area and opened recently in January. Being new to the Kbbq bizz, they're a bit rusty on small things, but they quickly make up for it with great service and an incredibly warm staff.

Their lunch special boasts a $15 menu that consists of 10 items, which I thoroughly enjoyed, except for the sad emptiness I felt when I saw there was no brisket on that $15 list. To substitute the brisket, we ordered more of the beef bulgogi. What I can't but critique the most at Kbbq's is the banchan spread (side dishes). My most biggest issue has to be the egg pot. You have some places where it tastes like they had boiled the egg in the LA river while others were cold upon arrival. Arirang's egg pot was still bubbling vigorously when it arrived. I was thoroughly satisfied. My significant other particularly enjoyed the salad and dressing, which  he ordered more of afterwards. 

Was this the best Kbbq I've been to? No, but would I come back, most likely.",3fqjtPCoXYzHSvSXKYP16A,3,1,4,8I4m5V91jGo3L_CSO1iPsw

5767615,2017-05-14,0,7iuruLs-q-_RW06IbsBxZw,"Mixed feelings about this place. In general, the meats are of good quality for the price. Some decisions on side dishes or lack of lettuce wraps as options perplex.

The marinated meats tended to shine while the others were less stellar. 

The A+B combo is the clear value play unless you want Galbi...

Service was stellar the first day and inconsistent the next.

Not sure how long this place will last. The location is lacking which is hard to overcome.",nU4Zz2EHeawnSZQWMLg7NQ,1,0,3,KW0VlvjLE1C9fbqEpj5rQg

Great variety of meats and seafood (even baby octopus!! unusual for KBBQ places to give all you can eat) you can order to grill. I'm always used to having to cook myself, but the waiters are really helpful and always come to check up on you and whatever food you're grilling. Good selection of sides- I do wish they offered my favorite rice sheets, but they don't. 

We did leave smelling like food, but that's pretty typical of KBBQ restaurants.

Either way, great service, prices, and excellent quality of meat! The next time I come to Vegas, this is a go-to place for KBBQ!",xy1UjyJEkeY5vD5r_S8KdQ,1,0,5,x90yx4WvMwtD5DG4NOO8KA
