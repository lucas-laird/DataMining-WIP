This is important to us because my wife cannot eat rice for medical reasons. The waiter assured us twice that sashimi is included. But only after we drove 20 minutes, settled at our table, and ordered or food and waited 10 minutes, did a stone faced and incredibly arrogant manager coming out to say that sashimi is not part of deal.

1420394,2017-12-14,10,ugIDAeQPfKs9GVBaPUSBkA,"Sushi? On the east side? *Record skip*
Mixed in with a million jaliscos, taquerias, and mariscos is Sushiro, tucked into a plaza with a karaoke joint, a clothing outlet, and a Mexican grocery store. If I lived nearby, I'd probably round up just for the convenience of finally having sushi nearby but I ultimately went with three stars because I'd personally drive further to go elsewhere. But this place is A-OK.

They offer AYCE and a la carte, with limited nigiri but reasonable pricing. I opted for the chirashi ($15) which the chef didn't seem to know how to make but he was shown by what appears to be the owner. You can't compare this dish to the chirashis you get for twice the price, but there were a few things to make this version unique- bed was a mix of lettuce and rice, the rice was hot and overly seasoned with eel sauce, and the dish was served with two sauces (spicy chili sauce and a spicy mayo sauce), which were appreciated but unwarranted. The fish was passably fresh, though the shrimp had seen better days. I'm not usually a fan of tamago, and this version had several pieces that seemed to be grilled, which leant an extra layer of flavor and texture that I enjoyed. 

All  in all, my meal was okay. I was the only diner on a weekday during prime dinner hours and the service was fittingly attentive. The dining room is large and clean, and I like that they were playing Jiro Dreams of Sushi  over the bar as I enjoyed my solo sushi meal. I'd pop by again if work brings me to the area again.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,23,14,3,wj8VurYEvk5lnBoVsEH1qg

We ordered the shrimp tempura appetizer, tempura roll, golden roll, caterpillar and dragon. All the rolls came out tasting fine. The only thing is that the food came out at different times. I think we actually never received two of the appetizers due to the crazy is the food delivery. :(

Rolls were great pretty much got a half roll of each to try them all and see which ones I would get more of next time I stopped by. Definitely recommend the Mexican, white orgasm and popcorn lobster. 
Now some of the cons I did see a couple of flys. The edamade was pretty cold and didn't really like how the Golden California roll tasted even (probably because it was deep fried).
All in all a good place to eat and if you live on This side of town you don't have to drive 30 min to get good sushi and good service, plus when I went they weren't packed so I didn't have to wait to be seated.",Lud6LoVP1LicH8MhQZ_5Lw,0,0,4,UnJxW_N4dDpN9lEECUsYqA

I was going to drive back for it but then realized that they didn't even give me the right receipt... the place has a nice atmosphere and we were greated when entering. My only complaint is that they need to be more cautious with orders. They had 30 minutes to make sure they got my order right. It was not busy and that tells me that they were too lazy to double check on my order.

2229587,2018-03-23,0,ugIDAeQPfKs9GVBaPUSBkA,"This place is right around the corner from us, and we found ourselves here one afternoon while craving for sushi.  We were greeted with shouts of ""irrashaimase"" upon entry. The super white tuna is a favorite of my boyfriend, who said, ""this is the first time I've enjoyed super white tuna with anything on it""- the sauce they put on was light and didn't ovepower the subtler flavor of the fish. For being so far off the beaten path for most sushi restaurants most of the fish was pretty good, though the squid was still partially frozen in some spots. We didn't try too many specialty rolls though we both enjoyed how fresh and light the rock and roll was, a cucumber based roll...available most places. The squid tempura was alright, and while takoyaki (misspelled as ""taco""yaki) were a fun thing to find they certainly are not comparable to the real things. We also sampled uni shooters, something not listed on the menu but they were happy to make it when we inquired. There were lots of options available for any other diners who choose to go the AYCE route, as we did. They've got rice bowls, sushi boats (no longer), sashimi... worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood and really need sushi. One thing to note is that the restaurant is still pretty young and they seem to have a high turn over, so presentation isn't very consistent over multiple visits. The same rolls will look completely different during the same meal, and some items have either removed from the menu now or served/made differently. Uni and ikura have been limited to one gunkanzushi for an order, unlike other AYCE places that serve two per order. I've witnessed several tense interactions while dining involving the staff, both with servers and visitors, which makes the small restaurant uncomfortable. Maybe in time they'll work out the kinks. The servers we've met were all sweet  and the food's not bad, just needs more time to find their groove if the restaurant is able to get footing in an unlikely area. Personally, after seeing how the staff are treated I'm not going back ever again.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,0,0,1,cVV18WJqW3uqkomMx5aLxw

Food - I would say this is one of the better AYCE in town.  We came here after volunteering at the nearby Salvation Army.  To be honest, because of the plaza it's in, we weren't expecting much.  It's a very nice surprise.  It has the best yellowtail amongst the AYCE restaurants.

Service - the waitress was clearly new to the sushi game but was very friendly.

They constantly checked up on us to make sure everything was perfect and were very patient for we are very picky with our food (my girlfriend is a vegan). I could tell in a short period of time they are really trying their best to be a successful and courteous restaurant while only being open for about a month. It is understandable that they had a waitress on her training day, but man was she great! Now, the food! It was amazing, every single bite of it, from the appetizers to the special rolls and deep fried rolls, we absolutely loved it; they even made a special roll just for my girlfriend to fit her vegan needs. 

Overall food was amazing and some of the best shrimp tempura and agedashi tofu I and my little party have ever tasted! Service was astonishing and couldn't have asked for any better. Definitely coming back for more in the near future.",uqNdk5Izypi-VkdoO4PjQQ,1,1,5,ACAtw38Mku_xN4sIWRIFgA

The spot isn't too big, but service was quick. I sat at the bar and did the all you can eat (dinner version since you get better stuff than the lunch version). I just had the sushi chefs pick whatever they wanted and was pretty dang happy.

Some of the options were a little sauce heavy, but most were light and fresh like sushi should be. 

One dish that was memorable was the ""Hawaiian style poke"" they served, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't ""Hawaiian"" any more than pineapple on pizza is. I chuckled to my self as I ate the ahi with futikake, onion, and shoyu and moved on to the next plate. They even have uni on the menu, which was pretty good.

Wonderful service from waitress Mariel and fast & delicious service from the sushi chef! 
 I noted their Bento box is $9.95 for a whole lot of items. I'll probably get that for my kids.
