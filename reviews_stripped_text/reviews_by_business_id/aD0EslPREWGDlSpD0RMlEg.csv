Coming from the service industry, I always look at the cleanliness of the place and this place exceeds my expectations! I was in awe how clean their cutting board was! lol. This place will make you feel like you're not in Vegas. The food made me reminisce that time when I was at the night market in Kowloon! A place I definitely will frequent more often. I tried the BBQ duck with rice and washed it down with a Thai tea. I will recommend both! CLEANEST Asian restaurant I've been to!!!

If you find yourself in sin city... do not miss an opportunity to try the roast pork - it is ""delicioso"".  The roast pork is listed on the menu as ""Roasted Belly Pork"".  We have tried roast pork at plenty of restaurants in Monterey Park, SF Chinatown, Cupertino, Hong Kong, Vancouver Chinatown, etc... and this place has one of the best ""chanchito"" around!  We ordered won ton with noodles soup and the noodles were not overcooked and Hong Kong style.  Soup broth was just okay.  Also had a Yang Chow Fried Rice that was a bit on the greasy side, but acceptable if you are hungry.  We will definitely come back for the roast pork on our next visit to Las Vegas.",ZLE0AvotqcWGPBqy1K3ANA,3,2,4,Ksn1qN5cVRLqumqoyq5cvQ

Tucked away in the same area as Q Karaoke, District One, and Icy Juicy and you'll find this joint. Not really a name or a nice sign that the normal eyes could see but it's one of those places where you'd have to stick your head in and see what this place is all about.

First and foremost, this place is CASH only. Secondly, this is an asian restaurant so don't be expecting top notch 5 star service.

The food.
Poultry and meats are prepared in the back and hung in display out front chinese butcher shop style. One of the best roast ducks I've had in Sin City. I'm not usually a fan of roasted pork belly but I'd order it here because it's so damn good. Juicy inside and a nice crunch on the outside.

This place is not your ordinary chinese restaurant as you won't find dim sum or any exotic chinese or seafood dishes here. It's more for the simple person to enjoy to get in and out quickly.

First occasion, I ordered a packet of rice with BBQ pork , roast duck n pork belly to go. I asked the lady for extra sauce with my meat, when I got home there weren't any so I guessed maybe she might have forgotten. Fine !!!

Yesterday, I ordered the same item again. This time round, I ask the same lady again : ""can u PLEASE give me extra sauce. Here comes her answer : ""There's already sauce on you rice"". and she was real eager to collect $$$ from me and get me out of her sight. obviously I knew it, doesn't she understand what is EXTRA sauce? 

Could not explain how angry I was when I left the shop. I was asking myself maybe I should have asked her :"" Can I pay you for some extra sauce?""",Q_z8A0bwliV9U4wWy2G5iA,0,0,1,ZxbKojEpld2A0Axf5P9uHA

The flavor was very nice and I knew I wasn't eating Sam Woo's roast pork.  It different, it didn't have the Sam Woo flavor.  It had it's own distinct flavor that was equally as good.  And I was so happy it wasn't Sam Woo.  In the Asian population, everyone knows that Sam Woo has the best BBQ in town.

I ask her how is that even sanitary and it is extremely inconvenient. We purchased nearly $50 worth of food and she cannot spare two more sets of Chopsticks and to go plates? The worst part is she was telling me then don't go eat there.

and with the good skin.  Char Siu was ok but as a Hawaii transplant it still feels different.  I think  I'm gonna give this place a 4 simply because even though the pork dishes are obviously tasty and well marinated, it wasn't straight from the roaster (as opposed to say if you went to Chinatown and got some fresh roast pork and char siu right before lunchtime...they're still hot and juicy inside.... mm that's hard to beat)

Anyways, we were here for dinner.  we also tried the ribs, ginger chicken,  shrimp fried rice, and some bok choi.  Ok, standard..  Pretty inexpensive tho so overall it's pretty good.  It's clear that the pork is the key here (as if all the pork hanging up in that case with a guy chopping his cleaver constantly isn't a clear sign)

My folks were tired of their tourist group dinners after traveling in the US for 10 days and just wanted something light and homey. So, being the wonderful daughter I am, I snuck them out in the dark and off to the Chinatown. 

Asian BBQ & Noodles must be a relatively new establishment since I don't recall seeing it in the same strip mall where HK Star is at, which I visited a few times in my Vegas days.  

The waitress greeted us in Cantonese without hesitation, and I knew we were in for some authentic Cantonese delicacies. The menu items are similar to what you would get in many great small eateries in the back alleys of Guangzhou or Hong Kong. 

To address my folks' distressed stomachs, I ordered boiled baby bok choy with oyster sauce, pickled daikon radish, one of the speciality rice porridges and plain rice noodle soup. They were all nicely done and so very comforting. Since Cantonese Style Rotisserie (or BBQ if you are not too hung up on the strict definition) is their speciality, I could not resist the roasted pork belly and it was near perfection. They ran out of roasted duck before we had the chance to try it. 

It was around 8PM on a week day and this place was packed with Asian patrons. Service was casual but very efficient. Cash only. 

I have never had a better meal for the tiny amount of money we spent. My folks were so proud of me that they have forgiven me for all the headaches and disappointments I have brought them.",1cF0kgsaBy-l7od8bh899w,2,3,5,5w097W-iAMStfqV6SBpNgw

Very very very good noodles and amazing won ton. I haven't had similar quality won tons since my trip to Hong Kong last year.  Roast pork is crazy crispy.  Not just crispy, CRAZY CRISPY.  You won't chip a tooth, but you will definitely feel the crunch. BEST ROAST PORK I have had in a long time.

The restaurant was VERY clean, the wait staff struggles with english at times but definitely know enough to take your order, and the best part of all our lunch was $20 TIP INCLUDED..

My friend said the other dishes are awesome as well.  If you have a hankering for Cantonese chinese food and are on a budget, this is definitely the spot for you.. You know what they say, ""when in vegas, do as the CHINESE do."" :)",lLWkiKb9j7EDz1Nfq7-Xvg,5,4,4,im6cVankTOvAobBf-sNnEQ

We were seated right away because it was still early, 7 pm. We ordered roast pork and duck combo with rice, choi sum with oyster sauce, and sizzling beef with tomatoes on fried noodles.  The roast pork was a bit dry but the duck is crisp and tender. The choi sum was soft and plenty for a $4.25 plate. The sizzling beef on fried noodles was not disappointing. The sauce was the the right amount not to make the fried noodles soggy. 

As usual we did not expect good and attentive service. The servers were doing just an adequate job of taking the order, bringing the tea (instead of water as we ordered) and dishes, and giving us the bill at the end. So, 4-star is awarded.",9ElcsQca9jJ-Is-do2whhA,2,2,4,LXwR3gQxRcxTnOHoAziM2A

Something must have been wrong with the heat because everything was cold except for the bowls of corn water (it certainly wasn't soup!), that was McDonalds coffee hot. I know ginger chicken is served cold but I prefer mine closer to room temperature than refrigerator cold. Both the chicken and roast duck had so little meat on them. I cook poultry a lot and recognized both portions as coming from the poultry backs which are the least meaty parts. The oyster sauce on the cold broccoli was so salty and plentiful I had to scrape most of it off.

We had:

1. Roast duck and pork belly: Just friggin' delicious. Portion was plenty for all of us with just one plate. The whole plate was packed; although the plate itself was not too big to begin with. 

2. Hainan chicken rice: Yummy!! The rice was a little hard (seemed like it had been sitting out for a while), but the chicken was tender, moist, and the whole combination was flavorful.

3. Salted fish and chicken fried rice: huge portion and big on flavor! So goooood! 

4. We also ordered sides of fishballs and green broccoli - fresh, cheap, and delicious!

We were pork belly virgins  and let me tell you after RBP, we'll never look back! It was beyond yummy; crispy outside and SO smooth and tender inside. The duck had great flavor as well, but a bit more fatty than meaty. It had great flavor and what do you expect from duck! We still loved it. Dish came with rice, a bit of 'gravy' and greens. Oh and don't forget the dipping sauces, beyond yummers.  

The Beef Chow Fun was another amazing dish that we tried after reading another Yelp reviewer. So glad we did!  Wide perfectly cooked noodles, a very light sauce, scallions, and beef. The beef was cooked to perfection and didn't have a trace of fat or gristle.  Beyond good.

In the middle of the space is the magical BBQ window with roast pig and duck hanging behind it, with staff busily shouting and chopping away like in a Chinese market (i.e. if you're looking for someplace legit, you have hit the jackpot without even having to make a bet!!) The staff speak Chinese and Vietnamese, and the menu is in those languages too! We ordered:
-""hai san"" chicken which is a small portion but appropriate for the low price
-roast pork, which is cut up in very small pieces. The taste is not excellent but I will say it is very good and comforting.
-congee with seafood. Again like the roast pork it's not excellent but it's pretty darn good for what it is. The portion size is also appropriate with the low price.
-chinese broccoli with oyster sauce. For only $3.50 you get a very small, efficient portion which fed my party of three perfectly. You can always order two portions if you have a bigger party.
Food was brought out very quickly, with the exception of our congee which our server warned us about wait time beforehand.

1409479,2014-02-04,0,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"One of the very few good chinese BBQ places left in vegas. If anything, in my opinion, its the best in Vegas. 

First of all..... CASH ONLY ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Make sure you have cash, otherwise no yummy food for you ! Applies for entire restaurant, not only the BBQ. Wells Fargo, Chase, and Bank of America are down the street, less than 1/4 mi away.

Ok now that's over. This is a nice little place, in the opposite corner (NE) of the same center as Q Karaoke, HK Star, Cue D's, and China Mama. Quite busy during lunch and dinner hours and they close early. 

They have a variety of foods, that you would normally find in a traditional chinese BBQ place. Noodles, rice plates, fried rice, veggies, etc. Some of their popular dishes would be the ""Noodle Soups"" with a variety of noodles and toppings or the traditional wonton (??) or shui jiao (??) dumpling. 

One different thing about this place, that sets it apart from the rest, is their ""Cart Noodle"" (???). Originated in Hong Kong, it was originally sold on carts. Noodles were freshly cooked to order, with your pick of toppings ranging from pig feet, pig skin, pig stomach, pig intestines, pig blood, etc (continuing on to beef and chicken parts as well). 

This place, gives you a choice of a variety of noodles, and your pick of either 1, 2 or 3 toppings. My favorite combination is Thin Egg Noodles with Pig Intestine, Mix Beef, and Pig Feet. 

The noodles will be cooked to a chinese style of al dente (when its done right...) It should NOT be too soft, but not undercooked hard. It should give a nice bite. 

Another popular item would be their ""BBQ on Rice"" ranging from Roasted Pork on Rice, BBQ Pork on Rice, Roast Duck on Rice, Combination of Two on Rice. As you can see, they have fresh roasted items avail, hanging and cut to order. 

Their Roast Pork is one of my favorites. Priced at a little less than $11/lb for a to-go order (price is different if eaten there), but its a good deal. This is one of the few places in town, that prepare only the belly, vs the entire pig. No bones. All same sizes. Better bang for the buck, right? Crispy bubbled pig skin, wonderfully seasoned, nice proportioned meat to fat ratio, cut to bite sized pieces. Good to snack on (yes ive bought this as a snack) or eaten with your meal ! 

The guys who cut the items are actually fairly accurate. If you want 1 lb, they will be fairly close on it. 

Their roast duck is also a good item to order. Crispy skin, meaty and flavored nicely. Good combination to be eaten with rice or noodles. Can be ordered to-go in half or whole duck. 

If none of the above appeals to you, their fried rice and noodles are nicely done as well ! Good ""wok hei"" as what chinese would call it. Its like an extra flavor that appears when you use a high flame and a wok to cook things. Almost imagine it as, maybe a smokey flavor? 

Great place for a quick bite to eat or with a few people, or even to go and bring home for dinner",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,0,4,QqoM5yJeUgYbPn2cVctASQ
1416071,2013-10-25,0,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"This place offered probably one of the best Chinese foods in town.  The focus here is Chinese Barbecue.  The restaurant itself is not too big and the ambience feels a bit old style like the 80s.  

BBQ Platter was great here, not restaurant style with fancy stuff in the middle, just 3 types of meats.  Roasted Pork, Char Siu, and Duck were all delicious.   The half of a chicken was good, and they sliced up the breast prior to serving it to reduce the effort needed to chew through it.  We got some pig feet and pig blood noodles, not something you can get everywhere, but they did a fine job on those too.

Their XO Rice Roll was a surprising discovery, as it came with stir-fried eggs, which most restaurant does not.  Visually gave a stunning appeal, the eggs did not do much to improve the dish, and it tasted about the same as other places.

After visiting many Chinese restaurants in Vegas, Asian BBQ & Noodles definitely stands out among them.  Service was decent and they were quick to response to various requests we had.  Oh, and remember to bring CASH.",B2F7f8NdlBUESv8cskE-jw,2,0,5,HV-3VoIpQRWOVfz8W6naqA

I have wanted to try Asian BBQ for years ... however, my wife's favorite ramen place is right next door - Ramen Tatsu ... and we usually end up there.  However, this time we wanted something different (and cheap). We were shopping across the street at Jones Market and said let's try it.  

We get the ultimate parking space - right against the front door.

Good start.

Then the scary words on the door ... CASH ONLY ... say what?!?!!?   Yep, CASH ONLY!

My wife and I dig through our wallets and find a $20 bill ... OK, we will see what we can share.

1464524,2018-04-24,8,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"After dining here for the third time, I can confirm that I like going here for cheap and delicious bbq meat and rice plates. 

Pros

Roast Meats: I've only had their roasted duck, barbecue pork, and their crispy roasted pork and I l always find myself ordering the same items because it's that good. The meats are tender and juicy and there's so much salty or sweet flavors going on that you didn't even need the dipping sauces which they include in all rice plates. If you get the rice plates which is a great deal, they'll pour some meat juices on top of your rice with a side of bok choy. I've had my fair share of Asian barbecued meats but there was something magical about their meats that keeps me coming back. 

Price: I'm still amazed after all these years with how inexpensive and delicious the rice plates are. There's actually a lengthy number of items to choose from which is great for family style dining but the bbq meats and rice plates are a hit here. Of course prices have increased throughout the years but still a satisfying option while staying on a budget. You'll notice locals, tourist, families, couples, and a bunch of people all dressed up for partying dining here under one roof. 

Service: I've never had issues in all the times I've ordered from here. Not as personal but they get the job done and communication is easy with them. They also come by frequently to get your drinks refilled. 

Cons

Wonton Noodles: While their wontons noodles are another popular item of choice, I thought it was bland compared to their savory barbecued meats. Shrimp wontons are good but you need some type of condiment for more flavor and the noodles and broth are just okay. However it's still cheap for the price and if you need something warm, order it to share and they'll bring you small bowls if you ask.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,12,12,4,zBFnOI29GDPD4wa30GKrGQ
1466067,2014-11-27,0,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"This place is one of those hole in the wall. If you can bypass some of the asian rudeness then you will find that this place is a goldmine. This place can get crowded as its a very small restaurant. When there is a line of peoppe, it can get confusing. They dont really have a number system and when they give you a ticket, they just write down the number of people. So once you get your number, you will need to keep a mental note of who was there before and after you or else yoy may wind up have a MoFo come in and take your spot.

Other than that, the food is fantastic. The porridge taste better than some of the restaurants in the san gabriel valley and the bbq is tastier and softer as well.

Curry Noodle with Pig Feet: This is my favorite dish here. We originally wanted fish ball instead of pig feet but they ran out. I love the broth. The broth isn't a strong curry like thick Indian curries but it was really flavorful. The pig feet was really tender too. They give about 6 pieces and a few vegetables.

Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce: It seemed that they overcooked the broccoli because the stem of the broccoli was soft and the leafy part was soft to almost gooey consistency. So I didn't care for this dish much. The sauce was good and not too salty.

BBQ Pork: Because a lot of people come in here for their bbq items (ex. duck, pork, etc.), they sell them so quickly that they didn't cook it long enough. But I noticed that people taking food to go order it, so they must cook it long enough on occasion. Maybe we just got a bad batch. 

Meatball Egg Noodle Soup: The meatball is pretty good. It was soft. The egg noodle is pretty good too. It was really thin. 

Service was ok. They don't have a lot of workers here but the food came out quick.

The restaurant is sooo small. The distance between tables are quite close. They also have a hard time with large groups that are more than 4 people because they have to combine tables for large groups.

I have probably been here 20 times. It is THAT good.  I am lucky enough that every time I go, I get a seat everytime. I have drove by where I see a line forming outside (yikes!).It is not exactly a ""take-you-out-on-a-first-date"" atmosphere, but it is more of a hole-in-the wall. 

There are an array of dishes and one can easily order one too many dishes! So, I will provide you with my ALL-TIME Favorites:

Roasted Duck - Crispy skin and thin meat
Chicken Rice Porridge - creamy bowl of congee
Combination Chow Mein
BBQ Pork

I have tried many items on this menu and I can tell you that their dishes are high quality. This is not exactly healthy, but the food here is very authentic and consistent! For the quality of the food, it is quite inexpensive. Trust me, I have been here 20+ times!

Service is great and fast! If you come here and there is a line, go next door for some happy hour drinks or just wait!

I wanted to introduce some variety into our Las Vegas dining adventure, which largely consisted of venues on the Strip. The boyfriend loves roasted duck, so this place was a no-brainer. BBQ, noodles, great prices, and across from 168 Market so that we could pick up some water, Asian pastries, and sake. Perf.

There were a few parties ahead of us, but we got seated within 2 minutes of writing my name down. Service is fast, which is crucial if you're friggin' hungry. Per Yelp's advice, we brought cash for our meal.

We ordered #23 2-combo BBQ plate with roasted pork belly and roasted duck for $13.99--delicious. I also got #38 roasted duck wonton noodle soup, $9.99. The shrimp & pork-filled wontons were fab (I love wontons), and the thin egg noodles went well with the salty meats. My boyfriend got #40 chicken vermicelli rice noodle soup, $9.99. The shredded chicken meat seemed a bit dry, and my boyfriend admits that he should have gotten what I ordered.

We bid twenty seventeen goodbye with the roasted duck served over this divine sauce that yielded a moist, tender, roast duck. The skin was crispy which is always a plus but the honorable mention is the sauce. It is savory, aromatic, and full of flavor. I love how they provide you with hot tea after you are seated and it is a bottomless serving. My partner in crime gives our meal 4.5 quacks and a tea plus (justincredible).

It rivals the best in San Francisco China Town !

The place was clean and efficient, very busy during lunch hours.  The restaurant closes on Fridays (that tells you how well the business is doing that they would choose to close on one of the busiest days of the week).

It was so good that we had to return the next morning for another yummy meal before hitting the road.  btw, we also ordered quite a bit of bbq and roasts to take home.

It was a different twist from the original flavors you find around LA. Their wonton's were especially flavorful! They added a bit of sesame seeds in them to give it that flavor. Would not have imagined wonton's ever with sesame seeds nor did we ever think works well in a wonton, but it did. Their noodles are a bit different from the traditional (darker yellow and curlier) type noodles. They are lighter and more vermicelli-like but surprisingly still el dante in texture which makes up for it. I prefer the traditional way on this one, so depending on your taste buds you may or may not prefer the noodles. The soup is also different (not your traditional or as genuine). Basically, a different twist in flavors (more from my home town then my husbands) but still good. Generally, I would give the wontons a 9/10, the noodles/soup a 7/10, giving the dish an 8/10. 

We got the duck and bbq pork with rice too. They were yummy too especially the sauce they put on the rice! Note that its probably made with the duck fat so it would be cholesterol up the ying-yang but so yummy.
The curry fish balls and pork ear cartilage were yummy too. Perfectly seasoned!

Ambiance:
Its in Chinatown, a mom and pop. Don't expect it to be fancy and if you can not stand a whole duck with the head and all and other meats hanging around, then you may not want to eat here. Take it to go or face the other way if possible.

Several years later and it seems to have brought in many different types of Asian cuisine. 

This was our second great find of EDC weekend. We were supposed to get pho but I stumbled on this page while searching and couldn't resist after seeing the bbq, noodles, and jook or congee. 

Being the driver has it's perks such as making an executive decision to hole in the wall restaurants on the whim. 

This time we went into the restaurant with a party of 7. They had no problem seating us. Half way into the meal people started filling up the restaurant. It seemed like we just beat the rush. 

We sat down got our menus and some hot tea. 

The waiters passed by us several times as we were ready to order. We had that foreigner veil over our table and service will seem to be slower than if I were to be with my parents. No big deal, it's something I've gotten used to. 

Eventually I am able to wave down a waitress. I exercised my Cantonese and ordered as many of the dishes I could recognize. The waitress had no problem taking the orders in English but dropping some Chinese usually makes the service a bit better. It's not guaranteed. 

We ordered a lot of food to share, family style. BBQ pork and Duck, Combo fried rice, Beef chow fun, Seafood pan fried noodles, a bowl of congee, and 1 bowl of wonton noodles for me and a bowl of braised beef noodles for my friend. 

The first item to come to the table was the fried rice. My friend said it smelled sooooo good as the waitress set it on the table. And it really was good. Everything was great. But I would have probably skipped the beef chow fun and I felt the braised beef was better than the wonton noodles. 

In the end I ordered too much. We still had a lot of bbq pork and roast duck left over so we boxed it up and took it back to the hotel. After a long nap the next day, three of us devoured the left overs like primitive hungover cavemen; in our dark, curtain covered, cave like hotel room.

Got the won ton soup based on all the other rave reviews- I like that the broth was actually seasoned, and the won ton filling had a good sesame oil flavor, but this dish doesn't travel well and is probably best left off your list if you're grabbing takeout.

Been back quite a few time to get the egg noodle and shrimp wonton stoup which Toni T claims the closest thing to traditional tasting. Would i agree to this statement? I dont know, never been anywhere that has enough reasonable creditably to establish themselves as THE place to get shrimp wontons. Regardless the wontons were stuffed with minced/smashed shrimp thus giving a nice plump shrimpy texture. they didnt cut corners by throwing all those tasty shrimp into a food processor till it was just a mush. The soup wasnt bad either and didnt contain that much MSG which is a HUGE plus

If you're not in the mood for soup, and who is these days with summer right around the corner as soon as the weather ponies finish winter warp up (MLP reference!!) then go for the two bbq combo rice plate. I grab bbq pork and roast pork. If you're getting take out then dont expect any soup to come with your order but dining in rates you some soup. 

Overall i'd like to stop by more to try other things on the menu as well. Problem is very rarely do i get cravings for Chinese food. I actually crave Mexican more than i do Chinese which is just down right..weird...

Wontons with Duck - the wontons are so crispy and the broth is hot and sweet. Perfect on a cold day. 
Chicken and Salty Fish Fried Rice - huge portion, definitely big enough for two. Add a little of their chili and its to die for.
Crispy Seafood Noodles - again very big portion but I eat the whole thing by myself because it is that good! Again add their delicious chili and its extra delicious. 
I have also tried their porridge, very smooth and perfectly seasoned, their bread sticks go really well with the porridge. 
I also usually get an order of their signature Roast Pork, Mixed Intestine, Curry Fish balls. 
I have tried other items but these are the ones I also go back to! 

The place gets very crowded, not great for large parties.. they only have the middle section where they can put tables together but if you come with a party larger than 8... chances are they do not have enough tables to put together. 
Typical service for a place in Chinatown but the staff are great, they are quick with cleaning tables, quick to bring out drinks and quick to take orders. They are very organized, staff are always on top of cleaning tables and seating guests.

The roast pork was pretty flavorful too.  The duck was just okay (not that much meat and a lot of gristle), don't really recommend this unless you have to have duck. 

The noodles are okay, but portions are big. We got beef chow fun, and some dish using thin wheat noodles ($7 each for both) - both weren't that great but certainly passable.  We also had salty fish fried rice which was a little too fishy - I wouldn't do that again.

The first thing you notice when you walk in is that familiar smell of chinese roast bbq and you can see the hanging meat in the glass case full of roast pork belly, bbq pork, and duck.

I was excited because I have been looking all over Las Vegas for some good BBQ pork and when I arrive the line was out the door! 

When I walked in I knew exactly what I wanted to order! 1 pound of BBQ pork to go! We were making our own soup at home and just needed the meat to top it off.

Anyways I waited in what I thought was a line to place my order, but everyone ignores me!!! Then I asked the lady at the counter who would take my order and she looked away!!! So I stopped someone else in the place and said who can take my order to go? They pointed in the direction of a woman walking around helping ALL of the people who were behind me in our line. 
Finally after about 5 min she approached me took my order and them gave me a number. Yay!!!

Then it goes downhill... I waited for 25 minutes.... In front of register with my 4 year old who they kept telling to move. And all of a sudden the lady who took my order comes up and says... We are out of the BBQ pork!!!! You can wait 30 more minutes but the regular customer got it!!!!!


Omg! I was livid!!!! 
Was really excited! Wanted to give it a shot, but on too of the customer service towards me being horrible I didn't even get to taste the food!

2323024,2014-07-18,2,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"Been here a couple times and I've quickly learned that their BBQ meats are the only thing worth getting. Don't get me wrong, their BBQ is probably the best I've had in town, but the other items on their menu? Not so good and I would not get it again.

First thing you'll notice when you walk in are the BBQ meats hanging from the window by the back counter. Their roast pork belly with the crispy skin is to die for and their BBQ pork is really good as well. I haven't tried the chicken or duck so can't comment on it but from the looks of everything hanging in the window, it looks pretty damn delicious. You can order meats as an order or rice plate combo. If ordering to go, everything is by weight.

The other items are another story. I've tried the congee, BBQ pork chow fun, Chinese broccoli and a combo soup noodle w/ pig feet and curry beef tendon. The congee was meh, so-so; I've definitely had better at dim sum places. The BBQ pork chow fun was the only thing good out of this group and probably only because it had BBQ pork. The Chinese broccoli was all stems and very little leafy parts which was disappointing and the soup noodle was terrible because the noodles were clumped together which made it difficult to eat.

Because this is a traditional Chinese style restaurant, service is not very good and it'll take a while to get someone's attention even though they have many employees roaming the restaurant at any given time. Also, don't bother speaking to them in Mandarin because their English is definitely a lot better than their Mandarin...they'll just look at you like they understand and then they'll disappear and you'll never get what you asked for. We spoke to 3 different waiters in Mandarin trying to get our check and to go boxes and 1 by 1 they disappeared and were never seen again. After waiting 10 min and speaking with 3 waiters, we ended up going up to one of the ladies and speaking to her in English and magically we got what we wanted. If they didn't understand us then why wouldn't they just say so? How rude! Definitely 1 star for service based on my most recent visit! But their BBQ is good and I'll continue coming back just for that, but not anything else though",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,5,3,3,rVI_4ofTgTercFj-RGH0TQ

I was somewhat hesitate at first but I wanted to try something new. I looked over the menu briefly but talking to my friend. I gave it back and gave it to the pro to order. I took his word for it and about 5 dishes came out. 
I wish I knew what they were so I can order them again if I was ever in Vegas.

I know I had BBQ pork, Wonton soup, vegetables on the side, and a couple other dishes as well.
The food was really well-made and you can taste how good it was. I honestly am not sure how else to describe. It's one of those things where you have to go there and find out for yourself!

After reading several yelp reviews on this place, I decided to try the Wonton soup (4.99) and the two meat combo plate with steamed rice (6.99). The lady at the counter must have known it was my first time there, because she practically grabbed my hand and walked me over to the hanging pork and duck. The roasted duck was a little fatty for my liking, but the BBQ pork was amazing. 

The pork was super tender and had a sweet flavor. I recommend adding a little chili oil to the pork!  The combo plate came with about 10 slices of each protein , steamed rice and greens. At first I thought they were  green onions, so I put them off the side. Upon further review, I added them back to my plate and was glad I did. 

Unfortunately, I didn't agree with previous yelp reviews on the Wonton soup. The broth reminded me of miso soup and seemed to have a fish stock base to it. The Wontons themselves contained shrimp -which I did not expect. Since I am not a huge fan of shrimp, I can't confirm that this is the best version of Wonton soup in Las Vegas (as other have claimed). 

The restaurant is clean, and well organized. There is a large menu on the wall behind the cash register that makes it easy to order. My food was ready in less than 10 minutes, and was still piping hot when I got back to work. I love this place, and can't wait to come back.",fOut10lknIp64tm3z6UTNg,1,1,4,Dhz0PrN4EGw8eJtUpiTgoQ

Sadly there has been a change since our last visit: Price has gone up ($6.50) and broth and noodle has gone down. The soup was lackluster. Noodle was slightly overcooked and bland. Quantity of the noodle seems less. However, the wonton remains the same: full of flavor!

Roast Pork: a crispy layer of skin, 90%fat, and 10% salty pork. I literally had mounds of fat leftover after I dissected the pork layer out. Eat with caution!

Roast Duck: Overly flavored and very salty. I felt like they overseasoned the duck or maybe I am just spoiled from the roast duck in San Francisco. Super oily but still yummy.

Right when I walked in, the ladies working the front eagerly waved me down and started convincing me that I wanted a lb of everything. It reminded me of walking into a car dealership and approaching the wave of commission based salesmen. Be sure to stay strong or you will succumb to the glorious pork that's glistening right in front of you and end up buying more than you intended. 

Initially I was planning on purchasing a half lb of each, but I easily couldn't resist and ended up buying 1 lb of each - roast pork belly and BBQ pork, all for $27.20. They weigh each kind of meat (majority of the time it's a little over what you intended to buy) But, I honesty don't regret buying a little over (unless I was on a strict budget). Make sure to request a copy of your receipt if you need one, they don't give one typically for BBQ take-out orders. 

I took one bite and was astonished on how crispy, juicy, and flavorful the roast pork belly was. Wow, can I just say mouthgasm? Nothing in this world can beat an expertly roasted crispy pork belly skin. They make a wining one here with an indescribable magical crunch. They also provide a small container of plum hoisen sauce to dip your pork belly in. They pair perfectly together - perfect harmony of salty and sweet.  

As I expected, The BBQ pork was expertly prepared as well. Tender, moist, seasoned well and not over salted. It would be amazing in sandwiches (banh mi), with rice, in egg noodle soup...or hell, served in a boot!

2851831,2012-06-27,1,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"The ultimate Asian cheap eats joint in Las Vegas that delivers on every level.

Authenticity- here you will find old school Hong Kong barbecue where the meats are hanging off the racks  with oil dripping off their skin like LeBron James sweating in the 4th quarter leaving behind a beautiful glistening sheen enveloping juicy meat-tastic goodness that is sliced to order.  If you are rusty on your Chinese, be prepared to point at the numbers of each food item you are interested in partaking. 

Texture- nice chewy noodles in their soups, perfectly fried skin cradling the underside of an entire backside of pork belly, the appropriate amount of spring to their wontons and fishballs, they definitely get it right with every bite.

Flavor-  No dish is subtle as each ingredient provides depth of flavor yet avoids becoming overpowering.  The wonton noodle soup is well balanced in terms of it's fish-stock like broth yet a dash of red vinegar or chili oil is permissible if not encouraged.  The meats are well seasoned to be eaten straight up but for added layers of flavor explosion, virtually all are accompanied by their own appropriate dipping sauce.  Even the rice that accompanies the bbq dishes and the hainanese chicken are packed with additional notes of spice and seasoning.   

Value- A friend and I paid 4.99 for a steaming bowl of wonton noodle soup (6.99 to add some generous pieces of duck), 6.99 for a combination barbecue rice plate (seasoned rice, chinese greens, and freshly chopped roasted duck and fried pork belly) and 3 dollars for chinese broccoli coated with oyster sauce.  We had a smorgasbord of street eats before us that left us more than adequately stuffed for less than 15 bucks/person.

My favorite was when my dad would bring home roast duck though. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water..so succulent and meaty, dipped in a sweet soy sauce that I would drizzle over my rice. I've had authentic Peking duck from Beijing as well, and although delicious, it doesn't trump Cantonese roast duck for me.

We got a half order ($13.99) of roast duck, and I felt like there were more pieces with just skin and fat than there were meaty pieces. It was sitting in a pool of its oily juices, which they could have done a better job draining. The plum sauce (I think?) was thick and I preferred the sweet soy sauce variety. Overall, it satisfied my craving for roast duck, but it doesn't even come close to my dad's. We also got a side order of choy sum and gai lan with oyster sauce ($4.25 each), not knowing that our beef chow fun with gravy ($11.99) would come with a lot of bok choy. Gai lan stalks were still crunchy.

Main reason for the 2 stars is the service. My friend's boyfriend politely asked one of the guys what the difference (implying portion-wise) was between $7.99 roast duck and the half order of it. ""One is more expensive, $13.99, one is cheaper $7.99, so more expensive one has more. So simple!"" The way he said ""so simple"" screamed ""are you stupid?"" and I immediately felt bad as I was the one who dragged them here..especially when the same guy explained something nicely to another Chinese lady right after. I know FOB Chinese people are usually very blunt, but he could've handled it soooo much better. Plus you have to flag them down for everything, and no one refilled our teapot even though we left it open on the edge of our table.

The restaurant is pretty small and a server was talking to the cashier when I walked in. The cashier did not even look at me and continued to look through some papers. When I told her I wanted to order to go she waved over to a server to take my order. I noticed that prices have gone up about $2-3 for the combo plates.

My order came out fairly quickly. There were 7 wontons in my soup which were good, but I felt that it was overpriced. The broth wasn't anything special, it seemed like regular chicken broth to me. I would recommend the wonton noodle soup over the wonton soup, I think they're the same price.

My friends and I ordered crispy noodle, two plates of fried noodles and BBQ pork/Crispy pork. I thought the combination pick two or three was on the pricier side compare to other similar restaurant.But everything else in combine is still pretty cheap especially when you're eating in Vegas.

Crispy pork def did not disappoint me. The skin was nicely roasted, crispy and flavorful. Meat isn't dry at all! Pair with the crispy pork sauce. It fulfilled my taste bud for the month. I regret not to pack some back home.

We went there on a Sunday afternoon and the restaurant wasn't even that busy, in fact I had the largest party (of 7) when I arrived. The server automatically brought out waters but took a couple of minutes for the menu to get to me after he was ready to take my order and realized I didn't have one. 


I ordered the whole duck which came to my table room temperature, it wasn't even hot to enjoy that parts of the duck that contained a high portion of fat was too fatty to bite into. 
The Shrimp & Combination Fried Rice wasn't too bad but wasn't the best either. The ratio of noodle to veggies/seafood for their pan fried noodle wasn't well proportioned (lacked so much noodles) and finally when I ordered the pigs ear in soy sauce & the spicy chicken feet, it would've been nice to be told that these were cold appetizers. 

My server was too busy catering to the other customers who were Chinese unlike me & my party who were not. Even to get a water refill was almost impossible. I can guarantee you that this is definitely the first & LAST time I'll be ever eating here & I work for the hotel industry so I can assure you that I will spread the word to my friends that this place is by far a horrible choice to make!

The skin is perfectly crunch, but not so thick that you chip a tooth (my dad did that once, not cool).  The pork is also seasoned with the same or similar spices as the duck.

I tried this place last weekend and got the BBQ 3 Combo Platter, which is a plate of 3 meats of your choice.  Just an FYI, it's only the meat, if you want rice or anything it'll have to be ordered on the side.  For my meat I chose the chicken, duck, and roasted pork belly.  I originally wanted the bbq pork but at the time it wasn't going to be available for another 2 hours.  Out of the 3 meats that I chose, the roasted pork belly stood out the most.  The skin was nice and crispy, and the meat was nice and tender.  The combination of both textures just made it taste so good.  On the side they give you dipping sauces based on whichever meat you choose.  My girlfriend got the wonton noodle soup, which was decent.  There was nothing special about it.

Service is OK, you can expect the same type of service as any other asian restaurant.  Parking is plentiful except when it is later in the afternoon, that's when the neighboring restaurants get most of their customers.

I'm not a huge duck person, to be honest, but it's so crispy, tasty, and delicious here... you just have to try it.  As you can see, I'm a huge fan.  Go here, you'll like it. A lot!

Parking: There is a good sized lot in the plaza they are located in, however, there is no guarantee that everyone parked politely. Let's just assume the dbag that took up 2 spaces was in some sort of roasted pork emergency.

Better late than never,right? After an afternoon of ingredient shopping for Panang Curry across the street at 168 Market, I was tired, hot, and hungry. Rather than just grab something at the 168 Deli, I wanted to try a different spot.

I pulled up the Yelp App on my phone and Asian BBQ was one of the choices and was just across the street. I've never been there, and heard nothing but good things from Yelpers. I saw the first picture and looked no further. I said to myself ""Self, that's what I want, and that's what I'm gonna get!""

It looks like nothing from the outside but when you enter, this place is packed with people getting their grub on. Right away, I order the 2 choice BBQ Plate Special ($7.99) of their Roast Duck and Roast Pork. As I peruse the menu, I see Hainan Chicken, and I contemplate on getting a third choice($10.99) The lady taking my order starts giggling because she can see my ""eyes getting bigger than my stomach"" look, and at the same time, I hear R. Kelly...R. KELLY!?!? Yes, R.Kelly, and he's singing (as in the Bump and Grind intro) ""Your mind's telling you NOOOOOO.......But your stomach, your stomach's telling you YESSSSSSSS!""(Its a BIG sign of hunger when you start hearing things!) I block it all out and stick to my order, and I'm so glad I did because their take out portions are HUMANGOUS!

I get in my car, and it smells SO GOOD, I gotta just have one bite...which turned into another bite, and another one,  and another one! I finally pulled myself together,  turned up the A/C and headed home.  The duck was very juicy and that liquid Elixir of duck love that they pour over the duck and rice is pretty bomb. The pork was crispy with just enough fat and tasty meat too. I ate half the plate for lunch and the rest for dinner.

Can't wait to come back and try their noodle selections which they also have many choices for! Fast, cheap, and delicious, seriously one of the best deals in town.   ALOHA!!!

Yeah, it's cash only - so what? Yeah, it's tiny, generally packed, and utilitarian. Yeah, the servers' English isn't all that great. But what you really need to understand is that this restaurant isn't the least bit tailored for Americans or their tastes. They have their niche, they have their customers, and it's not down on Spring Mountain where the tourists generally go, so you're not going to get anything remotely approaching a tourist experience when you go there. It's not what this restaurant exists for.

I generally get BBQ pork over rice for carry-out. My wife, who worked in Hong Kong for many years, generally gets roast duck over rice, and swears it's the best she's had in the States. But with her in Asia this week, guiding her mother and father over here for an extended visit, I've been dining in the restaurant for a change. Sauteed vegetables with beef over rice? First-rate. Singapore noodles? Absolutely delicious. So what's it going to be tonight? BBQ pork chow fun? One of their noodle soups with numerous add-ins to choose from? Could be, could be.  But the beef with black bean sauce chow fun is delicious and the XO sauce rice rolls are great, as is practically everything else we've had there in the 8 or 9 years we've been going there. It's fine if you don't like it - they're not going to miss you if you blow them off for whatever reason.

Certain tourists seem to think that LV is a big adult theme park, where everything should be up to THEIR standards. Uh-uh, not here; this is an extremely popular hole-in-the-wall that happens to make first-rate everyday food tailored primarily for Cantonese and northern Vietnamese tastes, and that's IT. And having worked as an expat in HK for several years after living right next to San Francisco Chinatown, I prefer to eat at Tung Ky than at any other Chinese joint in the neighborhood.

I decided to  eat on a Friday and there were about 20 people waiting to be seated.  You can put your own name on the list  just inside the door and I waited outside with others.  Several people outside asked if I had eaten there before and they also heard the food was good.  The wait was over 40 minutes and I was given a table against the wall which also served as a storage area for napkins, chopsticks, and condiments.  The place was packed and loud.  I had to complain that no one had taken my order as I observed others that came in after I did, being waited on.  I ordered the duck/BBQ combo plate.  I was told no more BBQ and the server suggested something she thought was good so I had duck/whatever.  I was given my drink and waited for what I thought was longer than I should have waited and I was brought a large  mound of  rice, which was good.  The duck was good but barely warm.  I'm not sure how duck supposed to be served but it was good.  The second item (pork?) was about room temperature and left no memorial impression.  I would not go through what I went through to eat there again.  The restaurant was packed with many Asian people so I have to think that the quality of food must be  what people are coming in for.

The place:  small and not comfortable. The table is small. We ordered four dishes for 4 people and there was not enough room on the table. I would not bring my date here to this little place.

Food: this is basically a BBQ noddle place, nothing fancy. If you are looking for BBQ and noodle place, you are in the right place. BBQ items are not bad but not much better than the other places. Ordered Chow Mein. They used the thick noodles and they were fried and not pan fried to save time. 

Price: It is expensive. They are basically serving dinner menu all day. They don't have a lunch menu. Chow fun and average $12, probably the most expensive in town for a little place during lunch time. You can go to most Chinese restaurant to order chow fun on the dinner menu and they are around $9-10 max. It is more expensive than Ping Peng Pong in the Gold cost Casino. The portion is dinner portion. If you walk across the street to Hong Kong Garden (3407 S. Jones), the same dish on their lunch menu is only $5.99, exactly half and the quality is about the same, Their dinner price is only $8.99, much cheaper for comparable items. For lunch, I may not want to spend $12 for a Chow Fun dish in this place. 

Service: It is OK because my friend is a regular customer here and he tips good.

Overall, this place has quality food, but not really better than other restaurants in town. The place is small and seating is not comfortable. The worst part is the price. It is expensive compared to most of the oter other restaurant for whatever limited items they are serving. This place is overrated IMO. 

I would not return unless someone else is inviting me. I live in town and I have tried most of the Cantonese restaurants. There are better place with much better dinning environment and much cheaper with comparable quality food. Don't bring you date here.

What I ate:
- BBQ Pork: Super tender and tasty
- BBQ crispy pork belly: That crispy skin! OMG, so good
- BBQ roast duck: Really great! Crispy skin, fatty, juicy meat. 
- Wonton noodle soup: This is always a great standard if you're craving noodle soup. The broth is light
- Seafood chow mein: This is not your typical chow mein from your local chinese joint. The seafood is all super fresh, tender, not overcooked. I'm usually not a fan of squid in most seafood dishes because they tend to overcook it and make it rubbery. But this place knows what it's doing. Everything is cooked to perfection and the skinny chow mein is great
- Chinese broccoli with oyster sauce: Get some green in you! Cooked to perfection 

Pros:
- All the food I've had here has been cooked to perfection. Like superb each and every time. That type of consistency just can't be beat! This is why I keep coming back!
- Price is right. I think on average it's about $15/person? Maybe $20 if you get greedy. 
- Service is actually really good for an Asian restaurant. Everyone is friendly
- Food comes out fairly quickly

Cons:
- That wait! Coming at peak times can mean a wait, so be prepared. My friends came in for a really late lunch at 3pm on a Sunday, and that's been the only time there was absolutely no wait. If the wait is too long, just order to go!
- Fairly small. Nearly all the tables are 4tops. A few 2tops, and a few tables could be squished together to make 6tops. So try not to bring your nine foodie friends
- What kind of restaurant stay closed on Fridays?! Apparently this place is just doing so well they don't need to. So, just be aware of their business hours

If you're coming here for the first time with a group, I'd recommend getting the BBQ 3 Combo Platter with Roast Pork, BBQ Pork, and Duck. It's a great way to sample three of their amazing meats. If you're not a fan of pork, the Soy Sauce Chicken is very good too. My favorite fried rice here is the Chicken and Salty Fish and you can't go wrong with their Wonton Noodle Soup.

Something to keep in mind is that they are CASH ONLY, so plan for that. Also sometimes if you eat in, the service can be kinda meh. I don't speak any Chinese but sometimes I have a pleasant experience and other times it's hard to get anyone's attention, but honestly this place is a great hole in the wall and I come here for amazing food, so the service doesn't really phase me. Another thing to note is that they're a fantastic option for takeout. I always see them get tons of takeout orders when I eat there and I also call in to pickup orders here when I just feel like having some BBQ and rice at home. 

The best takeout options in my opinion are the BBQ on Rice options on the menu (items #1-8) and also the Wonton Noodle Soup. They are such a great value, with the BBQ on Rice items being $7.50 - $8.00 each and the soup being even cheaper than those. 

Last note: The restaurant itself is located in the corner of a very popular plaza with a handful of other restaurants such as Ramen Tatsu, District One, and Chubby Cattle, so parking here during prime hours can be difficult.",ETGRhvDSYHw-hoz2nA_ewQ,1,0,5,GRuretGOCJF7JSdP-l7toA

- Won Ton soup

We started going to this place when it first opened. ... I'm going to guess around five years ago.  Back then a  roast duck rice was 5 bucks.   Now that same dish is 8 bucks.  Quite an increase!!!  .. But so good!!!!

Their business is so good that they close on Fridays! !!! What restaurant can do that!!! 

I think the owner is the cashier lady.  We have been there probably 20 times and have never seen her smile.   Next time I go,  I will tell her that given how good her business is she should be smiling like the Joker!

Food. ..
Bbq pork- most of the time the meat is not to fatty.  Has great flavor and tender. 
Roast duck- about 50 percent of the time you will get a great combination of crisp skin,  minimal fat,  and wonderful tender duck.   The other times you will get too much fat and soggy skin.
Roast pork- same review as duck but I would say 75 percent of time it's crispy, minimal fat and delicious. 

Pan fried noodles- one of the best I have had.   It's not oily.  My guess is that they fry the noodles well ahead of time and drain the oil properly.  I would request this with a black been sauce.   Crisp noodles and delicious sauce.

All dishes are made fresh daily. They throw everything out that isn't eaten at the end of the night. 

There's so many yummy dishes here!! We always get the following: 

1. Roast Duck: BEST DUCK IN VEGAS!!! They run out of the duck quickly on busy days. The skin is crispy and fatty, the middle is juicy, tender and tasty! It's so good. You can eat it by itself or dip it in the sauce it comes with. You can get a whole duck to take home as well. 
2. Pork Belly: I've only had bad pork belly here once. Every other time it was tasty and on point. 
3. Combination fried rice: can't go wrong w/ any of the fried rice dishes here. 
4. Snow pea leaves vegetable
5. Steamed chicken 

Everything is fairly cheap here. You can easily enjoy a hearty meal for $15 or less depending on what you order. Of course, all larger dishes are big enough to share family style. 

The service is always good when I go w/ my mom or husband (both speak fluent Vietnamese or Cantonese). However, when it's just me there was a bit of a language barrier so they had a hard time understanding some of the questions I had about the dishes. I recommend reading the menu and naming the numbered item you want. The Food always comes out hot and fresh. 

The place gets busy for lunch and dinner. You'll be seated faster w/ a smaller group (2 people). Anything larger may mean you have to wait a bit. 

Overall, I love this place! Highly recommend if you want fast, yummy, authentic Chinese food  

Happy Dining,

The restaurant was packed at 11 AM with a line of people waiting for their to go orders. Noticed the hanging pork belly was midway through and knew it was a sign. 

For people ordering to-go, head straight to the counter and place your order with the cashier. If you're hungry, order the one option with rice/noodle. If you have a bigger than typical appetite or want to have leftovers for later, get the two options with rice/noodle. Either options come with a small portion of Chinese broccoli.

The crispy pork belly had perfectly crispy skin with tender pieces of meat underneath. Easily one of the best I've ever had. While the roasted duck was just your average duck, the bbq pork stood out to be one of the better ones. It was not overly sweet nor smothered in sauce and while it had relatively no fat, it was still tender.

Quite a bit of cash, drivers license, and and a few credit cards. Came back this am before they opened to hopefully retrieve it to be met with hostile employees and their ""boss"" (2 different chefs claim to be the owner) telling me that it wasn't there without checking. When I asked for them to check the cameras that were directly facing our table, they kept telling me no and making excuses saying it would take too much time. After pleading with them once again to just let me take a look, I knew the exact time we were there and it would have taken 15 min tops to check, they started threatening to call the police. My Chinese isn't that good but I figured it would be easier to communicate with them in Chinese than English and the ""boss"" started yelling at me that I was accusing them of stealing when I was just trying to explain that I wanted to see what happened to my purse. I may have used the wrong Chinese term and there was a miscommunication, but when I tried to explain that to him he got even more mad and started yelling at me more about how they are too busy (there were 3 tables of people and 10 employees who were mostly standing around) and to leave. 

What probably happened was one of the employees found it and kept the cash and the purse and they are covering for them. There's a luxury good resale store next door so I'm almost positive I'll see my Purse there the next day. 

I've already filed a police report so hopefully they are able to do something before the ""boss"" erases the footage which he probably did the moment I left the restaurant. 

I seriously don't understand how someone, let alone a whole restaurant, can be that shady and crooked and get away with it.

My order: duck plate, likely cut by a blind butcher... Lots of spitting and cursing. They were cheaply cut like inverted and twisted pork ribs-from a professional wrestler named wilbur-but had great flavor. Too much rice.

When the question, ""where is good Chinese food in Vegas?"" Came up.. I had no idea where to go. I've had this place book marked for years and never went until tonight. There's a million run of the mill places but only a handful of gems.

This place is like a production line in the best way possible. Quick, polite, fresh, affordable, and satisfying. Come here for Chinese BBQ duck, pork, and pork belly. Served over rice, with noodles, or in soup. They do have a bunch of soups, pan fried noodles, and noodle soups. There are banners claiming it's the eight top Chinese restaurant in the entire USA- kind of cool!

I ordered the two meat combo served with white rice, shared an order of duck, and shared an order of crispy pan fried beef noodles with gravy. Everything was delicious. I particularly liked the bbq pork. It was melt in your mouth delicious. The pork belly was also really good with the dark dipping sauce. The white rice had a splash of meat drippings on it and really made the plate of food special. They served a complimentary soup that I liked. It was a nice start to the fatty dishes. The pan fried noodles were okay- kind of small portion of protein.

The BBQ'd meats were really good and each stood out in their own way. I was initially put off by the staff's lack of urgency with getting our order as opposed to diners who sat after us. There was a gentleman who sat after us, got soup, and got his entree before we even got water or placed an order. I'm glad the lady who came up to us did when she did because she was very sweet and helped us decide what to order. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt this time..

It ended up being a solid four as the food and sweet lady out weighed the bad. I really liked my dinner. I can't wait to go back and kind of fell in love with the hustle and bustle of this little BBQ joint.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,4,4,4,rFrxMF_xKK3IsbYVf-QWtA

I actually stopped by a couple of months ago in the middle of lunch hour, and it was so crowded (even for to-go ordering) that we just couldn't stand to wait. I'm so glad that I finally made the time to come back.

You'll find a lot of awesome entrees in English, Chinese, and Vietnamese (some of the employees speak it, actually) on the menu. Noodle soups, congee, chow mein, and fried rice options abound. Large trays of meats are available for advance order. There's even various pig parts to order if you're into that kind of thing.

However, for my first attempt, I had to go for the ""BBQ 2 Combination With Rice"" for $6.99. I had the roasted pork belly (aka crispy pork) and the roasted duck as my options, and I have no regrets. These two meats actually bring back childhood memories from when my parents used to order trays of them from a local butcher and we'd enjoy them at home with some rice that we'd cooked.

Every table in the restaurant was taken - go figure - so I got my order in a to-go box. Instant nostalgia with the pork and duck laid on a bed of rice, plus a healthy side of Chinese cabbage. I just had the time of my life sitting in my car eating these delights. The pork was chopped into very manageable rectangular portions, each with perfectly crunchy skin, a layer of white, and a layer of dark meat. The duck pieces had lovely golden brown skin and a very anise-y seasoning on the bottom. Make sure to expect bones if you order the roasted duck, and you'll just have to kinda slice or bite them off to get to the meat.

Ordered the roast pork belly with rice and the combo bbq, roast pork belly & duck. Served with a big mound of rice, Chinese greens and some pickled carrot and daikon strips. The pork belly tasted nice, and there was a pleasant dipping sauce, but the skin was so hard it was difficult to chew.  Really enjoy a bit of crackling, so this was a real bummer.

So this little place was little....

What I got
Chinese sausage and salt fish fried rice - it was good. A little bit too dark for me (too much dark soy). Sausage pieces were a little bit too tiny... 
Seafood pan fried noodle - was good. Good amount of seafood variety. And the noodles were crispy and nicely pan fried
3 plate combo (double duck and bbq pork) - duck was on the salty end for me. The bbq pork was good! I wish it was a bit warmer
2 plate combo bbq (pork and bbq ribs) - WE GOT A SECOND PLATE CAUSE THEY HAD ROAST PORK! We thought the pork was done for the day but they brought out some so we HAD to get it! And it was worth it. Not too fatty and not too lean. Almost like a 5 layer... ha. Wish it was a bit more warmer. 
Garlic veggies - was good. Always love me more veggies! 

Environment
This place was small! Like it gets busy! It's on a strip plaza, parking can be crazy during busy hours which is around 6-8p, that's when we went at least. 

Niceness 
It may be the busy-ness that they didn't have time to entertain new comers..... there is menu but really they don't have time to entertain questions. You just have to know what you want. Once you have that down, they are great! 

Dollar $
Relatively cheap compared to Orlando at least. OH AND IT IS CASH ONLY PLEASE

Yes?
Yea I would definitely go again! Would try the noodles! Seems like it's a street side cart style noodle place where you can pick and chose! Should be interesting!

The most popular dish ordered by non-chinese is the #7 BBQ 2 combo with rice. It comes with peking duck and crispy pork belly that has been deliciously flavored with Chinese five spice powder. Also included is a side of bright green steamed Chinese broccoli. It all sits atop plain white rice that has nicely absorbed the marinade of the duck and pork. It's a complete meal, with your protein, carb and veggie for $7.99. 

The pork belly is something to talk about. It has an excellent balance of crunchy skin and moist meat. There are great flavors here with the salty, briny meat and hint of anise which is strong but not overpowering. The duck was the usual and not much to talk about there. 

Cash only. Crowded.

The staff who have excellent command of the English language are really friendly, welcoming and approachable. The ones with minimal English are not so friendly and in American terms could be considered to be downright rude. It all is to be taken with a grain of salt. I attribute their rudeness to their inability to communicate. The super friendly demeanor of the English speaking associates help make up for their non-English speaking counterparts.

Although it hasn't happened to us before, we've been warned that some times they may run out on roast duck and roast pork (GASP I KNOW THE HORROR!) so I'd advise to call ahead if you're worried about missing out of bbq heaven. 

Each bite of roast pork is actually the perfect combination of crispy skin + juicy meat + guilty pleasure of fat. The roast duck is also such a winner of marinated deliciousness. We always order a side of plain, wonton noodles, dried style to complement the sauciness of the roast duck.

Service here has always been questionable but they would at least get the order correct and the BBQ meats were generally good.

This day, it was horrible.

We ordered Wonton Noodle Soup, Congee and added a 3 meat combo with BBQ Pork, Roast Pork and Ginger Chicken.

After a little while, the Congee and Noodle soup came out.  The meats didn't show up until the Congee and Noodle soup was almost finished.

To make it worse, they gave us Duck instead of the BBQ Pork.

After trying to grab a server for a few minutes, we gave up and decided to just eat what was served.

The Ginger Chicken was anemic, compared to past meals, and the Roasted Duck just tasted off and mushy.  The Roasted Pork was good.

We ate, left most of the Chicken and Duck, paid and walked out.

On the way out, one of the servers was cleaning something up and put a ""wet floor"" sign on the ground.

Walked around the sign and before you know it, foot slipped and fell hard.  It wasn't water.  They spilled oil or grease on the ground and didn't bother covering it up.

These people are generally clueless, rude and generally act like they don't care.

But ... still came back for their BBQ meats.

My favorite is the roast duck and wonton noodle soup. Great portion for the price and generous with noodles (very important). You have your choice between several different types of noodles. I've tried the egg and the ramen, both tasty. If you don't want to spend $, you can get a wonton noodle soup for just $3.99 and the portion is perfect. You'd be surprised how much food they give you for such a price! My friends ordered the pork belly with rice and it was incredible.

Personally small, cluttered restaurants (spaces in general) are not my thing, so I was a little skeptical. They first put my family of 5 at at a small table that originally fit 4 people, but one wait or eventually moved us.

Service was decent, and actually not so bad. I was happy to see that one of the waiters laughed at a joke my sister cracked (which wasn't funny at all in my opinion) demonstrating that they're not actually bad waiters. One of our other waiters was very confused, and gave us ice instead of rice. Even though she was very confused, she still was very patient with our family. 

The reason I gave the restaurant a five because the food was DELICIOUS! I'm not a fan of Chinese food because of the abundant amount of MSG/oil; however, this place was absolutely my favorite Chinese food restaurant. We ordered the roasted pork with rice, congee, mi xao don, and seafood chow foon. 

If you're looking for good Chinese food, and don't mind the small, cluttered space than I highly recommend this place! It definitely owns up to its title of being 8th out of 100 Chinese food restaurants in the USA!

The meat was also just okay, the smell was overwhelming in my car and fridge, yet the meat was a little bland.

You can find your favorite Chinese stir-fries and bbq in here while you admire their unique taste of wallpaper. (You'll understand when you go there) They offer your favorite noodles and meats and are all available to go. They also have a steam table where you can order ala cart items per pound. 

The service is very Chinesey: very quick, do not look for super hospitable servers because you're looking in the wrong place. Depending on the type of food you order, the time it takes for it to come out may vary. Stir-Fried dishes take the longest, while BBQ rice places are the quickest. 

About the food: After spending about a year trying to find my Cantonese favorites in LV, I think this is my go-to. The barbecue is not the best I've ever had, but its good enough to remind me of authentic Cantonese BBQ. The stir-fried noodles are executed well, and they have the Asian-ey vegetables that I look for when I go out to eat Chinese (Pea Sprouts, Mustard Greens, Baby Bok Choys, etc etc...) I included a picture of their homemade hotsauce, which i wish i can just 'take' every time. The flavor of their sauce reminds me of a hot and spicy hotpot: super fragrant, super depth in terms of spices, and numbing peppercorns!

Recommended Foods:
""Kuai-Fei"" Chicken - poached whole chicken served with Ginger/Scallion sauce
Stir-Fried noodles - Chow fun, crispy noodles
BBQ Duck, Cha-Siu, Roasted Belly (salty though)
Asian vegetables
Curried Tendon (super small portions though)
Hot Sauce

Reasons why it didn't get the 5th star:
Quite expensive for Chinese BBQ while not delivering top quality

You want the fresh bbq meats (duck, roast pork, pork grind) come here.  They have hands down the best ""hanging meat"" in town.  It's cash only so don't be shock.  I would not come here on Friday since they are close.  The food here is nicely portioned and they are amazing.  I had the rice soup (congee) - seafood with the bread and it's the bomb! Best hangover soup.  I also tried the wonton with egg noodle.  Both are amazing meals.  Like I said I would order the duck or the pork here to take home and eat with rice.  Solid place.  Also, this place gets really super busy! It's on S Jones close to Spring Mountain.  I seriously love this place.  I enjoyed every minute of coming here even when the waiters are somewhat rude.

We were seated and had our order taken. Ten minutes pass and people who were seated after us started to get their food. Our server comes by and asks us to confirm what noodle dish we ordered. We told him and continued to wait, another ten minutes pass by.  A couple who had just been seated got what appeared to be a free bowl of soup and their food quickly. Finally a different server comes by and asks us to confirm what BBQ dish we ordered. We just decided to leave after waiting so long and seeing half the tables empty and people coming in and getting their food within a few minutes. 

The food however is good, even though it's gotten more expensive over the past couple years. The roasted pork belly is probably the best in the city and the BBQ pork is solid. The duck is just mediocre though as it isn't very meaty. Overall for Chinese BBQ, I'd rather go across the street to Hong Kong Garden Seafood & BBQ Cafe.

4814674,2012-12-21,0,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"I love this place! This place has one of the most authentic hong kong style cuisines in terms of the noodles. It is one of the secrets of Chinatown area until recently when more and more people are coming. It has been voted 8th in the top 100 Chinese foods list.
My family comes here all the time due to its authenticity in terms of taste and cost.
First, the cost for the food is cheap compared to other places and there is a variety of things to try from roasted duck, roasted pork, to noodles, to various toppings to add onto your noodle.
And they are closed one day of the week, I think it was Fridays that was written.
Second, the food comes really fast after ordering. This place is always crowded around lunch time and you will have to wait if there are no seats. The place is pretty small compared to many other restaurants in terms of space and seating.
Third, the food is always flavorful. Though I had a couple times where the topping I wanted ""Pork Blood"" was sold out. All the toppings are always cooked really well.
The main thing to try at this place is the noodles + toppings.
You have a choice between the type of noodle you want.
I usually chose udon due to my taste for a more chewier noodle.
And then you can choose whether you want one, two, or three toppings to add into the soup/noodle.
The toppings range from pork blood, pork belly, curry fish balls, fish balls, tofu, and etc.
Also, there is a lot of different mixes that they are willing to accommodate if you ask. For instance, you can order a won ton soup and still add in different toppings if you wanted to. 
However, if your taste buds are not so interested in the toppings you can add into your noodle, there is always duck and chicken to try. It is always fresh and flavorful. The butcher always cuts the meat really clean so when you get the product, you don't have to go trying to pull the pieces apart. In addition, he is very delicate with the food (which also means patience) if you are looking to do take-out. But the duck and chicken are a lot better than other Chinese places I've eaten at.

4848227,2015-08-14,0,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"If you are in the mood for roast duck or wonton noodle soup or Chinese style BBQ pork, you should visit AB&N. Because of the high turnover, their roast duck and BBQ pork are usually very fresh and juicy. The price for noodle soup is very reasonable too.

Now for some reason, I don't like any of their chicken dishes. The portion is usually too small and there isn't much meat attached to the bones. On the other hand, I think they have the best crispy pan fried noodle in Vegas.

Now for some bad news. If you order noodle soup to go, they always give you a small styrofoam cup of soup, which is not enough to fill up the noodle. I always have to add half can of chicken broth to fully cover the noodle. Second, I'm suspecting that some of the ingredients they put in their soup and sauce might not be healthy if you consume their food regularly. My co-workers used to eat at this place weekly and we would get stomach ache if we ate more than once a week. As for the crispy pan fried noodle, the sauce smelled really funky and strange if you reheat it my the microwave.

By the way, they don't accept credit card, so remember to stop by the ATM on the way here.

Overall, I still come to AB&N when I'm craving for roast duck noodle soup or roast pork, but I try to go here no more  than once a month.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,1,0,3,qBCujm3AM4XERjF3ux1SkQ

When another waiter brought it to our table, I pointed out that we ordered the combo with beef, chicken and shrimp and that perhaps this was for another table.  He said that it was ours and that it was noted on the order.  We ate it since it was already prepared and I wasn't sure what they'd do to our new order in the kitchen if they had to redo it.

The BBQ plate of roast duck and roast pork was ok, but not as good as we've remembered.  The duck wasn't as flavorful and the skin on the pork wasn't crispy.

1. Wonton noodle soup has a savory soup. Wonton has meat and shrimps. The noodles are perfectly cooked. Not too soft and not hard. 
2. We always get the meat combo. Which includes three choices of meat. Duck, pork belly, xa xui, or chicken hainam with ginger. Al these meat is a must to try! Do not skip it. 
3. Friend rice is also good. Plate is very big it can feed up to three people. 
4. Crunchy or soft chowmein I a good option if you decided to order this dish. It is covered in vegetables and meat. I have to say the sauce is kind of salty so you can ask it little or on the side 
5. Fish balls dipped in curry sauce. The curry sauce has a little spicy kick to it. So if you don't like spicy or curry, just eat the fish ball by itself. It'll still be good. 
6. Chinese donuts are fresh everyday. Big and fluffy. We usually eat with our wonton soup. Sup it like bread.

A few minutes later steaming bowls filled with chewy, thin egg noodles and flavorful broth arrive, a generous portion of well braised beef brisket, soft gelatinous tendons, earth tripe, chewy pig ears, airy fish balls, shrimp filled won tons and flavorful mushrooms weighing everything down.

Chopsticks in hand we all dig in.  My Midwest bud, holding his fork, looking like someone stole Christmas exclaims ""why couldn't we eat that"", pointing at the table with a plate of roast pork.

The waitress answers for us ""You eat first.  Good for you.  I bring after you finish"".  

To his credit he made it through the noodles and devoured the Chinese BBQ that followed.  Were talking a succulent roast duck with very little subcutaneous fat, the juicy meat permeated by star anise and bathed in its own juices and puréed innards; moist, salty roast pork with a golden, blistered crisp crackling skin, and a deeply flavored char siu, moist, some burnt bits for bitterness, sweet with a delicate fermented aftertaste.

Sure, the roast pork and char siu was a little lean but  this is health conscious 2013.

Very inexpensive noodles and rice plates (roasted meats, duck, chicken over rice with choy sum).  BBQ items sold by the pound, roast duck by the whole or half.

We came on a Sunday morning and thankfully didn't have to wait but if you're going during lunch time, make sure you get there a bit earlier because the parking lot and the line could get very busy.

BBQ 3 COMBO PLATTER ($17.99) - their roasted belly pork was SO crispy and now I know why they're known for that. It actually surprised me how crispy it was and the person sitting next to me could hear the crunch. This is a must-get when you're here, whether you're getting a combo platter or the roasted pork by itself. The BBQ pork was thinly cut, different from the kind that I usually see which is a bit thicker. Their roasted duck was good as well. They give a sweeter sauce for the roasted duck and another that I think was just hoisin sauce.

PAN FRIED NOODLES WITH BEEF ($11.99) - I was craving pan fried noodles so I was really excited about this. I thought it was okay; the noodles were crispy and had a decent amount of beef in it. It wasn't anything too special but still solid.

SHRIMP DUMPLING NOODLE SOUP ($7.99) - the shrimp dumplings were very tasty! I put a little bit of hot sauce in there and it just brought out the flavors even more. 

This place is not too far off the strip if you have a car so it's a nice place to go to when you're leaving Vegas. I definitely want to come back here when I go to Vegas again.",_jqTa-3-fqmBxnkANJHtFw,3,1,4,KDvbqlpZQB7euNOrSY8vng

When we arrived, we discovered that we went to the 8th best Chinese restaurant in America (for 2011)!   Really?  That is what their signs stated.  They had signs everywhere saying they were #8.   Between the Yelp reviews and the their award for being the #8 Chinese restaurant in the USA, we couldn't be wrong.   

The owner of the restaurant is a genius for jumping on the pork belly bandwagon.  This is the only place that I have seen that hangs roasted pork belly instead of a whole pig.  Is it the best that I have had?  No.  But, it was good.   We also tried their duck.  Their roast duck was had a good flavor, but, did not have much meat on it.  

Their noodle soups and lo mein (dry noodles) were good.  The soup was decent.  Their lo mein which comes with a special sauce, and costs $1 more than the soup noodles.  Wontons were good.  The only complaint I have is that they do not give enough noodles.  Even my 8 year old daughter finished a bowl of noodles all by herself.  She normally is a very small eater.  

Overall, this is a pretty good Chinese restaurant.  Yelpers were not wrong with this one.  When I go to Vegas again, I need to come back to this place.  

Edit 4/12/13

Asian BBQ & Noodle is better than the Chinese BBQ and won ton noodle joints in the East San Gabriel Valley.  They beat the Rowland Heights Sam Woo.  Not sure how they compare to the same type of restaurants in Alhambra and Monterey Park.  It might be better than #8.  After comparing it to some of my local restaurants, I am going to upgrade them to 4 1/2 stars.",JwngfNrDD3hCWKStBOACRA,0,0,4,5jjUO8SFSPXhn53DCcNe-w

So I am a little late to the game, just finding out about Asian BBQ and Noodles recently...but better late than never!

Came here with Grandpa, so I decided it would be a great time to try a BBQ combination platter! We chose the Roasted Pork Belly, Roasted Duck, and BBQ Pork. Pork Belly was good, tender and flavorful with a very crispy skin. The Roast Duck was outstanding! Very juicy, flavorful and not gamey at all. The BBQ Pork was the highlight for me...great smokey BBQ taste, beautiful smoke rings and lots and lots of flavor! I'd say the Roasted Duck and the BBQ Pork are the best I've ran into so far!

Also tried the Chinese Broccoli with Oyster Sauce. Good stuff! Came out piping hot, fresh, and yummy...good distraction from all the meat and rice 

This was too much food for two people! And the prices are very reasonable, with rice bowls starting at $6.50 with choice of BBQ meat!  All of this cost less than a $20 bill for two people.  Just remember, cash only!

GIven that the primary headliners here (BBQ and Noodles) aren't my routine diet, it has taken me quite some time to venture here. However, I am glad that I did because it's a little Vegas gem. 

As long as you are not sensitive to neon green and yellow walls, the interior is downright cozy and definitely clean. It feels like a true Chinatown immersion. If you don't speak Chinese or aren't familiar with the offerings, ordering might be a tad intimidating, but we had a super friendly waitress who tried her best to decipher what we wanted. She did a good job, except for the noodle dish. Somehow we ended up with a pile of plain, albeit very long, noodles and a pair of scissors.  

The real star here is the pork with its perfect combination of buttery, succulent fat and magically crispy rind. You order this meat candy by the pound. We also ordered the soy sauce chicken, and I confess, the skin creeps me out, but the flavor was delicious. My husband couldn't stop raving about it. Nothing we tasted had the heavy five spice flavor, which is something I generally do not like. 

After a minor communication breakdown, we managed to order ong choy stir fried with garlic. It was rather greasy, but I couldn't stop eating it! The menu only lists vegetables with oyster sauce, so I am not sure how you unlock this vegetable version. After trying to explain what we wanted, our waitress came by with a plate of vegetables she was taking to another table, and we said, ""Yes, that!""

It was too hot for soups that day, but I definitely want to make it back to try their wonton.

I don't know either.  What I do know... I don't eat at an Asian restaurant for the service.  No, I go for the food.  I do not expect any service at all.  If anything, I expect to get terrible service.

Not to take anything away from the other BBQ offerings, but the duck was a total stand out.  And who would have thought the best duck would be in Vegas.  Impressive to say the least.

But I've seen many great places come and go in Las Vegas.  One spot that comes to mind, ""Shanghi Noon"" next to Pho Kim Long.  I miss that guy's noodles so much.  I wish I knew where he went because I am sure he's making noodles somewhere.

Located in the same plaza as Chada Thai as well as China Mama, and on my 'to-do' list since a few days after relocating to Sin City, it was finally on a Saturday evening that I met a friend at Asian BBQ & Noodle - the only two Caucasians to set foot in the place between the hours of 6:30 and 7:45pm proving to be a very good thing.

Tight yet tidy, with a Cash-Only policy that proves no issue as items trend far cheaper than one might expect when considering the quality and quantity of the food, it was at the last remaining table that the two of us squeezed in and navigating the concise menu it was to the amusement of us both that the waitress' eyebrows raised as preserved egg porridge was ordered, not to mention three additional plates.

Waiting mere moments for orders to be prepared, several to-go customers popping in and out as my friend sipped potent iced tea while I opted for water, it was first the aforementioned cauldron of congee that arrived and almost as if to award our ""adventurous"" order the creamy bowl of rice was absolutely chock-a-block full of both crispy pork and blackened egg, each bite a new adventure with baby bok choy, chives, scallions, and mushrooms also joining the mix.

Next brought the barbeque plate, a bountiful trio of meats with crispy belly pork outperforming supple flesh of barbeque and excessively bony duck, it was an interesting contrast to see the same fowl deboned in a steaming bowl of soup fare much better, the skin softened only slightly by broth while long-style noodles were springy and plethoric, a half-dozen tender dumplings fully packed with nicely seasoned shrimp.

Well aware that we had over-ordered, but happy that my friend would have a couple meals the following day at a grand tally of $60 inclusive of tax and tip, it was with a substantial plate of dry noodles that the meal would end, and although the seafood was undoubtedly frozen and rather par for the course, it was the melange of mushrooms that helped to prop up the plate, each featuring a distinct earthy flavor that worked in concert with the vegetables and gravy to offer a flavor both savory and a touch sweet, a nice compliment to the otherwise rich dishes more rich with fatty cuts of meat.

A bit disappointed by the duck and seafood, though universally impressed by the pork, portions, and price there is little question as  to why Asian BBQ & Noodles remains a local favorite, the frequency of return limited only by a somewhat limited menu and several more Chinatown spots to explore.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,16,17,4,qqkk8bTYEKdwwB5EHzWmtA

Everybody who was eating here were Chinese and some Vietnamese.  The servers were speaking to me and my sister in Chinese and it felt like Beijing all over again.  It's a tiny place that seats 50 people.

We ordered roast pork, yang chow fried rice and Chinese broccoli since we weren't too hungry.  The traditional Chinese restaurant would serve you dishes one at a time and it's usually the quickest one to prepare is the one that gets served first.  So, we got the broccoli then the roast pork.  We were dying to eat the pork already since the skin looked so crispy and delicious...but we had to control ourselves and wait for the rice.  It didn't take long.  The broccoli was fresh.   The pork was super crispy and succulent - honestly, the best pork from a Chinese restaurant in Vegas!  I was very pleased and all I could say to myself was ""HAOCHI! HAOCHI!"" (delicious).  The fried rice had a lot of stuff in it: chopped green veggies, eggs, BBQ pork and shrimps.  

We took a BBQ pork rice bowl to-go.  I tried a piece and it was delish!  Their food is inexpensive too!  It's like $6-7 for a rice bowl and you get a lot of food.

If I was blown away by one dish, I can't wait to try the other items on their menu!  I'll definitely try their roast duck and something else next time.  Other Chinese restaurants in Vegas marginal roast pork. There's a particular place with a type of flower in their name that microwaves their roast pork making the skin gross and chewy.

It is pure chaos, noise (chatter) and movement all the time.  ""I Love it"". Chinese food with a show! 
3. Expect to be greeted and seated with a menu when they can get to you! 
4. Expect to be asked for your order 20sec after u have been seated. You have 10sec to respond with ur full order, or they will move on to the next customer. (Saw 2 different hostess do this)
5. Some of the best prices and menu options.
6. A non complex menu. It is what it is! With gravy or dry is all u need to know for your noodle dishes.
7. 5 star:  must tries
     The duck, so good.
     The soup, seafood dumpling with noodles. The broth was rich, salty. 
     4 Star:  delicious
     The crispy pork belly and BBQ pork rib combo. I personally did not try this (gave up pork products for lent) but trust the people I was having lunch with. That it was good.

     3 Star: good but not great .
      Combination crispy noodle. The noodles were off the hook. The gravy was good, that's it just good .

Noodle soups - f-ing great
Chow Fun - huge portions and also really good. I got it ""wet"" and it came with a lot of veges and meat
Wontons - plump and tasty
BBQ duck - not too fatty and good. 

They also have the fried bread but we didnt try it. It looked good though. Service sucked but then again, going to a cheap chinese restaurant and expecting good service is like interviewing Kanye West and expecting him to be modest...it rarely happens but when it does, it's pleasantly surprising. 

Definitely recommend coming here for a nice cheap meal off the strip.",LapuXd4UMgjP2yzJrAmJzw,1,2,5,S6JIgUOnKKAsYLrrLLPQlw

Their prices are awesome as well -- they're not going to burn a hole in your wallet however! It is CASH ONLY. So don't come here with a credit card cause that isn't going to help you. Although the wonderful thing is, there is a Wells Fargo, Chase, and BoA somewhere down the street of Spring Mountain. 

Like many people have said .. absolutely LOVE their roast pork. It is full of flavor and a good combination of meat and fat. It goes GREAT with rice! So don't be afraid to get that combo :P

Their roast duck and bbq pork is only okay though. I've had better bbq pork. As for their roast duck, it's good however their sauce ruins it for me. They left the herbs in the sauce and the concentration of the flavors of the herbs are just too much for me ..it ruins the flavor of the duck rather than complimenting it. 

Also, love their noodles and fried rice. I've tried their ""chei jai mein"" which is a street cart food back overseas. For here, you get to choose the type of noodle you want then choose 1-3 items, such as pork intestines and pork blood. It was quite yummy :D Wasn't bad at all. BUT, I typically like to use chili oil with my noodles however theirs isn't that great ... Next time, I'll bring my own! 

Awesome authentic Chinese food. Can't go wrong. Don't worry about the service cause for the food you get, to hell with service. It's a Chinese place ... just be loud when trying to get their attention and you're good to go! HAHA  But in all reality, when I've eaten here, I haven't really experienced any rude attitude  .. maybe because I haven't been here enough? Tehee.

We ordered the roasted pork plate and the beef chow mein. 2 items and it took nearly half an hour to receive our take out order, which is pretty bad considering the roasted pork plate only has to be chopped and put in a container with rice. As for the food itself - the roasted pork was really good. The meat was tender and juicy, though I would've liked the skin to be a bit crispier. The beef chow mein wasn't great. There were only a few thin pieces of beef in the dish and it was fairly bland and a little too greasy. Probably wouldn't order it again. 

The staff was just...meh. We kind of just stood in front of the cashier for a couple minutes until she finally acknowledged us and took our order.

5390880,2013-04-24,2,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"You know the main photo for this place?   This one:  http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/W56LwOPawkC-aXZfNPUIpQ/l.jpg   It's haunted my daydreams for months.   Could it look any tastier?  Every time I see it (or think it), I envision how good it must taste and have come close so many times to ordering it.

I know, you're wondering ""well why on earth didn't you?""   The answer is not an easy one.  Some combination of a lack of an official website/menu which can turn me off of a place a little, along with being tied to lunch partners who wouldn't have a desire to visit, along with some unknown fear that resided with me in trying it.   Well today I strapped on a ""No Fear"" t-shirt from 1995 (not really) and called in an order to make my dreams come true.

It was not easy.  I venture to say it was one of the more difficult phone ordering processes I've ever experienced.  It took a few minutes for me to convey I wanted the Roast Pork and Roast Duck combo over rice and an iced tea to go.  In fact, during the drive there I was certain it wouldn't be what I wanted, that my dreams would be crushed over a simple game of telephone.

When I showed up the entire restaurant was packed, and it made the telephone conversation difficulty a little more clear to me.  Seeing the ""Cash Only"" sign only amplified my fear that my order was wrong and that they would try to charge me for a full roast duck and pig and a side of rice, in which I would need to work off by washing dishes in the back for the rest of the afternoon.   To my pleasant surprise, once the cashier had a free second she rang me up and I was charged $6.99 (before tax) just as the photo told me.  After what seemed like an argument I was given my iced tea and on my way.

Back at the office I hurriedly opened my lunch to see what I had coveted all these months right in front of me.  No napkins or fork were provided (just a spoon(?) and some chopsticks (I know, those should suffice), but at this point I didn't care, all I needed was my mouth and my combo.   I was not opposed to shoveling it in with my bare hands if needed.  I procured my own fork and napkins and dug in.   It would almost be impossible to live up to my expectations, but it came very close.  The duck was tender and delicious, and the pork was very tasty but I found it to not be as moist as I expected.  The 10 lbs of rice and handful of pieces of Chinese broccoli were a good accompaniment.

I was tempted to go 5 stars as dream fulfillment ranks very high on my list of pluses for a business, but the service could have been a little friendlier and the pork a little more moist for it to be the perfect experience.",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,4,3,4,9tYrMwE8MVNToPd6Xx5Jyw
5411228,2013-02-27,5,aD0EslPREWGDlSpD0RMlEg,"I have to give it 5 stars for what it is and what I ate. My guy server really didn't understand me and in turn, I have no idea what he was ranting about. Something about fried rice, which I had no interest in at the time, something about a prime rib buffet, Honestly, I do not know, but we got the right food and it was on point!  

We originally were taking food to go. Our kind gentleman server informed us that the roasted duck was going to be another 20 minutes, my husband wanted that duck,  Bad! So we waited and ordered food to eat in, in the mean time.

 We ordered won ton soup with pork belly instead of duck, we also ordered pork ribs. and fish balls. Before the food got there, I realized we didn't not have enough cash for my husbands hunger and cravings. My husband orders food like he's on death row.  I proceeded to go to BOA , just down the road. (It's cash only) OK, so by the time I came back, my husband and my 6 year old daughter decided since they ate all the pork belly that they needed to order another one before I got there. They were raving about how great it was, my husband was in a pig heaven sort of a trance and my daughter was hoarding pork on her side of the table. Seriously, my husband was in awe of the pork belly. I have never seen him so excited and patiently waiting his duck. ""Ingrid, please come look at the pork with me??"" ""No. Andrew, I can see the pork from here."" Look at it, look at it, please!!""? ""It's OK, I can see it, Andrew."" That was our bbq banter. He finally gave up and decided to go stare at the glass of hanging meat and drool. If you cant tell, he really loved that pork belly!! And he was right to love it. It had a perfect crispy skin, tasty pork and not overly fatty.  The fish balls with curry sauce were good. We had to get 2 orders because my daughter did not want sauce. We ended taking most of them home. They were good, just not great. The soup was a super large portion and was pretty good, clean tasting and the noodles and won tons were not soggy and pretty perfect. 

My daughter wanted rice so we got a small side of rice and they brought out some kind of duck sauce. I absolutely loved that sauce and the rice was perfectly cooked. By the way, the lady who brought out the rice was so kind and polite. To go we ordered the 3 meat combo for 12.99, I believe.  Since my husband realized it did not come with rice, he ordered a duck and rice combo for 6.99. Needless to say, yes this is a pretty inexpensive place, but the fact that my husband has no self control when it comes to pork, our bill was about 49.00 dollars, 10 dollar tip, but we had so much food, enough for his late night munchies and lunch AND dinner the next day.

So we both end up with a combination BBQ plate and shared a side order of noodle.  The noodle was good, my BBQ plate was decent.  The fact that they are busy, the service was just fair, and we missed out on their specialty. 

 I enjoyed people watching, there were so many people, obviously not from Vegas, talking non stop, and getting dish after dish.  I think that one big table, got everything on the menu!  That's probably why we were after thought in our server's mind.

Other dishes: the shrimp dumpling soup was okay (I've had better), and honestly I don't remember anything else we ordered bc I was having a duckgasm. (That might be flagged for inappropriate content, sorry Yelp).

The restaurant itself is kinda small, seats maybe 50. There's a long table in the back with maybe 10-12 seats, and you have to squeeze by them to get to the bathrooms. But i kinda love the restaurant's small size because it feels like an awesome neighborhood joint.

The one drawback is that the prices are,  imo, way too high,  inflated only because of greediness by the owners.  (i.e. they can charge it and we will still go since they really don't have any competition in this town).  They are opening a new branch on Spring Mountain soon,  as I hear,  but am unsure when.   The place is always jam packed,  and yet the service is quite good.   So yeah, if you have no problems with paying $13 for a combo plate of 3 Chinese bbq meats (as compared with Boston's price of equal substance and quality at $7.50 ) then you must go here when you crave it in Las Vegas.  The roast duck is excellent here as well,  but again the price of $12 for half a duck and $24 for a whole duck is expensive even compared with Boston pricing.   But for new transplants like myself from the Boston area,  I have no choice! 
The restaurant itself is tucked into a corner of the mall,  across the street (Jones Blvd) from the famous Chinese supermarket 168, and is almost a typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant,  but with super caring attentive staff running around in this madhouse of a restaurant.

Definitely get the roast duck, the skin is so crispy, it crackles when you take a bite. No gross soggy skin here folks!

Most of the waitresses are hard to flag down and if they're busy, rather than say they'll be right with us they'll just put a hand up and go about their business. Their English is limited though so that may have something to do with it. There was one guy, maybe he was the owner? He was actually very nice and personable.

My fella and I shared a noodle soup with dumplings and bbq pork. I had some pork belly as well. It was all delightful and the service was good. The server came back to check on us often and refilled our waters regularly, which is a must in my book!

I'll be back for some more cheap eats.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,4,JqLK2z9vwdP7ZFBdloRR5w

There could potentially be a long wait for dine in as the seating area is not too big.  Plenty of parking available however.",gsc40g-ffQ63M3qs8avB7A,0,0,5,f1rZNcVRM_cw4aJlf4hcnQ

A combo plate with two choices of meat comes with a heaping amount of rice and Chinese broccoli. I opted for roast pork & soy sauce chicken. The skin on the roast pork is soo crispy and delicious. Chicken was very fresh and marinated perfectly. 

The quality, price and portion puts Sam Woo to shame. A solid choice - will be a good option if I'm ever in LV.",q4jhCWLkC6WA5ZiN6hWf9w,3,2,4,8h-6DcxMSz56WT56dWH1sg
