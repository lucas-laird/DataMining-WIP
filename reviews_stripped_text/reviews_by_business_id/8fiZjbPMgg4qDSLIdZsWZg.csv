They try hard to please kids and helped us out when were were babysitting, by bringing a coloring book and other such distractions.

644050,2013-06-05,0,8fiZjbPMgg4qDSLIdZsWZg,"Came here last weekend for breakfast. It was my second time there. I wanted to like this place, really, as I generally like to patronize the mom and pop shops and the dives. However, I just can't get into this for breakfast.  It was vacant when we were there, unusually vacant per the waitresses.  The waitresses were friendly, almost to much so, I think the waitress we had would have gladly pulled up a seat and incesently talked the whole time we were there. Not that I don't appreciate friendliness but I also wanted to just enjoy the company of who I was with. Decor is a throw back to the 70's, with bright oranges and yellows. Definetely a locals older crowd. Like Cheers - everyone knew their names of the few of other people that were sitting at the lunch counter. 

I had the the Pioneer Breakfast, the big ticket item on the menu ($8.95), but I wanted eggs and pancakes and this fulfilled both of my requirements. I thought I was ordering too much food and wouldn't be able to finish but in reality the portion size was that I could finish it. Granted I gave my bacon away. Bacon was crispy, not microwaved like IHOP does. Pancakes were decent, but I didn't like that they only provided you with Log Cabin syrup - I guess I shouldn't expect maple syrup. They did accomodate me when I asked for scrambled eggs with cheese on them (my way of trying to incorporate a omelet into my breakfast as well). 

So it was okay, but I wouldn't go back. Previously I had the chicken fried steak, I was underwhelmed with the quality- chewy and tough. Although, to their credit, the waitress I had then (who was great, and I think I have read other Yelp reviews on her) tried to warn me of the inconsistency in the product depending on who was cooking, which was ironically the owner on that day, and I went against her sound advice as I was determined to have it.  That time my friend at the pork cutlet with gravy and she loved it, I tried a bight and it was very tender, I should have picked the pork. 

It is inexpensive, but I would rather pay a few extra dollars and try somewhere else next time.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,0,0,2,MSjA--4MEbXHHS5zCpCPRQ

      The kids were entertained with throwback toys as we waited for our food which did not take long at all for some home style cooking, I tried the eggs bennedict and Finally I find a place that uses good country ham and  just the right amount of hollandaise sauce.
The hubby had country fried steak which he devoured, he said it was not gummy or chewy like he usually finds it. 
The kids had  breakfast foods from your typical bacon and eggs to the very scrumptious waffles! Which I'll be ordering the next time we visit. 
Overall if you want a very affordable way to enjoy good people and great food this is a must try! Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of location and parking.",pfGYnson6dZdyXTu24DEow,1,1,4,ApUPL_GxHivwdQ96n8mNXA

Once you walk inside your senses are immediately assaulted by the smell of a greasy spoon diner coupled with the noxious colors of the 1970s. The artwork on the walls is kitschy - it reminds me of what some might call ""classy.""

The food is surprisingly good! I had the French Toast (they serve breakfast all day), while several others at my table had a BLT, and someone else had the fish and chips. Everyone really enjoyed their food. And for some reason, their bacon tastes REALLY good here. The staff is friendly and provide good service. Our party of six was in and out in under an hour.

If you aren't looking for fancy, and in the neighborhood, I definitely would recommend you visit. It's a fun atmosphere that looks as if it has been forgotten by time.

It reminds me of eating in my grandma's kitchen as a kid but on a larger scale.  Not a diner, not a greasy spoon but cafe with an old school vibe.

The chow is delicious and affordable unlike a commercial breakfast joint in some commercial center with a Lowe's attached to it.  I ordered a delicious omelet with green chili's, cheese and sausage.  The hash browns (extra crispy) were delicious.

The service was impeccable!  Our coffee cups never ran cold and empty.  At the end of the meal we were even asked if we wanted a cookie.

1564585,2011-01-30,0,8fiZjbPMgg4qDSLIdZsWZg,"This little gem is slightly hidden at the intersection of Decatur and Vegas.  While the address suggests Decatur, the restaurant parallels Vegas Street.  The location and ambiance are the only factors that keep this place from a 5-star rating.

Myself, the wife, and the child arrived on a Sunday, in the early afternoon.  We seated ourselves, but within seconds, a very attentive waitress was on the scene with menus and asking what we would like to drink.  She attempted to engage the 7 year-old, and was very pleasant.

I ordered the Eggs Benedict for about $7.95.  The Benedict came with choice of potatoes.  The portions were quite nice.  The cup of coffee was $1.25.  The wife ordered a cheese omelette for about $4.50.  The omelette came with toast and potatoes, and was also a nice sized portion.  The wife also did a full order of bisquits and gravy for about $3.50.  I helped with the bisquits and gravy, and they were really tasty.  One could order that meal and be quite full.  The daughter ate a grilled cheese with potato chips for $3.95, off the children's menu.  Her cup of hot chocolate was $1.25.  

The food was served hot and fast.  The waitresses kept the coffee cups filled.  The food was quite tasty.  The portions were in excess of what you'd expect for the price (think of this place as the anti-France).  The menu had many items I will want to try in the future (for example, there is a New York steak breakfast for about $8.75).  They serve waffles, pancakes, a good variety of sandwiches and salads for lunch.  Overall, the Sunshine Cafe is a great value.  

This restaurant is listed on Restaurant.com, and it's possible for a first time diner to purchase coupons, but the prices are so low, you may find it difficult to spend enough to use the coupon.",sJ0PxiYyMkOCy1VCIEWs1Q,0,0,4,-DuUqYcdGYzAtdce8Tb53w

2288581,2012-02-10,0,8fiZjbPMgg4qDSLIdZsWZg,"Flower power, baby! Before I tell you about the mediocre food, I do want to start off by letting you know that this place is so cute and offers a very homey atmoshphere- it's like the Partridge Family meets the Brady Bunch. The décor is adorable, I'll give them that. It's total 60's/70's retro....nothing psychedelic, just orange and yellow booths  with old wood paneling on the walls and cute flowers that adorn the orange and yellow hanging lights. 

The food is nothing to do back flips over. It's not bad, but it's nothing special, no knock-your-socks-off omelets or skillets or anything like that. In fact, they don't even offer skillets, which is why I prefer Lou's Diner down the street over this place (But Lou's is a bit pricier, so we tend to go to Sunshine Café more than we'd like - cheapskates, I know). 

 They offer 3 types of potatoes. The hash browns are very plain and they don't pile 'em on your plate like I like (oink oink). So why do I continue to go here you ask? It's friggin CHEAP!!! My 2 egg breakfast is only $4.95, and my son always gets their HUGE mountain man type platter of food and it's only about $8, so it's worth it to have someone else cook your breakfast once in a while. 

I think the food at Sunshine Café is really only 2 star worthy, but because the service is always outstanding and the place is just so freakin cute I'm bumping it up to 3. Also kudos for the Trivial Pursuit cards on all the tables....hereby making any wait for our order (which usually isn't that long because they're so quick, even when they're super busy) pleasurably fly by.",-HAHTQeOzHX5TCDb7qs9Yw,1,0,3,0ZQwFRWZPDa8T2O2naOyBA

It's like eating in Eric Forman's kitchen from That 70's Show. I love it.

The homestyle food is reasonably priced and portions are good. The menu is stuff like tuna melts, salisbury steaks, sandwiches, and soups. They serve breakfast all day and the homemade cinnamon rolls are HUGE and delicious.

You can tell the same servers have been working there for years. They are friendly and crack jokes with the regulars as they refill the coffee.

Hungover & starved, I would have ate a doiley with some ketchup on it at this point, we walked into the Sunshine Cafe and I immediately felt at home.  The decor is warm & homely, if you like the warm colors of the 70s, which I do.  The waitress was super friendly and made us feel like one of her kids.

The food was cooked to order.  Fantastic.  Coffee was to die for.  The prices were just right.  My bottomless cup of joe was keeping me awake until the food was ready.  When it was placed in front of me, I dove in.  An omelette with veggies, cheese on top, with a side of whole wheat toast & homefries.  Yea, I ate it all.  It was that good & I was that hungry.

2927247,2011-01-28,0,8fiZjbPMgg4qDSLIdZsWZg,"I've seen this place many times and I was finally compelled to try it out after reading such great reviews. 

I came here for breakfast. The place definitely does look very 60s with all the yellow and orange decor. You're allowed to sit wherever you want when you come in, which is always nice. There was about 7 groups of people already in the restaurant, which was kind of surprising because it doesn't look like a place that'd be that popular. I heard one of the waitresses say to another waitress, ""wow, we have a lot of new comers today."" So I'm guessing it's slowly getting more business

We seated ourselves and ordered coffee and orange juice; it came out immediately. The coffee was pretty good, I had about 3 cups! The orange juice wasn't fresh squeezed, but still refreshing. 

After looking over the decently sized breakfast menu I decided to order the Waffle Breakfast. Normally I'd get the pancake breakfast, but I wanted to try something a little different. It was only $5.95 and came with one waffle, eggs, and your choice of bacon/ham/sausage. I chose sausage of course! My boyfriend ordered the Country Breakfast for $6.25 which included 2 sausage patties, 2 eggs, home fries, and a biscuit with gravy. 

While waiting for the food to come, we noticed they had Trivial Pursuit cards stacked on the table, so we got to play that to pass the time, it was very fun! 

Our food came and we dug in. My waffle was Very dry, even after filling all the little squares with butter, jam, AND syrup (I know, that sounds a little overdone). It was pretty disappointing. I was hoping to have a good waffle experience, but it wasn't. I also got a sausage PATTY, which I'm not normally fond of. I mean, it obviously tastes the same, but I prefer links. My boyfriend ate all his food, but said it was mediocre. 

I'm sure if we ordered other dishes, like the Hash and eggs or chicken fried steak, it would've been pretty good, but we just wanted to order something different and it wasn't satisfying. However, what was satisfying was the bill.  $16.97 for 2 cups of OJ, 3 cups of joe, and 2 breakfasts is more than enough reason to get me coming back!",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,1,1,3,neHAhfWGauFmKm2DquLdMA

It was pretty run down and the food wasn't as good as I thought it'd be.  I guess my first sign should have been when I told the waitress I was between two things (one of which was chicken fried steak n eggs) and she warned me against it because it's usually not that great (chewy/fatty).

3092524,2011-06-30,1,8fiZjbPMgg4qDSLIdZsWZg,"Let me start by saying that it is hard for me to be impressed with breakfast at most restaurants. Eggs, bacon, hash browns and the like aren't very hard to do well and I can make them myself at home just fine. Sunshine Café is a nice, but certainly low-brow breakfast spot. If you want fancy this isn't the place for you. If you want a solid breakfast at a reasonable price and good service then Sunshine Café won't disappoint. The restaurant is small, but not cramped and has a very homey atmosphere. The wait staff is quite attentive and the service is always good. The one knock I would have for Sunshine is the same one I have for most breakfast joints: their breakfast gravy is just ok. I've only come across a few places in the whole country that make great biscuits and gravy and because I make it myself I've never understood why it's such a mystery for so many restaurants. The gravy at Sunshine is not bad, but it is certainly pedestrian at best. Conversely, the pancakes are very good. Light, fluffy and very flavorful. Sunshine Café is regularly on restaurant.com so if you want to give it a try you can save a few bucks.",q2b4pAo_6tP7jNFKI5Hztw,1,0,3,k7_ypuPjCAzwcFq5KVMGxw

Our Friday morning ""Breakfast Club"" chose Sunshine for this week's meeting of the minds in part so that I could continue my quest for the ultimate Chicken Fried Steak. I had reviewed the authorings of fellow Yelpers prior to dining and discovered one of them had a bad experience with the CFS after being warned by the waitress that the quality of the CFS varied depending on who was running the grill on that particular day. 

I didn't make any inquiries with the waitress regarding the CFS. I figured I would order it and give it it's due process good, bad or indifferent. Of all the places I've included in my quest for the ultimate Chicken Fried Steak, this was by far the worst of the bunch without question. This was not lightly breaded and smothered in gravy like EVERY other place included in the quest. This was an unbreaded piece of meat served on top of the gravy. Apperance aside, the first bite was not appetizing and almost brought the meal to a screeching halt. The potatoes (I got home fries) were undercooked, as was the anemic pancake I got in place of toast. Three of the five in our group got pancakes and there was no consistency between the three.

Although the waitress was extremely friendly and the coffee was never empty, she brought the meals out one plate at a time for our party of five. I can't speak for the others in the group, but this was not a good experience for me. I am normally not a ""one and done"" kind of guy and will eventually give the Sunshine Cafe another shot based solely on previous visits, but will defintely scratch the CFS from my list of choices.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,5,3,2,2GNUKlypYZpq1LGqcy6cPA

But when all is said and done every thing on the menu is good it's all homestyle cooking an reminds me of early morning breakfast as a kid.,3DjTbhg_HndAxtRnRBt0aQ,2,0,4,rY2LHmqMrdrusPDlyBV0LA

Very clean, and homey.  The staff was very pleasant and patient (I'm super picky when it comes to breakfast).  The food reminds me of Grandma's too, nothing special, just the basics, but it was good.  The prices were very reasonable as well.  This is definitely a little hidden hole in the wall, seems like everyone that came in was a regular since the waitress knew them all by name.",7QXtasoVTQJuEjbmbLsDGA,3,1,3,UauxQWt9N7LWcnuYHh-TfA

I ordered a short stack of pretty ordinary pancakes while Ann could not resist the day's special, apple cinnamon French toast accompanied by an excessively sweet, sticky syrup plus 2 eggs and bacon.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,0,0,2,lCM4Pz6uC9AS39QTCZP5BA

It it is in a rinky dink area but I would still check it out again when I am in vegas.,S2ldOPPEo_CvygbHP3P8zQ,0,1,4,DPmEqxZkuGL5Clf3YcntsA

Now what about the food? Simple, straight foward, right from your Momma's kitchen.  My choice today, country breakfast, scrambled, two sauage patties choice of potato and biscuit with milk gravy!

Very good, simple, nothing fancy. Cooked well, gravy is thick, with bits of sauage and and seasoned, reminds me of the South!

Overall, good service, simple food and price is right!",FIk4lQQu1eTe2EpzQ4xhBA,2,2,4,E1ARJq-Ln7kTqmdOZFvW2g

Everything else was great though:) The waitresses all worked together to make sure we had great service and it was a really friendly home away from home type of place. I like the atmosphere and I loved the services.,QGMW6BzOqJHimByBnm4fvQ,1,0,4,mn0M5xFSFdKB7xB7ERkWnw
