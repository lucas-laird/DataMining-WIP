It is so beautiful inside. The waiter couldn't have been friendlier. It was a nice relaxing meal. We tried four different sushi rolls and they were all great. The salmon skin roll was my favorite.

The sushi tasted great! I loved all the rolls we ordered (vegas, cherry popper, geisha, miso yummy). I chose the ones without cream cheese.   

They also had some other non sushi menu ranging from $3-$5. I ordered the scallop wrapped in bacon ($4.50 I want to say) and it was delicious!!!!! but not sure if it was worth the price because all I got was one big scallop wrapped in bacon on stick, but to be fair it wasn't as simple as it sounds. There was some green onions and other great seasonings to makes this so tasteful. Presentation of all the dishes were wonderful. 

The decor was lovely (bathroom is beautiful!!) which was something I wasn't expecting based on its outside appearance. The whole place felt clean. 

Service was wonderful. They were always making sure we were doing well granted that we were the only ones there on a Tuesday night. Happy hour is from 5-8:30pm and 10pm to midnight (close).

I would definitely come back for sure. I wasn't disappointed by anything on the menu, the place looked great and the prices were decent.",lSbPoOIcHdt4TTh6k0jt7Q,5,2,5,DXmdz_KSDXHiwhITOTY19A
422009,2012-02-21,0,nQ--EthdNGaIf_nUkBj6Xw,"I'm not sure what's going on at this place, but I had to come straight back to update this review to spare other tourists the bad experience. So, my boyfriend and I thought we'd try the sushi place across the street from our hotel during the last night of an impromptu Vegas getaway. We should have kicked in a few more bucks and tried another higher ranked and more recently reviewed place.

The dinner experience began with an out right lie. We called earlier to ensure that they were open and check for specials and were told by a male staff member that half-off sushi was in effect for 10pm-12am. When we arrived, the waitress had no idea what we were talking about and refused to honor the deal. We decided to stick it out, since we were both craving sushi and had already waited a little late for dinner. 

The sushi was worse than half-off grocery store sushi. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the chef grabbed it from a gas station on the way in to work and served it. Definitely the worse we've ever had. We were actually nervous after finishing up our meal that we would be sick later. The rolls were poorly constructed and had no flavor at all. The redeeming qualities were the miso soup and the green tea, which had great flavor and were served at the perfect temperature. The service was good, but not enough to make up for the terrible sushi. The bill came to $55 for two sushi rolls, two green teas, two side salads and two miso soups. A little more than annoying for such a terrible meal. We would have been better off ordering a pizza from Papa Johns. 

I'm going to wrap this review up and enjoy the rest of my trip, but stay far away from this place if you're accustomed to well made sushi. You will be disappointed.",VbKvPyzS0aWKAXEWkJ3xVw,3,0,1,rl866u7nrXPeri8E9HSJiw

The house hot sake was good and strong, and the sashimi, seaweed salad, and caterpillar roll were really good.  The waitress was attentive and friendly, and the ambiance was delightfully tranquil.

This place is a little bit off the beaten path, and the whole experience fits right into that mold.

Being a college student going to vegas it hit the budget a bit hard, so you can get cheaper sushi (all you can eat) at yamasushi a little farther off the strip.

The sushi was decent but I had to take off star because of the terrible service we had. The waitress was nice but it took us FOREVER to get our food. Not only was there only one very slow sushi chef but I remember seeing our food on the kitchen counter for 10 min before it was even brought to us.

Tried several of the rolls w/ our group  Miso Yummy was my favorite. We also had the Cherry Popper Roll, Orange Blossom, Las Vegas Roll, Smokin Salmon (yuck), Hangover Roll (meh), Seafood Tempura Roll (meh), Wild Geisha & a few Sashami items (cut really thin). Seemed most rolls or items on happy hour menu were deep fried on the outside or had something deep fried inside very few had no fried stuff. Yuck - not looking to eat deep fried anything but seems all the sushi happy hours do this to fill people up. Were nice enough to separate out our checks.

The sashimi a la carte is also excellent!  The only place I have found Snow Beauty; a unfiltered sake that is creamy and sweet.  Sometimes the only hang up is actually leaving here; staff can be a little slow to actually ""ring you up"" and bring you a check.  This the only downside about the place. With two happy hours though (including a late night reverse happy hour) it makes this spot ideal as all I have do to do for great sushi is walk right next door.",-8APNXHR8Zk3Pm43d1M4QQ,0,0,4,rdIK7oSXmZceFrqWSqNblQ

When I say high end, I mean that you sit down and you don't get a menu and no prices are shown anywhere.  Yes, you're going to pay lots of $$$$$ and be ready to break the bank.

I lived in Las Vegas for 2 years, and The Rising Sun has amazing fresh food and is authentic!!! You can pay top dollar somewhere else in Vegas, and yes, you'll get a nicer atmosphere, but as extremely picky sushi fan (you can read my reviews of other sushi places), you cannot beat this place for the price you pay.

If you're ever in Las Vegas, this is a must-go-to spot.  Quite simply, this place has the best Japanese sushi west of the Mississippi.",k2amjk4NkEn7NUsN2XX7CQ,3,1,5,cnFJ8-4wVMP0Wr4iVbxDKw

4012779,2013-02-18,2,nQ--EthdNGaIf_nUkBj6Xw,"Rising Sun is east of Las Vegas Boulevard, just off the Las Vegas Strip.  The decor inside is nice and had been put together with well thought.  The lighting is a shade off white so if you were to take a picture of your food be sure to have your flash on so it doesn't tint the color with yellow.  

I was here for happy hour.  Happy Hours are from 5-8, and 10-12.  And from the prices, it's about 50% off.  Awesome deal!  Awesome if it actually saved you money.  The prices are so high, maybe because it's so close to the strip but dining here during Happy Hour is the only way to go.  Five hours out of seven is happy hour, can't beat that.  

I started off with the Kiss of Geisha, it was strong.  It was good.  It was delicious.  You and I, we like to drink.  Sake, Grey Goose, and Cranberry.  The grilled chicken and bacon chicken were good.

I walked up to the chef because I know the server wouldn't know the answer so I asked for what's fresh today and he said everything.  There is always something more fresh than others.  I asked if they had salmon and yellowtail toro, they did!  I ordered one each.  The salmon belly was not fatty at all, it was double layered also because I don't think he had any.  

If you look at the supposed fatty salmon:
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rising-sun-las-vegas?select=-5kU9WFQllx2EguHQ9lD2Q#NCqpKcUhALgCUT6qFpkYIA

Compared to the regular salmon (nigiri special):
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rising-sun-las-vegas?select=-5kU9WFQllx2EguHQ9lD2Q#tHhgh3HhuhzW8BgIXOvA6A

You can clearly see it's the same cut.  I would rather be told they didn't have it than to be served regular salmon nigiri sushi with an extra piece on top.  Little integrity issue there.  The fatty yellowtail came out next and this had a little fat to it, I'm guessing he's saving the actual good cuts for his VIP customers because this was not up to fatty standards.  You want to see that oil, you want it to melt in your mouth, I shared the second piece with Anthony because I could already tell I was going to be disappointed.  We were just at Kaze Sushi eating some good cut of Yellowtail Belly, and this didn't even come close.

Both of those came out to almost $20, I would pay that much for good cuts but this was robbery.

Lastly I ordered some deep fried oreo's, it's not Mermaids quality but better.  I was happy with it, and the cheap ice cream served with it.  We were given other items as well but I'm only reviewing the items I paid for.  I do have to say that the roll topped off with a splash of yuzu sauce was my favorite roll.  I don't eat rolls so I would have ordered more nigiri or sashimi special but I didn't want to be jipped again.

Normally I am a big fan, but this was like eating a dog toy treat; chewy, and goop in side.  Of the 4 who tried...none said they would order it again.  Edamame was undercooked and cold.

The happy hour selection is pretty good with rolls, sashimi and many skewers as well as beer, sake and mixed drinks. One of the best deals is the selection of premium sake at half off. I had a large Sapporo and 3 rolls and was out of there for $28. An awesome deal if you ask me, the rolls were very good, not the best but for the price very tasty. The music was a little loud but that probably means I am getting old. Highly recommend this place.",ZK7NL7JIfVAQesqtd9ARsw,2,2,4,9uT95JN9kXId73lsB0pZPQ

5583223,2012-11-20,1,nQ--EthdNGaIf_nUkBj6Xw,"I am very impressed by this place.  Although they do not offer AYCE, they have an awesome happy hour sporting 1/2 priced special rolls, some sashimi, drinks, and other goodies. (warning, not all regular items are 1/2 price).

They have some very interesting special rolls, the most intriguing is the hangover roll which has sausage, bacon, mayo and many other ingredients, yet truly works.  We loved the Mi So Yummy, Wild Geisha, Las Vegas, Cherry Bomb, etc.

Tony is awesome and if you are lucky, he may even come have a sake shot with you.  

The decor is more comfortable than most sushi places I have been and they even have a few flat screens so you can watch the game.

It is hard to find due to the glut of signage from larger establishments but it is certainly worth it.  

I will be planning a UYE in December so keep your eyes open!",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,7,2,5,V1-NchbXc13J2ENcoi1l9Q

5903268,2013-03-27,3,nQ--EthdNGaIf_nUkBj6Xw,"Love this jap spot! 

This is right next to the meridian, where I usually stay in vegas. 

No wait when you come here, the place is clean, and you can even sit on couches during your meal! loved being able to stretch my legs out and comfortably eating. 

I ordered the shrimp tempura udon! The bok choy was so good in it and the broth was perfect. It tasted like there wasn't a lot of sodium (which I liked) and it tasted overall healthy. They portioned the soup and udon perfectly, which i appreciated. 

However, I did not like how the shrimp tempura gets soggy inside the soup, next time I will request no shrimp tempura, or if they can put if off to the side because it keeps breaking apart as it was inside the soup. yuck. 

But the soup was great, I will be here again!!!!! 

The customer service is awesome! They tried accommodating our entertainment needs by changing the channel on the TV for us, which was sweet because they didn't have to do that for us! 

My cousin also enjoyed this place as well (she got the yakitori and was very satisfied), good job guys!",mWSyXDZrNVSHKUpVDoatag,6,3,5,t3K2QOOiB0HaM51b6tHU9Q

They have a very nice and comfortable atmosphere, the service was good, no pressure or rush, and best of all they have a great happy hour which gave us a chance to try a lil bit of everything as well as making it an affordable experience.

5918766,2013-02-15,3,nQ--EthdNGaIf_nUkBj6Xw,"Came to Rising Sun sushi restaurant on E. Flamingo Rd (across from Tuscany casino) for a recent UYE.  The restaurant is nicely decorated, plays a fantastic playlist of music, and is really clean.

One of the main selling points of this sushi spot is their Happy Hour (in addition to their regular menu, they offer a limited HH menu of food and drinks). They actually have two of them (5pm-8pm and 10pm-midnight, excluding holidays).  Another for out of town visitors staying at nearby casinos and resorts is its proximity to the southern end of the Las Vegas Strip.

Personal highlights of the food I tried are:

Miso Yummy Roll (shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber inside and topped with salmon and miso dressing) being one of my favorite.  

Cherry Popper Roll is good too.  If you like California Roll and tuna plus a little spicy orange sauce, then you will like this.

Their Japanese Chicken Meatball served yakitori style is a nice salty appetizer, and I think everyone at the table enjoyed it.  

Hangover Roll is an interesting one. It has hot link sausage, avocado and cream cheese wrapped in bacon then tempura fried, with sprinkles of parmesan cheese, scallions and drizzles wasabi mayo.  I am glad I tried it, but will probably save room for something else in future visits.

Wild Salmon Sashimi was good. It is not the traditional sashimi (just slices of fresh fish) served in Japan, but new style sashimi made popular by Nobu.

If I was rating the restaurant solely based on food, creativity and taste of the rolls, service and ambiance it will get 4 stars.  But factoring in the overall price/value, I would have to only rate it 3 stars.  The main reason being that nigiri is not part of the HH menu, and at regular price is more than most off-Strip non-AYCE sushi restaurants in Las Vegas.

3 stars (A-OK).",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,11,5,3,n35LjovaJpbPD2L72euzFg
