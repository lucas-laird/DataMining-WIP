I use to work at a wing shop so my standards are high and this place has the best wings I could find, Me and my roomate are obsessed with their garlic parm! Every other menu item has never been a disappointment either, these guys do not skip on quality. I get delivery or carry out and has never had an order wrong or missing something, which happens a lot with other places. Everyone is always welcoming and friendly and that kind of attention to detail is why I'm addicted.
My only complaint is that they aren't open 24hrs but that's probably best otherwise I'd never eat anything else.",1Gd_CYEA5JjcS56WeewK5Q,2,1,5,84FVf7bcuYvVjhLa6p5rAw

I ordered Hawaiian pizza with bell peppers and fingers. Now Magura is a little over 5 minutes away.  I used the Eat24 app to place order at 1624 and was supposed to arrive at 1708. The food arrived 15 minutes later.  So it took 10 minutes to cook the food. Doesn't pizza take longer to cook? The bell peppers were missing from the pizza. It must  have been pre-made. The fingers were greasy and tasted weird. I should have taken a picture. The fries were good. Had to throw the fingers out. Won't be ordering from there for a while.",1JNqxJr8cDb689up53NGig,4,0,2,kQqj96X0mDlxaQ5HKTwfTQ

The pics on Yelp made me think it was going to be not so good pizza. I ordered a Hawaiian i must say the pizza is really good. The pics don't do the pizza justice. I'll definitely go back.

1040261,2016-05-19,1,zYDih_sBtW5ujL-zmUjIqA,"Ordered simple pizza and wings with fries. Food was pretty good but they did not bring complete order. When I called and explained the situation the employee couldn't comprehend what happened, after several more attempts to explain she finally caught on, but wouldn't send out the food I paid for. Be careful, you may get ripped off especially if you order from Yelp as prices are different/cheaper than their menu and food combinations differ also. Won't buy from again. To be fair their delivery driver was fast and friendly.

UPDATE....After posting the above review, Hannah, from the restaurant, called and offered to send out the correct order without charge. I modified the rating from 2 to 3 stars, but not anymore because they still wouldn't take responsibility for the error. They blame the website for posting the wrong prices, but if they see an order come in from that website why not make a little effort and call the customer to notify him/her of the difference(s)....laziness or greed?

The only reason I've gone in-depth with this review is because I am absolutely fed up with getting ripped off so frequently by businesses, even if it's only for a few bucks.",ioUWdz-ptBRnG3jMhC7KaA,6,1,3,88l66AVFqxf66NhSU5I8jg

I called the business to check on my order and as soon as I called he told me the delivery guy had just left. I waited 40-45 minutes for a takeout order!!! How freaking ridiculous. And the food wasn't very good either. I got the broccoli cheddar soup, it has absolutely no taste at all. I also ordered chicken wings, medium spice.

Ordered takeout a couple times: first order of a salad and grilled cheese was dismal, with large, rough-cut veggies in the salad and unmelted cheese on the sandwich. But there was tons of chicken on the salad and their prices are reasonable.

Returned for the pizza, specifying half Spinach and Feta and half Philly Steak. Happily, they were able to accommodate this though they later told me they typically don't do half styles. The pie was loaded up with toppings and both sides were tasty enough to make it difficult to pick a favorite. However, the crust was somewhat soggy in the middle, which I didn't care for.

Staff have been friendly and the location is clean. I'll likely be ordering again (specifically the eggplant parm sandwich!) because they're quick, cheap, and convenient.

Disappointed I hung up and checked their yelp page/directions to realize I lived only 2.7 miles away. Why offer delivery if you don't even go 3 miles for your customers.

Lots of topping, even on a one topping order. Light on the sauce, nice thin and crispy crust.

Delivery was quick, much faster than expected. The driver arrived within 30 minutes. He wasn't super friendly, but he did have to wait out in the heat for a minute because I didn't hear him knock. 

The two pizzas were tasty. The crust was thin and crisp. A number of reviews complained that it was soggy, but we didn't have that problem. They brushed some garlicky oil on the edges and gave it a nice salty tang. I loved the white pizza. No complaints. 

The mushrooms were ok. I felt like it was a really small portion for the cost and they weren't special in any way.

Delivery took about 40 min. Our friends seemed more impressed by the pizza than I was. It was pretty standard to me. Above average greasiness, floppy slices. Loads of toppings though. Probably shouldn't have gone with plain wings. They were super crispy but seemed like a lot of skin, not much meat. They did give us 3 sauces each of ranch, bbq and hot which was generous. The favorite for me was the four cheese. The ricotta was really thick. Unfortunately the crust was just mediocre. Very floury and there were big pockets of air. I'd say for the price, this wasn't worth it.

I doubt we will ever return to give them another try. First impressions mean a lot, especially when it comes to food. Reminds us of another failed pizza location on Pecos/Flamingo.",aaPzncoFcHkj-AJPQTgCxw,0,0,1,MEfzeV9R8sh-zKnGi9iZ0w

What is great crust/cheese/toppings to one is not another's favorites.  That being said, I think I've found my new go to pizza joint.  There was an Eat24 coupon last week for $7 off so I said, heck yeah, let's give this place a go!

The delivery was fast, the pizza was delicious, and it was even great cold the next day!  The sauce was spiced right, toppings were fresh, and I had a great experience, I will definitely be back and would definitely recommend it.  

As I mentioned above, each person looks for something different with their pizza; as for me, this place is finally the place I will reorder from because their crust has been my favorite in this city, and it has been the best tasting cold pizza I've had in this city.",iN5505977Li8XYZ3FnzWJQ,1,0,5,C6SSdOcESjbTpuu_xyCGGg

Best damn mistake she's made in a long Time! We both really do love this place. The calzone is our favorite. We love the sauce. Honestly best pizza I've had in as long as I can remember. This place beats Pizza Hut, dominos, and papa johns hands down. The staff is fairly friendly. The first time we came they didn't rub me the right way to be honest. But I'm sure the poor guys were tired. But the pizza was so good that we have come back a few times and hope to come many more times.",jLMhF5g3tn8pquntJ-0E4Q,3,0,5,c3ZurMqxPHBPWEAPLO2Jhg

The resturant then reached out 30 minutes later after they accepted my order and informed me the restaurant closed early. Good job Magura,8bAM0gNl1wc0iAHTtmkLmg,2,1,1,uWt27g5NA7cVwuMizD8hZw
5476932,2016-07-11,0,zYDih_sBtW5ujL-zmUjIqA,"I just ordered from here today. Initially, I was upset because online they have a different menu than what their updated menu is. However, upon returning to the website I noticed that if you click on the first icon for prices it will give you the old menu but if you scroll further down (almost to the bottom) it gives you the updated menu. This is something management, or the website moderator should look into since it's along the lines of a bait and switch. 
I was going to leave only 3 stars for my review (this was before eating their food) solely based on 1 star for delivery, 1 star for the food and 1/2 star for ease of ordering, so technically 2.5/5 stars. Once we got the food, though, we were pleasantly surprised. We ordered the couple special, which on the old menu was suppose to have a 10"" pizza, chicken with fries, and 2 sodas; the updated menu is a 14"" pizza with salad and 2 sodas. The difference in price between the old menu and the new menu is only a few dollars but you are also given a little less; example- we weren't given soda. No big deal on the soda since we cracked open a couple beers, anyways. Also, since we thought we weren't going to be given french fries along with the chicken we were going to upgrade our chicken order from 4 to 8, this made the price jump nearly $10 & we decided against it. It's a good thing we didn't upgrade the order since the chicken came with fries.
Now, food: 
The pizza was the second best pizza I have had in my entire life. My husband took one bite and moaned, it was so good. 
The chicken was BBQ chicken and was smothered in sauce. Flavorful sauce nonetheless, but way too much. They were also wide pieces of tender, which was also a pleasant surprise considering we thought they'd be no bigger than typical tenders. 
The French fries were thick cut fries, fried to perection. My favorite kind of fries, to be honest.
Our added beer made the food even more enoyable.

So, my rating is 4/5 stars: 1 for delivery, 2 for food,  .5 for ease of ordering and .5 for customer service.

The reason I am not giving 5 stars is because they wouldn't honor the price that was displayed on their online menu that they claim to be the old menu. It isn't that big of a deal, but honestly if you have it posted you really should honor it. I also recommend since it was called the couples selection #1 that they still keep this option and rename it couples selection #2 with a small upcharge to offset the cost of the chicken and fries.

Overall, I am happy with the food and fast delivery.

Will I order again? Yes. This is now my #1 place in Vegas for pizza, and I will recommend others to order from here...after first sending them the link to the correct menu. ;)",ARUH_akah3LVnATtce6H9Q,1,0,4,LcM7ZrEbvlrJxV1zZVDTGg
