4329346,2011-11-12,1,XsDDwNOBlRQNF8x7oi0Hjw,"Ok, this place is seriously tasty. I wasn't expecting much- it was near my hotel, it was in a strip mall, and the restaurant smelled of too-strong incense. But the food was really good, with great vegan selections. There was so much, I was able to eat it for lunch two days in a row (in the restaurant, and once in leftovers). Even the leftovers drew jealous stares from other conference-goers :)

So it is delicious, and it is decently priced for how much food you get. Just look past the exterior and sit far from the incense.",Lgv7NV1qNBXPbhROBi81pg,5,2,4,wgjoEhgWYIUzhSHkIetwfw

He was an amazing host with a lovely radiant smile. Will defiantly visit again. Price was great!,35pRt-4EvEr7SaBoCBkN4g,1,1,5,aHlitzrA2POwCCPpkEpBng
4891948,2017-07-17,0,XsDDwNOBlRQNF8x7oi0Hjw,"I absolutely LOVE Ethiopian food! It's something about the seasoning that's addictive and the injera is amazing! Having a best friend that's Ethiopian I've tried a lot of different restaurants including in other cities. Typically I'd have Tibs or Kitfo  but lately my kick is the vegetarian sampler. This was my first time here and I only tried the sampler. The interesting thing is, you never know what you'll get as they change the ""samplers"" often. At this restaurant there was three bean dishes, collard greens, and cabbage with potatoes (sorry I don't know the names, it's not specifically listed on the menu). All were really tasty! I'll definitely come again. So if you're a fan of Ethiopian and vegetarian food give this place a try! 

The only draw back is the location! This area is pretty sketchy so be careful. Also, the restaurant is a little dark and dimly light which isn't so inviting. I recommend to order to go as I did.",s-y7Mm6s3LjaF4fvdxE7cg,2,1,5,Yp9c8mk01uMvD3_8PTbVrw
5023463,2010-05-13,1,XsDDwNOBlRQNF8x7oi0Hjw,"Delish & appetizing!   Don't be fooled by the area or exterior! 
Restaurant.com had only 1 Ethiopian restaurant listed  & we weren't disappointed with what they served.
Its always a positive when the obvious is occurring ( Ex: Ethiopians eating & drinking at an Ethiopian restaurant) 
Enjoyed the curried lamb, vegetarian delight, & beef tibs w Doro wat...it was all good and spicy.  The lamb by far was my favorite of the all the dishes we tried because of how well seasoned it was.
Now for the con:
They were recently bought and should have more than a handful of menus for a large party. Also we requested that everything served in separate bowls, instead it was served on 1 large platter.
Overall the food was quite good.",liWnObQxCckRGAyFbaI7oQ,2,2,3,zOwAPsfidZzjiKtvoTv9pQ

5253681,2016-05-03,0,XsDDwNOBlRQNF8x7oi0Hjw,"I was here in July 2015: I came here with a group of friends. We ordered the bruschetta (sp?) And something that was like a somosa for appetizers. It was so flavorful and freshly made. For the entree we order some sort of combo with beef, lamb and chicken. The food is eaten with your hands, community style. Very interesting and fun! 

We all over stuffed ourselves because it was so good! We couldn't stop eating! The food was seasoned so well and the quality of the ingredients was excellent. On top of the awesome food was awesome service! Everyone was very friendly and made sure we had all the water and extra bread we needed with the meal. Coming here was an experience and I'd recommend you come here too!",5VYAavH59LYTa-Ezr8c4_A,1,1,4,087TebAjgk9GWph_MGMBrA
5258410,2017-08-01,1,XsDDwNOBlRQNF8x7oi0Hjw,"Definitely not a fancy place or a place you would go to for their ambiance/decor ... BUT if you just want delicious, high-quality Ethiopian food for very reasonable prices, this is the place to go.

I came on a Thursday evening, and aside from a couple of people who came to get food to-go, I think I was the only customer there aside from who I am guessing are friends or family of the restaurant owners. They had CNN on their giant TV in the main dining room, which was fine for catching up on recent events while I've been traveling. It looks like the interior of the restaurant hasn't been updated in many years, but at least it looked clean.

Knowing there are usually vegan options and that traditional injera is usually gluten-free, I felt comfortable ordering the Shiro. And it was delicious!

The default water option is bottled water, which is $1. (Is Las Vegas tap water not clean?) And it comes with a glass of ice which I'm guessing is made from tap water, so ... I'm confused. Whatever.

My server was nice, though maybe not the most attentive. I took my time eating, but she didn't really come by to check on me after bringing me my food, and I had to wave her over after I'd been sitting there for a while to ask for a box for the rest of my food to go. (For a single order, there's more than enough food for two very filling meals.)",LT27AG_SfvJZjy1nda4vfw,4,2,4,CC_hJ6zFCMFGHfGM5SHt5g
5419044,2015-10-04,1,XsDDwNOBlRQNF8x7oi0Hjw,"I always love hole in the wall spots bc I have always had great quality if food experience. 

We ordered a 4-meat combo: goat, chicken, lamb and beef, vegetables and lentils. Both of us can grub real good esp after spa day which we did and still walked away with leftovers. Very delicious! The only meat I did not like so much was the beef which was not as tender as I like my beef and the goat which was a bit chewy. 

The vegetables were tasty and the best was the lamb stew!!! 

Customer service was great! Two people checked in with us several times. 

Great quality of food, attentive customer service and quiet place to enjoy a nice meal.",cJEbTP-MLVA5Y489pCp4pQ,3,2,4,qO_LrCS2HyrLZqdSkGla3w
