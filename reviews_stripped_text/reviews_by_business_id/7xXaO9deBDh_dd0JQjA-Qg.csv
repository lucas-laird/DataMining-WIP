She was training someone but that should not have affected our service. We ended up ordering our food around 8:00pm, waited 40 mins for our food!! When we realized how long we had been waiting for we asked how much until our food came out, in a very condescending voice she told us that they always brought out the salads and soups first. I'm pretty sure they do that at all restaurants we just asked a simple question and she should not have responded that way.  When we received our food everything was cold! It seemed like they were sitting under the heat lamp for a while the bread on the burgers were hard, our mashed potatoes and green beans were ice cold!

59733,2010-04-22,2,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"Ehhhhh...I just don't know. I've dined in at this Claim Jumper about twice a month for the past 8 months that I've resided in Vegas, and probably ordered the take out another 5-10 times or so when I was working more frequently in Town Square. Everything here is so unbelievably inconsistent, that it's hard to give this place a solid rating. When the food is good and the service is good, this place is definitely 4-5 stars. But when its bad...boy is it bad. 

Claim Jumper has an excellent menu and dessert selection. This is their strength and weakness - they offer a little of everything for everyone while specializing in absolutely nothing. They also offer a full service bar that's pretty handy to grab a Stoli Cranberry when you're waiting for a table on a Saturday night. And the drinks are pretty darn good, especially when this blonde guy Chris is in the bar. He makes a mean martini - the kind that makes me shamelessly fall off my bar stool when I get up to follow the hostess to my awaiting table.

The servers are hit or miss. I've had a few that were friendly and talkative and gave me free dessert for being a sweetheart. I've also had some that were outright hostile by slamming a plate or cheese toast on the table or rolling their eyes and groaning when I meekly asked for a refill of iced tea. Luckily, I've found a server that is polite, friendly, and thorough, so I just request him when I go in. ""Are you sure you're willing to wait 40 minutes for a table with him, ma'am?"" Why yes, yes I am; I've got my appletini right here to entertain me.

The food for the most part is mediocre and generally lukewarm by the time it reaches the table. But the portions are ridiculously huge. I order off the Little Jumper's menu most of the time (when I have a server that's willing to accomodate that), and even then I end up taking about half of it home. I've had a variety of different dishes (lobster, steak, turkey dinner, burger, pizza, country fried steak, etc.), and I find I'm disappointed most of the time. Their mini pizzas and sliders are phenomenal though.

Decor is nice enough. Booths are comfy. Bathrooms are clean. Outdoor spring/summer seating looks nice. The music that plays is mostly 80s and is completely awesome. It's half the fun of going there.

Lunch take-out has proven to be a worthless joke for me. Despite ordering 15-20 minutes before I even jaunt on over there for pick up, half the time they forget to put my order in, and the other half of the time something happens in the kitchen and it has to be completely remade. I appreciate the quality checks the staff makes before handing my order over to me, but I'm starving. It's just one freaking soft pretzel! Pleeeeeeaaaasssseeee feed me...I only have 5 minutes left on my lunch!

Worth noting are their fantastic managers. If something goes wrong, they're there at your table to make sure it gets done right. They're very friendly and on top of things.

So there you have it. Some good points, and some bad. I've put up with it, mostly because it was easy and a comfortable routine for my husband and I. But recently we discovered ""I Love Sushi"" so I think that's going to seriously cut into our Claim Jumper visits. Which is absolutely fine by both of us.",owlCjxNkDW02M3ABygGgag,2,1,3,mbqv45G2eR01ajQnEjbocQ

169548,2011-05-02,0,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"We came here on a Friday night and were annoyed from the beginning.  We prefer tables over booths and was told we would have to wait at least a half hour for a table but could be seated immediately at a booth.  I said okay and put our name in - I could see in the background however that there were tables were available. We waited it out and were seated about 20 minutes later.  

I also didn't appreciate the hard sell tactics by several members of the staff to join their membership perks club - why pay $25 up front just to get the $25 back later in a gift card.  Most of the restaurants they were promoting are not even offered in Vegas.

The timing and temperature of the food was not good either - we ordered a appetizer of garlic cheese bread for the table which came out quickly but was barely lukewarm and the marinara sauce served with it was cold.  It took another 30 minutes for the soups / salads which would have been great but not even five minutes later - out came the entrees.  My food was all cold but if I would have returned it - everyone else would have been waiting on me and we had a movie to catch.

I went to claim jumper on 6/24/14 with my family as we arrived at 910 pm and they close at 930 they were visibly irritated they had to serve us. By the time we got out food there was only 2 other family's in the restaurant. After I ate the moderate baby back ribs and paid the bill we left the restaurant. I Quickly realized I left my phone about 30 feet from the claim jumper and quickly ran back and knocked on the door because they locked it. While waiting over 5 minutes for someone to open the door I used my gf phone to check the find my iPhone app and saw the phone was on and located it the restaurant still. Then someone turned the phone off and I could no longer see it. So the last location was in the claim jumper before it was shut off! I was upset because I lost my iPhone that I spent $750   Because I bought it with no contract. The manager was nice but did very little to help find my phone rather than look around the bathroom. A young bus boy saw me frustrated and said ""don't look at me man I didn't do it"" which only made it more certain In my mind he took it. The waiter and the bus boy were the only ones who had access to the table, all the customers had already made there way out. Security came and took a report but nothing happened. 4 days later I am still phoneless as I am writing this on my gf phone. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!

I don't usually type up bad reviews but I felt compelled to do so for the shit experience I had with this restaurant. 

First off Ill go with the good, we had a nice server named Jen, but either she is new or she just takes too long to handle situations. 

The shit, the food service from start to finish was crappy. First, we order the appetizer combo, spinach dip, and calamari. And I gotta say, nothing tasted fresh whatsoever. The appetizer combo is greasy with your standard onion rings, chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, potato skins, and fried zuchinni. Next the spinach and artichoke dip was ok at best but the chips were really stale, even though the manager said it was made to order, it is not. And finally the calamari is totally frozen and you can tell that from the taste of it. 

And finally our entrees, we ordered the ore cart, chicken and brocolli pasta, and the pork and beef ribs. They all come with a side of soup or salad. We decided on clam chowder until I noticed a thick film around the chowder. This shit has been sitting on the stove way too long. Its salty and real thick. Our waitteess says thats normal but that is complete and utter bull shit. Clam chowder never has a thick film around the top layer. So I decided to change it with a salad, which was pretty much pre-made. And finally we got our food. When I received my pork and beef ribs they looked decent until I felt them. They were really fucken cold! Like if the food inspection put a thermometer through the meat it will definitely be unsanitarily out of code. Anyways, I told the waittress about this and she told me that this happens alot. WHAT!? This is when shit hit the ceiling. I got my plate back less than five minutes which would probably mean what? Yeah you guessed it, it was probably microwaved and you can that from the taste. The pasta was really dry and overcooked. And the beef ribs were not tender or 'fall off the bone' at all. 

While the manager apologized for the poor food service. We told him about the shitty food and he looked surprised about this shit. And asked to give us free dessert. And we were foolish enough to take it. If I were you, I recommend to clear the bill and dont waste your money on this shit hole. 

I feel like this should be in a dinner impossible or kitchen nightmare. My suggestion is if its a convenience sake just either go to yard house or ale house in town square. Any chain restaurants are better than this. You're better off going to chilis, TGIF, apple bees, and outback than this overpriced piece of shit of a restaurant.",zZTAZpyBeh5cUjt9xOR1eA,0,0,1,HeuD5cSZh5YGaXsBZNvVFw

We went in for dinner and THREE tables that came after us were served ahead of us. The only reason we even got to order in the first place was because I got up and pulled a waiter to our table. Not only that, there was a table that arrived ten minutes after we ordered and STILL got their food before we did. They even ordered almost the same identical food we did (breakfast food; hash browns and eggs). The only difference is one of us got steak and eggs. 

When the food finally arrived, the scrambled eggs were really disgusting like the kind you leave in the pan too long until it gets watery and mushy. The steak was supposed to be medium rare but was barely that, more on the rare side. Hash browns also had the same ""heated too long on pan"" mushiness. Overall it was a disgusting experience for us, and even waiting for the check had to take forever. I repeat, we watched three tables that came in at various times after us get food before we did.

We may have just been that unlucky table, but everything about the experience put us in a bad mood to start off the night. Luckily it's hard to stay in a bad mood in Vegas.",-yinz0KFNNgIk-PsEVMEZw,1,0,1,J9nmoYRgyr_4-XkIGtBCjg

Sat and PATIENTLY waited for AT LEAST 5 minutes (I'm being generous with my estimation).  Finally, the waitress comes with the menu and said she'd be back...  Ya, like another 10 minutes or so.  Took our order.  Came back with our water after about another 10 minutes and said she'd be right our with our order.

618743,2014-03-19,0,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"I will never go to this Claim Jumper again (possibly none).  After browsing the other reviews, I realize our experience was not unique at this location.  I completely agree with the management having no clue and the lackadaisical service.

#1 - We arrived at 6:30 pm on a Tuesday.  Not busy at all.  We were the first in our party & called them to find they had a reservation and that we would be a group of 8 instead of 10.  We told the host.  He asked if we'd like to wait for the rest of our party & we said no.  He told us to wait while he went to find out where they wanted us.

Question 1:  Why give us the option of waiting or not waiting if you're going to tell us to wait anyway?

Question 2:  Why was a table not ready for us when we were prompt for our 6:30 pm reservation?  (You might think it's because we went from 10 to 8...  see #2 to find out why that's not the case.)

#2 - By the time the host figured out where we were going, the rest of our party had arrived.  One of the 2 kids in our group made a b-line to a hugh booth right in front & I laughed that he found our table.  The host said we could sit there.  I said no that's ok.  (Really I didn't want us all to be stuck in a big long booth)  He proceeded to take us around the corner to a booth of the exact same style.  Far bigger than a party of 8 needed.  I hesitated as some of our party sat & started sliding in.  Then the host said, ""We have a TABLE for 8 over here if you'd rather have that.""  Like I said, the place was not busy at all.  We agreed that would be better  (thank goodness since we wound up being there so long, we all got up more than once).

#3 - The server took our drink order and by that time, we all also had our food orders ready.  About 20 minutes later, we still hadn't gotten our drinks (just basic beverages, no cocktails) and had to ask if they were coming.  We were all talking, so I hadn't realized it was so long until my guy asked her about it.  It still took a while, like this was the first effort that was put into getting them.

#4 - A few of us had ordered salads.  A different server brought those out & there was much confusion getting them to the right people.  He just didn't seem to be listening when we told him where they went.

#5 - 7:30 pm (an hour in) and no food.  We also had 2 kids in our group.  Here's a tip for all restaurant management...  bring out the kids meals asap!  Crayons will only get you so far (about 5 minutes in my experience).  It was probably about 10 minutes later our food started arriving...  4 meals of the 8 were brought out...  2 burgers, steak & my tortellini.  It took a few more minutes before 3 more meals (ribs & the kids meals) were brought out...  still missing 1, my guy's tortellini.  It seemed to take them a couple minutes to realize.  Especially strange since we both had the same entree.

#6 - My guy got a couple fries from another person at our table & mentioned they seemed cold.  She said they were and that her steak was way over done.  I realized my pasta seemed dry on top and cold, as if it had been sitting.  His tortellini finally arrived and also looked dry.  The top pieces were also scorched, most likely from a heat lamp.  One of the burgers came with a baked potato, which was so cold it couldn't be eaten.

#7 - After all this, I went to the front to ask for a manager.  It took a few minutes for him to make his way to me.  I explained the situation and began to walk back to our table so he could come handle it with the whole group.  He didn't budge.  After explaining everything that happened, all he said was, ""does she want the steak re-done?""  I said, ""Let's go talk to them.""  He told me he'd be right there and ran off in another direction.

I'm pretty patient.  However, after hearing how messed up things were, I'd expect it to be addressed promptly.  Suddenly, I was no longer hungry.  I was done.

#8 - After at least 5 minute (likely more), the manager got to our table.  He seriously did not seem to know how to handle this.  He just asked if we wanted our meals re-done or to order something else.  Remember, we already waited over an hour to get cold, overcooked, dry meals!  No mention of taking any of them off the bill at this point either.

The delay in him addressing us & his inability to offer up a satisfactory solution indicated he was inept in handling this kind of situation.  He wound up taking a couple meals off the bill, only after I told him he needed to (someone else was paying, so it wasn't for my benefit, only to make it as right as it could be) AND he initially argued about one of the suggestions.  Frankly, by this time the whole situation was so awful, even comping the whole bill would have only vaguely been satisfactory.

In the end, my guy & I had eaten nothing but the extra side salads we ordered (thank goodness) and we wound up being there another hour for the steak meal to be completely re-done and that person finished eating alone.

In short, stay away!",bjsZPthav8K7sRKGqvX6ug,4,0,1,0xtGHR0O1zETqRogI5NEQQ

655432,2016-11-25,1,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"We decided to try Claim Jumper for Thanksgiving this year with a party of 9 people. We had made our reservations for 5pm. We were seated at about 5:20pm, no big deal we had a cocktail at the bar and everyone was enjoying themselves. We sat down ordered drinks and the server returned and said "" hate to be the bearer of bad news but we are out of turkey"", of course we all thought he was joking but unfortunately he was not joking. No turkey, so they offer a choice of Prime Rib, Tri-tip, Salmon or shrimp dinners. Everyone chose the prime rib. 6 of the 9 prime ribs came out undercooked so we sent them back and they returned overcooked 1 person ate theirs anyway and 5 did not eat at all. We asked for the General manager and he arrived about 10 minutes later. After my son explained what had happened he removed 5 meals from the bill. The problem is that this was our Thanksgiving dinner. On a normal night I can forgive a restaurant for having a bad night, but to be out of Turkey on Thanksgiving is absolutely ridiculous and unforgivable. To say the Claim Jumper ruined our Holiday Dinner is an understatement. We actually felt bad for the server who had deal with the incompetence of the kitchen and his managers.

Restaurant was clean and awesome decor.  

Food was good. Fish was dry or oily. The Tortalini was awesome so was the flat breaded shrip. Wowow!! Zuchini tasted like acid. Everything else was average. 

Service wasn't so great. Again. I have been here three times with friend. Each time its the same. The servers barely spend any time at table. Very impersonal. Which is okay if you meet the steps of service but they don't. 

Joe was our server this time. I don't really fault him because he was really trying to do a good job.  I was certain it was his first or second day but the manager told me he was their top server. Maybe just an off night.. My main suggestion to him would be to slow down.. with 4 tables you should be able to spend more time and talk to your guest more and more frequently. We looked for him many times but wasn't around. 

Server did not know menu. Food or drink. We asked for a miller lite.. he asked ""on draft or bottle"" we picked draft.. then came back to tell us they were ""out"" when I walked out I noticed there was no draft for miller lite. I can't say i have never done the same but after a few years in the service business I learned it is worth what it takes to know the menu to the best you can so you don't have to guess or lie. 

We asked about the flavor of one of the dishes.. he said he would ask the manager.. He should know the flavors of the food.. and all the employees should taste the food (free of charge to them) frequently. 

Food arrived at different times. (my biggest dining pet peeve). 
Sent an app back. Never saw it again. Showed up 20 minutes after we waved em down and asked for it. Same with fish. 

Table was unbussed through out. water went empty a couple of times, no biggy.

Manager was aware of the many issues and really did nothing. I was surprised. When one of the guests at my table said their fish was bad.. he said ""maybe you got a bad one, let us recook it"" which is okay but really it would have been nice to be given the choice of a different dish. He seemed he wanted to do more but his hands were tied. The corporate big wigs should let them comp when things go wrong. .Then we would be back knowing it will be good in the end. you know?  I don't mind paying full price, at all, that's why I came.. even tipped good. But it's good to say ""hey, were better than this, let us make it right.""

I was in a group of 10 people. The waiter came to take our drink order and left without getting 2 people's order. When he delivered our drinks, he didn't realize his mistake and didn't get them drinks until he came back for our food order. Then he refilled our glasses with the wrong beverages. The restaurant was pretty empty so I expected the service to be a bit more attentive.

I ordered the club sandwich and a salad. My salad was wilted, over-dressed, and the vegetables tasted like they had been out at room temperature for most of the day. My sandwich was equally disappointing. I honestly ordered it because the picture in the menu made it look so appetizing with fresh lettuce and tomato layered thick with the meat and cheeses. The skimpy lettuce and tomato were wilted. The avocado I paid to add was tough and flavorless. The bacon on the sandwich looked to be a pre cooked product that they didn't even bother to reheat before putting on my sandwich.

He also had a heads up about two of the guests having birthdays.

We also waited ridiculously long for our appetizer and starter salads. By the time that we received our appetizer, half of the group had already received their entree.

I think the rating would look very different on either. I hope that makes sense, so I'll choose the rating at the end of this.

Food.. this is standard American.  I've been here a few times with coworkers during lunch and it takes forever. It will eat your entire hour and then some, I know it's busy, I know it's not fast food, but sometimes it is hella slow and sometimes you are just making it back.  We've gotten burgers here, the artichoke and spinach dip, I learned a trick to call ahead and get their gluten free pizza, and then bring it back to the office.  I was really surprised, Claim Jumper has the best gluten free pizza at any chain I've ever been to.  It's worth remembering for that alone.  

This was weird, the other week a friend from work and I walked in and were told the wait was 15-20 minutes for a table but the bar was open seating and serving the full menu.  We sat at the bar and waited, I went back up front and grabbed a couple menus so we could look through it until the bartender got to us, and she immediately requested our ID's... which I thought was weird since we hadn't ordered alcohol and we're both obviously over 21.  I thought that was necessary specifically if you were ordering alcohol.  My friend left her bag at the office since I was buying lunch and didn't have her ID on her, but she's obviously of age, and regardless we just wanted lunch.  We ended up going to Brio.  Oh well.

Earlier this month, my girlfriend and I visited Las Vegas and we picked up a taxi to take us to Town Square. Our driver was a friendly guy and he mentioned that Town Square was very nice place and that he and his wife always eat at Claim Jumper every time they go. He even made sure to mention that he always orders the meat loaf.

We don't have a Claim Jumper in Hawaii and the name made me instantly curious. We made our rounds at the mall and we stopped in Claim Jumper to have lunch. 

Our server was a friendly guy and he made sure to stop by our table often to check up on us. He made some suggestions about the menu and away we went. This is what we ordered.

-Meatloaf. For the first time, I took a recommendation about food from a taxi driver. This meatloaf was awesome. It was better than my mom's and please don't tell her that. It was juicy, tender and tasty. It came with some awesome mashed potatoes and asparagus. 

-Shrimp stuffed jalapeno. Wow. These guys were huge. And tasty. And awesome. We got the six piece order and should have gotten the four. Someone could easily order the four and have that as a meal. 

-New England Clam Chowder in a Bread Bowl. This is what my gf ordered. Now, I""m not a fan of clam chowder but the one they serve here is pretty damn good. 

The food here is awesome and so is the service. I wish they had one where I live because the menu is so diverse and there's a ton of stuff that I'd love to try.

Food came out. Ok, I already knew Claim Jumper was just, meh. But we ate there because it was close and easy....But believe me I won't make that mistake again....

The artichoke dip was gross. We both took about 3 bites from it.  The chips were pretty good though :D.

My soup, had the look and taste of friggin Velveta. VELVETA! Did someone seriously poor Nacho Cheese in my soup? It was horrible. I also loved my garnish of a huge piece of wilting parsley. Mmm.  
The only thing I ate and actually enjoyed was the cheesy bread. OOoh that was some yumminess.

My friend ordered the vegetable soup which was WAY too salty. 

I suppose this isn't the best way to review a business like Claim Jumpers because usually their soups aren't house and are frozen and defrosted...I'm not sure if this is the case..

Either way, the next time we saw our server is when the cutsey little lady asked if we wanted anything else and we asked for the check...she took our card and our waiter returned it and said his good byes.

Ordered two lemon drop martinis.....(sigh) hold the lemon seeds please!!!! Yes, I am in the industry, but bar tending 101 = know how to make a martini!!!!

2018071,2017-02-04,1,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"Well this was my second time eating here and I have realized that this restaurant is poorly managed. After reading previous reviews, it's clear that some of these people don't have experience working in the food industry, because the empty tables with a long wait time has to do with the amount of servers working at the time. 
I didn't have a problem with the seating, however, the service was unacceptable. As a former town square Tommy Bahama restaurant employee, I am well aware of the customer service that a thriving and growing restaurant is capable of providing. 
     I came in on Friday February 3 around 9:15 for happy hour. We sat in the bar, which was pretty empty for a Friday night. There was a few two-tops and one couple seated at the bar. The female bartender was a woman with long dark hair and the managers were two middle-aged men with short dark hair. They almost seemed to be floor supervisors to me--due to their lack of professionalism and attention to guests being served undercooked food.  I ordered the pulled pork street tacos and the fried pickles and peppers plate. After ordering drinks, my boyfriend and I moved to a table because we wanted some privacy. We were now seated at a high top table closer to the main entrance of the restaurant but still in the bar area. After moving to the table, the female bartender didn't come to our table at all. Not even once. We asked Peter the super cool busser for bread which he brought immediately and it was great! We had to keep asking the male bartender who looked like he had already been cut and closing up, for anything we needed. The food runner brought out our food and my pickles and peppers plate was very hot-which indicated to me that it had been sitting in the expo window for a while. So I'm guessing the expo line must not have had their tickets in order because my street tacos plate was cool and seemed to be freshly plated. So after receiving our food we felt much Better. My boyfriend ordered the widow maker burger and it was delicious!! Great price during happy hour. 
     So I began eating my pickles which were amazing at first. I found a fried orange slice in the mix so I was confused and began digging through the plate to find out if it was intentionally cooked in the dish(which it was) and I just set them aside because I wasn't interested in eating a fried orange slice(peel as well) and I immediately lost my appetite after completely examining my dish. I found an orange and pickle stuck together in a big chunk so I broke them apart with my fork. The orange had a hunk about an inch thick of raw fry batter. Obviously food-borne illnesses is not something I take lightly.  As I said before, the female bartender didn't come back to our table at all, so my boyfriend decided to get up and bring the plate to the bar. He told the bartender what we found and she said ""oh ok, do you want me to have them make you another one?"" Which obviously, I'm not in the mood for after just almost eating raw batter. So we told her to just take it off of our bill. Which she did, after she went over to the expo line and spoke with the two managers for about five minutes. Then all three of them came walking back to the bar-the female went up to the register and the two male managers stood outside the bar and spoke to her for about ten minutes before anyone acknowledged the issue at hand. I figured a manager would come and talk with us about the raw food we were just served, but they continued to talk with her and laugh and joke around and it seemed as if they were so consumed in her that neither of them thought it was necessary to come speak to us about our meal. 
     Finally I sent my boyfriend up to the bar AGAIN to tell her we wanted our check. She agreed and brought us the check. After talking it over with my boyfriend, we decided that she does not deserve a tip due to the lack of customer service and attentiveness. If she had been attentive and helpful and concerned with our meal we would have thought differently. She didn't seem to care at all and the kitchen obviously has issues and the management(supervisors or actual managers) couldn't even recognize a serious health hazard, (which will be reported to the health department) or even offer a simple apology. For this- I feel very sorry for the team at the Claim Jumper Town Square restaurant.  I'm sure none of the management team will recognize this review because they didn't seem to care about our entire situation last night. Try getting a bartender with a brain or a management/supervisory team that cares more about the customers than trying to flirt with their own employee all night.",QFZsC0HTuFCuKUjpxN6Lng,0,0,1,zep9BeTrJ9K46grcurSMZw

May the list commence: An aloof waitress who forgot my drink order until I reminded the girl who brought our food out; a hamburger with a stale bun not cooked to order; a cold baked potato; wings that had a fishy taste to them; oh, and our food came out in ten minutes. Do you know the only way that miraculous feat was accomplished? A microwave. Trust me, you can tell.

Enough with these big, ""hearty"" portions of shit food. Shit food is exactly that. If you must go to a place like Claim Jumper, make it TGI Fridays. Their happy hour never ends and at least their burgers aren't microwaved.",YZGYvsJbWVOqQXKnlPuMBw,1,0,1,0Qi3SxH6f50PvBDb7Sd56A

However, when the hostess led us to the table, I looked around the restaurant, to find more than half of the tables empty. I furious. We waited 45 minutes for what?

On top of that, our waiter was absentminded and forgot a lot of basic things that we had to keep asking him for. We asked him three times for more bread, and he never got back to us. We had to ask another waiter, only to find that they were still in the oven. 

It's a shame that their management and customer service were utter disappointment, because we actually really enjoyed all our dishes.

They had the best breading...but NOT anymore.  The prime rib is now gone off the menu, the garlic cheese bread is nothing to write home about, and the bleu cheese wedge is also gone.  They changed the zuchini and onion ring breading to a more floury, flaky recipe...and it was already perfect.  We ate there today for lunch, and Brad said he is never going to eat there again.  I eat there typically on Wed for a playdate with my son...but since the change, we have started searching for other venues.  My friend Laura used to order a salad off of the lunch menu.  When she ordered it they would ask if she wanted Jamaican style chicken or grilled.  The last time she ordered it they didn't ask...and she didn't notice, but figured out when she was done with her meal.  She said, I knew something was different, they didn't put chicken on it.

When we first walked in, there was no one at the host desk so we decided to sit at the bar. We were then greeted by the bartenders & they offered us to sit at a booth on the other side of the bar. Once we had a seat at the table they offered, the table was extremely sticky. You could tell it hasn't been wiped. 

We ordered the lemon pepper zucchini to start off with while we looked through the menu. They gave us the happy hour menu also, even though it wasn't happy hour. 

The zucchini came as soon as we were done ordering out entrees. Pretty fast. We ordered the roasted tri tip with a Caesar salad & the stuffed BBQ shrimp that was on the happy hour menu. 

We waited on our entree for about 30 minutes and it didn't look very appetizing. Also, veggies were more on the colder side. So you cantell it's been sitting at the window for a while. 

Once our entree was almost done, the BBQ stuffed shrimp finally comes out & it looked like crap. I don't even know why I ate it. I don't know if they were rushing for closing but the presentation on the plate was horrible. 

And to top everything off.... When we first got there, I asked our server what time the shops closed & he said they closed at 9:30pm on Sundays.

Hours after posting my original review I received a call from a manager of Claim Jumper.  He told me that I had posted my review on his restaurant in error but seemed genuinely concerned with our experience that prompted my horrible, but accurate review.  I was extremely apologetic that I had not been more prudent to make sure I had the correct restaurant, even offering to get back on Yelp! to correct the error so it would not reflect poorly on his establishment.  He assured me that was not necessary as a Claim Jumper is a Claim Jumper and this review had him concerned.  He told me he was passing this on to the district manager and that I would hear back from said district manager later in the day.

Fast forward two and a half weeks, I've never heard a peep from anyone else.  Its no wonder to me that management failed to correct the issues while we were dining with them.  Clearly, the district manager isn't upset about the service they are providing so why would management, and in turn their staff, do anything to correct their deficiencies.  

The kicker?  I just signed on Yelp from my computer so I could correct my error anyway because I'm a decent person that way.  According to Claim Jumpers website this location IS the location that I reviewed.  So either Yelp! has somehow crossed something on their end, or the gentlemen who called me was too ashamed to admit it was HIS restaurant.  I suppose either of those is understandable.

Chocolate Chip Calzone $7.99

My wife and I came here after going to the Apple Store to fix my phone. The setting reminded me of Tony Roma's. The chowder was great. They make their soups daily and it tasted like it; very fresh and a good ratio of potatoes/vegetables to clams. I love scooping a piece of the sourdough on the bottom of the bowl and eating it with the soup. The ribs and chicken entree came with a side salad, roasted vegetables, and rice as our starch. The ribs tasted similar to Tony Roma's but more on the smokey side whereas TR is a little on the sweet side. Both meats were very tender and the vegetables were quite flavorful. They were a little greasy however bc they use the leftover roasted meat juices/oils as the flavoring. The chocolate chip calzone was BROKE DA MOUTH (again, excuse my hawaiian accent)!. Warm and gooey in the center, the calzone pieces came with ice cream which helped to tame the sweetness. The feeling reminded me of eating a ice cream sandwich in the most comforting way. This dessert goes on my top 5 of best desserts in vegas (along with the Sticky Toffee Pudding at GR pub). Overall, the food here was very good and they have a great happy hour menu.

2364132,2014-11-03,0,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"My family was in town the first weekend in November for my nephew's university graduation. We chose Claim Jumper as our one special celebration meal together (there were 15 of us). It was so disappointing.

We had been driving all day and the kids were starving. Our waiter was slow, impatient, and incompetent. He rolled his eyes at us several times. He spent too much time trying to pressure us into buying some card for regulars even though we don't even have Claim Jumpers in our state.

He messed up over half the orders. For instance, my nephew's wife never got part of her meal, and the kids never got their drinks. My nephew asked for no onions and got onions. He forgot to ask what side I wanted, and blamed it on me 20 minutes later: ""You didn't tell me what you wanted."" He didn't give me a chance. 20 more minutes after that, he informed me that they were out of what I ordered and shoved a menu at me. I chose the chili in a bread bowl that he highly recommended, and got chili without a bread bowl. My sister-in-law barely touched her food because it wasn't good. We are not a picky group! By then we were starving and even though we were right by his POS station, we rarely saw him and couldn't get his attention, so we made do with what we got. The chili he highly recommended tasted like canned Nalley chili with some chunks of meat thrown in.

Then he couldn't split our check, even though we told him at the beginning that we would have separate checks. He was huffy and impatient as we told him again who was together, and since we'd been there so long my brother finally told him we'd work it out on our own. He rudely said, ""Good, because see what I'm dealing with?"" and showed us some crazy chicken scratch diagram he made. He was clearly not trained or qualified or something when it came to serving a big group. 

When we analyzed the check, I saw that he had charged us for my original meal that they were out of, plus the one I ordered to replace it (which wasn't right either, but I ate it). It took at least 15 minutes to find him and bring it to his attention, and then he was huffy and abrupt about it. I got a half-apology but no offer to make it up to us in any way. We contemplated going to the manager but we were exhausted and just wanted to go to our hotel.

I hope that was an unusual experience, because I honestly have never had such rude and incompetent service in my life. I know that food service is hard work and I try to give waitstaff the benefit of the doubt, but there was no excuse for his sloppy waiting and especially his rude attitude. 

Thankfully, my nephew took me afterward to the other side of town to get the best street taco I've ever had. :) Next time I visit him in Vegas, I'll definitely avoid Claim Jumper.",NjEvjbwsm6EaiIsgrmLzqA,3,0,1,8vZMhZMkdZ0kftynFUwXmg

Ordered:
Fish Tacos
I've been here numerous times just this year... figured it's time to actually review it.  Am I am fan?  Most definitely.. Why else would I keep coming back?

Pros:
  Another familiar chain at the Town Square.  What an awesome location!
  Very good happy Hour.  Cheap Eats doesn't always mean subpar food.
  Friendly staff.  Every time I have came staff always engage in convo.
  Flat Screens throughout the bar.  There isn't a bad seat in the bar.

Cons:
  Chips were stale.  What a disappointment.
  The entire bar area had a popcorn smell.
  
Verdict:
  Okay, so my chips were stale, but overall this is an awesome place to go eat... especially during happy hour.  Even when you are not in the bar and are eating here, it's really good.  If you've never been to a Claim Jumpers, make sure to check it out!  The portions are gigantic and the quality of the food is pretty impressive in my opinion.  I haven't had anything that I didn't care for (aside from the stale chips).  I'd definitely come again.

Tips:
  Looking for cheap eats and a place to catch sports? Look no more !
  Do not eat at the bar early lunch... they make popcorn and the whole bar area smells of its scent.  It was messing with my taste buds.  If I want popcorn I'll go to Rave.
  Come during happy hour.  Everyone often goes to Yard House (which is also good for happy hour, but is extremely crowded).  Claim Jumpers is less crowded.

It happened twice and when the whole zucchini stick fell she just grabbed it with her bare hands and put it back in the plate without apologies.

Their price is fair since their food is delicious and portioned ! I ordered the sirloin steak, medium rare with baked potato as a side. My friend ordered the same but with sautéed onions and mushrooms and mashed potatoes. Highly recommended. We both couldn't finish our foods with how big their portions were.

Calamari wasn't bad, sauce needed some help, but the squid was breaded nicely. Coconut shrimp was horrible.... Obviously frozen and neglected, the shrimp looked beat up and flat thin...

Why would you buy 8 wide screen hi def TV's and only be able to tune them all to same channel? Why would those same TV's be individually numbered? 

I believe the reason this happened is either the bartender has no idea that the TV's can be individually tuned or she doesn't care. I suspect the former. 

Order a 10 dollar Cadillac Margarita. A Cadillac Margarita is a super premium cocktail and should be made accordingly. This one was WAY too sweet. Like, way too much sweet and sour.

Parking is annoying at Town Center if you want to go to any place in the middle of the square.

We went here because we looked up the gluten free menu online and we were close because we picked up a visiting relative who was staying on the strip.
The online and store menu says the buffalo wings are gluten free but when we asked at the restaurant, we were told they were cooked in the same oil as the french fries, which are NOT gluten free.
My daughter was disappointed because she was looking forward to trying them.
She got the potato skins instead.

The calzone was HUGE but only because the bread had risen up with hot air.  Once I stabbed into it and let the air out there wasn't much to it except bread.  Taste was good though.
Gluten free hamburger bun was very good...better than some other buns we've tried.
Chicken Wrap, very good.
Pork wings, very good
Grits, very good

Recommend removing the buffalo wings from the gluten free section.  Celiac is a very sensitive disease and my daughter is very, very allergic to wheat (gluten).  I'm glad we asked about the wings before we ordered them.  I know there is a disclaimer on the menu that says it's not a gluten free restaurant, which is fine, but if something is listed as gluten free, there are ways in the kitchen to eliminate cross contamination of gluten.  I am happy there is an attempt at Claim Jumper to accommodate those with food allergies and I thank you for that.",uTS919xmOAJt6tAzu_bVIg,0,0,3,OVWRUGQ_2VlorEhw8hH-Ew
3104034,2011-04-10,0,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"The Lady craved the Whiskey Glazed Chicken as we drove away from the house and still hadn't decided where we were going to eat. So she say's ""Miller Ale House, or Claim Jumper?"" I hate picking, because she's pregnant and I don't want to pick the wrong one, and I'll find something to eat pretty much anywhere so it's her choice. We decide on Claim Jumper, and I was happy to oblige her craving.

We walk in on Saturday night at about 815 and go into the bar and sit at one of the booths.  A plus that we pulled up and a car pulled out of one of the spots right in front of the entrance, so we pulled in and noticed there was still 15 minutes left in the meter.  +1.  A cute server promptly brought us waters and a couple menus and asked how we were doing this Saturday night. so +1 for friendliness.

We scoured the menus and she had already decided what she was getting, so it took me just a minute to find my country fried steak which is almost always what I get at a place like this. (Mimi's, Applebee's, Chili's, etc). We ordered and asked her opinions of the two items we got and she said they are both excellent, the chicken was bone-in and the country fried steak was GINORMOUS and that it's the size of the plate. (there is a light version of you don't want to eat the plate size portion).  If you've been to Claim Jumper you might know how big the plates are here. 

The food was spot on for me. The lady was disappointed in the chicken, it used to be 3 or 4 chicken breasts with the glaze and apples all over the meat, now it's a big breast/thigh piece with a million bones and by the time she was done she had a pile of bones and skin bigger than the actual amount of chicken she consumed, it was a pain in the a** picking all the chicken off and it's wasted pounds by serving it bone-in. But knowing about the restaurant industry a little, we understand with the economy slowish, it's cheaper for restaurants to buy bulk whole pieces like this instead of pre-made breasts ready to serve. Each came with a choice of side, I got the bacon mac n cheese and she got the baked potato. Both were really good, it's pretty tough to mess up a baked potato and the mac was nice, nothing amazing, but good. The steak was huge, she wasn't kidding, I can eat and I barely finished half of it, but it's nice cause now I have leftovers and leftover country fried steak is delicious.  She said the chicken had a good taste and the apples hit the spot.
I had a beer and we split a cup of french onion soup. Bill was $44 + tip which isn't bad considering we both brought food home. Soup was a little ridiculous priced, $5 for a little cup no matter how good it is is stupid, and the beer was $4.75 for a domestic bottle so that's a little high too.  All in all we had a nice dinner out. The place wasn't loud and annoying, the service was spot on and she did a great job so we tipped her well, and the food was very solid.

Since, my family and I had never been to a Claim Jumper's we decided to give it a try. The food looked and sounded amazing.  However, our experience was something out of a movie. 

We ordered the following;
-Chicken Fried Steak
-Porterhouse Steak

We happen to be seated in a booth across from longer booth (which accommodates roughly a party of six to eight people).  My family and I were watching their food being delivered.  Not surprisingly, I saw a plate of Chicken Fried Steak being served to that party.  The plate of Chicken Fried Steak was passed down through that entire party of eight. However, no one in that party ordered Chicken Fried Steak. My family and I decided to watch the particular plate and see where it ends up.  Since one of our orders was Chicken Fried Steak.  The server at that table brought the plate back to the kitchen, where the manager asks the chef to re-plate the Chicken Fried Steak.  

You know where this is going...

Our server put the 're-plated' Chicken Fried Steak on the serving tray along with our Porterhouse Steak. Before the server was able to take the plate off the tray, we asked him not to since we saw everything in the kitchen take place.  

The manager, Fred, came over to talk to us and about the situation. He offered to re-make the dish, but at this point we didn't trust him, since he asked the chef to re-plate the Chicken Fried Steak. We decided to just share the Porterhouse. 

The server was brave enough to come back and apologize for what happen.  He said, if he had known about the 're-plate' he wouldn't have brought it out. 

The manager, Fred, came back over and said he reported the incident to the regional office (on a early Sunday evening).  Which, doesn't really do anything for the customer. Needless to say, Fred asked what he could do for us, 'Do you want a piece of cake?' We then responded with 'We want our checked cleared.' 

He finally came back a for the last time and cleared our check.

The chicken tenders used to be so good but now they taste bland, no flavor just quickly thrown into flour then fried. My husbands sandwich had avocados that were extremely mushy and over ripe.

Our service was also what I'd expect from a chain; decent, but no one is going out of their way.

We ordered a kid's Pinapple-Coconut Slushie, but when our server came back with our waters we found out that they were out of both the Pinapple and strawberry flavors, so we could not order any of the three slushies they offer.  Seems that would be something they would inform servers about...  Not a huge deal, but when you tell a 4 year old they are getting something, then can't produce, it's not the most fun conversation.

You cannot order a specific doneness on the meat, it comes medium rare to medium, and you get what you get.  Our order included some that was med. rare and some that was well done.  The meat was pretty good, not tough, and the peppercorn demi-glace added a nice demension.  A little more consistently to the cooking would have been nice though.  The chicken was moist.  Nothing special, but decent.  Broccoli: over cooked and dry.  Zucchini, carrot, onion mix: fine, but a bit bland.

As a rule I start disliking chains before I even step foot in them. Just a rule I maintain; maybe I am a hipster. 

Anyway, I have always felt that CJ sucked (probably because they do). And this particular location takes the cake. 

Be prepared for the slowest, most uninspired/lackadaisical 'service' known to humankind. This is almost so bad that one starts imagining that it is a hidden camera-'reality tv' show that one is an unknown party to. I am waiting to sign a fucking waiver at the end of my meal over here.

One starts to ask oneself: ""Is this going to be on TruTV or something? Hidden Camera-Secret Diner-Bad Bar-Restaurant Rescue-Storage crossover?"" 

I mean: for fucks sake. Get your shit together!

We have all been to hole-in-the-walls where you know you ain't getting crumbs brushed off the fucking table service. But this place ... this Claim Jumper is worse than any hole-in-the-wall I have ever been to. And I have been to Mejico (real Mejico, not Cancun or whatever the fuck). I said Mejico!

Food sucks; service sucks; and I feel I am surrounded by so-called Yuppies on every occasion I go there. (Could be more of a Town Square problem.)

The atmosphere was nice and the waitress provided nice service for our party of 7 which can be a lot of work I am sure.  The challenge is that the food is really unremarkable.  It feels like they are trying to do to much, and in the process they create mediocrity for the masses.  The other thing that stands out is that portion size seems to matter more than quality.

I got the Shrimp Fresca Pasta which was priced at $19.99.  There were 6 butterflied shrimp that had been breaded and deep fried with a bed of noodles and a lemon cream sauce.  The pasta was ok, but the shrimp were inconsistent with some being slightly dried out.

It was not a culinary disaster, but I will certainly fight harder if I am with a group that is selecting a restaurant again to try something else.",R9elLEhg3gEA_P7KQ-GuyA,0,0,3,pQISHKfvDrvTKpvjYyBfjw

It seemed like the ingredients were being skimped on because the overall taste was nowhere close to the quality of their food 5 years ago.  Although this location was better then the one in Henderson and for sure the one in Summerlin, I doubt we'll be back unless I hear about some raving reviews.  

Started off with the Lemon Pepper Zucchini.  Pretty good even though the batter would not stay on.  The ranch dressing was excellent though!  My husband ordered the Widow Maker burger which he said was good.  He ordered it with a side of the green beans-also good.  I ordered the Cobb sandwich which was a disappointment.  They no longer use a whole chicken breast-instead it was shaved cooked chicken, the avocado was skimpy and I did not taste the bite of blue cheese AT ALL!  The shoestring fries were good and the portion was large.  

My niece ordered off the kid menu which had a great selection. She had pasta with an alfredo sauce, apples with caramel, and mandarin orange slices.  She liked her meal.  

Service was great though.  The servers were very attentive and our orders came quickly.  I would give CJ 4 stars based on service alone but the quality of food has definitely regressed gradually the last few years...",tAcY4S3vIuNlAoRlCcz5VA,3,1,2,88nqvZ886tlttAQtc23CgQ

I'm so upset I gave Claim Jumpers my business!! 
I held a rehearsal dinner here and had a party of 40, I get its a lot, but it was also planned in advance. I called a month prior to make reservations and then picked a menu from the catering menu. The communication up until the time of my event was great! That being said I thought service would be amazing.. *rolling my eyes*

My party & I arrived at the time which was discussed, we sat in the patio area. I was told the table would be all together. There were several 4 top tables through out the room facing different directions (not what I discussed but its fine)
2 waiters were assigned to my party to assist us.. slow slow slow!
1 person would order, they would go back and get it, another would order so on and so forth.
The whole night lasted like this, example 1 person at the table would be getting their salad while the other one already ate theirs, and was half way through dinner.
I got up spoke to a manger who assured me she would be able to steer the boat around and take control...

Long story short, slow service (both servers and at bar), cold food, poor customer service.

Only reason I would go back is to walk by when I'm in town square",gM48Zp5QA1JYunSN5WVtqQ,6,1,2,jgfxdbR2ksfBXwFIVBkhgw

Unfortunately once I got it the salmon was so small, slim, and there was NO chunks of crab. I could of gone to smiths and bought 3 times what they gave me for what they charged me.

4042141,2015-06-17,7,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"Now Ive been to this particular location a handful of times and every experience Ive had has been less than desirible.

One time we were seated in the bar area, and it wasn't on a game night or a holiday. I dont know if they were just incredibly understaffed or their servers were just extremely undertrained but after we got our food and drink orders we never got talked to again. We waited probably thirty minutes trying to flag someone down to get a refil on our beers before we just gave up and walked to the front to ask for our check.

Next time we came with two of our close friends (one of which used to work for a Claim Jumper in San Diego for over a year) and we got seated, and waited. And waited. And waited. And waited. Now twenty minutes has gone by and our server hasnt even been over to our table to greet us...? Everyone around us is getting greeted and helped and even parties who have been seated after us are getting taken care of and were just sitting there still with no service not even a hello or a water. Finally one of us got up and asked a server if they could help us. We had to ask to be helped so we could spend money in their establishment. That really blows my mind.

We just came a few days ago with our family and our experince was completely mediocre, but compared to the way weve been treated here in the past it was a huge step up.

We opted for the bar area, because we didn't want to wait. There was only one server responsible for the entire bar area and so the service was a little slow. She was still very friendly but you could notice that she was a little stressed. 

I also tried one of their darker drafts. It had really good strong flavors, which I love in a beer. But unfortunately I cannot remember the name anymore. 

I had the Original Tri-Tip Dip, which is according to their menu description ""Slow-roasted and simmered in French onion broth with caramelized onions, roasted pasilla peppers and smoked gouda on a French roll with au jus or sweet BBQ sauce"" - O.K. I think this says it all. This sandwich was delicious. My husband ended up eating more of mine than his own food, which was one of the burgers.

4063518,2017-02-27,5,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"Location 5/5:

This location is ideal. Located at Town Square right beside the Children's park/play area. Not much for parking in front of the restaurant, but there are plenty of parking in the garages and parking lots, which aren't too far of a walk.  

Food 4/5:

Come if you are hungry and have a big appetite. Their portions are huge!! Too much for one person to have on their own. I normally just ordered off the appetizer menu. Which in my opinion seemed like a normal size at any other restaurant. At least you know you're getting your money's worth. 

They always start you off with bread, which is tasty. Mine have always been fresh and warm.  For some reason, I thought the first time I came here, that they also gave you butter with your bread, but I guess not. Sometimes the waitress/waiter forgets to bring it to you, so you have to ask for it if you want it. 

One of my favorite things to get here are their wings. They have several flavors to choose from, my favorite being the Asian Spicy BBQ. All their wings come with carrots and celery and your choice of ranch or blue cheese. Price is $14.99 or $8.99 for a smaller portion. 

Another favorite is their chicken pot pie. This thing is huge!! Easily can be shared between two people. Comes with a small green or Caesar salad or cup of soup for $16.99.

Their salads are also very good. House and Chinese Chicken salads are my favorite. They do a good job at making sure they're isn't too much of any one thing in the salads. If you want extra of something, just ask. I can't recall if they charge more for extra though. Salads range in price from $8.99 for the basic salads up to $17.99 for their most expensive one. 

One more item on their menu I'd like to mention. They have some really good fish tacos. Not the best I've ever had, but still good enough to mention. The Fish tacos are drizzled in a Chipotle sauce topped with Pico de Gallo and served with rice. Cost of this is $13.99

Service 3/5:

Service here is just average. You will be seated right away, as long as it isn't the weekend, but once seated you may have to wait awhile before someone comes and takes your order. Any time that I've been here, they always seem short staffed. There's one person for a whole bunch of tables, which makes it hard for them to be efficient and tend to their tables in a timely manner. The staff are nice, just too busy to really seem like they care. I'd just suggest to hire more staff members. 

Depending on time of day and how many people they have, you can wait on your food from 15-45 minutes. I tried to come during non rush hours, but I still waited at times for nearly an hour for a simple dish. 

Overall, I really like this spot and wouldn't mind coming back again when I'm back in Vegas :)",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,9,11,4,CEFi5jmbLxpCW2UQcqTg5g

4260152,2011-12-20,0,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"Our Christmas Luncheon on friday was held here. I chose this place for our family of companies, for a few good reasons (plus they didn't want to to go on the Strip): excellent food (everything is good), large generous portions, reasonable prices, and dependable restaurant chain with upscale rustic cabin decor/theme. And the multi-layered chocolate cake is delish (I'm not a chocoholic but I can still appreciate it)- but everyone was full, so we didn't get dessert (unsmiley face). I'm very familiar (appetizers, turkey sandwich, soup bowl, salads, etc.) with this restaurant chain (my old boss would take me here a lot). There are three locations (summerlin, henderson), and I've been to all three, now. 

There were less than ten of us in our party. We shared the appetizer combo- onion rings (dusted with parmesan cheese- nice surprice, very yummy), chicken wings, artichoke, mozzarella sticks (huge, very good, one stick was enough!) on top of carrot and celery sticks accompanied with three sauces. Most of us chose entree from the Lunch Menu. I had the lunch size chinese chicken salad- came with a garlic cheese toast (my favorite thing here). I don't get this salad much because there are only two places that do this salad any justice, and this is my favorite place to get it! Even though, it's the lunch size, it's still pretty generous! It had the right amount of cilantro, and dressing- the chicken was on top, and the salad was mixed very well, too. It was yummy, but I couldn't finish it. Two people got the beef tips, that came with a generous amount of steamed vegetables. One person got the fish and chips- large plate! It looked enticing- I haven't had that in such a long time too (hmm, debating on getting this on christmas eve. One person got the rotisserie chicken with sweet potatoes. Funny story, one person in our party never had artichoke, so we ordered another one. Some people needed boxes for the rest of their food. 

We had a huge table (could barely pass things to people on the other side of the table), and it was in the center of the room- it wasn't crowded for lunch, but maybe because this is a large restaurant, it just looked like that to me. The service was excellent. We all got refills without asking. We all enjoyed the luncheon very much. Some of us parked in front of Whole Foods, and some of us parked in back of H & M- either way, it was nice to get some walking in (even in the wind), with all the calories we took in!  

Also, a bonus is that I'm a Landry's restaurant member, and I can rack up points at all the restaurants (Bubba Gump, Rain Forest Cafe, Claim Jumper, Chart House), but no, did not use my card at this time.

However, it was my experience, and certainly that of my colleagues that if you are looking for good food and decent service, this may not be the best choice.  OK, full disclosure, I was dying for something with some heat so I ordered the Korean Fried Chicken Pizza, so go ahead and factor that into my rating.

Service was great. Amber was eager to assist us and made sure we were taken care of before we could make any request.

My date and I were craving something warm on a chilly evening. She got a Sourdough Clam Chowder bowl (8.99) and I got a Chicken Pot Pie (12.99). The servings were huge.

The serve this delicious garlicky bread on the table that I had to taste, and regretted as it took up my main entree room. It was good though.  
I settled on the fish tacos with the pico on the side.   I got mine fried...but you can order grilled instead. It was good. They were crispy and on traditional corn tortillas with a good, creamy chipotle sauce on top. They had salsa on the side that I used instead of the pico and it was good. It came with a side of pilaf that was tasty too. 
I ordered a cream cheese pumpkin slice of pie to go, because who can pass up pumpkin this time of year. My friend tasted it and said it was very good...even sinful.  Can't wait to eat it later!

Service:  We had a cutie, young waiter with a very deep voice named Tom. He was friendly and helpful. 

Facility:  this place was nicely decorated and had a warm feel. The chairs we pretty comfortable with cushion on the wood and high backs.

Knowing what this restaurant has in store for special occasions, I made a prior reservation here and brought my parents to celebrate my mom's advance birthday after our first movie at the theater. We were quite the hungry Hannahs and contrary to our plan to share a couple of dishes, we picked an order each! 

Papa had the tenderloin tips served medium-well with a side of mashed potatoes and mixed vegetables presented in a decent portion for only $9.99. Meanwhile, mommy had the sandwich duo. This is a fun mix and match pickin'; you have a choice at half a sandwich (tuna albacore, cashew chicken, clubhouse, roasted turkey) with a side of either a salad or soup for only $7.99. She ordered the clubhouse with a side of potato cheddar soup (which was the bomb!) and an extra cesar salad which amounted to about $10 as well (not entirely sure about that) I, in turn, got myself the chopped steak. It's ground beef, almost bordering on thick beef patty, with a topping choice of either cheddar & tomato or glazed mushrooms and onions in burgundy sauce (I chose the latter) next to some mashed potato. I admit it was very filling, so much so I wasn't even able to take it all in. 

Before we ended, I buzzed our waiter a quick reminder about my mom's birthday and he came with their signature red velvet cupcake with a candle on top!

The menu isn't outstanding either. Just your run-of-the-mill American cuisine. Again, nothing I ordered was BAD. Just not worth raving about.

Tonight my husband and I went into the restaurant. We were told there would be a 10-15 minute wait, which took well over 20 for us to be called. This is despite the fact that there were MANY tables/booths open at the time.

After we were seated, it took more than 10 minutes for us to even be acknowledged by our server and then almost 10 minutes more for drinks to arrive on our table.

Throughout the meal, he was nice and all that, but still rather inattentive. Especially when it came time to get the check and I tried to give him my gift card, and he wandered off for another 10 minutes, leaving us to sit there awkwardly so we could get out and do the other stuff we wanted to do for the evening. 

The Whiskey Chicken was rather bland. Needed salt to flavor it up, which is bad considering how they advertised it in the menu. My husband's tri-tip steak was supposed to be medium rare, but was actually closer to well done. 

The dessert was ok. English toffee cake. I could make better at home, though. The best part of that sadly, was the ice cream that came with it.

All in all, the experience took over 90 minutes from the time we sat down until we left, and we're not slow eaters at all. I don't think we'll be returning in the future, since half the time we spent there was sitting around waiting to be served.

Update: After speaking with the manager, we received a gift card for ... half the amount we wasted on our meal. She told us to speak to her when we come in next time to ensure the experience is better. I will probably casually mention to her that I'm not happy about the fact that we wasted $50 only to get $25 back.

Looking at the menu beforehand, I was under the impression that this was another chain restaurant with a large menu. After dining here, my impression is basically the same, although I'd say Claim Jumper is a step above some of those other chains you'd visit.

To fuel myself for the race the following day, I decided to order the lighter portion of the black tie chicken pasta and a small green salad. My friend dined on a steak, mashed potatoes and veggies.

The alfredo sauce on the pasta wasn't all that great, but the blackened chicken mixed in with the pasta was pretty tasty.  My friend enjoyed her steak plate as well.

Looking around at other diners, they definitely seemed to be enjoying the desserts, which I think is more of the appeal of the restaurant, although we didn't partake in any of them. The chocolate cake looked ridiculously good though, as did the eclair.

We were seated right away and our waitress Krissy showed up seconds later to take our drink order.

In particular, the Meat Loaf with mashed was outstanding however the Rib Eye and Baby Back ribs were also very delicious.  

My only complaint would be nobody came by to refill our water glasses.  On the plus side, the General Manager was working and cleared our table of empty plates and asked how everything was going.  Very attentive service at this restaurant!!!!!!

Our dessert was kRaZy good!!!  Brownie Finale!!  FTW.  Outstanding!!  We all  shared it and there was plenty for four.  Great cap to a great evening that started off so poorly at a nearby competing restaurant.

Side notes:  Great atmosphere.  Great Service but could be more attentive to water glasses.  Great GM.  Great Basic Food.  Very comfortable and large tables to accommodate all the food they give you.

The service was very good but I can't really judge how different it would have been if I came here individually.  Its already a given that the service would be good since it was a company party willing to spend hundreds that night, so I can't really judge it fairly because of the situation. 

The dish I ordered was the roasted tri-tip. I must say, it was juicy and full of flavor. Came with mash potatoes and fried veggies. Overall, its as good as it gets compared to the other tri-tips I've had in the past.

For dessert, I ordered the brownie finale. It was soft, topped with melted chocolate on top and vanilla ice cream. It was very good  and if I wasn't such a diet freak, I would have finished the whole thing instead of just half of it.

So the rest of us had to suffer or leave. We did not finish our food. We left. The manager additionally told us that if we went online to landrys to submit s complaint  we'd only be shuffled back to him and he'd tell us the same thing again. Now our server Warren was nice and accommodating and this is not a reflection on him at all. The manager evidently can let one table run out numerous tables.

We were seated immediately and greeted by a young friendly lad named Jonathon. Jonathon suggested the Cookie Finale or Chocolate Chip Pizookie. The Cookie Finale won out and was more than enough for two (it comes with two giant cookies the size of my hand). I threw my towel in the ring halfway through my cookie and was infinitely grateful that I didn't try to conquer the Cookie Finale all by myself. To contrast the sweet, we wanted something salty and ordered a side of french fries. They were shoestring style and were just okay.  

My friend and I agreed that the Cookie Finale wasn't anything special. Sure, it was a huge portion and a bargain for $7.99, but I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the taste. The cookie just wasn't ooey gooey enough for my liking. Our waiter was great - he handled our drunken antics with a smile. The atmosphere was underwhelming.

Maybe it's me, I don't know!

This Claim Jumper is located (dead-center) in the outdoor Town Square shopping complex

As a high-volume eater, I love the amount of food offers to us. I also love the lunch items at Claim Jumper including the appetizers and the French Onion Soup. That hearty soup is also a pretty good size too.

For lunch, I had a pair of one of  my personal favorites; the Caesar Salad and Chicken Fingers. The $10.95 poultry dish has five boneless breast battered to a golden brown. I also get a choice of dipping sauce, in which I chose the Bleu Cheese.  And the $6.95 Caesar Salad was tasty with salad dressing and the colorful green color of the Romaine lettuce.

The bartender took it right back to the kitchen with her apologies. The ""new"" burger I got was just the same one with the cheese scraped of. I was just going to cancel my food and leave. The bartender got the manager who offered to buy me a new burger. He offers it to go, so I accepted his kind offer. He clarified my requests and asked how I wanted it cooked (medium).  A long while later I get my burger to go. Once in the car, I opened it to grab a bit or two while it was still hot. Well, the burger was cold and the edges were charred.

At one time, I truly enjoyed this place. Now, not so much. The food is nothing special. I came here with a friend that prefers American food, so we stopped by after he got off work. Navigating the menu for something light can be difficult due to my introductory paragraph. For those who are cautious about what they eat, during lunch time they do offer a cup of soup and a salad or half a sandwich and salad. I decided on the former. Opting for the French onion soup and California citrus salad, it was enough to fill me without making me feel sluggish. The soup was salty, but the crouton and melted cheese helped mellow it down. The salad was delicious. The mixture of Mandarin orange slices, cranberries, candied walnuts, avocado, and lettuce tossed in a citrus vinaigrette is wonderful on a hot day. The salad is a nice blend of sweet, tart, and creamy. Usually it comes with bleu cheese, but I find the flavor overbearing, so I asked for mine without. The combo comes with your choice of bread; you can choose between corn muffin, blueberry muffin, cheese toast, or a sourdough biscuit. I chose the corn muffin. They are large, but dry. With the butter they provide, it probably would have been more moist, but usually corn bread is rich enough.

The bartender was the waiter and of course it took forever for him to acknowledge us because he had to wait on 50 other people. When he takes our order I specify ""no cheese and no tomato"". The food took forever and guess what...I got tomato and extra cheese. I also ordered a salad and guess what...they forgot to bring it.

The food was gross. It was obviously microwaved garbage out of the freezer. Tasted nasty. I took a few bites and the bartender places the bill on the bar in front of me... $65 !!! Seriously? I get better food and service at Dennys for $10.

After doing some shopping in the rain, the bf and I worked up a healthy appetite and wanted something for lunch that wasn't the typical bar food. After walking all around town square we decided to drop into Claim Jumper to check out their menu. We'd both been to CJ in other states/locations but for whatever reason had never been to this one.

We were pleasantly surprised when we looked at their lunch menu, it was filled with salads and sandwiches, not the greasy cheeseburgers and fries we'd seen everywhere else. While he put more money in the parking meter I waited for a table. I noticed that right in the lobby they had a huge sign with their Happy Hour info. Being that it was a Saturday, I wasn't expecting to find a HH, but was thrilled to see we'd made it with 10 minutes to spare.

The HH specials are great (Check out my photos for a listing of offerings)! Tons of options for both drinks and food. We sat at the bar and were ignored for the first 7 or 8 minutes, we sat discussing whether or not they would let us order from the HH menu at this point. But when we were finally greeted our waitress didn't even glance at the clock. She happily took our order, got us our drinks and gave us a few more minutes before coming back to tell us it was last call for HH pricing. 5 stars for that service, most people/places would have told us we were out of luck.

Everything we tried was off the HH menu. We ordered 2 orders of the Coconut shrimp - 1 each. They came with 3 decent sized pieces of shrimp, 2 sauces and a spicy slaw like salad. The Shrimp was perfectly baked and left me wanting more. $6 each.

We also ordered 2 Mini Caesar Salads which were anything but mini! We could have shared one, although at $3 each, who cares? They were good but too many croutons for my liking.

We had an order of the Spicy Asian BBQ Wings - 6 wings plus carrots, celery and dressing for $5. These were tasty! I'm not a huge wing fan, so you know if I'm downing them they gotta be good..

Finally we had a couple of Mojitos $5 each on the HH menu. The consistency in flavor wasn't great, one was more minty than the other, but not bad none the less.

This will definitely be a spot I return to if only for the Coconut Shrimp, but knowing they have HH options that are outside the greasy bar food will likely bring me back as well.

TIP: Happy hour specials from $2. Mon - Fri 3pm - 6:30pm, Sat 11am - 3pm. Also during football season Sunday all day!",m2vjSXdfs19kNnqUUpAmOQ,7,4,4,1g5RIqnfJuHlP0h9Ux5jMA

I got the steak and bean chili in a sourdough bowl which also came with 2 more pieces of bread for $10.  Exactly what I wanted and it totally hit the spot for a relatively cold Vegas evening.  My wife for some reason opted for the filet mignon.  I am totally against getting steaks at places like this unless they're dirt cheap since they would never ever compare to the greatness of so many steak places we've been to.

Their portions are filling, and you have flexibility as to how you want something cooked or prepared (no butter on veggies, cooked blackened, etc.) Our server was fairly attentive to our needs, and their portions are easily sharable among a large group (which is recommended).",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,0,0,3,hVhoVQ6_m2ebIsNAaobZqg

5821408,2015-08-18,0,7xXaO9deBDh_dd0JQjA-Qg,"I believe this might have been the first or second time I've ever been to claim jumper, and I left with a bad impression. This place was conveniently located after shopping in town square, and a friend was craving for some chicken pot pie. 

Since she had heard that their establishment serves pretty good ones. I was down to get some as well. Long story short, I didn't, and I'm so glad the disaster was with one, not two chicken pot pies. 

My BBQ chicken salad was good- 3 stars.
The appetizer platter- 3 stars. Artichoke dip was okay, mozzarella sticks were gooey and yummy inside, and fried zuchinni's were okay. 
BBQ baby back ribs- 3 stars average. Fried mac and cheese were terrible, and the bread was unappetizing. We didn't even touch it or pack it to go. 

Chicken pot pie- 1 star horrendous. It was extra thick than usual, more so than any chicken pot pie I've seen or tasted in my lifetime. I wasn't born yesterday. And the flavor was even worse. It tasted like they put too much corn starch or flour to thicken the sauce. It was also just warm, not piping hot like you would expect right out of an oven. The puff pastry taste and quality was meh. And that's usually the best part of the pot pie.

We talked to our waiter who initially gave us attitude so I told him we weren't crazy, and that our chef friend had tried it as well. He responded, ""I'm a chef, too."" Okay, nice one buddy. Cuz that's really obvious from where we're sitting. I didn't see the relevance--not like he got to taste our pot pie. 

We got the manager or whomever the boss was to stop by, and he wasn't very helpful either, with a lot of pride about a product that was mediocre at best. He insisted the texture was correct, and that it stiffened from cooling, which wasn't the case for us. 

He then offered to remake a batch, but my friend was so disappointed, and ordering another pot pie was not an option, especially since they had said the inside would be the exact same batch. 

He then stood there for a while asking if she wanted to order another item instead. And when she said ""no,"" he stood there asking her what she wanted to do. Birds were chirping. Awkward silence. And then he said something along the lines of, ""well, why don't you think about it while I take this back."" 

It almost seemed like they thought we were unnecessarily complaining, when my conversation started with, ""everything is great, except for the chicken pot pie.""  

I've been to so many restaurants, and If a customer doesn't want an alternative dish, and the food was clearly not even eaten except three bites, I would think the immediate response is to remove it from the bill. It was obvious that he was waiting for her to bring it up. They ended up charging her for the mini salad that came with the pot pie. I thought that was just to spite her. 

There's plenty of other places in this town that have great food and service, I think the fact that our chef friend could confirm that the inside didn't taste or look right was enough for me to know that we weren't crazy.  Oh, I forgot to add, she actually got sick immediately after we walked out. Don't know if that's a coincidence. 

Sure won't be back here!!",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,1,2,fcXj_VgC98XFKCGcMErtyg

Not a huge fan of Claim Jumper it's a fun time but the food isn't all it's cracked up to be.. When we went it was kind of dead and it's such a big space that you figured they could have done more .. I wasn't a big fan of the way it is layed out..

However that being said our waiter was awesome and very friendly and our food came at a timely manner.. I would indeed come back again to grab a drink or watch the game but not just for the food..",PaPtAqF3EEfBoUN891o-7Q,1,0,3,ZKbgAOQK6GW2hJJoDTAgJw

We had a really big party so I knew it was going to take a while for drinks, food, checks, etc. But it actually was pretty decent. Our server was pretty attentive and split the checks in many different ways so I was happy about that. The thing that docs the stars is the food and how we were always finding our water glasses empty. The appetizer tray was really delicious. Fried lemon pepper zucchini was surprisingly good. Mozzarella sticks can never be too cheesy. But the chips for the spinach dip was really thin and broke easily. The garlic bread was actually really good but our pasta came out kind of cold. I had asked everyone else how their meals were and a lot of them said salty. C'mon Claim Jumper are you trying to kill us? I tried the fries and it literally tasted like they dropped the whole salt container on them. No wonder why everyone's water glasses were empty, the food was just too salty. BUT, on the bright side, my sister said she liked their shrimp tacos.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,7,2,3,iL-Vy3eDWMMIpaHO3FCH4A

I had chicken fingers and could barely tell the chicken fingers from the french fries for the price it was ridiculous.

Drinks were prepared well but my entree was not up to par. I didn't even eat half of it because artichokes were so sour they were inedible and fish seemed as it was not fresh. I tried to eat it it it was awful..after tracking down manager I brought it up to managers attention, David. David said he would let kitchen know the quality was up to par but refused to take item off the bill even though I did not even eat majority of it. Not only did he argue with me but he did nothing but offer a cupcake and I told him I did not want a cupcake.I work in the restaurant business myself inside the Venetian and I will never come back to this location and will definitely advise people to stay away from this location. What ever happened to hospitality and guest concepts? So disappointed and this place left a bad taste in my mouth.
