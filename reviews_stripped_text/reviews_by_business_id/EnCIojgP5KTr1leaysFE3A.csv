My cousin ate there a few nights ago and was totally wowed by it. He said it was amazing. 

I, along with three other friends went there yesterday to check it out. Our togo order was totally f'd up and not in our favor. First of all the guy behind the counter said, don't worry, everything will be marked. Absolutely nothing was marked and we had to try and figure out what our orders were since they were all thrown together. Secondly, one of the sandwiches we ordered was missing...so we had to share what we had because it was too much of a pain in the ass to drive all the way back to make a stink. 

On top of that, I personally thought that the food was a bit greasy. I didn't love it. My other three friends did like the food, but didn't really get enough to eat. Everyone was a bit disappointed. They're willing to try again and give them another chance. I will if I'm dragged along.

218415,2014-12-14,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"If there's one thing that makes me seriously consider moving back to Vegas, it's this place. Seriously. I'm obsessed. It's probably unhealthy how much I think about these arepas.

I found out about this place about a month before I moved out of Vegas and my one regret is not trying this place sooner. It's in a sketchy area, but it is SO GOOD. Everything is perfect. Every time I go home, I have to make a stop here and get way too many items and eat until I feel sick.

Sometimes, it can be a bit salty, but the arepa itself is pretty bland, so it's a good balance. Their yucca fries are heavenly, and so are their fried plantains. The wood-fire chicken is so smokey and tender, the pork was nice and juicy, the avocado sauce is perfectly creamy, ugh. So good. They give you two sauces; one's a spicier one and the other is a creamy cilantro I believe. I like to mix them and drown my arepas in them. 

If you decide to go here, which I highly recommend and will be extremely envious about, be ready to waddle out the door. If you're anything like me, it'll be nearly impossible to choose one arepa to try and you'll end up getting 2 and an empanada (which is also delicious) and yucca fries. If you are able to have room for dessert afterwards (which I highly doubt), go next door to Art of Flavors.

I'm not sure why they would run out of warm shrimps but the cashier told me... ""Is it ok. We don't have any warm shrimps left?"" I guess their arepas are premade or something.

Anyways, my order came with two spicy green sauce (not sure what it's called) and two cucumber sauces. The arepa, contrary to what I assumed, especially with the price, was quite small. It had a good amount of shrimp filling (but it was the smaller kind of shrimps). It was, however, really tasty. I just don't really understand why they couldn't make my food warm.

We usually get the food to go, but it looks like they are building an actual restaurant on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming or Oakley.

I went up to the cashier and he let me know he didn't charge me for it. I was content with not having it, but he insisted he correct it no charge. They promptly fixed it and brought it to my table. 

I also got the home-cut fries and the sugar cane with lime drink. The fries were seasoned well and cooked great. The drink was good, a different taste, but still good.

My fiance got the wood-fired chicken Arepa and it was equally as good. She tried the mango juice drink they have and it was amazing! Definitely wished I got that over the sugar cane.

This place is pretty authentic in terms of the food they serve, staff is very friendly and the place was packed when we visited.We tried arepas with carne mechada, ham and cheese, tequeños and empanadas, also passion fruit juice. My favorite was the tequeños,fried cheese surrounded by crispy dough. The arepas are good, generous in the fillings,  but unfortunately, I was dissapointed  with the carne mechada, it was lacking that authentic flavor I'm used to, to me it was lacking in flavor, maybe  it needs some more cumin, garlic, and red peppers and onions, it didn't have any visible strips of onions and peppers that is traditional in venezuelan carne mechada. Also the cheese in the arepas looked like mozzarella, not the traditional queso fresco.

427561,2015-07-28,1,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I like a good walk for comfort food. This place came up high on the list when I Yelped ""best cheap eats"".  3 mile walk from my hotel?  Hey, I needed the exercise. 

The place is clean and spacious. Kinda Chipotlesque with the stainless steel countertops and serving trays. 

The menu is clear and simple to navigate. Plenty of very tasty sounding items. I ordered a wood fired chicken arepas and a beef/black bean/plantain/cheese arepas.  And a cup of water. 

The friendly folks called my name when it was ready. They serve it up with two squeeze bottles of their special sauces. One mostly white (garlic) and one kinda orangish (spicy).  As served, the arepas are not terribly big looking, but they are well-wrapped in paper and, as I would soon find out, surprisingly filling.  

First thing I noticed--the damn things are HOT.  As in temperature. Not only could I not take a bite out of them--I couldn't even hold them. So...I let them cool a bit. 

Finally (recall I just walked three miles to get there) I took my first bite. The corn masa (or whatever they make the arepas out of) was tender and moist. The chicken was shredded and juicy. The beef/bean/plantain/cheese was just the same--both really good. I loved the white sauce on both of them. This Venezuelan food reminds me a little of Cuban food--which I love. 

A few quibbles...
- no fountain sodas. And they charged me for WATER.  I get Las Vegas is running desperately low on the stuff, but most restaurants aren't that stingy.
- no forks.  The arepas are messy after about three bites. 
- kinda not cheap. Both my arepas and my water were $12 and change. That's not exactly ""cheap eats"" in my book. 

That being said, I enjoyed the food and look forward to going back again. Even if I have to walk three miles. I appreciate the exercise.",R5GvraTzRxgZyEQPuM5fow,1,0,4,1sExLRL-5usUL8gGt1aTjg

MINUS ONE STAR

We ordered one beef and one shredded chicken arepa. The beef one was more flavorful, tasted like sloppy joes almost. The chicken was a little bit dry but that special green sauce fixed that. We also ordered one beef and one chicken empanada. The empanadas felt too doughy and barely had any meat. They were like plain, less meaty versions of the arepas. 

Fried plaintains were good though. Oily, hot and satisfying. Also had their sugar cane juice with lime. I didn't like that at all.

Now let me preface what I am about to say by letting you know that I used to live in Venezuela, birth place of the wonderful arepa. I ate arepas every single day I lived there. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Mid-afternoon snack. I've had them cooked on a griddle(traditional), deep-fried, and baked. And I loved them all. I cannot ever remember getting one I didn't like. My favorites order was ""Dos arepas de pollo y un pepsi (pronounced peksi down there)"" from La Areparia Diecinueve De Abril in Cumana. I'd stop there at least once a day.

That said, it was to my ginormous disappointment that last Thursday I had my first bad arepa.

Sorry folks, a  precooked arepa that's been sitting in a heating tray only to be tossed on the griddle at the last minute to be reheated is bad from the word go. Add to that mushy, bland pollo mechada(shredded chicken), and things don't get much better. The carne mechada (shredded beef) wasn't much better, or should I say not as bad. The jugo de parchita was watered down to the point of being almost indiscernible as passion fruit juice.

I promise, I really had high hopes for this place. Being the only Venezuelan restaurant in Las Vegas I was excited to try it. But as much as it pains me to say, Viva Las Arepas, I know arepas, and you are no arepa.",_8qu8GfnQCv0yae2i-OU5A,3,0,2,pXmzkdNsqVfMQRnkCysUYA

I found the wood fired chicken and shredded beef lacking in any discernible flavor other than salt. And the salt ruined the food for me. I enjoyed the sauce/additions on both, but when I am eating meat, I don't want to feel like a dish NEEDS the sauce. These arepas did. In addition, the texture of both was also very....mushy. Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I will give them another chance and hope that I caught them on a bad day.

I ate arepas made by hand years ago and they were outstanding. So I know I like arepas.  I realize it is not fair to compare homemade preparation with a fast food preparation, but I really wanted (and expected) to love the product at Viva Las Arepas. I didn't expect it to taste like homemade, but I did expect better than what they delivered. It remains to be seen if this was a bad day, or just not the business for me.

Had the pollo arepas ( $3 ) and the carne ( $3.50 ) 

Comes with a side of spicy and mild sauce - damned if I know what's in them  the spicy had a smokiness to it, the
Mild a cream base - both very good.

The arepas ??  I actually like the pollo more but both were very good.  They basically take a corn based thick pancake,  cut in 1/2 and stuff with meat - no frills - simple food with great flavor .

For those unfamiliar, here's a quick description lifted from wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arepas): ""Arepa is a native sort of bread made of ground corn, water, and salt which is fried into a pancake-like bread. It is either topped or filled with meat, eggs, tomatoes, salad, cheese, shrimp, or fish.""

Paolo D. and I came here on a recommendation from Nelson Q. Best recommendation ever. I've had arepas before and they were usually overly greasy or their filling was under-seasoned, but this place hit the spot. Maybe I got lucky and ordered two fillings that I really enjoyed, but I was one happy camper after having an arepa. 

The one downside is that there's absolutely nowhere to sit (this place is in a kiosk-like location in a parking lot in downtown -- think food truck without the wheels). Also I was really confused about how the ordering/paying worked because the guy working the cashbox really didn't seem to know what he was doing.",UZd_TFUcSgO0gRzLPZ8eIg,7,3,4,Rjwg0fgk4dm0mvU32D3Xbg

As for the arepas, well there's always pupusas. 
 I've tried the arepas once before when they were selling them from the little shack on Dino's parking lot and they were kinda good but nothing I would really get addicted to, so when I found myself in the shady neighborhood looking for other kind of addictions I decided to give arepas another try. Service is good, they were friendly and very patient with me while I read both menus one in English and the other one in Spanish, the one disadvantage of being bilingual, (or drunk) you read everything twice.
 The new location is nice, spacious and clean, but the booths are kind of small you can literally take a bite off the persons arepa seating in front of you which could be good thing depending on who you're with, so if you're not interested at all in counting your companion cavities pick a table for more personal space. There's also a long communal table along the window with a view to a beautiful 7-11 and other independent entrepreneurs working around the area. you can eat and do some window shopping at the same time.
  For the food I ordered the garlic shrimp and the pork butt arepas, the shrimp arepa was very good but the garlic flavor was very intense,(still present 5 hours later) and the pork butt was a little too salty and there's nothing I hate more than salty butt.
 Still,  this is a very popular place and most people find the food here tasty and palatable, as for me I don't see myself waking up in the middle of the night craving arepas so if you see me late at night around the neighborhood, arepas is not what I'm looking for.

She told us her favorites, ordered for herself, and then told us, ""This place is really good.  I should know, I'm from Venezuela and I love the way they cook here.""

Emboldened, we walked away with two arepas.  We had actually had arepas before, in Brooklyn - they are kind of similar to the dish some parts of Mexico call a quesadilla.  Thick masa is formed into a pita-type shape, or sandwich-style, around delicious fillings.  I think these might've been even better than the ones in NYC.  The masa was crunchy and chewy all at once; the fillings were boldly seasoned and complex.

My favorite was the Reina Pepiada.  It was a chicken salad with peas, and it was the bee's knees.   I followed one of my cardinal rules for unfamiliar Spanish-language foods - if the title isn't a direct translation, its probably a regional favorite, and it was.

When it comes to the Arepas, it gets even better. Made with authentic corn mix ""Harina Pan"", they're soft, warm and very filling. Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner! My favorite one is the shredded beef Arepa; I like adding cheese and avocado to it.

Scouted out the menu online, cross referencing it with reviews here, and ultimately decided on the #1: shredded beef and the #7: reina pepiada, plus a side of fried yucca. Total came to just over $15, which was a bit pricey IMO.

The arepas were unique and tasty, but fell a little short of my expectations. The shredded beef was a little on the dry side, but I perked it up with a bunch of the creamy cilantro sauce- that stuff is the bomb dot com. The reina pepiada arepa was tasty too, but the flavor simply got boring after a few bites. 
Luckily, the yucca was there to save the day: crispy and chewy and garlicky, it's everything yucca is supposed to be! The $3 price tag was a bit steep for the 12 bits that I got, most of which were half-pieces. Would I get them again though? Resounding yes.

Service was okay: minimal but friendly, brought out my take out to me at a table and took my order efficiently. Decor in the restaurant is fairly typical for a taqueria, but with the added touch of local artwork on the right hand wall as you walk in, all available for purchase. Though the pieces were good and added to the ambiance of the restaurant itself, I'm again taken by the sticker shock- the two paintings closest to me were $110 and $380. For folks advertising inside of a restaurant, that seems a bit unrealistic, but what do I know.

Might come back and try a few different flavors, seems like the BF and I could share three- they look deceptively small but they're very filling. But I'll definitely be adding on the yucca.

Side note: though a lot of other reviews mention the lengua arepas, and they look AMAZING, they no longer carry lengua here. So sad about that! :(",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,3,0,3,kmekfyTX6pFvcuZb5UVWOQ

I've never had Venezuelan food before so this was a bit of an adventure. The neighborhood around this place is dirty and sketchy, but inside the restaurant it was a lot nicer than I expected. I was expecting it to be a hole in the wall, but it was situated more like a modern fast food joint. I ordered the pork butt arepa with avocado, cheese and fried plantains with a soda. My Mom just got their sugar cane and lime drink, she was going to split my food with me. My Dad got the cold chicken with cilantro mayo arepa (I forgot what it was called) with fried yuca and chicharrones and a mango juice drink. We got the drinks first. The sugar lime drink was ok, it needed more lime and was kinda watered down. My Dad's mango drink was way better, one of the best things we had here. It wasn't too thick or sweet. It was almost creamy and had a mild mango flavor. I wish I had ordered it. 

My arepa was ok, I expected the pork meat to be like carnitas, but it was more like average pulled pork. I tried my Dad's arepa and it was a lot better, I liked the cilantro mayo. The sauces they gave us were good, one was spicy and the other was a cilantro sauce. They enhanced the flavor of my arepa, made it better. Our sides were the best out of everything. The plantains were sweet and a little crispy. The yuca and chicharrones were great and even better with that cilantro sauce. The yuca was crispy and starchy. The chicharrones were a bit dry, but they were meaty and of course great with the cilantro sauce. I was just kinda disappointed in my arepa, I think next time I'll try their grilled meats instead, if I come again.",H_KCkMeFblrh_owAYU9GmQ,6,5,3,kFM5_zr3dxJ9w2k_p93uPA

I ordered the wood fired chicken and beef arepas. The lady at the counter said the chicken was their most popular. So I took that one, and a beef one. After having both, I have to say I was much more impressed with the beef. It was tender, juicy and that creamy cilantro sauce (or atleast that's what I think it was) was impressive. I think that would go great on anything.  I am going back for the roasted pork butt arepa, and I am not sure, but I know for a fact I will be going here often. The meats were juicy and great flavor, but the real star was the actual arepa, it was dense but not dry, and had a great soft texture on the inside, but crunchy on the outside. if you had a pupusa before, it has that similar taste.

I ordered their menudo arepa and this time not even the arepa could save this extremely bad tasting menudo.

First time trying arepas and boy was I blown away. I would pick arepas over tortillas any day. I am a lover of anything doughy and the texture and thickness of the arepa was just perfect for me. Add in some deliciously seasoned pork butt and beef and you have a heavenly combo! My favorite would definitely have to be the pork butt. It was perfectly seasoned and the meat just melted in your mouth. They also have a house cilantro-garlic sauce which was a perfect pairing. In addition to the arepas that I got, I also got an order of the pork rinds and yucca root. Pork rinds were delicious but the fried yucca root was the star.

There are many more items on the menu now, which we plan to come back and try (grilled meat plates looked really good).

But today we were here for arepas.  We ordered four: wood fired beef and chicken, plus shredded beef and roasted pork, plus an empenada to share.  It did take a while to get our food, but that tells you that it's prepared fresh to order.

The plan was to each of us to take two, eat half of each, and then swap them, so we could both sample all four.  Halfway through the first one I realized that one was going to be my limit.  I started with the roast pork; my wife had the wood fired chicken.  They were as delicious as I remember.  We ended up taking home the two beef arepas.  The person who helped us was very friendly, he wrapped up our two untouched arepas, boxed them, gave us little containers of sauce and bagged the whole thing.

Definitely plan to come back here soon.  This town has such a great selection of ethnic dining.

All the food is made fresh to order; typical on their menu are arepas (cornmeal griddle cakes either baked or cooked on a griddle, then split  and filled with various fillings from cheese to 'reina pepiada' - chicken salad with avocado and cheese. Other dishes include pabellon (shredded  beef, plantains, rice and black beans) and carne asada (beef, chicken or pork) barbecued on mesquite wood. If you have a sweet tooth and feel adventurous they have a selection of Venezuelan chocolates and candies, as well as pastries.

Small indoor and outdoor seating areas; parking is available in the rear of the building. Service was very courteous and arrived quickly (you order and pick up at the counter). While they do not deliver you can order from Uber Eats and they will pick up and deliver to you.

Truth be told, I don't know how arepas or Venezuelan empanadas should be so I can't review on authenticity, just taste.

We ordered the garlic shrimp arepas and a few empanadas - cheese, cheese & bean, and cheese & guava - along with fried plantains and the Agua De Panela to drink. The taste of everything was fresh and simple, the multiple sauces, including a cilantro/mayo, a perfect addition. I was expecting the food to be heavy and greasy but it wasn't!

With items from $2-$4 and a bright, clean interior, you really can't go wrong. Felix, one of the owners, was very nice and obviously takes pride in his food.

We came in on a Friday night and I for one was super excited to go. I was game for trying something new and never had an arepa before. We ordered the shredded beef and pabellon per recommendation. The arepas were good and very flavorful. They give you two different sauces. One is extremely spicy. The other is some kind of cilantro mayo concoction, but it works and is super tasty! 

The reason for the low rating is the poor customer service. No greeting and no smiles. I had a coupon from a book I got at Costco and as soon as I showed it, the cashier immediately turned it down. He was kind of rude and unapologetic about it. According to him, they ""have been trying to get the company who produces the coupons to take them off their website for three years now.""

5 stars - Arepa with black beans and cheese. I loved this dish! The beans were so flavorful and they do not skimp on the cheese here. Even the arepa itself was not heavy and held the beans and cheese really well, so it didn't get messy while eating it.

4 stars - Cachapa. It was like a folded over corn griddle cake with melted cheese inside. It had a sweet flavor from the corn and the savory of the cheese to balance out the flavor. I liked eating this with the squeeze of homemade green hot sauce they give you in a squeeze bottle. Spicy, but good!!

3 stars - Fried plantains. I'm a big fan of fried plantains and usually order them whenever they're on the menu. In this case, the fried plantains could have been more sweet by letting them ripen just another day or two before cooking them. The preparation was spot on, with a golden brown glow because it was fried. Just a bit sweeter and this would have been a five in my book.

I've had this place on my mind for several months and finally made our way over to it for a late lunch on a weekend. It was a beautiful day and wanted to enjoy our food outside since they have a cute little corner space. 

We ordered - a chicken arepa with avocado and a pork butt one with cheese. Next came a beef empanada, fried plantains and a sugar cane drink with lime. The chicken arepa had some type of sauce on it and it was way too wet for my taste. I loved the pork butt and it was my favorite part of the meal, especially with the delicious creamy cilantro sauce over it! The beef empanada was ok, expected more flavor. The plantains were fantastic and the perfect way to end the meal. I would skip the sugar cane with lime drink as it was very sour. 

Here's the rest of the story and why I couldn't give it a higher rating. As I mentioned above we chose to sit outside because the weather was perfect. A homeless man came over and sat next to our table and began staring at me. It was nearly impossible to enjoy my food and we ended up buying him food. He chose to sit next to us and eat it as he continued to stare me down. Then came over a couple who were high as kites and the male wanted to show us his junk. He was committed to this and with every passing minute was also screaming at his female friend. I wanted to crawl under the table.

Hole in the wall
Small crappy looking shack that serves delicious grub

All three of these phrases perfectly describe Viva Las Arepas, but I like the third one the best!

Located at the end of the strip, on Las Vegas Blvd, just a few blocks past the Stratosphere Hotel, sits a small, ugly white shack in a deserted parking lot that serves up some of the tastiest little snacks in all of Las Vegas. 

Viva Las Arepas serves up some of the best tasting Arepas I've ever eaten. For those of you who aren't familiar with Arepas, they're pretty much small, fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, etc, etc. Viva also makes empanadas, a few hot dogs, aguas frescas, and a few sweet treats like flan and more. They also have these two amazing shack-made sauces. One is a lime green color that's mild but has an amazing flavor and the other is a spicy red sauce. Since my wife and I were going to have a big dinner the same day we visited Viva, we decided to just get a few items to try. This is what we purchased;

Lengua Arepa W/ White Cheese & Avocado Slices http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=8lN2NE_nQzG-VFNGfeR1hA
Ground Beef & Shredded Cheese Arepa  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=-dY7b8L5QpT1MPtSHG34ug
Black Bean & Cheese Empanada http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=D_dkKgnCHti4moXUxO85vQ

All three items were incredibly delicious. The cornmeal pockets were perfectly fried yet still had a soft center. The Lengua, which was shredded and cooked in a delicious sauce, was my fave of the two. It was savory, sweet and slightly spicy all at the same time. The ground beef Arepa reminded me of a Taco Bell Chalupa, but obviously much better. The black bean and cheese empanada was also very good. 

To wash down our yummy snacks we had a large Passion Fruit aguas frescas. It was super sweet and super refreshing. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=Wz0vow2OgM5E5N6lMQP07Q 

The prices for each Arepa are about $3 or $4 bucks a piece, which isn't too bad considering how delicious they are. The guys who were working in the shack were all friendly and got our food out to us quickly. 

If you're in LV and feel like something quick, tasty and cheap, don't go to some crappy chain place like McDonald's, head on down to Viva Las Arepas and treat yourself to some phenomenal Arepas. Trust ME.",YWFbTcVnun8i03XnEU7kVg,16,14,5,1NjKYRug-M5-Ko5_joaCCg

Five awkward minutes later, i yell out ""uno y dos and adios"" and the cooking got underway finally. Oddly enough, he asked in English if I wanted cheese. Both the shredded chicken and beef were tasty, but the edge goes to the beef, although both needed more peppers and onions and the promised garlic wasn't too prevalent. The chicken was kind of mushy too. The cornmeal pancakes were the best part, so i will probably focus more on veggie stuffings which would let those shine through more.

The food here is amazing. The selection of Venezualan food, and the quality, is simply great! Their new shop is brightly lit and colorfully decorated, and the food is just as good as it was when they were in their old location just north of here.

A small, modest sized establishment for such a well known, and raved about place. 
To order you must get in line and wait your for your turn at the counter. The worker we had help us with our order was a man wearing black ( assuming his the main guy in the place )

He was v gracious with us and even went as far to describe the flavors of the different coconut drinks they had there for us! Haha 

The food we got were orders #1, #7, and #13 along with many many other dishes from off the menu...

But I'll just stick with the ones that wowed me the most lmao

Or yeah

The arepas.. 
WOWOWOWO WOWOWOWO
SO F GOOD 

The outer part, reminiscent of a pupusa ( I think! ), was so delicious  

I serious could have just eaten that haha, but with the cilantro and avocado chicken thing I had with it

WOW

I also had tried some of the #13 and it reminds me a lot of a sweet corn tamale except with cheese

Arepas are perfect for a light lunch meal or snack, but only if you limit yourself to one. You'll be sorely tempted to have more. This eatery is marginally clean; there's a nice lady that comes around asking if she can wipe your tables or buss your trash. I wish water was available for self-serve.

I Love Arepas was only on its 3rd day of being open, so of course there is always room for improvement. 

Felix was very accomidating to our needs. 
He said the best arepa to try was the reina pepiada which is shredded chicken, pieces of hot dogs tossed in mayo, cheese and avocado. It was light but wasnt my cup of tea. I wouldnt order this again. 

Next, we had the carne mechada, which was way better!

Last, we were going to order the chicken but decided to get the pernil (pork butt). Felix wanted to make us happy so we told him if he could add black beans and salted cheese. This one was my fav!
The arepas itself was very moist and not very heavy at all as opposed to Caracas in New York.

As for a place just starting out,  Felix knows he has to make some changes to the menu and the venue (adding chairs, tv outside), which i commend him for listening to his customers, as he took note of our suggestions.

The arepas are great, but there needs to be a variety of components instead of just a meat filling.

I love any drink that involves raw sugar cane, and in this one the lime cuts the sweetness just right but not so much that it tastes like limeade.
I have two standout memories from my first visit. First, I wanted to try the yuca fries, but my husband was being a little conservative about them. So we didn't order...but the owner brought over an order for us to try anyway, on the house! They were so good and crispy, and I've ordered them ever since. My second memory is of the wood stacked in full view of the dining area, so you know they are always smoking that meat right in-house. 
I also have to complement the owners on a bright, folksy, and clean atmosphere. It was a pleasure to sit there...reminded me a lot of small cafes we encountered in our trips to central America...but with air-conditioning, LOL!
Very affordable eating for ""The Strip""...please get out of those casinos and try this and other local businesses in our fabulous city. By the way, the very best gelato place in town, ""Art of Flavors"" is right next door (that's not just my opinion, but I totally concur); so save some room for dessert.",0DRa4GSTSml7vpwAFfRXjQ,1,0,5,G2PBmVjzVWsfuvkcCtVilw

A friend paid me a visit at work so that we could go out for lunch, we had both never tried VLA so we decided to try it out. Walking in I looked at the menu and prices and wow, talk about over priced. On top of that, they charge you extra for the cheese which arepas normally have, so that felt like a rip off, that's like ordering a cheeseburger but you have to pay extra for the cheese, but I get it, they're trying to make money. I ended up ordering two arepas, a reina pepiada and carne asada, I also got a coke, my total, over $13 for such a small meal, the arepas are about the size of grocery store hamburger buns, so they're a bit on the small side.The cashier was very nice and helpful, my friend didn't understand what some things meant and she explained them to her. 

We didn't wait very long for our food to come out, maybe about 10 minutes tops. I first bit into the reina pepiada and it was really good, but after a few bites I was over the sauce which is made with avocados and cilantro. The carne asada was my favorite, the meat was finely chopped and it came with one leaf of lettuce and one sliced tomato, but the heat of the carne asada cooked the tomato so I picked it out, yuck. One thing I can't stomach is cooked tomatoes so next time I know to order it without it. Both arepas came with a decent amount of meat and both were flavorful as well. I loved their green salsa, it had the perfect amount of kick. 

Overall, I enjoyed my meal, price, not so much, but I will be back because they know how to make some pretty tasty arepas.",RUa2_2yuSwJtU7sTXz-omA,5,7,4,wAz16tcgLs4BhqPngMPong

2101961,2018-03-20,2,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"**Updated Review**
I'm changing my review from four stars to three. The reason being is mainly the service. I understand that this is a hole in the wall joint, and I'm all for that, but if the person taking my order cannot even understand English enough to take my order, we have a problem. The girl clearly was not competent enough to take our order. She kept trying to flash her smile, but that's just not going to get our food ordered. I had to ask for the manager twice. Pretty sad. Kind of ruined her whole vibe of this place. 
Also, I have read other reviews which state that it is dirty inside lately and I would have to agree. Why is no one dusting off the tables and wiping down the chairs?
While this place was on my mind this morning as I had a craving, I can say that I probably will not be coming here when that craving hits in the future... 



I've been here a number of times over the years. 
This is an easy get in, get your food, get out place. 
It would be awesome if they had more than one vegan option, but I will take it nonetheless. The black bean and guac is absolutely delicious! 
I do wish they had more salsas that were vegan. And maybe even more sides. But hey, let's stick to what the plus sides are here. This is an authentic Arepas hole in the wall joint with a super small menu and low prices. 
The service is always friendly. And you see them making your food.

You might think one is not enough but damn they are filling.  It's also a little messy and the sauces they include don't help but it tastes great!

My only complaint is how much accouterments come with it.

2171118,2014-06-30,2,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I'm a bit torn in writing this review. 

I've had Viva Las Arepas (VLA) bookmarked for the better part of two years now, hell maybe more and it wasn't until recently had I been able to finally stop in. 

I love that there are still highly rated,  non-boojie, cheap, no frills food near the strip. I love even more that it's Venezuelan food.  Unfortunately, I may have been driven by the hype so much that I was left slightly disappointed. 

After a very long, grueling work schedule, my beau (bless his tired heart) was sweet enough to bring me here because I listed it on my top 3 places to eat while in Vegas.  We drove up to VLA, which isn't a stand anymore, they've transitioned to a brick & mortar. The parking lot is shared with other establishments and can get crowded during peak hours. 

The menu is large enough to spell some confusion for those salivating tastebuds. I know these arepas can be filling so I definitely had to strategize my meal. The man just got himself a carne arepa (non shredded) and 3 shredded beef empanadas. I got the pork buttt and carne arepas in addition to a chicken empanada. 

Our plates came out hot and fresh within a few minutes and those empanadas were super hot--so hot that a piece of it was left thrown and regurgitated back onto our tray lol (wasn't by me though). We enjoyed both empanadas though I will say the shredded beef was better than the chicken. We also both agreed they needed more meat in them. 

I love the arepa itself, and they generously filled 'em with our protein of choice. Unfortunately, neither of us were impressed with their beef. It was tough and lacked flavor. Even with all that drippy sauce, there was just something amiss with the beef. 

The pork butt I did enjoy. It was moist and tasty, and once I was carb loaded, I picked out all the pork and gobbled it all up. 

As cheap a meal as I thought it would be, we still paid $30++. 

Overall, I'm saddened this long sought bookmark didn't wow me, but I wouldn't mind giving it another try.",P6_r7O8zEjnxTSBkS6WYfg,8,4,3,MYjVGdLgTy57gLSepZPNcw
2174963,2013-01-03,2,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"The first time I""ve ever had empanadas was my bff's mom's.  They are Colombian, and there's not too many places that serve them, but I use hers as a comparison point to all other empanadas I eat.  Viva Las Arepas is Venezuelian style and has several different kind of empanadas.  The most similar to what I am used to is the shredded beef kind.  The masa is deep fried and crispy, unlike the baked Argentinian kind that is easily found in OC.  (Although they do have the baked kind as well, beef and rice, but it's a square shaped instead of the the half moon shape).  The taste is great, the beef soft, but there isn't too much filling in there.  The beef and rice ones have a lot more filling.

As for the arepas, again, I am used to the Colombian kind, where it's served on the side, plain, as a bread with your meal.  At this place, the arepas are used as bread to a sandwich with fillings inside.  We got the pork with tomato, beef, shrimp, and chicken.  they were all good to be honest.  I think I like the pork/tomato and chicken the best.  You have two sauces to go with them too.  I have no idea what they are, but the light green on isn't spicy, and goes great with the shrimp and chicken.  The red one is spicy and goes great with the pork and beef.

You really only need one arepa with one empanada and you are full.  We got 6 arepas and 8 empanadas, and the total came to almost $50! o.O Yikes!  The chef/owner asked us how many were eating with us, and I was kind of embarrassed to say it was just us two.  He gave us some deep fried cheese sticks on the house since we told him we were just ordering a bunch of stuff to try.  Those were good too.

$3 for simple frozen fries.  Nothing special.  They should price that at $1.75.

$6 for Arepas would be o.k. if it was bigger..  They should price these around $4.25

$3 for small Empanadas..  They should price these for about $2.25

$3.50 for fruit drinks..  They should price these for about $2.50

All my friends agreed that the prices were a bit too high and probably won't be back.

If you purchased one Arepa, one Empanada, one order of fries and a fruit drink, the grand total would be about $17 with tax.  But at least the food was decent.",t5JDmP7I-Bp6dH_QNUSiaw,2,0,3,WWpfRklPQgxO9_sYtO6vmQ

2208432,2013-01-28,1,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"What a transformation! The humble little arepa shack on the corner has grown up into a bright, clean cafe with a great menu of Venezuelan specialties. Besides the usual arepas and empanadas, they now offer wood grilled chicken and other meats. The selling point? $8.49 for half a chicken (or serving of another meat) plus two sides! Considering the location on Las Vegas Blvd, expect this place to fill up quickly at lunchtime, attracting workers from downtown and tourists in search of a deal. You'll pay about the same for four small tacos de adobada over at El Gordo.

The chicken is marinated in secret Venezuelan seasonings and grilled over wood and charcoal. My husband gave this pollo al carbon a big thumbs up. On my visit, the smoke from the grilling process overwhelmed the room, but the owner reassured me that this issue was being resolved immediately. Order at the counter, take your number, and wait for the food to be brought to your table, or to-go is a great option if smoke is present. For $19.99, the parrillada mixta serves two people a nice variety of grilled meats. Pork ribs and Pabellón (the official shredded beef dish of Venezuela) also stood out on the menu. Sides include rice with veggies, black beans, salad, chicken soup, and plenty of fried carbs. My favorite is the tender and crisp yuca, though I also enjoyed the patacones (smashed, fried plaintains) that look like bananas rolled over by a car tire-- in a good way! The french fries were pale and soggy, so something went wrong with those. Unfortunately, the mixed salad had a strange flavor that made me quit after a few bites. It seemed fresh, so I'm guessing the lettuce absorbed some of the smoke coming off the grills. I don't really eat any smoked foods, and I won't be adding smoked salad to my diet anytime soon. Venezuelans cook some of the best black beans (caraotas, in their country), and at Viva Las Arepas, white cheese is crumbled over the top. These caraotas with a side of sweet fried plaintains or yuca fries, a cheese empanada, and passion fruit juice to drink make up my ideal comida! The creamy green sauce and creamy red sauce (salsa Golf) are essential. I rarely pass up a pastelito (guava or coconut) for dessert.

Admittedly, I grew up eating these foods in Florida at various Colombian and Cuban joints, and some of the side offerings at Viva don't quite match the flavors I crave from home. They are already doing a very good job, and if they tweak the recipes a bit and clear out the smoke inhalation risk, I won't be able to stay away from this place. Family friendly (high chairs and a changing table), salsa Golf, occasional reggaeton (spare us the bachata, please!), and very cheap eats. ¡Chévere!",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,7,5,4,w6TbhkVEgAqRZUtOQbw7rA

This has allowed me to sample a large portion of their arepa offerings, usually by ordering two at a time; one to devour sitting at their stand & generously doused with their delicious sauces and one to go, for when the first digests enough to make room for it. This means I usually order one of their hot ones (for now) and the cold (for later); the Pork Butt and Tongue are my fave for the hot while the Reina & Garlic Shrimp are both boss for cold. 

The Pork Butt is a winner. If you like pork, get it. Rich, tender chunks of flavorful pork drenched in juices? Yeah, it's even better with avocado.

I really enjoyed the Tongue arepa, too. The beef is tender, there were decently sized chunks of tomato and aromatics all nestled between those little golden cakes of fluffy/crunchy delight.

If you like chicken salad, the Reina is a tasty Venezuelan version wedged between the delicious griddle-fried masa cakes.

The garlic shrimp were a decent portion of shrimp in a buttery garlic sauce that soaks into the bread the longer it sits. 

Even the cold codfish is pretty good. They mix the cooked fish with a flavorful blend of seasonings and veggies/aromatics. It doesn't overwhelm with the stank o' fishiness, but you still know it's there.

They also offer a few other things, but I always grab an arepa.  I'll diversify once I've conquered their entire Arepa menu!",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,3,2,4,5_tl0Yin-pV9DUHP36zhyg

My husband got the wood-fired chicken arepa and it was delicious! We also shared 3 empanadas--a beef, a shredded chicken, and a black bean and cheese. 

In the arepa, the chicken was perfectly seasoned, and complimented by the sauce and veggies. On it's own in the empanada, the wood-smoked flavor was a big too strong for my tastes, and I found myself using lots of their delicious hot sauce to mellow it out. The black bean and cheese was more mildly flavored. I liked that it was whole beans vs mashed like I had been expecting. My favorite of the three was definitely the beef! It was so tender if was falling apart but it seemed like a combination of shredded and ground beef, and it was fantastic!!

The restaurant is counter service, and the employees were extremely friendly. They weren't busy (we were there early) and they brought our food to the table. It was bright and airy, and spotlessly clean. They also have a nice little patio for seating.

The arepas are quite large and filling. One per person is more than enough. We decided to order 5 between the 3 of us to try different flavors which was way too much food. Too much food was wasted. I would have appreciated the man who took our order to let us know one per person would be enough. He even asked us if we had been before and we told him no. This location is in a sketchy part of town, so just be aware of that.

We made a point to come here for a quick lunch. We drove out of our way for it and it had been on our mind for many months since we had noticed the sign.

That said, the food was quite decent and we are familiar this cuisine.

The Reina Pepiada was mentioned pretty frequently.  I wasn't sure if it was something I should eat or someone I should meet. It was an arepas filled with a mixture of chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. It wasn't that big and didn't taste that amazing on it's own. It was too much avocado and mayo and not enough chicken for me but it was only about $5 and it was enjoyable after dumping whatever sauces were inside of the red and yellow containers.  

They did lack customer service. I explained that this was my first time here and if they had any recommendations or customer favorites. They could not help me with that and seemed rude about it, even went back to whatever they were doing before I asked for a menu, sat in the corner, and brought out the Yelp app. I didn't feel as welcomed as Art of Flavors felt like I should go back there.

The flavor was lacking. I am used to eating well seasoned meat and beans in Venezuelan dishes, and these were not.

The empanadas are about the best I ever had.  Perfect crust around enough filling.  Arepas are my new favorite sandwich pick the meat you like and go for it. Start with whatever they suggest as the favorites. You have to use both the spicy dark green and the light green sauces. Try the Tequeño Pastelitos (fried pastry covered cheese sticks) awesome.  Yucca fries are uniquely good but if you are not adventurous the regular french fries are great.

2393666,2014-06-29,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Arepas.. arepas! Such a delicious Venezuelan dish and this place is authentic as it can get right in the heart of Vegas! Located past the strip and towards downtown, it is easy to find! Parking is a little challenge since it's located in a small complex. If you cannot find parking, there are spots to park around the area and you'd have to take a quick walk to get across the street. Hey, at least it's free parking!

Once you enter, you are welcomed by the smell of the meats cooking on the grill! If you  had never had an arepa, it is basically an open-faced pupusa or a falafel. You have two pieces of dough, usually made out of maize, and fillings of meats and sauces sandwiched in the middle! It is a very popular South American dish typically in Venezuela and Colombia. 

My orders:

Yucca Root- Delicious and so simple! You get a lot of Yucca root cut up like thick fries (a lot healthier) and they fry it. There wasn't a lot of oil and no condiments because the  root itself has its unique flavor! This is a great side dish to order while you eat your arepas.

Fried Plantains- I love anything with bananas/plantains! This sweet dish really compliments the savory and saltiness of the yucca root and the arepas. It is a great combination to have with your meal! 

Fire-grilled beef arepa- I thought the arepas were going to be small, but it turned out to be quite fulfilling! The beef is perfectly grilled with vegetables and special sauces.

Fire-grilled chicken arepa- The chicken has to be my favorite. I love the taste of grilled chicken with the arepa! I would definitely get it again! 

Passion fruit juice- They have an array of drinks and juices that are local favorites if you were to be in South America! I tried the passion fruit and it was so refreshing! Not too sweet and not too watery either!

There was a good variety of food available so narrowing can be tough. I've ordered the chicken arepa while my brother ordered the beef arepa. I recommend the beef over the chicken. Personally, I believe there's more flavor between the two. The outside of the arepa is a bit oily so be careful not to remove the wrapping. I made the mistake of removing it and it broke into pieces.

I have been a hardcore Tamale fan for years, and I Love anything that involves corn. Corn bread, corn masa, corn souffle, etc. So when I found out Arepas are these delicious little pita pockets made from corn I fell in love before I ever even tasted it.
When I arrived at the Dino's parking lot I knew I was in for something special when I saw all of the picnic tables sitting around outside, and at least 10 people standing and sitting around eating and eagerly awaiting their orders....Oh yea, and this was at 11pm!

Looking at the menu, as usual, I couldn't decide which of the many amazing options to try, so, also as usual I over ordered. 
I got 3 Arepas 2 empanadas, and 2 tequenos.
Total cost: $16....(Although, they have raised the prices slightly since I first went and this order would now be roughly $20.)
But trust me this is enough food for 2. I had no idea how much meat they were going to cram into that little corn pocket.
I got the Roasted Pork butt, the Shredded Beef, and the Garlic shrimp arepas, and although I realized I had over-ordered after one empanada and half the first arepa, I still managed to polish off every bit of that order except the tequenos, which were the only thing I wasn't extremely impressed with. (They are basically like bland crescent rolls stuffed with white cheese.)
But, whatever that greenish white mayo-type sauce may be, it is the most perfect condiments i've ever had and goes perfectly with the saltiness of the meal. 

I haven't tried any of the more interesting ones: Tripe, lengua, etc.

The Pabellon had a sweet/savory taste to it thanks to the plantains. The Roasted Pork Butt was full of smokey and delicious butt flavor.

This is one time that I wish I had gone with my gut and not ordered what the yelpers recommended.  I ordered the Reina Pepiada (an arepa with chicken, avocado, mayo, peas) and the pork butt arepa.

Pork butt was fantastic, totally would get this again.  Not fatty, totally tender.

The Reina Pepiada though, I'm not so sure about.  I'm not too crazy about staying in shape, but I feel like anyone who is concerned about their health wouldn't be eating this for dinner every day.  I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I will order it from this point on.  Way too much mayo for my taste.

They have a variety of Venezuelan style dishes. Of course the most popular being the Arepas. You can get chicken, beef, vegetarian, cheese, corn, basically there will be SOMETHING you will like. They also serve fried plantains, delicious black beans, empanadas (literally the BEST empanada I have ever had), and chicken cooked on the grill fresh to order. A half a chicken and 2 sides is only $9! 
Our table tried a little bit of everything and all of us were extremely happy. Every single thing was fresh and above par. The only thing I didn't get this visit was one of the rare juices. I think I will try the fresh sugar cane with lime next time. 
The service was better than average. The lady behind the counter helped me with all the food that I had no clue how to pronounce and also answered my questions in detail. The chef was walking around the entire time making sure things were clean, and patrons were happy.

Wood fire beef ($5.50): not much flavor to this and pretty dry 
Pork butt ($4.50): meat was soft but pretty salty. 
Reina pepieda ($5.50): the avocado helped give the arepa more flavor. Thought it would be weird because it was cold but this was my favorite of the three arepas. 
Shredded Chicken empanada ($2.75): chicken was very good. Better meat than the meat in the arepas. These empanadas are fried. This was the best item we had. 
Strawberry cherry drink ($2.75): tastes almost like fruit punch but refreshing break from all of the dry food.

Reina Pepiada - LOVED this.  This is my usual because there is something satisfying about a cold and flavorful filling with a warm corn flatbread straight from the griddle.  Imagine a chicken salad but creamy and rich with avocado and well-seasoned chicken.

Shredded Beef - Yum! The beef was flavorful and extremely tender.  Not one tough strand of beef =D

Cachapa - Enjoyed this, however I wish they used a different cheese other than mozzarella.  The sweetness of the corn is SO ADDICTING!

This place is a great option if you want to avoid the ""typical Vegas"" experience. Heck, this place is a great option if you're looking for real, good food. The servings are huge - the arepas are a little bigger than the size of your fist (I guess that depends on how big your fist is). The ingredients are fresh and the flavor is super robust! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I ordered the garlic shrimp and the vegetarian arepas. My boyfriend, who's half Venezuelan (and he's even been to Venezuela) said that he thinks the vegetarian one is the best one he's ever had. He even wanted it as his last bite after he finished his chicken arepa. We also ordered a side of plantains and some passion fruit juice - both of which were sweet and scarfed down. A patron also told us that the fries are delicious - fresh cut like In N Out's, but better.

Felix was a pleasure to talk to and order from. The pricing is extremely reasonable ($4-$6/arepa), and we only needed 2 each to fill up before our drive back to LA. We waited a little bit for the food to be ready (clearly, I need instant gratification), but it was definitely for a good reason. The parking lot is small and shared with other stores, but we were able to find a spot for lunch; despite the small parking lot, the restaurant is spacious with plenty of seating.

I put the address without the suite # and was routed to the wrong place by Maps, but the Yelp app saved the day. It's next to a gelato shop & some trashy club wear place. Very sketchy with a couple homeless people, including a man in a wheelchair offering my husband $1 for 2 cigaettes. Unfortunately, my husband had to tell him it was a vape and not a cigarette. 

The restaurant itself was very clean and happy with its yellow walls. The employees were all very helpful. We ordered quite a bit of items and there were no problems accepting our certificate. We sat and the owner brought our order out to us directly. 

We had:
Wood fire beef with cheese: 5 stars. This was our favorite! Very flavorful beef with stringy cheese, tomato, and lettuce. 

Pulled pork with cheese: 4 stars. Juicy pulled pork that tasted smokey and tender. My issue with the arepas that I received was that not all the shell things were toasted equally. Some were crispy and would hold up and be buttery deliciousness. Others were more soft, but ended up becoming soggy and tasting like a mushy corn texture. 

Reina pepiada: 4 stars. It is an avocado chicken salad. It was yummy although missing some texture.

Garlic shrimp: 2 stars. This was my least favorite by far. The arepa for this one seemed very corn mealy? It wasn't toasted very much and got soggy quick. The shrimp are tiny little guys that you'd probably find at red lobster in their pasta. Also, pretty bland. 

Grilled chicken empanada: 2 stars. I've had empanadas made by my friends from Argentina, and it's all about the shell thing. This one was super thick! It was like eating an arepa with only a little bit of filling. Just way too carby for me. The grilled chicken in it was yummy though! I'd like to try it in an arepa next time. 

Fried plantains: 3 stars. Not my cup of tea. Kind of slimy in texture. If they were fried in oil, I couldn't tell because there was no crisp, but because they are called fried plantains, I will assume they were doused in oil, which make it not worth the calories. 

Guava & cheese thing: 4 stars. Way better shell than the empanada and yummy guava with cheese. I wish the cheese was more melted but when I bit into it, it still looked like a solid block. 

Overall, I would stop by again if I'm in the neighborhood. Perhaps I'd ask for the arepa extra toasted just to make sure there aren't any soggy ones. I definitely want to try to the grilled chicken. I appreciate this small business and the love the put into their food. I fortunately, there were just some issues I couldn't overlook.

Finally, it was Dad's day to pick where HE wanted to eat on Sunday. So off to Viva Las Arepa's we went  I chose a variety of Empanada's and Arepa's for every one to share. My family had never really experienced this type of food before but I was convinced this meal would satisfy there finicky eating habits.  

I selected the Pork Butt Arepa's which had a smokey mesquite flavor and was slathered in a spicy sauce.  The flavors got even better when I drenched the corn cake sandwich in the house made cilantro sauce and the spicy verde hot sauce.  The sauces alone I could drink by the gallon.  The cilantro creamy sauce was so refreshing and had great flavor.  We also had a cheese Arepa and a black bean and cheese Arepa as well both were excellent.  The black beans were seasoned so perfectly and had just the right amount of salt to keep you savoring for more.    

Next on the sampling list was the Empanada's we tried three types the black bean, the cheese and the Veg.  Once again we were not disappointed with the taste and quality of these items selected(at least the parents).  These cheese flavor had a yellow cheddar cheese which went perfectly with the fried corn turnover.  

Overall this place is a must try in Vegas.  This restaurant takes great pride in their food quality and it shows.  They are a gluten free and Non-GMO restaurant which is a win, win for everyone.  Viva Las Arepa's even smokes all their meat in the back of the restaurant which gives the space a delicious smokey scent which makes you want to lick the walls it smells so good.  The staff have always been friendly here and are quick to greet you with a smile.

What I can recommend:  Pork Butt Arepa, Reina Arepa, Garlic Shrimp Arepa, The MOST TENDER RIBS I have has since I made mine last week, Chicharonnes and Yucca - if you love pork, you gotta try this and finally the Cachapas - it is like combining some amazing farm cheeses, romano and my mom's cornbread recipe into  the most amazing CHEESY-CORN experience.  

Great location - under the shadow of the Stratosphere, as you leave the New and begin your journey back into the OLD LV you can get some amazing grub for the ride.

The owner is the nicest guy as well, welcoming and sharing with his knowledge of the food and the story of the place - you must ask him where they began.

2639805,2013-04-21,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"This was my first taste of Venezuelan street food. I'm happy I have it a try. This joint is located right next to Stratosphere so it's easy to find. And great that they opened an actual restaurant versus just operating out of a food truck. The gentleman behind the counter were all smiles and willing to recommend an arepa for first-timers. 

I had the pork butt arepa with cheese, chicken empanadas and fried plantains and passion fruit juice. This came to approximately $15. Not bad for the meal.

I didn't expect the arepa to be so heavy. Imagine an English-muffin like sandwich stuffed to the brim with your meat of choice and cheese. The bread is made of corn flour.  It wasn't bad, but adding their homemade sauces gives it full flavor. The empanada dough was thicker than I'd like but the meat again had a lot of flavor. The plantains were simple. Fried bananas. But it's blandness helped cut the richness of the arepa and empanada.

I admit I couldn't finish the whole thing and I felt as if a boulder was in my stomach when leaving. But Viva Las Arepas was an experience and I urge you to try it. Authenticity is served here.",C8HJdSggJI_MC58vTDBE3g,2,1,3,fS4Qo5yLLra6K6Jso20_Pg

I have eaten lunch here 3 times in the past two weeks... Trying something new everytime!
I have seen several great reviews on this place, so I had to stop and check it out. A little stand in Dino's parking lot that cranks out food with lots of flavor. 

The first visit I tried the most popular item - Shredded Beef Arepa!
2 cornmeal cakes stuffed with shredded beef in the middle that was seasoned perfectly. They then give you a creamy cilantro sauce or hot sauce to put on... 
The creamy cilantro is the best! The sandwich appears small, but don't let it fool you.. It is filling... Thinking it was small, I also tried the chicken empanada! Yum.. It was so good, I kept eating it, although I was full. 

2nd visit, I called ahead of time to have the Hallaca  which is a mixture of beef, pork, chicken, rasins, vegetables, olives, and capers wrapped in cornmeal dough, and finally, wrapped in plantain leaves, tied with string, and boiled after. Top it off with the creamy cilantro.. YUM! Another great combination of flavors you won't experience anywhere else. I also tried a pastelito, the ground beef and rice.. another great choice. 

3rd visit, I went with a cold arepa, the vegetarian.. Lots of great taste, but very hard to eat. It kept sliding so I couldn't take a bite of all the flavors at one time. But the individual flavors did not disappoint. Again, very filling, so don't let the size fool you. 

All 3 visits the food tasted great, fresh and the service from Felix is fantastic.

I looked like a crazy person talking to the birds, but I didn't want to share my arepas!

This food stand literally sits on a corner. It's kind of scary because it is Downtown, but I went around noon, so it wasn't too bad.

The arepas were good! I got the shredded beef. Beef was definitely spilling out of the bread pocket. It was moist and flavorful. They also sell canned sodas.

Pros: the place is very authentic and the tastes are amazing. Highly recommend the chicken and probably second would be the pulled pork. The chicken has a smoke flavor and is marinated or basted in a pretty great sauce. Also highly recommend the green sauce. They have 2 and one is spicy -I stayed away from that one. 

Another concern I know I have when it's clear food is authentic is how sanitary the kitchen is. It seems the best tasting foods come from suspect kitchens - not here. They have an A rating from the food/health inspectors.",x75p0Hr34Gcwf2SONe36jg,2,1,5,ht0-Fvt-R-32UxKJ6I_1sw

Delicious! I can't even tell you how many times we've passed this little spot on trips to downtown during Las Vegas trips past. I'm sure you've passed it a time or two if you are one of those people searching for the ""Pawn Stars"" pawn shop. Located on the corner of Las Vegas. Blvd. and Charleston Blvd not too far from the Stratosphere, this little shack should be added to your LV food agenda. 

Six of us went, and five of us liked it and this is what we had:

Reina peinada- cold chicken salad with a cilantro and avocado cream sauce dressing. A little bland for my taste, but enhanced with some type of salsa they had, it was perfect. Not spicy, but had enough kick to add extra flavor. My wife said it had beer in it, but I couldn't taste it......probably cause I had already been drinking beer.

Ground beef- unanimous favorite of my group. Perfectly seasoned. Didn't need anything. Hot, juicy and flavorful!

Pastrami and cheese- supposed to be cold,  came out hot, probably from grilling the arepa. Not bad, but nothing special I'd say, lose the pastrami and just get one with cheese all on its own cause that's all I really tasted on this one, and the cheese was good.

Agua de panela- sugar cane juice with lime. Picture looks more like piloncillo/panocha, brown sugar-ish. Very tasty. Reminded me of agua de tamarindo or malta which was probably the tang from the lime. Everyone in my group liked it but kept fighting about whether it would go better with tequila or vodka. Guess I'll just have to take both next time to test it out, all in the name of science of course! All in all 
 will have to come back to try other things on the menu. Ran in to a lady in line that was from Venezuela and she said she and her family love it and go there at least once a week because its the real deal",eJBDhJRZhuL49rCNh_QnMQ,0,0,4,xdRQcnQ2h1wzEKJfrRA2ng

* Roasted Pork Butt (Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices)

* Reina Pepiada (Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas)

* Vegetarian (Avocado, Black Beans, Tomatoes, Grilled Peppers, Onions)

I have been satisfied with every one of them. My boyfriend has had the Beef, Pork, and Beef Tongue. His remarks are that they are good, hearty and inexpensive. One is enough for me on each visit because they can fill you up rather quickly. I love their sauces! There is a creamy cilantro dressing and a nice and spicy green sauce, which I drizzle over my Arepa!

Authentic, fresh ingredients, fast and friendly service. This place has become one of my favorite spots to go to when I'm craving Venezuelan food.

Also, don't forget their Hallacas (A mix of beef, pork, chicken, capers, raisins, olives, and vegetables on cornmeal dough, wrapped with plantain leaves, that is bolied) They are like my mother's Central American tamales and they are GOOD!

It seems like everytime I go to any Latin restaurant, I need a real live Rosetta Stone for any questions I have. Either that or I need subtitles when an employee talks to me. LOL.

Anyways, back to my review. I have heard good things about this place from all my Yelp buddies so that alone is good motivation. I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. So you can put two of them together with your choice of meat and other toppings. I ordered carne asada with cheese. I scarfed it down like a it was the last piece of food I will ever see again. They have other delectable choices as well but when you go to a highly recommened place, you get what is popular so their namesake lived up to the hype.

Service is awesome! They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.

As for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.

The only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up. Also they charge 50 cents for using cards to pay for anything under 10 dollars. 

So if I ever make a trip to South America, at least I know what and how good arepas are. VIVA LAS AREPAS!",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,22,17,4,8XVYUvRJYCTPKXBIVIiJNA

So I figured arepas would be a good meal to hold me over without making me feel too full. And for less than $10 I was able to get 2 arepas and a drink. Not a bad deal!

They're open from 3pm to midnight everyday are located on the corner of Wyoming and LV Blvd, in the same parking lot as Dino's. 

An arepa is most like a Venezuelan version of gordita, but it's stuffed with meat, cheese, or whatever else you'd like. I think my favorite part of the whole experience was the masa cake, because it was grilled but still soft and warm inside. They were obviously freshly made, and made really well. 

I got the beef tongue arepa with had tomato, onion, and a green pepper in it. It was very greasy and messy, but not in a bad way where you feel like you need to run 10 miles after eating all that grease. The second arepas was the reina pepiada which was stuffed with cold chicken salad made with chicken, peas, avocado, onion, and was also very messy. They were both amazing tasting, and he gave me 2 sauces to go with them. One was a creamy cilantro-type dressing, and the second was more of a salsa-like one that tasted like it was made out of green peppers.

They chicken also had a the mesquite taste. The empanadas were not my favorite but not terrible either. They were just fried and airy. So when you bite into it there is a huge gap between the meat and the dough. I prefer Mexican style empanadas or Cuban style. These Venezuelans style were not my cup of tea.

So if you're feeling the late night munchers, I'd suggest going with other people. I went with a few yelpers around 10 pm and I was still fearful for my life when this bum haggled us for a dollar. Thanks to Angela H. for making him go away!!! 

Ok with that being said, I can now move on to the real review.

So after the CMYE 51s game, a few of us were still feeling like fatties since baseball food is gross and unfulfilling. After a list of places (Tacos El Gordo, Triple 7, this other taco stand that Anthony M. mentioned which I forgot the name of), we decided on this place. Rolled in about 10 minutes before closing. The workers were not annoyed to see us right before closing. Props to them because I would be irritated seeing people strolling in right before closing. 

The arepa I ordered was delish. It reminded me of a tamale but in sandwhich form. It was packed full of meat and vegetables. Definitely more meat to vegetable ratio, but still a good thing. The bread (or masa or whatever its made of) was flaky and buttery and the meat was tender and cooked just right. Came with a bottle of cilantro mayo sauce thing and some hot sauce. Both made the arepa even more tasty. I could have easily finished mine if it weren't for the beers I drank earlier. 

Definitely a good lunch spot or late night dinner spot if you are in the area. Like I said earlier, just be careful when you get out of your car.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,2,5,f9PssUrFuk5EAinqrIBWUA

Both items I choose were $7, I got an order of fried plantain ($3) and an avocado upgrade ($1 big portion). I like it when people take pride in their food establishment to point people toward stellar items.

I had them place everything so I could eat on the patio-- great green salsa with a nice kick. Garlic shrimp was juicy so be warned because my shirt got hit.. -#12 was good too.

Totally full in a good way- much better choice then the buffet... :) on my face.The do have arepas that are $5 and vegetarian...so one could easily eat for $10 or less. I just wanted to try out more items.

Never heard of Arepas?  You aren't alone.  This was a Yelp find by my girlfriend and we just had to try it. 

Pros:
 +  i Love Arepas !
 + Open late
 + Friendly staff
 + Awesome Hot sauce

Cons:
  -  N/A  

Overall:
  I'm not a Venezuelan expert or anything, but the easiest way to describe it is a Venezuelan version of a taco.  I don't really know how else to explain it ha.  You just gotta try it for yourself!  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.

This place is addicting.  I personally loved the Lengua Arepa... Tongue for those who do not know.  It's located on the north end of the strip.  It's just a little stand with a few tables for seating, but don't judge the book by its' cover.  This was a pleasant surprise!  Next time I go, I'm going to try one of their Fruit Juices... I hear they are pretty good.

Tips:
 -  I didn't know how filling 1 Arepa was.  I ordered 3 Arepas thinking it was equivalent of 3 tacos at say Don Tortacos, but I was wrong.  Arepas are a lot heavier than a taco.  I'd say 2 and your good to go.

-  If you like spicy hot... try their hot sauce.  It has a good kick to it.

-  Don't forget to grab some extra napkins... you're gonna need it.

-  They take card so don't worry if you don't have cash.",G1O-KAFicH00OW14aPfw3g,2,4,5,LbeUiNaC0DJmUCI7IMXp9Q

It's still good, decent, and interesting food, but something seems to have fallen off in terms of quality, flavor, and maybe even cooking technique, I'm not sure. Also, there is a real grunge factor here that was not here when we used to come here a year or two ago.  It just feels dirty now.  Our table was dirty and the bathrooms don't feel sparkly.  The process to put away your tray basket is just a little off-putting--at the trash can, it's just gross.  This is kind of like how Rubio's does it, but they're a chain.  They should have someone come pick up the baskets. No one comes by to wipe down the tables, or brush crumbs off seats.  The customer service seems lacking.They can't control the weird folks who come in here for arepas--a delicious specialty of Venezuela; think Jamaican beef patties.  But with the proper atmosphere, they would attract a less volatile crowd, for lack of a better word.  It used to be trendy, now it feel grungy.  Does that make sense? It may depend on what time of day or what day of the week you come.  A Sunday night, when we went, might not be its best.

With that said, if you have a hankering for Venezuelan food, or arepas in particular, you could do a lot worse than here.  The chicken (salad) arepas are unique with a piquant taste (not quite spicy).  I prefer the grilled chicken, and then pork or beef arepas, which are chock full of meat with crispy corn covering.  Vegetables are not too big here, but there is lettuce. Parking can be challenging.  It is a small lot.",NrpzAH3EoNhWUR8OysUhBQ,3,1,3,Q5adrRYLvxOReY3WyS4rnQ

You will not go wrong with anything you eat here. Top it off with great service, lots of seating, and a fun restaurant, and you've got one of our go-to places when we're downtown! You won't be disappointed!",-WCWlsVGhxaLQMfpKuuKhw,3,1,5,8YQmtCyGgnjt1zXuQP_npw

I'm not sure what an Arepas was and how to pronounce it (nor do I even now!) but I can tell you it's wonderful!

The location is right across from another gem of mine, Luv It Frozen Custard on Oakey and LV Blvd.  Not sure how packed this place can get, but parking could become a problem.  I visited Saturday afternoon and didn't have too many issues.

So back to the food... I would describe an arepas as almost a Latin gyro sandwich.  Where you have a pita bread pocket stuffed with delicious meat.  You have several fillings to choose from, all of which are only $5!.  They also include a bottle of garlic sauce and hot sauce which helps add to the flavor of this pocket of tastiness.

I have seen this wonderful item many times on television, so when the opportunity came up to try it, I immediately jumped on the opportunity.

The restaurant, itself, was good sized and in an accessible location. Being just north of the Strip, it was pretty easy to get to. The restaurant has a fast-casual feel. If you want to grab and go, you can (but be advised that the food is prepared to order), or if you want to sit and relax you can. We decided to take in the environment, so we ate it.

The arepas were very delicious. They appear to be relatively small compared to similar items from different cuisines, but they were definitely filling. In this small package contained a plethora of great flavor profiles. We order several different arepas which include the roasted pork, ham and cheese, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. All were very good as we particularly enjoyed the roasted pork. Accompanying sauce were also flavorful and added to the depth of the arepas.

We also ordered the chicaronnes. This isn't all skin, but meat and skin. Deep fried goodness. This also came with fried yucca which almost resembled fat french fries. Excellent flavor - especially with the green sauce.

Defnitely worth the adventure when you're in Vegas.

Similar to the Salvadoran pupusas, Viva Arepas maybe the best value you will get in Vegas.  If you're boring and only eat chicken strips and mash potatoes and god forbid don't like flavor, then don't come here.

But for $4 you will be taken through a bold and flavorful journey.  The masa cornmeal patty has the perfect texture, crisp on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.  We had the shredded chicken based on a few locals who were parked at the bench. 

The shredded beef emapanadas were pretty good but the arepas are the star of the show.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the meats.  I look forward to coming back VERY soon to try their lengua and pork butt.

My boyfriend's been telling me about this place for a long time but I've always kind of been like... are they tacos? Why don't we just get tacos? Wrong. 

I ordered the #7 (chicken and avocado) and #13 (corn and cheese) and my boyfriend got the #1 (wood fired chicken) and #2 (wood fired beef) along with fried plantains and the cane sugar drink. The drink was an interesting flavor.. sweet but sour/bitter as well. The plantains were bite sized and syrupy, probably could have skipped on those. The real winners are their arepas (duh). I really enjoyed the chicken avocado. It had shredded chicken and a creamy avocado mayo sauce that didn't make the arepa soggy. The maize.. buns? Are similar to a tamale but harder. After eating the chicken avocado I figured my boyfriend's wood fired chicken would be boring and dry but the flavor was amazing, having been cooked with mesquite wood. This was probably my favorite. The beef was similar but I felt the chicken soaked up the flavor of the wood better. The surprise dish was the cheese and corn (my boyfriend's favorite. We thought it was going to be cheese and corn in the arepa but it was actually more of a corn pancake with cheese. I wish I knew what kind of cheese, it was fairly mild and reminded me of feta in texture. This is a huge portion so I recommend sharing. 

Overall I was delighted to be introduced to Venezuelan food and arepas and I'm already looking forward to bringing others here to share the love! Location isn't awesome but it's part of the charm.

I came here with two of my classmates and we almost sampled every item on the menu. I personally ordered the garlic shrimp arepa; tequenes pastelitos; fried plantains; cheese empanada; and a mango beverage. The tequenes was the worst of them all; which contained an uncooked cheese stick in the middle. The arepa contained baby sized shrimp and was too fishy for my taste. The cheese empanada was tasty and the cheese was actually melted; mango beverage way too sweet; and the plantains while having a nice flavor were extremely greasy.

When you double your prices you got to do something different. Bigger sandwiches, something. These arepas are very good and a nice change from the usual Mexican food in LA, but it's not a good value. I would be perfectly happy paying $3, not the $6 I paid. The bread was clearly made fresh and it was good. The beef was very well seasoned. Unfortunately I wasn't satisfied. I would have been fine buying two for $6 but not 2 for $12. To be full you need 2 which makes the cost of these ridiculous!

3198654,2011-12-20,2,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"For arepas (corn flour sandwiches), Viva Las Arepas is definitely one of the best places in town. I came here the third day it was open, when it was still called I Love Arepas and when signage wasn't as visible and impressive. I met Felix, the owner. He really prides himself on his recipe for his corn masa bread. He has the bread ready and preps everyday. He has trays of the bread and when you order, he heats up the bread for you right in front of you for you to see. What you might not know is that his back is aching just so you can see what he is doing because he set the grill up lower, so whenever he cooks, he really has to bend over and strain his neck for you to see how he's cooking everything in the trailer.

The trailer is where all the business and eating is done. His storage is right next to Dino's Neighborhood Bar. If you ever ask him, he might show you. His storage is filled with Corn Flour. His arepas are Venezuelan. Arepas are also really popular in Colombia. Anyway, he uses the freshest ingredients. His aguas (juices) are from concentrate and blended with filtered water. He has guanabana (soursop), guayaba (guava), parchita (passion fruit) and mango (mango, lol). 

My favorite sandwich is the

Reina Pepiada: Fresh chicken with avocado cream sauce, great textures and came out piping hot, so it was really delicious. 

I have tried many of the other sandwiches. They're all really delicious. The empanadas are filled with fresh meats. Their dessert, quesillo, was really delicious. Even though Felix doesn't like it being compared with a cheese flan, I felt that would be how I would describe quesillo to anyone. 

This might look like a fast food joint to you, but he really takes the time to care about and cook his food. He enjoys telling people about the process of making his food. I enjoy listening to chefs talk about how they make their food. 

 I had a great experience all five times that I went to this place. I think that everybody in town should try to hit up this spot at least once. It's really a gem.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,4,3,5,c6-b-UKfz7ePL5U8vXIHLg

I don't believe I have ever tried Venezuelan food... but I was definately wanting to try this place for a while. Small corner place in a tiny little plaza on Las Vegas Blvd in the down town area. Booths on the sides of the restaraunt & tables in the center. 

You order your food & then you pick up your food when they call your name. There are two different digital menus.. one in English & one in Spanish.

CARNE ASADA AREPAS $5.50 - comes w/ lettuce & tomato... we also added avocado for $0.99 more. The meat was very tender & the maize dough was soft yet grainy... it was definitely new for me but good. Reminds me of a tamale made differently. Ahhahaaa 

CHICKEN EMPANADA $3 - hot & good like a chicken dumpling deed fried w/ dough shell rather than wonton shell 
BEEF EMPANADA $3 

GUAVA PASTELITOS $3 - this was like an empanada shaped differently & it was filled w/ guava chunks & cheese. Very interesting combination but it worked

COCONUT PASTELITOS $3 - wasn't too fond of this since I'm not a big fan of shredded coconuts that is used for desserts because it gets wayyy to fake kinda sweet taste, but this also had cheese in it so it wasn't toooo sweet.",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,8,4,4,uhbDrGshYOGm4wLYLwMNlw

A couple of buddies told me about this place and how they have cheap yet satisfying food. My cousin and I took a trip on a Tuesday afternoon for some grub. The restaurant is located on the left when going north on Las Vegas Blvd on Wyoming. The place is quite clean and large with tables and booths.  

There are pictures of their food items posted all over the restaurant. Those helped with familiarizing myself with their food items but didn't help in the sense for me to choose what I wanted since they all looked so delicious! 

After reading Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from the girl behind the counter, my cousin and I decided to get the Reina Pepiada. In between two warm cornbread slices, there was shredded chicken breast with avocado, mayo, cilantro and green peas. The consistency was almost like a chicken salad. I was a little thrown off with how warm the cornbread slices were and how cold the chicken concoction was. But I got past this in a hot minute and chowed down happily. 

We were given a red bottle (spicy hot sauce) and a yellow bottle (mild hot sauce) to have with our arepas. A little sprinkle of some hot sauce (I like the spicy but the mild is good, too) with each bite is key to elevate flavors. And a side note, don't be fooled by the ""small"" size of the arepa. This little baby fills you up. I walked out of there overly stuffed. 

To wash it all down, we each ordered a fruit juice. What's cool is that they let you try samples before you buy one. My cousin ordered the guava juice and I ordered the mango. I expected the juices to be a little thick, but they weren't. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. I think I will end up craving their mango juice during the hot Vegas summer months.

If you find a silly Asian girl chanting ""long live the arepa!"" here, that's me. If you find a female Asian bum on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming with a sign that says ""will work for arepas,"" that's me, too. That being said, you all get the point.

I would award the pork butt a distant second place, it was a good one to start with, I like to end with my favorite flavors :) 

For the arepa newbie, just because they look small doesn't mean they aren't super filling... 2 is sufficient for a hungry person, 2.5 if you're slightly hungrier, and 3 you are willing to sacrifice stomach comfort for the experience of more flavors.

The interior was very clean and they even have a bilingual menu with a wide assortment of options beyond just arepas. 

The portions are large. Even with a healthy appetite I was only able to eat one of the two arepas I ordered. The bean and cheese arepa was delicious, but just a little on the bland side of flavor. The shredded beef arepa was more flavorful. They have a spicy green mole sauce and a tangy cilantro sauce which are served with your food, if you enjoy more flavor.

The service itself was attentive, well thought out, friendly and helpful.

These arepas and empanadas are the hottest things to come out of Venezuela since their women! While they lack a sultry accent and their physical appearance isn't as stunning, these bites are just as alluring as any Venezuelan vixen.

In pursuit of another worthy eating destination away from The Strip, I learned of Viva Las Arepas from a local. It is on S. Las Vegas Blvd at Oakey just north of The Stratosphere. Before they were here, they operated out of a food stand.

The shredded chicken empanada ($2.75) was warm and crispy. After taking the first bite to expose the inside, I recommend throwing some of their green sauce into that bad boy to kick up the spice. 

My garlic shrimp arepa ($7) was piping hot (in temperature) so I had to wait for it to cool down. It was moist and slightly started falling apart on me as I ate it. They stuff it with plenty of juicy shrimp so it was satisfying despite the challenge of taking it in. All other arepas cost less than the shrimp one. The shredded beef/Mechada ($6) is often my go to arepa.

You can bet I'll be back to get some nice Venezuelan ass too (or ""pork butt"" as it's called on their menu).

This area isn't particularly desirable or Vegasy but I'll take some arepas and empanadas over uninspiring overpriced Strip food any day. For those that are on a mission to find quality authentic food, and couldn't care less about glitz and glamour, this is your place! 

Plus, the highly acclaimed Art of Flavors (gelato) is right next door (update/edit: it really isn't anymore as the Chef now works at Gelatology).",fG-K5NglgWxHg8PNu62afg,17,17,4,av2qBra7Go4mgeHiwjtHSQ

I have never had one before so I really can't compare arepa to arepa, but these little guys are so delicious for about $5 a pop!  Cheap delicious eats!

Here is what we tried:
1. Reina peplada: the most popular.  Chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  Served cold.  What is not to love???
2. Pork butt: it is delicious with cheese added!  Soft pork, sorta like a pulled pork sandwich.
3. Woodfire beef: with tomato, lettuce, and onion.  Tender beef with all the veggies.
4. Garlic shrimp: fully loaded and can be served hot or cold. 
5. Fried yucca and pork rinds: this was surprisingly delicious!  I was scared about eating pork rinds but they went well with the yucca!  It's like interesting fries :)

- right across the street from Luv-It's Frozen Custard!

I love it all, there isn't one dish i don't like and i am sure you will agree. The food  however is a bit heavy and very filling, ordera few things to share. 

Cachapa con queso or pabellon (corn pancake with cheese or pabellon style) Deliciously sweet and salty, moist and just made to order.

The empanadas are excellent too, deep fried and full of flavor. Get any of the meats with this.

The arepas are great too, our staple. The masa is thin and generously filled with the works. I like it with pabellon as well because that style has cheese, plantains, shredded beef and not too much of black beans cooked to a mush. 

You can also get a side of fried plantains (sweet and browned). And the green sauces? put that $#!t on everything!

I had a passion fruit juice (parchita) which was just okay. You can't expect them to get the real fruit there, in the middle of the desert!I would go with a soda or malta. Or keep it light with some water, free.

The Arepa is their specialty. To me it was sort of the ingredients of a gourmet tamale in different proportions turned into a sandwich. Basically they make a  corn tortilla about 1/4"" thick, grill it up, then add your choice of several delicious fillings. They give a couple of types of sauces that can be used with it, they also are outstanding: a pepper sauce and a creamy muted garlic sauce. And the cutie at the counter also implored us to get the yucca fries, and holy moley was she spot on- they blew us away.

And they're open until midnight and have easy parking right in front, steps away. Had our meal in my hands within 5 minutes.

I eat these arepas on an annual basis - and it's consistently awesome, even through the transition from the tiny walk-up stand/shack to its new restaurant location (on the next block over). I had never been to the physical location before, and decided to check it out this time. My friend and I got to the restaurant at like 11:58PM and they close at midnight (oops), but Felix welcomed us warmly and insisted we eat there as opposed to getting it to-go. We both wanted the reina pepiada arepa, but they only had enough for one so he gave us an extra beef arepa and the cachapas for FREE! After I ordered I asked what a 'pastelito' was, and when our food came out, he brought out an order of the guava pastelitos...for FREE. That man is so dang NICE.

-Wood-fire beef arepa ($5): Really good meat - I like the shredded beef better, but this wood-fire technique is apparently new? Good savory flavor but I personally like the shredded texture better - less meat falls out with each bite.
-Reina pepiada arepa ($5): I normally dislike mayonnaise, but this is sooo good. The chicken+cilantro+flavors+avocado are like the best chicken salad you've ever had.
-Cachapas ($5): Never had this before, we loved it! thick gooey cheese between SWEET corn pancake thingies. They weren't tortillas - more like thin cornmeal pancakes, and were sweet. Sweet and sorta salty from the cheese. So. Good.
-Guava and cheese pastelito ($2): Reminded me of wontons but filled with guava jam and chunks of chewy cheese. Again great flavor - sweet from the guava but savory from the dough and cheese.

Everyone working there was so nice - we definitely were the last people in the dining room, and they didn't rush us at all even though Felix told us when we left he had to be back there at 7:30 the next morning! I felt so bad but the overall experience was seriously awesome. This is for sure on my list anytime I go to Vegas.",nbAsseRd4MTq_JApjeBZyA,4,2,5,H6sWpF5Pa-py2IjSdVgzFA

We stopped by on our way to fremont street from the strip. It was almost empty at the time (9:30 pm ish) but the place seemed clean and well kept. The lady that rang us up was super friendly and patient with us as we were not too familiar with the menu.

I got the carne asada and jamon y queso (ham & cheese) arepas with a guava and cheese pastelito for dessert and the passionfruit drink.

First off, these arepas are HUGE. I eat a lot, and 1 1/2 of these bad boys sure filled me up.

They're not skimpy on the fillings at all. It may not look like it at first glance, but these arepas are STUFFED to the brim. The carne asada was seasoned well, and there was this melty, gooey cheese literally spilling out of my ham and cheese arepa. My boyfriend gave me a bite of his Reina Pepiada and I really digged the avocado and cilantro sauce that it was cooked in.

I was a bit confused on the guava and cheese pastelito as they put a piece of actual cheese (think of almost like a squeaky mozarella cheese curd) needless to say, I was expecting cream cheese like they serve in Miami. But I'm familiar with cheese being dessert so it was interesting.

For hangover pre-medication, try the sugar cane juice with lime.  For $1.50, you can't go wrong.

I've never had arepas before, but it's a weird mix between a taco and slider inside of a crumbly white corn bun. The bun to me is what really separates it from anything else. It's like cornbread, texture wise with not much taste. Wasn't exactly my favorite part of the meal. It did have a good crunch from them coming on the griddle though. 

The filing is very similar to tacos. We got the wood fire beef (#1) which is like diced beef, pork belly (#4?), and chicken (#7). The best was the beef. The pork belly reminded me of frozen pre made pulled pork with heavy sauce. The chicken was way too over sauced and the sauce was just creamy, no flavor.

The food also came with two sauce, a spicy sauce, and the same sauce they used with the chicken arepa. The spicy sauce was very forgettable, hardly any spice. The cream sauce way actually decent and tasted better in smaller doses then flooded with chicken.

Everything came out hot and fresh. They weren't as big as I thought they would be though, so it's definitely an awesome spot to have an afternoon bite!


Customer service is awesome and the place is clean!

LOCATION: Does not appear to be the safest location (fyi), but it is closest conveniently close to the strip. A block or two away from the Stratosphere and also behind a neighbor filled with hipsters and retirees. It's cultured to say the least. Depending on when you go, the parking lot is not to spacious and there's always ongoing traffic... just be careful.

VENUE: Stands out with its bright yellow interior. It makes me feel mellow and happy to be inside &good memories every time I drive past. There's also Venezuelan gelato shop right next door which its it feel very authentic. Along with the yellow, the photos of the menu all around and make my mouth watery as I try to figure out what to order.
Music is welcoming and the bathroom is clean and might I add, cozy. Find out for yourself, lol.

CUSTOMER SERVICE: Very accommodating, always friendly as well as fast.

FOOD: There are two sauces you have to try!
I always get my garlic shrimp arepa along with an empanada or two.... along with some fries and rice if I'm really hungry.
The first time I came with my vegan friend and she devoured as much as I did on her own terms, so I'd always like to think this place is vegan-friendly.
I'm never disappointed with my order because the food is always consistent and more than anything else, delicious!

OVERALL: I've recommended this place numerous times to people. I've tried an arepa from a food truck and nothing compares to VIVA LAS AREPAS! I've been in love with this place since it was a small food stand and if you're craving something that you fill you up with warmth and carbs.

I usually don't like corn based stuff like corn tortillas, but these are the exception.  I always get the pork butt with cheese. It is a little salty but very tasty.  The light green sauce will balance out the saltiness though.  I am obsessed with that sauce by the way.  I believe it is cilantro based? I have yet to try the other kinds they offer.

On to the place... the place is located in a dingy area of Las Vegas.  Parking can be tricky as it is limited and awkward.  It is located in a triangular intersection off of Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd.  However, once inside, the place is pleasant and clean and the employees are very friendly.  It seemed like they just upgraded their menu displays to flat screens.  I like how they have it in Spanish and English.

The food is very unique, and it's important to point out I learned that this restaurant is gluten free. I love the simplicity of ingredients focused on quality. 

Imo, the meat is special because they are cooked with a traditional grill using wood which is a layer of flavor that is very distinct.

I ordered some take out: Asada Arepas, Empanada with beans & cheese and for deserts-Guava and cheese Pastelito.

Each arepa on the menu is only around $5-7 depending on what's inside it. You can add extra toppings like cheese, avocado, fried egg for .50 - $1.00. 

The sauces were also excellent, not too salty, watery or too thick.

I had been here in the past, so I'm very well acquainted with the reina pipiada  arepa (stuffed with chicken salad avocado mix) which is one of my favorites, chicharron arepa, and steak arepa.. All favorites. I wanted something different, so I opted for the smoked pork ribs with a side of rice and beans and a cachapa. Oh lord.. Here it goes!

Smoked pork ribs- so tender it fell off the bones. The flavor was robust and a touch smokey, but not overwhelming. Just plain delicious.
Black beans- almost tasted like chili beans... I ate them all.
Rice- was yummy and like that it's mixed with corn and peas.
Cachapa- I can eat these all day everyday. It's a sweet and savory corn pancake stuffed with ooey gooey mozzarella cheese. This dish alone will ruin any plans of obtaining that coveted 6pack. Stay away for it is HIGHLY addictive. 

I fell in love with the food, but most importantly, with the friendly staff. They were also quite perceptive because as our server was ready to deliver the food, he noticed the table was wobbly, so he immediately bent down to adjust it. He came by a few times to check on us and made sure we were completely satisfied. I sure was. 

Viva las arepas is a no brainer, and I will most certainly return until I have conquered every dish they have. Thank god pool season is over.",d4XCDUWioKG1XxzSzCkbTA,3,2,5,OjB-Z_TQ1eqEPazBMwAH7g

Long awaited update, and first time in the brick and mortar location. Glad to see that they offer more than just Arepas now, and are open 24 hours on weekends.

Perusing the menu, a couple of things caught my attention-Pabellon, and Cachapa.
Too bad they didn't have the two combined, because I've been searching for that killer combination after having it at Pica Pica Maize Kitchen in Napa.
http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pica-pica-napa-2?select=D2QDnqVaFYS7EpRd-4XTqQ#Eo2CTtCtgsNwu0ZAaFIeiQ

Having already tried a few of the Arepas, we ordered both the Cachapa and Pabellon to share as well as their tasty Soursop Drink. These were both pretty good, but I wished they would offer more ways to have the cachapa than just cheese.fillings, or even a pabellon cachapa? (hint, hint!) maybe like any of the arepas  The Arepas are okay, but I just am not much of a fan of that masa pocket that holds all the fillings together, kinda like a Mexican Gordita which I'm also not really a fan of.

If worse comes to worse, I might even just order a cachapa and ask them to add the meat and plantains inside and charge me extra...that is, if and when a craving hits, because we're almost always next door anyway!  ALOHA!!!

The pork butt and the chicken/mayo/avocado arepa were on my list to try. The pork butt hands down was my favorite. The other was very fresh and creamy a very good just not what I wanted after scarfing down the delicious pork arepa.

3698047,2015-04-09,4,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"So, they're basically like tortas, but the ""bread"" part is less like your typical starchy bread. The bread is like an english muffin (in this case I'm going to make it up and say it's more like a Venezuelan muffin than an english muffin) with a soft corn tortilla texture or flavor (because that is what it probably is).

I ordered the WOOD FIRED CHICKEN, PORK BUTT, CARNE ASADA arepa. You know they hold true to their word when they say wood fired when you can see the wood that they cook the meat in stacked in an area where you can see. Also, you can taste that delicious smoky, wood fired flavor in your meats. I'm no wood connoisseur so unfortunately I can't tell you what type of wood they used based on the flavor of the meats. I also don't eat wood on a regular (insert laughing emoji here).

You get the option of adding cheese ($0.50) and avocado ($0.99) for an extra charge. Based on experience, unless you're really lactose intolerant, I suggest you DEFINITELY get cheese. If you're feeling adventurous, add that avocado (and then pat yourself on the back for being so damn awesome). Also, add that green sauce. It'll take your mouth on a journey it has never been before. Put all that together, and what do you call that? A fiesta.

If you're on a date (like I was), I would say, pick THREE different arepas, or if you're the type who can eat food the size of a water buffalo, I would pick one of everything, and then...SHARE! 

REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD SHARE:

1.) It makes more strategic sense to be able to conquer every food item on the menu in one shot
2.) Sharing is caring (DUH!)
3.) It makes a perfect talking point during your date (""What's your favorite?"" ""Oh, I like the wood fired chicken."" ""Oh I like the wood fired chicken too."") 
4.) Diversifying is important
5.) Again, variety people. VARIETY!
6.) It's fun

Located on the corner of LV Blvd & Oakey, Viva Las Arepas is smack dab in the middle of what I'd consider a downtown hot spot, neighboring other local favorites - Vickie's (formerly Tiffany's) Diner, Art of Flavors, Dino's, Albo Pizza, Olympic Gardens, and that little shack that was once Goodwich.

They have a decent-sized menu with plenty of affordable combo options. I usually order the 3 chicken breasts + rice + beans for $6.99, along with a can of Coke for another $1.25, which is a pretty sweet deal to me since I'm always leaving with leftovers I can enjoy the next day. Their arepas are pretty tasty too, of course! And you can stuff 'em with whatever meats, cheeses, etc., you desire.

3708469,2016-07-12,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"All the food here was incredible. We ordered a few arepas, wood fired beef, chicharrones and yuca, and we simply loved all of it. 

   We enjoyed the chicharrones with fried yuca, since they were tasty and not overly dry. They made a really nice side dish. Now the arepas. I was initially afraid that they might be small for the price ($5-$6), but they were fairly large and packed with meat. The arepa dough itself was perfect: crispy on the outside and moist/mushy underneath. The garlic shrimp arepa was delicious and I like how they served it cold. It held a good number of plump shrimp and tons of great garlic flavor. 

   While the shrimp was good, the best thing I ate was the wood fired chicken arepa. The chicken was amazingly good. Very tender and wonderful smoky flavor. The wood fired beef was delicious as well, as it too was tender and smoky. I was quite impressed when I saw employees wheeling in wooden logs through the back to the smoker. You wouldn't expect a restaurant like this to have a smoker dedicated to smoking the meat, but Viva Las Arepas does, and this becomes clearly evident when you taste the meat.

   Overall, this instantly became one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, and I'd love to come back. The food is cheap and delicious.",rGdqwZViTrUKFPi74SToiQ,0,0,5,GwEpH4v6Z9pQcBRM6tzbDA

Spoke with the owner for a while and he let me try some juices and my wife try the #7 meat before we bought as she is not a fan of mayo but she really dug it.

This place is also open late and is priced pretty reasonably. the portions are perfectly sized and around 3.50 each and IMO a good deal. 

This is a great little spot and I will be back for sure...anyone complaining or hatin on this place is prob a whiny fu*^%n bi&*h and used to eatin taco bell and should prob head back there.

In addition to mindless betting, grandeur casinos, and endless shopping boutiques, Las Vegas is about good eating, and there is a lot of it. I was feeling a little disinterested from fine dining everyday during my little Vegas weekend getaway so my date wanted me to try his cherished best kept secret in Las Vegas which is now one of my treasured eateries that I look forward to trying again upon my next visit.

Located just outside of The Strip near The Stratosphere, Viva Las Arepas wouldn't be noted to be in the prettiest part of the neighborhood. As well as the establishment is not the most elegant, the food was spectacular.

Without knowing exactly what an arepa was, I ordered the Reina Pepiada, a cold chicken salad covered in avocado and mayonnaise dressing whilst my date ordered a wood-fired chicken arepa. We added an additional cheese empanada for me, and a beef empanada for him since I have never had an empanada either.

Once our order was ready, my Reina Pepiada arepa reminded me of an overstuffed torta, but better! and once I tasted my arepa I knew this place was a special gem. The avocado mayonnaise sauce is really something that distinctively brought out the flavours. They also provide two bottles of their signature sauces; reach for the lighter green + garlic one, it is pure heaven, I wasn't shy to spread it all over my food.

The cheese empanada was still warm with gooey cheese. For just 3 dollars, this was delish! They also threw in a little extra extra for us; a sweet guava + cheese pastry, mm!

I cannot stop noting about Viva Las Arepas to my friends and other fellow Yelpers, this is one place not to be missed. I mean, if it wasn't for the cheese empanada order with the surprise sweet treat, I would order two of these on my next return x",o6vl8qOKbNBJZ_rL1G8n5g,19,17,5,E-Rl3322GXJV_PNhuB6p-w

My friends felt the same way too and were so underwhelmed that we wondered why they have such awesome reviews from everyone else. Well I gave them another chance and I read Melissa Y.'s review before I ordered and she had suggested an Arepa that has a grilled meat. Well since I sometimes try to be on that healthy grind I had the grilled chicken Arepa and boy was she right it was sure tasty. There's 2 sauces they have on the side 1 that comes in a clear bottle and the other in a red bottle. The one in the clear is like a creamy herb sauce similar to Cafe Rio's ranch sauce but less creamy and more ""herby,"" I like it and gives the Arepa more flavor. I wasn't too sure about the red bottle, but my friends liked it as well and said the heat is good and slowly builds on you. Initially people are a little confused on how to describe what exactly an Arepa is. I was sort of describing it as a Taco bell Chalupa or Indian bread sandwiched together, however I was way off because my friend described it as an English Muffin made with corn meal, which is exactly what it is! The inside of this palce is very clean and depending on how busy it is will determine how long it will take  for your food. I was there last night and they served my friends within 5 minutes, but another time they took awhile like 10 to 15 minutes if I remember correctly. I also like the fact they are open late and next to Art of Flavors.

I accidentally stumbled upon this place on a random Sunday after work when the original noodle joint we were going to was closed. Prior to this, I can't say I've ever tried an arepa, but from that day on, I was hooked. 

An arepa is a grilled, round, cornmeal patty, which is then stuffed with your choice of meat or filling. The most popular is the reina pepiada, which is filled with grilled chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro. It's pretty much a Venezuelan chicken salad sandwich. I also tried the wood fire beef with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese. You can't go wrong with your choices, but my favorite is the reina pepiada for the avocado and cilantro. Also, try the spicy salsa verde with everything! I'm less of a fan of the white sauce.

Although the serving size is perfect, for only $5, you'll be salivating for more. I also always get a side of the fried yucca root, which I prefer over french fries. If you're craving something sweet, the fried plantains are nice too.

This place has grew over the years to this new massive location and I can see why, Viva las Arepas is consistently busy! Must be the lovely little handheld Arepa that keep attracting this crowd of gastro daredevils.

Looking at the huge menu it's hard to decide from all the tasty choices, and simple ask of what's popular to the cashier will leave you satisfied. By recommendation I got the wood-fired shredded beef arepa(with cheese *A must!*) and a shredded beef empanada while my guest decided to go for the chicken breast with avocado and cilantro arepa. Omg these savory little corn meal sandwiches are awesome! It has deep flavors that keep you wanting more, everything taste so fresh and homemade not any of that frozen precooked junk that gets passed off on the daily from something so widely known. They also have one of the best hot sauces that I've tasted in Vegas, the suttle spice and richness of the sauce reminded me of La Vic's orange sauce for all you Bay Area folk, and a creamy cilantro sauce to cut the spice if it's not for you!

I will definitely be back here, although for the actual size it could be kinda pricey $4-6 depending on filling and +.50-1.00 for avocado and cheese.

And I know it well. 

Honestly: I don't. I have never had Venezuelan cuisine until I came here. But I have indeed come here. A lot. I have no clue what I am doing here or how they do it but I know it is outstanding. And inexpensive. And I can avoid yuppies most of the time here. (That alone makes it worthwhile. [Stay in Summerlin.])

No tourists here and that is fine. Maximum occupancy: 68, so there is no room for all of 'Middle America'. 

Not good for kids*. (*Unless your kids are Venezuelan.)

Pro Tip: Get off at the White Cross Drugs-Pharmacy-Market whatever stop if on the deuce. Deuce! Tourists are welcome here!

I ordered a Reina Pepiada, an arepa made with shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  I also got a coconut and cheese pastelito for a dessert.  For my drink, I had asked the clerk about the Malta Polar, a Venezuelan soda, made with molasses instead of sugar.  He said he liked it and I gave it a try.  It was tasty--a bit strong--but it was curiously refreshing.  Wait, that one's taken!  It was very good and it was a good accompaniment for lunch.

When he brought my food, he also brought the three squeeze bottles of sauces.  The red bottle--this is a nice spicy sauce that gave the arepas some kick.  The yellow bottle had a spicy cilantro sauce and this too had a kick.  The white bottle had the mild sauce, but it was OK.  I tried it and then went back to the premium grades.

Coconut and cheese seemed an odd combination to me, but I love coconut, so I had to give this a go.  What a pleasant treat!  The cheese mixed with the coconut had a symbiotic relationship and they went well together.

Aside from the hilarious name of the restaurant, this place has some seriously good food! We never eat on the strip when in Vegas because it's overpriced and generally not very good. This place made it to the top of our search because of it's high ratings, and this time, Yelp did not let us down. 

Arepas, for those that don't know, are maize (corn) dough stuffed with meat or other fillings and toppings. It's a Latin spin on a pita-like sandwich. Although I have nothing to compare this to, I was very impressed. The bread was hot and fluffy and sweet - everything you love about corn-based bread. We got the Wood Fire Beef and Reina Pepiada (a chicken salad with avocado, mayo, and cilantro). I liked that we got one with hot filling and one with cold filling. We also ordered fries, which were just standard frozen fries, but they were piping hot and crispy, so they were perfect.

My last visit I ordered the Wood Fire Mix Grill (for two people), consisting of chicken, beef, pork ribs and sausage with two sides for $22.99.  The ribs (which are large spare ribs) and the chicken were excellent; the beef was a little dry and it had a little bit too much spice.  I guess it was a brisket but over spiced and too dry.  The sausage was flavorful but I didn't care for the texture of it.  My sides were the fried Yucca plant and rice with vegetables, which were decent.  I also had the plantains, which were excellent.

Their specialty, of course, are the Venezualn corn cakes, or arepas. They are served warm and freshly cooked. I ordered a chicken (hot) and shrimp (cold) arepa along with a beef empenada. My favorite was the shrimp. The cold filling and the warm arepa made for a great combo. The shrimp was in a garlic, parsley sauce that was not too rich and very garlicky! It was delicious. The chicken, I was not so crazy about. I am not sure if it was deliberate or not, but there was a sourness to it that made it unappetizing. The beef in the empenada was only okay. It was a seasoned ground beef. I thought it would be more of a pulled or chopped beef.  The star throughout the meal was the corn cake: warm, nice texture, not too oily was great. Prices were decent, with the shrimp being the most expensive of my dishes at $5. 

The location is a little sketchy and a little difficult to get to with all the one way streets everywhere, but definitely worth the effort.

FOOD:
Arepas cannot be accurately described by words. They must be experienced, and the best place to experience it is at Viva Las Arepas. 

 Reina Pepiada- Chicken Breast mixed with Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro. Such a great flavor profile.

Pabellón- Beef, Black Beans, Plantains & Cheese. This is my second favorite, the beef is cooked perfectly. The beans and plantains compliment the beef and we all know cheese makes everything better

The empenadas are also delicious, try them all. They're like a dollar, stop being so cheap and try all of them. You're welcome.

I've had Viva Las Arepas on my radar for a while.  I just never get to visit this part of town all that often.  Since we went for a last hurrah at the Art of Flavors next door, we figure why not get an arepa to go as well?  Off to Viva Las Arepas we were!

Décor is nice inside, very spacious with another large outdoor veranda area.  It wasn't too busy on a Saturday night, only a few patrons on several of their tables.  But I did notice that the take out business was steady.  Lots of folks going in and out.  I was never familiar with arepas, all I knew was that they were a type of Venezuelan street food.  Any kind of street food sounds tasty to me!

Our cashier was gracious and asked us if we had been to Viva Las Arepas before.  We told him no so he proceeded to let us know what an arepa is and some of their most popular flavor combinations.  Basically, an arepa is a round patty made of cornmeal, grilled, then stuffed with various meats and cheeses.  Sold!  Had to try one (or two).  We ordered to go:

-Wood Fire Beef Arepa
-Reina Pepiada Arepa (chicken breast, avocado, mayo & cilantro)
-Fried Plantains

Waiting wasn't long, and before I knew it we were ready to go.  But, all our food came in one tiny plastic bag.  I was like, ""This all our order?  Salsa on the side too?""  Dude was, ""Yep, you're all set.  Salsa in little containers, two each.""  Really?  Bag wasn't that heavy at all.

Take it home and I'm already antsy for some grub 30 minutes later.  Open up the bag - one round Styrofoam container.  One long Styrofoam container.  Hmmm...am I missing an arepa?  Turns out, nope!  These arepa thingies are just a bit on the small side.  They really are.  Smaller than a sandwich, but bigger than a cookie.  What gives?  I felt like I was Godzilla with this little itty-bitty snack in my hand.  But, that morsel of arepa was pretty good!  I had the Reina Pepiada, arepa was still warm, crispy on the outside, but some good chew on the inside.  Chicken with avocado, mayo & cilantro made for a great filling.  Very tasty, and a good kick with their house green salsa.  Wifey liked the taste of her Wood Fire Beef arepa, goot hint of smoke with moist beef.  Fried plantains were good too, but that's really hard to mess up.  Overall, this was a good SNACK.  Guys my size would need two arepas to make a MEAL.  But, at around $5 a pop per arepa...for $10 you can go to the local Chinese buffet!  I liked Viva Las Arepas but not sure I would go out of my way that often to get it.  But the experience was good, and I would gladly have another arepa from there sometime down the line.  Perhaps they should have a food truck going around, too?  This is perfect food to sober up with!  Or down with a Corona!

How do you say ""ole"" in Venezuelan?

4024640,2012-12-07,7,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Short review!  (will include an update in a month)

Viva Las Arepas!!!  Oh Viva Las Arepas!

Located on an unseemly street corner (Believe it was LVB/just pass Charleston - be sure to be on the look out!)  sits a tiny little 10x12 shack of goodness!

This past Vegas trip was all about exploring the local food scene outside of the main strip, and boy did we experience some delicious treats such as these Arepas!

Since it was simply a tasting... our part of 4 decided to share on one arepa... Reina Pepidas!  Yes... 4 sharing one......

Reina Pepidas is this arepa (corn meal bun toasted with savory fillings) that is filled with shredded chicken mixed with cilantro, avocado, green peas, and mayo..... just think of it as a chicken salad sandwich on steroids!

Super delicious!!!!!  The flavor of the cilantro and avocado coupled with slightly crispy buns of the corn meal made this a super filling yet delicious treat before actual lunch!  

Sauces comes with it too... I believe one of them is a delicious non-spicy cilantro sauce while another one is a spicy salsa that could potential knock your socks off!  Mixing all the flavors together will create a different yet awesome flavor that you surely don't want to miss.

Our party was looking at the pork butt arepa but since we were heading over for actual lunch, we decided to give it a try next time...

Is there a next time?  Hell ya!  They've done pretty well to a point that we noticed that an actual storefront is in the works just closely down the street... I bet it's going to be crowded when that completed...

But in the mean time, be sure to keep your eyes open for the little tiny shack that is on a street corner.... don't judge the book by it's covers.... you will be pretty amazed on what you find here at Viva Las Arepas!  Until next time Arepas!!!",sys6XtOZVLDzwn3qistBKw,9,7,4,B4VWHsdNfr-5Eq59wlyYFw

4039383,2011-07-19,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"My friend randomly said how he always passes by a place called ""I Love Arepas"" on his way to work.

After seeing Bobby Flay's Throwdown, I saw those two Venezuelan sisters and knew I needed to try those one day.

I took it as a sign and couldn't say no to going! 

Drive there and find it is TINY! I want to say it's about 10 by 10 feet with a handful of bar type chairs by the window and a couple tables by the street. It's definitely not a restaurant. More of a food truck slash stand.

If you haven't guessed, it's kind of ""ghetto"" being on LV BLVD across the Olympic Gardens Gentlemen's Club haha.

We were the only ones there. I took it as a bad sign because the chef looked like he was in a bad mood and his up selling techniques made him seem a little unappreciative of having customers by his tone of voice.

The menu is small, everything is under $5.00 being a sort of tamale you can only order to go. The Arepas are about $3-$4 depending on the meat or style and are definitely worth the price. They aren't HUGE so don't expect something with huge portions, but the flavor and specialness of the item is there. 

We ordered the #1 which was beef and added mozzarella for $0.50.

I asked for it to go and the chef suggested we eat it there and we'd enjoy it more.

It was DELICIOUS!

An arepa is a masa ""patty"" that gets grilled on both sides so they're crispy, and filled with different meats, veggies, sauces , ect.

The masa is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and the fillings are so good!

I described it as a cross between a tamale, a sopa, and a torta.

There are different hot or cold fillings.

They also have drinks, empanadas, and snacks.

After having it I ordered some to go for my friend and they loved it as well.

Overall love the place. Wish the Gentlemen working was nicer, but every one has those days. The food was great and that's all that matters.

Btw, they serve with two sauces, a creamy green and a spicy/sour red and are both SO GOOD. They also give you sauce to go.

Highly recommend!",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,2,0,5,RyFhevabkNxq4kvOr_0yNQ

Each arepa is about $5. Pair it with a side of beans or grilled veggies and a soda and you're about $10. Pretty affordable.

Our favorite was the corn and cheese plate (not sure if it actually is an arepa) and the chicken and avocado mix one. We ordered 6 dishes in total and devoured everything.

One thing I wish they offered was a spicier sauce (I think I was in the King Taco mode) but honestly, the creamy and salsa-y sauce they offered were amazing.

I'm a fan of Arepas. I'm just not a fan of the Arepas served at Viva Las Arepas.  I got their Beef Empanada and Beef Arepa.  Both were greasy and not worth the price. $5 for an Arepa the size of your fist??  I've had this place bookmarked. Now, bookmark checked! Time to move on.

Longer Review:
Viva Las Arepas has been one of my bookmarks since I was introduced to their neighbor, the great Art of Flavors. Yes, Viva is located right next door in case you didn't know.  Upon entering, you're hit with nothing but orange and a menu with a decent selection.  At first, the prices looked pretty good until you get your food. I got the Beef Arepas and a Beef Empanada.  They both tasted ""Just Ok"" and were super oily. For a minute, I thought I was eating a beef chimichanga. Both were also so small that I was able to finish my Arepas in about 3 bites.  I know I can't mention names, but I have had better Arepas out here in Vegas. Better in regards to price, value, and most importantly, taste. All is not lost though.  Their plantains and the service were both excellent.  I may be back, but most likely for their plantains only.

4057653,2011-08-25,1,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"So me, J.V and Daniel met up at I Love Arepas after having a convo at work about Colombian food ( Daniel's family is Colombian).  I told them about I Love Arepas and we had decided to finally check it out, once we arrived, we realized its Venezuelan and not Colombian but Daniel said arepas is a Colombian dish also? Hmm okay...

Well, it was a very HOT day and since this place is just a stand with a few tables set up, we decided to sit at one of the tables and eat instead of in our cars.  We started with the fruit juices- sugar cane with lime for me, mango for Daniel and Tamarindo for JV.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our drinks, you can tell everything was freshly made. I thought my sugar cane/lime drink would be too sweet but it wasn't, it was PERFECT on this extremely hot day.

Food, we ordered almost everything on the menu..Arepas are like sandwiches with the patties made from cornmeal which is grilled then stuffed with meat, cheese and other delightful things...

Here's what we ordered:
Roasted Pork Butt (Hot filling)- yummy! shredded pork similar to carnitas, had great flavor
Shredded Chicken (Hot)- also very good, similar flavors to the pork butt
Beef Tongue (Hot filling)- oh my, SO good, one of my favorites! tender, slightly spicy
Honeycomb Tripe/Menudo (Hot)- another of my favorites in the hot filling category, this was the spiciest of all the arepas we tried. Again, full of flavor with the garlic and spices!

Cold fillings-
Reina Pepiada- they said this was their most popular but I was not a fan.  There was just too much mayo going on with this one, I couldn't even eat it all.  It's similar to a chicken salad with avocado and green peas but umm, yeah, too much mayo...
Garlic shrimp- this was BOMB, I mean seriously good. It was like having shrimp ceviche in a sandwich...this is a must have!

Empanadas- the guys loved the black bean and cheese, I got the shredded beef.  They loved it and said it tasted really fresh, mine was okay, seemed that my shredded beef had more filling than their black bean/cheese ones.

Hallacas- this alone would have me stopping by daily.  It's the most expensive item on their menu at $5 each but it's so worth it.  It's similar to a tamale with empanada filling wrapped in banana/plantain leaves and steamed.  For me, the cornmeal dough was SO yummy! It' reminded me of a Vietnamese dish very similar to it that's got ground pork and also steamed in banana leaf...this is a HELL yeah dish for me!

After we were done trying all the dishes, we were thirsty again so I ordered the Guava drink next and JV ordered the Guanabana (soursop).  Both drinks again were fresh and you could taste it!

This is a definite return for us, but next time, after the sun goes down or when the weather was cooler!",LltbT_fUMqZ-ZJP-vJ84IQ,3,0,4,j7qkYhhi6LWMvDt98i36Wg

Fall off the bone ribs, grilled steak, grilled chicken and sausage. That was pricey 23.99 but we all were able to indulge in the meat fest to our hearts content!   For the side I ordered salad and plantains. I have never really tried real authentic plantains and these were pretty good. A lil too sweet for the rest of the meal. We are about half of them. The salad it was a big plate of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes with a dressing. We didn't really care for that. We also ordered their carne asada arepa. Soooo good we couldn't get enough.

4072573,2011-06-21,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Ok ok... this little shack has been seeing alot of action on yelp recently so i had to see what all the local yippers were talking about. The location is kind of en, i personally would have like to sit there and grub and people watch a little but there seemed to be more of the owners family and friends just sitting around on a Sunday afternoon taking up space then actual customers enjoying the food and relaxing in a chair. After we got the cook to actually get back into the shack and stop chit chatting with the family outside i was thinking maybe i might finally get to eat. $3.50-$4.50 was the average cost of an Arepa across the board but keep in mind when your asked if you want cheese that its an additional .50cents to your total. Ordering a chicken, beef arepa and a bean and cheese empanada. Got my food and it all fit into a medium sized styrofoam container, this was where i asked is this all of it? yup. Now ill say the stuff smelled good driving in my car trying to find a place to sit and eat. It tasted even better when i Nom Nommed on it in the 5 bites it took me to eat the entire thing. But it left me wanting something more to eat because it did not fill me up at all. 

To those looking for a tasty bite/snack to hold you off before a dinner or a late night munchie after a little night life in Vegas sure this is the spot. But if your looking to be stuffed after having one $4 arepa id say only if you were a tiny 90ln chick. You need at least two of these to be a complete meal so keep that in mind when ordering.

4073801,2015-11-03,4,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Man, I've been waiting for awhile to try this place out. It is always nice to find cheap food relatively close to the strip!

So first off, this place is North of the strip, in between Encore and the Stratosphere. The parking situation is a little lot or if that is filled, they have an empty lot in the back (super dingy at night). As for the decor, it is simple, nice, clean and spacious. The workers are friendly and they showed me the board with the arepas and the chef's recommendations. Each arepas is about the size of a small burger and they all cost about $7. We ended up getting:

Roasted Fire beef- Oh man, such a perfect blend. It's basically carne asada with a smoky flavor. Really good!

Chicken with avocado- A lot of people tend to order this so I gave it a try. The avocado, lime and cilantro blend very well together. It kind of makes it mushy to me. Overall, it was decent.

Roasted Fire chicken- The chicken was soft and tasty.

Passion Fruit juice- Yum! Sweet and tart! I love it!

Lastly, they take card and your food comes out pretty quick. Overall, my meal came out to $20 which is always nice in Vegas. I am a happy camper and I would love to come here again on my next trip.",acoVn9Vbp0fnuc3n-1M2EA,5,5,4,cgFa5xugMHmxq0DjeujMYA

I discovered this place back in 2014 when I was visiting for Life is Beautiful festival 2014. I have been going to this place every single time when visiting Vegas since then. Most times it's been multiple visits here during every Vegas trip! Location is right between the new strip and the old strip - nearby the Stratosphere from what I can remember.

Other than the arepas, I've tried their empanadas, pastelitos, french fries, and their yucca root. All of them have been really good but nothing will top their arepas! I've had arepas at Bay Area music festivals but never like the ones they make here. Before this place, I've only had plain arepas. Never did I know that these babies can be served in a sandwich pocket-like form.

I'm a pescatarian so I could only speak for the non red meat items. Their chachapa (corn and cheese arepas) are on a sweeter side - definitely pretty tasty but it's pretty greasy to what I'm used to ordering here. When I'm here I usually order two arepas - both flavors differ each other. They are more than happy to custom your order.

The two sauces they offer with these arepas are also pretty good! I remember one is of a creamy consistency and the other one is just green sauce. I love their green sauce! It's got a bit a kick of spice to it.

My meat eater friends seem to love it as well. Not too sure on what they get but all of it looks delicious. 

Service is great, the staff is very friendly and welcoming. The place itself is pretty spacious - tons of room to sit. The parking lot is a bit small.

I've been almost 4 months since I've last been here (the longest I've been without it :( ) and I'm suuuuuuuper missing this place. 

I wish their hours went beyond midnight. There were too many times after a night out in Vegas when I wish I had arepas. They do delivery as well! Haven't tried that yet though.",SnOcD4-NNg0kRzxHNpUd8Q,0,0,5,IKRT0zibFTZC-cF_sUva-Q

I'm glad I tried this place. I went for the pork butt arepa ($4.50) and shredded beef arepa ($5.00), making the cheese upgrade ($0.50) for both. Fried corn filled with a decent quantity of meat is already a recipe for success, and you can add the cilantro sauce (in the yellow or one of the clear bottles) or the spicier red sauce that I sampled a bit of. I think the shredded beef actually had more flavor than the pork butt, but that means the pork butt is a better vehicle for the sauces.

I also tried my friend's fried plantain, which was about as mushy and brown as you'd expect if you just fried a plantain (or banana) on your own at home. It's not very sweet at all, so it's rightfully listed as a side and not a dessert.

The prices could be better given the relatively small portion sizes - I wasn't too full afterward - and the arepas do lack just a bit of the extra flavor oomph that would take it to the next level. However, I could see myself coming back here for future ""one-two punch"" trips.

P.S. Art of Flavors was solid, as usual.

(UPDATE: Downgrade from 4-stars to 3-stars. After having tried Rika Arepa Express, the other big game in town, I realized how lacking in flavor these arepas are. Oh, and Street Dogs also does arepas better.)",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,3,3,vASV_WoUyxoqvvvvowyJgQ

If this is Venezuelan food then sign me up! I'm very glad I didn't immigrate to Venezuela as I would probably would have ended up being a 400lb whale on the beach snacking on Arepas all day.

Once again the Yelp community didn't steer me wrong. For weeks I've been seeing yelpers rave about this place, so I decided it was time.

Located on Las Vegas Blvd and East Oakey Blvd, Viva Las Arepas is a store down from the other favorite Art Of flavors. The parking is very limited, so be prepared to maybe park somewhere close by. Trust me the walk is worth it.

After going around their menu I decided why not the Pork and chicken Arepas. Served on a rectangular  dish, they were served pretty much hamburger style. With a hot sauce and what seemed like a tart sauce are served with your meal. Both dishes bursts with flavor. The breading I think was freshly made. Big credit. Very filling meal if your trying one or two. 

To drink they have canned soft drink and bottled water. The real stuff is the juices they have on tap. I can not remember what juice I had but it was a suger cane drink of some sort. It complemented the meal quite well. Tell your friends, this place is bomb

My order -1 lengua Arepas and 1 shredded beef Arepas. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the Arepas. The outside pocket tasted similar to masa around a tamale. The inside filling of beef reminded me of a stew flavor and the tongue filing was minced up and not gamy but flavorful.

I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.   

An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.

SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out. 

#5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!

#7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full. 

The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.  

This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food

So the other day I was watching Triple D and Guy Fieri was at a restaurant named VALENCIA LUNCHERIA and the chef made REINA PEPIADA.  I can't lie, it looked so delicious my mouth to started to water (stop laughing).  So I told myself that I will make a trip to VIVA LAS AREPAS.  I'm not quite sure about this, but I think they've been here in Las Vegas for at least 5yrs.  It's VEGAS, longevity does not come easy in this town.

OK, so enough of the introduction to this review, let's get to the REAL:

I order the REINA PEPIADA w/ a side order of handcut shortstrings.

I promise no disrespect to the Venezuelan culture, this reminds me of a TORTA. I didn't say it taste like a torta, its just reminiscent of a torta (its the san diegan in me)

FOOD:

AREPA
shredded chicken breast w/ avocado and cilantro, accompanied w/ a creamy cilantro dressing and salsa.  the AREPA itself is grilled to a light brown, giving a nice crust w/ crunch.

the chicken breast is mixed together w/ the avocado and cilantro. (creamy chicken salad style)

super light and dense, nice crunch when you bite into it.  the chicken is not under/over cooked nor seasoned.  perfect amount of spice, topping the AREPA w/ the salsa is the KICKER.  OMG, the salsa by itself delicious, it has the kind of heat that does not hit you right away, the heat kicks in at the back of the throat.  Mmm, Mmm, Mmm that shizzy is FIRE!  the creamy cilantro dressing I did not dress my AREPA w/ it for the avocado covered that for me.


FRENCH FRIES
i will pass on these, maybe because I got it to go my fries were soggy.....ok, no that's not going to work for me.  I'M JUST SAYING there is another well known establishment that offers handcut fries and they always make it to the house w/ crisp. 

Arepas are reasonably priced, the most ""expensive"" arepa on the menu is $6.00 (Shrimp and Garlic arepa).  The fries are nothing fantastic, there are alternatives to the fries: fried plantains of fried yucca root.  There are other things that I would like to try on this menu, so I will be making a couple of more visit to experience the other Venezuelan delights on this menu.

4239050,2011-06-04,3,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Word is starting to spread about I Love Arepas and boy oh boy does it live up to all the buzz it's receiving. At a little less than $4 a pop, you're going to end up walking away from this food stand with a mouth full of smiles and belly full of happy.

If you asked me what an arepa was a few hours ago, I'd reply back with a blank stare and a scratch of the head. Ask me this in the present, and you'll find me blindingly reciting the Wikipedia description word-for-word, while dual-wielding an arepa in each hand.

The arepa is basically a fried flat cornmeal based sandwich filled generously with a meat of choice. Here, at I Love Arepas,  they have all of the usual meats that you'd find at a taco shop (beef, carne asada, shredded chicken/beef, tripe, lengua, etc.), along with their own unique concoctions. 

Since it was my first visit I was recommended these two items:
*#1 Carne Mechada - Shredded beef, bell pepper, onions, tomato, garlic
*#7 Reina Pepiada - Shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise, 
cilantro, green peas

I'd say that the #7 came out the winner in this one, but the carne mechada was at a close second due to how meaty it was (shredded beef lovers rejoice!). My mouth is flooding with drool now that I'm recalling what I ordered just a few minutes ago. I'm going to make it a mission to try every item on their menu. Before you know it, I'll be a stuffed, wobbling arepa machine by the time I'm through with it.

One downside about I Love Arepas is that it's located in Stabbytown, USA. The area isn't the greatest. If you've been to Luv It Frozen Custard (across the street), you'd know what I mean. If hobos don't scare you, give I Love Arepas a shot without hesitation. If the common-day bearded hobo does give you the willies, bring a friend along with you and share the love.",qe1GaPBOSOXqCVIuQRYvKA,4,3,5,CeGpJWvJ5pFh1ubahZZSJw
4240954,2011-09-30,27,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I have long avoided this place for two reasons: one, I despise the food truck trend. And two, my previous experience with arepas was limited to some mystery-meat-stuffed weirdness at a bus depot in the Venezuelan hinterlands.

But yesterday, as I was driving past the street corner where the Arepa boys do business...out of the corner of my eye I noticed that the proprietors were two hot Venezuelan dudes of childbearing age. Hell-O! I did a quick U-turn and pulled into the parking lot. 

As mentioned, my previous experience with arepas left me skeptical...but the hotness of the staff, and the fact that it's not actually a food truck, but more of a dingy kiosk unadorned with Twitter and Facebook logos, convinced me to give 'em a second try. And now.......... I, too, Love Arepas!

I only had one -- the bean and cheese. But it was fantastic!! WAY better than the ones I had in Venezuela (they hate Americans down there, so they probably pissed in my arepa at that bus depot). At $3.50 it was a filling mini-meal...and actually stuck to my ribs through three cocktails, preventing me from getting wasted and doing embarrassing things down on Fremont St.

IMO this is hands down the best dining in all of Vegas -- cheap, unpretentious, delicious and al fresco. You can sit at the little tables in front of the arepa pod and enjoy the scenery of the neighborhood: a strip club, a dive bar and an all-night drugstore patronized by pimps and weirdos. 

I will MOST DEFINITELY be coming here again and again and again -- and that's just with the hot proprietors. I'll come to the kiosk again, too :-)",0o8HUzggoNKay9-ZMj3HqQ,23,15,5,QgK_YF-vL1rRRgrkvZpvvQ

For my money, the carne asada arepa, with egg and cheese added, is the money order. I also had their fried plantains for the first time, which were definitely interesting. I enjoyed them, but could see how they might not be everyone's cup of tea. 

There was about a 10 minute wait, but I didn't mind it all that much. It meant that everything was cooked fresh. 

The arepas look small but they are deceivingly filling. They cost between $5.50 and $7 each, which is pretty decent for what you get.

Both my friend and I ordered an arepa de reina pepiada, a sort of chicken salad filling, with avocado mayo dressing and a meat empenada, since two arepas would've have been too much food. I also ordered a mango water, which was very refreshing and not too sweet. Both the arepa and the empanada were very tasty.

The foos in itself is merits a four star review, and although I am hsistant, I am giving them three stars becaus eboth my friend and I felt ill afterwards. I know a lot goes into getting sick from food, veryone's digestive system if different. With that said, I can eat anywhere and I've never gotten sick.

My friend seems to think it was the salsa they gave us on the side, she says it seemed a bit off, more vinegar-y than it should be. 

Regardless, as I said the food was really good so I am definitely planning on coming back and letting the management know about the sauce. I am sure it was just a fluke.",Se3XL5Opy0e2cHbxxjs2ZQ,3,2,3,384Ng0gtVPCZOscAx4dRng

I had the pork butt arepa this time along with the cachapa. Both were quite amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the exterior of the arepa in general, but the pork butt was marinated to perfection and with the green sauce it went well together. 

The cachapa I got was a bit undercooked, but, I donated it to my coworkers and they were quite blown away, given that it was their first time they had tasted anything like it.

Came here on a Sunday around 5 and it wasn't crowded. I decided to order an arepa with carne asada, tomatoes and lettuce (#1) and one with the shredded chicken and avocado (#7). I was not disappointed at all by my choices. The wood fire beef was cooked well and the meat was very flavorful. The chicken was also flavorful, moist, and creamy inside. I really liked that it was like a torta but the ""bun"" was made of corn. I was scared that buying only 2 of them wasn't going to be enough, but it fills you up fast. We also shared the chicharron with yucca fries and the fried plantains. The chicharron was fried well and fresh while the plantains were sweet but not overly oily. According to Yelp, everyone really likes the sauces here. They give you 2 bottles, one which is a creamy spicy sauce while the other one is a verde green sauce. The creamy sauce was great with all of them while the verde salsa was fairly typical of most Latino restaurants. Overall I thought the food was super good here. I would definitely come back here in a heart beat when going through Vegas. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the prices. I thought $5-$7 was a tad steep for what you're actually getting. Don't get me wrong, it was really good, but to get pretty full, you'll probably end up spending $10-$12, which isn't bad at all, just not as cheap as I thought it would be.",zQI6TO7JjCmNVNcYQNMXOw,1,0,4,3Uta0v0fY6BCPGf6G_SdLw

I guess it also helps that when I go, I'm normally hopped up on vodka and Danny G's karaoke from Dino's (shares a parking lot with Dino's). When I'm in that state, I have no discrimination filter and I love all food. 

These tasty little pockets are yummy, but a little on the pricey side for the portion sizes. Though I've heard, but have no confirmation, that the corn meal is imported straight from Venezuela. Who knows. It sounds nice, though. So take your time and savor the taste and texture of the cornmeal pocket. So yummy.

Arepa was extra doughy on the inside and not in a good way. Cooking a proper arepa takes a very long time, 15-20 minutes. I prefer my arepas to be fully cooked, through and through.

We checked this little food stand out after our friend raved about it and mentioned that it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.  

I ordered the Chicken (Pollo Mechado) Arepas and the Beef Empanada.  I ate the empanada in the car and it was definitely fresh and hot (so hot I burned the roof of my mouth on it) ;(   We waited until getting back to the hotel to have the Arepas.  Tip: make sure you have wet wipes and a lot of extra napkins....there is no pretty way to eat this bad boy!  While it was definitely flavourful, and filled with meat (you definitely get your money's worth), I found it way too filling. Also, by the time we got back to the hotel, the arepa had sadly gone soggy.  But the accompanying sauces were great toppers.  

Value wise - it's a great value. $4 for a whole lotta meat!  And only $2 for the empanada.  

That said, I almost feel bad about giving Viva Las Arepas a 3.5 rating, after seeing all the great reviews here.  I will definitely give Viva Las Arepas a chance again upon my next Vegas visit, and this time, I will make sure to enjoy my arepas right away.",TgG3J58v5bEhMB8YCQ1TbQ,0,0,3,ens8wUZRSF8qdJ7iBRK0yw

I ordered the garlic shrimp and the shredded beef with cheese. I wouldn't get the garlic shrimp again because it didn't have enough flavor for me, even though it was still a great choice, I also needed to add alot of their green sauce and I felt like it wasn't worth it if I had to douse it in sauce. The shredded beef on the other hand... whole 'nother experience. The rich and succulent flavor of the beef paired with the perfect amount of cheese, a dab of their green sauce, and their hearty corn flour exterior... man oh man you are missing out if you haven't had this. The juice/oil from the meat was leaking from the arepa but I really wasn't mad because I just kept licking my hands (#shameless). Since it is made from corn flour it tends to be heavier and therefore I got filled faster so just a heads up that it might be excessive if you want two, unless you can handle that life then all power to you!

I will start with the two sauces offered.  One is a tomatillo based, spicy salsa.  The other is a crema/avocado based sauce.  Both are freaking like crack and would go delicious on a shoe.

On to the main show.  I have had a chance to fully consume or try bites of the following (and remember, I am a fat ass at heart and am not ashamed): 

1. Shredded Beef
2. Shredded Chicken
3. Beef Tongue
5. Roasted Pork Butt

8. Garlic Shrimp

In all honesty, if you are staying anywhere near the Las Vegas strip, order a cab and pay the $10 to get here and eat the delicious ass food.

Located in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite.
The restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent.
We ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries.
In seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night.

ordered the same shredded beef arepas and this time a Polar (Venezuelan) soda.

Great looking location and still wondering why it is not packed in here. This is truly Las Vegas' hidden gem. 

Venezuelan food is one of my favorite cuisines and something that is lacking in Los Angeles -- or I just don't know where to get great arepas other than at Coupa Cafe in Beverly Hills. I've had Columbian arepas nearby my place, and it just didn't hit the spot.

My aunt ordered the Venezuelan empanadas this time, but were lacking flavor and bland.  Everything else about the empanada was great and wished the filling had more flavor. This empanada was unlike the many varieties I've tasted -- Filipino, Argentine, Bolvian (all each very unique). 

My aunt tried the new wood fired beef arepa and she said that was also very bland -- hopefully they'll kick up the flavors in the empanadas and wood fired beef arepa. 

Until then, this five-star review is for...

... the shredded beef arepas!

This is just how I remember having it in Venezuela, along with the ham and cheese arepas I would have at the airports in Venezuela for breakfast.

I LOVE carne asada....I try it everywhere I go and I make it myself! So naturally what do I order???  A carne asada arepa! Now I wasn't too familiar with what arepa exactly is going into the restaurant, I had seen the pictures, meat stuffed in a bun looking thing! Well I was half right it's meat stuffed into a circle of masa. Think the filling of a tamale! I do not like masa! I only eat the meat from a tamal and pretty much did the same here....it's not their fault I dislike masa so that's not why they only got 3 stars. The carne asada had a funny flavor to it. I can't put my finger on it but it was, well funny. I was given 3 sauces and was never explained what the heck they were. The creamy white-ish one was delish so I covered my funny tasting meat with it and went on my way.

The cheese was my absolute favorite. Then we got the mixed Grill which had chicken beef sausage and pork ribs you get two sides with that. Let me tell you the sausage was the best I've ever had.

I ordered a cachapa (a corn pancake folded in half and filled with cheese) and added their Pulled pork butt with a side of yuca fries. All of this was just under $12 and provided enough food that I took half home (even after sharing the yuca with my hungry nine month old son). 

I've never had a cachapa before and have nothing to compare it to. Nor have I had Venezuelan pork. But both were everything I was hoping they'd be and more! The corn Pancake was super moist and the flavor of corn came right through. The layer of cheese was very thick, very melted and very gooey - perfect! And the Pulled pork? Shredded, tender and covered in a sweet sauce (it reminded me of a BBQ sauce). 

The yuca fries were thick and unevenly cut -crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They were mildly salted and definitely needed their cilantro sauce. But they were quite nice!

This Venezuelan establishment is a jewel above standard Latin and South American cuisine. 

Located a few blocks north from The Stratosphere at the end of The Strip, lies a little strip mall where a small fast food joint looks to make a big punch with their specialty: the arepa.

Handcrafted and stuffed with flavorful and steaming shredded carne asada, the arepa is a pocket full of inspiring and familiar tastes. Along with the arepas are two sauces to accompany your meal. A spicy salsa-like sauce and a creamy, yet tangy sauce. You have to have one of these sauces at every bite, or you'll be missing out on this beautiful combination. 

I ate this with a huge side of subtly tangy Basmati rice. A great combo if you ask me. 

The service friendly, quick, and accommodating, you'll feel like you're king of the world during that five minute meal with this Venezuelan staple.",MghRQ6h95OSD5so41-SPBA,0,1,5,EIIuVCtFkn6XIREUd0a8RA

As I mentioned I wanted to come here to 3 other people who frequent or lives near Las Vegas, they said, ""ooohh it's on THAT part of town."" 
We ordered 4-5 different items and a couple of desserts.  
Everyone liked the corn cachapa.  I was okay with it.  I did try it when it wasn't hot anymore.  And it's one of those food items you want while hot and the cheese is empty.   
I had the asada arepa.  It was good. I think the texture of the arepa is very thick and maybe fried.  So after half an arepa, I was pretty much done.   I didn't think one would fill me up, but it did. After finishing my meal,  It definitely felt ""heavy"" from the fried, oily part.  
Reina arepa was good too.  Tasty sauce. 
Guava and cheese pastry and the coconut one was not good.  The pastry was not flakey like I'm used to.  I generally love Cuban's guava and cheese pastries and thought this would be a bit similar.  

Location: apparently the scary side of town. 

Service: okay, nothing special.  None of us had ever had arepas but we felt rushed from the man taking our order as if he expected us to know exactly what we want.   We sat outside and they brought out our food to us.

Located at the very end of Las Vegas Blvd. Parking lot is super small and tight.

Asada Arepa - $5.50 - Meat is cooked so soft and tender and really well seasoned. I could taste the grill in the meat. The lettuce and tomato keep the flavor from getting boring. 

Pollo Arepa - $5 - Again meat was cooked perfectly and the grill flavor really comes through. The chicken was not dry at all. If this came with lettuce and tomato, it would have been perfect.

Carne Empanada - $3 - Meat was really good but it was more dough and no stuffing.

Green and white sauce are so good. I wish they gave more for to go orders then two small ass cups. 

It really should be a 3-3.5 overall but the meat was cooked so well. I am just not a fan of the arepa bun. Arepa, torta, papusa, I still rather have my meat in a taco or burrito.",d8KR5c1ievS0C53h4fhEeQ,2,0,4,ghp2CDqC9Drn-hGgSsDqnQ

I had never heard of this culinary item until I found out about this place. Some compare arepas (Venezuelan) to pupusas (Salvadoran). It's a fair comparison, but they're not quite the same. I say the only real way to find out is to try them for yourself. You won't regret it.

I've been here twice now. First, I tried the tripe, which was killer. The next time, I tried the tongue, which was similarly murderous. Now, if you don't like tripe or tongue, this place isn't going to change your mind. Don't worry, they also serve your basic fillings, like beef and chicken.

Currently, the only problem I have with this place is the slow service. Basically, it's like the chef has to do all the work because the hired help is incredibly incompetent. Fortunately, the last time I was there, I talked to the chef and he said he hired a new employee and she was starting the next day. Honestly, it hasn't been a huge inconvenience so far, but if there ever was a long line here, watch out. I'm hoping the new employee works out.

4692730,2014-08-20,8,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"*Yelp 100 challenge complete!

As much as Vegas is founded on facades and paradoxes, I found it pleasantly appropriate that perhaps the best food I had in Vegas came from this hole-in-the-wall place in the corner of a sketchy looking strip mall far from the Strip as opposed even to the meal I had a L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!

One of the benefits of Vegas is that can you drive a few miles and start your morning with some Hawaiian Poke, have some French for lunch, and finish with Venezuelan food. I'm glad we came here, saving this local gem for last.

The Arepas here were fantastic all served piping hot. To rank them in order:

1) Reina Peplada: Chicken Breast, Mayo, Avocado, Cilantro
2) Wood Fire Beef - think carne asada
3) Garlic Shrimp - big pieces of shrimp just not the best shrimp in quality

The corn meal bun is crisp and houses some incredibly tasty meat. They give you sauces but thats not necessary with all that is going on in the arepas. 

Also the Yucca Root fries were good fat fries but I will go with their normal french fries next time.

And I know it is just rotisserie chicken but something about that actual hickory wood fire grill really brought out the flavor in the Wood Fire Chicken plate ($14.99). It was perfectly moist and tender and the skin was the right amount of char and crisp.

I thought the Passion Fruit juice edged the Mango juice and it is refreshing and the right complement to the arepas.

My advice to Vegas-goers is to take a slight detour to Viva Las Arepas for some very delicious comfort food. Then make it extra special by going right next door to Art of Flavors (one of the best gelatos I've had in the city). 

Viva Las Arepas!

4701302,2014-03-17,3,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"It's a shame, but after each visit, I've become less and less impressed. My first visit was phenomenal and my second visit was still pretty great (as evidenced in my previous review). The Wood-Fired Beef was a bit dry during my third visit, but I brushed it aside attributing it to a fluke or bad timing. However, my last visit has solidified my disappointment and necessity to write an updated review.

Since I've had five of their arepa options, I decided it was time for another one, so I chose the Vegetarian (avocado, black beans, tomato, peppers, onion) for $5. I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the ""Vegetarian"" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables? Not cool!

Also, after four visits, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that my table is consistently ignored. No one ever checks on us (it's usually me and Ruben), while they seem more than happy to visit and chat with several other customers. It has made us feel unwelcome. I'm really sad to say this, but I will be getting my arepas elsewhere from now on.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,8,6,2,sSH-QrXXWS5gkni4HovSZQ

4739259,2014-06-30,4,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I could of sworn I wrote a review for Viva Las Arepas a few years back, my apologies. I began coming and enjoying these delish arepas when this establishment was the humble little shack across the parking lot now replaced by an up and coming gourmet sandwich joint. My first time here the owners kid was out behind the shack and some drunk women was walking up and the down the street cursing and confronting customers so I called the cops and my mom went to go talk to the little girl and her mom so she wouldn't be scare. The chef was busy so as a thank you he gave us a few free orders of the cheese sticks. After that I became a regular. 

The pork arepa is filled with really tender pulled pork but I always order without the tomato slice. The shrimp arepa is really yummy too, sautéed shrimp in a mild spicy condiment sauce served hot. The bean an cheese arepa, can nothing go wrong with those!!! Finally but not least, the Reina Pepiada is my absolute favorite!!! It is made with shredded chicken, mayo, avocado, peas and cilantro. 

The arepas are served in rustic baskets which I hate because when people spill their arepa juice, how do they clean them? I eat mine over the paper they come in. The new locating is sooo nice and big too. Their menu is extensive, it contains other Venezuelan goodies like cachepas which are these sweet little pancakes.

I finally went here for lunch and wasn't disappointed.  I shared 3 arepas with a friend- carne asada, chicken asada, and the cold chicken salad.  There are menus in English and Spanish, and in English the asadas are called wood fire.  I ordered these three because they were identified on the menu with a small icon, which meant they were chef recommended.

There was a short wait because this is not fast food where meals are prepared ahead of time and placed under a heat lamp.  They appear to be made to order and you can taste the difference.  The cost of the arepas were $5.00 to $5.50 and cheese ($.50) and avocado ($.99) are extra.  I liked the beef the best. 

What struck me was the size of the arepas.  They were larger than I thought and one was enough to satisfy me for lunch.  I had 1.5 arepas and was stuffed.  The breading used is gluten free and is not chewy.  I would describe it more similar to the crunchy outside of a buttermilk biscuit.  

The cons were a very small parking lot and it isn't in a very safe area (right across from the Olympic Garden).  But overall I recommend this place and I'll be back to try the empenadas, which I was told were home made.",YdI4B5GNwxhAjWDeIROz3g,0,0,4,3DJibdMYeyNsy4A4gxTNzg

We ordered the Shredded Beef Arepa, which was $6. I asked for him to tell me how big they were and based on his description and pricing, I'd figure that one would be enough.  We ordered two, one for each and platanos.  We sat down and that's when I noticed that there was only two people there. Found it quite odd, especially on a weekend.  Then the table we chose to sit at was wet and sticky, very nasty!  I had to get some napkins to dry it all off!! The window was nasty full of finger prints.  Then I noticed a bed of dead flies on the window sill.  This really really grossed me out.
Then they called my name, my order was done!  I got my food on some baskets which were on a tray. Two squeeze bottles of hot sauce, one green and one red.  The arepas were the size of my palm. Very small!!  They were wrapped up in paper which i had to peel off and very sloppy.  The meat was very well seasoned  and the Arepa was very thin.  I was very very very disappointed!!! I just could not believe how small and over priced they were. This place was filthy filthy filthy!!!  Now I know why this place was completely empty!!  What a shame!!!

This was my first and last time I'll ever go to this place!!

If you want to have a really good Arepa - go to -

Parking was easy since they have a parking lot, even though it's on Las Vegas Blvd. It's a counter order establishment and the person who took our order was super nice and awesome. (If he had told me he owns that place, I wouldn't be surprised.) He greeted us when we walked in and after finding out it was our first time there, he made bunch of suggestions for us to try.

We got #1(wood fire steak), 7(chicken salad thing), 4(pork butt), 12(shredded beef, beans and plantain), and black bean & cheese empanada as he suggested. He did a great job on the suggestions because he made sure our food didn't have repeating ingredients. They were all great and tasty individually, but sadly, when we had all 4 in one setting, the chicken came in short on flavors. My favorite was the pork butt and slave girls' was shreed beef. Everything was well seasoned especially consumed with their house made spicy sauce.

They also serve entries other than arepas and based on the arepas we got, I can only imagine how amazing they will taste. Until next time, I will be drooling while dreaming.",YApG_XpSXamn_itlOXQCBw,2,0,5,oDXXMYhGG42g12lGIpZxSw

Their authentic Venenzuelan food is well prepared and incredibly savory...and their salsas...OMG be sure to get the creamy green salsa, but I mix them both. I have turned on countless friends to this gem and all are grateful for the tip. I have been coming here for years, every time  I am in Vegas. I watched them start at a food cart, as we stumbled upon them on drunk night.lol. From then forward I am required to bring home at least 2 dozen empanadas for family to enjoy. Was overjoyed the day I came to Vegas and saw they finally had their own building and were thriving because WOW IS THEIR FOOD DELICIOUS! Their prices are reasonable and their staff is not just friendly and helpful but they will accommodate you beyond expectations. 

Easy to access when traveling between the strip and Freemont St ""the old strip"" (its not far from Stratosphere). They have both indoor and outdoor seating available.

I had spoken with the owner earlier in the week and he told me that the arepa dough is made with milk, but that he would be happy to make me a special vegan one if I was willing to wait for it.  Well, Saturday night, drunk and hungry, I was more than willing to wait.  And I am so glad that I did! He made me a gorgeous arepa filled with black beans, and topped with freshly sliced avocado and tomato.  I have not stopped thinking about this food since I finished eating it, and I will definitely be going back soon.

The arepa dough was crispy from the grill on the outside (and btw, they cleaned the grill and made mine off to the side of all the other ones!) and almost fluffy on the inside.  The fillings were so fresh and tasty too! Every bite put a smile on my face.  

As a regular at Dino's, I am so thrilled to have a late night, vegan friendly food option to help me soak up the booze! And I really appreciate how super friendly and accommodating the folks who run the place were.  

My carnivorous friends went crazy over their non-vegan pork arepas too... and in fact everyone I saw get food there seemed pleased.  If you've never tried arepas you have been missing out!",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,19,11,5,dIlt8WjW3kwbja7ZuJO_3A
4848153,2013-03-19,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I heard a lot about this place but didn't get to try it until recently. They used to serve food from a little small stand on the side of the road but they have now moved into a brick and mortar restaurant on the corner of Wyoming and Las Vegas Blvd.

The restaurant itself is nice and clean, but the location is easy to miss if you go there for the first time. By the time you see the restaurant, you probably will need to make a roundabout just to be able to get into the parking lot.

Anyway, I've only tried three things at this place: rib eye steak, pork butt arepas, and asada arepas. I know that it's strange that I go to an arapas place and ordered steak, but they had a special rib eye steak for $10.99 and I was craving for it (LOL). Even though the meat wasn't high quality, the fire grilling and seasoning brought out great flavor from the meat and their side dishes were delicious. 

For the pork butt arepas, the meat was too salty for my taste. Also the corn shells/buns were too oily. The asada meat was alright also. 

So what's my verdict? If you haven't tried arepas and want something different, I think you should come by and give it a try. For me, it wasn't bad but at the same time it wasn't that good for me to come back on a regular basis. I will probably stop by the next time I'm in the mood for steak during lunch or want to try something different.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,3,0,3,G3N15uDjCL96U3Nnp7aQGw

4870257,2014-06-30,1,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I haven't reviewed Viva Las Arepas yet?! Best fix that. 

Viva Las Arepas is worth a trip whether you're familiar with the Venezuelan wonder food or have never tried these meat-filled Joy Pockets. It's representative of the best the genre has to offer; the arepa itself is fluffy and moist, and the meat inside is fresh, flavorful, and sooooo juicy. The meat is all cooked over a wood fire, and the flavor they get out of the meat is just incredible. The woodfired beef, and the reina pepiada (chicken with peas and avocado and...um...stuff?)  have become my go-to favorites, and I've developed cravings for the reina. So good. 

I'm pretty sure this place was the former occupant of the current Goodwich Cube outside of Dinos, but it has moved waaaaay up in the world, and now has a clean, classy restaurant with a great patio and a ton of seating just across the street, in a lot with a kitsch shop, a lingerie store, and a Bail Bondsman. Ahhhhhh Vegas.

Pros:
- Holy cow the food is delicious. Get two; an old favorite and then try something new. I've never had anything bad there.
- The arepas themselves are perfect. I've had arepas at other places that get this weird ""cheap poorly made cornbread"" texture to them that is not at all pleasant. That is not the case here. Something like a cross between a crumpet and a tortilla, I imagine the manna God sent from heaven was actually arepas.
- Sauces. They come in two generous tubes; one's spicy, one's garlicky. Yellow bottle. Do yourself a favor and just slather that on.
- This is fast lunch food that's not at all fast food. Takes about 5-10 minutes from order to eating, depending on how busy they are. Unless you order the All The Meats plate, which takes a while, and feeds 3. 
- VERY affordable. You can eat a lunch that will make you full for dinner for about $12. 
- Seating for 2-14 comfortably.

Cons:
- The other businesses in the strip mall give me the giggles.
- You will want to eat ALL THE AREPAS, all the time, which will make you very fat.",2krGQJ6P0hm_s6NxA09IMw,1,1,5,P7HHrF156fbYCvFKnVs36w

Asides from a few drunks and homeless folks wandering around, It's pretty tame for Las Vegas. The dining area is pretty clean, and they just recently added an outdoor seating area in the front.

I go here at least a couple of times a month because:

- it's cheap
- I don't have to think about what I'm gonna get, since I always get the same things
- it's right next door to AOF

The arepas range in price from $4 for a cheese arepa to $7 for a garlic shrimp arepa. I usually stick to eating the Reina Pepiada, (chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro), or the Perico, (scrambled egg, ham & cheese, onion and tomato). If I'm not mistaken, the Reina Pepiada is the only arepa served cold. Kind of reminds me of a cold chicken salad sandwich, but with a lot more chicken. 

Nice to have places like this to dine at, especially if you are budget-conscious. Beats the hell out of going to a fast food chain. For $20, you and a date can grab an arepa here with a huge order of fries, then bounce over to AOF to grab dessert. After dessert, have some fun and browse the selection of lingerie and adult novelties in the boutique next door!

First time trying Venezuelan rice and beans. The beans tasted almost like Cuban black beans. They were very well seasoned. The rice was so different from other Latin rice dishes. It was made with basmati (I think) I'm used to regular long grain rice but it was still yummy. 

For drink, soursop (or guanabana) and passion fruit. I really liked how both had great, authentic fruit flavor but they were on the less sweet side.

At first, I underestimated the size of the arepas here; though they're not huge, they pack huge content and are pretty heavy. Our arepas averaged about $5-6/each. We got a wood fired chicken, pork butt, wood fired beef, and an order of plantains. The wood fired beef was super tasty, while the pork and chicken were a bit salty.

I've never had arepas before, but I became a huge fan after trying these. The ""bun"" was made of a cornmeal that was grilled, and it was stuffed with a LOT of tasty meats/veggies. The Venezuelan hamburger was filling and also came with two sauces. The pork and chicken arepas got a little wet from the juices inside and started to fall apart towards the end, but were still good nonetheless.

They kind of reminded me of Salvadorean Pie de Queso mixed with Mexican Corn tamales with a lotta delicious salty & sweet cheese in the middle. It's both salty and sweet. My sister ate her Cachapa with Hot Chocolate and I ate mine with the green sauce (which I can't remember the name of).

Viva Las Arepas is a Venezuelan food restaurant. It's located on the corner of a mostly industrial area that's also surrounded by fast food joints. There must be something amazing about these folks because the back wall has some media mentions on display.  

Not knowing much about their cuisine, I saw that most Yelpers raved about the wood fire beef arepas. Just the name alone speaks mouth-watering meat. It seems to be a white corn shell grilled, and stuffed with chopped beef cooked over mesquite wood for that very noticeable smokiness. This is served with lettuce & tomato. It comes out blazing hot, I kid you not, so wait a minute before you burn your face. 

Reina Pepeiada is the corn shell stuffed with chicken, but drenched in a cooking cilantro sauce. 

Both were excellent but if I had the choose one, it'd be the wood fire beef.  Arepas come with 2 sauces. One is hotter than the other but both were great over the wood fire beef. 

Fried plantains were decent, but very heavy. They come out blazing hot and stay that way for a while. 

We also tried the 'drink of the day' strawberry juice.  Just the right amount of sweet and very refreshing. A refill for 2 bucks, and tried the passion fruit.  A bit tart so it's really not my fav.  

Service was pleasant. The lady at the counter knew it was obviously our first time so she was patient in explaining things. 

It's very casual here. Orders are placed at the counter and your name called when order is ready.  Photos of their menu items line the perimeter of the frame right below the ceiling and there are 4 TV's covering each corner of the dining area.  Stacks of mesquite wood can be seen towards the restroom. 

I'm also giving Viva Las Arepas a 4.5, but can't justify rounding up to a 5, since it's not exactly perfect in every way.  But without a doubt, I'll be back for more of that smoky wood fire beef.",n8YKNoz1xJHJDe-_jxfbcQ,18,18,4,iEZGe6uvk1Sr4hi1zsuUHg

I had the #7 Reina Pepiada (chicken breast mixed with avocado, mayo, and cliantro). I thought this one for the most part was alright and nothing spectacular, but it became a chore to eat after the 4th or 5th bite. I also had the #3 Shredded Beef which was mixed with bell peppers, onion and tomato. The #3 was my least favorite of the two. My first thought of this when I bit into it was that the meat tasted exactly like the meat you would get from Taco Bell. That is not a good sign. Now, I normally like Taco Bell as fast food if a real Mexican place isn't close to me. However, when you think of a Latino cuisine and you get Taco Bell as your first thought, there are issues.

I live 30 minutes away from this place, it's on the strip, and I have driven there three times in the past three weeks to sample more of their delicious Venezuelan morsels. 

The food is out of control. If you've never had an Arepa, it is a Venezuelan take on the taco. The key here is that the shell is a pillowy flatbread. That bread wraps around some of the most flavorful, tender and mind-blowing meats I have ever sampled. My two favorites are the #1 (wood-fired beef) and the #7 (Reina pepiada... A chicken salad). The beef is cooked perfectly and the spices are just right. And in case they are not flavorful enough, you can Doctor them up with their spicy green pepper sauce or a creamy avocado sauce. Honestly, the #1 is just right for me but occasionally I'll take a bit of the sauces because they are really good. 

I loved the ribs. They had a good crispy skin but they were falling off the bone. The empanadas are a great accompaniment to whatever arepa you choose. And don't skip dessert. They have pastelitos in two flavors. One is guava and cheese and the other is coconut. I'm not a huge guava fan but the coconut one was ridiculous. 

So far, I have been with my wife on a date, once with our three kids and once with a few friends. It was a great spot for all three outings. It's casual, and you don't have to worry if your group is a little rowdy.

When I came it was just a food hut on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming, but now I hear it's actually branched out and opened as a restaurant just a walk away from it. I guess it has turned into a hot dog stand now. 

Anyway, you can get both cold and hot arepas. They are decently priced, ranging from $2 - $5 so obviously you can't just have one! But before you go all crazy and order everything off the menu, let me tell you they can be quite filling! I would suggest two of them and an empanada constituting a full meal. I've tried the Roasted Pork Butt with tomato slices - FANTASTIC, beef tongue arepa - FANTASTIC times 2, and the Reina Pepiada which is chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise, and cilantro - not as good as the beef arepas, but still tasty.

We ordered a pork arepa, 2 bean and cheese empanada and mango to drink. 

The mango drink was really good. It was not too sweet, fresh and refreshing. I coulda had a few of those since it was a hot day. 

When our order came it was the wrong order. We got one meat arepa and a bean and cheese arepa so we figured maybe she didn't hear the empanada part and perhaps got us a arepa instead? Oh well, we'll eat it anyways. 

The bean and cheese was yummy with flavorful beans. The meat turned out to be beef (unless my taste buds are wonky) but it was so tender and fantastic. Normally shredded beef is somewhat stringy, but not this. I normally wouldn't order beef but here I would definitely consider it. The arepa was wonderfully crispy on the outside and had some chewiness inside that was addictive. I can eat those alone even. Don't skimp on the mustardy hot sauce and the creamy sauce as both make the arepas even better, I think! 

Eventually I guess they realized it wasn't that they got our order wrong, we got someone elses order! The guy on the grill (I'm assuming is the owner) was apologetic about it and gave us 2 bean and cheese empanadas anyways which was cool of him. It was not what I expected at all. I was thinking more like pastry dough type empanadas, but the consistency was like the breading that is around corn dogs which lead the BF and I trying to figure out how they make it. These were tasty but since I'm a Hot Dog On the Stick fan, I'm definitely ordering just a plain cheese one next time.

What the heck is an Arepa? Kind of a grilled corn shell, like a mash up of a sope and papusa, but hand sliced down the middle like a hamburger bun. After that just pick the 
filling(s) you want and enjoy. I particularly like the black bean and cheese and the tongue. Perico is the kitchen sink and really good too. Don't forget that crazy good green sauce, don't worry, it's not hot, but does burst with flavor. Arepas run $2.75-$4.00 Empanadas are $1.99 Venezy drinks are $1.49-dude hooked me up with free refills, don't know if that's the norm though. I tried 2 beverages Parchita which is a very sweet fruit punch thing, and the star by far was the Guanabana drink, which comes from the native southern hemisphere fruit of the same name. Very light, clean and refreshing taste. Bonus, they claim only fresh ingredients and no MSG, no microwave, and no can openers.",TwUqavuMpDWCw9iCva3KXA,17,15,4,42V4mkni2LpGd9pOSM0_Nw

I came with my friend that has never had arepas and he loved it. If you don't know what arepas are... then Google it because I already explained what they are on my Amara review lol.

Reina Pepiada - Chicken Breast mixed with Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro. This was a lot different from the one I had in LA. The chicken breast is chopped and minced so finely that its almost like a paste - I prefer chicken cubes or chunks for a bite. Really good though.

Pabellón - Beef, Black Beans, Plantains & Cheese. This is my go to. I love the sweet plantains paired with the salty cheese. The beef was super tender and juicy.

Wood Fired Beef Arepas ($5). Love the smokey flavor in the meat...it's delicious! I think their wood fired chicken and beef are my favorites here...chicken is a dollar cheaper.

Chicharron and Yuca Frita ($5.99). Delicious! Well done fried pork, with very flavorful fried yuca...imagine a very flavorful starchy french fry! Yummy 

And the Reina Pepiada ($5): Chicken Breast, Avocado, Mayo and Cilantro.  This is delicious and works so well together.  I love pouring their hot sauce all over this beast!

5156334,2011-07-17,1,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Having never heard of an arepa before, Katrina M. quickly introduced me to one on a drunken night. Prior to going into the adjacent Dino's, I was ordered a Reina Pepiada - a masa cake stuffed with a cold combination of chicken, mayo, avocado, and peas. Even in sober retrospect, that was a damn great meal. 

Another karaoke excursion brought a large group of us back to I Love Arepas. Ordering a myriad of arepas and empanadas, my favorites were the Roasted Pork Leg/Butt (moist, flavorful without unnecessary frills) and the Garlic Shrimp (showcasing the masa in its lightness). However, the sauces make the arepas infinitely better. There were two: a creamy green that was mild, and a more concentrated green that added spice in all the right ways. My only disappointment was in the codfish arepa - salty, fishy, and an added upset to the booze I just ingested. 

The best part about this place, other than the arepas? The price! I swear, for under five bucks per arepa, I am not conscious of my broke college finances. The price and the amazing food make I Love Arepas the content of my dreams for the past week, with the only way to cease them is to visit again.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,1,1,5,4A6u1spXfJnSzsFk0FfpNw

Some of the staff has moved to their second location, too. This includes Alex, who was always the cashier. She was always so sweet and smiling! And totally on top of things. I miss her! :( 

The last time I went in, the new (to me) younger guy at the counter gave away my takeout order last time. $35+ worth of food. 3 arepas and an order of yucca with chicharron. He didn't realize it until 15 minutes later and I had to wait around longer for my order. Not even an apology (because I don't have a life or to go back to work or anything, right?) and the food was meh. He was pushy and borderline rude, but in that weird, polite way. 

The wood fired beef was oily, the shredded beef was on point as usual, as was the pabellon with no cheese. However, the yucca fries with chicharron are usually a highlight for me but were a disappointment. They used to give you a medium sized, rectangular box full of big, juicy fried pieces of meat and yucca. Now, the box is half that size but the same price with the yucca and chicharron declining in size as well. For $6.99??? I felt ripped off when I cracked the box open only to find that it was my side and not my single arepa.. womp womp.

5159812,2015-12-10,1,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"After 3 visits, this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. It's not fancy, maybe it's not the place to celebrate a special occasion but the food is incredible. I visited last year as a non-meat eater and loved it. This trip, we are here for one night only and visited for both dinner and breakfast. There are no breakfast-y items on the menu...it's the same all day, but I knew I wouldn't be having it for a long time and doubled up. 

I couldn't wait to visit as a carnivore. I asked the cashier what I might order and he gave me 2 amazing samples of beef. The wood fired beef is juicy and flavorful. We had it in an arepa and the flavors were muted. I'd suggest going for the plate of it where it can shine on its own. 

Turns out my favorite 3 items are vegetarian. Surprise!  The corn and cheese arepa is a guilty please extraordinaire. It worked for dinner as well as breakfast and is equally fantastic alone or with a dab of the special mayo. 

The fried plantains are sweet and mushy, cooked perfectly. The caramelization gives a nice bit of chew to offset the wonderful mushy texture. Mushy may be bad with most veggies, but in this case it's very appealing. 

I don't remember the name of the cheesy bread stick that's off to the side of the menu. A little unassuming thing, it's like a doughnut with cheese and is 100 times better than my explanation. 

For breakfast today we ordered the three items above and subbed in the chicken salad arepa for the beef. This was way too much food for the two of us for breakfast. My luck friend swears by it and my husband remembered loving it last year so I figured I needed to try it. Was it really good?  Indeed, it was. Just not AS good as my favorite 3 things. In all fairness, those would be pretty hard to beat. 

Food is cooked to order and service has been good on every visit. There is plenty of seating and the restaurant has been very clean on each visit.

The decor is simple, lined with pictures that will impress you with the number of dishes you couldn't name. But in my opinion that's what makes it so exciting. Arepas is their signature food, ""arepas"" being a corn based flour that offers a huge variety of combinations of cheese and meats. Reina Pepiada is a mouthwatering blend of chicken and avocado and the corn based bread is such a great consistency and taste not overpowering and it's as soft as cornbread. They had freshly squeezed no sugar added juice as well as a desert of hot guava with cheese in a fried shell.

It was a short walk; but also in the blistering heat,so by the time we got there I was a bit of a cranky pants. Arepas couldn't be customized since the ingredients were already pre-mixed so I was ready to write-off getting one all together, but the man working the counter patiently led my onion-abhoring self to a couple options that did not include them. I went for the ground beef & cheese (not super exciting sounding) and my man the ham & cheese one. We also ordered beef & cheese and guava &cheese pepiadas, as well as a sugarcane and a passion fruit drink. 

The drinks were delicious and ~ice~ cold -- making the hot yet quick stroll back to the stratosphere bearable, and dare I say even enjoyable? Once we got inside we dug into our food -- everything was awesome!

Arepas are hot pockets of goodness, unless of course you go with the cold ingredients. They are a bit like a cornbread sandwich, as it is a corn dough. I have sampled the black bean and chicken, and I will say that I prefer the chicken. I have not perfected the right amount to order, as they make you really full quickly, but then shortly after you may find yourself snacky again, so my advice: overeat. I think that if you can you should do your best to eat at least 3. Or, just be content with a little snack and have one.

They are served up fresh and hot, and this is a food stand, so expect to sit outside and eat. The service is incredibly friendly and on top of customer service. Special orders do not upset them, and they actually gave my pal an extra empanada because one cracked!

I am a fan of their mango juice. It isn't too sweet and is the perfect refreshing treat to balance the heat of being on a corner in Las Vegas eating a hot pocket.

5263394,2014-10-11,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Let me just start this review with the fact that I am OBSESSED with arepas.

I first tried this glorious gift to mankind in Providence, Rhode Island, of all places. It was the little mom and pop where the owners obviously just moved from Venezuela. Anyway, fast forward 3 years and I've tried to find arepas wherever I go. I've tried Caracas Arepa bar in NY and was not impressed. Closer to home, I've had Coupa Cafe in Beverly Hills, which is okay and Cafe Bolivar in Santa Monica (which is really really good). 

Now, for Viva Las Arepas. I saw it as I was driving to North Vegas and immediately pulled a U-turn to grab me some arepas. I ordered the pork arepa with cheese and it was really really good! Their guasacaca (green sauce) was really good. 

On my last trip to Vegas I had to come back. They did a whole overhaul on this place. It looks much nicer than it used to. So I ordered the pork arepa again. This time, the sauce it came with was either the spicy sauce or some white ""cilantro"" sauce. It was not the same guasacaca I had become accustomed to. The spicy sauce was good, but I think that the white sauce was too creamy. Bring back your old sauce!!!!

Overall, it's still very good in terms of arepas. The meat is tender and well seasoned. The arepas are obviously freshly home made and they have a nice crust to them. I will have to come back on every pilgrimage to Vegas =)

Other things to note: There is a parking lot and outdoor seating. Prices are pretty good. One arepa will fill you up. I've also had the fried yucca and the plantains; both are good!",BoRDC7m0JP1pm1OapkDG7A,0,0,4,X9rLUYsGdjDgG_5MSTB9_w

We were slightly hesistant about the Reina Pepiadas first because of the mayo, but the mayo actually added an extra dimention of richness to each bite.  Each arepa was bursting with flavor.  I would recommend asking for your arepas to be grilled slightly longer to give the outer shell an extra crispy texture.  We arrived at 11AM and by the time we were done with our food at 11:30AM, there was already a decent line forming.  Good food is worth the wait...and the price is great!

It tasted like the kind of food I'd get at a mexican food truck on the side of the road - delicious but the flavor is because of the fat and oil. I felt pretty gross about myself after eating my arepas. This isn't the type of food for me and I think I will pass on this from now until t = - infinity.,f0TN5yZ7JBMKIzr3hSuwFQ,1,1,3,IASA6tLzf0NmCbqKoMjvuw
5278061,2016-06-09,5,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I had my first arepa at Viva Las Arepas and was mighty impressed. I arrived around 10PM on a Saturday night with my brother-in-law and set my eyes on the vegetarian arepa ($5), although what I actually got was more of a Frankenstein creation. The man at the register (who I'm assuming to be the manager/owner) was super helpful in assisting me with my order. 

CUSTOM AREPA ($6ish): My arepa had black beans, cheese, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, and plantains in it! I topped off each bite with a dash of the cilantro sauce or the spicy red sauce. The fried egg and plantains were the best part. The employee talked me getting into plantains, and I'm glad I decided to try it out in my arepa. It was delicious! I was skeptical that one arepa would fill me up, but by meal's end I was good to go. :) 5/5

For my second visit I got a black bean and cheese arepa, which definitely lacked the creative spark of my Frankenstein creation, but was still yummy nonetheless. My husband got the wood fire beef plate ($10.99) and was happy. The white rice on the side was AMAZING. Soft, buttery, and full of flavor. I'm getting this as my own side on the next visit. 

I wish Viva Las Arepas was closer to the locals, but I hear they're opening a second location so there's hope!

Set beside Art of Flavors, where another star-studded sampling had just concluded in the best 'ice cream sandwich' ever to cross my lips, it was with long-held interest and a touch of gluttony that I finally entered Viva Las Arepas; my ""some for now with the rest for later"" order rooted not only in convenience but also in hopes of avoiding a later trip from home for dinner.  Ever popular amongst locals and tourists alike with a menu focused on the Venezuelan flatbread sandwich alongside additional items both grilled and fried the time was just past two on my arrival to the deceptively large space and greeted by a short line with the dining room 2/3 full it would not be long before I found myself standing at the counter, a friendly middle-aged man expediting orders and assigning me number #36, my five boxed selections delivered to the table a mere fifteen minutes thereafter.   Clearly a restaurant vested in its core with a menu infrequent to change it was in a duo of 'sides' that my meal began and although bland plantains dripping with excess grease quickly proved inedible the unlikely star of the show would in fact be the wood-grilled pigskins, a crispy exterior overlying supple fat with intense brine offset by tender chunks of fried yucca.  Moving next to a pair of arepas it was with the wood grilled chicken that I started yet with flavors no better than the frozen stuff from Roots sold at Walmart I quickly moved to the pork-butt, the flavor almost indistinguishable from the bird as a trickle of oil ran down my hand into the napkin below.  At this point tossing what was left of each sandwich to instead sample the rinds and root with accompanying sauces it was finally with the $2 Pastelito that I finished and although tasty enough to stand on its own I couldn't help but think that for a buck per bite I'd have been better off staying next door with another scoop of gelato.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,4,2,vhtMlHM4Xtx9tLyotByI1w
5283562,2014-12-30,1,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"3.5, I rounded up. Pros: good street food, not great. The arepas themselves (essentially the buns for the Venezuelan sandwich) didn't have any seasoning. I get it, it's authentic. But we are in America, authentic don't mean anything any mo'. Like my excellent grammar, when cooking a particular ethnic Cusine take some liberties, like GW and his guerrilla tactics on the Potomac...improvise mo-fo. 

Order the #7. It was a chicken with cilantro and avocado. And #1 - chicken...and there is a beef one in there as well. The yuca was lame, not enough breading (if you are going to fry yuca, the fry the yuca).  The kids loved the chicken and cheese empanadas. I like the story of the chef. Really busted his ass to get a place going. That makes me like the place more. I want him to be a success. The lady at the POS was very nice, but if she was Venezuelan, I'm from Alpha Centauri. More like Mexizuelan. Worth the trip...yes (but it is halfway down the list of places to go in downtown LV).

5289234,2015-01-16,3,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"I've always driven by this place and wondered what it was. Location wise, it's actually quite bad. Why? Well, it it's right in the middle of going towards downtown or going towards the strip. If you have an agenda, you'll always pass by this place. I think it's taken me over 5 years to finally try here. So this time while in Vegas, as I always try a local joint when I'm in town, Viva Las Arepas it was! 

There is parking in the strip mall here. Depending what time you come here, it can be packed or not. We came at 7pm when it was packed and left at 8pm when it was not. The signage for the menu can be daunting at first. But when you look closer, it's really the same thing in English and the same thing in Spanish. They're not quite mirror perfect, but trust me it's the same. 

I was a little hungry the day I was here, with some 4 other friends. We ordered almost $90 worth of food and drinks. No, I'm not kidding.  We got to try a lot of different things from here. So here it goes:

Wood Fire Beef-cut in thick 1/2 inch strips. Flavorful, not tender,slightly on the salty side,  great with the mojo sauce. They do give you quite a bit. Think of beef jerky but just a tad softer.  The side of beans and white rice were ok, nothing to be excited about and the portions were really small. 

Fried Plantains-I have to say, this was the BEST fried plantains I have tasted anywhere. I've been to a lot of places and this place does it slightly crispy on the outside, soft and not overly sweet once you bite into it. MUST order.

Fried Yucca-So these are cut in one inch strips and fried. I thought they would be as good as the plantains. NO, they're not ! They tasted strange. It had a weird aftertaste on some of them I had. I do question the freshness of the Yucca. 

Mango drink-Tasted like a watered down version of a mango lassi. Honestly, skip it. 

Arepas-Now the arepas itself, they were quite good. They were airy that I couldn't taste any of the cornmeal. As for the fillings, there are plenty of choices but ugh, the line cook here put way too much salt into the shredded beef one. 

Most of us liked this place but personally it's not one of those places I'm dying to go back. Prices here aren't quite cheap for cheap eats. They do open until 12am so if you want something different, I would definitely come here. 3.5 stars.",GaTWkVy-pY6phZOqW6ykuw,3,3,4,xosyR7ptA_NRTZiiJOsVYA

I used my GPS to help me find this place and brought me to Art of Flavors. Where is this place? Ah, it's right next door to Art of Flavors tucked in the corner.

After a yummy experience from an arepas foodtruck, we got garlic shrimp arepa, pork butt arepa with cheese, Reina Pepiada arepa, wood fire chicken arepa and fried plantains. They have more options here compared to the foodtruck which is not surprising. The prices are about the same. But the arepa itself is less toasted and is heavier than the foodtruck version. The cilantro sauce is equally as good, this place's spicy/red sauce is spicier. I had to try their guanabana juice to compare it to what I had when I was a kid. 

Garlic Shrimp Arepa:
No tomatoes or veggies, just straight up garlic shrimp. I liked this a lot especially with the cilantro sauce which elevates the garlic flavor of the shrimp.  5/5

Roasted Pork Butt:
Comes with tomato slices. Add cheese. In case you didn't know, pork butt = pork shoulder and not the actual butt of a pig. Tasty pork. Both the spicy and cilantro sauce work well with this. 4/5

Reina Pepiada Arepa:
Cold chicken with mayo, avocado and cilantro. Tastes just like the one from the arepas foodtruck. A much better version of a chicken salad. 5/5

Wood Fire Chicken Arepa:
Really flavorful chicken with tomato, onions and lettuce. 4/5

Fried Plantains:
I love this stuff. My mom would fry some plantains for me as a snack when I was a kid. So simple and easy to make yet it tastes so good. The natural sweetness of the plantains come out when you fry them in high temperatures. Eventhough they could have gotten rid of the excess oil, I still like these things. 5/5

Guanabana:
AKA soursop juice and in Filipino, guyabano. This tastes like concentrate mixed with lots of sugar and water. I couldn't taste soursop. 3/5

After that meal, we headed next door for dessert. After dessert, I decided to come back here so I can try the chicharron with fried yucca. Shawn tapped out as I was enjoying chicharron and yucca. All he said to me was ""I can't believe how you're still eating.""

Chicharron with Fried Yucca:
The chicharron wasn't the same crispy fatty pork I was excpeting. The yucca was good with the cilantro sauce though. It was as if I was eating garlic fries. Yum! 4/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,7,4,4,pjbpMazSOurDcB3Du7PROQ

       - Value - I think the price is a little high for what you're getting
**Ordered**
       - $22.99 Wood Fire Mix Grill w/ Fried Plantain & Fried Yucca Root - The pork spare ribs were delicous. Tender & tasty. The Beef was ok. However, the chicken was dry and the sausage wasn't very tasty.
       - $4.50 Wood Fire Chicken Arepas - The chicken was dry. The arepas seemed to be more bun then anything else.
       - $5.50 Wood Fire Beef Arepas - Bun, oil, and salty beef. Didn't really like the taste.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd wouldn't really recommend this place. There's a lot of other places you could get more bang for your buck.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,1,1,3,O8QjbHkQPiYNmH-XDxbCFg

We will be back. We had a little bit of everything and thoroughly enjoyed it all!  

We got a three arepas (wood fired beef, wood fired chicken and roasted pork butt). All were delicious but I enjoyed the chicken the most. They serve everything with a mayo, cilantro, parsley sauce.

5367346,2017-06-22,0,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"Checked this place out today, while it was 110+ degrees out, and they had no A/C running! If they did, you definitely could not feel it because it was just as warm inside as it was outside. 

On to the food - we ordered the #1 carne asada, #2 wood fired chicken, and #4 pork butt arepas. When you get your food, they provide 2 sauces - a creamy, cilantro-ish (similar to the creamy cilantro dressing from El Pollo Loco) and a salsa verde that has a little bit of a spicy kick to it. Both sauces had great flavor, and thank goodness they did because you'll need it. I've never had arepas before so I'm not sure if they're meant to be bland so it'll pick up flavors from the meat, but they were just that. Unfortunately, the meats didn't really help either because they were pretty flavorless, too. The carne asada arepa was so dry that I had to douse it in the green sauces just to get through it and still didn't finish it. The pork butt had some type of sweet tomato based sauce on it, sort of tasted like al pastor. It was just ok, definitely not as dry as the asada. I didn't try the chicken arepa but my BF said it was just ok. 

We also ordered the 3 chicken thighs special that's posted on the window by the register and an order of yucca fries. I love yucca fries and these were just right. Crunchy on the outside, smooth inside. The chicken thighs special came with 3 pieces of grilled boneless, skinless thighs, black beans, and rice. I would come back here just for the beans and rice! Whatever flavor was lacking in the arepas was totally made up for in the rice and beans. Definitely worth a try. 

Overall, I'm not completely in love with the place but they have a lot of other items on the menu that seemed interesting. Might give it another shot some day.",urZhn8rei-iEjOLRc6sg9w,0,1,3,2P2ZE4S-NJkIHJ1HrjUA-g

Surprisingly the arrepas were good, I ordered a wood fire beef with avocado it was packed with lightly seasoned beef and priced very well for only $5. I also ordered a 1/4 fired wood chicken with a side. The fire cooked chicken was ok, it lacked flavor unless you douse it with one of the chili sauce they give you. 

When your in line you better know what you want since the line moves fast and people will be standing behind you. I definitely want to go back again to try some of the other arrepas. 

Only drawback it's free refills on fountain drinks but you have to ask the counter person to get a refill since it's behind the counter. Plenty of tables inside to eat.

I had originally wanted to get the tongue, but they ran out. Instead, the chef suggested the leg meat and I have to bow down to the tender and flavorful meat. Cut off in thick gyro like pieces, this could be deadly. The rest of the group ordered and we had this meal family style. The garlic shrimp were tender and juicy. There is nothing worst than ordering shrimp and getting rubber instead. So good we order three. The pork butt was also delicious. The pulled chicken, mayo, and avocado arepa was so rich and decadent. The combination was perfection, but not for more than a few bites. I was glad to be able to pass it on after a bite. We had also ordered the cod and that was not a hit.

After scanning reviews and the menu we settled on the Garlic Shrimp (hot), Wood Fired Beef, and a couple of Tequenos (fried cheese sticks).
I feel the food was pricey for the quantity. I liked the cheese sticks, but Doug thought they tasted too sweet. The Garlic Shrimp was ok (Like shrimp scampi on a maize bun) the shrimp was a little mushy and after a few bites was over it. The beef was ok too, just not a lot of flavor even with the sauces.

When i tasted the yummy, cheesy, tender filling surrounded by the moist corn flour wrap I could barely put it down. I love that they leave the sauce on the side, so you can add it to your liking. The shredded beef was so tender and hearty. The lingua (beef tongue) tasted very similar to a slow cooked pot roast that had been shredded and sauteed with peppers and onions. It was spicy and the accompanying sauce made it even more so. It was delicious! It took some liquid courage to get me to try it, but now I'm hooked!

I ordered some arepas, empanadas, and other goodies to sample with the office and took them back with me.  I loved the coating on the techenos (cheese sticks) and the empanadas.  The Arepas were overstuffed and packed with flavor.  Not a complaint but be aware the Arepas (corn pita) sometimes breaks apart and crumbles so dont try to eat in your car or on the run unless you are wearing something that can get dirty.

Also be aware that the menu on the website is not the same as when you get there so don't plan your order by number and call it in.

Mysty is right, the mango drink is superb and not to sweet.

The staff is friendly and Felix talks to everyone.  When it is busy, it isn't fast so be aware. It took me about 20 minutes to get my order.

I added some of the creamy cilantro sauce and it was definitely a party in my mouth. It's a cold sandwich so it tasted great while we waited for my hot arepas to cool down.

We took it back to our hotel room and chowed down.  The cachapas definitely would have been a lot better hot.  But then again...it was only a 10 minute drive back to our hotel - how quickly should I have to eat this thing to capitalize on maximum deliciousness?  I love how corn-y it tasted but with the hardened cheese in between, it became somewhat less palatable.  Also, it's sweet so prepare your mouth for that taste profile.

Hubby ordered the flame grilled beef arepa.  On first bite, I wasn't convinced it was better than our usual spot out here.  But when he gave up on it, I took the 1/3 he had left and nibbled.  I have to say the sauces and veggies inside were surprisingly good.

$7 seems a lot for what is hardly more than a handful, but what makes it great, and still a real value,  is how concentrated, rich, and satisfying that handful is.    The arepa crust has a perfect crunch and rich corn flavor - - but it is not a starch bomb - - it is a svelte, light, super tasty vehicle for some outrageous goodness inside.  The full, complex, combination of earthy beans, toothy shredded beef, and a touch of sweet plaintain, accented by the crumbly cheese is massively satisfying.   Fantastic balance of flavors, textures, and fine, fine ingredients, deftly assembled.

Screw all of those hipster food trucks that are more about the twitter feed and the graphics on the truck than the food (yeah, you, sloppi jo's.  greasy, runny pork with no depth of flavor with an egg on top and an untoasted, stale, store-bought tortilla on the side?  no thank you).  Hey look at us!  We're a bunch of goofy 20 year olds who know nothing about food but check out our cool truck and tattoos and goofy dances and overpriced junkfood served in a parking lot!  To me the idea behind a truck is good, cheap food that's convenient.  If you have to DRIVE to the truck, then what's the point.  The truck should be where you are.  YOU shouldn't have to go to IT.  

But I digress...

The masa pancake bread thing is crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  They split em and fill em with any of a dozen or so goodies, including tongue and tripe.  The fillings were yummy without exception.  I got a bean and cheese, a pork, and a beef.  All were delish.  Served with a chili sour cream sauce and a pureed hot sauce.

Also tried an empanada as well.  It was odd but good.  Very little filling in the deep-fried empanada and the masa shell blew up like a balloon from the steam created inside while in the fryer which actually made for a pillow-like chickeny pocket of love.

Bonus points for its location out front of Dino's, a great dive bar on LV Blvd.  Conveniently located right underneath a billboard for a bailbondsman, across the street from the OG.

I was talking to my sister about this, a place hooks you on certain items for a great price, blows up in popularity and then and goes and changes everything that made you love them in the first place, while upping the price.

I've been eating here for 3 years. I'm the one who gave the business owner a ""You've been Yelped card"" to claim their business page and I think they make a good product. What I hate is that they don't offer lengua or tripe anymore. Those two items are the only reason I ate here and it's the only reason I keep coming back - on the maybe misguided hope that they've brought those two dishes back.

Alas, I've been relegated to chicken or beef, which I'm none too impressed with. I can get chicken and beef anywhere. I can make them at home (which I've done - if you buy Maseca, you can make arepas.) Lengua and tripe aren't things I know how to cook for 1 person.

Located downtown, we stopped by on our way home from Vegas, around noon on a Sunday. Just a small place, but when we got there, line was to the door.

I had planned to try a couple arepas thinking they would be small enough for me to try more than one. But their arepas are a decent size. So I got one and tried the Reina Pepiada - chicken mixed with mayo, avocado, and cilantro - their take on chicken salad I would think. It was good but after awhile, the mayo just overpowered the arepa. It seemed like there was too much filling for the arepa - which some will say is a good thing. But I really liked the arepa - crunchy crust on the outside, fluffy on the inside. So it would've been nice to have a balance of filling and arepa with every bite.

The breading they used for the Arepas though was outstanding, I actually could not get enough of that which is why I loved the #1 but also the #7. The #7 was a little more creamier than I thought but the breading had me finish the whole thing.

Although it's located in an area where you can tell the taxpayers money doesn't get used the business is very clean and the interior was designed on a fairly decent budget. 

I phone ordered hoping to save time, which saved me some. No phone pick up system is in place so I still had to wait in a line that forced my food to lose some warmth. 

Service

Friendly-ish, the man working the register had the swagger of an owner. He has answers to all your rookie arepa questions and will help you decide on what you want. 

Las Arepas

Reina Pepiada: chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. The flavors are layered. The power of the chicken is smothered in the avocado which is hit with a hint of mayo and the mayo is hit with a dab of cilantro. 4.75/5

Pabellon: Beef, black beans, plantains and cheese. This was more of an obvious mixed taste rather than a subtle one.The beef and beans with the plantains with a cheesy start and finish. Good as well but not as chef d'oeuvre as the reina pepiada. 4/5

The masa: The texture and visual has a strong gordita resemblance. The taste is similar as well but cleaner, not as greasy oriented as a gordita. 4.2/5

Sides

Note: Getting fried foods to go will always take away from it's original texture so these will be rated on a +.75 curve.

Yucca Fries: Decent and made a good dip with the arepa sauce they provide for you. 3.75/5

Plantains: I've had better ones made inside my mom's kitchen. 3.25/5

Drinks

I had a Venezuelan soda ""colita"" that was far from special. Welches sodas are better than this. 2/5

Viva Las Arepas?

Si, viva. I loved the arepas. Tasty and something new I had not tried before and I am sure many of you have not either. You've got to try this place out when you're in Vegas. The prices are fair for those that aren't hoping to get by on MGM all day buffet passes. Just make sure to avoid the Venezuelan soda and go with their ""aguas frescas.""",pU6GoRTcl1rIOi6zMynjog,5,5,4,P6JlMP_-MaEBA_Ys4BcO4Q

I've tried my fair share of arepas from various places, and this place has one of the better corn meal bun. It was super airy, fluffy, and had just the right amount of flavor so that it didn't detract from the filling. I had the shredded beef arepa, and I thought it was great on its own. With one of the two sauces, especially the spicy one, it just took it up another notch

With four cackling women in my car as I head north on Las Vegas Blvd I just about missed my opportunity to make an illegal u-turn into the correct parking lot.

I was eating at a nearby restaurant and my constant companion remarked that he'd never eaten Venezuelan food before, so we should come back and try this place.  Since then I've been to Viva Las Arepas several times -- usually with visitors in tow.  It's one of my favorites and a nice find on the North end of the Strip.  My favorite is the chicken Arepa (with cheese, dripping in the creamy cilantro sauce).  It's my favorite because the chicken tastes of this fantastic smokey flavor I've not found elsewhere in Vegas.  I've also had their whole chicken (a favorite with my constant companion) and the meat just melts in your mouth.

Is it a healthy choice for your stay in Las Vegas?  Probably not.  However, it is likely one of the most delicious.  I once took my fabulously unadventurous younger brother here, and he and his friends absolutely loved it.

To address concerns raised by other visitors -- yes the restaurant itself is not in a particularly glitzy part of town; however, it is in an area that is in the process of being revitalized.  The restaurant is clean and well kept, and I've never had any problems in the neighborhood.  The food is worth it!

First off, I LOVE arepas. I go to South America a lot, + arepas are these little fried corn patties stuffed with all kinds of things, usually deep fried + heaven at 3am after a night of dancing that they sell on the streets of Colombia and Venezuela. They're like the drunk-munchies equivalent of seasoned curly fries here in the U.S.

The guy working there was also the owner, + he could not have been sweeter. This was my boyfriend's first arepa experience, + the owner asked him questions + made suggestions for what he might enjoy. We ordered our arepas, + he threw in a free empanada because my boyfriend had never tried one of those either.

The arepas here aren't the same greasy deep-fried ones I'm used to, but they are SUPER delicious.  the corn casings are really fresh, + the ingredients are fresh, warm, + delicious. He serves his food with sides of jalapeno and cilantro sauce to give them an extra kick if you like heat on your food.  There's also a big assortment of tropical juice that's really fresh + inexpensive (plus, refills are only $.99: such a bargain!).

It's always nice to see owners taking pride in their work, + the owner came out to deliver our food himself, + stayed to chat with us while we ate.  Really pleasant experience, + a nice cap to a weekend in The Vegas.",QWIWxn742z-1pBENNpsN2g,2,0,5,u-cPHKvB6t0Qe9MONolo_w

After spending $40 on an large order for my family, the cashier guy taking our order clearly was not paying attention nor was he an  engaged employee- no attention to detail here. He appeared very distracted, (I should have known as this would be been my first clue our order was going to be completely wrong just by the way he was taking our order; he never made good eye contact (direct eye contact assures confidence vs. Looking over our heads or to the left or the right but not at us) instead he was looking at the TV & I couldn't believe he was actually watching it during & while I was ordering, *he handed the tv controls to somebody during order taking which also showed his mind was someplace else. Overall he messed up and one of the major mistakes he made didn't include a $4 sauce he said ""ok"" to at the time I ordered. 

(At some point this error was rectified by management who gave us a complimentary sauce due to his employees lack of attention/error) but what is really making me upset enough to write this review was after all was said and done and my family got home to start eating arepas, our order was flipping WRONG!!

Ugghh! So frustrated & disappointed because I knew- I actually knew this guy was gonna mess this order up in which he did!!

Please re- train your cashier for better customer service skills, include the part where you must pay attention to what your customer is ordering, maby go a little further to repeat order back to the customer especially when its a large one, (This guy had black hair, glasses, tattoos, so if he takes your order make sure you ask him if he got it correct) Then maby you wouldn't receive a negative review from an upset patron....

You must order a fruit juice, forget soda. Trust me! 

I ordered a shredded beef empanada, my friend ordered two different types of Arepas, we both got a natural fruit juice. 

We sat in my (air conditioned) car to eat as it was hot hot hot outside and this was 10pm at night, ugh. They brought us our order to the car where an awesome conversation was started with the Owner Felix. 

So we chatted with Felix for a bit at the car, we informed him it was our first time trying them out. He gave us a bit of the History behind it all and how he previously worked with Mario Batali! 

He said I must try something so he went and made a Reina Pepiada Arepa for me to try! He told me I am the Reina Pepiada, whatever that means, lol Wow, it was Amazing! Delicious, melted in my mouth, full of flavor! 

He also wanted me to try his Cod empanada since I told him how much I love seafood. Mmmmmm yummy soooooo good, that also melted in my mouth like butta! The best way I have ever eaten cod fish in my life, in form of an empanada. Not just any Empanada but his which is the best! 

He also made a beef empanada for my girl Karen to try, mmmm she loved it, the best empanada ever. 

Felix...thank you for treating us so special and taking the time to hang out with us! You truly hooked us up and spoiled us so well!

We will be back sooner than you think!

While in Las Vegas for a 4 day conference, we opted to go with one vendor for all of our food needs. Our group leans liberal so we had more vegetarians, gluten-free, vegan, non-dairy types onboard than is typical. 

No problem, said Viva Las Arepas. They hooked us up meal after meal. They prepared the food and drove it to our location, set everything up and served our group buffet style. Then they cleaned up after themselves and took everything with them. 

Our guests were over the moon for the breakfast arepas. And everyone was raving about all of the dinner options. They did a great job of mixing things up so that we weren't just eating arepas, arepas, arepas for 4 days. 

They were great. We were very pleased with the price, the flavor, the service, the promptness and the good attitudes of the entire crew. 

Would definitely recommend for an event again. Loved it!",udc_V0ZRrzCP2tdRzaQ4JA,1,0,5,QpQiFj_MRNtUJl7lQ2wZQQ

The little kiosk in the parking lot next to the diner or whatever is still open, but he manages both places now.  It took two years from when he first set up store at the kiosk til he opened up his sit down restaurant.  That's quite respectable.  I could tell that Felix was still working out the kinks, but despite a long day of managing and teaching his employees, he still provided us superior service.  

The upgrade to five stars is not only for the service, but I am now very impressed with the reina pepiada.  Often times when I get it, there is a lack of flavor.  This is thus far the best one I've tasted in the States.  Also cachapas con queso, which was my second favorite thing in the meal.  The cornmeal shell was actually sweet, and I really like sweet and savory combinations.  Also we got the tostones (but they called it something else) and the yucca fries.  The tostones were a bit over fried, but at least my husband was ok with that.  The cachapas were initially over fried, so Felix brought out a second one on the house.

It was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.

I ordered the Reina Pepiada which was a cold filling of chicken, mayo, avo, and cilantro. Boyfriend got a hot filling of roasted pork butt with tomato slices.

The arepas were pretty much small sandwiches with LOTS of filling. Don't underestimate the size. I had trouble finishing my own! The tortilla(?) they used as the ""buns"" reminded me of what they use for tamale wraps. And omg the sauces they provide you with are EVERYTHING. I drenched each bite with both!!! I read on Yelp that people were stealing the sauces so they don't give you the bottles until after you receive your meal. LOL! I would've been one of those perpetrators...

 Got home and the meal was outstanding, just liked I remembered, the Arepas are big and stuffed full, one was enough for me along with the sides.

I tell you this because, deep in my bones, I believe that The Zombie-pocalypse is imminent. On occasion, I contemplate prepping a go-bag for the day it happens. In addition to the necessities such as puppies and kittens, suspenders, mint juleps, Uggs (as previously referenced), and a pure white bathrobe, it is essential I obtain one fresh meal prior to the collapse of civilization.

Allow me to present the Yelpzombie scale:

FIVE: Would push mother into approaching zombie horde in order to obtain (In-n-Out).
FOUR: Would give up left arm to be gnawed on by zombified best friend (Chick-fil-A).
THREE: Would trade one roll of toilet paper for (Jack in the Box).
TWO: Viva Las Arepas.
ONE: Given a choice of an Oprah marathon and ___________, Oprah wins. (McDonalds. Not counting Sausage Egg McMuffins here.)

As you can see, I have a refined palate. Is there any doubt that I am a true foodie?

---------------------------------------------------------

Back to business. You could get an arepa for ~$5.50, but without cheese (+$.50), avocado ($+.99), and a fried egg ($.99), what's the point? You wouldn't be getting the full experience. So we're up to 8 bucks. And you won't be full. Your stomach will curse you for your stinginess and punish you with pangs of fury. Now throw in fries, yucca root, or plantains for $3.00, and you're sitting at $11.00. Even with the extras and factoring in that some of you have pinholes for mouths, you will certainly consume your arepas in 3 bites, give or take 2 bites.

Post-tax, that's a 4:1 bite to dollar ratio. FOUR dollars per bite! Now let's take a look at French Laundry. The tasting menu runs 10 courses long and will set you back a mere $295. If we say each course is 8 bites, after tax and tip, it comes out to 4 dollars per bite. So, think hard, Viva Las Arepas or French Laundry? The answer is obvious. Don't fight math.

As an aside, Yelp, can you add a dollar:bite field to restaurant listings? Please? Imagine how much more engaging eating and review-writing would be. Every bite would literally be counted. And each bite could be individually reviewed. How much fun would that be? We'd all eagerly embrace it, especially the elites. Don't even deny that it wouldn't happen.

---------------------------------------------------------

Our table ordered three different arepas, the plantains, and the yucca. I got the beef (aka carne asada, yes, the translation makes little sense). I loved the plaintains -- they were deep fried and carmelized. Everything else was plain. Even drenching the arepas in the provided sauces could not salvage the bland mediocrity that I had invited into my mouth. I asked my dining mates to describe the two sauces and here is what our committee of three decreed:

Sauce one: lighter green, spicer, less creamy.
Sauce two: darker green, less spicy, more creamy.

So descriptive, you're welcome. Now that I've saved you the trouble of spending your precious time and money here, let's discuss what you'd put in your go-bag.",dvqgxx4hFcfraHvhddzOXA,5,3,2,vkMrICqn2DrTBuyUeV_dxw

Frankly, I like chicken fine but am not the biggest fan in my family- THIS chicken however- wow.
I cannot wait to go back and get the meat platter. I might disaparate in happiness.

Oh- Arepas also very good. Can't rave about the texture (I found it a bit crumbly) but the Pernil (pork butt) was off the charts good. We got it with avocado and I recommend you do the same.

I second the ""crack sauce"" suggestion- it would make shoe leather taste good.

Mango agua fresca also very good- not too sweet as it often is at a Taqueria.

So - why no 5 stars? Well, maybe I'm being overly picky because that chicken was amazing, but I do five stars for a home run and their sides were lackluster and the arepa was a little dry. Is this overly harsh?

I'm gonna stick with 4 stars on this but let's call this ""unequivocally recommended."" We'll see what happens after that meat platter.",1vLwvev4eGE9LfqCV_kElA,0,0,4,XC0Tl0X6eeLQ9PJqd3yxfQ

I've never had Arepas before but now I crave it all the damn time after this place. It's a mix between Pupusas and Empanadas, but the masa is completely different than flour. It's crispy and mealy - so perfect. Also, it's stuffed like a sandwich, with lettuce, tomatoes, sauce. So maybe it's more like a burger? Regardless, it's the best.

Our group were fatasses and totally ordered for a family of 12 when it was only 4 of us. But we got to try everything so it was worth it. 

My favorite arepas was the Reina Pepiada and Roasted Pork Butt! Can't go wrong with either. The shredded chicken empanada was good here too.",03RJcIDcNwH4WQmqjIvwIw,2,2,5,CFib6m-M23UKzRMgHtWgjA
5992779,2017-03-22,2,EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A,"With the recommendations of two separate locals, we knew Viva Las Arepas needed to be a stop. It was a hearty one!

Two of us split 4 arepas, and that was a lot. Three is probably fine. Then again, when I think about the 4 we got, it'd be hard to choose 3 of the 4. They were all delicious! We got 4 of the ones marked as ""chef's special"": wood fire beef, wood fire chicken shredded, reina pepiada (chicken with avocado, mayo, and cilantro), and pabellon (plantains, cheese, black beans, beef). Seriously, delicious. Hard to choose a favorite; each were distinct with rich flavors. The reina pepiada was very unique, so I'd definitely suggest getting that.

Prices range from $5-$7 each, which I felt was a good price given the amount you got. 

Chill, local spot and relatively quick meal. Check it out! Erp.",wZPizeBxMAyOSl0M0zuCjg,5,4,5,XKi4YZagrIWm9tfdpfzVCA
