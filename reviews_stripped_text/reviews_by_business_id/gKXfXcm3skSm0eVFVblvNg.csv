Fresh veggies.
Quick and friendly service.
Good prices. 
Seating areas could be cleaner though, especially since the place was empty when we walked in. 

Will probably be back.",iMhwsPY3aGZAa8i0R2c9mA,0,0,4,0YQtkuuybo0XLbyhqdtpYg

First they tried giving us someone else's order. Then said they didn't have our order, never received it. Luckily they can't deny a confirmation number!  Yeah, these idiots are just completely incompetent. Won't be back to this location EVER.",gJH4vU1VLR8OPSgHXiNPaA,0,0,1,v1HB0A_yj3ha8QrWpe9NuQ

Always different people no one ever sticks around. Because everyone is so rude we all stop buying from this subway I will be calling corporate office to complain about the staff. They are no help. 

Food is ok. You can tell no one wants to work there. If you can go anywhere but here!",6_AugSHouBMud2ngS-RoqQ,0,0,1,cSAquAQ8-EkDjl3MHUB3Qg

Peak hours and have one staff member who by the way while making 4 sandwiches at the same time and having a customer waiting for more then 15 mins asks to use the restroom and can't because ""sorry sir I have to unlock it for you"". Dirty and just bad service.  Go to another subway.",p8SiGbdI4cLKUesLtX4UrQ,0,0,1,4aAYTpCs9qj5t8blpcHNQg
4745322,2013-12-03,0,gKXfXcm3skSm0eVFVblvNg,I just came into town for the day. Needed a quick bite to eat. While I was in line I witnessed the most obnoxious customer who was just down right rude to 3 staff members. Jessie was helping this customer and I was so impressed with how he handled this very rude customer. As I was eating my sandwich I watched this same employee sweep up the lobby and greet everyone walking in and out. My sandwich was good but I was most impressed by the supurb customer service Jessie was providing. Good job Jessie!,CxdmJAfem0VzkmYzXx_kbA,0,2,5,n3BTnRtUNWzmpJJ9Jptqgg

Not like I'm homeless or disorderly. To top it off my daughter went to talk to the girl and they yelled at her so it became a shouting match.,-SpAv6Ah-LimURNz0PIewg,0,0,1,IGxmWCr4qS3MpZjJaWMYwQ

Since there was no note and I had to wait for the employee to spend 5 minutes discussing what to do with his boss, I was rather pissed when he refused to buy my sandwich. Horrible customer service, never go here!! YOUR CREDIT CARD PROBLEM IS NOT MINE, UNLESS THERE'S A NOTE ON THE DOOR OR REGISTER AND I'M NOTIFIED IN ADVANCE!
