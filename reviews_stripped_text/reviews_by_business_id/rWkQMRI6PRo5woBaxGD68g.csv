910861,2013-04-14,0,rWkQMRI6PRo5woBaxGD68g,I love trying new coffee shops so I stopped by Viva Cafe on a Sunday morning. We were the only customers in the shop.  My friends and I all had very simple coffee orders of iced coffee. The girl behind the counter seemed very unsure of what she was doing. She needed to ask us each three times to verify what we wanted. After waiting about 10 minutes we received our drinks. Let me just say that we all ended up with iced milk and a splash of coffee. Unfortunately we will not be returning.,YdfS55fR6MbxsT9J62UZgg,0,0,1,zWcCTKnmMqAvXojBr_8K_Q

The teas and coffee are great! There has not been anything that I haven't liked. Try their wellness breakfast sandwich, carne asada panini, egg salad sandwich, you won't be disappointed! I love the white chocolate mocha. Regular coffee is great too. Recently tried their squash mango smoothie and it was awesome!",k2DDqGULlYoC59GrAxC2Aw,0,0,5,sX189jQZsZDTaQkXD7qUfg

4655374,2013-01-27,2,rWkQMRI6PRo5woBaxGD68g,"Viva Cafe is a family owned coffee shop that is located at the food court entrance of the Meadows Mall. When I patronized the Meadows Mall this past Wednesday, I decided to support the family owned business over the newly opened Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf kiosk.

  Viva Cafe is a cafe that serves all varieties of coffee-based beverages, other beverages, and lunch. The cafe itself is relatively small, It features approximately three tables. This is no problem considering that there are tables outside in the Meadow Malls hallway.

  I decided to try a drip coffee with syrup. The coffee was good. However I have two  gripes that are minor. One is that they should expand the selection of coffee syrups. When you are competing with businesses such as Coffee Bean, the selection of flavored syrup could be advantageous. Two, the person that served my coffee could of been more personable.

  The reality is that I could return here one day. The greater reality is that when I return to Meadows Mall I am going to try the newly opened Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf kiosk, since I am a FAN of their powdered drinks.

    ~~~~~POST REVIEW COMMENT~~~~~~

               The Manager Teresa sent me a nice email stating that customer service is important and that if I wanted the syrup badly enough they could order it. I appreciate when a Manager or owner cares about their customers. If I am in the Meadows Mall I will show my appreciation by returning to Viva Cafe.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,2,3,3,XGl6ABoNs90pWZ954oW0AQ
