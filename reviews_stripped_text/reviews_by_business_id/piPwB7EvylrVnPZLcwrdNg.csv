My husband has always been the one to pick up the food and says that each time he goes in they give him something more to snack on while he waits for the order. They always seem very friendly, too.

The price is nice and cheap depending on what you order. My ONLY complaint about Jasmine is that they need more items on their menu. A place this good needs more variety to choose from.",PkZcF10Nqrqo74w9NWQFEg,0,0,4,HwoP1r8e6Lq4bqtJ5FFrsA

Original Review....

Outstanding!

I have eaten in the restaurant and have also ordered delivery.  Both meals were exceptional.  Excellent service!

Restaurant is very comfortable - nice ambience.  Quiet but not too quiet, nice lighting - not too dark and not too bright.

I loved all the food I have ordered at Jasmine That Gourmet and so did my husband.  Most notable in my opinion were the chicken satay appetizer, crab rangoon, and mongolian beef entree.  My husband said the hot-n-sour soup was fabulous and finished every drop.  I did not care for the egg rolls.  They were more like deep fried flautas filled with beef - not what I was expecting.  Everything else - and we ordered A LOT, was outstanding.  Excellent sauces, dressings, and rices.  

Huge selection!  The menu is a book!  Very reasonable prices!

This place, like another yelper stated, is fine to go alone, or with company.  I would also suggest this place for a good ""on the road office"" spot, while you grab a bite, as it seems to have an environment one could work in easily.

I will defintely be a regular at Jasmine Thai Gourmet now that I have finally discovered this little gem!  Thanks yelpers - you recommended a real good one!",qTllTILQ6JVifkO-5ezm2Q,2,1,4,nnnljqZKqxxSvqYsON5UwQ

I've had the pad thai, pad siew and red curry  chicken.  All were really good.  The service is really fast too.  The crab rangoon that came with lunch is good and the salad has a really tasty dressing. I highly recommend this place!",Tx-j2shO9LuH8pS8SewkQQ,0,0,5,pT5DHqYodVP-H60lW_E-7Q
291763,2008-01-18,0,piPwB7EvylrVnPZLcwrdNg,"We do take-out every couple of weeks. I love this place - it's good and reasonably priced. My husband gets the red spicy curry and I get the yellow mild curry. We've also eaten in the restaurant with my in-laws and they really enjoyed too. The people are friendly. It's never been super busy when we've gone, so it might be quiet in the restaurant. I highly recommend.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,0,0,5,YhYADiQQAN0NUUKaSkio7w

I was never disappointed by their menu, and enjoyed their delicious ginger dressing on their green salads.  The service was impeccable, and the prices were reasonable.  Good for a night with friends, a date, or just eating alone.",GcqVqgqc4nBaE27hvwvSDA,3,0,5,x5EQLlFvEMmPpN7ayukm1w

They have an interesting menu, including Chinese and Thai food, and tasty appetizers. This is a nice place to sit down, relax, and enjoy.  We were well served and our food was delicious--both times. The house salad is simple but has a nice ginger dressing.",YBWeFCP1Ou28KBXb-mFjkw,0,0,4,hUyhZgCnY8p1aNtKywUJ4g

Just recently, on our way back from So Cal this week, my fiance and I both were thinking the same thing...we want Jasmine for diner tonight.  So, I called in our order just as we were coming into Vegas and when I walked into pick it up, I was instantly happy,everyonethere is always so friendly!",gFWmjc5UED8YaXFhZAm3qw,0,0,5,6RFu6cbzBwtOn4YtckR0fA
4571177,2009-11-12,0,piPwB7EvylrVnPZLcwrdNg,"This is a major disappointment.  All of the 5 star reviews have misled me again!  I was out on this side of town and decided to finally seek good Thai food in Southern Nevada.  I hate combo Thai-Chinese places (since when did the countries share a common cuisine?)  The lunch special banner outside said ""$6.95 Lunch Specials"" but in small print ""take-out only.""  I ordered the spicy eggplant with basil special off the vegetarian menu.  I started with a salad (my friend and I called it ""sad""), then got my dish - a very very small portion of eggplant and a few bell peppers, and rice, then one rangoon got delivered even though both my friend and I should have received one - and then they gave me pork wontons with my veggie meal...uh yuk!  The dish had ZERO spice in it.  I would think ""spicy eggplant"" would indicate something, but there was not a drop of heat - no red pepper flake, chili pepper, or chili oil.  It was not worth sending back because the portion was so small, by the time I tasted a piece of eggplant to test the flavor, there was hardly any left!
Save your money and for a really good deal, go to Galanga.  I haven't reviewed it yet because I only went once, but you get tons of food for your money there.  I would not return.",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,1,0,2,-UExm8DNExr9fJgLqWgsgg

5863539,2009-10-19,0,piPwB7EvylrVnPZLcwrdNg,"I have been eating at this restaurant regularly for over 3 years. 
I went there twice with a friend in October, 2009, and was disappointed on both occasions. The tom-kha-gai (coconut soup) had lost it's flavor and other meals tasted different also. I thought that maybe it was the regular chef's night-off since it was early-week. So, the next time I went at a busier time of week, I ordered the same dishes. And the same result, except this time I had a big black hair in my soup. 
I used to love this place, but it's not what it was. It's not all bad however, it's still a very nice environment and the Green curry is still one of the best I have had in Las Vegas.. But for more authentic Thai cuisine you may want to try Basil n Lime on Forte Apache. It's more tasty and cheaper in price.",pSSWwegzWDld-GJF2gsEkw,0,0,2,k4MTYQGKvhogb7gF8HkZkQ
