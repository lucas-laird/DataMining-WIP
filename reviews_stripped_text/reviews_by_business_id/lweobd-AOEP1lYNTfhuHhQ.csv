I was really disappointed with the food. The hype isnt real. The kare-kare was too sweet and to me it tasted more like Mang Thomas lechon sauce. The lechon really wasn't that good as they all say. It was served cold and the skin wasnt even crunchy. Overall I am giving this restaurant a one-star because they really need to improve on their customer service--my whole family was not happy at all.",N_ozRXZhQXKgsrVRSPBUpA,1,0,1,h2-RftLZNdQ2AWEo0jeXtg

After an abysmal lunch service at a chain restaurant earlier in the day (see my previous review), my friend and I were in need of a memorable meal to wash the bad taste out of our mouths and this place stepped up to the plate and delivered. 

Our server, Princess, was warm and attentive to our dining needs. I had the BBQ pork, which arrived on three sticks, seared and smothered in their tasty barbecue sauce. My friend had the pork belly which was crispy and seasoned to perfection. If you're craving some heat, their homemade spice and peppers will awaken your taste buds. One of the owners came over for a chat and we complimented her on the welcoming family vibe she has created. She hand rolled turon, which is a deep fried banana and jack fruit alongside ice cream, so we couldn't resist the crispy, yet sweet dessert. We also had to try cassava cake, which is a recipe of the owner's mother. Yum!

We were welcomed and treated like family, ate a delicious, affordable, home cooked meal, and left with a renewed faith in service after visiting Cafe de Cebu instead of a big chain. Support local and enjoy this dining adventure!",CcXb9YV8C_LTuojI5-0prw,10,5,5,T1nX6Waaq-0GtoqunYQTZg

Highlights for me were the crispy Kang Kong (fried water spinach) that might be the ultimate bar snack - would be perfect with cold San Mig Light - as well as the Lechon Paksiw: BBQ pork simmered in Lechon sauce and spices ... Perfect comfort food over garlic rice. 

What also struck me was how Alex's recipes (some his, some Mama's) managed to keep the flavors integrated but still distinct. Many Pinoy dishes - especially when made adobo style - become uniform with single note flavors. Alex somehow solves this so that all the key flavors remain.

If you ask him how he does this, I'm sure he'll distract you with a warm smile and then ask what flavor halo halo you'd like ;-)",SjK5fOCITclv2cdzV9h_rg,5,2,5,WYOPPvz7T0En7euiZCoaHg

I honestly think that on those occasions, whenever their Lechon doesn't sell, they just mix it with the new and fresh ones. I am all into recycling, but maybe when I am at the comfort of my own home. NOT on a restaurant where I literally buy and pay for service and satisfaction.

I only came here because it was the closest place to me that served ube ice cream and my girlfriend was having a huge halo halo craving. So we called in and asked for halo halo with ube ice cream and turon. My girlfriend did not really enjoy either items we got and I tried to explain ""maybe you just don't prefer the flavors of Cebu?"" But after seeing the Yelp pictures, I can tell my dessert got half-assed. First off, my turon was not even fried to a golden brown color, it was still pretty yellowish in color on top of that, it didn't even have any honey/simple syrup to sweeten it. However, I do give props that they do not just use regular old bananas, but a specific tropical banana which I don't know the name of. As for the halo halo, I thought it was so-so. We did not get the ube ice cream my girlfriend was craving even though we ordered it and did not tell us they discontinued it. I also wasn't a huge fan of the frosted flakes, although they do make sense since they add crunch and sweetness to the desert. It was just simply not my cup of tea.

Although the deserts that I ordered did not blow me away and actually left me somewhat disappointed, I do have to give props for the creativity and uniqueness of the flavors I tried and the overall service was not too bad.

This place was super clean, probably the cleanest Filipino restaurant I've been to lol, and the food was ugh soooo good! 

When I first walked in alone the lady greeted me and I said I wanted to do to-go. She was asking me if I've come before and all and I said it was my first time and she was like ""why don't you just eat here, I can talk with you"" and she was so kind, so I decided yannoe what I can eat here by myself! Haha. She asked me what I liked and when i mentioned Kare Kare, she told me it was her favorite too and I had to get it! I also got the free Cebu Style Lumpia with my check in. Holy moly, the Kare Kare was phenomenal. It was SO rich with flavor and the meat was super tender. I can't believe I am actually going to say this because I NEVER do, but I think this was actually better than my mom's Kare Kare........ Oops... IT WAS SO GOOD! It's a must try forsure. As for the Cebu Lumpia, very interesting flavor! Lol I've never tried it before since I'm just used to the lumpia shanghai.

The kangkong was excellent, I recommend you order the large plate. The pork barbecue was one of the best I've ever tried, and they don't even specialize in it. The ""ngoh hiang"" was pretty good too, and so was the fried kangkong. Next up on our to-try list - is the grilled pork belly and the bibingka.

See I drove all the way from the South part of town, about 35-40 minutes one way on a Saturday night. 

I was definitely expecting very good food and dessert! 

We ordered the infamous 1/2 lb lechon, Kare Kare, lechon fried rice and bag-yo beans. 

Lechon was cold and not crispy, Kare Kare was too sweet and even sweeter is the bagoong. lechon fried rice came later and even that is nothing special. Bag-yo beans wasn't too bad and probably the best out of all. 

As for dessert, I knew I wanted to get the ube cheesecake and Taho to go. 

We got the Taho to go, my friend wanted to see how it looked like so she opened it and it smelled like ARMPIT! It was old PANIS TAHO! I smelled it and it was foul. 

I called our servers attention and told her it smelled bad- she smelled it and said nothing was wrong-- 

hold on, excuse me- you're telling me that two of us can smell bad panis Taho & you can't? Come on now. 

She was going to change it and I said no thank you, I'll leave without the Taho. 

Customer service was superb though- very helpful and very attentive. 6 stars for customer service!

Let's start off with service - excellent! They were very attentive and friendly. The staff treats you like you've known them forever. Next ... Parking is never a problem because they have tons right in front of their restaurant. 
The place is cozy and gets packed so fast so calling in for reservations was a great idea. I brought my cousins and aunt visiting San Diego and they enjoyed the food so much. 
What free Ngo-Yong for every Yelp check-in? Of course we took advantage of that. I loved the sauce that accompanied this. Ngo-Yong is very different from all the egg rolls that people are used to ordering. It's an acquired taste but its something that grows on you right away. 
We ordered the Sinigang, Kare-Kare and of course, Lechon. The sinigang had great flavor. I'm very picky when it comes to ordering sinigang from Filipino restaurants because most of the time, they under-season it with tamarind. Cafe De Cebu isn't afraid of seasoning their food and they have it right. The pork that they used for their sinigang is also lechon pork! I'm in pork heaven. Even if all we ordered was pork, it wasn't too oily. 
The lechon was so tender yet the skin was crunchy. I liked using their vinegar sauce instead of the usual lechon sauce. It provided a different taste to it and balanced out the flavor. I could smell the lemongrass that was stuffed into the belly, it was a good aroma that elevated the taste of the lechon. I had the lechon the first visit and we ordered it again the second time we came. 
Übe cheesecake for dessert, need I say more? I will definitely be back. I saw a recent post that they've also introduced Sisig. I'm sure it's as flavorful as the other dishes I've had here.",40uA-Z0AZVsnbWJ-lUVoqQ,2,0,5,IGptKrjYHX_z8tP-cmXDWQ

Walking in the place is a small and quaint. There are roughly less than 10 tables and they put together a couple for our party of 7. When we first got there, we stood at the front for a couple minutes because there was no host to greet us or seat us. It turns out only one guy was working that day. He actually turned out to be a pretty pleasant and nice server. I unfortunately did not catch his name but he was a young Filipino guy who was very accommodating and friendly).

This place is not a turo-turo where items are already cooked and you just choose. Each dish is freshly prepared and cooked after you order.

We ordered the following:
Chop suey (mixed vegetables): $7.99 (on the special menu that day)
Caldereta (beef dish): $11.99 (on the special menu that day)
Sugpa liempo (pork belly slices): $12.99 (family size) 
Pancit bam-i (noodles): $9.99 (family size) 
Boneless bangus (milkfish): $12.99
Ngo-Yong (egg roll): free with yelp check-in

Each dish came with 1 scoop of rice

Although we ordered the family size portions, many of the dishes could also be ordered solo size for a smaller portion.

From what we ordered, taste wise I liked the Ngo-Yong eggroll (crispy and delicious), sugpa liempo (flavorful and tender pork belly) and the pancit-bami (good mix of noodles). 

Portion wise some dishes like the Caldereta and the chop suey were small. I thought these were a little pricey for what we got. I also wished the Ngo-Yong egg roll was bigger. It was small and I left wanting more of it because it was that good! The best value were the pancit bam-i and sugpa liempo.

One thing to note when paying is that for parties of 6 or more they add 18% gratuity automatically to your meal.

Overall, I really enjoyed the food here! It was delicious! That Ngo-Yong egg roll is my new favorite. I am very happy to have another place for authentic Filipino eats in Vegas!",H4BiIX0gU-Fc2S487g7z1Q,23,18,4,OAx7t4QAR2aAv3vVDrhhVQ

Well today that wasn't the case, the lechon was dry, oily and skin was not crunchy. It was so sad, we recieved our free Ngo-yong egg roll and it came glossed with oil and cold inside. 

Ordered crispy calamari, was not crispy at all and batter fell off every piece. The calamari wasn't even cleaned properly you can see the skin and guts. The order of crispy Kang Kong was as disppointing as the calamari, the supposedly tempura batter was hard and filled with oil. You can literally squeeze oil out. They served this with their garlic mayo which just tasted like old mayo. Had the oxtail bulalo, which you would think would be oxtail right? Well there was oxtail but they mixed another cut of beef, so upsetting. To top it off we had 3 of each chicken and pork bbq, they were served med rare. They weren't cooked all the way through. 

I liked this place and wish it was back to what it was before. They seem like they're just cutting corners and it's just completely disheartening to know that restaurants especially filipino restaurants will serve this food without thought of standard.

They have improved, a lot, since then.

The menu is now 2 pages, as opposed to 1, and they have more than doubled their offerings.

Unlike a lot of Filipino cafes in the city, Cafe de Cebu actually freshly prepares your food upon ordering as opposed to buffet style serving.

The waitstaff was very friendly, and very informative and helpful when ordering, letting us know the portion sizes of each plate that we were ordering.

Another notch that gets this place my approval is that the decor was presentable.  That doesn't mean a lot to other establishments, but if you've been to a lot of Filipino diners, you'll know that a presentable Filipino dining establishment is few and far between. And they did NOT have karaoke.

The food was good  Reading some other reviews, maybe they have off days, but when we were there the food was yum.  We had the lechon, some fried rice, and the langka.  This was more than enough for 2 people.  We also eyed the barbecue that another table had because it was also a generous serving and looked tasty.

We ordered a variety of items, including chicken barbecue on a stick, kare-kare, sugba liempo (grilled pork belly), lechon de Cebu, and bagoong fried rice. The chicken barbecue on a stick was good, but I think I have had better. You definitely want to get more than a pound of the lechon de Cebu! It was crispy and just right! The bagoong friend rice was something new for me and you will get a very large helping; it's great for sharing. The kare-kare was comparable to what Mom makes at home so it gets a thumbs up from me.

Overall, the food items we ordered were very delicious and tasted authentically Filipino. They also tasted freshly made and I think they were considering we waited some time. We ordered two halo-halo's for dessert. It was very good except for the one small scoop of ube ice cream on top, which should've been two scoops since these were $6/each. Mango ice cream was also an option for the halo-halo instead of ube.

There was a slideshow on the mounted TV that reminded me of Philippines and made me miss it. It brought up memories and we had lots to talk about while waiting for our food.

Michael, our server, was very nice. He was attentive and even introduced us to the chef, Alex. Everyone that I came with raved about how delicious this place was. My fiancé, who is not Filipino, said it was the best Filipino restaurant he had been to and he is looking forward to coming back.

We enjoyed the crispy kangkong (which uses a narrow version called onchoy) and the very tasty herbed lechon (roasted pork belly).  The authentic cebu version does not serve it with liver sauce but they serve their own homemade version here.  It's... quite potent if you are used to the sweet Mang Tomas bottle or not used to liver at all.  I preferred eating their lechon with their concoction of pinakurat vinegar.  The bbq had good sauce, but I wish the meat had been marinated more.  Without the glaze, it was quite bland.  And the halu-halo is an Americanized version of the Filipino dessert.  Doesn't quite hit the spot.  I also dunno if it was an off day for them but the leche flan was hard.  Quite terrible.  I should've asked for a refund but service was just so charming.

First off the location is way on opposite side of majority Filipino establishments. It's located way way inland on west side of strip.  The restaurant is narrow and much smaller than your average Filipino restaurant. When we arrived there was a family of 6 and one of them was seated in the aisle so they were literary blocking the only way in an out of the restaurant.  The owner even uses one of the tables as his office so you'll see his office stuff spread all over the entire table. There aren't any counters either. When the owner rings you up, your actually standing behind him with his back facing you.  Then there are two window areas kitty corner from each other that are design to look like walk up service but it's the owner or staff member who retrieves the food and brings it to you. 

Now to the food. We only ordered a tray of pancit and Shanghai lumpia. I noticed that the majority cooks were Mexican too. Not that it made a difference but just an observation than the typical Filipino restaurant I'm use to seeing with only pinoy staff.  As for the taste, the lumpia's ground pork was a little bland. It didn't have that zest or crunch that I'm so eager to experience. The pancit was not your typical pancit. It had mushrooms and other fillers that I'm not fond of seeing in my pancit.

Their lechon is made with Cebuano style herbs and spices. Definitely different from the regular roasted lechon from the usual Flip restaurants. You can taste the slow cooked indgredaments with every savory bite you take. It was a great experience being able to taste a different style roast lechon but still tasting like lechon. I could only eat a few pieces of the lechon here due to the saltiness, but it's a good saltiness.  I'm usually inhaling massive quantities of lechon and rice and my favorite lechon sauce... Mang Tomas, you my only friend!!! You may have to ask for more sauce when you feed your face. Since I can eat only a little of that succulent piece of heaven, their 1/4 elbow of lechon is perfect for me. I don't feel too guilty after my feeding.

Their Ngo Hiong (egg roll) comes in second here. Something different and tasty. I remember dipping it in a vinegarish sauce for an appetizer. 

Good and informative service. Double the Mang Tomas yalls. It's never enough.

Instead of the typical eggroll wrapper, it was rolled and dipped in flour before frying?  I am not sure, but it was too strange for my taste.  I passed up on free egg roll offer, and knowing me, I don't normally pass up on anything free.

I liked my friend's bbq pork.  My chicken skin, though it was crispy on the outside, it was soggy where it was skewered.  The sauce on it was not for me.  

I ordered a halo halo to go.  After I placed my order, I saw a picture of it on the tv, there was chocolate sauce on it....I quickly stopped the friendly guy and confirmed that they put choco sauce on it.  I requested to hold the choco sauce.  Wow...I didn't know Cebuan Halo Halo is different than that of the other Filipino restaurant that I have gone to.  This halo halo doesn't have beans either. There was a lot of jelly and macapuno.  I think I like the typical halo halo more.

For now, I will rate it A-OK.  But, I am planning to give it another try.  Service was really good.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,3,1,3,hJLHZdU6L5YUorGz_E2v3g

The food was okay, but I feel like I've had better. Their famed Lechon was the dish that we were looking forward to eat, but when we got it, everything was basically fat. There was no meat on the lechon pieces and the skin was soggy instead of crunchy. Their pork belly slices were really dry and their barbeque was a rip off only because at other filipino restaurants, you can get more meat than you do here. There's only like 3 pieces of meat on a skewer and or 3 skewers it would cost you $/7.99. Take Fiesta Filipina, you can get at the least 8 meat pieces on the skewer and 3 skewers for under $7.00 with rice included. Their Sabaw Manok was lacking in flavor. And let's not even get into the halo-halo. For the most part it was just corn, ice, small coconut shaving, jello (and I mean the american jello, not gulaman) and A LOT of frosted flakes everywhere. 

Cafe de Cebu is pretty small compared to other restaurant and can hold at most 34 people while eating. With this said, they really didn't have enough people on hand. I think his name is Andy, and he's basically doing the job of four people while the girl behind the counter was playing with her smartphone during busy hour. There were at least 2 tables that were empty of people but filled with dirty dishes, so she could have at least taken those plates away to get people seated. We waited for at least 30 minutes while Andy was taking the orders of other, cleaning and clearing away the table, manning the cash register even though there was already someone there, and serving the food to the other customers, until we were seated it and it took Andy 20 to get our order and then another 30 waiting for our food, which in my opinion is too long. Then said girl behind the cash register actually decided to help (finally) and kept mixing up our order with the other tables around us. And since she didn't realize until they finally ate it, we were forced to wait even longer. She didn't even say sorry or thank you for waiting. 

Overall, it wasn't a pleasant experience and the only reason I'm giving it a 2 was because Andy is so hard working and is such a rockstar and so apologetic for all the mishaps.

I want my Lechon full of flavor, tender & skin crispy.  People from Cebu know what I mean!
The 1st batch of Lechon comes out fresh from the oven around 11am daily.  So, go at the right time to get the perfect Lechon!  The Lechon is served all day long.  They cook all throughout the day.  Call ahead and ask for Chef Alex to check for other times when the Lechon is fresh out of the oven.   A platter of Lechon is $15/pound.  The entire roasted pork belly can be purchased for $129; great for parties & gatherings.

As you can see, I am passionate about their Lechon!  It is really good!  Their Lechon, and acharra (pickled vegetables) are great together.

Ngo Yong was just overrated, it was greasy and just was not appetizing. Won't be ordering that again.

Lechon - was served room temp? A bit disappointing actually cause this was the reason why we came. Don't get me wrong it was still tasty and skin was still crispy, just not warm. (Not to mention it didn't look like it was a pound )

Ginataang langka - was surprisingly good! I'd come back for that.

Cafe de Cebu fried rice - I'll stick with garlic or even steamed rice next time. 

Beef Caldereta - it was tasty but for $11 I expected more than 4 slices of beef.

The rest of our group wasn't to keen on this style of egg roll. But, hey it was free.  We topped it off with the Halo Halo.  It was a little different cause they put corn flakes on the top.

Sometimes they won't have stuff from the menu like the lechon which is what they're known for and its a little annoying but we just end up getting something else and it's always good. One time they gave us a free order of lumpia coz they didn't have something we wanted lol My favorites are the bagoong rice and the BBQ pork. The bagoong rice comes with mangoes on top and it's delicious! The BBQ pork is nice and tender and flavorful. Don't get their Taho. It was weird tasting. The service is a bit on the slow side when they're busy but the servers are always very friendly and nice.,lnMz0MZIAmCbclLJf7W9zQ,2,1,4,f6_yJ145xFEGJHz-5GTK3Q

I ordered a lb of lechon, kare-kare and isaw bbq off the lunch specials. The servings were generous. The kare-kare was awesome, lots of oxtail meat. My daughter and I are used to having tripe on our kare-kare. With their kare-kare, I was NOT disappointed at all. Perfectly balanced flavor, fork tender meat and crisp vegetables, what more could I ask for? The shrimp paste complemented the entree with its sweet, salty goodness! The isaw bbq was great! It's the best I've had in LV. It was clean and the texture was amazing. It looked like it was deep fried and coated with a thick pinoy style sweet spicy bbq sauce,  HEAVEN! The lechon had great flavor. I  could taste the lemongrass and pepper. The best part about it was tge crispy skin! The meat to fat ratio was just right. Tge homemade lechon sauce reminded me of what my grandma used to make, YUMMY!

We started with their ngo yonh eggrolls which is different from the ""usual"". It's lightly battered outside and the inside is all ground meat which reminds me of Indonesian type eggrolls my MIL makes. The sauce is kinda a cross between Mang Tomas sauce and something more herby like hoisin. Different, but I liked it. 

We came from the inihaw liempo really. Been craving that and theirs was pretty solid. Bicol express was pretty good as well. The pancit was nicely cooked and a pretty large portion too. 

We sat there for a while before our food came out, but everything came out piping hot and fresh tasting so I rather wait for good food. I'm less a fan of the turo-turo style and more made to order Filipino, but there aren't very many. Cebu isn't my region so the way they cook isn't the same as how I was taught so it's kinda nice to mix it up with a different regions cooking.

Service was fairly friendly and refilled our drinks and didn't mind our long dinner chat. 

I'm definitely coming back to try more as this is one of the more positive Filipino food experiences I've had in Vegas.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,7,1,4,ufr0QhbtX2iqrBYPwyn5Og

As for me a native from the beautiful island, i can definitely taste a huge difference. For those of you who are use to the authentic island flavors do not expect it to taste the same. I ordered the Grilled pork belly with rice and i was disappointed. The meat was too tough and the price was a bit expensive for the portion you get.

I am still going to try the other dishes even thou it's a bit pricey. In reality this place is rated  a 3 start but decided to give them a 4 because i want to promote this restaurant and show the las vegas people the types of foods the island of Cebu has to offer.

So last night I was in a spur of the moment mood and called to place an order to go. When I got there at 6 pm the place was totally empty, I thought uh oh I hope that's not an indication of inferior tasting food. Lechon, albeit the skin was crispy, the taste just wasn't there or I should say it's NOT what a normal lechon from Cebu tastes like. It needed more spices and I didn't detect the smell and taste of lemongrass which is a huge part of the flavor. The pork steamed rice wasn't good at all. It was too sweet and the texture was off.

Lechon Belly de Cebu ($8 per 1/2lb): Slow Roasted & Seasoned Boneless Pork Belly. THIS WAS AWESOME! Extremely flavorful, with a very thin and crispy skin. My mouth waters thinking about it!  Seriously, order this!  They must smoke this thing for hours!!

Ok, now that we have that outta the way, how was the rest of the food??

Sinigang Na Lechon ($8.99). Essentially a Sweet and Sour Pork Soup. The soup broth was far too SOUR for my tastes and very little broth was eaten personally. The Pork was good though, very tender and flavorful, although this particular dish is just not for me.

We added the Garlic Rice ($1 add). Good version here...garlic rice is my favorite!  WELL worth the extra buck! 

Halo Halo ($5.99). Good version and large size, but it's on the ""ICY"" end. Ube is my favorite ice cream though :)

Turon with Ube Ice Cream ($3.99). This was great! The turon comes out piping HOT and melts the ice cream on top...very good!

FYI, they do NOT serve ice water here...we ordered the Coconut Juice...sweet enough for my tastes and comes in a large can.

I was actually surprised that on my first visit here, the restaurant was so dead. We were the only ones there, so of course we got the servers undivided attention. Although we were the only ones for a good hour, our server was great with timing and chatting. He didn't smother us with attention, which I really appreciate in service. 

While looking at the reviews on yelp, I read that their lechon is some of the best. Unfortunately, we did not give it a try today. We did however, try the: 

1. Cafe de Cebu fried rice, which had a very good amount of lechon chunks in it as stated in the description of the menu. 

2. Kare-Kare, in my opinion it was made decently. A little too much oil for my liking, but my mother seemed to enjoy it. The meat was cooked just to perfection and eating it, really made me feel at home. 

3. Fried Boneless Bangus, this dish was by far my favorite here. The fish was crunchy, moist, and cooked to absolute perfection. 

Lastly, we shared a bowl of halo-halo. We laughed at the fact that they substituted the usual crunchy stuff for cereal, but it actually complimented the dessert well. It wasn't too sweet and it was made just right. Considering I never really enjoyed halo-halo, I really liked the one I had today.",kJTv4vtF7KLPJouF0C2I1w,0,0,5,t93dYZETrUalrinUnKZwiA

Located in the cozy corner of a shopping plaza on West Flamingo, Filipino stalwart Café de Cebu had long been on my radar despite a brief October closure by the Health Department for questionable refrigeration practices, and recently reminded of the space by the words of a friend it was for dinner on the night before Memorial Day that I finally stopped in to find myself the only diner in the space, a pleasant experience had thanks to 1-on-1 service more than happy to educate me on a cuisine and culture of which I admittedly have much to learn.

Proudly displaying accolades from the local press for a sizable menu filled with traditional fare straight out of proprietor Mary Villarante's native Philippines, a meal at Café de Cebu is likely to find unprepared or timid at a bit of a loss, but with ample descriptions provided both in print and from the waitstaff the biggest question becomes one of portions and predilections, a whole lot of offal to be found amidst items slightly more familiar, the first timer encouraged to do their research and ask advice as 'signatures' proved to be not only accessible, but also quite good.

Told that no diner at Cebu should go without the Ngo-yong or highly praised pork belly it was with an order of the former that dining commenced and originally serenaded by a native cooking show with subcaptions I admittedly played the 'dumb American' in requesting *my* native Cavaliers be turned on instead, the crunchy fried cylinders of pork and hearts of palm rich in cloves as well as allspice proving a bit too heavy  to be fully enjoyed in such quantity, though certainly something worth sharing amongst friends.

Moving on to a substantial bowl of fried spinach that thankfully suffered from far less sog than did the aforementioned eggrolls, suffice it to say that this $3.99 dish easily justifies its cost despite falling just short of that at Nittaya's in terms of delicacy while the barbeque chicken skins glazed in sweet sauce prove an equally impressive value for just two-dollars more, even if the crisp flesh isn't exactly the easiest thing to liberate from a thin skewer of wood.

At this point turning my full attention to the restaurant's signature item, my order apparently amongst the last bits left from a fifty-pound roast to begin the day, there is no doubt a reason that many have called the Lechon de Cebu one of the city's best pieces of pork, and costing just $1 an ounce with orders as small as a half-pound available the small bowl proved just enough for one as skin shattered like glass over supple flesh, a trio of sauces ranging from fermented and funky to sweet and saline each proving more than adequate to temper the fat.

Unfortunately sold out of several traditional sweets, but offering a few specials in addition to the laminated menu's offerings, it was with a large bowl of Halo-Halo that a sampling of desserts began and although the purple ube ice cream was a bit less flavorful that I'd have expected the amalgam of textures beneath it was more than happy to compensate - everything from melons to corn and gelatin dispersed amongst ice crystals and cream in a portion more than adequate to share, the same not to be said of tiny circles of inconsequential pie and cheesecake, though at $2 each both the quality and quantity here, too, seemed quite fair.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,7,3,i9kTbOOugxNS9LThmErqCw

Upon entering Cafe de Cebu, we were greeted by a friendly couple. They asked us if we're originally from Cebu.

Cebu is a city in the Philippines where you can find the most attractive Filipinos (Chinese + Spanish + Filipino = fine specimen). Cebuanos are also known for their hospitality, musical talent and love for fun. I know this because I've been there and my ancestors are from Cebu before becoming Manileños. 

Guitar hanging on the wall, Sto. Niño, TFC and people speaking in Bisaya...lechon, ngohiong - very Cebuano. The best lechon is from Cebu so, I had to try their lechon belly. 

Ngohiong:
Fried lumpiang ubod (hearts of palm) with 5 spice. We were given free ngohiong just for checking in. Honestly, I'm not even a fan of ngohiong but I ate it anyway. Personally, I like dipping it in their garlicky vinegar better than the ngohiong sauce. They'll tell you how to make ngohiong sauce so, don't worry. 3.5/5

Lechon Belly:
Crispy and tasty pork skin. Meat is tender, juicy and has lots of flavor. You can dip it in lechon sauce, eat it plain or what I do - dip it in garlicky vinegar. I like trimming the fat off of what I'm eating but with this lechon, there's not a whole lot of fat trimming necessary. You can get this by the pound. We pre-ordered a pound so, it was freshly cooked when we got to Cafe de Cebu. 5/5

Garlic Rice:
If I'm going to eat rice, it has to be loaded with garlic. Otherwise, it's just boring white fluff to me. Most places have really oily garlic rice but CdC's wasn't. It had roasted garlic on top so, it added texture AND flavor. 3.5/5

We came here because our friends had ordered the Lechon for Thanksgiving and we really liked it and thought the restaurant would have some delicious treats for us. The place was easy to find, but when we got there, no one greeted us and we had to find the server. Once we were seated and looked over the menu, I asked about a special drink they had listed, but wasn't available so I ordered water. I ordered oxtail soup while my boyfriend ordered the shrimp pancit. 10 mins later we were finally served our drinks. Then almost 15 mins from the time we ordered our server informed us that they were out of shrimp. I suggested my boyfriend order something else all together... but the server told us the pancit was already being made... so we settled for pork. My oxtail soup came out first. I could hardly wait. But my palate tasted nothing extraordinary... if I could describe the taste in color it would be a boring gray... the oxtail's mild taste was thrown off by watered down broth. It almost brings me to tears as I write this, such a waste of good meat. The pancit joined us about 5 minutes later. I can almost make up excuses for bad oxtail since it takes so long to prepare... but there is absolutely no excuse to have bad pancit... And the pancit noodles where great... but what the hell were they thinking? Hard pieces of non-edible pork was riddled amongst the flavorful yummy pancit... WTF it was so horrible. But the final blow to our meal time experience was  the check... my boyfriend had though he ordered the solo meal pancit.. but instead was charged for the family size. There was no conformation from the sever and granted, the boyfriend didn't specify he wanted the solo meal... but come on this is suppose to be a professional business and I am sure this hasn't only happened to my boyfriend.  Instead of correcting and complaining we left, disappointed and curious as to why this place has sure high marks. The pork was good when it was ordered to go for thanksgiving... but the dine-in experience could be improved upon: more flavor in the beef broth, get rid of the ""pork"" in your pancit and get some shrimp... there are people trying to eat here!",HLY9oDcVBH9D25lU4X_V5Q,2,0,2,goTiwcP8EY8rMMU_ZG75xQ

5492360,2013-06-06,0,lweobd-AOEP1lYNTfhuHhQ,"So this is really a rounded up 3.5 star review.  Let me start with the lechon is probably the best I've had in Vegas....better than Salo Salo, Goldilocks, etc.  I love pork and this pork is moist and flavorful with a crispy skin.  At some other restaurants it can end up more like pork jerky...and being a fan of the Chinese style roast pork...this lechon is comparable.  So why the 3.5 stars....the ngo-hiong lumpia just didn't seem crispy enough for an egg roll to me, the exterior was almost slightly chewy.  The filling also wasn't meaty enough for me, I guess I'm too use to shanghai lumpia.  Also they have calamansi juice and mango juice...I'm in love with calamansi!  So the staff is extremely friendly and accommodating, however seeing as we were only 1 of 2 tables...they should not have left out an item in our order.  Not until I reminded them did they go and check on the pancit we ordered....only to realize the order was not placed.  We didn't receive the order until the end of our meal.  The pancit was mediocre at best when it arrived.  The staff was very accommodating, they offered us free mango juice due to their mistake....a nice gesture.  However, what the fiancee really wanted was additional calamansi juice and they had run out =(.  The second table wanted mango juice, and I noticed they sent someone out to actually go pick some up.....The decor is simple, and they have a patio eating area in the works.  They have some kinks to work out since they are fairly new, but I would come back here for some lechon.",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,4,1,4,sNisJaYtzzNdqhBvpYcNMg

Secondly, the place became packed and only one server was handling everything. Our lumpiang Shanghai came out way too hot and burnt our tongues. The garlic rice was cold and stale. My friend got liver or intestines on a stick thinking he'd be daring since he's traveled through SEA and loves street food, and it came out really hard and cold and didn't even eat it after first trying it. His BBQ skewers were cold, too. My boyfriend decided to try the Kare Kare and I tried it, too, and it was sweeter than I've ever tasted Kare Kare be, and it, too, was cold. I ordered the grilled bangus and it was packed with raw onions it too was cold. I don't understand how a place could serve up some of the best food when I came in in 2013, but this meal was a horrific and embarrassing experience to bring non-Filipino friends to. I spent $80 on this meal and no one enjoyed it. Some people pulled up in their car as we were about to leave and slowed down to see if they were open. I told them to go somewhere else to eat and explained to them how awful our meal was. We ended up stopping at Primm to eat Carl's Jr on the way back to LA which ended up being a better bet. I am usually very forgiving when I go to filipino food places, but holy hell. JUST DO NOT.",7IWttXC9iwRDU3H40T8p7Q,1,0,1,TgzermeCSMZLvkQePQHoIA

After a fabulous UYE at Novecento Pizza with some of the Yelp family, Mel and I headed over to the Goldilocks off of the 215 and Decatur for the next halo-halo in line for our challenge only to find that....Goldilocks there is closed.  Ugh.  Nothing like driving around in 103 degree heat in search of an icy dessert.  So, upon Cathy C.'s prevous suggestion, we backtracked and ended up at Cafe de Cebu.  Another Filipino restaurant that I've never been to, this is a small space which looks like it used to be a little pizza place.  The server was very friendly and after we placed our order, she asked us both if we were Filipino.  We both replied in the affirmative and then she asked me if I was full, as in, full Filipino?  Uh, yes, I am--all the way full.  This happens to me all the time from other Pinoys, but it's the first time one of the contenders has asked me.  I'm going to keep track just for kicks.
On to the halo-halo:  Cafe de Cebu's version has peaches, ube ice cream, corn,  Frosted Flakes (the cereal), gelatin, langka, jam, coconut, and a couple of small pieces of leche flan.  First contender to be served in a nice glass bowl.  $4.99.  Still no  ube here.  No red beans or white beans.  First time to have halo-halo with corn and Frosted Flakes; different for sure.  This is Cebuan halo-halo, eh?  I liked it, Mel was not a fan of the corn, but I couldn't really taste it that much.  I'd like to go back and try some of the food; they have something called Chicken Skin BBQ on the menu!

For the record, I'm doing the odd number reviews, and Mel's doing the evens--we're going to stop at ten so we don't develop Type 2 Diabetes:

My biggest complaint with a lot of places is you don't get your money's worth. I call it "" Overpriced and Underportioned"". This place is no different. The most raved about dish is the Lechon Pork Belly. Everybody raves about it and it is their recommended dish. It was OK , like deep fried pork , soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. So crunchy hard was the skin I almost broke a tooth. Not worth 15 bucks a pound. I had better Pork Adobo at the Santa Fe buffet and much tastier. We also got the Nyong-Koo egg rolls. They were just ok. Had the Fried Calamari that was the appetizer for 8 bucks. It was bland and very greasy , like they needed to change their oil. The sauces on the table were very good though. They were a Spicy Vinegar sauce and Nyong Koo sauce for egg rolls. We also tried the Pork fried rice. Nothing to Rave about. We also got the BBQ Chicken skewers. Three small ones for 8 bucks. The best part of the entire meal were the Banana fritters. Delicious. Overall not that impressed. Maybe if I was Fillipino I would really love it , but I'm Sicillian and I much prefer Italian food over this. I probably won't be back.",-Ia1lWvBNdgGySyB2VSgNQ,0,0,3,wd3EbDckQKVPKH8XJ76X2Q
5651012,2013-09-09,0,lweobd-AOEP1lYNTfhuHhQ,"I came in here weeks ago, and I had been putting off the review for this place... Because I kept forgetting. But I got their lunch special.. Totally forgot how much it was (probably around $6), but it was grilled pork belly with one lumpia and a bowl of soup. Oh! And rice. For the price you pay, I guess you do get what you pay for when you come here. Although the pork belly was the bomb, they could've added more. It was like they were super stingy about their servings. I probably only got 10 small pieces of it :( The lumpia was alright. I think you need to have an acquired taste to it because I didn't enjoy eating it. This was my first time trying the lumpia out and mind you, my mother is Cebuana lol. 

I'd want to bring my mom here since she has never been, but I'm not so sure if I'm willing to pay so much money if I'm not going to get a lot of food :/",O8BcJ8S4JwHHZWnx3Asd1A,1,0,3,xU_pLwzz6yz2ITx4TFVkPg

Other items in the menu are good as well. Tried the pancit, pork belly bbq and the lumpia.  I am Tagalog so the food tastes different from what I grew up with.  But no complaints.  Will come here if I was in the area.",cVuf3kbZIq0TNpdF3Tr9jw,6,1,4,qXIIKPwtbwxz-z0ZfER_BA
5792539,2014-01-14,1,lweobd-AOEP1lYNTfhuHhQ,"Ordered the chicken skin with garlic fried rice and a 1/2 lb. of their ""special"" lechon, and I was not impressed.  

Chicken skin came out really soggy.  I asked the server to throw it back on the grill to make it crispy and he did.  It was good, but too sweet.  Not something I'd bother ordering again, but if you do order it, ask for it crispy.

Garlic fried rice tasted like old rice from the bottom of the rice cooker.  It was hard, over cooked, had no garlic flavor, and was served to us cold.  Passssss!

Lechon was also served cold, with extra dry pieces, and no skin.  The table next to us ordered a 1lb. serving and it looked completely different from what we got.  Their dish was nicely plated with an even ratio of skin to meat.

Anyway, not coming back.  Disappointed that our lechon looked and tasted like shit, and that our garlic fried rice tasted like it was left overs from the week before.  It would've been nice if I were served what everyone else on yelp got.

I'm completely turned off.

Side note- the free lumpia type thing they give for checking in was good, and their sauces are tasty too!",ywI6YzxkoKyKC2JV4_19Sg,4,0,2,N5rsXkStHwKFNQrFe_42EA
5810979,2015-04-23,0,lweobd-AOEP1lYNTfhuHhQ,"I thought this place was sooo delicious. Their Kare-Kare is the best I've ever had ! Especially with bagoong. I wish they would put more meat in the entree... Their fried rice is good.... I'm not crazy about it. I've had better fried rice, but I am very picky when it comes to rice. I found their rice to be dry.... and I had leftover and warmed it up the next day and it was even more dry. I also had the bulalo and that was super delicious! I typically don't eat bulalo but eating it here changed my mind! We also had their lechon (We went in about 730 and we got the last 1/2 lb available for the day) and it was very good!!! Worth getting.  I will be coming back here on Sunday with my mother for lunch and another Kare Kare!!

One more thing, I wish this place wasn't so far from northside -- but it's worth the drive to come down once in a while and eat here !",fOpHPf-xW8Rk6GLcBotnMg,0,1,4,qUhv9m4gWiy6IP4H47RAbQ

The sizzling bulalo (beef shank with mushroom garlic gravy) and lechon de Cebu (Cebu style roasted pork) were so good I hurt myself. Have something refreshing and sweet to drink, like coconut or mango. It will balance out all that protein and fatty crispy pork skin goodness. If you are familiar with Filipino seasonings, you'll be in heaven. Some of the flavors may be a bit of a shock to western pallets. Just go in with an open mind and empty belly.

5962792,2014-10-12,4,lweobd-AOEP1lYNTfhuHhQ,"Cebu is my favorite island in the Philippines.  When I saw Cebu in this restaurants name I knew that we had to try this place.  It is not the usual kind of Filipino restaurant.  It is not a turo-turo place.  The place is small and comfortable.  Service was friendly and helpful.

Here is the food we tried:

1.  Ngoyong was free with yelp check-in.  This egg roll tasted okay with their special sauce.  Not very warm when it was brought to us though.  (2.5 stars)

2.  Lechon.  Tasted good, but we expected it to taste better.  It was not brought to us at the right temperature.  It did not taste fresh.  Seemed like it was warmed up, but not warmed up enough.  More like what I would expect at a home, and not at a restaurant.  (3 stars)

3.  Chicken BBQ.  It was two skewers.  Kind of pricey for just two of them.  Tasted fine, but most places make this better.  (3 stars)

4.  Bagoong rice.  Very colorful presentation.  Tasted yummy too.  (4 stars)

5.  Carioca (I believe that is how you spell it).  This dessert was amazing!  This was the best part of the meal!  Make sure to save room for this special treat!  (5 stars)

Overall, Cafe de Cebu is a good 3 star Filipino restaurant.  I think that my expectations may have been too high.  I would still frequent this place on future visits to Vegas.  Hopefully, they will improve further.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,6,4,3,IzOnuKr4s7wzZwjXVUUl6g
