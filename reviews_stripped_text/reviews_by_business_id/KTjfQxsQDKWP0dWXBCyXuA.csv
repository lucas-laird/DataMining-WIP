Told the waiter he took the food and warned it up I guess in the microwave.. Food came back out brisket was tough as leather. Why would you think its OK to warm brisket a second time in the microwave and wings were still cold.. Only thing hot were the baked beans and corn muffin all the rest of food was cold.. The waiter was nice enough to charge us for the drinks and took the food of our bill..how nice for something we never ate..I have been to famous Dave's many times luckily the one in galleria mall..

377278,2011-05-20,1,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,This place lives up to its name! The food is OUTSTANDING! I went there for the first time with a friend last week and I was truly impressed by the service.

417982,2012-05-05,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"A-OK.

Looks like an Applebee's, T.G.I. Fridays, Red Robin, Chili's, etc.  Smells like any one of them too.  Oh wait, it's a BBQ thing here; I guess that's enough of a difference.  Not my usual M.O., but since I never been, and a friend suggested it as a our lunch option... sure, why not, I'll give it a shot.

My friend was pretty adamant about being seated at a table.  He later explained to me (therefore I cannot personally confirm or deny) that being seated at the bar is a gamble on one's time.  Either you will see your food right away, or you will be one of the last to receive your food in the whole restaurant.  So if you have a lot of time and don't mind trying your luck, by all means, be seated at the bar.  Since we had work to get back to, he made the more prudent choice.

We got a waiter that was on the verge of being over-attentive, but I'm far from complaining.  I'll take that over the opposite any time.  He was prompt, courteous, and informative too.  He asked if we were familiar with Dave's, and I fessed up.  He took the time to explain their entire sauce selection (not on BWW's scale, but decent nonetheless).  This process involved pouring a small amount of each onto a large dish.  With a small bowl of seasoned chips (unseasoned would have been preferred, but they sufficed), we got to try and compare thoughts on them all.

Here are my thoughts.  The Rich & Sassy that they claim is famous enough to put on everything is about as standard, boring as BBQ sauce can get.  The Georgia Mustard would actually be absolutely fantastic on fish, chicken, salad, or some such.  Texas Pit and Sweet & Zesty are just different plays on their first sauce, and equally as remarkable.  Devil's Spit, despite the blasphemous/gross name, was actually fairly tastey, and I don't typically say that about BBQ sauce (if you haven't already figured that out).

We ordered off their lunch menu, and I decided to go with the brisket sandwich.  Now in my experience, BBQ brisket is supposed to be cut thin and across the grain.  What I got instead was just a collection of fatty cubes between buns.  In another words, what I probably got was just the left-over scrap from a brisket.  The price definitely did not reflect the product at all.  Luckily, being the opportunist omnivore that I am, I still ate it.  For what it was, with help from the right sauce, it wasn't half bad, but disappointing still.

Luckily the sauce experiment definitely compensated for the deficiencies of the meal.  Although when I was asked if I was going to finish the chips at the table, replied yes, they were still taken away.  Good thing I remembered we had to get back to work, or I would have pursued the matter.  Oh well, check another one off the list at least.",0c0d6-jwJoAlwMVcOowEQg,1,0,3,fx781jPKwpAkAEG72xfJcA

481123,2014-06-26,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"Love the food at Famous Daves and have been to this particular restaurant numerous times with great service, but sadly tonight was a disappointment. 

I never have had an issue with this location until tonight. I'll admit we went in for dinner a little late at around 910pm and wanted to sit in the bar because it is typically faster than in the dining area. No one was seated there and the bar was clearly being cleaned up because trays were up and it smelled of cleaning solution. We asked the bartender behind the bar who was trying to avoid interacting with us if the bar area was closed and she said yes but it's okay we can sit down wherever we wanted. Her response made us feel unwelcome and uncomfortable. After contemplating a few seconds we decided to leave because we didnt want to be a bother to her already cleaned section. She didnt even try to stop us or apologize so we left to the much friendlier Chipotle located in the same shopping center. 

If your closing hours say 10 you should not be completely cleaning up at 9. There were families still eating in the restaurant so why should you have to smell cleaning solution while your trying to enjoy your dinner?? We didnt bum rush you at the last minute before closing. My husband and I knew exactly what we wanted because we are regulars so we would've been out well before 10. Tonight made us think if we will ever be back...sad how one bad apple can ruin the bunch.",uSuUpHKR5LJqXheORiZtnw,1,0,2,C_mnSGyrIvpOJ4JV-vto_Q

We  had dinner there. It was our first time at any Famous Dave's so we ordered the Feast For Two - ribs, chicken, brisket, coleslaw, beans corn and cornbread. There was enough to stuff ourselves silly and still have some of everything (except the cornbread) to take home. The ribs were exceptional - although I don't enjoy any heat/spice and there was no sauce option to accommodate me, so I only had one rib. That lowers my rating from a 5 to a 4.

While all the food was good, the brisket was not ""falling apart"" as a truly superior brisket should - in both our opinions. Again, the coleslaw had a mild southwestern ""kick"" to it - making it less edible for me. Oddly it was the corn on the cob that we both went crazy over. So if we go back it will be ribs for her, cornbread and corn for both of us - we could take or leave the rest.",3IJBR4zpeHtYxzRFuBMCxw,0,0,3,74gfteIA5A-pj9BMwi4BxQ

Also, the service was kind of lame. We had to flag down waiters just to get refills on our iced tea. We didn't get butter until we were halfway through with our meal. 

The corn on the cob was overcooked and the other side dishes were uninspired. The cornbread might have been the best part of the meal. My husband got the brisket, and he didn't seem to have any trouble eating it all. My pulled pork was palatable. But all of the meat was served on top of a giant piece of Texas toast. I think this was to give the appearance that we were getting more food. Given the price of our meals, I was hoping to have enough leftovers for another full meal. Alas, that wasn't the case.

The most annoying part of our experience was the lighting. The lamp above our table was outfitted with an amazingly bright light bulb. When I looked around the restaurant (after blinking at the spots in my eyes) I noticed that all of the people sitting in booths couldn't look across their table because the lights were so painful. The light was so bright that the bbq sauce on my pulled pork was making me squint from the glare. So, even if you are tempted by the booths, ask for a table. 

In short: if you're in the neighborhood and want meat, this will get the job done. Just remember to wear sunglasses inside.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,0,0,3,4Ai6_867kZmmoqpR6IloPw

So I ordered the platter which was about $12. It came with 5 chicken tenders, 2 sides, a corn muffin, and  sauce. The tenders have a perfect crunch on the outside and juicy chicken on the inside
It really hit the spot!
So delicious!
Everything was great and filling!
Definitely better than Raising Canes in my opinion. It was so good I didn't even think about taking a pic of it until I was almost finished.

The chicken in the sandwichwas juicy, and the different BBQ sauces were all delicious! I enjoyed Dave's BBQ sauce and the spicy devil one (forgot the exact name for it). For the side, I got the mac 'n cheese (it had jalapeno chunks that made it even better!) the first time and corn on the cob the second time. I would stick to the mac 'n cheese since it seems more like a specialty. My coworkers ordered the sausage links, ribs, brisket... and all enjoyed them very much.

So, after reading the water soaked menu's (which had a HUGE selection of choices), and attempting at drying our pants... , we ordered.  I had the bbq rib plate with green beans, corn, and cornbread.  Everything was really good.

But what I thought was especially cool was their selection of BBQ sauces.  I couldn't get enough of the ""devil's spit"" - my mouth was on fire and I was LOVING it.  They also had about 6 other choices - there's a sauce for everyone here!

2058150,2016-08-09,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"Came here on a suggestion from a friend. We were seated promptly and got our drink orders placed by one server. A different server came by about 15 minutes later to take our order--well after we were ready.

The fiance is weird about eating pork, so his loss--he had the brisket platter combo with baked beans and sweet corn. I ordered the pick 3 combo plate thing with the shredded pork platter, mac and cheese, and the small caesar salad. The server noted that the macaroni comes with jalapenos and is spicy, but she could get me plain mac and cheese--so that's what I asked for. Our food took another 30 minutes after placing our order to come out. We came in around 830, so it wasn't busy at all, but the server didn't once stop by to check on us or update us on times (e.g. ""only a few more minutes"" or something"" but looked like she avoided us in our corner booth a bit.

When our food did come out, she explained the BBQ sauces, answered all our questions, etc. The corn muffins were great but a bit crumbly, and my pork was tasty and soft and shreddable but not dried out. I tried a few of their sauces but I liked the original and the Texas ones the best. The beans were tasty, and the brisket was tender. My mac and cheese, though, tasted like Stouffer's from the frozen section. I was really hoping for something homemade and extra cheesy. 

My plate came with a mini brownie dessert. It came in a sundae cup, but was served with a soup spoon that was too wide to fit into the bottom of the cup to get to the bite-and-a-half of brownie that was in there. I asked for another spoon and was told that that was the smallest they had. What a weird way to serve food--in a way people can't eat it. Same with the plating of the saucy meat and bread on the paper: when I cut through it with my knife, I found paper ripped and shredded into my food. Not their fault, but it was something I had to look out for when eating. I guess you're supposed to pick it up like an open-faced sandwich/toast?

Overall, most of the food I found to be extremely tasty. Some of the service was slow for how late it was in the evening, and there was some snags in the meal. But the BBQ is great, and that's what I came for. Delicious! Would come again.",YnMHlGm6XX1MtnKqiSgDIA,0,1,4,fkpiRilZNt1J0LqAi0SbEA
2069247,2010-10-14,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"How does one really rate serialized mediocrity? Seriously.

Call me jaded by the marinade of Dr. Hogly Wogly and honest to god real backyard Que, but the factory Que here is just like a Denny's, in other words where you go if you don't want to risk success or failure, but just eat, a lot.

The best thing was their sides, but to be honest the ""Creamy Slaw"" was a carbon copy of KFC's. Does anybody know if they are the same chain? If so, that question is answered. It was not bad, in fact one of the reasons I do stop at KFC is the slaw. The potato salad was nice with the potatoes cooked completely and other veggies nice and crisp. Even the mac and cheese was great. However...

Sides are great, but Famous Dave's is a Que place so what counts is the meat. First off I had the brisket (like I've said, I am a beef guy) and my wife the baby backs. There are 5 different sauces to choose from, mild to ""oh my god that was supposed to be spicy but fell so far short that it can be chugged."" No risk with the BBQ Sauces. The meat was indeed smoked, not sure with what, it was something other than an aged hard wood, I could taste some of the sap or something chemical you get from either softer woods or wood not completely aged and dried. The brisket was hot and moist when served, but dried on the plate and became mealy. Sauce could not help this. They did better with the baby backs, but then again, how can you not, the cut is so fatty in the first place. The only way to screw it up is to vastly over cook or grossly under cook. There is a huge ""done"" range for baby back ribs; they are forgiving. So I had a couple of those bones (see, I do not turn up my nose at the pig) and found they were just like everyone else's, read that Chili's and say Tony Roma's. Please note I am comparing chains here because as far as I know there is no chain in the world that pulls off superior Que.

Now we get to things like service and atmosphere. Our server was over every 3 minutes, is everything okay? So will you be back? And so on. It was annoying and as a matter of fact, no I won't be you over eager twit! To say I was annoyed is an understatement. I had my watch out, she literally stopped by every 3 to 5 minutes. Talk about desperate. I normally tip about 30% or more because I know a good tip can make your night, but sorry, good old standard 10% for you, I just couldn't open my wallet that wide is was chaffed from all the inquiries as to when I would be spending more there. The décor was cookie cutter, as if they have done it about a thousand times (which I guess they have) and while comfortable did not impress.

Over all this place should get about a 2 1/2 stars from me, but since I can't give a half star I will be generous and round up to a simple 3 stars since I recognize that some people are going to love it. But believe me you can make better Que on your Weber at home any day of the week.

This will not make my ""Cheers Spots"" but will make my ""BBQ search list"" since it is Que after all, sort of.",h2Ph6OQiFTY1J6CtRWJzLg,1,1,3,4Xpmy1MS5zN59f4p_s2phQ

2103017,2015-06-06,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"Memphis BBQ is superior by far. The BBQ ribs I bought at Dave's tasted like they came from the grocery store deli. The sauce tasted like something you'd find in  a plastic bottle on the shelf of a Food4Less. I've had their bottled sauce but I kind of expected it to be a little more homemade at the restaurant itself. The ribs were missing that smokey, charcoal flavor one would come to expect  from a good restaurant. They really did taste like they were made at a Walmart deli. 

And I think I should mention that is was the saltiest BBQ I've had since 1982 (yeah, had an experience back then I STILL remember). It was appalling. 

 I paid over $27. The ""big slab"" aka the full rack seemed to be a half rack size instead. I've been eating BBQ for over 40 years (used to live at Silver Dollar City in Pigeon Forge back in the 70's--lucky me) and I know what a full rack should look like plus what good BBQ should taste like. Their sides are KFC sized, not hardy and filling like i""ve gotten at literally every other BBQ restaurant I've ever eaten at. Additionally, they didn't even have horseradish like Memphis BBQ does (theirs is the best I've ever tasted BTW). 

Famous Dave's is nothing more than an extension of their bottle quality sauces. A restaurant should hold itself to a much higher standard than what the grocery store offers. 

The one compliment I will give them is that the ribs are very meaty, just not a full rack of ribs. I feel so ripped off. If I hadn't ordered it as takeout but instead and dined in I would have asked for a refund. I'm sorry, but your restaurant is for the less discriminating, less initiated palate and targets those who've never experienced good BBQ in their whole lives.",jXC1_maWkHNUGUOK5wl3wg,0,0,2,gJAp22PraqdI7djFPMfMXQ

After a dedication of my best friend's twins at their church nearby, us hungry worshippers occupied the 'party/large group' area. There were about 20-25 of us in our party. Upon arrival, the host opened the door for our large party, arriving sporadically (that's a lot of door opening on a windy day!). The tables were arranged family style, one long table seating 20 of us, with a few overflow tables. They quickly supplied carseat holders for the twins, who were snoozing away in their infant carriers, and asked if we wanted the cupcakes that we had brought in, to be placed in their fridge. (no qualms about bringing outside food into their restaurant!). 

Complimentary potato 'chips' were aplenty, drink orders were filled and our cups were never empty, even with the amount of people in our party. My BBQ chicken platter, corn muffin, and garlic mashed potatoes were delicious. It helps that I'm slightly biased because I love their variety of sauces and even buy them at the grocery store.

We got sat right away and got our drinks. Our waitress was nice but you could already tell she was fairly frazzled. We placed our order and that's when things took a turn down hill. It took us an hour to get our food. My friends food came out luke warm if not totally cold. But she ate it anyways. My food was just gross. My rib tips were super tough and covered in a thick grease. And my hot link was not only not spicy but cold. Now yes I'm sure we could have sent our food back but we had already waited an hour. I picked at my food and decided it wasn't worth eating. We asked our waitress for our check and she disappeared for about ten minutes. She came back with the check and asked if I needed a box. I politely said no the food wasn't that good but thank you. She said she would send her manager over. The manager came over with our credit cards in hand and gave them back to us. She loudly asked why I thought the food was gross. And said to say something next time so that we could enjoy our food. I tried to explain to her that we didn't have time to send the food back after already waiting an hour but she was already walking away.

I have a love-hate relationship with Famous Dave's.  After dining at the Flamingo Road and Craig Road locations several times, I can tell you their food is consistently good.  Their service, however can be hit or miss.  It's never bad, but not always good.

If you haven't been, here are a few things to consider trying:  the Devil's Spit Brisket Burger, Burnt Ends Sandwich, a Stuffed Baked Potato, or just grab a plate of Brisket with some sides.  It's all pretty tasty.

For military folks in Las Vegas, on Monday they offer a 15% discount for active and retired military, and $0.99 meals for kids!  Hard to go wrong with that deal!

Overall Famous Dave's is a good option to get your necessary dose of BBQ.  Give it a go, just accept the service for being hit or miss, and enjoy the food.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,2,0,3,84WnuOViJ_fNVCwSqYhbUg

There were 5 adults and 1 child in our party. We invited some friends who had never been and we couldn't we  wait for them to try your food. We came in knowing what we would order but the waiter Benito took over 10 min to even take our drink order. Once he arrived, we also placed our meal order. We got the American feast with brisket, ribs and chicken and a kids meal. Our drinks arrived via busser and bartender, however the firsy 2 draft beer choices my husband ordered were out so he ordered his 3rd choice. One of our drinks (cranberry juice) didn't arrive until right before our meal (Roughly about 25 min after placing order). 1. Though there was some trouble getting the drinks we wanted and the quality service we are used to getting at Famous Dave's, we looked past that to try to enjoy our night. 2. 15 min after placing order we were told there was NO chicken. Which is why I to there. As much as I love brisket, I was there for the chicken and bragged about it to our guests. Why wait so long to tell us? There were only 3 other parties in the restaurant and they all had their meals already do its not like they ordered at the same time we did and took the last chicken. By this time I was pretty upset because the cooks waited so long to tell Benito the news. We ordered pulled pork instead. 3. Once our food finally arrived, the kid's meal ordered still had not. We asked waiter, he never placed thr poor child's order. Our guests decided to not evening bother. We were hungry and everything was taking too long. The child just ate out of our food. Which is completely fine being that there was plenty to go around. But the child didn't order any of the things we did. The meats we ordered were delicious and well prepared. They tasted fresh and the sides did too. No complaints there. 

But I am embarrassed to have taken my friends there. Especially because they wanted to go elsewhere but we bragged so much about FD that they were convinced FD was the best choice. As a regular customer, I will stick to my good ol' Henderson location and never again recommend any FD location to anyone. Instead I will share how horrible this experience was even though I consider FD to be my favorite restaurant. I understand some things are out reach for the waiter or cooks. But all we wanted was to be told sooner that there was no chicken and expected our waiter to at least get our drinks right.",kq0OmEiM99FTmrQw3Z4MNA,0,0,2,ycSv-XQib1bYnibNpyHa6Q

That being said - I've been to the Famous Dave's in Long Beach and I actually enjoyed my meal - both the service and the food. I wish I could say the same about my experience at the North Las Vegas location. 

Service - our server was around when she needed to be. At least in her opinion that is. She took our order. Brought out drinks, our order, the bill and my change. Otherwise, looking for her was like playing the game - ""Where's Waldo?"" At least she was friendly. I'll give her that much. 

As for the food - my family ordered the Feast and it came out so fast that it explained why the food wasn't very good. Warm it up and serve it up must be their motto. The meat selections were all dry. Of the ribs, the brisket, the chicken, fries and corn, I like the fries the best. That's saying a lot considering I'm a carnivore and I love my dead, cooked animal meat. 

Comparing notes of my two experiences at Famous Dave's - I have to suggest that lunch is better than dinner. It stands to reason that lunch will be fresher while dinner will be the meats prepared earlier in the day to be able to serve the evening crowd faster.

I sampled the lunch special with the choice of two meats, Texas Brisket and Georgia Pork. The flavor was hidden by the BBQ sauce (too tangy) but the meat was tender. I really enjoyed the steamed broccoli and the flavor was excellent. I must talk about the Corn Muffin, I do not like corn bread but this was the whole meal, it tasted like dessert. 

I could eat the Corn Muffin alone with steamed broccoli on the side. The portions were a bit slack for the money and military discounts are only offered on Mondays.

I took the food back and pulled everything out of the bag to show her I had no receipt, she even looked in the bag. She took the wings away to make some more and asked was anything else wrong. I informed her that the baked potato was supposed to be butter and sour cream only but they had given me cheese and bacon and asked if I could have butter and sour cream and she said yes and put the container in the bag. Ellie then asked if she could give me a dessert for the mix up, I said thank you but that would not be necessary and asked if I could have a fresh potato and she said of course and tried to get me to keep the original potato that was not cold. I told her that I did not need it and she insisted I could warm it up for later and I said no thank you. I get the food home and it was poor quality. I am so disappointed that I will never eat at a Famous Dave's again and this is unfortunate because I was going to arrange for catering at work.",hiM7Yf7MDmUZTZAiRXgBxQ,0,0,1,kQFV-LZR89kwkerB5Zx5tg

Instead of ordering any of their BBQ classics, I went for a soup and a salad, which sounded great at the time. I originally wanted the soup and salad combo, but I would've been charged an additional $8 if I wanted to add chicken. Note: The cost of the combo is under 8 bucks. Our server recommended I order the salad and soup separately to save some cash. Ok, fine.

Bacon Baked Potato Soup: Did someone use my bowl of soup as an ashtray before it was served to me? This reeked of smoke! I was unable to find anything in my soup that was causing the stench, nor did my soup taste burnt. 

Chicken Caesar Salad: This salad 90% lettuce, four slices of grilled chicken breast, and a handful of croutons. The salad dressing was SALTY. 

The best part of dinner: The cornbread muffin.

Our sides were great; mac and cheese, Wilbur beans and firecracker green beans.   The fried pickles were awesome.   My cod wasn't over breaded and the tartar sauce was pickle chunky.  Rib tips had a Southside sauce and the half rack was tender and fell off the bone.

I could live on their corn muffins alone, I think.  They are just incredibly good -even one of the picky children fell in love with them.

Pricing used to be more attractive with a regular stream of email coupons for 20% off, ""Cue for 2 for$22.00"" and the like. However,  since the end of 2017 the offers all have mysteriously dried up. The company must have implemented a radical change in it's marketing strategy effective 2018.

I was all revved up from goin out shootin in the desert with my fiance and we got stuck in Nascar traffic on the way back home. Needless to say, we were starved after being in the desert and then having to sit through traffic like that!

We decided on Famous Dave's, which I have been to before and I remember it being pretty dang good. However, I think maybe Famous Dave's has lost its glimmer of BBQ goodness to me. Maybe it's because I've had better BBQ elsewhere...

We split the 2-person plate, which is half a rack of ribs, beef brisket, chicken, 2 cornbread muffins, 2 corncobs, and a crap-ton of potato wedges. The wedges were taking up half the plate! Oh, you also get baked beans and coleslaw. So how did all this food stack up?

Ribs - 3/5 
Yikes. Yes, I know. Although they did have a nice pink smoke to them, they were not very tender, and much of the meat would not come off the bone without a lot of gnawing. 

Beef Brisket - 2/5
SALTY SALTY SALTY. Oh and not to mention way too much fat. For a BBQ joint I'm surprised they don't select better meat.

Chicken - 2/5
I just did not like the seasoning on this chicken and compared with the other meats on the plate, it just seemed out of place. It wasn't cooked very well either. Just meh.

Sides - 3/5
Wedges were tasty, but way too many. Beans were pretty good. Cornbread muffins were tasty and sweet, and the corn on the cob was actually perfect. They also served the tasty little BBQ chips so you can taste test the sauces with them. 

Sauces - 4/5
For some reason FD's is doing an awesome job with sauces, but not so much their meat. I mean, I LOVE their sauces, especially the Devil's Spit and the Texas one.

Overall - 3/5
It's okay. But for a BBQ joint... eh, it's just missing that kick, it's missing that fall off the bone wonderfulness you expect.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,1,1,3,e-h9qYn8405xhv9IzP31WA

The service is good and fast even when it's busy. The food is up to par with most BBQ places I've ever been to, and they give you a dessert with a sparkler! What more could you want?! 

I always get the brisket or rib platter. Both are amazing and great sized portions. Even when I call an order in, it'll be done within 15 minutes and tastes just as good as sitting down inside. I definitely would recommend this place to anyone!",FtjawCn6w6VrjNVMQdb0pg,1,1,4,w3ZnwTV_QApHBLSzg-FqQg

The food was actually pretty good too. It was classic chain BBQ, but done right. I had the Grilled Chicken Sassy Salad which was dressed perfectly. It had just the right portion size and the toppings were all very fresh. I also had the Bloody Mary which was delicious. It was pretty spicy, but I liked it. I do wish it had more toppings though like some cheese sticks or more vegetables.

4655511,2013-04-12,3,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"This past Saturday was the first time that I dined in a famous Dave's. My brother and I were on the way to the Cannery, and he told me that I ought to give it a try. Why not, it was across the highway?

   The service from the ""Welcome to Famous Dave's"" upon entering the door to the the time that we paid our bill was exceptional. We were treated to complimentary potato chips that could give Frito Lay's a run for their money if they were sold in supermarkets. My brother and I were never rushed.  Our personable waitress was prompt on drink refills. The Manager even asked how everything was. After the meal there was zero pressure to stop talking and leave. I am under the impression that customer service matters at Famous Dave's. Likewise, customer service matters with my reviews. With that in mind, I upped my rating of this Famous Dave's from 3 & 1/2 to 4 stars.

   After seating us at one of the many booths overlooking the bar, our waitress explained the P.I.G. Club. I am so against joining anything called P.I.G. Club. This made me conscientious of what I was going to put in my body. I deviated from the typical BBQ restaurant brisket, ribs, chicken thing and ordered Dave's Favorite Burger. Dave's Favorite Burger may not be Daniel S's favorite burger, however, it was good. From a quarter century of dining in BBQ restaurants, I have come to the conclusion that they prepare well-done burgers. Dave's Favorite Burger included melted jack cheese, smoked bacon, and Dave's Favorite sauce. As expected, the burger was sticky. It seemed that I used the equivalent of a dead baby tree to wipe my hands constantly. Overall I enjoyed the burger and the french fries that came with it.

   What stands out at Famous Dave's are all the sauces on the table. I had the choice of sweet & saucy, Texas Pit, Devil's Spice, Rich & saucy, and Georgia Mustard. There was the standard ketchup next to all the sauces.

  I am glad that I finally dined in a Famous Dave's. It is not guaranteed that I will return to one in the immediate future. What is guaranteed is that I will not be joining the P.I.G Club.

Today; however, I ate here for lunch and was really amazed at how great this place actually was.  I always love it when someone opens the door to welcome me into their restaurant, I know that seems trivial but to me it makes me feel they are happy I came.  Our server was equally amazing, she made sure our drinks were always filled and the food came out in perfect time.  She even remembered to bring a lemon with each one of my iced tea refills!  Not many servers remember to do this after the first one.  

I just ordered the Famous Dave's Cheeseburger and could not finish the entire thing....something else that impressed me was that the manager went around with a smile, she stopped at every table to ask us how our lunch was going and Thanked us for coming in.

You can't really go wrong with BBQ, and the food was terrific!  I can't say I tried anything I didn't like!  The varieties of BBQ sauces on the table was a big plus, and allowed me to try a sample of every flavor on my appetizer before I decided on my main course.  



I ordered the traditional wings in pineapple rage flavor as an appetizer.  The flavor was nice and sweet with a trace amount of spice (too much spice for my 6 year old, but I barely tasted it), at $9.99 its a great deal, and the portion size was good enough to be most people's main course.  

I also ordered the devil's spit burger with a side of pineapple (love that this is a menu option instead of fries!).  All in all it wasn't a bad burger, just small.  Also, there was barely any devil's spit sauce on it and I had to add my own.  Half way through I decided to add the rich and sassy sauce too; and while I loved the devil's spit, I found the rich and sassy sauce to be even better! 

The only downside I can say is that my waitress seemed a bit off.  I asked her about about the BBQ sauces listed on the menu.. hoping to get an idea of what the flavor of each was and she snapped ""look they're on the menu"". I mean.. I know they were.. that's why I asked about them.  That, and she took very very long to come back and check on us each time.  It happens, but hopefully it's not the norm.",x7tsmp5lbgWXQ72pkwEWPg,0,0,4,VJg1sEWQD5_pn3E6iuG38g

5715832,2014-12-23,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,Went here today around noon for lunch. Erika was our waittress. The food was awesome. Minus one star because my husband ordered a salad with ranch dressing and it came out with blue cheese. We asked Erika if she could bring us some ranch and she argued with me that it was ranch. And then she brought us another cup of blue cheese dressing claiming it was ranch. Whatever. Minus another star because the bread pudding in the picture on the menu looked nothing like the bread pudding we received.,VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,0,0,3,4TjbZE79gqp2tVh7b2quRw

When I first stepped into this establishment, it had a very 'homey' feel to it. The employees were very nice & friendly. I ordered the Feast for two, since I wanted to try a bit of everything and I was sharing this meal with my spouse. The feast for two came with ribs, chicken, and a third choice of meat. We chose brisket. The sides that came with our meal was cornbread, baked beans, mash and potato salad.

Let me start off by saying, the cornbread was so damn good!!! I don't like cornbread at all... but when I had their cornbread, yummm! I want more already. The ribs were cooked to perfection. The meat was literally falling off the bone! The chicken was delicious. It had lots of flavor. The brisket was my least favorite personally. But my other half really enjoyed their brisket. At the table, they have additional BBQ sauces/hot sauces to accompany your BBQ. They also provided a roll of paper towel & some wet toilettes to eat as your heart desires! (Plus one!!) I love a place where you can eat freely. The feast for two was a lot of food. We even had some leftovers to bring home. 


Overall, I really enjoyed this place. I will be coming back for those cornbread.",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,1,1,4,JJ63ynGa6vqldqa_LZaBow
5807096,2017-10-11,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"We come here about 2-4 times a month. For dinner we usually get the Feast for two. For lunch the 2 meat platter, even though the pulled pork sandwich is amazing too. Their brisket is great most days, okay on others. Ribs and beans are always great so is everything else really. 

Be warned though that lunch takes forever. Usually 30 minutes before you get your food. Once it was cold too, but they quickly took our food back and when they brought it out again there were double the ribs on on the plate.
The manager is a great guy, very personable and seems to be great at his job too.
Darion who does take out is fantastic also, she remembered my order when I'd call in more frequently.

Our most recent server was Sean. Who was a funny guy and brought out the staff to sing happy birthday to my husband. He seems to really enjoy his job and spreads good energy. 

5 stars for the food and staff
-1 star for the slow service during lunch time",FTsRfaVbDUB6Sc6pL-J80w,0,0,4,cgmfHs6QPQcBZKt8TlvGIQ

If there are 5 sauces on the table, one should be edible. Any time there's more than 1, maybe, 2, that's an indicator to stand up and leave. Of the 5, none were edible. Different variants of ketchup and vinegar. I ordered a loaded baked potato, not on the menu, another indicator, and wasn't happy. The tater was moist but had an after the taste of sorts. The brisket was all bark, and not in a good way. Hard, dry, and flavorless. The sweet tea was as weak as the sauce. A place like this thrives in areas where barbecue is unknown. I would rate it 1 star but this place has a great atmosphere and friendly service...as they serve you McDonald's BBQ. Scratch that, I'd prefer a McRib.",4C_JFKgEo15R2eJa1s4vTw,0,0,2,OSFwC473uK2P86eu16Wxvw
5892030,2015-10-25,0,KTjfQxsQDKWP0dWXBCyXuA,"I waited a long time to try this place, but I wish I didn't. 
My husband and I went about thirty minutes before closing to place a to go order at the bar. Eric, the bartender on duty was extremely friendly and upbeat. He got our order in right away and checked on us while we were waiting. 

The food was delicious; he had the full rack of ribs, while I enjoyed a barbecue combo plate with brisket and catfish fingers. The meats were adequately seasoned and the portions were generous. 

We definitely will be back to enjoy more of the menu!",QeHm1e8h6fakyMJm8KcAtg,0,0,4,D79C8iVCOYU2z0t-YhTD8A
