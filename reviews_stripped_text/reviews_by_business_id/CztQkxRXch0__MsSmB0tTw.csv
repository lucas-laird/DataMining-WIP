33909,2016-08-31,0,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"Although located across from CSN, a potentially great location for a fast-food type restaurant, I can see why this restaurant is not busier.  While the food is made-to-order and it is good, it is a little pricey.  $1.88 per dumpling-- which are bite-sized-- is too much when you can get top-grade dim-sum for a lower price at any Chinese restaurant that serves the same.  We ordered Mongolian beef, and the beef itself was tender and flavorful, but there was hardly any beef at all in this dish-- it was overrun by onions and peppers. While I appreciated that Chiam offered organic and gluten-free specialties, I thought that the cost was too steep for the value.  Sadly, my companions and I decided that it was not worth a return visit.",kmC8nIGdQeLUOBCgRDzS8g,1,1,2,X11WhWGV0MdiKXmooxAoKg

749081,2017-12-19,0,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"I tried the Chiam at the boulevard mall. It was the most disgusting disappointment dim sum place I have ever been . I ordered the dynasty Mongolian beef and pork bun. The beef was basically ground beef the only time beef should be ground in a asian dish is almost never come to think of it I can only think of one dish that is dry cooked string beans with ground pork (Thai dish) . the vegetables were barely present their was no flavor at all . it looked like chili on top of white rice.. Wendy's chili taste better than that dog food.. And the pork bun wasn't bad but for $3 the portion was sorry . And the pricing is waaay to much they charge for each piece of dim sum lol like come I'm not that picky when it comes to food . By far worst place I've ate in Vegas get some authentic dim sum at ""Orchids Garden"". This place has never failed me . To everyone that gave this place more than 1* has never had authentic dim sum .. I honestly would rather eat McDonald's.",7WKCPbnfEoPDpUIsalI-1g,0,0,1,bwr0Bqf-mzelIf43wvUIgg

1208909,2016-03-28,6,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"How have I never been here? MY NEW GO-TO! A Chinese American (get it? chi-am?!) spot with organic & vegetarian options... AND no msg! Everything was so fresh & made to order; might have costed a tad more than typical dim sum places, but YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR! Quality over quantity, clearly. After eating Asian foods -- my skin feels oily, my stomach is in on/off knots & I feel sluggish. Not at ALL after this place! And I definitely indulged out of excitement! 

FOR HER: I ordered the TIGER WALNUT SHRIMP, which had surprisingly large battered shrimp in a creamy mayo sauce topped with candied walnuts. Paired with WHITE RICE & LONG LIFE NOODLES. I also tried the JUMBO SHRIMP SIU MAI (fave!), JUMBO SHRIMP DUMPLING, and SHRIMP & PARSLEY DUMPLINGS. All served hot and fresh, so delicious... ordered 3 of each! 

FOR HIM: He ordered the BEEF & BROCCOLI with WHITE RICE. As a Chinese food fanatic, he was very impressed! Very flavorful, fresh steamed broccoli (I don't even like broccoli and I liked it!),  and extremely satisfying! He also was impressed with the dim sum as he could not get over how it was not coated in oil like we're used to at other places! 

They also have some very cool promotions going on while we were there. They had good priced catering options with free delivery, a Spring Value Box special (entree & side for only $4.88!) and the cutest Chinese dress accessory for wine bottles given with any $20.00 purchase! Oh, and check in on YELP & you get 20% off your next visit! 

Also have to add this is probably one of the cleanest places I've ever eaten at. Even the bathrooms! The decor is very cute & modern as well (especially the ceiling!)... and the customer service was amazing from start to finish. Devonne & Chung the cook were so nice! I feel like I can go on and on about this place honestly! My only qualm was that I got too full to try more of their dim sum selection -- which I will definitely be back to try! :)",cQrnxjgVBhjAcOJttw48aw,6,5,5,vtk2epShx3ZQIZE7VqiVCw

1673265,2016-06-15,9,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"As we walked in, we were told they were out of pork and beef. Not a great start to our visit. Then we got the sticker shock- a plate with two entrees and a large side (similar to what you'd get at Panda Express) will run you $13 without a drink. Was the quality worth it? Debatable.

Pacific Garlic Prawns: they're shrimp not prawns, good flavors, but sauce was thin and watery 
Mandarin Chicken: BF said texture was rubbery, I found the sauce too sweet
Broccoli & Beef: Guess it was the last of their beef?, average
Teriyaki chicken: better than expected
Sides: fried rice and long life noodles were okay,  less greasy than similar spots. 
Dim sum: shrimp ball was bland, parsley-shrimp dumpling tasted good but the skin stuck to the serving dish and fell apart.
Drinks: They have smoothies for $7 with additional chia seed, protein, etc for +$1 add-on. Strawberry-peach flavor recommended by the cashier was refreshing. Fountain beverages use the Coke Freestyle machine.

Service was polite, but extremely slow. Despite the cafeteria-style setup, food is made to order, which is good but takes longer than expected for this type of restaurant. My noodles came out after my guy was completely done eating his meal.

TIPS: Join their mailing list for various offers. They currently offer 20% off coupons for your next visit if you check in on Yelp.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,8,2,M4HNdx2YJy5ET86N5sI5sA

The thing that i noticed about their place is that it is similar to Panda Express, the difference is they don't have their food out. Everything is cooked fresh when you order it. So you have to wait for 15mins which is why i gave them 4 stars since i don't like waiting. I ordered beef broccoli which was $4.88, that's the smallest box where i got a side and one entree. The food was good and tasty. The beef was soft. I looked up the reviews at yelp and saw that they have shui mai, and i remember my boyfriend wants those so i ordered some for to go which she said would take 10-12mins. The lady told me that she only have 2 shumai left which sucks. The lady was very helpful. I only saw 2 workers in the restaurant.

I came for dimsum and they only have shrimp shumai and steamed pork bun left. They dont have bottled water...they were out of the shrimp on their list of entrees.

I had a couple in front of me and while they were ordering they were debating what they wanted and the cashier told them that one of the items they were thinking about was ""nasty"".

It was a Saturday around noon and the place was empty, we were the only customers. When my wife and I got our orders the portions were tiny, they put them in those little sectioned off plates,  and the rice side was huge, the entrees  were about 1.5'x 1.5' and about .25' deep. Not a lot of food for 12 bucks (for one order) I  am a vegetarian and I had a vegetable dish, the only vegetables in it were snap peas and tiny cut up pieces of green zucchini, Nothing else no carrots, broccoli, water chestnuts, yellow zucchini and some gross liquids all over it. I think it must have been boiled and not steamed. The tofu dish tasted disgusting and looked that way too. they did provide a lot of rice which was the only decent thing on the plate. Oh for being a healthy place? no low sodium soy sauce-not too healthy!  My wife isnt a vegitarian and orderd a shrimp dish, and a chicken dish. She didn't know she ordered fake shrimp (which they charged me an additional charge for as it was real shrimp). It was disgusting- she threw it out. That's when she wanted our money back, they gave me 11 bucks back and a receipt showing they gave me 27 bucks back (the cost of both meals) I just wanted out of there! lunch was ruined.

So excited when driving down Charleston and I see a restaurant advertising Dim Sum. So excited after passing it I made a U-turn to check it out. Appearing nice and clean, I entered during the lunch hour and only two other people were there. 
I walked up to the counter to place my order. I first asked for Chicken Shu Mai, I was told they were out. Then I asked about the Steamed Buns. I was told they were out of anything that had chicken. So I asked for the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns. The cashier went around to the kitchen, came back and said they were out of those too. Finally I said, what do you have? and proceeded to order. I had the Pork Soup Dumplings, Shrimp Shu Mai and Fried Shrimp Ball. By the way, they have no vegetable dim sum. I was told it would take about 15 minutes. That's time to get the frozen product out, thaw, steam and or fry. The food was ok.  I most likely could have gotten the same items at Costco and cooked it myself at home. Behind the counter, there are empty steamers. I'm guessing when they first opened they cooked a lot of food that unfortunately went unsold, so now they cook to order. I may try again, just to see how there entrees taste. They appeared to be freshly prepared and I did see some vegetables in one order.",Zb2T6JhcBGzgc6RWmldbDg,0,0,2,zOZYRchzLh6c75CHLY2VNw

Whelp, I hate to leave a bad review, but this situation left me with no choice. The food here is left out too long, to the point of becoming inedible. I ordered the walnut shrimp, but the girl mistakenly gave me garlic shrimp. When I sat down and noticed I had the wrong shrimp. I thought give it back, as I glanced down I noticed the sauce was gelatinous, I almost ralphed upon looking at it. I was like ""This isn't the right shrimp, need to say something!"" I go up get the walnut shrimp and it was the same issue; it was slimy seafood. 

Needless to say, we did not finish are food, only ate a few of the noodles. I hope this place wises up and starts putting out fresh food because there is nothing more disappointing than getting bad food.",rypcWiSNGM0suWsiSLh9xA,3,4,2,o7FNy5FK3-G_oiaNo1WU-w

There was one person there (besides the 2 employees working), and he didn't appear to even be ""dining"", just on his computer the entire time.  So we walk in, and there's many little covered tin dishes with labels, as if insinuating that those items were hiding under the lids waiting to be served up.

Moving onto Weird exhibit B, we look above at the wall mounted menu and tell the girl what we would like to order.  And everything is made to order.  So..... it's a dim sum place, but made to order.

But it wasn't awful... the mixed vegetables were no better than Panda Express, actually they weren't even that good.  And the teriyaki chicken sucked!

I felt immensely welcome waking in, save for the usual awkwardness of coming into a (personally) new restaurant. The overall layout mimics a basic Panda Express, and the food itself looked somewhat old. This could be due to their lack of consistent clientele, considering that they are fairly new. I'd like to say that the food would have probably been fresh had we come at a busy hour. The food itself was both delicious and disappointing. The sweet and sour shrimp dish was my main concern. I should have sampled it beforehand; the texture was a bit off. 

However, their tofu and chicken dishes were excellent. Specifically the tofu. It made up for the inconsistencies of the shrimp. The Dim Sum was tasty, but again, probably sat out for a little longer than comfortable. The textures were great, flavor was there, and appearance was on point. 

The young lady at the front was patient with us and absolutely wonderful. A very great personality who jumped at the chance to assist us. Overall, the service was excellent.

4072773,2017-01-03,0,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"I have been here a few times.  Now the bad part is this particular unit. And shopping center, has the worst luck staying in business.  Every place that faces the street has good luck in this shopping center but this particular unit was both a Smash Burger and a Mexican restaurant (I can't remember the name).  So they were set for struggles from the get go.  

This restaurant's biggest problem is identity.  They continuously try to identify what they are.    The menu board stays the same but how they represent the items change.  Sometimes it's a lot of food, or a little.  Prices are fluctuating   The lunches were big when they were 10-13  and became small when they developed a spring lunch special (that is still going on).

The food quality has ranged from freshly cooked and delicious sauces to rip off of Panda.  I still like it for that quick bite since I work across the street, but it's hard to predict what my food will look like and that is straying my business away over the past couple of months.

The identity crisis only increases when I see other locations in town that don't seem to struggle.  My suggestions, change the dim sum menu and face it towards the front entrance and find ways to make that be part of the special for the day.  If you get more focus on items 5 dollars or less, you will appeal more to the neighborhood we are in.  From there, advertise to CSN with food samples and flyers.",yIQZ6tcNsacLOyTbZJN6bQ,0,1,2,uizkRYxYC-FA6tq7OnsKGw

4540210,2015-12-19,3,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"I have to give this place 3 stars for right now.  We have been seeing commercials on TV about this place having Organic selections and natural items.  The commercials also advertise they are having their grand opening, so we decided to go support them as we LOVE organic and really wanted to try this place.

The day we went, Meagan was very helpful along with Karla the Manager.  Unfortunately last week was NOT their Grand Opening, it was a soft opening which means, they did not have anything organic or natural available as of yet.  Also, they only accepted cash, they could not accept credit or debit.

Everything was explained about the menu and the Dim Sum has a much larger selection then the other store.

So, wait about another week as they were not sure exactly when the Grand Opening would be or when they would have everything up and running and ready to go.  I am sure once this place gets up and running to full capacity it will be a 5 star place.  

As for now, the location was pretty easy to find, right across from the CSN Campus, it was clean, they will run out of seat once fully open at certain times throughout the day but that means they are having some great success. 

Give this place a try and give them support as there are NOT a lot of places in town that serve this style of food and go out of their way to use Organic and Natural ingredients.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,11,8,3,FQgZOLZQ91eIa6FFdtkAgA

4738646,2017-01-13,2,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"Introduction:
We were definitely reluctant in trying ChiAm out based on the reviews.  I must say that my friend and I were super glad we decided to try it out.  From the reviews, it appears to us that the owners must have made some adjustments since. For example, everything is now made to order. Which is awesome, pro-everything was so fresh.  Cons-you do have to wait, but totally worth it.

Quality: 5/5
We had the King Fried Riceu, Mongolian Beef and Florida Orange Chicken combo, probably one of the tastiest fried rice and Orange Chicken I've had in awhile. The Mongolian Beef was good too, but I've had better.

In addition, we had the Chicken Sui Mai, Chicken Dumpling, BBQ Pork Bun and Red Bean Bun. I must say, I was surprised how good they were as well. I love the fact that you can order any of those options without shrimps, usually, I have to remove my shrimps from other Dim Sum places and by the time I am done, I get exhausted.

Quantity & Price: 5/5
The portions were generous for the price.  $8.88 for three items is amazing. Two Dim Sum items from a portion of the Menu for $2.88 & three Dim Sum items from another Menu for $4.88 is definitely a killer deal.  

The one thing I must caution you on is that you need ro read the Menu's carefully. For example, if it reads two for $2.88, Mix and Match, that means if you want two of something, you have to let the cashier know. I was a dork, I completely missed that ""Mix and Match"" verbiage. But that was my bad, thank goodness I had enough to eat because of their combo portion generosity.

Cleanliness: 5/5
The place was super clean, including the restroom. The utensils, quality napkin and self serve drink areas were kept up and maintain immaculately.

Customer Service: 5/5
Claudia was amazing, super accommodating and very patience with us.  Because it's our first time, she answers all our questions with ease and did not appeared annoyed by us. Thank you Claudia! We appreciate that :)

Tips:
Check in on Yelp to get a 20% off. In addition, right now, you can get $20 for $12 from Groupon, that's what prompt us to try ChiAm out in the first place. It works, cause we're definitely going to be back.  I hope this place will be sticking around cause we really like it.",a69W0w2h-1Q_YpEebzwt7g,3,2,5,By3UW0pMSPsj1IcOMJuoOQ

I would needed astroglide if I paid full price. I bet this place tanks soon.  The pork dim sum tastes gamely and smells like a stockyard. The shrimp was watery.

5525118,2017-04-05,1,CztQkxRXch0__MsSmB0tTw,"I'm giving them 2 stars because of the soda fountain and the finalized customer service, not the start of the customer service tho.  They close at 8pm from what I overheard, and I arrived at 705pm to see everything clean and shiny, so I got excited about great food potential.  First time there, and couldn't quite figure out the menu and prices, but I saw what I wanted up there and was told, ""we're out of"" to the two items I really wanted.  So, then I ordered and was willing to pay extra for the shrimp options, only to be told; ""just so you know, when you order shrimp there is only 3 pieces""...so...scratch the shrimp option!  

Basically, for $11+ this dinner was a disappointment for something I could have gotten at PandaExpress and known exactly what I was getting.  She did try to redeem herself, between chat messages on her cellphone, by stating ""we make everything fresh to order here"" as she saw me start to ask a question.  That's great, happy to know it's going to be fresh!  And that I can say was true, the food was fresh!  I'm also going to add the food was not saturated in sugary or salt - and had decent flavor - but it begged something more - not sure what that ""more"" would be, but it was missing that ""ohhhh yeah, I'll be back"" factor.  

Then, call me picky, but I've never EVER been to any kind of Asian based food establishment that doesn't give a fortune cookie.  I was truly disappointed with that.  Kinda happy to see the cashier put down her phone long enough to check up on my food, and bring it to me personally rather than leave it on the counter.  Figured it was because I was the last customer of the day, or close to it.  I'll probably be back, because I really REALLY want to try their walnut shrimp or tiger shrimp but I can guarantee I won't go at the end of their business day again.",R_O9tbY8RgPybQ032xY1bw,1,1,2,QgSZ7ppPJDXt3mGFlLRGeA
