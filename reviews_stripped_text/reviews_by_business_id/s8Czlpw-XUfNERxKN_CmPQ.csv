806595,2012-06-25,0,s8Czlpw-XUfNERxKN_CmPQ,I was so hungry this morning at 8am. For some reason I was craving subway but from the lunch menu. I called and the woman was super nice over the phone and said Rey had both breakfast and lunch. When I came in she was super friendly and totally made me an awesome sub and saved my craving. Just wantto let management know she (morning person) is a great part of your staff. Thanks.,-V3YK80z7pqwkAn7bhbcLg,0,0,5,YLYW9nNtbw3Zs7LG_SGQSw
1086569,2013-10-03,0,s8Czlpw-XUfNERxKN_CmPQ,"My kids love Subway.  They are young and like the whole kids meal, including the nicer than usual bag it comes in.  One of them always gets a kids meatball sub, which is not officially a kids meal choice, but every other Subway is always happy to accommodate him.  But this is the first store that said that was ""not an option"" and left it at that, she didn't even say anything else.  After a few seconds of dead silence, I told her that he will take a 6"" meatball then.  It's not like I was asking for a premium item, meatball is one if the cheapest things on the menu.  It's even cheaper than some of the other kids options!

When it came around for the second kids meal, I told her just turkey and shredded cheese on the sandwich, nothing else.  She made the sandwich and put a pinch of cheese on it, which didn't even cover half of the meat.  I asked her for more cheese, and she informed me that it would be an additional charge.  I was in a ""whatever"" mood at this point, so I told her to do it.  

When it was time to bag up the order, only one kid was allowed to get the kids bag.  You would think that an upset kid would warrant a second bag, but nope. But at least she forgot to charge me for the extra cheese.

The lack of customer service will keep me from coming back to store.",YrlH8p-BIadJpE5cx2wYrg,3,0,2,HmWwVZmsuVMfX2mAt2NzVg

1633423,2017-08-04,0,s8Czlpw-XUfNERxKN_CmPQ,Ordered lunch online for our office today for lunch. The 2 salads had like zero lettuce...that's the cheapest indigent!! We requested no ham on the sandwich and guess what...there was ham!! We're sticking to port of subs from now on for company lunches!!!,AvDTVFP9eAidj9ha8VN-aw,0,0,1,CUTJq4uBgGcNet9RZQ5nTg

Subway tends to be a place I frequent when I want something filling, low in calories, and quick. 

My go to is a veggie delite with all the vegetables, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper, and oregano on 9 grain honey wheat. Maybe I have trained my taste buds to light nothing else. A part of me is not complaining because my sandwich is packed with fresh ingredients and contains so many kicking flavors. I will not be complaining because a footlong will only set me back $5.

My lunch for work. While they weren't super busy, they were somewhat busy. What got me was how unbelievable rude the employee was. Her name is Laurie and she was rude from start to finish. When I couldn't understand a question and asked
Her to repeat she literally rolled her eyes at me. Then when the gift card didn't work on the scan function, I handed it to her, and asked her to see if she could get it to work. She threw it away!!!!! My final straw was when she rolled her eyes again when I told her she needed to get it back. She even refused at first to give me her name.

Then I opened my chip back and I seemed to have gotten a defective one that had more crumb and seasoning than actual chips. Again, hella attitude and asked for the bad bag back just so she can throw it on the counter behind her and roll her eyes at me. Probably won't be coming back to this location again.
