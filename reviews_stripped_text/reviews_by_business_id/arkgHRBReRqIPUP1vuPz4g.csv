I used to get some stuff from them when they parked outside of Tenaya Creek a couple years back and haven't eaten there since because of the distance to the downtown location. 

We showed up and were starving so I got two arepas (ham and cheese and shredded beef + cheese) and a cheese empanada (I remember this from the food truck). My brother got himself a beef arepa with plantains, cheese, and beans. Everything was amazing! Super fresh and the accompanying salsa and cilantro mayo they give you took it to a whole different level. Yummmm.
Needless to say, I could only eat half of each arepa and split the empanada with my brother so he could taste the amazing-ness. I still have leftovers in the fridge and I cannot wait to eat them.
Most importantly, the service was incredible. So nice and attentive. I appreciate that very much. Can't wait to come back!",KbAshmF0iFNkk_6feVOXRQ,1,1,5,ePD9N3D8SAji4d5-ysQuIw

The menu is affordably priced, whether you get an arepa ($5-8) or opt for a  whole grilled chicken meal (~$20, feeds a family). 

I come for the arepas and there's one for every meal- the Perico is a favorite with a breakfast slant, filled with scrambled eggs, tomato, onion, and ham. Add on a squirt of salsa verde every few bites and it's amazing! My lunch picks are the Reina Pepiada (which is like a chicken salad with avocado and cilantro) or the shrimp salad (fresh, plentiful, cold, consider adding avocado). Though the stuffed hand-held pockets look small, they pack a pretty big portion. The black beans and fried yucca are good add-on options if you're a bottomless pit or have skipped a couple meals.

The same sweet older guy is always working when I stop in. He's always friendly and the food is out pretty quick. Check the posters by the register for off-menu specials, like wings (10/$8) and empanadas.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,20,4,zzyuoji552BEWtF1YZJycA

My family and I almost always order the same thing: Wood fired beef Arepas, beef empanadas, and the tostones. The flavor of the meat is on point and there's nothing like wood-fired meat! They also give you some squirt bottles of avocado-cream sauce and green salsa that compliment all the food there quite well. We sometimes order the Reina Arepa which is a chicken salad arepa that is unique and delicious! My mouth is watering just thinking about this food. For those who don't know what an Arepa is, well it may be compared to a Mexican gordita but it's much bigger, more filling, and the shell is lighter in color and much denser. One is good enough to fill you up, but I always order another one and split it. I forgot to take pictures when I was there because I get so excited about the food and then I forget.

When you walk in you can smell the burning wood and the place is clean and spacious with lots of seating.  
The man at the counter was very helpful, he let us know the popular items, let us know that the arepa looked tiny but they are very filling. Each arepa on the menu is around 5-7 bucks depending on what's inside it. You can add extra toppings like cheese, fried egg, and avocado for .50 - $1.00. 

We ordered one shredded chicken one beef with plantains and beans. Came out to around $12. Sure enough when we picked them up they were really hefty. Check out the photos! The arepa itself was nice and crunchy on the outside but was really soft and kind of crumbly on the inside. Overall had a great mouthful and paired perfectly with the well seasoned meat. It almost reminded me of a gigantic tamale but 10,000 times better. They also serve them with a side of green hot sauce and garlic cilantro mayo, both of which I recommend. 
They also give you a bunch of napkins, and you're going to need all of them because things get REALLY messy really quickly. Next time I might use a fork and knife just to help me tackle all of the meat. 

Thankful we were able to try this place and will definitely be back!",exrhmN7te3DWgay2m6fZBw,0,1,5,ZxWzfF7L8lxsCm3E5z0sDA
2685503,2017-06-28,0,arkgHRBReRqIPUP1vuPz4g,"Being from Miami of Venezuelan descent, arepas are near and dear to my heart and a favorite of my stomach. So I was happy to discover this, especially so close to my gym (good motivation to work out hard, lol!)

I have never seen such a layout of multilingual menus before (in Miami it's just spanish lol). Plus the staff was very nice and made ordering easy. I had the carne mechada arepa and empanada with queso. It was piping hot and very good. The sauces were also excellent, not too watery or too thick. 

My only gripe is that I'm used to queso guayanes on the arepa, which is a very thick cut, semisoft cheese that doesn't quite melt - giving an extra texture to the arepa. I'm not sure what type of cheese they used here, but it was thin and melted through. It was good, but I have never had it like that before. If they provided that (and perhaps I ordered wrong), this would be perfect.",XMN0nIXjW_wEyKQZCIyIYQ,0,1,4,wSdr88TISuZCY2seSyK5Rw

The roasted pork butt arepa would have benefitted from more seasoning, but the combination of the tender pork and tomato slices still made it worth getting.

I think the half chicken dinner is a couple dollars too cheap. We were the last customers tonight and even the last bird they served today was top notch. 

The garlic cilantro mayo sauce is wonderful, especially when mixed with the hot sauce or the ketchup. Seriously. If you have fries, mix a bit with the ketchup. 

The facility is sharp and they're connected to the banquet hall next door. It should seat up to 200 when it opens in December. 

The drink selection includes Venezuelan sodas and some fresh drinks including a sugar cane juice and lime concoction.

We're talking arepas and this new location on Rainbow continues to deliver, matching the quality of the LV Blvd location with even friendlier service.

Essentially a reconstituted milled sweet corn fried bread (masarepa flour, salt, water), split then stuffed with everything from wood fire grilled, well seasoned beef to a roasted pulled pork, to tender black beans and melting cheese.  All three by the way are very good.  Adding optional additional cheese, avocado, and squirts of their Venezuelan style salsa further kicks up the flavor.

Top props to the arepa pabellon, a right fine combo of the grilled beef, black beans, fried plantains, and cheese.

An order of fried tostones (pressed, fried  plantains) or fried yucca makes a perfect, starchy side.

While they may look small, don't be fooled, these babies are dense and stuffed.

Very reasonably priced, around $5.50 - $8.00 with all the possible additions.

Simple and solid.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,20,19,4,5fgHfMnkr1mg0Bt6qfTmOw

The order was ready very quickly. The waiter was extremely polite. The Arepas were good. We specially loved the cachapas, which reminded us of an Indian corn bread dish. It was not too sweet but just enough sweet. We all shared it and enjoyed every bit of this dish. Highly recommend you to try it.
