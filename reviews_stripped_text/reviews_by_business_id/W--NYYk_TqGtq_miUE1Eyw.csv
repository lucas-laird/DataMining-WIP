338404,2017-01-14,0,W--NYYk_TqGtq_miUE1Eyw,Beware of the caramel apples.  My GF had one and became very sick.  I called to complain and inquire about the food handling practices of this item only to be told we check the dates.  The apples are kept at room temperature and should be refrigerated.  We ended up spending our vacation in the ER with food poisoning with a bacteria Listeria from the Carmel Apple.  Our money was returned a couple of days later but the manager didn't seem to be to concerned about the apples when I asked about the dates and storage. The $10 refund will not cover our medical expenses and the fact that we could not enjoy our time in Vegas due to improper food handling practices.,8we3SB1P-7BLRHIy4ne9Uw,1,0,1,KWbcqOOX-NfQdB9j5hxFpA

Choose from giant pretzels, or the more convenient ""pretzel sticks"". They're greasy-butttery, super-soft and covered in salt. Then choose your dipping sauce - everything from sweet to salty. I chose the CHEESE, of course.

I've been to a bunch of mall pretzel stands and they can be really good if they're fresh, which is usually touch and go, but no matter how fresh they are I always have a bitter aftertaste (I think it's from the burnt 'butter' they use). I didn't experience any of the strange aftertaste with these pretzels.

I ordered the cinnamon sugar sticks with icing as well as some wannabe almond flavor. It does not even compete with Auntie Anne's (and no I do not work at Auntie Anne's, lol). The pretzel was kept in a warmer however it did not taste fresh but tasted old and stale, as if it had been kept in the warmer for longer than the allowed time. The pretzel was flavorless even though it was covered in sugar. It could not mask the fact that the dough beneath was too dense with a disgusting texture.

After a few bites I could no longer convince myself that my taste buds were acting up and had to face the fact the thing was obnoxious and I could not eat it.
