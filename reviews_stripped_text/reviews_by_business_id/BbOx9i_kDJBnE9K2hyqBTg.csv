We ordered the Hawaiian bbq beef plate, large bento, fried noodles and a side of kim cheese along with 2 drinks. Total bill for two people, $30, which is decent, however.. beef was fatty and tasted reheated. Sauce on the spicy chicken in the bento plate was nothing short of sweet and sour sauce from a jar with added siracha- terrible. Kim cheese was NOT made from Napa cabbage, but instead regular green cabbage and pretty much resembled coleslaw with red chili flakes.. It may be a harsh review but honestly, if you're from Hawaii, like I am, especially Kahuku, you would know that the food that comes from that city is second to none. Don't claim to be a ""local"" establishment if you basically serve teriyaki sauce because that doesn't make your food ""local""...

167581,2015-10-14,0,BbOx9i_kDJBnE9K2hyqBTg,"The Good: 

Pork Katsu plate has HUGE portions
Roast Pork is one of the best I have had: fork tender and juicy!

The Bad:

Poke was OK for a place that calls itself ""Kahuku Poke""
Lomi Salmon is OK but needs to be ""lomied"" and aged a day or two
Kim Chee needs to be fermented: as it is, it is like eating salted cabbage with some pepper kick.

The Ugly:

Pricing is high

Update 2-19-16

This place still remains a hit or miss proposition since my last review: I have sampled more selections.

Bento: how anyone could screw up a classic is beyond me: in my experience Bentos have always had a portion of beef, pork, chicken and fish on a bead of rice. The rice would be sprinkled with furikaki and a side of tsukimono on top. Sometimes a side of mac salad was offered.

Chicken in the Bento from Kahuku Poke was deep fried battered balls with a heavy garlic and spice flavor: not traditional or my cup of tea. Hot dogs sat in for the traditional Spam for the pork portion: that was OK but a larger portion is required for the price. No furikaki: Now that is blasphemy.  It was nice to see takuan on the side: but again this was ""manini"" sized: too small of a portion for this Hawaiian.

Listen up Kahuku Poke: us Hawaiians don't mind paying a higher price for larger portions but this Bento was too stingy for the price: a resounding fail on this item.

Saimin was added and this was a HUGE hit for me: nothing especially outstanding, just basic goodness served up in a Hawaiian style portion.

Kahuku has seen it fit to add too much pepper in their brown gravy: this takes their EXCELENT Pork Katsu dish down a notch: stop with the spice overload: let me add that if I want to. THANK GOODNESS Kahuku Poke has kept the salt levels low: this is one of the redeeming features of this establishment.

The Hits:

Pork Katsu (BUT WATCH THAT PEPPER, KAHUKU)

Roast Pork

Saimin

The Misses:

 Bento Box

Kim Chee (seriously? Store bought would be an improvement)

Lomi  Salmon (I never thought I would say this: but less Salmon and more ""lomi"" get that salmon squished up then let it age overnight to let the flavors meld)

Poke Rice bowl (I don't care WHAT ANYONE SAYS: the poke is OK but not good enough to be sitting on rice)

The misses are getting greater than the hits: Kahuku is risking a star at this point: trying the chicken next.

Up Date 5-10-17
 The Barbeque Chicken is good: not great, not bad: just good and good enough to keep them at 4 stars. I also had the combo plate with chicken and pork Katsu and THAT was HUGE! Well worth the price if you are hungry (that alone might have got us to 5 stars but they remain at 4 stars [see below]).

Glad to announce that there is NO pepper in the brown gravy (as it should be)... but, on occasion there DO put some in: I give them a pass because they are new (the kitchen staff is in transition) and might not have the consistency of a more established restaurant. 

They have added desserts and I ordered a slice of ""Chantilly"" cake. There are others like guava and they are all pre-sliced and ready to go: the cashier assured me that the Chantilly cake was their best! For me, the cake was dry but the frosting was good: I give it only two stars. The cake might have gotten stale in the refrigerator and when a cake is pre-sliced, it loses moisture: I don't know what the issue was but I probably won't be ordering cake any time soon. They also have cream puffs which I might look at in the future.

I had a craving for some Katsu recently and they were closed: they are now closed on Mondays: bummer.

250311,2015-08-06,0,BbOx9i_kDJBnE9K2hyqBTg,"I ordered 1/2pound of shoyu poke. They have the BEST poke. Made fresh to order.  Melts in your mouth like butter.  The taste was clean and not fishy nor slimy at all.  They add a little chili in there but you cant really taste it unless you eat the chili seed.  Better than any other poke place that I have tasted in town.  Going to try the limu next time.  


Ive been here more than once.  Tasted the kalbi/chicken combo.  It was alright.  Im thinking they could marinate it a little longer to really infuse the flavor.  Same with the shoyu chicken which was good but needed a little more ginger to get that real authentic hawaiian flair.  Also ordered spicy bbq chicken which also needed better marinating. 

Side dishes are decent. The cabbage kim chee lacks the acidity of real kim chee which was disappointing but still edible.  The mac salad has really improved since the first day they opened.  My bf really likes it and so do I. He compares it to that of Mikis in Hawaii.  

Their grand opening is this Saturday 8-8-15 and you get a free shirt with any purchase of $25 or more while supplies last.   Thats easy to do since poke is currently at $18.99/lb.",Se3CBbOO-hAekBi6KxpHug,2,1,4,DacKAyknnv_-066gEWha8g

803218,2017-05-28,0,BbOx9i_kDJBnE9K2hyqBTg,"Great ""home away from home"" food alternative! Being from Hawaii, and now living in the OC, I had to be sure I got my Hawaiian food fix when visiting Vegas. And this came pretty close!

The Customer Service: 5/5
The lady behind the counter was very polite and friendly. She took my order, addressed me by my name each time. She made sure I was taken care of through my time and wait there. She offered various sauces to try with my meal. That's going above and beyond!

The Food: 4/5
Here's what we ordered...
Meat Jun- was a little bland to my liking. The meat was lightly seasoned and the egg tasted like, well, egg (unseasoned, perhaps?). Unlike most places in Hawaii where the taste of meat jun is a little on the sweeter side, this one fell short. However, I did pour extra meat jun sauce all over it to get it to my liking. They offer two types of meat jun sauces, original and spicy. I liked both.
Mochiko Chicken- just like home! Had no complaints on this one. Highly recommend!
Shoyu Poke- melt in your mouth goodness! Pretty close to home, but there was something lacking. Maybe it was the shoyu used, as someone previously mentioned. Also, the price.. $18.99/lb. It's a little on the high side. But hey, can't get as good as this in the OC!
Chantilly Cake- don't forget about dessert! Can't seem to find Hawaiian chantilly anywhere in the mainland. Kinda wish it had more chantilly frosting, but that probably jus the fat kid in me talking..

The Restaurant: 4/5
Clean! You don't walk away smelling like the restaurant unlike most Hawaiian/Chinese restaurants. A lot of seating also. Kinda wish they had outdoor seating for those who like sitting outside. Also, ample parking! However, There is one parking stall right in the front of the store reserved for the manager only. Almost parked in his/her stall until I noticed the sign. I would recommend reserving ALL stalls fronting the store for your customers.

I was a little hesitant to try this place as the reviews were so so. When trying new places Kahuku never came to mind as it's vet hidden. Out of sight, out of mind. 

We had just gone to wellsfargo when babe said hey let's try Kahuku finally. Again I was hesitant, as there were no cars out front and it was that 1pm lunch time. 

Walking in the lady at the front greeted us with a friendly hello and asked if we needed any help ordering. We explained it was our first time there and needed a moment. Looking around I noticed it was very clean. Everything on the menu had pictures which I LOVE! I hate ordering somewhere new and not knowing what the food will look like. That's why I love yelp because I scan photos before I go in and order typically. Here it wasn't needed. 

We narrowed it down to the poke combo and the spicy pork combo. The lady explained that both combos came with rice, Mac salad and the entrees. I don't remember he priced individually but it totaled to $30 for two combos and two drinks. Not bad. The portions were huge. We asked for it to go. 

While we waited for the food we saw lots of cool things. Prices for extras. Desserts in the window that are homemade Hawaiian specialities. They even have prices for catering; small and large pans. 

Once at home we chowed down and I can tell you it was delicious. The spicy pork was tender and seasoned to perfection. It tasted saucy yet there was no sauce. So I will assume their marinated it for a long time before cooking it. Poke was yummy too. My fiancée makes poke a lot as he worked for a couple restaurants that made it and he loved it too. Said it tasted very authentic. The Mac salad was perfect. I just wished I had ordered extra!

Apparently it's owned by the same people who own Kahuku Superette located in, you guessed it, Kahuku on Oahu's North Shore. Kahuku Superette is known for some of the best poke on the island and I can definitely vouch for it. 

I can't say that this is the best local food I've had while living here in Vegas, but it wasn't terrible. My family and I came on a Saturday afternoon for lunch, which I guess is a bad time to come if you want poke because they had no spicy ahi left. There was only enough left to make the poke bowl that my sister had ordered. The poke is priced a little higher than other places I've been to in the valley, but it was good. I liked that the fish was cut into small pieces.

Meat Jun- It was just okay. The meat was thinly sliced, just how I like it. Pan fried in a traditional sweet egg wash. It definitely needs the sauce that it's served with. I'm disappointed that the rice wasn't sticky. It was rather dry. Mac salad made up for it though! Can't go wrong with mac salad, right?

Fried Noodles- The typical fried saimin noodles with chicken, fish cake, and a variety of veggies mixed in. I wasn't a fan. The dish was extremely bland and the chicken was completely dried out. It needed more than shoyu!

I also ordered a side of kimchi. Don't waste your dollar! The kimchi didn't even look fermented and it lacked that tangy flavor.

If you have room for dessert, I would recommend the guava cake. I don't think it's made in-house and it was a little on the dry side, but it was good and satisfied my sweet tooth after a savory meal.

The menu is reasonably priced and the customer service is great! Overall, a decent place to fulfill your Hawaiian/local food cravings. Kanak attack for sure! If I come back, it'll definitely be to try the garlic shrimp.",CqeLXgQUpMZNbz4GwBz87w,8,9,3,1oxNfDDnNxsxqKr_qYlUNQ

Brought the food home. Same sauce used for poke was used as marinade for belly.  It was over cooked also came with one scoop of rice and bland macaroni salad, Kim chee, and pickled radish $13.95.
Meat Jun fell apart. Breading was just falling off same composed dish as Ahi. $9.95. Too little food for the money. Never saw any sign to make aware of the minimum purchase of Poke. Stupid to begin with. There is no try before you buy on that either. I got so many other places to go. Don't believe I'll ever come back here.

2698407,2015-09-05,4,BbOx9i_kDJBnE9K2hyqBTg,"Vegas strip prices at an off the strip location. Ouch.  A regular combo at this Hawaiian / poke establishment can set you back $15 a plate for two meats.   A more reasonable bento box option will still cost you $10.   

As far as the poke goes, there are better options here in Vegas.  I found their shoyu poke to be overly salty with a bit of a spicy kick by the chopped onions added.  What I didn't like about this place was the inability to sample the poke prior to purchasing.   I was told it had to be made to order but shouldn't you have at least samples to allow customers to try before they buy?  I expect the best especially at a price of $19 per pound.  Finishing the last piece of tuna did not leave me satisfied. 

The bento box we ordered included small portions of each of meat jun, kalbi short ribs, and bbq chicken.  The macaroni salad and kimchee accompanied the warm noodles to complete the meal.  

I could not care for their kimchee as it was dry and did not seem fresh at all.  The macaroni salad was average at best.  The meats were good but other places would give double the meat at that price.  

I have to deduct one star because the value is not here.  You simply aren't getting your money's worth. A second star because ordering is quite painful.  Their posted menu above had text literally using maybe 12 or 14 pt Times New Roman font.  It's really small to see even right in front of the counter.  My wife gave up trying to figure out the difference between #34, #35, and #36.  A 3rd star gone because the selection of poke was lacking.  Spicy tuna poke or shoyu poke.  Little options and average flavor.

Any times, I've ordered the fried noodles plate because it's my all time favorite dish. As consistent as the dish is, I found that sometimes the noodles are over cooked and a little burnt and the chicken over cooked and dry. The noodles come with nothing else so I do order a side of Mac salad. It comes in a tiny dipping sauce container which is fine by me as I need just a taste of it. And it is reasonably priced at $.85. 

It's an ordinary experience with Kahuku Poke which I am fine with as I tend to prefer an uneventful and quiet lunch before heading back to crazy amounts of work waiting for me at the office.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,0,0,3,Ff4ne9AT_z-Ff_UCHtnFQQ

Today, I was in this neighborhood so I did a quick Yelp search. I stumbled upon this review saying ""Their garlic shrimp tasted like ""Giovanni's shrimp truck"" in HI. OMG, I freaking love Giovanni's!!! I had to come here.

Garlic shrimp... YES!!!! Very close to what I had from Giovanni's. Strong garlic flavor and buttery sauce. A hint of lemon (very slight). Of course, I like Giovanni's better but their garlic shrimp made me satisfied. Now I don't miss Giovanni's as much as I did before. Thanks to Jade T. for the review!!

Salmon Poke... Thank God I got the poke sauce on the side. Their salmon poke was as good as Poke express. Very fresh and delicious!! But their sauce... Umm, I'm not a fan of their sauce at all. Did they put salt in soy sauce? Tasted very weird. I used my own soy sauce and it was so much better. Same price as Poke express but I would get salmon poke at Poke express because their special sauce that comes with salmon poke is delicious.

I was so excited to see that this was the real deal poke, just like I used to get back home.  The restaurant was decked out Hawaiian style, and the seats and tables were comfy.  The first day we tried this place I ordered the Limu Poke plate, a little pricey but still cheaper than a plane ticket home.  Kahuku Poke did not short this limu poke because it was exactly the same as I remembered growing up in Hawaii.  We loved this place so much we ended up coming everyday before we left.  Their saimin is the S&S brand, yep, hard to find in the bay.  The saimin, or most commonly known by the haoles as ramen, was authentic, it hit the spot especially after we had a night of too much drinking.  The staff there were very friendly, just like being back home, service with a smile.  My sisters had the Kalua Pork and Lau Lau plate and they loved it.  My sisters boyfriend had the Shoyu Poke plate and he loved it so much.  

I've tried many places around the Bay area that serves ""Hawaiian Style"" poke but you know something's wrong when the description of the poke included avocado!  What?  Who puts avocado in Hawaiian poke?  lol

Katsu was good, but I did not like their katsu sauce very much, but that's because I'm very used to the typical standard. Theirs is a bit different. The breading was good, and I enjoyed it. The BBQ chicken is a definite must. I liked it the most out of the three. 

Spicy pork was really off on flavor. I was expecting a korean standard spicy pork marinade but it was 1) not spicy at all 2) a different cut of meat than I expected 3) flavor had some sour vinegary taste that I was put off by, it just was not good. Definitely nothing like the spicy pork you'd expect at a korean restaurant. 

I let the cashier know, and thankfully she went out of her way to do a taste test. Too bad that they stopped making it spicy to cater to the ""American"" taste buds due to some complaints. ""American"" people complaining about something being spicy when it's called ""spicy pork."" Tickles my fancy. Either way, they seem to respond very well to their customer's comments, almost to a fault. There will always be someone that isn't going to be happy with the food. But I say bring back that spice level for the spicy pork. It's like Mc Donald's has warned you the coffee is HOT coffee. Well, I'd say people have been warned plenty if it says, ""spicy pork."" 

Now your combo plate will not come with kimchi because of some complaint that they were served kimchi that went ""bad."" And apparently a lot of people waste it and throw it out. What a bummer. It's super rare to eat ""spoiled"" kimchi because it's fermented. That's like saying I had ""spoiled"" pickles. Now how often does that happen?

The service was great, and the cashier was super nice. So yeah, didn't get that poke because the price was crazy for the small size.

Well basically everything you get here is good but just ask what type of fish they are using for the fish Katsu since it changes at times.

The poke though brings back the feels of beach days on the north shore of Oahu in Hawaii. The sauce is the same recipe as the Kahuku Superette in Hawaii. It's unique from all other poke shops which makes it really good.

Poke: first time here they had a limited menu and where out of spicy poke...even on the islands if you didn't get there island you weren't getting the good poke so people crying about them being out of poke is on them....if you are from the island you know you have to get there early to get the poke you want....the shoyu  poke was bomb better then I thought...today we tried the spicy poke and it was good, but I have had better.

The only reason why I would go here is because Kahuku is one of the few places that serve garlic shrimp just like in the North Shore. While it's not perfect, it fulfills my cravings for Giovanni's. There's hella garlic, maybe a little too much and a shitload of buttah.  Their shoyu poke is decent here too.

I came in after a lady did and they took her order and declared her as the last customer they will be serving. Initially when I came in I did hear one of the employee's sigh as if it was a burden to come in 15 minutes before closing. Then the other employee starts shaking her head saying, ""sorry we are closed."" I pulled out my phone and was like, ""closed at 8:15?!"" and they said it was their last call time. It's frustrating.

Apparently the owner of this joint is also the same owner of kahuku superette back on Oahu, the poke at kahuku superette is one of the best on the island. I just wish the spicy ahi was more fresh, but can't really complain much since we don't leave near an ocean. 

I don't know why a lot of people are complaining about the price. I think it's reasonable & you get what you pay for (in a good way). Most plate lunch places back home range about the same price. I also know that fresh Ahi is limited in Vegas so of course they would need to up the price. 

I ordered the Kalbi, BBQ chicken, shoyu poke, spicy ahi, and meat jun. They all tasted really good. Better than L&L in my opinion. They gave a generous amount of meat and 2 scoops of rice with Mac salad.
