10039,2016-10-11,0,0Hcks5q-DgJbDlmEWolx4A,My husband and I had my birthday  dinner here 10/10/16 and I must say the staff here were amazing. I enjoyed my dinner and also received a very nice card signed by the Bonefish crew. I'm sure it's what they do all the time but it just put that extra special touch to a wonderful evening. They even spelled my name right :-).  Thank you Bonefish for making my dinner special.,GkXk-RKxAqE5-oS7HXMhgQ,1,1,5,zLoXIcJK2ltanAdpAE3yiQ

65842,2014-12-10,0,0Hcks5q-DgJbDlmEWolx4A,"Our first visit to the Bone Fish Grill and unfortunately we left disappointed. Things started off fine, the restaurant is decorated nicely and the initial service seemed fine. One thing that was annoying right away was the music, it was loud and more of the type of music for a bar or burger place. One of my biggest complaints of restaurants in Las Vegas is how noisy most of then are. Im not sure i liked the paper table cloths either it seemed out of place. We ordered an ahi appetizer and it was good, maybe the best part of the meal. We ordered the prawns and scallops and the rib eye. while both dishes were ok but the presentation of the food on the plate just wasn't right. The seafood was covered in butter and the side of broccoli was to salty to eat. The rib eye was cooked perfectly but i thought the cut was somewhat on the cheaper end of the rib eye spectrum. Both dishes came with a side of spaghetti squash but it was not really cooked right and was not that enjoyable. The potatoes gratin was probably the best side we had. The service seem to fade after we had our dinner on the table, how your water glasses are handled is a good sign of how the management treats its customers, ours were rarely filled.  So we will probably not be back to the Bonefish. I will no doubt choose Flemming's next door, the price is higher but the experience is worth it, after all isn't that one of the reasons we go out to eat?",kJvAd90RooT2uMPIB-2bdw,1,0,2,XNgYTwpHpFc7b0OF_f4GWQ

However, skip the corn chowder - it has zero taste (I actually had to add salt to give it some flavor). Also, when I made my reservations online, and filled out the area of special occasion (i.e., specifically  stating it was my birthday), nothing special was offered nor said. Why bother to ask? I would go back for their ""Happy Hour"" (which is only on Weds) - otherwise, never again.",sT5liCUJoYoJUpsMpWNgJA,0,0,3,9vDkBXCg3zV5PyLnTBf8Jw

Arrived about 3:30PM looking for a late lunch. We were told that lunch stopped at 3:00PM and we would have to order from the dinner menu. Same food, different price. We were the only ones there, so it wasn't busy. In fact there were so many servers, moving around it was like a show. For a fishplace, it did not have Oysters, which is what I was looking for. Ordered the Fish and Chips, small portion and very greasy, if fact had an upset stomack later. The wedge salad was nice with lots of blue cheese. That I would order again. I doubt they will do well here. It is too pricey for what you get and I don't find the menu very much to my liking.",AX7O2fvKNZnyd3pzk1su4g,0,0,3,RbHVJaLvT1Y0XiQ-SSyFSg

After the salad course the plates were still in front of us as the entr√©e was being served. We had to clear our own dishes to make room for the incoming plates. The cutlery that was taken away was not replaced so I had no silverware to eat my food and the server disappeared.  Water glasses sat empty and the dishes piled up, what a mess!  We still had the appetizer dishes on the table when the dessert order was taken. I should also mention that this took place on a Sunday night so it was slow, can't blame it on being slammed!

The crab cakes weren't the best either. I almost got annoyed with them and couldn't finish. You almost feel like your not really eating crab. The corn chowder and lump crab soup also called have tasted better. The flavor just wasn't there. And save the best for last. Dessert! I ordered the key lime pie....which was also not memorable. Call my crazy but it almost tasted as if they put garlic in my key lime pie or some type of ingredient that just doesn't go with this dessert.

398719,2015-07-10,0,0Hcks5q-DgJbDlmEWolx4A,"This was my first time dining here. A friend of mine loves this place so I thought I would give it a try. We arrived pretty early at 5pm so there were a lot of open seats. Decided to just sit at the bar. The hostess that seated us seemed irritated to have to bring us a menu which I thought was odd because she wasn't doing anything.  I was hoping this wasn't how the rest of the dinner was a going to go. 
We started off with the bang bang shrimp which was very good. The complimentary bread was also delicious. We ordered a pair of their red sangria which tasted very good but I'm not sure exactly how much alcohol was in it. Then again it was only $6.00 so I guess I can't say much. By this time I was getting a little full so I decided to get the chicken Cobb salad. The chicken had no taste (no salt or pepper) and neither did the salad. I had to season it with some pepper myself and asked for a little more dressing. Would never order another salad from there again. My girlfriend had the bang bang tacos which she said was tasty. 
Overall, our food was pretty good. I think some of the items on the menu are a bit overpriced. Our server made up for the rude hostess. I'll probably try other restaurants in the area esp with all the new restaurants at summerlin mall before coming back here.",i6w0VfTvvvbPk6Rj2gsBdw,0,0,3,LPDZh3UeW7X-GqHjEl2izg

The hostess was very friendly as well as the entire staff. This was my girlfriend and I anniversary. I had asked if it was possible to have flowers delivered to the restaurant. The staff said absolutely and I was amazed that they had them waiting on the table when we were seated.  Sorry to all the other boyfriends and husbands there that night but the wait staff made me look awesome and my girlfriend broke out in tears for the romantic gesture. 

The restaurant was busy but it didn't slow down the anglers one bit. The place is clean and the is laid out perfectly. I dislike a place where the isles and tables are crowded and you get in and out of your seat easily.

The service is five star our angler went above in beyond in table side service. Other restaurants should take notes because this is how it's done. I would give 6 stars A+++++

The Food was awesome! As you've probably read that the bang bang shrimp is excellent! Everything was delicious beyond what I was expecting for seafood in the desert. They even gave my girlfriend a complimentary box of chocolates for our anniversary.

Ryan Rust (server trainer) was our server and he was great! Wasnt the typical here is out special jabber that i hardly listen to but was very brief about some suggestions and friendly. 

He suggested a pear martini and moscow mule which were fantastic. 

For appetizers, we order the Bang Bang Shrimp, super great to share for two. The shrimp was cooked perfectly over some lettuce - a nice pre-entree snack! 

Entrees were the Oscar Mahimahi and the shrimp scampi snapper (specials menu).

we generally don't visit the same restaurant twice unless we really liked it, Bonefish Grill will be on our list for returning customers, the credit goes to our server for making everything very enjoyable on our date night!

When our entrees arrived, we were all surprised that the servings  were really small.   The sirloin with crab was good, but nothing to rave about.   The Chilean sea bass was nicely grilled.   The fish and chips was a disappointment. The fish tasted as though the oil that it was fried in was old.  I ordered a cappuccino afterwards.   This took a while to come, and when it came, it was in a really small cup.  We asked the waiter if this was cappuccino, and he insisted that it was.   I sipped it, and it was really bitter.  Everyone at the table took a sip and we all agreed that this had to be espresso, not cappuccino.  I did not drink the espresso.

A supervisor  happened to walk by as this was happening, and said that what I had was definitely espresso.   She asked if I still wanted the cappuccino, and I said no, because it had taken so long for the order to arrive.   The waiter then had to fix our bill to take off the cappuccino charge, and this took more than half and hour to fix.   We could not understand why it took that long.

The shrimp was only lukewarm, appeared to have been slightly under-cooked and was drowning in the sauce.

Finally caught her attention to get the check, but unfortunately, she never did inquire about our satisfaction with the meal -- just asked if we wanted boxes to go, which we declined.  Honestly, since she saw we were done eating, with each of us having left 75% of what we'd been served, shouldn't she have asked whether everything was OK?  Granted, the kitchen was slammed that day because there was a group of about 20pp in the same room at the same time.

I can deal with a small portion of steak and a shrimp skewer with a small side for close to $30, I don't need a plate full of food to be worth it. That is ONLY if the food is good. The food was so bad I am on Yelp trying to save you a $100 dinner date night filled with the smallest drink I've ever had (though was good, mule). So, I'll break down why the food was so bad. It's steak, it was cooked right, but had no flavor. I mean no salt, pepper, just burn marks on the grill. Potatoes were bland, shrimp wasn't all that bad, because that had seasoning on them. The bread was better then my steak. I know what some might think, hey, don't go to a fish place and order a steak... Then don't have 6 variations of steak on the menu, and who doesnt like surf and turf.
Bottom line is if the food had taste I'd like this place. But it didn't.",hcew27vWHQJMqvACAg-xxg,2,0,2,2YlxnQI6fU0s9Ix3GtEHBg

The hostess was friendly and our server George was helpful. We were presented with a list of specials which included Swordfish and pumpkin ravioli. For appetizers we tried the Ahi Tuna Sashimi and the Bang Bang Shrimp. The tuna was good but not spectacular. The shrimp had a good flavor. Portions were pretty big for an appetizer. Would have been better if we shared one. I had the wedge salad which was okay, but again just an average salad. My hubby had a cup of corn chowder with lump crab meat which was tasty and a generous portion for a cup. I decided on ordering the swordfish but was told they were out of pumpkin ravioli. I was quite disappointed by this. It was early in the night to be out of something on your specials list. Poor management of inventory if you ask me. So I ordered it with the suggested mushroom ravioli. My hubby got the Chilean sea bass with mango salsa. Both of our entrees were disappointing. The mushroom ravioli was not tasty at all. Both fish dishes were flavorless. I was surprised that a place that specializes in seafood does not know how to infuse flavor into the fish. They merely just top it with stuff.

We had a shellfish allergy in our party and after making the server aware we ended up finding a shrimp in our appetizer that somehow mistakingly found its way onto the plate. This potentially life threatening mistake was treated very casually and without any apology. 

After that the food came and a member of our dining party was handed a hot pad to retrieve her plate as the server handed it to her, a very awkward and unprofessional way to be served your meal. 

All the waiters have iPads which takes away from the whole experience. Instead of being able to casually order no eye contact is made as they are too enthralled in ordering with the electronic device. 

As far as the food is concerned it is less than appetizing to say the least. The sea bass was raw in the inside and the fish tacos were small and thin pieces of fish absolutely buried in an overly sweet mango salsa. Encasing the tacos was a stale tortilla. 
The whole experience was utterly dismal.

Menu features a limited number of (mostly) healthy, fish-focused dishes, prices range from $13-ish for lunch items to averaging $30 for fish dinner entrees.

Started with a house salad with a pleasant citrus vinaigrette before the FISH AND CHIPS. Batter on the fish was a little bland, but the tartar sauce really complemented the fish- lemony, lots of herbs, good consistency. Fries were average. 
FIRE GRILLED RAINBOW TROUT was stellar- large portion, beautifully crisp skin, flavorful with a light lemon-butter, and served with sweet snap peas and French green beans. Fresh, healthy, flavorful.

Service was interesting... our server took quite a while to get out to us. Another employee helped us with drinks and bread but was unable to take our order when we were ready, insisting we wait for our elusive designated server.

The waitress told us coucous was being served ""in place"" of the seasonal vegetables - however, we did not expect to have mashed potatoes & coucous served as sides for the same seafood meal! We shared small salads - but, before we barely touched them, the entrees were served. I had them hold my entre until I finished my salad - & then waited at least 15 min to be served. We paid $4 extra for ""premium"" sides - 4 tiny overcooked asparagus spears per order!!! To be fair, I had Pecan-crusted Trout - which was very good; others had Mahi Mahi & Salmon - both were also good.

I live nearby and when I arrived my food was all ready to go. I also asked if I can have a their bread and gave me a fresh bread with the olive oil bread dip. The process was smooth, except they don't have a designated take out parking spot, that time it was really busy and I'm jusy saying this because my left knee was not cooperating that day, it hurts like hell. And when I asked if I could use their side exit they said no I can't!

All the take out food was really good, we ordered their famous bang bang shrimp---they set aside the sauce which I prefer to be mixed in while the shrimp is still hot so all the shrimp will be coated evenly instead of having the sauce on the side. Hubby tried their Rainbow trout with potato au gratin and bacon mac and cheese. I opted for their Angus burger and it was cooked the way I want it---medium rare and seasoned well.

My boss gave me a gift card for outback and my wife was the one that suggested Bonefish grill. I'm stupid I don't read gift cards there are a few restaurant we could have used the gift cards at. 
     I called and asked if I have to make reservations. The hostess was very nice and said no that I don't have to but it's always good to make a reservation. I chose not to and that was a mistake. I don't mind waiting and realized how great they are at making sure the people that do make reservations are not waiting. I have been to other places where reservations don't make much of a difference. The hostess was very engaging and while talking would pause to greet everyone that came in do her job and go right back to talking to us about the menu. It took around 45 mins to be seated (next time I'm making a reservation) and Cassie greeted us promptly. Was ready to answer any questions we might have. We ordered bang bang shrimp and half order of oysters. Both dishes were excellent. My son tried oysters for the first time and wanted more. The manager at one point came to the table and talked to us. My wife was gonna order another drink but couldn't figure it out. Sorry I don't remeber names well but she suggested the ocean trust tropic heat martini as did Cassie. The Manager told my wife to order it and if she didn't like it she would buy it. It was wonderful. She ordered another after that. The corn chowder with lump crab was fantastic. Like everyone else has said the bread with oil and pesto was very good. My wife and I ordered off the specials. My wife ordered a misoyaki Chilean sea bass and I went with the scallops my son ordered bang bang shrimp tacos. Everything was on point. The sea bass was on a bed of rice with mushrooms and spinach. One of the greatest things I've tried in a long time. The scallops I had were fantastic. They were on top of a corn risotto topped with a sauce and bacon. Forgot the sauce. Also had some zucchini on the side which was a great surprise. Didn't say anything about it on the specials menu. My son loved his tacos. After our meal we had dessert. Cassie suggested key lime pie or creme brulee. We went with the doughnuts. They are fresh made doughnut holes topped with cinnamon sugar served with sea salt caramel and chocolate. The caramel and chocolate came in a nice squeeze bottle. We all loved them. 
     I have to say it was a great experience. I really don't have anything bad to say about the place. Everyone was engaging and friendly. My wife took pictures of our food and I sent it to my family. My brother has to a lot of good restaurants around the country. He lives in LA and has never been to Bonefish Grill. He is looking forward to going on his next visit. Thank you everyone at Bonefish Grill on Charleston for a wonderful evening.",yA0J-CHx9_8sVXB9jtZlnw,0,0,5,VAInCpQPrmDoAsRZsY9PpQ

I have eaten here twice and have been disappointed both times. The first time we ordered the Sea Bass. It was expensive and the portion was tiny. The food server disappeared and forgot things we ordered and we had remind him to get our entire order. 

Went back last night and the service was horrible. Much worse! The food server couldn't understand that my friend wanted a vodka and tonic with a lime. It had to be repeated to him five times. And then the drinks were forgotten, so we had to ask another food server to get those to the table. When our food server went to take our order he said I don't have a pen, that is so unprofessional of me. So I gave him a spare pen from my purse to keep. I asked if we could order our Kobe burgers rare and medium rare and the food server said yes. A couple of us ordered hamburgers rare and they came out well done almost burnt. Then the manager was walking past the table, as our food server was gone for days at this point, and we asked him if we could get burgers done the way we ordered them. He took them back to the kitchen and new burgers w the old fries showed up approximately 15 minutes later, after our two friends had already eaten their food. The burgers that were ordered rare and medium rare came out medium but at this point we both wanted to eat. The waiter showed up eventually to drop off the check. One of our friends asked for dessert menu so he ran off to bring that back. She ordered a brownie which eventually came out. I put my credit card in the bill that he set down before we order dessert and of course he brought a new check with the brownie on it. No comps for all the trouble and nonsense, of course. At this point he explained to me that he had lost the pen that I had given him and I said no worries I have another pen in my purse. I will use that, but I'm not giving it to you. What a complete dingdong.

I tried a side new to me. It was a fried rice with crab meat. Wow! Scrumptious! Those dishes were worth the trip. However, my entr√©e was a fail. 
The rainbow trout on the menu used to be wild caught, so I expected it to still be wild caught and ordered it. DISAPPOINTING! The texture was dry and the taste just wasn't the same, lacking those omega 3 fats. They had tried serving the mango sauce I ordered for it plastered over the top to hide the difference, I guess, instead of serving it on the side as they used to, when they were proud of their product. The mango sauce also was spicier than before, to hide the tastelessness, I suppose, but I don't like spicy. I didn't notice it being any less expensive than before, but it was way less taste and texture, and less healthful, too.

Lobster served lukewarm and rice with no flavor and a cool crunch, as well, the cocktail menu seemed to have undergone an unfortunate and muddled revision.

2248951,2015-03-01,2,0Hcks5q-DgJbDlmEWolx4A,"Always wanted to check Bonefish Grill out since it open just never got around to it. I read some reviews (most part seem more positive then negative ones) and really like the logo/concept of the restaurant. It really has little bite of everything from Steaks, Seafood, and just good diversity throughout the menu. I like one section of the menu can choose the cooking option you want from healthy to standard fare. I went with the family so got see few different items on the menu for my first time. My first impression the entrance really stood out cause not that many restaurants that have the revolving door. It nice with the Bonefish Grill logo and kind feel like taking you on spin into another world or Bonefish Grill World. lol. The whole interior has very modern decor from the bar area to the dining room. The booth that are higher off the ground on one side then have middle area that more like high bar stool tables and then again more booths but lower then the other side. The waitstaff all wearing chef wears coat that was confusing at first impression. I work as cook. So I was like wow so the chef brings out all the food. Nice. Once sat down found out just the waitstaff uniform but one that could appreciate. The decor from all these different style selfs all decorated with different stuff really make for great atmosphere. They do have private dining room or private room that can rent out. 
 
The food.....Like mention went with my brother family so got try few appetizers and got see few dishes. We started with Steamed Edamame and Fried Calamari. The Steamed Edamame it tasted like they steamed it in some kind of tea. It was really good. It was steamed perfect once got into every edamame was nice hot, moist, and cooked right. It refreshing then your normal oil saut√© edamame. I can do both but always nice mix things up in life from time to time. The presentation must say LOVE it!!! Not only cause the bottom basket can put shell in. But feel like keeps it warmer longer with the bamboo steam baskets (or think dumplings that the basket they use). It also come with the seasoning but our waitress warn use can be overpowering and if want just put little bit or none on top. I felt like tasted great without it. The Fried Calamari. The thing that stood out for me not only was it well battered, crispy, moist, and the peanut dipping sauce was nice change instead of red sauce get at every italian restaurant. Also they add bell peppers added nice touch and different texture along with the calamari. Both appetizers would highly recommend.

My entree went with the Spicy Tuna Bowl. Not sure the best way to describe it then LOT of things going on and none of it collectively made much sense. Sometimes less can be better especially comes to presentation. Spicy Tuna Bow all over the place. The Seared Tuna enjoyed. It had nice even sear all around, cooked perfect, and tasted like sushi grade tuna. The passion fruit salsa was not very good. Usually the ratio of passion would be more then the peppers and onions. It was completely opposite. It was to citrus or vinegar based. The carrot salad whatever was exactly whatever had no flavor and no real purpose except fill up more space. The avocado must say was perfect ripe, nice green not bruises, and tasted fresh delicious. The jasmine rice was great. So for me the whole dish was mixed of emotions. I ordered side of truffle mac and cheese. I have to put it up there with some of the best truffle mac and cheese in Vegas. I loved the balance of truffle and cheese. Like the breadcrumb crust on top they finish the dish. The curly noodles instead of your normal macaroni noodle added nice touch. My brother ordered ride eye that looked great. Sister-in-law ordered one of the street tacos again looked great. They both enjoyed there meal. One of my nieces she ordered the Kobe burger. Dam that good looking burger!!! 

The service was excellent. Our server was fabulous the whole night. 

I was surprise thinking would be pretty pricey but it very reasonable. Not cheap but still less then strip prices and get high end feeling just looking at the interior decor. I can see myself coming back again try more of the menu",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,3,2,4,jKgVhPkOf7ICQAh3CVlu7A

Food was decent. Ceviche had iceberg lettuce in it that was chopped like a house salad. Small portion. I guess the ice bowl was cool. 

I got the Wild Mahi Mahi. It was very good. I opted out of sauce and went with the grilled lemon instead. 

Blackened Fish Tacos were also okay. 

Our server seemed drained and walked / talked like a zombie. She hurried us out by asking about a desert menu prior to us finishing our main dishes and brought us the check faster than she refilled our waters. We had plates that needed to be picked up on the table during dinner that she ignored until we personally stacked and placed the dirty plates on the edge of the table. 

At least act like you're enjoying your job. No small talk. Nothing more than the bare minimum. Thus should be a 2 star review but the Mahi Mahi was good.

I guess it draws customers because the prices are not too bad, but there are a whole lot of better restaurants for a seafood meal.  I started with the jumbo lump crab cakes; both the jumbo and the lump were sorely missing.  Small crumbly cakes with a ""remoulade"" sauce that (to me) tasted like bottled thousand island dressing.  I then had the halibut, which was a decent piece of fish.  I liked that you get a choice of sauce to go on it.  The two sides that came with it were really bad.  I had the potatoes au gratin and the sauteed spinach.  Both were poorly cooked and terribly over salted.  I asked my wife about her meal and she simply said ""I wouldn't come back here.""

The service was quick - in fact, a little too quick.  Like the food was pre-prepared and sitting under a heat lamp.  The main course arrived before we had finished out appetizers.  Their goal is clearly to get you in and out, post haste.  Despite that mistake, our server was generally helpful and attentive.  The ambiance wasn't too bad - maybe a little skimpy on decoration.

Now, my gripe with the service stems from the coupon we had. The coupon stated that we'd get EITHER the sliders or Mac and cheese bites for free. There were separate codes for the server to enter into the system depending on what we ordered. When we got our bill, the Mac and cheese bites were taken off. Only thing is that they can were the least expensive of the two options. I know it's only 3 bucks but c'mon!

Upon sitting down, was a bit disappointed to be told that this location does not actually honor the company-wide e-mails and they do not have these dishes or promotions that we have come in for. Even though we were told by a manager, they are know to be ""wildly successful"" for the other locations. OK, there are other choices. Not the end of the world.

We both order entrees, starting with caesar salads.
And even though the Romain in the salad we super fresh and crunchy, our salads were actually completely flavorless, pre-manufactured croutons, barely any cheese. It was a dud.

Entrees - We both ordered a season special. Mine was great, my partner was mediocre. 

Key lime pie for dessert was delicious.

This is my exact challenge with Bonefish, which I was hoping would not be the case in this new location. It is frequently inconsistent and rarely amazing.

Our food took less than 10 minutes to arrive, which we were both appreciative over.

Now, I'm usually against blackened over deep fried fish tacos, BUT they were perfect. All of the elements of a great fish taco were represented: A touch of spice, a crunchy texture, and a fresh tortilla that holds up under the weight. 

Her fish and chips, although simple, were executed nicely. The breading wasn't overbearing and the cod was flaky and fresh.

The roughy was supposed to come with crab meat on top, and although it did, the amount was comedically tiny. It was literally one tablespoon of crab. The fish itself was cooked well. It was crusted with something and fried, which I didn't realize when I ordered it but it was still fine. It came with broccoli also, which was also fine. I dislike being served regular broccoli with my meal when the price tag for the entree is over $23. It's like, really, you guys can't get some broccolini up in here? The cous cous was flavorless.

She's well spoken, knowledgeable, and has a good sense of humor. We found out she's a corporate training which explains her extreme level of professionalism and ability to navigate the menu. Two of us ordered off the specials menu. My dad ordered bacon butter Norwegian salmon ($25) and I ordered diver scallops ($29). Both were perfect. My boyfriend ordered the salmon of the simply grilled menu with pesto.($20) Also, perfect. 

I have to say, this experience surpassed even some of the most fine dining restaurants we've been to. It's was quiet, professional, and comfortable. For the atmosphere and food offered, it was reasonable in cost as well.

The dish came with a broken hollandaise sauce, brown avocado, and eggs over poached. To be fair, they were able to put an English muffin in the toaster and toast it, but otherwise, they failed in every aspect of the meal. 

If you're a chef and your emulsion breaks, you can start a fresh batch or try to re-emulsify the sauce. But what you cannot do, if you have any standards, is simply pour a broken chunky sauce over the dish and send it out. Because the assumption is either I am too stupid to know what you are doing or you just couldn't care less about what you serve to your customers. 

For twenty dollars for a meal, you damn well better make a hollandaise sauce right and if you can't, an apology and correction better be forthcoming.",Nfk4PTQTFSbeT8d90IXiJw,3,0,1,zDiLZIUqTagjxpJEjWAo6A

You don't feel like you are getting a good value, and not just because it's high-priced. I like high priced! But you want to feel like it's special.  Often, the fish feels like it's okay, not super well prepared, or super fresh. The service is nothing to write home about.  (But the hostesses are quite sweet and are good about greeting you when you come and go).  The decor is nice, perhaps a bit too simple.  Though I am a fan of the silver fish on the wood plank wall! There just seems to be no passion in the food--a lobster tail is just a lobster tail.  A salmon is just a salmon here.  And shrimp is just, well...shrimp.  No attempt is made to elevate these ingredients, or to bring out their ""wild"" sides, or even like, Eric Ripert (Le Bernardin, New York, a fish genius), to make the fish seem like it's the star of every plate.

 The coconut shrimp is not as flavorful as in previous years.  The mussels are consistently off-flavored now (my friend even complained on a separate occasion that most of the shells were empty!).

Two bites and I knew it did not look and taste like Salmon.  I confirmed with my guests as to whether I said one thing and meant another and they all confirmed that I had indeed ordered the Rockfish dinner special.

I am lost for words. 
But I thought its my duty to let everyone know and help save time and money and perhaps a life.
This was my first time going to this resturant  and it will be the last.
Service was horrible, food is not that far from the service. We had so many ppl coming to our table and going (serving or cleaning plates) that we couldn't tell who was our server. 
For starter we ordered calamari and took forever to take our order; it must be the i pad (tip- get rid of it, use pen and paper).
One of our friends dining with us had shellfish allergy, after making sure our server  keenly aware, we found a few shrimp mixed in with our appetizer. This is bad practice. What began as a casual dinner with friends  quickly became a situaion that could've ended up in the ER. Thank goodnes she noticed, but what if it had been a child, we would all be reading a differnt review...
When we notifed the shrimp in our calamari we made the server aware, she didn't even appologize she just said ""thats how it is!"". WRONG!!  THAT IS NOT HOW IT IS.
The next day i called  to contact the manager, he wasn't available. Instead i was directed to the kitchen manager Mr. Joe. I explained to him what transpired, he offered me a gift card to shut me up; of which i refused. He then assured that they take food allergies very seriously, I was then told it was the responsibilty of the patron to accept the risk of possible contamination at this establishment. I guess it was my fault to eat at  fishbone grill. Lesson learned I will never be dining here again. Mr Joe this review is for you... 
Every 3 min a food allergy resulting in anaphalactic shock sends someone to the emergency room accross the country. 
I can see why because poeple, like those working in bonefish grill, could careless. Staff needs  to be educated about the serverety of these conditons.
I hope this review can help someone before they dine at Bonefish grill.

4302293,2018-02-04,1,0Hcks5q-DgJbDlmEWolx4A,"So, in going through the reviews from people who have dined here for birthdays, there seems to be a large discrepancy for what this restaurant actually does on birthdays... not good.  Any good business is consistent, if nothing else.

We went for my birthday and when my partner told the server, she kindly asked me what my name was.  I told her, thinking, ""Oh, they  might write my name in something/somewhere because it's my birthday.""  Haha.  Nope.

The food was alright.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't particularly good, either.  Unlike a lot of other yelpers, I actually didn't enjoy the Bang Bang Shrimp.  It tasted too much like mayonnaise glopped onto mini cocktail shrimps.

So, at the end of our meal, I'm expecting something for my birthday.  Especially in going through these reviews, I'm peeved that they selectively give out birthday cards?  Rude.

But, so anyway, then it comes... we died laughing.  Not even an appetizer dish, I don't know what it was, but it was a minuscule dish.  Strawberries.  Not big juicy strawberries.  Baby strawberries.  In... wait for it... ice cream?!  Nooooo.  That'd be too extravagant.  Four tiny globs of WHIPPED CREAM.  With cheapo Hershey's chocolate syrup drizzled over top.  

I mean, this restaurant isn't super pricey, but it's no Applebees or Red Lobster either.  Our bill was a good size for our party.  And THIS is what they/management/whomever decided to give people on their birthdays?!  Oh, and sometimes cards with coupons inside, but that's a hit or miss - too bad so sad?

Jillene is very bright, beautiful and motivated. She has a gift that if you could bottle it, it'd be worth millions! She was attentive but not overbearing, charming, polite and respectful. I have eaten at some of the worlds finest restaurants and never before have I met someone who was an absolute 10/10. She is the real deal!

4484549,2015-02-12,3,0Hcks5q-DgJbDlmEWolx4A,"I've been to several Bonefish outlets before my Yelp tenure, mainly on the east coast, have always enjoyed it, and never wrote a review.  This wasn't my usual Bonefish experience, but was one of those freebie seminars that we can't seem to resist when they're at a place we haven't yet been to. An hour of harangue for a free dinner.  Seems like a good trade-off to me, unless the dinner is a rubber chicken affair.  Fair to post this?  I think so, because the good was good, the bad bad, and what we had to choose from was identical to what's on the regular menu.

I didn't get to have the Bang Bang Shrimp, which has always been a favorite.  I think Bonefish started this craze, and the world copied them.  But I mention the crustaceans because I've never had a Bad Bonefish Bang Bang, and I suspect they'd be the same here.

The freshly-baked bread was excellent. I would love to have tried the olive oil/pesto dipping sauce.  But there was a sicko woman sitting across from me who, after moving my knife toward herself, then pushing it back to me (touching the blade), and then repeating that action, took command of the dipping sauce.  She'd dip her bread, then double and triple-dip again, in a Seinfeldian absurdist manner, until all the bread and the oil were gone.  Waitress brings new bread, new sauce, and it's Take 2.  Finally, I just asked for some butter and I hogged the whole wrapped pat.

I ordered a glass of their house red Sangria on my own tab.  It's made with cab, has a bit of blackberry syrup, and came adorned with two blackberries and a half slice of orange.  It was tasty, but in my book, a good Sangria has to be spiked with brandy or some other booze to give it a kick.  But at $6 a glass, I knew that wasn't happening.

The Caesar Salad was just ordinary.  I asked to go easy on the dressing, so the server brought it on the side, just fine with me.

The raison d'√™tre for my four stars, however, was the Grilled Salmon.  That was piscine PERFECTION, slightly undercooked, moist, tender, and absolutely, mouth-wateringly delicious.  A fairly large portion, about half and inch thick, and 24 hours later, in the middle of the night when I'm writing this, I am absolutely craving another hunk of that beautiful creation.  And, having foresworn all farmed or Atlantic salmon, I vow never to learn the provenance of Bonefish salmon, lest I have to avoid ordering it in the future.  It was THAT good, and the five stars for that raised the average rating.  But I'm also trying to put out of mind that past performance is no guarantee of future results.  My choice for topping was the mango salsa - good, but without a scintilla of the spice that the waitress said it would have.  The dish came with broccoli, undercooked in a strange way, and rice.  The people who ordered the filet mignon got asparagus, which looked a damn sight better, even to this broccoli-lover.

Dessert was a fudge-covered brownie with a dab of decent vanilla ice cream.  The brownie was very, very cocoa-y, and had a strange consistency, kinda like Passover cakes that are made with potato flour - a very esoteric reference, I know.  Sorry.  I'm not sure I liked it.  But after tasting it, I know I'd never order it.  Not that I ever order dessert.  Just sayin'.

I had a taste for seafood so we came here. We got in, and got seated in about 15 minutes.

The restaurant has a classy vibe to it. Low lighting which was nice for a romantic dinner.

I actually ended up ordering Lily's chicken instead of fish because it sounded sooo good!  (grilled chicken goat cheese, spinach, artichoke hearts, lemon basil sauce, fresh seasonal vegetable) My husband ordered fish and chips. I also ordered a winter cosmopolitan which was sensational along with a Caesar's Salad. My husband ordered Corn chowder with Lump crab. We also got some fresh bread with a pesto olive oil and it was sooooo delicious!!

The salad that I received was just ""ok"". I've had better Caesar's salad. The croutons needed some help as they were small, dry and lacked flavor. My husband's observation was that they use the leftover bread for the croutons. It seems like a good assumption. The dressing on the salad was somewhat flavorful, but not enough on the salad.. Also, there wasn't enough parm cheese, but the greens were fresh. My husband enjoyed his soup. Now the main courses were delicious...That chicken was divine...the goat cheese and artichokes made all of the rest of the flavors ""pop"". I tasted my hubby's fish and it had a nice flavor. You can tell that they used very fresh fish..not frozen.

The service was a bit slow...but still good. Cinnamon was our waitress and she was cheerful and very accommodating.  She even happily took a photo of my husband and I.

Shrimp filled with Lobster: you get four large shrimp filled with lobster and capers on top! Even Though there are only four, every bite of it is delish. -available only at the bar
Lobster eggs Benedict: available only at brunch
Western omelet available only at brunch
Tuna bowl: I enjoyed this dish as i'm always struggling to find healthy options. The tuna is very fresh and the price is pretty reasonable.
Bang bang tacos: cannot go wrong with bang bang
The burger: large with lots of flavor.

My mom, nephew, and I order the ahi sashimi, lobster roll, and the corn chowder to share. I was not expecting the ahi sashimi to be almost completely encrusted in sesame seeds. 

Let's start with the Ahi Sashimi. The size and flavor of the fish were great, big portion and fresh fish. Unfortunately for me, the amount of sesame seeds on the fish was a bit overkill. There was also a drizzle of this wasabi sauce on them that kind of killed it for me as well as I am not the biggest fan of wasabi. 

The lobster roll would have been great (for me) if there hadn't been a wasabi base. There was a heaping amount of lobster in the roll, the bread was toasted perfectly, but I just couldn't get over the hint of wasabi with each bite. 

The corn chowder was okay for me. The predominant flavor was just cream and did not have much taste to me.

The ambiance and plating were all beautiful. The food; however, was more expensive than what it was worth.",3-QoohSDMeL8-crDBvA8oA,3,2,3,ckC7T61yJzap-Q4b4dw-Wg

5227833,2017-08-17,2,0Hcks5q-DgJbDlmEWolx4A,"My mom and aunt first visited Bonefish Grill when they were on vacation a couple of years ago, I believe, in Georgia.  When they found out there was a Las Vegas location, they were thrilled, and have been raving about it ever since. 

Well, last night, we were celebrating a couple of pretty amazing health victories in my family, and my mom wanted to take us all out to dinner at Bonefish Grill.

We made a reservation,  and arrived about 15 minutes early.  We were greeted warmly, and told that our table was ready. 

Within minutes, we had bread with an herb olive oil dipping sauce.   Our server, Karissa (Carissa?) was lovely.  She explained the concept of the restaurant, and that all of their fish is fresh and inspected by management every day.  She joked with us throughout the night, and checked up on us frequently to make sure we had everything we needed.  

Service really makes or breaks a visit for me.  The food was wonderful, but it was the incredible service that we received from start to finish that impressed me.   Our server, the food runners, and we had an interaction with a manager that was so pleasant.  Seriously top notch service here.

Now, the food.  

Well, ok, let me back up to the drinks first!!
THEY HAVE A WATERMELON MARTINI.

Who doesn't love watermelon?  I was debating all day about the watermelon martini, and a nice malbec with dinner...but I ended up choosing the watermelon martini.  I can have wine any time I want.  
I am SO glad I chose this drink!!  Hand-muddled watermelon, house-infused English cucumber and Fris vodka infusion, fresh sour, garnished with frozen watermelon cubes, this was the PERFECT summer drink.  Light.  Refreshing.  Satisfying.  I had two. I'm making it my mission in life to try to recreate this at home since Bonefish is a little far for me to drive to every day.  

Happy hour is from 4-6:30, and offers great discounts on drinks.  

Ok, now the moment you've been waiting for:  The food. 

Appetizers:
Bang Bang Shrimp:  lightly breaded, covered in a spicy, amazing sauce, these shrimp were cooked to perfection, and SO good.  My mouth was on fire in the best way.  
Maryland crab cakes:  Delicious.  Lump crab meat in two yummy cakes with a red remoulade sauce:  Really really good.  The cakes weren't pretty, as they fell apart quite a bit, but the taste was great.  
Ahi tuna sashimi:  sesame crusted ahi tuna served with wasabi, sriracha, and pickled ginger:  in a word...YUM.  The tuna was seared to a perfect rare, and was absolutely delicious.  

Dinners:  
I had the special:  Cod picatta with LOBSTER STUFFED SHRIMP.  
This was lovely.  The cod was delicate, with an ever so light coating of breading and capers.  A light, delicious cut of fish.  The lobster stuffed shrimp...it was like a dream.  Decadent.  Delicious, and the shrimp were cooked PERFECTLY.  My favorite of the night.  

My husband had an 18 oz bone in rib-eye that was seasoned beautifully. It was a little on the rare side (ordered mid-rare), but was delicious.  His only complaint was that there really was an AWFUL lot of fat on the steak, but he was satisfied.  The bite I had was great.

My mom had the grilled sea bass.  I had debated ordering this myself.  She let me taste it, and it was absolutely wonderful.  I'll be ordering this next time for sure.  

Sides: 
White truffle mac n cheese:  this was good!  I'm a mac n cheese snob, so I had to try this, and it did not disappoint.  I was too full to eat more than a few bites, but we took it home so I can heat it up for dinner tonight!

Sauteed spinach:  the only major disappointment of the night for me.  The spinach was bland.  There was no seasoning at all.  Not a fan.  I'll probably opt for green beans next time instead. 

(I didn't try the other sides at the table, I was too full.)

All in all, this was an exceptional experience.  Impeccable service, delightful food, and wonderful, refreshing drinks made our celebration last night a little more savory.  I have every intention of returning to try out other dishes on the menu. 

Thank you so much to the great staff for providing us with such excellent service last night.  We will be back.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,6,2,4,Z7gCc6xzlSQ3O6bx61NAJA

Hubby's fav was the brunch burger added with avocado, patty was juicy, bun was buttered and toasted nicely, paired with house salad to reduce the guilt.  Always work!

Mom loved the fish taco with mango salsa, she loved the fish was grilled but not deep fried, juicy but not dry, paired with the mango salsa, a little bit on the sweet side which was perfect option for a savory and sweet choice. 

Since I'm eating for two, I had the bang bang shrimp benny and also the creme brulee french toaste.  lucky me!  Love the benny! bang bang shrimp was as good as always, I can never have enough of them!  However, the french toast was just ok, kinda a meh choice.

We waited for roughly 5 minutes, John was in a in depth conversation about Super Bowl, talking to the one customer in the building that was exiting.  He made no eye contact.

It was supposed to be a nice dinner for my mother but this place is horrible from beginning to end.  The greeter ignored me after I checked in but we were seated 10 minutes ahead of our reservation.  Our server was unknowledgeable about their menu and inattentive.  It took 10 minutes for her to bring out sweetener for the iced tea that we ordered and refills were nonexistent.  3 of our 4 orders were wrong.  We weren't informed of any specials and our table didn't receive bread like the other tables did.  Their side salad was a ""spring mix"" with vinaigrette dressing (dressing good/spring mix bad).  The tilapia was dry and the truffle mac and cheese ($6 upcharge because it's a premium side) was flavorless.  The bill was $140, which is normally reasonable (1 appetizer, 4 nonalcoholic beverages and 4 entrees).  However the quality/taste of the food and the service make it ""highway robbery.""  Even the drinks were disappointing.  How do you mess up lemonade and raspberry ice tea?  If you still decide to try this place after reading this review, just make sure to check that your plates and glasses are clean, as that was an issue also.

Side note:  I'm claustrophobic and they have a revolving door as their main door and just the mere sight of the darn things gets my anxiety level up.  They do have a regular door just a little ways from the main entrance that I was able to use.  This didn't effect the food or service rating but it was a negative towards their atmosphere, which was the only nice thing about this place.

My 1st visit was at their other location in town square about 2 years ago, & it was the worst experience ever that I swore I'd never give this place another chance! The only reason why I went the 2nd time was because they had sent me a buy 1 entree, get one free up to $25.
We get there @ 7:30 pm & the place was packed! I had to park at Flemings next door & got the last parking spot over there ...both lots were full.
We enter the restaurant & we were warmly greeted by the 2 hostesses & seated us right then. We waited about 10 min b4 our server came over to acknowledge us...now it's 7:40 pm. He walks up to r table & asks are you ready to order? I told him we needed a few min...he disappears again for 10 min & comes back @ 7:50 & takes r order. We ordered the bang bang shrimp for r app, which came out right away..I think by 8 pm. Those were delicious, but not worth the money! You get maybe 12 small shrimp for $11.50...$1 for each one?? Then our server Brant said he'd bring us out some hot bread , but came back 2 r table 2 say the bread was in the oven. We finally get r bread served at 8:30 pm & now have been sitting here an hour already...isn't the bread supposed to come out as soon as you get there?? Now I'm wondering where r food is cause we've been waiting 40 min on a MR Ribeye & my rare filet?? When I ask r server where's r food, he tells me there's 2 big parties on the other side of the restaurant & also that their computers went down earlier & that backed the kitchen up . I'm the customer...I don't want to hear all the excuses, I'm starving & want my food cause we've been waiting a very long time ! 5 min goes by & my son & i's eyes were on everyone coming out of the kitchen wondering if that's r food coming & I tell my son, I'm waiting 5 more min. If r food isn't here by then, were leaving...this is ridiculous ! The food comes out within that 5 min, & although the food was very tasty, it wasn't hot! The steak was room temp like it had been sitting on a plate for awhile...not like it just came off the grill! The only thing hot was the Au gratin potatoes!
I wasn't impressed w r server at all ...I had to always look around for him & had to wait for the extras I asked for & by the time I received them, I was almost done & didn't need it now !
The food was very tasty & delicious...just not hot, & service was very slow ! Don't go if your starving & hadn't eaten all day like I did, cause I almost walked out!
And lastly , r dinner plates were still on the table when we left...he never cleared r plates when he brought us r check! The tip I left him reflected on the service he gave us!
Management, you need to take a look at your staff & retrain...cause the service sucks at both locations both times I've tried you! And both times we got male servers...Aweful!
The ambiance of this place when you 1st walk in was a classy feel w the dark wood tables/booths, white linens on the tables & Dim lights & can't remember if there were candles on the tables. We didn't have 1 at r booth , but that would make a nice touch for that restaurant. They are a bit pricey to be in a neighborhood restaurant!

On the east wall is a huge piece of art in the shape of a fish made from some sort of metal (I think). I thought that was pretty cool. But my god is there a lot of wood. Feels like someone's grandmas house. 

The food here can be a bit on the pricey side. This would be one of those places to come to on special occasions, for me at least. 

I decided to get the spicy tuna bowl and my boyfriend got the rib eye steak with rice and fries. 
The steak was cooked perfectly and the jasmine rice was a bit mushy compared to what I like but still good. 
The spicy tuna bowl came with half an avocado, about 8 pieces (I think) of tuna with sesame seeds on it,  and wonton crisps on a bed of the same jasmine rice. I'm not a big fan of sesame seeds but it wasn't an overwhelming amount. The bowl was good but it wasn't something I was overly excited about. I could probably get a similar dish for a cheaper price somewhere else. 

All the servers there wore chef jackets which was interesting, I would probably sweat my ass off wearing one all day. 

I forgot our servers name, but the service was decent. We only saw her once when we first ordered, once when she checked up on us, and again when we wanted our check. Had to wait about 15 minutes after we finished eating before we even got our bill. I had asked a guy in a button up shirt (maybe a manager?), who took my boyfriends plate, for a to-go box and I never got it so I assumed he forgot about us. It seems there were other people that the employees would rather tend to - like the old, rich, white people. 

Our server came back with our bill a few minutes later and offered to get me a box..alright then lol. 

Overall the food was pretty good and the service was alright but I wouldn't recommend this place nor would I come back.",IPGCGImT5tsLWWpLbvmLZQ,1,0,3,av3mARdSgApEpUKZj22RCw

Our first experience about ten month's ago was disappointing but we gave it another shot. The food was tasty and the waiter was attentive. We were glad to meet the new manager which explained why the restaurant had improved. Three of us had fish and one of us had a steak. My haddock was ordered from the special menu so it had a sauce and artichokes. Our friend loved his fish and chips. The shrimp and scallops were tasty but the portion could have been larger. I love the sides at Bonefish. I had saut√©ed spinach with a hint of garlic. The mashed potatoes were just right. I tasted a green bean which was cooked in slightly too much oil. You can ask for it to be steamed. I personally would never order a steak in a seafood restaurant but I know that the same company owns Flemings next door. The hubby was satisfied with his steak which was a generous portion. My friend's raspberry martini was tart with a rim of sugar.

This is where I became very dissappointed with this place!

When the waiter came by to pick up my money, He says: "" Oh no change back"" That is the most arrogant statement a server can make to a customer.

If this review was solely on food, it would honestly be three stars. I don't know if it was just me and my taste buds that night, but, everything tasted ""meh""; the first bite out of everything tasted good, but then every bite after that tasted kind of mediocre. 

My family and I had dinner here and started with the Bang Bang Shrimp and Ahi Tuna Sashimi. The Bang Bang Shrimp is pretty okay, a good mix of flavors. The Ahi Tuna was okay as well. For our main courses we had Cold Water Lobster Tails and the Fontina Chop. The Lobster Tails were ok, every bite was as delicious as the last, contrary to the majority of my meal. However, the lobsters were plain with no seasoning or special flavoring; there are however, lemons and melted butter given on the side (along with a side of your choice: rice, mashed potatoes, etc.). When my Mother cooks Lobsters for dinner, she cooks them with a special sauce; making her lobsters extremely delicious with the seasoning and sauce being present through every bite. I'm mentioning this, due to the fact that, it may factor to why I see the lobsters as plain. Moving on, the Fontina Chop, was pretty good. Although, like I said, every bite after the first tasted mediocre to me.",pqv3nCFbcQLTqTB6yzGE8g,1,1,4,PaI9OxbOosZkPofLvNwiOg

We had the private dining area to ourselves, but we were a little disappointed to see the choices on the three-course prefix menu. The fish options were limited and all the entrees came with the same side option of cous cous salad, whether it made sense with the meal or not. 

I decided on the corn chowder to start, followed by the tilapia topped with artichoke heart, feta and a very sad cous cous salad. I don't particularly like tilapia, but given the other options, it seemed like the only way to go. The cous cous salad could not be salvaged. It was gummy and I wasn't the only one that was pushing it around their plate, pretending to eat it. The soup was just ok, but I heard the salad was overly garlicky and salty, so the soup was probably the best option. For dessert, I opted for the key lime pie. It was nothing special, like most things about the meal.
