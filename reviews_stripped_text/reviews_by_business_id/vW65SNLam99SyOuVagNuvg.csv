We tried the tasting menu, and besides getting the order wrong, (I can only think it was my husband's accent meeting the server's accent and causing a train wreck) the food just wasn't enjoyable. I got the tacos el carbon, but all I could taste was the tortilla. I didn't like the Sangria but my husband did, but the drinks were watered down. Worse, my husband ordered a second Sangria and the glass was double the size of the glasses we received the first go-round, when the drink was a part of a fixed price menu.

We came here with a semi large group - 8 people. We were seated within 15 minutes which was excellent. 

Then the waiting began. A  inattentive and somewhat condescending waiter took our orders after 40 minutes. My friend ordered a drink and when it came it was not up to par, and when she complained the waiter had the nerve to instruct her on what the drink was - as if she didnt know!

The food was actually great. The chips and salsa were excellent. The tortilla soup was awesome. 

Somewhat expensive IMO, especially for poor service. I am totally over spending a lot of $$ at restaurants that don't appreciate the business.",pQAUyBorkc1ZOxmV-uJ02w,1,0,3,ohLhVACMY6E9yO2Ah5iSsQ

We ordered our food and were able to watch one of the chefs make fresh guacamole at the table. We aren't huge guacamole fans so we didn't order it but I wish we did. The reason for the four stars instead of 5 is the rice wasn't flavorful and didn't taste like it was seasoned at all. Also, the beans tasted burnt and weren't very appetizing. And my soda was left empty for half the meal and he didn't offer to refill it until after I was done eating my meal.

Our table service was better, but not by much. We waited a long time to have our order taken, and the server didn't come to check on us more than twice.

The restaurant was beautiful! It had this modern Spanish style to it. Bright colors and once again those shiny objects that get me all the time! After a quick glance of the menu we decided this will do. During prime business hours we were able to get right in! Always a plus for me. 
The wait staff was very nice and I had myself a margarita. I don't enjoy margaritas to often, but I love them so much! However this margarita was more sour on the rocks then a margarita. Very disappointing. Next, on my slow spiral into Mexican sadness we were offered guacamole. Guac is free at the restaurant I work at, so silly me says sure! Little did I know I'd be paying top dollar for a mashed avocado with out flavor. You live, you learn. 
When our food came we were about ready to die from starvation. It took a little longer then I had anticipated. I was shocked! Not only did my cheese enchiladas look like two sad cheese logs in a pond of enchilada sauce, but all of our food looked so sad. I think they put it under the heat lamp way to long. 
The bill came and being the gentleman my friend is he paid. However I did sneak a peak and was amazed at how much the bill was for how dismal the product was. 
You might want to skip this place if at the MGM. You'll find better food at Chipolte. 
My experience here can be summed up in a quote from David Sedaris, ""The food was awful, and there was so little of it"".",7aiIlfpcQZG7ea10R5i4RQ,2,1,2,gj1ecjtjmPAc_DdCnZm7eA

Mrs Crash wanted real mexican; no franchise allowed...but who can really tell in this franchise driven country?

Walking through the MGM we came upon this shining gem.

Amazing interior, waterfall and live fish tanks more reminiscent of an upmarket japanese restaurant than mexican.

Beautiful decor aside, it is all about the taste and we were not disappointed at all.

Fantastic salsas and flavoured salts were served while we pondered the menu. All had a tremendous burst of freshness and light, not all to our taste, but all definitely worth trying.

We were not exactly starving, so decided to share 3 'appetisers' (plus we are getting used to USA serving sizes). 

The standout dish was the goat - slow cooked and juicy and tender. Served simply with some flat bread - tip: add a little of the table-side-made gaucamole to it for a taste sensation.

So much better than any franchise (Chili, or El Torito for example) - If you're in LV and fancy Mexican then this is the place to be!!!",JwpdLtSH1KrAdF6qBns0fA,0,0,5,YUP4dleQX5dyVsZZAFeTwA

Lord knows why, but my buddy and I each decided to buy a specialty fruit-fused drink then dumb it down for a pitcher.  Yeah, we got wasted.  The tequila was of a decent quality, but trust me: we paid for it.

The restaurant is expensive, and the bang for the buck was unimpressive.  Complimentary chips are a no-brainer for any Mexican restaurant worth its tortillas.  The three salsas were nice, especially the smokey chipotle.  But you may wish to bypass the intriguing flavored salts if your flip-flops have brought you to Margaritaville.

Same goes for the Veracruz Seafood Pot.  With visions of lobster, prawns, clams, tomato, garlic, spinach, and other yum, I picked this over the tacos al carbon.  Very soon, I wished otherwise.  Saline overload!

The table-side guacamole helped a bit.  But to be honest, the avacados were under-ripe.

I know I'm hard to please with this cuisine.  However, when one's learned from a Mexican and knows what fresh is, there's a high bar to reach.

My pet peeve: at a restaurant where the per person price is $40-$50, they charge extra for cheese ($2.50), lettuce ($1.50) and sour cream. We were asked about these sides for our tacos, without any notice that such basics cost extra.",GB3qwSzhx2d8DmDSImBWdg,0,0,4,vjJw2wvfJMVSWfdYjfZaMg

They do tableside guacamole which was pretty good. I expected a little more presentation however. If you aren't going to do that, just schlep it out from the kitchen like everything else. 

Carnitas were rather tasty but no real depth of flavor. For a ""signature dish"" my level of expectation was much higher. Churros! Get them!! Served warm with banana ice cream and caramel sauce. You don't want to miss these. Do like we did and stop in just for the churros. You'll thank me.

Compared to most of the restaurants in Vegas their prices weren't too high. But there's way too much great food in Vegas these days. I can't imagine this is Diego's A-game.",36e4qecVy_CcpnOS-EqAUw,0,0,2,DHexD39UCU4KIU94zRTzIA

It was on a Saturday night and around 11:30pm when the place really started picking up. The Dj was pretty good , he played a lot of variety that kept the people dancing. However it seemed like everyone was trying to pack into the area next to the bar, instead of spreading out throughout the rest the of the place. So it  was definitely elbow to elbow room mostly, like most clubs. 

The bar was very stocked. They also had a variety of drinks, even a numerous amount of different type of tequilas. The margaritas I had were very tasty and well proportioned. 

Overall it was a good atmosphere, the decor was nice, and the place seemed very alive. 

Like I said, I cannot contest to the food, but hopefully I will be able to one day. I am quite curious.",ufn1IPTJP7mRlmQP3a5dIQ,0,0,3,U0HuBFMxQRtot54D8dpeeQ

Me? I was looking for a tasty, relaxed place to have lunch in a casino. 

Key words: tasty, relaxed, lunch, casino.

I ordered the Chile Colorado and my friend ordered the tamales. We were both pleased enough. Would I return for another meal? Probably not. It's not Diego's fault. The food was fine. But it would not be worth a trip to the strip for a local. But if you are staying at the MGM, this place is great. And if you are partying at the MGM, this place is even better.

See what I mean about context? 

They probably deserve four stars based on my meal. Three things keep Diego from the the coveted four star approval: 

1) My friend was slightly less impressed with his meal than I   
2) They seemed crazy overwhelmed by a conference. Don't they get notice about these things? The wait staff remained professional (read composed), but the hostess was clearly frazzled. And why don't they open more of the dining area for a huge lunch rush? Oh well, I'm sure they have their reasons. Like I said, I won't be back, so I won't spend any time worrying about such things. 
3) The salsa was rather pedestrian 

In short: Everything was fine. I just need more...heart in my Mexican food if I'm going to travel to the strip and battle a crowd.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,5,2,3,nRRUJg96qDgbQSZLwYK9dA

Food: We came during happy hour so we were only allowed to choose from a mediocre 10ish item menu. No one was impressed, and two of our party got horrible food poisoning from the pork. Can you think of a worse vacation to get food poisioning? Bland, all of it.

Service: It took us over 20 minutes to get our check closed out. This was in the middle of the day with the bar half-full. Our waitress just disappeared for a solid 10 minutes. One of the busboys accidentally dumped salsa on me. A mistake, of course, but Diego isn't replacing those stained clothes.

We ended up here for a girls night out dinner. OMG, my food was awesome!!!!! The table side guac is to die for. I practically ate the whole thing and said forget about dinner. I had the pork tamale and it was yummy. It comes with a bit of mole sauce on top of it. Loved the rice! I would totally eat here again. Others at the table said they enjoyed their meals as well. 

The service was so-so. We never got a few things we asked for like straws, hot sauce, etc. There are a lot of different people waiting on you so it's not just your server. That made things a bit difficult when were trying to track down our server for the check. 

Price wise, it is not the cheapest thing on the strip nor is it the most expensive. My meal plus the guac was probably about $30ish. 

They do have menus outside the restaurant so you can view your options along with the pricing. I highly recommend checking it out.

Unluckily, we chose Diego last Thursday for my brother's pre-wedding dinner (there was no rehearsal, so technically, we can't call it a rehearsal dinner).

There were 10 of us, so we had a private room in the back, which was, frankly, the only nice thing about this meal.

After we were seated, the host asked if we'd like guacamole with our chips and salsa assortment (it came with a pico de gallo, a tomatillo salsa, and a hotter, chipolte-y salsa).  I figured there would be an extra charge - but not a $12 PER ORDER extra charge.  Ridiculous.  They made it fresh, right there at the table, but it was bland and tasted mostly like mayonnaise.  One order wasn't even enough for everyone to get a scoop- I think they used one lousy avocado for that $12 guac.

The meals were definitely overpriced for the quality and quantity provided.  The tamales were bland, the tacos were greasy, the flank steak was overcooked (I ordered it blue rare and it came out medium.  Not medium rare, not rare.  Ew.  I tried sending it back but they couldn't manage to get it even remotely pink the middle.  Disgusting).  About half the table had cold food when it was served (and I don't think the fish tacos were intended to be a chilled dish).

My mom's meal was comped because they gave her the entirely wrong dish but then a server never came back by our table so she never had a chance to point out the error.  So weak.

Nearly $300 for the 10 of us, with no cocktails and just a few beers (thanks to $24 worth of crappy guacamole).  So my vote?  Skip Diego and find somewhere with 1) actual Mexican food, 2) an oven and 3) portions that, if actually edible, will fill you up.",Y9TkkmXe8CfRhuw-vLMcoQ,1,0,1,-uBdzBQhkjieQdyWdu6hRQ

2206273,2011-02-10,3,vW65SNLam99SyOuVagNuvg,"This review pertains to their happy hour specials from Sunday-Thursday, 4-5:30pm.

The Skinny: great complimentary chips and salsa and pork tortas do not take away from the surprisingly bland guacamole and greasy carnitas tacos (3) Service: bar lounge service was good but not outstanding, (3) Value: overall, an order of tortas, 2 orders of tacos, guacamole and a dessert (not on the happy hour menu) ended up being $30 - which is expensive for the level of cuisine.

My hubby was really excited to try out their happy hour and their chocolate tres leches cake. Plus the stories of tableside guacamole through Yelpers really made this place on our must-try list.

We had 2 orders of tacos (carnitas and chicken mole), tortas, guacamole, and to top it all off, a slice of chocolate tres leches.

First the good news. Great complimentary chips with three salsa to sample - a salsa fresca, salsa verde, and a chipotle salsa. The pork tortas ($6)  were good - tender, marinated pork sandwiched in a slightly over toasted bun. The chicken mole tacos (2 tacos for $5) was well seasoned with a little Asian (?) flare to it. 

Okay, now the ugly. I have never had a blander guacamole ($3). During happy hour, they do not offer tableside guac... it's served directly to you so you can't adjust the flavourings. It tasted only of avocado and of little else. For three bucks, you can get a better tub of guacamole at a supermarket. Basically, don't waste your money.

The carnitas tacos (2 for $5) were rather disappointing. The meat was tough and underseasoned. Dry and greasy at the same time, the sprinkling of a watery radish salad did nothing to improve the situation.

The worst dish of the evening was the rather poor rendition of tres leches cake ($9). Tres leches cake ought to be an airy sponge cake soaking in a milky liquid - it is beautiful in its simplicity. However at Diego, the tres leches cake had an overly dry brownie consistency which made it difficult for the underlying liquid to saturate the cake. Add in some overly sweet do-dads (too sweet chocolate nibs, meringue, ice cream), the actual product had little to do with tres leches cake.

If I'd ever order from here, I'd get take out chips and salsa and eat it in the room. Somehow, I didn't even like their margaritas...how is it possible to screw up a margarita?? Idk... Anyways, we ordered the four course meal, and it wasn't terrible. It was...interesting. I could see how someone might think it tastes good, but it was just not for me.

We were expecting a very 5 star experience when it came to the food and we were surprised when the food came out just a few minutes after we ordered. Most everyone in our party thought the food was average, nothing to right home about. We have a restaurant near us called Frida Mexican Restaurant in Glendale,CA and there food is much much better. On the bright side I did order the Nachos and this seem to be the hit on the table So much so that everyone started munching away at my food 

So heres the deal for me, I am always looking for amazing Mexican Food, something above and beyond what I can expect living in Los Angeles. Diego was not it for me, Great looking place, Friendly Staff, with So-So Food.",uEQRySOwkYqJoqMNi6fjPA,0,0,3,cBQQ0K_b4H8NYMmsohL5mA
2264281,2013-02-24,0,vW65SNLam99SyOuVagNuvg,"Diego came recommended years ago by my boyfriend & his fam, so my friends and I ate there back in 2008 when I first went to Vegas.  I recall loving the guacamole and not being overly impressed with the entrees.  We also split a pitcher of margaritas between the 5 or 6 of us which made the hefty pitcher price worth the cost.

So this time, we decided to hit up Diego for their happy hour.  It was a very good experience in all.  You can only do happy hour at the bar/patio area which was fine and the price cut only affects drinks not food which would normally be a strike for me, but we had a huge breakfast so we only wanted little nibbles.

I can't remember our server's name but she was friendly and greeted us quickly with chips and salsa.  Their chips have a light seasoning which is zesty as is their slightly tangy but yummy salsa.  We each ordered a strawberry-pineapple margarita (only $5 for a drink in Vegas is almost unheard of) and those margies were super delicious!

We both knew we wanted guac (I love the use of sundried tomatoes) and our server listed all the things they put into the guac and asked for our spicy preference which is awesome.  As someone who works in the food industry, I know the pains of finding out someone at your table is allergic to something or can't have gluten and then they have to change the order because you didn't think to ask.  A+ for that server!  She brought the guac and even waited for us to taste it to make sure it was spicy enough for us.

My bf ordered chicken tamales which came with spanish rice and refried beans.  I ordered the ""Caesar"" salad.  The food came and the server had forgotten to keep the meat off my salad (I'm a vegetarian) and she was very apologetic.  Again, I'm fairly lenient with servers, having been one myself plenty of times so I understand the mistake of hitting the wrong button.

My salad was just ok and I was glad that I wasn't that hungry and had mostly filled up on guacamole, confirming my intuition to skip the entree.",ZNdSkQKyD6-FrThAzDMwTw,0,0,3,3xhRa6AbfjyV45xSG_0UsA

My bf and I had the tasting menu - which was very economical.  I had one of the best margaritas I've had that I didn't make myself.  He had a tasting of several mescals on the advice of our very knowledgeable waiter.

2318067,2012-07-19,2,vW65SNLam99SyOuVagNuvg,"Totally underrated. On the pricier side, but IMO totally worth it. You know you're in for a special Mexican meal when the complimentary chips w/3 salsas and 3 seasoning salts show up. And don't forget to ask for the secret 4th salsa which is an orange-yellow habanero-based salsa (different than the dark-brown Border Grill version which is awesome as well.) Packs a punch, and I can usually handle a lot spice.

Diego's Carne Asada is a huge boneless rib-eye, perfectly cooked and way more tender sliced up and put into corn tortillas than you think. You WILL be full when you leave here. 

I expected the massive tequila selection to be more expensive than it was. I was able to find a few great tequilas for under $10 each.

The Chicken Molé is incredible and doesn't taste 'chickeny'. The molé is as good as the best I've had. And like the Carne Asada, it's perfect for slicing into corn tortillas.

It is a relatively long walk from the parking valet - all the way through the casino and down the long hall. But you will appreciate the return trip - walking off your huge meal will feel necessary.

Probably my favorite 'fancy' Mexican in Vegas. Doesn't get much better than this in this category. I know, 'fancy' and 'Mexican food' are sort of oxymoronic, but if anybody can pull it off, Diego can. Delicious stuff.",W1AFbtC37Q1RzdrKS51NmQ,3,2,5,ixPbmMa2xUiKE8Taa8C_bA

While this is upscale Mexican food with an amazing and very large tequila menu, I have to urge you to order the Sangria... TDF (to die for)....I craved these every single day I was in town....Although Sangria seems like a very easy drink to make without screwing it up, I'm pretty particular about how it tastes. The Sangria at Diego was made with the perfectly-in my opinion- This is the perfect drink after laying in the sun all day. It's as refreshing as it gets. 

Of course the margaritas are amazing here with lots of various choices, including my favorite Skinny Margarita. So, these aren't to be missed either. 

Like others have said, the chips served with 3 salsas and 3 blended salts are awesome! I had these on more than 1 occasion...

We also ordered the grilled chicken salad and chicken enchilada suiza. Both were very good. The kids meal was actually a great deal at just 7.00 for beef taquitos with rice, beans and churro for dessert...They thought there meal was the best they've had in quite awhile when eating out..

Service was terrific and the ambience was very inviting...

Now, we stayed at the Signature at MGM, so Diego was very convenient and kid friendly. Had we not stayed here we may not have made a trip just to eat here. This is simply because there are just soooo many restaurants to try in Vegas that you can usually just stay at your own hotel and find great places check out...

If you are staying at Signature or MGM (or somewhere nearby), you should definitely check out Diego....",gcffkX68A0JfcO6JmN9F-A,0,0,5,UC-cuF9-10AORb9wel0NSQ

Diego is deceiving, it is much larger than it looks from the outside. I was feeling a bit under the weather thanks to no one else but myself from the night before... otherwise I would have ordered that tableside made guac. 
We had 3-4 waiters and it really was impressive service-wise. Everyone was very gracious and friendly. Apparently, the drinks were very good, I stuck with water and my glass was never left empty. 2 of us ordered the chicken enchiladas and one had a cheese enchilada. All amazing, I would return here if there were not 101865653 other great eateries in Vegas (no appies this time around but they do offer tortilla chips and salsas (3) once you order). I liked the rice on the plate a lot. The beans, I think you just have to like refried beans but they were good. The portion was decent. Authentic tasting to say the least. I love real corn tortillas!
I would have given 5 stars to Diego but I was a teeny bit put out that they did not offer shrimp enchiladas, my fave. No idea why that is but for sure next time I will try something else.
I think the salsas for the chips were the best I have ever had! Had some kick unlike Canadian restaurants that just do not seem to do Mexican right from what I have tasted. Sad but true.",is5vAvanYvmF-28i9no2LQ,0,0,4,38ceJ6CSR2TTADf8V-FSnw

2474100,2008-02-05,0,vW65SNLam99SyOuVagNuvg,"Paying a lot for Mexican food has never been something I thought I'd do.  However I've always wanted to try this place since it's in the MGM right at the Monorail entrance.  After my experience here, I wish I had tried this place sooner.

It's not exactly your traditional Mexican restaurant, as it adds some modern flair to it.  It does turn into a nightclub w/ a good variety of Latin beats and reggae-ton on Friday and Saturday Nights (starting at 11pm for you groovers).

Like most Mexican restaurants, they bring you a good sized basket of chips and a trio of salsa, (pico de gallo, green tomatillo, and habanero chile).  What was really eye popping to me and my taste buds was the addition of three salts to go along w/ the chip sand salsa.  What an enhancement of flavor!  The avocado chile salt was amazing as was the chile lime salt.  Quite a rush that didn't even have us rushing for a glass of water.

They make fresh guac table side and it' pretty darn good.  I usually like having fresh cut tomatoes in my guac, however they used sun-dried tomatoes and it gave it a rather smokey and slightly tangier flavor.  For a single avocado, it sure produced quite a bit of guac for two, however it still was inhaled rather quickly.

I went w/ their tasting menu which included four courses.  Two authentic  dishes, Pollo al horno Con Mole (Horny Chicken our waiter joked), and Cochinita Pobil.  The pollo was a super tender chicken thigh with chile de arbol sauce on it, marinated a various spices that I wish I could list.  The smokey and spice flavor was great.  The Cochinita was a pork tenderloin that tore apart like fresh carnitas.  It was a flavor rush of spices and slight amount of pork fat that just melted in my mouth.  The other two tasters were a fresh tuna ceviche and grilled jumbo prawns.  The prawns were spiced to perfecting, a little amount of heat, but not so much that over powered the other flavors.  The ceviche was one of the best I've had in a long time, a good mixture of fresh pico de gallo, freshly grilled tuna, lime, and muscles.  

The other dish shared was their surf and turf which consisted of a well seasoned fillet minon (good 8oz baseball cut) on top of a mixture of portabello and spinach, accompanied by two shrimp and lobster enchiladas.  The enchiladas fell short a bit of what i was expecting, but the steak was magnificent.

however, the two dishes that put a fiesta to my taste buds were the two sides i selected.  Designed to serve two, we got the fried plantains and the sweet corn w/ chile.  OMFG!!!!!  What a rush and burst of flavor.  The plantains took about two bites before you realized the true flavor they gave.  The sweet corn was topped off w/ a light sour cream and it just melted all the way to my stomach.  Pure ecstasy in a Latin food way.  I was tempted to take and order to go for a late night snack...yes it was that good.

What made our experience five stars was our waiter, Leo.  He was super friendly and the most attentive waiter I've had in a long time.  our cups were never below half-way down, salsas always full, fresh chips in an instant.  But what set him apart was how truly attentive he was.  our fillet was overdone from the medium rare we had requested, but it was OK, we didn't mind.  However after 3/4 of it was devoured, he noticed it was overcooked and w/o hesitation ordered us to stop and took it away from us, only to bring out a freshly done full sized fillet cooked to perfection.  Awesome, simply awesome.

Pricey for Mexican food for sure, but oh so worth it.  A great experience all the way around.  A full belly, and a food coma at no additional charge.",e03iPZLuSJ5_3LY4TOp2iQ,1,0,5,34T5q7srU0SCNYJbFF0GYQ
2476992,2009-11-26,0,vW65SNLam99SyOuVagNuvg,"3.5 stars.  I have been to Diego a few times since it opened, and I find the food to be above average and consistent.  The location is inside of the MGM Grand, and the setting is casual.  The only downside would be the price, which is an issue inside of almost any casino in Las Vegas.  It's Mexican food after all, which we all know is supposed to be cheap.

If you want to pay this price for 'gourmet' Mexican food, I would have to say that Lindo Michoacan is better.  However, you have to factor in the cab fare too and from this off-strip property, unless you have a car.

My favorite thing, and the most memorable, was the selection of salsas that they offer with your meal.  I remember liking all three on my first visit and a different set of 3 on my second visit.  They seem to have it down in this department.  The bar also has a great selection of drinks and tequilas.  I cannot recall the dishes we ordered (its been quite some time since my last visit) but everybody in our group was pleased.

The enchiladas were fine, but I've had better for a lot less moolah. However, I would definitely come back just for the guac!

Prices are comparative to other decent Vegas restaurants...so yes, overpriced, but no more overpriced than everything else.  Expect to spend at least 30 bucks.

Their food is good, portions perfect.  I had the steak tacos, which were more akin to steak fajitas, but they were good, so I didn't mind.   I had leftovers, which I enjoyed and needed the next day.  The green salsa - delicious...if it was a drink option I'd be all about it.

My only complaint is the lack of Margarita popsicles.  They are advertised everywhere and despite the cold, un-Vegas-like weather, a margarita popsicle sounded delicious.  Plus, you look a little less ridiculous walking with a popsicle instead of those yard-long plastic juices people have leashed around their necks.  Our waiter looked at us as though we had asked for some alien dish and then went to check on the popsicle status...none to be found, check back tomorrow.  And as everyone knows, the shelf-life for remembering to do something in Vegas is about five minutes...so unfortunately I missed out on the marg pops.

They were pretty busy so the kitchen was backed up when we went, but the waiter was honest and apologetic about it and we had a strong margarita and chips/assorted salsa to keep us company. 

The salad sounded pretty good but I went with the tortilla soup. It was pretty delicious, the kind of thing I wish I had a whole pot of in my fridge so that I could eat it for days! For my entree I chose the chilean seabass which looked absolutely gorgeous and tasted even better. It just might be the best piece of fish I ever had. It was just buttery and creamy and fabulous.

Let's do the good first: the service was really good, the ambience the same as I remembered (it's a kinda modern vibe), and there was nothing actually wrong with the food I had (salad to start, fish tacos as main, and a few Negro Modelo's to wash it down). They also bring chips and salsa out as part of the deal - and they're good! 

The bad: the food is.....ok. My salad suffered from that US tendency the sweeten everything up, so while the core ingredients were top notch, the overall salad was a little too much to handle in terms of its sweetness (the dressing). Reluctantly, I could only eat half of it.  After which my soft fish tacos arrived. These were the biggest disappointment. Why? Flavour (or should I say, flavor). There was none. Seriously. I ended up lumping some salsa and drizzling some lime juice from my chips'n'salsa on to the fish tacos to ""brighten them up"". 

Total bill for this (2 beers, starter salad and main tacos) was $49 before tip. So this is the reason I'm rating this a two star in the review. Meh indeed! At $30 all-in it would have been disappointing but kinda ok from value-for-money point of view. At $50 plus a $10 tip (service was good, so 20% seemed appropriate) it's a rip.

If you ask they will make you regular margaritas normal priced so you don't have to splurge for the $100 special one.

This is a very attractive place with bright red colors along the wall, furniture, and the reddish maghony floor. I dig the place's modern deco look with some flair and imagination for on how bright the color is for a simple Mexican Catina.

But oh, the price does not reflect the Mexican food at all. Muy expensive! I thought the food was very pricey even if it was a very upscale restaurant. Luckily I didn't cared that much because I was there more for the wedding and enjoying my time there. As long as the drinks were flowing, I was fine by it and not realizing how much every simple dish was being added to the tab.

I really don't know if there was any better option for a post wedding gathering, but for the proximity to the wedding chapel, this was the best and only solution at the time.

The service was good throughout our stay and they did do their best to accommodate 30 or so guest that was left from the wedding. 

If you are looking to enjoy fine dining in a classy elegant restaurant, this would be it. If you are looking for cheap drinks and quick food to enjoy a special occasion, then this might not be it.

For a different experience next time, I probably would enjoy it more and take it the experience. For that day, it was a big overkill and maybe a tad off for a simple meet up.",-Tj4e-zW67MXj9Z7-Zkzpw,3,4,3,1Q8b_1BXCVzEocbeOFUGeQ

The food is not bad, but also not enough to make up for the poor service. I had the Puerco Pibil, which is basically slow cooked pork shoulder. The pork was really tender--fork tender and juicy which was a good thing. However, the overall flavor of the pork was way too subtle, and I found myself having to supplement the dish with salsa from the chips and salsa. The pork was supposedly marinated in orange and banana leaves, but I tasted none of those things. Also the dish was under-salted. The best part of the meal was the fresh guacamole, which is made at the table side by a dedicated guacamole server (who knew there was such a thing). The guacamole was creamy, citrusy, and ripe with fresh flavors. 

The service we received was literally laughable. Just to be fair, the bad service may be unique to our particular server (one of the male servers)--the other servers seemed to be more attentive. When we initially were getting ready to place our food orders, our waiter abruptly said ""I'll be back,"" before I had a chance to ask a question about the menu and before the other members of my group were able to place their order. Then we did not see him again for quite a while. Every time our waiter left our table, we would not see him again for half an hour or so. On top of this, he never asked if we had any questions. At one point, the waiter had mentioned that he was getting off work at 11 and that we were his last table to serve. He definitely seemed more interested in being done with work and flirting with the girls at the restaurant (guys are people too!).  By the end of the night (it started off evening and was well into the night by the time we finished our meal due to painfully slow service), we were all laughing (I had tears in my eyes) about the service. It was almost like we were on an episode of candid camera or Punk'd, and someone was trying to see what it would take to get us really pissed off.

We couldn't get a table,and since we were jet lagging bad, we ate at the bar, which turned out to be beside a waterfall.

By the bottle, because I wasn't going to pay $45 for a shot....so I finally focused on a Pomegranite margarita with a float of Grand Marnier, since it matched the red walls and helped me blend into the Vegas aura.

A few dishes are made tableside, including a ceviche-esque shrimp cocktail (""-esque"" because it's only shrimp), and a guacamole that leaves one speechless.  

Our dinners were quite tasty.  There was a decent range catering to our party's varying preferences (salad, steak, tacos, etc.), though the menu wasn't intimidatingly long.  The waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating to our special requests.  

The sangria was pretty disappointing.  It wasn't fruity, or strong, or punchy, or any of the things that make you notice a sangria.  The margaritas, on the other hand, were fantastic.  If you want a pitcher of something for the table, go with margaritas.

Overall, if you're going to eat one meal in Las Vegas, I wouldn't send you here.  But if you're in or near the MGM and you're in the mood for high-end Mexican, I'd recommend Diego.  And get the guacamole.

Finally, everything you eat in a casino on the strip is expensive.  Either expect to routinely overpay for meals, good or bad, or plan to take a cab somewhere else to eat.",tYXmFkgbuUqtndYO48YHQA,1,0,4,WLQy3L9SJQuOMzPb45c1Bw

Its nexpensive in Vegas money. Its 1 bottle per 4 peeps. There was one small drawback about the bottle service...you pour your own stuff more often than you should. In addition, the tables are a bit removed from the dance floor.

The service was friendly, and they bring you chips and salsa right away, always a plus. The salsa was smoky and had some heat that sneaks up on you. 

Chicken empanadas for a starter; tasty, moist chicken on a bed of guacamole. Not a huge portion, so you may want to get multiple apps if you're really hungry. 

Chili Colorado and Pollo Mole for dinner, both were prepared and presented nicely, and no complaints about the flavors, but like everything on the menu they're things I can get just about anywhere. 

We shared a pitcher of sangria, which was excellent, and we skipped dessert. 

There aren't too many great Mexican places in Vegas, so it's a bit of a shame to see this place get right to edge of being great and not quite get there.

It's a little tricky to get to from the main entrance of the hotel (meaning it's a jaunt). The food is prepared well and the restaurant gives off a fun and trendy vibe. One major drawback, we were seated near a really noisy group of about 20 people (the amount of tequila consumed by this table may have added to their noise level).

After visiting by chance last September, I knew that Diego was at the top of my ""must do"" list each time I visit Vegas.  My last trip, I broke the record and experienced the infamous Mexican cuisine 3 times... smh.

What a treat!!! :-)

The best part about Diego is the service with a smile.  Each person not only holds true to the motto ""service with a smile"", but is also very knowledgeable about the food and top shelf tequila selection.

MUST HAVES:
Fresh guacamole made to order table-side; WARNING: you will not be able to complete a meal after margaritas, chips and guacamole.  I like mine spicy :-)

Top Shelf Margaritas - The waitstaff and bartenders know every detail about each premium tequila served.  Ask question  and you will taste the purest mix of orange, lime and tequila. :-)

There are many exquisite main courses to experience at Diego.  To be honest, by the time my entree arrives, I am usually two stuffed and only take two bites...

The service is amazing! Cesar, Ricardo, Pepe, Javier....thank you for being personable, respectful, passionate, professional and fun. The drinks and food are always PERFECT.

These guys ""flipped me"" from RuM to TeQuiLa Mojito's. I recommend the Corzo Reposado Mojito. It offers a cool, oak taste that can be modified with different tequila's. If they have raspberries, try a rum raspberry Mojito. Or better yet, try a blueberry Mojito. If you ask them to recommend a drink, they get excited. I tried several different ""Specialty Drinks."" All were great....and the beer is cold.

Diego isn't typical Mexican food.  I was thrown off and surprised the first time I ate here. I ordered the taco's. Really good, but I had menu remorse. Don't get me wrong, the taco's are very good, but when the food is this good, I like to aim high. The result was visiting many times, trying many apps and entree's, and looking forward to more.

In addition, my 2 restaurant experiences were great, but I won't go into that....this review, as stated, is about my overall bar experience.

I came here with a big group of friends (9 of us) for a fun night out. We had a great time-- delicious food, good service, fun atmosphere.

We started with pitchers of their red sangria. One pitcher was $34, but served about 12-15 cups of sangria. The sangria was fruity and we all liked it-- which, with as big of a group as we were, is saying something.

The food took a while, but they kept the chips and salsas coming as quickly as we could eat them. The chips were fresh, and was served with a trio of salsas-- a pico de gallo, a red chipotle salsa, and a salsa verde. Everyone at the table had a favorite-- but everyone's favorite was different. I couldn't get enough of the chipotle, but the people next to me loved the pico and the verde, so...

We ordered some guacamole, which was prepared tableside just the way you want it. Perfection. Gave enough for everyone to get a big spoonful.

For dinner, I had the gorditas (which was an appetizer) and the cerviche de hauchinanga. The cerviche had an amazing sauce. I could have eaten it all day. There were three kinds of gorditas served: beef, pork and shrimp. The first two were melt-in-my-mouth delicious. The shrimp one was not, and I did not bother to eat more than a bite or two since everything else was so good.

It was pretty expensive, I won't lie, but it was our fancy night out on spring break, and the food was definitely worth it.",81gsRdbPLUNXujSSJwVusg,1,0,5,9IPWNXW_b2Tt42P9-NEnKA

I take a sip of it and it tastes just like vinegar! ugh. The waiter happens to walk by and hears me... He asked ""you don't like it?"" I replied ""No, this tastes like it's been opened for a few days and it tastes like vinegar now."" He replies with ""Do you know what vinegar tastes like?"" I looked and him and said ""Yes, just like your wine."" Needless to say he brought a new bottle to the table and had me try it before pouring a glass... what a difference! It was yummy!

Now onto the flavorless food! Two of us ordered the tortilla soup. It was cool how they poured the broth into a bowl that had all the ingredients. However maybe this is why it lacked in flavor... it didn't have time to marinade. We added all kinds of items, salt, pepper, salsa to make it taste better! The ceviche was so bland too... no taste of seasonings or marinades not even lemon which is what you mostly marinade the fish/prawns in. The mole con pollo should have been written ""Pollo con mole"" cus it was all chicken and a small trace of mole. My friend ordered a side of mole and poured it in... added salsa, salt and pepper and then it was ok tasting.  

The service... lets just say our waiter was non existent. We were going to order a round of shots but he never came back to see if everything was ok or if we wanted drink refills. When he finally showed up we just asked for the bill. Never again.",-vlH_FD4oShEtWKT35M_Sg,0,0,1,qc7ubw443Oxo8qkG4jFtGg

Guac: It was okay, not great, but certainly not bad.

Ceviche: The worst I've ever had. It was overly sweet instead of citrusy like it should have been. I think that dropped an entire bottle of mango syrup in it...gross, and it was all scallops instead of shrimp...or at least a mix of the two. I would NEVER order it again, and I would TELL people not to order it! Plus, it was expensive. 

Barbacoa Enchaladas:  I liked these more than my husband did. I think they were just the right ammt. of spiciness without being overpowering. I also liked the sauce they were covered in. He didn't think they were bad, and honestly, I think he only says that they weren't ""great"" and only good because he was crushed he couldn't have the rellano..nothing would have appeased him.

Dessert: Since it was my husband's birthday, they brought him a birthday flan. I don't like flan, so I didn't partake, but my husband said it was one of the better parts of the meal.

Well it was Memorial Day weekend & a friend and I were feeling motivated to make the trek. I had called ahead to make sure they were still doing Happy Hour on Sundays, I spoke with a really nice hostess who informed me they were actually doing Happy Hour from 2-5:30 (normal HH is 4-5:30) in honor of Memorial Day.

He replied "" do you want to take it up with my mgr"" I said sure. So he leaves to go get the mgr, when he returns he says to us ""I don't feel like chasing  him around so I guess I will just honor it"" and proceeds to toss us a menu.

I had the cochinita Pebil, if you don't know what it is,  watch ""Once Upon a Time in Mexico"", it's the plate that Johnny Depp's character orders every time he eats.  Anyways the Pebil wa fantatstic,   the pork was soft and tender, it practically melted in my mouth.  

My G/F had a the steak taco's, which were really good,  what I like about this place is that the put your taco stuff on a plate and you pretty much make your own taco's.  Its good for picky eaters like my G/F.

Probably my favorite thing here is the Guacamole,  it's made right at your table and it is soo fresh and the taste is fantastic.   Also the chips and 3 different types of salsa make waiting for your food not a problem.",xp3wnTCsIVUhnS5r1tXQzg,0,0,4,1tomATc7OQCxdjE3Jt0Y1g

Our first foray at the strip was the dining row at MGM Grand. Wolfgang Puck may have his name on a placard in this place, but I think the odds would be highly in my favor for a bet that the Puckster isn't on the premises. I've already seen what happens without the man in the middle; think Oba-Chine. No place that allows smoking should be allowed to simultaneously serve food.

Thankfully the farthest restaurant from the smoke and casino has the best value. Just don't wear your blue-blockers: this place is all decked out in RED and PINK.

Big portions, so no need to order multiple courses; good too, 'cause these prices add up fast. Ours was the black bean soup and seafood cocktail, prepared table side. Main course was carne asada with beans and crispy fresh veggie salad (called Diego salad).

The salsas are the key to this place. Made fresh fresh fresh, and it has to be made just a few minutes ago, or the lime juice would start to cook those tomatoes into sour squishies.

One of us (not I) is a high roller, so on the way to the Strip she phoned the Players' Club at MGM to see if she had enough comps for dinner at Diego for the three of us.  She did, and then some.  I'd gone there for my birthday last year and loved it, so I expected to have a good meal.  And we did!

The decor is beautiful, and the menu is many notches above your typical combination-plate Mexican joint.  Our waiter was efficient, but not terribly personable, even though I spoke to him in Spanish (and I am not just another gringa - I lived in Mexico).

The three of us shared an order of taquitos.  Normally, I skip anything deep-fried, but these looked too good to pass up, so I indulged.  Thin, hot, crisp, and not greasy, and covered with - but not drenched by - that divine Mexican crema and a good sprinkling of cotijo cheese.  Yummy!!

We shared a Chiles en Nogada salad.  I expected a very small portion for the $9 charge, but it was a full bowl:  mixed greens, thin slices of granny smith apples, walnuts, and a bunch of other stuff.  The high roller wasn't crazy about it, but I and my other friend loved it.

We also had an order of Queso Fundido.  This typical Mexican appetizer is usually just cheese and ground chorizo.  This one was truly special:  it had a few more things included, and was amazingly garnished with squash blossoms (flor de calabaza) - unheard of in the U.S.  Served with perfect, warm corn tortillas, it is not to be missed.

For our main course, we shared the Carne Asada tacos.  A large plate with the roast meat, grilled onions, black bean puree, and rice were accompanied by more of those corn tortillas that were so authentic (and so unlike the rubber we're accustomed to at other places), that I felt as if I was back in Mexico.

Coffee is served with a little cup on the side containing white and brown sugar cubes and an ample amount of thin slivers of dark chocolate.  It's supposed to be melted into the coffee, but I had it sort of as a little dessert.

The guac was okay, and that's the major reason for deducting a star.

Enjoyed two of the three salsas they serve with the tasty chips.  Did not care for the green salsa, but could not get enough of the spicy salsa.  Wife really enjoyed the mild salsa fresca.

For our second pound of chips, we had the queso fresco, two separate dishes, one with a black bean base, the other with a superb chorizo flare.  These were a definite highlight of the meal, but were really quite filling.

I went for broke (Vegas, ya know?) and got the ""surf and turf""--a filet and shrimp enchiladas.  The turf was spectacular; the surf, well, it was low tide.  The turf would make a great dish on its own.

This was my second visit to Diego, and granted, on my first visit I had ordered a fruit salad that was good but not a substantial enough experience to judge the restaurant. On this visit, I decided to go for heartier Mexican fare and ordered the skirt steak tacos. 

Although I was not sure of the best way to administer the selection of signature seasoned salts onto the basket of chips, I really loved the creative touch. The salsas were delicious, and the salts provided a fun way to experiment with the flavors. 

The tacos were amazing. I would order them again without hesitation. The ingredients are delivered separately, so you are able to construct your own tacos. I love this because the tortillas do not get soggy, and you can customize the tacos to your exact personal preference. The steak was tender and cooked perfectly. And, although, I am not eating a lot of rice these days, their rice was worth cheating. It bursts with interesting flavors.

Weary from a busy conference, I suggested dinner at Diego to my companions, looking forward to margaritas and spicy cuisine. Based on the fierce, sexy campaign for patronage that was splashed throughout the MGM Grand, Diego was clearly looking to entice a sensual crowd into its space, so I was also hoping for a bit of eye candy. But as the walls throbbed with bass and the red interior lighting cast a hellish glow on our faces, I was tempted to order room service, until the appeal of tacos and ceviche anchored my feet to the tiled floor. We collectively sighed as we sank into plush chairs in the middle of the restaurant, only to be startled by the arrival of our bubbly server, whose desire to identify fun drinks pricked our nerves. Clearly, we had all transformed into grimalkins at this point.

Declining the fresh guacamole that is prepared tableside, we ordered a variety of tacos, including shrimp, beef, and chicken. Each plate came out artfully arranged, four small square plates holding meat, condiments, seasoned beans, and veggies. Layering the juicy meat with beans, crema, tomatoes, cilantro, and cheese, I found myself seeking more spice, but was grateful that I had not ordered the shrimp, which were small and seemed to be overcooked. The meat was tender and I enjoyed the tacos, but not enough to remember them several months from now. Surprisingly, the portions were nicely sized, and as we drained our glasses, we agreed that Diego had served a delicately seasoned, nourishing meal.

The delicate chips & salsa will make you feel compelled to mix & match the various flavor combinations between the carefully selected spices and varieties of salsa flavors.  Try the table-side quacamole and you can practically make a solid meal out of just the chips.

The trio appetizer was surprisingly filling and the pomegranate margarita was deceptively delicious.  To be honest, on my several different visits, I rarely made it past the appetizers because I was so full!  The service was spotty from visit to visit, but the quality of the food was high enough that service was forgiven.

We dined in early on a Saturday night and couldn't stop eating until each of us were stuffed. Nonetheless, we all planned on drinking back at the hotel room so I can't quite comment on the drinks. 

The service was exceptional. Our server (wish I remembered his name) was very honest and helped us navigate the large menu.

5535179,2011-11-14,1,vW65SNLam99SyOuVagNuvg,"Well, here I was on my 2nd trip to Vegas and having a pretty good time.  I was staying right behind MGM Grand at the Signature and it was getting pretty close to ""Go Crazy"" time.  So naturally before the festivities began me and my traveling companion needed to grab a bite before we got the night started.  

We get to the restaurant entrance and are greeted by a very lovely hostess.  She escorts us to our table and the first thing you notice when you walk in is the very modern and stylish decor.  It may not be for everyone but I really liked it and the music as well.  Our server who's name escapes me now was very nice and just great all around.  We decided to try the guacamole for starters.  Now, I will tell you this. I've had Guac at many places including Rosa Mexicana (which I've always thought was very good).  That guacamole at Diego must have had crack in it I'm certain.  I could not stop feeding my face with that stuff.  Before I even knew what happened it was all gone.  And I felt kinda bad as my traveling companion never really stood a chance in battling with me for position over the guacamole.

The entree that I had was the Arrachera (Flank Steak).  It was pretty good. I will say that I was NOT disappointed.  By the time the meal was done I was good and full.  No dessert that night.  The only thing left to the was thank our very nice server with a gracious tip and head back to the room to get ready for night.  Let me tell you that nice meal definitely helped out later on if you know what I mean, LOL.

All in all I think DIego is a pretty nice restaurant.  The next time I'm in Vegas I would definitely like to go back.",5L9ZcrEuI-1aNyw8lq49Eg,2,1,4,m3zbt3idm1majaG4s2Vslg
5537447,2011-05-17,0,vW65SNLam99SyOuVagNuvg,"We like Mexican food, and this was only 'food' from the standpoint that we were no longer hungry afterwards, but unfortunately also regretful for having invested time in chewing... and waiting.  Allow me to explain... The trio of salsas brought out with tortillas as we were seated were all but tasteless.  The 'made just for you, table-side guacomole' was too salty, too much lime juice, not enough avocado - the ratios just weren't right, and this was sadly the theme of the meal.  The ceviche was OK, but was almost exclusively shrimp... where was the lobster that was also supposed to be in this pricey appetizer?  Obviously, ceviche needs acid to 'cook' the protein, but the acid wasn't balanced or complex.  So the tastes of salt and lime where first, middle and last.  We've had much better for much less cost in places less exotic than Las Vegas, such as Chicago. 

The considerable lag between tortillas and 'real food' was annoying and the music was loud.  The saturation of red in the decor was interesting from the outside but more gloomy than mood-setting once we were seated and the images on the video screens were jarring and did not contribute positively to enjoying food. 

 I ordered two appetizers and a side as my meal, wanting to try a wider variety of their offerings that just an entree might have provided.  Queso Fundido - primary taste: salt.  Stringy cheese is always fun, but that was the highlight of my meal, this generous portion of blah.  I adore goat, but this could have been any kind of stringy, salty but otherwise tasteless protein, a mealy mastication chore.  I can't remember what the 'side' was called, but was disappointed that it was regular button mushrooms smothered in a heavy, all-but-tasteless cream.  I have never tried properly prepared corn smut and was hopeful that this was what I'd be getting.  But, no.  For those of you who might be curious, ""Huitlacoche (""wee-tlah-KOH-cheh""), also referred to as Mexican corn truffle, can be eaten either cooked or fresh.""  My husband's black beans were not as satisfying as any you could have gotten from a can and his chile rellenos (sp?) where apparently plated cold because they welded together into a dough ball with cheese in the middle.  Our overwhelming impression was food that was unimaginatively interpreted/prepared/presented, over-salted and only appropriate for the most flaccid of tastebuds. 

I gave a '2' because the pitcher of margarita was pretty good, though I am not a liquor connoisseuse.  On the other hand, the number of antacids needed to help put the memory of this meal behind us should be the better indicator of 'don't bother with this place'.",AA_1Jj2jUZrD-_9K0PFGhA,0,0,2,WG1ZNyK2BbWNhq3iJqG4pQ

They were adequate at best.

On tap tonight was guacamole and chicken mole.  The guacamole was pretty good and made table side, but I was surprised it was just one avocado.

There is a new Executive Chef - Christina Olivares. She was recently on an episode of ""Chopped"" on the Food Network, which she won. Way to go, Chef!

Anyway, Chef Christina has made some slight changes to the menu. We were there with a large group and sampled some of the newer items. We still had the awesome tableside guacamole, which is not to be missed. The care and effort put into each order is astounding and the results are delicious.

We also had pork and chicken tacos. They were small, almost bite sized tacos, with the meat, onions and cilantro. The tortilla shells were perfect. I really liked the chicken, but wasn't a fan of the pork, but everyone else did love the pork, so I guess it was just me! The biggest menu change is the addition of fajitas. We had steak fajitas, which came out sizzling on platters with onions and peppers. The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was REALLY good. The basket of tortillas were piping hot and seemed homemade and authentic. Many people in our party commented about how good everything was.

I am really glad I went back and tried some new items and that the restaurant is evolving. And I look forward to going back again soon! They have quite the tequila menu there! (Bad news! Haha)",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,1,4,sC1YKlEhHbaSQ1GCpZCgpQ

In Vegas for Super Bowl weekend with a teenager in tow and no set Super Bowl party plans, that's where we found ourselves. Most parties were 21+ or booked. And as anal as we are about making plans and itineraries and reservations we chose to fly by the seat of our pants on this one. 

So around rolls game day and we were going to head to another spot but apparently we were too late. We'd walked past Diego a few times and had wanted to try it for lunch so we gave them a call. ""Sure, we'll hold a table, when will you be here!"" The daddy long legs of our crew shaved about seven minutes off what it should've taken us if we hustled so with about three minutes to spare we called back and they agreed to hold it longer. 

For last minute arrivals we were welcomed and given primo seating in a semi-private area with a big screen. Dana quickly came over to get the drinks flowing and orders started and took very good care of us. 

The regular margaritas were great and I usually only drink beer and wine. They were well-balanced and smooth. I tried a strawberry pineapple one later on but it was far too sweet for me. The beer list is no great shakes but they have what you'll usually find at a Mexican restaurant so that works. 

Starting with the chips and salsa and guacamole we were immediately impressed. Best salsa and guacamole. Like, wow. I can't believe we didn't just fill up on that. 

We had Taquitos with steak that were excellent. Nicely spiced, not just overdone with cumin or adobo. Also, they left no trace of that scary orange grease that's a by-product of bad Mexican restaurant food. They were crisp and surprisingly light - really good. The nachos were also fantastic - a good amount of toppings layered throughout instead of just sitting on top leaving naked hot, dry chips underneath. Also, much to my surprise and happiness, not a single chip was burned. Yay!

Diego isn't top of the line cuisine, especially not compared to the major names of chefs that have restaurants in the city, but it is a great place for simpler, cheaper fare and fantastic, fun servers.",zP9HLd5nwdpHXhO2rKXjEw,0,0,4,NvWux6xnPI6QDZx-p6woHw

Dinner started with a salsa that I think was about 50% garlic by volume. Absolutely inedible. I had one chip worth, and pushed it away so I wouldn't have to think about it. Probably the worst salsa I have ever had. And I've had the salsa at Chili's. But that was saved by the table side guac, which was made nice and citrus-y, with serrano chiles, tomato, and no onion, per my request. Tasted very good, and I like their chips, which are the right amount of salty, with almost a sweet taste to the chip itself.

I can't turn down ceviche, so the bay scallop with grapefruit, mango, and habanero was next on this list. And this was really very good. Nice big helping, great citrus flavor, plenty of heat, and sweet, tender scallops. Absolutely worth getting again. Unfortunately, the main entree, barbacoa enchiladas, was just...nothing special. I wanted it to be better, but the beef didn't have much flavor, and the rice/beans similarly lacked any kind of punch. The whole dish was just blah.

Service was a little indifferent? It was fine, not rude. Just...aloof? Not that I expect them to make friends. Anyway. I expected the least from this meal of all the meals I had planned during this week's trip, and I think that's been borne out as I sit writing reviews for them all at once.

Both times we ate in the bar lounge area which is this cozy room decorated with these big, unoffensively pink tiles, a wall fountain, and a floor to ceiling shelf full of the devil's elixir - tequila!

The service was super friendly.  During our second visit, I had to give props to our server who was doing his best to convince us to try sipping tequila.  There was the slight possibility of doing shots preceded by a few ""never again"" stories.  That prompted our server to go into his sales pitch about the joys of reposado tequilas, however, no one was really mentally or financially ready to take the tequila drinking to the sipping level.

We opted for pitchers of the house margarita both times, the second time being with strawberry flavored one as touted to us by the Herradura girl who had giving us free samplings of it.

On to food, Diego's serves up a tasty guacamole that seems to be fresh-made.  Their chipotle wings are a-may-zing.  I don't even really know what makes chipotle chipotle but if it's supposed to be sweet and yummy, I like it...a lot.  I ordered those off of the happy hour menu on the first day, and on the second day I had their steak caesar salad. 

The salad was light in that they didn't drown the lettuce in the dressing, however, I could barely make out the flavor of the dressing.  So I couldn't tell if it was ""Mexican-ized"", traditional, or if it was just plain bland.

Their chips were okay, nothing memorable.  They were addicting only because they were in front of my face, but when I go to Border Grill at Mandalay, when I'm with people, we usually tear up basket after basket after basket.  The salsa was just okay as well.  No kick and nothing special but not offensive.

I mostly loved the atmosphere and that it was a chill place to be out of the crowds of people.  It didn't hurt that they have an exceptional coconut flan, with a nice, creamy texture, served in a pool of melted sugar.  The happy hour prices and food choices are decent (for the strip).

At first, I was not expecting anything more than another filling, greasy, mexican meal. Then, I tasted the salsa trio and each was a burst of flavor. All of them were delicious- green chile and smoky chipotle were my faves. Then the meal went up a notch when the guacamole cart came around. The guacamole was made fresh table side. Ours was spicy and so good!! I am going to make some at my next party. 

Then came the main course:
Sea Bass- cooked to perfection, buttery, melted in my mouth
Steak- medium rare, juicy, mouthwatering
Chicken Mole- tender, sauce was killer, could lick it off the plate
Rice and beans- beans didn't have the canned refried bean taste, not oily. 

Desserts- Cheesecake, Choc Cake, Flan, and beignets (?) I was too full to taste all of them but the fried donut looking things were good. I am a fan of sugar donuts so I liked it. 

It was such a good meal that it made me sleepy. I wanted to call it a night but it was just the beginning.....hour 14 of my 24 hrs in Vegas!

Thanks  to Chef SIMON and his staff for giving us excellent food and superb service.",73mr56T9ZdCBS62R3D0mMA,1,2,5,dYhy4HavrF0J8_gnpivKrg
