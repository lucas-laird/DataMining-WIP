The first time I went, it was for the lunch AYCE and our sushi chef (Carlos) couldn't make a sushi roll--the rolls were loose and every single roll fell apart. 

We decided to give it another shot for dinner tonight. I can honestly say that I have Never had such a bad experience as I did tonight at any other sushi restaurant. It took us 15 minutes to get an order form, but yet the couple that came in 10 minutes after us were given their order form when they were seated. Then it was another 30 minutes to get two of our rolls. Our third roll came pretty quickly.After more than an hour at the restaurant and while still waiting for our 4th roll, I looked up at the tv behind the sushi bar to see more dust on the tv and dvd than I'd ever seen in a restaurant. HUGE dust bunnies. HUGE. Of course, then I started noticing on how filthy the prep area was. We asked for our check and got out of there. $53 for 3 sushi rolls, seaweed salad and miso soup. I would gladly pay that price if the waitress had been nicer, if the sushi chef had acknowledged our presence, if the place were clean, and the sushi chef and waitress wouldn't have been giving each other attitude in front of us. It may be an AYCE sushi bar, but it took an hour to get 3 rolls--they hadn't even started our fourth roll when we decided to leave.

We have been eating sushi for over 15yrs. We know a thing or two about quality sushi. 

We decided to try the all you can eat. 
Like most places the time limit is 1Hr. They do not really enforce that I think at most places unless they are extremely busy. 

IF YOU WANT TO FILL UP FASTER THEN EAT HERE FISH ARE THINNNLY SLICE AND RICE ABOUT 2 INCHES THICK ( well DON'T EAT HERE but somewhere more reasonably price), . 
The all you can eat menu is very limited selection of rolls you can choose from. 

None the less, from the time we order our first couple of order. It took them 20 mins before we got our 1st plate of sushi. And it didn't even have all that we order so about 5/10 mins later we order some more before we finish so we would not be waiting another 20mins. 
It again took about 15mins to get 2 rolls we order. Now almost an hour has gone by. 
We are still waiting on some of the item from the 1st order. These are the ""limited quantity items"" Like Uni, sweet shrimp, giant clam. 
You can only order 1 order per person due to the cost of these items. 

We then told the waitress that we are still waiting for those item and her response was "" you still want those items"" YEAH, seems like they try to fill you up on everything else, then you might not eat those expensive items. We said ""that's the first thing we order, we want it."" another 10/15mins.

And then the sushi. Here's where it gets a little tricky. The hand-cut rolls are great. Not everything on the menu is half-off, and deciding what you want can take a while. My advice: order everything at once. They're going to bring it out to you intermittently, so you'll have time to enjoy each item. That's the way to do it anyway. The service here isn't stellar, but who cares once the J-roll comes around.


J-ROLL!!!!! It's baked, it's covered in eel sauce, and yet they still call it sushi. Thank god they do, or else I wouldn't love sushi as much as I do. Once you put a piece of J-roll in your mouth, your taste buds start to dance. I can, and have, eaten three of these in one sitting. I wasn't able to move for a while after it, but it was totally worth it. They have another version, called the B-roll, but it's like the younger, less attractive sister that everyone orders at least once out of pity.

How can a sushi restaurant that doesn't stay busy afford to keep fresh fish on hand?   IT CAN'T!

The quality of tthe sushi here is below average, and many of their rolls are drowned in sauce.  It is safe to consume raw seafood if it is of the highest quality, fresh, and stored correctly.  Just because sushi is discounted, doesn't mean you should eat it.  Generally speaking, when sushi is swimming in a sauce bath, the chef wants to hide something, usually the quality of the fish.  This is one saucy place.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS and DONT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY. Dined in with a friend one evening, only to receive the worst service and average (most likely BELOW average) sushi in all of Las Vegas. Took me six times to summon the waitress so I could get more tea, ginger, and low sodium soy sauce . Also ordered a small house salad that came 35 minutes after two of my average rolls and a cold miso soup. The waitress had an attitude when I asked her why it was taking so long to prepare my small salad as I was staring at my sushi rolls. When I finally had it, I requested to speak to the manager, who also has a terrible attitude like his employees and his entire establishment. He listened to my complaints; however, was more concerned about me paying the bill. Paid the bill, left no gratuity for ""service"", and had an aching belly until the best day.

I can give them credit for there sushi tasting very yummy . I can honestly say that is the only reason why they get two stars . Service was horrible starting with the waitress coming to take our drink orders and in the middle of us ordering our drinks she left for about 12 minutes doing other things . Husband had to call her over so she can get us started . I ordered the Grand Canyon roll which was very good . I also ordered the lasagna roll which is my favorite roll . My husband ordered his rolls . We both had 2 rolls first and then we placed another order of rolls my husband orders 2
Half rolls and I ordered 1 full and pork fried rice .  
I'm not sure if this applies every where but we have gone to many other sushi bars that never tell us anything about the limit to half rolls . After I was done with my full roll I wanted to place an order of half a "" Mexican roll "" and half of the lasagna roll . I wasn't even done saying the first roll but it's like the waitress read my mind . She automatically turned me down and said we couldn't order half rolls that we were only allowed to order one half roll but till the end . She also looked at my por fried rice and said if I didn't finish the pork fried rice then she's going to have to charge me for it  full price . Okay we understand it says it in the menu , any left food will be charged . I get it ! She didn't have to be rude about it she had no idea what was going on at that moment I could be eating my sushi and at the same time eating my damn rice . Sorry for that but it made me upset on how she said it . So after like 15 minutes later they bring me my last roll of lasagna and it was super BURNT . Like if they did it on purpose. I did tell the waiter at the time sense the waitress that was helping us at first had left . I canceled the order and just ordered a moshi but he told us there was none at the moment . Just my luck .

They brought out the rainbow roll first.  It tasted great, super fresh, so I was looking forward to the rest of my rolls.

The volcano roll, on the other hand, was probably the worst version of the volcano roll I've ever had.  There were no scallops, which I'm used to having, the yum yum sauce tasted a little funny, and they unnecessarily added hot sauce.  I ended up scraping off the yum yum sauce and just having the baked salmon and the California roll.

The screaming orgasm was decent.  Again, the sauce didn't taste like what I'm used to, but it was definitely a better ending after the terrible volcano roll.

Service was okay, and the 50% off the entire menu was pretty good.  A little pricey without the 50% discount, though.

There's nothing that stands out about this place (positive or negative) enough to warrant a return- note that the AYCE dinner is $27, a bit higher than the average here in town but only by a couple of bucks.

I did like the Crazy Jalapenos dish on the menu, which is a sushi take on stuffed and fried peppers with a smidge of cream cheese and crab inside- haven't seen that elsewhere. Appetizers seemed to be few, only desserts I saw were mochi- they did have the cappuccino flavor I really like, though.

Menu has about thirty rolls, many of which you've seen elsewhere- I was surprised to see the Grand Canyon roll available here. I was able to get a variety of fresh nigiri that the chef selected for me, but the overall fish quality seemed different- not as flavorful, light but almost on the bland side. Some pieces had an odd texture as if the wrong type of knife were used, or someone doesn't know what they're doing.

Interior is nice, sat at sushi bar, hostess and chefs are polite and friendly- place gets really busy on weekends. They have lunch specials through 3PM advertised outside.

One of the items I ordered was the super white tuna only to find out a few minutes later that they didn't have any.

We finished our first round and were ready to order seconds. It took them a while to acknowledge that we were ready to order more. Finally after maybe 5-10 minutes the waitress came and we ordered more food which consisted of 2 more rolls and some salmon nigiri. After we placed our order the yellow tail nigiri that at this point was already forgotten about was brought out. They brought the rest of the salmon nigiri and one of the rolls. After maybe five minutes waitress came back and asked how everything was, I told her that I was still missing my roll. She went back to the bar and came back and told me that it be right out because they had forgotten to make it. Before they brought it out they delivered the sweet shrimp nigiri that was ordered like 45 minutes ago in the first round. Totally disappointed because their food tasted really good. They just need to figure out a better way to keep track of their orders. I shouldn't have to wait 10 minutes to order food or to get more water specially when it's a all you an eat with a time limit.

Drove a few streets down and found this ""hole in the wall"" location, Kobe Sushi Bar. Waited literally 2 seconds to be seated, so I was a happy camper. I had a great first time experience, thanks to the chill environment, the variety of the menu and our great chef, Soto. 

The menu seemed overwhelming at first, with many choices to choose from. My first roll that I always go with first, the Tiger Roll. If a Sushi place has an amazing Tiger Roll, I will always recommend that place to friends. However, this roll in particular, fell flat. They overdid it on the Spicy Tuna, it was so much I couldn't taste the Shrimp Tempura. Thankfully, everything I ordered after that was delicious and made with love. The Garlic Tuna and Salmon Nigiri was definitely fresh. The Rainbow Roll was made perfectly, and each Roll stood out the way it was supposed to. 

Our chef was one the best parts of the experience. Soto made me feel super comfortable and even suggested other customers' favorites. He was enthusiastic, funny and loved that he was there. 

They don't do half rolls, which is a big con to coming here for AYCE. I'm the type that wants to try everything on the menu, so I was disappointed when I found out they do not do this. They also don't have loyalty stamp cards, which I feel like would bring back more loyal and consistent customers and be on a more competitive level with Goyemon an Sushi Mon.",Ym7bOXL1F0w520gkL4FzDQ,1,0,4,ZZhbZl5hG4p8jpAU_QumiA

This place offers happy hour on Friday & Saturday nights, which means 50% off their whole menu. It's really the only time you get value for your money. Their regular prices are ridiculously over priced, especially for the quality and taste of their food. 

DO:
- Get the stuffed jalepenos. 
- Take advantage of half off beer. 

DON'T:
- Eat there other than happy hour. 
- Heck, don't eat there if you're even considering a different sushi place.
- Expect good service.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,1,0,2,6JULdk7XgUWlvsg5zqSkBw

2255141,2008-01-15,0,zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ,"Who would of thought, looking for an open sushi joint at 2 in the afternoon would be a chore.  After being turned down by two japanese restaurants, that opened later in the afternoon, my friends and I decided to try our luck elsewhere.  We drove by a couple of strip malls, which vaguely advertised a sushi joint by displaying ""sushi"" on their directory, along with their requisite ""massage"" parlor.  So, we continued driving around for a bit until we actually saw a sushi bar that had a name.  Kobe Sushi Bar, the words displayed in a sports bar kinda font.  Alright, we'll give it a shot.

The interior looks a lot better than the store front, strip mall look.  The tables and chair are black with a modern feel.  And there is a sushi bar in the back, with a display board on the wall, listing all of Kobe's specialty rolls and prices.  Whoever, wrote the specials made the 1's look like 4's, so we thought at first, all the rolls costed about $45, instead of $15.

The menu has a lunch special, which consists of teriyaki bowls, pan fried and hot soup noodles, three combination bento boxes (chicken, beef, salmon), korean bbq ribs, and a sushi combo.  Also, there is a separate sushi list, which you can mark off, to order.

The sashimi was decent.  The saba (mackarel) was ok.  The hamachi was pretty good and the white tuna was really good.  The rolls were also pretty good.  The spicy tuna roll with more tuna on the outside had a nice spicy kick to it.

For appetizers, we got the yakitori which was ok, the tempura combo came with shrimp, calamari, and vegetables, and a soft shell crab.

**Soft Shell Crab Review**
As always, I must try the soft shell crab at any new sushi joint.
I give Kobe's a thumbs down.  The crab looked really dinky and battered.  No dipping sauce for the crab except for the tempura sauce we already had.

We also ordered a chicken bento box.  It came with miso soup, salad, a california roll.  The chicken looked preprocessed because the pieces looked so darned symmetrical.

All in all the meal was decent.  Some sake and beer with our food made the experience a pretty good time.",AgvjzJ7iNd3XysmRxe3u3Q,1,0,3,PbapVFG_0yLnjilMRs6d8g

Walking in they were friendly and seated us immediately. We explained it was our first time here. The waitress explained there was happy hour and there was all you can eat sushi. We compared the menu and prices and decided to do all you can eat since it was only 23 a person for dinner. 

Salmon belly, fresh and great. Only one order per person for dinner

Dumplings. Great size. Good filling. Perfectly steamed. I hate when they are soggy. 

I can't remember all the names of the rolls because we had about the of them but they were all very good and fresh. The only little complaint I have is that the ones that said they were spicy were not that spicy (boyfriend complaint) but I'm not a fan of spicy rolls so I thought they had a kick but were delicious. Very good food for a even greater price. This restaurant had a very nice family feel.

Some of the premium rolls can run up to $16 but most are $14 and below. But with the 50% off on Fridays and Saturdays, it becomes the best a la carte Sushi deal in town.

Seaweed Salad for example was $2.75 after the discount. I felt this dish was a bargain at that price, but would have never paid so much without the discount. Similar with the spicy tuna and specialty salmon roll I ordered (I forgot the name of which). The Spicy Tuna roll was $3.50 and the Salmon Roll around $6.50 after the discount. Both tasted great and the texture of the salmon was most excellent. Only complaint about the sushi itself would be that they seemed to use a little bit too much rice in it.

I have a hard time giving this place higher than three stars though because other than the half-off special, there seems to me little reason to go here. But 5 stars Friday and Saturday nights!

You see, I had a coupon that promised half-price sushi and the skinflint in me couldn't resist what I thought was a good deal. I should have listened to my inner skeptic instead.

The sushi here was mediocre. I had saba (mackerel), unagi (eel), kanpai roll and red dragon roll. The nigiri sushi was fine, but there's not much involved in putting a piece of fish on top of a lump of rice. The rolls were another story.

It seems this place is yet another ""fusion"" sushi joint. To me, ""fusion"" sushi equals cheap ingredients haphazardly thrown together, drowned in sauce and given a ridiculous name. And Kobe Sushi is no exception. I could only eat a couple of pieces of the kanpai roll. It had no flavor whatsoever, despite a generous slathering of mayo. The red dragon roll was a spicy tuna roll with tuna on top. The flavor was all spice and no tuna. I could tell the tuna had been previously frozen and had little if any flavor.

The only redeeming quality was the price. For $15, I left with a belly full of cheap but substandard sushi.

Overall, we had an enjoyable dining experience for a quiet girl's night with dinner and conversation.

3383796,2014-02-17,1,zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ,"I had Kobe sushi one year ago and it was a pleasant experience. I decided to try it again, expecting the same result. I was reminded that we can hope for the best but should always expect the worse. 
 My brother ordered some nigiri: salmon, uni, maguro and hamachi. He seemed satisfied with most of the bite-sized morsels of seafood with one exception, the tuna. It came to the table a bubblegum pink. Very unappetizing visually. He ate one piece of the bubblegum twins and decided that bazooka joe on a ball of rice does not equal deliciousness. 
My mom ordered what she always ordered when she eats at a Japanese restaurant, Katsu udon. I peeked into her bowl and it looked like a layer of beige oatmeal with the consistency of loogies (which I guess was an egg mixture of some sort) on top of over cooked pork cutlet. She took one bite, spit it out into a napkin and said ""this is the WORST Katsu udon I've ever had."" This is coming from a women who is ancient, with probably 100,000+ Katsu udon meals under her belt. 
I played it safe with my order and since I wasn't very hungry, I ordered a shrimp tempura roll. One would think that it would be impossible to mess up a simple tempura roll, but Kobe sushi has a special talent when it comes to creating gross dishes. It was cold and filled up with so much imitation crab (which I call the hot dog of the sea) that I couldn't even taste a hint of shrimp. And it was gooey upon chewing with zero if the crunchiness I love about tempura rolls. I'm not sure if it was the eel sauce or if the sushi chef spit in my roll (we returned that bowl of ""Katsu udon"" and  probably upset the chef by now with all our complaints) but something in it was gooey. To top it all off, I spotted a long gray hair coming out of the depths of sea hotdog. Of course I had to spot it AFTER I took a bite. 
I feel bad about ripping Kobe sushi so hard in this review because the waitress was pleasant and genuinely seemed embarrassed and sorry that the experience was going so bad. And she didn't charge us for the Katsu udon. But it was honestly one of the worst sushi meals I've ever had, so bad that I was compelled to write this extremely long and detailed review about it.

3592579,2011-05-24,0,zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ,"Okay, I understand that sushi bars in Vegas feel a real pressure to offer an all-you-can-eat special to their customers, it's important to remain competitive in this sushi saturated market - but one gets the impression that Kobe really despises this simple fact. 

Sure they're not the only sushi bar that charges more for single serve items (after all they have to make up the difference) - but those customers that do decide to order off the single serve menu expect some sort of value for their dollar.

My fare included one roll, one pair of tuna nigiri and a seafood salad. With a glass of water my bill came to an astonishing $35 plus tax and tip. The roll was the least appetizing of all three, with an over-whelming amount of vinegar doused over the entire roll making the rice fall apart as I picked it up - plus everything tasted like vinegar and I could not taste the fish at all. The nigiri was okay, even though the portion of fish was tiny. The seafood salad was quite good, but when I inevitably compare it to similar offerings at other sushi bars around town, it seemed - well, small.

I was not very hungry, which explains the decision to go piece meal (so to speak), but after the three offerings from Kobe I was left feeling unsatisfied. If I had only paid $10 less and had the all-you-can-eat I would have at least been filled up - but at what cost?",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,1,0,2,iRMxuP6HBupKfZCS_TEm2w

So we were called over to hit up their happy hour on a Friday night. What? Happy hour on a Friday night? Yeah, right. And not just late-night...they do happy hour every Friday and Saturday from 5pm to close, which I think is 1am. It doesn't really make sense to me, but whatever, it's cool. Their happy hour is a pretty good deal: half-off their entire menu. That being said, I was shocked at some of their prices, and there would be absolutely no reason to go here if it weren't for happy hour.

It's not that big of a place, but it was pretty poppin' when we were there. We were a party of 5...got two orders of seaweed salad, two orders of soft-shell crab, four special rolls, a tonkatsu don, and the fried banana with ice cream. I couldn't help but laugh when I saw the size of the seaweed salads, and the soft-shell crabs were even more of a joke. These guys were tiny. Now I know the different sizes of soft-shell crabs restaurants can order, and Kobe definitely just orders the cheapest available. No meat whatsoever, just fry and sauce. The four rolls we got were fine...nothing too bad, but nothing special either. The plates were cheap plastic. They were stingy with their sauces, and the extra ponzu sauce we asked for never came. The spicy tuna was definitely a darker color and kind of nasty looking, obviously pre-made and not fresh at all. The tonkatsu don's sauce was pretty tasty, but the tonkatsu was definitely soggy...not freshly fried at all. Again, obviously pre-made, probably sitting in the fridge and popped in the microwave prior to serving. Ugg. Dessert was fine, although I swear the green tea ice cream did not taste like green tea. It didn't taste bad or anything, but I oddly kept tasting some floral notes to it. Weird.

Most of their stuff was definitely overpriced, so with the 50% discount, you're probably paying about 2/3 of what it would be elsewhere at full-price. The special rolls start at $12, with most being around $14. I was shocked to see a $22 mango/salmon roll. I also saw $20 bentos. There was $3 mochi ice cream on the menu, but the picture definitely just looks like one single mochi ball split in four pieces, whereas an order of mochi elsewhere normally comes with two balls. I was probably most shocked with their drink menu. $6/8 for small/large import beers?? That's outrageous. The average price out there is $3.50/6.50. I also saw a 300ml bottle of premium sake for $22 that usually runs for $12-14. So basically they just try to fool you with their happy hour. You might be paying less than you would full-price at other places, but definitely not by much. And definitely not at another place with a nice promotion going on.

Service was also pretty crappy. Our waitress was nice enough, but we didn't know where she was half the time and always when we wanted something. We had to get another girl to take our dessert order and yet another girl to get our check. It was also fucking freezing in there. =\",tbXhMtRaWgscqbD6U_PV5A,4,1,1,u0lF4mMvbABEar3w8yIKWA

I'm always a little skeptical of Asian restaurants who don't have Asians working, especially when the sushi chef is not Japanese.  I'm also skeptical when there are no other Asian customers except for me.  Bad sign.  Fish is not very fresh.  Service is friendly and prompt, but not attentive (had to ask for napkins and missing sushi items)...except drink refills-my cup was almost always full without asking.

To satisfy a sushi craving when you're in the area, it's not a terrible place to stop...but next time I will suggest a different place to meet my friend for our sushi fix!",GHZo_Pp4jBCXTPh4oXKYSg,1,0,2,t2AXm0EbRFsCgIAIG2EHxw

Sit at the bar if you can. I'm not a sushi eater but my boyfriend is. So he had me try the one with eel, crab, tuna, salmon and some with yumyum sauce (which lives up to it's name) I normally order the edamami and the fried tofu in the miso soup which is sooooooo good. Also we order saki bottle after saki bottle. And it's cheap. We bring our friends and we all leave under 15. That is we are all drinkers. So if you don't drink! It's cheaper!
A note though. Half off starts at 10. I reccommend you get there by then. I've shown up at 12 with no where to sit! The place is small! But quaint.

3978521,2015-10-10,0,zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ,"I decided to try this place even thought I had read so many reviews which mostly are not really positive. 
Lucky me after shopping at Smith grocery store next door on Friday night. I just want something quick and easy and fortunately on Friday-Saturday night during 5pm-1am Kobe is having their Happy Hours 50% menu.
I ordered Shrimp fried rice, Bento box with Salmon Teriyaki and 2 nigiri sushi (Salmon and Squid)
The portion in each one was decent and I almost want to say ""large"". 

Anyone who reviewed this place and said they are overpriced for $20 Bento box must be on something. I would pay for $20 Bento but I was lucky to paid $10 during happy hours. 
My Shrimp fried rice was tasty and about 2 big bowls of rice. Shrimps were cut up in small pieces but I didn't mind for the price that I paid. I'm not so good at math... So I couldn't tell how many shrimps were in there. Carrot, mushroom, green onions and zucchini were fresh! 

My 2 nigiri were nice size, salmon piece was ""fat"" and squid piece was cut up ""pretty"" like they had made an effort. 

The music not too loud and over all I feel like it was a good value. 

Try out for quick and easy meal, specially on Friday and Saturday night",gJFC6DaM5guitce6FSFYxw,2,2,4,p37IVes_OfoleGrVNqTzVQ

I would get two I miss you rolls and a Salmon skin salad every single time, while my girlfriend would get a miso, tamago, and I miss you. The service was always good. The food was always good. 

Until last night. My girlfriends family came to vacation, from Hawaii. They were in the mood for Japanese cuisine. At first, we went to Jjanga, not knowing they were closed for renovations. After seeing them closed, my girlfriend and I wanted to bring them to our favorite Japanese restaurant, Kobe. We wanted to boast to them and show them how good this place was. Unfortunately, that didn't happen last night.

We were a party of seven, including a baby. There were maybe two other parties -small parties-  in the entire restaurant, both seated in the back of the restaurant. We walked in, was greeted, and lead to a table in the front. Good sized table. It could definitely fit all of us without hesitation. As soon as we were about to sit down, one of the servers told the other server to have them sit in the back, near the other parties. Let me repeat myself, we were a party of seven. Mind you she was trying to sit us at a booth, with an extra chair at the end LOL. 

Let me try to paint the picture in your head. There were seven menus laid out on the table. Three on each side and one at the end. Are you still with me? Cool. Grandma and uncle sat down on one side. Myself and my friend sat down on the other side of the table. That's all who could fit at the table. LOL. To make matters worse, when we asked to be seated elsewhere cause we OBVIOUSLY could not fit on this child sized booth, you know what she told us? Try. Try... TRY to squeeze on this table. The best part is that while she was telling us this, she was also in the process of taking a table from another party, to give to us. This party wasn't even done eating, yet she had the audacity to try to take one of their tables to give to us. What in the actual fuck? Needless to say, we walked out and went to outback steakhouse after.

Three parties in the entire restaurant, ours the biggest, and we get sat at the smallest table in there? Yeah. No. What the fuck, Kobe?

The best part of the menu being 50% off, is there are no exclusions and they dont skimp on the rolls. The only downfall lately is that the service slacks when they are busy.

I go to Kobe Sushi Bar for ""All you can eat sushi dinner special"" when I visit Las Vegas.  I just say it's just an ""Okay"" Japanese restaurant. This is a good place for HUNGRY students :) Their servers are friendly tho! :)

My parents visited me from Japan for my graduation in the last May, and I took them to Las Vegas for their new experience. I wanted to show them a Japanese food, especially sushi, so we went to Kobe Sushi Bar. Guess what? Yeah, my parents complained their sushi... LOL Oh well, well... I told them that ""we are not in Japan and we are in the United States now... please do not complain about sushi in Las Vegas..."" LOL Actually, they enjoyed having kinda different types of sushi and Japanese food! :)

Kobe Sushi Bar is more for local Vegas people. You can find this place easily with GPS, but it's kinda far from The Las Vegas Strip. So, Kobe Sushi Bar is not good for tourists... Sorry! But if you have a car or take a taxi, go ahead and Enjoy! :)

I am very picky about Japanese food. I always prefer to go to Japanese restaurants which are owned by Japanese make real Japanese tastes, NOT TOO Americanized Japanese food. This restaurant's owner is not Japanese,  so I have never seen any Japanese people in this restaurant during the dinner time... OUCH! :(

I asked if I could taste test tonkatsu vs miso ramen and the server explained I couldn't due to the broths being frozen... But he said it was so amazing and suggested miso.

Took my first bite and wasn't impressed.. Had to order chili oil and some dry seasoning to even out the taste.

My boyfriend decided to try all you can eat.
He ordered salmon sashimi and nigiri: salmon, yellowtail, super white tuna, and octopus. According to him, all were weird almost like two day leftover fish and he ended up ordering beer to chase these down, the only yummy one was the super white tuna.

He ordered the two most popular rolls and mentioned they tasted like Grocery Store sushi.

When we arrived we were the third party inside but the only one not at the bar. The service started out fine but the hostess and the server seemed to be inexperienced and weren't really able to come back to us as much as we needed them, which isn't by itself that much of a big deal but when all the other tables are getting much more attention than us and we are waiting 10 minutes for one roll its a bit frustrating. We ordered baked green muscles as soon as we arrived and somehow they didn't come until our last rolls were arriving. When we were first seated I mentioned how I loved that Kobe has a sheet so that you always get what you ordered but was quickly disappointed when I was getting incorrect quantities of nigiri and some just never came. We really like the garlic Tuna and decided to order another and what we got was nothing like the first order and some of the other cuts of nigiri were way too thick. It seemed like there was one good sushi chef and the other one was his first day on the job. I'm never one to be extremely picky about service but having worked in the service industry and having had GOOD customer service at this location before I just had to post a review. I feel like one of the most basic things that you can do to provide good service is keeping beverages full and I was rather irritated I had to ask to have my water refilled (I had drank my girlfriends water as well)  although trivial it makes a big difference. I wish I could rate the staff individually and give the main sushi chef 5 stars everything that came from him was amazing I'd give the other guy 3 because it didn't even seem like he knew how to make nigiri but his rolls were good and I'd give the service staff 2 stars. And this was on a Tuesday at 730 with 2 tables sat when we left. Only reason I came here was because my aunt and cousin are regulars here but my cousins also expressed his frustration towards what could have been the same service staff we had. 2 stars only because of one sushi chef. 
Also one dessert order per customer kind of sucks when there a lot of places that only have the same rule but also offer things like green tea creme brûlée or mousses and tempura ice cream. But only one dessert on mochi or vanilla and green tea ice cream?!

4837487,2014-01-08,1,zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ,"Another stop on my mission to find the elusive SPICY CRAB Roll. 
Now, don't laugh. I am certainly not a sushi afficienado by any means, but I do know what I like, and it's SPICY CRAB. Not the soft shell variety, and not even the real king crab version either. Just plain ole kani kama crab mixed with Japanese mayo & Siracha hot sauce to make the same sort of mix used in California rolls (without the Siracha, of course). The SPICY CRAB roll I seek, contains this mixture, cucumber, nori and rice. Pretty simple..... But I have found that in the majority of sushi restaurants that I have visited in my many travels, there is no such thing as this sort of spicy crab roll. On the rare occassion that I find SPICY CRAB roll on the menu, it turns out to be a california roll with a splash of Siracha (then just call it a Spicy California Roll at that point). 

With that said.... I decided to try this location of Kobe, in search of the elusive SPICY CRAB roll. They had one on the menu. They were even willing to substitute 'spicy crab' for 'spicy tuna' on some select rolls I chose from their Happy Hour menu - which is 50% off the entire menu from 5pm to 1am on the weekends (we went on a Saturday evening). So I ordered with intent to share:
Red Rock Roll w/ Spicy Crab not just regular crab mix
Crazy Jalapenos w/ Spicy Crab not Spicy Tuna
2 Spicy Crab Rolls
Edamame
Miso Soup

All in all, the rolls I got were good rolls. Maybe it's something psychological that as soon as I recognize the 'line of Siracha' I seriously get bent out of shape because it seems like false advertising to me. This thought of being deceived. once again, just put a damper on wanting to order anything additional (I have a limited palate when it comes to sushi).

Overall:
- Price - 5 Stars. The Happy Hour pricing of 50% off the entire menu from 5pm to 1am is a huge plus for us. We aren't huge AYCE eaters so this option made more sense for us in our dining.

- Service = 3.5 stars, they were super busy but we had to remind the server a couple of times, that others at my table were missing their orders.

- Ambiance - 3.5 stars. It's a bit of a small place but it accomodating. A little loud as there was music and 4 (i think) televisions. the televisions mostly stay turned down and tuned to different programs.

We might make it back for the happy hour on the weekend, if I can ever get over the idea that they took the lazy way out and made a spicy piece of nori and added the crab on top.",RdMD77Uwe8Mjy_EptbPa3g,1,0,4,ALgkBW2PUnpGqZzyyfOcxA

For what it is the prices are a little high if you're planning on ordering a la carte so I suggest you go elsewhere.. We both decided to get the AYCE ($23.99) since it would basically add up to that much anyways..

I noticed the AYCE menu is pretty limited compared to other places so that was the first red flag... Next they don't offer uni or fresh scallops for AYCE.. They were also out of oysters and halibut.. They do however offer sashimi (2 pieces per person) but they are cut very small. Our first plate of nigiri tasted ok but everything after that did NOT taste fresh.. Ugh nothing worse than raw fish that tastes like raw fish LOL They put a lot of rice on the nigiri too and I noticed my rice kept falling apart which made it hard to eat.. I liked that they had soft shell crab on the menu (it's small though) and I enjoyed their sweet shrimp nigiri but the shrimp heads were under-fried.. 

The waitress and busser were nice but the food took FOREVER to come out ...even though we were 1 of 3 parties in the restaurant.. The sushi quality just wasn't good. I didn't even ask if they had a stamp card so it's safe to say I probably won't be back here ;[[[

I have been to this place before but it was a long time ago, so I figured I'd try it again.  As soon as I sit down, for my all you can eat sushi experience I see the paper to order from, and for those of you that have read my prior reviews I HATE ordering from the paper forms (Lahaina, Kobe Sushi and yoko hama sushi.  So let's get on with the review..

I place my first order and part of it includes 2 hand rolls. As soon as I give the sushi chef my order, the server took it off the counter to ""review it"" (why I don't know) and highlights my order as a hand roll.  I get part of my order and then I get a roll handed to me and it's not my 2nd hand roll that I ordered. He made it into a cut roll.  The server forgot to highlight the 2nd item to indicate that.  Lahaina grill made this mistake SEVERAL times on my order.  This mistake wouldn't have happened if I ordered directly with the sushi chef.  I really wasn't happy at all.  The quality was ok at best, food was rather slow and of course I get to the part where I like to order uni and as expected (because I just knew he was gonna tell me this) they're OUT OF UNI .  I asked about ama ebi (sweet shrimp) they're out of that too. I actually gave him a fairly dirty look at that point.  He said they get their order in on Thursday.. Hmmm well today was Sunday.  So you didn't even order enough to get you through til your next order??? Yea well I know that's not really the case. They just don't want to serve it. 

This place was avg in quality, POOR in service and my record stands that any sushi bar that you have to order from on paper typically ends up with a poor experience.

5465901,2018-06-30,0,zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ,"Kobe used to be my favorite sushi spot in Vegas. It was a hidden gem with friendly sushi chefs and wait staff, and a great 50% of happy hour menu on Friday and Saturday nights. I've been going to Kobe for almost 7 years.

But over the course of the last year, my experience at Kobe has been steadily going down hill. The staff has turned over almost 100%. And instead of focusing on sushi/shashimi/nigiri, the menu has way over expanded to include items such as french fries. You also need to keep notes on what food items are on special and when, as the deals are constantly changing. But none of those reasons have stopped me from going to Kobe

What is going to make me chose other sushi restaurants in Las Vegas over Kobe is based on my last few experiences....the lack of cleanliness. The tables are sticky, the menus are dirty with soy sauce and food stuck to them, food carts with dirty dishes is stored in the hallway to the bathrooms, and the restaurant smells like sewer. Today when I visited Kobe, the sewer smell was overwhelming the second I walked through the front door. And to cover up the smell, the employees periodically pumped air freshener through the restaurant. I don't know which was more unappetizing....the sewer smell or the cheap air freshener bathroom smell throughout the the restaurant.

5586801,2011-07-12,0,zuwba6QEBIDZT0tJZmNhdQ,"Let's just say it and be clear: Friday 50% happy hour. 

The service was stellar! The place was hopping so my friend and I sat at the bar rather than wait for a table. We were immediately offered beverages and given our wooden trays for our impending sushi order. We ordered some soup and cucumber salad and took a look at the menu. Soon after we placed our order her first roll came out. Fast service with a smile! 

That service, the happy hour, and the Rock n' Roll (see below)? Best part of the evening.

All in all I believe she ordered the Michael Lui, Dynamite, Rock n' Roll (cucumber wrap, no rice), and spicy tuna.

The spicy tuna was average. Not amazing, but not bad. Even knowing that they have to make it ahead of time, my view from the bar showed a massive container of the stuff and, while it tasted OK, there's something about watching it scooped from a half-gallon size container and spread on your rice. It just isn't appetizing. The flavor *was* fine, the texture *was* fine. Overall it was just that. Fine.

The Dynamite was not dynamite. It was mushy. It didn't have enough of the sauce/topping and it had too much of the residual juices from the cooking of the onions and mushrooms. The scallops were OK-ish, if not a little overcooked. I have had much, much better at much worse places. Not at all a fan.

The miso soup was average and a little on the cool side. The cucumber salad was... well, it was OK. I prefer the cucumber to be more thinly sliced, and I had a few pieces that were not peeled enough. However, the vinegar ""dressing"" was good and it popped the fresh cucumber nicely.

The Michael Lui was  a really tasty combination, although there was too much of the sauce and too much of the crunch garnish. Complementary in flavor, but it made it a bit wet and mushy towards the end. I would order this again without all the extra crunch and less sauce.

I *really* enjoyed the Rock n' Roll (and, as I don't eat a lot of rice, enjoyed that there was an option without it). The cucumber was fresh and crispy, the fish was tender and flavorful, and the presentation was nice. The sauce was placed on the side; we could decide how much, if any, we wanted. I appreciated that quite a bit.

We began chatting with a young lady sitting next to us who shared with us her Spider Roll. She said she liked it but couldn't finish it. I found it very dry and had to try it with some of the sauces we had. Not enough spider, way too much roll.

Let's repeat: Happy Hour. During the 50% special, our entire bill was less than $40. This and the service *would* have earned a third star but, meh, the rest just can't stand up enough for me to put it on there.",O9qq7z1dgyTi1bxdEIoVJA,2,0,2,J4QsVvjMqIFkt27B7GaYQg

I was craving sushi after just getting out of the hospital and I have to say I was disappointed. They have a bunch of items your only allowed to get one of. Items that other places let you have as much as you want.
This was one of those times for 3 of us to eat for over $80 and none of us happy with what we ate! That's pretty sad. A lot of the sauces did not taste like other places that call it the same name. 
This is why I don't like trying places I have never been to or read reviews about. I should have seen by some of the pictures people posted they were not happy.   There is not a lot of choices if you don't want a lot of rice.  None of us would go back here and we don't recommend if your looking for really good auce there are so many other places that beat this hands down!",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,9,7,1,Pn3w5gie3zUI9kyT4qV-XQ

Every time I go there there's always some sort of issue whether it's my rolls falling apart and not even being rolls, or miscommunication finding out that something is not available because somebody gave wrong information the time before, etc. this place needs a lot of work. Nobody is on the same page, every time I go in there they tell me something different about one of their specialty rolls one time it's available the next time it's not available on the lunch special. The only thing they've got going for them is that the lunch special is there cheap, but you have to wait 20 minutes for it then when you come back to pick up your order they tell you it's going to be another 20 minutes because the original order you put in has a role on it that is no longer available on the special, not telling you this of course before hand because nobody knows what's going on. Never going there again go somewhere else. If the review is removed I will just repost.",cQJLv-JWU1rzyewTK3Cndg,0,0,1,cYpTWvEsI2Jf8puvxFkD0A

I have one more GC left and I wont be using it again. The fish and rice is not fresh. Mushy mush mush!!! I ALWAYS have to ask for wasabi and napkins. EVERY time they give me a hard time about using the coupon. Its annoying and the food is just not worth it. There are so many better places to choose from. This one is also overpriced for such bad food. Don't bother...,We6eIrvMpUBsBFBoNk08HA,0,0,1,ZUkym7p6vDzS5AzT4bpwGQ

For starters, when you walk in you're greeted by the stench of sewage, but not by anyone else. My friend and I came for lunch, and requested all you can eat. I placed our order by writing it down on the sheet they provide. I ordered 2 nigiri, 6 rolls, 3 green mussels, and a miso soup. We received 2 green mussels, 4 rolls, and the miso soup. I'm not sure if the rolls are actually not fresh or my senses were being tainted by the horrible smell. After waiting at least 25 minutes I asked the waitress why we hadn't received the rest of our order. She talked to the owner, and he gave me a dirty look as if was being ridiculous for asking about my order. He then proceeded to talk about us to the other sushi chef. After my other order finally came out, the owner just stared at me while I tried to eat the lukewarm mushy roll, making me feel extremely uncomfortable. The waitress, who is clearly new, was very nice and very apologetic about the bad service. Very disappointed as this used to be one of my go to sushi restaurants.",Bu-Ig31R1amjBZLyq0FICA,1,1,1,VeBF3CuyGjBXeQ10uoPJMQ

We had just come from watching a movie and were starving. We were looking for some quick and cheap grub and I remembered this Kobe location that was near us. I have been to the one on Rainbow on numerous times, but this was my visit here. I knew they have a Happy Hour that pretty much lasts all day, so it made our decision easy. 

The restaurant was pretty empty, but filled up while we were there. I took quite a while perusing the menu. The entire menu is half price during Happy Hour I decided on bento box since it seemed like the best value. My fella ordered some rolls and appetizer as did our friend. My other friend decided on a bento box as well. 

Our food came quickly. The portions were large and I was happy with most of the cooked things in my bento box. The katsu was pretty good and not overcooked, the salad was pretty fresh as well. My fella didn't enjoy his rolls so I ended up trading a majority of my bento box for his roll since I liked it better than he did. The spicy tuna was spicy but not as fresh and fell apart quite easily. The sashimi was not fresh at all. The flavor was really fishy and I ended up not eating this portion of my meal. My friends and fella were pretty meh about the dining experience as well. The prices were right, but I don't think I'll be back to this Kobe location.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,7,6,2,4IU8rQ6TONC9ELkiR3BgRA
