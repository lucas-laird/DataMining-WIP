Unfortunately the card reader wasn't working so the man behind the counter asked if I could go get cash.  The nearest ATM is in the Smiths across the way.  I went and got cash (paying an extra $3 since it wasn't my bank) and went back.  There was no one else in the place at the time and the same man behind the counter saw me come in.  I had my cash out and my food was bagged and sitting on the counter but instead of helping me he decided to take a personal phone call on his cell while I stood there and stared at him.  I continued to wait for several minutes and another man was at the counter doing something and also ignoring me.  Finally he looked up and asked if he could help me.  I said I'd like to pay for my food.  At which time the other man finally got off his phone and took my money.  No apology, no offer to give me a discount for my inconvenience, or even just throw in extra fortune cookies or something.

None of this west coast lo mein calling itself chow mein.  And there was enough for 2-3 meals! 

 Hubby got sweet and sour chicken with a mound of fried rice.  The sauce was on the side so it didnt get mushy in the container.  The egg rolls were egg rolls and not little greasy spring rolls.  And nothing was greasy.

It was delivered hot and fresh in less than an hour, just as stated

Now for some flaws.  The hot & sour soup is very good but they need to add more vinegar for the sour flavor.  Most entrees seem to have the need to cook the vegetables longer.

Chicken with Garlic Sauce - good
Pork Fried Rice - bland and dry
Vegetable Egg Roll - nothing special

A big plus is that your food is made to order, unlike Panda Express where the food is already prepared and they just scoop it into containers. The food definitely tasted like it was just made, with exception to the fried rice, which was dry.

NOW, here's the reason I lowered my stars.(the food deserves 5 stars by the way)

I decided to take my family there for a dine-in dinner last night(12-23-2010). My family of 4 were the only people there other then the staff/family of the staff. Our menus were brought out, drinks brought out, took our order(which was the Family B $29.99 w/egg drop soup, chicken wings/crab wontons/eggrolls appetizers,  combo fried rice, orange chicken(medium heat), & triple delight. The soup came out in a family bowl, no ladle. No big deal, I just went up to the counter & asked for one. Appetizers came out, still going good. 2 entrees came out, fresh & hot, lovely. No rice. We waited about 10 mins, no one was in the kitchen, only the children wrapping utensils were up front, the older man was outside talking on his cell phone smoking a cig. No one came to check on us, no refills were given or even asked if we would like one. My husband decided to just have them box it for to-go. He went up to the counter & the lady asked ""what would you like to order?"" He explained to her that he was from that table(pointed to us, & remember no one else was in there), would like a to-go box for the leftovers, the bill, & also can we get our rice to-go since it was never brought out. She asked him if he was ""sure"" it didn't come out, she went to talk to someone in the far back  to double check & said that we didn't order rice.  CLEARLY the family combo has it listed on their menu & the order note pad showed it was written down by the waitress. She then put the order in, it took only a few minutes to make, we paid & when I asked if they deliver to our area, she just said ""don't know"". There were no ""Thank Yous"" or ""Come Agains""..just the exchange of change & straight to answering the phones.  IF you do choose this place to eat, I HIGHLY suggest take out/delivery(that's what I'm doing for now on.)

There is definitely a dearth of Chinese restaurants in Las Vegas, so anytime a new one opens -- no matter how commercialized -- my insides perk up with excitement. This location is still ironing out some kinks -- their credit card machine was having some trouble, but that's to be expected.

They have good combination specials. On their grand opening, I got two of them -- yes I can be a piggy. I ordered the Shrimp and Snow Pea combination to eat there and the Mongolian Beef combination to-go. Both combinations came with fried rice, an egg roll and a fortune cookie.

The Shrimp and Snow Pea is pretty good -- light on the shrimp, but definitely heavy on flavor. I would definitely order this again. The vegetables (snow peas, carrots, celery, bean sprouts) that accompany the shrimp was really good!

The Mongolian Beef was okay. That's a tepid okay. I might order this again, but probably not. I was expecting savory and spicy, but tasted more sweet notes than anything. Once I accepted that I was in for a sweet ride, I realized that they really went heavy on the onions and bell peppers. I like the onions (especially the customary green onions) but would have preferred if they refrained from drowning my beef in bell peppers -- just because it's the right color, doesn't mean it's a welcomed flavor profile. Like the shrimp order, this was also fairly light on the protein.

1733786,2013-06-18,2,5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg,"I apologize for my lack of activity over the past two years.  Once I found a few salvageable places, I exhausted my limits for self-deprecation.  I've been to many new establishments over the hiatus, but most of them weren't worth reporting (kind of like this one).

So I received a flyer from Chopstix several weeks ago.  Their $5.75 lunch specials caught my eye -- entree, rice and drink (or eggroll) included.  The picture of the sesame chicken looked good (as the pictures always do), so I decided to oblige.  First impressions: the lobby area was small and dirty.  I found the table with the least amount of discord and waited for my order.  When I used the soda fountain, I found the soda was completely flat, so I asked for a can (which is fine, except I can't get a refill on the way out).  Also, I noticed a distinct lack of air conditioning, despite the fact that I was under a vent, so I felt sweltry and sweaty the whole time.  

When I finally received my order, it looked good (probably because I hadn't eaten all day).  The few pieces of sesame chicken on top were delicious; crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  However, once I got down to the ""meat"" of the meal, the chicken pieces became soggy and tasteless, doused in a syrupy mess.  I imagine this is what it must be like for anyone who orders to go.  I didn't even bother finishing.  At the end of my meal, I was even more depressed than when I came in.  YOU SHOULD NOT BE DEPRESSED WHEN EATING AT A RESTAURANT.

Based on this single experience, I won't go again.

I gave two stars because they seemed like nice people, and I don't want any business to fail.  They just need to step up their game a bit.",QZDS5x8YE7KWsOBhXmw0Fg,3,2,2,XzdXSgBEVSBb8Xxiw3ddLA

Food literally is hit or miss but even the misses are still edible. We've gotten food to-go from here twice now so I'm reviewing based on that. Fast service and they include everything thing you need and more in your take out, from duck sauce aka sweet n sour sauce to soy sauce.

Spring rolls are pretty standard. 

I always get the egg drop soup, so addicting and served piping hot. Comes with fried wontons which I like.

The chicken lo mein was surprisingly tasty and addicting for something so simple.

Orange chicken seemed to have so much breading and the flavor of the sauce is of course different from your conventional Panda Express. 

Mongolian beef, again had decent flavor, but the problem for us was in the texture of the meat, as in it was chewy and some pieces were tough or had gristle.

I don't recommend getting any entree with just shrimp cause although the shrimp are big, it doesn't compensate for the quantity they give you. You'll find yourself noticing how much vegetables are on the plate instead. Nonetheless, the shrimp with spicy garlic sauce was packed with flavor and not too spicy but I'd definitely get it with a different protein.

Lunch specials are worth the price and can be filling plus it's till 4pm. We ordered the Family Dinner A today and for two people it was an overwhelming amount of food but great for the price and you get choices! I'd say it can feed three maybe four people. They give you the bigger size soup too",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,3,1,4,8H5H0rKh3ZHU4Zz-P2Ukvw

Very small establishment and I ordered pick-up both times so I can't say how the dine-in would be, but they told me 10 minutes each time and it was definitely spot-on.  The food was piping hot (I had to let it cool down!) and the portions are very generous.  Their vegetable egg foo young has definitely won my heart - for whatever reason, it seems to be near-impossible to find a place that does it well in town.  Each patty is wonderfully crafted, the gravy matches it perfectly, and their rice is stellar.  Overall, everything works together swimmingly to create an amazing blend of tastes.  (Hey - sometimes it's hard to find all three pieces of this dish so well-made!)

The workers are super friendly and the kitchen was bustling like crazy the first time I went.  I said, ""I love your guys' food!"" the second time I visited and they got that shy smile and said, ""Thanks, we really appreciate that.""

Not only is the food spectacular and well-priced, it's right around the corner from my house.  I predict many more visits to this place in the not-so-distance future.  -:)",N5URmpyygDBSC_8UShI_6Q,3,1,5,r21-tKdWLSmYrio6o5cJiQ

Mainly a take-out and delivery restaurant, but there are tables inside to grab a quick lunch.  All the main dishes and combinations are big portions and cooked to order.  Always fresh food, hot and at a reasonable price.  My only hitch with all Chinese restaurants that say ""New York Style"" is that they never have a huge pork eggroll like you will find in NY.  PLEASE if anyone knows a place to get a FAT EGGROLL let me know!!! The one thing Chopstix delivers on better than most every Chinese place in town is the fried rice ONLY if you ask them to make it DARK.  Then, it really is like NY Chinese.  I always order my fried rice dark and with no peas and carrots.  
Another hint for my East Coast foodies is order the boneless spareribs without the sauce.  The boneless ribs are awesome with the fried rice, but you have to ask.  So many places like to cover that good pork in that icky red sauce and I think it ruins it.   The Happy Family is packed with meat(roast pork, shrimp, beef and scallops).  It is a total value place with excellent food.  The egg drop soup is solid and if you like Moo Shu pork or chicken, it is off the hook!  Singapore noodles also rock. They are always friendly and VERY FAST.

Chopstix was my 2nd choice just because the first place I went to was a veggie bar next door which I didn't feel at the time, maybe later. 

Chopstix was clean, quiet, and had a nice view of all the beautiful people that were going in and out of that veggie bar at least when I was there.

What makes me a fan are their lunch specials for only $5.55. I went with the House Special Chicken with rice and a soda, which if you don't want the soda you can get the egg roll instead. It was good, can't beat a $5.55 meal. I love mushrooms there were plenty inside of this dish. The rice that came with the dish was different it was yellowish but I still liked it. If you get the House Special Chicken don't add extra soy sauce, it already has enough salt and sauce just mix in the rice. Unless you like it salty. 

Service was friendly and they do deliver. I would come back cause $5.55 is a great deal for lunch and the foods wasn't that bad.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,4,3,4,kJjRj9A3-R4mxU9j9kQvbw

We actually went to hit the pizza place right next door, but we walked in there and it was a freakin' ghost town. There was one guy nodding off at a booth and no sign of any employee anywhere. If we would have stayed there much longer I'm sure a  tumbleweed would have rolled through there some how. 

So, we went next door and decided to give Chopstix a try. I'm really glad we did! It's a pretty small place, but there were only 2 other patrons in the place at the time.  I ordered the Orange Chicken combo ($6.95) while my friend ordered the Pepper Chicken combo(also $6.95). The employees were friendly and helpful. We grabbed a booth and within about 10 minutes we were served our food. 

Pretty good! The orange chicken wasn't as breaded as some other places (*cough* Panda *cough*) and tasted much, much better. My only complaint was that the rice was a bit stiff, like it wasn't fully cooked. Other than that, it was solid. 

One thing I like about this place, as opposed to other Chienese places, is that they have a fountain for drinks. None of that chintzy we-only-serve-cans shit. Although they do sell single cans, if you just can't help yourself. I'm not joking lol They really do selI single cans there!

    So upon moving here we decided we wanted some good, old fashioned Americanized Chinese food and boy did we find it with Chopstix! The General Tso's chicken and Happy family sure made this family happy. Do yourself a favor and spend the extra few bucks for the extra meat and noodles instead of rice. Everything was delicious and both times we have stuffed ourselves silly (and had plenty for the beloved leftovers the next day).

I ordered two basic choices to gage quality of their kitchen: House Lo Meln and Beef Fried Rice. Simple choices, I know, but I'm not about to order Oyster Sauce shrimp or anything deep fried based on the appearance of the place first time. 

As it turns out the Lo Mein was magnificent. Beef, Chicken, Pork and Shrimp in the House Lo Mein dish, the flavors and quality were good for a takeout choice. I was impressed. The Beef fried rice was also good, a little dry for me but well made and packed with everything you want from a fried rice.

The sesame chicken, kung poa chicken and even the chicken lo mein were all delicious.  I loved that you could get rice or lo mein as side dishes to your entrée without having to order them at  full price by themselves.  A box of rice was included and lo mein had a $2 charge.  The bottom line was very fair. The portions were good and we had leftovers the next day.

The $3.50 charge for delivery was a charge I don't usually see on Chinese take-out. With tip, it ads a lot to a $25 check. Understandable I guess with the price of gas. We live close, so maybe we'll just start picking it up.

They have a decent website for ordering, but they should add roll-over pictures so you can see what the dishes look like. I saw in the reviews that this is ""New York style."" I'm not sure what that is, but some dishes are prepared differently than what I'm used to from California; not bad, just different. I know one example is that what I'm used to ordering as chow mein is lo mein here. I've run into that alot in Las Vegas. Photos would help alot and also encourage us to try new menu items.

4620359,2010-08-01,0,5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg,"I get lunch here every so often. I absolutely love their General Tso's Chicken lunch special. At exactly $6 with tax, it's a perfect lunch option whenever I don't know what else I want. And it comes with a drink.

There's just something about this place that ever-so-slightly sets it apart from other run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurants (that's a lot of hyphens). They claim to serve ""New York style"" Chinese food. I'm really not sure what that means, but it's working for them. I also appreciate how they serve their to-go food. Instead of the typical styrofoam container, they use aluminum bowls with a plastic cover. I'm not sure if I'm getting more or less food, but it seems like the right amount of food (bordering on the heavy side).",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,4,2,4,ToWv9sHLagLjkzmeNN986Q
4655126,2012-02-09,1,5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg,"The past few days I have been taking advantage of Chinese restaurant lunch specials in my area. Yesterday, I hit up Chop Stix (in the Eastern at Windmill Smith's shopping center).
  I've been going to Chop Stix for approximately five years. I expected a three to four star experience.
  I sat down before 4 pm, when the lunch special was still available. At Chop Stix, the lunch special is served with the crunchy noodles, a can of soda, and the entree with fried rice. Deviating from the norm of a good number of Las Vegas Chinese restaurants, chow mein noodles are not included.
  Chop Stix has a few things that the Chinese restaurants that I've dined in lately don't. Lo mein is offered as a lunch special entree. That was my entree! Instead of forcing won ton soup lovers to fork over $6 for a quart of won ton soup, Chop Stix also serves a pint of it for $2.65. Minus the chow mein, a larger portion of the meal features the entree.
  The service is average. Sure, I would of enjoyed the won ton soup ahead of the entree, and not to have had to get up to ask for duck sauce, then for a straw. In life nothings perfect.
  Before the tip, a lunch special plus a pint of won ton soup costed approximately $8.50. Wow! All this freshly cooked Chinese food runs for around the exact price of Panda Express.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,2,2,4,8MSU7TtWcnAROZ-1mRX9nw
4674869,2018-01-21,0,5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg,The food here is outstanding!!!! I had the honey walnut shrimp and my fiance had the Mongolian dish.  The honey walnut shrimp was cooked just right to the point where the batter was a little crunchy and shrimp was flavorful.  The Mongolian meat was very juicy and tender.  The staff was very polite and helpful.  i will be coming back to this location again,nnXljc4ENgJblSXgovNTiA,0,0,5,BumF_7IGl5lngF39ch3rGA
4687336,2011-05-20,0,5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg,"Just found this place after living in the area for a couple of years.  Very tasty all-purpose Chinese food.  It appears to be family run, and everyone there is very friendly and helpful.  We ordered delivery to the house a couple weeks ago, and it was at the front door in well under a half hour from the moment we got off the phone!  

It's definitely 99% take-out and delivery.  They do have a dining area of sorts, but it's not really used or entirely set up for people to eat there.

About the only issue I've had is that their combo meals state that they come with an egg roll, and we have yet to see one in the package.  But those combos are so reasonably priced, especially for the amount of food you get, that I've never thought to go back and complain about it.  Can't blame them too much if I haven't brought it up to them...",YbiBC-LYzb4b6kSHBpjwPQ,1,0,4,qt_b1mU1vachLN4BI1Qgyw

The service is good and everyone is friendly. One great special they have is the buy 3 lunch specials get the 4th free. I always seem to like the shrimp with lobster sauce, beef with broccoli and the Kung Pao beef.

5261138,2010-12-19,1,5FiuxRWs-indyk2Y9imkSg,"This place bills itself as ""New York Style"" Chinese food.  Does that mean their menu is pretty rad?  Yes.  Does it mean those 90 different ads on their countertop?  Maybe, it's like a subway.  Is it the giant portions for low prices?  No, because nothing in NYC is under $50.  But together, it means it is a pretty good place to have lunch.    Skip the Kung Pao though, it's more peanuts than actual other products.",5tFUXNnFh7g1V2waWvQfbA,2,0,3,opR9zXoBNdrOXn63TfM1Ow

There wasn't too much that was special about this place. Since it was during lunch time, I ordered the Chicken Broccoli Lunch Special. What I appreciated about my food is that it was made with lots of garlic! Yum!

The environment was rather... drab. Though the booths and chairs were all clean, but it felt like they designed the place so that customers are encouraged to want to take food out instead. 

After I left, I realized they never included my egg roll with my lunch special! For that, I give them 2 stars instead of 3!",zI0cogkqx4WQArqzTHXd-Q,2,1,2,KZiZciqf64uAnVcoYN23kw

The fried rice was dry and had 0 flavor. The General Tso's was horrid, and the 2 pieces of broccoli in it were still frozen in the middle.
