This restaurant uses no msg or preservers, taste super nature and authentic.

This place actually makes great northern style Chinese cuisine. This is pretty much as authentic as you can get in Las Vegas. My favorite is their in-house hand-made noodle. The texture is always perfect. I highly recommend all the noodle dishes. In soup, dry, stir fry, they are ALL GREAT!! They probably have the best northern style Chinese noodles in town. 

Nothing fancy about their decor and vibe. Definitely not one of those that tries to look hips and young, like Shang noodles, JINYA ramen etc.. Service can be a hit and miss and at least they are always nice. 

They are not in a good location so I guess that's why they get under the radar. They are hidden in the strip mall at the northeast corner of Sahara and rainbow. The entrance door is small and kind of dark. But they are right next to a big doggy care which has a big sign. The mall is not busy at all so parking is never a problem.

We ordered beef pancake rolls, seafood noodle soup, duck, xiao long bao and a vegetable dish. I feel XLBs are lack of taste, but everything else tasted very good. 

But, man, it took very very very long time for each dish to arrive! The first dish arrived 25 minutes after we put in our order and guess what? It was delivered to us by mistake! It was someone else's order....we finally understand why don't they have a packed restaurant with great tasting food!

1409416,2018-01-25,1,aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw,"So this isn't the first time i've been here, and i remember not being that impressed being here a few years ago. According to my friends review, it was in late 2015. Came here again recently with family by recommendation by my mother's coworker. One thing to notice, is the name of the restaurant is NOT what they serve anymore, and it's almost borderline ""false advertisement"". The chinese name of this restaurant is also ridiculously similar to Joe's Shanghai in NYC. It is NOT the same ! ! 

So back to the review. Considering the location of this place, on the NW corner of Rainbow and Sahara, facing south, adjacent to the Harley Davidson, it is not what you would expect a chinese restaurant to be at. Upon my late arrival after getting off work, there was no other customers besides my own family at the restaurant. They were in the midst of ordering food so i just sat down. One thing they had called to ""reserve"" beforehand is the tea smoked duck. Apparently theres limited quantity per day or something to that nature. 

Rice is served/charged per bowl/bucket. $1 per bowl, or $4 or $5 options for a bucket of rice. I dont know what the difference between the $4 or $5 option is but we had gotten the $5 option, and gets about 6 bowls of rice. 

So about the food, for those i can actually find a name to match XD 

Tea smoked duck (???) - This was actually pretty good. Very nice tea smokey flavor in the skin and meat. The skin was pretty crispy. We only got 1/2 a duck as that was all that was left for the night but it was enough (or rather more than enough for 6 people). The duck is served with mini steamed buns that you can eat the duck similar to like peking duck, except not only skin. The flavor was pretty decent overall and i think is one of their better items that we had. 

Chives pocket (????) - This is a ""pocket"" style dish with a housemade dough pocket stuffed with chopped chives, glass noodles, eggs. The flavor of the stuff was fairly mild, could use some additional flavoring, but it was pretty decent. The pocket itself was well made and had a good chewiness to it. Add a little splash of vinegar and it was yum yum ! Each order comes with 2 pockets cut in half, so 4 pieces. 

Beef roll (????) - Green onion pancake wrapped beef with some spears of cucumber and hoisin sauce. As with the chives pocket, the green onion pancake also seems housemade as the outside seems quite good, and pan fried to a crisp but not entirely. The outside was flaking off but inside was still nice and chewy. The cucumber adds some freshness to the ""heaviness"" of the beef/hoisin sauce which makes this dish a nice appetizer to share. Each order cuts with 2 rolls, cut in half, so 4 pieces. 

""Water Cooked Beef"" (????) - This dish seems quite differently made compared to other ones i've had at other restaurants such as Chengdu taste, Yunnan Garden, etc. The ""spice"" factor seems quite mild in terms of flavor, numbing factor, and heat level, but the beef they used was very tender and ""soft"". We had actually taken the leftovers and added more ingredients to it a day after, and was spicier XD ! 

Twice cooked pork (???) - Fairly standard thin slices of pork cooked with large pieces of leek, onions, and bell pepper. Nothing too special in terms of preparation or flavor. Typical twice cooked pork, or at least what i can remember LOL

ok, now the uh im not sure what this is actually called.... LOL 

Cold appetizer - we had a cold appetizer that consisted of beef stomach and some sort of beef slice. I think this is called ???? which is made of thinly sliced beef, and beef offal (according to Wiki). Lol. The offal was a bit soft but overall, the flavor was nice. Its served cold so its not so spicy. Has a nice mild numbing factor. 

Vegetarian thing.... - overhearing convo, it was supposed to be a vegetarian duck but it was more like rolled soybean curd with a light dizzle of sesame oil, and maybe some other flavor. Very simple and light. Also served cold 

Spicy noodle seafood soup thing... - This is something i definitely dont know the name of. The noodles are housemade or resembled handmade noodles. Inconsistent thickness. Nice and chewy. If i recall correctly, the name had something about stir-frying but for some odd reason, it was in a soup form. We didn't question it. The soup base was mildly spicy and red. Various seafood inside like mussel on a half shell, imitation crab, and some other stuff. Not bad of a dish to share or eat alone. This was probably the ""most spicy"" item. That being said, it wasn't that spicy. 

Overall, this place is ok. Mildly out of the way compared to other similar restaurants. The duck is probably the only thing i'd return for, if anything.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,2,3,viyX4PCAuBVVc_xYIsCI-Q
1432116,2015-08-11,22,aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw,"Over the past year, there have been a lot of resto's popping up around the Valley promoting the traditional taste of regional Chinese cuisine. A lot of these restaurants are doing authentic dishes of the Yunnan, Sichuan, among other local provinces in China. There is a place that I believe to be doing the best version of this recent trend in Vegas, and that place would be Yunnan Cuisine.

Located on a slightly divey strip mall on west Sahara, if you walked in the door, you would think that it's just another Chinese restaurant, doing the same fare that most people in this country have grown up on. But, looks can be deceiving. 

If you've never had traditional Sichuan or Yunnan style food before, this might seem like a brand new experience. My advice? Order everything. No, I mean, stick to the noodle dishes first, you will not be disappointed.

I decided to order some appetizers. First were the cold pork ear strips. The pork ears were cut thinly and gave a great crunch and chew to the dish. They were lightly coated with a red pepper flake sauce that gave a sufficient amount of heat without overpowering the pork ears. The celery were crisp and fresh and complimented the pig ears well. The spicy chicken cubes were ok, and so were the  Sichuan pickled vegetables, which were more like pickled cabbage. They had a slight tanginess to them.

Next, we had some entrees. The steamed fish with green peppers came out first. It tasted like they used catfish or that sort, and it was very good. It was steamed in a ginger scallion broth, and was topped with some crisp green peppers. A very addicting dish, with my spoon constantly begging for more. The lamb pot came out next. This was an all-star dish. There was a slight sweetness to the dish, with combining the savory aspects of the lamb, created a winning combo. There was no gaminess to the lamb whatsoever, and if you would have told me I was eating beef.. I would have believed you.

Where I think Yunnan really excels is their noodle dishes. They even have a page on their menu dedicated to what they truly specialize in, their Yunnan rice noodle dishes. I tried out their Spicy Chicken Rice Noodle soup. As soon as it arrived at my table, I knew the yum yums were about to begin. The broth wasn't too spicy but provided enough kick that I was looking for. And, I liked the fact that their was a lingering garlic flavor to the broth which I enjoyed very much. The noodles were fantastic. Imagine a thinner version of bun bo hue style noodles, rice noodles in a thin tube shape. For a second, I thought I was eating flour based noodles, but they were indeed made of rice. Well balanced all around.

Another home run for me was their Chongqing Street Noodle Soup. I saw pictures of the soup, and I just had to try it. The broth was amazing as well. I liked that they balanced their Sichuan peppercorns in their dish, not too much, but just enough to elevate it without numbing my mouth completely. The noodles were chewy and well cooked, and the ground pork and vegetables rounded out all the flavors.

The service here was great, it's a new team, but I think they will find their footing very soon. They get better every time I visit. The prices are fair and the portions are really good as well. I wouldn't necessarily call this place a dive, but it is borderline, and I like places like that. Out of all the Sichuan and Yunnan places in Vegas, this may be my favorite. Even though there will always be places that do beef and broccoli, and crab rangoons, I'm glad that their are business' that are willing to step out of the box and bring people more of their traditional foods and taste from their homelands.

1837296,2015-08-16,3,aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw,"I've been here twice recently and really want to like this place but just have a hard time finding anything that I really like. I think another Yunnan restaurant has left this one in the dust. I eat and eat hoping my taste buds would find love here but it looks like my taste buds already found love with another Yunnan restaurant and this one just can't compare. 

The lamb hotpot looks great in the photos but when it was brought to our table, I find it sorely disappointing. First, it was smaller that I thought. When we first walked into the restaurant, the lady in the next booth was eating a hotpot and it was huge. Our lamb hotpot was a lot smaller so maybe they were low on lamb today. Second, it had under cooked vegetables and not enough lamb. And I don't know how this is possible with Yunnan cuisine but it lacked flavor besides just being spicy. 

The noodles here are decent but nothing amazing. I would eat this if I was hungry but don't particularly care for it. The Chongqing street noodle was decent but nothing amazing. I've also tried two of their beef noodles from the previous visit, one was the beef hotpot noodle and another beef noodle stew. They were also rather mediocre. 

Service here is generally friendly and decent. They give you incentive to write them a great yelp review with a meal discount or free soda (as seen on their menu).

I also waited for 30 minutes for my food for to go to make things worse. Never coming back again. They were also talking about me in Chinese assuming I can't understand because I don't feel comfortable speaking it. I should have read all the reviews instead of just looking at the rating.

I ordered the Chongqing street noodles $7. It came out pretty fast and the bowl was decent sized. 

Honestly, the flavor wasn't there. The broth was on the thinner and oily side. I keep expecting a nice strong flavor but nothing. The noodles were okay. The noodles reminded me the cheap dry flat noodles my dad would cook me when I was young.

3020821,2017-09-10,0,aTbz9GdpAf2M5MeAHVNhWw,"We got the beef pancakes, fuqi fei pian, shui zhu yu, tomato and egg noodles, dan dan noodles.

Let's start with the beef pancakes. Wow these were amazing. Normally I love meat, when it comes to beef wrapped in pancakes, I don't like too much. This was a perfect balance of hoisin sauce + pancake + beef. There wasn't so much meat that it drowned out everything else and the pancake itself was perfectly cooked and flavorful (esp with the hoisin sauce).

The fuqi fei pian. Normally places don't have tripe, so that was a little bit different. The tripe pieces also soaked up the sauce so if you like spicy, eat more of the tripe vs other beef parts. Very cheap and great value here.

The shui zhu yu....we couldn't finish it. They put a bunch of filets and stuff the rest with other veggies like bean sprouts and nappa cabbage. Overall the flavor was on point too.

The tomato and egg noodles. OMG the noodles quality is really good. It really feels handmade as it has that perfect inconsistency in shape and a nice chewiness to it. As for the whole noodle dish, the tomato and eggs were so saucy and really got to sticking onto the noodles. A simple yet amazing dish. Probably my favorite out of everything!

The dan dan noodles, like I said above, noodle quality is high. The rest of the toppings in the noodle dish was kind of meh though. Also not very spicy.

Tasted just like it. The Pork dish was good.  Tasted nothing like how Shredded Pork with Garlic Sauce should have tasted though.

I feel misled by Yelp here; the reason there are so many 4 and 5 star reviews is diners were offered discounts or free items if they posted positive reviews.

The place also used to have a funky smell, it's still kind of there but the great food makes up for it.  I only tried the sechuan beef noodles today, but i'll be back to try some of the dinner cuisines.  It's spicy and the flavor is great.

I read some reviews on dirtyness and stuff like that.  I don't know, didn't experience that yet, honest it doesn't look like the cleanest of all joints, but theres a running asian joke.  That's part of the authenticity!    The dirtier it is the tastier food.  No, seriously.  =)",SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,0,0,5,z44ty49Fekx67vDaHXkOlg

The plate comes with well mixed and balanced meat and vegetables. If u are not a big fan of spicy food, ask for less spicy, and they can make it a little sweet. Would recommend. Worth the price.

We tried to order different food every time, and so far nothing has disappointed us!  Food are delicious and authentic.  I love their portion is medium size and price is good, which means we can order more food! Yay!!

Our family favs were the spicy pork belly, roasted duck, roasted beef pancake, dan dan noodles, etc...

Chef gave us complimentary steamed bun during our last visit, omg, that was the bomb! It was a good size steamed bun (like the size of my hand), when i bit into it, there was JUICE leaking out! watch out for the juice it may explode on your first bite!  Ended up we got 10 more to go, however, there wasn't juice leaked out even thou we followed the re-heating instruction.  Well, still a good bun!

We ordered their spicy duck gizzard, cold spicy noodle, Chongqing street noodle soup, fish and tofu special, and their lamb pot. We ordered each at either medium or hot spicy. 

Everything looked great. However, the taste was way off. Why? There was no taste. Aside from the spiciness, there is literally no depth to any of the dishes we've tried. 

The tofu and fish special and the lamb pot were in huge pots. It looks big but it's not as big as you may think. They pretty much steamed the food and them pour a spicy chili oil on top. There wasn't much flavor to the dish aside from that. If they had cooked it in a sauce, it would've been better. The Chongqing street noodle also lacks some flavor .. or perhaps some MSG. The spicy cold noodle dish is decent.

It's certainly not a first date place, I don't think they serve alcohol, but the food is off the charts, plentiful, fresh, delicious, scrumptious and unbelievably reasonable. We started with steamed pork dumplings and they were the best I've ever had, I'm sure they make them there homemade. We had a hot and sour soup which is something I don't usually order because it's typically a concoction, it was killer. We had a friend join us and we ordered string beans and pork, salt and pepper shrimp, this scallion pancake that had great crunchy texture and finally, this dry fish dish with jalapeños an onions all soooo fantastically good. The service quick and the ladies were sweet. There is one caveat, they speak verrrrrry little English. Fortunately, their menu has great pictures and pretty descriptive.

The beef pancake was just okay.

We had also ordered two dumpling entrees but were told that they didn't have it ready so ""early"" in the morning.  When asked why these popular dishes weren't prepared when your restaurant opens at 11AM, the owner's daughter snapped back at my elderly mother saying, ""Do You Not understand that it takes time to prepare?!""  Well, do YOU not understand that you own a restaurant that should have its food ready when you open?  And do YOU not understand what good and courteous service is, or how to properly treat your customers?
