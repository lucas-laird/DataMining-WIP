91083,2017-12-06,1,wPGjrXl1W0Bb8m2L7nBAew,"Pho joints are getting a little too numerous these days and it's hard to make yourself stand out in the crowd. Well, they Pho King did it. Came for 12:30 lunch on a Sunday with my 8 y/o daughter, and was seated immediately, which was lucky because by 1pm there was a waitlist. The place is small but airy, extremely clean, and modern. For my first time, I ordered the dac biet special pho, it was $9.95. They only serve one size bowl and it's a Small by comparison to most other places. It's fairly standard, brisket, flank, tendon, beef balls, and rare steak. Tripe is not on the menu, I thought this would be a red flag, but it turns out the broth was very nice, very clean tasting with a deep beefy flavor. The noodles had a good chew and didn't seem to water down the soup. Standard pho veggie accoutrements were average. The meats were tender and flavorful, but lacking in portion. Service was prompt and courteous, check service at the table which is very nice compared counter POS. 

Overall, it's a good bowl of pho, not great, but it might be the best in that area at Eastern and 215.",Pdkr6ajlAYWApTOXbni2hw,2,1,4,bXR7CyPRb02kWA_06ZG_-w

First impression: the soup is incredibly oily with a thick floating layer of orange grease, but somehow it had no flavor, complexity, or spice. All I tasted was oil, even after I tried stirring to get to the broth. It was almost inedible. However, the tendons were absolutely perfect, gelatinous and tender, so I gave it another shot. Second time around, I asked the kitchen for less oil. Once I got home, I skimmed off the top layer of orange grease using a spoon. I added two lime slices, basil, additional chili sauce, and a squirt of hoisin. It was incredible!! I think reviewers who are commenting the broth is flavorless is drinking the soup as it comes.

The pho dac biet/combination pho I ordered seemed lacking.   The tendons were very small. 
 They could have been more generous with their portioning of their flank steak and probably their noodles as well.  The broth did not stand out in any way. 

The fresh spring rolls we had as an appetizer were okay.  Their accompanying peanut sauce was way too watery.  

My wife's pork chop dish was pretty good and better than the pho.

Having spent lots of time in Viet Nam, and never having pho prior to going there, I came home to Vegas searching for a place that could even slightly come close to the pho I had over there.

I judge pho mainly on the broth.
So far, Pho King is the closest thing to the real deal that I've found on this side of town in Henderson. I know there are tons of pho places, and I've tried maybe 10 of them. 
The only other one that I love is Sunflower Vietnamese Restaurant all the way in N. Las Vegas on Craig road.

I would definitely, definitely recommend trying this place if you're looking for legit, authentic tasting pho. They also have Cafe Sua Da there, the Vietnamese coffee made with condensed milk, and they even used the old-school drip system like they still do in Viet Nam. I took one sip and it was like omg I'm back in Viet Nam. It was awesome.

The place is in a super convenient location, and the owner is very sweet and very enthusiastic about sharing Vietnamese food and culture. He went to Viet Nam to get the paintings that decorate the walls in the restaurant, and everything is very modern and nice in there. The wait staff is very friendly and it's super affordable! My fiance and I had the egg rolls (which were really yummy too), 2 bowls of pho and a cafe sua da and it was like $29 after taxes.

I've lived in Vegas for 5 years now and I know where all the good (and bad - DO NOT go to Pho 87) Pho restaurants are. That being said, I've also only lived in this area of town. The two pho places that stand out are Pho Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon...and of course you have Pho MaiLan and Lemongrass Cafe which are ""ok"". Pho Saigon does well because of its name and because of its location (close to the freeway and LVAC. Pho Little Saigon has the unfortunate problem of being in a location that is slightly difficult to navigate through but I equally enjoy that location as I do Pho Saigon 8.

Pho King is in a better location and has two routes of access which makes it easier (and less of a hassle) to go to than Pho Saigon 8 AND it is in close proximity to EOS Fitness. With that being said, i only tried the pho there and I can say that it unfortunately wasn't my favorite...also, when I'm in a Vietnamese restaurant, I would prefer to hear Vietnamese music and I believe they were just playing a top 40 hits radio station. 


I would say that I would give it another try but with so many other options close by, I don't see myself going back anytime soon :(",RGD8rpzZFoQsSf-w-Okaog,0,0,3,WVjNHYzzRVZwzW8JfpMOnQ

Yes!  Another Pho shop that has good broth and ingredients.  I got the Bun Bo Hue and it did not disappoint.  I liked that they brought out this delicious umami lemongrass paste to add into my soup to my heart's desire.  The meats and blood cake were all tasty and full of flavor.  I also tried the oxtail pho soup and that again, was flavorful.  For soups, broth is the base and that will determine whether it will be a good bowl of soup or not.  Pho King got it right.  I also liked the fact that they had the top American pop videos playing on their tv...I enjoyed the authentic Vietnamese food, chilled ambiance and the attentive servers here at Pho King and I will return.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,1,1,4,XNt5WFOzmk3Tdz3_NQHnFA

Don't let the ambiance or decor fool you. Now, they just opened up a week ago, so who knows what's yet to come. But I'm hoping maybe they'll throw in some music and maybe not play a random football game on the one tv they have. 

Anyway, the star of the show is the pho. The broth is flavorful--it rivals the 24-hour broth that I love so much at Pho Kim. And the noodles are soft and comforting. Plus, I love that there's an option to ""create your own bowl"" so I could pick the meats that I wanted.

Pho oxtails was ok and the broth was the same with other Vietnamese else in Vegas , the taste was not that great and it was good for American only.

Bún bò Hu soups base wasn't taste good lots of fattening and no flavor

But I asked our server and they were able to accommodate that for me. He also made sure that I was ok with the beef broth since I ordered mine with all veggies.

We started with the spring rolls, yummy. It reminded me of lumpia but with a Vietnamese twist. It tastes good if you wrap the spring roll in the lettuce. If you haven't done that before... you are missing out!

My vegetable pho tasted great, I almost never finish all of my food but this time I did! And there was only one size for pho and it was a pretty decent size.

Pho King is a new Vietnamese restaurant that has popped up in an increasingly popular section of Eastern Avenue south of 215. They're in the corner of the EOS Fitness plaza, right next to one of my favorite poke bowl spots, so I've seen their signage, laughed at their name, and eagerly looked forward to their opening. When their grand opening weekend finally arrived a couple of weeks ago, I jumped at the chance

I ordered the Com Bo Luc Lac ($12.50), a popular dish commonly referred to as ""shaking beef"" in English. I was already concerned by the lack of tomato rice and fish sauce-based dipping sauce, and the dish indeed lacked flavor. Some restaurants can pull off getting enough flavor in the beef that you don't need anything else, but this isn't one of them. The other warning sign for me was how quickly the dish was brought out. Although they did sear the beef cubes well, they only got most of the cubes to a rare cook at best. Oh, and the white rice was discernibly on the mushy side.

I also tried a bit of my friend's Pho Dac Biet ($9.75) and immediately decided that I wasn't very interested in having any more to do with it. The broth of beef pho should be complex, but it simply wasn't anything special. Hopefully, he'll get around to writing his full review on that soon.

I've had opportunities to try Pho King again during the remainder of their 20% off promotion (which they ran from the start and extended through the end of October), but I've passed on them. With the full prices in effect, I can't envision myself coming back to try anything else unless I get really bored of all the other new businesses while simultaneously getting recommendations from people who have more experience with Vietnamese food than just the relatively lackluster stuff around Las Vegas.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,7,3,vn64awfel0XEL8NVVQ0pjg

The broth was so loaded with Anise (the little black star herb that is used in moderation in most pho's) that it was inedible. It had also soaked into the noodles giving them the same wretched taste.
My friend tried the pho tai......and it was the same situation. Both bowls were left on table without eating anything!!! I go to most of the pho  restr.  in the area and also Spring Street and have NEVER had to leave due to the food being so bad.

On the plus side, it is a very clean and orderly establishment  and the server was friendly.
UPDATE:  In response to your reply I submit to you the following:
Yes, my wife and I were the table you mentioned. I had previously been to your establishment and tried your PHO TAI at that time. I found it similar in Anise, however, admittedly not at over whelming as the Pho GA today. Since you talked to your employees I'm sure they mentioned that we left without consuming the pho???  We did not ask for a refund and left your server a tip as well. Perhaps your should sample your broth before throwing the ""illegal"" word around.

UPDATE 2
Perhaps if you re-read my update you will ""comprehend"" the review.
We do have the receipt but choose not to take you up on your offer.

It's crazy because they are every where but often are just mediocre.   Now mind you I have only had their spring rolls and their vermicelli noodle bowls.  I also have only done take out. 

Their vermicelli noodle bowl is what speaks to my soul.   They almost always cook their noodles perfect for one,  while most places overcook them and sometimes even put them steaming hot on your fresh salad ingriendients making them wilt.  None of this blasphemy occurs here.   They also have a good balance of fresh lettuce and pickled veggies to noodle,  and are very generous with meat portions.   I get the grilled pork with a grilled chicken side.   So much flavor it just explodes in the mouth.   The nuoc mam also is not watered down and ties everything together. 

The spring rolls are solid.   They are just well executed, no frills though.  My favorite are still in a hole in the wall in Atlanta,  Georgia. It would be nice to find a place that really elevates these here. 

They are always very fast and curtious when it comes to their to go orders.

I ordered the create your own and chose the following three meats- gan(tendon), nam(flank), tai(rare steak).  Noodles were plentiful and the broth was clear with a hint of oily residue.  This shows how much attention they spend creating the broth and skimmy the fat from the boiling broth.  I was stuffed.

Nem nuong cuon was freshly made and the nem was delicious with the crunchy fried rolled skin inside.  The sauce was the basic hoisin with crumble peanuts.

Pho King is the new Vietnamese restaurant in the south side of town, located on the treacherously congested Eastern Ave. It's a small shop with a simple modern flair, topped with a nice little glass pane waterfall at the entrance.

The menu is simple compared to a lot of other pho shops. There are only 5 choices of pho. I opted to create my own bowl and I was allowed to choose three types of meat. I chose the brisket, tendon, and flank. Don't worry, though. If you don't want pho, there are other options on the menu like appetizers, vermicelli, and rice dishes. You know, the standards. 

For the $9.25 price tag, you'd think you wouldn't be getting your money's worth considering all the cheaper options around town, but the bowl they serve you with is pretty large. Well worth the price. They provide plenty of noodles, meats, and garnish. Although I do wish they put more onions into the mixture.

The flavor of the broth was flavorful, and the noodles were cooked just right. I was surprisingly pleased. For a restaurant that has a funny name, their food is no joke.",MghRQ6h95OSD5so41-SPBA,0,1,4,fucdJwfEH2vEHRRGWfbCrA

This is my first time here.  There is something charming, though, about seeing regulars recognized and acknowledged.  Makes me look forward to the next visit.",0oCX_noDIESiIHKf7Sly1w,0,0,5,kUFeIwOaYqtg8mlXbB5Dxw

Flavor wise it's just right and they do it a little bit different than other places around town.  The ones that I am used to have more herbs shining through.  Other places are way too salty (pho kim long!).  I like the build your own pho. My favorite is rare steak, beef ball, and brisket. I also have tried the oxtail, which was super tender.  

I like their egg rolls here, whether it is the spring rolls or the nem nuong. Both were delicious, fresh, and wrapped to perfection.

Their menu is more condensed than other Vietnamese restaurants. I wish they had the crispy egg noodle dish with chicken and vegetables in brown sauce!

Servers are really nice here and the restaurant is very clean.",OPJ0TW8tt5UanY2_YpCgIQ,8,6,4,fO8rCC1a_W-N-Ejz_gorlQ

5225659,2018-01-14,0,wPGjrXl1W0Bb8m2L7nBAew,"Thank you!  Thank you for coming to Henderson.  For years, we had to drive 20+ miles each way, to Chinatown just for decent VN food.  Note, there are about 3 to 4 other VN restaurants within 2 miles of this one but this one blows them out of the water. My son and husband accidentally found this place and they were so excited to tell me about the ""fuh-king"" good VN restaurant.  I wonder if the owners named the place on purpose but they are certainly living up to their name, literally.  

Try everything because it's good, tasty, authentic VN food.  However, I didn't care for the vegetarian soup, can't remember the name.  They have awesome vegetarian spring rolls, the pho is absolutely delicious, vegetables are always fresh, and the portions are more than fair.  And yes, they are spring rolls in rice paper, not that deep-fried junk you get from other restaurants. Service is EXCELLENT.  The place is clean and I visualize that they will be tearing down walls to expand in the near future because it's really good food.  Just one suggestion, I hope they will turn that television down.  It's kind of annoying and in my opinion, takes away from the dining atmosphere.",AMKEOF9r61Ik8QQ-fnqe5Q,2,0,5,QOwHtdFc3rEIi5w_qxCvxg

To start, we ordered egg rolls for the table, which were crispy outside, and jam packed full of flavor inside.  5 out of 5 stars for the egg rolls.  For lunch, I got the build your own pho with rare steak, brisket, and flank.  The soup itself was sweeter than what I prefer, and the meat was on the fatty side.  Don't get me wrong, I like a chunk of fatty meat in my pho as much as the next guy... but this was a bit much for me; 3 out of 5 stars.Where this restaurant excels is its service.  

Our table never had a glass that was below half full.  We took my four year old daughter with us and were informed that they only have one size bowl of pho.  Fine, no big deal.  When I ordered the kiddo a bowl of soup, the waiter quickly suggested that I order a side of steak and a side of noodles instead which would save a few bucks. Right on!  My daughter loved the broth in the soup so much that she drank all of what was in her bowl.  I ordered a refill on the broth for her, and they brought it out free of charge.  5 out of 5.

I'd say all in all, this is a solid spot for a quick bite if you've got a big appetite and find yourself looking for an inexpensive spot with a great ambiance and staff.",cB5M0WvNLk3bJi2IMsPH9w,1,0,4,5pU85hYILOss1lcRPTwQrQ

Nothing special about the fresh spring rolls. I honestly feel like they're all the same at every place I go to. The peanut sauce wasn't watered down though. It was nice and thick just how I like it. The combination pho came with rare steak, brisket and beef balls. When we first got it, the broth was a deep brown color. Which means they took their time on the broth. It tasted so delicious. The flavor was so meaty and yumm... probably the best pho broth I ever had!!! Others are always so light in color. Yes, price wise it's a little more than others but trust me, it's worth it!! Now lastly, the pork chop combination which came with 1 piece pork chop,
Chinese sausage & eggloaf. I was never a fan of eggloaf but once I had pho kings eggloaf I ordered another on the side. It was that great!!!!
