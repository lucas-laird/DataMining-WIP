The popcorn chicken's texture is good (don't expect it to taste a lot like chicken...as with the burger & any vegan substitute.)  The breading on it is a great texture, like tempura but not quite as light.  

The meat sandwich is pretty good, especially the yummy fixins and sauce.

NOT actual cons but not pros... Chocolate shake is barely sweet and pretty watery but has a pretty good flavor.  More sweetness would bring out the chocolate flavor more.  

The zucchini breading is tempura like, a wonderful texture, but like the chicken & burger, the ranch dressing, & much of the food here, it falls under the unfortunate and unnecessary vegan stereotype of bland or not enough flavor. There are many who make vegan taste good, this place, not so much.",5fTEVByUVKUhrS-hA4rRNQ,1,0,3,wjlH7u4wuHjZY88kJNWTow

339716,2016-10-23,0,vodCM302JJ_P9yJt1WuH_w,"Now that I've tried almost everything on the menu, I feel fairly qualified to write a review that may help the Vegeway newbie out, and maybe even the owner, as there are just a couple of tweaks that would make this place a solid 5 stars. To make it more readable, I'll divide by category:

The excellent: 1. Beef sandwich. This is reminiscent of a banh mi sandwich; light, yet filling, slightly sweet and spicy, and refreshing from the cilantro and shredded carrot. This is my favorite item on the entire menu. 2. Chocolate shake. No one would be able to tell this isn't a regular chocolate shake. Perfect texture and chocolaty-ness. 

The very good: 1. Cheeseburger. Yep this satisfies all the cravings for cheesy, decadent, filling, and ""meaty"". It would have been excellent except the cheese isn't quite there. It has a slightly plastic/fake flavor. I know vegan cheese is tricky but I've had better. 2. Vanilla shake. It ain't no chocolate shake but perfect texture. I can tell this is a nondairy milkshake which is fine, but you won't fool anyone with it. 3. Chicken wrap. This was much bigger than I expected, it looks and feels like a huge 5-pound burrito. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be served hot or cold because it looked like it was grilled yet when I took a bite it was room temperature and the tortilla seemed slightly stale. Still, this is another dish that will satisfy that comfort food craving. 

Room for improvement: 1. Fries. I tried both sweet potato and regular fries on two different days and they were soggy both times. There is just no excuse for soggy fries and instead of them being a delicious accompaniment to your sandwich they're just a pile of disappointment. Please Vegeway, fix this and I'll come more often. 
2. The Cajun sauce. So much potential but not executed well. Not enough zip or flavor. Sauces are easy, come on guys. 3. Strawberry shake. Strawberry shakes can either be amazing or just taste off. Unfortunately this tasted off. Just no. 4. Popcorn chicken. Not terrible but it just tastes like fried balls of dough. I couldn't really discern where the outside ended and the inside began. Nothing ""chicken-y"" about it in my opinion, but if you like eating anything fried and don't really care what it is, this may be for you.  

I also have to add that the customer service is excellent. Always an enthusiastic greeting when you're coming and going. They'll help you choose what to get and everyone is very friendly. There are a handful of tables but it gets crowded at lunch on the weekend, but I can't vouch for other times. I live about 30 minutes away but I will definitely be back. They've hit on a niche market and they've just about hit a grand slam. Go and see for yourself, and I guarantee you'll be back for more.",WcnwW-_xRk9PxOlCtn_CKw,4,0,4,e3Uzn0gGcicqjc-YT9ZbCg

379163,2016-11-27,1,vodCM302JJ_P9yJt1WuH_w,"Veggie House is overpriced. VegeWay is overpriced. 

Chef Kenny doesn't care to talk to you if you do not resemble someone he's met in the past as an acquaintance or friend or one who is likely to be a member of Yelp. If you are Caucasian with a North Face jacket on and sporting some horn-rimmed Oliver Peoples glasses, then yes, he will banter with you, but if you are Chinese and from a remote mountain village, then expect to be ignored and denied free samples.

But that was Veggie House. That was then, this is now. I will review VegeWay as VegeWay.

Do not order the hamburger. The patty is dry and the cheese, being vegan, tastes like Elmer's glue. The bun may not be Devonshire butter brioche, but it is an insubstantial mess.

The beef sandwich, an obvious take on the Vietnamese-style banh mi is a poor clone of the iconic sandwich. It isn't freshly baked French bread, but store-bought hoagie. The beef consists of diced pieces of dried soy jerky. For the price here ($6.50 or so) you can get 2 authentic banh mi sandwiches at a Vietnamese bakery.

The fried finger foods are mediocre, but proudly presented as vegan. Enjoy.

I do like the place at night, however, as it resembles one of those retro burger dives one would see still operating in places like Flint, Michigan, but with cheerful employees in their plant-based colored uniforms.

Verdict: Overpriced and mediocre",Vy035X7tzX7Nh25UwoQB0w,0,0,2,0xOFc8ShVIIXTunXADJjug

Secondly, the staff here seems far happier than the staffs at any nonvegan restaurant, go figure! Always friendly, cheerful, helpful, and genuinely passionate about the meals they serve, which brings me to the food!  Everything I've tried here has been fantastic!  Like a vegan In-n-Out with more options, I loved the animal fries!  That's right, vegan sauce and vegan cheese (not a huge fan of Daiya, but it was still great! Learning to like it), and grilled onions over french fries.  YUM!  My favorite, however, was the chicken ranch sandwich, which was exquisite!  Definitely have a weakness for ranch, so thank goodness for vegan ranch!  Another gem on the menu is the chocolate peanut butter milkshake!  Oh man, I didn't think I'd ever have a good milkshake again after going vegan, so a big THANK YOU to VegeWay for proving me wrong on that thought.  I've also tried a few other things on the menu, like their double cheeseburger and their chicken poppers, which were equally delicious.  I consider myself a big fan.  Fast food has never felt better, or tastier.  My only complaint, hence the four stars (If I could only remove a half star I would have done that) was that on one occasion that I was dining here, the TV was set to a Food Network type cooking show (not sure what show exactly, not big on watching TV), which was displaying the preparation of a steak.  I found that to be bothersome, since I was eating in a vegan establishment.

It was really fun to try a vegan fast food, but honestly, the best thing we had was the milkshake. Too bad the mango was discontinued. Anyway, the burger is super average. Even grocery store burgers are better since they have some flavor and more texture. Kinda surprised the bun isn't an obvious whole grain or wheat. Overall, flavor really lacked. Kids enjoyed the fries, but they will eat those anywhere. Zucchini would be better if it was seasoned, its pretty bland, but the breading is great. Same goes for the popcorn chicken.

The food is extremely delicious. I long for the weekends when I can pig out on their goodness. 

My favorite dishes to date: 
1- Steak Sandwich (you may choose to get without jalapenos...it is a bit too hot,but delicious) 
2- VegeWay Burger  - PHENOMENAL, blows anything you had labeled ""veggie burger"" out of the water, the texture and flavor is just right. 
3- Orange Popcorn Chicken - Tastes just like the ""real thing"", I bring it home and eat it with rice to relive my Chinese food days.

Vegeway also changed the fries to a thinner cut fries that aren't nearly as good as the old ones. I don't know if they're cutting back on portions but the fries I received with my meal only filled about half of my basket when it used to be overflow.

Cheese was some of the closest plant based version of a good ol' slab of greasy American cheese that I've ever tasted. 

Just a few critiques of the place: part of what tops off the In-N-Out experience was the fries. While tasty, the fries at Vege Way are not close to the original. It would be nice if the fries were replicated as well. Also, a vegan offering similar to In-N-Out's animal style dressing would be a welcome option.

I LIKE to stick to what I like but I have tried the pop corn chicken and I am not a big fan. It's crispy but a little bland and I am not a big fan of the vegan ranch that comes with it. I have yet to try the other items but I love the veggie burger so much. It tastes so good and I can't emphasize that enough.,kQNAqnOI0ycJjFA_oSwHxQ,4,4,5,wJ7pti2TcnHi_Lo_sy6nmA

I had their version of the Double Double, which tasted pretty close to the real deal. The texture of the patty was different, but not bad. Their special sauce also tasted much like In-N-Out's, but was a little runny. Not a huge deal, just a bit messier when dipping fries. They also have equally great non-In-N-Out food like popcorn chicken, curly fries, and wraps.

Finally, the biggest deal for me as a non-vegan who still eats vegan food from time to time, the price! It costs pretty much the same as the non-vegan food they're emulating, without sacrificing flavor. So if you're generally on the fence about vegan food because of the price, this is the place for you.

Service was OK... The staff were extremely friendly which would've been a 5 but the speed of the food coming out was a little on the slow side. So yes it is like fast food in the way that your order but the food definitely did not come out fast so minus 1 star. And for the timing as well... My burger came out first and it sat there for a few minutes while everything else on my order was getting fried. Timing was off since everything was hot but my burger was a tad bit cold. :( (3/5)

Ambiance was OK... It was small and the decor changed little from when this was another sandwich shop.... But it was clean just not very welcoming imho... And it was a tad bit cold in there. But the most important thing was that it was clean and that they had a person cleaning and changing out the trash can...4/5

Food was decent. I think veggie house is definitely 5 star... Vege Way not so much. I got their burger and it was decent. But the ""meat"" was not the best... It was a tad bit on the mushy side but the flavor was very good. Very earthy.... But I wished that they had put more of a sear on it so that it would've had a better texture. (2.5/5)  Curly fries were curly fries (5/5). Fried zucchini was decent. BUT the batter never stuck to the zucchini and it just fell off. It was cool that it was more of a tempura batter then breading but the oil was too cold because it was very very very greasy!!! Flavor was good but it was drenched in oil (2.5/5). The popcorn chicken on the other hand was fantastic! (5/5) perfectly crunchy and not too greasy either. And just like the zucchini this was more a tempura style batter... The texture of the chicken was perfect as was the batter. Very crunchy.  The ranch was also delicious for being vegan. It didn't taste like ranch to me but it had a great flavor. And I enjoyed dipping the popcorn chicken and the fried zucchini in it. (5/5)

The burger is the star of the menu, available as a single or double AND patties can be purchased to cook up at home- the owner is open about his ingredients and even meatatarians should find the flavors palatable. 

Other menu items are a little less successful- the ""beef"" bahn mi sandwich didn't do anything for me and was tossed after a couple of bites, and the fish tacos are best described as mediocre.  I've yet to try the popcorn ""chicken"", because it's always sold out.

Counter service is fairly friendly. They could use a speaker to announce order numbers rather than scream them.

First of all, the restaurant itself lacks any design identity or personality. It feels very hodgepodge and thrown together. Not a good first impression. 

We ordered the burger meals with curly fries- they were the highlight of the meal, fried to perfection and piping hot. The burger ""supports""- bun, sauce, lettuce, onion, tomato were all nice and fresh, loaded on in-n-out style, and the vegan cheeze was also tolerable, but the patty itself was dry, crusty around the edges, and tastes too much like it's central ingredient- cabbage. The proprietor of the business also owns a vegan Chinese restaurant and it seems there's just a bit too much influence from Asian cuisine/flavors to truly call it the ""American"" style burger it's aiming to be. I love fusion cuisine when it's intentional and both styles of cuisine are complementary but this felt like the Asian essence was competing with the expected burger flavors.

Listen to whatever you want -- I was 18 once too, but it's not the Electric Daisy Carnival, you're at freaking work. Turn it down. 

We were going to eat there, got it to go so we didn't have to listen to that.

Not surprisingly, when I ordered, the cashier couldn't hear that I ordered two double combos. We pay and walk over to the right and realize we didn't get cups. I turn around and politely ask ""hey can we grab the cups?""

The next minute was like an SNL skit of what everyone complains about millennials. 

Rather than just say something normal like ""oh, I'm sorry, I didn't hear you asked for combos, let me charge for the difference,"" (aka: what to do when a totally understandable mistake happens...not a big deal) the cashier starts rudely (and totally unnecessarily) arguing with me on whether or not I ordered combos.

Seriously. I'm having this conversation. Well, trying to, I can barely hear over the music.  

Even says ""Oh, and like you didn't even tell me what kind of fries you want,"" like that was his big evidence to make sure I knew I was the one in the wrong. Because, of course, the customer is totally responsible for knowing there are options on that one. 

After a little more equally unnecessary back and forth he finally says ""uh I guess I can fix it."" Thanks, dude. That should have been Plan A.

I've been there before and had everything been fine, but this experience kinda killed it for me. Definitely a lapse in management to have walked into the restaurant looking and being run like that.",lBqJuM7V13pPOOWOpxX5ew,8,1,2,jajTHZSblWzMRbjIQ0H1yw

My two absolute favorites are the strawberry shake (mmm) and the popcorn chick'n (mmm-mmm-mmm!). Come get yours!

Got a combo plus the fried zucchini.  Took a little longer than expected, but when I received my food it was all very fresh and very hot.

Curly fries were delicious and not greasy at all.  The ""burger"" was extremely tasty with that hearty, meaty feel.  The ""cheese"" was melty (which, if you're vegan, you know is very hard to find) and delicious - and saved me from my lactose intolerance.  I also got a side of the fried zucchini which was straight from heaven.  The vegan ranch that came with it was not-so-much: a bit watery, but the flavor itself was decent.

 Objectively speaking though it was the most amazing transaction to have ever happened in human history, Vegeway gave me a pile of mouth turd and I gave them 8 of my precious currency. 

I typically like to go to Vegan places once in a while in a ditch effort to save the animal kingdom one more human life's worth of food in meat (that thought was a lot to chew) ((as was  the vegan chicken wrap))
, and thought ""hey who better to ask what to get at a vegan place than the workers"" 

For 1: dude was so annoyed I  asked. 
For 2: dude was so annoyed I even existed. 
For 3: dude made me legit sad I even came here
For 4: who tf hire dude???

Honestly, trashiest customer service from any one employee I have ever met. Rest were really nice and pleasant though. (Thats why I gave it 2 stars, go them for having a nicer rest of the staff)

Got my food at which point I gave them another chance. Just like my father's that second chance was for naught. Sucked so much it hurts to even give a writeup. I almost never picked up my phone in an effort to forget this moment of my life ever happened. 

But I really couldnt help feeling guilt for all the lives I could possibly save by writing this up (that parallel convergence with saving animal lives tho), so here I am. Save yourselves, it's too late for me.

A vegan food drive-thru spot? Twenty something years I've been waiting for this moment. I got off work early and knew today was the day. The whole way over I was giddy with anticipation, I couldn't get there fast enough.
       The hardest part of hitting up a new spot is what to order. What if what you order sucks?Do you come back again in hopes the next thing you order won't? So I always get like three things(which is always way to much food) but my feeling is it's worth it to go a little nuts the first go because if all three things suck, chances are, I'm not coming back. I went through the drive thru which could have been a little faster, but it's quality food so it was worth it, and the employees were super friendly.
 My order:
Single Veggie Burger: I really wanted to love this, but I'm not a fan of daiya cheese(the whole boogery/gritty consistency, lack of flavor/pungent tapioca flavor isn't my thing). The patty itself was delicious though, so next time ill opt for it w/o cheese.
Now for the good part...the Vegan Beef Sandwich. This is up there with one of the best sandwiches I have ever consumed. A delicious buttered bun (caramelized just on the edges so the bun still hold the chewiness without overdoing it), amazing veggie Beef, shredded carrot/daikon, jalapeño, Mayo and cilantro. I can't say enough good things about it. For years any time I would get a Vietnamese sandwich I'd order it w/ tofu, but the flavor and texture was never there. The Veggie Beef in this things is incredible. The texture and marinade are spot on. It's like the sandwich I've always dreamed about. My only complaint, next time I need to bring my bottle of hoisin sauce. Soo good on Vietnamese sandwiches.
     Fried zucchini was delicious. Not too greasy and the ranch was good. 
    Vegeway is definitely going to be seeing more of me. Next time I want to try the veggie chicken wrap, milkshakes, tacos, etc,etc, etc. Eventually I'll make it through the whole menu.

At that time this place was wicked good.  And, it became my go to ""fast food"" place to hit when I felt like a burger and not cooking.  So I've eaten Vege-Way no less than 20 times.  Recently, not sure if the recipe changed, but the ""burger"" is different.   Here's a few more observations over the 20 times I've visited.  First, I pretty much always hit the drive through and my conversations with the person over the speaker system go like this, I kid you not:  hey what can we get for you?  I'll have 2 cheeseburgers 1 order of French fries and 1 order of curly fries. Ok so do you want sauce with your chicken bites and zucchini? Um no. 2 cheeseburgers 1 order of fries and 1 curly fries.  Ok so I have a wrap, a double burger, you want cheese? And 2 fries.  Um no, I want 2 cheeseburgers 1 French fry and 1 curly fry.  Oh sorry do you want cheese?  On my cheeseburgers?  Yes I want cheese on my cheeseburgers, please.  Ok so I have 2 burgers with cheese and 2 fries.  Hmmm no. 2 cheeseburgers and 1 fry and 1 curly fry.  Oh ok got it.  Frustrating to say the least.  Second, when I first started going here the fries were great! And you got a decent portion for the $2.75 they cost. The last 4 times, the fries have been different cuts, different styles and different quantities. I got home and found I only had 20 fries in my order, yes I counted and I didn't eat them on the way home.  Third I've never seen the same person working there, ever.  And the drive through conversation is virtually the same each visit and the quantity and quality is different as well.  Hmmm.  Because of the fry issue I actually stopped ordering fries here and will stop somewhere else for fries which, takes all the air out of the sails of ""fast convenient"" food, when you have to hit 2 places.  Also makes me have to choose which item I wanna eat cold.  Another gripe, is cost.  Eating out is a luxury, but when you're eating fast food and never leave a place for under $20 for two and have to hit a second place to get sides and have to go through the painful drive through, you gotta ask, how convenient is it and why am I still gong and why am I spending the same for a burger and fries as say a nice sit down place with linen napkins?   Well I do love the place and love the concept even though I have to work to eat here.  


Vege-Way compares itself to In-N-out. By design- In-N-Out  for vegans!  Here's what the difference is and what In-N-Out does right that Vege-Way does not.   In-N-Out limited menu and secret menu. They limit what they produce so it's consistent and good every time, and the secret menu is genius.  Maybe there's a secret Vege-Way menu and why the drive through person never understands what I order.  In-N-Out is fast and convenient locations all over and you don't have to hit a second place unless someone in your crew wants chicken or something. The fries are always the same, always. And they are over flowing from the paper tub and I've never gotten cold ones, not ever in like 20 years of going there.  It is also cheap.  I mean the price has been virtually the same for that 20 years.  For less than $10 you can walk out full.  Vege-Way is no In-N-Out replacement, it is good if not inconsistent, and I love that I can get vegan eats on the go but some of the issues need to be ironed out.",1W6NBuKv-7myGDp6Ff7JGQ,1,0,3,bU_6huq5c4v3wo8cu0Oomw

I had a single burger I also had the popcorn chicken fried zucchini curly fries and regular fries LOL. I really wanted to try everything! All satisfied my taste buds.

Fried zucchini the tempura they put on it I don't know how they do but it was incredible. Popcorn chicken delicious nice texture and flavor and the sauce was amazing. My friend had a salad it looked incredible I took a picture. I did not taste it so all I know is she said she loved it.

They used to be great about this, but with this new wave of hires, they're now putting tomato in every single time, no matter how much I emphasize my allergy. Since these were To go, was not able to catch this before taking it home. Ended up having a severe reaction the first time they put tomato. 
Today we stopped by to grab sandwiches.. my chicken ranch was TINY, with only the patty, some super witty, almost bad lettuce, and the sauce tasted so expired I had to spit it out and could not continue eating.

My 2nd visit is the reason why I can't give them 5 stars. I ordered the vegan cheeseburger with a side of sweet potato fries of course, and the fried zucchini. The burger was good, but I've honestly had better. I added some hot chipotle sauce to add more flavor. 

I was very disappointed with the fried zucchini. It was greasy and overdone - some of the zucchini were soggy, and the batter just doesn't work. If chef could fix this and get inspired by Farmer Boy's fried zucchini 

I'll definitely be back - but not for the fried zucchini.

I was a little bit disappointed with the ambiance of the place because it looked like more of a Thai or Asian establishment. Now with that being said I do realize the owner of the location is Asian and in fact there is a sign posted in the establishment advising people to go to ""Veggie House"" which I assume is owned by the same family. 

I HIGHLY recommend the Double Double Burger.....Curly Fries.....and Drink for just under 10 bucks.....it is the best deal in the establishment in my opinion. We found out they are now serving Buffalo Chicken Sandwiches......Chicken Burgers with Ranch and Fish Sandwiches as well.....all VEGAN of course. My wife upgraded her meal for $2.50 more so she could try the Strawberry Milkshake...... I tried some of hers and it was just ""OKAY"". Be advised they use SOY and Almond Milk to make their Milkshakes so if you don't drink either of those milks then I wouldn't purchase the shakes.

Me and hubby's first time here after trying out Veggie House 3 times, and we were delightfully surprised on how good the food and service was. 

Environment: Very clean, new place. Not a huge place because you can drive thru and order!

Staff: Extremely friendly girl at the register and the rest was friendly saying goodbye.

Food: Selection isn't huge but you do have a selection of burgers, tacos, vietnamese style sandwich, milkshakes, fried sides (fries, sweet potato fries, popcorn chicken). 

Price: Decent. Burgers are pretty cheap for vegan food. Good deal with the meals (upgrade to a milkshake for $2.50)

1. Double burger: Burger was huge with cheese, 2 patties, onions, tomato and sauce. The patties were moist and flavourful, you can see the plant based ingredients. Wasn't dry and grainy. The only thing I didn't like was the cheese, it stuck to the roof of my mouth in a ""fake cheese"" feel. Overall the burger was fantastic and flavour was there. 

2. Sweet potato fries: Tasted like any other sweet potato fries. A bit soft but have a crisp.

3. Popcorn chicken: Fried perfectly. No seasoning on it but it comes with a dip and there is ketchup and sirarcha sauce on the side. Soy was moist but a bit stringy. 

4. Mango milkshake: Tasted artificial mango, like a gummy mango candy. I'm not a huge fan of that as a drink but if you like your candy/sweet then the mango is for you!

5. Strawberry milkshake: First sip tasted artificial to me, like syrup but there was strawberry seeds in it. It's not a pink color at all, more white. After a while it's pretty good, and VERY less sweet than the mango. Thick too, just the way I like my milkshakes. 

Overall, great food and price for vegan fast food style. Don't bee too picky, remember this is ALL VEGAN.",uXjrM5ooM9iOzVxWRzUswg,3,1,4,sbWcjUSCGTtbksF_EdahGQ

Since i'm unable to eat meat, i haven't been going to my usual spot for banh mi. However, i found this wonderful place! I believe everything at their place is vegan/vegetarian!

I cannot wait to come back tomorrow to try their cheeseburger! So if you're new to the ""no meat"" life and you miss the meaty burgers and sandwiches, go here!

*I really LOVE Veggie House and I love Chef Kenny so I am really bummed that I am rating VegeWay as low as I am. I was really expecting a better tasting experience. 

I am huge fan of vegan food and love veggie burgers, so naturally I make them pretty darn amazing. I was super excited to give VegeWay a taste as I do lot of vegan hopping around Vegas and have my regular favorites. 

My experience here, however, was as bland as it can possibly be. For $9+ you will get a small veggie burger of your choice (light or dark patty - some like to call it ""chicken"" or ""beef"", which drives me CRAZY that Vegan people would use animal references AT ALL when it comes to foods they eat. It's illogical and ridiculous), a choice of curly or French fries and a small drink. The combo is just way too expensive, considering that making a veggie patty is a lot cheaper than meat, unless you are a shady eatery that buys the cheapest industrially raised meat :(

I could look past the price ($11 with tip), if the sandwich is actually delicious beyond reason, which, sadly, it wasn't what-so-ever. The ""chicken""  patty is bland just enough to make you regret the purchase, but not enough to toss it. I finished it and can call this the least memorable food experience I've had recently. Which, again, makes me super sad because everything at the Veggie House is delicious (I was there again this week). 
When I ordered I asked if they have a spicy chicken patty and the cashier said they do and it's a buffalo chicken patty. I thought, GREAT! Love it. But when I bit into it it was just a plain bland patty, topped with the (also) bland Sriracha aioli. When I took the first bite, that aioli.... squirted out of the sandwich all over the tray, my clothes and my phone. I was really expecting a nice piece of (maybe) deep fried ""chicken""  with a super zesty, infused crust or a buffalo (red hot) sauce topping, but it was just the stuff they have at the condiment counter. Also, as I kept eating everything was falling out from between the buns. It was a huge mess and I just could not keep it contained. The buns, however, are very good and soft. 

This was not a tasty experience, it was a huge disappointment. I've definitely had way Way WAY better vegan ""fast food"" in Vegas, where flavor, quality and quantity are major highlights. 

Chef Kenny, please, try better. I'd most definitely recommend spice and herb infusion for the patties. There are a lot of great vegetable powders that can make these patties taste super delicious. Until then, I shall stay a regular at my regular vegan joints.

My sons like the popcorn chicken. I enjoyed the fish taco & strawberry shake.

Once I ordered, she said to pull around at the side. That was different. I drove around a couple times until I found a parking space. I guess that's the procedure considering how busy it was. It's nice to see a vegan place like this poppin. 

Overall the family was pleased. Grease on grease on grease. Perfect for those kind of days. When the kids want a fast food burger, this is the place. Everything I conjectured it to be.

I really wanted to like it, but it just fell short on every level. Drove up and the cashier over the intercom was super nice. I began to give my order and she seemed a bit confused and I figured she was training, which made sense, no big deal. A young man took over the order and I stated again that I wanted the single combo with regular fries, a Diet Coke and popcorn chicken. I pulled up to the window and the guy was nice, but he seemed confused as to what I ordered and asked again if I wanted something to drink, I said yes, a Diet Coke. It was a pretty short wait for my food. While waiting I started noticing some of the signage on the window about allergies, hours etc... but everything was posted on printer paper and taped up like something you'd find behind closed doors, not out front where the customers can see it. This is a little thing but it's a sign that the owner/manager doesn't take much pride in how communication is is conveyed to the guests. He handed the bag over and said thanks, I asked ""what about my Diet Coke?"" He said sorry and gave me my drink. Again, he was super nice but both staff members I spoke to seemed confused and there was only one other car in the drive through. I didn't think much of it and figured this could be just a random circumstance and didn't get bent out of shape over it.

Ok, now the food. The burger was good and I liked the patty, interesting flavor and texture. Bun was good, special sauce was good and fresh lettuce and tomato. Now the fries, they were undercooked and soggy, bummer. The popcorn chicken had zero seasoning in the batter and it tasted like plain tempura batter. The fact that there's no seasoning in the batter and the fries were soggy leaves me to believe that there may be a quality control issue. 

Here's the deal, if you're going to do a vegan version of In n Out Burger, you need to nail every order, every time. That's one reason why In N Out is so successful, great quality control and great food. Again, I really really wanted to like this place, but it just didn't hit the mark. I think a lot of people give it a pass because they are stoked about a vegan fast food place, but it's just not executed as well as it should be. Someone is gonna come along someday and open a concept just like this and do it right.

One last thing. I spent some time reviewing the negative reviews and I didn't see one reply from the management/owners addressing the issues. If you want to improve, you must engage with customers and learn from criticism. It's super important to read bad reviews and address common issues.",-EME_qgcJiDje9vwH2dBsg,5,0,3,90tZrSBHKkOc3ynRuA2rKg

Because - if you participate in any high energy activities (dancing, martial arts, yoga, meditating) after eating this crap - you will be drained energetically.

Burger patties are WAY INFERIOR to Gardein burger patties found at good quality vegan spots. Obviously those places charge more. BUT even when compared to other 'fast food vegan food', vegeway sucks.

You are literally poisoning your children when you bring them here. If you don't have time to go somewhere else, just fast. Seriously.

I tried the breaded deep fried Orange Chicken and this hit my throat really hard. Total filth.

I like the option to get my burgers wrapped in lettuce, but found the lettuce to be semi-fresh and somewhat stale. Not crisp and fresh.

Food here has the power to make you sick, especially if you have a clean system from eating a clean plant-based diet.

For starters I went to the drive through, with one car ordering ahead of me and another waiting at the window for their order.

I ordered the burger meal with curly fries and a vanilla milkshake and the total was $12.88.

It took 6 minutes from the time I drove up to the window to place the order over the speaker. 

The girl in the car behind me got out and asked me if this was normal waiting time for this restaurant, I'd never been here before and drove a long way to try it out based on reviews. 

She then went to the car in front of me which was at the window and asked the same, only to calculate the first car had been waiting 20 minutes from the time of their order. The people at the window were acting as if it wasn't a long wait or that there was a problem. By the time I got my order in hand, it was a total of 22 minutes, if you include my wait time to order, 28, so that's not fast food drive through. There were plenty of people working inside.

The girl who took my money took 3 minutes to count out my change . The whole thing was frustrating. 

As for the food, the burger was not hot, the cheese needs to be revisited, I like vegan food, this just didn't work well, it was a dry burger. The curly fries were semi warm and tasted fishy. The milkshake was great.

Chalking it up to a bad day, but customer service was substandard and the food wasn't up to par. Also the building looked dark and uninviting.

The spicy sauce was lack luster beyond belief, too many thick onions and tomatoes that made the bun wet!!!

I opted for the burger meal, with curly fries and a chocolate shake. The fries were some of the best I've ever had. The burger patty seemed to be made out of beans and rice, but it was still toothsome and meaty. With all of the accoutrements, it was a damn fine burger. The chocolate shake was a little icy, but still perfectly reminiscent of the fast food shakes I had growing up. Not fancy, not high quality, but still just what you want.

POPCORN CHICKEN AND MILKSHAKES (4.) three different types of fries and I honestly enjoy them all

Keep in mind that vegan fast food is not meant to be healthy, it is still fast food. But it would definitely be a healthier option in comparison to regular fast food. VegeWay allows anyone to have the fast food experience (greasy, fatty, salty, sweet, and you drive right through) without compromising plant based choices.

Let's all admit it after spending a weekend in Vegas binge drinking sometimes all you need is a fast-food style burger and fries (greasy and not particularly healthy HAHA). And being vegan and trying to find this is close to impossible.... until I was brought to VegeWay! 

My girlfriend had told me about this spot multiple times but we hadn't been to Vegas so when we finally got the chance to come out here you already know VegeWay was on our to-do list! I will start off by saying if you're looking for the normal healthy, low caloric, etc style of meal turn around lol this is the closest to a Big Mac/In-N-Out style of burger that you can get being vegan and I personally LOVED IT! Now I wouldn't eat here everyday but stopping by on our way out from Vegas is just perfect! 

When we arrived the first thing that caught my eye was that they have a wide selection of food. Ranging from burgers, ""chicken"" sandwiches, fries, popcorn chicken, zucchini fries, Bahn Mi, fish tacos, shakes, and salads. When we came we got two burgers, regular fries, curly fries, zucchini fries, popcorn chicken, and a bahn mi for the road (yes we like to try everything!). Here is what the consensus is: 

Burgers - 10/10 I'd definitely recommend getting the burgers here. They allow you to get a single patty or even a double. They also have a new burger with guacamole which we didn't do but based off how the burger alone tasted I'm sure guacamole wouldn't be a bad adder. The meat had a really good flavor and the sauce they add is the closest you can get to tasting like you're eating a Big Mac. 

Popcorn chicken - 10/10 I would say these are a solid choice to get. The pieces are pretty thick with a nice layer of breading and deep fried to perfection. The sauce that comes with the chicken is really good too (it was this Cajun sauce). 

Bahn Mi - 9/10 this had a lot of potential to be great but I think it was a bit dry in my opinion. They do put a sauce on it that tastes really good just not enough. 

Lastly of course the fries are good (like all fries are) and the zucchini fries were decent. I would just recommend getting fries unless you're in the mood for zucchini. 

So overall I would recommend anyone looking for a nice cheat meal to come here. Again don't come here looking for anything healthy lol and just a word of caution be ready to fork out a decent amount of cash as the prices are a little steep considering it's fast food.",g7OyXJJsDt11NhnRGJmGSQ,1,2,4,IZ84mG1mdyqewGUtvbNumA

The patties were a little softer than other vegan burgers I've had but super tasty. The fried zucchini had a light tempura batter and were just as good.

First of all, I enjoy Vegan eats and the lack of meat is not what's missing here. There was just nothing spectacular or even remotely special about this place or its food.

I selected the Double V Burger Meal with Curly Fries and a Drink ($9.89). Certainly not a cheap meal. The burger was ugly and a far cry from their photos (I thought this only happened at major fast food brands?). Their patties are misrepresented as the real product is extremely thin, plus, the fresh vegetables were almost non-existent (there was seriously a leaf of lettuce that didn't even over the size of the bun and these buns are not big). The bottom line, it didn't taste great. It wasn't bad, but I'm certain that it has nearly the same amount of calories/sodium as its non-Vegan counterpart and totally not worth it. To add to the already insulting meal, the side of fries was dismal and probably the same ones you find in the grocery store's freezer section. 

If you're looking for a Vegan place based solely on the fact that you do not consume animal products, then, it's here (though there are so many better Vegan restaurants in town).

When I took a bite I could not believe how delicious is was!  It had the texture of beef, the flavor was on point, & I felt good eating it! 

My boyfriend was starting to get tired of eating vegan so I suggested this place & so we ordered dinner here and got the burger, beef sandwich, popcorn chicken, & orange chicken.  To his surprise he couldn't believe it was vegan either!

Then I came on here to check the reviews on here to check out the menu and hoping to find more information on what's in their ingredients.  I thought there was a little hope with the signs posted saying if you have any food allergic, please inform them.  I know I can't eat at a lot of vegan, vegetarian place because they are soy and nuts central.  I don't think my husband thinks of it like that besides no meat and healthy diet.  I told them, I'm highly allergic to soy and nuts.  I asked the guy at the counter if it's safe to eat the soy free burger with my allergy.  He's not sure and asked someone else.  The girl gave me a really vague response.  I should be ok, but we have signs up to say you should be careful eating our food.  We don't add nuts in anything, but some of the food does have almond milk in the sauce or part of the recipe.  I personally know 80% of all buns has soy in it unless the make sure they an order somewhere for no soy buns or make it themselves without soy.  They're not sure themselves.  Then my next question is, what oil do they use?  The guy said soybean oil.  How do they make a soy free burger with soy?  It's possible they use their soybean oil for the patties and they might have soy in their buns.  They're not 100% sure.  I didn't end up eating anything here, since I don't want to have an allergic reaction to the food.  I did insist my husband to still try out the food, if he does like it, I can just do a drive thru pick up for him.  He go the double vegan burger with curly fries and drink for $10.71 tax included.  He said the curly fries were good.  The burger itself had no taste, it was very bland.  It's like eating buns with an omelette without any seasoning.  He did add their mayo sauce to it.

I took some non-vegetarians there to open their palates to new, delicious, meat-less foods while we were visiting in Las Vegas - but we were all sorely disappointed.

Coming here to Chef Kenny's place was an exciting event. A couple of things off the bat, ""Turn the MUSIC down.""  And where are all the chairs and tables?

I have to review this as a fast food place, and not just a vegan place. 

1. Choices - The choices are similar to any fast food place, burgers, double burgers, burger meal deals, popcorn chicken.  There were sweet potato fries and curly fries as well as milkshakes.  Really interesting was the fish taco, a beef sandwich something like a Bahn Mi and a chicken wrap! Heck, you can even buy frozen patties to bring home... That is great. 

2.  If you are- having a hankering for fast food, a burger, fries and a shake, this is a great place to come and get your fix!

3.  If you are - not only a vegan, but watching what ingredients you are putting into your body, then I would caution you that this is first and foremost a fast food place.  Fried, deep fried, heinz ketchup (vegan, but with corn syrup....) and so all the ingredients are well, as normal as you can get for a vegan.

For me, i think that having fast food and being vegan, this is a great choice.  However, I would say, as a place to go and have a great meal, this would not be my first, second or third choice.  I found the music over bearing, the decor a bit trashy and really not too thoughtful, a lack of chairs and tables, I thought the service was a bit slow, the sweet potatoes way over cooked, and the curly fries were okay.  The chocolate shake was pretty good. The hamburger was very, very cheesy, and overly cheesy.  The fish tacos were pretty darn good.

I just did not feel that this was a place I will continue to eat at. However, when the vegan daughter has a need for greasy, junk food, I am gonna take her here and be proud of it. GK says check it out, just be aware like most fast food places, it is what it is.  This place was to me the equivalent of a McDonalds or Burger King and has a way to go for that In and Out type of quality, taste and ambiance.

I love love LOVE when new vegan restaurants open up! It made me even more happy to see a line around the corner for their drive thru on opening day. While I usually don't like when vegan spots use soy to replace everything meat-like (yes, soy is in everything here), I had to give this place a try. I tried their fish tacos and a burger. I thoroughly enjoyed all the toppings on the taco, and the ""fish"" did taste exactly like fish to me. When the burger came out, I was a little disappointed that I didn't get any lettuce or tomato. I told the cashier, ""I ordered mine with everything."" He then lifted the bun to show me that, indeed, there was a thin slice of tomato and a little piece of lettuce inside my burger. I was then reminded that this is fast food. If this were a nice sit down restaurant, I would have had a problem with this. You cannot go to this place and expect great restaurant quality meals. Do not go to this place and expect healthy vegan meals either. Vegeway is fast food, as it advertises itself to be. 

That may or may not be your cup of tea, but the concept is fantastic! Vegeway is a vegan restaurant that is clearly unhealthy; however, I would much rather have people eat unhealthy plant based food than unhealthy animal based food. This place is a great way for non-vegans/meat-lovers/fast food goers to incorporate some less damaging veganism into their lives!",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,6,4,4,i0kjefBb-28DPPvPRBGXQg

4996155,2016-09-22,3,vodCM302JJ_P9yJt1WuH_w,"I give very few 5-star reviews, but this place definitely deserves one -- excellent vegan food served drive-thru or at the counter with indoor seating, friendly service, all at a very reasonable, actually inexpensive price!

I arrived around 7:45PM on a Wednesday, 2 days after their soft opening & 2 days before their official grand opening.  The drive-thru was busy, and there were a lot of customers inside, but the wait in-line was brief & the counter staff was very friendly.

I ordered a Double burger meal, so that came with fries (I chose curly) & a soft drink -- all for about $10!  

A small table had become available after I ordered, so I sat down after filing my cup with Dr Pepper, & waited for my order # to be called.  It took about 10 minutes -- very reasonable based on how busy the place was.

I added ketchup & mustard, refilled my drink with Raspberry Iced Tea & sat down to enjoy the meal.

I've been a vegetarian for almost 30 years, having all sorts of vegetarian & vegan burgers over the decades.   Some people prefer the type that do have similar consistency & flavor of beef, some prefer those made more of a mix of vegetable products & that don't really have the flavor of beef.    I tend to fall into the former category, and the burger was absolutely phenomenal!  The only downside is that it was pretty messy to eat -- the (vegan) cheese product made the two vegan meat patties slip & slide.

The fries were good but nothing all that special, and I learned the hard way that the Raspberry iced tea machine needs to be calibrated better, as the liquid product barely had tea or raspberry flavors (compared to the identical machine at other places).

After wolfing down my food, I was in a feeding frenzy.   I wanted another burger.   Turns out the guys at the table next to me were thinking the same thing.   It's not because there wasn't enough food in our initial orders, it was because the burgers tasted so good!

I ended up getting two more double burgers to go, & brought them home.    It's very tempting to eat one right now at 3:30AM but I'm fighting the temptation.   Even with two Double burgers in my refrigerator, I'm somewhat planning on my return trip to VegeWay.      For better or worse, it's on the opposite side of LV from me & in an area that I just haven't had a need to be in often.

But the food/price at VegeWay is so nice that unlike most other restaurants, this place will be a destination for me & I expect to be a frequent customer.

If you're a vegetarian/vegan that tries to avoid food that has the texture & flavor of meat & poultry, you don't have a need to try VegeWay.  Otherwise though, you should definitely try it.  Even if you're not a vegan/vegetarian, you should give their food a try if you're curious.   

On a future visit, I'll give some of their other products a try.

Obviously, as a vegan restaurant, the clientele is rather limited.  However, there are enough of us in the LV area to keep this place fairly busy, even after the newness  wears off.     

Think of it kind of like an In & Out Burger place for vegans & vegetarians -- comparatively inexpensive, flavorful food & friendly, intelligent staff.  The drive-thru lines can get kind of long & the strip mall parking lot isn't really set-up for long drive-they lines.   Also the interior seating area is kind of small, so especially at prime-time lunch & dinner hours, the place may be crowded, however based on my experience last night, the wait isn't bad, & very much worth it.

They do have wifi for customers, but it's secured so I guess you have to ask for the password (it wasn't posted).

The only negative thing I can think of is that the vegan milkshakes looked kind of small for the $5 price, but maybe that's just me being a cheapskate.

There are plenty of nice, expensive vegan/vegetarian restaurants in Vegas, but the only place I know for sure I'll show-off to my vegan & vegetarian friends that come to town will be VegeWay, & I'd love to have my carnivore friends give it a try too.",8KWR1qLgN2rTZ4VSGW9yvg,7,4,5,gbmRQnLRBWqEXGzHYGk_XA

Do yourself a favor and try them.

I must say that the location itself could use some improving though. There are few tables, all of them small, and it is utterly uninviting the way they have set it up. They all but encourage you to just use the drive thru or place your order to go on account of the poor interior. It may look new but the floorplan is doing them no service here.",7LdHbcbVImxsnRFjWooYkQ,1,0,4,SFEvqWCFtVMBh9kP1pmMVA

I got the popcorn chicken with sweet potato fries and a chocolate milkshake and I give it a 5/5. The only reason I'm giving Vegehouse 4/5 stars is because my girlfriend got a cheeseburger and we're really not fans of the Daya American Cheese. It has a very sweet aftertaste. It would be amazing if VegeWay found an alternative cheese.
Other than that, this place is so cute, has great food and kind service. It's fast food but doesn't have the grimy feel that Burger King and those places have.

5147536,2017-09-14,0,vodCM302JJ_P9yJt1WuH_w,"Hi Yelpers. I recently took the trip to VegeWay's Centennial's location. I cannot comment on the décor of the inside, I decided on the drive-thru. I decided to go with three stars on this review, so bare with me and I will explain why. For starters, let me begin by stating for the record, that I was somewhat mislead by the ""name"" and with that the trouble began.  

So let me begin with the food was okay, not the best I've ever had and certainly not the worst I've ever had. I realized very quickly that I wasn't eating from a traditional ""vegetarian restaurant"", but more so a restaurant that specialized in ""meatless options"". Two completely different types of establishments. This place in my option is for meat eaters who want to take a break from eating meat once in awhile. 

My order: 
I ordered the double cheese burger combo, and upgraded to the sweet potato fries and a strawberry tea. The burger was good, and fries were hot and the tea was good. The smell was amazing and I couldn't wait to get my food home to take a bite. During the ride back home, I reached in and grabbed a few fries and they were slathered in ""GREASE"". Now, I realize that they had to cook the fries which involves frying them, but I could taste the grease and had to blot out the fries. Once I arrived home, I open the meal and dumped the fries out on paper towel to save my save the trouble of blotting the fries one by one. Overall, the burger was good but it also dripped oil and was quite messy. I realized quickly that it wasn't worth spending $12 bucks for a meatless greasy burger, fake cheese and greasy fries. I didn't feel healthy at all, I ended up with a stomach ache. 

The review is a honest one, which is my opinion. I would urge everyone to go and try this place. I was impressed with the taste of the meatless burger, and for that reason I gave the place ""3 stars"" but for anyone who watches what they eat like I do and cares about their caloric intake skip what I had and maybe go with another menu option. I'll pass since I limit my consumption of fried foods, but to each their own.",tECqAaACQDUz-sDG_Eh3aQ,3,0,3,H-VDoQ7rEjqs7fktX3I2hA

Don't get me wrong, I like the concept and maybe other things on the menu are better, but not what we got. 

Redeeming grace though are the curly fries. Curly fries make anything better and they at least did them right.

I'm normally not a fan of Daiya cheese, which has its own not-quite-cheese flavor to it. In the burger however, it just works. It does stick to your teeth a little, but worth a little flossing for the flavor it adds.

Fast forward to half a year later and becoming vegan for almost 5 months, my palate has definitely changed (or the establishment has gotten better since they opened) and I was very impressed after trying the Hawaiian Burger - super tasty, juicy, onions were caramelized nicely - and the Beef Bahn Mi sandwich. The next day we came back to try the Double Vegan Burger and the chicken burger (but they mistakingly gave us the single vegan burger instead - but I guess shame on us for not double checking our drive thru order).

My boyfriend and I ordered a cheese burger each and shared curly fries after hearing they weren't currently doing their monster fries. And it was just not good. It wasn't even that the patty wasn't convincing (which it wasn't), it just overall wasn't good in terms of taste, texture, and appeal. Even their curly fries didn't match up to similar fast food chains that their trying to emulate, and neither their sauces. The house made ketchup, v-mac sauce, and chipotle were weak or tasteless. Everything I tried here was just undoubtedly inferior to their non-vegan counterparts. 

I just think this place is trying too hard to be something it's not. I know that's the concept, but the only way I can imagine someone enjoying the food here are vegans who've completely forgotten the taste and texture of meat, cheese, and butter.

Even that pair of bovines advocating ""Eat Mor Chikin"" 20 years ago would be happy about everything served at Vegeway.

So it has been a few months since my last visit to Vegeway, it was cold and slightly breezy (perfect weather for everything except passing the time watching all the hunnies show off what they've been training off-season for) and I dropped in after a Yelp gathering for their limited time holiday inspired milkshake: Peppermint Oreo.  To be honest, it was not what I envisioned but it tasted very good and didn't even last 10 minutes on the drive home.

Fast forward to the dreaded summer heat of early June, I am already not a fan and it is only in the 90s around 11am. I was running some errands, got a little lost driving around and decided to just grab something at Vegeway for brunch, since I was only a mile or two away.

As I was about to walk in, a customer was just coming out and said ""they are not opened."" I was not expecting that, and although I believed him I still opted to go inside and ask when they are going to be open. Which turned out to be 11am, instead of 10:30am that is posted on Yelp (I have since sent a business update request to YELP HQ), so I just waited the 15 minutes inside and enjoy their AC and check their menu for what I would order later.

I was going to get two Double Vegan Burgers, until I saw the new item being promoted: Hawaiian Cheese Burger. So I order one of each of these burgers, a Chocolate and Vanilla Vegan Milkshake and added Vegan Popcorn Chicken (so I can charge it to my CC, because it would be super embarrassing and a hassle not being able to pay the $2 and change I still owe in cash after using up $14 in Groupon credit.

The Chocolate and Vanilla Milkshake is an easy custom order for them to whip up, and it felt extra refreshing sipping it in the dry heat. Most people probably wouldn't even notice that it is vegan, but it is.

The Hawaiian Cheeseburger comes with a ring shaped pineapple from the can, which was good. But had that pineapple been fresh or just grill it to caramelized the natural sugar inside, it would have made that burger even better.

The Double Vegan Cheeseburger was pretty substantial. Eating it Zi noticed stuff sticking to the roof of my mouth more than when I am having a regular burger, but overall it is enjoyable and I was quickly getting full.

The Popcorn Chicken was decent. The batter reminds me of the ones coating the Sweet and Sour Pork at local Chinese takeouts, which is thicker than I 'd prefer, but not horrible. The dipping sauce that it was served with, I was not a fan of, so I ate most of it at home with the sweet chili sauce often served with Thai BBQ chicken. It was good eating it that way.

Overall, it is a good healthier alternative to just eating meat all the time, and my wait was nearly non-existent and the nice friendly service just made the entire getting-lost-and-that's-how-a-nice-guy-like-me-ended-up-at-a-place-like-this kind of day that much more pleasant. Or the Vegan deity in the sky pulled some cosmic strings and steered me in the door. Either way it was a charming experience and no chikin or cows were hurt to make my visit possible.
