1368034,2018-05-24,1,YJJeB-cVzLuyn1FfJxpS5g,"This restaurant does not serve Dim Sum. I'm not sure if the lack of offering Dim Sum is due to rising cost or if it's a result in the change of management. The interior space is beautifully designed with a vibrant cerulean blue wall, attractive paintings, an array of hung Japanese parasols, and an artsy cinematic film scroll featuring food and travel. I notice the restaurant space is quite expansive, they have a huge bar, lots of table seating with plenty of lighting, and one can definitely host a big catering party event. It just makes me wonder why is the place so empty, there is hardly any customer. 

I went for the Eggplant Szechuan Garlic Style ($14.95) which has eggplant sautéed with red bell pepper, scallion, onion, dried mushroom, and bamboo shoots in Szechuan sauce, and also got an order of Singapore Style Fried Rice Vermicelli ($12) which is rice noodles sautéed with chicken, onion, scallions, red bell pepper, bean sprouts, and scramble egg in curry sauce. The food is delicious. The Eggplant Szechuan Garlic Style taste amazing, I like how the eggplant is sautéed well and it's so soft and very flavorful. The Singapore Style Fried Vermicelli has good tender chicken and I like the veggies that came with it. My only suggestion is that they add a little more curry spice on the noodles to elevate the flavor. An order for a side of rice to eat with eggplant and requesting for hot tea is an additional charge. I just find it rather strange that they would charge for hot tea. At other Asian restaurant, hot tea is usually offered as complimentary with the meal. 

In regards to service, I feel it's a little slow but the dine-in atmosphere is nice and very intimate. The manager comes by to check up and see how everything is. I had refills on my hot tea and the food portions are plentiful. I am happy with my order and I wouldn't mind returning for the same dish as these are my personal favorites.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,1,1,4,UfsU7yRAfTi6CN6Y3PGZJA

East Ocean, which served dim sum in carts, has now become a muddled mess (especially by rebranding it something as generic as ""Asia Palace""). They no longer serve proper dim sum but made things to order. Everything tasted bland and microwaved. Even the sesame balls - which were previously the best I've had - are just horribly mediocre now.

And they've removed the chicken feet! Incredible. They literally just crossed it out from the menu.

It's a massive disrespect to what was once the best dim sum in the Vegas area. I would not recommend this to anybody, even people who don't particularly care about dim sum that much. Spend your money elsewhere.",WGSBv8GM8Z144lSRV0_PJQ,4,0,1,pcYxLW71gRzxjeKNBsC8Qw
3181468,2018-02-07,0,YJJeB-cVzLuyn1FfJxpS5g,"Limited dim sum selections and the four dishes we picked had one taste in common, SWEET.  The chow fun (expensive) was overloaded with sweetener.  We don't mind paying $12 for a small plate of rice noodle without meat if it tasted decent.  Maybe we don't have the ""fusion"" taste bud.  The Phoenix Talons (chicken feet) and the fried glutinous rice dumplings were overly sweet.  The rice dumplings looked and tasted like they were re-fried.  We also ordered xiaolongbao steam buns (XLB) and the 3 pieces nestled in their individual foil container looked very much like the ones sold by Trader Joe's.  The 3 XLB's looked identical like machine made and not hand made.  We asked the waitress for the usual vinegar dip with julienne ginger.  She responded ""we don't use that here"".  She came back and landed a bottle of red vinegar with the look/attitude like we are some village bumpkins that don't know what XLB's are.  The same waitress came back, placed our order slip on the table and made a loud tap with her fingers.  I am sorry we are not sophisticated diners and that we offended the establishment.

You have to order the dim sum- not available on steam trays rolling around like most dim sum restaurants. After ordering, the dim sum arrived very quick.

The main attraction, however, was the food!   We started out with a few dim sum, excellent flavor and texture.  Then came the spicy Szechuan beef with broccoli (savory and delicious), followed by the best tofu, mushrooms and vegetables that I had ever had.  Finally, there was the shrimp in noodles which was terrific!  The one thing that was apparent was the quality of the ingredients, no aftertaste from the beef which in other Chinese restaurants has been chemically tenderized.  No MSG, either!

4331570,2018-02-04,3,YJJeB-cVzLuyn1FfJxpS5g,"Where do I start? Well, first I was looking for East Ocean and saw that Yelpers reported it as closed.  I then found out it was replaced by ""Asia Palace"".  No big deal - appears to be the same restaurant - Chinese food with Dim Sum.

Well, when I came there were less than a handful of Yelp reviews (of which were no good anyway) but I figured I'd give them a chance.  Very regretfully - I brought a friend who really likes dim sum and my family here.  Seems like they cleaned up the place a little bit and tried to make it a little more classy.  We were greeted by a few familiar faces from the old East Ocean restaurant (also note that their dim sum menu still says East Ocean on it).  Apparently this is an Asian Fusion restaurant that also serves ""dim sum""

Well anyway - we were there for the dim sum so we asked for the dim sum menu.  Other yelpers are correct in that they don't push the carts around anymore (which to me is part of the dim sum experience anyway).. half the items on the menu were crossed off with a marker.. WTH.. no chicken feet, no congee among other things.  We proceeded to try the few items that were not crossed out.. let's just say the items that were normally steaming hot now taste microwaved and the fried items are well.. fried to hell.  Big disappointment.  I pretty much figured out that they've eliminated items that take a long time to prepare and replaced them with things they could either fry or microwave quickly.

Oh, also another big disappointment - they couldn't/wouldn't serve us tap water for ""health reasons"" ... does this mean your water isn't even safe to drink let alone cook with? Good thing they talked a couple of us into buying Cokes but where did the water come from to make the ice cubes?

Way to make the place look fancy with a bar area and a roped off wannabe ""classy"" dining area and completely destroy the food.  I'm sure this would be a cool place to hang out but their food/menu and water situation is a mess.  I'm surprised the health inspector hasn't shut them down for having non-potable water.  What a disappointment after going to what once was the best dim sum restaurant on this side of town.  Mark my words, this place is going downhill fast.  At least the waitress was nice.

So, dim sum. What's the first thing that comes to mind when describing dim sum? The carts? It is for me and my family. And guess what? THERE ARE NO CARTS. We were SO confused. The server came up to us and asked us what we wanted to order almost immediately after we were seated. They gave us a one page laminated menu with pictures and names of the dim sum options but what the heck!!!!! So messed.

Obviously that threw us off but it just kind of set of this weird vibe for the rest of the meal. I guess we can't deal with change lol.

First off, the entire time we were in the restaraunt, there were workers(?) unapologetically drilling right next to us. They didn't even seem to think that it might bother their customers. It seems that they were fixing all of the empty chairs that no one was sitting in (probably because no one wants to be subjected to an earful of drilling sounds while trying to eat). Additionally, to make things even better, the food was horrendously mediocre. For the price I paid (which was not cheap), I expected at least decent food but that was definitely not the case. The wonton noodle soup I ordered felt like it was freshly unfrozen and plopped in some lukewarm chicken stock. I also discovered burnt pieces of who-knows-what in the fried rice.

To my surprise, they did a pretty good job on the food.  Asia Palace serves some pretty authentic Chinese food.  Yes the other reviews mention lack of Dim Sum variety, which is true.  We ordered straight off the regular menu, which had a good 100+ items.   We even ordered a roast duck, which only took them 15 mins to whip up.  So to set some expectations for future visitors - they just don't have the army of carts and old ladies yelling out ""Su mai!!"" that you see at other dim sum places.  Go for the regular menu if you want some good food.

The -2 stars is for service, which was practically inexistent.  It takes a really long time to flag down a server.  They had asked us if we wanted tea.. when there was already tea on our table.  The people were not the most friendliest.  Dare I say that's what makes it an authentic Chinese restaurant?  When we paid, they collected our CC and then forgot about us.
