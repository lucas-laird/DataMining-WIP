Albert, a co-owner was super friendly and helpful in recommending and teaching us some new games and even joined us as a third player when he had a few minutes. We played patchwork, herbaceous, guess who, and diamonds and will definitely be back for another day of escape from the hot summer sun!",Ugg-TOjj1EXJ0jZJXiFVXw,0,0,5,YRRci1Y4Y4Twd2r9m7U5pg
1403908,2017-07-21,0,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,This place is awesome! The staff/owners are super accommodating and I love all the cool events they set up. We have a lot of fun there!,49ujkyMRcGtTXcF9hTApHg,3,0,5,god1n7OMjUxsz-I9Mk4zoQ
1491779,2017-12-09,0,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,"I'm super bummed this place is closing down.  Amazing couple that runs it and there are so many games!!! They'll help you learn how the game works so you're not super confused, and they even have games I haven't seen in a long time! We don't have anything like this in Vegas, and I'm so sad to see it go.  Maybe we weren't ready for this, but hopefully it will work out soon.",bOHx6q63sD0jhtV3CLolhA,1,1,5,miDU6ktHo6dM2I0Wz3FmbA
1979122,2017-06-11,0,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,"Tables BGS is a brand new board game cafe. For $5 a day or a $25/month membership, you can play an endless amount of board games with your friends and family. They have a variety of options for every type of board gamer. The tables vary in lengths to accommodate game sizes and your party. The environment is welcoming and they support local businesses in the Las Vegas valley and include craft sodas and snacks from local businesses. Tables BGS has a great staff of knowledgeable ""ludologists"" that will assist in trying a new game and teaching the rules.",4a8gIW8HD8L2IGyK-O5mYA,5,0,5,782D1raxhi2gqiG6s1zzGQ
3043233,2017-06-14,0,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,"Finally, a place to play board games in my area of town! They literally JUST opened up, but already things look great and they have an awesome selection of games (which will obviously get much bigger as time goes on).

The cafe/bar aren't set up yet -- as I said, it's new -- but I can't wait! Even while we wait, I actually really dig the craft sodas and outside-the-box, high-quality snacks they offer. I was sick of being treated like a tasteless slob as a board gamer, haha.

I've met both of the owners, and they're super friendly and willing to teach pretty much any game. They're so passionate about games that they asked if they could watch a turn or two of one of their favorite games after they teached it to my girlfriend and me.

Highly recommend checking it out!",KMAI8qT7LUKFrZCqEMqFfA,3,0,5,hW81hb0TJsQ_f9wyRtU99Q
3183284,2017-08-11,0,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,Just amazing! I love that I can take my child here and play games all day for only five dollars per person. They also offer monthly memberships as well. The selection of games is almost overwhelming! My family tried a new game called bullfrogs and though it took me a little while to learn the rules it was worth the effort! Quite a few tables for gaming and snacks are available for a fee.  The customer service is nice and the clientele is friendly. We will be visiting again soon.,cBuulx2XmLgK1UdxBH-F6Q,0,0,5,djmpjyW2eoAALIgrn9Fv4A
3213778,2017-06-23,0,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,"This store is filled wall to wall with an amazing game selection from the normal day to day games like Monopoly, Clue and things like that to the most intense strategy games that take hours to complete. The staff is knowledgeable and courteous and the environment is comfortable with great tables and chairs. They carry local snacks and craft sodas for your snacking and drinking delights.",33WZI4ZIO9sNLK-JKuOX5Q,0,0,5,a4mLq80wcPt5OBPVeEDyuw

3890766,2017-07-28,0,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,"Love love love it here! The selection of board games is vastly bigger than other board game parlors I've visited. There's water available, which is nice during the summer heat and long hours of table top gaming. $5 for as long as you want to play, too! It's wonderful for a first date, hang out with friends, or even for parents and children. It can get pretty loud when there's a full building, so you must be prepared to talk louder if needed. We received a lot of help from the staff while playing games. They are attentive and customer oriented. They also made sure to clearly explain the rules and were knowledgeable about strategies. If I lived in Vegas, I'd be here weekly for sure.",jkfYfwtJBUamD-j5-QOvEQ,4,1,5,_Md0glnfSpcCu4YS9a-9Iw

This place is great! Price is extremely reasonable. The facilities are the cleanest I've seen in any board/card gaming shop/cafe. The staff was friendly and was happy to recommend and teach barebones of games when they are free. 

Please go and enjoy!! 

They have a huge game selection and they are all in great condition! Please keep their products in good condition! 

Ahhhhhh!!! This place is awesome!!!!!!",T8-iKejkXvC8CFNLgtvk5A,0,0,5,TsQHj1v-1I2KaNA3287yiA
5498610,2017-06-21,1,2aPbaa0FFbN9AdPtxHqbVg,"The table board game craze is here baby!! I'm super happy yet another board game spot has opened up. They have just opened but already have a wide selection of board games. They also are going to be acquiring more so if they are missing your favorite let them know. They are knowledgeable of pretty much all the games. Also pretty much there usually is someone there who knows. 

Whether you are a big group or two people there's room for you. Didn't seem overcrowded and they also have snacks and soda from local companies. They do not prepare food due to some regulations however there are restaurants nearby and with your wrist band you can step out and return. They also have memberships available if you will be going a lot. They also have a sign you can put on your table to let people know you are open to have people join you. We ended up meeting some great guys and playing some new games I never played before.
I love playing board games and meeting new people who share interest in board games. Game on!",1AYTQ-XpQwvbbShaXorsQA,6,2,5,dulAnEJUS-W5SoNfO7SD1g
