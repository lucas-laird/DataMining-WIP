Also like the noddles and the broth. The owner said they use lots of cow bones to make the broth and that made it so special. No wonder I won't feel thirsty after having a bowl of noddles.

Sadly, we were the only customers at prime dinner hour says tons of what others must think.  Place needs more hands on management.  Ordered their steamed fish.  ""It is so popular that we ran out"".  Poor planning or poor excuse.  Neither is acceptable.  Ordered shrimp with chili and moo shu pork.  Both very tasty and decided to splurge on the tea ceremony.  The ""ceremony"" must be a way to fleece big bucks from a gullible public (like me) with price of small and I mean small pot of tea costing from $12 up to almost $20.  Not much of a ceremony either but the tray and tiny cups were interesting.  They provided tiny tissues for napkins that I would be ashamed to present to any of my guests and then for what this restaurant charges for the food reflects on their whole philosophy.

I came in yesterday by accident and was totally impressed with the signature niu-gu noodle soup. It was great soup base, good noodles and a big beef rib with it. Meat easily fell off the bone with chopsticks/ forks. It was 5 stars good they got me back again today.

Today I tried their self claimed greatest steamed xiaolong bao and I added a chicken cold dish appetizer. The appetizer is mediocre, a lot of MSG so it has a fake taste to it. Another notable fact is it contains a lot of chicken fat, so it didn't taste as light as it should be as a cold plate appetizer.

The Xiao-long bao was not as impressive as I expected. It was plain and tasteless after the MSG plate. I even want to say the meat was not as fresh so it had a weired taste to it. Today's experience was a total let down. I average two days of experience to give it a 4.

I definitely will go back for the noodle soup again but I will not try anything else.",EuWsy43_q1Liahu-0FtfrQ,0,0,4,dU0ue7Xxl4IDFWyrjBxTWg

1566908,2015-09-23,1,brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA,"There's a new player to the Vegas ramen scene and its Niu-Gu! Rather in my opinion its more of a chinese beef noodle soup fusion with japanese ramen but still super tasty. So whats unique about this ramen place is that their soup base is beef so you won't get your typical japanese tonkotsu (pork) ramen here. What I like about the beef base is that its not as greasy or heavy as the pork so I leave feeling much cleaner.. almost like drinking chicken soup. Aside from the beef stock base, it also comes in 3 different flavors, original, miso, and lemon pepper. I was able to try both the original and miso. I favor the miso more because the broth is a little more richer than the original but both are quite good. Just like at other japanese ramen places, you can add in ingredients such as egg, corn, broccoli etc. The portion size is just right and comes with green onion, bean sprouts, and 5 pieces of beef. The beef is very tender and soft much like the cha-shus you get at other places. They do serve some appetizers and some rice dishes but I wasn't able to try any of them.  Service was good but that may be because we were the only customers. Hopefully this place gains some popularity since I feel like its a very good alternative to japanese ramen.",cdCvHUFdssePxowTHIo3dQ,4,3,5,n3WfzAyTR2NTepmUydrnNQ

The restaurant to start off has great food, therefore giving the three stars. The service was excellent and attentive.

Service:
Had food on the table within 10 minutes which was astounding. Water refilled promptly. Great attitude.

Food:
Delicious, nice portions, beautiful plating in Chinese food standards.

Management:
Too many servers standing around this small restaurants. 

Problems:

Following is why they are missing two stars for me. The decor is not in the same class level as what they are trying to perceive themselves as. The English menu offered to me was very confusing. It shouldn't have been made in a French 5-course meal format. The ""Main Dishes"" section could easily be seen as per person opposed a Chinese dish that everyone shares. 

The Owner lady of the store was with her friends at a separate table drinking tea and talking very loudly with her iPad playing drama. Shouldn't there be professionalism or a office for that?",4ARwcluRdI346WJhMB5eBw,0,0,5,QwJvd9iAxN1MxLCvFYCtxA
1673280,2016-01-09,7,brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA,"Let me preface this review by saying that this business wasn't my intended destination. CES crowds took over most of the restaurants in this plaza and my options were limited after being turned away at two other places. 

Menu is exclusively on iPad, and the pictures are helpful. Translated dish names aren't always accurate though. Menu is a bit limited, specialties appear to be their short rib and lamb shank, which look awesome but take 25-35 minutes to prepare, according to my server. I didn't have that kind of time, I was getting hangry.

BEEF TONGUE APPETIZER: This is a cold tongue app, which isn't entirely clear when ordering. Sliced and served carpaccio style with a fiery sauce and chopped peppers and onions. Once my tastebuds got over the initial shock of the cold and the spice, they decided this was decent.
SHORT RIB NOODLE MISO SOUP: Unclear whether this is intended to be ramen. Other reviews call it ramen, and it has broth-noodles-meat like ramen, and you can add on corn, seaweed, and egg like ramen. But the broth was very light and flat, lacked the richness (for better or worse) that I typically associate with ramen. Noodles were okay, nothing special. Short rib was good, fair portion.
""SALTED DUCK CABBAGE"": I misunderstood this dish. Photo shows a heap of cabbage, I assumed from the name that the duck was under it. This is just a vegetable dish, and the sauce is made of duck egg yolks. It was fairly tasty, but once I knew what it was made of and how rich it must be, I tried to limit my consumption. 

Execution needs work, all dishes seemed to need a bit of refinement. Space is clean but devoid of decor. Service is a little helpful with the ordering process but not particularly attentive. Hot tea was oddly served in tall drinking glasses and never refilled. Owner cashed us out and was enthusiastic and informative, wish he had been present for our whole visit.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,13,3,QlREUeGhDFSlmH0Lh1rA0g
1743855,2016-07-01,0,brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA,"Extremely Disappointing

Noodle Soup: $9 - Noodles were thin, not good. Their broth was good but half of the amount of broth one would expect at any decent ""authentic"" Chinese restaurant. 

Owner spent 5 minutes explaining how great their Diver Scallops were, so I ordered one to try with my main dish and after 15 minutes the Owner returned to say they didn't have any Diver Scallops? 

Main entrée was a chicken kung pao chicken which was quite bland, I asked if it was made with breast meat and it came with mostly dark meat. I had to ask for chili sauce and it helped but all I could hear from the kitchen from that point on was ""Hot Sauce!"" $!#$ $@$#$ ""Hot Sauce"" must of upset the chef to ask for this? : ] Standard ask if the food is not happening!

We have no desire to return to this restaurant.

AND NIU-GU IS IT. Hands down, best Xiao long bao (soup dumpling) place in town.

What's amazing is that the Xiao long bao doesn't define the restaurant. I think it's actually just recently added to the menu due to high demand and popularity. The restaurant offers high-quality, authentic Chinese that is both delicious and approachable to those who just started exploring Chinese cuisine outside what other to-to Chinese restaurants offer. 

I had their short ribs, sea snail salad, dry noodle with beef cubes, chicken wings. All of them wowed me with their thoughtful flavors and the chef's commitment to quality. Yes, some of the dish takes 30-45 minutes to cook, but trust me, it will be worth it!

Last but not least, one downside of the restaurant is the service. I went twice during the lunch service, the restaurant was packed and there was only one server.

Yelpers have half praised this place. As expected, there are some dishes that are very well done but some, not quite to my liking. 

First, this is a comfortable small restaurant. The decor is not too grand but decent enough that you won't feel that you are in a hole in a wall type. 

In a corner of the restaurant, there is a set up for Tea Tasting Ritual -- when I asked the waiter how much is that for showing us the Tea Tasting Ritual, he said we have to inquire with the owner.

We ordered five dishes:

Crab meat Xiao Long Bao - Quite tasty. I suspect that a fair amount of MSG is in it. But the problem is that the skin is too thick -- not to my liking. Grade C. 

Dumpling - issue is the skin is not well cooked -- need to spray some water on the dumplings prior to finishing the dish. Grade C. 

Kung Pao Chicken - quite tasty and well cooked. Grade B.

Marinated Cucumbers -- Good dish to have, Grade B. 

Beef noodle soup -- the beef is outstanding, but the noodle is just not right. The soup taste is ok. Based on the beef, it is worth a B.

Business is decent but they have only one waiter. He is stretched way too thin. Also the dishes take too long -- I suspect that there is only one cook in the kitchen. 

Pricing is reasonable, not cheap but properly priced. Portions are adequate.

We tried this place today, they did not have much business going on, we were seated right away  and served water immediately! The place was very nice and clean, definitely a more modern decor and style compared to traditional Chinese places. 

We started with the beef tongue salad, this was very good! Each slice of beef tongue was paired with a slice of cucumber, the sauce over the salad is like a soy sauce and oil dressing, sweet and very yummy. We also got the snail salad, lots of snail meat, this dressing had a spicy kick to it and also very good! Very nice flavors, the snail meat is fresh and crunchy. We also tried the homemade cold tofu, which was brought out and served at the table. This was more tasty than it looked, it was a big piece of tofu with scallion on top and their black sauce, looked plain but tasted very refreshing and healthy, perfect for a hot summer day! 

We tried the small crab and tofu soup and this was very good! Lots of crab meat in the bowl, the broth was thick but very light, definitely a healthier option. We got the Napa Cabbage in egg yolk sauce... We were skeptical when it was first brought out because it looked like a big plate of boiled cabbage, but this was delicious! It tasted like they used salted egg for the sauce, you can clearly taste the egg yolk, creamy but not too much where you get sick of it. Definitely should try this item!! 

We got the Triple Chili Pork which was alright, it had lots of chili and chili oil in the dish which made my tongue tingled! Not gross but not very flavorful either. 

Now let me talk about the Pork Tenderloin Fried Rice... Oh my goodness... So good! It smelled amazing and tasted just as good!! The pork was very tender and soft, the rice was perfectly seasoned, lots of black peppers on the rice which gave it such an amazing taste! There was something about the smell of the rice that was so delicious!! 

Definitely a little pricier than the average Chinese place but I think it is worth it! Very impressed after the first time here, will definitely come back!",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,3,0,4,9b7tbXEmpv-o_9fpqz9SxA

Order the hot and sour beef noodle soup to round out the dinner.  Great flavor, huge bowl, the beef is super tender, little sour and little spicy.  Help cut thru the oil from the meats.  Chicken wings were juicy and tasty.  The reason I took down a star is because thought I call ahead for the short rib and rack of lamb, they don't actually start the dish until we were seated.

Since was here figure why not try some place new cause sometimes the best things in life are not thought out or planned. All I know from the sign is noodle place before even open yelp app to look at the menu or anything about the restaurant. It sounded like good spot so got me excited about my spontaneous visit. 

I came here for lunch. I originally ordered fried dumpling but the waiter came back and informed me that they were out. So suggested trying the cold beef tongue salad. I kind of had my eye on that for an appetizer as second choice. I am BIG fan of tongue in Korean and Mexican cuisine. So I was down. Interesting thinking tongue served cold more less as salad. I never seen served like that on menu my experience. The presentation was awesome. No doubt something see fine dining style on the strip. The tongue was on point, between or literally right under each slice is a slice of cucumber believe (at first glance all you see perfect slices of tongue one on top of each other and every piece same) perfect compliment texture and taste. The sauce on top brings the whole dish together. I think it some kind of hoisin base sauce. Tasty. Talk about making great first impression with first dish!!!

My entree went with the short rib noodle soup. It was good. You may only get one short rib but it HUGE meaty single bone rib. The meat literally falls off the bone. It takes up most of the bowl. No shortage when it comes with the noodles in the dish. By the time I finish feel like had enough carbs or noodles for the next day. The broth I enjoyed. It was light and refreshing. Very subtle broth with no true distinct flavor. Overall the whole dish worked. Just something that would not ordered again the next visit. 

The service was awesome. Yay they had no fried dumplings but the waiter made a five star suggestion for sure. lol!!! The restaurant has little upscale vibe to it with the interior, and the presentations. The menu prices are hardly strip fine dining upscale. The parking in that shopping plaza never been fan of especially if stop by for dinner. So tiny and there so many restaurants in tight space crazy.

The restaurant is on the smaller side, able to fit around 50 people max. Our server was very nice and quickly seated us at the booth. The establishment specializes in different hot and cold teas. We started off with a hot green tea Little Melon Seed (Liu An Gua Pian $11) for our group. We didn't know what we should start off so we got an assortment of start items. 

Starters:
- Beef Tongue Salad $6.95 ( I was in a heaven!!! )
- Xiaolongbao
- Pan Fried Pork Dumplings $5.00

Mains:
- Squid Ink Fried Rice $14.95
- Double Chili Tiger Shrimp $17.95 (Spicy but my Husband fell in love with the juicy shrimp)
- Garlic Deep Fried Chicken $13.00 

Drinks:
- House Made Lemonade $3.50 (To die for!!!)
- Mango Iced Tea (Super delicious) 

Overall, there was nothing I could complain about this experience. All the food came out very fast even though it started to get busier as the night progressed. Everything was delicious and very reasonably priced. This is one of the best kept secrets in Las Vegas and I hope they get business they deserve! The one con, which isn't the restaurants fault, is the parking. I hate that parking lot with a passion seeing as some of my other favorite restaurants are in that parking lot too. Luckily though, because it was a Tuesday, we got lucky and was able to park relatively close to the restaurant.

The restaurant opens for lunch at 11am, but the ""boss"" doesn't get back from grocery till much later. As a result, the restaurant sometimes lacks even the most basic ingredients for their menu items such as tofu or curry powder. The waitstaff had offered to let us choose from the dinner menu (for which they had the necessary ingredient in stock) at lunch price, only to be denied by the boss upon his return. 

If you are not particular about what to order, then this place may be for you; in fact, it looks to be quite popular with elderly Chinese folks. If you have a fine taste for Chinese food - or if you care about customer service - then stay away from this place. From what I understand, it's quite often for certain menu items - including their ""specials"" - to be unavailable. And this is inexcusable, considering there is a huge Chinese supermarket across street.

3617314,2015-09-27,4,brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA,"Are there guidelines to what ramen should and should not be?

Niu-Gu is an outlier to what traditional ramen styles are, but would closely resemble to Tantan-men or Dandan noodles. The broth is clear like much of traditional Chinese/Vietnamese noodles, cleaner and not as heavy (better for the summertime, or when you're sick in bed and don't want to eat much). The lemon pepper broth sounds strange but its really similar to Northern Chinese noodles. The bowl is brought out on a cart and then a hand torch is used on the onions to give it a char flavor perhaps. Comes with a couple pieces of charred short rib slices that are soft, a little smokey, and melt in your mouth good.

The Niu-Gu Rib items (short ribs and lamb) require you to call ahead of time, and seems to be a bit of a hassle to order and the regular lamb chop I believe has a 15-20 min wait time, so consider calling ahead if you're here for a quick meal!

Niu-Gu is different than traditional ramen, and maybe some people would consider it fusion or a new style, but with so much resemblance to old school Chinese noodles, maybe its really the ORIGINAL style.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,8,7,4,7zibvZmQy_9hKgY3H7mZgw

Good taste, limited selection, long wait, bad customer experience. 
This is our last meal in the Las Vegas trip. We drove all the way from the Bay Area. When we heard the restaurant owner is from Shanghai area. We are really happy our hometown is near Shanghai and the cuisine are similar. But it turned out to be a really unpleasant experience. 
First, they lack basic ingredients -- no beef available, no bean sprouts available, no Chinese yam available. Somehow, they managed to make everything we chose unavailable. We then ordered the lamb which takes 45min to cook, salted egg yolk with napa cabbage, beef tongue, and a bowl of crab soup. 
While 3 of us were waiting for the food, my cousin felt really hungry and suggested we should get some takeout meat from another restaurant before the lamb is ready. We know most of the restaurants don't allow taking food into their restaurant. So I suggested to ask before doing so. It's their restaurant and we should obey their rule. But it doesn't hurt to ask first. My cousin went to our waiter and asked politely. One waiter said yes. Another said no. Then the boss's wife said no. In addition, she asked ""Are you from China?"" My cousin joyfully said ""yes"". She turned away immediately. My cousin came back to our table, realized he's being discriminated and got pissed off. ""She is discriminating Chinese visitors as if she isn't from China. I need to point out to her that this is wrong. "" ""Hold on. We all know she should not be discriminating. But we should wait till you are not this angry. What would she say when you pointed it out? She may be apologetic but she may also choose not to pay attention at all. What would you do? "" 
It takes forever for the food to come and we decided not to talk about this unpleasant experience and try to be cool about it. In the end, my cousin decided to write his comment on the back of the receipt. I guess he's not calm enough to talk to her. So my husband volunteered to talk her. He's usually very calm and polite. They were talking for a while and my husband came back and said let's go.  ""So what did she say?"" ""I started out very politely. But she said we were not respecting her so she wouldn't respect us. From that point on, there is nothing else to talk about. It's her decision to treat the customers this way. And we would never come back again.""",-3XSdL1fWokSYK6_zJhguQ,8,2,1,dtEaYdLavdpFOdWK5nASug

Crab soup
Lobster salad
Spicy chili shrimp
Garlic crab
Pork dumplings
Rack of lamb
Angus beef short ribs

In addition, we were served to small salads--a bean sprout and bell pepper one and a pork and edamame salad.  All items were shared by the three of us.

Outstanding dishes were the soup, the lobster salad, the short ribs and mostly the rack of lamb.  The sauce on the lamb was very rich and flavorful.  The beef short ribs were tender and flavorful also.  The presentation of both of these dishes was nicely done.  The short ribs--cooked for 6 hours using different methods during the time--was sliced and placed on a large rib bone.  Just tremendous presentation with flavor to go with it.

The star was the rack of lamb.  Tender and fatty ribs of lamb that were cooked rare.  The fat in the ribs gave them a lot of flavor when compared to lamb that is sometimes drier because it's been cooked too long and is very lean.  This was excellent.

Niu-Gu is changing from being a noodle house to being a restaurant that serves upscale Chinese food at a good price point.

With Jennifer L.'s months-old rave review still lingering in the back of my mind, I finally took the opportunity to visit Niu-Gu Noodle House tonight when it appeared near the top of my Yelp bookmarks (sorted by distance). After getting lost and asking for directions from a local barber who professed his love for Niu-Gu's noodles as well), I found it on the opposite end of the plaza from its current Yelp map spot. Look for this restaurant in the southeast corner next to Imperial One, which still is called HK Star on the facade.

The restaurant was devoid of customers except for yours truly, and the lady running the front of house seated me at a booth and brought me their menu on an iPad. After quickly scrolling through the options, which included a fair number of traditional beef, lamb, and pork dishes and some appetizers (including chicken wings that apparently would take 20 minutes to prepare), I settled on what I came here for: the miso noodle soup.

I can't remember the exact name of that dish, but it wasn't outright named ""ramen."" Nevertheless, it did have a very ramen-y feel, starting with a moderately rich and mildly spicy miso beef broth that was very slurpable. The thin noodles were cooked perhaps a touch above al dente but are definitely reminiscent of ramen, as are the diced green onions and kikurage. The beef was very tender and flavorful, and it made forget momentarily that chashu was even a thing. The bean sprouts were a nice touch, and I didn't miss the lack of bamboo or egg (the latter available at additional cost).

Despite the fairly modest portion (lunch-worthy, easily), this is a reasonable deal at $9 for one of the better noodle soups that I have enjoyed in town. Ramen or not, this dish is enough to put Niu-Gu on the map, so keep an open mind and try it the next time you want a hot bowl of goodness.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,8,7,5,JpfFSYs7mlwxUNSvM_Pdeg

Xia Long Baos:  they steam up frozen baos.  You can tell because the skin is soggy and the juice inside is almost flavorless.  It's basically melted icicles that make up the ""juice"" inside.  The vinegar comes pre portioned and was a fairly stingy portion size.

Napa Cabbage w/ egg yolk sauce: this was the saddest dish I've ever seen.  It was literally just a plain white Napa cabbage and a salted egg cracked into it.  No other garnish or anything.

Black Pepper Beef Tenderloin: this was half decent.  The flavor was great, but the ratio of meat to vegetables was really off.  I think it was over 70% vegetables.  For an $18 dish, I expected the portion to be much better.

So to top off the damage, it was almost impossible for us to get a server to bring us a check.  When we finally got our check, they forgot the pen.  We gave up waiting and my wife went to their expo line hoping to find someone to take our money. 

There are plenty of good Chinese eats in the area.  If you're in the plaza already, turn around and go to China Mama!",2JDWKHpR0g4QA4MHmFDprg,0,2,1,rHyMXYGr9ZQ9X3zM4Bd7JQ
5013009,2015-12-20,2,brAUHv7Kmxx5nclssCPldA,"There's simply no other way to put it.  This restaurant is amazing.  I think the ramen is as good or better than any place in town.  But it's the other noodle soups you can also get that make this place stand out.

My brother and I shared an order of miso ramen, hot and sour noodle soup, and fried rice.  Each dish stood up to the best versions Vegas has to offer but this place has them all under one roof.

The miso ramen was had a rich, meaty flavored broth with perfectly cooked noodles and meat that wasn't overly fatty unlike what one normally gets at other top ramen places in Vegas.

The hot and sour soup with pork loin was my order.  The soup packed a huge punch of flavor with every mouthful.  It was simply spectacular.  The pork was tender and flavorful.  The noodles perfectly cooked.  My favorite part was actually the pickled veggies that gave the bowl some texture and enough pickling bit to make eating veggies a joy rather than a chore.

The fried rice was excellent.  It's a beef fried rice with perfectly cooked (nothing here is dry) beef and rice that flavorful without being oily.  

If this place was closer to my house, I'd eat here 5 times/week.  They just recently opened so get here soon before the place is packed from open until close.  It's too good not to get ridiculously busy.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,3,0,5,KHfDJlsygCCG4BFcPH3Ltw

Now nearing its one year anniversary, still a secret to some though the word has seemingly caught on with local Chinese families looking for a fine-dining experience without driving to The Strip, dinner at Niu-Gu has seen Chef Jimmy Li retool his menu to focus on bold traditional dishes created from top-tier ingredients, some of the newer items subtle and tuned to Asian sensibilities though few of any ethnicity will be complaining of a lack of flavor.

Receiving more attention thanks to a recent article about Joe Muscaglione's expertly sourced Tea selection, a well-priced list provided in traditional service to those interested, it was after pleasant greetings from the staff that a party of four was seated at room's center, the decision to defer a menu to Chef Li with Carte Blanche yielding some old favorites plus new plates, the Tea selected by Mr. Muscaglione mellow with lightly sweet notes that performed well with both mild and spicier dishes.

Not particularly busy for a Friday, though a large Asian family soon arrived and ordered a substantial amount of food that looked great, it was with a dish of Noodles made from sliced Bean Curd that the evening got underway, the vibrant Peppers not especially hot and offering a crisp contrast to the springy Noodles while a follow-up of Fish Broth was cloudy and rich with an elegant Shrimp Ball and Goji Berry offering a dynamic juxtaposition of flavors.

Happily receiving Jimmy's signature Beef Rib next, the meltingly soft restaurant-namesake without doubt one of the best pieces of Beef in a city that has no lack of competition, the Soup Dumplings deserve no less praise in a place where restaurant-goers frequently complain of a lack in quality, each delicate pocket twisted tight and plump with pork broth as smooth as the sort found in Ramen Tonkotsu-style.

Specially requesting a whole Crab, and seeing it proceeded by a spicy Fried Lobster with a light batter clinging to Shell and sweet Flesh, those interested in seeing a truly authentic showstopper should assuredly call in advance to inquire about Market Prices far less abrasive than those found on Las Vegas Boulevard as Jimmy and his team present the Crab shell-on and soaked in Garlic plus sliced Ginger, the process of eating it well worth the effort as the best bits of Meat are tucked into the knuckles where the cooking juices penetrate most deeply.

Rounding out the evening with Peppered Beef and Mushrooms given the premium treatment by way of Prime Beef Tenderloin and dried Chilies, the two accompanying sides were a bit hit and miss as the Squid Ink Fried Rice was little less crisp or flavorful than would have been ideal while the sliced Cabbage with Egg Yolk Sauce was unexpectedly excellent, even the youngster in the group eating his fair share as the slick Sauce provided a salty balance to the pungent Crucifer.

Challenged by its small footprint amidst several of Chinatown's best, the plaza containing Chada Thai and China Mama notorious for its parking challenges, Niu-Gu has done well at carving out its niche as a fine dining destination, Chef Jimmy's cooking and Joe's unanticipated role as one of Sin City's Tea experts making this one of the rare spots in town that challenge their Strip-based counterparts at a fraction of the price.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,10,8,4,2pkgfjgCHz-afQM2TQDX2g

Our server handed us an iPad since they don't have actual menus. They only have a handful of items to choose from. We asked for hot tea. Instead of a tea pot and tea cups, we got drinking glasses with rust-colored hot water that tasted nothing like tea. But somebody smelled like strong BO and I tried really hard to deal.

Pepper Ribeye with Mushrooms:
Peppery ribeye chunks. This was ok. 3/5

Noodle Soup:
I was confused by this. I wasn't sure if this was supposed to be ramen or Taiwanese beef noodle soup because it was a combination of both and it wasn't great. 2/5

Beef Fried Rice:
This was their saving grace. The only thing we tried that was actually decent. However, it may have MSG. If I were to compare this fried rice with other Asian restaurants' fried rice, it may not even compete. 3/5

SMDH. What have I done? It was a memorable last meal alright. I'm filled with much regret...welcome to the dark side...",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,14,8,2,4y-G8h2ImCHkFeHisRpfjA
