Service has also been excellent everytime I have been there which is usually at night. They need to go back to the original taquitos they had when they opened though they went to a thinner cheaper product but its still ok.",Qn_M0DGu6DJoSiPDCN2vMw,0,0,4,PX9FAeoOXKttSlWx5oRITA

First off, this branch has people that actually listens and understands my instructions, in English, and most of them also speaks English fluently especially the girl at the cash register who is usually on duty at night. I've been to multiple Mexican places because I eat a lot at odd hours and there aren't much choices late a night, and only a few of them actually cooks my carne asada well done (even with Spanish translations etc.). Most of the time, they don't bother cooking their half-cooked carne asada before they put it on the bun, or they overcook it like it's burned. This place knows how to do it right, so I've been here for the past month almost every night.
The carne asada also tastes like it's actually been marinated, unlike other places where the meat tastes like it's just plain meat.
The horchata is also really good. It's very creamy and sweet, not watered down like most places. The first time I was there, I was wanting an ice cream (which they also have on their freezer) for desert, but after tasting that horchata, I forgot my ice cream. Refills are also free.
My husband also likes his burritos and sometimes he likes it all-vegetarian, so he can specify and add only the ingredients that he likes.
Customer service is good, the place is also clean and has really nice tile tables and decor, and added to the good food that is done right, I drive farther now when I get a craving for my favorite carne asada torta with horchata.",jh6hQgmYSPi_n9N7WqBQpw,0,0,5,0sM5zJ2mJe47PkRJY8lccg

It wasn't anything different from any mexican stop i've been at except one thing. We ordered the beef steak special & carne asada fries. The beef was EXTREMELY dry, chewy, and hard. We couldn't even cut it into small pieces so we had to ask the cook to chop it for us. The carne asada was okay, its a smaller portion than what I usually get from other mexican restaurants but it could do. Its quiet in there too, no TV going on (even though theres 2 on the wall), and no radio. So if you're going to go here, go here when you're hungry and do not care what you're going to eat, good luck!!",5eL7rlY6Ux7q3GrJpNjYGA,1,1,2,kdjuUnPK8yxHSro-EgS-Cw

For my taco loving family, Don Tortaco is exactly what you want in that pinch of a moment when you are craving good tacos but want to avoid the ff chains and restaurants.  Each of their tacos is filled with a LARGE heaping of meat - no skimping here.  The fully loaded tacos on corn tortillas are my favorite.  The crunchy shells are a bit too fried and crunchy for me, but my husband likes them.  We prefer the carne asada over the chicken, but still eat them both.  Their house hot sauce is delish!

Only *6.99 for 2 pieces of very well seasoned and marinated chicken breast served with rice, beans, and fresh avocado, tomato, and your choice of flour or corn tortillas. I was very happy with the beans and rice too very flavorful and well seasoned once again. I got the green and red salsa and have to say they are some of the better green and red sauces, very good with the food and adequately spicy.

1976731,2016-02-19,0,QWbP1vKQOFjN-6pr0-78zQ,"Similar to Robertos, but I think the food is better is. They have the traditional taco shop staples on their menu: tacos, burritos, rolled tacos, etc. 

They serve deep fried crunchy tacos, which are greasy (obviously) but delicious. The soft tacos are larger than the traditional street tacos, 2-3 of those should fill you up.  I personally like the carne adobada plate- marinated beef served with choice of flour or corn tortillas. The flour tortilla is really large! It's a tasty alternative to your typical taco shop fare. 

As most tacos shops, you order at the counter and self serve salsa and pick up order at the counter when called. Available salsas are red and green as one would suspect.  

As others have mentioned, there is a drive through, although it could be time consuming as it usually takes 5-10 minutes for them to prepare your food. If others are ahead of you this might be time prohibitive. It's likely faster to order inside rather than drive-thru. I usually go on my lunch hour.

2000700,2012-11-15,5,QWbP1vKQOFjN-6pr0-78zQ,"I guess, judging by all the other reviews, that I was a little late to get the decent tasting food. To be fair it was only like 2:30. There should have been some left.

This was gross. Not to be all rude about it, but bad food is bad food. And, baby, this was HORRIBLE.

So, I ordered the #1, which was four rolled tacos stuffed with shredded beef topped with guac and then cheese along with rice and beans. How you can mess this up is beyond me, but I'm about to tell you.

First, please don't spread the guacamole all over the tacos like it's a sauce. It is not. It's a side. Then, don't even think about putting shredded cheese on top of the guacamole like the picture illustrates on your drive-up menu board. I will gag.

I thought I was fixing the problem until I bit into the first rolled taco. What's another word for 'where in the heck is the moisture in this taco?' Oh, that's right, DRY. If you deep fry something and then stick meat with no moisture into that, it will be no wonder that I feel as though I've been driving down a freeway going 80 with my mouth wide open. That's pretty dry, FYI. Also, covering it up with guacamole may help, but what a scam. By the way, the guac was the only decent thing going on here.

Please tell me how you can mess refried beans up. No, honestly, I had no idea there was another way other than scorching them to death. These were so heavy and filled with more cheese (they apparently love their cheese here) that I couldn't even eat them. They didn't even taste like beans. Please take 'mexican' out of your name. I'm embarrassed. The rice was the same thing. Just heavy, not light. Weird.

It had all these extra ingredients that it usually didn't come with it, it was very soggy, cold, and had very little meat. I only ate what I could manage to eat and tossed the rest. Yeah it sounds like they gave me an order of beef super nachos that no one else wanted and was sitting around before I came there.  Come on.

Other times I've seen their condiments area not filled and their limes always seem old.  Another time their tacos were burned and meat was completed dry.  But their California burrito was good, only place I've good for California burritos.

The carne asada taco and fries were good and filling an the guac is great! All in all, it's a 24 hour fast Mexican joint. The food tastes good but I'm sure the cuts of meat are not great quality.

The nachos were pretty good.  They didn't overload it with beans like most places do.  They did overload it with carne asada though!  Could have used more cheese.  Additionally it would have helped if they nuked the cheese for a few seconds so that it was properly melted.

I also had a quesadilla on one trip.  Very cheesy and buttery.  Unfortunately, like most Las Vegas taco shops, the tortilla is more on the rubbery side than the flakey side.

Based on my experience at Tacos El Compita, I expected tiny lil things.  I ordered a carne asada taco and a lengua taco.  I did not realize the asada taco came with guac, so I ordered a side of guac for 75 cents.

While waiting for the chef to cook em fresh, I grabbed salsa, limes, and some radishes and cucumbers from the salsa bar.  What I noticed is the cleanliness of this place (the dining area, the bathroom and the kitchen), and the interesting decor.  There is a green theme for sure (green painted wood, green tiled tables).

The food came out fast and the tacos were huge!  Each served on a corn tortilla that wasn't all soaking wet, and my side of guac was the same size or slightly bigger than Chipotle's and costs less!

I had the asada first - it came with guac and pico, but I added a squeeze of lime and tomatillo salsa.  It was yummy.  Then, the lengua.  It came with chopped onions and cilantro.  I added the extra guac and the tomatillo and lime, then dug in.  The flavors were great, and the tongue was so good!  Such comfort food.  To be honest, I could probably have had just one taco and be full, at least for snack needs.

They have lots of specials.  This week there was a special listed for 2 tongue tacos, rice, beans and a drink for just $6.25.  If I had been in the mood for that, that is a great deal.  They also serve tortas, tostadas, menudo, and other tasty treats.  The staff is bilingual and they take cards for small amounts.

Go to Taco Y Taco instead. There, you get great service, delicious food made from fresh ingredients, and it doesn't feel like a cut-rate wannabe Roberto's.

Dislikes: They take forever!!  I have waited like ten minutes in the drive through and I was the only car. I wouldn't care if they took their time and the order was right but the second time we came we waited HELLA long , drove all the way home to find no cheese quesadilla... Drove back. Really annoying. 

Otherwise, the food is great. I don't mind waiting for it. Just get the order correct and I will feed from this place like a kitten suckling guacamole from its' mother's green tic-tacs.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,1,1,3,6eUP8yjXxQnrPumi6XYGRA

Im vegetarian and can't eat them.  I wanted rice.  And got double beans and no rice instead. I get its Mexican food , but English is still the national language.  If you don't know it you shouldn't be working on a job that requires you to speak the native tongue. I paid money for this bean covered mess. 10$ to be exact.",aMHjpbAdHfV-NGCc_Mu5SA,0,1,2,kB_gKWBgtFyxp9XjVRBz9g

I called back and was immediately asked if I still wanted my order and I asked why did you hang up on me; he said he said hello twice and nothing so he hung up. I cancelled my order. This is not the first time, I've had horrible customer service but this is the last time I will go back. I do speak Spanish so there was nothing lost in translation!",oFxfn1o6xmj7JXD6qOQHeA,0,0,2,v0d8bLMHFJ68GWalwCAeSg
