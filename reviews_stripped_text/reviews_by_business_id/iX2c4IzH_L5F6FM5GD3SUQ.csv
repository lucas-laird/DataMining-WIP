I'll make what could be a long review about how much I LOVED this restaurant short. It was clean, the owner( I assume she was anyhow) was SUPER friendly, the options were plentiful and the food was SO GOOD! I ordered a waffle with vanilla icecream, strawberries, Nutella, chocolate and caramel. The waffle was hot and fluffy, the strawberries were fresh and the icecream was just sweet enough.

Everything is made to order, which is ideal. No idea where they get their fruits, but I feel like the mangos, pineapple, and berries are always in season. I love that I've only ever seen the owners behind the counter, a dynamic duo that keeps that ""mom and pop"" feel, and ensures the quality is consistent.

Greeted in a prompt and friendly manner when I walked in. Their crepe ordering process is made simple by marking how you'd like it on a slip of paper. I like this because I think it ensures that you'll get your crepe made exactly the way you want it, without the crepe maker possibly forgetting an item.

Got my fruit crepe to go, so didn't get a chance to take a look at it until I got home. But WOW it was plentiful with large pieces of strawberries and kiwis. And lots of whipped cream, which I wanted. It was a pleasant surprise just how much fruit there was inside! My crepe maker did not skimp out on the ingredients at all!  Should have taken a picture but I already wolfed it down before I remembered.

Also, my crepe was made very fast. I've ordered crepes at other places that would take up to 10 mins to fulfill. Granted I was the only person in the store at the time, but it took only about 4-5 mins for my crepe to be done and packaged.

It was my son's 16th birthday. We were out celebrating with dinner and dessert. So, we ended our night by going to Tasty Crepes for some dessert. The pleasant staff enhanced the experience by adding a lit candle to his selection. That was nice.

With the new craze for boba, my son thought he would extend his new favorite treat to an ice cream sundae. My son's boba ice cream sundae was topped with whipped cream, a cherry, and a candle on top. He also really enjoyed his selection.

I ordered a fruit crepe that consisted of strawberries, blue berries, bananas, and vanilla ice cream. It had Nutella and chocolate. It was super good!

It was around nine o'clock on a typical hot August night in Southwest Las Vegas. A cheery couple, the owners, greeted us in the upbeat atmosphere, where they have two white leather couches and traditional French-style café tables and chairs. The crêperie has lots of frozen treats to cool off denizens of the desert after dark, including what seems to be a very popular brand of ice-cream. We were pleased with the crêpes--Nutella for him and just whipped cream and powdered sugar for me. I like my crêpes well-done, and am going to state my preference next time, which seems only logical when the  cook prepares them in front of you--the texture and delicate consistency were perfect. I'm also going to have a frozen, chocolate-covered banana, which is a fantastic concept for dessert in the desert. I took some pics of this sweet little spot with the bright polka-dots.

Even though it's not mentioned in the name, the real treasure here is the frozen bananas- you can buy them whole on the stick, dipped in chocolate and additional nuts, coconut flakes, or sprinkles, or in pieces to mix and match.

I would not kill myself to return, but if I was in the area, I would pop in should I desire a crepe, especially with the dearth of crepe places in Las Vegas.  The fillings are mainly fruit and chocolate, caramel etc.  The crepe I had was not really soft, it was crispy and broke apart as I ate it, so it was overcooked, as was my wife's.  The fillings were good, but it was just some ice cream and fruit.  At $9 for a crepe, its a little pricey too, considering a scoop of ice cream, some fruit and the crepe is all it consists of.  I am sure had the crepes been better prepared, I would have given it 4, but since both were breaking apart as we ate them, it was disappointing.  Some of the other options look decent, and they have some ice cream desserts also.  Its Thrifty ice cream, so it gets a bonus for the nostalgia value, but if you are expecting high quality, artisan style ice cream, think again.

So, let's start this review with the fact I was under the misconception that crepes were for only dessert and sweet. Wrong! This trip on my birthday to tasty crepes educated me on the other crepe options.

We found tasty crepes due to our trusty best friend Yelp. Five stars and truly a hidden treasure. You can't really see it from the road way and that I a tasty shame. 

Walking in the decor throws me back to child like themes and sweet shops. Pastel colors cover the walls in an inviting happy color splash. Lime, bubblegum pink and light blue. The place is very clean, open and plenty of seats. 

The menu is very easy to read, understand, and see the different options. They have deli crepes, savory crepes and then sweet crepes. The deli is similar to a deli sandwich except with crepe instead of bread. Savory was to die for. We got a savory crepe with turkey, bell pepper, onion, mozzarella and spinach. It was delicious. Mouthwatering. Big enough for two to share. The crepe was crispy yet pancake soft like. We also got a sweet crepe to share with was huge too. I was excited to see that they serve thrifts ice cream with their crepes as thrifty is one of my favorite. Sad there are not any rite AIDS out here. We had a ice cream crepe with crunchy chocolate ice cream with banana, strawberry and Nutella inside. Mmmmm. Loved that there was a great amount of ice cream and fruit. The ratio was perfect and flavored complimenting each other. 

The service was fantastic. The owner came over and explained what they sell, different options, the favorites and lastly he came over and asked how it was, while taking our plates from us. I couldn't have been happier with this place.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,23,25,5,sF9_Pd9QxaTZwIJN7UkZjw

For ~$8, you pick up to 3 (fresh!) fruit fillings for your crepe, sauces, powdered sugar/homemade whipped cream, and a scoop of ice cream. I always have to go with mixed berries, bananas, and strawberries on the inside, nutella on the bottom, caramel drizzled on top, and fresh whipped cream and a scoop of ice cream on the inside. It is big enough to split between two people, although at some point you will find yourself thinking you should've hogged it to yourself. 

They offer a variety of other dessert options, plus a few savory crepes. Always very clean and quiet, and a nice place to hang out and enjoy a delicious dessert. I've been here many times and will be back many more! 

Note: They do have a minimum charge (I believe it's $10) for using debit/credit cards unless you want to pay an extra fee, so try to pay in cash.",2MJ3vWiX68I2h6cmjTLxLA,0,0,5,UWmmic2SifEQG4TmoeLVxg

Prior to my trip I had bookmarked some recommended places and since this was not far from my condo, I went for it, and OMG I'm so glad I did.

I have to offer penance for my gluttony because I had TWO crepes.  I had the Savory Veggie Crepe with added Turkey...AND.. I had a Fruit Crepe (pineapple, banana, strawberry, with vanilla ice cream).   I got them to go, and didn't notice how BIG they were till I got back to my room, and was like ""WHOOOOAAA"".   I said to myself...""gonna be an early night""...because I knew that once I ate them I was gonna pass out.  But hey, I climbed to the top of Tinjana and I was good for it, ya'll!  

Best crepes I've EVER had in life.  We had a crepe place in Cincinnati that was off the chain, but compared to this one...no contest!

The place was very nice, bright, clean and welcoming, and the owners were super duper cool.  I told him it was my 50th Birthday and he hooked me up with a couple of extra card punches and told me to stop back by before I left in a few days.  Niiiiice!!!

This family owned and operated dessert haven can be found in the back of a Walgreens shopping center on the corner of Tropicana & Fort Apache. It's a pretty small location, with most of it's space being taken up by the large open kitchen area. Even so, there's still a good amount of seating, even some comfy couches and the place is extremely clean.

So, why do I call it a dessert haven? Take a look at their menu and you'll quickly understand. You wouldn't know it from their name, but they offer a whole lot more than just crepes...which I might as well add that they come in both savory and sweet varieties, and can be customized to your liking via little sheets on the counter. But also on the menu are a whole line of Thrifty ice creams which can be added to the crepes, had by the scoop or used in all sorts of sundaes, splits, cones, etc. If that wasn't enough, they have a whole line of chocolate covered frozen fruits and cheesecakes. Still not catching your attention? Well, there's also several boba drinks, smoothies and even a boba ice cream sundae!

After spending about 10 minutes drooling over the menu, I ended up ordering a sweet crepe with Nutella, peanut butter, banana, strawberry, chocolate ice cream and whipped cream. While I do love the custom sheet order system, they ended up forgetting the blueberries I also marked down...not a huge deal, but it always sucks to have stuff missing. With that being said, the crepe itself was thin, light, fluffy and one of the better one's I've had. The fruit I did have was fresh and if you take a look at the photo I posted, they aren't skimpy with the toppings at all. There was plenty of everything, including the Nutella and even though Thrifty isn't my favorite ice cream, the chocolate was good and not freezer burnt like I've seen other Thrifty shops serve. It was just absolutely delicious and about the only thing I wish they'd do is add an option to have nuts like almonds, walnuts or whatever as a topping for the crepes. I also got a taste of my sons boba ice cream and the boba was cooked near perfect, so I wouldn't hesitate to order a boba drink here either.

Pricing is pretty spot-on and close to other similar joints. The portions here are huge though and we only spent about $18, which ended up being just too much food. Being that they are a bit far from where I live, it won't be often that I go out of my way...but with so many tasty dessert options and friendly staff, I'd say this is a must try!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,7,5,4,tXH3JRvbc477016Evs_d-w

1. Up to 3 fruits (they have strawberry, banana, kiwi, mixed berry, blueberry, etc.)
2. As many toppings (chocolate sauce, caramel, nutella, condensed milk, etc.) as you want 
3. Add whipped cream and/or powdered sugar
4. $1 extra charge for a scoop of ice cream (thrifty brand)
5. You can choose crispy, medium, and soft for how you want your crepe to be prepared.

I picked strawberry, banana, and blueberry and also, chocolate sauce, condensed milk and powdered sugar (might as well go all out, right? lol). I also added a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I like my crepes to be thin and crispy on the edges, so I chose the crispy option. 

The crepe was prepared crispy, but all around crispy and not just the edges :). It wasn't as thin as I was hoping for, but overall it tasted good. All of the fruits tasted fresh and they're very generous with them (see pic). The portion was huge; I wasn't able to finish it all.

The only recommendation I have is for them to add a complimentary water station. They currently only have bottled water for $1 each. I also hope they can get a better brand of ice cream, as thrifty ice cream is just subpar.

Definitely a good place to try if you're craving crepes! The price is reasonable considering the amount you get. They have savory and pizza crepes as well.

The portions here are LARGE. They also have chocolate covered fruits or other items on the menu you can try as well, like mangos & sticky rice! My first time here I noticed they didn't have a water fountain so I have to take a star off for that because all I drink is water!!

I was craving for crepes after a hike today and on the recommendation of fellow ""yelpers"" we headed to Tasty Crepes. I'm so glad I did.  

Family-owned business, the crepes are made from scratch and are absolutely delicious. This small little eatery is located in S. Fort Apache Rd and W. Tropicana Ave. They are serving breakfast and lunch, with a selection of wallet-friendly sweet and savory crepes, for a mere $6.95 to $8.95 price point.

Their crepe ordering process is made simple by marking what toppings you want on a slip of paper.

They offers a variety of crepes to indulge your every cravings. On this visit I was surprised to find Savory Crepe. I had to try it so I ordered Pizza Crepe with Pepperoni, Salami, Black olives, cheese etc. It looked like a pizza but instead of bread,  it was crepe and was crispy yet pancake soft like. 

I can honestly say that this is one of the best crepe I ever had. It was only $8.95 large enough for 2 people. I can't wait to visit again and try some sweet crepes.

The Thai Tea with boba was the perfect pairing for my crepe.

If you find yourself craving delicious crepes, icecream and frozen yogurt, you won't be disappointed. The staff/owners are friendly and inviting and the place has a nice casual vibe.",8dxkcmAXY4ttrVFD1GhbdQ,2,1,5,SNOPg1rDPTe0jlHNERphsw

It was soooooooo tasty!!!!!!! I absolutely love this food!!!!!!! It kinda reminds me of eating breakfast and dinner at the same time . The inside is savory and the crepe is slightly sweet but not too much. The pricing is very fair also. It was about $9 a crepe and they are very filling . In fact I couldn't even finish it because I was so perfectly full. Anyways Tasty Crepes gets 2 thumbs up . Give it a try !,erRGui8jU3cZNg4_tkgqdA,0,1,5,pjyWPHRQf_77al7Lfr3CTw

In a short time, a young woman brought my dish and away I went.  It was a very enjoyable dessert.  Gee, I'm glad I had nothing sweet in the house.

They are generous with the amount of ingredients in the crepe and you can specify as many types as you wish. Think subway. We had a savory crepe and also tried a waffle sandwich.

The owners were really nice, and the crepes were delicious (we went with strawberry, whip cream, blueberries, and vanilla ice cream). It took about all of 5 minutes to scarf mine down, and I was definitely ready for 2nds.
The place was a little quiet--kinda like a library--which made me feel like we had to whisper at times. That's probably because it's new, but if they punched up the ambiance a little bit I'd raise it to a 5 star in a heart beat. Also, it'd be nice if you could add a few things to the side--maybe eggs if you're in the mood for breakfast, etc.
All in all, a place we will definitely come back to, and a place I'd recommend to come check out.",TNe3l26AAAFE1l9AmLakdA,0,0,4,RkwJXCNTl8kYcBQTm1-ZYw

They have a few tables and chairs if you decide to enjoy your crepe sitting in (which is the best way to go). They also offer teas, ice creams, and few other desserts, but I always go for the crepe. I love how customizable the crepes are; from the doneness of the crepe, to the toppings and fillings, you pick everything. I always prefer mango in my crepe, they always seem to have super sweet, delicious mangoes on hand. 
My dream custom crepe from here is medium Crunchy crepe, filled with mangoes, whipped cream, topped with Nutella and caramel, and of course, a scoop of good old vanilla ice cream, yum!
Last time i made a mistake of picking chocolate ""sauce"" instead of nutella, and it kinda threw off the flavor of the mangoes.
Overall, will definitely be returning when my next crepe craving hits! :)",8FpOYsX0xvWRlKkl6sKnBA,1,1,4,hq2I6CuLunhOt05qA37nrA

I definitely think this place deserves a little more attention than it gets!

I came here for the first time today after lunch at Roberto's because my coworkers recommended it. I decided to have a light lunch, leaving room for what I was hoping would be a delicious crepe. For a place called Tasty Crepes, there aren't many crepe choices. While you have various fruit choices and ice cream flavors, they're all basically dessert crepes. No lunch or dinner crepes.

The crepe wasn't bad. The serving size was large and is big enough to be shared. They use Thrifty ice cream, so the ice cream was good. Next time I'll probably just get an ice cream cone rather than the crepe.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,3,2,3,AwVgdkvk91Y_AoVFeXCsqg

4698758,2017-02-27,0,iX2c4IzH_L5F6FM5GD3SUQ,"I was nearby getting my eyebrows done and the owner suggested trying boba from tasty crepes. I will admit that I didn't try a crepe here but I ordered 4 boba teas and a mango sticky rice  which came out to $32. Sort of pricey. The worst part was the boba. I live for boba and I like to try it everywhere and this was the worst boba I have ever had. 

I started to sip my tea which had a decent flavor and then I sucked up a boba. The boba was pure mush. There was no chewiness at all. It was so bad that after my sister agreed, we went back in the store and told them that the boba was mushy and asked if they had issues making their batch of boba. The female employee first said ""well we have other boba but it would be too chewy and hard."" Who says that? Boba is supposed to be chewy. 

Well, then the owner came out and kindly said he would replace the boba in our drinks. He took our same drinks and poured them over the ""new"" batch of boba. Then he returned our drinks and stated ""sorry we were trying to use up the rest of the old boba before we took out the fresh boba. We probably shouldn't have used it""

So if you want leftover boba and then to be told that boba isn't supposed to be chewy, then go here. Otherwise, STAY Away. I'm not even willing to try a crepe based on my experience. I would actually give no stars for knowingly giving their customers ""old"" boba! At least he replaced it...",iBShwZ_EeYJh37BFGlHnUA,0,0,1,H1S9QUuTH45D0BfQz6Ej4A

My favorite is strawberry banana with nutella chocolate whipped cream powdered sugar. Vanilla or strawberry ice cream on yhe side. Mmmmmm.,zpLJdGufBDPfTjGPYp2lZQ,0,0,5,LhIZ13SUtaDuf8PHqjH-yA

The clean, pastel painted environment is calming upon entry. A very welcoming duo greeted us at the counter. My son opted for traditional vanilla scooped ice cream and the kind team accommodated his whim by adding rainbow sprinkles. My daughter splurged with cotton candy Thrifty ice cream in a bowl with chunks of sliced, frozen chocolate dipped bananas. Make a note, chocolate dipped pineapple and mango chunks are also available. For me, I relished a traditional Thai Iced Tea. When out and about for events at Star Nursery Kids Garden Club, Water Wings Swim School, Kids Kingdom or another kid-friendly day in Las Vegas, keep Tasty Crepes in mind for a break in the day.",ssgRnGGXxigWTEXM-n92lg,2,1,4,69t69Jj1MDIrY-JjpJj7Kg

Didn't get his name but he showed me the ordering slips and helped place my order. It's 40 degrees outside but ever since I saw this place I've been craving chocolate covered fruit so I knew I wanted to try them. You can order any six of the small chocolate banana,mango or pineapple pieces for like 4.00 so worth it! I took mine to go and they were thoughtful to poke holes in the box so it wouldn't be too soggy. The crepe was so much bigger than what I anticipated so I'm really glad I didn't order a sweet crepe too because it would have been too much. I can assume it's probably best to eat these right away but it was still warm and the crepe tasted really good.I want to go back soon and try a sweet crepe!",Urq54Q9SWt1w0PiHMGb4Iw,0,0,5,Wf6RtawCxHKgU0t28JIJbg

It wasn't quite what I was expecting because its more of a ice cream parlor style place than a restaurant style place. Only about 6 tables inside. 

Since I stopped at 11 am, I was the first and only customer as this place opens at 11 and goes to 10pm. The lady working there was very nice and friendly. 

I ordered the mixed berry fruit crepe with whipped cream. It was good sized and full of fresh fruit. They mixed the whipped cream inside the crepe so it had a little bit in each savory bite. 

I will come back and try it again.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,11,7,4,NL0Rr0iBodVUrQfuEaygCg

Now stay away from the chocolate dipped stuff. It looks good but they use cheap chocolate. Overall I'd go back!!,fSFpjl-C0fXY7h7cG8Wxeg,2,2,4,P1YBa7jx4iIJFrGUTmKyBA

Crepes: made to order with fresh fruits, as many sauces and toppings you want, and a gigantic scoop of good quality ice cream for only a dollar more. Portion sizes are more than generous as well. 

They also have a good assortment of chocolate dipped frozen mango, pineapple, cheesecake, and banana. You have the option of bites or on a stick, with nuts, sprinkles, or coconut shavings, etc., etc! 

Other places could use a tip from them when it comes to top-notch customer service. The owners are very accommodating and welcoming. They help you through the ordering process and are super patient!

The store is cute, nice size, a few tables  and lounge couches and you have the option of eating there or taking to go. We chose to stay and indulge in a crepe. They give you the option for 3 toppings with or without ice cream. Ordering is super easy because they already set up a tiny paper that you can decide on what you would like from Nutella to chocolate to all the fruits and ice cream! Being such an indecisive person, it was so hard to decide! I chose a Nutella, banana, strawberry, with whipped cream, chocolate syrup, and chocolate malted crunch ice cream. YUM. The crepe was made perfectly, soft and chewy, with a hint of crunchiness at some parts. I also couldn't help myself, but we grabbed a couple chocolate dipped fruits, which were delish and reasonably priced. It comes with 6, and I chose to get banana, pineapple, and mango. Mmm mmm, good. My boyfriend's little brother chose 2 scoops of chocolate ice cream, and I got one scoop of rainbow sherbet. Thrifty's ice cream is always the way to go! They sell boba and other deliciously looking crepes which I will definitely need to try in the future! The lady who served us was really nice and friendly which is always an added plus. She gave us a punch card, and if you're someone like me who collects these from the best places, then this is an added plus!! If you're looking for a quick dessert stop with good prices and wanting to walk out like you're full and satisfied, tasty crepes is definitely the place to go!

When we walked in they were pretty empty, but in less than five minutes the place was packed. Good timing on our parts.

When you approach the counter there are small order forms where you mark all the contents you want included in your crepe. They have sweet, savory and pizza crepes to choose from. I opted for a sweet version with strawberries, mixed berries, chocolate brownie ice cream and powdered sugar. My OG ordered a sweet with chocolate chip ice cream, berries and strawberry sauce as well as a pizza crepe with pepperoni and sausage I believe. They serve Thrifty's ice cream, so that's a nice blast from my past growing up in Southern California.

We took a seat and waited for our creations to be brought out to us. The crepes were good and I enjoyed the the filling quite a bit. The crepe itself was a little on the dryer, burnt side and didn't have the lovely softer texture that I have come to love. 

The crepes are a lot bigger than I was expecting and we realized we were in over our heads with three crepes total. My friend ended up taking a majority of his pizza crepe home with him as leftovers. I didn't follow up with him to see how it held up, but I didn't expect it to. 

The crepes were decent and it's a nice spot to grab a dessert and just chat with friends since they have a decent sized dining area with chairs and tables. Portions are large and decently priced for what you're getting so sharing might be a good idea if you're not super hungry.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,3,bicmDQ4193jcXkMyutU8xA
