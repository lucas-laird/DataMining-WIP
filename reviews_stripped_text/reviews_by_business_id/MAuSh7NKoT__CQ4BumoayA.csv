I got a strawberry margarita, guacamole,  and beef burrito.  The drink was strong,  guac was fresh, and the shredded beef burrito was so flavourful and filling. I was only able to eat about half of it. 

The service was awesome, it was happy hour and our waiter was very attentive with our drinks and the food was out within 15 mins. 

I would recommend this place to any Mexican food lovers. Mmmm.",Ogwl4MO6XdJCRAqRbjAMMA,0,0,5,M22Nx6kzmqL_dMWD-FAwEA
9079,2014-06-18,0,MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA,"My boyfriend and I ended up here because I mistakenly thought it was part of the $20 food & beverage coupon that you get for the Luxor/Excalibur when you stay at one of those casinos.  That's what I get for not reading the voucher all the way through!  All the same, I'm very glad I made that mistake because otherwise I would have never thought to go to Tacos 'n' Tequila for breakfast.

We were there during the Sunday Mariachi Brunch.  I ordered the chilaquiles and my boyfriend had the albondigas.  Both dishes were wonderfully flavored and the portion sizes were more than sufficient; however the real star of our breakfast were our micheladas.  Hands down the best micheladas we've ever had.  A perfect blend of spicy and hearty.  Gave us just the pep we needed to start our day in Vegas!

The service was great.  Our waiter was very attentive and friendly and we were even serenaded by the Mariachi Band.  They were taking table-side requests and my boyfriend asked for ""Guadalajara"" because that was the song his dad used to sing all the time when he was growing up.  They did a great job and made it all a lot of fun.

I would have given this place 5-stars except for two small things.  1) You have to pay extra if you want eggs in your chilaquiles.  I know chilaquiles can vary from place to place, but it's been my experience that eggs are the main staple of the dish so it seemed odd they weren't included.  However the dish did include chicken, so it was still very filling, but I did miss the eggs.  2) No menudo.  I really wished they had it available.  The albondigas was tasty, but to me when you're looking for a really good hangover breakfast, you just can't beat menudo.",pplya_6D9ElaNXhoFvpZFg,1,1,4,M-BckkybMCHYjx_aedf98w

46518,2015-06-30,0,MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA,Just recently visited this place in Las Vegas and I wasn't very impressed. It didn't really taste too much like authentic Mexican tacos. You get complimentary chips but the chips were a little too thick and a little greasy they gave you two types of salsas but they tasted a little too sweet to me and not spicy. I ordered tacos al carbon and I didn't like them too much they also tasted sweet  which was probably due to the pineapple pieces that were mixed in with the meat I don't know if I would go back.,II35DJCYId7eKyr8LjFZxg,0,0,3,7JC9qopBMDPThBOcoTOMMQ

57803,2012-05-19,0,MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA,"To be honest, I'm a fair person who gives legitimate reviews. I find it disrespectful when a person says they can't allow anyone to enter who serves a drink within the hotel. In my opinion, I think it's all lame. If a hotel allows Fat Tuesday to be served while T&T says no to Fat Tuesday at their restaurant then that's a little BS. This is one of the main reasons why I don't book my stay at Luxor.

""Have a drink! But you can bring it anywhere else.""

Also, I hate how the ""manly"" employee came up and said rudely I could t not bring a drink from the same hotel in a restaurant.  He tried my time and other's time at the LUXOR and will not be coming back here spend a dime.

I wish this gets reviewed by LUXOR and lays down a simple law to allow a simple rule to allow anyone to not give a damn like other restaurants.

T&T sucks because of this.

The ambience was good, low light, not a lot of energy so it was a nice escape from the hustle and bustle of the vegas casino floor. Service was mediocre but the food was delicious. I had the combination of tacos; carne asada, chicken and carnitas. The carnitas taco was my favorite with pickled red onion, chopped orange, and the moist and tender carnitas. The chica got a trio of carne asada tacos which were delicious. The only had one corn tortilla for each taco so you weren't getting a mout full of tortilla each bit. Each plate came with rice and beans ehich weren't bad but nothing to brag about. Salsas were good and the chips were airy and not heavily drenched in oil. ***WARNING- they charge $3 for chips and salsa*** but they don't tell you when they say, ""we'll be right back with your drinks, and chips and salsa"".

124266,2012-12-12,0,MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA,"I hate straying from my always growing burger to-do list, but I was recently out at lunch with some contractors and there happened to be a burger lunch special at the Mexican restaurant we were eating at so I was peer pressured into it. I try to plan my burger meals around my work schedule or where I'll be during parts of the week, so I figured walking into Tacos & Tequila at the Luxor I'd be able to avoid an unplanned burger and mess up my plans later in the week. Other than the Double Del at Del Taco, I can't say I've had many burgers at Mexican restaurants so I really wasn't expecting much, but couldn't say no to the audience at my table that wanted to witness a burger review in the making. Were they able to witness anything decent?

The bar is located on the atrium level inside the pyramid, with nothing but a small decorative ceiling above it so when you're sitting in there you have a view looking up at all the guestroom corridors and surroundings. It's a bit noisy as there is a lot happening on this floor between the background music, tourists walking by and the check-in area directly below. Seats towards the front 'patio' area are great for people watching though, as this is a very high traffic area. Their menu is pretty stocked with typical Mexican fare, nothing out of the ordinary. What is random is the Matador Burger listed on their lunch special: fresh grilled half-pound burger patty, caramelized onions, saut√©ed mushrooms, guacamole, gouda, oxacan & jack cheese, spicy thousand island and tomatoes on a fresh baked bolillo roll.

What came out was not as random; it actually a resembled a very good looking burger despite the chips being on the plate where fries should have been. The bun was very chewy, grilled on the inside and quite good. The patty had good beef flavor, was cooked a bit inconsistently throughout but somewhat close to the medium-rare I ordered in most parts. The loads of shredded lettuce and avocado slices made it seem very Mexican, and the mushrooms were almost non-existent. The caramelized onions were not quite caramelized enough and were a bit overpowering at first, but either I got used to them as I kept going or the rest of the flavors were able to combat them later on. The burger had a lot of melted cheese on it, but that too was lost with everything else. Overall this was quite a good burger; one of the guys at my table who also ordered one said that it was definitely in the top 5 he's ever had in Vegas.

As I said before the burger came with chips instead of fries, and after asking the waiter there was no option at all for fries. The chips were mostly soft and soggy, and I didn't end up eating too many of them. As preferred with most of my burger meals, fries were definitely missed here. I recently ordered a Bachi Burger without fries and it held its own quite well, there are only a small handful of burgers that this works for. If you don't mind chips instead of fries, this is definitely a good burger, definitely better than anywhere else inside the Luxor itself. But if you're in the Luxor or anywhere in its vicinity and are in need of a burger, you would be depriving yourself of near perfection if you didn't go to Burger Bar instead.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,1,1,3,xOv1uqBRnpRvjSttzFSaMw

It would be surprising to me to find a restaurant in a hotel in Las Vegas that demolishes authentic San Diego Mexican cuisine, but in this particular dish I have found it. On Saturday and Sunday brunch in T&T the chicken chilaquiles would be a sin to pass up. You might be thinking ""who could go wrong with some chilaquiles?"" And that would be an appropriate thought. Until you try them here. These are on a whole different level. If you are near this strip on a Saturday or Sunday morning between 11-3 and you do not hit up T&T for this breakfast from the gods..

261646,2012-06-14,1,MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA,"I'm really growing tired of Strip restaurants and Tacos and Tequila didn't help the cause.  Small portions of cruddy food at outrageous prices- no wonder I never eat on the Strip anymore!

Anyway, I wound up here because I had a restaurant.com coupon, their menu appeared to have vegetarian-friendly items, and I was going to see The Australian Bee Gees next door at Excalibur.  We had an hour to eat to be on time for the show; we knew we'd be cutting it close but figured we would be fine since we are always quick to order our meals.

Well we wound up with some space cadet server who looked like he was just forced to run sprints for the last hour.  When asked if he knew for sure if the veggie items were truly vegetarian (no lard, chicken stock, etc) he had no idea.  He said he thought the beans were cooked in lard.  I found this odd because they were black beans but I didn't order them to be on the safe side.  I ordered the veggie enchiladas and my husband ordered the veggie tacos.  Both came with a side of rice (we nixed the beans).

Then we waited forever for our food.  And we waited forever for our refills.  Once I stopped our waiter, who was holding a pitcher of water, and asked if I could have a refill.  He acted put off by my request which ticked me off considering he was holding the water right in his hands!  Really, it troubles you to that much to pour me some water for three seconds?

The food finally came out and it was tiny.  Two tiny enchiladas and three of the smallest tacos I've ever seen in my life.  They tasted fine, but for some reason I had this odd taste of pork fat in my mouth....I could have just been paranoid from what our server said earlier but who knows.  Also, I can almost guarantee the rice had chicken stock in it.

We scarfed our food down and waited and waited again, this time for our check.  We got out of there as fast as we could and arrived at The Bee Gees precisely two minutes late.  Sweet.

For vegetarians: Don't come here until you've called and talked to a manager to know for sure what is veg-friendly.  

For non-vegetarians staying on the south end of the Strip who want to party like a tourist and have extra cash on hand to spend and don't want to walk to Margaritaville: This place could be fun to get some incredibly overpriced drinks and eat a few tacos.

For everyone else: Think twice before coming here.",ELfzWgdf64VBLi5z1ECItw,7,2,2,wVfC8OlPIojCOKXtVFMlqg

I came here for a friends birthday because he really likes the Alambre Tacos (grilled skirt steak, bacon, Oaxaca cheese & chile poblano) which we all ordered because he said it was really great. For $16 you get 3 mini tacos = 1.5 normal tacos, side of rice (dry and oily), black beans (bland and they don't spend the 2 cents to put cheese on top). Not a hearty traditional Mexican meal by any stretch of the imagination. Thank god we ordered the $10 quacamole to go with our chips (which were really good!) or we still would've been hungry. 

Our server was high or something- he didn't pay attention to us and constantly forgot things. I ordered a Mango Ginger Margarita five minutes later our meal came and 20 minutes later my drink came- when we were done eating- seriously? Then he hands it to my friend cause it had been so long he forgot who ordered it. I told him I changed my mind (because I wanted it with my meal) and he didn't offer to comp me the drink or apologize for how long it took. Lame- cuz the drink sounded good.

So if you wanna blow $120 on meager hit and miss food for 4 people including 1 margarita, 1 beer, and 1 iced tea you are in the right place at T & T, OR, you can pay me and I'll make you a Mexican banquet included 4 margaritas for $120. I'll even bring your drinks so you can have them WITH your food!

Had the service been good though- the loud techno music, and pricey food wouldn't have been as big of a deal at all.",3hQRRzT3dsFLNFOHZJdVfA,2,1,1,51CxNr9y4TIXsZ_ggqzyng

If I were very hungry and wanting to get full, I would choose another restaurant.  For me, it's more of an appetizers-in-between-bar-hopping sort of place, and it serves that purpose well.  

The crab tostadas were delicious.  They consist of three substantial mounds of crab meat served on teeny-tiny chip-size tortillas, so I asked for a side of chips and salsa (they didn't bring one automatically) to make the crab-to-chip ratio come out right.  I have also tried the carnitas tacos and carne asada/bacon tacos, and all hit the spot nicely.  

The pomegranate acai margarita and pineapple chipotle margarita (sounds weird, but it works) were excellent.  I tried one of the others at one point, strawberry something I think? and it was just okay, pulpy and kind of weak.  It was a different bartender on that visit though, and that may have been a factor.

The atmosphere was mostly upbeat and they were playing good rock music.  The first time we visited, the bartender said that Aerosmith had recently dropped in after their July concert.  Don't know if that's true or not.  I noted that the voluptuous vixens in the advertisements were not in attendance during any of our visits.",chJ7qlfiI8swU-FiWHfL3w,1,0,4,U7cZMZbQR4SHtN0x9X1xdg

I asked the bartender what was good and she recommended the shrimp quesadillas , so I ordered that and a Strawberry Agave Margarita which was very sour but I liked it. On the menu it says its made with fresh ingredients. Once we got our drink that's when the waiting began, it was probably a half an hour later that our food arrived. So thank goodness for the complimentary chips and salsa. I can't say I was a huge fan of the salsa but I'm glad they had something while we waited for the food. The Shrimp quesadillas were good. but lacked ingredient especially for the price. We had also ordered a chicken fajitas but it was bland and I was not impressed!

My wedding party ate here the day we arrived from the airport. Fianc√©es family likes to drink + loves Mexican food so it seemed like an obvious choice. They were there drinking a couple hours before we arrived, closed their tabs and ordered coffee while we ate. The waitress wasn't very pleasant but I'm pretty lenient as far as servers go because sometimes it only takes one terrible customer to ruin a day.

Fianc√©es family left before us but left some cash on the table to cover their coffees. Waitress comes over and counts it and exclaims ""this is not enough!"" Which is fine. We just say we don't mind paying for it so don't worry about it. She went on about it with a couple more sentences on how there's just no way the cash on the table is enough. We paid for our own bill, left more than enough for the coffees and tipped well but I was just put off by her attitude about it. It'd be a little more understanding if they got up and left their entire bill only half paid for but this wasn't the case.

The rice was very good it had carrots, peas, and corn in it, it was different and I enjoyed it. The bean were black beans and I prefer Pinto or refried beans but neither were an option.

I dont know if it was bad bacon or just bacon being in the mix but it tasted so bad and smelled like dog food.  My sister ordered the tacos but instead of carne asada we subed it with barbacoa.  Now that was delish.  I was going to take it back but i opted to taking out the meat and made bean tacos with my side.  The tacos are tiny as well. They say street tacos but i go to mexico all the time and they do not make  their street tacos that small.  The rice is nasty as well. Its hard and has no flavor.  Im mexican so I can be a bit picky but I think Chipoltle is 100 times better and 1/2 the price.  This place is way over priced for the quantity and quality of food.

Excellent: Chips and salsas. Yum. STRONG margaritas (I passed out so hard afterwards at the chairs outside Starbucks that my wife couldn't wake me up for like 20 minutes...at lunchtime). Nice server lady who came to ask us (4 Asians) how we knew what mole sauce was and was all impressed we had been to Mexico, etc. Oh and good mole sauce. Nice mariachi band.

Not so good: We kind of got deceived into thinking we were ordering 2 for 1 margaritas for $12. She brought it in 4 glasses since there were 4 of us (though we thought we had only ordered 2) so we thought she had split it for us on purpose. Turned out she charged us $24 for 4 margaritas. That sucked. (but like I said it was a good margarita). 

Though our server lady was pretty nice, the manager was not. Also, in general, the price was a bit painful. Plus, ambience in the Luxor is...well dark and cold...kind of like how dead Egyptian pharaohs would like it....not how chipper Mexican cantinas generally are.

The first time my husband and i split the shrimp ceviche. DELICIOUS!! You don't get a ton of it, but was worth the money for how good it was. He had the tostada sampler [will post a photo].. we didn't realize just HOW SMALL, the small plates were. It was also delicious however, and beautifully presented. I tried the Watermelon drink, which was pretty bland. Service was decent at this visit.

Second visit we tried the nachos, as the plate was supposed to be much bigger. It was! And was delicious! However, we had to wait a good 10 minutes or more just for water or chips and there was only 2 other tables seated at around 3pm. Then another 10 minutes for food.

As with all things Las Vegas, it's overpriced and oversexed. If that's too much for you, best not to come into LV at all.

On the plus side, the food was pretty decent. Service was good, although the food took longer than it should have to come out since it was not busy when we were there. There were ample chips and salsa provided, and the waitress was very on top of keeping drinks refilled.

So why 3 stars, and not 4? In all honesty, part of that score stems from the fact that it's the Luxor, a hotel I will never stay at again after this trip. The rest is based on price (yes, it's Vegas, no, that doesn't make it acceptable) and the wait time on the food.

Honestly, the Luxor isn't exactly the fanciest place.

It actually has some of the BEST Mexican food around. We got the asada tacos and chicken enchiladas with the mango and spicy lover margaritas and it was all superb! The tacos were out of this world, would highly recommend them! The enchiladas were good too, but nothing crazy to write home about. And those margaritas may be a bit pricey, but damn are they good, and they don't skimp on the liquor. The price isn't too bad if you don't go crazy and order tons of apps.

The place is aptly named, as they seem to specialize in the two ""T""s.  The tacos are quite competent and their guacamole is an addictive substance.  However, I wasn't overly impressed by their cadillac margarita...at $45 a pitcher I expected something more than syrupy sweetness with a hint of lime and--I *believe* there was some tequila in there somewhere.  Next time I'll get a tequila flight...it's pretty hard to water down straight tequila...right?

Now for a bit of a rant:  the first time we came here (2009) they were cranking classic rock through the speakers.  Solid.  The second time (last week) they were cranking the CLUB MIXES of classic rock hits.  Sorry, but I'd rather swill tequila to a tape of dogs barking incessantly than to ""Riders on the storm""...oomp tsss oomp tsss oomp tsss oomp tsss...""riders on the storm""...oomp tsss oomp tsss...",OhbkWITYdUT-r-R0sXY2Iw,1,0,3,OXlCr6DkC6554xYVxbAe4A

 My pork was a nice color on the outside but when you moved it around with your fork it was beige in color..... Yuck!!! Plus the Black Beans looked liked someone..... Well you can use your imagination on that one. The waiter keep running off and would never allow us to finish what we were saying or asking. When we asked to speak to the manager again about our service and food. He also began to walk away while my cousin she was trying to explain herself. 

Only the men kept and ate their dishes it was okay for them. We sat there and and,waited  for them to finish. I did not have cash but my husband refused to pay with our credit card so we borrowed the $15 to pay the bill and told our cousins we will pay them back when we left there.

The atmosphere is pretty cool.
They have a travelling 3 piece band that walks around the restaurant and takes requests...everything from Spanish songs to Lady Gaga.

The only thing keeping it from 5 stars is that I think it's a bit pricey.  It's not going to break your bank, but it could be a little bit cheaper.

We ended up getting an appetizer and dessert to round out the entree for the $50 charges.  We took the dessert back to the room and had it later.

The two women hostess' seemed like they were in their own world as far as paying attention to who wanted to eat there. We waited under 10 minutes for a seat. We were sat in the back, but it was quiet, and lit perfectly, so it really wasn't that bad. There was an amazing piece of Art on the wall of a woman and a bull, which I seriously NEED to find out who painted it. I want it!

Our waitress was over quickly, she was very talkative which did annoy me at first, but that's my preference, nothing personal towards her. She was friendly, and very open discussing almost anything.  Another man brought out chips and salsa while she was conversing with us. The salsa was good! A red and a green, the red was smoky, like you'd expect, and the green was flavorful. Very impressive. 

I decided to have the Watermelon cocktail, was good. I've found out that I'm not really into the mixed drinks as I used to be. It was good though. We weren't really hungry, so decided to share the Nachos, chicken added. 

Oh my goodness. Heaven! They make their own Chipotle cheese for the nachos, and the black beans are sort of thinned out so it's not so thick. The chicken was tender, well seasoned. We seriously considered stopping by before we left just for an order of Nachos to go. 

I was given a free shot of Tequila for my Birthday, which was brought out with the dessert we ordered. We ordered the Sunday for dessert, and the cinnamon ice cream was out of this world.

The restaurant did not look very busy, but since we had a group of 8 they told us it would take a while for them to put some tables together for us. The hostesses had seated everyone at every other table for four. While it made the restaurant look busier, it meant that there weren't any two tables for four next to each other. They ended up seating us in a closed section of the restaurant. We were the only ones there.

Our waitress came soon. She was very friendly. She told us about all her favorite places to go in Vegas. We just really wanted her to take and put in our order. They really scrutinized out driver's licenses when we ordered beers. She said she had to show mine to her manager since the picture didn't look right to her, but after she saw that everyone else at the table was about the same ages as me, she figured  it was legit and gave it back without showing anyone. We all went with tacos since the place is called Tacos and Tequila. 

We were brought our drinks and chips quickly, but the entrees took awhile. The serving sizes were pretty disappointing for the price. I paid $18 for 3 small tacos that were about two bites eat. That being said, they were the best tacos I have ever tasted. Previous to them, the best tacos I had ever eaten were at a place in Rosarito, Mexico. If they would either up their serving size or lower prices, I would come back. However, as good as the tacos were, they were not worth $18. I know some have called this place Hooters with a Mexican theme, but I could eat pretty well for $18 at Hooters (FYI, there's a Hooters across the street with 25 cent wings during late night hours in their 24 hour cafe, but read my review before heading over there).",DgrkaxfNoMP1nGGrDcpkOw,2,1,3,_WBfklU5iB7wZ69r8mkxqA

The salsas are good, but they're no different from some of the other Strip Mexican restaurants. And the chips are too greasy for me to enjoy.

The meat in the various offerings (tacos, enchiladas, etc.) has good flavor, but always seems too tough. And the tortillas are definitely not handmade or fresh.

Customer service is legit, Anthony our server was super cool and didn't over do it in always asking if we were good or needed anything. He actually let us enjoy our food then checked in as needed...

The menu is pretty large, ranging from different appetizers like steak nachos. With a handful of hefty salads and soups like, chicken tortilla soup! 
They offer the usual combo plates, like an enchilada and taco. Plus Main entre√®s like taco plates and more! 

I absolutely loved the homemade chicken tortilla soup. This soup actually had stripped pieces of chicken instead of the usual chicken breast slices. So good with a small kick of spicy! Only thing I would have added was fresh avocado slices on top. 
For my main, I tried the carne asada tacos with pieces of bacon within. Yes I said steak and bacon tacos! Along with the tacos came a side of Spanish rice and black beans. Seriously, this dish is so filling, enjoy it with a Corona and your dinner will be perfect!

While T&T was good, it's wasn't good enough that I'd go back again as my go to place in Las Vegas for Mexican food.

After reading some of the reviews about service we gave them a test and ordered guacamole to start.  Some folks said it never  came but ours came quickly and really was quite good.  I must admit the chef has a heavy hand with the spices.  we ordered medium and if ours was medium, be careful of the hot.  The chips were good, nice and fresh and crunchy.  Two sauces for dipping, a red and a green, both of which were tasty.

My hubby ordered the shredded pork tacos.  You get three mini tacos along with black beans and rice.  Surprisingly the small tacos he got were so stuffed with pork that he couldn't eat all of the third.  He said they were good but not wonderful  I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos which were good but not wonderful and I love shrimp tacos.  I kept expecting regular size taco shells with regular size shrimp but these of course were the small ones and they used the little tiny shrimp.  No way were they grilled, probably saut√©ed in a pan.

We both got margaritas.  I had a skinny one and didn't finish it, tasted horrible.  don't know what they used for mix but it wasn't good.  My husband got a strawberry agave one and he said it was good but not great.  Am thinking unless you ask, you get the low end tequila.

Not much ambiance but that's ok, it's a casino after all.  However, that said when we want Mexican food in Vegas, we'll go back to Border Grill",1HvVTMBEs8ZArJ62IGMbCw,1,1,3,RfO5GzeZBsbx53ogjsQEiA

The chips seemed greasier than last time, and the salsa wasn't all that great either. But my immense disappointment was with the veggie tacos; instead of red and yellow bell peppers like last time, they now use green, which leaves a bitter after taste. The tacos also didn't have cheese on them, just sauteed mushrooms and some sort of sauce - I could have done better at home. My heart was broken.

Instead, I got lured into the convenience of how there is a Mexican restaurant right downstairs of my hotel. The name made me even more excited thinking that they specialize in tacos. 

I would say this place is one of those more ""Americanize"" Mexican restaurant. The complimentary chips & salsa already gave that impression because salsa did not have a kick in flavor at all to begin with meaning they cater it to more Americanize people knowing that they can't handle spiciness at all. I was looking at the menu, it was 17-20 dollars for a plate of 3 tacos with rice & refried beans depending on what tacos you would be getting. I thought, hey it's Vegas after all, rent is probably not cheap here so they had to charge like that. Price is not what bothered me, I ordered the combo tacos where 1 is chicken, 1 is carne asada, 1 is pulled pork. The chicken was dry, still ate it. The carne asada was probably the best, wasn't hot when it came out, but tolerable. Pulled pork was horrible, I couldn't finished it and scrap all the meat off  and finished it with rice & beans stuffing instead. 

I like to leave at least something positive, they had a Mariachi Band that came around. It was pretty hilarious because they knew more than the traditional songs, they sang modern songs like Beyonce's Single Ladies and Jason DeRulo's Wiggle song. HAHAHA.

He brings out our chips and salsas, and while my sister and I had trouble deciding what drinks we wanted, he saw our 2-for-1 Dos Equis deal and simply suggested we take advantage of that. Very glad we did, as I enjoyed the amber ale and cost $7 for two. I loved the chips and salsa. The chips were nice and warm and not stale at all, in which I'm used to at some establishments. The tomatillo salsa was good and tangy, but the other one was much tastier with a nice roasted flavor.

I opted for the $13 torta special (carne asada) and sister had the veggie tacos. As she ordered that, our waiter was super awesome and asked her is she was a vegetarian. As she was, he noted that the beans were indeed not vegetarian and offered to double up on the rice instead. That was super helpful, as the veggie options listed in the menu make it seem like it is all indeed vegetarian.

The waiter was friendly and seemingly great. He brought us chips and salsa before we ordered, asked us if we liked guacamole and recommended it to us. He returned with our drinks and guacamole. Overall the dinner experience was great, until our bill came with a $10 guacamole charge. I was SO irritated. It's not about the $10 so much as it is about the fact that I got tricked in to buying $10 guacamole! Don't act like you're giving us something complimentary and then charge me for it. It was B.S. 
It wasn't just us either, by the time the tables on each side of us got their bills they were mad about the same thing.

Aside from that, the food was okay. I'm picky about beans and these weren't my favorite, but I liked my tacos. The drinks weren't exceptionally strong or great especially for their price.

Those guys were very talented musically and comedically! they came over to our table and asked what our favorite type of music was, and they provided some popular songs, mariachi band style. Kudos to T&T for that fun entertainment! 

The food is perfect here. One of the biggest highlights is how much meat they give you on your tacos. You can see in my photos below that they DEFINITELY don't skimp on the meat at this place. I've never had more delicious and filling shrimp tacos, and they were worth every penny! They have a great selection of dishes, all reasonably priced.

T & T! It tastes so right! 

T & T! Gives me a power load! 

T & T! Watch my butt explode!

Bad AC/DC sample aside, Tacos & Tequila (T & T) is actually pretty good even though it's ridiculously overpriced even by Las Vegas standards. 

Seriously, this city will use any opportunity to overcharge you. On my last trip, they charged me 33 percent more for an escort because she had two legs and most of her teeth. Kidding. 

No really, I am kidding.

When my 11 day work trip to Las Vegas bled into the fifth day (and into the weekend), I needed to unwind a bit by watching the first round of the NFL playoffs in a sports bar environment. I had passed by this joint on the way to work a few times, so I gave it a shot. Luckily, it filled the bill (in more ways than one).

I walked up and asked for a table for one near a screen. Quickly, two pretty hostesses greeted me and sat me at the bar in front of some nice high definition screens. The bartender immediately put some chips and salsa in front me, asked if I wanted a drink, and presented the menu to me. Without question, the service at ""T&T"" is dynamite.

Bad joke aside, the food is also awesome. My order was promptly taken and soon enough I was munching on some awesome chips and salsa, sipping on a drink, and high fiving sports fans around me. Eventually, my order came out with 4 tacos of various meats with melted cheese on top. They were freakin' delicious. 

The price is a bit steep for food and/or drinks. But then again, the more you drink, the better it all tastes, and the less price seems to matter.

I wanted quick meal in the hotel (Luxor), but still wanted to be able to sit down so I ended up at Tacos and Tequila. I was in and out within 40 minutes which was pretty sweet.

It would not be fair to compare a taco in Vegas to the tacos I eat in California, but naturally I still strayed that route. It's not the same as Mexican food in California, but it's decent if you need a taco or tequila fix. 

Complimentary Chips with Two Salsas - The chips were a little thick. I like fresh fried thick and crispy or thin corn chips, but I'm not a big fan of the in between tortilla chip where it's a little thicker and really hard but not too crispy. This was an in between chip. The salsas were fine, they gave a red and a green salsa. 

#1 Alambre Taco Plate (Grilled Steak, Bacon, Chile Poblano, Onion, Cilantro, Oaxacan Cheese on Flour Tortilla) - It says on their menu that this is their #1 item and looking at their other offerings, I would agree. The taco is full of diced steak and bacon with a mild kick to it from the poblano chile. The flour tortilla was rolled thin so that was a positive surprise (I like thin vs. doughy). The plate came with rice and beans and this is where it went wrong. The black beans were good, but the rice was undercooked and gritty. Rice is the filler item and it's not hard to get right.  C'mon man! If you are craving some beef tacos, I recommend getting Alembre tacos, either a la carte or as a taco plate. Let's just hope your rice turns out better than mine were.

Service was good. I sat at the bar and they were fast with the water, chips and salsa and they did check on me after I received my food. They have flat screens with sports on in the bar area and they can fit sizable parties at the tables. Comparing to the other mid-range restaurants at the Luxor, T&T - Tacos and Tequila is probably one of your safer bets.",NOs3g2KLfNvuc9dDWy3syg,8,8,3,-0XxQp9Tz_c7s4BcXZFKTg

COMPLIMENTARY chips and salsa. Hells yeah!!!! Can't go to a Mexican restaurant and not get FREE chips and salsa!!! The green salsa taste better than the red on in my opinion. 

My friend and I got 2 combos and they were only $20.00 each. Pretty decent price especially since it's located ON THE STRIP. 
His combo included a chile releano and two enchiladas I think.
My combo included a chicken tamale, pork taco, and beef enchilada. (see pic.)
Both combos include rice and beans. You can opt for all rice or all beans if you want.

Honestly...T & T is located on the strip. Don't complain about prices. It's expected to cost higher than normal. The food was delicious, ambiance was chill and the service was good. What more can you ask for in this tourist city?? If you're so concerned about the cost...then I suggest just going to the food court. But if you want to have lunch/dinner at a nice, decent priced, sit-down restaurant...then this place is recommended.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,4,4,4,6lGMa9BosCpP4VE0EP0Ogg

I already knew what I wanted since I have a habit of checking out the menu before I go to a new restaurant. I ordered the ceviche combo that had three different ceviches: shrimp, tuna, and Mahi mahi, each completely different. It was $17 and on the appetizer part of the menu.  If you like ceviche, this is a MUST.

My husband order the taco combo with three different tacos, beans and rice. It was also $17. That brought us to $34 and we don't usually drink with meals, so we were thinking about adding something on to our order but, already munching on chips and salsa, thought if we ordered something else, we would be stuffed. Our waiter came back and told us our order was a little short to use the coupon and suggested we try the guacamole in a side for $3. We said that would be great and expected a small dab of guacamole. It was actually a decent sized side order and we wondered how big the $10 guac appetizer would be! 

The food was AMAZING. I loved all three ceviches and expected to like the tuna the best, but the mahi mahi was WOW. The two salsas that came with the chips were really good and they had some house bottled hot sauces on the table as well that my husband was taste testing. He said his tacos were outstanding. We didn't really expect anything special so maybe that was why we were so pleased with the flavors, but it was a truly delicious meal and we were positively stuffed and happy that we didn't order anything extra off the appetizer menu!

The atmosphere was nice, but it's open to everything else going on around it as it is sort of just in the middle of things. I'm sure when you get some partying going on there, it can get a little wild, but it was very subdued and relaxing. We were there on a Friday afternoon.

Our service was good, not as good as the food, but our waiter was responsive when we asked for more water and refilled us several times during the menu. The food came out quite quickly, our chips were refilled right away when we asked for more, and the bill was brought in a timely manner. With the Restaurant.com certificate, we paid less than $20 with tax and tip and couldn't stop talking about how good the food was. For a Vegas strip restaurant, the prices were decent. I highly recommend it but go to Restaurant.com first!  Unfortunately, they've changed the restaurant.com certificate though to $25 off of $50, but I still say go for it!

Chips were ok, as noted by a previous reviewer, and the salsa was ""meh"".  I had the pork carnitas tacos, plate comes with rice and refried black beans.  Most of the pork was OK, but had to pick out a decent amount of charred crispy and fatty bits. Rice was totally undercooked, no flavor.  Black beans had ZERO flavor. No joke, like zip zilch zero flavor. My date had the Alambre taco plate, with same bland rice and beans. He claims his tacos were ""ok, not bad"".  

Our drinks weren't any better. I had the lemon drop margarita, date had the mojito. Neither drink got drank completely. Mine was so sour and  undrinkable, I wondered if it was made with a gone-bad batch of sour mix by a rookie who's first shift on the job was that night (any of you bartenders out there know what I'm talking about).  Mojito was average. 

If you find yourself staying at the Luxor, it's your first night in Vegas, you're starving and ready for a good cocktail, DO NOT GO HERE. Keep walking. Act like you don't even see it.  Spare yourself the frustrations of a severely sub-par meal at what we've now renamed ""Taints & Tequila"" and go grab a slice and a Coke at NYNY.  Then hit the main lobby bar just down the escalator for some well-poured totties. Cheers!  (But seriously, don't go here. It's superbly not good).",R9MD1TC0kIaaNEJWRLmnig,0,0,1,y_W1LEvsz_KthcRi02R1Iw

I arrived during Happy Hour (11am-6pm), and noticed they had frozen margaritas (lime) on the list, but not regular margaritas. Regular margaritas start at $12, but the happy hour frozen margaritas were only $5. It didn't take too long to convince myself I had to try one. I don't know if it was the empty stomach, or the coldness of the margarita, but I had a combination of alcohol-buzz and brain-freeze at the same time. Talk about being hit pretty hard!!

For food, I had the Fiesta Nachos and the Flautas, both $5. They were both small portions - the Nachos came in small bowl, and the Flautas on a small plate, and there were 4 of them. Both dishes were tasty, although they appeared to be rather skimpy with the toppings on the nachos, so there were many chips which were dry and plain.

I had two margaritas, plus the nachos and flautas, which came to $20 plus tax and tip - not too bad. 

If you like tequila, they have a HUGE selection of tequila to choose from! I'm not a big tequila fan, outside the occasional margarita, however if I were, this would be the place to go!!

Service was friendly - I sat at the bar, and my bartender was really nice and chatty.

We ordered the chicken nachos to start, and tacos for an entree (polo & their specialty ones).  The nachos were big enough for two, and really loaded and tasted good.  We polished them off pretty quickly.  Then our entrees came out, and our small two seater table was suddenly crowded.  No one - not the food runner, nor our server who walked by us three times - thought to take away the big empty platter from the middle of our table.  

We had just started in on our tacos when the waiter finally came back to the table - but not to ask if we were okay, give us more water, or take away the platter - to hand us the check.  Seriously?  We hadn't even gotten to our second out of three tacos yet, and you're handing us the check?  We had wanted dessert, but obviously he was in a rush to get us out of there for some reason.  It wasn't even busy in there, nor are we people that linger unusually long (dinner from start to finish is a 45 minute to an hour long affair.  We sit, order, eat, pay and leave).  

We ate our food, and the waiter came by twice to ask if the check was ready yet, which it wasn't.  And he looked slightly annoyed when I asked for a to-go box.  With annoyance, we finally paid and got our asses out of there.

I leaned against a wall and noticed a young lady who was dressed nicely sitting attentively in a chair.  I figured she was waiting for her date so I didn't think much of it.  After 20 minutes we were sat directly in front of the lady who I'd noticed.

We placed our orders.  He ordered the first margarita on the list, and the chicken tacos.  I ordered the ginger mango margarita and the crab tostadas. 

They brought out chips and two types of salsa; both were yummy.  

The margaritas tasted good.  The tequilas chosen complimented the base flavors nicely.

My fiance liked his tacos, but noted that they were a bit small.  He cleaned his plate, and that almost never happens. 

My crab tostadas were small as well.  Think of it as 3 round tortilla chips piled high with a mayonnaise-y crab and avocado mix.  They were hard to eat - kind of messy, you know?  But on the plus side, the crab was real crab.

Ordered the food and it came out lightening fast, and not ehhh looking like some places will if you get there too close to closing (some more brownie points)

Service was great, always refilling & asking how we were doing (add a couple more)

And of course, the food was killer, so that just seals the deal.  I had the appetizer sampler, since I couldn't decide on just one thing, and I loved it.  The flautas were so crunchy and the meat inside was deliciously seasoned.  The tamale had more sauce than I liked, but with a killer kick of spice on both inside/out.  The shrimp quesadilla with that chipotle topping was just, yum!!!  BF had the beef (which I wish I could remember the name) and it was super smoky!  Had a very nice bacon touch to it too, and we were set for the night.

We've scoped this place out before while walking around Luxor and have been waiting to try it because it looks pretty cool with all the lighting and such and it's right in the middle of the upstairs walking area in Luxor. 

We were seated somewhere in the back which was nice, dark, and secluded. Our waiter was some annoying guy. I think it was just the way he looked and talked that annoyed me though, it wasn't exactly the service lol. He took our drink and appetizer orders and brought us our complimentary chips and dips which were mediocre. I prefer Coke rather than Pepsi but they only had Pepsi so that's what I got. 

We ordered the appetizer sampler to share. Bleh, it wasn't really good at all. Pretty bland and plain; I probably could've made something similar using Del Taco food. The presentation kinda sucked too, as you can tell by the picture.  We also ordered the Taco Trio to share. I liked that it came with black beans since I like black beans more than pinto. I only tried the chicken taco and I remember it being pretty good. 

After our entr√©e we ordered the Fried Ice Cream for dessert. I've definitely had better fried ice cream elsewhere, but this was alright. We didn't finish it though. 

That was the highlight of my experience there was the free booth pictures. We went to use their photo booth which said $3, but once we got into the booth it just told us to sit and smile, then after taking 6 pictures, it printed it and that was it, FREE.

Usually I come to T&T for one taco and a quick drink before heading off to do whatever on the Vegas strip. This time, I grabbed a plate and took advantage of the bottomless frozen margarita deal that's available until 3pm. The #1 Alembra tacos were just as good as always. Juicy filet mignon meat, bacon and cheese. One great combo. 
 
The frozen margaritas were good but I'm not sure how anyone can truly get there money's worth. Like a regular margarita, these can be downed fast but unlike a regular margarita...brain freeze or in my case spine freeze is to follow. Yep I'm weird LOL. You can try chugging them as fast as possible to get in the amount of margaritas to make it worth it but it'll be a bumpy road. It will also be a funny one if you're with a group of friends and like seeing the facial expressions from the freeze. 

This was another great time at T&T. I've yet to try any other taco here to date but that's ok. The #1 Alembra tacos are awesome and more importantly, it has BACON!!!

There were four of us, we each ordered an entree and one alcoholic beverage. The total AFTER the coupon, which included the tip, was 84 dollars. After the coupon... Yep.

The only reason this place did not get four stars was because the server seemed very awkward, she was unsure of what certain ingredients were, she kind of just stood there and stared at us for extended periods of time. Then she came back and asked if she could bring us some chips and salsa while we waited for our food. We saw several other tables with the chips and salsa and assumed it was a courtesy, free, item.  It was not, and the server did not specify this, we were NOT pleased. It is generally expected in restaurants that serve chips and salsa that they are complimentary. Chevy's as well as any other Mexican or Tex-mex style restaurant I've ever been too - they have been complimentary. Luckily, the coupon included the tip to the server because the amount I would have given her dropped significantly after I saw that on the bill. I noticed other reviewers saying the chips and salsa were complimentary, that must have changed because we were definitely charged for them.

It was late and we just wanted a bite to eat and since we happened to be at Luxor picking up tickets for a show for a friend .... T&T was convenient.

Service: Slow and seemed like we were putting him out.  He didn't write down our order and had to repeat it to us 4 times coming back twice to verify.  All we ordered was veggie tacos and the combo tostado app.  It's not like it was complicated.

Food: Chips and Salsa were awesome. 
Combo tostado was good and the right size for just wanting something small to eat.  The veggie taco plate was good... but the beans and rice were cold when they were served.  Tacos are small so if you're super hungry you won't get filled up on them.  But if you just need something small, these are perfect sized.

We started, as one does at a Mexican restaurant, with tortilla chips and salsa.  There was a red and a green salsa and both were great.

I usually get the fajitas when I visit a new Mexican restaurant, but I saw a plate at the next table that looked too delicious and filling to skip, so I ordered it.  It was the most amazing pulled beef burrito.  The meat just melted in the mouth.

The rest of my party tried the steak fajitas, huevos rancheros, and a pork dish (of which I don't remember the name).  All were amazing.

She seated us in less then 3 minutes but that's expected when the restaurant is not busy. There might have been at the most 15-18 other patrons in the restaurant so not busy at all. As we sat at our table waiting for the waiter, we realized that 15 minutes had elapsed and no one had asked what we wanted to drink. Finally, our waiter appears, he does not apologize for the unexplainable long wait, which immediately changed the atmosphere even more.  We ordered drinks, pepsi and a water with a lemon wedge, sounds easy right? Wrong the waiter screwed  that up. After we brought the mistake to his  attention, he said that he would correct it after  he took our dinner order. We gave him our  order. An appetizer, and two entrees. Another  20 minutes passed and no food, no corrected  drinks, no ""is everything ok"" from the waiter. I  might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the  appetizer should come first. Well that didn't  happen. We never saw it. 35 minutes of lost  time. After 35 minutes we thought that any  reasonable person would make the decision to leave.  As we stood to leave, a waiter we have never seen before rushed out with the entrees. I caught a glimpse at the food and  thought, ""holy smokes these are small tacos!"".  For  $17 I would have expected something that  would fill me up, not finger food. The tacos at  taco bell are larger to give you an idea.  We notified a manager and explained the poor service but he obviously does not have any true managerial experience because a good experienced manager would try to correct the problem.

My sister, brother-in-law, and I took the aunties and uncles who visited from all over the world here for happy hour. Located inside Luxor, the surrounding view from the restaurant was pretty neat!

We ordered a bunch of the appetizers and pitchers of margaritas. The service was excellent and fast.

We decided to eat here because of the HH specials. Nothing on the regular menu jumped out at me, but I do like half price, so.....this is where we ate!

They give you one complimentary basket of chips and tomatillo and salsa. The tomatillo was good, especially when you squeeze fresh lime on it.

We started with the fundido (chorizo on the side) and that was good. It comes with 3 warm flour tortilla wraps to dip in the cheese. (We needed another 3 since it wasn't enough).
We also had some guacamole. Both were good. I'd probably order both again if I came here. The sangria was good too. I prefer Firefly's red sparkling sangria over theirs, but it was still good. Nothing else on the menu really grabbed me. 

Service was OK. We sat at the bar (so we could get the HH specials). I'd come back here but only for the HH.

Their regular food is way overpriced for Mexican food. Granted it is Vegas and it is in a hotel but seriously the ingredients cannot cost that much. The service was average.

$5 for select appetizers. We got the mango habanero buffalo wings, nachos and the quesadilla. The wings were good but more on the sour side. The nachos were actually pretty good because they have the thicker chips which don't get soggy nearly as quickly.

For starters, their chips and salsa are the bomb. Thick, crunchy chips with a duo of seriously tasty salsas (verde and chipotle), they were the highlight of the meal. We also got some guac, but it had no salt (none on the table, either) and we didn't eat half of it. We also tried the tamales, which wasn't shy on the meat or flavor.

As for drinks, the tequila flights are a bit on the small side. But they're served with a very refreshing shot of kelp juice. The well drinks aren't very good or strong, but the margaritas are.

T&T has a terrific bar with many many types of tequila.  It looks like a good place to hang out with friends and down a few shots.  Speaking of which, they have tequila flights so you can sample a few and decide what you like!

Me and my wife weren't expecting much from this place.. We thought, if nothing else, it would be a decent place to grab a beer and lounge until our show started. The menu enticed us enough to order a round of appetizers. We got the guacamole, which was delicious, served in a generous portion with fresh made chips and salsas. They asked us how hot we wanted them to make the guac, and for a  change, our request was granted. It was plenty spicy, and while I love hot stuff, next time I'll probably get medium so my wife can enjoy it more (we aren't used to things actually being hot when we ask for it).  

We also got a roasted corn, served street style with a slight gourmet twist. It was slathered with aioli, dusted with cotija cheese and chili seasonings, with just the right amount of char on it. My only gripe with this is the price. It costs $8 and you only get one cob. I didn't expect anything more than one, but the price is quite high for what you receive. Either way, it was treat.

Next up was the nachos... definitely the highlight for me. They aren't the typical nachos you'd expect from a place like this. Think of them like high-end ballpark nachos. You get a massive pile of corn chips, layered with refried black beans, guacamole, jalape√±os, and a delicious chipotle nacho cheese. I recommend ordering the steak to top it off. 

Ambience is pretty chill. If you come at a slow time like we did you should be able to relax without too much noise or distraction. The restaurant is open to the rest of the hotel, no walls, no roof, just a straight view up to the top of the pyramid.

I have lived in San Diego for a Loooong time and traditional Mexican food is a standard part of my diet.  The same core ingredients (in the correct proportions) make up the majority of the menu at virtually every Mexican food joint.  Good beans.  Nice rice.  Slow cooked Pork, Chicken, and Beef.  Add a few sauces, salsas, cheeses and tortillas and you just covered the entire menu...which is why your food comes out fast.  So when you tell me three street style tacos cost $17, you already lost me.

Are they good tacos?  Yes.  

Are they magic tacos?  No.

Will the beans grow a magic beanstalk? Not to my knowledge.

If there is one restaurant we tried in Vegas this past trip that we both won't shut up about and we keep telling our friends now heading out to Vegas that they have to try - we're always talking about T&T. I'm seriously in love with this place and I wish there was one closer but since there isn't one closer I can only wait until my next trip out. 
Service was good, food was amazing and we shared a Conga (margarita with 2 upside down Coronas in it) which was definitely a showstopper. 
I ordered the pollo tacos which came with marinated chicken, cilantro, onion, lime and salsa on a corn tortilla and the boyfriend ordered the baja tacos which came with beer battered tilapia fish, chipotle slaw, pica de gallo on a corn tortilla. These were AMAZING!! I couldn't get enough - I wanted to order more but I didn't want to be an extreme fat ass haha The meal comes with three tacos, rice and black beans. The chicken was extremely juicy and the tilapia was fried to perfection - I think my chicken tacos were better but of course the boyfriend thinks his fish tacos were better. 
Our server was very friendly, quick and made sure we were happy the whole time we were there. They don't actually serve the Conga in the restaurant but it's made right across the walkway at one of those stands and the server went over and grabbed us one. He took our order and 5 minutes later our food was out which was great because we had to make it to The Lion King show in Mandalay Bay. He checked in on us to make sure we were doing good and he brought the check out promptly when he seen we were finished and ready to head out.

First of all, the chips and salsa are dang good. The chips are a sort of homemade style (maybe they're actually homemade?) with two tasty salsas. My enchilada was pretty good. Topped with pickled onions, my one true love. So I was happy. My husband got the shredded beef enchilada combo plate and he really liked that as well.

The burrito and beans were still fabulous and the cheese dip and guacamole were delish.

I don't drink alcohol so I can't rave about that but the food was as good as I remembered. The service was slow as hell which I saw a few others commented on and I was hungry and grumpy so it didn't help that our server was slow doing everything. Taking orders. Bringing drinks. Coming back. Clearing unwanted dishes to make space at the small table, etc. 

I bought a cute long sleeve t last time I was here that is soft and fab and I sleep in it so I wanted another. I walked into their little store to see they only have new t shirts in a different fabric but the manager in there was this fantastic friendly gay guy and I can't remember his name but I loved him. I think it was John or Michael but I might be wrong. Anyway, he dug out some old sale shirts and sold me one at a discount made of the same material as my original and told me they don't sell as many shirts as alcohol anymore so they did away with the ones I liked.

Got the frozen cuervo mango margarita for $6. Large in size, not too skimpy on the tequila, and the flavor was just right.

The atmosphere is lively and the staff all friendly. The menu offered so much selection I didn't know what to chose.

We started with the Shrimp 
Ceviche, which actually wasn't as good as what I have had as of late, but it was still decent. 

They brought us chips ( with two different salsas )which we used to scoop up the ceviche.  The green salsa ( said to be the more mild of the two ) burned my mouth, but not to the point of it ruining my dinner.

My husband got the shrimp quesadilla. It was a rather large portion, but what I didn't like was the drizzle of chipotle aioli on the top. I am a very picky bitch ! 

We then split the half size tortillas soup which was awesome ! It too was a really good size ( I can imagine the full size order being quite a lot for one person ) 

We also ordered the taco combo trio which came with black beans and rice. We took these to go since we were stuffed.

T&T is located on the second floor by all the exhibits. If you're really thirty I recommend getting the Chonga. It's a giant goblet of daiquiri topped with two beers that you can release at the time of your choosing.

With our vouchers we got two entrees and 4 drinks. 2 of the drinks were to go.Oh the perks of Vegas!

I usually don't eat anything but fast food in Vegas but Taco's and Tequila is awesome.  Fast friendly service, I'm always greeted with a smile by the hostess.  This particular day we did the mariachi brunch which I have to tell you it was amazing.  The mariachi band is not loud and obnoxious, they are tasteful and even play jams like ""ms. New booty"" very entertaining.  The prices are very reasonable, good atmosphere and absolutely the BEST chilaquiles I've ever had in my life and I've had home made and my local cuisine (I live in California so our local cuisine is authentic).

We were at BlogWord Expo and had dinner planned with friends and colleagues with a group of 15. We asked if seperate checks were doable (as anyone would with a large group) and she said yes. 

We sat down at the table and within minutes the waitress dropped glasses (not one but a few) of water over a friend and the glass shattered all over the floor. My friend was wet. Accidents happen... we get that. But how this was handled was bad. A simple sorry, to be followed by waiting in wet broken glass for 15 minutes until they took care of the situation. 

We brushed that off and ordered our drinks. 20 minutes later we received our drinks and no interest in taking our food order. We had to ask the manager to have our order taken. 10 more minutes later, they began to take our order. Each time we wanted another drink, we had to flag down the waitress. She never proactively checked in on us at all. We waited... waited... for another 45 minutes until food arrived. 

The food was ok. The margaritas were great! So great we asked for a larger glass for each serving. Each serving was in a 16 ounce-ish glass and the larger glass was more like 21 ounce. Not a double portion right? Remember this...

We decided after 3 hours of this service, we decided its time to go. Asked for the check and they brought it out on one. We asked them prior if separate checks were ok. We asked for the manager... apparently their cash registers can not handle separate checks past 12 people. This took rocket science apparently so the waitress gathered several people and begun doing backroom calculus to divide the check. It had to be that complex, because we waited for another HOUR for the check. That had to have been hard math!

The bills came finally... and those $12 margaritas asked to be in just a little larger glass came out to be $24 each! She didn't tell us she would charge double and not double the size for these drinks!

The worst experience I have ever had! $150 for two people and this bad of service! We didn't even get a ""I am sorry for the wait and service.""

Not once.

Chips and salsa was addicting...just spicy enough to keep you going for more. 
Ordered chicken quesadilla as an appetizer. It was very tasty.
I ordered a combo fajita which although delicious, it was a rather small portion for its cost. The shrimps were my favorite! 

The waiter was great! The atmosphere was very nice and the music was perfect...not too slow or fast while you eat. The price was a bit on the higher end which didn't compensate for the portion sizes but did for the flavor.

4225546,2018-05-07,0,MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA,"This place has what is labeled as ""Best Taco in Vegas"", if that doesn't inspire a visit I don't know what would.  I tried that taco and it was excellent- more on that later.  This restaurant is located inside Luxor Las Vegas on the upper mezzanine level across from the Blue Man Group Theatre.  I recommend making your visit here a combo of dinner and one of the shows at Luxor.

Positives
1) Tacos, Tacos, Tacos!!  Although the menu features burritos, fajitas, and other traditional Mexican food; the tacos are what you should be after.  Our dinner group had non-taco plates and all of the food was great; the tacos were phenomenal!  The ""Best Taco in Vegas"" is their Alambre which is filet mignon tips, bacon, a three cheese blend, chile poblano, onion, and cilantro on a flour tortilla!  It's out of this world and a must have when you come here.  They also have Al Pastor, Carnitas, Grilled Shrimp, and Shredded Chicken.  They also had a pulled pork and fish taco option!  Fantastic.
2) Tequila, Tequila, Tequila!  They have what seems like an endless option of tequilas available.  Whether you like to do shots of tequila or mix them into margaritas you can definitely find your drink here.  I recommend the A√ßa√≠/Berry or strawberry margaritas.  They had a margarita option that included two 7 oz beer bottles tipped upside down; don't remember the name but a lot of people were ordering it!
3) Service was great despite being super busy.  Friendly staff who made great menu recommendations as well as tequila and drink recommendations.  Prompt service, quick drink refills or additional rounds without asking.

Things to Know Before You Go
1) Location inside the Luxor means either parking in self park garage which is a bit of a walk to the hotel or valet parking which you have to pay for and oftentimes is completely full at peak periods.  Plan accordingly and enjoy a show or hang out and have some drinks so the parking situation is worth it.
2) Dining room is fairly limited in size so I recommend that you make a reservation through Open Table before going if you have a group of 6 or less.  Even with a reservation there was a wait.  Do not bring large groups as it will be tough for the restaurant to accommodate everyone in a group larger than 8 sitting together and I would anticipate a long wait.",bK83JqfkLOOayKXjoaR62A,0,0,4,f9wNHqgCUhwcKw0eX0hMdA

We came later on a weeknight and the place was less than half full, but the hostess asked if we wanted to ""wait 15 minutes or so for a table or just eat at the bar"". Huh? We chose to eat at the bar since we were hungry, no big deal.

But then upon sitting down at the bar (which was almost empty, maybe 1 or 2 other people there total), the bartender quickly approached us and asked us to leave since I was with my late teenage daughter who is underage. I explained that the hostess said we could eat at the bar to which the bartender replied ""Ugh, she keeps doing that! 3rd time tonight!"".

So back we go to the hostess up front saying that they would not let us eat in the bar, and asked for a table (again, it was really only about half full - lots of tables). Still she would not give us a table and instead we were seated at this long strip table that overlooked the Luxor check-in area. We are feeling like lepers at this point, I have no idea why they would not give us a table. Then we watched as others couples came in one after another getting actual tables.....weird. I chalk it up to a young clueless hostess that clearly did not like her job and wanted to be pretty much anyplace else in the world but there that night.

On to the food: it was horrible. Very bland, tasteless, and way overpriced. The drinks were even more expensive. Service was slow and inattentive. Worst Mexican food I've ever eaten. And we were really hungry upon arriving after hiking all day! And yes we were showered up, dressed well and clean in case that's what you were wondering  :)

I filled out the user survey for the Luxor which asked about our dining experience at T & T. I filled it out honestly and respectfully but never heard back from them.

We got a seat at the bar overlooking the hotel lobby. This is the ideal spot to eat at if you're into people watching. Anyway, our waiter comes over and, instead of leaning in to the side and introducing himself (we were just about the only people there) he just stands behind me like a stalker and goes through his spiel.

We each got the taco combo plate, which came with three street tacos (chicken, carnitas, steak), and rice & beans. 

For one thing, who the hell makes a street taco with only ONE corn tortilla? Vendors on the street selling actual street tacos use two. And even worse, these were like tissue paper. I had to cradle this thing like a goddamn baby to make sure if would keep together while I carefully guided it to my mouth. 

Chicken - dry. Steak - pretty good, nice spices. Carnitas - dry.

Tip here is to go for lunch - the burger, the asada sandwich, are excellent.  The bread is super fresh from some local bakery, and these items are NOT on the menu after lunch.  There are plenty of great places to go for dinner, but looking for something around lunchtime (you probably just woke up), this is the place.

Big mistake.
Got a two top table that was in the middle of the walkway like it was in the middle of a street. Uncomfortable and weird.
Chips and salsa arrived quickly. However, the red salsa tasted like you would imagine an old army boot might with a bit of Taco Bell hot sauce on it. It was enough to make me gag. The green sauce was tasty but waaaaay over salted. 
Waitress had to be told 4 times I wanted a Black Russian (I know, not a dinner sort of drink but expected to be out of there with the drink into the theatre) and comes back minutes later with a huge White Russian. ugh. 
Next, my friend and I order, she wants Chicken enchilada then changes her order to appetizer plate of Chicken Tamales because of our time crunch. I order the Chicken Tostada for the same reason. 
Waitress did not cancel the Enchilada, thinks we ordered the appetizer extra. 
When they come out in like 2 minutes they are obviously premade and covered in a horrid sweet sticky red sauce that is absolutely a canned sauce. And cold. 
We finally flag down Waitress to see about my entree, get the misunderstanding cleared up and out comes a ..... Chicken Mexican Salad. Not a tostada as expected but great, maybe that's their twist on things. However, it looked like roadkill even in the dark dismal lighting and it tasted like rained on road kill. It tasted like wet feathers. It was disgusting. I had to spit out the one bite I took. 
Needless to say, I was pissed off at paying for two drinks and one appetizer and shelling out over $35 for crappy dining experience from the table to the waitress to the drink to the revolting food.

To start, though, I ordered the Queso Fandido or something like that. It comes with tortillas, but it's pretty much just a glob of melted cheese. I'm used to eating queso that has dip-ability (haha, word creation ftw), but this one was the equivalent of microwaving shredded cheeze and adding chorizo as a garnish.

In addition to these items, I had a white peach margarita, made with patron, but I think it needed a little more alcohol to be worth the price. Still, it had a good taste. Four stars. $12


But what you MUST have which was wonderful, were the chips and salsa. YUM YUM YUM. And for Free! These chips had a fresh crunch, not sure if they were made in house, but I'd love to have some at home when I cook tacos. Served with chipotle and green verde salsas. Five stars!

Was staying at the Luxor for my brother's 21st, and the location and name of this restaurant was alluring, but nothing more than a clever ruse to dupe guests in to patronizing this sham. We arrived around 6:00 on a Wednesday, and were seated pretty quickly. That may have been the only good thing about the experience.

Drinks. Our waiter attended to us quickly, took our order for two margaritas - no salt - and came back with two margaritas - with salt. He took them away and brought them back,  and judging by the salt water flavoring, had clearly just dumped the beverages in to a new glass. Pretty stunning for a fully staffed dinner crew with a half-full service. 

Appetizers. We ordered the beef taquitos. Those too came out pretty quickly, but the dish was paltry. It looked and tasted (quacks like a duck...) like two microwaved, frozen, taquitos from the local Wal-Mart frozen food section. They were sliced in half and drizzled with sour cream to make it look more appetizing, didn't help. 

Dinner. I ordered the shredded pork tacos, which came over-stuffed in to mini-disc sized tortillas, thrown next to some rice and black beans, and drizzled once again with the same uninspiring ""creama fresca"", cool story bro. This is something I could have gotten at a chain restaurant for about $6 less. At least there I know I get what I'm paying for. Yikes. What was worse was the seafood relleno that my little brother got. It was clearly frozen seafood slopped on to a small serving of rice in a mushy pepper and slapped with a $19 price tag. Genius. 

TL;DR

The service was poor, the food was worse, and grossly overpriced. With so many options in and around the hotel, you'd be a fool to waste your time and money here regardless of the circumstances.

Ambiance could be improved. The restaurant is located next to the Titanic and Bodies exhibit, also leaving the majority of the seating area exposed to the rest of the casino. 

Service was decent as we were there for lunch so we were not competing with a packed bar or a packed dining room for that matter. My friend and I were one of only a handful of parties there.

Chips & Salsa - Nice, warm, puffy chips, lightly salted with good texture and crunchiness. Comes with two salsas - a chipotle with some heat and my favorite, the green salsa with a nice tangy flavor.

My main entree - I opted for the al pastor tacos, comes with rice and beans. Beans and rice were perfectly fine. The tacos I have varying opinions. First off they did not skimp on the meat - my tacos were so filled (3 of them) I was not hungry when I left. I take issue with the way the al pastor was spiced - much, much sweeter than I have ever had before. Also, with the amount of meat in these tacos, it would have been nice had they done a double corn tortilla wrap.

DO ask for extra chips.
DO try the hot sauces on the table.

My husband had the Beef Barbacoa Enchiladas ($18.00) . Since he was getting them I wanted to order something different. I wish I didn't because it was really good and that's coming from a girl who doesn't really eat Enchiladas. The beef was tender and the sauce had this sweet taste to it. 

I had the taco combo ($17.00) that came with Chicken, Carne Asada, and Carnitas. The meat was really tender and tasted fabulous with lime spritzed on them. The meals come with black beans and rice. I just opted for the rice which was also good it was nice and fluffy and not too salty.

The corn was roasted well and not overcooked, while it was covered in chili powder & cheese.  It was definitely a good selection and I recommend it to anyone not on a first date (cheesy corn on the cob could be a bit messy); 3.5 stars.
For my entree I got the carne asada tacos and was pleasantly surprised at the flavor, because it looked almost generic and old upon presentation.  But, the tacos themselves were quite good & fresh, although they were on the small side.  The added rice & beans were good, but not great, and definitely tasted a bit older or part of a massive creation.  A solid dinner choice, 3.5 stars.
My fiance got the beef barbacoa and it was not that good.  The rice & beans certainly tasted very similar to mine, but her meat had a slightly odd flavor to it; not spoiled, but odd and overpowering.  A below average choice, 2.5 stars.
As for drinks, we both got the strawberry agave margarita and enjoyed it.  It tasted so good that we thought it lacked alcohol, but as we soon found out that we were wrong :).

The soup is a bowl and not a cup.  It has a lot of chicken so you can have it alone for lunch and be full.  The flavor is not impressive but it's still good.  El Torito soup is much better than this.

All three tacos in the sampler were dry and that sucked.  The flavors were weak.  The rice was properly done but the black beans were bland.

All in all, better to just go to a Chipotle for *much much* better tacos.  Also a *good* El Torito location will also blow this place out of the water.

We went yesterday around 4pm for dinner. The 2 chatterbox girls that were greeting guests informed us that a water pipe broke so the bar was closed and no alcohol would be available. One of them(I so wish I knew her name) said we could go to the bar across from them and bring in drinks.  We went there and found the selection to be limited. She also mentioned that the Aurora bar down stairs was a nice bar.

We went down stairs on her recommendation, bought drinks and returned. I said ""2 please"". She said excuse me in the most condescending way you could imagine. I repeated myself, and she had the audacity to say "" I have to ask you to finish your drinks before you come in"". I asked why. She says I don't know what's in that glass. I told her it was Grand Mariner(I'm sure she has never heard of it or could afford it). She repeated herself and we left.

Bottom line is their bar was closed. They could not provide alcohol, so we brought our own and we're turned away. Most people would say screw this place as soon as they found the bar was closed. We wanted to eat here so bad we were willing to get our own booze and come back just so we could eat here. 

This is not how an educated staff treats loyal customers. Even if we were first time customers.....do you think we would ever return?

These bad attitude children that run this place are running it into the ground.

We were tempted by this HH because it starts at 2:00pm and we had some time to kill waiting for friends to arrive in town. The bartender was pleasant enough. The $5 drink menu is very limited...sangria, shots of Jose, beer, well drinks (What Mexican restaurant HH does not include a HH margarita??? Apparently only this one...LAME!) The $5 food menu is also pretty limited. While we were deciding what to order we munched on some chips and salsa. We ordered the hot wings, nachos and two rum and cokes, because I don't do shots of Jose and THERE WAS NO HH MARGARITA...super lame. The drinks were small but the chips and salsa are really good. Here is the lowdown on the food:

Hot Wings $5 - 3 sad little breaded wings. They looked and tasted like standard frozen industrial wings from Costco. Did I mention there were only 3 wings...for $5??? WTF?

Nachos $5 - Ugh..how can you ruin nachos? A very small bowl of chips, covered in a tasteless black bean paste (I will let you use your imagination about what this dark, black paste looked like) and an orange substance that tasted like cheese in a can. The topping was sparse and only covered the top layer of chips, which I guess is a good thing because it was vile. I have honestly had better nachos from AM/PM. These were borderline disgusting and after two chips I had to stop eating them.

This happy hour failed to make me happy, and actually made me a little sad and angry. HH FAIL!!!

I looked for a reason not to use the word ""outstanding"" and I couldn't really find one.  I ordered the shrimp tacos (pic) and an iced tea.  Both were exactly to my expectation.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it.  (Menu boasts ""grilled pineapple"" but shouldn't because there was hardly any in there...

The beans and rice were flavorful.  The tortillas used for the tacos are tiny and not impressive.  I think they should change that but that's just preference.  They weren't bad.  (Quantity was just right)

Chips were fresh and crispy and accompanied by two kinds of blended salsa, tomatillo and tomato.  

*  What I'll remember
  
- Nice people (Cara)...   Great food.  Priced just right (not a bargain but I wasn't gouged either!)

after about 5 minutes the busboy showed up with chip ad salsa (not that good, old chips and salsa was bottle stuff)  and i ordered an Ice Tea from him, which came pretty quick. i did have time to look over the menu so i had the kid take my order 3 taco combo plate. chicken, carnitas and carne asada with rice & black beans. i did ask  the kid if they all came on corn tortillas. (told me he would check) within 2 minutes the kid has back and said yes all corn, ok put the order in. he did tell me that he was just a busboy, i told him will now your my waiter thanks. 
1) Rice and Black Beans.
Neither of them had any good flavor, rice was overcooked and the black beans was just uneatable. horrible
2) The Tacos.
the Asada and Chicken tacos had no flavor  over cooked chicken, the asada taco meat was also over cooked with no flavor. The Carnitas taco was pretty good, if i knew i would of just had 3 of them. Carnitas had seasoned pork and a little heat to them was by far the best of the 3 tacos. One other problem with the tacos you only get 1 tortilla on each taco, so after the first bite the bottom drops out and your eating them with a fork.
Only time a saw the waiter was when he brought the check..LOL yeah sure dick head i'm going to tip you. LOL Idiot. 
The Kid got a good tip, the waiter wannabe .25 cents. 
Food is way over priced for what you get. mini tacos  with rice and beans $18. Ice Tea $3.99. Yep $22 for a $5 Del Taco Meal. This is easily a 1 star but i gave 2 because of the kid.",INqmiMMxGIYzcQRMFc3RuQ,2,1,2,CiZTk4jEE9fOddtAiCAFFg

5060126,2013-06-17,10,MAuSh7NKoT__CQ4BumoayA,"Delish Cheese Enchilada & Chili Relleno with a Berry Finish

SITREP

While we were waiting to hit the clubs inside the LUXOR, my buddies Chris, Tkiller and I decided to hit T&T because, dam if we weren't already hungry, and we didn't want to wait on what we heard were going to be ""gratuitous hoer'dorves"" which would probably be snatched up fast if anything.

THE SETUP

T&T has a prime location right on the 2nd Floor store mezzanine level of the Luxor Pyramid, right as you get off the escalator in fact.  Since I guess everyone is hitting buffets in Vegas, there actually was NO LINE at this delicious boutique Mexican Restaurant, and so we grabbed the opportunity.

THE MENU

I'm all about enchiladas to be honest.  In fact, a cheese enchilada & chili relleno combo - with accompanying beans & rice - is my personal litmus test on how well I rate a Mexican restaurant and whether I will be back.  Let's just say that if I get to Vegas again and am in the mood for Mexican, I WILL be back here!

THE FOOD

The enchilada was absolutely delectable with a spicy mole sauce.  And the chili relleno was actually BIG & CRISP in it's battered shell and full of cheeses.  I was in heaven on this count.  But it got better because the refried beans were great, and mixed with the Mexican rice, and added salsa fresca and cheese salsa, made for a most excellent chip dip.  [And yes, I got quite full.]

MARGARITAS

The berry margaritas were outstanding, and in fact I got two.  Nice & limy tart but fully flavorful for all tastebuds and still with a bit of berry sweetness (mostly blueberry).  The damage for me was about $40, with the two berry margaritas actually more than the meal, but hey, it's Vegas.

AMBIANCE

This is an open air restaurant in the midst of the Luxor Mezzanine, so there is quite a bit of white noise from the different areas of the hotel & casino activities that filter this way, especially with shoppers blitzing all around and conversing since this is the shopping level as well, and no sound barriers (no walls, no screens, no glass, etc.).  But once you get acclimated to that din, you don't notice it after awhile, and though I know some peeps are very particular about barriers, I'll make a point of noting that but am not going to deduct a rating when I'm really about the FOOD and the DRINKS.

CUSTOMER SERVICE

Props to our server and our hostess.  Absolutely darling gals - which got the *FLIRT* quotient on our experience there quite high with us guys.  But on top of that, Chris' droid and my iPhone were DYING and the gals let us charge up at their hostess stand, which apparently had a boatload of outlets all around it.  Bless them!

And I will admit that for a HOTEL restaurant (as opposed to a stand-alone restaurant venue), this was quite an outstanding experience!

I ordered the guacamole -- which was delicious. In my opinion, I think they should cut the portion in half and charge half. It was $10 for a bowl of guac the size of my head. Perfect for a group of four, not so much for a group of two. It's easier to order more portions when bigger groups come through.

Anyway... I ordered the fish tacos, which came in a set of three alongside rice and beans. The tacos were lightly breaded and the white fish was tasty, flaky and good. I took one bite of the rice and beans and didn't really care for the rest. My sister ordered the shrimp tacos and didn't like them as much.

There is a great amount of options on the menu and we had difficulty in deciding just what to eat. It seems though that whatever you order is great as we all loved the food. The food was a solid 5 stars!

HOWEVER, the service. 2 stars. I had asked about the virgin margaritas, the waiter was snarky as he had supposedly read them out to someone else on the table. Had I heard him I wouldnt have asked. If hubby and I had been here alone then we would have told him to forget it and gone elsewhere seeing as his attitude was terrible. It seemed he just didnt want to be there at all. Not great for the restaurant at all.

If the service had been good then I think I would have been in a better position to give a great review opposed to just an ok.",yMxcK-tnPDq0tDnBAhDDOg,0,0,3,Agnb1_GHoCRxfE2U8OgYlg

One star was knocked off right off the bat because the hostess told my husband to ""ditch the drink"" before we sat down. Really? Those were her exact words! I seriously take that as an insulting way to ask someone to get rid of their drink. It was a martinellis apple juice too. 

Luckily our visit got better from there after I muttered a bunch of crap under my breath as the hostess walked us to our table. And yes, lady, I WAS talking to YOU. 

I ordered the Alambre tacos. I wouldn't say it was dripping in flavor. I barely tasted the bacon and it would have been much better with some Mexican cheese. My husbands cheese enchiladas on the other hand were delicious. Chips and salsa was pretty good. I always enjoy salsa verde. The house salsa tasted salty. Rice and beans were also pretty standard tasting. Now for the corn on the cob appetizer.....it was so good we contemplated getting one to take back up to our room for later. It was seriously nomzzzzzzzzzz!!!!!

Woulda given this place a better rating had the hostess had a little more class. I understand rules and regulations, but I don't understand asking someone rudely to ""ditch the drink"". Thank you and good night.",BjHK42BK2TV7CCBRFxW3Ew,1,0,3,siUJiS2udR7gy_sWUOs5tA

I don't care where I'm staying in Vegas, I come here to eat once every visit. There's parking all around for free in surrounding hotels so suck it up, put some comfy shoes on and make your way to this spot located on Luxor's second level.

I'm from Baltimore so pay very close attention to the next few words: GET THE CRAB TOSTADAS! They do so much justice to my favorite crustacean on this appetizer, I'm trying not salivate over my space bar right now.  They've boosted up their menu selections but the fajitas are still a fave of mines. I also love how they give a variety in salsas with your chips!

The bar has a VERY nice variety. I mean they were one of the first bars I saw to have Castries Peanut Rum Creme liquer (never had it? get with it) and this was before I even saw it in liquor stores on the East coast (it's bottled in Bowie, Maryland). Again, the price of their full bar will get to ya pockets a little bit but make the best of it by getting a mixed drink if you were planning to hit the tables later.

I ignored my instinct though because the menu said that they were made with Filet mignon tips, so I went ahead and ordered. When the order arrived, I was horrified. The ""tacos"" were wrapped in a SINGLE corn tortilla. I damn near fainted. Who does that?! The wind was gone from my sails, but I still had hope for the filet mignon tips. When I bit into the taco, I hit a new personal low in my life. The meat was wholly unseasoned. No marinade. No nothing, nothing to identify it as a taco whatsoever, it tasted like meat in a corn tortilla, super bland. Someone thought THIS was the best Vegas had to offer?! For shame Vegas, for shame! You need to get out more. For the same price you can eat Los Tacos tacos, which is like the closest thing to having sex with your own face I can find. Or for a fraction of the price you can have some seriously bomb street tacos from any of the street truck vendors who all use TWO corn tortillas, as any taco with any self respect should.
