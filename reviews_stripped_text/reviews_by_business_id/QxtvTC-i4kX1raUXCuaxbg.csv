The last 2 times we tried to order from here, they were out of food and/or did not have a delivery driver. When the owner said they didn't have a driver for delivery last time, we said thank you anyway. I kid you not she practically begged us to order from her and said she would deliver it to us herself after they close so we said okay. 

We waited over an hour and a half for 2 medium pizza's and some wings that were all cold. The pizza's were sloppily put together, and the all meat pizza which is supposed to have pepperoni, sausage and bacon, had no bacon, no sausage, but pepperoni and chicken! WTF. Had they let us know they were out of certain toppings, we would have changed our order. They clearly do not have their shit together here, and I will not be going back.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,2,1,6RGg-EFauOqB4CHKgucv5A

I never ate there when it was Mexican food, but I got a pizza or two when it was Charleston Pizza. Not my favorite by a long shot but actually not bad. However, I ran in there the other day before hitting the climbing gym, to find a new lady working the kitchen. The menus now say ""Charleston Pizza and Mexican food"" with ""and Mexican food"" written in Sharpie. Place was cleaner than convenience store it is located in and the lady was so nice. I ordered a Stromboli with pepperoni, mushrooms and ham, and boy was it good!  I was told the dough was fresh, not frozen, and it was cooked to perfection. The mushrooms were probably from a can, but I'm good with that. Plenty of cheese and toppings. And it was huge! (TWSS). I actually ate there with my daughter and we took in the show of interesting people coming and going.  I think the nice lady assumed we were going to take it to go, which was a reasonable assumption, but once I said we were going to eat in, she brought us a set of mis-matched plastic plates which was really neat and brought everything together in a unique way.  I felt like these might have been some plates her kids used growing up across multiple ages and somehow survived the years and now she is sharing this part of her family with us. 

Based on a single order of a Stromboli, I rate 5 stars. This does not take into consideration the location which is sketchy or the fact it only has two rickety old tables if you decide to eat there. I assume most do take out. I ate there because I like the adventure, which is a trait I highlight in my PoF profile. Speaking of PoF, this is not a place you'd take a date early into a relationship, although it might be a great place to take a steady to see if she's really into you. This is a place you'd go to experience real life and real people and treat your taste buds to a dining experience that can stand on its own merits in spite of the fact most people would probably pass by with their nose in the air, never giving more than a passing glance to this unassuming place.",4tBboKZrkVWp4IZES_wqug,1,1,5,NwN_PB_4p4HmBMQnEQZLWA
