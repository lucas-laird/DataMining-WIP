20832,2011-09-24,0,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"After debating on where to eat for lunch, a friend and I decided to try this cafe out.  It was simple, yet classy, but what else would you expect from an eatery inside Neiman Marcus.

As soon as we sat down, our waiter came over and took our drink orders.  He also served us their famous puff pastry with a side of strawberry butter and some kind of broth.  Since we have never been here before, we didn't know what the broth was for.  We looked around to see if anyone was doing anything with theirs (We felt out of place as it was...), and didn't see anything, so we just left it.  We later found out that we were supposed to di the pastry in it.  Anyway, I LOVED the puff pasty.  It was light and delicious.  Perfect little starter!  My friend didn't care much for it though.  Oh well.

I ordered the Chicken Paillard.  I couldn't pass up all the yummy veggies in it!  All in all, it was good, but nothing too special.  However, at under 500 calories, I really couldn't complain.  They tell you how many calories are in each item on their menu, which helps with eating ""healthy"".  Friend ordered the turkey wrap (I think), and she seemed to enjoy that was well.

Service was decent.  I liked that the waiter wasn't overbearing, yet our drinks were filled every time they were about half-way done.  He was attentive and very nice.  The staff wasn't snobby or anything.  The lady that sat next to us didn't like what she ordered and he switched it out, no questions asked.  

If anything, I will say that the cafe is a little pricey, but again, what would one expect from a cafe in Neiman.  

Would I come back?  Sure, why not.  Is this the absolute best place to eat at Fashion Show?  Probably not, but it's definitely worth a try once.",EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,2,0,3,2thTJuK2bxGazNyMUlcMjw

I had asked the SA for a recommendation that was close, not fast food, and decent and she recommended it. I was a bit skeptical because hey, she does after all work for NM! I went and I was pleasantly suprised. 

The menu is mostly American with some Asian fusion and the like mixed in. I can't believe Im saying this, but they had the most awesome fries EVER. I can ignore sweets for anything, but fries on the other hand are my chocolate. These were fantastic. I guess it was the seasoning but either way, they were freaking yummy! 

They have great salads, burgers, and sandwiches as well as an extensive bar. Great little place to go if you're shopping in the area and you get lazy like I did. I was very pleasantly suprised with this place.",jmKtpUz93SGbbpRkp05yWQ,2,1,5,l0jnsynD_tF3thyZtikKrg
1257822,2013-04-15,0,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"I have been in Vegas for 8 years, eaten here quite a bit.  Has always been very good up until the last 2 trips.  They may be under new management or something, but the food and service has taken a real downward dip recently.  2 trips ago, my wife and I both sent back our burgers, which normally are a mainstay of the menu-thick, handmade, juicy, delicious.  This one was mushy and overlooked-clearly a pre molded frozen patty.  Response to that was a shake of the head and an explanation of ""that's what we have now.""  Also had to specially request the popover and broth pre-meal.

Last trip was this Saturday, an even worse experience.  Started off by ordering problems-I asked for the turkey sandwich (now that the burger is no good), and inquired whether it was hot since it advertised melted cheese.   Was told no,,but that I could have hot if I wanted.  Also asked for no mayo or lettuce.  Sandwich arrives, cold and with lettuce and mayo.  I send it back, the lady brings it back still with the lettuce, then asks if I am ok with the lettuce still being on the sandwich.  Wanting to eat with my family I accept, but open further inspection, still had mayo as well.  Sent back again, sandwich #3 came back cold again, this time with  no cheese and a snippy comment from the server which seemed to warn me that I was out of favors.  Ended up eating about half before quitting.  

Last insult-bill comes, no apology for the trouble from anyone-just a free cookie and no discounts on the bill.

Also forgot to mention, had to basically bully my way into popover bread again-apparently they were out.  Server wanted us to take hummus and pita instead?  And no broth-maybe they have stopped that?

NM, please straighten this out and give us back our restaurant!  This new version is awful and definitely not worth $60 for a two person lunch.",30mk2NfMqwjp5HOn6hBlcA,2,0,1,1O244j9-SqqJIS_eH-6TZw

We both had the white raspberry martini, it was amazing!! They even put fresh raspberries in the drink. I ordered the calamari salad that came with a spicy aioli dressing. It was delicious! Definitely would order again!! My husband had the turkey club, he said it was yummy but not as yummy as my salad! :P

1950034,2009-01-10,6,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"I guess having lunch here was a fitting way to end my latest Vegas get away: fitting because even this place has a bar.
Does every eatery in Vegas serve alcohol?
But no big complaints.

Out of all the menu items, I settled on a simply cheeseburger and fries.
With all the buffets and Asian eats, I've forgotten how good a burger could taste: seasoned ground beef cooked to perfection with a thick slab of cheddar on a toasted ciabatta bread.
Good stuff.

There were a couple other things that did surprise me:
1) the service was attentive without hovering.  For some reason, I assumed lunch was going to be uncomfortable.  I was pleasantly mistaken.
and
2) they serve a popover at the start of the meal and was accompanied with a small plate of strawberry jam and cream cheese.  It was warm and tasty but I wished it was given at the end of the meal because it felt more like a dessert item than starter.

Overall, I liked the NM Cafe.  I don't know if I'll return since my loyalties lie more with my trusty Nordies Cafe.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,11,11,3,5HtniUz2iitfmr2UB9T8Xg

A few minutes later our server appeared and he seemed rather uninterested in us. He put a menu with the specials on it between my friend and I  and said he would return when we were ready to order. He didn't emphasize the drink specials or what specials were on the menu. A few moments later, he came back and we ordered. When I asked for a water, he brought me warm water and TOSSED not handed me the straw. So unprofessional!

I hate to complain and hardly saw my waitress anyway.)  By the time I had eaten half of my salad, I had set about ten pieces of wilted greens off to the side of my plate.

3799104,2013-01-04,2,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"My mother is a Dallas native, home of the Neiman Marcus empire. I grew up going to the Neiman Marcus café, once upon a time called the Mermaid Bar, in Dallas during the summers. I vividly remember grilled cheeses with pickle spears daring to touch the soft white bread on my plate, mucking up the deliciousness of the grilled cheese with its nasty pickle vapors and juice. But most of all, I remember the cookies. The famed Neiman Marcus cookie of legend. Delicious over-chocolatey goodness I can never seem to recreate, and unfortunately, neither can Las Vegas's NM Café. 

Lunch was good, don't get me wrong, but the cookies left something to be desired. I think it was probably because they are clearly baked somewhere else and shipped in. In the words of the immortal Judge Judy, don't pee on my leg and tell me it's raining. In other words, don't try to sell me last week's $4 cookie that arrived off the truck from Delaware or Sri Lanka or wherever and say it's baked fresh, cuz it ain't.

I'll get off my cookie soapbox now. I ordered a chicken wrap with avocado and basil aioli. I forget how much I love basil, and with avocado it was interesting and inspiring for my next batch of guacamole. My mom, craving her old Dallas standby, ordered the chicken salad sandwich. She said it tasted the same as what she was expecting, which is good for somebody familiar with the NM of yore. Both included a lil fruit cup with berries and a delicious eggy popover roll with fruit butter to start the meal. Yummy!

Service was friendly, though as it filled up it got a little less attentive (which I suppose is to be expected to some degree). The view is cool of the outside of the mall and of the Wynn. 

It's a teeny place and not too much on the cheap side, but a nice spot for a throwback to the bygone fancy department stores.",ugNQV0isqQSAuuGzoK87sQ,2,5,4,9UNMY6byqHlvhpAVUu6FDw

However, the food has been getting worse and worse and today was the last straw,   I have decided not to eat here anymore. I work in the mall so I have gotten a take out lunch from this cafe many times. It is close to my store and convenient for me.
I usually get a salad but the last few times I've gotten the classic cobb its been overloaded with blue cheese ( to the point where I've had to start picking the many bigger chunks out). And  while I'm mentioning big chunks, everything in the salad is too large. Big chunks of chicken you could choke on, whole lettuce leaves,  big slices of avocado, etc).I usually spend 10 minutes chopping the salad up into edible pieces before I start eating. 
So, remembering I've had some not great salads recently from them,  I thought, "" today, let me get something different"" . I ordered the Helen Corbitt's classic chicken salad sandwich which was supposed to come with fruit and chips.  When I got back to my store after picking it up there was no fruit, no chips, only a wilted dry used looking pickle.  (  I actually wondered if this pickle was a reject from someone else's plate)  The chicken salad itself was SO beyond salty,  it was inedible. I had to throw it out.  $9 in the garbage. I called them to complain but of course the answering machine was on and no one called me back even though I did leave a detailed a message.
The chef needs to stop with the salt immediately. HE also needs to think about presentation and sticking to the menu. What a disappointment my lunch was and the worst part is - I'm still hungry !

Oh yea I will be back!!!,m96igVtonhN98jfF63lr8Q,1,1,4,-mPP1wBOg4boGBk7U5LJ8w

As far as their dishes go, they are mediocre. Nothing noteable.
I come here for breakfast or lunch. Never a wait. Nice place to eat alone or with a friend to chit-chat before shopping.",hO4udcR5A5WJRzVDWAWqsw,1,0,3,B9SCdv2-QWD7WN6cHICY3g

Food 2/5: The popover served with strawberry butter was delightful. We both ordered the tomato soup which was on the specials menu (and on the regular menu). The soup was the highlight! It was delicious. The tomato broth was a thicker consistency and it was tangy and spicy. It also had a few tortellinis, shredded white harder cheese and mushrooms. My friend ordered the calamari salad for her entree and was very happy with her dish. So, based on food so far, why the 2/5? For my entree, I ordered the veggie and hummus wrap. The veggies were grilled and crisp but the hummus had something in it that made me think of furniture polish, like Pledge or something. YIKES, not appetizing. Since I do not like to waste, I tried to take apart the wrap so I could just eat the veggies but, I could still taste the something funny (and not in a good way). So, I ate the side salad.

Service 2/5: Our waiter was OK but, marks decreased when I told him that I didn't care for the wrap, that there was a funny taste going on, he just grunted and took it away.  Given the prices of this cafe, what I would have expected, would be a response better then a grunt, and an acknowledgement, maybe a sorry to hear that and an inquiry if he could bring me something else. I mean I am not at the food court and expect more - by the way, we spent about $54 without tip....so, definitely not at food court or your typical cafe.

Space 2/5: I like the location of the cafe. Top floor of NM - good natural light, lots of windows. Table was not what I consider clean. Crumbs from previous guests, the do not replace the place mats between guests, found crumbs there too. When we sat down waiter saw me wiping crumbs, no acknowledgement, yeah, that should have tipped me off. 

When my friend suggests that we go back, I won't agree next time.",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,3,0,2,5V8B9FeuGasEoUa4k4q0hQ
5398778,2014-10-01,1,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,I'm sorry to say this is not the place it used to be. My chicken sandwich was flavorless and accompanied by a basic salad consisting of spring mix and vinegrette. The iced tea was $4.00 the sandwich was $16 and I left completely underwhelmed. I should have known it was bad since it was dead on a Saturday at lunch time. The view is nice and the service was impeccable but overpriced under-flavored food isn't worth it. There are way too many other options close by.,erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,3,0,2,nCCrvnEHUhox25JGf7zSMA
5432528,2015-01-09,0,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"wow, First time here, really good service and quiet.  The Food was really good.  I got the grill chicken Sandwich. the butter is infuse with Strawberries.

the only Cons: 
are the staff on the corner of the bar waiting and playing on they mobil phones are a eye sore to that place, and to much employs make you feel like you ( the customer) are the one on the wrong place or at they lunch place.

Other that that over all the experience was good.",tCe79OyXbkQxnuRrNpZ4Kg,0,0,4,kaZwpPgW_eEBlyaDvc2u-A

The puff pastry bread and the strawberry butter is DELICIOUS, so good in fact that I would go back just for that.  I also had the chicken hummus wrap which I really enjoyed and was very filling.",_4K-TPguj8W8U_NIsp0r1A,4,0,5,1b6slU0PBWO1X8aKp2oQJQ
5611061,2011-03-23,0,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"Well my friend said this place was one her favorite places to go to for lunch, so we met there for some good food this last weekend.  Well I was very disappointed and my girlfriend kept apologizing for the crappy food.

I will say location and decor is very nice and I will give it a star for that and the service was very good also, another star.  Thats where it stopped.

First, she is raving about these pastry breads that they serve but they were all out for the day.  Our server stated that the cook was refusing to make anymore.  Well our table and the one next to us was very disappointed because this was something that is suppose to be tasty!  I ordered the turkey bacon wrap and it came with a side salad and some fruit.  That was the best part of my meal.  The wrap was gross and flavorless.  I evenutally just starting pulling the turkey out but there was some sauce on it that was not to my liking.

I don't think I will visit this place again for food and come to think about it, not for drinks either.  I think there are better places at Fashion Show.",ip6IbczHeYOT9QVLaJVXkg,0,0,2,WLKQ0oA4a3WLsUXsbjHZjQ

The cool energy and attitude of the bartender Lindsay is infectious. 

Always incredible food here - shoutout to their chef! A great place to kick back and relax.",4fE37HSVJitQlI78K8uM1A,2,1,5,rWgZplkxOFykiMX_GXb5bg

We ordered and shared the grilled cheese sandwich with soup.  Our lovely server even said that since we were splitting the meal, we didn't have to choose the same soup.  He would bring it to us on 2x different plates as whole meals.  Brilliant! 

We were brought a fresh Yorkshire pudding to start off with and this was accompanied by some sort of raspberry butter.  It was DEVINE.

Overall I would definitely pop into this location and try other locations for this business.  Very happy!  
Ps the restrooms were AMAZING.  Very clean and fresh.",UBmnISiLKFQNdqD8_FsgMw,1,0,4,EFb_QySrw5CSrAT7psukNw
5842030,2014-01-17,0,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"This NM Cafe does not live up to the standards of all of the other NM restaurants. 

We sat up at the bar - the bartender was frazzled and unfriendly. 

It took forever to get a chance to ask for refills on water and the food was very mediocre...The patrons sitting adjacent to us had thel same horrible service. I watched two gals wait over 15 minutes before they were able to order. I would have left!

It's a shame because I thought I could always count on NM for quality food and great service...",OnagJ2dnPjfRRT4a_CgKCw,4,0,2,BLuyoif74CW40FjrUgqk6A
5876264,2017-10-27,7,UJuxtm4DtomSaFlfK0X7fg,"Neiman Marcus has a cafe?! Yup. And it's first-class service just like their retail space. Inside the top floor, NM Cafe has a chic space and patio to meet all your needs. Only bummer, they aren't open late.

You're greeted with bone broth, pop over, and strawberry butter. No matter what happens, drink the bone broth. It has magical healing properties that remove any sort of buyers remorse you might be experiencing during your visit to Fashion Show. Just kidding, it's simply delicious.

They have a new chef that is really elevating their specials menu. In my last visit I enjoyed a watermelon Mediterranean style salad that tickled my tastebuds. Their salmon tacos were also enjoyed, but not my favorite. I just couldn't get behind the tortillas as they were a bit chewy, but the salmon was cooked a wonderful medium-rare and melted in my mouth.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,17,15,4,Fs_aJiC7o-tDRWoWnXtiLQ
