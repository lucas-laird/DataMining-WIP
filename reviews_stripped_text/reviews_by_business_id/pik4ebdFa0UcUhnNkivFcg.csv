8569,2016-07-23,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"If I could give this place ZERO stars I would.  Some of the worst service, with the rudest management that I have ever encountered.  My wife planned my 40th birthday dinner there with some very close friends.  We were supposed to get a private room, a 4 course meal, a specialized birthday menu, all for a group price.  Instead we got NO private room, a 4 course meal with the WRONG food that we had pre-ordered, TYPOS on the specialized birthday menu, and we were then overcharged.

When I tried to dispute all of this with the manager - BRETT BODE -- he said there was nothing he could do about it except offer to take a few drinks off of our bill.  He was rude, aggressive, and could care less about customer service.  When I tried to dispute the fact that they overcharged us per the contract we signed he blatantly ignored it.  When I said I will contest the charges with my credit card company he threatened to call security in to escort me out.  After spending A LOT of money there for a milestone birthday with some of my closest friends, I can honestly say that this is by far the WORST service and the WORST manager of a restaurant I have EVER encountered.  While the food is okay, the service is poor and the management runs the place like a factory shuffling people in and out.  I caution you HIGHLY before bringing a large group into this restaurant, especially when Brett Bode, the manage is overseeing the place.  The ABSOLUTE WORST. If i could give it 0 stars I would.  They ruined my 40th birthday, and I am sure I'm not the first person they have done that to.  BEWARE.",RIf-hFIJNS4GeNa_WVKZGQ,0,0,1,_Yh3w6ygVG8fqWxmKiDkXQ

We also got the Carmine's salad which was also enormous.  It was a tossed salad with salami, ham, and cheese, oil and vinegar and it was seasoned  perfectly.

We ended up here because we couldn't get in to the restaurant we had planned to dine at even though it was late at night.  This was a great find and we will surely be back again next time we are in Vegas.

The mussels are HUGE almost not edible and the white wine broth is sub par. I typically enjoy dipping with bread and that wasn't even enjoyable. 

We sat at the bar and the bartender seemed rushed even though it wasn't super busy. He messed up our bill, bar was sticky seemed like it had been a while since it was cleaned. I did enjoy their Carmines Pinot Grigio! Well priced.

I loved it, and the huge plate was only $34.  There were 2 of us, that ate ourselves into a food coma and we still took a good portion home.  Nowhere else in Vegas can you get that much food for $34.  Granted, my girlfriend also ordered tiramisu and forgetting it was family style, he ended up bringing the entire pie, which was $25.  That was our fault.  So we took that to go to, but she loved it.  I think by far this place is the best value taking into account the price and quality of food.

Until last night when we were very disappointed. We order the calamari , broccoli and the LOBSTER FRA DIABLO. the price on the menu was set to MP which means they can charge whatever they feel like. Too many possibilities with that but we accepted it. When the meal arrived it looked to be amazing and very promising. See pictures. But once we started to dig into it we found that for $139.95 we have very little Lobster and looked to us like the tail of the lobster was cut off and we had only been provided literally the tail end of the tail where most of the lobster meat resides. For the amount of meat we received this was very grossly misleading especially with the cost. There were no where close to enough clams and muscles. Overall I have to say this was a a HUGE disappointment to us all.

I arrived late after they ordered, which is no big deal but we didn't get our food for an hour and 15 minutes. RIDICULOUS!!!!!!!! Which, I get ticket times can get out of hand, but come up to the table and apologize at least. We asked our server for the manager, a 30ish year old black man who came to the table and didn't say sorry at all but decided to cast the blame on me because I apparently wanted all the food to come out at once. Excuse me, I wasn't even present when they ordered! And he preceded to embarrass me in front of all these men I just met. Needless to say, I was shocked but I pulled him aside to tell him how patronizing and belittling he made me feel and set him straight that I wasn't even there when they ordered so his lame excuse as to why our food took forever wasn't even accurate and was a bit pathetic to blame the only girl at the table-- sexist. 

Anyways, he told our table he would take care of some of the bill. We ate the mediocre and cold food and waited for the bill, which the host gave us. We realized nothing was taken off as previously promised. Upset, we asked for the manager again to discuss the matter and the host proceeded to call security on us. So uncalled for and rude. I will NEVER eat there again, and all of us agree that this place is utterly terrible and completely unprofessional. I hope they shut down because there are so many better places to eat in Las Vegas who actually know how to give customer service! Stay away, far away!

We started with drinks, and she definitely poured my sister's Hoegaarden poorly, but I guess it's not too big of a deal. The bread basket given contains a mini variety, but unfortunately both baskets had really cold bread. Some were topped with cheese, so it would've been nice to have had it warmed at least instead of it feeling like it came from the fridge. We ordered Carmine's salad ($22.95), mix seafood pasta (I forgot, sorry!), and chicken parmigiana ($34.95). The salad was good, and the portion was more than enough for our party of 7. I was really disappointed with our main dishes. Both the seafood and the chicken were just extremely bland and dry. We ordered our pasta with white sauce (choice of red and white), but it was just flavorless! I really expected more. Even the chicken parmigiana was tasteless.

We are so happy to say that the evening went perfectly. We worked with Jose Saenz to coordinate for approximately 105 guests who had traveled from Ohio, Michigan and several other states to Las Vegas for our wedding ceremony, and he worked very diligently to ensure every detail was perfect. We reserved the Centrale semi-private dining area, and although it was not fully private, the staff had it arranged in a way that it was not noticeable that other guests were dining in the restaurant. With such a large group in Las Vegas for our ""destination"" wedding, we first contacted Carmine's about two months before our wedding day and were able to coordinate all of the details with Jose in advance. Everything went off without a hitch!

Not only did Jose work extremely hard to make sure all of our requests were fulfilled, the staff working our dinner event was extremely courteous, patient and kind.

577921,2014-08-13,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"I am a Vegas local and brought my family here tonight to enjoy a restaurant that can cater to such a large group. 

From the beginning the service wasn't good. The two hostesses greeted us, took our names, & was informed that we had reservations (@ 7:28 pm). After giving our names she gestured for us to wait & told us our reservation wasn't till 7:30 pm & that's when we would be seated. At 7:35 after making eye contact with a member of my party she quickly stopped the ""important"" conversation she was having with her co-worker to let us know we can be seated. 

Then the server, (I am really hoping she was just having a bad day), quickly greeted us and rushed us through our drink order. That's what our whole experience was...it felt like it was a hassle for us to be served. Our table consisted of 11 people, 4 being adults and the rest all children under the age of 10. So from the beginning she already had the ""oh great"" mentality. Thankfully our children were very obedient tonight (from what the surrounding tables told us) so she didn't have to do much. But still managed to make us scared to ask for a refill! 

But what really killed it for me was being sat near the kitchen and having the doors be see-thru. A man (who I found out was Andy, the manager), reached into a plate of what looked like fried calamari, and took one which he tried to toss it into his mouth, missed, and had it drop... onto the floor!!! He then picked it up and put it back on the plate! I gasped and looked to my husband, he witnessed it as well. I brought it to the other adults attention and they looked on as he took another piece and placed it his mouth right before the server brought it out. After losing our appetites we quickly had our dishes boxed and handed over our money to quickly get out of there. And if you are wondering, yes I still did tip a minimum of 20%

When leaving I went up to the three hostesses (1 male, 2 females) asked the managers name & begin to walk away when the girl in my party called me back. I noticed the hostesses looking at me. They asked me why I asked who he was, after telling them what we saw, they responded in unison,"" okayyyyy!!!So what do you want?"" I turned and left. And that is how my horrible dinner at Carmine's was. So, if you want an over priced, very salty, lack of professionalism, possible dinner off the floor experience Carmine's the place to go.",jM-RZH9WbMcaj9rDFY885w,0,0,1,48X-Z5VprE6OiXm7y5hfTg

I've been before, and will probably go again. However, my experience on Christmas was completely terrible. I took my parents there for Christmas dinner. We of course waited for a table. While waiting, we got drinks at the bar, and had a nice time.

We were then seated at our table. It was obviously very busy so I didn't expect extremely fast service. However, after 10-15 minutes went buy without acknowledgment, we started getting a little bit irritated. Wanting to ensure a good mood for Christmas, I just played it off that they were busy. 

After 30 minutes of not being acknowledged even once, I excused myself and told someone that we had been sitting for 30 minutes without so much as a ""hello"" or water. Another five minutes passed before someone came to our table. Following that, they were extremely attentive. The manager ended up comping our drinks for the dinner, and we left somewhat satisfied. 

It's not the fact that there was a wait on Christmas, which I would totally understand. It's the fact that we were seated and no one had any idea until I told them about it 30 minutes later. That seems like an extreme lack of organizational skills.

All of that being said, the food here is consistent and delicious. If it were not for the service, I would have absolutely rated it a five. The atmosphere is classy and comfortable, the drinks are good, and the food is better.",tKgMzo1LhT7TjeGGJlBAoQ,0,0,2,Vk9bqzJmQBwxzOduy4WkJg

I was back here in May of 2016 and not because I wanted to, but because I had clients that happened to enjoy this restaurant because their children love the calamari here. 

I didn't interact too much with the hostesses because my party was already sitting down.  I can tell I was dealing with a whole new group of host and hostesses! This was already a plus since I had an issue with their attitude. And this was just by them greeting and welcoming me in the restaurant! 

I was quite impressed with our waitress; very attentive and was always checking up on us. The drinks were generous pours (I was drinking whiskey on the rocks) and my clients were having wine.  The kids loved the calamari and the food was good!  I only had one calamari tentacle and one bite of the lasagna.  I was not hungry at all that evening but I can tell from one amuse bouche size bite was sufficient enough for me to count it as an okay place to come.  The food however is heavily catered to an American palette.  

I would love to give this property five stars just for the service that I got from this specific waitress, however I use this place for catering during the holidays and I can't seem to shake off the inconsistency in miscommunication when ordering via email or phone.

It started with the excellent communication during the planning process with Sabrina who went out of her way to make our day special. She made sure that every question was answered and every little detail was taken care of. Kudos Sabrina you are an asset to Carmine's. On the day of our event we arrived and were immediately introduced to our head waiter, server and comedian extraordinaire. First he started in the most professional manner making sure that all our guests were taken care of and as the afternoon unfolded and he became more comfortable with us he was a total joy to be around. He laughed with us, danced with us and sang with us as the celebration was a total success. By the time we left Michael was a friend and not our waiter. Michael we are deeply grateful and honored to have had you work with us. Carmine's is the place to enjoy a celebration in Las Vegas and you will not be disappointed with anything they do. You can turn your special day over to them and from that point forward your party is one thing you will not have to worry about. They are all about service with a smile at a reasonable price. 
And the food is incredibly delicious. If any of your guests walk away hungry it's not because of your decision to call Carmine's Las Vegas.

Upon being passed off to Edward things seemed to be light and fun, however his inappropriate comments and actions progressed from somewhat uncomfortable and bizarre to outright vulgar and insulting by the end of the evening, to a point where my wife was in tears both later on in the evening and still this morning. His comments ranged from talking about his ""mediterranean penis size"" to personal attacks on two of my friends hair lines, to basically giving another friends wife a lap dance in the middle of the restaurant, each time guised in jest yet very contemptuous. I can not even begin to convey my infuriation at this manner and still, after an evening of ""cooling off,"" only find this situation to be more unacceptable.

962574,2013-08-01,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"How's the food?  Couldn't tell you because it never came out of the kitchen.  We stopped here in July to get some appetizers.  We came in after 9:00 PM and the place was not busy.  After being seated, our waiter pretty much forgot about us because it was about 30 minutes before someone else came by to take our drink orders.  We ordered our food at the same time and, just as we were ordering, our original waiter came back to the table to take over.  We told both waiters that we wanted the portabello mushroom appetizer (they have two mushroom appetizers, the other is stuffed caps).  They both went away and the original waiter came back again to confirm which mushroom appetizer we wanted.  We repeated - portabella.  30 minutes later (we've been here an hour now), out comes someone else with mushroom caps - not what we ordered.  We told him those weren't right and he didn't seem to understand what we were saying.  We called our server over and he saw what was wrong, apologized and took away the food to get the order right.  We're now starving and eating the all the bread at the table - which is grocery store quality by the way.  Spongy and not crusty at all.  After waiting another 30 minutes (now 90 minutes waiting FOR AN APPETIZER), and several visits from our waiter who kept making us feel uncomfortable by being over apologetic, we decided to talk with the manager.  She was nice enough, apologized for the inconvenience and said that we didn't have to pay for anything - so we left.  Over an hour an a half there, no real food (other than bad bread) and bad service.  Our first trip there was our last.  Hope your experience is better.  

Oh by the way, if you like GOOD Italian food, this is not the place for you.  You can tell by the bread when a place is good or not (it's not good here) and we could see what others were getting.  This place looks like mid-west American style Italian food.  On par with Olive Garden.  Good luck!",xDcIcr8X6QsZ-QwrLFBC-Q,1,0,1,FqWIAET4Rr6RUXb73d-TSQ

The ambiance is that of 1950s Little Italy with a mix of big band and crooner music always keeping the mood chill. The wait staff is attentive and professional, while keeping the environment relaxed and delightful. 

The manager Terry and bartenders Natalie, Anthony, Peter, Michael, and Andrew are always on top of keeping our visits special. The happy hour deals are out of this world.

The big boost in my great experience was the outstanding guest service we had. Not only from bartender/waiter that served us, but also from the operations manager that checked on us throughout and incited fun conversation.

 Then when throw on the best music played anywhere with lots of Sinatra, Dean Martin, Frankie Valli, Keely Smith and an occasional Motown hit. I love the DJ.

I also love the wide array of photos on the wall. I wish there was a directory. But I did recognize many of them.

983053,2014-04-01,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Just had our wedding reception at Carmine's Las Vegas. We picked Carmine's because it was the only affordable choice for 80 guests and could accommodate dancing. From the start, their event coordinator (Tara)can't be beat. Friendly, efficient and detail oriented.. Complete full service and accommodated my various arrangements that I made. (The entire reception was easily planned long distance solely through email communication..my preference.) The reception was perfect! The facility is welcoming and classy. And comfortably accommodated 80 guests, showgirls, Elvis and DJ with dancing. The servers and staff could not be beat.. I'm pretty sure none of my guests were ever left with an empty glass and the chef even prepared a special meal for my brother who has a garlic allergy. And the food.. well, true to the reputation of Carmine's was over-the-top abundant. The amount of food has become a funny highlight from all my guests. All this at an affordable price. I could not be happier that I chose Carmine's for my wedding reception. In fairness, I don't like weddings .. particularly the kind in a banquet hall with ""lovely"" flowers, small piece of chicken for dinner and bouquet tosses etc..(boring to me) so gauge my review accordingly.

1- Italian food. The prime rib was delicious.the italian sausage was great. The onions were sweet. The pasta was a bit salty.

2. The cheese cake was delicious.

Now for the things I wasn't inpressed with. Keep in mind we were a party of 16.

1. We had 2 people more than we had reserved for when we arrived. They bumped us back 40 minutes. 

- A friend and I sat at the bar and, although it wasn't busy, it took 15 minutes befor a bartender even said Hi.

3. He wasn't polite at all. Had a negative attitude actually. 

4. We get our table and we get two menus. 2 menus total for 16 people. Yeah.

5. We get an explanation that the check cant be split at all 

6. Our chairs had food on them. They weren't cleaned.

7. We ate family style. They brought the food out on one plate. On a long rectangular table, separating the food and putting them on two 
plates on each side would have been nice.

8. I didnt like the interior. They had Random chandeliers and giant menus on the walls yet they were trying to be high end?


Honestly, i think this place is overrated. I'm not motivated to go back. The food wasn't any better than most decent Italian places and a bit over priced.",aeCyTRbXdrqGPPCduVLGVA,1,1,3,0pNMtHDMBphhvZNDHmU9cg

The food is served family style and therefore the portions are huge and great for sharing or for having the next day for lunch. It's pricey, but what isn't in Vegas for a good meal? For instance, if you would like a salad or a vegetable to accompany your meal, the Caesar salad (which is enough for 5 or 6 people) costs $29 and some steamed broccoli, served in a huge bowl is $17, again, enough for multiple people to share. 
My biggest problem with our dinner last night was the service. DAVID was our server and although he was polite, he was not enthusiastic and didn't want to spend one extra minute at our table helping to answer our questions. Maybe he was having a bad night, but when you're out in Vegas and are about to spend $150 for 2 people to eat dinner, you'd like to think your waiter would be personable and seem happy you are there.

1079067,2013-11-03,2,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"There were just too many things about my dinner that I didn't like - from subpar food to surly service.  
The style of Carmine's itself may appeal to some people, perhaps large families, but for me much of it seemed contrived by some ""idea man"" that wants a gimmick and sets that as a higher priority than anything else.
To start,. three of us were seated and given two menus.  When I asked for another my server explained (with a little too much exasperation, as though this happens too many times) that the restaurant is family style and there are menus on the wall, so they only give every other person a menu.  When I just smiled, she gave me a menu.  Thank you.
The menu didn't have descriptions below the items.  I love Italian food and can be equally happy with authentic Italian or with Americanized Italian food.  But some of the dishes, like Chicken Scarpariello, I am not familiar with.  If you purposely print a menu designed to make your customers ask for details, then employ servers that are friendly and willing to describe things.  
Family style dining isn't a bad idea, but what happens when the salads are $23 and only 2 of the 3 people are in the mood for salad?  Well, my friend, you are out of luck.  The salad is easily large enough to serve 7 people and is piled so high on the plate that when the food runner plates it up for you several pieces fall all over the table.  You could splurge and just order far more than you could eat, or somebody gets shorted.
Main courses were also easily able to feed 6 people or so.  We tried the pasta special of 4 pastas on a platter.  They were all very mediocre.  In fact nothing stood out as being even marginally better than something I could buy frozen at Trader Joe's and reheat in my microwave.  
We shared a bottle of wine and here the server actually anticipated a problem that probably occurs often.  Apparently their wine glasses are the same as their water glasses - a very small juice glass.  She warned us of this as soon as we ordered and offered to bring stemware. Yes, please.  The wine was nice, but BIG PET PEEVE: Some wines need decanting.  If you are too casual of a restaurant to do this, fine.  Just don't sell wines that need decanting!!  Do you know how unpleasant it is to be caught up in conversation only to take a final sip of wine and fill your mouth with sediment???? UGH!
And, since I am on a roll...why use water glasses that are so tiny?  Whoever made that decision should have realized that directly corresponds to needing more staff available to refill.  Nope, in reality it means sitting without water for a good part of the meal.  Hello, it's a desert out there!
Dessert choices were confusing.  Again, no descriptions on the menu and now no prices.  This I really do not like.  Why wouldn't you have prices??  Oh, someone's brilliant idea of forcing our surly server to have to explain.  Well, this one you can order 2 or 4, but this one is only one size and big enough for 6 and this one is sold individually....Seriously?  Why make it so confusing?

Even with all of that disappointment, I would have considered at least one more star if there was even anything in our copious leftovers that I would have bothered taking home to reheat.  Nope, it was all blah.  Even the bread was ick.  Big Italian sin in my book.",7HOTOydGS7wJYaJqNoDfeg,7,2,1,2b9E4XXnP-JxwTxIP-eUAA

I immediately let our server know and it then took an additional 20 minutes to get the other drink after we had already 30 minutes and for them to not bring enough is unacceptable.  These drinks were to have been for our dinner toast which they now ruined because by the time the last drink was brought over everyone was done eating.  When I complained to both the sever and a manager they told me they would see what they could do but the delay was because they only had 1 bartender.....the manager sent over green shots for our table and proceeded to charge me full price for our 10 cocktails at $14 per drink.  At $140 bucks our drinks should have all come out at the same time and not taken 40 minutes---epic fail and total buzz kill will not return.,p7jqrXhY3bB4hn9Fmll2zQ,0,0,1,gdlQAzNIX51ziGCf2HPlnA

Being family style, the salads and entrées can easily serve five. For a table of six we ordered eggplant parmigiana, linguine bolognese and the Carmine salad. And there was more than enough food to go around...and leftovers to boot.

The bolognese sauce was excellent...but don't expect the typical tomato style. This bolognese sauce was meat, oil and herb based...and absolutely delicious. The eggplant was a many-layered affair of cheese, eggplant and marinara sauce that was devoured with abandon. And the salad had an excellent array of tastes and textures.

The bread basket is filled with a variety of breads, from focaccias to breadsticks, and they generously gave us three baskets in total.

1274964,2014-10-25,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Event planning sucks. Earlier this year I had the brilliant idea to bring my sales team to Vegas as part training, part reward trip for the awesome job they've been doing. Little did I realize the number of things that could go wrong when planning a small event. 

Most frustrating is that we lost our meeting venue at our hotel.  At the last minute, the hotel event staff sent us a laundry list of restrictions, including no outside food or drinks.   Nothing says ""great job team"" like shoving them in a windowless room for 10 hours with no food and water.  

I frantically turned to any local source I could find, and a friend on Facebook recommended Carmine's. I'm not going to lie, we were a little dubious; images of us sitting in a room with whiteboards surrounded by noisy eaters and screaming children came to mind.  Fortunately that was the furthest from the truth. 

The atmosphere was perfect. They put us in a quiet room in the back.  Music, air temperature, and lighting were under our complete control.  We used the 40"" ++ flat screen monitor for presentations, and the staff was attentive but not intrusive.  

The food was incredible. We ordered a constant stream of appetizers, entrees, and desserts throughout the day.  Some were better than others (as you'd expect) but on the whole we were happily surprised and unanimously agreed that the food was delicious.  Note to self: the garlic bread was amazing, and the Titantic is quite unstable if you eat the bottom crust first. 

In short, they made our event easy, literally attended to our every need, and the food and atmosphere made for a very productive day.  And they saved my bacon by accommodating my last minute request for a meeting space ... or more appropriately my ""prosciutto"".  ; )",A63h_7zL1phcQvrRuwEpvw,3,1,5,w9fBqVmCZww_sgMk6sFG8w

We ate there on Wednesday before thanksgiving as a family meal. My wife, ex-wife and daughter and my son and his wife. We enjoyed an antipasti prepared for us by the chef and sent out with the complements of the restaurant. So, what happened. The general manager and I spoke after my last review and we agreed that I should try one more time. I let Anthony know when I was coming and that I was bringing the family. We had an enjoyable table out in the mall, the patio area and the noise level was MUCH reduced and we could all hear each other with no trouble. Which for a guy who is starting to loose a little in the hearing area, was great. We enjoyed a Caesar salad and ordered the stuffed mushrooms. Neither of which disappointed a single guest. We then ordered the chicken parmesan and the cheese ravioli. There was food for all and it was all great. If I had any complaint, which I do not, it was I kind of expected a side of pasta with the chicken parmesan, but trust me it was not needed. There was plenty and I do not think anyone missed it at all. 

Everything went as expected and we are and were impressed with the service and the food. It just goes to show you that every one can have a bad day. Strike my first review and go with this one.",0_A8aFFKA8sgh11wDi4XBw,0,0,4,X67l4J2bLcJD8aBSbckqig

They brought out a bread basket with a variety of breads as well. Being that I'm currently pregnant I ordered a non-alcoholic cocktail, Pineapple Mule. It was probably the best non-alcoholic drink I have ever had!!! It had fresh pineapple muddled in the drink! I will likely be back just for that!

Waitress told us all food is made to order, isn't it usually?  Couldn't just order the caponata, though, would have to get other cold antipasto items I don't eat. So much for ""made to order"". Couldn't get baked clams either since they have cheese in them (premade?) and am allergic to cheese. 

Clams were ok; got more onion focaccia for dunking in broth.  Shrimp were ok. Maybe 15 average size shrimp. Not rubbery. Brought out wrong pasta dish, had clams instead of calamari. Replaced it in reasonable time.  

Food wasn't as bad as it could have been, just wasn't special. Took too much effort to find dishes that three people wanted to share, rather than a lot of dishes which we could all taste.  Also, restaurant needs to have smaller tables.  We were originally shown to a table for six (!), but convinced hostess that a booth for 2 (?) would be more comfortable and conducive to conversation.

Everything is large portions; pasta can be bought in supermarket for $.99/lb.  Only thing that is not large portion is glass of wine.  Not served in a wine glass, but in a small drinking glass.

Family style like this was trendy in late 1980's.  Now people would like a small taste of a lot of dishes rather than find a few upon which everyone agrees.

1479142,2016-11-20,1,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"First let me start by saying there's so much more that goes into a yelp rating besides the food. The food at Carmine's is okay...not the best Italian but it's a decent option inside the Forum Shops. 

Now, the reason I gave them 1 star is for service in the restaurant and management's lack of caring about their guest's experience. I'm more willing to understand so so service if the restaurant is packed and you can tell the waiter/waitress is working their butt off. However, this was not the case. 

I had lunch here during the week and there were only about 5 tables occupied in the whole restaurant. (This place is huge!!) I was surprised by how slow the waitress was to check on us and even get refills. Now my biggest complaint was when I asked how long their strawberry shortcake would take to make (since I was on a lunch break) and she said 5-7 minutes. Okay, 7 minutes...that's fine. It actually took 20 minutes and the waitress was no where to be found in the meantime. When she finally came around, I asked for it in two boxes to go...so my friend and I could take it with us for later. We waited another 10 minutes and had to speak with a manager. Besides being late, the worst part....later on when I went to enjoy my dessert, I was shocked to find that my box contained whipped cream and strawberries, and later found out my friend's box had the shortcake. Hmm. I asked the waitress for two boxes so we could each take one home...and this is what we were given. :( 

Obviously, I was upset so I called in to speak with a manager, I was told to leave a message and no one ever got back to me.",UL5K2rnSYIPD1LcqPgbmDQ,0,1,1,Zzm2z4iP7SDvy6W5V3NYxA

It looks expensive, but when each plate serves 4-5 people it actually breaks down to be pretty cheap. The smell while walking around the forum shops drew us in. Only thing I don't like is that they wouldn't let us add chicken to our Caesar salad. Waitress told us we would have to order a separate chicken dish, which doesn't make sense. Although you can add chicken to Caesar salads if you sit in the bar area where portions feed 2-3.

The overall quality of the food was poor other than the free bread that they give you 

We asked for light cheese on the chicken Parmesan and it was still doused in heavy cheese. The sauce was light and left the linguine dry underneath. 

The Caesars salad had delicious fresh croutons but at $30 I would  expect exceptional parmesan but it was really low quality cheese.  The dressing was very heavy in garlic and anchovies. We specifically asked if it was fishy and we were assured it was not. But it was too fishy for my taste and I couldn't eat it 

The chocolate torte for desert was good. 

The food is sold family style. The cost per person is higher than Cheesecake Factory down the mall which in my opinion has much better food. 

Take out service was ok. We had questions about ingredients that the guy couldn't answer.

Martin was our server and he is a delight with fantastic knowledge of food and wine. His recommendations proved success. 

We indulged in a bottle of Barolo and then a featured Piemonte. $78, $52 respectively which yes is pricey for those and you can't easily get these plus it's a big name establishment AND you're on the strip so for me elevated price is expected. 

We ordered 2 dishes for 4 of us and no appetizer for fear of being too full seeing how large the portions were. I have to say the prices alone for the food are very reasonable because of the quantity. The lemon veal was delicious as long as you enjoy pounded floured veal. I loved it! We also got the mixed seafood penne with white (oil and garlic) as opposed to marinara sauce. There was a mix of clams mussels  calamari shrimp and lobster tossed in oil garlic and penne pasta. It was fresh flavorful and generous. The only challenge was not having small lobster forks to help with cracking the shells. Once we asked a couple waiters they finally found one for us but not before my husbands shirt was already splattered in oil from trying to use his hands. 

We indulged in tiramisu because it was too pretty to pass up seeing it on the table next door and of course because it's tiramisu.

The bar area is nice, sit there for a cocktail before your meal or dine at one of the few high tops for minimal wait times.

Favorite dishes include the meatballs- huge and delicious mix of beef and veal, these are a must order! The seafood salad is also solid, decoratively served with fresh baby endive and plenty of octopus. Anything with fresh mozzarella is always a win, too. The main pasta dishes feature your choice of pasta and sauce- the penne and red sauce was fine, neither the sauce nor pasta really wowed me but they were cooked perfectly al dente, pasta is fresh made in house daily. I wish they had a mushroom pappardelle option. 

I did not care for the tiramisu dessert (minimal lady fingers, mostly mascarpone) or the  cold eggplant salad dish we received. I would come back for the eggplant parmigiana, shrimp scampi, and chicken scarpariello dishes.

It was explained to us one part of the menu was based on the dishes being able to serve 4 people, the other merely two.We ordered appetizers , they were huge! We had a big plate of calamari, which we enjoyed.We also had a Cesar salad with chicken , anchovies on the side .I was so hungry I ate the anchovies.The salad didn't have little  strips of chicken - it had whole chicken breasts- it was kind of insane.I ate them!The most insane thing I saw was the guy next to me didn't understand the bit about the menu with the dishes for 4.He was from Belgium and probably didn't quite get it .When his dish came out he looked astonished and I could not keep from laughing.It was HUGE !It would have allowed the entire village to feast.He ate about one fifth of it.Every time I looked , I laughed( I wasn't being mean - it just looked funny).I'm sure he's firmly convinced Americans eat too much.

Carmines seems profoundly influenced by old Ronzoni, Chef Boyardi , Spatini Spaghetti Sauce and Francesco Rinaldi commercials.You can picture Anthony running home for Princes spaghetti on Bostons North End  and people saying stuff like Mangia and Abbodonza.It's actually funny , fun and good natured.Here everyone gets to be a paisan.",YOIorhfo8hHhilRyam2c4w,2,3,3,T_LRgA59sjn3gHQ7s4TMgA

The green salad was excellent beyond belief, huge easily enough for 6 hungry people.  The server did warn us that everything was ""family style"". Next came out chicken parm. on Turkey sized platter with about a pound of spaghetti under the chicken.  The chicken was pounded too thin, it was breaded but a bit too heavily, it was very dry.  Thin layer of cheese on top. Now my real complaint was ""hey guys did you run out of sauce""? I have never seen such a meager portion of marinara on this dish not to mention the pound of pasta beneath.  It would easily serve 8 people.  This is so much waste, especially in Las Vegas where most of us can't take it home...I wouldn't have taken this home anyway.

Very disappointing to see all that food thrown away.  There were 3 of us and we honestly just ordered salad and an entree.  Also, be more generous with your sauce or offer more on the side.  The menu's are on the wall. If your back is to one or you can't read the others your waiter is ""there for you"".  I wasn't happy with this as they don't have time to stand there and read you the entire large menu.  Its difficult for people without the eyesight of an eagle. Many people had to get up and go stand in front of one of the menus to read it.  I think having printed menus would be very kind as an alternative.",XyWS_swdy-_kuApR3BSfsw,0,0,3,M6gtzwgEkhcxApmzLrMupw

1844939,2016-01-02,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"My family decided to dine at Carmine's this past Tuesday evening for our last meal while in Las Vegas. There was no wait, and we were placed at a table in the very back of the restaurant. The restaurant itself looks like Buca Di Beppo, and has an extremely similar ambiance. The hostess sat us down, said nothing, and walked away. About ten minutes later, a waiter was serving the table next to us and we asked if he could grab our waiter because we had not yet been seen. Our waitress arrived, did not introduce herself, and quickly asked what drinks we would like. When we did not order alcoholic beverages, she was clearly disappointed. About ten minutes later, she came with only one pitcher of water for a table of fifteen people. We asked her several questions about the menu, and she did not seem to know the answers to any of them. In fact, we were never handed menus, but were expected to crane our necks backwards to look at the large, light-up menu that was directly behind us. She first brought out our salad, and some ice-cold bread. Soon after, she brought our food, and because the restaurant serves family style, we were all leaning over each other trying to gain access to the dishes. 

About fifteen minutes after finishing the small portion of pasta and breaded chicken I ate, I began to feel a stomach ache coming on. We left the restaurant around 9 p.m, and I was back in my hotel room by 9:30. I packed up my suitcases and went into bed, but then I started to feel terrible pain in my stomach. I THREW UP ALL NIGHT. I have continued to have terrible stomach pains through Friday evening and went to Urgent Care, where the doctor confirmed that I had FOOD POISONING!!

There are many great restaurants on the strip, but Carmine's is NOT one of them. Treat yourself right and go anywhere but there. The food quality was poor, the service was bad, and the atmosphere was busy.",XCvtthJqf2LbN2asy_rbHA,0,0,1,OnPxBBMB6aA8Q96dP3X7Ww

1855413,2015-06-22,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Tale of two experiences.

My wife and I came here twice on the same trip because we liked it so much the first time.  The first visit was phenomenal.  We ordered half a caesar salad and half a ravioli entree.  The caesar salad was fresh, crisp lettuce, great flavor, just outstanding.  The raviolis were hot, oozing cheese out as you cut into them, and simply amazing.  The service was top notch.  

The second time we came we were told as we were sitting at our table that we were not allowed to order half meals unless we accepted eating at a high top in the bar area.  I was ready to walk out at such an asinine request being that it is the same restaurant here or in the bar and we just ordered half meals the day before.  My wife was also pregnant so sitting at a high top bar was going to be uncomfortable for her.  As I was ready to leave my wife suggested we stay as she was having hunger pangs and needed to eat soon so I agreed.

We ordered the exact same thing from before after we complied to move seats or eat elsewhere.  This time the salad was soggy and not fresh.  Anyone who has made a caesar salad knows you must serve it as soon as you put dressing on it or it will go wilty.  The raviolis also tasted not fresh.  They weren't hot and the cheese wasn't oozing out of them.  They tasted reheated and stale.

It really felt as if the food we had the day before was now being served to us again today.  

I'm not sure what to think of this place now.  I went from writing a five star review to a 1 star.  I am averaging it at 3 but I don't think i'd even roll the dice to come back for a tie breaker.  Very disappointing food and policy.  

The rule that you can't order half meals basically means you can not come here as a couple but as a minimum of 4.  I'm not sure if the owner is purposely shunning couples or accidentally shunning them but the amount of food served is just way too much for 2 people to share unless you order a half.

After thinking of this policy, now even the menu being on the wall also seems like a pretty dumb idea.  Why do I have to stand above other diners to read a menu on a wall when you could just put the darn thing on my table for me to read like a normal person?

If you are looking to feed lots of people with awesome family style food here it is. It is located in Caesars Palace's forum shop not too far from the valet which makes it quit convenient. The Resturant is just as big as the plate sizes. Nothing is small here. 

Service was great. We had at least 4 servers with one gal being the main one. Just like any Italian dinner with a hundred coarse they were always changing our new plates for us in between each dish. 

The Breezy Italian is a pretty good drink could be a little stronger though. With that said it not only looks good but it taste good. The app stuff mushrooms was good but for some reason mushy.....don't know what it was but I would've gone for something else. The garlic cheese bread was insanely huge and delicious with tons of melted cheese on top and buttery garlic toasted bread. The seafood pasta was awesome good red sauce with all kinds of seafood plus a whole lobster. Some items might have been slight chewy but non the less great. The Lemon Chicken dish was thin and tender, lemony and yummy smothered in a cream sauce and would go perfect with some linguini. The spaghetti and meat ball with big balls was very good as well.

The seafood consisted of clams in the shell, mussels, lobster, and calamari rings.  There was a choice of white or red sauce for the pasta.  We got the white which turned out to be a very light and taste wine, garlic, herb sauce which was wonderful and made good use of the basket of bread we had on the table.

Located kind of around the fountain at Ceaser's Palace, this place is hard to miss. It's surrounded by an air of sophistication & a sort of simpler elegance. 

I entered Carmine's due to a wedding (the reception celebratory dinner was held here). Upon entering I was engulfed immediately with the atmosphere. It has an aroma that embraces the era where men retired to the den with a glass of scotch and a cigar. I loved the amount of wood and the fact that the menu was plastered every wall. You'll pretty much choose what you eat before you even sit down. 

We got sat in the back room and had a pre-fixed menu. The table was pre set with a sampler bread basket and waters in front of us. The assortment of bread was odd and many of the flavors left a sour taste in my mouth. Oh well, you can't complain about complimentary bread. 

To start, we were given an enormous platter of calamari and ceaser. The abundance of the two starters alone was overwhelming. If you come, I recommend sharing a plate rather than order one for oneself. Trust me. Unless you're a competitive eater, or just have an insatiable appetite, you won't finish. 

The calamari batter was was overly salty and I found myself drinking more to quench my thirst. 
The ceaser salad, it was probably the best part of the meal, sadly. However, it still was too much for me. It was overly dressed and the dressing had an odd taste to it.

The gluten free vodka pasta made me feel so horribly for everyone that has a gluten allergy. The sauce lacked all flavor and the pasta itself? Odd. Just odd.
The shrimp with wine sauce was horrendously oily and ended up making me feel so nauseas I couldn't even try the other dishes. To much of my dismay, the dishes that followed looked more appetizing and were raved about. Ugh. Such a shame.

Overall? I loved the atmosphere and the service was on par to what I expect Vegas service to be. However, the food left much to be desired. I would've much rather liked to go to the Cheesecake Factory that was nearby.",itX318afV6JIwh-MQmW8kw,1,0,2,GdQFoQYaNEhD-NkLgJJQXw

1) Enormous portions
2) Old-world Italian/NYC decor
3) High prices

Now, this doesn't mean that it was a bad experience. To the contrary, it was pretty good.. A-OK, if you will. My mom and I visited Carmine's for our pre-marathon carb-loading meal. We walked right in at about 4:30 without a reservation. We were seated at a small table, with little room between us and diners on either side of us. Even the waiters had a hard time getting between them. Now, this could be seen as a positive thing, because we got to know our fellow patrons over the course of our meal, but if we'd had something private to discuss... well...

Anyway, onto the food! The food was served ""family style"" in a large party platter. One entree is easily enough for 2-4 people, depending on the size of their appetites. We ordered the shrimp with angel hair pasta ($37), with the ""white"" sauce. Be forewarned, the white sauce is not a cream based sauce, it is an oil/wine/garlic sauce (and they don't skimp on the garlic). There were a decent amount of shrimp in it. The taste...just okay. Nothing extra special. In all honesty, I think I prefer Maggianos as far as flavor goes. Nothing to complain about, however.

The waiter was obviously disappointed that he couldn't up-sell us on drinks or dessert, but he was pleasant overall. If you happen to be in the Forum Shops and a group of you are super hungry, sure stop by..

The team wanted team dinner before the tournament started for team bounding but also just so the kids all be together. My nephew mom was in charge of finding the restaurant. She decided Carmine would be great spot! It very similar to Buca De Beppa the whole family style concept and really perfect for bunch of kids. It was my first time dining at Carmine's. Truth be told not much difference between the two from the concept or the food. I think both are very good italian food. They do your basics well from chicken parmesan, spaghetti with meatballs, caesar salad, and on on. On this night had preset menu started with caesar salad that was good. Nothing that blew me away but solid refreshing salad start. The spaghetti and meatballs good. The meatballs were decent size not over the top size but nice juicy, cooked on point, and tasty. The tomato sauce could have sue more flavor in my opinion. Still overall good pasta course. The chicken parmesan was good. It have nice crust on the outside . The tomato sauce brought it all together. The dessert if there was anything food stood was the dessert course. It was modified strawberry shortcake. Instead of pound cake they used more banana bread. The fresh strawberry not skimpy about and the sauce brought it all together. Talk about finishing meal on high note.

SHOUT OUT that well deserve Catherine not sure if she in charge of parties or her role in the restaurant. She was the main person dealt with setting up BIG party as in over 40people. Number that was constantly changing at the last minute adding more since some families not sure if make flight in on time or what not. Each time called the restaurant it was never big deal and she was more happy change it. Not sure if it was timing but they opened up back (talk about deceiving but keep walking back back back separate dining area for parties) area since we had over 40people. It was awesome for the kids that they had extra space. It not as loud so everyone could talk stories and just relax enjoy before the tournament.

we've been here before months ago on a sunday right before a volleyball tourney to carb up. the sunday platter special is ON POINT. the portions are huge. you're likely going to take some home.  the gnocchi was so good and so was the lasagna.

recently, we came and asked our server if gnocchi was available, and he said he would check with the kitchen, and also offered a creamy sauce with it similar to carbonara.  so we said yes, and also ordered a lasagna. 

the bussers dropped off cabornara pasta, which all of us remembers never ordering, and we looked at eachother thinking this is not gnocchi. so there goes one seeminlgy petty but disappointing as a simple request where our server did not follow up with us on the gnocchi. if we wanted carbornara, we would've ordered it. 
 
the lasagna, however, was so salty, we could'n't enjoy it. it overpowered the cheese. so when our server FRANK, returned to ask us how everything was, i mentioned genuinly how salty the lasagna was, and with no sympathy, he resonded with, ""we don't add salt."" well, i've made lasagna before, and obviously most people know the saltiness comes from the sausage/meat and not added salt. but if he was a good listener, he would have picked up that it was more ""salty"" than usual in terms of my palette.  then my dad tried to make light of the situation and made a joke saying, ""maybe the salt was on sale"" and the server just had no sense of humor. it was awful. and so was the lasagna. this is a place we thought we would enjoy, but definately a true disappointment. there are other italian hot spots for less and just as enjoyable with respectable servers.",DASkWfrV6kWHE_4xC7BkYQ,2,2,1,911LgROIL-D-nMNW8D1D6w

Located in the Forum Shops at Caesars, Carmine's is an absolute delight.  The restaurant itself is large and can easily accommodate a group of any size.  Don't expect your server to bring you a menu as their menus are posted up on the wall all around the dining room.  There you will also find what the current daily special is.  

Your server will bring out a basket of bread and, while you may be tempted to snack on it while waiting for your meal, do so at your own risk!  As I stated above, they offer ""family portions"" (ie: large portions) and that is a gross understatement.  We are talking pounds and pounds of pasta and food.  Yum.  We got three plates to split between the five of us and suffice it to say, we had plenty to take home.  The ravioli was incredible, I mean, it was easily our favorite thing we ordered, so do yourself a favor and get it.  You're welcome.  

Our server was fast and tentative and even asked if we were sure we wanted to order three items (we told him we live dangerously).  They also take reservations so feel free to add this to your planning itinerary.  Carmine's acted as a last supper of sorts our last trip to Las Vegas, and I must say, it was a perfect ending to a perfect week.",vyCzfPd-pmce5nNwykyKOw,2,0,4,wjK-W4POhCeLFBBahrJ0_Q

The restaurant is in the ""mall"" at Cesar's and it is actually pretty large restaurant! They have a full bar and the drinks are yummy! Very heavy handed bartenders!!!!  the menus are on the walls which is a little different but easy to see from where we sitting. I went with a party of 12 and I made the reservations through yelp which was super easy and awesome!!! When we checked in the table was ready and were seated within 2 minutes of arrival!! The hosts greeted us promptly and checked to make sure our table was set then we were off! The food is served family style so very large portions and if you add pasta to a main dish like the chicken Parmesan it's an extra 12 something but it will feed about 3.5/4 people!! See my pictures we added the angel hair pasta to our chicken Marsala and we did not finish it! We also ordered the stuffed salmon which was the best salmon I have ever had!!!!!! It was pretty pricey but well worth it! Chicken Parmesan was super cheesy and cooked so well! The lasagna was really meaty and had an excellent amount of cheese! Another item I was impressed with was the shrimp scampi!!! The pictures do not do it justice!! The shrimps are almost the size of prawns. I did add a little lemon to the pasta (which we also added on the angel hair pasta) We also has one dish I was not super impressed with but I did not order it and would never have ordered it was a broccoli and pasta dish with a white wine sauce it was pretty bland and nothing too great about it.

2421042,2013-11-22,1,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Just as good as the New York location, but not *nearly* as crowded! 

We made reservations for three for an early Friday night dinner, but I don't think the reservations were necessary. The restaurant got busy, but it definitely never got as busy as the restaurant in Times Square.

The staff was all friendly, and took the time to joke around with us. Our waiter recommended some drinks, and then gave us time to decide on our order.

I've been dreaming about Carmine's Bolognese since we had it in March, so of course that was the sauce that I wanted. We agreed on a pasta type and an appetizer (the calamari) and then stared at the bread basket that they placed on the table in front of us.

We'd all been to Carmine's New York location before, so we knew from experience that there'd be a ton of food coming our way, and were weighing the pros and cons of eating the bread ahead of our meal. We nibbled at the bread, but decided to save our appetites for the food.

And, oh! That food! That glorious, delicious, exceedingly large portion of food!

The calamari came out first, and initially, we thought we'd have no problem polishing it off. There were three of us, after all, and we were all pretty hungry. The calamari was delicious - crispy and piping hot, there was good flavor in both the batter and in the squid meat. I didn't try the marinara sauce, but the others seemed to love it. I preferred throwing a dusting of parmesan cheese on top, which made it even better.

As we were putting a dent into the platter of calamari, our waiter came by with our platter of Angel Hair pasta with Bolognese sauce. He then started to dish it all out for us, and for some reason, I ended up with the largest serving. 

Maybe because I clapped and bounced up and down in my seat when he set it down on the table?

The sauce was just as good as I remembered it being, which was a huge relief. I tend to have very bad luck with things that I've experienced once, and end up craving. They never quite add up, you know? But, that wasn't the case here. The sauce was meaty and mildly spicy, without being too tomato-y. Is that a word? Tomato-y? It is now.

It wasn't long before we realized, not only had we failed in clearing out the calamari, there was a not-so-small portion of pasta left over. As we were all in hotel rooms without microwaves, we weren't sure we wanted to take the leftovers with us, but then decided to see if we could find someone...in need...to give it to.

I'm so glad that we found out about this location before our trip to Vegas. It was the perfect pre-race meal, and we loved everything from the service to the quality of the food. 

Once again, we left overly full and impressed by Carmine's!",-ZqPTpx9TyyvdAWbajdilA,5,2,5,_h16759eCNt7ADe_L51eQw

So we only sat down here because of the happy hour sign and we wanted some food.  But guess what...happy hour does not apply to those of us who are seated at a table and will be eating. Huh? Say again? Yet you let us bring our 32 OZ yard cups full of booze from outside and we are sitting here drinking those...but I can't participate in YOUR happy hour?

The waiter...Mr. Personality 2015! NOT. I could have had better service from a log. Quicker too.

We ordered the big multi-appetizer thing.  It had some fried raviolis, some muscles, some sausage, some gross cheese thing that was sweet. Not impressed. Especially for the price.

Again back to the waiter. The guy was horrible. That on top of the happy hour ordeal and the food - Carmine's will only get the mandatory 1 star from me. I do not give out 1 stars lightly, this is maybe my 2nd or 3rd?  That pretty much tells you our experience at this place.  Wish we hadn't have wasted the time during our 4 day stay in Vegas.

My boyfriend and I went here on a random trip to the Forum Shops due to the closing of one of my favorite stores. I have been lucky enough to dine at the Carmine's in NYC, so I had high expectations. 
First off, the dishes are huge, and if you are not familiar with Italian food, get ready to do some smart phone googling. There is no explanation of the food on the menu, which is also plastered all over the wall. Classic, homestyle, dishes served in portions enough for 3-4 people. We decided on the chicken scallopini, spaghetti and meatballs, and roasted peppers and mozzarella. We easily had enough food for, four, hungry people. The meatballs were melt in your mouth good, and gave grandma a run for her money. The chicken was beaten super thin and had the most succulent lemon glaze. I would honestly pass on the cheese and peppers again. The mozzarella was indeed fresh, but the peppers needed more. They were just cold and bland. Next time, I will go for the zucchini, I kept drooling watching it be served to others. 
The only downfall was the service. Little things like not telling us the refills on the lemonade aren't free, or keeping the water full. The lady who was our server was clearly still in training, but I won't lie, I don't think shell make the cut. 
She seemed confused on why two people ordered 3 dishes. I hate when people question how much we order. It happens too often, maybe we just eat too much. 

On that note, I will give this place another shot, when I have about 4-6 others with me. Any takers?",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,8,4,4,eTI5GTY3a_rzRuHuj4mu1g

I tried to give the benefit of the doubt that they may be short staffed or something, but we observed many wait staff standing around not looking overly busy. It's a shame. We were really hoping this would be a great spot to treat our wedding guests to a memorable Italian meal.  At the end of the meal our server asked us how everything was when she brought the check.

The menu is on the wall and easy to read, posted multiple times as well. All you need is to order a couple of dishes and everyone will be overly full. 

We got the angel hair pasta with marinara, house salad, chicken marsala, and carbonara. It was all fantastic and way more than our group of 7 could eat! The house salad is basic with red onions, black and green olives and lots of lettuce. The house dressing is a spicy creamy balsamic and wasn't liked by half of our group who prefer something lighter. The pasta was perfectly cooked and the marinara covered it all. I could eat just that and be happy. 

The standout food was the chicken marsala. Some how it wasn't too sweet but just sweet enough. There was no bad sour after taste that some have. There was a lot of mushrooms on top which for one of our members was a bit of let down but he worked around them. Get the chicken marsala and you will be content and ready to gamble.

The Chicken marsala - flavorless  and incredibly enough dry and the Seafood Linguini- lobster overcooked, which is hard to do, there was no white wine sauce, hardly any shrimp, and mussels , and clams, a few calamari and squid. Again flavorless, pasta not al dente...Again dry and flavorless...

The desert , Strawberry Shortcake, had a different twist, not for the better was like a marble cake, applaud trying a twist on a standard but recognize that the change was not for the better!

2721584,2016-01-19,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Overall, Carmine's is probably a 4. There are certainly dishes at Carmine's that are nothing special. The calamari and shrimp fra diavolo are two that come to mind that are just OK in my book.

But this review is about one menu item and one menu item only. The chicken scallopine. I've been to Carmine's in NYC many times, and the Las Vegas location is no different. The chicken scallopine at Carmine's is easily one of my favorite meals of all time. The lemon butter sauce is just amazing. The perfect blend of creamy, zesty, and lemony. It's so good that I even eat the spinach that it's served with, and I usually won't touch spinach. It's so good that I can eat an entire basket of bread just sopping it up. There's a recipe floating around online (from Carmine's directly I believe), but it's impossible to really replicate at home. It's never quite the same. Since the chicken is so thin, this is the one menu item that a very hungry person can probably tackle alone (if it's all that you order). I have a few times and I'm usually not a gluttonous eater. I just can't get enough of this stuff

Over $50 for an order of chicken scallopine and a glass of Chardonnay, but it's so good I don't care. Bonus points for the focaccia bread with tomato sauce on it. Goes perfectly with the lemon butter sauce.",pl9w4iMnxzOu-R76YNC20Q,0,0,5,_xzyY4NJKiESC95YXtTneQ

My favorite dish is the Chicken parmigiana with the penne a la vodka. A great mix of tomatoes, garlic and herbs! (And alcohol...) 

This is a family style restaurant with portions that can feed a group of 4 maybe even more, depending on how much you eat. 

The service is good, but the only downfall is that they don't have a menu to give to you. The menu is on screens located on the walls of the restaurant. It is big enough to see, but if someone walks by the table you lose your sight. It's hilarious when you're looking at other people trying to read the menu. I've seen a few people sitting at the tables bob and weave through people passing by. (It's embarrassing if it was you doing it)

The service, particularly the hostess stand.  They are all young and seem uninterested.  When we went to put our name in, and again when we went to ask a question, the feeling we got was that we were bothering them.  Not friendly either.  This is the only reason for 4 stars, and not 5.  The waiters were nice enough.  James was great and really friendly!

The good:
THE FOOD.  Everything is family style and the portions are HUGE.  For a party of 4, we only ordered one salad and one pasta entree and had difficulty finishing it! 
We were only in Vegas for 4 days, and we came here twice!
The bread is good; be sure to ask for olive oil and balsamic vinegar!
The Caesar salad was amazing.  Not overdressed and the croutons were just right.  The dressing was great too; you can ask for a side of it.
The spaghetti with bolognese sauce was amazing.  The pasta itself was al dente and the sauce was pretty freaking good.
Wish there was a Carmine's in California!

2922876,2015-07-05,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Just had a very unsatisfying meal at Carmine's--enough to compel me to write a Yelp review.

Upon the waiter's recommendation, my boyfriend and I ordered the pasta special, which happened to be the Carbonara. I was initially hesitant because I wasn't feeling like a heavy pasta kind of meal but our waiter insisted that the sauce was very light and he preferred it over the Pomodoro, which was what we originally had in mind. 

I really wish I wasn't so easily swayed by others' opinion because the Carbonara, as I expected, turned out to be incredibly nauseous. I could only stomach 2 fork-fuls before I started to feel nauseous. My feeling of disgust was only exacerbated by the harsh reality of having to spend $40 for a dish I barely touched and did not enjoy. Seeing as I am in Vegas and all, I guess I could elude this meal to a gamble that did not go in my favor...

The only saving grace of my experience today was the calamari. It really is as good as my fellow Yelpers suggest. But then again, don't let me sway your decision.",haS31C1AkmLz8vsWi3sgyA,0,0,2,G9Y2rioX1FGm5RHNTzw6Kw

The food was nothing fancy but a simple plate of pasta and marinara sauce, with two sausages added. It was very plain, simple, and underwhelming. Cheap food without a price tag to match. Also the food was barely lukewarm when we got our meal and quickly turned to being stone cold. 

Overall our impression of Carmines was that it was overpriced and poor value for money and not at all suited for smaller groups or couples. The food was plain, flavorless and cold.",ObivphnYqqAG3CJ9QKRn2w,0,0,1,orNyjP3fVZNx-E0VFb6hNw

2999480,2013-10-28,1,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Quick look: NYC's famed Carmines in the center on the Forum Shops Mall delivers  traditional Italian fare in MASSIVE family type portions. Couples / single diners beware - this is a lot of food and I suggest groups of 4 or more for ideal proportions. 

In depth review: being from NY we were well aware of the Carmine's reputation. Was excited to FINALLY get a chance to try their fare here in Vegas. Ate there this past Monday night and the massive space was pretty full at 7pm for dinner. Nice casual setting with high ceilings, a freakishly large bar with flat screens showing the football game and large menu boards and classic Italian pics decorating the walls. Felt very warm and comfortable even though the room was gargantuan and located in a busy mall. 

Server was a nice Serbian fella and he was very attentive. Made some good suggestions and explained the portions and the menu. We kept it simple and ordered a mixed drink, a glass of wine, calamari appetizer and the veal parmesan with penne pasta. The calamari priced at $17 was the largest portion I have ever seen. Was a mountain of fried squid and way too much for two people. It was good, breaded well and not too greasy. We almost filled up on this and had to stop ourselves. The bread was also very tasty!

The veal parmesan came out with perfect timing after the appetizer. The serving dish was piled 4 inches high with penne pasta and it included two giant slabs of veal parm on the top. Wife and I looked at each other in disbelief at how large this dish was. The waiter served us and we started to eat. It was very tasty and the veal was prepared perfectly. The red sauce was also delicious and was glad to see that they did not use sugar when preparing it. We ate till we couldn't eat any more and we had a lot to take home with us in doggy-bags. Was it the best I have ever had, no. But it was certainly one of the better traditional veal parm dishes in the city. 

It's a lot of food. Too much for less than four people. We actually had enough for two more additional meals!!

My advice would be to add a ""couples menu"" to their menu. Many couples go out in Vegas. It's a different market and I feel like the large, massive portions alienate couples who want to eat there. Who would want to carry doggy-bags around with them on the mall and on the all night? A lot of people do not have refrigerators in their hotel rooms as well. Price for two of us was about $130. So the pricing is not exactly cheap. 

Was a solid meal and w/o a smaller, couples menu - I will only return when I have family or friends in town and they want to eat traditional ""red sauce"" Italian.

I have also had lunch here - the submarine sandwiches are also MASSIVE! I had an Italian mixed and a tomato and mozzarella sandwich and both were tasty and well made. The bread is super fresh and they don't hold back on the meat. Two people can split one and have more than enough.",yuoaisepxm6QaBKiBxz6AA,3,1,4,9d1o1bouWp3BtabFY4m3hA

First, I was running out of options of where to host my sorority's annual reunion day. We have grown quite large and size and needed a venue that could accommodate 150 sisters. Carmine's can host that many plus lots more. 
Second, we were on a tight budget and Cassy, the special events manager, was able to put together a family style menu that that would accommodate almost all special diets. When planning for this many people it is difficult to make sure all diets are met and Cassy nailed it all making sure there was food that almost anyone with certain diets could eat. 
Third, the day of any event is always quite stressful and the staff - especially one server in particular Micheal - went above and beyond to make every lady in the house felt special! Even the smallest request was handle with a smile and he even put on a show for the group and sang a song in Italian.
Just a few other highlights: the food was absolutely delicious. The decor was elegant making decorating so easy with only really needing center pieces for the tables. But my favorite part is that the staff boxed up all the uneaten food and we were able to donate this to local shelter!

The food is all family style and each item can literally feed at least 2 people.  To start you have to get the Cold Antipasto.

One word Phenomenal.  Then if you want to go with an Italian staple you have to get the Lasagna.  The lasagna is doused in tomato sauce with the right amount of meat and cheese.  This this was dense and will fill you up fast!  If you have enough room for dessert you can never go wrong with the Cannoli's, but for some odd reason you are not human and still can eat a horse you have to get the TITANIC.  The TITANIC is literally the size of the actual ship.  It is The Titanic at Carmine's is a gigantic sundae made with six whopping scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, caramelized fruit, hot fudge sauce and an entire Chocolate Torta.

3212912,2013-10-20,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"I finished up my conference and had one last night in Vegas.  I'm Italian and wanted a no nonsense dish of pasta and salad.  I came across Carmines in the Caesar's Forum shops so went in.  Since I was by myself, the hostess recommended I sit at the bar.  She informed me that the portions were served family style but I could get half portions there.  Ok, no problem.  After I sat, my bartender confirmed I was there for dinner then pointed out that only certain items on the menu were served in so-called half portions.  Ok, so the pasta part was simple.  I was willing to pay $17 for a two serving dish of pasta pomodoro.  I noticed the sub selections came with a side salad so I asked if I could get one with my pasta.  Simple enough, right? Well, no.  I couldn't get a side salad with my pasta.  I informed them I was expecting to pay separately for it but ""No, we can't do that"".  So If I wanted a salad, I would have to pay another $17 dollars for a very large (serves 4) salad.  So needless to say, I left. Honestly, I don't think they cared.   With all the competition in Las Vegas, you would think Carmines would be a little more accommodating.  (By the way, the gentleman sitting next to me ordered a dish of rigatoni with no meat and got served a very large dish of rigatoni with a large amount of sausage. I guess he didn't like the explanation from the same manager who denied me my side salad.  Because, he left, too.)

3270402,2015-07-08,2,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"My grandparents who are from NYC have been telling me to try Carmines when I go to NYC for years and I just haven't got around to it. I stumbled across this one in Vegas over the weekend though and when I saw it, I knew it was my chance to try it. 

Our waiter was great - he explained how the dishes were FAMILY STYLE when we sat down and that those dishes are enormous so that we could try not to order too much food. Of course we still had too much food. The portions are ENORMOUS. He came around basically all the time to fill our water cups and had a great memory + sense of humor. 

I came here in a group of 3 people. We decided to order 2 dishes to split between us 3. A pasta dish and the Shrimp Scampi. Note that the Shrimp Scampi doesn't come with pasta itself. Just the shrimp. Both the meals we ordered tasted great - I really enjoyed the shrimp. Note that 2 meals was way more than enough food for this group of 3. But 2 meals gave us some variety, so if I were to go again as a group of 3, I would order 2 meals and take the rest home. Needless to say, none of us had room for dessert after this meal. 

Splitting the bill between 3 people including tip came out to around $30 per person which is pretty damn fair for Las Vegas for a nice dinner. Food in Vegas can get really expensive at a lot of the restaurants. Carmines has a great location being that is in the shops at Caesar's Palace. Anyone staying here or Bellagio or Palazzo/Venetian or anywhere around these can easily walk to dinner here which was a nice plus. 

Would I come back with a group of 3 or more people? Yes, definitely. Would I come back with just me and one other person? If we were really hungry or if we were ok with a lot of left overs, then yes, definitely.",hxXy147XYpa8lnjHNF_AGA,2,1,4,tm65ECt-TNowqKi4cwOQ3A

Service was nicely attentive, and the manager dropped by to check on our experience. That was an added plus.  If you live in Las Vegas, ask about the local's discount.

3303907,2013-12-04,3,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Checked out Carmines with my fellow Yelper Amar B. this Halloween. I've heard alot about this place so I was pretty excited to see what they had to offer. Carmine's occupies the former Planet Hollywood restaurant spot inside the Forum Shops. My first thoughts walking in were ""wow this place is huge and empty."" The restaurant is massive, vaulted ceillings, tons of pictures and sizeable bar.

The food here defintely gives 'family style"" dining a whole new meaning as the portions here on the are massive. I have never seen a restaurant regularly serve up so much food. The appetizer and two entrees we order were more than enough to feed the seven of us. Unfortunately, Carmine's failed to follow the common mantra of quality over quantity.

We started with ordering the Garlic Bread Parmigianino as a appetizer. The huge texas toast style slices of bread totally caked with a thick layer of Parmesan cheese and garlic seasoning. After about half through the slice, the oil from cheese and spread became overwhelming and I had to put it down. The Chicken Contadina was OK at best, huge pieces of bone-in chicken got cold too quickly and the sausage that accompanied it was surprisingly lacking in flavor. The last dish we had, Rigatoni Bolognese, was the best out of the three, the meat sauce and the pasta complimented each other nicely and dish was full of flavor.

Service was a bit below average for this type of restaurant. Our server came around infrequently to refill our miniature glasses of water and didn't even offer us a wine list or dessert menu. Not sure if he was just having a bad day but he came across as very uninterested, hurried, and unhospitable.

Carmine's is certainly not cheap, most entrees run anywhere from $30-$50 but keep in mind that they are meant to feed a large group of people. The place has a lot of potential and I would love to come back and check out some of their other offerings.",ALw8EN21lby0vWtfD6JfIw,5,2,3,8uXk-pY0KOEJaAhtRJZf6w
3304909,2013-12-11,1,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"A big disappointment. My brother and I went here to see if they are as good as they claim. Nah. Go somewhere else.
They say they serve large family style portions to feed at least 4 hungry people, Italian ""generous family"" style. We ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese, about $38, and while it came on a big plate, there obviously was not enough pasta. So after two small portions each, we were left hanging. There was still some meat sauce, so we asked if we can just get some more spaghetti. The waiter said the manager said it will be $12.50 more. Since we were unsatisfied, we had to bite the bullet and order it. But I felt ripped off. If they had given enough pasta to begin with, there would not have been this problem. My brother and I always eat at Buca di Beppo and we never ever had this problem. And, my big complaint is pasta is cheap. In my opinion their true hospitality and good business sense to make the customer happy would have been to just give us the extra portion of pasta just to be satisfied, as opposed to being reamed. PASTA IS CHEAP. Or, if they wanted to charge, max. should have been $6.

The waiter was also not a very pleasant guy. He was always hurrying, he had no genuine interest, he was perfunctory. Proof: we had to ask for bread. We had to ask for the olive oil and balsamic vinegar to dip the bread. And though we still had not finished the bread, he swoops away the olive oil and vinegar. We had to ask for it back.

Finally, this place is really a joke. When you call a place LEGENDARY, it's reputation is vaunted, by its length of it in business, at least, arbitrarily, around 30 years; it has served actual LEGENDS, this being Vegas, it should have served and has documented patronage by Sinatra, Elvis, etc. And to be a legend, it really should be respected and renown; Carmine's IS A LEGEND IN THEIR OWN MIND, ONLY. Look at their sign: ESTABLISHED 1990. THAT IS HARDLY A LEGEND. Overstated, just tooting their own horn, with nothing to back it up. With all the great Italian restaurants here in Vegas I am sorry we even went here. Appropriate descriptions would have been ""Famous Italian food"", or ""Celebrated Italian Cuisine"". LEGEND? Since only 1990? Have you noticed true legendary places? Vacheron watches, depuis (since) 1755. So give me an effing break Carmine's.

I also politely told them there, and through their comment place, at their website, of my utter disappointment. No reply. In other words, they don't really care about customer service. All they want is $$$$. This place may go on for a while due to foot traffic. But you can rest assured I DO NOT AND WILL NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE AT ALL. I'd rather go to Buca or the many other fine Italian restaurants here in Vegas.",9LX0aIyVbmhfEjqJEbt4ZA,8,0,2,kzcLm4LDLz8gP4vj2O4nnw

We were surprised to find that food is ""Family Style"", i.e. portions of everything they serve are for 6 or more people.  So this is a better option for groups.  But hell with it, we decided to order things anyway....  They serve great New York-style Italian food, and LOTS of it!  (*Note: we had so much food leftover, we gave some to the table next to us.. they then gave us some Calamari, which was really very good).

Started with Carmine's salad--  excellent!  Big enough for 8 people, but we scarfed down plenty of it, so good.   I ended up buying one of their cookbooks, mainly just to get that recipe!  Ordered Chicken Parmesan for entree, also great.  After dinner, found they had Decaf Espresso-- hurray!  

Staff were all EXCELLENT-- from the hostess to the waiters to the busboy-- they were all so friendly, nice, efficient, great.   A very fun Iand FILLING!) dinner to start our Vegas vacation.

Their prices seem to add that notion in there because it is expensive and not worth the price if you were ordering a meal and appetizer per person.  Sharing, maybe; individual, no way.

We were here for a party so they had dishes prepared for us and they were passed around the table.  Therefore, we tried many different dishes so I was able to experience a lot of their dishes.  We began with calamari, mushrooms, and salad.  The calamari was very good and cooked perfectly but the others were not worth mentioning.  The main meal consisted of a few types of pasta and some meat accompaniments. I did not think any were exceptional or worth mentioning either.  The sauce was solid on the spaghetti, however.

Reasons for my mediocre 3-star review: 

slow service...there were two other tables besides ours, and we waited 10min til we were asked if we wanted something to drink...another 12min til we could order our food...then over 20 til we started eating. (during busy hour, that wouldn't be bad...but there was only 5 tables seated in the whole restaurant at the time)

and the other thing that bugged me...ordered a hot sandwich (which was great...and huge!!) but i asked if my GF could have a little side plate of spaghetti w/ marinara instead of the side salad, but was immediately and definitely shut down. not a 'oh, let me see what i can do' or a 'that will be a $$ upcharge' etc etc. just a flat outright NO. c'mon, we're only two people and don't want to order a family size boatload of spaghetti just to try it. pretty sure that could have been arranged. 

anyways, i'd caution any small parties from going in...will be hard to find appropriate sized dishes to order. but for larger groups who are open to sharing dishes family style, this would be fantastic",pb52d0Cmv2ZtKmts_WGcHg,0,0,3,vAwPLXxQa_t4p3oYTstYCQ

The place has a nice ambiance.  Our server was very nice.  He did disappear for LOONGG periods of time, and we spent a fair amount of time waiting.  (The restaurant was empty.)  But he was very courteous and friendly other than that.

The food was not great.  I love stuffed mushrooms, but I was not impressed with these.  The stuffing had a mushy, porridge-like texture.  It was kind of gross.  After one bite, I scooped most of the stuffing out and just ate the mushrooms themselves.  The word ""goop"" sums up the stuffing, and that's not a word you want to use with stuffed mushrooms.

The chocolate cake was quite good, but very rich, and my wife and I could only handle a few bites.  I have no problem with having a rich dessert that you can't eat a lot of, provided they bring you a portion size that reflects the fact that you can't eat more than a few bits.  But this was an enormous piece of cake, and a price to match.  That doesn't work if the cake is so rich that you can only stand to eat a few bites.

For goopy stuffed mushrooms, a large piece of super-rich cake, and two cokes, we spent about $60.  The food (especially the goopy stuffing on the mushrooms) was not good enough to make us return; the price makes it a ""definitely won't be back.""",FvjhVWS4L4rPAumWpmMwZA,0,0,2,rD0ipRiHBwEB6-YDiAOPRw

Father in law was always talking about wanting to try this place since couple months ago and was waiting for Carmines to open.  We dined here last weekend and our experience with both food and service was horrid!  Our server never came back to ask if we needed anything else once our meals came out.  Our pasta dish was undercooked.  The clam pasta tasted extremely bland and tasteless.  The meat sauce was boring.  It took 15 minutes and asking 3 different people before we got a basket of bread.  My in laws were so fed up with the slow service and horrible food.  What's going on Carmines???  We will not ever return.,_m3SyztWE_ji0wLxsL2Ycg,4,1,1,U3MomuP1lNnVUclIQ1cdTw

But they messed up my meal TWICE. By the time my family was done eating their overcooked veal and ravioli (the only redeeming part of the meal), they had brought my food out for a third time. We had them box it up because I wasn't about to make my family wait for me to finish. Did they comp the meal in anyway? No. And don't get me started on the service. Unattentive and didn't even ask how the food was, we had to tell them they screwed up. Will NEVER return and do not recommend and wish I could give them zero stars.

APPETIZERS
The Fried Calamari is an excellent choice. My group also ordered the Caesar Salad and Mixed Salad. Both were standard. I liked the Caesar, though it had too much dressing for my preference. 

ENTREES
We ordered several other pasta entrees, but below are the dishes that I tried.

Chicken Scarpariello: Skinlesss chicken thighs and breasts that were well-seasoned and flavorful. 

Eggplant Parmigiana: Layers of eggplant, and plenty of gooey mozzarella cheese and marinara sauce.  

Shrimp Scampi: These were gone almost in an instant. The garlicky, buttery shrimp was delicious, and they weren't the tiny frozen variety. 

DESSERT
Titanic:  My group and I sunk the Titanic. This is seriously a massive dessert that requires team effort. Its foundation was a decadent chocolate brownie. On top of that were scoops of ice cream, huge dollops of cream, slices of strawberries and pineapples, a drizzle of chocolate, and a sprinkling of chopped hazelnuts. After we dug in and devoured most of the monstrous dessert, the Titanic resembled the aftermath of the Stay Puft Marshmallow's annihilation in the first Ghostbusters movie. 

SERVICE
The staff did a great job taking care of my group. 

OTHER
There are gluten free options available, such as the Pasta Vodka Sauce.

The next portion was a big ol' plate of ragu with spaghetti.  It had meatball and italian sausage links and pork butt.  The pork butt was outstanding.  The italian sausage kinda gave me heart bun later that night but that was ok.

We knew we wanted a salad, so the waiter had suggested getting 2 salads because each salad would feed 2 or 3 people. We got the mixed green salad, two of them. As for the main, we all decided to share the Eggplant Parmigiana and the Rigatoni & Broccoli. Again, the waiter suggested we get a third main dish as he didn't think it would be enough for the 8 of us, but we held off this time. 

When the salad came out, boy did we feel the waiter kind of misled us. The salad was HUGE, it probably could have fed 5 of us comfortably. I don't know if it has to be said, but there was plenty of salad uneaten by the end of the meal. The salad was average, I think the only reason I enjoyed it was because I was craving greens/vegetables. Again, when the two main dishes came out, we were really glad we hadn't ordered a third main as the waiter advised. These family sized dishes are no joke. Nothing memorable popped out for me for the mains, I was hungry and I was full after I ate, the dishes were neutral to me - they weren't particularly bad or good. 

If you want a place to just eat a lot of blah tasting carbs, this is the place for you. However, there are a lot of other options in the area. Plus, the per glass wine costs were a bit steep. Plus, the waiter was not friendly at all. That is all.",eCcP_PZzRzeg7qI0mHK71w,4,2,3,Eln3k8sIbli--poKd4nHLg

Would not go and would not recommend again.
Really disappointed.
I have been coming to carmines for 4+ years based on my brothers recommendation. My brother is a Las Vegas local.

Had the worst experience last night.
Ordered; bottle of wine which was not brought out when ordered, instead I needed to remind them when the appetizers came out. So we had no wine until the food was served. Appetizers; baked clams (not as good as usual, over cooked on top, too hard to chew), side of meatballs (was ok and really the only shining light of the dinner). Entree; penne vodka which was terrible. Sauce was runny, not creamy, with giant cloves of garlic. Almost as if some ingredients had been left out.  Penne vodka was sent back only to have it brought back to the table 2 minutes later to be clearly the same dish only nuked with overly cooked pasta added to the grotesque dish. Which was then sent back again and I asked for it not to be remade.
The pasta was taken off and the female manager (Dani) did come over to speak with me. She attempted to resolve the situation by bringing out 6 Cannoli (3 to go and 3 for the table). I am deathly allergic to pistachio nuts and the Cannoli were covered. I told the woman who brought them out that I was allergic and she said no problem and that she would bring out some Cannoli without pistachio nuts. The manager Dani, also came over and I told her as well. I waited 20-25 minutes for the Cannoli to be brought out to the table and finally gave up and left.

The food was mediocre this is why I rated it as 2 stars. But the waiter Frank P was horrible.  Unprofessional, inattentive, and nonexistent. I am not exaggerating when it came to his profession as a server. 

We walked in got seated waited for our waiter for about 5 minutes. Saw another family get seated. A waiter approached them right away and took their drinks. Then he came over to our table didn't ask what we wanted to drink and told us about the food. He came back in about 20 mins. The other family already received their drinks and salad. At this point I was already getting impatient. He comes by after 20 mins and takes our order. We ordered the stuffed artichokes and a pasta dish. We waited and waited. Didnt know why it took so long since it was not busy. Didn't get our stuffed artichokes until another 25min at this point I was so hungry that I wasn't even mad when the appetizer had come. Not once did he check up on us. Then not long after our appetizers came our main dish arrived. They did not even give us plates. Our waiter was no where to be found and we had to ask a host to give us plates. At this point I was outraged. The food was ok but for it's reputation I expected better food. Then finally after being there an hour half he shows up asks how we were  doing while eating our meal. After finish eating we sat there waiting for our waiter Frank. After  15 mins we found him asked for our check and he puts our bill on the table said nothing. I did not want to leave a tip but it is so hard for me not to. So I only had given him 15% rather the 20%.  We didn't get a proper greeting or a proper farewell. We left disgusted of the service. I would not come here again because the service  was so bad. I expect bad service from a pit stop on a self serve buffet but not this place.  It was an unpleasant experience. I would  be more lenient if it was super busy but it was not busy at all.

Sat at the bar with my guest and enjoyed basketball and some great food.  Drinks were priced reasonably and maybe even poured a tad heavy, which was great.  The food was HUGE as it's served family style but the prices are totally fair.  The challenge with eating at Carmines with 1 other person is that you have to agree on your dishes.  But since we did, it worked out great.  We had the fried zucchini to start and the manicotti as an entree.  Food, in total, was less than $45 and more than we could eat.  That, my friend, is a bargain considering the location and quality.  It's much cheaper than Rao's and I found the food substantially better, too.  You are getting a dish that serves 3 - 4 for the price of a single entree at Rao's.  Heck, it's about the same price as a burger at Ramsay's.  The service is similar and very good, also.  This will be our new go to Italian on the strip for sure.",GcQkAWX_cfyAnZ3TwhiQSQ,0,0,5,dV4J-Ut4P_S2ftm3bZ2NgA

3717386,2017-09-05,18,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"We came here to celebrate my grandma's 70th birthday and there were about 40 of us, we had a private room upstairs with a balcony with a great view of the strip. We had about 3-4 servers that assisted us, it almost felt as if we had the restaurant to ourselves (which we did not) but we had the whole second floor to ourselves lol. We opted for this restaurant because my grandma loves Italian food and they do family style dining here so it was a great choice.

The restaurant itself was very beautiful and made you feel at home, there were lots of pictures gracing the walls. It was very reminiscent of Maggiano's and Buca di Beppo as far as the decor goes. It's very welcoming and spacious, lots of seating and the people here are so friendly.

We already had a set menu for the occasion, for the appetizers we had Caesar Salad and Calamari, for the pasta we had Lasagna and Linguine with Shrimp in white sauce, for the entrees we had Chicken Marsala and Chicken Parmigiana and for dessert we had Italian Cheesecake and Strawberry Shortcake. We had 3 tables full of people and each table was given two of each dish, talk about an overwhelming amount of food. There was so much food I wasn't able to taste everything (I made the mistake of filling up on their delicious bread before appetizers arrived lol). The Caesar Salad was very good and fresh, it wasn't drowned in dressing and it had a good flavor. Their Lasagna was amazing, it was the biggest portion I'd ever seen. It was layered with yummy ricotta cheese, lots of meat but I wish there was a bit more sauce because we all were fighting over the little sauce that was in the serving dish! The Linguine with Shrimp was also very good, the shrimp were more like prawns and they were quite generous with the amount given. The shrimp were cooked perfectly as was the linguine and the wine sauce was so delicious. But my favorite dish was the Chicken Parmigiana, it was seasoned, breaded and cooked to perfection!! The nice layer of Mozzarella on top as well as the yummy marinara complimented it well although it would have tasted perfect by itself. If I was not full at that point I surely would have had to big pieces. Lastly I tried the Italian Cheesecake for dessert, it was definitely different. It was very light and airy not like the typical cheesecake and it had a bit of a lemon flavor. 

Overall this restaurant was amazing and the food was amazing, definitely in my top 5 for Italian restaurants. I will gladly be back when I'm in town.",qFxytBrCr8jDpvKidZ2Vrw,27,22,5,iG6sFKxuYNL_YRrHEXEY6w

3733465,2015-12-16,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"So my family and I were looking for an authentic Italian restaurant because we've never been able to find a decently priced one. So we tried Carmine's after reading reviews and seeing that it was averagely priced compared to other restaurants. After eating there it definitely could use some improvements

A major negative about the restaurant was that I was surprised at how they don't have menus and they looked at me weirdly when I asked them about menus. I mean 99.9% of restaurants have menus so I don't why it's weird asking about it. I don't think any Italian restaurants that I've ever gone to don't give out menus. I suppose it was meant to save costs but I just don't get the logic behind this strategy especially when new customers who come here can easily be turned off by this weird lack of menu experience. Now you can say everyone doesn't mind, however when I went there I saw at least two tables sit down and leave after walking back and forth to look at the menu on the wall. I mean when I go into a restaurant I expect to see menus that way I can converse with people i'm eating with about what to eat and such, especially with dishes that I have to share. So once we sat down they said that menus were on a big screen at the wall and If I wanted a menu I needed to take a picture of it with my phone or stare at it from my table or go up there and look at it. Problem was that the menu on the wall only covered certain portions of the restaurant and certain tables couldn't get a clear view of the menu and my phone was almost dead from a day full of sight seeing. When you make a menu on the wall make sure everyone can see it from a table, that way people can talk to each other in what they want to eat especially since all dishes are shared. That way customers don't have to keep going back and forth and risk higher chances of collisions with waiters, staff, other customers or even cause accidents on spilling food and drink on other people who were all dressed nicely. There's a higher risk of accidents occurring when you have that many people moving around a finite spaced environment. Their menu wasn't even that overly complicated so it could easily be a page or even used as a place mat for eating. So many ideas available when deciding your menu. Then they have certain tables not occupied near the menu wall, because I imagine it obstructs the view of the menu or that people would hate the idea of people walking back and forth around you while you're trying to enjoy a meal. Kind of a waste of real estate for a restaurant and loss revenue when those tables can easily be filled. So a lot of problems could be solved if they just created a menu.

Now another minor negative was the food. It wasn't terrible but it wasn't amazing either. The pasta, meats, veggies, and even seafood were all exceptionally fresh. You can taste it. Nothing feels mushy, dried or like it's been sitting in the fridge for months. Everything is exceptionally fresh. The only problem was that the food wasn't really hot. It was warm. My family ordered the Prime Rib special on Saturday and it was warm. It was delicious but it was warm. If it was hotter the food would've easily been a 9/10. I mean if I'm paying that kind of price for that food I expect a certain level of quality. 

The prices were insane. Just ordering two dishes you can easily top $150. We ordered 3 dishes so you can imagine how expensive it was. The prime rib special on Saturday was $95. But they said it could feed four people. If your family are big eaters like mine, then 2 people could easily finish that. Pastas start at the mid $35 range but adding substitutions adds another $15 to it. Portions are average for that price I would say, 

The major positive about Carmine's was our waiter. He was decent and was constantly helping us probably the only decent staff member of the whole place. Especially when we wanted a new table because their typical 4 person table wouldn't have been able to accommodate 3 full plates of food. So remember to ask for a bigger table if you're a big eater.

And like I said earlier some tables have absolutely no view of the menu and you could really tell which were the good tables and which were the bad ones. 

Would I go there again? Maybe. It wasn't anything memorable, especially for that price.",F099wQqbQHp89Zyqem_M3g,0,0,2,2gccxIPTQF714UxnHx1mbw

It had everything seafood in it you can imagine, mussels, clams, shrimp, lobster and crab.  The portion comes in a huge bowl, I kid you not.  Ordered a side of garlic bread and the garlic bread came on a huge platter about 2 feet long with 8 huge slices of garlic bread.  The serving is family style.  If you have a big group you will get your money's worth.  If you are a party of 2, you may want to think about eating here.  It was too much food and we ended up only eating half of it.

The ambiance made me feel like I was in New York during the gangster days.  Our waiter had an accent that resembled the guys on the Sopranos.  He was entertaining and very helpful with answering questions from the menu.  We both had a latte after dinner and it was delish! 

I took away one star because the portions are large and there is no ability to order half portions.  A party of 2 cannot finish the portions they provide.  It would be nice if they would consider putting half portions on their menu.

We ordered the veal parmesan and lasagna; I like pasta with my chicken parmesan, so I assumed I would want it with veal parmesan as well. It came with 1 pound of pasta! Each entrée was roughly $40 each. Not sure what the charge was for the side of pasta.

I don't generally eat meat, so, this was an indulgent treat for me. Sadly, I just was not that impressed with the veal or the lasagna. Both seemed to taste as if they included canned ingredients. Yes, they give you enormous portions, and claim that everything is served family style. However, I would rather have small to average size portions and good food over ginormous portions and not so great food. 

Service was absolutely exceptional. Had to be the best service received during this visit to Las Vegas. I wish I remembered our servers name because she was outstanding!

Our bill came to just over $100 before tip. This is generally what we spend for dinner in Las Vegas, however, I would've rather had an indulgent dinner at Mastro's or the like. 

When I'm in the mood for Italian food on the strip I'll stick with Maggiano's. At least there I know I'll leave satisfied.

3875186,2013-12-04,2,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"I used to work here in the Forum Shops and was one of those anticipating for Carmine's to open and finally got to try them out last week. I came here with a party of 11 to celebrate my aunt's birthday. I must say my aunt and her family are from NY and have eaten at the Carmine's there, so the expectations were set pretty high. I do love the inside of the place especially how the high raised ceilings have all sorts of pictures hanging on the walls. If only the restaurant was in a stand alone building then it would truly give that Manhattan feel. Before anything was served we noticed that the plates were at the end of the table, my aunt expected the server to place each plate in front of us because that's what the server did in NY. It didn't happen, so I guess here it's more of a self serve concept. My beverage of choice was the strawberry lemonade since another review mentioned how good and tart it was. She was right I did enjoy the tartness(tasted similar to Red Robbin's Freckled Lemonade), too bad it's not free refill because I sure did finish that drink before the food was served.

So here is the break down of the food:

Carmine's salad- I liked all the additional toppings in this salad like berries, nuts, and salami if I remember correctly. We had 2 salads and assumed they were the same because they looked very similar. After tasting both we realized the other one was a mixed green salad. I prefer Carmine's salad and say it's worth the $3 difference. 

Calamari- pretty standard, wasn't too greasy and the breading was like how I've had it at other Italian restaurants.   

Zuppa Di Clams (white)- I am not a fan of clams but my brother convinced me to try the last piece and I was pleasantly surprised. If you enjoy clams I definitely would recommend this dish, pretty delicious I must say. The sauce for the clams was so good we saved it to put on our pasta.

Broiled porterhouse steak- this was really delicious and I thought it was perfectly cooked with various pieces being rare and medium (refer to the picture). One of the better cuts of steak I've had from a restaurant. Warning this is pricey, costing $80.

Chicken Scarpariello- I read from another review recommending this dish and when we ordered it the server said they were out?! I was shocked at first because I've never heard of a chicken dish running out at a restaurant. Thankfully she came back and said they still had it. It was cooked in a buttery sauce, probably my favorite dish of the night and reasonably price. I will definitely order this the next time I come back. 

There was a pasta dish we ordered but I can't remember what the name was. Next time I come, I'll also order the Rigatoni & Broccoli as recommended by another yelper. According to my aunt and her husband the food was a little on the salty side, but still a good quality in comparison to the one in NY. However the service was lacking. I really want to come back but it probably won't be any time soon. This place was pricey so I'll have to find a special occasion to come here for.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,4,2,4,N84u33Au4hdUqveQlSWvwA

They'll start you off with bread. Ask them for the olive oil and balsamic vinegar because they don't just give it. Look up on the wall and you'll find a brightly lit marquee, which has the full menu. Great idea to save money on menus & trees, bad idea for people with poor eye sight. I just pulled up the menu on my phone. No biggie. You can pick any type of pasta and any sauce to your liking and they will gladly make it. 

With just a party of three we had an appetizer and one entree for sharing. It was more than enough to be extremely full and to have leftovers. 
For the appetizer we had the meat stuffed mushrooms, which were amazing. Tasted like a juicy meatball on top of a mushroom. 
For the entree we opted for the linguini with bolognese sauce. The noodles were al dente and the thick meaty sauce was just perfect. On the table there's shaved Parmesan. Don't forget to add that to everything!

We had turkey, mashed potatoes with gravy, carrots, green beans, Brussels sprouts, candied yams, cranberry sauce and stuffing. Turkey was kinda dry. My favorite was the candied yams, stuffing and green beans. Tim loved their Brussels sprouts. Overall food was just so so. It didn't wow me. But I do appreciate the family style serving concept. 

Atmosphere was awesome. Loved the setting. Feels like a big Tahoe hotel. Two stories. And we were at the second level. Downstairs is where they had the bar and smaller tables. Music was great. Perfect for the party. Service was slow, but good. Drinks were always filled. But we had to ask for more bread. My picky eater child only wanted their pizza style bread. 

I'm giving it a 4 star since I don't think it's fair to judge them base off just their Thanksgiving menu.",gIreVYvrWe9zPvHOCujs8g,1,0,4,EOgDUCVQ39Gvm9Wxj_wuBA

Located inside Caesar's Palace on the strip, Carmine's is an upscale, family-style restaurant a la Maggiano's, except darker and more intimate. Probably would be a place Tony Soprano would stop at while shopping in Vegas with Carmine and the kids. I has a couple Negroni's to start, which were a bit different than any standard Negroni recipe I've tasted--very lemon-forward and light in the Vermouth; still tasty, though. The menu is convenient projected onto the side wall, so everybody can view, discuss, and order--neat idea. The table ordered Ceasar Salad, Garden Salad (which I did not sample, but the Caesar was excellent--homemade dressing with the authentic anchovy notes and fresh garlic bite), Lasagna, which was a colossal, seemingly 10-layer monstrosity which was a real crowd-pleaser. Meatballs looked great too, but I did not try one. Manicotti and beef tenderloin were both delicious as well. The only thing I thought was a bit odd was that it was evident they usually do not bring out olive oil for the bread--when we requested it, we got a little caddy with pale, ""possibly extra-version"" oil usually seen on salad bars. No big deal. It would be tough to go wrong with Carmine's if you're hungry and with a group.",YojrehzWlyDqwOZ1tzXdeg,0,0,4,lMBTDxPanFC9rl2Of084vg

Such a fun place to go. Everything is intended to be shared so the portions are HUGE and it's really a great deal price-wise if you split everything with your table. Service was awesome and the atmosphere was fun and lively. 

To be honest, I don't remember all the different dishes we tried (there were so many and I didn't even get to taste them all, I was so full!), but here's what I remember most:

Antipasto Plate: Fun, nice variety. Although, they don't really give enough of each item for everyone to try them all so you kind of had to dive in first in order to get what you wanted. But, all the things I did try was delicious. (They had octopus and smoked salmon!)

Fried Zucchini: Super fun! It came in a gigantic tower. I think my jaw dropped to the floor when I saw just how much zucchini we were getting. Haha. It was tasty, but it basically tastes like a french fry.

Chicken Parmesan: Delicious. I liked this one a lot. Definitely recommended.

Titanic: Whoa, was this dessert a monster! It was so big!! Made of ice cream, strawberries, pirouette cookies, etc. it really was a titanic beauty. I thought we were never going to finish it, but I'm embarrassed(proud?) to say we did...super quickly.",hI9gqs3HE80vM3Bb20s6UA,5,3,5,ui_iAL4uB0y0mC7KLN-n7w

We received a basket of assorted bread as we waited for the spaghetti and meatballs that we ordered, but the bread was unappetizingly cold and rather unsatisfying to the palate. The pasta came out within an acceptable time frame, and the pasta was served to us from the family size platter into individual plates. The pasta was very very salty. Indeed if you enjoy strongly salty pasta this is the restaurant and dish for you. I, however, left with lips slightly puffed from excess sodium absorption. 

I will be giving our leftover pasta to the first homeless person we meet on the strip. I hope for his sake that he has access to a lot of clean drinking water.

I don't recall the quality of the food but decided to try Carmine's in Las Vegas since the one in NYC has an excellent reputation.  I have mixed reviews.  For the incredibly high prices we paid for pasta, it's not worth it.

I went with a group of ten people and we ordered:
Lasagna:  good but nothing to rave about
Meatballs:  Wow...you call these meatballs?  Not very good at all
Chicken Parmesan:  Actually quite good and the best item we ordered.
Chicken Scarpariello:  Not much flavor, sausage was good.
Rigatoni Pomodoro:  heavy basil sauce, tasty but not worth paying $35 for a huge bowl of $4 pasta.

We didn't order desserts since we were full from our entrees.  Portions are huge but what's the point of having huge portions of just average food?  How about focusing on quality instead?

Service was excellent except for one waiter who kept on hovering around our table after we were finished, almost as if he were trying to rush us out even though there wasn't anyone waiting to be seated.

In short, service was straddling the line between mediocre and poor. Our server showed little interest in making an impression- come to find it was the end of her shift. After our food was brought out she whisked by us saying ""I'm leaving, so and so will finish up with you."" Gave us a brief smile and left. No thank you, no asking if we needed anything else. My boyfriend sat with an empty drink for nearly the remainder of our meal before replacement server came in to check on us. Nice. 
We had the vodka penne...it was good, in an Americanized Italian sort of way. I'm also weary of ""Italian"" labeling like this, because they are seldom authentic Italian. No exception here. The draw is portion size and I get it, like Cheesecake Factory. I guess we're just not people who like to sacrifice taste for a heaping pile of bland food. I will also add, like many reviews have done before me, the bread was cold. Like...not a hint of warmth to it. Yuck.

The chicken saltimbocca was not very good. The chicken cutlets were very thin, and the chicken itself was not tender. They also skimped on the Prosciutto topping. The cannolis were ok, but taking into account that this resturuant is originally based in NYC (in which the NYC/NJ metro area has some of the best cannolis you will find anywhere in the world), Carmine's cannolis were disappointing. The service was slow, but we went on a Saturday night when the place was very busy, so I really can't fault them much for that. The decor is nice, but this is not the place to come if you want to have a nice quite dinner....the sound level of the crowd is very loud (more like being in a crowded bar, rather than a restaurant). Carmine's is very similar to Maggiano's, serving the large family style portions. I have not been to Maggiano's in several years, but what I do remember is that the food and atmosphere was far better than Carmine's. Overall, I think Carmine's is ok, and maybe if I ordered some other dishes, and it was a little less crowded/noisy, I would give it a higher rating.

After our show, we decided to head back over to give it a shot. It was maybe 11 or 1130 so there was no wait to get a table. 

The seating is a little unusual because where you sit decides what type of menu you can order from. We were suggested to sit at the bar because it was just the two of us. I guess if you sit in the main restaurant, you can only order from the regular menu that is all served 'family style' in huge portions to feed many people. Even the bar menu had notation that the portions would be large enough for 2 to 3 people. 

The last couple hours before close are included in Happy Hour and you can get deals on appetizers and drinks. We decided to try the Calamari for an appetizer and then ordered the Rigatoni with Sausage and Broccoli to split. Both our appetizer and entree were served fairly quickly and not surprisingly, both portions were huge. The Calamari could have fed 4 people and our Rigatoni would have easily fed 3. Everything we had was great and fresh. Everything from the red sauce to the Italian Sausage seemed like it was made in house. We ate as much as we could but could have fed another person or two with the leftovers. Seriously, don't let your eyes get bigger than your stomach. 

The staff were all friendly and the restaurant was clean. The prices are on the higher end, but the portions are enormous. Try to come during the Happy Hour times for a cheaper meal.",PFA6aBQ5yGnY8ccNcGde4Q,5,2,5,BAi8-Df-wmzUnD9GJolRUw

Myself, my husband, and two other couples came here to have a nice, long, dinner. You know, the type of dinner you have with friends you haven't seen in awhile and you want to catch up. That's what we wanted to do. But our waiter asked us about three times if we were done with our meals (we weren't). I felt as though they wanted our table out to make room for another. I wish I hadn't felt that way, but I did.

On to the food -- the food, like I said, was spectacular. We ordered the lasagna, manicotti, and chicken dish with mushrooms, in a delish brown sauce. The portions were pretty much just right for 6 people. The lasagna was amazing, just absolutely sublime. The manicotti was all right, it could have used more sauce.

We did order drinks, and while I enjoyed my lemonade, I did not realize I would be charged for a re-fill when the busser asked me if I wanted ""another one"". $4.95 for a lemonade x2 is kind of ridiculous, and when I saw it on the bill and saw my half-drunk second cup still sitting on the table, I downed it before leaving.

To end our dinner we had The Titanic - a glorious dessert, with brownies, ice cream, whipped cream, chopped nuts, strawberries, and pineapples. You have to see it to believe it, and eat it to love it. 

Besides the service and outrageous cost of lemonade I was very pleased. I would definitely go back. I'll just stick to drinks that can be re-filled next time.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,2,3,4,mE5QpXwnU-Zg1_tII81PKg

Turns out we got our chance sooner than expected when our plans at the other restaurant did not go entirely as planned. We had show tickets at 7:30 and had sat at a table at the other place from 5:30 to 6:15 without getting served so much as drinks, so we politely took our leave and ran back to Carmine's. Could they possibly accommodate us and get us to the show on time with such short notice? 

We were seated straight away with no wait. When we explained our situation to our server, Ryan, he had our cocktails out within 5 minutes. Once we'd decided on our dinner items he talked to his manager and they bumped up our service order and had our entrees out about 5 minutes after that. We couldn't believe it! When they brought it to us we actually said ""that can't be ours"". 

Did getting it so quickly impact the quality of the dish at all? If it did, then they should be charging more, because everything was fantastic. For drinks I had the Espresso Martini which was just spot on and my wife had the Sicilian Mule, which was somehow actually even better. We ordered Angel Hair Pomodoro and Veal Saltimboca for our entrees, which was way too much food for two people, but we ate every last scrap of it anyway because it was amazing. Oh, and we ate most of the bread basket too because how else were we going to sop up all of that delicious sauce that the Veal Saltimbocca was covered in?

We started with appetizers: Caesar salad, stuffed artichokes and calamari.  All 3 good.  

Entrees: both of the lobster offerings, spaghetti and meatballs, lasagna, prime rib chops, and some kind of vodka pasta. 

The vodka sauce pasta was not enjoyed by anyone. 

Everything else was delicious and prepared perfectly.

4520418,2013-11-01,3,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"I visited Carmine's NYC during Thursday Oct 31st (Halloween,) for dinner and this place was pretty empty. We had originally made a reservation for 7 people for 7:30pm, but when we arrived a little less than half of the restaurant was still empty. As we arrived the restaurant had a very interesting layout but you could still feel the Italian roots. There are no elaborate walls or breaks in the dining area its all one large box covered with pictures and a massive ceiling. Carmine's offers a list of authentic Italian dishes, including but not limited to Antipastas, Rigatoni, Chicken Contadina, Garlic Bread Parmigianino, and not to mention their 20ft wine rack in the front of the restaurant.

During our visit, our party had ordered Garlic Bread Parmigianino for appetizers, Rigatoni A Bolognese and Chicken Contadina as our entrees. The garlic bread seemed a bit too authentic for my taste; it consisted of large cuts of bread caked with Parmesan cheese which I thought was icing at first. The Rigatoni Bolognese, which was essentially Rigatoni pasta with a meat sauce, was much better in taste and quality, the pasta was a bit cold but the meat sauce had a good consistency and flavor. Likewise the Chicken Contadina, was served with a similar pasta however the chicken was bone-in and got cold quickly. Two things I didn't enjoy very much.

Overall the service was a bit above average, our server was definitely very knowledgeable of the menu and had proper etiquette when it came to serving us and maintaining the cleanliness of our table.  The ambiance was about what I expected, as I mentioned earlier the restaurant is laidback and has a very spacious layout with a high ceiling, which I like. There were picture of random Italian figures all across the walls, which contributed to the new world Italian roots feel. I would say this restaurant was a good representation of what to expect from authentic Italian restaurants in the US. 

In a nutshell, this place is a more expensive Buca de Beppo with moderately better quality food. I was definitely not impressed and would rate my experience average at best. Unfortunately family style restaurants don't really do it for me as the food always ends up cold less than halfway through the meal. Overall, this is a great casual restaurant to get the authentic feel of Italian family style dining.

The food was far from good and the restaurant was overpriced for what it was. I was served overly salty plates, burnt broccolis and overcooked pastas. The price made it that much worst, as I had much better food for a lot less on that trip (come on... It's Vegas! There is good food in that city). My one star goes to the service, that was pretty decent.

It always smelled delicious when we passed by so I wanted to try it. The portions are huge for two so I'd recommend coming with groups of five or more. What was the most disappointing though was that the lasagna we ordered was completely bland. It was tasteless to a point I had to sprinkle salt on it myself. There were no hints of oregano, basil, or really anything for that matter in the food. Not only was it tasteless but the huge portion came out in a matter of seconds. It wasn't hot in the middle and the cheese was not melted on the inside. When we complained, our waitress completely disregarded what we said. She also told us spaghetti and meatballs and lasagna are not made to order, which is why those two come out so fast. The one waitress we had was just terrible. Other servers had to relay our messages to her because she was no where to be found when we wanted to pay and leave. We left the entire dish there, missing just two servings (which were also half eaten) and were clearly unhappy. Yet there was no discount, no offer to get us something else on the menu, also no apology? Just shocked that a restaurant on the strip can make such terrible food, treat their customers so poorly, and still get paid in the end.

4548305,2016-11-07,4,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"When our Italian friends who own a pasta company in NJ suggested we come here for dinner, I had to trust them! And boy did this place deliver a fine evening. The food is served family style, so coming with a group of six was perfect! Here's what we shared...

Bread Basket - It featured an assortment of three different breads with olive oil and butter to go with it. Two of the breads reminded me of focaccia - one with onions and the other with tomato. These were my favorites! They were light, fluffy and moist! The last Bread was one I didn't try, but hubby sure seemed to enjoy it!

Caesar Salad - Ever since giving birth two months ago, I have constantly craved the crunch of romaine. So this salad was particularly attractive to me. The croutons were huge, but there weren't too many to be overwhelming. There was just the right amount of dressing so that everything was covered without being soggy. A plate of three anchovies were served on the side. I think our moms were the only ones to indulge in those. 

Shrimp in Red Sauce - I'm not a seafood fan at all, but I had to at least try this. The shrimp was quite firm and didn't have the unappealing fishy taste. And I really enjoyed the full sized cooked tomatoes that were in the sauce!

Veal Parmigiana - I've never had parmigiana in my life and I'm so glad I finally have! The crispy breading provided a nice texture with the melted mozzarella. I think this was the most flavorful of all the meats on the table. 

Penne with Ragu - The meatballs in the ragu were probably the next most flavorful meat. The sausage and pork were a bit more simple and took a back seat to the delicious tomato sauce. And I was crazy for the past! It was cooked perfectly and seasoned perfectly. 

What a wonderful evening of sharing with friends and family. This is such a great place for a special evening!",zQTEbn5nWGPypxOf2uRPmg,10,7,4,TjZzNgjoMDqmg-2mt3jDVw

We had Caesar salad and carbonara pasta and both were quality and delicious choices enjoyed by our entire party. 

Two items that kinda bugged me:
1. The menu is on a wall so we had to stare at it from afar and had difficulty seeing it or appeared to be starting at the adjacent table sitting under the menu. It would be nice to just have a menu for my table. 
2. I hate when a restaurant insists on making u reuse your salad fork for your dinner. Our forks were on our finished salad plates and the server took them off our salad plates and put them back on the placemat for us to reuse.

Seeing that it was family style, we were excited. So we decide to give it a try and our experience was not very good.

They start out by giving you one menu for the table and some cold bread. I wouldn't complain about cold bread, however this bread had some sort of marinara sauce on it, so it was cold crust sauce on cold bread. They also gave out odd pretzel like sticks as well. We look at the pasta dishes and decide to get the ""Ragu"", the most expensive thing on the menu. Meatballs, sausage, and pork. Sounds good! We get the dish and it gets served out...and it was just gross. WAY too much sauce, which is WAY too acidy. Trust me, I have been going to italian places since the 70's when I lived in New York. This sauce was horrible. Maybe the can they used was bad? The meatballs were just that...basic balls of meat. And the sausage was just one long sausage...not even sliced or cooked well. The pork was also weird...just salty skins of pork randomly placed in this garbage pile.

Needless to say after the 4 of us decided we were eating sh*t, we told the waitress and she immediately took our plates and the pasta away. 10 minutes later she hands us the bill, which is for the entire plate of pasta we didn't eat. What?? We ask the manager and she takes the bill in a huff....and returns with the bill with the drinks for about $12. The waitresses advice? Try not to order pasta if you don't want to eat something acidy. 

We left a $20 and left and went to Trevi for a real dinner. I'm guessing this place only survives because it is in a tourist trap and most tourists aren't looking for quality food.",FAJs9iYzh60dPZoJ6dnG2Q,0,0,1,X2syDxsqGhHYE6FhJZgrdQ

I noticed Carmine's ""Happy Hour"" sign in front of the restaurant. Happy Hour at Carmine's?  A no brainier. I went inside with shopping bags in tow. The happy hour menu is offered between 12-5 pm with several food options including a breaded eggplant ""roll"", fried calamari, Parmesan garlic bread,  steamed mussels in tomato sauce and meatball sliders. The drink offerings were one red and one white vino selection, one beer selection, margarita and martini selection. I chose the eggplant and red wine selection, which was, in my opinion, similar to a Cabernet Sauvignon, full-bodied with a peppery finish. 

My bartender was so kind, I forgot his name, and very accommodating. The bartender noticed that the server brought me the wrong order, so he immediately had him send it back to the kitchen After glimpse of the food and smelling sheer deliciousness of the ""wrong plate"", I decided I would take it since it was already prepared.

  Everything is made in house. I personally love their sauces. Fresh flavored marinara, a thick meat sauce, creamy Alfredo and one of my favorites the Marsala.
   The bread basket is fantastic, it has 4 or 5 types of bread which is extremely fresh since they bake all day. The meatballs have an old world flavor that most restaurants can't deliver. I had the veal parmigiana this week. The breading was crisp and the veal tender. 
  Carmine's has family style meals which is best enjoyed with multiple friends. However this year the staff told me they have a limited menu with smaller portions.
  I come there whenever I'm in Vegas. Make sure to make reservations. But they will do their best to fit you in when possible.  Enjoy!!",cgJftvTHr--TNkIxH7pCwg,0,0,5,etXAqsv2z0F6rwWtUdOvGw

The cheese ravioli is fantastic and so is the manicotti. But what really had me going (and I can't believe I'm writing this) was the broccoli. That isn't the typo but their broccoli was spot on and they even left roasted garlic in there which was fantastic. 

Their Salmon is also great, just keep in mind that it comes served with shellfish so you keep that in mind fi you don't eat shellfish or if you are allergic. They can make it without the clams but you have to request it in advance.

Transplanting the Carmines of NY / Atlantic City to the Vegas strip would be a challenge as so many cookie cutter type places exist and so many high end unique places open satelite places and fail.  Carmines delivers all of the expecations.

Large long bar and huge seating area adorne this Italian retro look with huge billboards showing the family styple type offerings.  After a drink with the ever pleasant Nicole at the bar we sit 9 for dinner tonight.   Bread is presented which is OK and wine list is perused.  Really a fairly weak wine list to be honest but a couple of value $50.00 Italian and Sicilian bottles are located and were off and running.  Note glasses are like my grandfather used to use and if you watch the scene in the Godfather where The Don is talkling to Michael with a heart to heart you will notice the glasses used are the same here.  Nice touch though I doubt many will remember.

Asked for some recomendations and we are offered a special Cold Antipasto and Hot Antipasto.  The cold was a mix of Italian Cold cuts / Procuitto, olives, eggplant salad, salmon on mozerrela bread etc.  This was fair nothing to write home about at $37.00. 

The Hot Antipasto was a Small Calzone, stuffed bread, stuffed mushrooms, ground sausange and brocoli Rabbe, Clams Oregenato, Mussels in red sauce, and a few other things.  This was again OK but the Mushrooms were absolutely to die for So much so that we ordered a separate platter of stuffed mushrooms, a platter of meatballs and a very good Italian Mozerella and parmagina baked bread to complete the appetizers.   all and all Meatballs, Mushrooms and bread top scores.

We take a break here to see how much more we should order as we have hit it pretty good right now but on we go.  Platter of Chicken Marsala, Platter of Veal Parm, Platter of Shrimp Fra Diablo and platter of linquini bolognese with extra side of Bolognese sauce.     Veal Parm a near perfect 10... Delicious, chicken Marsala good but not my favorite, the Shrimp were absolutely incredible clean tasty perfectly cooked while the hot sauce was just the right amount of spicy and declicious as well.  Didn't need the 3bls of pasta in Red Sunday Bolognese Gravy but have to say it was dam outstanding. 

NO coffee or deserts tried as we can't walk at this time but 9 guys 4 bottles of wine tax and Tip (Not included automatically) we walked out for $630.00   As far as I'm concerened a tremendous value and really for the most part tremendous presentations and food and taste.

We visited Carmine's on Mother's Day to treat my Mother In Law to a nice late lunch at one of her favorite Italian restaurants.  She's from the NYC area but recently relocated to Las Vegas.  She's dined at the original Carmine's in NYC probably 100's of times over the years. 
We were greeted and seated promptly.  The server, Antonel came over and asked if we would like to get drinks started, we felt a little rushed but brushed it off.  We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and water for the table.  We placed our order, starting with the fried zucchini as our appetizer.  We also ordered a chicken parmigiana, veal parmigiana and a penne with bolognese.  Their portion are huge and served family style, which we knew before ordering.  We were looking forward to leftovers.  After 15 or so minutes our entrees came out.  We asked the food runner where our appetizer was so he took the entrees back and asked.  Antonel, our server came back and told us they were out or zucchini today.  When we asked her why she didn't tell us before firing the entrees she said she forgot.  Her entire attitude changed, like we were a bother.  We wanted an appetizer and specifically asked her if the entrees went back would the kitchen remake them or were they just going to sit back there.  She said oh no, they'll remake them.  Fast forward to when the entrees came back out and sure enough the kitchen piled a ton of cheese on the chicken and veal, threw them under the salamander and sent them back out, DISGUSTING!  When we asked to speak with the manager he tried to cover saying it was against health code blah blah blah but there was no way to get around what they did, literally a pound of melted/old cheese. They re-fired our entrees and they came out as they should have the first time.  It's not a cheap place to eat and some people I'm sure save for long periods of time to be able to afford those prices.  When you choose to dine in a restaurant like this you except great service!

Before deciding to eat here, understand that you are going to spend at least $35/dish.  All of the dishes are family-style, meaning that the portions are large.

Also, if you are going as a group of guys, plan on getting 1 entree for 2 people.  If you are going with women, typically a single entree can feed 4 people.  Thus, with a mix of people in your group, plan for 3 people per entree.  The restaurant will tell you otherwise, but you will be hungry if you don't plan accordingly.

I ate the rest of the eggplant over a few days and froze the rest for another time. 

I can't wait to have visitors again so we can go eat here.. again!  Makes me miss NY even more but I'm glad I can at least hit up Carmine's when I want real Italian food.  

Our bill was close to $400 and we had ordered a bottle of wine, the rest of us had regular drinks.  We probably could have gotten away with 1 less dish and been fine.",uQcITIhiQB1mwUXQZuEamQ,2,1,5,9y6Sxa5f6FuBRZ2FXxLb8Q

We had their spaghetti and meatballs last time which was a hit as well. For dessert, cannoli's. Wow is all I can say. The only negative I can see about this place is the seating.

This place is BIG so for the most part you won't have to wait for a table. At first no one came by to ask for drinks or anything so I got up and asked the bartender to order our drinks. When he came by with our drinks he also took our order.

APEROL FIZZ ($7) - surprisingly very good! I didn't know what this drink was but just took a shot in the dark and I really liked it. It has a slight carbonation and it was a refreshing drink.

MUSSELS IN RED SAUCE ($9) - a very visually appealing dish. The mussels were good and I liked the sauce that they were in.

GARLIC BREAD PARM ($6) - admittedly not the most visually appealing dish but the garlic bread was delicious and I really liked the melted part on top. Girlfriend wasn't a fan of the cheese so she took it off but we agreed the garlic bread was really good.

FRIED CALAMARI ($11) - my favorite of the dishes. The calamari was very good but I was a huge fan of the dipping sauce. You could tell that it was homemade and it had a ton of flavor. 

They have a ton of pasta options that were served in big portions and sounded delicious but unfortunately were not part of the happy hour menu. I do want to come back and try some of them though.",_jqTa-3-fqmBxnkANJHtFw,0,0,4,9OoImonMpT7e-zYEkTURgg

Unlike most restaurants, Carmine's serves food family style so each dish is a huge portion that can serve multiple people. There were 11 of us and we had for appetizers: salad, wings, and calamari. For dinner we had, the stuffed fish special, veal, pasta bolognese, pasta alla vodka.

All of the food was absolutely fantastic and we were beyond stuffed at the end (and even had leftovers). If you are a lover of garlic this is the place for you, they use a healthy amount in each dish. I would recommend the wings for an appetizer. They are garlicky and delicious. If you are going to choose any entree, it must be the bolognese. It was one of the best I have had and is quite filling.

The sticker shock of each dish can seem daunting but if ordering as a group, you can most likely get away spending less per person than most restaurants in Vegas due to the portion size.

I was most surprised by the garlic and oil linguine. You would think that the pasta would be very light or plain in flavor, but it wasn't. Quite the opposite. It was incredibly flavorful without the heaviness of say a cream sauce. 

Also,  I never order chicken dishes when I'm out for some reason. Especially dishes with chicken breast, mostly because I've never found a dish that I've liked, that wasn't bland or tough or just uninteresting with some sauce slopped on it. The chicken scaloppine was so tender, with the most delicious creamy, lemon butter sauce that had a refreshing delightful flavor.

My husband and I went to Vegas because I had a seminar in the Wynn for Labor Day weekend. It happened to be my birthday on the Sunday, so he took me to the Mariah Carey show at Caesar's Palace. Afterwords, we decided to go here for my birthday dinner since it was in the same hotel. I made reservations on OpenTable. My poor husband is in a wheelchair because of a broken foot, and this made it more convenient since we didn't have to venture far from the concert.
We arrived, and the restaurant wasn't busy at all. We checked in via our OpenTable reservation, and I asked if we could have a nice table since it was my birthday and we were celebrating. The two hostesses rolled their eyes and didn't even say ""Happy Birthday"" or ""Welcome!"".One of them just took us to our table, which was a tiny table in the middle of the restaurant. Mind you, this could have been their WORST table, and it was really difficult for my husband to maneuver around in a wheelchair and then sit in a cramped table with his foot in a huge case. I saw that there were three booths next to the table, with one of them being open, and asked if we could sit there. The hostess said ""No, sorry. There is no server for that section"" and walked away. My husband and I looked at each other, a little puzzled. I walked back to the front of the restaurant and asked the same hostess and the other hostess if we could please sit in the booth, especially since it would be a lot more comfortable for my disabled husband. She huffed and puffed and said she would ask her manager. I watched her walk a circle around the restaurant, but never asked anyone anything or spoke to anyone, and then walked back up to us and said ""Okay it's fine, but just to let you know, it might take about 20 min for a server to come to your table or take your order"". I said it was fine, and honestly I was at the point of laughing because she was behaving so ridiculously, and because I was in a good mood because it was my birthday and we just saw Mariah Carey.
Again, this girl was full of s*** because a server immediately came to our table and brought us water and took our order. The server was a little robotic and cold to us at first, but he ended up being nice. He forgot to bring our bread basket, but made up for it by sending us home with some. The food was good, but the prices were very, very steep. $30 for a salad? If they made the portions a tiny bit smaller and the prices a tiny bit lower it would be better.
A couple days later, I checked my OpenTable account and it said that the restaurant had CANCELED my reservation that night 15 min after we had been seated, which means I didn't get my OpenTable points. I was FURIOUS! Obviously that hostess didn't like that I questioned her choice of seat for us, and decided to retaliate by manually cancelling my reservation. What a miserable human being that would treat someone like that on their birthday! I called the restaurant, and spoke with the manager, Keely. She looked into it and said that ""it looks like there was some confusion; the hostess said you may have not told them about the reservation so they cancelled it"". BS. I told them twice! Trust me, I always want to make sure I get my OpenTable points. Keely ended up giving me the points, but did I really need to go through that trouble?",4j0l_xYMe22cfn4nTirC9Q,2,1,1,rfnxuOmcjDeDBhI7QEq0VQ

5256025,2013-12-11,1,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Well, it's not the Carmines in New York, but it's pretty darn close. Like many New York, LA or celebrity owned restaurants in other cities, when they come into Las Vegas, sure it's the same menu they usually even look somewhat similar but there is just that ""it"" factor, that vibe, that's missing. One part is maybe even just the staff. When you're at Carmines in New York all of the staff has that New York attitude that is just so amazing and fun. One things that did make me really feel like I was in New York, was the fact that Carmine's is inside the Caesars Forum so there are no views of palm trees or the desert to be had. The other thing is that the place was decorated for Christmas, there's just something about Christmas in New York that is very special and inviting. 
 
So if you are wondering around Caesars looking for somewhere to eat or craving some good ol' New York style Italian food, I highly recommend popping in to Carmines.

Opened in the Forum Shops at Caesars' by Artie Cutler and the team behind two New York City locations, one in Atlantic City, DC and even the Bahamas, Carmine's is cut from the same Southern-Italy-by-way-of-NYC cloth as chains such as Bucca di Beppo or Maggiano's Little Italy, yet by doing 'the little things' right the experience is upgraded at least two-fold while still maintaining its customer-friendly prices.

Assuredly a tourist gathering point, though a fair share of locals have been heard to say they enjoyed their visits, Carmine's Las Vegas location opened in Summer of 2013 and closing in on three years with Chef Michael Ingino involved since doors opened the very concept of a ""scratch kitchen"" feeding a room that seats up to eight hundred from 11:00AM to 11:00PM weekdays (and till Midnight on weekends) may seem exhausting, but in reality the attitude of everyone in the place remains not only pleasant but downright exuberant.

Currently managed by Anthony Esparza, a pleasant man whose enthusiasm for a big job seems contagious to his staff, it was as part of a party of four that seats were taken under one of the colossal menus mounted amidst black & white photos not dissimilar to any number of Italian-American restaurants and with portions as outsized as the restaurant's character the phrase ""Family Style"" rings true from the onset, our waiter warning that each plate was meant to serve anywhere from ""two to four"" guests.

Skipping the grandeur of a place like Carbone, casting aside stereotyped Italian phrases and an absurd check in favor of a sort of ""Sunday at Grandma's"" vibe, feasting at Carmine's commences with an ample Bread Basket likely to tempt all but the most carbohydrate conscious and with Sinatra, Dean and Sammy playing overhead in not-too-loud fashion the question of where best to begin is a daunting one, the fact that nearly everything but Pasta and imported Charcuterie is made on-site further complicating the decision.

Acknowledging from the start that over-ordering at Carmine's is a virtual guarantee, ""two to four"" better translated as ""four or more,"" it was to a large platter of Antipasti that the table was soon treated and although the phrase ""something for everyone"" is often a dicey proposition it would be difficult to call the smorgasbord anything less as everything from simple meats and cheese to a complex seafood salad are presented elegantly with a price not dissimilar to what such a spread would cost from Whole Foods Market.

Told that the Spicy Scarpariello Wings were something crave-worthy, two dozen plump pieces of Chicken cooked crisp before a bath in vibrant sauce teaming with garlic, lemon and peppers, suffice it t say that the housemade Blue Cheese Dressing alone would make this plate worth ordering instead of lesser versions at the local Sports Bar, a followup of Lasagna and Eggplant Ptarmigan showing the former to not be quite as crisp as one might hope across the top while the 9-layered latter outperforms any other version in town by a significant degree as each hand-sliced and stacked piece is baked soft without turning mushy around what could easily be a pound or more of Tomato Sauce and Mozzarella Cheese.

Joking with the server about his description of Strawberry Shortcake, the desserts all tempting but that one sounding particularly odd when accidentally described as being served on Rye, it was in good humor that the actual dish was served complimentary alongside a block of Cinnamon and Chocolate Bread with fresh Whipped Cream and three filled-to-order Cannolis, the Bread Pudding actually almost *too*dense at the end of such a meal while Marble Cake beneath Cream and Strawberries was soft and light, the citrus-tinged Mascarpone filling each Chocolate-dipped Shell equally convincing of Carmine's commitment to quality.

**** Accounting for the fact that Carmine's is positioned to compete for the 'average' tourist dollars and not those looking for an 'event' meal or fine dining there is little doubt that what Michael, Anthony and their team is doing at Carmine's goes a step beyond to make the overall experience a worthwhile outing, and one that tourists as well as locals may equally be likely to enjoy.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,4,4,ke3tMkEqOns7GvL4d3YFSw

My wife ordered for us; the seafood with angel hair and white sauce.  It came out looking delicious!  Lobster, mussels, clams, calamari, shrimp...  all over cooked!

It started with the calamari tasting like a rubberband soaked in chum.  

Next, I had to saw into the shrimp to cut it in half, to taste the crunch that should be reserved for a Snyder's pretzel, and the vein jamming between molars.

After my wife saw my face chewing like it's cud, she thought to try the lobster... she popped out a dry chewy piece of shredded meat and didn't bother with any more.  

I shouldn't need to explain how awful the clams were after the rest of the mess, but I tried a mussel after all this.  For the first time as an adult, I spit partially chewed food onto my plate.

The mussel had the consistency of a sand soaked wash cloth.  I've had gritty seafood before, but someone must've rolled this thing in desert soil right before serving it.  I haven't wanted for a piece of floss like this since $2 steak at Chuck o Rama.

To be fair; they did not make us pay for this atrocity, we did not eat it either, and my appetite was shot.  (Our server did apologize several times and offer us something else)

I haven't felt this close to food poisoned in 20 years and over 100 visits to Vegas.

They make their lemonade fresh to order: strawberry or blueberry. They use real fruits...but refills aren't free. I personally love their strawberry lemonade because it's real tart...so refreshingly good. Since we're a small family (with a big appetite) we got the chicken scarpariello, manicotti...and the Titanic for dessert. Great bread service...combine olive oil, balsamic vinegar and Parmesan as a dip.

Chicken Scarpariello:
Chicken in lemon butter and rosemary sauce. The meat is tender, juicy and perfectly cooked. The skin is light brown and crispy. Even the breast (normally the driest part of a chicken) was juicy. The sauce was delicious. 5/5 

Manicotti:
Pasta filled with ricotta. Tomato sauce was thick and tangy. 3.5/5

Titanic:
Chocolate torta, gelato, ganache, whipped cream, pineapple, strawberry and hazelnuts. One of the best desserts I've had recently. It's a combination of their chocolate torta and gelato. Think banana split but waaaay better. This dessert (just like all of their desserts) is huuuuge. It would take 4 people to take down this behemoth. The ganache is what makes this so good. Everyone that would pass by our table would stop and admire this beauty. 5/5

Our server forced us to take our leftover dessert home. ""Just freeze it and it would still be good"". It looks like a mess now but it's still delicious! Service is a little slower here and our food took a long time.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,9,6,4,JV_fTyVKuUVnkK9Wx5KZyQ

5343349,2018-06-09,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"My husband and I recently got married at Caesars Palace and we decided to have our reception at Carmines.  This was one of the best decisions we made on multiple levels.
1) We were lucky enough to work with Cassy, the events manager at Carmines.  From the very first encounter with Cassy when she walked us around the venue to her accommodating the ten extra people that ended up joining us for our tasting at a different date to ensuring that everything was exactly as we asked for, she was the consummate professional.  In addition, her candor and the rapport she made with us was much appreciated.  I felt like I was working with a friend and she shared in the joy of our special day while making sure every detail was met.
2) The food.  Oh my, the food.  We had a whole table of hot and cold appetizers.  Everything was delicious and exactly as it was when we had it at our tasting.  The three pastas we chose were a total hit with the guests.  Cassy gave excellent advice about which pastas would hold up in the warmers and she couldn't have been more accurate.  
3)  The staff that was on the floor was incredible.  We had servers that ensured the food amounts were always full and replenished quickly.  We had to do a last minute two-top table for my husband and I (we forgot to ask for it in our original plan) and they were able to accommodate us immediately and without an issue.  We had two bartenders that were spot-on and worked their tails off to ensure our guests didn't go thirsty.

I passed by this carmine's expecting the carbonara and initially the employees greeting everyone said they had it.

How disappointing.. I almost wanted to leave but I know it's a good restaurant anyways and I tried the pene al vodka which was very good. Not a carbonara but very good nonetheless. 

Something to note are the family size portions that they serve so don't be too alarmed when you see $35 for a plate. It's large enough for 3 people or 4 even depending on how much everyone eats.

We ordered the Caesar salad, antipasto, fillet mignon , 2 pasta dishes and desert. The fillet mignon dish was the Thursday night special. This dish was spectacular - the meat melted in your mouth, the flavor had me thinking that I've been cooking beef the wrong way and veggies on the platter were cooked as though they just came out of the ground and put straight into the sauté pan. 

My recommendation is to go with a large group because it truly is family style dining. We had 8 adults and 2 kids, and we still went home with 20lbs of leftovers.",nq8s9JADXPJBvINdvKG6jg,0,0,5,Ubev3JKJnsQcWnRqK3QOFg

He gives it to one of them and she enters the wrong #, he corrects her and she enters it wrong three more times because of her ridiculous fake nails. No apologies just a ""we'll text ya"" We wait 30 min without a text and watch 3 other groups get seated immediately. We approach the stand and see that there are 3 empty tables.

Dinner suggestions popped up, but options got slimmer when a companion meeting us was sporting a Randy ""Macho Man"" Savage t-shirt.  Giada was undoubtedly out of the question.  Carmine's welcomed us with open arms.  

My jaw dropped as the hostess walked us to our table.  I gawked and commented out loud to no one in particular on the enormous portions at other tables.  Yeah, it's family style, but who's family??  The Brady Brunch with Alice?  Joey Chestnut's family???  The Klumps????  Monstrous plates of pasta were everywhere!!

The spicy wings were a fantastic appetizer.  $32 got us 24 wings, sliced fennel as opposed to celery, and their homemade bleu cheese dip.  Carmine's isn't a typical place to order wings, but these were some of the best I've had in recent memory.  The tomato based sauce had nice spicy kick and went so well with the thick dip.  The fennel grew on me bite after bite as it kind of worked as a palette cleanser.     

Then all the main entrees came out.  Good god!!  The chicken parmigiana had ton of cheese on top and managed not to be dry despite being hammered super thin.  Ragu with meatballs was suggested by our server and he didn't steer us wrong.  I overheard someone else say the meatballs were ""tender as fuck"".  I agreed.  

The main event was the ""Four Pasta Special"" which is only available Sundays.  If you have a chance to check out my picture, just look at how small the server's hand/wrist looks compared to the dish.  It looks like a child brought this dish over!  We barely made a dent in it.  I enjoyed lasagna and gnocchi the most.

My wife and I could never eat here by ourselves unless I cleared my car trunk out to make room for the leftovers.  The ones I did have on this particular evening came in a large aluminum buffet pan (no joke) and weighed at least 5 pounds.

I have also have come to learn that the Chicago Carmine's has no relation to either of these which may be the reason I don't seem to care of Carmine's in Chicago... yet I digress. Carmine's Las Vegas can be best described by three words: large, hearty, Italian.

We ended up here with a huge group of friends a couple months back when in Las Vegas and of course did everything family style. They serve all the Italian classics you can possibly dream of and are not shy at all with the portions. My favorite was the rigatoni! Their red sauce has that nice deep and rich flavor to it. Yums!

Anyways, would highly recommend making reservations ahead of time as it does seem to be quite the popular spot. No issues with the service here. Very prompt to grab you another drink and refill your waters, which is always appreciated when you find yourself drinking on and off the entire weekend in Vegas. I'll have to say its definitely a bit on the pricier side of the spectrum, but with the large portions you'll definitely have leftovers to take home.

Calamari: The best dish of the night. 

Carmine's Salad: Don't waste your money on this. The salad tasted bitter.

It took over an hour to come out and it looks like a lot of meat but in actuality they stuff the plate with a lot of potatoes and layer the beef on top. It was dry and unsatisfying.

Knowing that we are going to need some left over we decided to get two pasta dishes.  We got the ragu with the three types of meat and this other vegetarian one.

It falls apart easily as you're cutting it and it's nearly impossible to serve without dropping back into the plate or onto the table. 

These things combined with the fact of the lasagna is very bland and has almost no original taste of it's own. It seems it inherently flavor from the sauce surrounding it.

I have always wanted to try Carmine's when I have been to NYC, but for some reason (probably the extremely long wait for a table), have never been. Since a lot of iconic NY eateries have made their mark on Vegas though, I have been able to try some of these hard-to-get spots, including Carmine's. We started with a delicious green salad, ordered from the ""bar"" menu at the suggestion of our server, as that size is a bit smaller and more appropriate for a duo like my husband and I. I ordered a delicious drink that I would love to replicate at home - it had lime, lemon juice, and blood orange, but was amazingly fresh and crisp! Our main was the chicken parmesan, which was delicious, cheesy, and crunchy. You order the pasta separately for around $12 to complete the meal and I would say you need it - the tomato sauce the meal comes with is super fresh and simple, the way I like it. The bread served here was pretty good, too. I was a fan of the awesome tomato focaccia bread, yum! Too bad we were stuffed, otherwise the dessert menu here looks really good.

Symptoms ranging from migraine, severe stomach cramping, diarrhea and vomit ting. Called the manager in the morning and he said he's been a restaurant manager for 20 years and ""If this was from the actual food being bad, the symptoms would show up in about 24 hours, when its immediate like in this case, its from someone not washing their hands"".  He asked to call everyone in our party to check on them...never did.  Did not offer to reimburse or compensate in any way.  Manager was supposed to call back, NEVER DID.  After 3 hostile messages left, he finally called back.  He said ""how did he know that our group didn't eat somewhere together before Carmine's?  How did he know it came from his restaurant?  Did anyone go to the doctor to prove they were sick?""  We met at Carmines for our friends 25 year wedding anniversary and the guest of honor had to emergency stop on the way home to blow up and spent the rest of the night running to the toilet.  The manager went on about how the restaurant is new..etc..etc..finally after aggressively reasoning with this poor excuse of a manager, he agreed to refund the dinner.

Started out with the Caesar salad which was so big it was falling off of the plate. Because we were so stuffed from that and the basket of bread served beforehand, we only ordered one entree. The chicken Parmesan arrived and it seemed to overflow from the plate. The dish was crispy, and dripping with cheese and sauce.

Everything was seasoned well and delicious. My only complaints, and I am digging for them are the water cups are super tiny, so you're constantly refilling...and because it's crowded, it can be quite noisy. Like I said, I am digging for things to complain about. And a bonus feature is the restaurant has its own bathroom, so you do not have to venture outside to find it.

""The dishes are big!"" And the waiter was not just talking about the porcelain! This is definitely a place to take a large group of people who enjoy sharing and don't mind not getting their own dishes. 

Carmine's boast their traditional Italian home cooking style- think big families around a table. I would say it's most optimal for a party of 6 or more. 

I went with a party of 5 and we got 1 appetizer and 2 main dishes. Luckily my cousin lives in Vegas so she took the leftovers home or otherwise it would have been a waste since I don't want to take it back to the hotel room. 

We had the fried zucchini appetizer which really good. It comes as a foot-tall mound of fried zucchini strings. Makes everyone's eyes pop out by the sight of it. The.

5823984,2014-07-03,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"I used to love Carmine's in NYC.  As a college student, and an Italian, it was a treat eating at Carmine's in the City.  The portions were HUGE and the food was delicious.  However, going to Carmine's in Las Vegas was not the Carmine's I remember.  We ordered a few appetizers.  The stuffed mushrooms were probably 4 stars, while the mozzarella and tomatoes were at 3.

For entrees we ordered Penne alla Vodka (4 stars), Angel Hair and shrimp (2 stars), and Chicken Parm (3 stars).  The Penne was al dente and the sauce was good.  That is the only dish I would recommended. I love all parm dishes (chicken parm, veal parm, eggplant parm).  However, this one was OK. The chicken was tender, but the cheese was not melted throughout the piece of chicken.  While the edges were nicely melted, the center of the pieces still had unmelted cheese. 

With so many restaurants in Vegas, I don't know if I'll be back to Carmine's.  For italian food, there are def better choices.",n4ZBxNksdzcFhAopOusZnQ,1,1,3,ukpuhj06DsQD5s2Y_dRpjA
5837389,2018-05-14,12,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"As I pondered what I really wanted for dinner out after Diane would return from playing poker, I pretty quickly decided that it had to be ""Sausage & Peppers"".  Putting in that search term on Yelp, I looked for where I could find a great rendition of this Italian staple.  And the best reviewed dish seemed to be at Carmine's, where I recalled I had enjoyed this once before.  A color photo of this entree, which happened to include onions as well, sealed the deal for me.  So when Diane returned, off we went to the Strip on a busy Friday night for me to satisfy my craving.  Even though Carmine's serves platters family style, neither Diane nor I cared what the cost or overage would be.  We could always bring home leftovers.

After finally reaching valet parking at Caesar's Colosseum, we strolled on over to Carmine's inside the Forum Shops, and secured a table for two at 10:15 p.m.  The place at this late hour was still 2/3 full.  Supplied with a table for four looking right onto the mall walkway, we were ready to get down to some serious eating.  And so we did.

To get things started I ordered a Caesar Salad, which arrived with enough Romaine Lettuce to feed six diners.  At our server's suggestion, I ordered it with light dressing, and extra dressing on the side, so leftover salad would not get too soggy.  But, alas, the extra dressing was not forthcoming.  So, I had to ask for it again, meanwhile masticating very thinly dressed leaves and a few croutons.  Finally the extra dressing arrived.  It was thick and viscous, and when ladled on the great expanse of lettuce leaves made all the difference in taste.  Strips of Mozzarella Cheese and an ample supply of nicely seasoned croutons in cube shape also contributed to an authentic and well-flavored Caesar Salad.

When ordering my entree of Sausage, Peppers & Onions, I sought to augment it with still more ingredients.  First were Roasted Potatoes, but this was changed to a side of Contadina Potatoes when Diane decided that she wanted them to go with her Veal Marsala without mushrooms, too.  Then I imagined the Red and Green Roasted Peppers mixing with Penne.  So an order for Penne was placed.  When separate platters of Sausage, Onions, & Peppers; Contadina Potatoes; and Penne arrived and were conjoined by me, I decided that something was still missing to meld everything well together.  I tried to put my finger on the absent ingredient, and soon came up with the solution.  It was Marinara Sauce!

So I asked an attentive busboy for some Marinara Sauce.  He said he would check with our server to see if an extra charge applied, and I replied, ""It doesn't matter.  Just bring it.""  (Ultimately I was not charged for this.)  When a hot bowl of wonderful mild Marinara Sauce soon arrived and was mixed with the Sausage, well-roasted Green and Red Peppers, nicely sweated White Onions, and memorable Roasted Potatoes, it was just the thing to make my entree whole.  An hour later I had consumed half of the platter of salad, and a little over half of the Sausage, Peppers, & Onions; while Diane was able to polish off five of seven scallops of veal overlaid with delectable Marsala Sauce.  Together we also ate most of the Penne, and consumed all of the potatoes.  I gladly paid a bill of over $150 for two, and didn't mind.  For, all of the food obtained would have comfortably served six, and I finished off a quarter more of the salad and all the rest of the Sausage, Onions, & Peppers at next day's lunch. 

While the hostess and managers were friendly, and our busboy fairly attentive, our sever was not.  Besides forgetting to bring the extra salad dressing, he only asked if I wanted any more Iced Tea once, just as I was looking around to request that of him late in the meal.  So I was only furnished with two Iced Teas in the space of 90 minutes.  And then after asking our waiter if he could box up the unused Caesar Dressing to go with the salad, he said, ""Sure!""  But when we arrived home, no such dressing was in our to go bag.  He also had a habit of referring to me repeatedly as ""Buddy"" when I am silver haired and likely more than twice his age, which I thought was not very professional or appropriate.

So, while the food was again five-star worthy in quality and taste, the inattentive wait-service this time lost a star.  What was promised was not always delivered.  I will still return, because the service was exemplary the other two times I have dined here, and the cooking here is first-rate.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,16,17,4,LNMN-BS_4ucdhXHhkbNawA

We're from the NYC area and my boyfriend loves Carmine's. always talks about it. But I had never tried it, so we finally did yesterday in Vegas and it was amazing. I mean the decor was very neat. I'm a total food, wine, hospitality junkie and I had never seen a wine rack so tall! The photos on the walls were authentic and really told a story about the place. We were greeted by a nicely dressed host who welcomed us with a warm smile and brought us over to our table. A few moments later, our waiter Frank introduced himself. He had a ton of knowledge and answered every question we had about the mouth watering menu. Frank was the ideal waiter to have, at my first time at Carmine's. we were lucky to have gotten there a little bit after lunch time because we were able to  order from the lunch menu, which had smaller portions, which were still big! We ended up getting garlic bread, half with cheese. Which I thought was cool. Most places don't offer you the option. And then we shared a lunch size Penne Ala Vodka. And we still had left overs!!! Perfect Italian cooked pasta. None of that over cooked mushy shit. The food was excellent. The place was organized and beautiful. The bathrooms were clean. And the service was awesome. Our waiter was friendly and fun to talk to! Although he did tell us he was a Raiders fan. Ha ha. Recommending Carmine's to everyone I know! I also can't wait to dine at the NYC and DC locations!

5850616,2016-05-01,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"We had seen Carmine's during our recent shopping trip to The Forum Shops at Caesar's Palace and decided to give it a try for dinner prior to attending the April 30 Elton John concert. The ambience is casual and New York Italian (as am I) with a lot of energy in the air. It was prom night so there were several groups of prom goers who as an aside looked great all decked out.
To say Carmine's serves ""family style"" is a little misleading unless you come from a large family. The portions are huge. Our waiter advised my wife and I to stick to a single entrée and order it over pasta (for $12 upcharge) rather than ordering a separate pasta dish for twice the price. We took his advice and had the chicken parmesan over spaghetti and really enjoyed it.One note, Carmine's has a Food Valet service, at no charge, which was a new term for me but what they do is box up your leftovers, keep them in a refrigerator and deliver it to you when you check back in at their front desk when you return after whatever you're doing after dinner. We tried it out and it worked perfectly so tonight is a repeat of last night's dinner.
The couple next to us ordered a Caesar's salad which looked to be 1 1/2 heads of Romaine lettuce. They each had two or three dishes worth of salad and hadn't made a dent in it so after repeated offers by them I tried the salad. It was quite good; stronger on the anchovy taste than garlic but really pretty mild. I saw their spaghetti and meatballs which like everything else was huge. Given portion sizes the prices at Carmine's are very reasonable; cheap by The Strip restaurant standards.
The service was excellent and everything we tried tasted very good. I will definitely return but I'd like to have two other couples with us so we can try a couple more entrees. Three couple with three entrees will mean leftovers for all.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,0,0,5,zzT5PNY2IwVpf_5KOXFs0Q

We arrived a few minutes a head of our guest and we ordered a class of wine.  The waiter brought the wine and left it.  He did not offer to pour the first glass he just dropped it and left. 

The first time we visited this restaurant we ordered the pasta on the side and it wasn't a problem, this time it was.  The waiter insisted that we have the parigiana placed on top of the pasta.  So we did.  No biggie just didn't want it that way.

What made the dinner excellent was the outstanding service we received from Frank, the tall waiter from New York City.  He helped us with recommendations and genuinely cared that everything went well.  Frank made us feel like VIPs.  The assistant servers were on-point too.  The manager dropped by to make sure we were OK and the hostess was personable. We had the Rigatoni Country Style and Chicken Parmesan.  With our family of 4, we had leftovers too.  We are glad we chose Carmine's at the Forum.",Thcf5O4wgCSthWAFLOYqZQ,0,0,5,7PGbxkdmsaurxpz2iFlPSg

My wife and I went together and even requesting half orders were more then two can eat. It's primary focus is family style and large groups.  That said I'll be going back no matter what!  Caesar salad was one of the best ever and the pasta was simply perfect.  
They said if you eat at the bar you can get a menu more designed for two people.",KVVc5PpKtmuR1-6dA5dFnQ,0,0,5,bLkFoBkdhfFzLX11CWTmrg
5975117,2016-02-03,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Horrible experience. Groups SHOULD NOT COME HERE! We were in Vegas from out of town. Made reservations for a large group, celebrating my aunts bday. I've never been to a restaurant that doesn't have food menus but had drink menus instead?! 

To order our food, we had to take a picture of the menu board on my phone. Then go back to the table to order. Most plates on the menu averaged between $20-$30 which I was ok with since the servings were big. I normally ask waiters for suggestions at new places. The waiter, (not friendly) tall Hispanic guy with black glasses, suggested a seafood plate bc it was great (according to him). I took his word for it. At the time of the bill, that dish was $70!!!!!!! After reviewing the ""menu board"" I had taken a picture of on my phone, that dish was not on the menu!! What was supposed to be a nice dinner turned out to be a horrible one instead. I felt mislead by the waiter. Why would he suggest something that wasn't on the menu or even mention the price? If I had had a menu on my hands like you would at most restaurants, I wouldn't have ordered that dish. I felt he was trying to add to the bill to increase his tip percentage. Not only that, but the seafood made me sick with food poisoning. 

I will never recommend this place to anyone. I did tell all my close friends about the bad experience I had and now I'm sharing it on yelp to warn others who plan to have group dinners here. Worst experience, bad food and I didn't appreciate getting screwed over by the waiter. They need to have menus like all other restaurants do. Only reason I'm giving them one star, is simply bc I have to.",ytehOcY13zl7Ovl69oV8QQ,2,0,1,CubLw1Nz6O4KNcX8eyaXXA
5976316,2014-03-03,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Cut one star for the huge sizes. Have you seen any reviews without the word huge? Food is so good and if you cannot take leftovers you really feel guilty to leave behind such a good quality and taste, not to mention the waste. 

We were two people and warned in advance to chose the same meal. Meat balls we still talk about how tasty they were. Salad is also fresh and can feed a table of 6-8 easily. 

Why not some consideration for smaller portions?",8qf2j0AZLw0T4KgdGIKZBQ,0,0,4,g7BmMjZIyTdqU6ZPSAg5vA
5978659,2014-12-22,1,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Came here for dinner last night with my family for my husbands birthday . Usually service is great and I leave impressed . Unfortunately a football game was on while we were dining. So we didn't get the usual attention . Our order was wrong and while we asked for food to be packed our servers response was "" that doesn't travel well"" well we are actually local so we have a fridge at home . The icing on the cake was when the server asked if we wanted dessert . We said no thank you to which he responded with "" we have a birthday dessert for you "" with that being said who turns down free dessert . $329 later that dessert was $30 . Which I probably would have not gotten being my husband prefers the strawberry shortcake . Lesson learned Carmine's , to not come in with football is playing because then your employees would have to work . Thanks to our server for making sure we would probably go to Rao's spend the extra money but it would be worth it .",ffArFIQxlyLO_5efRgHhjQ,1,1,1,oftcAUuwV5BYFwbZtLdyUw
5988668,2018-04-07,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,Went here for a birthday celebration. We had a private dining room which was awesome. It was at the back of the restaurant very secluded. Our waitress was good. She made sure we had drinks and that our plates were cleared in a timely manner. It was a set menu and the portions were huge but it's known for being a family style type of place. The dessert was absolutely amazing and the presentation was beautiful. Carmine's made the birthday very special. Thank you!,avwakFdic31dI9fMRpMusg,0,0,5,qvJPvsqXo4MRleiF-OTDlw

5996364,2017-05-04,0,pik4ebdFa0UcUhnNkivFcg,"Came here one night for dinner with friends and my husband. I really love how it was very convenient and inside of the forum shops in the Caesars Palace and how generous their portions were. I myself am not a very big eater but we had a party of 7 and even had a little food to take home. The menu was a giant menu on their wall which was super cool since it was my first time ever seeing that in a restaurant. I thought that the prices were fair for the amount served. We chose 5 dishes all together and the food was good. Some dishes I didn't enjoy as much but other dishes I wanted to keep eating. We ordered the Caesar salad to start, spicy scarpariello wings, penned alla vodka, shrimp scampi, and the carbonara. My favorite was the carbonara and the wings!",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,0,0,4,eF_-FvELOiufjSQC3wVn2Q
