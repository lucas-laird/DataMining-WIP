Both times the food was packaged poorly that the bag that it came with is dripping and the food with the sauce or stew in it is basically all gone. Who puts food with a saucey stew in a carton box instead of a plastic container? This cheap business does. 

For what they charge the portions are small. I had their fried rice and it was bland and definitely not Chinese authentic. I can cook better. I had their shrimp chow mein and I can almost swear Panda Express' awful chow mein is better. I am up for giving a Chinese restaurant a 2nd chance. The 2nd time I had their ""New York chow mein"" but it wasnt very New York and it wasnt good. Basically it dripped all over the bag into other food because this business doesnt have any pride or consideration in their packaging or food for that matter.

We had to drive through some sketchy neighbourhoods to get there, but the food was GREAT!

The service was rapid and friendly, and I was glad to hear that there are other stores (so that I won't fear getting mugged if I had to drive to there again). Don't get me wrong the shopping complex that it was located in was clean and newer but the 2 mile drive to the freeway was not a part of the ""Fabulous Las Vegas"" that most people ever see, or would want to.

I've lived in some rough neighbourhoods In my life...Fresno, Long Beach, Oxnard but I was too naive to understand how dangerous those places really were.  If driving through the ghetto doesn't scare you then check it out.

Please be aware that they are not all as good as the others.  I took friends to another one and the food was just okay.

Just saw that I never finished this review from July of 2011.  Please note that the review was from over a year ago so it may not reflect the current status of the food's quality.",DoGrik5ZzuQIDYx46Mwzzw,1,0,4,elo-6BXKJVyGuBwtfV8dDg
727195,2016-05-23,0,xjlMlnxWqMd3FGODA_z1NA,"I've been going to this China a go go for a few years, regularly. Usually at least once a week for fine in, take out, and delivery. The food has always been great, with good value, and that is why I've been a regular. After my experience last night, i believe I will find another place to eat Chinese close to home. The hours on the door and Yelp indicate they close at 9:30p.  Last night, we showed up at 8:56pm, so we should have been good. We were met at the door and said they were closing and weren't going to let us in unless it was for a take out order. After telling Ray, who seems to be in charge, that we still had over a half hour before they close, he let us in to order. As always, the food was great and quick to get to our table. Close to when we were done eating our meal, it started to smell like very strong chemicals. We looked over and they were doing heavy duty cleaning on the wok area. We were starting to choke on the smell of chemicals, so we decided to leave. One of the female servers had her face covered so she could breathe better too. As we were walking out the door, about 9:20, I decided to go talk to Ray. I asked if he was the manager, he said no. I asked who was in charge, she said no one was in charge. I said, really? Because you are here almost every time I am and everyone seems to go to you as if you were the person in charge. After that, he admitted he was the person in charge. Honestly, he must be the general manager or the assistant since he is always there. Anyways, I let Ray know how dissatisfied we were about almost not being let in over a half hour before closing, and then to have to breathe in the harsh chemicals while we were still eating. It appeared they were still cooking food, which is even worse!! Health department would have shit themselves if they seen that! And the packaging area looks very sloppy. I told all that to Ray, and he had an attitude with me, saying that the cleaning is why he wasn't going to let me in. So change the hours on the door, Ray!! Cleaning is very very  important, but should be done after closing hours. Ray's attitude is terrible. He does not try to understand the guests point of view. Food is , service last night was . Change the hours on the door Ray, try to understand your customers, and own up when someone asks if you are in charge. Your cooks and servers do a great job. They seem scared of you Ray, but they do a great job.",5Y7q1VjKjOoI7m5dP2eZaA,2,0,2,L1QOj5GNrLJUkJqFylZgMA

My A list has been the Phad Thai Noodles and Kung Pao. The Phad Thai Noodles will fill you up quick! You probably won't be able to finish the whole thing in one seating. They are pretty hot, but the good hot. The egg and shrimp are popping. You can't really get overwhelmed with the mint leaves so that's good. The Kung Pao is just as spicy and the meat is real good.

  I have only one B dish which is the Sungapore Curry Noodles. The noodles just have a great pleasant taste to eat. You just enjoy the taste. My C list is the Phad Kee Meo and New York Style Chow Mein. The Phad has a similar taste to the Phad Thai but without all the spiciness just the flavor. Also the Phad has an up notch taste to those regular fake Chinese places. Every time I go in and make my order it is super fast! And if they take a little longer with your order it's either A they are busy, or they are making it from scratch and are busy so your order is going to be a little hot, but tastier. 

  At least that's how I've seen it. The Wontons are good also crispy. I've had there lunch specials. The rice doesn't feel that much like your chocking on it and the noodles are okay. The boba from here is good also. I think what makes this place soo good is that it has kept a lot of the same cooks from it's grand opening and has kept at least two of the original staff members. It's been four years since it's opened and it has been kicking ass for me since then. One day I wish to try out the restaurant next door to it.

  If you are around the area you should give this place a try. I will keep updating this reviews when I try new dishes from this place.",un5LELsWFeTx8-B8hcArRg,0,0,5,qxQ4V8gebFu762hznqmlcA

On the nights she's craving her chow mein and spring rolls, I just get an order of their egg flower soup and a side of rice, i mix them together and add a little low sodium soy sauce and a healthy dose of sriracha. It's very good and filling and cheap.

There isn't much more I can say about the place, it's cheap, quick chinese food. It's a little more expensive then panda express and a little better, but don't expect gourmet. I'd say it falls somewhere between panda and p.f. changs, but a lot closer to panda express.

Excellent Chinese food, although there was too much broccoli in my beef and broccoli for my taste. I've never sat in or called in an order there. I've always just walked in and ordered and have never had to wait more than 15 minutes for my orders of at least 3 entries to be ready. Highly recommend.

Oh and by the way. There's actual Chinese people working and cooking there. Every time I go into a restaurant based on some ethnic food, that isn't a a big chain like Panda Express or Olive Garden, I always try to see if the cooks are of or at least within' the ethnic parameters of given store. This passed the test! There were like 3 Chinese people cooking, two Chinese people working the tables, a Chinese dude handling the front end and I even think there was a Chinese dude waiting for the next delivery order to be ready for delivery. That alone gives this place a 5/5.",JhVMhYNceJUt369RODruDg,1,1,5,_2bDsQVJFY1HyiL77a0TUA

I've been here 3 times in the last week.

It's very fast and convenient. My family and I can be pretty lazy and this has been our go-to. We always order mapo tofu and fried rice. Considering my dad has Chinese blood in him, he enjoys it. Honestly, it could be a hit or miss... not terrible, just mediocre I guess.

Service: 3 out of 5
They are straight to the point. I respect them for it considering you don't expect great service at Asian restaurant anyway. It's just not in their blood, just saying. Grab your food and go. Honestly no need to small talk. They've never gotten my order wrong. That's important!

Convenience: 5 out of 5
I've called right after I got off work on multiple occasions to order, 10 to 15 minutes later, my food was ready for pick up. They also deliver if you're in the neighborhood (3 miles radius to be exact) with a minimum of $15 order and $2 delivery fee. Doesn't that sound convenient when you're super lazy? I think so! 

Food: 4 out of 5
Like I said in the beginning, it can be a hit or miss. I tried mapo tofu for the first time here and fell in love. I've had it again and again. Sometimes, I eat the whole thing and want more. Sometimes, it doesn't feel worth it or as good as before. Not the worst, not the best, just MEH. If you know what I mean... lol.

Overall: 4 out 5 stars
Why? 
When I'm hangry or in a crunch, they've got my back. I would probably always recommend you pick up or deliver over dining it. But that's just me.",UCjsKncHPTmLOH9sCkjQtw,1,4,4,8JjsPs3QxPZcAW5uf8Bt3w

Everyone there is amazing, the servers can take your order without having to write it down (and thats pretty awesome since my family usually orders 4-5 dishes).  They're very attentive also.  I never have to ask for anything like refilling my drink or bringing me boxes to take the food to go.  

The food is quite delicious! Everything comes out pretty fast.  Even if you're picking up food, it takes about 10 minutes for them to cook everything.  I love their A Go Go wings, which are salt and pepper wings that are super crispy with added chili peppers on top for a little kick.  You have to try it out sometime!  I also like getting HK crispy noodles, eggplant with tofu, and hunan beef.  

They also added some Thai food to their menu. The Thai Chicken salad that comes with a tasty peanut salad dressing.  Tom Yum soup is also really good if you're trying to clear your sinuses.  The Pad Thai is so so though.  If you're craving noodles, I'd say stick with chow mein.",z4RytucxI_XfcMFaEI2DRg,3,1,5,pM2pTlIlCQL5NLTEMpNjkQ

The Fried Noodle (small appetizer): they gave our table of 8 people a tiny plate that was barley filled with fried noodles and the dipping sauce was noticeably watered down.

The Chicken Katsu: we basically were just eating fried panko batter, hardly any chicken.

The only thing that wasn't so bad was the spare ribs and the boba & even those prices weren't acceptably matchable to the quality.

My favorite things about China a go go are that they have bbq spare ribs and three different vegetable dishes. I really prefer the spare ribs to the slices of pork that other places have. Not only are they fatty and delicious, like me, but they remind me of Chinese take out, as a kid, in New Jersey. The sauteed veggies are delicious. If you like a heavier sauce, I suggest the Buddah's delight.
Delivery is pretty prompt and has always been accurate. The driver last night seemed surprised to be getting a nice sized tip. It was good to make someone's day better.
