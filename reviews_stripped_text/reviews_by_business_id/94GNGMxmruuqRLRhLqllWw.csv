13389,2015-09-06,0,94GNGMxmruuqRLRhLqllWw,"Wendy's has always been a ""go to"" food choice for this Yelper, but today was my first bad experience at the Summerlin location. The ""kid"" working the drive-thru window is a thief... 1) He did not provide me with total after I ordered at the speaker so I could have my money ready, 2) when we got to the window he informed me of the total ($15.44), watched me count out $16 (2x $5, 6x $1), 3) he took the money and put it directly in to the cash drawer without counting it, 4) he then informed his manager that I only gave him $15 and made me give even more money to him because he was adamant that I under-changed him. 

If $15 dollars was received, he should have re-counted it in front of me to show me how much I gave him instead of putting it directly into the cash drawer. Instead he was unable to ""prove"" how much money was actually given and I was still forced to fork over more money than I needed to. Bad business practices! 

Word of warning to visitors of this Wendy's when a white 20-something yo kid is working the window: make sure to count your money twice before having to pay more than you need to. The customer is NOT always right at this location.",tKZCUeYZisYLHamPwHCrzg,1,0,1,gYCh2IrctPayszlv23ES7A

There was scaffolding all around the building I just had visions of drywall dust in my food so I had to pass until about a month after the remodel to make sure the dust had settled. I might eat garbage but it has to be dust free good garbage. 

My wife has been wanting to try the new pretzel pub chicken sandwich so we headed over with coupons in had. I had a BOGO coupon for any of the chicken sandwiches so we ordered 2 of those so we both could try one and then my hungry ass ordered a daves hot n juicy, cheesy cheddar burger, jr cheeseburger deluxe (for the dog) and some chili cheese fries. The pretzel chicken pub sandwich was very good and the thick slice of muenster cheese really stood out... but the pretzel bun didn't. The pretzel bun was very soft but lacked any pretzel flavor. If you are going to put ""pretzel"" in the name of a product it really should taste like it! The daves hot n juicy is my favorite here these days. I just get the single 1/4 lb and with the fresh veggies on it and it really hits the spot. The burgers here are fresh and never frozen. They also fresh cook bacon.

Well, maybe not quite, but at least on par with a Panara Bread. 

When I walked inside, I was a little overwhelmed because everything looked so different. Comfy chairs, lounge areas, flat screen tvs, even a faux fireplace greeted me.  My eyes actually had to adjust because this was not what I was expecting in a Wendy's.  Everything was spotless, with not a random cup or piece of trash in sight. Once I finally figured out where to go to place my order, the cashier was so nice and conversational that it actually took me aback.  My order was ready and complete before I even finished preparing my drink (they have one of those new fangled soda dispensers with 100+ varieties of beverages), and it was hot, fresh, and tasty.

My drive-thru experience was similarly pleasant.  They only have one window now, but they must have more people working the drive-thru, because I had absolutely no wait time- as soon as I handed over my money, there was someone there handing me my food.

Hopefully, this is not just a fluke because of the new look and will be consistent. For the meantime, I'm sold!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,4,2,5,zGUU-gICwQIG6t2UEfH4cA

The food is Wendy's.  I think they've improved their fries some, so that's a bonus.  And it's one of the few places that has Light Lemonade left!  I always order that if that's an option somewhere - In-n-Out still has it but McDonald's took it off the menu.

2246292,2015-04-20,0,94GNGMxmruuqRLRhLqllWw,"I'll be honest: until recently, the only thing I liked about Wendy's were their commercials and their Frosty. 

But then one day I came to this location and the staff was friendly and efficient. The food was amazing. And most importantly, at the time, the service was fast (I used drive thru). 

I came back a few days later, craving the same sandwich (the Asiago Chicken) and again, on a hurried lunch break. Once again, the service was lightening fast, the staff amazing, and the food perfect. This time it was a different pair of crew members, but they were friendly and thorough. I had a completed order, several napkins and my straw the MOMENT I pulled up to the window. Wow. 

So today, I thought I'd try one more time (Mr. Asiago Chicken called to me again...). Again, I was not disappointed. I had a new set of crew members, one who was especially friendly and smiling and cracking a few jokes. She offered me a free small frosty because it was incorrectly dispensed and was going to be tossed anyway. I told the crew members how thankful I was that every time I come it's a magical experience, like Disneyland lol.

Thanks Wendy's on Charleston & Ft. Apache and keep up the great work!! No other fast food near my work, maybe anywhere in town, has offered a better quality of food and service in many years!",7znuQ3Vay1oGBYvUvM6kyw,2,0,5,UblE9zM1Ie5rAY_h1X-0MQ

Yep, I come for the baked potato and I'm not ashamed. Let me be honest, I cannot cook baked potatoes. They come out hard, undercooked and nasty. The baked potatoes at Wendy's are heaven. Smothered with cheddar cheese, sour cream, butter, and chives. Deliciousness! They are huge too so no skimpy ones. Just how I like them. 

Next, their home style chicken sandwiches are cooked to perfection. Never over done, perfect crispy ness, and never greasy. The chicken breast is large and hits the spot. 

The french fries are hit and miss. Sometimes soggy or over done. you never know what your getting. 

Now, let's get to the sweet stuff. The frosty is an original hit here. Back when I was little I would dunk my fries but now it just tasted weird. It's sweet but not exactly like ice cream.. More like frozen yogurt. I say get a small and try it. Usually what I do is at the beginning of the year buy a one dollar key chain and get a mini frosty with every purchase that year. Sweet treat at every visit. Even if you go once every 3 months it's only 25 cent a frost. It pays for itself. 

The coupons to your email and mail are awesome. I always get BOGO sandwich or salad coupons. Saves you a little bit.",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,0,0,4,3ATWTRvqxbxw4ukrS0zcDQ

I get home , sit down and pull out the sammy and first thing I check for is the cheese. Oops sorry but no cheese. You paid for it but thanks anyway. And then I look over at the top bun and found what appears to be an attempt at lettuce and a tomato. No cheese anywhere.

Still I find myself getting a full combo meal here more often than Burger King or McDonald's, or even Carl's Jr.  What gives?  Who wins?  I'd have to see their financial reports... But I know for my preference, they have a good selection for chicken.

And they chimed in on the green tea craze!  Blueberry pineapple - pretty good.  Their medium beverage looks like a large.  I couldn't finish it.  Freeze it and consume later :)  And their fries with freckles - yeah there are freckles look closer.  They look like thin cut wedges cuz the potato skins are still on them.  Regardless; mayo please!

For the past 10 minutes I've been dry-heaving over the toilet. Upon inspection after the entire ordeal, the bacon is purely black and broken up with no smell to it at all.

I arrived home to eat a chicken sandwich, and baked potato. It looked like it was sitting around all day, dry and not edible. The baked potato looked disgusting. Nothing was fresh. I immediately called the store number on my receipt to speak to a manager. She was polite enough to listen to my complaints about their crappy food. She only offered a refund, and no apology. You have seen the last of me at this fast food garbage dump. I will stay on my healthy path, and avoid fast food. Thanks Wend's for convincing me to never eat junk. Where's the beef?

My fries were cold, limp and tasted like they dumped an entire shaker or two of salt on them. They actually were not edible. My Single burger was pretty good. Nice and juicy and served hot unlike the fries. I think the chili is pretty good but can't comment on the other fare at Wendy's.

Wendys has always been a place to go when we dont wanna make dinner. It has def changed some items, like their fries, which I am now not a fan of! I liked the old fries, they were sometimes mushy but sooooo good! The prices are also always fluctuating, it used to be a JBC was .99 then 1.19, 1.29, and now its 1.69 I think. You can basically get a cheeseburger deluxe for like .99 but its that dang bacon that gets ya! What we usually always get are the small frosties and a small fry to dip them in it : ) YUMM!!

I like this Wendys bc theyre quick, and have great customer service! Ive never had any bad experiences... YET! LOL.

The ordering left some to be desired, but the food was great, and I particularly loved the coke machine! It's one of those new ones with a touchscreen... And it has every flavor and coke product you could ever think of! It's absolutely incredible. 

I don't ever want to go to another Wendy's, if just because I loved the ambiance and food quality at this one! I'm very impressed!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,1,2,5,yZeESuTq36LmmOD0qThvNA

However, the last few months this location has been extremely dirty. I usually dine in and to not have one clean table out of twenty is unacceptable. Today the garbage can had ketchup all over, garbage visible behind the lids. A spoon lies on the floor next to the baby seats, spilled red kool aid on top of the garbage can. Every table base showed some type of food particles. Also Ice tea at this location is never brewed prior to 11:00am. I do however like the staff as they all seem nice and welcoming. I have not seen the manager here in a few weeks which could be the problem.
