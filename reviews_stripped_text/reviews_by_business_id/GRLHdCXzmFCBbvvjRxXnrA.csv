They are celebrating their 20th wedding anniversary and wanted to experience Dinner in the Sky. I have left multiple voicemails, sent multiple emails, and even sent a message on fb however I still have yet to receive any correspondence from this company. Very disappointed.",aYZQFfY2reLHCd40daygIA,0,0,1,oS0uSYKevqmFU8ZqMUjtqA

You are hoisted into the sky about 160 to 180 feet in the air and eating a nice meal...with a full staff and a host that I can give 4.5 out of 5 stars to as a host as well (Doug) I think was his name.

The food is pretty good and they actually cooked mine with a variation from their standard menu.  Fillet Medallions, Sky Chicken and Vegeterian are your 3 options.  
I can't complain much for a nice meal, wonderful host, great chef and serving staff over 160 feet in the air.

I recommend if you want to try something different than this is the place to go in Vegas than the standard restaurants, buffets and so forth.

By the way you are sharing a huge table with 22 people.",E7xnRr6BKDVss8KcE28Ucw,11,6,5,mKWv7fUUQSSVaWPZLz8oCA

My husband thought it would be romantic to take me to dinner overlooking Vegas at a height of over 150 feet.  What he didn't know is that I would completely freak out and be terrified when I saw what we were going to do.  Well, after a near divorce in the parking lot I came to my senses, got brave and prepared for this wild dinner.  We arrived at the location by Limousine from our hotel.  Upon arrival the red carpet is out and cocktails and appetizers are served while the waivers are being signed.  Once everyone is accounted for the guests are seated at the table.  Shoes are optional.  If you are wearing thongs or heels you may as well leave them on the ground.  Once everyone is strapped in to their seats the crane lifts the table to the desired height.   So here I was terrified in the beginning and once we got going I realized it really wasn't going to be bad at all.  In fact, I really enjoyed myself.  It was a beautiful night in August 2009 that I got to experience this very memorable evening.  FYI... there were a few people scared of heights but they all survived.  Only one person was super terrified the entire length of the dinner.  It's definitely worth a try if you like to try different stuff!   The host and other staff were amazing and really tried to make sure the people who were scared were comfortable.   Have fun!",CY7a6eE6GOcYySFjk0HJUw,21,16,4,KlDCq8ao3nfImQt5_WF_yw
