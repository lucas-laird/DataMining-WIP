My sub was very dry, the meat was tasteless and tough. My husband on had meat balls and marinara sauce on his sub no cheese at all which usually comes on a meatball sub. The fries were tiny and appeared to be refrozen then baked. This is the worst restaurant I have ordered take out from since I moved to Vegas! How can you ruin a sub? I mean really its sandwich!

Vegan pizza with Daiya cheese and up to 3 veggies, vegan baked zita with Daiya, vegan calzone.  Very nice, friendly and knowledgeable counterhelp.

Only drawback is they don't offer vegan pizza by the slice.  Wish they would do so as well as offering ""meat"" options such as vegan pepperoni, chicken etc.  

I got a small (8"" 4 slice) green pepper olives and mushrooms.  It only took about 10 minutes to bake it.  It smelled wonderful on the drive home; tasted wonderful when I ate it. Sauce is not an overwhelming tomatoey taste which is great, as I can't stand tomatoes.

Would be nice i they could develop a vegan dessert (cannolli or cheesecake).  I will be back.",VrAo40MP-MaHzJb9aSypnA,0,0,5,pnZCMiPjl_ny82_8MPhLJg

I also ordered wings, with hot sauce on the side, which they also did. i got what i asked and paid for, so i am happy with that. Food was pretty good. It didn't blow me away, that almost never happens in Vegas due to the mostly non-discerning folks who live here.

For Vegas, Pizza Company is it! Although it's not on the menu, they do offer fresh basil  This place doesn't skimp out on their toppings either  My only regret from this place is that I didn't get the name of the worker who was there when I picked up my pizza. He informed me that they sometimes make specialty desserts like Vegan Tiramisu, and they sell out quick when they do. He also let me sample their Vegan Ricotta which is not on the menu and is a special request. It was delicious! This place is a great option for Vegans, people with dairy intolerance and or allergies like myself, and anyone who wants to taste something new. My boyfriend who can eat dairy with no problem even liked my vegan pizza. Pizza Company also offers vegan ranch and it was absolutely delicious!

They have a rockin' thin crust pizza here, that is among the best in Vegas, and their wings ARE THE BEST I've had in Vegas.  This is a small place, only 6 or 7 tables, but the atmosphere is very comfortable.  As a few of the tips say, you can subscribe to their text alerts and receive specials and promotions via text.  That's what I took advantage of today -  their Dinner for 2 (even though it was lunch): A large 2-topping pizza, 6 wings, and 6 garlic knots for $14.99 - this is a limited-time special, but they offer similar specials via text alert all the time.  The only minus is that I wish they offered fountain drinks instead of (or along with) canned and bottled drinks.  If this place was more convenient for me, I would be here all the time.

The whole family is sitting around with huge bellies and bulging eyes. The food was wonderful. Ordering on line through Eat24 was easy. There were places to ask for extras and change pasta. Our order arrived within the time period provided. Everything was hot and plentiful. 

#1 16"" Margarita Pizza with Pepperoni. We asked for well done. That is how it came with a topping of fresh mozzarella and basil. Luscious, with drippy cheese, and great spices.

#2 Sausage and Peppers.  The sausages had been saute'd prior to being put with the peppers and onions. They were sliced thin. Each fork full was sausage, peppers (red and green bell) and some onion. It was wonderful. Mixed in was Ziti and a great ""juice"" or sauce that was light and not ""tomatoey"".

#3 Spaghetti and Meatballs. Yup, four regular sized meatballs. They, like the sausage had been saute'd prior to going in the sauce. Thick tomato sauce and instead of spaghetti We asked for capellini. It was a wonderful meal split between two kids and one dog. We did order a couple extra meatballs to insure all three were happy.

#4 Chicken Parmesan with Capellini. I ordered the extra chicken by checking the box when I ordered. There was enough chicken to feed a school of piraña. I ate until full and there is still enough for a lunch tomorrow. The salads that came with the dinner were cool, crisp, and eye appealing. The italian and the Balsamic dressings were perfect for the salads and with our meals.

Garlic knots, dried pepper flakes and cheese for sprinkling were supplied for us all.

This meal was absolutely perfect. We will be ordering here again, and again, and again.

My mild  chicken wings though they looked amazing had no sauce at all and we're raw inside.  I ordered chicken fingers with BBQ sauce on the side they were drowning in sauce.  The Caesar salad was great but I ordered a Cobb salad and opened it to find only lettuce tomato cucumber strips and cheese??? 

So when I went online to get the number to call it said they were closed.  Hence why my order was prepared incorrectly they were trying to go home.  So since I work 12 hour shifts I was unable to call the following day but the next day I called as soon as they opened and asked for the manager who basically called me a liar.  

He said if something was wrong I would have called back asap.  I told him this was asap for me.  I work 12HR days and they were closed when I realized the problem.  He said someone would have been there after closing the cleaning crew was there...lol  So I told him I don't want anything from you but to let you know what my first and now last experience was like.  He said we'll you should have called before now.  I also added I put the problem on the survey I received from eat street the (site that takes the orders) an hour after delivery you can check for yourself.  He said he would check into it and get back to me.  It's been a week you think he called back??

We've had the thick Sicilian and the thin New York crust. We prefer the Sicilian. Toppings have always varied as have the appetizers. Have to withhold the 5th star for the mushrooms not being fresh. They use an excellent cheese selection,, especially the feta. Cheesy garlic bread was basic, but loved as it was a reminder of some made at home. Great flavor on their ranch. Props for using all home made dressings and sauces but give the marinara a little consideration for tweaking. More pepper/garlic perhaps.

Service has always been good. Joey is who I'm familiar with at the counter. He's always attentive and helpful. Willing to bake even up to the last minute before shut down! Clean and well lit seating area that I have never used. Casual but comfortable and respectable. Could bring family IN to eat and not get that super dive-y feel from the place. It is well kept.

Dessert, a cannoli covered in chocolate called a Larhe, Delicious!!! This was my 3rd time ordering and I haven't been disappointed yet.
An 2 topping pizza with 4 chicken fingers, chocolate cannoli,  liter of soda, and an extra ranch plus $5 tip cost me $35.84.  Its worth the money and then some.

I was immediately greeted by a man named Francisco, like San Francisco without the San (he really said that and I giggled). He was so incredibly nice, patient and informative about everything since I told him it was my first time there. 

Ordered $19.99 Vegan Special (Yup, everything below is 100% vegan):

* Hot, steamy garlic knots w/ marinara sauce 
* Medium pizza with three toppings
* Two sides of their homemade vegan ranch 

Pros:
+ Francisco was SO helpful! 
+ Fresh hot food, straight from the oven 
+ Garlic knots are orgasmic, seriously, I'm drooling thinking about them right now. 
+ They personally deliver up to five miles. They also offer delivery through Amazon restaurants and a few other services if the distance is longer than five miles. 

Cons: 
- Smaller place than I expected, not a ton of seating
- They use Daiya cheese, that's my only big complaint. I really wish they used something else for the pizza. However, they have homemade vegan ricotta cheese that was pretty good. Please toss the Daiya and opt in for something else, maybe Numu (New York company). 

Everything I listed above was insanely delicious it was kind of scary, because I wanted to eat everything in one sitting. Go ahead Pizza Company, just take all of my money now.",wGD3H-uSkyhJtJnWaIvJBQ,2,1,4,mYcxlsyRh_a8qanv1ditvw

I ordered the vegan stromboli with black olives, mushrooms, and green peppers. I also got an order of the vegan garlic knots(!!!!!) with an extra marinara. The stromboli was delicious and the cheese was completely melted all the way through. Their marinara sauce was to die for. I enjoyed the garlic knots but they were kind of spongy.

He gave us some coupons and insisted on giving me a free vegan ranch that they make in house. I personally never cared for ranch but it did taste really good! Definitely spot on as far as ranch flavor goes. He told me that they also do a vegan tiramisu that sells out really basically as soon as they make it.

It was a little pricey. Our meal cost us $26 but to me it was worth the price. 

We will be back very soon!",H-q29CMtF2v3KlF8Sftt3g,0,0,4,8elkt_8WiV3JHVsbBwIw_g

First, the pizza. I ordered a Sicilian style with the Hawaiian toppings (pineapple, ham, bacon). The pizza was terrible! The crust was very odd. I don't know if it's their style or a problem with the dough but the dough had 2 layers. The top layer of dough wasn't cooked and the bottom layer was tough. The sauce had no flavor and neither did the cheese. The only thing with flavor on the pizza was the pineapple. This was hands down one of the worst pizza I've ever eaten. Frozen bargain brand pizza is better.

Next was dessert. They advertise tiramisu made fresh daily... My tiramisu was frozen! The entire center was ice! Much like the pizza the tiramisu had no flavor. The other problem was the cake on the bottom. The cake was dry and had a weird texture(felt like it was stale).

I highly recommend avoiding this place. The positive reviews must have been paid for because there is no way this place deserves a 4.5 star rating.",WMdcqi9fD-YNeCDwVTSpYg,1,0,1,FuCyqiChxv8QTRdZtU6DEg

We order a 16"" vegan with very light on the cheese, mushrooms, kalamata olives and fresh basil.  *disclosure* I can not stand Daiya cheese :) I just avoid the cheese when I ordering it and sometimes I leave it off all together.

We always order a full order of vegan garlic knots and WOW it's honestly my fav part because I love love love garlic, the more the better. Next time I order a pizza from here I need to get garlic on the pizza too :)

I will disclose that their sauce is a little bland...I think I'm just accustom to my own sauce that I simmer all day and use fresh herbs. I just like a punch of intense flavors and their sauce does not have that.

Their side salad it always fresh mixed greens and their in house balsamic is amazing. I always dip the pizza crust in it because it's just that yummy.

If you want pizza and you like a Slice of Vegas....(ick and overpriced) you will be hooked on the Pizza Company. It's just better. Hands down...it's better.

Oh and this place is a real deal! I think with we order all three items the total is $24? Wow what a steal.

So let's call out that this food was so terrible I had to write one this instant. My roommate and I have ordered from all over the place in our little 89014 area. Joes Philly, Super Pizza, Napolis, and none were great, this one though, just bleh! They use some sorta seasoning on there that we couldn't get passed, one slice and trashed the large pizza. 

The fingers reminded me of something left out for hours and hours, put in the fridge, and then microwaved (I know what this is like because I do this often). Even though I do it, I don't want it to taste like that upon arrival! 

The cheesy fries, or FRIES I should just call them, lacked any more than 1oz of cheese and to top it off they were cold, bleh! 

Fried zucchini was meh, and so were the cannolis. 

The one good thing, and the reason why this has two stars and not was is the ranch! I'm a ranch connoisseur and I'm always searching, this is great, not vinegar based!  

Let me also mention I told the people I needed to break a hundred, yet they didn't communicate it with the driver. So it was pennies on then dollar on my WASTE of 50 bucks or I gathered quarters for him; which I did, because I used to be a driver myself and didn't want to be a jerk.  

You can see photos of this hot mess on EAT24 as well as my not happy comments.

The meatball was just awful and almost ruined the pizza. Only lots of ranch and crushed pepper saved this one from complete failure. Wings were good but nothing special that I couldn't make myself at home with a bag of frozen Tyson wings and a bottle of Frank's hot sauce.

I travel a lot for work and prefer not to rent a car, so when I'm out, it's hard for me to find good places within a reasonable walking/cab distance. And I'm vegan... so it makes it double hard! When I saw that a pizza place offers a vegan option I was all about it. 

I ordered the vegan garlic knots and the vegan ""roll""... holy cow. It's not bland, the flavors are great and the roll is so much food, it's too much to eat! 

Some reviews I've read said the crust isn't great, but on the roll, I was really impressed. 

Thanks Pizza Co.! You made a happy, full girl outta me!

Update 9/2015. I was back in Vegas for work and I called Pizza Co. I didn't have the menu in front of me but by my phone number they were able to pull my previous order. Talk about customer service!

My boyfriend and I are vegan and came down to vegas for life is beautiful, we met a local that happened to be vegan and she recommended we check this place out. She mentioned they had the best vegan pizza in vegas. Just like everyone else we go nuts for pizza and decide to check this place out before heading back to San Diego. We were so satisfied with the food and the service we ended up taking food for our family back home. 

All of their food is made from scratch, which is something most restaurants now a days do not offer! We ordered the vegan special which included a medium size pizza with 3 toppings, 6 garlic knots, and two vegan ranch (I've had my fair share of ranch this one by far was my favorite) all for about 19.99 plus tax. 

We never got the owners name but we are truly thankful for the great hospitality and excited to see what the future has to offer this amazing brand.

Their vegan pizza is comfort food for me and something I end up ordering on the regular.

I used to bring my own vegan ranch for dipping but recently the owner started making his own. It is SO GOOD. When I get pizzas for my office I will get extras of the vegan ranch and everyone, even the meat and dairy lovers, raves about how good it is.

The vegan brownies are seriously good too, better than even most vegan restaurants. My hubby who is not really into baked goods will even devour one by himself! 

Their cheesecake is yummy too and something I get cravings for. The vegan ziti is pretty good, not amazing but definitely will hit the spot if you're in the mood. 

Oh but the garlic knots  So good. You can tell they are so much better quality than any type of garlic bread or similar product you would get at a chain like papa Johns or dominos.

Speaking of which, they are a small business and the owner is very involved. He listens to his customers and does his best to offer the things we want. One of the ways he does this is by using the ingredients he thinks are best, even if it costs him substantially more than a similar ingredient would. He buys fresh spinach instead of frozen and brand name vegan products even if he can't get them at wholesale prices. Pretty awesome if you ask me.

Oo and sometimes they run specials on their vegan pizzas too!",213KYzrMhngwpz0FleaP0A,1,1,5,Z8SczRO5yHZvf7S03BsLXA

First time I came here I got the personal 10"" veggie pizza. It was made on a thin crust, which I normally don't like as it tends to get soggy quickly and I end up having to eat it with a knife and fork, but theirs here was nice and crispy and stayed that way even the next day when I had leftovers!! Major points for that. The veggie pizza is made with spinach, green peppers, onions, mushrooms and black olives. All my favorite items on a veggie pizza. Cost $10.99.

The second time I came, I decided to try the Grilled chicken sandwich with bacon that came with a side. I decided on their fries. Another excellent item on their menu. The sandwich was on a ciabatta bun with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and mayo. The bread was fresh tasting, the chicken was perfectly cooked yet still nice and moist, and all the toppings were nice and fresh and crispy as well. The fries were well cooked and seasoned perfectly. Cost $9.99.

They offer a nice selection of lunch specials during the week from 11 am to 3 pm Monday-Friday. All their lunch specials come with a drink. 

And for those that are Vegan, they offer vegan options as well. This is such a nice and thoughtful thing for this place to offer since many people are Vegan, but still want to enjoy food outside of their own house. 

On top of their excellent food, the employees here are super friendly and accommodating. They work hard to make sure your food is just the way you want it. They were very welcoming and make conversation with their customers. 

The inside is pretty small with about 5 tables, so not a great place to come if you have a large party of people. The inside is older looking but is kept clean and organized.

Since I was on that end of town I figured why not try it out! I'm all about free! SInce the place smelled amazing when we walked in I decided to be a good customer and also order the garlic knots. I had to laugh when the owner said he would be making them fresh, did we mind waiting 10 or 15 minutes? FRESH GARLIC KNOTS? OK, force me to wait! 
The cheese pizza of course was finished before the knots, so we decided to sit there and eat it. Upon discovering just how YUMMY the pizza was I promptly went back to the counter and ordered a large pepperoni to go! No way was I going to drive nearly 30 miles back home and NOT have any pizza with me!
A gentleman came in while we were waiting for the large pie and he ordered a SLICE! I did not even notice that they sold pizza by the slice, but my daughter says that's because I am old and won't wear my glasses! ANYWAY!
He stood there eating his slice and when the owner asked if he would like to sit he said NO, I don't live anywhere near here and just come to eat this one slice! It's that good! (His words.) 

Well, of course that made me happy! I was sure I would be glad I took that large pizza home with me! I must confess, even the next day, reheated pizza was delicious!
The garlic knots could have used just a touch more gartlic for my taste and I didn't care for the marinara dipping sauce (too sweet) but the overall experience was worth it! 
Highly recommend this place to anyone on the south end of town. We did also enjoy watching the planes land since we are right across the street from McCarran's runway! 
I may not drive clear across the planet for this place, but anytime I am out south I will definitely stop in!

Today, I picked up a serving of their Spaghetti and Sausage Link special for $3.99. You get a good amount of spaghetti with a whole sausage link--some of it is thinly sliced with the remainder still being in whole sausage form. It also came with a couple of garlic knots on the side.

The sauce wasn't mind-blowing, but it was tasty enough. The sausage was well-cooked and had good flavor. They put a ton of sauce in my serving. I almost wish it had less sauce (or more pasta on the side to eat with it). The garlic knots served as a nice vessel for the extra sauce that was left over.

Overall, while not the absolute best spaghetti meal I've ever had, the $4 price point is the kicker. The taste to price ratio works in their favor.

Minor Update: I went back the next day and got the same lunch special. Strangely enough, it tasted even better, though the sauce was definitely on the greasy side. In any case, this solidifies their 4-star rating for me.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,3,3,4,gG19URl48R8BqMiAdegv3w

We ordered the margarita and pepperoni pizzas along with a Greek salad. 
The margarita pizza was a bit lacking in flavor, we'd rate it 3* but the pepperoni pizza was great at 4 stars. The NY pizza crust was excellent, along with good pizza sauce. The pepperoni was very good quality, not your usual greasy kind like at the corporate chain pizzas like Domino's, or Costco. the salad was good, fresh and we got the balsamic dressing and that was 5*.
The two guys who were working, were very friendly and courteous-if only this was the norm and not extra ordinary.....it's a real joy to interact with people who love their jobs, it makes it a great experience, when it's food, it really adds to the enjoyment and you want to come back.

It was a lot of food so I ate it over two days :)",hXOHumtKuh0180dT6VV_oQ,2,1,5,jbv6McQHHUKi1njpasOxuA

I placed my order through Yelp it was ready in thirty minutes. They did not put any utensils, napkins, red chilli flakes in the to go bag. I did not get the ranch I ordered. The pizza was relatively bland, I got a Hawaiian. The salad was good, I got the antipasto. Ordered a tirimisu because it was made in house. By far the grossest thing I have ever eaten. First, it was frozen;then it was covered in some old crusty cocoa powder. It was bland and completely inedible. I will not be back.",7LyqdQUtcJJx1DWv3TF_xg,1,0,2,TUqbcRL6X9j943DbnkwEww

They upped the prices a few months ago which is understandable but now they've reduced the size as well. What used to be the large is now the XL, so you're paying the same price for a large, but you're getting a smaller pizza when you order the large.

With that being said, I still think they make a good pizza, but we'll be looking for cheaper options in the future.",0KeT9NKimYkHN0wlrij-dg,5,0,3,lVwVZAgs2X_FPKMEx5h8gw

It wouldn't hurt if the dude making the pies wear at least a pair of light plastic gloves if he's multi-tasking in touching the cash register and grabbing the counter pens, etc; They think they slick by chopping a full slice in 2 so the joint was about size of your palm of your hands that fit into a itty bitty pizza box. Probably it was their sauce but I found it a bit salty and it was HELLA greasy, had to go hit up Planet Fitness after.
