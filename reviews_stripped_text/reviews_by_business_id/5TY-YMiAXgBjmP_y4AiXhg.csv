Got the Capastrami and I must say it was nothing short of amazing. Juicy without being sloppy (in fact there was not sloppiness at all) and just the right amount of dressings and meat. The pastrami itself was flavorful and juicy with a hint of fresh spices and the serving was very generous. Next time I'll try the Bobbie which is their most famous sandwich and was told it tastes like ""Thanksgiving dinner in sandwich form"".

The prices are a bit on the high side (paid about $9.5 for it) and there might not always be a table to sit in but that should not prevent anyone from trying it, especially if you happen to be in the Santa Fe Station.",S-dfqUtbu7JybeU6mOTWmQ,2,1,4,3Z7IMe5HHkZEoz9_7CmoqQ

Ordered online, arrived there ten minutes after scheduled pick up time, waited in line to find out they had not even started my order. I was told to wait five minutes, proceeded to watch every one from the line get their food before me. The estimated 5 minute wait time became thirty minutes no exaggeration. Wasn't even offered as much as a water cup for the wait. 

Took an hour to make two subs (which still were made incorrectly).

The simplicity of making a sandwich in a timely manner should come easy to a franchise corporation. 
I literally downloaded yelp to make this my first review out of dissatisfaction. Thanks for making me and my pregnant wife miss our movie date.",yxeg7kzq5VlK8S_yOR2aYA,0,0,1,jHY5rYe_gS7brEq2O-KCjQ

That's surprising considering that the casino smoke wafts right into their eating area.  But, the food is excellent, there's more seating in a less cramped environment, and we can buy refillable glasses of soda pop (our stand-alone Capriotti's only has bottles).",IgFS6DZRcePxecF17YA3Qg,1,0,5,cf0bQS9R_Vdyj8vFJtAfqA

The counter person in  the food stand next door called us over to have a burger. What was I to do? It is fast food after all and nothing is slower then no one to take my order. They failed.",oyz-6INadg4q8cdSgaWYoA,0,0,1,e9D1jQYB8vUhw0U32qat-A

But the Bobby is so good to eat all their food is good to eat and is always clean and the people always nice to me and my wife.

I went on Monday January 1, 2018 and they opened at 11:00 a.m. I stood there until 11:05 a.m. waiting for the lady to say something. She saw me standing there and did not say can I help you or we will be right with you. I understand that you just opened but if you want business then open your mouth because the movies started that day at 10:00 a.m. This is not the first time my experience has not been good there so I think I will not go back.

3213905,2014-05-01,0,5TY-YMiAXgBjmP_y4AiXhg,"The Bobbie sandwich is worth the hype. If you like Thanksgiving (which you should cause you're a patriot reading this) then you'll dig this sandwich. They made the sandwich in, no bs, 1 minute or less. I had just gotten my drink filed and it was ready. The manager was working the register and he was very courteous and professional. If you have a chance to get one of these wiches, GET IT!!",DSjfuPygAvv17e1DHAAZqw,1,0,5,8g10urlqCilx5IsdbIvc5Q
3516812,2016-12-17,39,5TY-YMiAXgBjmP_y4AiXhg,"This Capriotti's is located inside the food court (where Lone Mountain Buffet used to be) inside Sante Fe Station. You can place a phone order or walk right up to the counter and order. There is plenty of tables with seating in the food court and the area is usually pretty clean. I have had both the Capastrami and Bobbie from this location several times and it's been constantly tasty. The employees are friendly and I like that they accept the rewards from their app as well coupons that come to my e-mail. Having the app gets you freebies like cookies, drinks and sandwich upgrades as well a free sandwich after purchasing so many. Make sure to check the bottom of your receipt they sometimes have discounts towards your next purchase. This is a decent place to grab a sandwich hot or cold.

Capastrami ($8.49 for a small) - Hot pastrami, Swiss cheese, Russian Dressing, and coleslaw. This is definitely my favorite sandwich at Cap's. The coleslaw is made fresh daily and it just tastes good. I order it to-go often and it's still hot and delicious by the time i get home to eat it. 

The Bobbie ($7.59 for a small) - Homemade Turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mayo. It's like they took all the leftovers from Thanksgiving and put it between bread for the ultimate leftover Thanksgiving sandwich. The turkey is made fresh at each location and hand-pulled. I really liked how this last Thanksgiving they had the option to add a side of gravy, score! Where has this gravy been? Please bring the gravy back as a regular menu item because it pairs so nicely with The Bobbie! This is the perfect sandwich to pack for a picnic lunch, hike or to take with you to work for lunch because it holds up well. 

The bread for the Cap's locations here in Vegas and Henderson come locally from Great Buns Bakery and is delivered fresh to each location. 

Sizes are as follows and it's worth noting because to this day I see people ordering a large and then they get so surprised at how big it is:

Large - 20 inches
Medium - 12 inches
Small - 9 inches",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,49,52,4,RU9uSn4btVTSfpmfyBzoQQ
3599027,2012-01-13,2,5TY-YMiAXgBjmP_y4AiXhg,"Tucked away in the Santa Fe Station food court, Capriotti's seemed like the best choice of all the food options there. I usually go back and forth between the Bobbie and the Capistrami, and this time, I wanted a hot sandwich so I got a Capistrami before going to the movies. The combination and contrast of the hot pastrami combined with the cold slaw and russian dressing makes this an addicting sandwich that you take one bite after another until there is no more!

I ended up sneaking the other half of my sandwich in because we weren't keeping track of time and didn't wanna end up with junk seats, That was a great sandwich, and I prefer that any day over a bucket of outrageously priced popcorn with that fake butter...ALOHA!!!

I had the best sandwich that I've ever received in my entire life. 

Shout out to all the crew 

My bread was soft. My sandwich had the best amount of cheese.

I had made Capriotti's a habit on my prior trips to Vegas over the course of the last 15 years whenever I felt the urge for a quick casual quality lunch or dinner. I was, therefore, pleased, when Elite Las Vegas Yelper, Christie graciously invited me to meet her and her husband, Marc for a bite at Capriotti's, during my recent Vegas vacation.

I ordered the Cole Turkey(turkey, coleslaw, provolone and Russian dressing on a hero). I bit in and loved the fresh taste of the turkey, the crispness of the cole slaw, the nicely melted cheese, the tasty soft bread and the great flavor imparted by the Russian dressing. I virtually inhaled the sandwich.It was as good, or better, than the Cheese Steak sandwiches I had eaten in the past..........And, more importantly, my experience at Capriotti's on 7/21 was made immensely more memorable because I shared it with new friends.

Capriotti's is another franchise that needs to come to lower New York.",MZe_LcXsXv-U7y8Oa6RPVg,10,12,4,NW9t3FM31MHf0SV3iJ2Qjg

We tried the Bobbie, cheese steak, and meatball and all were equally as delicious but I would have to say the cheese steak was the favorite! The man making the sandwiches obviously loved his job and took so much pride in every one that be made. When I told him how great his sandwiches were I believe he was shocked for the compliment but I could eat those everyday how could I not thank him! And the manager Mary was so sweet and helpful I really enjoyed all 3 of my experiences there and look forward to finding one close to home to share with the rest of my friends and family.",n8kZ8EO-N5W_Ri2g2Ye1kQ,1,0,5,v-1qFcZ-3LAFSfkl2fHY5A

5186212,2015-12-06,0,5TY-YMiAXgBjmP_y4AiXhg,"Decided to try this place last after hearing great things about it. We ordered a sandwich and a salad. After waiting a while we noticed a few people that ordered food after us received there food. My boyfriend went up to the cashier to ask when our food was going to be ready. One of the guys making sandwiches snapped at him saying it takes 15-20 minutes. He came back to the table and We looked at the receipt for the time and it had been 17 minutes. I noticed the two guys pointing a us and giving us dirty looks. I figured we give them a little more time and give them benifit. after watching a few more people get there order I walked up there to find out what was going on since it had been almost a half hour. The cashier apologized again and again saying our order was lost to give them 5 more minutes. We told him we were tired of waiting it shouldn't take 30 minutes to make a sandwich we just wanted our money back. He understood and kept apologizing while refunding our money. He was super nice and felt horrible. The other two, not so much instead of trying to get our order ready they stood there giving us dirty looks. Very disappointed in this place and will never go back.",YTmsfdv8Ek23xMgtrS0wzA,1,0,1,HbQRJ-wRLGemH-gIkFS2kg
5470945,2013-05-15,0,5TY-YMiAXgBjmP_y4AiXhg,"I love Cap's; when I ate meat my favorite sub was the Slaw and Roast Beef, and the Bobbie is great of course :) But not only do they offer great meat subs, they have Vegetarian ones too! 
They use a soy based sub for their veggie subs, and it tastes really good. I got the veggie version of the roast beef and slaw sub, and my dad got the Bobby.
I was disappointed to see that they skimped on the soy turkey, so it was essentially all slaw. The Bobby was perfect though, so it just seems like they skimp out on the veggie subs at this location. 
They also have a soda fountain that is accessable by patrons, so that's nice- you don't have to ask them for a refill, just get your own.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,3,1,3,OY7JC58crFnqvdEp_9fcQg
