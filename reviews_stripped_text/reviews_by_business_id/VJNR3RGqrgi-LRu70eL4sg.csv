In Vegas for a convention, we got to the hotel tired and hungry, but didn't have reservations, so we went to the food court. I had the grilled veggie bowl. It consisted of lots of sliced eggplant and yellow squash on brown rice. The veggies were mushy and tasteless and the brown rice was hard as a rock. It actually scared me - I thought I broke a crown! There seemed to be no sauce or seasoning of any kind. Soy sauce and red pepper flakes helped a little. The onion rings were good though. My husband had the teriyaki chicken bowl. He said the smoked chicken was really good but his didn't have any sauce on it either. His brown rice was also hard. Not hard as in undercooked- hard and stuck together in little clumps like it had been sitting under a heat source for a LONG time. Since the veggies were the only vegan choice I could see aside from onion rings and fries, we won't be going back there. I must tell you that the lady who took our order was very nice and efficient, and aside from a lousy dinner we are enjoying our stay at the Tropicana.",cTGZT3Y-bIF0PIIQHhNUkQ,0,0,2,xF2iq-6xtzctJVfhCCHTFg

You get your free warm chocolate chip cookie here if you are a Hilton Honors member.

Much more reasonable prices for coffee, we also ordered the Fried Egg and Bacon sandwich $8.99 and Breakfast Burrito $10.99 to hold us over for our flight back. The price is not bad for  Vegas standards. You can choose to have it on a bagel or English muffin, we chose the English muffin and it was tasty, the egg was freshly cooked and the bacon was medium in thickness and cooked crisp. The burrito was a nice, hardy and hot, what more can you ask for? It was decent size too, I'd guess probably a 10 in tortilla. It was filled with fluffy scrambled eggs, ham, sausage, and bacon. It even came with a side of salsa that surprisingly had a bite, brilliant!

Some interesting items on the breakfast menu (available all day) was a Loco Moco Bowl and a full Hawaiian Breakfast, which I thought was neat.

Yes, it is indeed not a 'Food Court' as the name suggests but it does sell some fresh fruit (apples, oranges, and bananas), small bakery items, pizza, sandwiches and burgers.",d5WLqmTMvmL7-RmUDVKqqQ,7,7,4,szrdA0GXzqUBxeRsc7NDMA

The lady working the counter was very accommodating when I wanted to switch up the cheese in one of there Cobb salads on the menu. Service was friendly.

3577089,2015-02-25,0,VJNR3RGqrgi-LRu70eL4sg,"The worst dining experience I've had in Las Vegas, and I've lived here for 6 years.

This was my first time eating at any place at the Tropicana and oh boy was it bad.  I saw the menu online and was excited to see a casual dining restaurant in a casino that serves chicken katsu.  Got here at around 8 PM on a Tuesday night, which should be pretty dead for a food court.

First off, this is NOT a food court.  It is one restaurant with two registers which has a small coffee shop display case with salads/fruit in it.  There were two employees that I saw, a cashier (Rosalpa was her name I believe) and a chef who was mostly making pizza.  We were behind two people in line and it took 10 minutes to even get our order in because the cashier doubled as the person who would go get pizza, call out orders, etc.. 

While we are near the register to order/pay, one guy has been waiting the entire time for a slice of pizza.  He finally gets the cashier's attention and says ""I've got to run and I've been waiting for my pizza a while"" so she asks him what kind he got and he says it, then she starts cutting a piece from the pizza in the display case and he says ""no, it's in the pizza oven and is still there"" so she turns around and grabs it out of the oven.  I don't know how long it has been in there but it's charred black on the bottom now.  Another man comes up to inform them that there are no more forks.  He waits several minutes before the cashier puts out a new container of forks (she does not put it in the area with the other utensils, but puts it on top of the counter near her).  

Anyway we finally order.  I get the chicken katsu with white rice and my girlfriend gets the fries.  We get no receipt, just a number.  10 minutes later our order is ready.  My chicken katsu has no glaze on it and it's on brown rice.  I say to the cashier ""I ordered brown rice, and isn't this supposed to have a hawaiian glaze on it?"" and she doesn't address the glaze, but says they didn't have any more white rice so they gave me brown.  She doesn't really offer to fix it or anything, and I ask for a receipt -- she says she gave it to me (nope!).  She digs it up and I am just so disgusted by this whole experience that I go wolf down my dry chicken katsu.  I don't mind brown rice but this was burnt and crunchy so I couldn't even eat it.  At least the chicken itself was decent.  Girlfriend said the fries were good.

After this I went to the players club and they called the food & beverage manager.  He gave us a comped meal at the Beach Cafe next door so that was nice.

I really don't understand why they had so few employees there.  By the time we left there were at least 10 people behind us in line.

Lastly I really don't understand why this place is called a food court when it's basically a single restaurant the size of a coffee shop that just happens to serve some hot food as well.  The ""Beach Cafe"" next door which I have not been to apparently isn't much of a cafe either as it has a buffet in it!",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,0,1,Gabdmg_9IzpA7I6Fmjr4Cg

Although I asked for my Pizza to be ""well done"", there was simply too much Cheese and Sauce for them to properly cook it that way.  They tried though.....but it was still very ""doughy"" and soft....blazing hot though, I had to give it a few min to cool off.

The flavor of the Pizza was OK....the Cheese overwhelmed it a bit.  The Pepperoni was quite small too.

Overall, it's a pretty average Slice of Pizza.

Visit 1: Ordered Philly fries at 8pm. About 5 other orders ahead of me. Took 40 minutes to get my fries and by the time I got it, it was cold. (-2 stars)

Visit 2: Ordered a slice of combo pizza around 3pm. Pretty busy with about 7 orders ahead of me and 5 people behind me. After waiting for 20 minutes for what should be really as simple as throwing the slice in the oven for 2 minutes, I go back up to the counter and they tell me there was a mix up and there's no combo pizza left. I had to get a Hawaiian pizza instead. (-2 stars)

Visit 3: Ordered another round of Philly fries around 3pm. Not as busy as the 2nd time. Old lady at the front was rude and made no effort to see why I couldn't charge the pizza to my room. Had to pay out of pocket instead of using my hotel credit. Took 15 minutes this time to get my Philly fries. A new record. (0 stars)

Overall, whoever manages this place needs to be FIRED. Absolutely disgusted at how inefficiently run this place is and how rude some of the employees can be.
