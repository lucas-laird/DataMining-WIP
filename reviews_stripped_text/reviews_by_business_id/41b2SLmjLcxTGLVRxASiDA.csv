I ordered the wagyu steak and found it to be overwhelmingly salty. Everyone in our group that ordered steak was disappointed. 

Those who ordered the lobster found it to be quite good.

The side of mashed potatoes was good, but small. I also got a side of mushrooms which was pretty decent.

For $150/person I expected a lot more.",FotZ_GlED7LeTHhflyOGUQ,1,1,2,7GL_Ie8wO7OoykJGapUEyw

The quality of the buffet was quite good, with salads, shellfish, meats and fish. The buffet is not extensive but there are good choices. They also have menu items that are cooked to order but are included with the buffet. The volume of the music was appropriate and made for a very nice atmosphere. For an extra $35 you get bottomless Bloody Mary and Mimosas.

347311,2012-04-26,1,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Ok here we go. I am hyper critical so here goes!  

This place is a phenomenal place!  Don't be misled by the name. 

Ambience:  lovely. View of the golf course and waterfall. But you don't need the view the food is unbelievable. Move  over Thomas Keller and Grant Achatz. 

I opted for the chefs taste of New Orleans   Wow. Wow. Textures and flavors that will delight your taste buds. The presentation is creative. A hot jumbo lump crab cake on a plate that looks like a sheet of ice!  Nice. 

Value: Bargain. $95 for the chefs taste after eating here I would have paid twice the amount!I.  

If I could make this six stars I would. In fact the siixth star would be Merrie my sever. She not only knows the food but the fine nuances of the food. You must ask for her by name. I overheard the waiter at the table next to me. Enough said ask for Merrie and you will have a six star meal!

The chef came out and introduced himself(rare). The food was so outstanding I  could not stop raving about every course. Thank you Merrie for the honor of meeting Chef Carlos  Guia. Another treat!

Almost forgot about the wine. I did two flights. The white $21 three generous pours and the red flight $28  beginning with the crab cake. The pinot noir was perfect starter in the red department. I would highly recommend the wine flights. I have been called a wine snob but these two flights were perfect for the chefs menu. 

Dont  miss this place I rarely rave about a restaurant this is a must. A meal you never want to end!",IXS1RVUIjKjsWDjpfApJaQ,1,1,5,A89lbGDoIjbcTw0Tde-a3A

392706,2016-10-18,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"It has been many moons since I have eaten here and we wanted to stay in the Wynn. We sat in the bar area so we could watch the games. Service was good and friendly. Appetizers were a mixed bag. Gigantic shrimp cocktail was excellent, tartare very good while the foie was overcooked and not all that tasty. We were all in the mood for prime rib and it looked delicious sitting on the serving cart. Problem was that they ran out. How does a restaurant in the Wynn run out of prime rib? And on a Saturday? It was not like it was midnight but rather 8pm!!! Oh well. One person in our party was able to get the last piece albeit not quite to his doneness liking but he knew that was the case when the waiter said it was near the end. Now all complaining aside, it was an almost perfect piece of prime rib. Almost perfectly cooked (had we had the middle it would have been perfect), it was tender and juicy and beautifully spiced. Simply spectacular. The mashed potatoes and spinach were an after thought. Potatoes very good the spinach was ok. I ordered the ""waygu"" strip steak with shaved black truffles. I would generally never order a dish like this but it sounded good and after the disappointment of being out of prime rib I felt like treating myself. If it were $50 I would have enjoyed it a lot more than the $90 price that they were charging. Cooked perfectly the meat was tender and flavorful but the salting was a bit too liberal and the jus that accompanied it was too much for the truffles that were a underwhelming in taste. Oh but that prime rib will have me coming back next trip. SOOOOO good.",AeQbL7ZA-dbMLf4I--l2_A,0,0,4,OW3wBjY6P6nx1TE4HUyMTw

I went here for a lunch meeting and was impressed by the view of the golf course and how fast we were seated during the typical lunch hour. As tempted as I was to go all out since I wasn't paying for the meal, I decided to be nice and just order a regular burger. So alas I settled for the BBQ Bacon Burger with Parmesan Truffle Potato Crisps.

As you're waiting for your food, they give you a basket of complimentary bread and butter. I can't complain when there's freebies!

So here's the test, food arrives. Beautiful presentation for a burger. The burger however wasn't as pleasing as it looked. The bun looked appealing like a pretzel bun but it was really dry. The BBQ sauce was too sweet for my taste and the bacon was a little overcooked that there was no flavor. A little disappointed but glad I didn't pay the $16 for the burger.

502727,2010-04-07,1,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Best brunch ever. Why do people walk though snakelines like cattle for regular brunch when they can go to the Country Club for the Jazz Brunch for just a bit more? Situated next to the Wynn golf course, The Country Club has a very, well, country club feel to it. You won't find anyone there you saw the night before at a club or on the strip pushing a stroller at 2am. And obviously there was also a live jazz band playing off to the side. There was a little wait for a table outside so we killed some time at the bar while the bartender served us complimentary Kentucky Tea, which is bourbon, sour mix, triple sec and a whole lot of tastiness.

When we finally got our table outside, wow was it worth that short wait! We overlooked the 18th green and a huge waterfall. Because the Wynn is on the east side of the Strip and Country Club faced east, there were hardly any high rises in the background. Just peaceful green as far as the eyes can see. It's like you're not even in Vegas. And after a whole weekend of nonstop whatever, it's nice to have a little R&R on your R&R.

The buffet is high quality: jumbo shrimp, king crab legs, smoked salmon, and a carving station with filet, lamb and various sausages. In addition, there was a complimentary menu to choose from with more traditional breakfast fares. There was also a big table full of desserts.",-wF9X1C5NxqOPCU57ZQOuw,4,1,5,s7-Fm-5fh0opyg7WveetGQ

Make a reservation and make sure you go for the brunch menu! The restaurant is nestled deep within the Wynn but overlooks the lush and otherworldly golf-course. Grab a table outside and eat while listening the lovely waterfall and admiring the green.

The food? Basic American brunch fair, but it's done right, I promise! I had their French toast and was mightily impressed... When you're there, though, do pick the open-faced Prime Rib sandwich! It looks delicious and tasted even better.

The service is impeccable! We had five people serve us and were just four people! They even poured the au jus sauce over the sandwich for you!

Do take note: It is pricey. You're looking at about 15 to 20 bucks a plate just for brunch, and more than just a couple of bucks for drinks. Bloody Mary will run you about 11 dollars, but its mighty tasty.

The restaurant view is beautiful.  You're overlooking the golf course and some of the strip.  The crowd is mostly middle-aged rich looking people so we stuck out like a sore thumb.

Hubs: Why? You love the bottomless Perrier Jouet at XYZ.
Me: Hmmm....

Yet we found ourselves living on the precarious edge of danger here at the Country Club Sunday Brunch located deep within the Wynn Resort. Highly recommend this experience. Do not confuse this with the Wynn Buffet!!

Although the brunch is less expensive than our accustomed brunch, I could still have bottomless bubbly - Veuve Cliquet!!!! - for an additional $65. Hubs opted for the bottomless Berlucchi Franciacotta  for $35. These also give you the option to limitless sangria, Mary's and bellinis - but why would you?! Just asking...

As many previous reviews shared, the buffet includes a self-serve buffet of delectable breads, sushi, chilled seafood, gourmet soups, fresh-made waffles, and more. It's not as robust as other buffets but everything is top-notch. Additionally, you can order butler-served dishes like wagyu beef hot dogs, omelettes and crepes.  

And then there is the live jazz band. They are THAT good! Tip them, make a request and they'll serenade you table-side! Sighhhhhh...

The dessert station wowed me with solid chocolate lollipops topped with caramel popcorn. The other offerings looked like they were plucked from Payard - but alas, I was way too full.

This restaurant is the classiest place I have ever been to. I do not recall my trip as it was four years ago but this place stands out very clearly. This restaurant has earned its reputation of being a great place to eat for its service, quality of food, atmosphere, and its ability to overlook its rule on dress requirements (I walked in and felt like I was Jed Clampett since I was the only one wearing a tank top and shorts whereas the rest of the customers were wearing suits). To say the food is pricy is an understatement; it is my understanding that the waiter I had for that evening was putting his kids through college on this job based mainly on the tips. What I had to eat there was the steak (I cannot recall the specific menu item or the ounces) and it beat out every kind of food that has ever entered my pallet. It was tenderized and seasoned perfectly, and so I would assume for every dish that came out of the kitchen. The dessert I had (again I cannot remember the item) was essentially an explosion of flavor and melted chocolate. Before coming here make sure you have the money or have just won big time at the slots or tables located not far away.

On Saturdays, brunch is a la carte, so prices are more reasonable, though still a little steep for brunch and the small to average portion sizes. I got the sweet corn chowder soup, which was fair, but honestly, the Farmer's Market White Corn Soup at Wolfgang Puck's restaurant Spago at Caesar's Palace takes corn soup to another level of flavor and it's hard not compare the two when these restaurants are basically right across the street from one another (so basically go to Spago if you want amazing corn soup). I also had tofu (which could have been grilled a little better) with sauteed mushrooms - and the mushrooms were delectable!!!!!

I have hosted a dinner party at this restaurant in the past and heard nothing but great reviews from my guests.  We tried it tonight because they now offer vegan and vegetarian options which we are (myself, vegan and my husband, vegetarian).  When making the reservation, we told the CSR about our dietary restrictions and thought the information would be passed on.  Once seated, we were given the regular menu and stopped the waiter mid-sentence when he was talking about the meat specials.  We were given the correct menu and ordered an appetizer, entree and side so we could try a little bit of everything.  

The appetizer came sans cream since it was not vegan, which I questioned.  The entrees showed up and were a very nice portion.  However, the asparagus was really stringy and woody.  It seemed that the rough end was not trimmed off.  My meal was good, but like the rating indicates, I've experienced better.  The crispy fried yucca were good, i would order them again.  

Our waiter was friendly and knowledgable.  Even though he was not vegan, you could tell that he made an effort to understand the dietary request and didn't look at us like we were crazy, which is what most restaurant staff in Vegas do when you ask them for a vegan option.

I so appreciate the Wynn and Encore for supporting vegans and vegetarians at each of their restaurants so for that I give the experience 5 stars.  My suggestion is that rather then having the customer ask for the veggie menu, it could be offered right away, just like water.

835626,2015-07-06,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Sitting by the pool at Ceasar's we were casually doing some investigation on where to have dinner. In reading the various reviews on Yelp we settled on The Country Club as one of the ones we would visit and by good fortune they had an opening for us the next night.

Probably one of the best kept secrets in Vegas The Country Club is at the far end of the hotel. We were wondering what we were getting ourselves into as we walked by various lounges and restaurants but finally we came to our destination. While not over the top it is well designed and just felt comfortable to be in. The Maitre'd welcomed us and when asked for a table by the window he asked if we mind sitting at the bar for a few minutes and he would see what he could do. A relaxing drink at the end of the day at the bar and just as we finished it our table was ready with a great view of the golf course. Nice to see green grass and trees within the strip! 

They have a great menu but what caught my eye was the 6 course dinner with wine pairing. I was sold when Kevin our waiter informed me the chef was from New Orleans and you will taste many flavours from his home. My better half ordered the Salmon which I thought would be hard but they accommodated the difference by having her order and appy and they would put two courses on one dish. 

From the first course of Shrimp Gumbo with a wonderful glass of wine that blended perfectly together I knew the right choice was made. the other 5 courses were just as fantastic. As my dinner of pecan crusted red snapper and a 5 ounce fillet was served together the Salmon dinner also arrived. However, all through the night she constantly took samples of my meal and was so impressed with the freshness and taste of everything. We both tried the french toast bread pudding and we were impressed.

The only complaint was the steak was slightly overcooked and they offered numerous times to remake it but even for a medium steak it truly melted in your mouth. You really can't beat quality.

For desert came beignets with Ice Wine from the Niagara Falls in Ontario. A perfect way to top the evening and because of the steak being over cooked they brought an extra glass for my lady. A nice touch.

As we were leaving we could not believe how wonderful everything was and tasted perfectly and we were not stuffed.

They do have an outdoor area where you can dine but we were very happy to sit inside and look through the glass.",2_MSk0PTCyFLdlkVy0RVpw,1,2,4,4rET2-1S5RS3BgrvQfYtIw

We have been to the jazz brunch at the Country Club before and enjoyed it very much.  I was looking forward to returning again for Easter Brunch. There was a time, where we would eat here and talk about the food for days afterward.This is the first time we had been back since Rene Lenger has been appointed Executive Chef. The room still has one of the best daytime views in town. The Jazz music is always a plus for any dining experience. With this said, the restaurant has changed and not for the better. The food just isn't special anymore and has lost a lot of the pizzazz, it once had.

Gone are:
The large shrimp that were as big has your fist, they have been replaced by the standard smaller ones.
The King Crab has been replaced with the little Snow Crab clusters.
No crawfish, they are just gone.
No Bar-B-Que shrimp with grits
No Gumbo
No pulled pork eggs Benedict

The inspired Big Easy brunch dishes have left the building and have been replaced with a very standard blas√© affair. 

Along with the changes, Chef Rene has made to the menu, there has also been a change in the pricing to participate in this dining event. It is no longer $65.00 per person, plus tax and tip, but instead, it is now $75.00 plus. This is hard to swallow when the standard of food has dropped in quality and uniqueness.

The service was, tolerable only because of our busboy Filippi. Filippi was excellent and did his best to make our afternoon enjoyable. Our waiter introduced himself and was never to be seen again until I asked for the bill.

Being a resident of Las Vegas, I hold Mr. Wynn in the highest regard. He has made Las Vegas what it is today and he is Mr. Las Vegas as far as I'm concerned. He has set the bar for excellence and his properties represent the best of the best. The Country Club Jazz Buffet used to be one of the best Sunday brunches anywhere, now it is just acceptable with a nice view and jazz music.

Did I? Not a chance.

My friend and I were looking for a solid meal to aid in curing our hangover from the night before... and standing in line for a few dishes was only going to make my agitation worse. 

We walked right by the buffet, only to come across The Country Club... and I was relieved we did! 

We were seated immediately, in a homey, brown leather booth, right by the bar.  The interior is comfortable and open... incredibly inviting. So, not only did we get to enjoy delicious food... we were able to watch the NFL games on their flat screens as well! Huge plus. 

Although my friend was not impressed with her pulled pork ""sandwich"" (it's basically a bunch of fatty meat, piled high on what looked to be a thick piece of cornbread)... I loved my meal. I started with a Caesar Salad... with crunchy romaine and a great dressing that had the perfect amount of anchovy.

Afterwards, I engulfed my Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict. It was absolutely delightful! Perfect amount of sauce draped the flaky and buttery biscuit.  The eggs were perfect, as was the salmon. Yum yum yum!

The brunch is pretty cool with a couple different stations and an entree menu of egg dishes and made to order cooked items. The buffet is small but everything is delicious and very nicely done. The seafood section had ceviche, shrimp and crab. There were a couple of soups including gumbo and a really great mac and cheese. The carving section had beef tenderloin, brown sugar pork chops, and andouille (which I love). There was also a cajun grilled shrimp that was delicious. There were also mini danishes, croissants, and a homemade granola parfait. The desserts were wonderful- strawberry shortcake, a raspberry panna cotta, macarons, and some chocolate items I didn't get a chance to try. Just when I thought I was too stuffed to eat anything else, our awesome server showed up carrying a mango sorbet with a candle in it! They actually read all the notes on the reservation!

Looking for good seafood, then you came to the right place. The Oysters come with East and West coast varieties and are as fresh as I have had (not being on the ocean). They come with shaved horseradish and a shallot vinaigrette. Tasty!

It is also much more expensive at $64 per person.  The setting is much more intimate (smaller) but the variety is also much more limited.  

The theme is Southern Creole so hot foods were limited to shrimp & grits, gumbo and the carving station featuring thick cut bacon, beef and sausages.  

The chilled seafood featured shrimp and king crab legs.  The king crab legs is noteworthy as most others have shifted to snow crab legs.  

You can also order from a brunch menu. I had the smoke salmon Benedict. It was one of the best I've had as everything was perfect - caviar topped a perfectly poached egg with generous smoke salmon on top of a warmed moist English muffin.  I also tried the wagyu hot dog only because I've never heard of it before.  It tasted just like a hot dog. :)

What really made the experience special is the jazz band.  This small quartet played right behind the buffet station and played many classics.  A German tourist sitting next to us was using his iPhone to identify the tunes.  It was special.  

The service was also very professional.  Food orders were delivered quickly.  And dirty plates removed promptly.

The restaurant was fairly empty considering it was late lunch and the patio outside was closed due to high winds. :(

We ordered the Shrimp Cocktail to start and I loved it! Jumbo Shrimp with classic sauce mixed in with horseradish. This is a must! Very fresh!

For the main meal we ordered two burgers: a black angus sirloin and a smoked chipotle. Both came with parmesan truffle chips.

Now the burgers were both very rich and tasty. Would i say it was the best burger I've ever had? Not quite sure. I munched on the chips, but my friends really wanted the french fries. I guess they didn't realize you could substitute...

My chopped salad with ""light dressing"" came with peppers, which I tend to dislike since childhood. The strange thing is that they never mentioned them on the menu. So after they fixed my order fairly quickly I realized my salad went from ""light"" dressing no almost no dressing at all! I had to ask for extra on the side.

We decided to opt for the chefs taste of New Orleans menu. This is a sampling menu that gives you 6 courses for a fixed price. The meal started with a shrimp remoulade. This was followed by the Chef Carlos' Gumbo. The gumbo had andouille sausage, shrimp, and crawfish in the gumbo. This is Cajun style cooking so the sauce had a bit of a kick to it (not too hot, after all,  we are gringos!) Delicious! Next came the jumbo lump crab cake. It came with truffled herb salad and ravigote sauce. The presentation was very interesting. It was a small cylinder about 2 inches in diameter and an inch high. It was topped with the truffled herb salad. It was in an absolutely delicious sauce. This dish was followed by the Louisiana pecan crusted fish. It was described as jumbo lump crab meat. It was topped with a very interesting small green salad and surrounded by corn cream which was in turn was surrounded by a Creole meuniere sauce. The next course was a Creole spiced petite filet mignon. It was on top of an andouille mashed potato salad with tobacco onions and surrounded by a homemade worcestershire sauce. Wow!!

They now have a vegetarian and vegan menu.  I enjoyed a tempeh 'crab cake', quite flavorful and the fried texture on the outside was nice.  The special ham omelette was gorgeously cooked, perfectly fluffy, potatoes seasoned well and the mixed greens were dressed beautifully.  

Grab a seat outside or by the window, enjoy the view of the greens and watch the amateur golfers attempt to play golf.  It's a hoot.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,1,0,4,gibftJACcHKACgZrx562QQ

I called to make reservations and asked for a table outside. All I can say is the view was out of this world. Sitting over a golf course, near the 18th hole, which has a waterfall and gorgeous lighting on the course makes for one of the best locations for a romantic dinner in Vegas. We ordered the lamb chops and a bottle of wine. The entire evening all I could think about was what lucky lady I could bring to this restaurant next time and impress.

The poached egg was also cooked perfectly w/ the right amount of runny yolk and the hollandaise sauce was not too heavy.  My favorite part was the bacon baked biscuit it came on!

He likes jazz and live music so I didn't know of anywhere else in town that had that. Also, I wanted to try The Country Club. I love brunch and live music so I was excited. My reservation went from 4 to 7 up to the day off from family members joining. They had no problem changing the reso to a larger party. 

I previously sent the menu to my mother so she would know what to expect. I didn't know it would be a set price of $60 per person with a buffet option. I think it was because it was Father's Day. I just wish they told me that on the phone when I made the reservation. I came a little late, but even during the dining experience, I never got an explanation of the pricing and day situation, so I didn't know until the bill came.  

My mother loved the bottomless mimosas. They were on top of pouring more champagne whenever her and my Nana were finishing their glass. 

The buffet had a variety of meat, waffles, shrimp and grits, seafood, salad, etc, so it's a good variety. I didn't order off the menu because I was full after the buffet. I don't think the buffet is there normally on Sundays. 

My grandfather enjoyed the live music the most because he was familiar with the songs. My Nana sang along and applauded. 

Afterwards, we went outside on the patio to take pictures. That was my favorite part! I would suggest dressing nice and eating here mainly to take pictures outside. You can't get the background anywhere else- the large golf course with the waterfall. 

I would come back here to get a simple meal for lunch and take more pics lol.

2007719,2016-05-31,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"A perfect experience at the Country Club. We started with a cocktail at the bar, I had the Dream, Wynn's signature cocktail and hubby had a blueberry martini, both were excellent.

The hostess greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary (we had indicated that on the reservation). We were seated at a table with a lovely view of the golf course and waterfall (sadly, it was a little too windy to be seated outside) Our server, Jack, was just great -- when I asked about a wine choice to pair with the fillet, he was able to give an impressively detailed description of several choices and then let me taste a merlot blend that he suggested which ended up being just right with the filet.

We started with the shrimp cocktail, 4 large and tasty shrimp with a nice cocktail sauce. I had the fillet, cooked to a perfect medium-rare-plus, hubby had the New York strip, also medium-rare-plus and we had the mashed potato and grilled asparagus as sides. Everything was just delicious, the steaks were tender and full of flavor, the potatoes were light and tasty and the asparagus was lightly flavored with a balsamic glaze. Jack was excellent, professional and attentive, but not overly so, checking in at well-paced intervals.

We were happily stuffed so we didn't order dessert, but Jack brought us a little bowl of ice cream as an anniversary bonus, which was very nice.

We had really been looking forward to our dinner at the Country Club and it exceeded our expectations (again).

2023614,2011-09-26,1,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Unfortunately, we made the mistake of not making a reservation for dinner. After trying a coupe of other restaurants in the Wynn, we were able to get seats here. And by seats, I don't mean a table - we sat at the bar.

The bartender, though, was fantastic. Probably the best bartender service, when it comes to having a full meal at a bar, that I've ever experienced. She was able to make recommendations, really knew the menu and wine list, was great at spacing the courses, etc.

For my meal, I started with the caesar salad. It was quite sizable. But it wasn't really anything remarkable, especially for the price. It was made well and the dressing was ok. The standout was the one triangle parmesan crisp.

For an entree, I had the 9 oz. filet mignon with bernaise sauce and cajun shrimp added. Hint: The sauces are not listed on the menu, but they do offer both a bordelaise and a bernaise sauce. The steak was done perfectly and had a very nice crust on the outside. The bernaise sauce was fantastic. And the shrimp were absolutely divine. Seriously some of the best shrimp I have had anywhere in Vegas.

After all of that, there was absolutely no room for dessert. And while I knew the meal wasn't going to be cheap (and, of course, the prices were on the menu), I did suffer from a bit of sticker shock upon seeing the check. For just my part of the meal, it was $120. Now, while I loved my meal, I don't think I loved it $120 worth.

Overall, the decor and ambiance are nice, if not a little Southern and male. It definitely feels like a very upscale country club straight out of somewhere in the deep South. Since I was there in the evening, I couldn't see anything but darkness outside of the windows.

The decor was great.  I felt like I was in some kind of swanky men's only lodge and half expected there to be moose and deer carcases mounted on the wall.  It evokes old, yet masculine glamour and is furnished in maroons, dark leathers and cherry wood.  The view of the 18th hole is a fantastic compliment as well. 

Our cocktails and first courses were on the whole very good, though a few people at our table complained that their crabcakes were dry.  Mine was fantastic.  I wanted to eat like 12 more.  And in hindsight, I wish I had instead of getting the filet.  I ordered it medium rare on the side of rare.  What I got was medium and REALLY salty.  Granted, I am not a salt person.  I over season with pepper, but rarely use salt on anything, but meats being the rule.  I actually ended up scraping off the giant rocks of salt on top with my knife and enjoyed everything more (though wayy too much of it had absorbed in and compromised the quality of the meat). 

The service was also fairly spotty.  They would be extremely attentive for periods of 20 minutes or so and then be impossible to locate.  For a small party, this is unacceptable to me.

I'm only giving it 3 stars.  And I didn't pay.  If I did, I would have been far more demanding and probably would have pissed off enough that it would have been knocked down to 2 stars, because of the shitty value.",GGCHD6b1IcENHQ-pXLFYVw,0,0,3,Irj-AU4TsIYWaFeA9mAY_g

Meats, seafood, carved items, and desserts are served buffet style, and you can order a variety of dishes from the menu.  Dishes are individually prepared, and you can order as many of them as you like.  Service was very good, and everything I sampled was delicious. We had a beautiful view of the golf course and waterfall, and the jazz band played softly in the background. 

While the price point is rather high ($60 pp), it is worth it for the seafood alone. The shrimp are huge, crab is split, oysters are shucked before your eyes.  The beef tenderloin was melt in your mouth tender, and the sea bass ceviche was refreshing.   

My favorite dishes were the Bread Pudding French Toast (I could have eaten this all day- I got 2 orders), and the corn chowder. The chef advised me on how to prepare it, and it was simply delicious.  We also sampled the Shrimp & Grits and the Beef Hot Dog (it had a fancier name than that).  The grits were a creamier texture than I was used to, but oh so good.

My one complaint is that beverages are no longer included in the price. We didn't get cocktails, but $6 for a small juice adds up quickly. True, the juice was freshly squeezed, but yikes! My husband tried the watermelon juice, but didn't care for it. He sent it back after only a sip, and it was still on the bill.

I've had better, but it was not bad at all. Next time I'd get the sea bass. The service was superior  to anything I've experienced (I was with a high-roller) and we got some outstanding little-known wines from the sommelier that I've managed to hoard now that I'm home. 

After we were done, we were escorted to the north terrace at the Wynn where they have a really cool light show above a big pool. There's a different show every 30 minutes until 2:00 (am).

2178504,2011-06-02,6,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"The Skinny: picturesque ambience makes for a nice relaxing morning but the food definitely had some hits and misses(2) Service: efficient as always (4), value: given the tableside service for some items with buffet-styled appys, grilled foods and desserts, you can probably find a better deal at a buffet for $59/person (price includes live entertainment tax, juices and sodas). (2).

My hubby's been dying to try this place out for a while so we decided to give it a try. The old school Country Club air can't be beat as the restaurant overlooks the beautifully manicured 18 holed grass golf course. A live band serenades you as you marvel at this green oasis. Service is quiet and efficient which makes the experience all the more enjoyable.

That being said, the food just doesn't match up to the promise of its ambience and staff. There are two distinct components: the tableside menu (unlimited ordering) which is prepared a la minute, and the buffet consisting of grilled, cold and dessert items.

I asked the hubby what his favourite thing on the cold buffet table. He said that it was the peppercorn encrusted goat cheese with a side of the candied pecans. 'Nuff said when the best thing on the buffet is something that require little to no preparation. (FYI - they did have a plentiful cold seafood bar with fresh oysters, smoked fish, crab and ceviche. That being said, the hubs and I tend to be leery of seafood that's been sitting on a buffet table). We did try the corn chowder but found it too cloyingly sweet.

The grill offered many options including brined pork (pretty tasty), shrimp with chipotle sauce (also pretty tasty), roasted corn (tasted the same as the succotash), roasted potatoes (okay), ancho-chile encrusted turkey (dry as hell)and filet of beef (chewier than jerky).

We did sample some of the kiddie table items and they were decidedly mediocre. The slider was overly dry while the mac n' cheese was overly watery. (FYI - no fries or potato chips to go with the slider makes this a bit of a bleh! I imagine for the younger set.)

Loving pastries, I opted instead for the carb heavy items. Although the croissant was flaky, the danishes pastry did not hold up to the fruit filling. The little muffins were overly dry and unappetizing. The granola lost it's satisfying crunch after sitting too long in the yogurt/berry parfait. Major fail for a continental breakfast fiend like me.

Tableside, we ordered the BBQ pulled pork eggs benny, the French Toast Bread pudding, Chicken Paillard, Grilled Hot Dog with a side of corn succotash. 

The best was the BBQ pork eggs benny - it was literally a messy mouthful of guilty pleasure. Imagine a bacon-onion-cheese biscuit topped with BBQ pulled pork and poached egg. Then top it off with a playful chipotle hollandaise. It was pretty good but sadly the only thing we wanted to finish. All the other items were nothing we would return for sadly (corn succotash = so-so flavours with too much cream, french toast bread pudding = overly dense textural nightmare, chicken paillard = bland, grilled hot dog = dehydrated weenie with no snap and an overly large bun).

The nail on the coffin was the dessert table. Of all the desserts, I only wanted a second bite of the La Reve cake - a lovely concoction of chocolate ganache and praline crisp on the bottom. The opera cake was okay. The macaroons, the coconut cream pie, the chocolate eclair...they all had some textural issues especially with the marshmallow topping on the pie.

If you consider the AYCE tableside service, this place is a great deal. However given the hit-or-miss quality of the food you're given, it just doesn't quite live up to expectations. A 2.5 -starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,6,4,2,hdbliZR1-BTibVO3syR67g

2235913,2011-10-03,2,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"This review is for Sunday's Jazz Brunch. I'm a fan of Chef Carlos Gu√≠a and hope to come back to sample his vegan dinner menu. I know he's an amazing cook. I was very impressed with the live music and the food, but service issues took away from the overall experience. I do expect 5 star service when I dine at the Wynn, as I think everyone deserves, and not just because you're paying for it. My recent experiences have left me disappointed, with the exception of Society, where the service is always outstanding and highly recommended. 

I will start with the positive because I really did enjoy Jazz Brunch and I love the idea. The entertainment was fantastic: a jazz trio with a variety of saxophones, drums, percussion, clarinet, and maybe even an accordion, played a nice selection of Dixieland and some memorable jazz tunes. I haven't spent any time in New Orleans, but I could definitely feel the spirit! Being a bit of a woodwind geek myself, I enjoyed talking to David, the clarinetist, and finding out that we are both owners of alto clarinets, the mostly forgotten member of the clarinet family. The band performed next to the buffet table in the main dining area and later out on the patio. We had been seated in the back dining area, where the band paused for a second before continuing out onto the patio. I guess my table and another two-top didn't qualify as a crowd worth playing for. I was wishing that we had selected outdoor seating, as you enjoy a beautiful view of the Wynn golf course waterfall (with no one playing on a Sunday afternoon) with Las Vegas in the background and the patio is kept cool with a water misting system.

As for the food, this is not your average buffet. There was a station of carved meats and hot plates of delicious grilled vegetables (chayote squash, sweet red onions, fennel, peppers) and tricolored roasted peewee potatoes outside on the patio. I really enjoyed these with the mustard flavor of the creole remoulade sauce. Inside, you will find a selection of soups, salads, cheeses, seafood and tons of shellfish, a table of desserts and breakfast pastries, and a weak attempt at a table geared towards kids. Maybe children who are dragged by their parents to stuffy country clubs for a golf outing do enjoy crudit√©s, fruit and nut granola bars, and yogurt parfaits; this is not my area of expertise, but I'm sure they sip on scotch and demand the finest caviar. Fortunately, I only saw one child in the restaurant. Unfortunately, her crying was prominent in the background of the lovely jazz music. I was very impressed with the cheese selection and tasty accompaniments including fresh kiwi-strawberry jam and candied walnuts. My husband was happy with the seafood ceviche, which always makes me happy. We both enjoyed the tomato and fresh mozzarella salad. He went crazy over the croissants, and I'm a fan of the cinnamon rolls. The Le R√™ve bar was my favorite from the dessert selection; it really is a chocolate lover's dream. 

For the entree portion, your server presents you with a menu of items that you order from the kitchen. Unlimited servings are included with the brunch price. The hot food is prepared fresh instead of sitting on a buffet table. The portions are slightly larger than tasting size, but not overwhelming if you feel like sampling several options. My husband came in with a goal of trying caviar, so he ordered the eggs Versailles, the only dish featuring American caviar. He enjoyed the poached egg on brioche with smoked salmon and Hollandaise sauce, though I can say it's the first time I've ever seen him eat an egg like that. His verdict on the caviar experience? ""Salty,"" (just like I told him), but I think he liked it. I really liked the french toast bread pudding with candied walnuts and maple syrup (my second favorite dessert), as well as the sides of potato hash with roasted red peppers and onion and the tasty Southern grits-- so creamy and buttery!

I loved the food and music, but I felt let down by the service. This was not a well-attended brunch on the Sunday that I visited, but the restaurant was very well-staffed with two managers. When I asked our elusive server if it had been busy earlier in the morning, he remarked that things were just starting to pick up, around 2 pm. Two tables, really?  I saw too many servers walking around, rearranging silverware, while I gazed at my empty water glass. I fear our server was on a perpetual 15 minute break. My coffee was served just barely warm. My husband had to ask more than once for juice refills and I ended up reminding our server to bring my side of grits. Having worked in restaurants, I'm familiar with the too much partying that happens on most Saturday nights and the mentality where no one is happy to work Sunday brunch. To deliver an outstanding Jazz Brunch experience, you're just going to have to look a little more jazzed. Why not include a complimentary mimosa in the $59 price tag to give the illusion of better service?",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,5,2,4,W1pWhE-HTP7qeT1zedLJEQ
2261603,2011-12-30,4,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"I came here for lunch and I wasn't really impressed with the service here, which should have been top notch given the price.  The server completely forgot one of our dishes and didn't even bother to apologize.  The dish came out well after we were done with our meals and all we got was a, ""Here you go!""  And we still got charged for it.

Drink refills were weird, too.  The servers would refill one drink at the table at a time.  About every ten minutes or so, one lucky winner at our table would get a refill.  Not sure what was up with that system.

Other strangeness - they let in one of those salespeople who normally come door-to-door with the mangled up laminated cards.  He went table-to-table asking for money for something.  I think eventually someone realized what was going on and kicked him out.  But really, that should not even happen at a restaurant much less one of this supposed caliber.

The food was ok, nothing special.  I had the Country Club sandwich which was just a typical panini-type chicken sandwich that came with truffle potato chips that tasted like regular, old potato chips.

As an avowed fitness FANatic, I try to portion my beef intake throughout the week.  If I could only eat one piece of red meat in a MONTH, it would be the Rib Chop (bone-in) as recommended by Ryan, our attentive and informative head waiter.  Medium has never been so tasty nor has it looked as appealing as this dish did.  Perfectly grilled and if there was a rub or marinate, I couldn't tell as it was as naturally delicious as it could be.  This cut is not meant to fall apart in your mouth, but it was marbled and cut perfectly from the first bite to the very last temtation to pick up the remaining bone and do it like a goood redneck that I am.  

For sides I chose the grilled asparagus in olive oil and garlic whipped potatos.  Not so much a fan of the asparagus.  Don't get me wrong, it was tasty enough but the stalks were about half the diameter of a writing pencil.  I guess I was expecting something along the lines that I enjoyed at Morton's The Steakhouse previously.  Nevertheless, the potatos were like sipping on flavored clouds.  They were light, tasty and did not last long between the two of us.  Definitely would do these again.

My veggie partner chose the Steve Wynn special vegan menu and selected the ""Steak Salad"".   No kidding.  Vegan Gardein steak salad; succulent (that even a meat eater might mistake for ""real meat"" gardein; heirloom tomatos, fingerling potatos sat in a base of light bleu cheese vinegrette and topped with shoestring fried onions.  Mountainous plateful of pure Y U M M Y!  A complete vegan entree on a plate at a table overlooking the golf course and cascading waterfall.

I won't begin to try to remember the name of desert, also recommended by Ryan, but maybe someone will recognize the description.  It seemed like a gently deep fried pasty with melted chocolate in the center.  Forewarned to bite with a closed mouth less a chocolate spout erupt from loose lips, this was an awesome way to end a completely satisfying experience.  

As a local, I can see revisits to try some of the other interesting dishes and perhaps I'll remember what desert is next time.",59PQtA5xOOGhbb0Hj_Q4AQ,2,0,5,QV8IkwpLwd1TOfCtrdn56Q

The green grass, the flowers, the gentle roar of the waterfall, all enable you to forget that you are in one of the busiest cities on Earth.

For lunch I had the chipolte burger w/fries.  Well worth the $19.00 price tag, especially after having two of the best bloody marys in Las Vegas. (more peppary than spicy)  The service was very good as well. Very attentive and courteous.

A new addition to the C-Club offerings, from 5-7PM Wed-Sat, the place was nearly empty last Wednesday when we waltzed inside. A bit underdressed (by my standards), I was happy that we were greeted by a smiling hostess who quickly seated us at the bar. The two 'tenders were fun and not at all stuffy like you'd think one might encounter at this beautiful spot overlooking the 19th hole. (The bartender resembling Christina Applegate was especially sweet to us over the couple hours we were here.)

During HH, the bar offers Cruzan Light Rum or Skyy Vodka cocktails for $7 in addition to specialty cocktails, $7-$8, and select beers, $4. Small bites are priced from $3.50 - $8 and shared plates start at $18.

No details were overlooked. My happy hour cocktail selection was a little boring, so I decided to go with a safe bet follow-up (for me, at least) - a French 75 (definitely not on the HH menu - but I didn't care). It fizzed perfectly and the sweetness of the champagne was apparent through the gin; perfect.

The goat cheese-stuffed peppers (on the HH menu) were delicious, though very small.

The service here sets it apart. Of all the Strip spots we chose to venture in to this past week, I wrote about the Country Club first. So, that should show where it stands with me - right at the top!

We had a pre-fix menu that allowed us various options.  The Tomato & Mozzarella  appetizer was extremely tasty.  The texture was firm and was almost like eating a hearty steak.  You can never go wrong w/ the balsamic vinegar drizzled every so lightly over it w/ a crack of black pepper.

The rib eye was a fairly generous cut and was cooked to my liking.  It was nicely charred on the outside w/ a nice crisp, and despite saying that all the meat that night would be cooked 'medium', they did make mine medium rare.  It was nicely seasoned and aged well.  It was almost as good as Delmonico's . . . almost.

Overall the service was excellent and the atmosphere very quaint.  You get a great view of the golf course and depending on where you're seating you can overlook a waterfall as well.  The restaurant also has a pro-golf shop in front, however i""m sure their prices are outrageous.

A great experience, however I do think their drinks weren't worth the price.  If you're gonna pay $15 for a martini, it better give you a rush that you've never felt before.",e03iPZLuSJ5_3LY4TOp2iQ,0,0,4,0PKVSSzlesMt_cXdruzTJw

2563436,2009-10-11,2,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"WTF happened here!?  My first experience at The Country Club was in 2005 during the madness that is the SEMA show.  I was invited out by a vendor and had an amazing meal out on the veranda at a table overlooking the 18th hole waterfall.  My filet at that meal was melt-in-your-mouth delicious, the sides were scrumptious, and the wait-staff was super-professional and polite.  It was an all-out amazing meal.

Then my girlfriend and I were in town recently and decided to stop in on a lark.  We had no trouble getting reservations and the restaurant was pretty empty (our first sign that things were amiss).  The veranda was closed due to the hot weather (August in Vegas... blehck), but we were quickly seated at a nice table inside the main dining room.

After an uncomfortably long period, our waitress finally graced us with her presence to take our drink orders.  We were immediately taken back by her rudeness.  She didn't offer an apology for the long wait time and had none of the prim and proper demeanor that I had enjoyed on my first visit.  She had a ""too cool for school attitude"" and seemed skeptical of our ability to do damage to an American Express statement.  This surprised the hell out of me because we were dressed appropriately for the restaurant and because we looked like the mid-20's DINKs that we are.

Our waitress finally dropped the bitchy attitude when she discovered that we weren't there to waste her time with caesar salads and bread.  Disappointingly, our medium steaks were overcooked to a medium well/well level.  My girlfriend and I were so over the restaurant at that point that we didn't bother sending the food back.  The garlic sauteed spinach and yukon gold potatoes were very good and we just wanted to nibble at what we could and then get out.

We had ordered souffles in advance due to the time it takes to prepare, so we stayed for dessert.  The desserts were fine, but I couldn't really enjoy mine to its fullest because the rest of the experience had left me with such a bad taste in my mouth.

Honestly, this second experience at The Country Club was a total disappointment because of the horrible waitress and the sub-par steaks.  The only thing keeping me from awarding 1-star is that fact that my first dining experience was so good.

We sat out on the patio overlooking the Wynn Golf Club which was unfortunately closed for maintenance, so we couldn't watch the golfers. We didn't want to order too much, as we had a dinner reservation for later in the day at one of our favourite Las Vegas restaurants (B&B).

I had the caesar salad with shrimp, and my wife ordered the cobb salad with lump crab meat. While my salad was a very nice portion, with great caesar dressing and terrific parmesan crisps, the cobb salad set in front of my wife was simply huge! Especially after asking the waiter if the salad would be too big, we were both surprised by the size of the bowl on the table, and more surprising was that the lump crab meat was not good. It seemed to be very old and without flavour. The other ingredients were very good, but overall it was not a winning dish.

We were greeted by our friendly waiter and drink orders taken. He explained that we have the choice of buffet style as well as some entree items to order. There were 4 of us so we decided to order a few items off the entree menu to share. 

Eggs Versailles-these were ok, nothing special.

Wagyu Hot Dog- don't ask, we just figured, why not. Again, nothing special, it was just a hot dog.

Bread Pudding French Toast- I was most excited about this, but the bottom was hard as a rock. You should be able to eat french toast without using a knife. 

So we moved onto the buffet station. We all started out with the crab legs. These were so salty, 3 bites in and i couldn't even finish a leg. My friend agreed. Either they boiled them with way too much salt in the water or they were frozen.

I tried the Shrimp & Grits, these were my favorite item. They were really good.

The buffet station was really small. They had some Kumiai oysters, some peel and eat shrimp, ceviche as well as build your own bagel and lox. Some granola parfaits, as well as a small cheese/salami board. And a very small dessert area. I didn't take part in the carving station. 

For $65 a person, I expected a lot more. At least better food. I don't need an enormous selection, but at least make the food offered taste good.

Walk in, and you're greeted by a live Jazz band playing on a small stage, with the buffet portion of brunch surrounding them.  It's a relatively small buffet as far as vegas goes, but all high quality.

Brunch has 2 components - the buffet, and then a menu that you can order off that has about 10 selections which take a few minutes.  Food has a creole/cajun vibe to it.  The buffet is high end - everything from small waffles and fruits, to crab legs and oysters, to steak and thick cut bacon and other things.  The best things were the cajun things - shrimp and grits were awesome, and the gumbo and corn chowder were tasty.  

The ordering menu had things like a bbq pork eggs benedict - 1 portion, and smaller which was nice.  Also a bread pudding french toast, a mini burger, a wagyu hotdog and things like that.  It was tasty, but not insanely exceptional.

The desserts were awesome - a great selection of macaroons - which I love, cakes, puddings and such.  

The dining room was super nice, comfortable leather chairs, totally fine dining environment for brunch - unless you sat on the patio - which was blazing hot but had the misters working and a breeze.

3100352,2011-06-19,1,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"We had dinner at The Country Club last night.  It started off great with the rich decor and our server was good.  The space is very beautiful and luxurious.  Our sever sold the hell out of the menu, but the food did not deliver his promises.  I ordered a specialty Cilantro and Ginger Margarita.  It was just ok nothing special and I didn't order a second one, it was on the sweet side and tasted like margie mix although I don't think it actually had mix in it.  My husband ordered an old blue eyes which was much better than the margarita and if you love blue berries and drinks on the sweeter side it's a good one.  I ordered the Shrimp and Grits appetizers as my entree and it really was delicious.  However, everyone else ordered steaks and that's where the problems were.   One steak was extremely salty and we had to send it back.  My husbands rib eye was very tough and the third steak was also very salty. For fifty dollars a steak  you expect at least an edible well cooked steak.  We have eaten at steak houses all over the country for years and can honestly say, save your money. Skip the Country Club.  Maybe it is more of a brunch place.  I ordered the peanut butter chocolate cake with peanut butter ice cream for desert and it was just ok, wouldn't order it again  I would eat at Binion's Steak house any day of the week and pay half the price.  The quality of food is way better at Hugo's Cellar or Binion's Steak house.   To sum up, they had good service and decor, disappointing food.

3167549,2015-01-05,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Came here for an early lunch right when they opened at 11:30.  We were seated outside, which was a nice break from the indoor mayhem of Vegas, but it was extremely bright and alternated between cold and hot depending on the other diners' requests regarding the heat lamps (individual lamps couldn't be turned on and off...it was an all-or-nothing type deal).  

While the busser was quick to fill our waters and bring our bread, our server took over a half an hour to greet us.  He greeted the two tables around us, took their drink orders, then their food orders, but failed to come over to us even once.  Did we smell weird?  Did he not like my outfit?  We finally got our order taken once the other tables were already being served.  And I couldn't possibly have done anything worse than the girl at the next table who demanded to know where the bread was baked and needed a visual comparison of soup portions, so I think the server just wasn't particularly good at juggling more than one table.

I ordered off the vegetarian menu.  I love that they have extensive vegan/vegetarian menus at all of the Wynn restaurants, and in most cases the food is delicious.  Sadly this was my one exception to that rule.  While the corn chowder I had to start was really tasty - sweet and light with a few roasted veggies and tortilla strips for texture - the main dish I had, the gardein steak salad, was salty and overdone.  The bread was good - really liked these parmesan flatbreads in the basket.  

The view was nice - right up against the golf course with a waterfall at one of the holes.  However the reflective table made it a little too blinding to be sitting out there.",2C8pij4QASB2oHS9gvaUEA,0,0,3,NauM89s8RlFsjzkTVokFeQ

The restaurant--particularly the tables towards the back (and, I would imagine, the patio, though it was closed at the time)--also features a spectacular view of the Wynn Golf Course's 18th green and waterfall.

The Field Green Salad was very good, with large, fresh, crunchy greens covered in a relatively subtle vinaigrette.  I also very much liked the bread--the olive roll and (especially) the multi-grain roll more than pulled their weight as lunch accompaniments.  I was less enthused with the Shrimp and Grits.  At least in my opinion, the shrimp should be fully de-shelled.  The sauce provided a little bit of spice, but the grits themselves seemed overcooked or over-processed.  The dish as a whole seemed a bit removed from the Southern classic.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,0,0,3,IN-6GAYlFUylBDVFUhs68A

One of the best places I have ever eaten at, and that's saying something. Atmosphere, service, food...it all works.

We showed up early for 8:30 reservations and were seated immediately. Foregoing wine (since we had come directly from Parasol Up) we ordered cocktails and appetizers to start. The wife had a martini, while I had an Island Mule, which was basically a Moscow Mule with rum instead of vodka. Both were large and delicious. The appetizers were as well. I had the selection of heirloom tomatoes with a basalmic reduction, while the wife had the crab cake with aoili. We shared liberally and were quite pleased. For entrees, she had the free-range chicken, while I opted for the chili-rubbed flat-iron Wagyu steak. As a side, we split the bacon/corn concoction.

What can I say? That steak was one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth. The side was delicate and unbelieveably flavorful. The bacon didn't overpower the garden-fresh corn at all. The chicken was good as well, but what can you really do with chicken?

For dessert, we decided on the ice cream trio and Grand Marnier Cuvee di Cent Cinquantenaire. Chocolate, vanilla and peanut butter ice creams and one of the most generous pours of GM I've ever seen. The perfect end to a perfect meal. It helped that it was a Wednesday, which means the place was very lightly attended.

3462234,2012-09-19,1,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"When we made brunch reservations at Country Club, I had no idea what it would be like. I had walked through the restaurant a couple of years ago (or whatever was in the space then) and knew it had a striking view of the golf course. Therefore, being a big fan of atmosphere, I knew brunch there would be great. I was right.

It was a Sunday New Orleans-style brunch buffet. We were seated immediately due to our reservation, which felt really good as we walked by the loooooooong lines for the regular Wynn Buffet and casual dining restaurant.

ATMOSPHERE: I love the atmosphere - it really does feel like the country club brunch somewhere else. The view from the patio/windows is of the waterfall and greenery of the Wynn golf course - very nice. The Sunday brunch was accompanied by fantastic live music, which added to the fun, bright morning feel.

FOOD: The food was delicious. During the brunch, you can order off of the regular menu and/or eat from the buffet. The New Orleans buffet (not sure if this is a regular Sunday occurrence or a special event) was heavy on oysters, shrimp, etc., but if that isn't your thing, there is plenty else to dine on. The desserts are extensive - so be sure to save room. The shrimp and grits is good, but very heavy, of course.

DRINKS: Bottomless mimosas is what our table went with - yum. But, not worth the $35 price tag if you aren't going to be there for a while.

SERVICE: Our server was excellent - treated us well for our birthdays, explained the entire brunch process to us, and had a generally upbeat attitude for a Sunday morning. And, of course, other servers were more than happy to take a group photo from the patio with the waterfall in the background.

TIPS: Make a reservation. Don't purchase the bottomless mimosa unless you and your dining buddies are going to be there a long time. Consider sitting at the bar with friends for bottomless mimosas if there's a football game on TV you are wanting to watch. If the weather is cool, ask to sit on the patio - don't try it if it's really hot. If you are having a birthday, free gelato is the treat (yum!). Be sure to take a photo of your group from the patio with the waterfall in the background.",lCCE9bD5Z833Wm0q-TEMHw,6,2,4,aHdhNdNHXu_0uaAnqngQ0g

We expected the food to take awhile to come out, especially at this type of restaurant, but it took FOREVER for the food.  dinner lasted 4 1/2 hours.

After reading all the positive Yelp reviews about it being ""the best kept secret in Vegas"" I was expected to be floored. This was not the case with both service and food.

Waitress was a little uppity. Now, considering I've been to Joel Robuchon, CraftSteak, Mix, etc. all with PRISTINE service I was pretty surprised when a waitress at some non-Michelin rated restaurant was giving me attitude. I mean, once she saw that we ordered appetizers, drinks, entrees, and desserts, THEN she started giving us respect. But just the insinuation that I'm somehow lesser because I'm young is just too much (particularly, in this city).

Lovely drinks - had the Beyonce cocktail and the boy had the Sinatra (with fresh crushed blueberries). Could slurp them down all night.

Had the surf & turf and filet. Both were overcooked (we asked for medium) and just so-so. Admittedly, I'm overwhelmingly pro-Wagyu but still, I expected more. Dessert was pretty good - had the blueberry cobbler which was super warm and gooey... yum.

I looked at the menu before coming and knew he would like the Bison ribeye. We were greeted by the hostess with ""We don't allow children under age 5"" as soon as she saw my son. This I already knew but my son is 5 1/2 so I wasn't worried. Maybe she should have asked instead of assumed. Unfortunately they really have nothing for kids except for a hot dog which my son didn't want so he ended up eating French fries. Not that they needed a kids menu or anything but there really isn't much on the menu a small child would want. The wild caught shrimp cocktail for $21.00 had no flavor and didn't taste fresh. The cocktail sauce tasted better. The salmon was cooked perfectly but the dish itself was a plain. Good but plain. My husband liked the bison ribeye but the selection of side orders were unappealing so all he had was the ribeye. I don't think we'll be back. I enjoyed Sinatra at encore much more.

3994019,2013-06-10,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"I tried this steakhouse for the first time last Saturday (6/8/13). It was solid, not standout. (I have heard that it is Steve Wynn's favorite restaurant, but my guess is that has to do with location in the casino.)

I ordered the steak special, which was a black-truffle coated filet. It was cooked perfectly and the seasoning was really good! It had a few too many breadcrumbs for my taste - I would have preferred more of the truffle taste and less crunch. I also tried the rack of lamb - also really good. The foie gras appetizer was a standout, on top of a brioche, and we also loved the carpaccio. Overall, all of the food was really good, but we just didn't think it was extremely unique or super-special (which would have bumped it up to 5 stars).

Ambiance is exactly what you would expect - the old school slightly sterile country club feel. It's not the ambiance I prefer for a restaurant, but they definitely achieved what I'm sure they were going for. Service was very nice (they brought us a few freebies), but pretty slow, especially for a very uncrowded place.

I would happily go back, but probably wouldn't be the one to suggest it. What I am excited to try is the Sunday jazz brunch, which I have heard is really great!!",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,3,0,4,xbULofo6UVrYdv8Y1X0_1A

4047999,2011-02-26,1,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"THE MOST PICTUREQUE PLACE FOR BRUNCH ON THE VEGAS STRIP!!!

Among the hustle and bustle of the Vegas Strip lies The Country Club whose quaint atmosphere overlooks a lush green golf course with a breath-taking waterfall which sets the stage for the perfect brunch.

On Friday, 12.10.10, my friend and I came to The Country Club for lunch at about 12:30 PM. We didn't have reservations but were promptly seated.

As I mentioned in my previous review, I'm just now catching up to some of my Vegas reviews since I'm at home sick (still recovering from my most recent Vegas trip last week).  People often ask me how I manage to write detailed reviews. While I would like to say, I have a good memory, I heavily rely on my notes. Yes, you will often find me typing away on my BB at a restaurant.

F O O D: 
*AUSTRALIAN KOBE BEEF CARPACCIO ($19): MEH!
The copious toppings of sundried tomatoes, mushrooms, arugula, pine nuts and shaved reggiano ruined the integrity of the thinly sliced melt-in-your-mouth kobe. The carpaccio was also drenched in olive oil and was missing a citrus component to balance out the richness.

*OPEN FACED COUNTRY CLUB FRENCH DIP w/ Parmesan Truffle Potato Chips ($22): OMFG, A MUST ORDER!!!
A thick toasted brioche was slathered with mustard cream and piled high with shaved prime rib, melted gruyere cheese and crowned with fried crispy onions. The French dip was served with side of au jus and parmesan truffle potato chips.

As I cut into the sandwich, I could hear the crunch of the onions and feel the softness from the prime rib and melted cheese. The first bite, I thought I had died and gone to heaven! The brioche was crunchy, soft, and buttery and was the perfect canvas to the tender and soft prime rib. The gruyere added a creamy and nutty richness, the fried onions a crunchy texture contrast while the tang from the mustard cream help cut through some of the richness. Each bite was packed with bold flavors and a combo of textures so there was really no need for the au jus. It did  help to soften each bite and add a layer of beefy goodness though.

Ohh the Parmesan Truffle Chips...
Fresh out of the fryer, the chips were like warm kettle chips; thin, crisp and crunchy with a subtle woodiness from the truffle oil and salty savoryness from the cheese. I wanted to devour the entire basket in one setting, but I knew I had to exercise some sort of self-control. 

S E R V I C E:
DISAPPOINTING!

With all the reviews praising the excellent service at The Country Club, I had much higher expectations especially for a restaurant of this caliber. Upon seating, it took 5 minutes before even being acknowledged and another 5 minutes to get water. When we were ready to order, we had to hunt down our waiter and once we ordered he went MIA. 

To make matters worse, we watched table after table who got seated AFTER us get their food and bill before we ever got our entrees. Fyi, the restaurant was probably at 25-30% capacity at most with several wait staff lingering around.

My friend became frustrated and informed the Manager on duty who offered her sincere apologies and offered to comp our appetizer which was a nice gesture. You would think this would give our waiter a ""reality check"" to up his game, but after he served our entrees (took 40 minutes after ordering), he was nowhere to be found again when we wanted to pay our bill.

A M B I A N C E / D E C O R:
Quaint, Classy and Breath-taking! If it weren't for the beautiful ambiance/d√©cor, I would not have been so generous with my rating.

The main dining room of The Country Club is reminiscent of someone's living room with plush furnishings, a fireplace, wine shelves and huge pane windows that overlook a lush green gold course with a stunning waterfall. I highly recommend requesting to be seated outside on a warm sunny day so you can take advantage of the gorgeous views.

In most cases, if the food is good, I can be forgiving on the service (like in this case).  

If you're looking for a quaint and intimate place for brunch where the food is scrumptious and the ambiance is stellar, look no further, go FORE The Country Club!",eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg,2,2,4,cCuqef6PQbX1-FoWlPpy2g
4048062,2010-04-05,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Amazing!  Where do I begin?  Okay, first off, my lady friend and I arrived around 11 AM for an early lunch.  Essentially, during the day, The CC serves as the Club House for the Wynn Golf Course.  We got a great seat, indoors, with a fantastic view of the Wynn golf course 18th green with waterfall in full effect.  It was a beautiful blue skied February day, but there was a pervasive chill in the air.   Somehow the two of us were wearing black, our napkins were white and I'm assuming, for fear of getting lint on her gorgeous black suit, my friend declined to lay her napkin in her lap.  I, on the other hand, am slovenly and forgot...kidding of course...you know that though, right?  Hmmm...I digress...this is not about me.  Okay, so, without even asking, our wonderful lady server brought us both black napkins!!!  Telepathy a prerequisite skill or what?!  Okay, that was just the first of her Kreskinesque moments of superlative service.   The other was; I don't know, I may have mentioned my Gurl's high beams were on; as the restaurant was a lil chill.  Without saying a word, an orange box appeared on our table and Wonder Woman pulled out a brand new cashmere stole and placed over my Gurl's shoulders!!!  WE DIDN'T SAY A THING TO HER...she just Nike'd it...Just do it!  Wow!  We joked about dinin' and dashin' for fashion...  At least I was jokin'.  My gurl, I'm not so sure.

Okay, so I sense that you get that the service was impeccable so let's talk about the chow now.

I had a burger and fries.  It was perfect like you were at a fancy restaurant and they did the basics amazingly well.  I wish they had fish and chips.  I'm certain they would have been the best ever.  

I hope this helps.  I appreciate excellent service and frustrated by poor service, so this place gets the whole enchilada from me.  Woohoo!  As good as it gets!

The location of the Club is at one of the far end wings of the Wynn that over looks a gorgeous golf course and waterfall, the interior is sharp and refined and very well manicured and is a perfect setting for a brunch which i certainly will partake in very soon. Seated quickly with an 8:30pm reservation i was surprised to see that the entire dining room was full but is a great indicator that the food is worth the price tag  that some others are mentioning. The entrees that hit my table this night were the Sea Bass, Free Range Chicken, and a Red Snapper special all of which were very well prepared and portioned in a way to make sure you will not be leaving hungry from this location (ala Eiffel Tower Restaurant). Entrees were served with nice accenting sides for example my chicken came with the mushroom bread pudding that i could have eaten a whole bowl of personally. Im not a big fan of dining at a location where everything is a'la carte like many higher end restaurants so this sides were a big plus. But there are also additional sides that can be ordered to have along side your already amazing meal and i will say that these small dishes are just as incredible as your entrees. I dont even like grits and the shrimp and grits i used bread to clean my dish, the succotash made with smoked bacon was ridiculous and had such a great flavor from that smokiness. Every time a new plate hit the table i couldnt wait to try it because i was confident that it would be exceptional. 

Dessert, whoa! there were two one being a chocolate nutella cake of sorts that i cant even remember what it was called but man was is rich but incredibly good and the perfect way to end a meal. Followed with something i never had before Beignet's with a creamy caramel sauce, came with 6 of them, light and fluffy and just a touch of sweetness. What i meal! The chef has put together a fantastic well rounded menu here and the management obviously has a great team behind them to offer service that is second to few on the Vegas strip.

One is the buffet part. It's not a ginormous buffet like other places, but everything there is such high quality and delicious. I ate everything I took!  I got the crab legs and prime rib. Delicious. The bread selection is outstanding, cheddar biscuit and cranberry sourdough and Parmesan stick and French epis. The sushi was so fresh and tasty, not like other buffets.  They make waffles for you. They are smaller ones and they will put all kinds of toppings. They have them ready so not a long wait. Wow!  They are so light and crispy!  These were some of the best waffles I've ever had!

Then.... you can also order off menu, as much as you want. If I wanted 10 wagyu beef hot dogs, I could order 10. And wow, these hot dogs were amazing. The bread was soft and toasted. The dog was tasty. And the toppings looked simple, but were delish!  I also ordered the poached eggs oscar. It was just ok. I saw others get the omelet and sliders they looked awesome too. 

The dessert area was great. They had Swedish fish and gummy bears!  I went for the strawberry shortcake and key lime tart. I could've eaten five of each they were that good. Many times the buffet desserts are just average but these were outstanding. Light. Not overly sweet. Tasty. 

Drinks are included and I had coffee and OJ. They had bottomless alcohol and I'm sure it would've been delish, but we skipped this time.

They have a Kobe beef carpaccio infused with a garlic truffle oil on the appetizer menu that is truly remarkable. ($21.00)

Yes, prices are on the high side, like all Wynn restaurants, with the chicken, my steakhouse bellwether at about $38.00.  Sides run about $8.00 average.

It's in an absolutely gorgeous room. Somewhat of a large study - rich mahogany wood and comfortable lounge couches, and a bar that I could sit at and watch sports all day long.

The food was very good - a BBQ Cheeseburger that was massive and delicious. The chips were a mix of baked and fried; bottom line was, they weren't so great. Nice, fresh deli pickle, though, so points for that! We didn't have to wait very long at all to be served, but a group of women at the table next to us seemed very fidgety while we ate; turns out they were waiting for their food to be delivered the entire time while we were seated, served and ate. And all they ordered was breakfast food - I would have been upset as well.

On the way out, we were bid adieu by the mait're de, a robotic, ""Thanks for coming, have a nice day"" without even looking at us. Same kind of treatment on the way in. Maybe she was having a bad day. Either way, I doubt the Wynn would be pleased by her attitude.

It's the second time we eat there, And we didn't complain because we wanna try again and we never return plates if we don't like them. 
We ordered a Kosher Rib eye. Medium - well. 
The steak was bloody and raw inside. They didn't put enough seasoning and salt and the meat had a bad taste.  It has a taste like old steak that was seating there for months. Tasted like de-frozen steak. 

We eat 2 times a week , at least, At SW steakhouse. We order the same Kosher Rib eye and they make it perfect. They know what medium well means, they know when and how much to add seasoning and the meat is fresh, every time.",ojm3HCwqtj8-ynJapABuTQ,0,0,1,V0Wm_7wC7l-0Gv92WbjAvw

The Jazz Brunch at the Country Club has set the new gold standard for me regarding brunch buffets.  The ambiance was gorgeous.  Dark wood, warm decor, soft carpeting and chairs.  The view of the golf course was breath-taking.  The service was attentive and courteous.

The live jazz band was terrific playing lively upbeat tunes that was not too loud for conversation.

But let's get to the food.  The rest wouldn't matter if the food is not good.  Luckily, it was spectacular.  The start of the buffet has fresh backed goods, made to order waffles with your choice of toppings including bananas foster, mixed berries, dark bittersweet chocolate chips.  I could have had 4-5 of these.  I settled on two.  The house made cinnamon buns were awesome.  The bagels and smoked salmon were also terrific.  The salads presented a number of options including an iceberg wedge with blue cheese and bacon. As good as any steakhouse salad I have had.  The roasted vegetables were fresh.  The seafood table had huge cocktail shrimp and crab legs.  All very fresh and as good as anything I could get on the East Coast.  Then, there was a huge carving station with ham, bacon, and beef with a variety of sauces.  Finally, the desserts included french macaroons, cake pops, tortes, and handmade caramels.

My wife and I made two big runs at the buffet and were so satisfied.  We will definitely be back.  A note: the jazz buffet is actually a very good value for your money if you come with an appetite!",J7sOFHpKmQWlcsxf0dO2TQ,4,1,5,OFOdWo4Z8hotABNKEFOKNg
4567310,2016-10-26,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Beautiful country club restaurant inside the Wynn resort, overlooking the lush green golf course with a majestic waterfall.  I booked a reservation for the Sunday Live Jazz Brunch. What a delight that was! 

I originally booked a table for four, but two in my party canceled due to a massive hangover from the night before, in honor of her 50th birthday. That's Vegas for ya! The Wynn was still very accommodating with our table for two instead. 

We were seated by the window with a full view of the waterfall and lush greens.
Everything was on point from the food, service, the atmosphere, the music and incredible view!!  You can go with the buffet spread which consists of fresh seafood, carving station, salad bar, bagels, pastries, delightful desserts and a made to order waffle station. Or you can order off of the brunch menu. Both options are all you can eat. I recommend the french toast bread pudding with smoked apple wood bacon. They also offer a bottomless Bloody Mary or Mimosa/champagne drink option for an additional price. 

The jazz trio is great! A talented group of elderly musicians playing toe-tapping jazz favorites, along with well known classics. Gives a nice classy nostalgic feel to the country club atmosphere! A true elegant and sophisticated ambiance. 

Our waiter Jack was great. Jack was always checking up on us and making sure all of our dining needs were met. I never ran out of coffee and his recommendation of the Eggs Oscar and shrimp and grits was excellent. His services were above and beyond our expectations. He even offered to be our photographer and went outside to take pictures of us at the waterfall patio. 

I highly recommend the Country Club at Wynn. A great place to escape from the  ""sin city"" atmosphere and straight into paradise heaven!",82kxXl_1K8M3cU66dhB8lw,2,0,5,ELG6bacpqJaHLDQ7IRekRg

While the Wynn offers other several great restaurants the country club is a great lunch spot. 

It's down the way from Stratta and if you're wearing a tank top and sandals you'll have to change as I found out.

Jay recommended a bottle of red wine but it was horrible, so bad that it shouldn't even be listed on the wine menu at this venue.

Let's talk about food. I asked for a medium cooked rib chop but it was beyond medium-rare. I tried to flag down our server but he was always busy with other tables and by the time he came by, I lost appetite looking at the plate of blood.

The service! I can't believe I actually was dining in a restaurant at the Wynn. Why? Because the service was so horrible and quite irritating. It was probably the most terrible experience that I have ever encountered from a restaurant on the strip. After a year later to come back and try it again, the service was still horrible. We sat down for at least 15 minutes before the waitress decided to take our drink orders after she passed by our table four times. She saw us sitting down too. She was somewhat rude and rough as she switched our plates and such as well. Thank goodness our busboy Jorge was great and pleasant to make our brunch a bit better. 

The food. Meh. I'm highly disappointed on their updated brunch menu. I enjoyed the pulled pork Benedict, porkloin and shrimp and grits from the brunch menu last year. Unfortunately, they took all of those out. Nothing was memorable today from either buffet tables or the menu.

As we walked through the Wynn on Friday afternoon, we intended to simply look at the menu but ended up eating here instead.  We walked in about 12:30pm and were seated almost right away.

FOOD:
*Kobe Beef Carpaccio ($19) - Not a fan.  Thin slices of raw beef were placed on a platter and pine nuts, arugula leaves, diced shitake mushrooms, and slices of parmesan cheese placed on top.  My friend mentioned that the carpaccio was one of the highlights on Yelp, but how could you taste the beef with all the additional ingredients?

*Crab Salad Entr√©e Special ($31) - Ok, normally I would not pay this much for a salad but in my defense, it was the daily special not on the menu and I wasn't warned about the pricing.  To be honest, there was nothing special about this salad.  It contained green and roman lettuce, fresh crab meat, avocado, sundried tomatoes, blue cheese, egg, bacon with a honey mustard dressing.  Tip: the salad entrees are big and easily split between two people.

SERVICE:
Pretty bad and nonexistent.  Again, people on Yelp mentioned outstanding and great service, but I didn't notice it.  When we sat down, we were given menus and our waiter disappeared for 10-15 minutes.  It took about 30 minutes for us to get our food.  The table next to us had sat down after us and had ordered and finished their food before we got ours.  I did complain to our waiter about our food taking a really long time to come out and he sent the manager over.  The manager said that our waiter was concerned that our food took a really long time (excuse me, but I'm the one that had concern, not him) and she had comped our carpaccio appetizer.

The food quality is great, but it IS a small selection.  Carving station (5-6 meats), a small salad station, and a few hot items (shrimp & grits).  They also offer entrees from a small menu.  If your kids are the standard pizza or burger type of kids, there wasn't really anything for kids other than a hot dog from the menu.  The dessert selection was small, but beautiful and very good.

The atmosphere was very relaxing and romantic however our server is another story. From the second he greeted us he was rude and spoke to us as if we were children.

First, there is the buffet full of prime rib, jumbo shrimp, grits, crab legs, pork, gumbo, etouffee..., and the list keep going. Second, there is the menu which I recall having better that a half dozen items a la cart.
My wife and I have even seen Steve Wynn eating here.

Make this your one indulgence if you're limited to just one.",CCuXN_e_whCuOU5ea1TJ7g,2,1,5,1NdzGI1a_OZZpvHXweyiyw

I ordered the butter poached crab legs from Alaska for appetizers. I had lobster and my husband had wagyu ribeye steak with sides of snap peas and squash and cream corn. We topped everything with their flourless chocolate cake with marshmallow ice cream and caramel on top. I always make sure i stop eating before I'm too full but everything is irresistible I was more than satisfied on our way out. Our server was very knowledgeable and accommodating. Of course everything was pricey, but it's worth every penny. :)",1-oOhcs8XbFSfS-Q2e7QPw,0,0,5,xjfudN2ry_fPqMndqHpWWg

Really, I imagine that if anyone would know what a Country Club should look like it is probably Steve Wynn....either him or Jack Nicklaus.  Calling ahead for reservations for three we were told they were mostly booked but had a four-top available at 1:30. Standing up and walking to the windows I looked out over the amazing 18 holes of greenery that Mr. Wynn had built in the middle of the desert - quite possibly the most impressive ""architecture"" in the Wynn empire.

We made our way to our table and were met by our witty and surprisingly down-to-earth and casual server.  Explaining some of the daily specials while handing us our menus the waiter quipped about his favorite dishes, the design of the restaurant, Chef Guia's culinary pedigree, and the multiple celebrities who'd sat in our very seats - Bill Murray and Michael Jordan to name a few.  While clearly intending to impress I actually found our waiter to be a pretty genuine individual throughout our meal - something a bit different for ""Wynn service"" which is normally a bit starchy and unapproachable.  
 
Sitting and chatting for a little while we were soon brought refills of our waters and diet cokes and a large basket of bread - fresh from the oven.  Served with a soft and fragrant butter the bread itself was almost a cross between a brioche in density and a soda bread in texture.  With a lovely crunchy crust giving way to a soft and buttery center we devoured the first basket before our appetizers even arrived and ended up finishing a second basket before the mains were completed.  

For Matt and myself why not get a sweet for one course and a savory for the other?  For an appetizer, the French Toast Bread Pudding with Vermont Maple Syrup, Berries, Candied Pecans, Glazed Bacon - essentially two large English-muffin sized pieces of custard laden and smooth maple bread pudding stacked and surrounded with fresh berries and candied pecans - then topped with a slice of thick and perfect maple glazed bacon.  Honestly - no offense to Thomas Keller's similar option at Bouchon - but this was better.  A m√©lange of vanilla and maple, cinnamon and butter, and crispy exterior yielding a custard-like interior - it could've been breakfast, it could've been dessert - and it was one heck of an appetizer.

After a wait, more talk, more fries, and more coffee our mains arrived.  For myself, Two large organic poached eggs with BBQ Smoked Pork, Bacon Cheese Muffins, and Charred Green Chile Hollandaise.  Somewhat ""Tex Mex"" but also at the same time as refined as a traditional Benedict it is hard to say what aspect of this dish was most appealing - the maple-heavy pulled pork, the creamy poached eggs, the spicy hollandaise with only mild hints of sour, or those indelible English muffins.  Rupturing the eggs and allowed the dish to flood with a combination of creamy and spicy, sweet and savory I have to say the result wasn't as pretty as the presentation, but the flavor was fantastic.

For dessert our waiter recommedned the Bombolone for dessert and stated it was one of his five favorite dishes in Vegas.  Taking him on his word I agreed and approximately 15 minutes later the dishes arrived.  Entitled Chocolate Bombolone with Brioche Donuts, Berries, Creme Anglaise, and Chocolate Sauce the dish was simple - five 72% dark chocolate truffles dipped in brioche batter and deep fried only long enough to brown the outside and liquefy the center paired with a smooth vanilla anglaise, fresh berries, and a hefty dark chocolate sauce.  What the dish lacked in complexity, however, it more than made up for in flavor.  Instructed to place the whole bite into my mouth before chewing each bite simply burst forth with chocolate on masticating.  Small in portion the richness of the chocolate was a perfect way to end a great meal and any more would have likely been too decadent to finish.

Sitting and chatting for another half hour before our departure our drinks were continually refilled and our server occasionally stopped by to be sure all was well.  Never rushed as it was the end of the brunch service I was impressed at how laid back such a refined restaurant felt - it really did feel like a ""member's only"" club where people were welcome to socialize as long as they like.  Very happy with the meal and the uncharacteristically casual feel of a Wynn-core enterprise I have to say that aside from Bouchon, the Country Club may be my favorite mid-day meal in Las Vegas.  A great view, great service, great company, and most importantly - great food - definitely a meal worth a day away from Bouchon's breakfast.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,8,8,5,G0E4YvUIO7M8JzXsMuybZQ

Do NOT eat here if you are looking for a nice holiday turkey dinner. It was one step above cafeteria food. The cornbread stuffing (usually my fave part of the meal) could not possibly have had more onion flavor, it was not fit for human consumption. I think when the chef was sprinkling the onion powder in it, the lid fell off and dumped the whole container. Seriously. The whipped sweet potatoes had a strange waxy, processed quality, if I hadn't been starving I wouldn't have eaten them at all. The turkey was decent, but not unlike what you would get in a school cafeteria. The cranberry sauce had a yucky vinegar quality. I'm almost never impressed with the restaurants at the Wynn and the Country Club was no exception. Our food was so bad, we actually skipped dessert, which is something I NEVER do, especially on Thanksgiving.",6M3JpBXoCAXff38xjPJmAw,0,0,2,bZyJvlH9zONPwUSUoeDzHw
5366862,2012-09-11,2,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Not great. We went here for Sunday jazz brunch expecting something spectacular, we were highly disappointed! 

The food wasn't very good or at least not up to the standard they set for themselves. The buffet was probably the smallest I've seen especially in Vegas. The selection was boring and again small. You walk in and literally touching the hostess stand is the start of the buffet. It goes around this area that encloses the band (jazz). There is a very small fruit selection. No salad. There is shrimp, salmon, mussels and a few dipping sauces. Then you turn the corner and there is a soup, Mac and cheese, mini burgers, some kind of cooked spinach with sun-dried tomatoes and then a carving station. 

The meats are pretty good, but nothing else is. Then you turn the corner for the dessert. The desserts aren't very good at all. Rather dry and flavorless. We then say down to an additional menu where each item is made (assembled) to order. I ordered one of each just to try them. Nothing was,again, very good. The bacon was over cooked and must have been cooked off hours ago (it was 1030 and the place opens at 10). The eggs were under cooked and slimy. The French toast was pretty good. It came with a carmely sauce. The guy told me the orange juice was fresh squeezed... No it wasn't!  

It cost a party of four $300 for brunch. It was a waste of money! I would rather have brunch anywhere else. I know it isn't the big buffet they have so I was expecting the best of the best the Wynn could offer for a buffet and was sadly disappointed! Steer clear of this place!!",GSTf4SKV1HjZBfWFapea0Q,1,0,2,4rnvSBlyZOrL9Z_pkp44Aw

Entree: Tossed Cobb Salad, Prime Sirloin Steakhouse Salad- Both salads were great. They were crisp and had the freshest ingredients. The steak was seasoned to perfection.

5383739,2013-03-19,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"I went here with my Dad and two uncles this past Friday during my first trip to Las Vegas and it was easily the best meal of the weekend. Everything we ordered was excellent. My Dad and I had the prime rib chop, one of my uncles had a butterflied NY strip, and the other had the gumbo and chunks of the rib chop from both my Dad and I. They also ordered salads as appetizers, which came in huge bowls and were said to be very good. The highlight of the night, however, was the rib chop. It was perfectly charred, extremely flavorful, and melted in your mouth. The sides we ordered were good as well: roasted potatoes, creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and wild mushrooms.  

Food aside, the view from the outside seating area alone makes this place really special. I've never had as good a view while eating dinner as I had at the Country Club. The view of the 18th hole of the Wynn course with the waterfall behind the green made for a very picturesque scene. I played the course the next day and it was an awesome layout with stunning views and very lush grass.

Our waitress, Mary, was top notch. The way she described the food could make you want to order everything due to the saliva-induced thoughts of how good they would be. She answered all of our questions and routinely checked in on us to see how we were doing. We had told her in passing that it was one of my uncle's birthday the following Sunday and she brought out two desserts on the house! One was a cheesecake with a raspberry glaze on top in a small cup, and the other was a chocolate mousse cake. I couldn't manage a bite because I was too full from dinner, but my Dad and uncles enjoyed both of them and polished them off. 

All four of us loved this place and had a great time dining here. We will deinitely eat here again if we ever make our way back to Las Vegas, and we will make sure to request Mary as our waitress because she did an excellent job.",CqzxAgS3JHCTlbR5Aouzqw,2,1,5,FU0_iDozMQ_4N-YSC1EFKQ
5387303,2015-04-27,2,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Country Club Sunday Brunch, oh how I do love to love you.  This is currently my favorite brunch pick in Vegas.  From atmosphere to food quality to service, it doesn't get any better than this spot.

Enjoy a day of luxury for all of the senses.  You have a choice in seating.  If the weather is nice you can soak in the sunshine for your Vitamin D fix and enjoy the lush Wynn golf course and waterfall.  My personal favorite is the inner dining area by the bar where you have full listening pleasure to the live New Orleans jazz band that plays from behind the food service area.  The dining room evokes a sense of warmth and relaxation with its rich color palette and intricate wood walls.

The food variety isn't as wide as some of the competitor brunches, but the food quality is consistently high across all items.  The is a a self serve area that includes (but not limited to) smoked salmon, asparagus, beet salad, shrimp, oysters, crab legs, shrimp & grits, gumbo, carving station, cheese station, and desserts.  They also have a rotating menu of items that you can order directly from your server.  Out of the the ordering items, our favorite is the Egg Versailles, which includes a poached egg and smoked salmon topped with hollandaise and caviar, all set atop a small piece of brioche.  It's a great way to go ahead and check off your savory fix for the week.  The combination of flavors and textures make it such a worthwhile splurge.  

Being a Southern girl, one of my all time favorite guilty pleasures is shrimp & grits, but for some reason they taste even better than I remember them HERE.  Honestly I could eat those buttery, indulgent grits on their own, but the shrimp scores a home run.  Don't forget to visit the carving station; they have offer some top notch cuts with the dry aged steak selection in our top pick.  In the cheese section, they offer fruit/compote pairings that are absolutely phenomenal.  

They offer a cucumber mignonette sauce for their oysters, which tasted odd to me.  When I requested the standard mignonette, they were very accommodating.  They said it would take some time, but it arrived on the table in under 3 minutes.  Fantastic service! 

And the other most important thing, the bubbles!  (This girl's best friend)  They offer a choice on bottomless bubbles.  There is the ""Veuve Clicquot Champagne Infinite"" option @ $50pp or a classic Ros√© Sparkling Wine @ $25pp.  

Last but not least, plan in advance.  This brunch is very popular.  You must make reservations and it is near impossible to call and get reservations on the same day.  Last seating is 2pm.",KmBPYlD00BupKSwWxOWA6w,6,2,5,xm_jKQxSYX4P2jC5ULbEBQ

I actually found this place by accident- I originally had a reservation at the steakhouse at the Palms, but my flight was late and I couldn't make it in time. So my boyfriend and I decided to call the Wynn and eat at the steakhouse their. The lady on the phone was so nice, friendly, and helpful. She said that the SW steakhouse was booked, but the Country Club was a great alternative. We booked the reservation, and were so pleased.

We were greeted with a smile and were seated promptly. Our waiter gave us the best service we've ever had (and we are very critical :) ).  The fondue was very good and the wine list was extensive. Our steaks were cooked to perfection. 

It just so happend that Steve Wynn himself was dining outside that evening.  The entire Wynn hotel has fabulous service and is not snooty at all.

5401165,2017-05-01,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"This review is for the Sunday jazz brunch. I will start by saying that I read many reviews before going. I think this helped. The other thing to say is that your experience depends on where you are sitting because that will decide on how your service is, due to the waiters that will be attending to your table.
The cons: The first time we went to brunch, we sat outside. The service was not very good and we asked to sit inside. The service was way better. Today, we sat right by the jazz band. It was way too loud to have a conversation and the service was just so-so.
Pros: The jazz is great but I would recommend sitting away from the band in order to be able to have a conversation. It was fun and lively and the band was very very good. The food: delicious. You have to come hungry. I would recommend not eating anything until you get there. There are two components to the brunch: the first is the actual buffet brunch, which has lovely salads, followed by fresh seafood including fresh shrimp, crab legs, scallops that are fresh, and oysters that are fresh. From there, they have sushi rolls which were seriously delicious. They have a wonderful meat station with everything from pork to prime rib to sausage and more. From there, they have a grits and shrimp station that rivals New Orleans impressively. I had just come back from New Orleans and was completely doubtful that I would ever have grits as good as I had there again. The shrimp and grits at this restaurant were as good and an absolute star of the buffet for me. From there, there is a station of wonderful bakery goods from fresh bagels to lovely pastries, salmon that is fresh, cream cheese, and several other items. There is also a menu that the kitchen has, which is free to anyone having the brunch. It included six items, including poached eggs with crab, a farm fresh omelette, sliders, wagyu hotdog, French toast bread pudding, and a lovely crepe with spinach and cheese. We had five of the items, excluding the hotdog, and they were all absolutely delicious. I would suggest only ordering one dish at a time because the buffet is plentiful and you get full quickly. They also do not take that long to come out so it is easy to order one thing at a time. Once all this is completed, there is a dessert station. There is a candy bar which was great for the kids, and it has M&Ms, gummy bears, taffy candy, truffles that look like cake pops, and several other yummy goodies. There is then a large vitrine of incredible desserts, small cakes like you would find at a high-end bakery like Jean Philippe or Payard, and it is self serve. From chocolate mousse to dark chocolate Bombe to a fresh pannacota to a strawberry shortcake to a Keylime pie to a fresh fruit tart... and more! The dessert bar is unbelievable! It is sinful and not merciful to those on a diet.
Suggestions: the brunch is about $64 per person, so I would not recommend it for small children unless you have extra money to spare. There is an all you can drink option for Bellinis or Mamosa's for 35 extra dollars or an all you can drink exclusive champagne or Bloody Mary for an extra $65. All you can drink is represented in a much classier sense as bottomless. If you are not hungry, then it is not worth it. It is not a cheap brunch so you have to be able to pack in a lot of food to get your value. That is generally very difficult to do so I believe people eat a lot less than the worth of the brunch in many cases.
We liked sitting on the inside a lot better. I did order a Bellini with passion fruit and it was a letdown for me. I will likely not get bottomless drink options myself because I was not impressed. Know that coffee, tea, soft drinks, and juices are free with the brunch. 
Note that reservations are a beneficial.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,4,2,4,3fu-6RqUCGyTlW6UqzgSYg

65$ is wayy too expensive for the quality this place is churning out!! oysters that tasted like they were spoiled and that both my friend and i had to spit out. we told our waiter and nothing was done. we were just honestly concerned about the food safety issues.  i thought rio buffet oysters were kind of suspicious but dang these oysters take the cake for worst i have ever had in las vegas. 

the buffet part was dismal at best. when your best offering are the smoked meats you got some problems. boring cajun shrimp, dried out hunks of meat for the carving station, gumbo with mushy crawfish and seafood cooked to death, and so little options you cant help but feel cheated when the bill comes. dessert had a few stars like their chocolate mousse cake, macaron. but also slim pickings. i was able to carry one of each item on one plate. 

the only reason i give the brunch 2 instead of 1 is cause their made to order menu items are pretty good. and its also all you can eat. so if you do go honestly just get one of each from the menu. shrimp and grits are really good. but you can get this on their normal lunch menu and its not gonna cost you 65$. 

so in the end if youre going to charge me 65$ for really mediocre if not below mediocre food i'm gonna be unhappy about it. 25$ is reasonable for this brunch but i understand that i am at the Wynn and theres a nice view so 35$ but any higher, i'd say youre pushing it.

For dinner, I had the brown sugar brined pork chop. The picture of it on their website made my mouth water before we even arrived. The pork did not disappoint. It was tender and had a smokey flavor. Instead of the prescribed corn succotash, I had the creamed corn. The creamed corn, as mentioned by other reviewers, is divine. 

My husband ordered the free range chicken. The chicken was crispy on the out side and juicy on the inside. It was delicious! 

When we ordered, our server commented that even though they are a steakhouse and have fantastic steaks, the pork and chicken dishes are amazing. I respect the honesty of any server that will recommend a less expensive dish. 

For dessert, we had the chocolate bombolone. They were warm and chocolaty but surprisingly light. Our server gave us instructions not to cut them open as the chocolate squirts out. As soon as I bit into the first one, I began to heed his warning and chew carefully with my mouth shut tightly. It's like a chocolate explosion in your mouth. 

When we went back for Jazz Sunday brunch, we were equally pleased with our experience. In addition to the buffet, there is a menu of small plate items to order from. These items are included in the set price for the brunch. From the menu, we sampled the french toast bread pudding and grilled beef hot dog. This hot dog was no small plate. It was huge and delicious, as other reviewers have noted. 

As far as meats from the buffet, we enjoyed the creole rubbed shrimp, herb roasted turkey breast, king crab legs (cut in half lengthwise for tactful and easy eating) and more brown sugar brined pork tenderloin. The beef tenderloin left a lot to be desired. It was rubbery and flavorless. They had mini-hamburgers which were very good and a surprising treat. For sides, we enjoyed the Heirloom Tomato and Buffalo Mozzarella Salad (although it needed some extra balsamic as it didn't seem to have any), grilled vegetables, assorted salami's and cheeses. All were delicious. For dessert, we had peppermint macaroons (Parisian kind, not the coconut kind), candied apples, eclairs and mini cookies. There is a huge variety offered at this brunch. The views, food and service are all spectacular. This must be a dining stop on your gastronomic tour of Las Vegas.",w53mTrlYCO-RtQ4WVTr_KA,1,1,5,Ng3Nzo3GGk1bU3GAqvZMiA

5783154,2011-07-02,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"So I kept hearing so much about the Country Club Grill at the Wynn and I have been extremely eager to dine there for a while. I mean there are murmurs that this place Steve Wynn's favorite place in the hotel so this really has to be a knockout of a place right? You wouldn't waste the view overlooking the entire golf course with something mediocre right? This is the Wynn which is supposed to be the Las Vegas best of the best RIGHT?

Sadly wrong on all counts and lets just say I was thoroughly let down. So much so I have turned 2 people away from eating here already. Look if I ruin how I feel about the meal this early in the review you have to know it was just that lackluster...

So I made a reservation as it was advised this place can get very busy and it was a Friday afternoon. I walked in and was greeted pleasantly by the team at the front podium and was sat very promptly.  My table was at the glass and no matter where you sit you have a great view of the entire Wynn golf course.  The chairs were even real comfy which was just a great sign that they wanted to think every detail through of your dining experience. Things were looking up, right?

Our waiter came and dropped of the menu and an option vegan menu. It took me a second but, then I realized there was no wine or drink menu. I asked the waiter for this and it was brought over in a relatively timely manner. The actual menu is simple and covers pretty much every option you would expect for lunch dining with more than 3 items on it that looked good. When the waiter came back we ordered a nice white wine from France to get things started. This is sadly where things started to slide downhill. The waiter pinged back and forth a few times before I waived him down and gave him my food order (for me tomato & mozzarella salad and the chicken club sandwich). After a while of wondering where my wine was the waiter informed us that they didnt have what was ordered and brought a bottle of something from Oregon and a different varietal. Now let me stop here if I was at the Olive Garden this wouldnt be a big deal but the reputation and more importantly the PRICE of this place means they are held to a higher standard. The bottle was declined and I asked for an alternate on the menu. The waiter seemed confused. The wine list isnt very long so knowing whats on it should not be that hard.

Now the first course came out (salad for me and soup for my companion) and I was eager to try the food. Sadly another let down as my salad was just bland. I had to waive down the waiter for salt as there was none on the table. So up until this point if you read my review you might think I was real picky and just kind of a harsh critic but, really what it comes down to is again at this price level you have certain expectations and they were being dragged down in a very fast fashion. Finally the wine was brought out and I was able to enjoy it alongside my food. And that is when my waiter disappeared for about 15 minutes. So whenever I ran out of wine I had to reach over and do it myself.

The main course came out from the kitchen which looked amazing and we were still having to constantly refill our own wine. Now the chicken sandwich had a real good flavor of well cooked chicken, the sauces, and the soft bread. Really this was the only positive part of the meal and its saving grace for me. My dining companion ordered an item off the vegan menu (a mushroom napoleon)  and was unfortunately let down by the flavor.

I really cant tell you how much I wanted to like this place and maybe thats why I am so let down. Sub par service and so so food make this place a must skip as far as I am concerned. Wish that wasnt the case!",MjA21jK_XRHJvMjtvvnxow,1,0,2,rUEHcvqzr-YxneRVJipTVg

We arrived at opening time of 11:30 without a reservation and were seated promptly. We chose to sit outside overlooking the golf course and waterfall. The menu is promising and it did not disappoint. Our server Jack was very knowledgable and friendly. He kept our water glasses full ,answered any questions about the menu and just overall had a wonderful personality. The bread basket here is a real treat- the pretzel bread is delicious. The menu has a lot of cajun inspired dishes and I was happy to see that. i was also informed that the chef used to work at Commanders Palace in New Orleans. i was able to sample both the corn chowder and gumbo . Both were delicious but I decided to go with the gumbo. The portions here are really nice and I left full after bread, gumbo and a burger with fries. i also had the king creole burger and let me tell you that the bacon was to die for.The special creole seasoning was so spot on, unique, and delicious. The meat patty was cooked to perfection and the burger was tender and juicy. My friend had the Ahi tuna salad .That was delicious as well with a perfect sear and flavor combinations. Overall- I will come back to this location because of the setting, service, and most importantly the food.

5806942,2007-06-21,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"When I first read about Wynn Las Vegas, I classified The Country Club Grill as Wynn's golf club restaurant. Translation: boring! However, I'd read many complimentary reviews, and decided that perhaps it was worth a shot.

The Country Club Grill serves lunch and dinner. You don't need to play golf to eat here; everyone is welcome. The menu is simple. Dinner concentrates on hunks of meat - steaks, chops, and the like - plus a few seafood options. Lunch offers similarly basic, though lighter, fare.

Located next to Wynn's golf course, it has wonderful views. Outside tables are available. It manages to maintain the feel of a golf club restaurant, albeit one that is a lot fancier than any such place I've ever been to.

I ate here for lunch. Cobb Salad was a mix of the standard ingredients, including lettuce, turkey, bacon, blue cheese, tomato, and avocado, all cut into small pieces. A few words about ""small"": to me, the pieces should be as small as humanly possible - less than a quarter inch square. The Country Club Grill didn't meet this standard, but it did make cuts as small as any I've seen in restaurants. More importantly, the ingredients were very fresh, as if everything had been cut to order. It was very good.

The Cobb Salad was more than large enough to be an entire meal. However, I was on a mission, having read lots of praise of the Country Club Crisp Potatoes. This dish consists of roughly mashed potatoes, placed in a small round dish, baked or roasted or something until crisp on the outside, then covered with fried onions. One order was enough for at least two people. It was very good, but not to die for. Don't feel sad if you don't have room for it.

Another recommended dish was Plum Crisp. This is not the type of dessert that appeals to me, but I'm glad I ordered it. The plums were both sweet and tart, the crust was crisp, and I quickly polished off the Armagnac ice cream with raisins, even though I have never liked its close relative, rum raisin ice cream.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,1,0,4,Glp4WZu9f70W1FumtXQYoA

5832384,2011-04-27,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"Our party of six enjoyed the Sunday jazz brunch. We were seated immediately although we did not have a reservation. It is a modestly sized buffet with seafood, meat, salad and dessert stations. The seafood is wonderful - huge shrimp, crab legs and oysters. All of the seafood is served in such a fashion that the vittle wrangling kept to a minimum (one wishes to consume, not wear, one's selection). The meats included house-made sausage, turkey and pork tenderloin. You may also choose additional prepared-to-order items at no additional cost, such as omelettes and French toast. This is a nice touch for those who have an aversion to buffet-style dining. 

I believe that the price was about $55 per person, not including alcohol, taxes or tip. No issues with service. There are several seating options, including banquettes, chairs and bar dining. It all makes for a very civilized Sunday morning.",A0kENtCCoVT3m7T35zb2Vg,0,0,4,0WHDB3dNcUsybN4zRJbFzw

If you order toast and butter,  it is the most perfectly toasted bread you have ever eaten. The butter was probably just flown in that morning from Ireland or France where it was made by nuns in a convent that have been making it that way for a 1000 years. It's that perfect. 

Today was no exception.  The food was delicious,  perfectly prepared and presented by a best in class team,  from the chefs,  hostess, manager and servers.  The club/ restaurant  venue overlooking the visionary golf course was, ... what's the word I'm looking for. .. perfect!

We were struck by one of the hostesses who acted like she couldn't be bothered when we came back in to ask if we could move from outside (it was beautiful but way too windy) to dine on the patio. I think she actually rolled her eyes as her coworker asked her to seat us in a particular section (really?  all we want is another table, and you are hardly busy). Her overall demeanor was less than friendly and quite aloof.

5930105,2010-01-15,0,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"I just had lunch on the patio at the Country Club at Wynn Resorts and I must say that it was an experience that caught me by surprise! I work Monday-Friday 8:30am-5pm in an office, with no windows might I add, and getting out for lunch to the Country Club at Wynn just brightened my day to the fullest. The view from the patio was so surreal because it didn't even feel like you were in Vegas. It overlooks the golf course with this immaculate waterfall, it just sounded, smelled and felt amazing to be outside (in January might I add) and be comfortable. It is also a plus, since I have lived in lush places such as Oregon and Hawaii to see GRASS for what seemed like miles! ;o)

Now onto the lunch, it was very good! 

We had the cocktail shrimp to start, they were huge succulent shrimp (you only get three for $19 so a little $$$, but very good) the cocktail sauce had chopped red onion and was very flavorful.  I had a Blackened Chicken Caesar Salad, that was very tasty, dressing was a little on the heavy side, but luckily the dressing wasn't fishy at all so that was a plus. 

Overall, this was a lunch-break to remember, it revamped and rejuvenated me to finish the rest of the day strong!

5959687,2014-11-17,3,41b2SLmjLcxTGLVRxASiDA,"After hearing so many great things about the Jazz Brunch, I was excited to try them today for my mom's birthday meal. 

We arrived at 11 on the dot for our reservation and were seated quickly. Our server took our water order and told us our options for brunch. 

We decided to order some made to order entrees from the menu before venturing up to the buffet line. Nothing from the menu really stood out as exciting, but I held out hope that quality would win out over innovation. Unfortunately this wasn't the case. Flavors were just ok and I didn't enjoy most of the breakfast items we ordered from the print menu. 

The buffet line was pretty small. I enjoyed some of the meats from the carving station, but nothing that blew me away. The king crab was dry and after only a bite or two, I gave up on it entirely. The oysters didn't stand out and the only things I actually enjoyed were the bacon, cheeses, pastry basket and the asparagus. A sad percentage of the items sampled.

Service was spotty. Our server was very nice, but forgetful. He would say he was bringing refills or replacement silverware and we would wait and wait. He was apologetic, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt at first, but it started becoming ridiculous after a while and we all grew impatient. 

Despite mentioning it was mom's birthday, they did nothing to acknowledge it. I didn't expect a fanfare, but a nice little dessert with a birthday message would have been appreciated. Our waiter also forgot to bring over the dessert menu after asking a few times, we finally gave up and decided to pay our bill and leave.

The music was fun and the view was nice, but none of these factors made up for the food and service issues we encountered. My expectations for the type of food and service I usually encounter at Wynn and Encore were not met. There are so many wonderful restaurants at Wynn and Encore, I won't be back and wouldn't recommend Country Club to anyone I know.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,12,8,2,C-ubbhpzt8hM1-uMpj_5WQ

She wasn't hovering, but was always available when we needed her, and always smiling! The food was unbelievable. My favorite was the shrimp and grits, I could have eaten the entire vat of them. Perfection. The macarons were melt in your mouth delicious. The cheese/fruit/nut display was incredible as well. There was a chef making fresh mini waffles, top them off with nutella and mini chocolate chips and you have a bite of heaven. Advice: try a little of everything!! Don't miss any of it. The price is $65 per person which does include non-alcoholic beverages. Worth every penny!! It's not like I will be dining here every Sunday, but I would recommend this to anyone in town for a special visit, anyone celebrating a special occasion, and I will definitely be back!
