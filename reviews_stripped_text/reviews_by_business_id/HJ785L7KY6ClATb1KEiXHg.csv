297297,2015-09-04,0,HJ785L7KY6ClATb1KEiXHg,"The quality and organization of the DQ is disconcerting to say the least. I would not visit this DQ except for proximity. I have asked for an Oreo blizzard with extra Oreo every time. 70 % of the time the blizzard is partially melted and 50% of the time the extra Oreo is not added. In order to insure proper service, it is recommended to go in and order. Do not use the drive through. Every time that I have used the drive through, the order has always been wrong or under serviced, such as getting partially melted ice cream.

* Poor service
* Partially melted ice cream
* Incorrect orders are frequent

Do yourself a favor, do not visit this DQ if you have another close by.",dEEY1G77kPJKcUQFz_WZYw,0,0,2,CtUb85CIH-Rxuj-WfOImNA

About 3 weeks ago I ordered a hot fudge funnel cake. Didn't think about it, but when the bag was handed to me from the drive-thru window it was actually sideways. It was all melted all over the bottom of the bag & the cake was as hard as a rock.

Last week I ordered 2 fish sandwich combos with extra tartar sauce. Both of the sandwiches were bone dry. Not a stitch of sauce. 

Today I got the fish combos again. This time they didn't give me the 2 medium fries. I called the store as soon as I found out. The girl who answered was having such a laugh attack I could barely understand her. She said ""I guess they forgot to bag them."" Uhh, no s**t. She said she would make a note of it and started to hang up! I asked her didn't she need any of my information? She said, ""oh yeah, I guess your name"". Wow, really??

And they want $15/hr??",xcbdzluwDMmi-Ajl9UKpUQ,0,0,2,QGcLb6WU6KYJg8jLjInTBg

They said they were short handed but had three people up front just standing there doing absolutely nothing.,2D_QWvdA0ISg2MdWsSA6mQ,0,0,1,iunW0QnvuMSwwsMezuyIAg
2111131,2017-01-16,0,HJ785L7KY6ClATb1KEiXHg,Two stars because at least the girls were nice... but my Oreo blizzard that I paid over $4 for has maybe 4 chunks of Oreo in it... worst blizzard I've ever had and I'll never be back.

2361012,2016-05-05,0,HJ785L7KY6ClATb1KEiXHg,"Just hit this drive thru again, against my better judgement.  4 straight trips to this location and have yet to receive my order correctly. 

This trip i ordered a cheeseburger meal, no onions, and a chicken strip meal.  Made it home to find the burger loaded with onions and no french fries. 

Also, ordered 2 small blizzards and asked for lids and a cup holder, you know, because i own a car with only 2 cup holders. I received my blizzards but one of them was overfilled so when i got home i found ice cream had flowed out all over my seat. 

Stay away from this location until they hire some help who can manage proper order fullfillment. 

And these fast food employees want a $15/hr minimum wage...",_ZuJ4YuUdBkGMIqgUOneOA,1,0,1,L6_DVjuGj1bnamBx5HZUDA
3918266,2015-10-26,0,HJ785L7KY6ClATb1KEiXHg,"DQ has really improved over the years. I come here a couple times a week for the lunch menu items like the chicken strip basket or the sandwiches. The prices are great and the employees are upbeat. The only issue that could use some improvement is the time required to get through the drive-thru during peak times during the day. I have seen people opt to walk inside instead of waiting in the drive-thru, but I don't know if that would make the trip any quicker.",uV0Xxz4ZZ8vB2INJgtg0Yw,1,0,4,gfni12ALC4MlTdyzWfNE5A

We had the Chicken strips and fries, it was delicious and hot and fresh. I love the sauces it came with. The worker (her name is Kehau) was very attentive. It's our 1st time dining at a DQ and we will be returning to this one when we come back to Vegas.

Safe your self the calories and move on.

4181726,2017-08-10,0,HJ785L7KY6ClATb1KEiXHg,"This DQ is pretty solid. My daughter wanted to go here, so off we went. It was a hot Sunday afternoon and the store was quiet! We were the only customers inside. The store was well staffed, they took out order and we grabbed a table. The interior was clean and the staff were very friendly. Even though there was a solid stream of cars through the drive through our order was brought quickly to our table.

I had the Mushroom Swiss Burger. The DQ version is pretty tasty. We also ordered the fries cheese curds, I forgot how delicious these were. I didn't even use the marinara sauce that comes with them.

The blizzards were mixed well and were just the thing for a hot day.

For fast food, this DQ is a good choice. The staff was on top of things, the food was good and the place is clean. You don't see that in the fast food world too often, nice work DQ!",P2ZK_uDduvKbKgmNuyZQ4w,0,0,4,732goUFO_dXfCaU-QyIkNA

4947950,2015-07-21,0,HJ785L7KY6ClATb1KEiXHg,"I first noticed this location two days ago and finally stopped by today.  It's located in the far rear corner of a shopping center, so the location can easily go unnoticed.  It features both a lobby and a drive-thru!  

Today I went with a small Oreo Blizzard and it most definitely satisfied my craving for ice cream.  Unfortunately, I was not able to try the actual food today.  However, the lovely couple that I had the pleasure of speaking with there were huge fans of their burgers and said that this was definitely one of the better locations (DQ fanatics in their words).  

I will definitely be back to give the other menu items a shot!  If you're craving fast food (yes, that definitely happens... or maybe it's just me?)  I suggest stopping by.

The staff was nice and friendly!  All orders are walked up to you, so nobody is forced to play the standing waiting game, even if take-out was ordered!  

P.S. They have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine!  Yay!  For those who aren't familiar with this, it's a machine that features over 100 drink options!  Winning!",QHTLXssB64NIsWDUPZBPFQ,1,1,4,PkTUR2A2z14gvbIz2ttYDg

Had a late night craving for some dessert and decided to give our local DQ a try. 

Ordered a med hot fudge sundae, a small Royal blizzard, a med orange julius, FlameThrower grillburger. 

The hot fudge sundae was half melted so it's in the freezer currently. 

My boyfriend started with the burger but a third of the way thru, noticed that the meat seemed pinker than a normal burger. 

Upon further review, we discovered that one patty was almost over cooked while the other one was so under cooked it was raw in the middle. (Picture included)

If I could give this location zero stars I would.",0fKCfLixNcnickTwCfwf0Q,0,0,1,L_a46PcmKw3CISVw6bxhDQ
5607537,2018-04-22,0,HJ785L7KY6ClATb1KEiXHg,"It is DQ.  You know what to expect.  Average fast food burgers and chicken strips, soft serve ice cream dolled up with candy, cookies, sweets.  

Don't expect too much.  It is what it is.  The bright spot for me was how clean the place was.   It was really well kept which is unusual for a DQ.  The other bright spot is that they have a few tables outside which makes enjoying your ice cream more enjoyable.  

The staff were competent but obviously not enthusiastic.  They seemed bored and just wishing their shift to be done.   I can understand but at least pretend to enjoy your work.    If I want a sweet treat (Oreo Blizzard) this place is a decent choice.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,2,1,3,PkBlpslaRkekdGBiaciNRw

I've complained to the owners wife once before, and to the staff several times. And it still happens. I've heard that they were running low and didn't make enough, several times. But-- it's okay to charge the customer for additional sauces.  

The drinks and desserts always come out great. I don't have a complaint there. It's just the food. 

Management, if you're reading these.. please train your staff to do better and to offer the same service they would expect themselves.",Bh6e3oeMTM3oGs1h4PWlhw,0,1,2,G8uZa2YfYcHXxLn_PxwSuQ
