54554,2017-06-16,0,E9Bq0UKtg3tB1yr2QXZ0Dg,This was a nice spot for a brunch with friends. The tables were a little small for the large plates they had. The food was good. Would definitely return again.,P1PUFLWkwAfCnTv_py4idg,0,0,4,OCjtrHQyyqKUiiw2NSSIrQ
140023,2017-05-16,0,E9Bq0UKtg3tB1yr2QXZ0Dg,"So here's what to expect: walk in around 1 pm, (sure it's a waffle place and typically more desirable for breakfast, but they serve lunch waffles) and I was the only customer, alongside 4 female employees SITTING around. I choose to sit outside, where I was handed a dirty menu. By dirty I mean pizza sauce fingerprints. Gross. If there are four bored employees, this would be the last thing you'd expect to see. Great first impression. I ordered a coffee and water, when she asked 'with ice?' Is it just me or is that an odd question to ask? Anyways, I decided to order both sweet and savory, so I ordered the original, that states on the menu 'with whipped cream OR powdered sugar' so I said with whipped cream and she said 'it comes with both' ok, menu flaw, whatever. And the combination pizza that clearly states 'with sausage, peppers, and onions' so I ordered that without onions. when delivered, my pizza waffle had mushrooms..wtf? That one didn't even come with mushrooms. Not sure if it was a server or chef error but I was unpleasantly surprised, but I just picked them off. AS FAR AS THE TASTE: look, I know restaurants and I know food, I'm not a snob, I've just been around the block. The waffles are dense, waffles shouldn't be dense, they should be light and fluffy, but the batter was so thick and heavy it was hard to keep eating. Also a tad overcooked, which probably goes hand in hand with the thickness of the batter. The same batter was used for both, which wasn't horrible for the pizza but not good for a sweet classic waffle. And the syrup...tasteless. Syrup is so important and I was so disappointed. Not entirely sure why a place that specializes in waffles, hasnt mastered the waffle. Again, I went here with so much excitement and an open mind.  Didn't exceed my expectations...didn't even meet them :( two stars for the concept because the concept has so much potential, but not quite ready for the public.",I4I5CWNyRHL0x-UQMGY-bg,0,0,2,MyU7yMYE-qJQxEql69qL2g

Disgusting and limited coffee condiments. I purchased 2 Groupon coupons, the first time they accepted it without a problem, the food was ok, but coffee was terrible, but still left a decent review on Groupon. The second time the customer service was horrible, I stood there for 5 minutes b4 anyone acknowledged me.  I proceeded to order and presented my Groupon. They said they are no longer accepting those Groupons, and made me feel like crap for trying to use a coupon. The most disturbing part is that not only did the guy lied to me about them cancelling the Groupons it is actually still up on groupon.com for sale.

The bacon was browned on one end only, and the majority of the rest was cold and the fat was all white like it never hit the griddle. Basically raw. Instead of bringing some new hot crisp (or at least cooked) bacon, they elected to take the plate and bring it back after warming it up, still not crispy. In the mean time, the eggs and potatoes got cold. Didn't provide spoons when coffee was served, had to request them. Illy coffee is great, but cups were barely 2/3 full, way more room than needed for cream. Is the coffee too costly? They were not that busy, but everyone seemed like they couldn't handle the crowd. They have a ton of staff, shouldn't seem flustered. I would have given them 2 stars if the waffle wasn't so good. Seems like they need better management and training.

First, this place is overpriced for what you get, which is just one medium sized waffle that tastes only slightly better than an Eggo from a box that's been hanging out in your freezer for two months.  Service was cheery but slow.  I watched in mute frustration as the guy took my hot waffle from the iron and then let it get cold on the counter as he (at glacial speed) put the napkin, silverware, and butter and syrup in the to-go box.  Let's talk about the butter and syrup.  The ""butter"" was Country Crock margarine (gross), in a tiny tub.  The ""maple syrup""  was some sort of cheap toxic corn-syrup crap from another tiny plastic container.  This is totally unacceptable food quality for a place that claims to specialize in waffles!

Came in for an afternoon bite after a workout- location is very bare, one quiet employee working. She recommended the Strawberry Banana waffle, so that is what I went with. Waffle was served hot and fresh, with ample fruit and whipped topping. However, the waffle itself was  overcooked, hard and crunchy rather than chewy. Flavor was decent, looking forward to trying a savory option.

I would like to see them step up their offerings- the current menu is a little basic. Also, when I spend $10 for a single waffle, I kind of expect a real plate instead of a paper one. Upgrading their canned whipped cream to a fresh made version would also be appreciated.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,14,3,HeLmPdxH6cIcMq9-VIucTg

My husband and I each ordered the chicken and waffles, which is chicken strips and a waffle. The chicken strips are on par with frozen Tyson strips, as in mechanically separated chicken formed into the shape of the tenderloin of a chicken, and covered in a ton of cajun seasoning. It was served with fries also covered in too much of the same seasoning. My waffle was cooked well; warm, soft, a little crunch from the caramelized sugar. My husbands was pretty dry and a bit overdone. 

My daughter had the waffle with berries which was beautiful to look at, but her waffle was rock hard with a slightly stale taste to it. When I say ""hard"" I mean in the way a super hard crouton bounces off your plate when you try to stick your fork in it. Very disappointing. 

I did, however, purchase the Groupon for this meal so I'm not terribly upset. Sometimes businesses give Groupon customers sub par service/product, so it's possible we just didn't get the best of what they have to offer.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,2,0,2,nqfA_JsNDXQMmz1ZMIVgng

We didn't know that a lot of the topics were going to be things we knew nothing about like tennis players and unknown movies and their directors. I wish it would've been better topics where we could've had more fun. 

Anyway, on to the actual restaurant. The place wasn't that busy when we first got there, yet nobody came up to us to greet us or ask if we wanted a drink. We had to ask a couple times before a waitress came and then had to remind them 3 or 4 times before we even got any water. We ordered some drinks from the bar and it took a very long time and a few different waitresses before we actually got them. It did get busier and of course the wait times got longer. I wouldn't rate their customer service very high, seeing how many people we had to talk to and how many times we had to ask, to get anything. They did, by the end of the night start coming more often to refill waterswhen we were about to pay.

The best part of the night, would be the food, but I still can't rate it the greatest. My friend got the grilled cheese waffle and the capresse and tho he said they were good, he was left feeling unsatisfied and still hungry. My boyfriend ordered the Philly steak waffle sandwich and had no complaints. He enjoyed it. I tried some of the seasoned fries he got with it and they were pretty tasty. I got the chicken and waffle.

We went on a very SLOW Sunday afternoon (4:30 pm or so), Tivoli Village was basically deserted (were we in a zombie movie, or....?) But that made finding the Waffle Bar easier!  We opted to eat inside (because Vegas summer), and though our table was a bit wobbly, things were ok (that wobbly table could have been an issue considering they put 2 full bottles of sparkling water on every table :/ seems like an accident waiting to happen..anyhow..)

I didn't realize the Waffle Bar had as extensive a menu as it does, sweet, savory, but all decadent. 

we opted to start with the Nutella waffle, that was super rich.  Came with whipped cream..oddly enough it came out AFTER our more involved entree selections, even though we asked for it as a starter..but that was alright. I got the Grilled Cheese (which comes with brie cheese, mushrooms and bacon).  Now I thought it was going to be served sandwich style, but it was open face with brie everywhere (in a good way).  It was sorta more of a..waffle omelette without the eggif that makes sense.  My partner got the Waffle Sandwich (choice of turkey or ham, typical sandwich style with pesto), lord help me that pesto stuff was DELICIOUS!!  If I go again, I'd order the Grilled Cheese and add pesto and tomato.   

The service was great, though, again, it was SLOW (2 other parties at various points in their meals).  I'm still sorta confused how the easy item came out last...and after reading some of the reviews, it seems things can be slow/disorganized(?) but I was satisfied overall!  (There were 2 of us, and we bought the $30 for $15 yelp deal, so we knowingly over ordered.

The staff wasn't great.  They seemed like heroin addicts, honestly.  They moved very slowly, spoke at an inaudible level, and just seemed very sad and lifeless.  There was never any sort of welcoming or joy or energy coming from any of them.

On the other hand, our waffles were AMAZING!!!!!!  I have a giant sweet tooth and I knew I was going to enjoy the desserty waffles, but I was blown away by how good they were.  It was like a beautiful symphony of flavors in my mouth.  

Waffles are made to order.  We were the only ones there, so it took 5-10 minutes.  We enjoyed watching the whole process and smelling the amazing smell that came from the waffle iron.  It was sweet and yeasty - totally in a good way.

They have 5 sweet waffles - Original, Nutella, Banana, Berry, and Strawberry Banana.  There were some savory flavors as well, but I can only remember one of them - the pizza waffle.  If I go back, it'll be to try a pizza waffle.  Oh who am I kidding, I'd end up with a desserty waffle too.

Brought it to the waitress attention they brought out another one they said they made fresh but it tasted like it was the same one they just threw on the grill and reheated. Worst part were the employees. Our waitress never checked on us and another one finally brought us a refill of coffee after our plates were cleared. Tables were left dirty until other customers came in and they needed to be seated. A family came in and asked to be seated in a certain area and a male employee who we thought was possibly the manager had a meltdown and became very angry and aggressive. When the family decided they wanted to sit somewhere else the male employees started making comments about them. It was so uncomfortable I lost my appetite, and couldn't even finish my food.

David was our server and did an outstanding job! He really knew what he was talking about wanted to make sure we chose something we were happy with. Upon his suggestion we went with the breakfast sandwich plate and mixed berry waffle with whipped cream.

We were blown away! The waffles were so good!
They are naturally semi sweet so you don't need syrup or honey for them all though both are available. What ever option you go with you will be happy!

A small place with bar seating, we sat at tables, I got a margherita pizza; the waffle crust was sweet, extra sauce on it and some delicious mozzarella cheese. I was really surprised how much I enjoyed this. Then I had waffle fries on the side with plenty of seasoning. My friend got gravy sausage waffles, which she loves and home fries on the side. There was only one server who did really well when quite a few people came in.

4880433,2018-03-04,0,E9Bq0UKtg3tB1yr2QXZ0Dg,"Had a Groupon for here. It was about 20 miles from home but so worth it. 

The place is pretty small but they have a patio area which would be great on a warmer day. It was crowded when we got there but were seated right away. Kind of reminded me of a yuppie style cafe. The tables are very close together. 

Several items to choose from on the menu I believe the only items not available in the morning are the dinner entree items. Still had several options to choose from.  

Naturally most of the items incorporated a waffle. There are some items that didn't and they also had crepes.  After debating on a waffle or crepes, we finally went with the waffles as the was the whole point of going there to begin with. 

I got the waffle breakfast sandwich with ham. It came with seasons waffle fries. My son ordered the Nutella waffle and added peanut butter to it. 

We got our order much quicker than I would have expected. Both were excellent. The breakfast sandwich was good size and overflowing with ham, egg, and cheese. The waffle has a sweet flavor to it which was a very good combination. The seasoned waffle fries were amazing. The Nutella/peanut butter crepe was equally amazing. The combination of the Nutella and peanut butter plus the whip cream made it very rich. Thank goodness my son and I had decided beforehand to share our entrees because it was too rich to eat a whole one by itself. 

With a cup of coffee added, our entire breakfast was 23 which was well worth it. 

Even though it was a bit of the drive we both agreed we would definitely go back and try some other items.

In the pictures the waffle sandwich was twice the size. I had already given half to my son before I thought of taking a picture.",2t_mL04-INjMfy9FZMaeQg,1,0,5,6Q7_3o4wvDrUa1FdTyK0zQ

My favorite unfiltered dame and I stopped by for a quick brunch Saturday afternoon. The waffle bar was empty but ironically there was a brief wait to be seated. 

Sweet and savory nutella, fresh fruit, and whipped cream on top of a crisp golden brown Belgian waffle is definitely not a typical breakfast; however I'm all about dessert first! This sugary modern spin on breakfast was right up my alley in reference to the sweet factor. 

The overall service was just okay the waitress attempted to clear plates while we were still snacking which in my opinion is odd (again the restaurant was empty). 

Uncertain if I'd return without inquiring with Groupon first but I'd recommend this place if you have a constant sweet tooth like myself.

The berry crepe was more like a dessert than a breakfast item.  It came with whipped cream and powdered sugar on top.  The crepe was soft and sweet and the berries added some mild sweetness to this dish.  

I thought the chicken and waffles were ok.  The waffle was nice and crispy, but it came with chicken strips instead of a wing or thigh.  I though the strip was on the dry side and needed a lot of syrup and ketchup.  

The salmon and waffle was really good.  The only complaint was that it came with too much cream cheese.  The ratio was off.  I wish there was more salmon.  I removed half of the cream cheese and it was still too much.  The waffle is cooked with a layer of syrup or sugar on the bottom so its crispy.  Its like biting into a sweet crust and was delicious.  The orange zest on the cream cheese also added a wonderful flavor.  I would order this again.

5279940,2018-01-10,5,E9Bq0UKtg3tB1yr2QXZ0Dg,"With two locations in Las Vegas, one in the Venetian/Palazzo complex and another at recently-rejuvenated Tivoli Village, Waffle Bar promises to deliver Liege Waffles and Crepes to an City where such things are slowly gaining traction, a sizable off-Strip crowd on Saturday admittedly a surprise as the Restaurant was found 3/4-full just past ten in the morning.

Visited entirely as the result of a Holiday Groupon Gift Certificate, the competing dining options either previously visited or otherwise of little interest, it was immediately upon entering the tightly packed space just a few yards from Brio that guests were greeted by a middle-aged man conveniently gathering menus for the hostess stand, a two-top near the window soon filled as iHeartRadio tunes chimed overhead and College Basketball played on Television.

Most certainly another eatery prior, par for the course at Tivoli where little save for Echo & Rig, Brio or  Leoné Café has managed to sustain any test of time, it was shortly after seating that Water was poured and an order was placed, the volume level moderate save for a particularly loud pair of friends plus a couple and their fussy infant.

A pleasant enough place, walls including quotes from the likes of Lady Gaga surrounding an L-Shaped floorplan that extends to an outdoor patio during warmer months, it was no more than fifteen minutes before two entrees emerged from the kitchen, the question as to whether Maple Syrup was real never answered save for ""I'm not sure, I'll go find out"" though a taste suggested no.

Thankful that the real stuff out of Vermont had been brought from home, a taste of the Waffle before topping medium-crispy and slightly sweet but lacking the smooth caramelization of those found in Belgium or nearby at Andres or the Waffle Love truck, it was after a slathering of Butter and pour of Syrup that the Chicken and Waffles was compared to so many others, the Waffle itself standing up to the test but Tenders no better than store-bought with dried out Meat and flavorless Breading.

A bit confused by the ""seasoned Potatoes,"" for all intents and purposes flaccid French Fries cut into thirds and pan-fried with Herbs, it was by way of a bit of Ketchup that the Spuds achieved mostly edible status, a shift from savory finding the ""Cinna-bomb"" Waffle expectedly sweet thanks to Cinnamon Butter, Cream Cheese Frosting plus a spray of Reddi-Wip-esque topping.

**1/2:  Probably best judged as an alternative to the ever-popular Leoné Café, the price-point similar and both offering Coffee, Waffles and Crepes at Tivoli Village, Waffle Bar offers good service and pleasant environs for those at the Shopping Center while unfortunately lacking the ingredient quality or kitchen skills to make anything about the food memorable.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,18,8,2,a0ruO1ys6zLTEVWAfxhCkQ

This should have been an omen but I was hungry  and chose to ignore it.  The lady at the order counter was nice, took my order for a ham and cheese crepe and I took a seat. First off, their cook is extremely SLOW, it took over 20 minutes to get a simple crepe. And the place was half full!  Also, it's loud with a playground in the back. When the crepe finally came, I received plastic utensils with an apology that they were all out of silverware. 

Now, about the crepe: it was bland, with gummy dough and the inside was dry. Besides the fact that eggs are not a requirement in a ham and cheese crepe, they were dry and crumbly. I presume they were microwaved. In an effort to improve the presentation, a sprinkling of cold shredded cheese was thrown on top (see my picture). 

Final analysis: the food is so so, service is super slow, prices are high and ambiance is poor. I pity the parents who came in after me to feed the kids because they saw a playground in the back. They probably had to wait forever.

The food takes a long time to come out after being ordered. It's very inconsistent.

that it was a mistake. No kidding!! Once our food arrived, I found the waffle cold, overdone and dry. The best part was the strawberries and bananas on top.

The cafe of course, was packed. The food was amazing as usual, and the nice manager came to our table to say hi.  Want to take a guess why this place was EMPTY and the cafe had people lined out the door? Look no further than this review.",X_liEerKb33-EogeagGqzQ,0,0,1,wW1-Cs8B4Z4t5M8EqUahyA

This is going to be our new weekend spot. Very cozy, yet elegant, jazz music fills the area and the food leaves your taste buds wanting more. Couldn't be more satisfied with our visit.",OHJtcex7kwqsx-flI8QRkA,0,0,5,XX6dB_3evNVaPKG4bXiTgw

I get the waffle appeal though. It's a thicker, denser waffle with a sweet outer layer crust. Paired with your favorite fruit and whip cream it's definitely a delightful little breakfast. I also can appreciate the waffle bar theme (waffle menu, wine and champagne bar) BUT.... I could just as easily go to waffles cafe and get the same love on my plate (sans alcohol) and come out feeling equivalent food joy without the near guilt I felt paying $32 for TWO single waffles & two drinks. No eggs, bacon, potatoes.... nada. A minor side note, each time I was in there it's only had the one same waitress alone. This morning she was completely overwhelmed and although she did her best and was as friendly as she could muster through the chaos, we still waited 5-6 minutes to be seated (restaurant wasn't packed) and then another 15-20 for our check. One family waited longer than that and another patron got up to let her know that when she had a moment his table was ready to order. 
I felt bad for her but it didn't go over well for most folks and her vibe was very frazzled. Sometimes running to And from where she needed to be. 
I can't say for sure I'll be back. Even if I'm in TiVoli.... I would rather hit cafe leonè, or even give Canters a go. Decent food nonetheless, but not worth it to me.",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,2,2,3,TKW3kRifYu9KRKcNsbGx4g

5891817,2016-08-08,1,E9Bq0UKtg3tB1yr2QXZ0Dg,This Cafe is a prime example of food places that throw random ideas together (that in most cases wouldn't work) and expect them to work. The service was fine but the taste of some of the dishes were disguisting. The serving sizes were also very small and not satisfying. The prices are a bit higher than I feel as they should be. We walked in and they was no one present to welcome us. I probably won't be returning until some positive improvements are made.,tWxmzO361O3BM1-0ubnLxA,0,0,1,hC7oF4PjSSf_LjG7OugdXA

5975445,2017-07-03,0,E9Bq0UKtg3tB1yr2QXZ0Dg,"I'm so confused with why this place has such low reviews. It was amazing! We had a party of 8 sit at the patio (including 2 toddlers) and every dish including the salads were amazing! And they offer a 15$ coupon for 30$ worth of food on Yelp! 

The waffles were made perfect, a little sweet which was so good on the pizza waffles, and the fruit waffles were just as great. I can't wait to go back and get more! For those of you have left bad reviews you should really go back and give them another try-We all seriously loved this place!!!",GMyeEaiXMLIg712fG-v5yQ,1,0,5,0u9qN8BsNd1bp525xUlRSw
