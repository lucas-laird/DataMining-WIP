The staff was very inefficient and unhelpful. I tried to order a bacon cheddar with grilled onions only to be informed that grilled onions were for the veggie burgers only. Go figure. Next my daughter asked if she could just order a burger without the combo. She was informed she could but the cashier didn't tell her the burger alone was $11.95 and the combo was $12.95 so we got charged $11.95. FYI there is no burger only prices on their menu, just combos. The burgers themselves were extremely overpriced for very basic flavorless burgers. Very disappointing. Save your time tastebuds and money and eat somewhere else.",Clu_FPJtK0ErAn3IvhPyZg,0,0,1,iG63F0lWH4eBXNl0x6yQ-A

Disappointed. :(   you can order the burger without the fries, but they only take $1 off. Kudos to them for 25% off discount for military.",nAc-oxMo5B0Wuw5xXNUxvw,0,0,3,iuNZooxd4uNyHGhU9KXU7Q

You can taste the difference.they also have salad here if you don't want a burger. The shakes have alcohol which is cool.

Well - the Pancakes were Gray !!  Not golden ---
But gray.   The didn't give me my money back because couldn't find the receipt, even though it was 1 months minute prior - I had to swap for some water.
One of the Workers decided to argue with me...She said 
""Of course they are not golden, they are cooked in a microwave"".  - note the image on menu - Golden Pancakes.   Nobody stepped up to even try to resolve 
It politely.  Total lack of Respect and management.
Customer Service is non existent.   Another family was going through the exact same thing.   DO NOT EAT BREAKFAST AT JOHNNY ROCKETS!!!    It's awful.",qaS981yvNYinYBzF_BmM1g,1,0,1,gvp2W4tchblcXGvGQr6Wfg
2929716,2017-09-24,0,FWBWBnM2zjycBI7QrayklA,They are ridiculously slow. They are more concerned with their side work than helping customers to get food. We waited in line for over 30 minutes just for them to take our order when we were the second people in line.

They force you to buy the fries with the burger.  If you don't want the fries they take a paltry $1 off the $17 burger.  If you are here in mgm there are 2 eat in restaurants where you can buy a burger 3 times the size and way way better for only several dollars more than at Johnny Rockets.  Don't waste your hard earned money with them but just go to either the Pub or Tap.  You will get a much higher quality meal for only a few dollars more.",TeEt3ck4ZZlzwKglH21Nzw,0,0,1,Cg853SvGvE_JuyqaKwnTVw

During my visit one of the employees was starting work and looked right at me and said I'll help you after I log in to her register. She walked away, turned around, and started to laugh. Her manager took my order and when it was ready (I had it to go) I hurried to my room. The burger was over cooked, lacked their special sauce, and was unappealing. Don't bother to buy any product here as management is unresponsive to date.",-kFCZBWX7rm-ITvE7T6bVA,0,0,1,ayIEzpQ6WCse5XazMzFRnw
4882037,2016-10-08,0,FWBWBnM2zjycBI7QrayklA,"This Johnny Rockets its located in the MGM food court. Its more of a fast food place, as opposed to other Johnny Rockets where you are served at your table. Here is more like a McDonald's, you place you order at the cashier, retrieve your food and seat at the food court tables along with people eating from all the other fast foods joints.

They are a little too busy during breakfast, so you might have to wait a little for your food, but nothing beyond reason. As a matter of fact, you can order from their breakfast menu throughout the day. And since you are in Vegas, they serve alcoholic shakes.

People working here are friendly enough, and the prices are fair. To be honest, if you are on a budget, you can avoid the expensive hotel restaurants and eat at the food court every now and then.",D2I-takWVAcF_3J6bGzV7A,1,0,4,MbWn-T1aoJuNdk-aNO3DyA

We fall into the ""b"" category.  Our kids were hungry and didn't want filet mignon or truffle fries so we treated them Johnny Rockets.  They liked it.  The food was okay and we were given a buzzer when the food was ready so we didn't have to stand there waiting for our number to be called.  

Overall, it serves it's purpose.",07gdGKMkho4maba0lQyoQQ,21,27,4,DU8o3ri0A6I07YvlORr62A

5568372,2017-06-25,0,FWBWBnM2zjycBI7QrayklA,"This Johnny Rockets was inside the MGM Grand food court.  It is not a regular sit down restaurant like some of their other locations.  The food was just okay and definitely not what you can get at their sit down locations.  I ordered the hamburger combo which came with fries and a soda.  They also had a tater tots on the menu but you could not substitute them for the fries which is lame.  The burger was a bit boring, nothing like a regular Johnny Rockets burger.  Fries were crisp and flavorful.  The food did take quite a long time to be prepared even though they were not that busy.  Overall this was just okay.  Not great but not terrible.  I probably will not come back to this location.",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,1,1,3,f6t6q1VhPrW3M_8JcQkNCg

I either got the single patty bacon cheddar or the double. That comes with  apple wood smoked bacon, Wisconsin cheddar and lettuce. No onions or tomatoes for me. It was good, it was greasy... It was just what the doctor ordered after a night on the town. It was quite tasty.

The older lady that rang me up both times was friendly despite all the late-night revelers ordering at that hour.

Just a heads up it is at the mgm food court.. and the reasons y i didnt give it 5 stars was because 1. They didnt have their own napkins  and 2. They didn't have ranch other than that food was on point,x63W-SZx9VUy00t2D3KvKw,0,0,4,re_BTO43xbob1vWlhqZy0w
