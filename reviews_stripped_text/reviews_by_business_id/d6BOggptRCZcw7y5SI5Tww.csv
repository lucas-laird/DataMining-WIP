We got one hookah that was not lit correctly and when we asked him to light it correctly was rude about and finally gave up so we asked him to get someone else to do it. Which he did and then the problem was fixed. However by this time the small amount of tobacco was already mostly burned up.
They do not give free refills on fountain drinks, ice tea or anything else. No free drinking water. I asked specifically for tap water and he still brought a bottle of cheap drinking water, then charged 2.75 for it. I had already bought one soda for the same price.
The food is alright, however once again overpriced.
On the weekends they do not let African-American people in unless they are with other people. That is terrible, if I would have known they did not I would have not even gone in the first place. I know this because a couple of my friends tried to come in the waiter says there where no tables available. I show up and get a table no problem.
This place is terrible and should be shut down.",2lehuzWzjM6OHHI1v4tIlw,6,1,1,pf9Ebmp_4D0CM4qnYsAZ7w

I've come here with my bf 3 different times this week and every single time we've walked in and out immediately because it was SOO DEAD. The days we went were Sunday, Saturday, and Wednesday. The last time I came here was on a Friday and I'm guessing that's their only busy day of the entire week. It was seriously DEAD every other time that we went, no more than 3 groups of people, so sad. I really wanted to come on a Saturday night since THEIR FLYER says that they have belly dancers. When we came in and saw nothing but an empty room my bf asked the manager about the dancers and he said ""oh, thats on Thursday."" Their flyer says nothing about dancers on Thursday...

I really loved this place the first time we went and I thought it'd be like that every night, but boy was I wrong! 

Don't come here on any day other than Friday.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,3,1,eN2TS9hrkkKaBl-Ot2c6Fw

But one thing was for sure - their falafels were amazing as were the shawarma sandwiches and their pickles. Miss it.",-SWRw9-1ARVKLAWE0Sxw1Q,3,0,1,DoebDuic7YYOe4lIoTCmYg

The decor was bad, even for low lighting. 
They could probably use a major make over...",oknzpMgHOnbijayveG-PKQ,0,0,1,9c9681bsITLp7fNCCqdozg
