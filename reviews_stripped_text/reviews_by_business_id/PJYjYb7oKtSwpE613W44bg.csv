There really is only one reason for you to go to a McD's on the strip... you're hungry and/or drunk.

As far as McD's go, this is a pretty nice one! Clean and modern with a lot of staff working all the time.

This place has one major perk though, you get to watch people misbehaving while they're drunk or on drugs! Seriously, I had a blast!! It started with me arriving while the cops were handcuffing a junkie on the parking lot. The guy was talking to himself and shouting insanely funny random words at people (purple melons anyone?)

For service, I have to give it a 1 to the manager of the place (and the manager only!!!).

I've been to other McDonalds and I always thought that the managers are friendly and helpful. 

Service is all about management and despite what the ""controversial"" issue is between the workers, please always keep it strictly professional, and especially in public. I initially gave it a 5 because service was great but now...
