I was excited about this close location blue diamond but I've ordered take-out 3 times & dine-in twice , only 1 out of 5 visits was I happy with the food, which was when they first opened . My order has always been messed up for take out & I always give them an extra 15 mins from the 15 mins they tell me it will be ready, when dinning in my pancakes we're not as flavorful or sweet as usual & the coffee always seems to taste burnt like it's been sitting around . I order the same thing EVERY SINGLE TIME.. Spam Scramble with egg whites & chocolate chip pancakes & I don't know if it's the cooks at this location but I'm sorry blue diamond, won't be coming back .

*OJ was served cold with pulp and quite refreshing
*Coffee was standard, just enough to wake you up
* Adobo Fried Rice with hash brown, hash brown needs seasoning, the  Adobo Fried rice however, was flavorful.

Service was pleasant.

We got lucky and didn't have to wait in line to be seated so that was a plus. We ordered the chicken adobo fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. The fried rice was not as good as I was expecting. The rice was kind of hard and it just tasted like vinegar. The ""adobo"" flavor that I was looking for was close to non-existent. It came with a side of potatoes. The potatoes were extremely dry. At least the serving size was enough for at least two people. I also tried their red velvet pancakes. I thought it was okay as it was missing that kick of red velvet (if you had your eyes closed while eating, you'd probably think it was just a regular pancake.""

We waited 30 minutes for a table when others came in and got sat in 5. I actually said something and ended up getting the next table. 

Our order was a little off but the gentleman that brought it out right was the absolute nicest of the group of people we interacted with. Very small dining area left us feeling super cramped. People would walk by and run into our chairs and table. 

I believe this was all started off with the host guy and his lack of personality and experience in his job. The food was ok, the experience made it bad though.",zD-yLGO5u2VWjDD6yrwH1A,5,1,1,DghBL_3zsymuW68DN1sKJA

As soon as I stepped in the restaurant, I felt like I was home in the Philippines. I had no idea that this was a Filipino based restaurant so I was truly excited when I saw the menu. 

I've heard that pancakes is the way to go here, but I couldn't help and order Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. Best omelette I've ever had. It was a big omelette so I had to take it to go. They had a lot of choices for pancakes but I had to order their Nutella pancakes. 

If ever you're in Vegas and feel like having something other than the places offered at the strip, this is the place to go!",Jnkt1roy1HfdwKUCLJJe9Q,1,1,5,hTjHxO9JQj0wRrgsMM_fqg

We typically go to breakfast with the older crowd (7am)... so 10am was late for us and we knew there would be a wait anywhere we go. They told us 20 minutes for 2 people and we hung out outside until we were called. The dining area is tiny! but we were offered seats at the high top bar area within 15 minutes. The place was slammed but our server still managed to give great customer service. The coffee was really good! There was no flavored creamer (I didn't ask) but just half & half cups. I ordered a basic 2 egg breakfast & turkey sausage - not much to say- everything was good there. The star of the show was the cinnamon bun pecan pancakes. We ordered a short stack to split and I highly regret not ordered a tall stack! These were SO GOOD. The icing & pecans really topped it off.

I always order the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes! The fried rice is huge and I always have leftovers for dinner later in the day. As for their Red Velvet Pancakes, they are so heavenly. I'm not a big fan of pancakes at all but I love theirs! It's cooked to the perfect texture with a slight crispiness on the edges.

The first experience the service was scattered from the time we walked in.  The hostess was confused our group wanted to dine in since they were on a 15 min wait. Once seated we had to stop a waiter to take our order and the food came out slightly warm.  Shit happens and everyone paid without complaining just laughing at the strange breakfast.

My next go at this place started with better service until it was time to eat. My girlfriend and I both ordered eggs benedict. We noticed my eggs were basically hard boiled, the yolk was completely cooked to the point I separated from the whites, whole.  When I asked the waiter he looked and said, ""that's how they are supposed to be."" I then pointed to my girlfriends plate and asked why her's looked runny and benedict like. We asked to speak to the manager but received the check when the waiter returned. 

The hair that broke the egg... My last experience with this place came in the form of a to go order.  Figuring maybe the food would be better sans service.  The joke was on me... went for the omelette this time, figured it had to be a safe bet. At first glance the avocado, that of course was extra, was black. The first few bites of my avocadoless omelette were good. I had almost forgotten it didn't have the mean green avocado. Then it all went terribly wrong when I found hair imbedded in the middle of it all.  I'll let the photos tell the rest.

We ordered the Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which came with Red velvet short stack pancakes with fresh whip cream, chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. We were able to substitute egg whites only on the omelet for an additional $1.25. We also tried the White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut short stack. The short stack comes with some Macadamia crumbs on the side, topped with extra white chocolate chips and warm maple syrup. 

The pancakes were very fluffy and filling. The Adobo fried rice was delicious! Shredded chicken with rice wrapped in an egg omelet. Sure there was a hint of soy sauce in this omelet. Delicious goodness that seem to disappear before our eyes 8-D

I've been hearing so many good things and they didn't disappoint. I came here on a Saturday for breakfast with my friend Julian and it was packed! We took a seat outside and waiting maybe 15 minutes before we were called in for our table. We sat in a little two seat table by the wall and checked out the menu. I'm a queen of consistency when it comes breakfast. I always order either the chicken fried steak or huevos rancheros for breakfast. Sometime I'll thrown some pancakes in but usually the prior. However, when I came to Babystacks I ordered something completely different. I decided to go with the Mexican Skillet and we split the s'mores pancakes. The Mexican skillet comes with carnitas, jalapenos, pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese, and sour cream. I also ordered a side of avocado. It was so tasty. The skillet was a great mix of meat and cheese and yum. Only thing I might request next time is less sour cream and maybe some green salsa. I love green salsa. The s'mores pancakes were so sweet, but that is to be expected. They of course come with chocolate chips, marshmallows, whipped cream, and graham crackers crumbs. They barely needed any syrup. I think I ate too much and had a food coma. I went straight home and took a nap. I'm excited to go back and try my normal stuff plus more.",MZ70U0pR16IiZEfxVmkyyA,8,8,4,ZFhbyrKu5L-C9S6hOT_aHw

They also have traditional Filipino/Hawaiian style breakfast if you're into that.

They are famous for their red velvet pancakes which I can agree are delicious.

This is an amazing pancake House with a Hawaiian twist. Every time I go there I think I know what I want to order...then I see somebody else's food and change my mind. Everytime I branch out of my comfort zone and get something new I'm never disappointed.

The seating is small and somewhat cramped but the staff does a tremendous job of making sure all the tables are bussed and filled very fast. Our waitress is always such a sweetheart and gives us our drinks to go at the end. It is such a nice touch to have such great customer service!

Now for the food! Where do I begin? My husband's favorite is the adobo rice omelette... But he loves their skillets too. I have too many favorites to choose from including the Portuguese sausage, spam & garlic sticky rice, all their Eggs Benedicts, Mac salad, and of course their Loco Moco! 

The interior is painted cheerfully bright with different colors and upbeat Hawaiian and reggae music keep the customers happy. I would definitely say the vibe here is completely Island-friendly and super chill.

As for the pancakes... My 6 year old is a complete pancake foodie and claims their red velvet are the best in town. She always picks this place for breakfast and I can see why because they treat her like a princess and give her the hook up with the extra whipped cream. My husband loves the German chocolate pancakes but claims he will have a heart attack if he eats them more than once a year. All the pancakes are incredibly decadent and today, when we went I watched a woman steal her husband's Banana Foster pancakes and ate half of them before he even noticed lol.

I highly recommend you come here and take your time it's worth the wait. Give the menu items you've never tried a chance because your mind will be blown!",X21PenoIOsBQB4gQyAJ8DQ,5,5,5,ulO8hU6wJX8VM6-5Hpv9bw

My hamburger patty was a bit too overcooked, so it was almost like chewing on rubber, however, the garlic fried rice was really good.

Our server, wish I could remember his name, seems to be the Babystack Ambassador. His recommendations were on point. My husband ordered the chili moco. However, the Ambassador had advised my husband to get it with the side of Portuguese sausage so that my husband could have it with both the sausage and the hamburger patty. My husband was floored to see that the Portuguese sausage sliced and surrounding his plate, but also had sausages between the rice and hamburger patty! What!? And the chili was really good.

My husband did order a side of the bacon pancake which he wasn't too impressed with.

I ordered the ever famous Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and got a side of the lemon ricotta based on the Ambassador's recommendation. He said it would be lighter since it was a crepe and since our breakfast was more on the heavy side. DAAYUM that lemon ricotta was super ono!

To Lolo Rick or Lola Cora, could you consider adding shrimp sarciado to your menu, please?

Edit: Just got home and we opened our boxes of omelettes. One of our three orders is missing a side. The girl never asked what side I wanted over the phone.

4034508,2018-03-17,0,6fz0hnNIVpLF5v2NqJfA9w,"Come here for the pancakes! My family and I come here often for their wide variety of pancakes. 

Babystacks is a Breakfast/Brunch place that specializes in Hawaiian style dishes, such as the Loco Moco, Adobo Fried Rice, Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict, etc. However, they also have normal breakfast plates such as Eggs Benedict, Chicken Fried Steak, Biscuits & Gravy, etc. This place is pretty well known for their pancakes, especially their Red Velvet! They have a ton of choices to choose from that are pretty delicious and awesome.

Here are the dishes we have tried:

Kalua Pig Eggs Benedict - Not a fan. The Kalua Pig was burnt and didn't really go well with the Hollandaise Sauce.

Adobo Fried Rice - This was okay. There didn't seem to be a good amount of meat to rice ratio inside the omelette. 

Eggs Benedict - Delicious! Eggs were poached perfectly, and their Hollandaise Sauce was spot on.

Chicken Fried Steak - My hubby's go-to dish! Good portion of chicken fried steak, delicious white gravy, and potatoes. Yum! 

Loco Moco - This is a hit or miss. Sometimes the hamburger patty is good and moist, while other times (like today) it's dry and tough. 

Red Velvet Pancakes - These pancakes are good, but our family prefers their other ones.

Lemon Ricotta - When I want something light and not as heavy and decadent as normal pancakes, I get these. They are really light, but definitely delicious.

Smores Pancakes - My son's favorite Pancakes! Chocolate chip pancakes, with chocolate drizzle, crushed graham crackers and marshmallows? So Good!

What I love about this place is the fact that I can get a normal meal, and then opt to get pancakes instead of toast/rice/potatoes for $1.50 more. Their pancakes are like a dessert for us, so it's nice to end our meals off with their pancakes instead of having to order a whole plate of them.

My boyfriend and I used to love going to the first location in town we were so excited that they opened a southwest location by our house. I ordered banana foster pancakes with no sauce or Carmel just wanted bananas and whip cream pretty easy right? Wrong. They brought them out and they were drenched in Carmel the pancakes were swimming in a sea of Carmel, very smiley soggy, so I politely asked for them to remake them like I asked in the first place the serve argued but then finally re made them. They were brought out a second time almost the same but this time the pancakes were swimming in a sea of butter. I politely stated this still isn't what I ordered and stated I have order them before at the other location and at this location once before and the server argued with me stating I was in the wrong so I just said never mind can I just get normal pancakes. The normal pancakes finally came out fine. The couple next to us even stated that that was ridiculous they even knew what I wanted. Pancakes topped with bananas and whip cream. When the check was presented nothing was discounted she charged us for extra items then when we asked to see a manger she said she was the manager and kept telling us we were in the wrong and she had a very hostile attitude  I don't appreciate being treated that way no costumer should.

On to the restaurant, it's a nice size spot inside a new looking plaza (no shade parking though) sigh
Everyone working there is really friendly and after the recommendations we decided to order french toast combo w sausage and eggs, country fried steak and eggs, add: red velvet pancakes ($1.50 extra), cranberry juice and chocolate milk. Everything tasted wonderful but the red velvet pancakes itself just taste like pancakes w red dye...it def lacks the red velvet cake flavor.  But if you combine the whip cream and white sugar syrup that comes w it, it sord of resembles that flavor.  The chocolate milk taste like milk w a hint of chocolate (I think).

There were multiple bussers standing around watching the football game while there were dirty tables everywhere with guests waiting to be sat and when they did start cleaning tables took forever to clean and would drop things on the floor without picking it up, had inappropriate conversations with each other while using foul language right in earshot of guests, servers on their cell phones behind the counter, drinks unfilled... or no drinks all together, 3 hosts standing around chit chatting with each other. 

I am a restaurant manager and see past most things and even give excuses but on this occasion, I cannot. If I were the owner, I'd want to know! Gave me anxiety just being there for 45 mins.

A friend was raving about this cafe, so based on her recommendation I gave it a try this morning for breakfast. 
First off, I have been in hospitality for years and know what good high quality food is supposed to look and taste like. 
Unfortunately this was some of the worst I've ever had. The corned beef hash was over salted and even when mixing some of the egg yolk in, was barely edible. I was excited to try their homemade Kalua pork which came highly recommended by a very nice server. Sadly, it was soupy and slimy with a faint smoke flavor added. The pancakes were the worst I've ever had and interestingly this cafe prides itself offering a vast variety of them. They were a tough and chewy inedible disaster. They looked nice and fluffy, however so much baking soda was added to give them their beautiful appearance, that it completely destroyed the flavor. I want to taste buttermilk or a hint of sweetness, not salty baking soda. And let's talk about the side of fruit, when I thought it could not get any worse. The fruit was old and obviously has been sitting in the fridge for days. Rubbery translucent cantaloupe and honeydew and old strawberry slices. I normally do not complain but I did end up speaking to the manager. Although dressed as server she, did agree with everything I said, confirmed the fruit was cut yesterday and has been refrigerated and also agreed with the horrible pancakes and Kalua pork. My meal was comped and she thanked me for bringing this to her attention. Amazingly the place was packed and based on the items I have tried I don't even want to imagine what the rest of the menu tastes and looks like. 
If you need help to raise your food quality and standards, I've also been a restaurant consultant for years and would be happy to assist. Sadly, this was atrocious...",XI3uLaAjl94up6UpjtvedQ,0,0,1,fn506jGbNRxOB_2oYLtdGw

There is a large variety of menu options. I always have a hard time choosing what I want to eat, because I always crave anything from them. If you're looking to eat something sweet and savory, I would go with ordering a plate on the back (ex: Spam & eggs) that plate already comes with hashbrowns/potatoes AND a side of buttermilk pancakes (which you can upgrade!!) 

I always go with the Spam & Eggs, with hashbrowns & Red velvet pancakes.

The adobo fried rice is super yummy as well (however it is more on the salty side, so it's better to have if youre sharing). 

White chocolate macadamia pancakes & banana foster pancakes are 11/10. Love how they are not too sweet.

I tried to keep it simple and I ordered the Kaula Pork grilled sandwich, instead of ordering French fries like usual, I upgraded my side to a babystack of pancakes. I settled for Ricky Road, and I was super glad. The pancakes were rich and full of goodies- marshmallows, Chocolate syrup, almond slivers and whip cream.  I almost was able to finish one stack until my son ate the rest, my lil Chocolate monster stole my stack.  But it was okay the Sourdough grilled sandwich filled with kaula Pork was good and fulfilling.  I left the table full and content.
My husband ordered the Portuguese omelette and love it, he was torn on ordering the Kalbi short ribs- but the waiter suggested the omelette and my husband enjoyed his omelette and was very full. His omelette almost looked like a burrito filled with sausage and veggies. 

My son ordered the quesadilla and he was a happy camper, he wasn't a fan of the fries, because they were topped with seasoning salt, so his fries were red and not the usual color. Maybe not a big deal to most, but for picky eaters it is.  Was I mad? Nope- more fries for me while he ate my pancakes:/
So overall the restaurant usually has a wait, and the locations are small. So seating can cause the lines of waiting long.  Is it worth the wait? Yes- Yes it is. Is the food good? Yes-Yes it is Would I come back again- Yes- Yes I would.....",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,1,1,5,fnkd5azJfTjdRh6tW1ZlZA

I ordered an adobo fried rice omelette that I've gotten many times before that was saltier than anything I've ever tasted in my life. Ever. It's like they dropped the salt shaker in the pan when cooking or the lid to the soy sauce came off or something. It was really that bad. So I had someone else try it and they spit it out.

Sent it back and they said it's supposed to be salty and if they bring out another it will be the same since it's pre-made in advance. Again, I've had it before and it was never like this. Anyone who could shovel that down has defective taste buds.

There's not enough good things to say how great this place is. Friendly service and a familiar, yet unique menu. 

I got Chili Loco Moco w/ garlic rice and wow. I would've never thought to put two of my favorite things together, but what a match made in heaven. The chili is meaty, the rice garlicky, and the eggs runny. It's great loco moco that is elevated by chili and cheese. I got it with a side of their homemade mac salad and that was also amazing. It wasn't over the top heavy on the sauce and was a cool contrast to the chili. 

However, my partner probably got the star dish. The chicken adobo fried rice omelette with hash browns. W-o-w. Great flavor and the egg ""wrap"" really added a silky texture against the rice and chicken. 

Both dishes are very flavorful and a unique take on simple breakfast items. The price is very reasonable and the portions are huge. Definitely have to come back to try their pancakes, they looked amazing but I was lured by the chili loco moco. No regrets, just have to have a return visit. 10/10 would recommend.

The location is great from my home, literally down the street. Variety wise on the menu, they got it down. I was expecting a bit more because the hype was so built up. Now being able to experience it for myself, I was satisfied but not to the point where i wanted to finish my food. 

I ordered the Piglet Skillet. If you want unseasoned over fried potatoes and barely any cheese and overdone scrambled eggs; I definitely recommend this dish. It was really dry, like something they just threw together on the grill without any seasonings. 

My parents ordered the Senior breakfast both exactly the same except one with scrambled eggs and the other with over easy eggs. Our waiter failed to comprehend that. He thoughtfully replaces the eggs and let us keep the old eggs. Over all the food was okay, just wish it wasn't bland. Oh and mind you, we asked for condiments including salt and pepper and he failed to bring the salt and pepper. 

 Our waiter, he was nice at first. Greeted us once we sat down but after he brought us our order of drinks, it began going downhill from there. He checked up on us once throwout our whole 45 minutes there. I had to signal him down for him to come to our table. It's funny cause he would look our way but not make his way.

4767537,2017-07-06,0,6fz0hnNIVpLF5v2NqJfA9w,"Came here with a few of my friends and the boyfriend on a very hot Las Vegas morning.  It was a Friday and it was packed!  We waited for a good amount of time but nothing too long.  The hostess seemed a little overwhelmed since he was trying to man the cash register, seat people and get the to go orders all at the same time.  Any case, he got through his list of things to do and we were seated in no time.  The menu is a little overwhelming.  There were so many options to choose from - from adobo fried rice to Portuguese sausage to the variety of pancakes and to sandwiches.  Again, it was overwhelming to choose what to eat!  In any case, we placed our ordered and waited for a good 10 minutes or so and we had our breakfast.

The boyfriend ordered the cookies and cream short stack.  It came with three pancakes and a huge dollop of fresh whipped cream.  As well as a side of cream cheese syrup.  He was in heaven.  He loved every bite of it.  I had a piece and it was just way toooooo sweet for me, but like I stated, it was perfect for the boyfriend.  I ordered Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice.  It was wrapped up in an omelette and I had a side of hash browns.  It was carbs on carbs.  The fried rice was a little too dry for me.  A part of me should have asked (if it was offered and doable) if I could get the eggs over easy.  The omelette was cooked a little too well done and if it was a little runny, it would have been great with the rice.  I love runny yolk with rice.  Overall, the flavor was great, it was a little too dry for my preference.  The other items that my friends ordered looked great and everyone loved their meal.  After it was all said and done, our bill came out to less than $70, which was great considering we ordered A LOT of food.

They always have great pancakes and you can always add the speciality pancakes to any breakfast. This is what I always do so I can have the egg, sausage, etc breakfast with something yummy and sweet!

Today I decided to get the two egg breakfast with my eggs done over easy along with the potatoes with the tiramisu pancakes. I also decided to get a side of toast so I could dip it in my eggs. The tiramisu pancakes were the limited edition pancake so I had to try that. They were amazing! I recommend them if they are still on the menu when you visit.

So I waved my hand up in the air like ""CAN I ORDER"" and the girl raised her hand back up at me and was like ""YOU WANNA ORDER""?? Ok b.... don't get sassy with me. Got you one star docked for that.

We ordered a variety of different items and shared. It was delicious and inexpensive. The red velvet pancakes were so good as well as the white chocolate pancakes. I don't think I will ever enjoy a pancake as much as I did here. What's the recipe?

My friend got the corn beef hash and it was so disgustingly salty. Had to break our sunny side up eggs on it and taint it with the potatoes then drown it in the disgustingly overbuttered toast that she forgot to bring out. Potato's were deliciously cooked and crisped to the T! Although it was extremely salty and almost killed my taste buds one bite of those pancakes drowned my sorrows away and I was back at my A game.

This location is easily accessible off Blue Diamond and Cimarron. Parking can be slim pickings depending on when you go since it's shared with nearby stores, and since Babystacks is normally pretty packed all the time.

Just like all their other locations, besides their specialty pancakes and their Hawaiian/Filipino-inspired dishes listed on their menu, they also have off-menu offerings which are constantly changing depending on the seasons and holidays. One thing that I have noticed they've done a little differently with their food is that their omelettes are LOADED with cheese on top. As much as I love cheese, sometimes it's a little too much, in my opinion. Different strokes, different folk. 

Also similar to their sister locations (with the exception of the northwest location on Durango), the space is a little small & seating is pretty limited, so expect to wait a little bit to be seated (again, depending on when you go).

The pancakes... Oh so good. Im glad I picked the chocolate chip. It was a great topping along with the whipped cream & powdered sugar. The pancakes were soft and fluffy. I really enjoyed them.

The staff is very friendly and the food is big and delicious. We both got the scrambled eggs with corn beef hash and some of their bacon pancakes. Everything was delicious it came out quickly it came out hot and we were very full once we were done.  
The bacon pancakes and syrup were a definite hit !",FRxGcIRukrH5lW2SQSxstg,0,0,4,NuxZiadVPo9Sc8GQK98-Wg

They ensured my order was correct and if anything, would change it. 

I've dined here a couple of times and never have I had a bad experience. Food and beverage always up to standards.

Keep it up guys! Will be back for sure!",cMva3C2QbmmvW1flAwsNVQ,0,0,5,P18PvA2U4ReeKKhVzmgCBQ
5902764,2017-11-24,3,6fz0hnNIVpLF5v2NqJfA9w,"Babystacks is a great breakfast place with awesome pancake options and island influence. The service is good, the portions are filling, and the price is just right.

I recommend the Two-Egg Breakfast. It's great for the indecisive diner, who has trouble choosing between a sweet or savory breakfast. And for only $6.25, you can get both in the form of two eggs cooked any style, potatoes or rice, and a small stack of pancakes or toast. And as president of the hypothetical potato fan club, I'm definitely an advocate on behalf of these potatoes. These potatoes are well-seasoned, slightly crispy, but remain wonderfully fluffy in the center. And even though rice is life, that's my shit. 

As for pancake recommendations, I definitely recommend the strawberry pancakes. While the other pancakes are delicious, I find them overwhelmingly sweet and tap out after a few bites. But I NEVER get sick of the strawberry pancakes. Not only are they a classic flavor combination, the syrup tastes fresh and feels like the perfect counterweight to the pancakes.

Overall, Babystacks is definitely one of my favorite breakfast diner options!",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,5,5,4,9MBP-yTR9gN4Xwlh2r2grg

If you are in the mood for something unique this place is it.  Love the Gigantic water glasses, service was awesome and Filipino Friendly...I tried their house special breakfast which is Adobo Rice wrapped in egg...looks like a burrito made of egg....It had very good flavor.
