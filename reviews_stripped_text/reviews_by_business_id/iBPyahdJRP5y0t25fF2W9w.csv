They have too many courses for you to consume. They should instead of be focussing on more of a ""foodie"" theme of high quality product with a smaller portion and great presentation.  It would have been nice to have some higher quality proteins  (there was not one fish dish).  Everything was filling but not in a foodie wow what was that I just had experience.

The variety of food was interesting and very good. I was worried that I would walk away still hungry from only sampling bits of meals from each restaurant, but I went home that more full than I normally am. 

Our tour guide's name was Arizona. She was extremely informative, fun, talkative, and really made the tour fun and exciting. I loved that she included information on different art pieces as we walked from one casino to the next. The tour took just over 3 hours but I didn't feel rushed one bit as everything was planned out nearly perfectly.

We met at the Aria waterfall, and began our journey. Our fabulous guide, Donald, not only talked about the restaurants, but also knew much about the buildings and casinos. There were little extra asides that I will not mention here, so as not to spoil the surprise and delight. We waltzed into some of the best restaurants on the strip and sat down at our reserved tables with absolutely no waiting whatsoever. We were treated like VIPs by the host/hostess, waitstaff, and chefs, alike. The food was beyond delicious. Duck and noodles and paella and tomatoes that I would sell my children for... haha. There was such an excellent variety of dishes at each and every place, but they all fit together like they were made for each other. Donald is the one who chooses them in advance, and boy, does he know his food! The walking between the restaurants was perfect, not too much, but a nice breather to get ready for the next yummy foray. What a fantastic way to check out different restaurants! We talked about it for a week! I highly recommend this for foodies, visitors to Vegas who don't know where to eat, any type of celebration, taking people out that you want to impress, (and they will be impressed) and for anyone that wants to have a fabulously fun food filled experience that you will not get anywhere else. It could not be better. I will definitely be doing this again...and again.",7p2hCRXM55HRrTGrCJSAkg,1,0,5,xc7xqkx409d_T06fBgAqyA

I was excited to try a ""foodie tour"" and was definitely surprised that no one else has thought of this idea already. Lip Smacker brings a group of people to experience different restaurants all in one night; our group experienced 4 restaurants and ended the night with desserts on our last stop. The restaurants we stopped at were different cuisines so we were able to try a variety of delicious dishes, such as, street market Asian food, Chinese/Mexican fusion, French, and a bean to bar dessert restaurant.  The dishes that were ordered were the restaurant's signature dishes or their most popular dish.  I was also happy that Donald was our tour leader; he was extremely knowledgeable not only on the restaurants we dined at but the whole Strip as well! Along the way to each restaurant, Donald was able to answer any of the group's questions and even gave us some random facts of the Strip. I thought Donald did such an amazing job planning and executing this whole tour for us. The little things in this tour definitely made my experience from meeting the chefs while we dined to ending our night in front of the Bellagio Fountains eating desserts.

The FINEST cuisine, TOP-RATED restaurants, these are THE places to go. You receive 3 or 4 of their signature dishes at EACH of FOUR restaurants. That's a lot of food, 12 different dishes, but an excellent way to sample the BEST OF LAS VEGAS- as they were named. When I travel to different countries, they arrange my trip schedule and restaurants. I enjoy whenever I have a food 
or cooking tour to learn the recipes of the countries. 
The Lip Smacking Foodie Tour is different, everything is ready for us when we arrive at each restaurant providing plenty of time to relax, a take-your-time-dining and meeting the other guests. The 4 restaurants are in hotels- ARIA, COSMOPOLITAN & CRYSTALS SHOPPING CENTER next to each other. During the tour, the guide is knowledgeable with exciting information about the restaurants and hotels. 
I recommend this tour highly and would like to take both of their other Las Vegas new restaurants tour as well as their evening tour with a helicopter ride!

The restaurants we visited on this tour were Javier's (Mexican) at the Aria Hotel, Estancia Milos (Greek) & Jaleo (avant garde Spanish tapas by Jose Andre) at the Cosmopolitan, and Hexx (chocolate) at the Paris Hotel. I've only been on one other food tour before so I'll use that as a point of comparison. The prices of a Lip Smacking Foodie Tour are probably on the higher end, being equivalent to a really nice meal on the Strip; however you definitely get your money's worth. 

Restaurants were on the higher end of the scale and sampling portions were generous. Often, food tours give you hor dourves-sized sampling portions, but this one left us full. It was like going out for a nice meal, but rather than just eating at one restaurant, we at the signature dishes of several restaurants. The chefs at each of the restaurants are very particular about the ingredients they use or how a dish is made. As a foodie, these stories behind the food or restaurants were fascinating to hear, and you truly feel like you're enjoying something really special.

According to Donald, the owner and founder who also acted as our tour guide, the restaurants that are visited differ depending upon the time of day and week. It was also nice to hear that they also do take into account any dietary restrictions to ensure everyone gets the most out of their tour.

Service and food quality are all top notch.",Xlsaq96gimYUvGD-aZAJxQ,0,0,5,IBUsVeuTUjnB32YDZ8uWRA

Some of my favorites were the the shrimp & crab enchiladas at Javier's, the fried zucchini dish at Milos, spicy cucumbers at Momofuku, and the pistachio custard dessert at Cucina. 

Donald stopped briefly in between restaurants to educate us about some of the awesome sculptures and art installations we passed along the way.  He also provided great tips on where else we can eat and where to go for the best view of the strip.

Lipsmacking Foodie Tours is a great introduction. You're treated like royalty.  Upon arrival I was promptly greeted by my tour guide Donald.  We gathered as a group and the fun began.

It starts out with a brief history of the architecture, marvelous art collections and celebrity chefs.
It was a short walk to our first stellar destination.
The atmosphere and sublime cuisine of each of the restaurants is par Excellance.  Impeccably presented and served.  Donald made it fun and described each dish in detail.

I highly recommend the beverage package.
Each restaurant has its own signature cocktail that is in perfect balance with the cuisine.

The staff at each location treats you like a VIP.  The service is kind and unhurried with your dishes arriving promptly.

Along the way you are treated to visually stunning art installations, boutique shops and amazing water features.

There was an extra special piece of flair at each location that average guests don't get. All of the dishes were at a gourmet level and shared among the table. We tasted three dishes at four different restaurants and ended with a fun boutique experience at a vintage shop. It was thoroughly satisfying! And there was food left over in almost every course so I could have eaten more if I had wanted to. They only thing I'd like to add would be a little treat to kick off the tour...

My husband said he liked the Mexican fare at Javier's in Aria the best. One burrito was filled with crabmeat and smothered in a delicate sauce. My husband said he would have rolled around in that sauce if there was enough of it! We didn't buy the drink tickets, but several people did. The drinks looked delicious.

We go to Vegas annually and have done restaurants like Joel Robuchon, Picasso, Le Cirque, Alize...we are foodies so it's not just the high end restaurants, we've also done the off strip places like Kabuto, Oyster bar, Raku, Soho etc.  This year, we were just looking for a new Vegas dining experience and of course Yelp comes through because I found Lip Smacking Foodie Tours.  What can I say that have not been said by others?  Anytime you have the opportunity to meet and speak with the owner/chef is a treat in my opinion.  At times, they personally came out and brought the dishes out to you! Amazing!!  I loved what they are doing with Downtown and how passionate folks are about keeping it going.  Met some really good, fun people!  I felt like we were friends just hanging out in Vegas, tour downtown together.  Donald, the owner, was our guide and he provided some insider information that we would not have been able to get on our own.  There was a tiny mix up on the reservation which was no problem but he treated us to shots to make up for it!  Lastly, if I may offer this tip- splurge and go for the drinks also because they were unique cocktails that I've never tried before and made by folks who knew what they were doing! don't pass it up!!  Thanks Donald.  We will see you next year for the Strip tour!",nQBMc1Dd0ZwFJvTErKq0rQ,0,0,5,Xd9-_ubLDQHWlbHauT0VsA

It was my brother's 30th birthday and I wanted to be sure we did something different and special to celebrate- the tour went above and beyond expectations. My entire family was thrilled with the food and Donald.
On top of touring four of the best restaurants on the strip, we got a behind the scenes tour of how Hexx manufactures their chocolate from bean to bar. I felt like a kid in Willy Wonka's factory, except a kid who could appreciate the finer points of chocolatier work and wine pairings.

We also had the chance to view and try on several vintage eye wear, some worn by celebrities during filming.   I was nervous when I saw duck and escargot on the menu but everything was delicious!

And one big thing I want to mention: Donald and the restaurants did a great job catering to vegetarians. That's a huge deal and not easy! At no point did I feel short changed because of my dietary restrictions -- Donald and the chefs made sure to substitute dishes and take care of us! Thank you!

Some of the food was amazing (Milos was fantastic).  Some was mediocre (Mommafuku's ramen was terrific, but their bun was okay, and cucumbers were not great).  We had expected the tour to cover more ground distance wise, so we were a little surprised to spend the tour in two main hotels right next to each other. It might be better to name this a food tasting rather than tour since tour suggests seeing the city/strip a bit more. One tip is to make sure at each stop, each person receives a plate with all the food to try. At one stop it was family style, and Donald served us, which was fine, but at another, it was family style platters with each person helping him/herself, and it felt a little rushed trying to get a bite with so many other ppl trying to also (that stop didn't seem to have enough food, and it was also the best food, so everyone was excited to try it and scarfed it up).  Also, it would've been nice to know ahead of time where we were headed. I understand it can be fun to keep it a secret, but knowing ahead of time would've helped us plan our other meals and be sure not to overlap. Finally, we totally understood including a journalist on the tour so she could write about it, but it would've been nice to have a warning and get permission for her to film us all. The videoing was a bit distracting esp of the food we were excited to eat. I would definitely recommend this tour to others. It's a fun, different way to try some food in Vegas.

You are served 3-4 tastings at 4-5 different restaurants including some of the most highly-acclaimed places. Tour groups are led by highly knowledgable and friendly guides and you're given VIP seating. Sometimes, you even get VIP treatment from restaurant staff. Not only do you get to eat amazing food, you also get a few extra nuggets of info about artwork and architecture along the way as well as notable businesses like the vintage eyeglass store called Retrospecs & Co. in the Cosmopolitan. Our tour guide Ray was friendly, funny and accommodating. Guide-in-training Stacy was along for the ride as well who helped with even more information and to wrangle everyone. My only bit of constructive criticism would be that, although she was helpful and very friendly, a few times, she was talking about one thing while Ray was talking about something else which got to be confusing. This is likely an exception to the rule since not every tour has someone being trained so, I still give this company 5 stars.

We hit Javier's, Milos, Jaleo and China Poblano. All served very good/high-quality food. There wasn't a single dish I didn't like. If only I could afford to eat at all these places on a regular basis!

Vegas in my mind has always been where you go to party non-stop, filled with gambling, clubs, drinking and that was about it.  I knew I wanted to try something different and experience good food so I did a little research before arriving to see what that something ""different"" would be for us. 

I came across the Lip Smacking Foodie Tours online and immediately knew this would take the guessing game out of where we would eat but held off from buying tickets until we arrived in Vegas because I wanted to ask around first.

As we arrived and asked a few people if they had heard about this ""Foodie Tour"" nobody seemed to know what we were referring to until our concierge said he personally knew the owner named Donald and proceeded to give us his direct phone number (on the side).  After settling in our hotel room we called Donald to see if we could book a tour that night and he told us he had an opening; all we had to do was book it online.  That was easy and THE BEST DECISION we ever made in Vegas!  Our tour guide that night, Abra,  was beyond informative of all the cuisine we tasted that night from where ingredients came from, how they were prepared to funny tidbits of the places we visited.  She was knowledgeable of the history of the areas we walked through, the restaurants and it's chefs.  Abra was very friendly, funny, and definitely knew her food along with history.   We felt like we struck gold with this gem of a tour.  Best money spent in Vegas for sure!  We loved this tour so much, two days later we decided to contact Donald again and he was able to put together a Foodie Tour in old Las Vegas which is going through a restoration process but you wouldn't really notice with all the new hip and new places we visited.  Again another great tour, this time with Donald, the President of Lip Smacking Foodie Tours.  I can't stop telling people of all the great places we visited on this tour and all the delicious food.  In a way I'm glad not many people know about this tour because it is the BEST kept secret in town, no waits, no lines, just come with an empty belly...but really, EVERYONE should know about this tour.  Lip Smacking Foodie Tour I wish you were in my city of Boston!  

If you are on the fence about this tour, let me take the doubt away.  DO IT! BOOK IT NOW!  You'll learn how these local establishments came to be, who owns them, and some pretty interesting stories they have to share.  It's a great way to kick off your way around town.  Definitely sign up for the Old Vegas (Freemont) tour and see how a community is coming together to bring a new vibe to Old Vegas.

Donald, if you open a Lip Smacking Foodie Tour up in your home town of Chicago I will visit Chicago again in a heartbeat just to come take your Foodie tour! Actually, let us know if you ever open another one ANYWHERE else! We'll be there! Thank you again for showing us a great time in Vegas, the excellent food stops, history, suggestions of what to check out after and most importantly for showing me that I was completely wrong about Vegas...there IS more to Vegas than just non-stop partying, gambling and clubs....there are great people who truly are passionate about their city & love their crafts such as yourself, Abra (You were such a pleasure, we loved all the warmth you brought to our tours), Matt (Carson Kitchen), Roberto(Banger brewery), list goes on of all the great people we met and not to mention the AWESOME FOOD we experienced!

1753726,2017-06-30,0,iBPyahdJRP5y0t25fF2W9w,"I have attended Foodie tours twice now and have not been disappointed. The first one I did the tour on the Strip with the helicopter finale. Secondly, the Downtown tour which was also good, I just wish I hadn't been late and missed the first restaurant.
This tour is specifically designed to give the guest a taste of the best dishes at each restaurant. You won't get this anywhere else. You'd have to get the full portion if you did this yourself. Their cocktail option which I recommend since I've done it twice is also a great enhancement.
The Strip tour started at the Aria with Bardot Brassiere, then follows with Sage (they have a large collection of Absinthe and that is the cocktail they will give you with a presentation), Milo's at the Cosmopolitan, then Jaleo, and ends with dessert at Wolfgang Puck at Crystals. My favorites dishes were at Sage and Milo's, even though I enjoyed trying the rest of the restaurants as well. Jaleo didn't have any dish that was outstanding to me in flavor but still great creativity (using a shoe as a plate).
Downtown Tour: Started at Carson's Kitchen which I missed but they raved about the Fried Pork Skin, Therapy was delicious (they're known for the Red Velvet Waffle and Fried Chicken Sandwich). Signature cocktail is a Blackberry Smash. You get a bit of facts about downtown and enjoy a signature cocktail at the Insider which had a rooftop balcony (Cilantro Lemonade was delicious). You end at Tumeric which is a new Indian restaurant. They also give you a tour on how they make Naan bread. Very spiceful and flavorful. Signature cocktail is a Sangria.
I can't wait to keep trying these tours. Good job!",WOkJHL8NjovE3kRLy5AfmQ,3,0,5,H13vTx9oJQJ9lV4i_bae3w

I would say this was the highlight of my Vegas Trip.  It was either Donnie and Marie show or Don (Foodie tour).

I was solo. Do not be afraid to go alone.  Everyone was friendly. There were 7 on our afternoon tour. I was concerned about all the walking. No problem. The 4 restaurants were split between 2 properties. The properties were next to each other!

Don the host was a peach. Friendly, interactive and knowledgable. He had made arrangements with 4 top of the line restaurants. Each different from the other. The food was wonderful. We had 3 offerings at the first 3. There were 4 at the restaurant we had dessert. 

At home when making a list of restaurants I wanted to try I had crossed off the ones that were on the tour. They were more upscale and pricey. After the tour I realized you get what you pay for. I learned that these restaurants had super fresh food.  Sometimes organic.  They have deals with farms and such to produce high quality for them. After the tour I saw that I would most likely go back for lunch. 

At each place Don told us background about the restaurant. Very interesting. At one we even met the chef. 

As the food digests we walk from place to place.  He pointed out sculptures and gave us interesting information about the hotels and sculptures. Wish I had a photographic memory when it came to the information. We also stopped in a high end optical store.  One of the employees explained the concept and showed us frames. Very interesting.

I much of a drinker and I took the drink package.  Wise decision. It is a little more but glad I did.
I hate to give spoilers however my favorite place was Javier's.
I feel that Don makes the tour his life. He strives for best food, best service and makes sure everything goes smoothly. My next trip to Vegas will include  Lip Smacking Foodie Tour.  I may do an evening tour or possibly a Downtown tour. Take your tour at the beginning of your stay. That way you can go back to the restaurant.

The food was EXCELLENT and our tour guide Abra was very nice, informative, professional and great to hang with.

(Say that 3x fast...mouthful just like the slider).  A sneak peek into a private bar, Inspire...and then on to 7th and Carson.  Saving the best for last.  Their Hearth Oven Bread + Dip 4 ways was absolutely divine.  You can watch them bake the bread in their open pizza oven and see it ""puff"".  Eat it while it's hot!  And do not pass on dessert.

We have taken quite a few food tours and while we highly recommend this one, our one critique might be that typically there is a bit more walking on the tours giving a little more time to digest.  This was a ton of food in a short period of time and by the last restaurant even though the food was delicious it was hard to eat it because we were so full!

My favorite and first of our 4 stops of our afternoon strip tour with Donald was Herringbone at Aria. This was the only stop where each diner was given their own plate. The Ahi Poke, meatball slider, and hot wing were exceptional. Their $18 Signature cocktail ""Better Mules & Gardens"" was phenomenal.

Our 2nd stop was at Javier's at Aria. Good Mexican food here. Their chips and salsa were very fresh and left a nice kick.The seafood and chicken enchiladas with rice and beans were served family style, and everyone received probably 1/2-2/3 of each enchilada. My fav was the seafood enchilada eith shrimp and crab meat. We dined in their exclusive dining room. 

3rd on the stop was Milos at the Cosmo. My least fav of the 4 stops, but still good. We sll enjoyed a large portion of their super fresh greek salad and tasted a smallish offering of octupus which was ok. My wife and I loved the lightly fried zucchini.

Lastly, we walked over to HEXX Kitch for a little tour of their kitchen and some educationabout the process of making chocolate, and were able to taste samples of 4 different chocolates and beans from around the world. The 3 desserts we sampled here were all tasty, but unfortunately none were a knocout. 

In summary, this is a great way to kill some time, try some great food, and learn a little about LV. Donald is a gentleman and was kind to offer advice and give suggestions about different restaurants. He even gave us the idea to do our own foodie tour one day and we did it the next night at Cosmo and had a blast (Short Rib Mac and cheese at Beauty and Essex, Sliders and Jalapeno Cheese Grits at STK, and the Caramel Budino dessert at DOCG - best dessert in town). 

The only suggestion I have to improve this tour would be to have a waiter or even Donald plate the family-serve type dishes at the restaurants where it is prepared that way for the tour. I always felt a little uncomfortable serving myself and possibly short changing someone else or them short changing me.

My wife and I signed up for a mid-week afternoon tour.  We opted for the beverage package as well.  We were pleasantly surprised to be Donald's captive audience for the next almost 3 hours.  I'm almost glad it worked out that way because we received a lot of personalized attention.  It also gave me the opportunity to ask Donald a lot of questions about how he got started, how he decided on his company's name, how he contracts with restaurants of such high quality, and what his vision is for company growth.  Donald is a delightful young entrepreneur with a bright future ahead of him!

We started our tour at Javier's  in Aria.  We started with a margarita and chips and salsa.  Ask for the habanero salsa if you're adventurous!  We had a trio of enchiladas with chicken, shrimp, and crab.  The restaurant is beautiful with a semi-nautical theme.  We toured the private dining room which costs thousands of dollars just to reserve.  There is a wood mural along one wall that was carved with a chain saw.  There are a lot of interesting things to see within the mural.  Take pictures to review later.  The owner's two sons are carved into the mural on the top right.
 
We then ventured over to Estiatorio Milos in Cosmopolitan.  We had the basil press cocktail.  We had the tomato salad with feta, olive oil, and Greek herbs.  It seems so simple, but was the best we've ever had!  The fried zucchini and eggplant with tatziki sauce and kefalograviera cheese is out of this world.  Be sure to take pictures when it first comes out and after the server prepares it for eating.
  
Our next stop was Jaleo by Jose Andres.  Hands-down the best Spanish tapas and paellas you could ask for!  We had rosemary lemonade served in a porron decanter.  It's meant to be passed around and poured directly into your mouth from the long spout.  You'll have fun seeing how far you can pull it away from your mouth while continually pouring without making a mess!  We ate chicken fritters (croquetas de pollo) that were served in a sneaker (fun presentation!).  The paella was made fresh right in front of us on a million-dollar wood-burning setup with ventilation system.  It was as fun watching them cook the food as it was enjoying the Spanish flavors.  We also learned about his secret restaurant , ""e"", which has a 3-month waiting list just to get into.  We will plan a vacation just around that reservation soon!

Last but not least was Hexx kitchen + bar in Paris.  It's a true bean-to-bar facility.  After touring how the chocolate is made, we tasted chocolate samples from Peru, Tanzania, Venezuela, Ecuador, and Madagascar.  We then sat in the restaurant and sampled the Aztec cake made with Venezuela chocolate, spiced ganache, cinnamon icing, and toasted almonds.   We were also treated to chocolate pudding made with Tanzania chocolate, cocoa nib infused cream, and banana bread crumble.
  
We would have gladly followed Donald anywhere else but, unfortunately, that was the end of our tour.  We cannot say enough great things about the hospitality from Donald as well as all the restaurant staff.  We skirted past wait lines and had VIP seating waiting on us everywhere.  It really was the highlight of our mini-vacation.  We will be back!

It was nice to see that Donald has a good relationship with the staff and management at all the restaurants we went to.

One unexpected surprise was the chocolate tasting. We got to go to the room where all the chocolate was prepared and tasted various different chocolates. That was really interesting and unique. Also the best chocolate came from Ecuador and that's where my parent's are from.

One pit stop was to a fancy sunglass shop. the owner showed us the first pair of Ray Ban's and other stuff. I personally don't give two shits about sunglasses so I thought it was a bit of a waste of time but we were only there for about 5 minutes so it wasn't a big deal.

I opted to add the drink package which was an additional $60 and included 4 signature drinks. I felt this is where the night lost a couple of points. These weren't really full 'drinks' more like a tasting. I would expect to be slightly buzzed after 4 drinks and I totally wasn't. Also I didn't care for one of the drinks. (I know, I'm being a picky bitch but just keeping it real....) You have the option to purchase your own drinks at each of the restaurants so if you're on the fence about the drink add-on you can always just do that.

The choices of locations were all so very diverse in cuisine and we got to basically have a progressive dinner ending the tour with incredible sweets for dessert. Adding to the value of the experience were history and tidbits about some of the locations and of Las Vegas. 

I'd say the service of each restaurant was well executed and very well selected. 

What stands out the most of this unique tour was the impeccable service from the staff at Lip Smacking Foodie tours. From the start during their greetings, to escorting us through the tour to the wrapping up the night, we were well taken care of, entertained and it was if they were 10 steps ahead of us for all our needs along the way.

Based on all the good reviews, I decided to give Lip Smacking Foodie Tours a try for me and boyfriend's anniversary. The other reviews are right when they say to do this tour at the beginning of your Vegas trip! 

We did the Afternoon Culinary Adventure with the drink package. We were seated immediately at each restaurant and each of the dishes were explained to us before being passed around. There was plenty of food to go around. Between each stop Donald and Abra shared information about the artwork, buildings, and other things in the area. At each restaurant they told us really interesting facts about the owners and what makes that restaurant unique. There were a couple of dishes that I didn't think I would like but everything tasted GREAT! 

We did this tour on the last full day of our trip but we still went to one of the restaurants from the tour the next day for lunch before we went to the airport. Donald and Abra also gave us their card in case we needed any suggestions from them for the rest of our trip. I will definitely  go on another one of the tours on my next trip to Vegas (if you've done one before or have any dietary restrictions, they can tailor the tour to your needs). I can't wait for them to expand to other cities.",aMVDOONv_uwUSVKIMOlJYg,0,0,5,o8s9_dTW7UVlxTBx9XYtAA

2789394,2015-10-26,0,iBPyahdJRP5y0t25fF2W9w,"In planning our trip to Vegas we knew that, since we are not big clubbers, we were looking to do shows and other fun things in the evenings. We booked two shows and went looking on the internet to find something ""different"". When we came upon the Lip Smacking Foodie Tour we knew that it was for us. My wife and I both like to cook and we have visited most of the upper-tier restaurants in and around Chicago. We signed up for the evening strip tour with drinks. We hesitated when we saw the price but we said, what the heck, it seems overpriced but let's do it anyway.

We met our guides Abra and Donald, and the four other tour participants in front of the Aria at 6PM. For the next four hours we were treated to gracious hosts, reserved seating, luscious food and delicious drinks. An easy cop-out for the tour would to be to go the well known chef driven restaurants, the Guy Fieri's, the Wolfgang Puck's, etc... What we did instead was to go to the lesser know chef driven restaurants where the food is really delivered with commitment and passion. At each stop we were given three, and sometimes four, of the chefs signature dishes. I could not tell you which stop was my favorite as they were all great. We were always very heartily welcomed at the restaurants. The staff, and sometimes the chef him/her self, would come out to explain the dishes and to thank us for coming. Be ready for somewhat adventurous eating. If meatloaf and mashed potatoes is your idea of a great meal out then this is probably not for you. And the drinks, they were always plentiful and delicious. They were also sure to complimented the food being served. Surprisingly, one was very elaborate, involving fire and alcohol vapor sipped from a beaker. Not only did the tour provide us with great food and drink, along the route we were treated to a behind the scenes tour and tasting of how chocolate was made and a very interesting stop at a unique shop that we had walked by several time without really noticing. Very cool! Don and Abra also pointed out several art installations that we had missed before. Nothing like a little culture with your movable feast.

The following day, when we showed the concierge at our hotel the prior evening's itinerary she was very impressed. She said that these were some of here favorite restaurants and that they were definitely ""under the radar"" for most tourists.  She said that she plans now to take the tour herself.

So, all in all it was a great experience. The food and drink was fantastic. The hosts did a great job and the walking part of the tour was interesting and enlightening. As far as the cost of the tour in concerned, we now feel that it is a drop dead bargain. If the experience sounds good to you, do not let the price deter you. I think that you will find that it is well worth the price of admission.",m-IbsFljVVa1UB6qJs768A,0,0,5,StBmtHDrtca39BmX2balcg

Had great food at Javier's and Milos, and toured the chocolate kitchen before having dessert at Hexx.
All of the stops were great, and they even made special accommodations for me as a foodie with gluten and dairy allergies. I was thrilled to find out they had notified the restaurants ahead of time about my allergies, so when we arrived, special plates had already been prepared without me having to say anything or wait on special orders.

I had been to two of the three restaurants on the tour but I had an opportunity to try things I would never have ordered, like the Fried Chicken Skins with Smoked Honey at Carson Kitchen.  I'm still dreaming about them!  
Wear comfortable shoes because other than when you are sitting down eating, you will be walking around downtown.

Not only was it not included, it was almost $5 for a cup of cold coffee.  At a restaurant of this caliber this is inexcusable to me.

3235422,2017-11-11,0,iBPyahdJRP5y0t25fF2W9w,"I will preface this review with two things - first is that I have done a lot of food tours all over the country so I would say my expectations are high.  Second is that I wish I could give a half star as this tour would likely get 4  1/2 stars.

We did the downtown food tour on a Friday night.  There were 10 people on the tour and our host was Ray.  This tour stood out as they provided a written list of all the places we were going to, and then a menu sheet at each location.  That is above and beyond in my opinion.

The tour focuses on Fremont East, which is an up and coming portion of downtown Las Vegas east of the Fremont Street experience.  All of the restaurants we went to were delicious small crafted bites.  Overall we had a wonderful time and it was well worth it.

So why only 4 stars?  The biggest reason was the stop at ""Inspire"" which was a beverage only (and mediocre at best beverage) on a very loud balcony of a working theater.  There was no food (it's a food tour right?) and it was so loud it was almost impossible to even hold a conversation.  This was followed by a tour of the container park where there were plenty of spots we could have sampled some independent food and enjoyed the park vs. the walk through.  

So all in all it was very enjoyable except for the one stop - so I had to ding a star for that one.",rSarkkY0J4YhUGf2EOHmuw,3,0,4,fzFnEC7oMeCWecUHnvWvbA

His attention to detail, his care and concern about everyone enjoying themselves and having the greatest experience and his KNOWLEDGE about the food and other cool stuff along the way...remember I want you to be surprised, is what made the dinner tour exceptional!

My boyfriend and I are huge foodies so we thought it would be perfect and this tour didn't disappoint! We left very happy (happy enough that I'm writing my first review EVER!) haha. 

During the walks our guide had little facts and bits of info on the structures and art installations around us. I must say that was a very nice touch considering it was my first time in Vegas. He also recommended other places to try other than the restaurants we were going to, I loved that too! 

Restaurant wise the other reviews I read were right, it's VIP service. You sit down almost immediately and the food comes out not too long after that. Our guides explained the food further than the little special menu we had and also gave some information about the restaurant itself. We got to try a lot of new things and they were so delicious.

We meet at Aria in front of the big waterfall at 2:15 and the rest is history.  This is by far the most well thought out and organized tour we have ever been on.  You can tell Ray, our guide, really is knowledgeable and takes pride in his job.  This was much more then just a foodie tour, it was also a sight seeing your and a history tour of Las Vegas rolled up in one.  Yes the food was wonderful, I wouldn't expect any less.  What I didn't expect was how much fun it would be to get to know everyone in our group and how fun it was that we all got to experience this tour with such a fun group of people.  We tried 16 courses from four different restaurants.  In the end of the tour we discovered that we were fuller after this tour then after the buffet we ate the day before.  We also added the drink package so there was a signature cocktail at each stop.  We will be back to Las Vegas to tryout the down town tour next visit.  If you ever expand the company to Los Angeles we will definitely book that tour too.  Happy eating!",jrfAvTdjH0ykHEtJsqTRRA,3,4,5,KWsDRelGqm2RoRZ1lhw6EA

Boozy Brunch
Tour Guide - Ray
Stops - 3 restaurants, all located within ARIA
Includes one alcoholic or non-alcoholic drink at each stop

Afternoon Culinary Adventures
Tour Guide - Whitney
Stops - 4 restaurants (in ARIA and the Cosmopolitan) plus 1 eyeglass ""museum""

Ray and Whitney were excellent tour guides!  They were friendly, knowledgeable, and had interesting stories to tell.  Both food tours were great, but I liked the format of the Afternoon tour a little bit more.

The tickets were kind of expensive, but I definitely thought they were worth it.  They gave us a lot of food (enough to cover two meals).  On the Brunch tour, one stop was an all you can grab buffet and on the Afternoon tour, one restaurant served us a full-sized bowl of ramen noodles.  

It was a great way to stay entertained for 2  1/2 hours.  Besides learning about the food, our tour guides also pointed out interesting art installations as we walked.  It was also cool because at each place we got to sit down right away and our food was served quickly since they were expecting us.

We dined at some of the higher end restaurants on the strip, were served 10+ amazing courses and on top of that received some really interesting information about some of the buildings and architecture on the strip.
Our stops on this trip were at Javier's, Milos, Momofuku and cucina. I honestly couldn't pick a favorite because each of them offered their own unique experience. In addition we stopped at a shop called retro specs which is honestly one of the coolest stores I have ever been to.

4690563,2016-09-12,0,iBPyahdJRP5y0t25fF2W9w,"We heard about this foodie tour from another friend who had done it earlier in the year and had raved about it on FB. Not believing his overzealous review, I looked up other reviews on Yelp and was amazed to find all 5 star reviews. After reading only a few of them, I knew I had to do this tour so I booked it right away, and convinced all our family members to book theirs as well. We (6 of us) did our foodie tour on Sept 8th, and by the end of it, all of us were so thrilled to have done it. 

The premise is simple - you meet up with these foodie ""guides"" who take you on a walking tour of 4 upscale restaurants that would otherwise require reservations days in advance. At each restaurant, you get to try 1-2 signature dishes and move on to the next one. 

If executed poorly, this type of experience can turn out to be underwhelming. But that is not the case here. Dan and Rolan conducted the whole tour with a level of perfection and attention to detail only seen when you pay big bucks for something. 

Prior to the tour, my main concern was that the portions will be small and we will walk away not full. I am happy to report that many of us were pretty full by the end of the second restaurant, overeating by the third, and beyond satiated by the end of the 4th restaurant. So my concern turned out to be false.

At each restaurant (I won't name the names so as to keep it a surprise), Dan and Rolan shared interesting tidbits about the artifacts there, or the decor, or any celebrity sightings and such. When we sat down for dinner, they answered questions about the restaurant, the owners, the chefs, and the food. They had all the right information to answer any questions without a second thought. This helped keep the group engaged and entertained. When the food came out, they explained a bit about the food, and actually served it on everyone's plate themselves. I thought that was a great personal touch. 

On the walk in between different restaurants, Dan and Rolan shared several interesting facts about Vegas and pointed out other places we should visit. We also got to hear a little about each of their background and how they leveraged their years of restaurant industry experience into this unique business. Kudos to them!

I can honestly say that all 6 of us thoroughly enjoyed our foodie tour and were not hungry until the following day. This was a unique experience through the eyes of 2 guys who are not only locals but also foodies themselves. We wish them the best of luck with their venture and hopefully they will continue to add more and more exclusive restaurants to the tour for when we book them the next time.

I normally hate bourbon but this was quite tasty. It's dimly lit even during the day. I'm not sure if I'd go back to try more but it was interesting. Now the 3rd stop is why this is 4 stars and not 5. No food just a cheap drink at the bar if this was at a nice place like Commonwealth and we got to get to the rooftop I wouldn't complain but I paid $165 for the upgraded alcohol to go with this tour so I feel like that was a waste. Now the last spot  7th and Carson was delicious and I need to go back to to fully enjoy because by the time we got there I was almost too full to really enjoy the food. I think this should be before the bar. I suggest Do a bar (just change the bar) at Do it at the end as a night cap to make this a 5 star experience.,fxrQSMhHlBv6eJVRdchG9Q,3,0,4,cS-euyx_AxDQQIEhkG0uPg

The Abra the tour guide was very knowledgeable about the sculptures and art work we stopped by. Well versed in her culinary knowledge as well. I was very amazed with the food. When the chefs came out and explained the foods I was even more impressed. Simple foods done amazingly from the ramen at Yusho, which serves authentic wasabi sauce to the chocolate desserts that were made from the chocolate factory inside the Hexx at the Paris hotel, and Bardot had the best sandwich I have ever had in my 28 years!  If you want to see Vegas from a very different point of view and taste some amazing food then definitely try this tour!

Our group consisted of 15 people. Everyone was super nice and very excited to be on this food tour together. Many people bonded instantly and by the end of the tour were exchanging numbers to stay in contact. 

The food was absolutely delicious! All the places we visited were top notch. As soon as you walk in, they treat you like royalty. At Javier's (inside the Aria), we sat at the same table that the celebrities sit at. We were told that to even sit at that long (20ft) table, you'd need to spend at least $4k on the tab. 

Enough food is brought out by the restaurants so that everyone can share. There was enough food for everyone to eat. You just have to pace yourself so that you are not full for the next stop. Be sure to opt in for the drinks as well, again, delicious!

We were the only three in the group that day, and instead of cancelling the tour, our guides happily guided us on what turned out to be a private tour.  Our guides were extremely attentive and knowledgeable about the casinos, restaurants and chefs.  While we savored Mexican, Greek and Spanish delights, I felt that each restaurant had been selected with care, and we were truly experiencing something special.   The tour was so much more than tasty eats at Javier's, Milos, Jaleo and China Poblano.  Our guides treated us to points of interest and art along our route, including a rather fascinating visit to a vintage eye glass emporium.  It is always a pleasure to sample food that is skillfully, lovingly and creatively prepared, at its peak of flavor and freshness, and that is exactly what we found on the Afternoon Food Tour.

Hosted this time by a young woman from Chicago rather than President Donald Contursi, neither her knowledge nor demeanor as conducive to the experience as she frequently complained about working too many straight days while attempting to name-drop ""Foodie"" credentials based on service jobs back home, it was immediately at  5:00pm that the tour began with the guide mocking guests trying to avoid falling drops, Matthew Harwell luckily coming to her rescue with a discussion of Carson Kitchen where first bites would be enjoyed.

Setting aside an expansive discussion of the Cuisine tasted at a Restaurant previously visited over a dozen times, the four Plates and a Cocktail fairly representative of Kerry Simon and Cory Harwell's approach to comfortable Foods dressed to impress, it was with several guests taking a pass on Veal Meatballs for 'ethical' reasons that those happy to partake finished up before making way to the exit, the Chicken Skins undoubtedly a highlight and Caviar a novelty for most which spoke volumes about the group's heterogeneity.

Walking a route intended to highlight several murals and spots of interest, The Laundry Room a previously unknown entity to someone unlikely to go out of their way for Cocktails alone, it was after a brief discussion of Fremont East that a party of eight entered Therapy., a spot whose business 'ethics' are a bit more questionable than the butchering of baby Cows sold based on their Travel Channel appearance, though the menu has apparently not changed much in the course of several head Chefs and remains highlighted by the decidedly delicious ""In the Gnudi.""

Led next through Park on Fremont, the fact the décor rather than dishes are focused upon probably all one needs to know before considering sitting down, it was from here that Fremont Street's Canopy was pointed out but oddly not explored, Inspire Theater instead the next Stop where guests are given a private tour of the 3rd Story Balcony and Tony's personal Box while enjoying the choice of either a Moscow Mule served in plastic or Wine offered the same.

Regretfully passing Naked City Pizza at The El Cortez and Bronze Café at The Market despite both buildings being pointed out, a walk through Container Park next compromised by false claims that the area contains ""good food"" with specific reference to The (long-ago-renamed) Perch, it was inside Liam Dwyer and Chef Gregg Fortunato's 7th & Carson that the Tour concluded, the signature Legs + Eggs faring better than prior and Gregg's Hearth Oven Bread a standout regardless of which topping is placed atop it while two Desserts not commonly featured as part of the tour but given as a ""VIP Bonus"" showed great signs of progress in the 7th's Pastry program...though it still wasn't quite enough to prevent the truly gluttonous from returning to Carson Kitchen for a nightcap and more sweet stuff.

FOUR STARS:  Featuring two less Restaurants than The Strip Tour and unfortunately marred by a guide ""not my usual chipper self"" Lipsmacking Foodie Tours Downtown Lip Smacking Tour nonetheless has a lot to offer those unfamiliar with the area along with several memorable bites, though rhetoric about places like Park on Fremont, Heart Attack Grill, Container Park dining and eat. should be saved in favor of praise for the spots featured or newer downtown additions like Naked City, Bomb Tacos or The Kitchen at Atomic.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,9,4,I1gq6AbDs9Ak8hLgk0dbjA

5703965,2016-07-18,0,iBPyahdJRP5y0t25fF2W9w,"TL;DR - go on the downtown Lip Smacking Foodie Tour...its worth every penny!

Recently for my birthday my boyfriend bought us tickets for the Lip Smacking Foodie Tour of downtown.  Going into the night we knew that we would be attending a few different restaurants and trying various items at each location.  We also knew that we would be starting at Carson's Kitchen.  Having eaten at Carson's Kitchen previously I was excited, but also skeptical that we would only be eating at restaurants that I had experienced before.  
We arrived at Carson's kitchen about 15 minutes before the start of our tour and met our guide Donald.  Donald was very personable and inviting, he asked about where we were from, we are LV locals, and how we found out about the tour.  We sat down at a table with two other women who were joining us for the tour.  We also sat down with one of the restaurant staff, Matthew, and he explained every dish we received.  We talked about the passion behind the food, the idea of the restaurant, and the man who was behind it.  Matthew talked extremely highly about the original owner/chef whom had recently passed away but they were doing everything to carry on his amazing vision.  We did not order the drink package so I ordered a Gin/cucumber drink that was amazing and my boyfriend ordered a spicy vodka drink that he enjoyed as well.  For dinner we received the Crispy Chicken Skins, ""Devil's"" Eggs, Roasted Young Beets, and Veal Meatballs, all of it was delicious.  Previously at Carson's Kitchen we had the roasted beets and they were a favorite of ours.  Our new favorite discovery was the crispy chicken skins.  This came with a honey sauce that was slightly smoky and absolutely amazing.  After talking in depth about each part of the food Matthew made sure to keep up very entertained and we can't wait to go back.
Our next stop was to Itsy Bitsy Ramen & Whiskey.  On our way over we learned more about the Carson hotel from both Matthew and Donald.  Donald also showed us the location of the Laundry Room, a secret speakeasy that can only be entered with reservations by texting a number that changes every few months.  At Itsy Bitsy we had a Snow Crab Hand Roll, Shrimp Pot Stickers, Japanese Sweet Corn, and the Chef's Ramen Selection (a Miso ramen with pork belly).  While I thought all the food was good, especially the Japanese sweet corn (to die for!), I do not think I would have ordered these foods myself.  I think when my boyfriend and I go back to Itsy Bitsy we would order a different set of items.
After leaving Itsy Bitsy we went to Inspire to take a break from food and have a drink.  I thought that it was just going to be sitting on the roof of Inspire and having a drink but it was so much more.  Donald had a staff member give us a tour of the whole place, which was one of the best parts of the foodie tour.  We learned about the theatre they have there, that they use to have a book maker on staff but had to get rid of them due to lack of interest.  We also learned about a members only club, Tokyo 365.  This was awesome because we got to see inside the club (only 10 seats and one staff member) and talk to the bartender.  Their tag line is that they make artisanal ice, yup, and while we didn't get to see the bartender at work I asked what the hardest shape anyone had ever asked for was and he said he had to make a skull once and I was pretty impressed.  
Our last stop was at Glutton where we had Ahi Tuna Tacos, Braised Pork Flatbread, Wood Roasted Cauliflower, Pickled Tomatoes, Caramel Corn Profiteroles, and Peach Cobbler.  Everything at Glutton was delicious, especially the signature cocktail that was a kind of mango piña colada.  When we return to Glutton I would order the pickled tomatoes and roasted cauliflower with some new additions from the menu.  After our dinner the chef came out and talked with us, you could tell he was nervous at first but after asking him about his menu you could see how fired up he got talking about all his favorite menu items and about how when he tried to change the menu a group of old ladies threatened to never come back because they thought the cauliflower was so good, we agree!!
Overall this was an amazing birthday present and amazing night.  Donald did a great job showing us parts of downtown that we have walked by so often not knowing they were right in front of us as well as treating us to a great meal.  I can't wait to try the strip lunch and strip dinner tours.  I hope in the future they expand the downtown tour to more restaurants so we can try some more!

I'm totally not suggesting that you show up late, but it's not the complete end of the world. For real, you don't want to miss any part of this tour- like other reviewers have said, Donald gives more than just a foodie tour, he also gives all sorts of other interesting/fun facts throughout. We especially liked that he gave us all sorts of tips on dining (what's good, who has the best deals, etc.) and on special things to try in Vegas (don't miss the Verbena drink at Chandelier Bar in the Cosmopolitan) that we wouldn't have known otherwise. As for the food tour, we went to 4 different places with diverse menus. I thought we would be getting one dish from each place, but, no, we got several signature dishes to share at each place. So, my recommendation is don't eat too much at any one place! I know it might be hard but just don't do it. I found that we got an abundance of food and had to even take some home. However, I think it all depends on everyone's eating capacity. We were in a group with all ladies apart from my husband so there's was plenty, but I can imagine if you're in a group with a bunch of guys, you might get a little left behind. Anyway, all in all, this was a great experience- we got to tour a bunch of places that we probably wouldn't have done otherwise and got to try some spectacular dishes (as well as some interesting dishes that I never would have ordered otherwise, both good and not so good).",FemnSR5DlIU4TnztXt6ZYw,0,1,5,7NHdFUVJW7HQMrXfJj-mwQ

The tour guide Abra was awesome! Can't wait to try the Downtown tour next!,YVnQxnDboUSwFza_o_eFeQ,0,0,5,iFQvZ857FGX3IPzMGoOw6Q
