The spicy (which means seasoned, not hot) catfish is the way to go. Add your own Tabasco to bring up the heat.  Lovely filets crusted in a corn meal/flour mix fried to perfection.  The corn nuggets, battered fried green beans with ranch dressing, mac n cheese balls and the hush puppies are the top side dishes.  They even have Dr. Pepper (but not in the fountain, so be sure to ask) and sweet tea.  The owner and his staff are absolutely the nicest people.

As soon as I walk-in, there is a big sign saying # 1 rated. With this is in mind, I am already expecting something epic. We literally ordered everything on the menu; fried catfish, fried chicken, hush puppies, greens, biscuits, beans, etc).

Whoops I was wrong!

The Breakdown:

Food: 2 Stars - nothing spectacular here, seemed like it was all frozen food picked up from Costco that was bought in bulk thrown into a deep fryer.
Service: 5 stars- Great service, cashier and cook were polite and fast.

Overall: I really wanted to like this place food wise, I thought I had a winner on my hands that I could add to my stop bys when in the area, but unfortunately the food just didn't live up to it.",2tN5CPvfJq1Xzv-fd7e34w,0,0,2,PEbcF-oTJdJqY4rVxwZM_w

Been eating soul food all over this crazy town for over 10 years and this place is too legit.

Ill take a 2 piece spicy catfish w/corn on the cob and baked potato.
Side of corn nuggets to split if im with company.

767328,2011-08-11,0,gpflXHwzORmGqJNgkKtkEA,"I live about two blocks away from this place on Silverado Ranch and I have been there so often that they know me personally. My Grandmother had mentioned this place to me when they were located on Flamingo, but they had since moved and she always wanted to know where they went. Boy was she delighted to learn that they had moved to my neighborhood.

Atmosphere:
The diner is small and cozy. You recieve a lot of personal attention. Not fancy by any means, but it doesn't need to be. Service is always quick, but if you are picking up something to go, I would suggest calling the order in ahead of time. Also, as awesome as the food is, this place is rarely crowded. The owners work in the restaurant and are always extremely friendly. They also hired some new staff recently who are also very polite.

Food:
Delicious. The Catfish is the best I've ever had. There isn't much of a difference between the regular and the spicy. However, I am not a fan of spicy food, so I order the spicy because it has a nice flavor to it, without being overpowering. Their baked beans do taste like pork and beans, but their potato salad, macaroni, and greens are very good. The complimentary hush puppies are also a really nice compliment to the meal. My grandmother turned me on to the fried green beans, and now I cannot make a stop there without buying them. They are so delicious.

Price: Catfish Alley is somewhat expensive. But if you can afford it, it's definitely worth it. I usually just bite the bullet and buy the 8pc Catfish Dinner with two sides, and fried green beans, which is around $27 bucks total. It's pricey, but you get what you pay for.",S7CyfJQlPYb-vYtqPDPG-w,0,0,5,xfjWNYuFeglimP2JhC60nA

Before my drive by last week, never seen or heard of the place.  basically, southern style food - catfish ( really ? ) fried chicken, fried shrimp, hot links ( they were out of the links ...damn ! ), fried oysters.  sides included okra, slaw, p. salad, fried green beans, corn nuggets, baked beans, etc

i ordered the 3 pc catfish w/ fries.  a side of potato salad. ordered some fried mac n cheese bites.  I asked if they had fried diet coke ( get it ?  she didn't ! )

wound up making 3 more stops before i made it home to try the fish.
it was kinda funny - they included cole slaw in a bag ( if i knew that, i would've skipped the p. salad ( i was told it was homemade - coulda fooled me ! ) the fish - top notch !  light, crispy, moist ...coulda used some more tartar sauce ( not a biggie since i'm leaving the other 2 pcs for my girl and she doesn't like tartar sauce ), fries dull, slaw - mushy - most likely due to the delay in getting home with it ( i'll give them the benefit of the doubt )

the m&c bites - after 2 ...nope - no good - might like it better as bar food after a couple beers - maybe.

total cost $14 ...the catfish is tasty - the place is called catfish alley - stick to the catfish !!",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,2,2,3,N1991WIVVGXLkCUBauifHA
1543818,2011-03-11,0,gpflXHwzORmGqJNgkKtkEA,"Ate there last night and it can best be summed up with.. OMG, that's GOOD!

Hubby got the spicy catfish and loved their homemade hot sauce on it, said the two went together well.  His sides were the cole slaw (yummy) and the baked beans (meh).  I got the regular catfish and my two sides were the greens (nom) and the fried okra (nom!).  We each ordered the two piece dinner and we each got 3 pieces.. even after I commented, when ordering, that I could only eat one piece so hubby should order one less than he wants 'cause he was getting my extra one.  So.. I ate 1 piece, hubby ate 4, one too many.  Breading was nicely spiced on each, the catfish was fantastic.

Hubby was curious about their appetizers so I told him to go ahead and order 1.. he ordered two, and there were huge quantities of both.  The mac & cheese balls (fried) and the sweet corn balls (fried).  Let me say this, with the fried catfish and fried okra, I was thinking that more fried foods would put me into a coma... but they were both fantastic!  Breading on both was very minimal, and they were incredibly good.  The sweet corn balls had extra honey in them, they should be classified as a dessert.

Only drawbacks.. baked beans were boring, not much flavor difference from a can of pork & beans from the grocery shelf.  Then there was their tartar sauce.. it was homemade and very good, but you get a very tiny quantity of it served with the order, making a request for more tartar sauce obligatory.

When we were leaving, after bemoaning the fact that they're such a long drive from our house, we got informed that they're opening up another location this summer near our house.. I'd have hugged the guy for that info if I wasn't already slipping into my fried-food coma.  Look for them opening sometime this summer at the NW corner of Craig & Decatur! :D",wOpzh1RYcz-SLu55NEaaBg,1,0,4,dWijJtd3Wq6KCFJwGkGlDg

We had wings, so delicious so crispy and not oily. Fried catfish, everyone seems to hit it on the spot. not overly coated with corn meal, cooked up light and crunch, moist on the inside. the sides were good fried okra being the highlight but the other sides i had was average. It's good but it's average. 
The star of the meal, chicken fried steak. This is getting the title, Best I've ever ate! This is one dish i try everywhere i get a chance and it's head and shoulders above everyone else. I don't even know how to describe the crust. It's soft but yet it's flaky, crunchy, crispy.. how can i describe it? I really don't know but what i do know it's the best I've ever had. 
The only thing i didn't like, Where is the dam kool-aid? We had a talk with the boss and we've come to an agreement. next time I'm in there i better get my kool-aid.

They know how to run a business.

I have been a fan ever since they were at the old spot on Flamingo and Eastern.

Know why they have been running great for 4 years?:

Unlike a lot of black businesses, they cater and are friendly to ALL people, as if they were all family, and dont maintain an intimidating ambience about their business.

They dont go to the same area of town as the others (Westside/NLV) going to the a-typical areas of town for black businesses shows they know how to market themselves.


The catfish is seasoned just right,i literally could eat it all day (Miss the Ayce from the old spot though.lol)

I was impressed to see a Best Of Vegas's Seafood Restaurant 2010 award on their wall.

We ordered the 4 pieces + 2 sides and it was the right amount of food for two people.  The catfish pieces were a good size, the breading was flavorful and not too greasy.

I also really enjoyed the hush puppies, and I'm not usually a fan of them.  The sweet potato fries were a little less sweet than other restaurants, and after some contemplation I've decided I like them a little sweeter.  Next time I'm definitely trying the fried okra and fried green beans.

I will definitely be back. There is a plethora of items on their menu I want to try. Specifically, I'd like to try their gumbo and a couple of their other side dishes.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,2,4,4xyzpkF8j368F_yQODnJCA

4936855,2011-02-19,3,gpflXHwzORmGqJNgkKtkEA,"Ive only been here once but I'd been dying to go for weeks. One night we set out to go only to find out our GPS guided us to the Flamingo location which is now closed. ... thanks Garmin.
We called and confirmed yup. closed. the only location in town is on Bermuda/Silverado Ranch - not just ""silverado"" as yelp has it listed. 

FOOD: I went w/ the spicy catfish 2 piece - with 2 sides - I went with coleslaw and sweet potato fries. the whole plate was freakin delish. NOTE: the spicy catfish is not spicy at all. not even a hint of spice. not even a dash of spice. or a hue of a dash of a hint of spice. So feel free to order spicy or non spicy and it will be the same. BUT DELICIOUS it was.. gotta say that was damn good. It was exactly as I imagined it tasting. wonderful. perfectly breaded. 2 (kinda small) hushpuppies. swee Potato fries were on point. They also came with their own in house made tartar sauce (which i dont eat b/c i dont eat onions) and their own homemade hot sauce. I poured every drip of that on my food and added Hot sauce b/c it was so good. 

SERVICE: it was great. kinda empty in there @ the time b/c I think it was early like 630p on a saturday night. (yeah im old I needed to eat early) give me that blue plate special! j/k
The staff checked on us several times and she gave me 3 pieces instead of 2. and gave my bf 4 instead of 3. Kinda pricey for the amt of food you get - $25.00 for a 2 and 3 piece.. eh... I'd go back but when my wallet and most importantly my calories allow for it..",cafRiSVWRXlxDEK2YNrJ6g,5,0,4,y4hufvvGEwZx0RLUSg9v1g
4974429,2008-07-11,5,gpflXHwzORmGqJNgkKtkEA,"Rachel M. mentioned she heard some great things about Catfish Alley, so we had to check it out for ourselves.

This 2 year old casual restaurant is immaculate.  That's the first thing we noticed is how clean and orderly everything looked.

We stood at the counter for awhile as we decided what to order.  The guy working the register was friendly and super helpful.  He suggested we go for the ""4 Pc. Fish Dinner with 2 Sides"" ($10.99), so we did.  Our choice of sides were okra and greens.  (Other sides include french fries, cole slaw, baked beans, and potato salad.)  We were also intrigued by the Mac & Cheese Bites for $3.75.

We chose a booth to sit at as we waited for our order.  It was soon to arrive and we dug right in.  The catfish had a great coating that had lots of flavor and stayed crispy, keeping the fish moist inside.  It wasn't greasy at all, just like B.K. said.  The hush puppies that came with it too were pretty good as well.  I was really impressed with the Mac & Cheese Bites though.  It was the first time I had these and they were such a nice treat.  (I'm sure every kid would love these deep-fried macaroni and cheese goodies!)

We were also lucky to try out their Fried Green Beans and Corn Nuggets.  The deep-fried string beans were tasty too, with a good crunch.  The Big F loved the Corn Nuggets though.  It's like cream of corn that's been deep-fried, almost like a dessert.  

The Big F was craving for more fish, so he ordered another two!  ($2/each extra pc. fish)

I would recommend eating in because things always taste better right when they come out of the fryer!

They do serve individual size bottles of wine if you're feeling fancy!

Sidenote:  The ladies' restroom only had hot water in there...and I do mean scalding hot water.  Not sure if it's been fixed or not, but watch out!

(You know I got pictures of our Southern grub!  Check them out!)",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,7,5,4,8gyHPv3Pn90lvBLGtbklyw
5091776,2009-04-20,1,gpflXHwzORmGqJNgkKtkEA,"I have been coming here ever since they opened and they absolutely have the most amazing fried catfish (west) of the mississippi. I don't know how they do it, but the fish always- and I mean ALWAYS- comes piping hot, perfectly crisp outside, perfectly moist inside and DRY- without a hint of grease. Amazing. It's as if they were baked! I don't recommend ""taking out"" as it's best to have them straight from their fryer to your table. Nice sides to try are their fried mac and cheese bites (have them hot), fried okra, collard greens, and my favorite, their fried green beans. They serve the perfect hot sauce to accompany (Frank's) and a tartar sauce that I never consume because I love their hot sauce. Order the fish ""spicy"" which isn't hot but rather, ""spiced"" with Cajun seasonings. I also like to order an 18-pc. (catfish only) to take home and make fish tacos with. The orders always come with hush puppies that are delicious hot too (though I'm not really a fan). The staff are always welcoming and pleasant and the place is very clean- a favorite of the lunchtime crowd. They also have 2 flat screens on the walls and drink fountains. If you're looking for catfish done amazing, this is the place in Vegas to head to.",lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ,1,1,5,gDwIbc9l3CawsBpjdH6vgQ
5205161,2010-10-15,1,gpflXHwzORmGqJNgkKtkEA,"I'm not 100% on the catfish... maybe because I'm not the biggest catfish fan, but the sides are absolutely amazing (except the store bought fries).  

The first time I tried this place I got the lunch special w/sides ... I was so impressed with the black eyed peas that I went back and ordered more. 

Seriously go here for the sides. The greens are amazing. When we bar-b-que at home we will go here and order a bunch of large sides to go with our dinner.",l6WUAAIsnX6DJIxyRNCfcA,1,1,4,H05t410STUGbST-ij3WrIQ

We started off with the sampler which came with 3 pieces of catfish, 2 pieces of shrimp and chicken fingers which we inhaled in about 10 minutes.  Ended up ordering another helping of fingers and catfish along with a pitcher of beer and we were in fried food heaven.  

I did wish the ""spicy"" catfish was actually spicy but that's a very minor thing.  My wife actually liked the chicken more than the fish.  Staff was fantastic.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,3,2,4,YyYK4JCgDy8wVhi0t_ZN4Q

The catfish tasted fresh as it can get, the hush puppy sides were flavorful (unlike the ones you get from chains like Long John Silvers).  

Maybe the few people that complained were at a different place in the neighborhood that serves catfish, because chewy, rubbery  'jerky' style is exactly what the competitors have.

I have a feeling that the collard greens and black eyed peas were from a can, but  I may be wrong on that.  They tasted good, but not like they were freshly picked.",T2y6TokoIIhXniks0ifCTA,0,0,4,qID2tp4Yy7lTUX-_c-47Eg
