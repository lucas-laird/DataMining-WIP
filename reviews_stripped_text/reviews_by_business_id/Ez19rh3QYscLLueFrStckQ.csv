He was working so fast that even us NYers were amazed. We soon realized that Elijah was the only one working other than the cook.

The service is always mediocre at this location, but I try to brush it off because it's located in a busy shopping center. However, yesterday I had my final straw. It took the cashier forever to take my order and she was rude over the speaker. I had to correct my order at the window because she misheard me. Although it was corrected on my receipt, she still gave me the wrong order and hurriedly pushed the bag into me arms and slammed the window shut on me. Bad service is always remembered and I won't ever come to this location again. Do yourself a favor and go to the one on Sunset instead.

My son wanted the $4 real deal, while my husband was going to get a famous star and a western bacon cheeseburger with the mix and match for $6. 

What happened next was terrible customer service! Debbie, the supervisor, told my husband that we had to take our food to go because they were closed. Then when he placed the order for my son and ordered his, she proceeded to tell him that he could only have two western bacon cheeseburgers. My husband then said, nevermind, just give us his food. He then went out to check the advertisement and it clearly said mix and match. I then told her that as a supervisor she should know what is advertised. 

She then reminded us that we were getting this to go.

When we got to the window they were very concerned to what exactly made it hot for my husband and even offered to change the cheese for him to. On top of that they gave us two of the homemade biscuts and jelly they have now for free.

2388868,2017-09-29,0,Ez19rh3QYscLLueFrStckQ,"I was trying to write a review for my lunch but i had to keep stopping to go take a crap. I just had to try the $5 meal deal box. My fat ass had a double cheeseburger with the chicken sandwich, fries, soda and cookie. Not surprisingly, It tasted like a $5 meal too. Chicken sandwich was like a white sponge with breading. Like fried lunchmeat. Chicken tasted like  styrofoam but it went well with the globs of mayo. After i tackled that processed chicken, i ate some fries that were scattered throughout the box in no particular order. Good thing they werent in a bag or cardboard cup because that would make it presentable and we aint got time for that. So i go to unwrap my double cheeseburger and a tired ass looking burger pops out. Looked and tasted like they made it 6 hours ago hangin out under the heat lamp. Tasted like a double hockey puck sandwich. I think the best part of it was the ketchup. Next time i wanna play frisbee ill just stop at Carls and pull the burger out of the bun. The cookie was good. The soda was good...all 4 oz's. It was like 80% ice and 20% soda. I was actually impressed how one could get so much ice in a 12oz cup. 

So anyway, in short, you get what you pay for.

I gave it another shot, going in and ordering my Western Bacon Cheeseburger. It was much much better. The bacon was crispy, my burger was hot, fresh and juicy. The cheese was melted and my onion ring was fresh out of the fryer. I will be back. I have added a star. 
I ordered the Western Bacon Cheeseburger and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. For the same price I could have gone next door to Farmers Bros and gotten a much better quality sandwich. 
My sandwich was borderline cold and had stale bacon from the breakfast shift.
The customer service was good and they greeted me with a smile. 
It is also a very clean restaurant. It's not enough to keep me from giving them another shot....",gCiyPyXnwTNpmee9krJfxQ,0,0,4,jUOfgjtU--E64GKHuu9tNA

I have reported this to the state health board, and a few others. 

DO NOT EAT HERE! I wish I could dump all the crap onto this location. They have not only caused me pain, mental frustration. But time and money from my work. I'm super pissed. I'm glad I finally have some brain power to write this.

4103820,2012-06-22,6,Ez19rh3QYscLLueFrStckQ,"My visit -- and this story -- start on May 4, 2012. I was shopping for an elderly home-bound neighbor and she asked me to stop at Carl's Jr. to get her a hamburger. Nothing special here; Stopped at the Carl's Jr. and ordered her burger. Paid. Got the food. It wasn't until I asked for the receipt that things got weird. The cashier told me that receipts are only issued on request and it would be a minimum of 5 minutes if I wanted to wait for it. I asked why so long and he said ""That's how long it takes to generate a receipt"". 

I am not about to wait 5 minutes for the receipt as the food gets cold. It the order were mine I would have demanded a refund and let them throw the burger in the trash. However, I do feel it necessary to provide a receipt when spending my neighbors money. I left without the receipt and noticed a sticker-sign on the door. Call this number if you have any questions or problems. I called from the parking lot and was connected to the voice mail of someone named Sandra. I left a message explaining what had happened, providing my name and cell number, and asked that I be contacted with information on Carl's receipt policy.

Alas, that is all background information, as the true reason for this review is to document how poor the customer service is and just how unimportant a paying customer is to Carl's Jr. Restaurants. Here is what happened since then:

Using the Carl's website I sent an email through the ""Contact Us"" link. The site specified that a reply could take up to 5 days, a time-frame that seems excessive, but at least they were upfront about the slow reply rate. Maybe they had only a couple people to sift through all of the emails. More likely there were more complaints than any number of people could handle. I regret I can not post my original email, but it was sent from their site, not my email carrier. Alas, I have no access to it. You will have to trust is was much like my phone message requesting a copy of their receipt policy -- let the 5 day clock begin.

 -------------------------  On  day 3 I received the following email:

Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us.
We do not have any further information for you at this time.  However, I have forwarded your message to the appropriate department for their review and requested that they follow-up on your comments.
Please feel free to contact us again at any time.

 -------------------------  On  day 6 I sent the following email:

To whom it may concern:

On Friday, May 4th, I sent an email through the ""contact us"" link of your web site. 3 days later I received this auto responder saying that ""We do not have any further information for you at this time"", and I have yet to be informed that there *is* additional information.

My simple request of informing me of your receipt policy was sparked by an oddity on my last visit to Carl's. It is now obvious that the reason neither I, nor other patrons, were given receipts was that the transactions were not rung into the register. Be advised that I no longer need that policy, the reason for which is described below.

* The response time from your web site is long, and in my opinion, unacceptable. *To date, I have yet to hear back from anyone.*
* In addition to sending that email I called the telephone number posted on the door and left a voice mail. *To date, I have yet to hear back from anyone.*
* A simple request like the one I had originally made should have been handled in under 24 hours.
* It is now apparent that customers are a terrible inconvenience to you, therefor, I shall make your jobs easier by cancelling the request for the information and no longer being a customer. The service I have received is equal to that in the restaurant(s). Slow. I shall not bother returning.

 -------------------------  On  day 7 I received the following emails:

Thank you for taking the time to contact us.

I assure you that every effort is being made to address this situation.  I have escalated the report concerning your initial comments and these additional comments.  I have contacted the appropriate management regarding your experience at this particular restaurant as well as forwarded your comments to our corporate representatives.

Thank you for giving us the opportunity to address your concerns.  If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to call (877) 799-7827.

-------------------------  And:

My name is Sandra Bacon and I am the District Manager for the store that you vistited (visited) last week. I'm sorry that you did not get my response. It is much easier to have a phone number to call than rely on email. I would like to personally talk to you regarding the reciept (i before e EXCEPT after c) issue. If you would please call me on my cell at 702-561-2101.

Thank you,

4655158,2016-07-02,8,Ez19rh3QYscLLueFrStckQ,"After working all day and running errands, I was hungry and needed a fast meal to satisfy my hunger. Carl's Jr., hit the spot. 

  It's hard to believe that the last time I ate in a Carl's Jr. was over six years ago at the Tropicana at Sandhill location before I jumped on the Yelp train. Over six years later the Western cheeseburger tastes just as yummy as it did before 2011. In my opinion  this is Carl Jr's signature sandwich. The beef topped with cheese, barbecue sauce, and onion rings gives some of these so-called burger full-service restaurants a run for their money. 

  Carl's Jr. also gives some full-service restaurants a run for their money in customer service. Immediately upon walking inside, the man at the counter greeted me and was patient as I decided what I wanted. After ordering the western cheeseburger combo, I brought my food to the Coke machine, filled my drink, and sauntered to the table with my number. I had brought along a bag of groceries because I wanted to get exercise instead of constant driving. However, the manager noticed at the Coke machine that the bag was ripping and volunteered to bring me a new bag. I'd take Carl's Jr., up on the offer. Another offer I'd take up was the delicious Fanta strawberry soda that is one of the Coke fountain beverages. It was a compliment to the Western cheeseburger and fries medium sized. 

   My bill for the medium sized Western cheeseburger meal with a Coke beverage and fries came to $8.41. This is one of the least expensive items on the Carl's Jr., menu. As far as spending $8.41 on a meal, this is not the best deal. From my experience the Chinese lunch specials, Hawaiin blue plate specials, and some sub restaurants are the best deal. But tell that to me after a day of work and errands. 

   As I write this on the weekend of America's Birthday, it is the year of Carl Jr's 75th Birthday. They must be doing something right to make it to their 75th Anniversary. Their Western cheeseburger is one of the things that Carl Jr., does right.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,15,12,3,XiM-5z209SyakU3q-8AWZA

5672225,2012-03-27,0,Ez19rh3QYscLLueFrStckQ,"Hitting up Carl's Jr for a quick bite before it got too late, the wife and I were made to wait at the counter for a couple minutes before we were helped. This is because they had one employee in the kitchen and one working both the front counter and drive through. He missed seeing us come in as he was busy helping the drive through customers. Not his fault the managers don't staff the restaurant properly.

Finally, the kitchen worker lady let the cashier guy know we were waiting. He took our order promptly and efficiently. We went to the drink machine to get our thirsts quenched and hit another snag. Their machine was diluting everything. The mix was off by quite a bit. All of the sodas we tried were way lighter in color and tasted more like lightly flavored soda water than soda. We tried the: DrPepper, Coke, Sprite, Root Beer & Raspberry Iced Tea. Letting the guy know the machine seemed off, he said he would look into it. He messed with some of the syrup in the back, then sampled the sodas out front and let us know it should be fixed. It isn't his fault that they don't train him on re-calibrating the soda machine, as the drinks still tasted weak and funny after his attempts to fix the issue.

Shortly thereafter, he brought out our food and checked on us a couple times throughout to make sure we had everything we needed. That's one touch I really like about Carl's Jr!

My Super Star with cheese was delicious, it didn't fall apart like some of them do. The bun was not stale or weak either. The fries are some of the best frozen, fast food fries I have had in a while.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,3,yLnsUaewf1lw5HRH8GnoeA
