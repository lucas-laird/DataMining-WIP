I ordered a 3 item combo, the egg flower soup, egg rolls, and pot stickers. The sautéed veggies were extremely salty to where I could only eat a couple of bites. The spicy chicken was pretty much a bunch of jalapeños with only a few tiny pieces of chicken. The orange chicken was decent, but definitely not great. The chow mein was blah. The egg flower soup had a weird taste to it. The pot stickers and egg rolls were just okay. I don't think I'll be ordering from here again as I have a lot better Chinese options in the area.",t7BOWGGC8HNxEl0HaFeK5A,1,0,2,-euiWRaZzibdUsJyyknrcw

1942087,2017-08-12,6,osngclad-cS05yDq9CXPOA,"I've been craving Chinese takeout for weeks. When I saw that Spicy Mama had opened, I headed on over. Though it's set up similar to Panda Express (cafeteria style bowls and plates) with pre-made food on display, they made two of the three entrees I tried fresh to order. 

Salt and pepper shrimp were freshly-fried with 6 to an order, served with peppers and onions but not quite as salty or peppery as I prefer. The beef and broccoli was solid, with tender meat and broccoli that was cooked just right- not soggy and drowned in sauce, as elsewhere. The Chinese Ribs aren't my thing, but my dining companion really enjoyed them and the light honey-based sauce kept this from being too heavy. I prefered their fried rice to the noodle, which could have used more veggies. Feel like an eggroll should be included in the plate combo. 

They advertise combos available starting at $5 for a single-entree bowl, up to $8 for a three-entree plate. Note that several entree options have (reasonable) add-on fees. Majority of business is takeout or delivery, small and clean dining area available.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,16,9,4,Yl9APd3MvuhNl8jxwFcQ8A
2059623,2017-11-12,0,osngclad-cS05yDq9CXPOA,The food here is very very bland . There's not much flavor to it . We ordered a family meal and the portions were really small and I wouldn't say it was worth the price . I was excited to try it because it's close by and the reviews were okay but after trying it I was really disappointed. If there would have been more flavor I wouldn't have cared for portion size or price but for what I got and for how much I paid with the taste that it had . Yeah definitely not worth it and won't be ordering from here again . The only credit I do give is that their egg rolls were really good but that's as good as it gets.,3xmsld7B7blgGr4MGh0oiQ,0,0,1,kQ5pHvlEmlTQDWY1FWQX0Q

I sat and waited for my Kung Pao shrimp for about 5 minutes. The shrimp were small and not very plentiful. I also had an egg roll and crab rangoons. They were ok. Adequate. Good.

2303981,2017-08-06,5,osngclad-cS05yDq9CXPOA,"So was getting my smog check for my car. I notice Spicy Mama. I never been before so figure why not give it try for lunch. When you walk in the door it throws you off. It tiny place not really dine in place because there very limited amount of tables think only three in all. It more take out. Honest it set up just like Panda Express or other Chinese spots find in shopping malls. They have all the different selection in steam tables all ready to go. You pick bowl, one or two entree plates, and really the concept the same. One thing must admit that makes Spicy Mama stand out from fast food Chinese versions. They also have different specials look on the walls daily. You could get whole fish fried. Sure you have your typical choices from fried rice, chow mein, orange chicken, and on. The thing I found is the food more authentic, lot more vegetables in certain dishes, and other things like the sesame pork ribs (winnah). The prices are about the same. Spicy Mama they are very generous with the portion. It not like other places you get two entree combo and the to go container closes nicely. My order it was full full. 

The service was great! She was friendly, explained everything being my first time, and really nice. If in the area looking for Chinese to go that inexpensive, nice portion, and solid Spicy Mama is a great choice. I will be stopping by again.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,7,7,4,6H3zuGpSpjLWU3COfqmV4Q

2592280,2017-09-27,1,osngclad-cS05yDq9CXPOA,"Im glad I stumbled upon this kind of hidden establishment. It's located in the plaza but ALL the way to the end. Although it is in the back, it's worth it.

First off, you are allowed to sample anything you want. What's that you say, free samples? Yes, free samples.
That isn't even the best part, catch this; the food is made to order. Amen, right?! Nothing is better than having your food freshly made (maybe besides it tasting good). With the menu's variety ranging from spicy to sweet, you have plenty to choose from. If you're a Yoshinoya fan, they also serve a Yoshinoya-like style meat. Portions are huge and the food, is pretty good! The only thing that I didn't care for was the excess of sauce in my kung pao beef because it was too much and spilled over to the other items.

As soon as I stepped into the doors, I instantly become a recipient of AMAZING service and attitudes from the employees. The woman who rang us up was quite the conversationalist and was so kind. She was definitely working in a manner that showed she wanted to keep this new restaurant open as long as possible.

You can either order al a carte or by plate; $5 for one entrée and side, $7 for 2 entrees and a side, and $9 for 3 entrees and a side. They also sell sodas,water, juices, lollipops, pocky and other snacks/sweets.

I added crab Rangoon as well. When I got home I started with the Rangoon which was very lightly filled but fried nicely. The orange chicken and rice were okay but The generals chicken and noodles were inedible. The noodles were incredibly oily tasting and gummy. I have never tasted generals chicken like this and the flavor almost made me think it might be bad since it wasn't that hot either. So I immediately stopped eating it. I pray I don't get sick.

3826090,2018-03-26,0,osngclad-cS05yDq9CXPOA,"I came upon this place while passing by on my way to Quest Diagnostics. Mind you I was fasting and I was craving Chinese food the night before so I HAD to try this place out afterwards. 

The woman was setting up while I walked in so the restaurant must've just opened for the day. She gave me a menu and asked what I would like, I wasn't sure yet so she gave me a few mins. 

There's about 2 tables that could seat four and 1 that could seat 2. It has the set up like Panda Express where the food is shown in front of you for you to choose but the food is also made to order. Everything looked delicious and I couldn't wait to say.

It's a small establishment but it got busy real quick once I got in. Within 20 mins at least 5 people walked in after me. The woman who walked in after me actually said she's been here a couple times and really enjoy the food. So that got me excited even more to try this place out! 

Food was really yummy. The spareribs will have to be my favorite here. It's sweet, sour and tender and to me that makes really great ribs. The noodles here are chow mein noodles with some type of sweet sauce on it. It's not bad but if you eat from this place a lot you may get tired of the sweetness. Fried rice here is really good, pretty comparable to Panda Express or China a Go Go. One of the workers here made some shrimp soup and she gave me and a couple customers here a taste. It was really good with a subtle flavor, not too overwhelming. I'm not sure if this is on their menu or not now.


The price point is also comparable to Panda Express with more of a selection. Try this place out if you're in the neighborhood. You may just enjoy it like I did.",IVhd52S1wRToLVNPFQaipA,0,0,4,jgfrMjmfscWOB5cnijzzzg

The girl was very welcoming to the restaurant, she gave us options on how to choose the food, & showed prices, gave us a menu to take home. She even told us that the food was fresh made. We got some orange chicken, chow mein, veggie rolls, steamed rice, and yoshinoya. & may I say, everything was excellent! The orange chicken wasn't too sweet, & it was perfect! The chow mein was not oily at all, a bit more on the watery side, & I think that's definitely much better for my choice of how noodles should be. Steamed rice was great! The veggie rolls with the sweet and sour were also great too, & the yoshinoya the meat was so soft, I crave it so much. Definitely will be coming back again!

5446803,2017-09-30,0,osngclad-cS05yDq9CXPOA,"My husband and I have been craving and searching for a good Chinese food place to get food from and  I came across Spicy Mama on Yelp and was impressed by some of the reviews so I decided to order for delivery. The food took about an hour to arrive which I think is expected. When we opened up the styrofoam containers we were pleasantly surprised by the amount of food that was put in it (there was a lot) which was of course a plus for us. I ordered the ""happy meal"" which came with 1 entree and 3 sides and I chose half fried rice and half chow mein with the shrimp, beef and broccoli and orange chicken as my sides. The chow mein was not what I expected, the chow mein I got was more on the orange colored side and didn't taste like the chow mein I am used to but it was decent tasting. The fried rice was good, but I wish there was a little bit more of it in my food. The shrimp was probably my favorite because it was very flavorful and the size of the shrimp were big. The orange chicken was good but it was a bit on the soggy side which I didn't care much for and the beef and broccoli was probably my least favorite which was disappointing for me since I love beef and broccoli (not much flavor and the sauce was more of a jelly texture). Overall the food was good, the price was great and the amount of food you get is awesome. This isn't my favorite Chinese food place but I can say I will order from here again (probably not the beef and broccoli or chow mein but I will definitely be getting the shrimp!)",rQQ3rOei4WyEimG0KHeipA,0,0,4,4yymaiybLChUZdga7HR_6A

The orange chicken is the best I've had in the city (haven't had PPP's yet though), the crab Rangoon are hand rolled and BOMB, chow mein too, teriyaki chicken was my surprise today...came packed on a bed of perfectly cooked cabbage and broccoli. 

If it's just two people, a small side of chow mein or rice, and a small entree to-go are enough. That's $10 for two and it's FINALLY Chinese food that has that little extra something that makes it memorable.",sWw_7DMkypnT7M6Y1tQy1g,0,1,5,9vq_Wfz8zHoI3YipEw_Dqw
