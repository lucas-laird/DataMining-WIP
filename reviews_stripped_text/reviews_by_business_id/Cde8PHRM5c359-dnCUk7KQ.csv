It is a lovely place and the staff was friendly but not over the top annoying.  I will give it that.The food was sub par compared to most of the places in Vegas in the same price range. I had blandish chicken and  my boyfriend had a huge dried out looking expensive steak (something that looked more like a steak from a suburban chain for 17.99  than an upscale casino restaurant). It is the type of place that chooses not to put salt and pepper on the table, but the food needs salt and pepper. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good. It felt much more like a $50 meal than a well over $100 meal. I would recommend going in for a drink but not staying for dinner. I won't be going back again.",yn9HxA3MyJDE0YomSYmWfg,0,0,3,KnWuFjrMcrWH3IBw7-415Q

As far as food goes I was pretty pleased with everything I ate.  For an appetizer I tried the crab cake which I thought was really good, but a bit on the small side.  For an entree I had the Blackened Kansas City Strip with the brandied peppercorn sauce.  I thought the steak and sauce were really good, but the shrimp were way overdone.  For a side I had the wasabi mashed potatoes which were decent.  
As stated before, the service was terrible.  At this price point you at least expect the the waiter to come by and check on you every so often.  Or, when you see that pre-dinner cocktails are now empty at least ask if anyone needs another drink.",kngL5mBU4Dcal41rXwACXw,0,0,3,yrPVepRTNw8MkVsGKanpRA

First off, food is excellent. Australian lobster tail nearly took up half the table...seriously, I'll post a pic.
Definitely start with the oysters, really really good....and huge!
Filet Mignon was standard, but the selection of sides were great. Good to share....try them all, especially the horseradish potatoes.

The ambiance was definitely less than what we had hoped for right out the gate. Granted we had a large party (15), and it was great that put us in a private room, but that said, we were also really separated from the environment. Great music out in the larger dining room and bar, but we were stuck with easy-listening ""I'm in waiting room and really bored"" music.

We wanted something really special. After looking at the menu and reviews, we chose Kokomo's.  What a sad disappointment.

The restaurant is very near to to the check-in desk. It was loud. It had a dated look - as if it's better days were in the 80's. Service was laughable - the server shook her head, ""no,"" at -every- item one person in our party ordered, prompting our friend to choose another (and another) item. At first, it seemed helpful, but it really was laughable. And the server tried hard to upsell us to a $165 ""special,"" even suggesting that the table could share it.

Food was ok. Mac & Cheese was nothing special - most of the sides were underseasoned. Proteins were fine for the most part.

Total bill was $350 for four people. Crazy expensive for ok food, bad location, and horrid service. If you are accustomed to fine dining, this will be a disappointment.",VmOKCbXzXOR2O0KE6UxW4Q,0,0,2,8H-pYzMY0lMrYVoMkDj6lA

Before the idiots at MGM/Mandalay Bay decided to screw with changing the decor of the rooms, the casino, and the volcano....Kokomo's rocked!!!  The service was supberb and my beloved Fra Diablo was not only $18, but the best dish I've ever eaten.  And you had a server and a team of 3-4 other assistants helping him.  My husband and I always ordered the same thing, and could count on our bill being under $150.  From 2001 - 2005, I ate her 5-6 times a year before moving to Vegas in 2006...when the place went to the crapper.

The entire restaurant and menu are redone, and the server and his team are now extinct.  My beloved Fra Diablo is no where to be found on the menu.  BUT, my server assures me....the chef can make it, he just needs to know what's in it.  (WHAT????)
I was so excited to have my Fra Diablo that when it came I literally started to cry.  It was soupy, cold, and the seafood was overcooked.  I sent it back.  Fast forward to the check arriving...this dish is now $85!!! and the manager refused to take it off my bill because it was a ""special order.""  

All my friends who I referred to Kokomo's at one point in time or another, have expressed nothing but disappointment, bad service, and bad food when they have eaten here.  I'm so ashamed.....

My dad had the crab cake, surf and turf, and chocolate cake, while I had the carrot salad, salmon, and butterscotch custard. The crab cake and carrot salad were just okay. The surf and turf dish was wonderful - the steak was like butter, and the shrimp was tasty. The salmon was a very hefty portion, not too fishy, in a nice light sauce, but the accompanying side of rice was terribly bland. Desserts were good but not great. For the price, this is a great deal, but I'd probably recommend trying the other higher-rated Mirage restaurants instead. On our night at Mirage, Onda and Fin were closed, Japonais was no longer serving their lounge meal for 2 (5-8PM only), and we didn't want Stack since we've eaten at sister restaurant Fix already...so we were stuck with Kokomo's.

Initially, without even seeing the place first, just from the name, I thought it was going to be an obnoxious Jimmy Buffet-type high end burger place. I was intensely mistaken.

Great ambiance, melding into the ""secret garden"" entrance of The Mirage casino. We chose the lobster bisque appetizer, petite filet mignon main course and vanilla bean cheesecake dessert. 

The five stars you see here is from the lobster bisque alone. It came with a fresh croissant puff thing on top of the bowl that was the best compliment to the bisque. I'd like to eat this as part of my final meal on this earth.

The filet was good, but it was hard to top that bisque. I was still riding that flavor roller coaster when this dish came in. I would say the meat was a smidge too charred for my personal taste, but it's ok that other people dig that.

The cheesecake was small, but I imagine that's the serving size for the show combo. Nonetheless, it was creamy and pleasant.

Ask if a table near the jungle is available as you're next to the trees, the waterfall and the stream. Actually, no table is far from the jungle, but somehow sitting at the wall seemed special to me and my wife. We looked at the prix fixe menu, but ordered from the regular dinner menu.  As for the food, you have to try the lobster bisque, you WILL NOT regret it, but be ready to eat as it's covered will a flaky puff pastry that looks as good as it tastes. The lamb chops were the largest I've ever seen (looked like turkey drumsticks) cooked perfectly, medium rare, tender and juicy. The sea bass was also tremendous. Wasabi mashed potatoes were ordered with the lamb and a baked potato nicely filled out the sea bass. No room for dessert, unfortunately, but only because the portions, at least the portions of the food we ordered, we plenty large and quite filling. The service was a bit crowded and at times we weren't sure who our server was. I'm not one to complain about too much service, but I actually think less would have been more. Maybe it's because it wasn't packed when we dined there, but it just seemed like there was too much service. Nice problem to have as it isn't normally the case at many places, but really a bit too much. I think some of the prices could be lower, but still they aren't anything extraordinarily high, especially by Las Vegas standards. All of that being said, I would definitely recommend Kokomo's based on our visit. Well worth the trip and the price.",gbWh8NeWXgZYwvfO9oageQ,0,0,4,Qb5wMYLN4sbzEPmkrO1wbw

Once we were seated, we showed the tickets to the server and he said that it was an old coupon, we replied that the tickets were for that days show, so how could they be old.  He then doubted the validity of our tickets and told us to go to the Love Ticket Office.  So we walked through the casino to the ticket booth and was told that we needed to go and see the concierge to sort out the problem.  Well, another treck in another direction and another line got us to the concierge.  He walked us to the restaurant and tried to explain that the tickets were valid but the restaurant refused to accept the coupon.  By this time, we knew that we would not have enough time to enjoy the full price of the set meal which is now $49. 99. So we left and had to eat at one of the fast food establishments.  Not what we had expected when we were in Vegas celebrating my Birthday and anniversary.
So I am unable to give any stars for the food and would not give one star for the service, but that is beyond my control.

484518,2007-08-06,0,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,"A classy restaurant located in a tropical rainforest. The waterfalls and a lagoon offer a serene, romantic atmosphere for diners. 

They boast fresh seafood and prime steaks. Be aware and eat at your own risk. The portions are quite outrageous. A piece of steak is probably enough for two persons. Sides for red meat must be ordered separately (but probably unnecessary unless you are a big eater), while seafood dishes are accompanied with sides. The crab cakes are made differently according to the season; for the summer: red peppers and corn were added to crab meat on a bed of Asian cabbage salad. The salad was quite tasty but the main component is the crab cake, not the salad (3:1 ratio). I was extremely disappointed when my Prime Rib came out over-cooked and a Bone-in Rib-eye. Side note: My friend asked me not to say anything because she didn't want to make a scene. The situation made my experience that much more horrible. My friend had the Roasted Chicken with Herb Vegetables. The chicken, dry and tough; and where were the herbs for the vegetables? Maybe dessert would be better; only if they were serving the Vanilla Creme Brule. We order the Trio of Crme Brule: Vanilla, Chocolate and Raspberry. The chocolate broke and the chocolate layer floated on top with had a coarse texture. The raspberry was actually, even coarser. The vanilla was exquisite, texture was smooth, flavor was there, perfect sweetness but for the money I'm spending, where are the vanilla beans?

Service was a roller coaster. Our server was helpful and attentive at first. He attended and listened but after the dishes came out he somewhat disappeared. Busboy aka Server Assistant (SA) picked up the slack and it was nice. I understand the restaurant was coming to a close but as long as customers are inside, please work like it just opened. I hope the server thanked his SA.

Located in the main lobby of the Mirage across from the check-in/out desk lies Kokomo's -- a mainstay of Las Vegas and this hotel for many, many years.  It's been there since I can remember from when I was a wee little lad partying in Vegas and always dining at a steak and seafood spot under the once-beautiful Mirage atrium.  

The food is just absolutely incredible here.  Surf and tuf is definitely a good combination to have for your restaurant.  I always get the same thing here: The New York Strip and the Sea Bass.

New York Strip:
A massive, tender cut of Ny strip served with an A-1 type sauce, but it tastes a little sweeter.  I'm not sure what it is, but it's the sauce they give me every time and it's amazing.  Pair it with the lobster mashed potatoes (a little pricey at $21, but worth it, sort of).

Sea Bass:
This is basically a huge chunk of amazingly prepared fish drenched in butter.  You can't tell from looking at it, but it sure tastes that way.  The fish just crumbles onto your fork beautifully and the first bite is just as good as the last.  Highly recommended.

The oysters are excellent as well.

The ambiance was very dark and quiet with music playing gently in the background. The waiter was extremely attentive without being annoying. The cranberry and bacon bread was amazing! I don't even like bread but this was something exquisite. My date ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup with a Puff Pastry Dome. It was definitely a larger portion than she anticipated but it certainly was amazing. I had a caesar salad with an egg-less dressing and crisp parmesan cheese ( I held the anchovies). We both ordered the 8 oz fillet, oscar topped. Definitely the best steak I've had in long time. Not the best I've had but what's wrong with a close second. We also had Washington apple martinis as that was the drink on special. I can't remember how it's made but it certainly was unique and tasty. This place is a little pricey. Just two of us came to a little over $200 for what I described above but you're in Vegas, everything is a little pricey. I wouldn't pay that much for USDA prime anywhere else. For that price you can get certified Angus beef or even Kobe.

After a show, my girl and I decided  - well she decided  - to get something to eat. We decided on Kokomo's because it was in the Mirage and she loves that place. GOOD CHOICE

Warning - We spent over $200 for 2 people, so if you are on a budget, RUN. If not, stay and enjoy one of the best meals I have had EVER!

No reservations, but it was 6 PM on Sunday, so no wait. The restaurant says it's a ""rain forest"" atmosphere, and yes there are plants everywhere. 

Services as 5-Star (as expected from fine dining at the Mirage), and the food.....Mmmm the food. 

Okay, first Shrimp. OMG Huge, perfectly prepared and delicious. Jax had Lobster Bisque and she loved it. We both ordered steaks. Let me tell you, it was soooo good and cooked to perfection. The next morning I woke up starving, and took a chance with my steak cold. STILL DELICIOUS. Now that's a quality piece of meat. 

As a concierge, since my visit to Kokomo's I have sent 4 clients there. All loved it and gave me high marks for the recommendation. Even if you are not staying at the Mirage, definitely take a trip up/down the strip and enjoy a meal.",1mcspXwi0cnbu0_4VJf2Uw,2,0,5,Lu8rac8YC0BuKNyU9R7BZQ

This is mainly because I often travel alone and prefer to dine in the bar or lounge area of the restaurant so I don't take up a whole table by myself. I've done that and it's awkward. It also nice to chat with the bartenders, especially when they have real personalities as they do at the Mirage. 

On this trip I just wanted a water and something simple, so I ordered the Prime Rib Nachos. They came out quickly and were excellent. I wouldn't say there were overwhelming portions of meat on them, but it was certainly adequate. The overall size of the nacho plate was so large I think I only got through about half of it. 

This is a nice lounge to people watch. It's right by the front entrance, main desk, and in the middle of the indoor tropical forest area complete with waterfalls. I could sit here for hours and in fact, I have in the past when I had a lot of time to kill. The staff are pretty consistent and by now remember me. Like a lot of places in Vegas, their nametags also show where they're from. So that's often a great conversation starter. 

There are two TVs here which usually show sports. There are also several video poker games right on the bar. If you look straight up, you'll see the sky because a huge glass dome is directly above you. It's very scenic but can also be quite bright. I've seen people sitting at the bar wearing sunglasses certain times of the day, not to look cool mind you but to keep from going blind. 

Great food, games, nice staff, a view of tons of people, a waterfall, a tropical forest, and the sky. Hard to find all that anywhere but here, it's all in one place.",NOWHAb-N0BBLVc_WPklY7w,1,0,4,R2IWH2UFKI4iP4jrcWwxhA

We arrived at the very beginning of our seating time which was between 5 and 6 pm since the show was at 7 pm. The place was pretty empty so we got a great table next to the watery garden area. We had a total of three servers that accommodated our table, so we always had everything we needed. 

We were given a Prix Fixe menu valued at $40 a meal which included an appetizer, entree and dessert. They had lots of fancy options for the main course like filet mignon and salmon but nothing for vegetarians. The waitress assured me that the chef could prepare a special dish. Three of us ordered glasses of wine, which were about an additional $10 a pop.   

I started off with the beet salad, which was delicious - I just wish there was a little bit more of it. When it was time for our entrees, I got a plate of perfectly prepared carrots, kale, mushrooms, mashed potatoes and asparagus. Dessert was this huge, rich slice of chocolate torte. I literally cleaned every plate put in front of me.  

So with our lovely view of the indoor water garden came these little birds that were chirping and fluttering around. One actually perched unbeknownst to us on the lattice ceiling and dropped a bomb on my mom's arm. We all thought it was funny, but when my dad casually mentioned it to the waitress, she said it was a big deal and got the manager. He apologized profusely and comped the additional $60 bill we had from the taxes on our meal and the beverages. We really weren't that upset but it was a very nice gesture. 

The meal was timed perfectly and we had plenty of time to get to the theater and find our seats. So besides a little bird trouble, this place was great!",gyMSJrfyGPdcOeYBK2cqmA,7,1,5,R8R4uNy-jXGJG3FkxWAXyg

1) the service was excellent - my friends and I were in Vegas  and wanted to have wine with our steak. We asked the waiter if buying by the glass was worth it or if we should pay for the whole bottle instead.The menu of course did not have the price associated with the wine, which was why we asked the question in the first place. The waiter indicated that a glass of wine for each of us would be enough. As the nite got later, the waiter kept coming by and filling up our glass of wine. I swear...we had like 3 fill glasses each by the end of the nite and only paid for one =)

2) the food was outstanding for the price - I dunno about anyone else, but my fillet was cooked just right. My friend had the same meal as I did and were both raving about the steak. My other friend had the prime rib and the word ""WOW"" comes to mind. The prime rib was soOOoo big that the table next to us could not stop laughing. Not only did the prime rib look huge, but it was very juicy and tasty. 

3) the atmosphere was beautiful - we had a really nice table with a clear ceiling. We could see the stars sighing at nite. Highly romantic and elegant. 

4) the price - What can say...for how much we drank and ate...the price was really reasonable compared to Ruth Chris, Maestro, etc.

We ordered the Valentine's Day Menu for Two and the meal was delicious from start to finish.  Service was slightly flawed - Kokomo's uses a two server/one busser system which usually results in impeccable service.  Unfortunately I think our second server, an older gentleman whose name we didn't catch, was new.  He brought our first course, chilled crab claws, oysters and prawns, before the amuse and when we asked him about it he argued with us that the sorbet comes after the appetizer.  He then brought the sorbet, a micro scoop of lime floating in a cordial glass of ginger ale, which was in fact meant to come just prior to the main course, while we were still eating the first course.  Our busser saved the day by bringing the amuse after he cleared the appetizer dishes.  It was well worth the struggle as the truffled cauliflower cream topped with caviar was sublime.  Really, I'm not exaggerating.  Sublime.  Our primary server, Sam, then brought out our main course, a large, perfectly cooked New York Strip served with green peppercorn sauce, grilled asparagus and a potato waffle (think potato pancake cooked in a belgian waffle maker).  The older waiter presented my plate backwards and Sam swooped in behind him to correct the error.  They stepped away from the table and moments later the older gent came back to ask if everything was okay service-wise. I thought that was kind of sweet.  After I finished what I could of my perfect meal and donated the remainder to my willing husband the dessert was served.  I don't recall who brought it but it would have been nice to have someone explain what exactly was on the tasting plate.  Regardless, most of the 5 selections were delicious (the exception being the overly sweet red velvet cake pops - yuck).  The layered strawberry thingy (we don't know what it was??!!!) was the shining star, though.

We came here after our wedding and  before the Love show on the recommendation of my sister who had a wonderful meal here last year.

We made reservations for 7:30 and were sat pretty much immediately. The ambiance was lovely - low lighting and we could hear the waterfall, lots of plants. Our waiter came over and gave us the menus and then disappeared for a little longer than he should have. When he came back, we ordered a magnum of the Moet & Chandon champagne ($145). They didn't have it in stock, but were able to get it from another restaurant in the hotel, which I thought was great of them to do that.

The bread came and was SO good. There were these little rolls with this sweet salt on top that were just delicious. They also had these pretzel rolls that were so good.

I started with the lobster bisque, which was AMAZING. The puff pastry top was thick and tender. The soup was light, yet super flavorful and the lobster was tender and delicious. I was REALLY happy with this bisque.

For entrees, I ordered the scottish salmon ($34) with bernaise sauce and my husband ordered the chilean sea bass ($41) (with the pineapple/red pepper salsa at the waiter's suggestion).  Our sides were the broccoli & cauliflower gratin with brie cheese and the lobster mashed potatoes.  Our food came and I poured the bernaise over my salmon, took a bite and realized the sauce was barely room temp. Not thrilled. I asked them to warm it up, but it came back exactly the same temp, so I just wrote it off. My salmon was very typical, nothing special at all. BUT...my husband's sea bass was SOOOOOOOOOO AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!! It was the most delicious food I've had in my entire life. The pineapple and red pepper salsa was so perfect with the fish, I couldn't believe it. I wish I'd ordered that myself. The broccoli & cauliflower gratin was just okay. It came with a big piece of cold brie on top, which I thought was a little weird. However, the lobster mashed potatoes ($20) were the 2nd most delicious bite I've had in my life. They came with bacon lardons, scallions and creme fraiche. AMAZING. So delicious. We couldn't get enough.

They brought us out this vanilla bean cheesecake thing for dessert to celebrate our wedding, which was nice. It was very good and I loved the crust.

It's an odd restaurant in that the food is a bit upscale but, like many places in Las Vegas, it's perfectly acceptable to be wearing shorts and flip flops.  So, upscale food but casual setting.

We had the goat cheese salad and the shrimp-scampi-like dish as appetizers.  The salad was pretty standard and probably would have been better if there were more big hunks of goat cheese.  Instead, it was smeared on the crostini that came with the salad but, once mix in with the greens, etc., was good.  The shrimp dish was very good.  There were three large butterflied shrimp over an orzo (I think) pasta with just a bit of sauce.  I skipped the orzo as it was pretty bland but the shrimp were very good.

For my entree, I had the daily special of halibut which was served in lemon butter with capers over sautéed spinach.  It was delicious.  I would get this again.  My friend had the Australian lobster.  It was good and pretty big but perhaps a bit rubbery.  I would pick the halibut over the lobster.  We also shared sides of asparagus, garlic mashed potatoes, and macaroni and cheese, all of which were good and were large servings.

For dessert, we shared the molten chocolate lava cake and the crème brulee.  The crème brulee was good but not great, but it was huge.  The molten chocolate thing was very good and very rich.  If I was more of a chocolate person, I would probably have loved this.

I did not have wine with dinner but they did appear to have a very nice and expansive wine list.  I would look forward to working my way through parts of it in the future.

I think everything was pretty expensive.  I'm not really sure of the total since my friend was getting it comped so I didn't pay much attention to the total, but it seems that the entrees at least were quite pricey.  But, overall it was good and I'd return.",tIP5tmJzK2jFKJh6lE-_Ag,2,2,4,HMaXHyoNkOc_UIfZ48Id5A
2639278,2011-02-16,0,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,"Had dinner here before seeing Love on a Friday night.  We made a reservation on Open Table for 8pm and the show was at 9:30pm.  I noticed online they had a Prix Fixe menu, but they don't offer that to you unless you ask.  It's definitely the way to go, because the prices are a little high on the menu.  For $40 per person, you get an app, entree and dessert.

I had the beet salad, salmon and chocolate torte.  The hubby went with the crispy shrimp, filet and spice cake.  The food was pretty good.  The hubby said it was one of the best filets he's had in a while.  My salmon was was a huge portion and very good.  We really enjoyed the food.

The only problem was the slow service.  They were nice, but slow.  They were giving all their attention to a private party in a room behind us.  It was getting close to 9, so we asked for our dessert as soon as we got our entree.  It was 30 minutes between our app and entree!  At least our server's assistance understood our rush to get to our show.

I liked this place and would come again.  Allow plenty of time before a show or tell them in advance about it.",oO6R9Vbe_HmVBjnMiHUqXQ,0,0,4,_6LJ5khpVE6OYogt1IvJYw
2742952,2009-07-27,0,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,"Came here for dinner before the ""Love"" show. The 4 of us all dined from the $29.99 fixe prix menu. This menu is truly a fantastic deal! Nothing else on the menu was under $30, and certainly did not include three courses! We had requested a ""jungle"" table which was nice because we didn't have many other tables around us, just a nice jungle view and an intimate setting to enjoy our meal. 
For starters 3 of us had the shrimp cake and one of us had the summer salad. All of it was beautifully presented and very tasty. The shrimp cake was absolutely amazing.
For the main course I had the mahi mahi which was served with potatoes and veggies and was great. Not too fishy, good portion size, and cooked perfectly. The other three in my group had the steak and all gave it good reviews.
For desert I had the chocolate cake which was good but not great. But by that time I didn't have much room anyways and was pleasantly satisfied with the rest of my meal to care too much. 
One more thing: the bread basket was to die for. The olive bread was some of the best bread I have ever had!

Service was good, they were very professional though it did take a bit to get my second drink. Everyone else got theirs fast though and our server was busy, so no worries.

For the price I would definitely recommend checking out Kokomo's for a nice Vegas meal at a great price! With a couple drinks each and the three course dinner our party of four got out for under $200 with tax and tip! :)",1D5EQITb4hOzPMZT8gDPQQ,0,0,4,47UJdCYMLXtqQY93jtGi0g
2776774,2009-07-21,0,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,"I do love the buffets, but sometimes even the best buffet can't equal up to a nice dinner at a swank restaurant....so my friends decided to mix things up and go all out before we went to see the Cirque de Soleil Beatles LOVE show. As it was old people dinner time (5:30 PM), there was nobody here, so we figured we had time to give this place a try.

The design and atmosphere of the place is very soothing and unique. You're seated right next to the jungle by the Wynn entrance, which gives the illusion that you're enjoying a nice dinner outside even though you are actually in a nice, comfortable air conditioned hotel. 

Food here was FANTASTIC. Their lobster bisque ($11) was perhaps the best lobster bisque I've ever had. It came encased with a bread top akin to a chicken pot pie, and had just right levels of flavor and consistency that every gulp was seafood heaven. The crabcakes were quite good too. They were actually little balls of crab served up with a tasty serving sauce. I haven't eaten crab cakes served in that form before, but it certainly delivered. Of course, these two were just appetizers for the main course...an 8oz fillet mignon with 3 cajun spiced jumbo shrimp ($52). I hadn't had a real steak in a long time, so every bite into this steak was heaven. The meat was so flavorful and tender that it dissolved in my mouth the way only a superb steak can. 

So after all this, why an average of 3 stars? The service here was sadly HORRIBLE. Even though there were very few people here, it was hard to catch the attention of our disappearing waiter. Now I don't know if their lack of attention to our needs was just out of random neglect or because we were the only diners that weren't middle aged rich retirees, but when you're in a hurry, its annoying to see that the table of 60 year old high rollers next to you are already getting their appetizers when you're still waiting for your menus. Also, they asked us if we wanted bottled water and our response was is that we just wanted tap water. Of course they end up pouring us TWO bottles of water which we found out later on the receipt were $8.50 each (which brings up another annoying point....no bottle of water should ever be $8.50 unless it gives me the gift of flight). The final insult to injury is that as we rushed out of there to make the show..we didn't notice that they had accidentally charged us for the 2 beers for the table NEXT to us (yes, the same 60 year old high rollers who were snacking on their lobster tails while I was unhappily chewing on my bread).

With service and mess-ups like this, I'd normally rank a little lower...but the quality of the food was so good and I'm willing to believe that it may be possible that we just got shafted with the restaurants' one crappy waiter....so I'd be willing to come back and give it another chance....maybe this time with the high roller parents.",9a4VW5YBBnN1hNz4qvJJ8g,0,0,3,S_fHQUl1BOudlB1OF-APdQ

Well, to start. The bread they brought out was cold, and not fresh. I ordered a glass of wine and my waitress assured me they didn't have that available by the glass, although I was looking right at it on the menu. Then came back to tell me, they were out of that anyways. My girlfriend started with the lobster bisque and I started with crab cakes. The lobster bisque portion and crab cake portions were very small.  The crab cakes were ok. The lobster bisque was supposed to be a big deal, but was overly salty to me. I had a New York steak which came out well done, I asked for it medium.

I sent the steak back, the manager came over and apologized. Offered to make it right. But we were in a hurry because of the show. I ordered a vegetable au gratin dish on the side. It was a hilarious presentation of food. It looked like broccolini and cauliflower with milk poured over it. And a hunk of Brie cheese laid over the top. Was I supposed to bake this at home later?  I was embarrassed for them. Left hungry. And felt like I overpaid for everything.

We started off with the Washington Red Apple Martinis at the suggestion of our waiter. And I am not a martini fan since most of those kind of drinks taste like gasoline to me. This one was really good! I was surprised how tasty it was. 

The service was really good, the wait staff were on it and were always there if you needed anything! The food was delicious, we had the fillet Mignon, top sirloin, and salmon. All was cooked exactly how we ordered. My top sirloin was smothered in wild mushrooms with their homemade steak sauce. It was so big that I couldn't finish it.

To top it off we ordered the beignets with cinnamon ice cream and bananas! Yum-myyy! I love me some French dough nuts with coffee...

Best crab legs I've ever had.  Got 1 lb of crab legs for and I couldn't even finish them.  You can definitely split them with another person and add a salad or side and it would be perfect.  They are sliced in half so you don't have to go through all the messy work of getting all crab meat out.  We also ordered the surf and turf -  1/2 lb crab legs and lamb chops.  That is another dish you can probably share with someone else as it is way too much food for one person.  Crab legs are delish, lamb chops were pretty good too, cooked very well.  Make sure you try the lobster bisque - one of the best bisques I've had.  Its served in a ramekin bowl with a sort of pastry breading baked around it.  They didn't skimp in the crab meat.

I think it's ridiculous that you have to order sides on your own and it does not come with the entree. Three of us shared the scallops, the sea bass, porterhouse steak and had a taste of the crab cake and oysters. The scallops were nice and tender. The sea bass I felt could have used a bit more flavor other than salt and butter. I really wanted a nice sauce with the sea bass to bring out the sweetness of the fish, but I didn't get that. We chose some type of red wine sauce to go along with our steak and it was lacking flavor. I really liked the tomato butter sauce and thought that went great with the steak. I wanted the crab cakes to be a bit more juicier. I guess this is because they don't put mayonnaise in their crab cakes. 

Service was great. They dealt with my drunk friend who asked for shots and beer and was completely drunk, so I give them props for that. I didn't like the fact that it was REALLY cold inside the restaurant because we sat near the water.

It's definitely a swanky Vegas joint, so go in with money... our bill for 10 of us was about 850 + tip, AND this was on restaurant week when we went (which means it's a bit cheaper for a full course meal).

Wine was good, pricey still as usual.

Food was good, can't complain there, I was happy about this.

Also was pretty happy that they put all of us in a private room because we had such a large party.  This was wonderful.

Our server was ok, but at the end we were trying to split up the bill - and he purposely didn't come back in for at least 30 minutes.  He'd peak his head in and walk out without making eye contact.  I KNOW it was because he didn't want to split the bill for us, and this pissed me off a bit.  I still tipped 20%, but wasn't happy about it, ha.

Last thing, we didn't get our deserts that we ordered with the ""restaurant week"" menu.  We were all pretty drunk and didn't want them at that point - but still, they should have came without us asking for them again.

We arrived at the restaurant and we were seated in a timely manner.  The place seemed nice, but I don't understand the whole dim lighting thing in restaurants.  

Anyways, waitress came over and took our drink orders, i just ordered for now and my bf asked about a red wine she would recommend.  She asked glass or bottle, he took ONE glass, she questioned if it was just one and I don't drink wine so just one.  As for my water she asked if I wanted regular or bottled, not still or sparkling like they normally would at a restaurant like this.  BTW, I heard her ask a table next to us if they wanted sparkling or still.

As she walked away, we had a chance to look at the menu.  The menu we received was only the prixe fix menu.  Just because I asked doesn't mean I don't want to see the regular menu.  Now that I see we've only received the prixe fix menu, I think I understand why the waitress did what she did when we ordered our drinks.  She probably thought we were cheap customers.  You can't stereotype people nowadays.  So now I was kinda upset, it's cool they were able to reflect that I asked about the prixe fix menu, but at least offer me the regular menu as well.  I'm on vacation and I'm here to spend money, unless you don't want it, I can leave.  But we chose to give them a chance since we were already there.

We were able to grab the attention of another waiter serving the table next to us, because ours just seemed to disappear for awhile.  We asked for the regular menus and when he returned with them, he told us about the specials they had for the night without even hesitating.  I liked him a lot, too bad he wasn't our waiter.

Well we ordered our food, I got the prixe fix menu and my bf got some steak with shrimp on top.  I also ordered the lobster bisque that everyone was raving about.

So the food was good, the other people that brought out our food and drinks and the other table's waiter were awesome, but our waitress lady who chose to stereotype was being critiqued every minute and I didn't like her too much.  I guess after we ordered from the regular menu on top of the prixe fix menu, she started to be a little nicer.  But the fact that she acted the way she did in the beginning really disturbed me.

My bf and I are part of the middle class and we like to splurge every once in awhile.  These servers at these higher end restaurants have to understand that.  And if your restaurant is willing to put out a prixe fix menu, that means they are trying to attract other people so they too can enjoy the food they are providing, as well as the service.  I wouldn't show up at restaurant or at least stay at a restaurant if I knew I couldn't afford it.   You have to treat each person that walks into your restaurant equally at least when they first walk in.  If they happen to be troublesome once you've seated and spoke to them, then I can understand the attitude, but not before you get that chance.

Because of her, my bf and I will probably not go to kokomo's again even tho the food was still good.",HIjaoZWxQDRuqxM9KbCknA,0,0,3,q7LcvOJSskS-5ziIRCQZaA

We had the prawns with garlic spaetzle as an app for two folks, but I think each of us could have ordered one for ourselves and had a meal out of it.  It was great!

We also had the lobster bisque, which has a flaky pastry crust on top.  This was the best part and I do agree with another post that the bisque itself was somewhat salty and didn't have a ton of the shell and meat in it, but that was still ok with me.  It tasted great and came in a good size portion.  

For the entree I had the seabass and it was perfect texture and preparation.  I can't comment too much more on it because I was too full from the soup and app to actually eat the whole thing.

In terms of service, it was very quick.  Plates were removed promptly when we were done, crumbs were scraped off, and we were checked on constantly.

Took up the 'Dinner & Show' package the Mirage offers on their website. The sis was turning 21 so we decided to splurge.
The set menu had multiple choices for each course. My choices (for those interested) are listed below.

1. Vodka soda with orange slices and a heaping basket of fresh breads and muffins. STOKED ALREADY.

2. French onion soup gratin with gruyere cheese. Dude, so good. My mom is a connoisseur on f.o.s. and she agreed. Flavor combinations were perfect. I want some right now.

3. Vodka soda with orange slices part two and the most heavenly piece of meat atop red skin mashed potatoes. Properly cooked (medium rare, duh) petit filet mignon glazed with mushroom jus. So juicy, so buttery, so freakin delicious. 

4. French roast coffee and vanilla bean cheesecake with homemade graham crackers, peppered blackberries and whipped cream. Gah. Sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. A perfect end to a perfect meal.

Decor was beautiful and sensually stimulating. Sounds of waterfalls and modern art installations of fish swimming above the tables only added to this top notch evening.

Service was outstanding as well. Each table is assigned two servers and a host of help. Several of the servers even came by to wish my sister a happy birthday.

We are simple people that like to indulge in good meals since we had eaten at Onda's before we decided on Kokomos as the Prix Fixed menu caught my eye. We were able to get reservations for 6:30. We arrived and were seated prompt.. As mentioned by the other yelpers this place is in a very tropical setting so you feel like your eating outside but your not,. 

We started with our well drinks and bread, order 1/2 a dozen blue point oysters which were very fresh & tasty.

DH ordered the fillet minion and shrimp special and some $8.00 garlic mashed potatoes. I went with the prix fixed menu. 

DH steak was order Medium rare and was perfectly cooked. The Cajun shrimp were plump and cooked just right while the Cajun sauce had just the right amount of spice. The serving of mashed potatoes looked small but were tasty and DH couldn't eat them all so I guess the portion size was good.

I had the crab cakes which were the best I've ever had, it came with a mustard type dipping sauce and some green beans covered in an orange colored sauce. All I can say is wow, i wanted to lick the bowl! 
The nut crusted salmon was cooked perfectly to my liking, it was moist and tasty, the rice tasted okay it was not as tender as I cook mine. The chocolate cake was amazing. 

Service was very attentive, dirty dishes removed quickly, drinks refilled. 

Our surrounding diners made the dinner a fun night. 

Damage: Food $102, cocktails and beer: 33.00, tax $11, tip $25.00 

All in all a very good and memorable meal in Vegas.

I wasn't exactly in the mood for seafood, so my eyes went directly to the prime rib on the menu. The waiter gave me a mind-boggling look and said ""are you sure now? It's quite a huge portion"". Looking at the price, it was only $30, so I thought I'd be getting a 12-16oz. I gave him a look of confidence and with a prideful smile, I told him it'll be a piece of cake.

Boy was I wrong.

When they brought the dish over, he attempted to be funny and said ""here you go, Mrs. Flinstone"". Normally, I would've taken that as an insult, but I was too shocked to even respond to his smartass remark. I was floored. My medium rare slab of prime rib took up my entiiiiire side of the table at about 2 1/2 inches thick. O_O!! I didn't know what to do with it! I even offered half of it to the table behind us full of hungry men that were dumbfounded at the sight of my dish. All but 3 bites was boxed up. It was the first time I failed to finish meat at the table. I wanted to curl up in the corner and cry.

Michelle - 0, Prime Rib - 1.

All jokes aside, I found the meat to be pretty flavorful and it was cooked perfectly. I also tried my friend's lobster tail and THAT was delish. If you're not  fan of rare fish, remember to ask them to fire your plate a lil longer because the salmon and the sea bass came out a tad undercooked. I loved the tropical rain forest vibe to the place and the service was phenomenal...even though they made me feel like a total heffer. I think it was just his way of rubbing it in that there was no possible way, even if all the divine forces of the Earth came together, that I could have finished that prime rib and he had given me a fair warning.

I'll come back, but I know when to accept defeat. I will challenge the prime rib no more.",Nn-hLgYTKNkJQ-G7LSXG3g,1,1,4,PR4Q_9sGJLvfyapmBIu1ZQ

Usually, there were two or three waiters/bus staff at a table when a course was brought.  I was brought a second iced tea when I still had 1/3 glass remaining and I didn't have to ask.  The meal was wonderful.  I had the Duck Confit Caesar salad for an appetizer, Filet Mignon and Crab Gratin for the main course, and Buttermilk Spice Cake for dessert.

The ambience of Kokomo's is very nice.  If you're familiar with the Mirage, it's a part of the area under the dome - the atrium  with live palm trees, blooming orchids, and tourists in the distance walking through the atrium.

A friend suggested this was a good place to go after dark when the room is darker with soft lighting.  I can understand that now, and I plan to return for a dinner when it's dark out.

I never ate out like that before but it was great for my first time eating high roller style.  I only say high roller cause of the price of each item!  The only thing that sucked is the presentation...the plate was bare, and you have to order sides la a carte.

Food: I ordered off the pre fixe menu which came with fried shrimp as an app, salmon over roasted root veggies with a tomato hollandaise, and chocolate cake for dessert. The shrimps were tempura style (you get four) were large, but were a bit on the oily side. The salmon must have been cooked by a trainee (bad texture, diner quality), the root veggies were average and the hollandaise was delicious. The chocolate cake was decent. The mandarin pieces on the side were yummy.

My boyfriend had the scallops as an app and the surf and turf as an entrée. The scallops were really good, although, the sauce had too much butter (tasted greasy). The filet mignon was prepared very well. The lobster tail was OVERCOOKED! How could anyone overcook lobster?? It was a $100 entrée so I was expecting to be wowed. I was not wowed at all. He also had a 10 cane mojito, it needed more lime and alcohol.

Service: I believe half of the restaurant was staffed by one waitress. She was so inattentive. I practically had to wave my hand to get her attention. Our appetizers and entrees came on time, but my dessert was delayed. Two separate people came by to ask if I wanted dessert when I had ordered it with our ""waitress"" with the rest of my food earlier. She was too busy attending to the diners in the private dining room behind us. I waited and waited for the dessert. I also waited and waited for the check. The service was poor and impersonal.

Price was average, about what I expected, and the food quality was above average.

The Sea Bass I ordered, which is apparently the most popular dish, was good but was very simple/mild in flavoring. Actually, the only reason the dish ended up being good was because someone told me to request the butter sauce that does not actually come with the dish.

The sauce that comes with the dish is pretty funky, and if I hadn't known about the butter sauce someone suggested I might have been a bit peeved.

The sides are $10/each and do not come with the entree... I got the Broccoli/Cauliflower which they put in a small dish and cover it with a brie cheese sauce or something, it was good.

My girlfriend got the Filet Mignon cooked medium with mashed potatoes on the side. Her meat was overcooked and at $55 for just the piece of meat, I would expect them to cook it correctly. She didn't want to fuss about it so she ate it but I would have probably sent it back.

Her mashed potatoes were very average, but I think it was too safe of a choice anyways hah.

The lobster bisque as an appetizer was pretty good, worth getting.

Our two entrees (+ 1 side each) and lobster bisque as an appetizer came out to $130 before tip.

I looked at the prix fix menu which was $49.99 for a 3 course meal and I think that would have been a better idea, but all and all, what we got was OK too.

The soup is very creamy and rich, topped with a fluffy puff pastry.  But b/c it's so rich, it's best to be shared with 2 people so that you still have an appetite left for the rest of the meal.  If i had to rate this restaurant on the soup alone, it would have 5 stars...the soup is THAT good.   

Appetizer: If you enjoy oysters, the oysters on the 1/2 shell are fresh here.  

Main entrees: 
I've tried various cuts of steak here (filet mignon, NY, porterhouse) and they are only ok.  Not too impressed by the steak.  Not too flavorful and a bit on the dry side for me, even at medium-rare.  If you do the surf & turf, the lobster comes with a pretty good lemon-butter sauce, but the lobster is a bit on the tough side/overcooked.

My friend ordered a sea bass dish that was pretty good.  It was much better than any of the cuts of steak.  No fishy-taste & well prepared.  

Overall, the seafood here is prepared better than the steak.",53EWBX2QGISTDZJ1NZfyrA,4,0,3,lk3pXvf_nM3cblY9ZKY_RQ

I like the atmosphere. It is located in the ""rain forest"" area in Mirage, there is a casual and comfortable feel. No need for a jacket. 

We had scallops as an appetizer and the dish was really delicious! My entree was filet and shrimps, both very good - although the shrimp won the war of the plate. I think the steaks we had were really nice but not the best of our trip. However, the seafood was far superior to RM Seafood and probably the best we had during our week in LV.

made reservations and were quickly seated even though we were like 10-15 minutes late. the service here is awesome and the ambiance is great.  its located in the front area where the lobby is but you feel like you're in your own rainforest world with all the trees and waterfall surrounding you.  my friends all let me try a little bit of everything that they ordered... i dont know if it was cuz it was my birthday or they just were really nice =)

haha. but i did try the lobster bisque..which is FANTASTIC. it comes in this delicious flakey pastry dough bowl and is so creamy.. it definitely fills you up so if your planning on ordering this, an entree salad might be a good idea. also tried the raw oysters, which were fresh and tasted great with saltine crackers and tabasco.

had myself a glass of riesling and the filet mignon, which was cooked to perfectionnn and the mashed potato side was so creamy and delicious.  the pricing is pretty high... but from what ive heard its not as expensive as a lot of other vegas steakhouses.  i forget what dessert i had when they brought it out.. i think was pretty buzzed by this point so its hard to remember. but all in all i had a great experience here and highly recommend it, especially if your staying at the mirage!!",y50GvlDbkacUJZ7d8Vao9g,2,2,5,2dGxzv7TyHa-n3SXr5Nvsg
5134932,2012-03-08,1,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,"Full disclosure:  thanks to my adoration of the Cirque BEATLES LOVE show, I have an absolute AFFECTION for the Mirage Hotel.  I've stayed there maybe 8 times now and it's love at every sight.  This means I really wanted to LOVE Kokomos, okay?

Bias disclosed, I must admit I've only eaten at less than half of the restaurants in the Mirage.  I like BLT and the JAPONAIS, but I've always been intimidated by Kokomo's as being too too ritzy.  It also doesn't help that all over the internet (as here at Yelp) it's love it review, hate it review, love it review, hate it review.

Well my parents came to Vegas and were weary from flying -- and since they and my partner in crime love Steak and Fish houses like HOUSTONS (or any restaurant from the Hillstone Group), we figured Kokomos was just downstairs and wouldn't be awful.

It wasn't.  It was nice, but as the two stars indicate, I've experienced better.

Kokomos is the last restaurant from the original Mirage and feels as much somehow.  It's not vibrant, but a TIRED restaurant.  

Not the furnishings or decor, mind you.  I actually really like the idea of this place, a little 'cove' by fauna and water, hidden right in the middle of everything.  It is chill city if you're in the mood and the ambient casino people noise is really very pleasant.

By tired I don't mean the service was weak.  Everyone and their brother complains about the service here.   They're all nuts.  The only people who should complain are people in a hurry, and -- HELLO -- hit BLT if you want fast food.  The service was extremely friendly, attentive -- it was the best part of the meal.

So what was tired?  You guessed it:  the food.  Now by tired I don't mean lame.  It's just old school food with old school enthusiasm.  There was no mis-step on the table, but none of it was OMG we've got to come back.  The entire meal was 'nice'.... and 'nice' can be a bad thing in situations like this.  Why?  The menu prices were top dollar, the food wasn't.  And it's as simple as that.

The fix is stupid easy:  have the Hillstone Restaurant group absorb Kokomos and take over.  The menu would change a little, the quality would shoot through the roof.  The service would be fantastic, and in time you'd need to add an additional dining room.  Anyone who knows a good HOUSTONS knows exactly what I mean.

I love this type of old school menu and service.  Kokomos isn't a disaster, but doesn't deliver.

To end on a positive note, they recently added a vegetarian plate.  Not some lame pile of sides, but a collection of dishes prepared for the vegetarian.  The idea behind it was kind and my veggie partner appreciated it and enjoyed it, but she wasn't eager to have it ever again.  This consistent MEH response will kill any restaurant.

And, yes, Houston's has a veggie plate to die for.  Not to mention a homemade veggie burger which kills.",h-brvh9UKmAOKb0Q-VZpgg,2,1,2,l8WuDdf6lPWc0fXTTfHRNw

From the outside, it didn't seem like a 5 star restaurant that my friend explained to me.  Expecting it to be ""dress to impress"" type of restaurant, I found myself over dressed for dinner.

After the host lead us to our table, lonely but serene as it looked, there lay a single candle to give the table a small light.  The table was a square dark brown wooden table, and chairs as  you sit on it were not that comfortable but it did it's job.  My first drink was a bottle of Fiji water poured in a wine glass looking cup.  Considering I'd never been there, I asked my friend to order for me.  

Our wine was a white wine to accommodate for the sea food we were about to ingest.  The first course was Kokomo's Seafood on Ice.  oh my gosh!!!  The oyster on that was super duper great!  It was definitely the best oysters i've put in my stomach and in my mouth.  It had just the right amount of flavor of sea.  With a splash of lemon, cocktail sauce, and hot radish just hit the spot.

Next came the Kokomo's Lobster Bisque.  Mmmm... the flaky crust around the soup perfectly blended with the bisque.  I couldn't put it down.  I think i even scraped it till there was no sign of the soup.  For the sides, we had mashed potato, sauteed mushrooms, and jumbo asparagus.  By this time, i was already getting full.  Yet, there was more coming.  I had the Alaskan King Crab Legs.  I didn't know if I could finish this since it was oversized and my poor stomach was completely full with no room left.  But, slowly I managed to fit everything I could.  

We didn't end up with dessert.  I couldn't even look at another food after the meal we had.  I remember not being able to stand up.  Walking was also a challenge.  With all this, I still want to go back.  Seafood was awesome!",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,1,1,5,GD5D4B01ytNFzmi2ei4Clg

Came here with a large group, I ordered the lobster bisque, the prime rib, medium rare, and a side of sweet mashed potatoes. The bisque had a very very flaky, buttery, and scrumptious puff pastry top baked to a perfection. I gobbled up the puffy stuff in a jiffy. The soup was a little too salty and was more of a thick cream than a robust bisque. The prime rib was massive, and very juicy, even without much au jus on it. It wasn't very flavored, but the meat texture was good. Finally, the sweet mashed potatoes went very well with the prime rib, but by itself tasted like a slighty tangy, sweet potato mush.

The service was hard to flag down, and was always in a rush and rather abrupt. They also cleared the entire table before we were done eating. They took away someone's fries while he was still working on it! I was appalled by the careless and rushed service. It got to the point where just one person was eating, but the rest of us had no dishes/place settings, etc anymore because they had all been taken away so the person was basically eating while the rest of us sat around and stared at nothing. Not cool.

5429166,2011-08-22,0,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,"My hubby and I were going to see the Beatles Love show @ the Mirage and wanted a place to have dinner before hand.  The show was at 9:30, so we made a 7:30 appt.  Traffic was awful, and we arrive right around 7:40.  The place was busy, but not packed, so the hostess sat us no problem.  
The ambiance of the restaurant is really cool-- I will give it that.  It is nestled inside of the ""rainforest"" at the Mirage, so you feel like you are dining in a garden of sorts.  Very pretty! 
The service on the other hand was NOT so much.  I'm not sure if this is how they normally do it, but the hostess did not give us menus.  We were seated and then sat there for several minutes before the server came over and brought us menus.  To me, it seemed very inefficient.  After that, we waited over 15 minutes JUST to order our drinks!  
I asked to see the fixed prix menu (3 courses for $49.99, but you need to ask for it).  The server brought it over but then we waited forever for him to come back to actually order.  We finally ordered our meal.  My hubby ordered the lamb chops, and I ordered the roasted chicken.  We did start with the famous lobster bisque.  

The lobster bisque came out quickly (ordered with our cocktails), before we even put in our food order.  It was delicious, flavorful and big chuncks of lobster.  We waited another 40 min before I food even arrived.  We realized at one point, that we had been sitting there for an hour and all we had was wine and bread.  When the food finally came out, I was so terribly disappointed in the chicken.  It was so dry--  like it had been sitting underneath a heat lamp forever.  I had to use the dipping sauce, not because I wanted too, but because I couldn't swallow the food otherwise.  I had to literally ""saw"" at this with a steak knife to cut the meat.  My husbands lambchops did come our wonderful.  

Since at this point it was close to 9 pm, we decided to ask the server for the check right when the food came out.  When we asked for the check he had the audacity to say ""What? no dessert?""  Check was brought over... but he never came back to run the card!  We ended up giving it to another server who was walking by.  We never did see our server again for the rest of the evening.  

In most fine dining restaurants, if the kitchen is backed up, the manager will go around to ""touch"" the tables.  There was not a manager in sight.  If we weren't so crunched for time, I would have definitely asked to speak to one.  

**on a side note, we overheard the table right next to us complaining as well ** 

All in all, we were so disappointed in the quality of service and food we received here. We will not be returning.  The only reason I am giving this 2 stars instead of 1 is due to the ambiance.",O5w8hszgXvZGIJf0ngg-3A,1,0,2,489dd0vRjP0zzdDy5aZ1Tg

You can see him tell the story on Youtube.  It might be gross to many but I think it's one of the most hilarious stories ever.  ""A great fucking place"" he says! 

So it was an absolute MUST go when the buddy I joke around the most regarding this story was in Vegas for a weekend.  We didn't plan on having the crab legs for a market price of $75 but we did plan on yucking it up as much as we could.

This might possibly be the best ""fancy"" restaurant at Mirage.  ""Stack"" doesn't measure up to its sister restaurant, ""Fix"", at Bellagio.  Who wants to pay for $15 fried rice at ""Fin""?  Samba Steakhouse is like comparing Rocky 5 to Texas de Brazil/Fogo de Chao's Rocky 4.        

Seeing as we could've blown the same amount of money going a la carte as Gordon Ramsay Steak, we all opted for the prix fix menu which was reasonable and a good amount of food for $49.99.  I got the lobster bisque after all the raves from other Yelpers and that was flippin fantastic and definitely worth the additional $5.  Since I was in an upgrade kind of mood, I went with the 14 oz grass fed sirloin for an additional $12.  It was grilled perfectly and went well with multiple martinis.  I got the creme brulee for dessert which I couldn't even finish after stuffing myself silly with the terrific bread baskets (bacon bread mmmmmm) between courses.       

Service was excellent and it's the best spot for dining at the Mirage with the whole dome thing up top and plants everywhere.

5533645,2008-03-05,1,Cde8PHRM5c359-dnCUk7KQ,"What's up with all the bad reviews for this place? I adore this place...

First off, they've remodeled and I must say it's rather lovely inside.  But more importantly, the food really is fantastic--well, if you ordered what I always get :)  

I LOVE their starters.  The seared scallops (I have no idea if it's a regular item or seasonal one) are ridiculously good!  They are seared to perfection and burst with flavor.  I've also had their crabcakes, and they are divine. The portion is rather small, but the quality speaks for itself.  OH! AND THE LOBSTER BISQUE!!!  Best I've ever had...the soup itself was savory and loaded with lobster chunks.  To top it off, there's a wonderful pastry shell that tops the soup.  I'm telling you, get the Lobster bisque. You won't be disappointed.  

Their steaks are served a la carte, which get's a bit pricey.  But let it be known that these are HUGE cuts.  I had the ribeye done medium rare and it was delicious!  Perfectly seared on the outside, with a warm, red tender inside.  I couldn't be happier with it.  I don't care about the sides, as I'd rather not waste stomach space, but the garlic mashed potatoes were tasty.  

Now, there is one matter that makes me tempted to knock this joint down a star---their desserts are absolutely atrocious!  I mean it! If you've read any of my other reviews, then you'll know that I'm a dessert fiend and I like my creme brulee....but boy is the creme brulee here total crap!  The dessert comes with three different types of creme brulee--choclate, traditional, and I don't even remember the third.  Man, it's gross. It's super dense and thick.  Stick a spoon down the middle, and it won't budge--it's that dense.  Aside from the rock hard texture, the taste is just off.  It's really terrible.  I can't image why they would serve such crap.  

But I'll be generous tonight and stick to the five stars.  But heed my advice--stay away from the desserts.  

I do hope that they redesign their dessert menu and put some effort into it.  It's just depressing!

Oh, and as for the reviewer who was upset with the $150 kobe steak--I've been to plenty of places that don't list the price.  And they really don't tell you unless you ask.  Heck, I ordered swordfish at another establishment and was never quoted the price (it turned out to be a whopping $45).  Seriously...if you're going to order something that doesn't have the price listed to it, just assume it's gonna cost a truckload of money.  I do, and it serves me well. Or don't be afraid to ask.  I've seen the kobe on their menu, and the price is never listed.  In fact, I've seen this at many restaurants.  I personally, don't think that kobe is worth its price.

Prices (and menu items) were rolled back to how it was 20 years ago. None of us complained! I enjoyed the Surf n Turf for $60 while the 8 oz filet was only $22. The meats were cooked tenderly, salads were delicious (I got the mixed green and my friend the spinach salad) and the clam chowder and red onion soup were both delicious from the sips that I tried. The group was definitely happy with the quality of the food and amazed at the prices. The service was good as well, but not outstanding.

Nevertheless the experience was still enjoyable and the meat was cooked to order.",7961wYcrm-zWEkE7kz0tPg,2,2,4,5b3_2gSLsiD6tXEmaii94w

First off, the service was amazing! Our waiter was super attentive and friendly. Also, their bread basket is amazing! It came with a variety of breads like cranberry and bacon, pretzel, sourdough, sweet & salty, and I think one more but I forgot what it was. The cranberry bacon one and the sweet & salty breads were my favorite. For food, we ended up ordering from their fixed price menu. We got the lobster bisque, which was an additional $5 but so worth it! It was delicious and I loved the flaky pastry crust. We also ordered the french onion soup with was also very tasty :) For the entrée we both ordered the petit filet mignon medium rare. This was delicious as well. The mushrooms and sauce they used was really good although at the end it was starting to get a bit salty for me. For dessert we had the cheesecake and crème brulee. I really enjoyed the crème brulee! Not too soft, not too eggy :) Overall, im really glad we picked this place. good food and good service!",v2Rk5lQWal8ane1Slx5nqw,2,2,4,UYexFB05K7lOJ8fDqoMtvA

With an easy to read, packed with great dishes but expensive menu, this place gets my seal of approval but can be a little intimidating.

Service is always outstanding. Starting from the hostess all the way to our server . The ambiance is nice, however because its located in a very high traffic area of the casino , it can get loud. If you want something quiet try to seat on a table in the back.

Decoration wise, the place doesn't send the vibe of a steak house. With lots of trees and plants surrounding the whole area it feels more of a jungle themed café or even a sushi house. Food quality is great. Not the best steak Ive had here but very good. Their surf and turf is great .cooked just right and if you get a chance order the lobster mashed potatoes. Trust me on this.Also their appetizers are tasty as well. And if you love seafood , get the platter which will be expensive but well worth it.

I can say kokomos is above average, but not one of the Vegas top ones. For the price I usually expect a full on experience which is a combination of food, ambiance, location, etc. 

You MUST try the 16 layer chocolate cake..Be sure to share it because its friggin huge!",G_bJdUPCnL1x6dvRhyHNyw,0,0,4,jYne9s2cCyZzf5RS7cgyJQ

The waiter didn't bother to tell us that the rib eye was going to cost...  $150 (see picture)!!!  The sides were mediocre, the sauteed mushrooms were too salty.  They had a large selection of wine, but like their steak it was also overpriced.

I don't recommend this place.  If you're in Vegas, have a hankering for a great steak, and want to spend some money, you'll get more bang for your buck at Del Frisco's or Ruth's Chris Steak House.

Save your money for the tables.  Pass on this place!",_Hum_JURLFwrAtAnzO2n-A,3,1,1,nIxR8R9UZpHUI2V14nxIjw

The atmosphere is incredibly pleasant... even though we were right in the middle of hotel check-in, near a bar, and in a very busy part of The Mirage - I never felt like I was in anything less than an upscale restaurant.  The service was incredible.  Our server approached our table and greeted us by name (reservations and all) and offered a drink selection.  He recommended the drink special of the day - I wish I could remember what was in it because it was so incredibly light and refreshing.  There was champagne, a splash of sparkling water... and... meh, whatever - it was GOOD.  Everyone at the table shared an order of the shrimp appetizer - shrimp they were not!  These puppies were massive and delicious.  Crispy, spicy, and yummy.  I couldn't get over how tasty the sauce was... and how big the shrimp were.  Our meals were served soon after... I had the veal chop with a side order of asparagus.  I was in love.  It melted in my mouth.  One of the men at my table ordered the sea bass - but asked if they could make a lemon butter caper sauce (not on the menu) and it was not a problem.  He was in heaven with his dinner.  I loved that no matter what we wanted (within reason, I'm sure) the waiter (and chef) were happy to accommodate... special request sauces, special request sides... done and done.  And all amazingly well.  We finished the meal off with a dessert sampler - I can't give a first hand review, but just watching the reactions of everyone else was a clue as to how incredible the dessert was.  There was not one thing I could complain about... in fact, for whatever reason - I dropped my fork on three different occasion.  Three.  The first time was a near miss several times... but as soon as it finally made its dive onto the carpet, our underling server/water boy/bread basket guy was right behind me with a fresh one.  Apparently he continued to keep an eye on my fork blunders because each time I managed to lose it, he was right there with a new one.  Very nice.",nQYP01FewC4UpVG24TTRmw,0,0,4,WG879Qzv7R5bsIzzazLM0w

I choose this place because we both LOVE lobster bisque and after reading the reviews decided to try Kokomo. Lobtser bisque ($18) was AMAZING!  It was so creamy and fulfiling that we could have just stopped there.  
Other yelpers have commented that the portions were not big enough for the cost and suprised that you had to pay extra for your sides..... Im wondering if they have really every been to a fine dinning resturant before.  ONLY cuz if you have ever been to fine dinning here or anywhere else (my personal experience being LV, DC and NY) sides are extra.  
Anyway I thought the postions were about what one would pay.  I ordered the Colorado Lamb Chops ($36).  THREE huge lamb chops cooked perfectly to the med rare that I requested. (I didn't even finish the first one)  
My friend ordered the  Washuguyu Tenderloin Carpaccio ($26). She was still full from the lobter bisque but was determined to finish it cuz it was soo good. 
We split two sides but would have been fine spliting just one cuz the portion are for at least two people.  We got a side of the mac and cheese ( Friend LOVES mac and cheese)  and it was just ok.  I felt I could have done just as good if I would have made it at home myself.  The 2nd side was the Loaded sea salt baked potato.  Yes it was just a baked potatoes but neither one of us could stop eatting it.  Much better than the mac and cheese.  
Overall I would return, especially for the lobster bisque!",Hv_Sk1QTTBgOScage3uiqw,1,1,4,Zl7ZwDd4dGUBjliP1IE24w
