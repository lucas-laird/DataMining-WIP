I have been there several times and had delicous sandwhiches but this time I chose to get an egg white omelet. Probably the best I ever had. I got to choose my ingredients and then I watched the chef cook it. Yum and healthy. highly recommended",Abml_h9Yi8Q1lSAumQMPVQ,3,1,5,jxM_7WcR9QZoTgIWn5sgnQ

The answer is Taste Market & Deli, located on the ground level of The Market LV inside Tivoli Village. I brought my husband here on a Sunday morning specifically to shoot a few rounds of pool in a family-friendly, smoke-free environment, only to find the table in need of repair due to a cue ball malfunction. Luckily, other entertainment options, including a stash of board games and two TVs showing sporting events, were available.

Two friendly ladies working the counter were very helpful by explaining the menu and making suggestions. I tried a cinnamon hot chocolate with espresso that they recommended. I'd order it again, but with an extra shot of espresso. My husband ordered an egg white omelet (cooked to order, but needed a side of toast or something) and I chose to build my own sandwich from a wide variety of toppings. Starting with rye bread, I requested burrata cheese, lettuce, fresh basil, roasted tomato, organic mushrooms, avocado, pesto, and a touch of homemade mayo. For $5.95, this creation easily put any $5 footlong to shame. Every individual ingredient was fresh and of excellent quality. Sandwich breads are baked by Bon Breads. The mushrooms appeared shiitake-less in favor of small pieces of chanterelles and other exotic varieties. Large chunks of avocado were incredibly buttery! I even detected a few large grains of sea salt used as seasoning. A small side of homemade pickles seemed to disappear from my plate while I was distracted by the second half of my sandwich.

Taste is a large space with many tables. The layout, with its colorful, mismatched chairs and staircase in the center of the room, reminds me of Michelle Bernstein's trendy cafe Crumb on Parchment, located in Miami's Design District. Baked goods include croissants (served with homemade pear or tomato jam), coffee cake, and mini fruit pies. I didn't confirm where the pastries are brought in from, but square scones always seem like a Chocolate & Spice signature to me. The market area offers some unique coffees, gourmet condiments, and various items, but doesn't really capture my attention. Beer (PBR) and wine are served on tap, and bottled beers are available in a refrigerated case. Rounding out the selection with a cider would earn bonus points in my book!",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,4,3,4,ESY3i-Xctu_-CkEP8YVTKQ

The menu features sandwiches, salads and soups, the perfect options for a casual lunch. I popped in to have a meeting and wasn't really starving, so I opted for a bowl of chili. It was delicious, so my only complaint is that they should have put more of it in the bowl! (Seriously, the serving was a little on the small side.)

I was surprised there is no WiFi, but perhaps they just want you to focus on eating and partaking in a game or two. It may be the only lunch spot I've seen with a pool table! It also seems like a spot that should have juices, smoothies or some other creative, freshly brewed beverages, but their drink selection is largely bottled. They do have adult beverages though, wine and beer. 

Overall, a very favorable first impression thanks to the whimsical details and obvious commitment to fine ingredients. Make it a lunch date.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,13,11,4,jjsHDugRhGDRBgCKmGma6A
5620502,2013-02-25,1,Opxi_-aCcn6S-dj7JzRE2Q,"Taste Market & Deli is located on the first floor of The Market at Tivoli Village.  The second floor is home to several little boutique shops and the View Wine Bar and Kitchen.  My son and I decided to check it out after school one day since it's on the way home.  A nice open space that calls to mind an arty New York loft, Taste has two pinball machines, a pool table, and a Ms PacMan machine, a plus if there ever was one in my book. Customers have the option to build their own sandwich or salad. The teen chose a chicken sandwich on sourdough. I kept it light with a bowl of tomato bisque and a side of mac n cheese.  The sandwich and the tomato soup came out fairly quickly, but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for the mac n cheese.  Apparently, hot food items are prepared by the View Kitchen upstairs.  After the first ten minutes, our waitress apologized for the wait and said that the kitchen had gotten backed up with orders.  We were the only customers downstairs in Taste, so I assumed the View upstairs was swamped.  After another ten minutes of waiting for a side dish and another apology from the waitress, I was ready to leave.  My son had finished his sandwich and the tomato soup was long gone, so when the food finally arrived, I was underwhelmed by the place, Ms PacMan or not.  The mac n cheese was actually good, made with wheat pasta; my son proceeded to eat half of it, so that's a good sign.  Considering we were the only customers in the place on a Friday at 2:00pm, I'd expect better service from a new place like this.  We may be back, but probably just to play Ms. PacMan.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,3,2,2,SvhrvLra98g1dtRpSNID8Q
