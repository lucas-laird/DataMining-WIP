1436931,2017-09-10,0,jkhEPQovg6JKPzUr43MC_g,"Today was our first time here. Came to watch the Bills' home opener since we couldn't get the game at home. Disappointed with other people's reviews as we had a great time. We sat in the upper dining area. The service was excellent; the bartenders and servers were by constantly to see if we needed anything and were very friendly even though it was busy and they were clearly working hard. The wings were just like home and the 2 for 1 Coor's Lights were a great deal. The free raffle was definitely a perk even though we didn't win anything. We absolutely plan on coming back for another game. One suggestion though would be to fix the speaker on the ceiling as it was noisy and crackling during some loud parts. Overall a great place to watch the game in a relaxed atmosphere with fellow Bills fans, good food and lots of beers!",VaKxykgMnNDlHzxN56ipHw,0,0,5,fX6edM7MnNLnBYUjNe7fUw

The only thing I've had here is their pizza and it was pretty good (I even took some home) but overpriced. Guess I should've went when there was a special or happy hour or something. The waiters are kind of odd as well, although they're friendly and will talk to you about sports (or maybe it was because I was there during a basketball game). Don't be surprised though if they sit at a table and play on their phone in between waiting on tables...guess they really don't have much to do since no one comes here. Not sure how they are still in business.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,0,2,V71uXOkrCUYBhCnjPa1ojg

Super excited there is a bar with my people so close to home! Today was our first visit and they have beef on weck during Bills games. We opted to try the wings and they were legit!  Crispy outside, juicy inside! Labatt drafts were $2 during the game and they did a couple raffles throughout the game in which we won a Coors Light koozie/bottle opener/sunglasses, a Bills hat, and a jersey!  I don't understand the bad reviews either, food was good and not a long wait, Shannon our bartender was great, and it had the City of Good Neighbors feel!  We'll definitely be back!",48Ip5iJtWNvxo9QrdX07Og,0,0,5,UsYEHXecnFl7PBK0EJW1WQ
2401557,2012-12-07,0,jkhEPQovg6JKPzUr43MC_g,I went here the other night with a group of people. The pizza was one of the worst I have ever had. I would rather of had frozen pizza or one of the chain restraunts. The service was also not good. Will not be coming back.,ZjRjknMqRsgXIGu2I3vaCQ,0,0,1,V6n05bF3t8dVR_iRuqksrg

2717172,2008-01-03,4,jkhEPQovg6JKPzUr43MC_g,"Normally when I write these reviews I at least try to give the establishment I'm reviewing the benefit of the doubt.  You know, like, ""Maybe my server was just having a bad day"" or ""Perhaps that was my own pube in the salad"".  By nature I'm not a very critical person.  Well, at least I wasn't until I went to the Town Center Lounge.  

Alright, I'm just going to lay it on the line.  This place pretty much blows donkey balls.  The food was decent although I imagine it's difficult to completely screw up a cheese pizza and a house salad.  It's definitely a sports bar and there are TVs everywhere.  That's especially nice since we were there to watch the UFC fight.  What really sucked about this place was the service and the patrons.  Interestingly enough, most of the patrons on that particular night also seemed to be on staff.  Go figure.  Since I understand that establishments have little control over the clientele, I'm giving the Town Center Lounge two stars based on their shitty, rude, and completely unhelpful service.  I've never had a server actually walk away from me while I was asking a question.",e_uu6m02__fLJIl3_Qmsiw,6,3,2,p1-BIxkivOqOx_aFalMO4w
3368692,2017-10-08,0,jkhEPQovg6JKPzUr43MC_g,"The bartenders and servers are the best in town! By my 3rd trip in, they knew my name and remembered what I drink. There are several sports bars between my house and TCL that are a bit closer, but to me it's worth the drive. Becoming a Bills bar a few years back sealed the deal. The pizza, wings and beef on weck are AMAZING and reasonably priced. Several regulars in the bar that sedum and friendly and will have you feeling like you're at CHEERS. Mike and Meredith are a pleasure behind the bar. A big thumbs up from this gal.",i-f1rChlwo1Em-R5XZiCIQ,0,0,5,jRFJt1NtZPB5gBhiYVP1XQ
3453195,2017-08-04,0,jkhEPQovg6JKPzUr43MC_g,This has to be one of the worst bars in all of Las Vegas.. you have two different companies trying to manage the space... on the bar side the staff does not deliver drinks..... if you want one go get it your self... and hope it's not a shift change .. as they will close out your tab and make you pay for it instead of carrying it over... went I for a pizza and had to use my card 4 times.... wild... the brothers pizza there is equally a mess as well... good luck trying to find staff... actually had to go into the kitchen to place an order and then had to find someone to pay the bill... this is really  a messed up bar... if your local or want to watch the game.. go elsewhere... this place needs to close or get new management.... what a waste of real estate....,k_RAP79mZjpwQw2NMDJrJQ,0,0,1,8Snfv16nSm-OpHCNzpZ--g
4097641,2010-07-19,0,jkhEPQovg6JKPzUr43MC_g,This is another Chicago eatery but what sets this place apart from the rest in Vegas is the breaded steak sandwich made famous in Chicago by Ricobene's this is my sixth time here and I can say this place is going down hill and I will not return. The food is still good but I can see the quality diminishing each time I visit...The Service is so bad if you decide to eat here order it to go the server was nice but dizzy and spends way to much time sitting and talking with other workers and regulars at the bar So in turn you get cold food and if you ask for something you will get it at the end of your meal if you even get it at all....Now for the food... My appetizer was deep fried raviolis they came out cold and half way in the middle of the meal..  The deep dish pizza was good but order in advance because it takes about 45 mins to get... The breaded steak sandwich was cold but not bad for dessert we had the cannoli I liked it my wife said it tasted bitter,k2LA_0qLR8XAYYgvoAZx_g,1,1,2,mcLdfUAlBQgeLX6jukFwTQ

This is the worst bar I have ever been too, I am 40 years old keep in mind. I have stopped in at least 6 times to have a drink while waiting for food. Bartenders are HORRIBLE!!! I could go on about the few horrible experiences I had in detail but why bother. Don't bother going here. Go to timbers or the lodge they are right around the corner from this place. Plus Timbers or The Lodge will give you great service and the bartenders are nice, fun, friendly and great to be around. FORGET THIS PLACE!!!",ESMK1o85LzY7JgCFQzHcZA,1,0,1,s8TclfCozVwwOK9NWkgRqg

Millie and Shannon are the best in the business - the beer is cold, the service is great and the I can honestly say it's the closest thing to Cheers I've ever seen outside of Nick at Nite.
