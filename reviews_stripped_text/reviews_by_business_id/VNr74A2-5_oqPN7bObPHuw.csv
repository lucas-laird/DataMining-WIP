Just another place on my trip to Vegas where I realized that many of the restaurants here are distinctly mediocre to below average especially when you account for what you are paying.  I guess I'm just cheap and should have gone to nicer places although I stopped here out of convenience only.

Well our midnight feasting adventure started with a seating extravaganza from frosty-the-hostess, whom by the way closely resembled the ice queen from  the lion the witch and the wardrobe; and my mother.  

She sat us next to a table of hip-hop rag-a-muffins that were booth-booty dancing to loud music via some mp3 type device and sucking on crab legs.

Although service here was about as cold as the ice-cold Blackjack dealer that took $60 from me in under 10 minutes...  One member of my party ordered a chocolate milkshake at the very beginning, and after ordering our meals a waiter showed up with hot chocolate, we said no one ordered it so he left.  He returned a couple of minutes later with a large glass of chocolate milk.  Much to his chagrin, he was rebuked again.  This is when my starved friend kinda flipped out because she was angry with herself for possibly not speaking clearly.  We kindly calmed her down just in time for an actual Chocolate Shake to arrive.... Pfew!  I would not have wanted to be the waiter that brought out a wrong order for the third time....  Never get between a hungry woman and her food....

Coming here reminded me of when I used to go to Circus circus buffet as a kid, with all the cheesy decorations, and slow, I'm-in-no-hurry vibe. Prices were decent, though still between $10-$15. I split a blueberry pancake platter and an omelet. We weren't allowed to do any substitutions (eg. change the toast that came with our omelet to pancakes even when we were willing to pay an extra charge). Anyway, 2 dishes with more than enough food for 2 people. Came with some crispy hash browns on the side, and the omelets were pretty big. The pancakes came in 3's, along with PLENTY of butter and syrup. My friend's southwest salad looked pretty good, and big too. Our server was this older lady, and she was extremely friendly and liked to joke around with us. But she looked frail to the point that I wanted to help her carry the dishes over.

1893094,2012-05-20,1,VNr74A2-5_oqPN7bObPHuw,"Mediocre and overpriced about covers it, as another reviewer said. 

I had a bad experience coming into Vegas but got to the LVH and needed dinner, so hit the Paradise Cafe- my taxi driver actually recommended it. Upon seeing the prices/selection, I almost left to try the buffet instead, figuring I'd spend about the same amount, but I'm bad with portion control and figured the quality would probably be less, so I stayed.

It wasn't particularly busy, and despite the name and decor had a distinctly diner-esque feel to it, for some reason. They had a seafood special going on, so I opted for the $7 ceviche appetizer and was decently surprised at the portion- though more tortilla chips could have been served with it. Glass contained about 2 cups, mixed shrimp and scallops, and was alright. It would have been more appropriate served with lime slices rather than lemon, but the taste wasn't bad and the fish was clearly fresh. I know it's all about presentation, but eating the ceviche out of a wine glass and attempting to spoon it onto tortilla chips is a clumsy affair and would have been better suited to a lower stemmed bowl of some sort. 
Not sure why I ordered the chicken burrito for my entree- I can have Mexican food at home, right? But I was in a cheese-craving mood and didn't like the idea of spending $10 on a plate of nachos (though maybe that would have been a better choice), so I went with the overpriced burrito plate. At the very least it is a large quantity of food. Beans were slightly off and rice was overly wet and bland, and the burrito itself, while large and stuffed with chicken, wasn't particularly flavorful. Used up a lot of the pico, salsa, sour cream, and guac just trying to eat about half of it without simply choking down shredded chicken. 

In any case, the staff were very polite though not very present/available. In my case, that was a good thing, because I was lingering there for just over an hour with my food and a glass of wine, waiting for my friend to arrive as our rooms were in his name. That being said, it was bizarre to have so many other servers come by so frequently but never see my own- and never have anyone offer to fill my water glass. Just struck me as bizarre.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,0,2,HuEUbgp_vz-5Cp16L6csLg

Corned Beef Hash with Scrambled Eggs, Potatoes, Wheat Toast (roughly $10 for the meal). MMMMMMmmmmMmmmM. You can't get it any better than that. I thought the food was great! Didn't taste like barf or anything. It actually tasted like breakfast. I didn't wait too long for my food either, I was able to eat and bounce within half an hour.

Our buffalo wings (medium) was NOT spicy at all in any way, it was salty, extremely extremely salty. I had to take a gulp of water for each bite I took. Frozen hot wings would have been a million times better.  
Our fish tacos were okay, except that the fish in it was tiny. You can see that it was cut smaller, so the fish in it was mostly just the crispy outside, and not much actual fish. (it comes 3 to an order)
Our meatloaf dish, was once again, overly salted. We could barely eat it, and ended up leaving the whole dish pretty much untouched. 
Our salad was decent, but it's hard to mess up on a salad.

Now for the more verbose version. I was staying at the LVH and decided to drop by here for dinner. The matzo ball soup was decent if not all that notable. I ordered the Thai chicken salad. Sadly, it was mostly lettuce flecked with cilantro and drowned in dressing. The chicken itself wasn't bad, but it wasn't sufficient to break up the monotony of the greens without a better mix of vegetables to support. It just feels like a really bad recipe and that can be incredibly difficult to salvage.

The next day, I meet up with a friend of mine. She suggests dropping by here for lunch. One mediocre meal is forgivable enough, so I go back with an open mind. This time, I tried the croissant trio. Tuna salad, chicken salad, shrimp salad. I start on the tuna salad and it is quite fine. Nothing out of this world, but tasty enough that I had no regrets. The chicken salad was next. It was acceptable, although not as good as the tuna salad. This is in part because I like tuna salad more and in part because the chicken salad used larger chunks of chicken that felt a bit off. I took one bite of the shrimp salad and promptly decided that my meal was finished. Didn't need any more. Didn't want any more. Please remove this shrimp salad croissant. It is not my friend. It does not want to hang out in my stomach. I felt just fine and knew that not eating that shrimp salad was probably the best thing I could do all day to continue feeling just fine.

The servers were really pretty nice. I was seated without delay, a refill came just as my glass hit empty, and I did enjoy the atmosphere of the place. Perhaps they could take out the kitchen and just have food catered from somewhere else. That's not really what you want to hear about a restaurant, but hey.

Really does give you the feeling like your in paradise, beach and waterfall painted on the wall, fake tropical trees and plants, bright and cool, lots of fans. All that was missing was a pool, light rain, and the sand. 

Down to the food, we all had their land and sea combination specials for around $16-19. Where you choose the land (prime rib, rib eye, or a third choice) and the sea (shrimp, lobster, or crab legs). The crab legs and prime rib were both thick pieces, the plates were huge i don't any of us finished more than half. Don't suggest the shrimp route unless you really want shrimp, for a around a dollar more you get maybe 6 crab legs instead of 3-6 grilled shrimps.

We arrived here on a Sunday morning at about 11 a.m. just before breakfast ended. 

The limited menu doesn't offer much. Basically you have: omelets, fruit, pancakes and a few unhealthy breakfast staples. Everything is way over-priced. A side of 3 small sausage links for $4.50? Seriously? The non-alcoholic beverages were the cheapest thing and the only item I felt was worth the price tag. I ordered the Ranchero Huevos and was presented with stale corn tortillas, dog food meat, undercooked black beans and some lettuce. It was not anything like other RH dishes at authentic Mexican restaurants. I wasn't expecting true authenticity but at least something palatable. I picked at it for a minute and decided to drink my breakfast instead. 

One friend ordered buttermilk pancakes with a side of sausage. She only ate about half of the pancakes before tiring of them. My other friend ordered an omelet with 2-extra add-ins (at $1.80 a pop) and finished most of the hash browns and about half of the omelet. She said the omelets she makes are better. 

Aside from the less-than-stellar food, the service is severely lacking. When we sat down, no one was seated around us. We ordered our food and by the time our non-alcoholic drinks had arrived there were 3 tables around us enjoying their hot food.

This was especially strange because we literally had 4 people serving us. We had someone taking our drinks, someone getting us mimosas, someone taking our order and two people deliver our order. We didn't actually know who our server was to be honest. Had we known we may have complained about the quality, the tardiness of our food or the fact that we were never offered refills on our ""bottomless"" beverages.

Then to top it all off, our bill was enormous for the little bit of food we ordered. It was the most we had paid for food all weekend. $98 for three meals. That's an expensive cafe breakfast.

1. Unprofessional and apathetic staff: When the hostesses are ready to stop their personal conversation to grace me with their acknowledgement, I was seated at the bar and given a ""To Go"" menu which states that an automatic 18% gratuity would be added to any To Go orders.  *Keep this in mind if you are in the habit of adding a tip so you don't end up double-tipping them!  

While waiting for my to-go food, I had the misfortune of having to witness one of the waitresses approach the hostesses with complete attitude and yelled, ""Can I get a party?  I been off break for 15-minutes and you ain't seated anybody in my section.  You seatin' a party here and there, but I ain't got no party, so can I get a party?""  She then goes over to another waitress and begins talking about the hostesses to this other waitress, while the hostesses talked smack about the waitress who chewed them out!

Salmon & Rice (dinner) -Not bad, probably the best thing I ate on the menu.
Fish Tacos -Tolerable
Thai Chicken Salad -Very overdressed and not very good
Bacon and Cheese Omelet (breakfast) -Omelet was GREASY and inedible!  Hash browns completely flavorless.  I managed to choke down the sourdough toast which was good.

I'm going to mail in the comment card about this experience. Hopefully they fire those peeps from the staff. They could actually hurt business.",p6nBKyT9Y_pFJ1WxVEowwA,0,0,1,ikqJGSiYXIkuUtRWtijldA

Neither of which were good experiences, so I wouldn't recommend anyone coming here, unless you're in a pinch and just needed food in a hurry, or nothing else is open.  Both food and service was below average.

For food, I had the California Turkey Burger at night, and the Southwest Chicken Salad during the day.  The turkey burger tasted off.  The meat has a strange taste, unlike other turkey burgers i've had.  The avocado tasted very stale and lacking.  The Southwest Chicken Salad was OK if you tell them to go very light on the sauce, so that they don't drown it.

The service was very slow.  They weren't rude or anything, but just took a very long time to get anything around here, after asking for things.",N3CjnVNnIb1djqXPjhI4uw,0,0,2,av13jE5Nf5ptv48SOJs4uA

Heck the selection there is large and food is much better than this sh#t hole.  Service here is crap, except for one waiter who stepped in when everyone else walked by us, giving us the ""someone will be right with you.""  Yeah right, bullshit.  The egg is soggy...I don't get how the can't scramble an egg right.  And the ham was just bland.  I can be quite lenient when it comes to what I eat compared to others, heck I enjoy eating at Denny's unlike some of my friends.   But this stuffy at Paradise Cafe was just horrible.  Tried some of my friends french fries: bleeh.",1JmMSXP9_cmLOJ76b2tdDQ,0,0,1,vJb_wFv1UFvNrMUKSeDBcw

After having a bad experience, I looked online and found that they had just reopened as Sid's on 12/17/14.  We attempted breakfast here.  Attempted!!!  We had never stayed at the Westgate hotel before and did not know where to have breakfast so we called down to the guest relations dept. who told us that ""Sid's"" was open for breakfast.  We gave it a shot.  It was not very busy for a Saturday morning and they sat us right away.  After being seated we looked at the menu that was highly overpriced but thought, ""oh well, we are already here"".  After waiting AT LEAST 5 minutes for our waiter (again, they were not that busy), he came over and we gave him our entire order because we had plenty of time to review the menu.  Never brought water or anything to the table.  I ordered a coffee and my husband ordered a hot tea.  We waited at least 5 more minutes or more when a different woman came over and asked if we had ordered drinks.  We said ""yes, with our waiter"".  She barked at us ""what did you order!"".  So we told her.  I was a little taken back by the fact that she was abrupt and borderline rude about it.  But again....I thought, we are already here and I don't know that there are any other restaurants on site for breakfast, other than the buffet. The woman at the next table asked one of the hostesses if her waitress went upstairs, she was serious and was holding her head as though she had been sitting there a while.  Another 5 min or so and this rude woman comes back with a coffee and orange juice and says ""what did you order again?""  At this point I was completely agitated.  My husband and I looked at each other and I said...""no, we didn't order orange juice and we are not staying"".  We started to get up to leave and the woman says ""well didn't you already order you food??"".  I said ""yes, but its not like we will get it anytime soon or it will be correct"".  COMPLETELY unprofessional.  Especially for a place charging what they were and APPEARING to be upscale.  I told my husband, if I wanted to pay $6 for a bagel and be insulted, I would go to McDonalds.  We ended up going around the corner to the wine bar and getting some pastries and fruit.  The gals running the line there were very efficient.  Maybe they should hire some of them over at Sid's!!!",5WfazfTVJBRIWJWGCZpE5A,0,0,1,xvoFW7qBlOEWfdBw7XwrBQ
