700267,2014-12-16,1,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"I went to this place the other day because I love Taiwanese food. I really love beef noodle soup! It's one of my favorites. I have searched far and wide going to various restaurants. 

So, my friends and I went and ordered green onion pancake, beef noodle soup, and green onion pancake with beef. I liked the green onion pancake. It was really delicious and flakey. I did like the one from Easy Earthen in California better, but this is pretty good for Vegas. 

The beef noodle soup was amazing! I think it might just be my favorite. The beef is so tender and soft. I love the broth. It was very flavorful, and wasn't watered down. I would say this is best beef noodle soup I have ever had. 

Service was a little slow here. It might be because the set up is  little difficult to see people because of the huge walls between each booth. I guess they didn't want to spend money remodeling the place. 

The only downside is that they don't have shanghai dumplings. I was so disappointed. :(",yP9UmCxs1PSqljLfpR9R5g,3,1,4,ooDm4CcTczaw2zSUdrKqCQ

1380570,2014-12-15,6,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"Was at dinner the other day with my friend and she mentioned how a new taiwanese place opened. She said the name was something kitchen... and it reminded me of Liang's Kitchen in San Jose when i went up there in 2011. Then she looked it up, and confirmed it was Liang's Kitchen. My face with from :o to *_* Lol ! Was so excited for the next few days (Thurs to Sun... so 3 days) to go try it out ! I remembered the location i went to was super busy, their beef noodle soup was amazing, served hot in a metal bowl. Their noodles were hand-made, varying size showing it was not machine made. Been wanting to go back since every time i go up to the Bay but never had the chance !

So it opened in Vegas... Finally a new Taiwanese place ! and its one i recognize ! w00t ! It sits on the north end of the complex, on the NE corner of Spring Mountain and Arville, replacing what used to be called Hot Feel. Minimal renovations were done after the take over of the unit with some reorganization of some tables. 

The menu and ordering paper is about the same, if not the same as other locations. Price wise, i dont remember. Came to try this place with a few friends for dinner. We had initially ordered a few things. 1 Beef Roll, 1 Green Onion Pancake, and 2 Large Beef Tendon Noodle Soup (later i realized the L/R next to the name was large and regular NOODLES, not the size of the order OOPS hahaha o well)

Beef Roll and Green onion pancake came out first

Green Onion Pancake - normal green onion pancake but fried? (is that the right term). The exterior was crispy, interior was soft and hot ! Not a fan of the fried version after a previous experience at another restaurant, but this was really good ! Especially since it was fresh and HOT ! :D i liked it 

Beef Roll - Essentially a green onion pancake wrap with braised beef, cilantro, and hoisin sauce. Not as hot as i had expected in comparison to the green onion pancake. I had ate the green onion pancake first so i thought this was going to be as hot. Overall, not bad. Not too sweet and overpowering by the sauce. Fairly nice balance. We had ordered this another time after and crispy exterior on the 2nd order was flaking off. Looked a bit ugly. XD (being called high maintenance for stating this... T_T)

Beef Tendon Noodle Soup - We had ordered 2 with large noodles. 1 came out first before the other. The first order, as large as i had remembered. Lots of noodles, in a large metal bowl. Lots of preserved veggies and stuff on top. 2nd one, not so much... Amount of noodles was probably 1/2 of the first order. Inconsistency? Maybe. Didn't matter too much since we were sharing so the noodles were fairly split anyway, so not so bad overall, but still, a bit weird to have varying amounts on the same table. Flavor wise, pretty good ! Large noodles were uneven (lol as expected of handmade) and al dente ! The noodles were actually a LOT larger and wider than i had expected (to be honest, i dont remember how it was in San Jose). In a small sharing bowl, putting like 3 strands of noodles fills it up. Thats how big the noodles were. Beef was tender. Tendon was soft. Flavor overall was nice. A little sour kick (from the preserved vegetables probably). Next time, i wanna try the regular noodles. Memory is failing me XD

Shanghai? style wonton - friend wanted to order this. Small wontons (maybe 10-15 in an order) in a seaweed soup broth Nothing too special. So recognizable amount of shrimp in the wonton (not sure if shanghai style has shrimp? HK style certainly does). Wasn't a favorite but at least we've tried it? Lol

Servers tend to speak to you in mandarin (3 out of the 5 of us spoke cantonese. 1 of the 2 mandarin speakers didnt pay attention). yeah we fail rofl. Overall, not too bad. 

Would love to come back to try other things. I believe they have lunch specials as well. Prefer to have had them open in a different location but oh well.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,11,12,4,5KBD1TBi-NNThw-EjtSQ2w

The a-choy vegetables (also frequently recommended) are good, consider them with the dish of your choice, or dine in for a better experience.

I actually tried to have the fried onion noodle dish a few times- once, I called in for takeout and was helped by a woman who didn't speak much english and insisted that they no longer had that dish on the menu. I came in another time, couldn't find it on the menu, and opted for an unmemorable beef-noodle dish. This final visit, I was at last able to try it- but the noodles were overcooked and clumped, the onions were minimal, and the egg was over.

The main entrance to the plaza is on spring mountain road, and it's located in the Arville Square Plaza. The restaurant sits way back in the plaza, perpendicular to most of the other stores. We ordered 4 individual dishes and an appetizer: beef noodle soup, beef tendon noodle soup, pork chop rice bento, pork chop noodle soup, and wonton in chili oil.  Everyone was happy with their order, but the only thing I'd recommend is asking the cook to separate the pork chop from the soup to prevent sogginess. The portions were decently sized (I couldn't finish my bowl of noodles), and the staff is really nice. I asked for extra small side veggies that came with some of our dishes and the staff had no problem giving us more.

Every month a handful dishes hang on your tongue reminding you of how great they were while inviting, downright pleading you to come back. Liang's Kitchen has one of these dishes, their Fried Onion Noodles. These noodles a coated in onion & garlic oil, placed under an over-easy egg, and topped with pan several small slices of pan-fried onions. I order it with a second egg and add a little of their chili paste, resulting in what some have called perfection. 

I also usually get the Snow Vegetable & Noodle Soup w/ Pork Soup Broth. The broth has a wonderful flavor from the pork bones, but still drinks lite. Additionally, I've enjoyed the Beef Roll, Scallion Pancake, as well as the A-Choy. The prices make it very easy to order more food than you can eat in one sitting...typically resulting in a nice lunch the day after.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,13,10,4,QScq5neQUfB8qA0ekwHnmA

2619323,2015-03-23,10,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"There used to be a little Taiwanese/Chinese noodle spot we used to eat at once a week when we lived in Irvine, CA. One day that noodle spot closed down its doors for unforeseen reasons. We were so upset about it. One day that noodle spot decided to opens its doors again but in Vegas!!! So stoked! And it's yummy like we remember it. What makes them special is their freshly hand pulled wide noodles. Perfection! 

Here's what we always order: 

Beef noodle soup (make sure to get it with the fresh wide hand pulled noodles) $8.25 - This location's was a little different than the California's version; I remember having the most tender beef cubes, however, this time around the meat was much chewier. The best parts of this dish is always the unique, thick noodle sheets, rich broth, and divine pickled vegetables. I always insist that they bring extra pickled vegetables for me to add to my soup. It has such an explosive flavor combination with the bold and beefy soup broth and somewhat welcoming sweet notes. This dish is a classic and a perfect start to get your foot in the door at Liang's. Flavor rating 5/5

Fried Onion Oil Noodles (get this with the thin handmade noodles) $7.25 - Oh the simple pleasures! This comes with a perfectly fried egg on top, you'll want to break that yummy egg and let it run down into the noodles and coat everything. Don't get me wrong, It's an extremely simple dish; just noodles, fried onions in oil and a glorious fried egg - but something about the fried onion aroma just bumps the noodles up a few comforting notches. Truly a fat Asian kid's/poor man's comfort food. Flavor rating: 5/5

Green Onion Pancake $5.25 - If you didn't know, this is like the french fries of Taiwanese/ Chinese cuisine. They are completely dunk-able as well. The right way to do it, is to enjoy these crispy oily delights with your beef noodle soup or even the fried onion oil noodles. However you want to enjoy them together is up to you, whether it's dunking away or munching on it after each bite of noodles. They are meant to be eaten together. This is as ingenious as dipping your biggie fries into a Wendy's frosty. Mind blown? Have fun with the experience! Flavor rating: 5/5

Super PRO TIP: Don't sleep on that table-side chili oil. It makes these dishes sing. So perfect in the beef noodle soup and the onion oil noodles.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,14,11,5,EYB4Byz-gXRPap2c4Ztckg

We sat down at a table where I am facing the big screen that was showing Tawainese Karoke music videos while Earl sat facing the tv screen that was showing the basketball game.  Ambience: CHECK.

The staff handed us three types of menu, the food menu with some pictures without prices, the menu list with the price, and another beverage menu with the different smoothies, etc.  Earl and I chose the thin noodles with fried onions, topped with a fried egg, and also the beef tendon soup with the fat noodles.  The first was delicious.  It was simple, yet, so satisfying.  We got the essence of the homemade noodles.  The second was meh.  I had better.

I woke up at 3 am with TERRIBLE stomach cramps, and crawled to the bathroom where I proceeded to shit and vomit simultaneously, while crying.  Worst food poisoning ever.  I would give this restaurant negative stars if I could and I think the health inspector should shut them down.****

Let me start off by saying that I am Chinese.  Many times I read reviews that complain about poor service at Chinese restaurants and I usually write it off because I have a different expectation of service at Chinese restaurants than at Western ones.  

However, the horrible, terrible no good service here has managed to underwhelm even my super low standards for service at Chinese restaurants.  

We weren't greeted by anyone when we walked in.  After the lady waved us to the table, I had to wave to get her to bring us menus after waiting 5 mins. 

When we finally got a chance to order,  they were out. of. every. appetizer.  Literally every single one.  I tried to order a soy milk and when they said that was out,  I asked for a milk tea.  They didn't have that either.  

After we finished our noodles we asked about the 2 other dishes that we had ordered and wanted to cancel them as we had already finished our food. Suddenly they both appeared at once,  which leads me to believe they had been ready and just sitting out for a while. 

We did not have one single interaction with an employee without having to wave them down.  

The food was all under seasoned and needed salt, especially the onion oil noodles and the green onion pancake. 

This chain has restaurants that have closed all over LA so I was excited to find one here in Vegas, cuz I love the dry tomato pork noodle.  But sadly,  I can see why this chain isn't doing well,  and I cannot recommend it to anyone.  Unless you enjoy a terrible dining experience that will raise your blood pressure and test the depths of your patience, don't eat here.",7WbsfO11WNmbSgfmpgaw-Q,0,0,1,PeiPrQysWll3lZv4Yz-t4g

4733677,2015-10-26,0,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,Omg this place is soooooo goooood!!!! Must try the noodle with fried eggs. The Taiwanese sausage and stewed eggs it delicious as well. I will definitely come back again.,W4lvO-c34ph3dnJi40_jBw,1,1,5,TWzSC9n1Lc0zCEa_oYGpmA
5066897,2015-08-21,2,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,It was late Frifay night and we wanted soup but wanted to try something different. That's when I looked up Taiwanese on Yelp and Liangs seemed to be the obvious choice. We came in around 9 pm and it was dead. I wanted to try some of their famous hand pulled noodles but they were out of the wide noodles. Bummer. Regular noodles it is. We also ordered the beef roll. The broth itself didn't do anything for me. I did enjoy the texture of the noodles and you could tell they were freshly made but the beef was so tough and inedible. It almost didn't even seem like beef. The beef pancake was good but it needed something else to brighten up the flavor. Overall this meal was a huge letdown and I didn't even finish half my soup and I was starving. Liangs is definitely not for me.,r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,1,1,1,R11tSBpvLk4cr8P9LbBJCw
5307731,2015-02-25,3,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"Taiwanese franchises do it right. Liang Mama does it right too, for the most part. It's clean, stylish, and the service is good. 

Mom and I ordered appetizers: cucumber, tofu (hot and cold). The restaurant provided a small dish of spicy pickled vegetables. We also order garlic stir fried vegetables, beef noodle soup, and ""snow vegetable"" (mustard leaf) noodle soup with handmade noodles. I loved the texture of the noodles.

I ordered the beef scallion wrap for my better half to eat when we got home. He seemed happy!

I was pleased with everything but my mom's beef noodle soup, which was too sweet. The location is a little weird as well, but maybe it'll bring some life into the area. 

I will definitely come back here!",6qTJVWJ9RmVuoHi1CNcb_g,3,3,4,1RiYU0Ol241ydFsx7QMDtw
5335624,2015-11-15,1,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"Flavor is not there, the pictures look amazing but that's about it. I had the egg noodles with fried egg it was ok and super oily. My husband had the ox tail stew and it was so tough not only that but it was sweet. Not a good combination for stew. :(( super sad was really looking forward to this place after I saw the pictures.",bat2eZJOBqFkV6muIOhWpA,1,0,1,XYW6ua2PWOC8_EbvVYgDTg
5607389,2016-01-13,0,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"Good solid Chinese (Taiwanese) cuisine.  We ordered the fish head hot pot and it was filled with all kinds of tasty treats. The only item in the pot we did not care for was the tofu.  It was grey, spongy and bland.  We ended up picking it out of the pot.  The rest of the pot was delicious. It was more food than we expected. 

We also ordered the beef noodle soup which was fantastic and authentic. The noodles were made in house, the beef was tender and the broth was full of flavor.  

We stayed away from the specialty dishes on this trip but will definitely try the fried onion noodles and the green onion pancakes next time we visit.  

The decor is a bit odd with model airplanes hanging from the ceiling, these funky round booths that are bright red, Chinese videos playing on a huge screen and this funky bar filled with bottles.  Although it was odd, it was very clean and well kept.  

We were a bit annoyed that they charged us for white rice when we ordered three dishes with one of them being $30.00!   Who charges for rice when you are ordering multiple main dishes???

This place should be on your radar if you are looking for Taiwanese food.  Just be leery of ordering white rice with your dishes......,,",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,0,0,4,QHfJwXmmMHNSiL2OuBA87w
5734949,2014-12-26,1,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"Went here on two different occasions. 

Mainly came for their beef rolls and the onion pancakes. They're decent but nothing to be wowed at. 

Service was mediocre on the first visit but the second visit was just terrible, aha. Couldn't even verify correct order or not because they don't put table numbers on their order forms so there's nothing to reference to. (We had a discrepancy with something we ordered and they thought we ordered something else so we wanted order form to verify.)

Service is slow so you gotta wave your hands around to get ahold of someone. Seems to be the case whether they have a lot of customers or if we're the only ones. 

Found a piece of plastic in my soup with the seaweed. Sighs. And the seaweed soup seemed crunchy/had that sandy texture like I'm eating sand or something. My friend has already said she won't be coming back. 

Really wanted it to be better but yeah... First visit was definitely better than the second in terms of overall experience.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,3,1,2,_rIGDslpzPB1mB3FYBV1qw
5816994,2015-05-26,0,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"Considering there are Liang's Kitchens all over Los Angeles I was expecting a lot more from this one in Vegas. The pork chop over rice I ordered was magically delicious, the breaded pork chop was tasty and not overly breaded or greasy. The pickled veggies, soy sauce egg, and minced pork that came with it were perfect in every way. 

That's about where the fun ended. The fried onion noodles everyone raves about here was bland and boring. The dumplings we ordered I thought was a complete fail. The filling was so overpowered with white pepper that's pretty much all you could taste. Service was pretty poor considering we were 1 of 2 tables in the entire place for lunch. Drinks were never refilled and there fountain sodas tasted horrendous as they probably haven't cleaned out the lines in years or ever. This place is by no means terrible, just considering all the competition they're facing around I would just move on to somewhere else.",w-fkht6rk_MszTx6g9zqXg,1,0,3,DPnStQvS1djIm7_qF8etTw
5918609,2014-12-10,14,TwVFGd4kan9K6ptwGaZdOQ,"Not all that long ago this restaurant used to be called Hot Feel, but it shuttered its doors after not even a year in business serving delicious lamb skewers and spicy boiled crawfish.  So when I heard my friend said that there is a new restaurant there with a logo of a lady as part of the signage, my first thought was that it could be China Mama's second location.  But obviously that's not the correct guess.  

Liang's Kitchen ???? (literal translation is Liang Mama's House), with the logo of the founder/matriarch of the restaurant incorporated into the signage (now in her 80s), is a Taiwanese comfort food restaurant chain from California and New York.  With locations in many of the Cali cities that I have previously lived or worked at before my move to Sin City.  So it was a surprise and reality check to see some of the cities listed (Cupertino, Fremont, Milpitas).  But I have been out here a relatively long time and those locations could have opened after I had already settled here.

The interior of this Liang's Kitchen still retained the majority of the interior design concepts custom built for the previous restaurant entity. albeit with small but noticeable additions.  The inclusion and prominent display of vintage Flying Tigers* aviator jackets (very very cool and most people will likely not know anything about its history) high up on the wall with lighting to draw the attention of anyone bothering to quickly survey the restaurant.  Plus there are WWII and Vietnam War era model fighter planes delicately hung from the ceiling in sortie formation (neato!).  

* 1st American Volunteer Group of the Chinese Air Force in 1941-1942, nicknamed the Flying Tigers, was composed of pilots from the United States Army Air Corps, Navy, and Marine Corps. (Copy & Paste excerpt from Wiki)  

The menu is extensive and following recent Chinese restaurant menu design practices, especially from abroad, looks like a sales catalog with professionally shoot images of some of the menu items, with alternating pages of straight up advertising.  It looks good, but it also has one very annoying attribute or lack thereof, which is the absence of any menu prices.  [Insert comment about if you have to ask about the price, you can't afford it. -Smirk face-]  I know from the restauranteur's perspective it makes sense and saves money in the long run, since they don't have to reprint the menu or have those tacky stickers every time there is a revision to menu pricing.  There is a separate menu sheet that does have the menu items and pricing, but no pictures.  So if you have the patience for it, you can practice cross referencing the main menu with the supplemental menu and other printouts.  Happy. Happy. Joy. Joy!

Food wise, I really liked the Beef and Tendon Soup Noodle that I ordered.  It is definitely ranked in the top two on my list for this item in Las Vegas.  The noodles are the thick chewy handmade variety from Northern China. The beef tendon was cooked long enough so that it is soft and very enjoyable to eat.  The broth is flavorful without being greasy.  The Lamb skewers was good, but I thought it was a bit pricey.  Their lunch box items has a good variety of pickled vegetables and 1 entire soy sauced egg along with rice and whatever protein you selected (I ordered the Taiwanese fried port cutlet for my friend, she ate everything and liked it except for the pork - too greasy).

Service was good.  However, being a new restaurant with new staff, they are still not completely familiar with the pages and pages of menu items.  But as far as refilling drinks, being friendly, it was good.

I will definitely be back to explore more of their menu.  However, considering the dreary weather, I may not get past their noodles section until late February.

4 stars! And best of luck to the latest Taiwanese restaurant to open in Las Vegas.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,27,23,4,92U7a9oPudctqrJEkWzyWw
