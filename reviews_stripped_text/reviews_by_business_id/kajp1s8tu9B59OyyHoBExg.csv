I've gotten the t bone steak and ny strip neither of them were seasoned salt pepper not hard. It was funny my bf and I both got ny strips medium rare his came out perfect and mine was medium like come on you know both steaks are going to the same table how do you mess that up. Chicken strips you only get 4 pieces they give you two carrots and one celery on top of a wilted piece of lettuce. If it looks old why even put it on a plate. Chicken rigatoni was dry came with a ramekin of Parmesan cheese and two slices of garlic bread just made it more dry lol. Seriously yer cooks are a joke. The pulled pork fries was what I ended up with tonight after seeing the pic on here but mine looked nothing like it. In the pic it looks like there's a liquid nacho cheese and green onions which I got neither of just really dry burnt pulled pork tasted like they threw it on the flat top to heat it up and forgot about it it's just not worth it and portion was really small for the price.

Our server, Jesse, took our orders.  My mother ordered the Country-style smoked salmon with over easy eggs.  When our food arrived, the waitress gave her pancakes, scrambled eggs and Scottish bangers.  When she questioned the waitress, Jesse insisted she ordered the country fried steak, which was also not what she brought so she offered to ""change it out"".  Not wanting to disrupt our plans for the day, my mother just said she'd eat what she was brought.  We were all pretty confused and through breakfast we realized the waitress had to have known she messed up, but blamed my mom instead of taking responsibility.  So a memeber of our party took it up with the manager, Tony.  Tony (a female) raised her voice and said, ""well she ate it didn't she?!""  Which we heard from the table.  The manager was unapologetic and very rude.  

I was very upset with the attitude we were given and decided to call.  Unfortunately, Tony picked up my call.  When I asked to speak to her boss she gave me his name and hung up on me.  I called again, this time asking for Brad Jackson.  He was apologetic and offered a $20 comp at any of their restaurants.  I appreciate the gesture, but I wasn't complaining for free food, I just never want to run into this problem again.  He said he spoke to her, but who knows if anything was done to correct her bad attitude and the waitress' inability to accept responsibility.",9aYV8WvHYp2_PjVdhvkcMA,0,1,1,F_FoyRf7srm2dlNgw2PFGg

Everyone in the restaurant did not eat the rice. Oxtail soup had absolutely no taste whatsoever, it tasted like just water. No flavor at all. Another, so bad.

Think Denny's meets a cute cafe with copper themes. It's almost like you are escaping from the casino life for a bit. No keno or TVs around. Just some lite music playing in the background. 

Located next to the sportsbook, table games, and poker room. We went on father's day morning and it was busy by 8:30am. The staff seemed to handle it well. When we got to our table we noticed the restaurant was about 3 times bigger in the back. Looks deceiving from the outside. 

We started with a large cinnamon roll. It was like a huge slice of cake about 5 inches thick. The frosting was on point. Between 3 adults we ate a little more than half. The waitress jokingly warned us about the size and said she wouldn't allow us to order another until we finished the first one. She was right. 

The menu offers a bit of everything with a special selection of Hawaiian dishes. I recently watched an episode of delicious destinations and Andrew Zimmern mentioned a place in downtown Vegas with oxtail soup served after 11pm at a cafe. I noticed they offered oxtail soup here and the reviews were great. The soup is about $15. Large serving of soup with a side of white rice. Meat was so tender. I definitely recommend the oxtail soup. 

My kids went with pancakes and chocolate chip pancakes. The pancakes are large. It's best to order a la carte for the little ones. My wife and mother in law went with traditional breakfasts. They enjoyed them. 

Service was okay but could use slight improvement. I like that they leave a coffee kettle at your table but that keeps them from checking back on the table. I asked for water several times after having to flag someone down but never received it. I know we were in a desert, but I'm sure there was no water shortage at the hotel. 

Overall, good food and quality for the price. Give them a try. Especially the cinnamon roll and oxtail soup.",5mog-DEw97elBQb9NQjisg,31,30,4,ZXeUs_-AdZzp8mMVgzkV7w

I had a taste of the hamburger and fries, and the patty was had a char-broiled taste to it, or maybe it was just burned, but I liked it a little better than the Courtyard Café version, but I felt the fries were too bland, just like before.

When we were handed our menus, this guy named Jose I believe asked us for our drink order and told us our server would be right over. We got our drinks and then this young man named Juan asked us if we had any questions about the menu and that he would be our server for the night. I couldn't help but notice that there were only two servers in such a frantic night. Even my friends that are from out of town asked me what was going on. To our amusement our food came out in a timely manner and even though we could see the place packed, our server was running back and forth like there was no tomorrow, but he was always attentive of us and surprisingly never lost his cool.

On the last night got together decided wanted just eat at The Orleans make it easy. It been while since dine at the coffee shop or can I still it the coffee shop for the hotel?? Anyway living in Vegas for long time remember this spot always being the coffee shop or 24/7 cafe. It gone through changes with the menu and just recently or not that long ago changed the whole look for the dining room. It one big open area rather then couple different areas. It lot more lighted with the open area and overall like the look much better then any of the previous layouts.

My friend was telling me that section in the menu that serves local food ""808"" style. I don't ever recall that being on the menu. He telling me it the same for the most part at The California Hotel. The four items are Oxtail Soup. Local Moco, Breakfast Plate, and Plate Lunch (Kalibi or Chicken Katsu). I ordered the Local Moco and my friend ordered the Oxtail Soup. The Loco Moco honest was horrible. First off if going call something Loco Moco it should all be on top of one another. Each item from hamburger, eggs, and rice all separated. The gravy was ok. The other thing that made me dislike it more is looking at the Oxtail Soup. NOW that was winnah!!! It looked good. I tried the broth that was on point!! It had three nice big pieces of Oxtail. My boy telling me taste just like eating it at the California Hotel. Lesson learned next time going for Oxtail soup. I also ordered the chicken and sausage gumbo. Thank you Yelp and Yelpers for the awesome photos. It was the only reason decided order it. It tasted as good as the pics!! It was nice big bowl. Nice hearty with pieces of chicken and sausage. Not saying it the best gumbo in Vegas. The value and taste good. I could have two or three bowls of gumbo be completely satisfied.

After birthday girl's movie we planned on lunch. I'd say the bright atmosphere and instrument chandeliers sort of invited us over. Cool thing is birthday girl was easy going with a short notice change in lunch plans.

For the ambience, service, location, and food presentation their menu pricing is about right. I suggest to share a carafe of wine. If you're allergic to avocado, make sure you ask to omit it. Rach had chicken; I had salmon. Note that the salmon doesn't advertise avocado within the menu item name. Happy joy lucky for you avocado fans!

Appreciated that we sort of had two servers, and checking in on us throughout our meal. Thought however, that it was kinda early to drop off the bill soon after our plates were served. Perhaps it's just my sometimes opinionated self. In any case we enjoyed our meals and birthday wine.

Their specials are on a standing board in front of the restaurant. Yes, a marketing attraction - we read it! They hand you a regular menu upon seating. Good balanced meal selections. Picked out what I wanted easily.

They have three seating sections in this restaurant. Doesn't look like it at first, but toward the back there's enough space for a private party. Definitely fond of the decor; of course my favorite is the instrument chandeliers.",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,61,49,4,npiV0TV-hH6fQh2lZj-D7g

Service: My most recent visits were with the weekend grave shift crew.  The Host team was always friendly with getting our groups seated quickly.  Our server the other night was great, he with letting us try the macaroni salad before deciding between that or toast. The night before, our server got flustered with our drink orders but in the end she nailed it.  Everyone was great with taking care of our group at such a late hour.

Late night eats: My first late night out was a cheeseburger with the macaroni salad.  Ingredients were good and the burger was prepped well.  The following night, I recovered with a Loco Moco that came out on a long plate versus a bowl.  I adapted and the gravy was tasty and paired well with the hamburger patty as it should in a loco moco

Ambiance: Newly remodeled with this colorful NOLA contemporary theme, chocked full of bright colors, iron bars and trumpet lighting to bring back cool memories I had in the French Quarter.  Lots of spacing in the two open dining areas which is 5x better than the seating in the Courtyard Cafe.  Well done on the design and theme execution.

Pricing is pretty fair to the quality and quantity of food received.  However with Vegas becoming a low key foodie capital, you can get much more interesting dishes close by for similar pricing.  Compared to the pricing of other casino cafes, Copper Whisk offers great value.  You get seated quickly, friendly staff and above average cafe food even at 2 AM+. Copper Whisk is open 24 hours and they just made my list of casino cafe possibilities to recover after a great night of partying.

Coffee is now $3.50.  We are still paying $2.00 or $2.50 at comparable places.  The least inexpensive egg  breakfast is $7.99.  If you want to add bacon or meat be prepared for over $10.     Ironically they have omitted the price for that on their online menu. It just says ""varies"".  At least it did this date.

4655291,2018-01-26,6,kajp1s8tu9B59OyyHoBExg,"Where the spirit of Viva Las Vegas and New Orleans meet in a themed resort called The Orleans, there is a 24 hour cafe called Copper Whisk Cafe. It is the second incarnation of the Orlean's cafe. At the beginning of 2017, the Orlean's spent approximately $2 million dollars transforming the Courtyard Cafe into the more contemporary Copper Whisk Cafe. 

This past October when we stayed at the Orlean's for a week, we had a dinner and a few breakfasts here. Right off the bat, I noticed significant differences from the former Courtyard Cafe that we had been to a few times in the past. The ambiance has improved at the same time that the selection and value has taken a dip. 

On the first night of the vacation, when my dad had spent a day travelling from New York, we decided to hang out in the Orlean's and have dinner in their cafe. I decided on a dinner special. However, there were far fewer here that in the former cafe. I decided on Chicken Alfredo Primavera. It went for $14.99 and included a soup or salad. I ordered a soup. Despite the price increases, I appreciated the cafe tradition of including soup or salad with the entree. Likewise, I appreciated the large serving of Rigatoni pasta, Julienne sliced grilled chicken, creamy Alfredo sauce, and fresh vegetables. It tasted 3 stars as in A-ok. I added slightly more flavor by pouring a small bowl of grated cheese on it. I'd pass over the Garlic Ciabatta bread on the top and right portions of the plate.

During our stay in this faux New Orleans in Vegas, this was our breakfast of choice. The Orlean's Friday's is closed for breakfast and for the price of the Java Detour coffee, we'd be paying 45% towards a breakfast in this sit down restaurant. Disparate from the Java place the lines to the cafe were relatively short. I did observe that there were empty tables and a failure to get people off the line in a timely manner to them. The majority of the time I ordered the American Breakfast either with or without bacon. Being that the days of value are gone, it is $7.99 without bacon and $9.99 with bacon or sausage. That is before the bottomless coffee that is around $3.50. My attitude on the noticeable price increases was that I  live once and I was on vacation. With that said, my American Breakfast included two scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, an English muffin, a slice of cantelope, and sometimes bacon. The breakfast potatoes were my favorite American Breakfast item. There was one morning that I ordered the pancakes with scrambled eggs and bacon. At $10.99 this included 2 stacks of pancakes from the following flavors: buttermilk, blueberry, banana, and chocolate chip. Much to my disappointment that I rate 3 stars, they did not blanket the 2  pancakes with blueberry flavored topping and syrup that a restaurant like IHOP would have. The pancakes themselves were blueberry. I'd have no choice but to cover them up with Maple syrup. With every breakfast,the $3.50 cup of coffee was on the par of the Starbuck's served in Java Detour.

   What I really appreciate about this place is that they improved upon the New Orlean's theme. I enjoyed the sights of a more contemporary New Orleans theme. The highlight of the upscale interior are the trumpet lights hanging from the white dome in the center of the room. This drew me into the theme. Adding to the interior  that drew me into a contemporary New Orleans were the brick walls holding iron rails and copper pans. From my observation, the Copper Whisk is more closed in than the Courtyard Cafe was. In this closed in restaurant we'd always sit in the one of two rooms closer to the entrance just a toss away from the sports book. I also observed that the red seats were very comfortable. 

The service was satisfactory. Whether it was dinner or breakfast, we never encountered rude employees, 

Regardless that the former Courtyard Cafe was a star better, I appreciate that the Orlean's has retained their 24 hour cafe unlike some casinos including Bally's, the Rio, and Mirage. As a local, I would not go out of my way to dine here. However, as a local that became a tourist for a week staying at the Orlean's, the Copper Whisk Cafe was our choice for breakfasts and the first vacation dinner.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,16,12,3,pmh1dhL5xfeWCBcv1nFS-Q

We heard the advertisements about the remodel and hoped for a good experience.  Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

We think the restaurant and decorations are very welcoming and nice (.5 Star for the remodel), but the service and food was only worthy of 1.5 Stars.  We were seated at back of the main dining room (next to the divider).  We were ignored by everyone except the young lady who got our drinks.  After about 10 minutes, we flagged down a server and asked if we were in her section.  She said, ""No"" but offered to find our server.  No one knew whose section we were in, so a male server took our orders.  I wanted breakfast and they have Chicken Fried Steak on the menu so I asked him if it is a frozen patty or if it is breaded in house.  He assured us that since the remodel they are made in house...good so far...so I asked for a sample of the Country Gravy and he brought it to us.  The gravy was good but he said that he had talked to one of the people in the kitchen and it actually comes frozen...OK, not going to happen.

The item from the old menu that I liked was the Creole Omelet, but since the remodel, there is a ""limited"" breakfast menu between 2pm and 6am...so, no Creole Omelet was available for me to order at 4:30pm...back to the drawing board.

We each ordered  from their daily specials...Hubby ordered the Spaghetti Bolognese and I ordered the Margharita Flat Bread Pizza.  Both ""specials"" came with a house salad.  The salad ingredients were fresh, but the dressings (Ranch for hubby and Caesar for me) were both bottled...really???  How hard is it to make a delicious Ranch from scratch???

The entrees were both terrible.  My Flat Bread Pizza came on a pre-made, packaged crust...thick and cardboardy, but it was better than hubby's Spaghetti Bolognese...the sauce was just OK, but the spaghetti had been cooked so long that it wasn't only mushy, it was broken into little shards that looked like they had been sitting and stirred 50 times.

The Orleans has really missed the mark here.  There are so few really good Cajun/Creole places in Las Vegas that they could really make a statement here if they would try.  All in all, this was a really sad excuse for lunch and wasn't worth the money we spent on the meal.",ir4WO771GAEfvUEr1nfo0Q,1,1,2,sa26R7NWgGzL3OsAJAx-CA

My experience : it's a Saturday at 12;50am. There is a total of 8 to 12 customers present. There are 3 workers behind the front entry greeting people and there was 3 lady's serving drinks. I asked one lady if we can make an order and she said she will send somebody else. So I said fine... 10 mins passed and then nobody. I saw a gentlemen taking orders and I assume it was him that suppose to take my order... So he saw us and j said can I place an order. He then said ok let me get somebody. Now it is a successful 20 mins and zero help! So I finally had it so I turned and asked the 3 lady's at the front entry for somebody to take our order. They looked at me like I was crazy and said let us get somebody. I asked them please don't get nobody and write down our order. Oxtail soup and a salad! She brought it to the kitchen and then we got our food. The sad part is we got our food and still we were not helped by a waiter. It's ok i guess but lack of service here. The amount of workers present at the time to the amount of customers. I would say it is totally unacceptable behavior and service that they provided. 2 stars because I liked the food alot and 1 star would of happened if the would was mediocre.",E-rsiTokCKMtbPLGZHHiTA,1,0,2,YNYWM6VSaFPSgHr76ZYIfQ

I thought $3.50 for coffee was steep and they seem to be using a different purveyor as the bagel I had tasted like a Sara Lee, not the same quality as before. I did check on menus posted on Yelp! just 3 months ago, and the coffee was $2.99 then, so that went up almost 20%. A bacon and eggs breakfast went up from $7.99 to $8.99, so 13%. Not as much as we all think. It wouldn't be a problem if the food quality stays the same. We always stay and play at Orleans,  so I'm sure we'll be back anyway.",LPkh_eURB6fOA1w7GSf1qA,0,0,4,TrIycUYs9CQbONzOpqKT8Q

The hawaiian breakfast was also good with large portions.  Staff is friendly and fast.  There is usually no wait!",bv5g9xdct8AW3AHQeyn7Lw,4,3,3,qCvv2X4kGot2EUwGNKBVHA

Had lunch at the Cafe. Wife had a Salmon Salad and I had the Carved Turkey...Both were very good.

Rose was our server. Very attentive, 
accommodating, and gracious. We strongly recommend her. 

Enjoy your Visit to Las Vegas.",XhkvlL5620mbi4ozXcmt1g,0,0,5,-ri82Abblx5XTmRG8g3N7Q
5837906,2018-01-27,2,kajp1s8tu9B59OyyHoBExg,"I recently had my first experience here after the restaurant's conversion from the old Courthouse Cafe, and was pleased opening with a bowl of hot and savory Chicken & Sausage Gumbo, in which a large amount of rice resided to help absorb the several spices present.  Then, although this was probably enough food to provide a full meal for most diners, in order to be able to pen a more robust restaurant review I nevertheless moved on to an Orleans Clubhouse Sandwich.

The Orleans Clubhouse Sandwich here needs to be distinguished from its close cousin, the Chicken Clubhouse Sandwich, which is also on the menu.  My Orleans Club, packed with both ham and bacon, Smoked Gouda Cheese, lettuce, tomato, and some mayo, on lightly toasted bread, almost did me in.  Fresh and tasty as it was, it was comprised of four very large, toothpicked together sandwich sections.  At first I removed a toothpick to eat what I thought was a section, only to learn that I had not drilled down low enough, leaving a crucial part behind on the plate.  Once properly holding a complete sandwich section in my hand and after aiming it upward to bite down on with my teeth, I was barely able to get my mouth around the whole length.  It took awhile, but eventually I finished the entire sandwich, although I hardly needed to.  And it was very satisfying, served with good skin-on Fries and fresh strands of cabbage that joined together to fashion a cool Slaw.

A bowl of Oxtail Soup overflowing with big clumps of oxtail meat was ordered by my poker-playing friend visiting from Texas, and he pronounced it to be very tasty.  It quickly became clear to me that, even more than the Gumbo, the Oxtail Soup here is designed to furnish a complete solo meal.  I will keep this in mind when giving it a try myself in the future.

The brightened room has a nice new look, and faux leather seating was comfortable.  Service was good, except for slow bringing of food to the table after production of the Gumbo.  But, in fairness to the cooks and waitstaff, we were dining during the 12 o'clock lunch hour, and just about every seat in the room was occupied.  

A noticeable improvement over the old coffee shop!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,6,5,4,8upfR6fhMSDk8rAH9Bufuw

Me and my friend strolled in around 4 am after the band in the lounge wrapped up to fill our bellies with some food. The decor is very alluring as there are instruments grouped together on the ceiling and the tables along the wall have bench chairs. The place gives off a Victorian/New Orleans feel with all the decor and settings. It was my kind of place. The service was hilarious and on point. The steak and eggs which I ordered and hot cocoa was appetizing and filling. My friend had the mushroom omelette and we both left with food coma. The prices were more than reasonable. It was the icing to our cake of the night.",Znid_azpcHmdRMHGicmkWA,10,13,4,6qSb87SZJsrg-ryf3f7Mag
