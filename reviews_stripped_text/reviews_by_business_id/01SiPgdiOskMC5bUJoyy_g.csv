Customer service is always great. We never had to wait to be seated and we are always were taken care of by our  servers quickly.

I usually get the Cuvée or Tapit salad, which are healthy yet filling and offer a nice combination of flavors. The cuvée has candied walnuts and smoked gouda, tossed in a champagne vinaigrette. Nuff said. The servers are speedy and friendly, as they know that we are all trying to get a quick bite before returning to work. That said, I have also brought clients here. The booths are nice for one-to-one conversation and there is a full bar, if you are in a jovial mood, or trying to get there. The prices are right-on for a sit-down place with a little class. The salads are just under $12, and they have have daily specials, which are a nice addition (I.E. Mexican fare and Taco Tuesday, yay!) Rumor has it this place is owned by the same family as the donut people. I don't know about that, but it makes for a cool story. Anyway, bottom line, this place is a lunch staple when you don't want fast food or chain food! Bon Appetit!

PS - the manager is Mike. If you have a problem, he makes it go away. If that doesn't work, take a seat at the bar and be beguiled by the beautiful and talented Stephanie. That should make you forget all your troubles!",pOI8k1l3PsAqbKhdiqZ9pg,1,1,4,EDaBTG-NE3gZjbiJiuNRPA

734025,2011-12-21,0,01SiPgdiOskMC5bUJoyy_g,"We come to this place on two occasions...that's day, and night...errr... just before dawn. It's another of those locals pubs that's pretty unique to Las Vegas and we've added it to the list of places to go if you want a better breakfast than many other locals pubs and a decent lunch as well. There are five locations in town but we've never made it anywhere but the Warm Springs one so far. 

We come here before dawn when heading out of town, because it's a great place for a filling breakfast and then we can drop the car off at the RTC South Strip Transit Center and take the bus in to McCarran Airport for those flights that leave at 5:30 or 6:00 AM. It's become quite the tradition and it wouldn't be if the food wasn't worth it. The price is right, too, and often we're the only people in there at that hour but the person who is the server/bartender (and cook?) is always happy to see us and treats us well. The biscuits and gravy are excellent, as well as their ""Winchell's Scramble.""

After coming here a few times for zero-dark-hundred breakfast, we decided to give lunch/brunch a try. Nothing too special, but good enough for the price and your typical bar food all around. The only thing to note is that the menu says breakfast stops at 11 AM weekdays and noon on Saturdays and 2 on Sundays, but the interpretation of those times really depends on your server. Luck of the draw as to whether it means 10:45 AM or 12 noon some days. Do plan ahead if eggs or a skillet are definitely what you crave and it's getting close to 11, even on weekends.

We've only been here for dinner once and never to drink at the bar, but service at all times was pretty good (except for one lunch where the server was clearly having a bad day) so I guess if we made it out there for happy hour or to catch a game on one of their many TV's it would be just as good.

Bottom line: Not a gastropub or even really a ""destination"" locals place, but if you are in the neighborhood or just curious, stopping in won't do you or your wallet any harm. As with us, it might even become a habit.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,1,1,3,ypaTYtIGhq5zGdx_wK6DWg

As you walk in be prepared to resemble the 3 blind mice...it's dark in the bar area and takes a minute to adjust. I felt like I was blindfolded. The dining area is much brighter, windows all around and even an enclosed patio in the back. The menu has lots of items and they have daily lunch and dinner specials. The value compared with the quality of food is what impresses me most. Most items are around $9-10 and unless you are completely starving there's a chance you won't finish the hearty portions. I love the Chicken Club! The homemade potato chips are incredible and I'm not even a potato chip fiend. Any of the salads you get will be great mostly due to their homemade dressings....YUM. I even get the honey mustard on the side for my club because it's so tasty. The burgers always look perfectly prepared and the wraps are filling too. 

The staff is really nice and the bar area has lots of TV's to entertain a sports loving group. There is a comfy little lounge behind the bar with a toasty fireplace if you're chilly. They also do a huge Superbowl pool when it comes time for the big game. Stop by, it's worth it!!",B7mqXzrSFKM_Wff2tbBagw,3,0,4,jWSjmeLDiI2YwxInE_io6g
1023082,2013-05-08,0,01SiPgdiOskMC5bUJoyy_g,"As a Vegas local (as I like to think of myself now after 5 years), I respect the PTs chain here. I have met some great people who work at PTs and the service is usually the best. However, I just moved and the PTs that is located near my new home was not up to par. The two female bartenders were a bit oblivious to the things going on around them, so that is what brought me to Winchell's.

 This Winchell's is in walking distance of my new place (plus), the food I had was delicious, but the whole menu is what has caught my attention. It has a great variety and I will be back to try some things. The service from the two bartenders at the time were super nice and got my group our new player cards. They had Third Shift for 2 bucks or some cheap number at the time, which was pretty awesome. 

One of the managers was very friendly and said that during football season they have numerous TVs and space for sitting in couches and chairs right in front of them (MAJOR PLUS).

1063166,2013-09-05,0,01SiPgdiOskMC5bUJoyy_g,"I recently started working on the area, so as I'm scoping new lunch places, I came across Winchell's Pub.  

I'm always up for good bar conversation and a little appetizer, so thought, why the heck not.  First time, lunch rush seemed to be pretty busy, if I'm by myself I generally will eat at the bar, quicker seating, kill some time watching whatever sports is on (yes, I'm a woman but love me a good game).  So I sat down at the bar, I was probably there a good 10 min before even being acknowledged by the bartender.  So right off, I wasn't completely impressed.  I ordered my food which came out very fast and made up for some of the time I spent waiting for an acknowledgement  when I walked in.  I finished and no joke, probably waited another 15 minutes for her to even look at me before I could ask for my check.  I get it, I'm not a guy she can flirt with to get bigger tips, though I am a nice looking, well dressed woman who tips very well when it is deserved.

So, I went back the following week, the food was good and it is about 45 seconds from work, so what the heck, right?  I walked in and maybe 3 people at the bar, GREAT, should not take that long at all.  I mean, comparatively, they were pretty busy the first time.  I sat down at the bar and noticed the same bartender working.  She was over at the side, eating, saw me walk in and still took about another 5 minutes to acknowledge me.  Okay, fine, everyone is hungry and has to eat.  I ordered and again, food was out in record time.  I ate.  Bowl is empty, she walks past me a million times in the 15 minutes since I've finished and still fails to acknowledge that I am done and may potentially want my check.  I flag her down after my annoyance level is up past my eyeballs and ask for my check to be closed.

Will I be back, sadly, probably.  It's convenient and the food is good. I may try the restaurant area next time, I don't know.  There is always the option, I guess, of putting a sock in my pants and a baseball cap on, taping down the girls and hoping I get some mediocre service but that just seems too difficult for a lunch break.",fL7d47AR-KO1mriFAB6Njw,2,1,3,XVxDN1boQ_Y-RTs19HYoWA
1099082,2013-09-15,3,01SiPgdiOskMC5bUJoyy_g,"This is the fall-back spot for Lunchies with Elite Emily (which could be a Food Network show at this point). But don't take ""fall-back"" as a bad thing... we wouldn't keep coming back here over and over if it wasn't deserving of it.

Life's too short to eat bad food!

Elite Emily loves the Veggie Pita Sandwich, but I'm more of a meatitarian, so I go for their Chili Size. We all know I swoon for a spoon of chili, and Winchell's chili is up to snuff -- good, sturdy, great as part of a meal or on its own. And they're very careful to ask if you want cheese and onions with it, which to chili lovers is a great touch, as sometimes they're good, and sometimes they overpower the flavor of the chili.

The Chili Size is an open-faced burger drowning in a sea of hot, gloppy chili goodness. Don't you dare try eating it like a burger... you will make a mess and we all will point and laugh. Loudly. Even more loudly if you're wearing white. Instead, grab that knife and fork and dig right in to some down-home goodness.

Service is very attentive, even during busy lunch hours, and the staff gets to know their regulars fairly quickly. We almost always have time to grab lunch, catch up on the latest gossip, and still have time to spare within Elite Emily's lunch hour.

Pros:
-Cheap eats.  Food here is priced pretty good.  Example:  8 oz filet for $21.99.  Ton's of daily specials and lunch specials. 
-Wide selection for a bar, grill, and pub
-Taste:  I say you get what you pay for.  Nothing taste really bad, but not excellent.  Again, it's cheap.  
-Dining room seating or bar seating
-Video Poker if that's your cup of tea
-Plenty of parking. 

Cons:
-Smoking:  It's a bar and pub, should be expected.  
-Dark inside
-Service is not the best.  Took a while for our orders to be taken, even longer for the food to arrive.  
-Wide selection of food, but not the best place to if you're watching your cals.

I tried their 8 oz Filet and cup of chili.  The filet was little dry and tasted close to a NY Steak.  Still got my protein from it, so I was happy.  The chili here was my highlight. It's topped with onions and also has a little kick to it. I almost got seconds, but figured that it was best that I didn't since I was trying to keep the calories a little low for the day. 

Overall, the 3 stars means that the food here is just okay.  Don't let the 3 stars discourage you.  Winchell's is a good place to hang out with friends and even get a meal in. I'll probably be back again to meet the homegirl for lunch.  Otherwise, I just don't see myself going out of my way to eat here.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,9,8,3,9iE02LXvYusfwgbCL8WPgg

I had the Stuffed Avocado Salad with Chicken Salad and Honey Mustard. I really enjoyed this salad. It is definitely a splurge salad versus a healthy salad, but that is why I ordered it. I love salads that include a boiled egg. The scoop of chicken salad on top was creamy, tasty, and generously portioned. The price of the salad was right for a quick work lunch as well.

Service started a little shaky with nobody manning the hostess stand. Once finally seated we had another wait before our waitress arrived. Once we ordered things went smoothly from there. It was a short wait on food and checks arrived at the right time. It didn't take the waitress long to get us cashed out and she was kind enough to ask how the check would be split when she took our orders.

The rest of the food was pretty good as well.  They do have freshly made chips you can order as an appetizer which we did with ranch which was not bad.

We ordered a steak which was ok, it was not the worst steak I have had but by far not the best which boils down to the quality of the meat they order for the place and use.

Little did I know there was an all-adult version serving up cold brewskies and typical bar fare for those who woud rather waste calories on beers instead of donuts.  Because of its location, I decided to have a little Happy Hour here for some coworkers and staff.  

The manager, Michael, was more than accommodating and very friendly from the get-go.  I called some days ahead to give them the heads up and they let me know there was a private patio room they would seat us in.  

We had pre-ordered apps so they would be ready to start bringing them out as soon as we got there.  Unfortunately, the patio room had a couple of AC units that seemed to be working on overtime as they sounded like planes flying over head.  In addition, the room was very echoey so we couldn't hear each other talking at all.  I could literally be sitting next to someone and if I wasn't looking directly at their lips moving, I would have no idea what they were saying.

The food came out and it was all typical bar food.  We ordered a few appetizer platters which came with fried zucchini, 2 wings, 2 tenders, mozz sticks and I think that's it.  The wings and tenders were dry and unappetizing. I was very unimpressed with the appetizer platter altogether.  We also ordered chicken quesadillas, nachos and fries, which were all decent. The nachos were my favorite.  Imagine a mountain of chips placed within a large taco salad bowl (genius, in my opinion!) and drizzled with cheese, sour cream, beans, salsa, guac and chicken.  It was perfectly warm with the right amount of each element.  It was a little messy to eat and probably awkward given the professional setting, but still yummy nonetheless.

The service became painfully slow as the next two hours progressed.  Our poor server was this quiet timid older woman who would manage to sneak in and out like a ninja without anyone who wanted to order a drink seeing her.  Someone would say where's the waitress, and someone else would say, she just came in and grabbed some empty plates.  It went on like this all night and I had to constantly run out of the room to find her, bring her in, and yell across to room to make sure everyone got a chance to order a drink.  

No one ever came to buss our tables so we ended up bussing them ourselves and putting all the dirty dishes onto one table.  It was appalling.  

If not for the decent nachos and Michael's friendliness and willingness to accommodate us, I would have given this place only two stars.  But to be honest, even with its 3 stars, I sadly will not be bringing my monthly happy hour party back here again.",LwVUO_5jjHuJRhvl6hlHVg,0,0,3,1D4o98IzpQCyBMgEI6vv_A

5874482,2009-01-08,0,01SiPgdiOskMC5bUJoyy_g,I have ate here many times in the past.  I was very disappointed tonight after ordering Thai Chicken Skewers.  They were made with dark meat chicken that was fatty at the cost of $8.99.  I was charged $3.50 for a very small cup of vegetables.  After the .75 pick up fee and tax it cost a hefty $14.27 for a very disappointing meal.  In this economy I see so many of my favorite restaurants using substandard food and charging more.  Suffice it to say I will be eating home a lot more than I use to.,hlZr3cVCDRzTuypjWqD9_A,0,0,1,MMmxeR-RaYiM150_MoYRxw

My oriental chicken salad was fine but my fried zucchini wedges came as slices - when I read wedges on a menu (online) I think of something resembling pickle spears. It was also cold and soggy, like completely cold and soggy. Misorder? Refrigerated? Just completely old.",Pinnqw9LFBBlrtpFL7tQxg,0,0,2,JRZZn2-bk_l2bKtQlvDrog
5898955,2015-03-31,0,01SiPgdiOskMC5bUJoyy_g,"Flew into Vegas for the weekend and this was our first official stop for lunch.  It is super close to the airport... I think you can walk there if you wanted to (0.25 miles) but it was convenient since we exited out of the rental car deck and found ourselves on the same street.

I ordered a lunch special burger... 1/2 Angus jalapeno burger with all the toppings... was tasty and filling.  Their ""skinny"" fries are a bit of a mis-nomer since I automatically think of a lower calorie french fry (that tastes like card board) but these are just skinny in shape.  I think I usually see them called shoestring fries.

Servers were friendly and accommodating... especially after I ordered a beer at 10am.... no judgments were hashed out.  I would definitely come here again... especially since this place is open 24hrs.... but I would question my need to come here at 3 or 4am. :)",Ry1O_KXZHGRI8g5zBR3IcQ,1,0,4,lSWS-uKHJMHmwQrvNaHwaw

So I was forced to go to the competition...  Also happy hour is relatively long but it is unclear when it actually is...

5922907,2014-12-11,2,01SiPgdiOskMC5bUJoyy_g,This place is disgusting.  First of all it is so filthy it was actually grossing me out to eat there.  I was going along with my friends so I didn't want to say anything the carpet alone was disgusting I didn't even want to walk on it. The waitresses were friendly and it was decorated for Christmas.   I ordered a French dip and I bit into it and I could just tell that the roast beef was old and had a funny taste to it.   Sure enough I was sick all night.  I would never return to this place for as much as people hype about it no thanks,fuMLnjEjt3_GM5rc0XJY2Q,2,0,1,R5TtmaNGBxIULCLaFnrDwQ

The food is always solid and despite the initial glitch in service on my first visit, service is always friendly and extremely efficient. It's a great place to get a quick bite for lunch. I have become absolutely addicted to the veggie pita sandwich. It's the only thing I ever come for. I do eventually have to try something else, but it'll be hard to pull away from my favorite. They have lots of lunch specials that are incredibly reasonably priced and they have a lot of variety daily. The regular menu pricing is also very well-priced and reasonable. My dining companions are also always very pleased with their meal choices as well. 

I will continue to keep Winchell's on my lunchtime rotation.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,4,H5DLBgkWdrqHeDJbbPNcxA

Great salads as well and nice atmosphere.  Seems to be for the locals which is always good, and was nice to see a good baseball game there, the Indians getting the record in the AL for their win streak.",S-oatbN-h7SKiWwkTWw5QA,0,0,4,BYeyDlcWIP6rn1KO0z0gOQ
