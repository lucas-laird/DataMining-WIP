A few things to work on ( but not worth taking off a star )
1) workers need to get in tune with each other, they will get there... still seem new.

3) set up for drinks.. need a table near the drinks for straws, lids and napkins

1577567,2017-08-29,5,YSAI_l2wLGfGEcLgxR09Ug,When it comes to legitimate cheesesteak here in town we all pretty much head to Pops. I remember Straight From Philly Steakout from back in the day (used to be where Pops is now) and after eating here recently I remembered why they faded from the spotlight years ago. This place would draw long lines and people raved about the cheesesteak and then the quality started to decline and the lines did too. Not sure they will ever capture the attention they once did especially with Pops nearby. I used the drive thru and the girl who took my order wasn't friendly at all. She made me feel like I was bothering her by ordering a sandwich. When I first unwrapped the pastrami sandwich it looked so good there was a good amount of meat filled nicely inside the bread. The pastrami was a disappointment with very little flavor and the meat  was thin and gristly. If you base your pastrami on places known for it like The Hat (cali) or The Hut (AZ) the pastrami here will definitely not be up to your standards. The cheesesteak I had was so bad. Seriously the meat was flavorless and the grease was everywhere and it was a complete waste of money. The owner doesn't take feedback well here on yelp and instead just wants to believe their way is the right way. It to me tasted like they bought a case of Steak-umms from Sam's Club and threw it on the grill. I am shocked to see the way they respond to some of the yelp reviews on here. It's like Rambo's Kitchen rants all over again lol. I'd rather give my hard earned money to Pops where I have never been treated so badly for just ordering a sandwich and where the food is worth the money because I personally did not find that here.,eytpwJXgg5nWU6jrlQ6qAA,9,5,1,RMYSKRSVjy0G1BXPGP4dnw

Las Vegas has a tendency to have restaurants that always say genuine but always have horrible food & somehow still stay in business for years. This is not one of those places. Every time I eat here it takes me back to Pennsylvania. I have to control myself from only going here weekly. I have tried many places including one near this one & none of them are even close to the quality that this place has.

It's wasn't bad but the flavor wasnt anything you can grab on to with nostalgia. It was just a cheese steak sandwich nothing more nothing less. Tastes good but so does the Capriottis cheese steak but the difference is Capriottis costs less. We had the cheez  wiz and it didn't pack a punch of flavor, I knew it was in there but just didn't taste it. Everything is al la carte so if you want fries its additional (no biggie) drink also additional again no biggie however....to add tomato, lettuce or mushrooms $1 extra per item. Again I'll pay for extras but lettuce? Tomato? Come on thats just silly to nickel and dime for 2-3 slices of tomato. Two steak sandwiches, two orders of fries, two drinks and an order or mozzarella sticks $42. I appreciated the young man who gave us our food from the drive through remembering he forgot to add tomatoes to my sandwich before I drove off, and gave me a container with some later to add however when We parked and I unwrapped my sandwich to dig in I noticed they also forgot my mayo and ketchup I requested on my sandwich (bummer) I checked the bag where the fries were...also no ketchup packets.  We came, we saw and we conquered...we won't rush back. Again not because it nasty it just was mediocre.

It would be ok with little cheese as long as the meat was very moist but it wasn't. Which is also understandable since its just a drive thru fast food but these things need to be considered in order to compensate for a good finished product. Reading other reviews, I see that some days are good and some not which leads me to believe the meat is not fresh every day. You would have to catch them on a fresh day or a cheese generous day.

My friend and I decided to head down and see if this Resteraunt lives up to the name. 

We walked in and it was empty. A lady
Who I assume was family or the owner was sitting in the dining area writing and coloring with her kid, there was like 5 people behind the counter. ( seemed a little over staffed considering it was dead)! The decode was blah and it was not welcoming at all. I went to the counter to order. Pretty simple, two Philly cheesesteaks no onions and one with extra cheese and two chili cheese fries. The little girl behind the counter had to ask me three times to repeat my order ¿? Ok, I did... I'll let it slide. I ordered a drink and paid. I asked for a receipt. I waited... and waited... (insert suspenseful music here) finally I looked st her and said ""can I please have my receipt...?"" She chuckled and said.. ""Oh ahaha, I was wondering why you were standing here still!!!!!!"" WTF? Ok... first stirke.

I use the restroom and come out to get my drink... Oh wait!!! There's no drink machine? I ask the little girl where I get the drink. Not in the dining area but a back right corner behind two walls hardly seen.... ( Who thought that was a good idea? ) Wondering now if mom and pop have any idea about marketing or advertising putting the drink machine where people can see it might stimulate them to buy.... I digress... Strike 2

The most important part, the food...
Good portions and fresh ingredients as we've grown to expect. The beef could use another shake or two of seasoning. Fries are packaged in a plastic to go container with no ventilation...BIG no no. They sweat and become soggy. I am sure some folks like that, but I prefer crispy fries.

The two things that were slight downsides is that the Provolone must be sliced razor thin, because I barely saw it on the bottom of my roll and could not taste it at all.

While in the area last night my hubby and I decided to stop here for dinner. I can't say anything tasted like I remembered or I am just ruined by Pop's.

Grilled Hot Pastrami Sandwich ($10) - Pastrami, grilled onions, pickles and provolone. The pastrami wasn't very flavorful. The sandwich looked good, but just was average in taste. The best part of it was honestly the bread. 

Cheez Whiz Steak Sandwich ($9) - I can't say after taking my first bite that I wasn't impressed. The meat really lacked flavor and the grease was ridiculous. Grease soaked through the wrapper and bread. I see the owner responds to the negative reviews for this listing and the bashing of Pop's by them is unnecessary. Pop's puts out a legit cheesesteak and I have no problem paying a couple extra dollars to get more sandwich and extra flavor from them. I really wanted to truly like Straight From Philly Steakout, but just didn't. 

Besides steak they also have a chicken philly and a few cold sandwiches as well a few fried appetizers. One plus is they have Cherry Coke.

UPDATE: So of course I wrote a review less than 4 stars and I mentioned Pop's, so the owner had to respond to my review with no class. To assume I have never been to Philly is just ignorant. There is certain way to respond to customers and the way it's done absolutely reflects the business you will have, or not have because of such tackiness. When you open so close to Pop's, which is well loved by many in town, you are going to be judged against them it's not like there's a huge cheeseteak market here. The meat I had here at Straight from Philly Steakout tasted low grade, lacked flavor and was absurdly greasy and that's a fact. Pop's cheesesteak is legit and I'll drive across town for it any day over coming here.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,61,56,2,nr8bJxxH_qf-rwHU1WzxOQ

The only thing they need to work on is the bread they use.  After the meat and everything is put on the bread it makes the bread gross and soggy.  It kinda ruined an amazing meal. I mentioned to the manager that it was very soggy and I didn't care for it that much.  He suggested that next time I ask them to grill the bread.
The 2nd that's me I came in I told them my sandwich was soggy and gross so asked them to toast or grill the bread. They did but it didn't stop the bread from being soggy.  If I come back I will just eat the cheesesteak without the bread. I just think they are using the wrong bread",TeEt3ck4ZZlzwKglH21Nzw,0,0,4,CeWkMmchOgq6TIWwrjtjzQ

Food came out fast and was hot. Fries were extra hot excellent. About $15 for a combo.

4146911,2018-04-28,3,YSAI_l2wLGfGEcLgxR09Ug,"Where this Straight From Philly is located has been many other places in the past. Nothing seems to last too long. Will they suffer the same fate? Who could say? Only time will tell that tale. I can only tell you my story.

I came in on Thursday afternoon for lunch. There was one customer leaving when I arrived. I was the only person eating there. I noticed maybe two drive-thru customers. During my time in-store.

I ordered a cheese steak with onions, peppers, mushroom and cheese whiz. To me that is the ultimate Philly. Traditional to me and has all of my favorites in one sandwich. It came out quickly much to my happy surprise. Other Philly places have taken so very long. But like I mentioned, it wasn't busy. 

The sandwich was HOT! Hard to pick up even. So imagine that first bite with the molten yellow-orange cheese oozing everywhere. It was almost hard to eat but I had to keep going. Its so much better hot. I made a total mess with every bite. I wished I had a fork to scoop of the goodness but I settled for my fingers. Hell, there was nobody there to judge me anyhow. It was a craveable sandwich complete with salty and savory flavors all through the hoagie roll which was actually a little soft for my liking. I didn't want to let any of that go to waste.

The sandwich was $10. A little on the pricey side but not really unreasonable. It was a good sandwich in terms of flavor. Perhaps not the best or even biggest Philly I've had but solid. There is a lot they are doing right in this place down to the complimentary apples by the register. One per customer, please. There are a couple of things which irritate me though. The older gentleman, for example, who spent more time outside smoking than actually in ths store helping to cook. I suppose when its quiet he can afford to leave the store behind for a bit. I just don't like it. Another pet peeve, as I drove back to work I passed by another Philly Cheese Steak place not too far away. Less than a block before I passed by that store I saw a man with a large sign telling me to turn around and go to Straight From Philly. I don't disagree with advertising but to be so blatant so close to a ""rival"" seems unnecessary. I admit, it made me chuckle but I don't like it. Will that dissuade me from going to either? Not likely. I have been to both places and I happen to like both places. But they are different and respectible in their own right offering a different experience and atmosphere. I will go to each in the future depending on my situation and time frame. No need to resort to childish games. Ok, I'll get off my high horse now. Enjoy a sandwich wherever you choose to go. You can't go wrong with a Philly Cheese Steak.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,5,4,4,z-O86RNpot-LMmz6p-NdYg

From the OG Amoroso bread, to the option of Cheese Whiz in your sandwich, their Philly Cheesesteaks are unparalleled in Las Vegas in my opinion. I'm so glad through all their relocations that this place still exists. If I could have the hots for an establishment, this place would definitely do it. Because I'm crushing hard on their food. 

Anyone who knows me knows I am a Philly Cheesesteak guy which is likely while I'll die early, but that being said, when you find a place that can really just straight up DO. IT. RIGHT... you stay loyal. So since I'm not a girl in a Chris Brown music video, this hoe will be loyal.

I recommend the Philly with mushrooms added. It's a new world of taste good that accents the steak very well. Give it a shot.",4xgbVGM9yklvk8zrOf7tiA,2,0,5,wRkDy3pmpTl1hTU-a-uW2w

I ordered the cheesesteak special and the philly phanatic. Both were amazing!! Cheesesteaks are among my favorite sandwiches and meals. I'll be back and often! Make sure it stop by and have some.
