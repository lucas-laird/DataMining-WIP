With so many people saying so many nice things about it, I've tried it a few times but I'm through. The food is good. It's better than a chain restaurant or even some independent shops. But it will not blow you away and it's definitely not worth their bloated prices. The service people do their job, but you certainly don't feel welcomed. The atmosphere is stark, crowded, and uncomfortable. 

Like an Italian trattoria, the food is prepared in a kitchen that overlooks the dining room but on one warm summer Vegas night the temperature in the dining room was at least as hot as it was outside. Warm summer nights aren't an occasional occurrence here, surely there's a way to deal with that. 

As another Yelp reviewer said, this is the place ""that you would like to like better than you can."" I wanted to love this place, but with so many better alternatives, it's impossible to recommend.",z3QfjD55F6YjDNIjcii5Ew,8,0,1,nKf3Dfq21nxIcLLYGPELGw

I had the eggplant parm ($23) and my wife had the salmon ($26).  My dinner came with a side of penne pasta with sauce.  It came out in a tiny oval dish. The penne was overcooked and falling apart; the sauce was acidic and watery. They came around with grated cheese which I accepted. The busboy dumped a tablespoon of cheese in one glop on top of the watery sauce which made kind of a cheesy paste. The eggplant was multi layered and seemed good after I scraped off the two cups of the same watery sauce.  My wife's salmon seemed to be baked or broiled. The lemon butter sauce was mostly lemon and uninviting. Including two glasses of wine our dinner was $68 plus tax and tip it came to $86.50.  For that price I expect each entree and side to be top notch. We won't be back.",upvKwLboHJD1XXa7zW0lIQ,2,0,2,656UdADCYJx2mwNapdsdrg

When reviewers rave about big portions, I doubt their credibility as food critics.  Give me small portions of really high quality food any day.  The one compliment I can offer is that the pours of wine by the glass (some good options) are very generous, equal to a glass and a half in any other restaurant.

He was also our chef and came to our table to say hello to his paison and my friend, Giovanni. I don't know exactly how it
shakes out, but I believe Piero sold the rights to his name and cannot use it commercially.
Because really, Chloes is his. The food was the best Italian I've ever had. (Take that with a grain of salt. I'm not Italian). I had Veal Marsella, Potatoes Lyonnaise, a House salad
(included diced artichoke hearts, asparagus,
and baby corn. The vinaigrette salad dressing
was amazing), espresso and spumoni for dessert. The pricing is moderate. Dinner for
two with dessert came to 75$(tip not included. We're George and rounded it up to
$100). I read the other reviews and am surprised they found the food just adequate.

asks him to build their Italian Ristorante.

She actually seemed afraid to ask him. At what I'm sure was a shocked look on our faces she did decide to ask him, to which he said no. Are you kidding me? He doesn't even make his own pasta, you can see the boxes piled on the shelf, all he had to do was boil some water and throw some in!!!

It comes down to the fact that Vegas ain't cheap and there is a dearth of competition in the local dining scene.

Must try Salads are;
Grilled Vegetable Salad, Caprese Salad, Cafe Chloe's twist on Ceasar Salad. Manga! Share or wrap leftovers for late night refrigerator raids. 
Entree's are classic huge portion's of Chef Piero's 40 years of experience and passion. Chef with assistance from his protege never miss a beat orchestrating plate after plate.  A culinary gift to you from Chef Piero. 
Must try Entree's are;
EVERYTHING!!! Mama MAMA MIA!
Cafe Chloe sauce is Chef's backbone to his Culinary Italian Nepotain cooking, the secret is out, SORRY Chef! Old school cooking done consistent and at it's very best.
Expensive $$$ depends on how you look at it;
quality, huge portions for an enjoyable meal.
Desserts are homemade, huge sharing portions.

It's been there for 17 years, ( where have I been? ) and is buried treasure! Tucked in a hidden corner of a little strip mall, this place has a reputation, a following, a distinct regular clientele, and a limited but very well crafted menu that  obviously keeps the linens on the table and the wine glasses toasting. Claudia, Diane, Dana... remember Piero's? Pasta Mia? They've been cooking in Las Vegas for 25 years.. Cafe Chloe is old school Italian complete with Frank and Dean music in the background. We'll be back.. delicious!",yeeTZiNtPyd54rOXLOJXdg,1,0,5,W9yXaPZYiA___632xjtb0Q

I was told to make a reservation as they are very busy so I elect to make a reservation for early on a Thurs evening for my husband and me.  Well, we get there and so much for being busy as it is just us and one other table for the duration of our dinner.I noticed the owner/chef in the kitchen kept looking over but never so much as cracked a smile or a hello.  I ordered the Tortellini Cafe Chloe which has some pancetta and pink sauce and it was ok, nothing spectacular.  My husband had the pasta with bolognese and it was good but again, nothing spectacular.  The prices are steep for the portions but as I believe in paying for quality, I gladly would, but in this case, I've had much better homemade Italian at Capo's so will go back there instead.  Cafe Chloe had zero atmosphere other than the owner and staff who just stared at us through dinner......we are normal looking people by the way, nothing shocking to look at over here, but we would have appreciated a warmer welcome.",2Pd17IlJVxekp-1fwdgl0Q,6,1,2,1jnakHvFGEi2NRDwj9LmnQ
