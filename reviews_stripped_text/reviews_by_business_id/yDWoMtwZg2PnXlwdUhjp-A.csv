The crust is way better than before, the sauce is more robust and the cheese is fantastic. I personally enjoy the Handmade Pan pizza with BBQ sauce, chicken, pineapple and mushrooms. The price is comparable to lower end quality pizza joints and Dominos blows all them out of the water. Its hot, fresh, and delivered on time.",8w0WHaqx6X2Etr96G1qT4A,1,0,4,3wPIt13-dAsREpvkVt5ntg

1285502,2013-05-04,0,yDWoMtwZg2PnXlwdUhjp-A,After a long and hard search and eating MANY LOUSY pizza's... FINALLY SUCCESS! Which is odd for us because where we moved to Las Vegas from Domino's had low scale pizza... I was kind of leery about ordering delivery pizza again after MANY FAILED pizza's from other places... But it was HOT!! FRESH!!! VERY YUMMY!! The driver was Very Friendly and even gave us great tips of what else to do here in Vegas besides the strip! I will DEFINITELY order from here again!  We were SO pleased to finally  cure the pizza cravings!! THANK YOU!!!,4aQdEi4dxX9h-O1_wN5PmA,0,0,5,bEG3DglU0dT-WMwfvOZUEA
1445472,2015-02-18,1,yDWoMtwZg2PnXlwdUhjp-A,I am really disappointed in this Domino's.  I ordered a Large with extra cheese pepperoni Italian sausage onions bell peppers and black olives.  There was no extra cheese.  In fact  approximately 20% of My Pizza contained NOTHING BUT CRUST not even sauce!!! Really nothing but bread.  I ordered this Pizza and paid $18.49 for something I could have picked up in the frozen food department at the Grocers.  I can't believe how sparsely covered this Pizza was.  I ordered this exact Pizza while in Hollywood California.........THEY KNOW WHAT A REAL PIZZA SHOULD BE!!  That was my first and last order from this place.  A lesson bought is a lesson learned.,IGNQTlaCQYMiTEAqvQCs2A,0,0,1,a6cnw2WhP1LXR5LH4vCATg
1539027,2017-06-28,1,yDWoMtwZg2PnXlwdUhjp-A,"Birthday wishes!
I called dominos by our house. I had one request..: that they write the number 35 in pepperoni for my husbands birthday. I even offered to pay extra for the service. The woman on the phone said no problem ... I will even do it myself to assure it gets done. When the pizza arrived there was not a 35 written in pepperoni just a regular pepperoni pizza even though I was told this would not be an issue at all! I immediately  called dominos to speak to the manager who's name was Stephanie. This woman refused to give me her last name after I asked even though she claimed to be the manager of this resturant. Any manager of an establishment gets a biz card with a last name on it. So why a manager is scared to give her last name to a customer blows my mind. She also informed me they do nothing for special occasions or momentos for anyone of any sort. Well train your employees to know this then and maybe revamp the whole internet bc you take special requests all the time according to the web. I would of never ordered a pizza from here for this occasion if my request couldn't be filled. There are pics all over the internet of special request you take all the time -- i.e. Drawing on boxes being a huge one. This was such a minor request that was promised and a birthday was ruined because of it. We planned this surprise instead of the cake and everyone at the party was so excited to watch the birthday boy open it (he loves pepperoni pizza from dominos). Epic fail dominos we are so disappointed. Luckily we have a Pizza Hut and Joeys right next door to you that will be getting our future service.

1740930,2017-09-16,0,yDWoMtwZg2PnXlwdUhjp-A,"I was initially going to be kinder in my review of the N. Jones and Charleston DOMINOS due to the fact that they were incredibly swamped when I walked in- there was at least 12 staff at the time (Friday the 15th at 6 P.M. ) and all were running about. That should have indicated competency- but no. Only two people were waiting for orders- the rest were phone- and I placed a simple order for an XL Hawaiian with olive and onion. Simple. I waited 40 minutes as people were served ahead of me- walk-ins and pick-ups. Finally, an employee called my name and handed me the pizza. Not wanting to lose the heat, I waited until I had returned home to open it. What a disappointment. You couldn't tell if there was pineapple at all, and the cheese was dark dingy and brown, not the lively colorful yellow and white of a well made Hawaiian. I will NOT be returning to DOMINOS again. Even LITTLE CAESARS is better than this crap. In Las Vegas, there are hundreds of better Pizza shops- competition should be fierce -- but I guess if you are a National Chain, you can ignore the rubes at your pleasure. Here's to you, Dominos !! P.S. I noticed the wide variations of reviews on here- they veer from 5 stars to 1 with little in-between. For all you surfers out there, it's impossible for a business to be Bi-Polar in it's daily services- it would quickly go bankrupt. But on the internet, with the push of a button, you can raise your rating and make your pizza place look gooood. So all those +5 glowing reviews??.....I am positive that 99 percent of them are - wait for it - FAKE REVIEWS by friends and family of our local DOMINOS. It's the only way such spiky reviews can be possible. So while they lurch along like some sauce and cheese built frankenstonian monster, the innocent and gullible will be victimized again and again and again...........",kNtUTFl-S2ENCOsQFFktNA,0,0,1,AeUZbJuh23iRGnhAdLeX6A
1917528,2017-01-14,0,yDWoMtwZg2PnXlwdUhjp-A,this place is total disappointed I placed an online order and and i was witting for more then 30 min and nothing didn't got my pizza yet i check the app that they have and its show that i got it already and delivered by matt so I called to see when my pizza would arrive. The guy on the phone told me it should be any min but the delivery guy got to my place only 10 mins after. When the driver arrived it wasn't even matt it was a different employee. After she gave me my order she told me that their printer wasn't working so she didn't have my receipt. so When I got my pizza it was already getting cold. how to can eat a not fresh and hot pizza? . its the last time I order from this place.,voYtE7uSJcn1p9OcClBaJQ,0,0,1,ive5_-UL5YvP3QqlqLAusQ
1956233,2014-02-08,0,yDWoMtwZg2PnXlwdUhjp-A,"Kinda is hard to write this cuz I was always a fan of dominos, they've made some good changes to the pizza and I enjoyed them.  However..tonight is not about the pizza. My kids and there friends didn't want pizza after football practice(they are 14) so they decided on subs/sandwhiches.  I ordered 3 hot subs and an order of pasta.  I was soooo disappointed when I got my order and saw the size of the subs and pasta portion.  So very small, they boys were like...ok, wheres the rest of it.  Seriously, didn't even fill them up.  Ended up having to go to subway for 5 dollar footlongs to fill them up. on the plus side, they said the dominos subs tasted good, just need to be bigger. all in all it was a waste of 30 some odd dollars, well more cuz I had to fork out 15 and some change at subway.

Everyone was hungry so I couldn't get a pic of the full pic but you can see that the pizza was a mess.  Fortunately, it tasted good but people ""eat with their eyes"" so I would prefer the pizza to look normal. Additionally, the crust didn't have the normal garlic flavor on the edge of the crust.

5934603,2015-02-28,1,yDWoMtwZg2PnXlwdUhjp-A,"I loved Domino's after they made changes to their pizza about a year a go. Fyi.. Papa John's sucks!!. Not sure what happened to the Jones Blvd location in the past 2 months.. new management/ employees/ or being told from corporate to cut backs on the amounts of toppings, BUT I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM DOMINO'S AGAIN!!!!!

The pizza about 2 months ago was perfect. Hot, golden brown, crispy crust, dripping with cheese and toppings. The last and final time that I ordered 2 days ago. One pizza was raw. The dough tasted raw and the pizza was not even warm. I decided to give them one more chance 2 days ago and the pizza I that was delivered BARELY HAD ANY SAUCE, TOPPINGS, OR CHEESE. I COULD HAVE WENT TO THE MARKET AND PICKED UP A DIGOURNO PIZZA!!!! IT WAS NOT WORTH $16.00.. IT WAS ALL BREAD!! I gave you 2 more chances Dominos and you officially suck worse than Papa John's!!!!!!. And the girl answering the phones sounds like she just had a bad attitude or really hates her job!!!!. NOT MY FREAKING FAULT!! FIND ANOTHER ONE!!. The only good thing is that the delivery drivers have always been pleasant and the little blonde guy 2 days ago was very polite, professional, and had a big smile. That's why I gave him all of the change from paying for the pizza even though the food was horrible. Hey Corporate!! How about you figure out what happened to this location. It seems like they checked out.",EsVuK8b_WSH-3FHDgob7eA,1,0,1,TXV0QgYTvXUU4_kAJFfyxA
