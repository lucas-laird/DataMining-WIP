The chicken fingers ( delish by the way) were $16 and a bottle of water can run you ~$4. Overall, it is good if you need those last minute items. There is plenty of variety with beverages, snacks, and hot items.",UAIz_L6gOSdLVyfsVVaZ4w,0,0,4,I1ha0KVD4ii41TRBkU6CkA

This is located on the first floor inside the Hilton Grand Vacations next to Circus Circus. 

I stopped in with my cousin so cause I was craving some junk food. There was a bunch of junk food, beer, wine and soda. I also saw a deli where they made sandwiches and salads. On the other side, there was a pizza kitchen. 

I spent $22 on beer and junk food and a yogurt for my cousin. We went up to the room and started watching a DVD. I think we got about 30 minutes into Thor and I phoned in a sandwich order. I got a roast beef sandwich w/pepperjack lettuce and tomatoes. The sandwich was $8.25 and came with a pickle spear and a small bag of chips. The roast beef was fresh and I was very satisfied.

I still want to order a Margherita pizza, but I think I can only fit one slice in my stomach right now.",RJVpaFHx3MwynTM8TNjz0A,8,3,4,h9Xi1GRbnli6mN4v5DFcIQ

1435090,2016-12-13,1,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"The food at this place is very good. A little bit pricey but that's to expected because it's in a resort. I had the pizza and calzone. The only problem with the restaurant is that you can only use card or charge it to the room, you can't use cash. The store has a lot of options from sitting or grab and go. The food at the poolside is good as well.",W8PCus77Hunrmo21Wh98bg,1,2,4,vcz4H-yhJE2nZhZ4EWD0KA
2060786,2015-05-29,0,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"Prices are expensive here and I came in here expecting it to be high and I was right. There are a lot of options and it's very convenient that this store is in the hotel. Perfect for travelers too jet lagged or exhausted to leave the hotel. Sandwiches are expensive and are about $15. Employees are very friendly here, I just was looking for a place that was more affordable. Would've been nice if they had a full service restaurant on property like they do at a Doubletree Hotel.",080VtfX2e2R1I6FT8UGo2w,1,0,2,EyGj4mHoKDSfEXbb9o9QCg
2262633,2018-04-15,0,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"This establishment is located on the bottom floor at the Hilton club resort in Las Vegas. It is the only place at this resort that you can buy any kind of drinks or food while you are staying at this resort. ( unless you are at the bar) I will start off by saying the are very expensive for anything from a bag of chips normally 1.99 in regular stores they charge you 5.99 to soda, even hot food being made to order.  
Customer service is terrible. No hello when serving you, no thank you. So sad for such a nice resort.  When this is your only option while staying here, you need to be forewarned. I waited 10 minutes to pay for a soda my third time there. 
Staff needs a customer service course.",d3RdCKUa-1ZU6rhcyFRDTQ,2,0,3,GzZWeLtkGZtlIq2bRdc63Q
2593550,2017-10-03,3,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"As has been mentioned it's overpriced but this is Vegas and so is just about everything these days.

The issues I had are the employees are rather surly and everything is premade, it's impossible to get anything prepared freshly. Even the coffee was lukewarm and not hot. 

If there was something within walking distance I would have preferred to grab my breakfast there.",uZbIzVlYLu8Etg8wUXyRlQ,10,6,2,-PIhHvV2EUGRn2W6aoyo6g
2721028,2015-06-07,0,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"Cool little spot if you wanna chill at the hotel & grab a snack. They have pizzas, soups, salads, sandwiches, microwavable food, and plenty of snacks. Just know that they close at 1 am & stop serving soup at 11 pm. Lesson learned. Also, it's on the pricier side, but I guess you're paying for the convenience. 

P.S. The meat calzone was pretty good.",8NB_8ts5tdrPl3SRUNOhng,3,1,3,qZmCcKXm0yuDOsJjrRz3aw
3277591,2018-03-28,0,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"The place needs serious help on the prepared food side. The selection is too narrow and the food that does come out is not that good.  Hard to mess up bagels and cream cheese, yet managed to just fine.   Selection of snacks at market is lacking too. The in house ""Tory ranch"" brand of snacks is way too expensive.   Not impressed",MF5kLIEnVMEFdZWTgYO-bg,1,0,2,LMXBWaAh_SuMyu6djJ7uwQ
3395156,2012-07-25,0,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"I was stoked to see there was a deli/pizza/grocery area in our hotel.  I unfortunately wasn't too impressed with it though.  

Pros:
+ Convenient if you are staying at the hotel
+ They have a few necessities should you have forgotten something at home
+ Open late 
+ Lots of sodas/juices/drinks to choose from.
+ Staff is friendly enough.

Cons:
- Very overpriced (yes, its Vegas and most places are overpriced...nevertheless still irritating)
- Wish the deli had a few vegetarian sandwiches on their menu
- No vegetarian premade or microwave food - well except a green salad, that gets so boring to us veg-heads.
- The Cheesecake Factory cheesecake that the deli was selling was super stale tasting.  At $5 a piece for a small portion, I would have thought it would be fresh.  Both the banana foster cheesecake and the red velvet cheesecake we tried were pretty bad. 
- Pretty expensive pizza and it didn't look the best so we skipped it.

This hotel is amazing, but I wish someone could make some improvements to the food assortment and quality in The Marketplace.",vVVlYlOFTVQrh_94NmD-Nw,3,0,2,jbk01GVekO52pNR3u_vR4Q
3728428,2017-05-30,0,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,Overpriced food. Small portions for big price.  The only reason you would eat here is if you're staying at the HGV. It's a beautiful property so at least you can eat your small portioned pricey food in a nice setting. I ordered a wrap (tiny but tasty) and hubby ordered a cheese pizza. It looked and tasted unremarkable.,7hOK_rR41Rkmnu2cpj_3Eg,1,0,2,LK_e5O-aBGA7qPvZshSpXQ

You pay for the convenience. All of the items are very expensive. If you're in need of items like water bottles or a pop tart, do yourself a favor and get them from a Walgreens or outside convenience store instead. It'll be a lot cheaper.",9bZLIEwZsUP262-3bOEsnA,1,0,3,Q0wlLamdoDNFajfB7p1yoQ

Wir haben uns zum Abendessen Sandwiches machen lassen und die waren frisch zubereitet und absolut großartig. Was mir als Bier-Enthusiast besonders gefällt ist die gut sortierte Auswahl und dass man einzelne Flaschen kaufen kann. Sehr bequem wenn man im Hilton gastiert.,2sAFajuVCFW9987fcK0vmA,0,0,4,e0CKX6VR1LtpYTzg9eb3Sg
5157396,2014-09-21,0,2zufEbSI_D8t3WPCgShw-w,"The trick with The Marketplace is to remember that you are in Vegas, at a hotel and that not everything will be super fresh. The coffee is good, the bagels and bagel sandwiches are yummy. They also do drinks, some food and, adult beverages for your room.
Yes, it's more expensive. You pay for the ease of having it right there. We've been happy with the service and our experience.",tKDv7AtVXXWr0fztC8ZxpQ,2,0,4,G1Vihn23Dudj43NxUPkoyQ

The sandwich was not that good, the meat was dry, and microwaved.

The aujus was flavorless.

Go to the grocery store and make your own sandwiches, this place is crazy expensive.  It's ""convenient"" if you don't mind paying $10 for a six ounce bag of chips.",HK7JpmmHw_1N5VEVf9506g,1,0,1,9GJ2PjQtLTvi9HlCK8lwxw
