As I walked back to my car from eating at this establishment I cracked opened my fortune cookie and this is what it said. "" the key to happiness is to lower your expectations""  well... that would have saved this place from a low rating if I would had opened the fortune cookie right before I ate here because I was actually pretty much expecting to totally enjoy my meal.
 I stopped here around 3 pm for lunch on my way to work, I ordered from the lunch special menu the Kung pao chicken with fried rice, noodles and egg flower soup. When I got my order I was the only one there and abut six or seven employees working at the time so I sat on the corner and started eating my food, when one by one all the employees started to came out to the dinning area to have lunch, and no, is not that I mind sharing the dining area with the help, it was just that they brought in their own food, some kind of stew, they placed it on a table and they all started to serve themselves from it. Didn't know what it was I all know is that it looked very delicious and appetizing and that it wasn't on the menu, all of a sudden my Kung pao chicken didn't  looked very good it looked kinda sad on the Styrofoam container, compared to what everyone else was eating,  The vegetables were a little under cooked and the noodles and rice lacked flavor, I don't know what it was missing but whatever it was, it was not missing on their food because they were really enjoying it, so much, I was tempted to ask them if I could trade my food for some of theirs or at least ask them to sprinkle some of that we don't use msg MSG on my plate since it was pretty much tasteless but I didn't want to disrupt their lunch. 
 Would I come back? Sure.. If I get to bring my own food.
 I'm no fortune cookie, so don't rely completely on my advice but if you expect better food, go to panda express instead, and that's as low as expectations can get; after all I live in China town, I may be a little bit spoiled.
 On a positive note, the egg soup was good.....five stars for the chicken that laid the egg.",EG6qatWgJ2WTJnzBCCH_Dg,4,3,3,1VtHswDuWiy8E6BuykvIQg

They are extremely fast and everything I've tried there has been A-OK to Good.  House Special Chicken is great for lunch, and you can get them to kick the spice up a notch.

Recently, I've been ordering the Mu Shu Chicken and was excited to learn you could get that spicy as well.  The hoisin sauce mixed with the chicken, green onions, bamboo shoots and egg is addictive.  I usually order this and forego the tortillas (it also comes with rice), but I have put the chicken in one and it is still just as tasty.

To make their $10 minimum, I usually order something $9.75 then a can of soda for $1.00.  I rarely drink the soda, but I have coworkers who do so for me it's not a big deal.

The chicken wings were so black it looked like it was deep fried 5 times. I called and complained and they advised me that they couldn't do anything about it but send more chicken.  I got the chicken they resent and again it was black and looked like it was deep fried more than 3 times.  There were items missing in my $60 order that they stated on the phone they could not replace.  I took the 2 containers of chicken plus the one item my coworker ordered and went to this place.  I told them the chicken was so disgusting and black.  They told me that was how they cooked their chicken.  They told me over and over again that they put the crab rangoons in the bag with the wontons and I kept telling them that they were not in there.  The staff proceeded to show my pictures on the menu and at that time, I told them all I wanted was a refund.  The lady argued and argued and didn't want refund my money.  I kept telling the lady that I was on my lunch break and couldn't even eat my food because they messed everything up and on top of that, had to drive over there (after I asked for delivery) to return the fried chicken that was black.  China A Go Go was on the ""Dirty Dining"" segment on the news and I will NEVER eat at CHINA A GO GO again! The staff at this location was rude and hesitated to refund my money ( which I got at the end) and yet advised me never to come back...I told her I was never going back and neither were the other 300 employees that I work with.

The customer service here is the absolute worst, and if there was an excuse needed to NOT do their job, I would hope in the future they make a more educated one. If your customer service is that bad at least make the food worth it. Do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.",z-tI_U_XjZsK0Fzse4ISJw,1,0,1,w36Buu1Q7lve0I-zHSnDaQ

- open kitchen
- freshly prepared
- delivered piping hot
- large portions
- very reasonably priced
- close to home
- attentive staff

Great place for quasi-Chinese food.  Much better than Panda Express but not as good as several places in ChinaTown.  Two thumbs up.",0hZfE2He1YssM_wEvKhfcA,1,0,5,C6TRdRzhw1IB4jdw-73gGg

FYI: There sweet and sour chicken has little to no chicken in there.",GzsewIj61htjAr0O0k_dXQ,1,0,3,Mli36e-qXehP8hRgI8248Q

Just ordered delivery. Weren't able to through the app as it said they weren't taking delivery orders now but called and they took my delivery order. Ok. 

Woman was nice enough, took out our order, and it arrived on-time. Man who delivered was nice enough as well, weren't many words exchanged. 

The issue didn't start until we opened the food up. At first sight, everything looked like it had been watered down. Soggy looking orange chicken, almost looked like sweet and sour, and the chow mein and rice was so light-colored with barely any other additives (just all rice and noodles) which didn't quite make me excited to eat them. It looked like a plate of Chinese-food-porridge. 

It tasted as expected from sight. Very unappetizing and I couldn't even finish it. The chicken was soggy, oddly sour and under-seasoned. Noodles were bland, only a faint garlic taste. I felt like I was eating Chinese food at a senior citizen's home. 

So disappointing. In reading the other reviews, I wonder if the owners are just tired or have lost their passion? Everyone said the food used to be good. I'm afraid, big name chains are going to take over this business if they don't step it up. 

I don't care how close it is, you can get food delivery from almost any part of the city now in the same amount of time with all of these other services. We will order elsewhere.

Have been going here for years, however it seems like quality is going down.  Plus when you put in a pickup order and they ask for your phone number, you would think they can just pull up your usual order, we go every 2 weeks or so for the last 5 years.",fTgEneFEeQGmuK0gBetuZQ,0,1,3,_NOJb6wOALxU5vDONfxzIg
