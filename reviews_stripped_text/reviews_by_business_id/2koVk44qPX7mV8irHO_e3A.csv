143736,2017-07-23,0,2koVk44qPX7mV8irHO_e3A,Yes! I do agree with some of the negative feedbacks from Yelpers about this establishment. Their prices can be different from what was mark on the shelves. They even cheated me on the actual weight of the poultry I got. But they do also have some of the most affordable prices around. I m always a supporter for local mom n pop stores. But I will not tolerate dishonesty n bad customer service. Hope they do pick up their acts soon to avoid losing more customers.,o9D90Dr6z27JL6AlivsoFw,2,0,3,Hm5StQ4oQj52izqHjoFuYg

Secondly the cashier was trying to ""multi task"" and was rushing me when clearly there was someone in front me so I had no where to go. I kindly said finish with the lady in front of me then I will sign the receipt and she keeps trying to hand it to me when again the lady is front of me like geez give the lady her space and let her finish. I don't know if I'll be back with that type of service, but it's not like this company will care! Very unfortunate!",Omq89wFlqTc5ZVB7sAnwNA,0,0,1,I-tpUzI4uOfcto9b-uLXZA

She used to get it at Wal-Mart in Iowa so very unusal that our Wal-Mart doesn'thave it.  A very helpful Hawaiian man overheard my mom asking for it at thw Wal-Mart in the same parking lot as The Filipino Market & recommended it to them.  Awesome!

Conveniently located in the same parking lot as Wal-Mart, we drove over & immediately could smell homemade soup & sausage mmm.  We did not find mom's yellow split peas, but we found many other veggies that she uses for her Indian food.  The long beans that they used to grow were there, cassava, plantains, large mangos, & real sweet potatoes not yams.  

After reading the reviews on rude employees, we were surprised!  A woman came out of the kitchen personally asked if we were doing ok.  Then, an elderly man asked us & when we asked about the yellow split peas, he asked another person to help.  Although we didn't find exactly what we were looking for, we were pleased & will be back!",D43OWyfzIQjL8feJpYh2SQ,10,7,5,BcnFJ8R98TKw37kcPFhrfw

2062550,2017-07-30,0,2koVk44qPX7mV8irHO_e3A,This is the place to come for Filipino food. It's a buffet style ALL YOU CAN EAT FOR LESS THAN $10. It's just opened up about a month ago.,O8DGCqEjsh8-PI_GJ3SAmw,0,0,5,y2N46sYfaH0WxNX4mzbLcg

This is a very small Asian market with Filipino Fast Food in the front. I did take a quick look at the fresh fast food and it all look oh so delicious!! If it had been lunchtime I probably would've picked up some of my favorite dishes. Will be back to get some in the near future. 

The store may be small, but they had everything I needed plus more. From your favorite dry snacks to different noodles, some fresh produce (items you can only find in an Asian market), canned items, meats, frozen foods and of course bulk bags of rice. Can't leave without picking up some rice. 

I didn't spend a lot of time in here as I had other errands to run but was helped by the lady running the register. She was very friendly and was able to help me find the ingredients that I needed. 

If you are in the area and need to find something that is probably only available in an Asian Market and don't want to go to Chinatown, this is a good alternative.",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,36,36,4,eLKQv3pGkrEvvnfRs58ahQ

Please work on your communication skills per customer.. love ya and all your items as I'm tired after work to travel all the way back.",Bv093HENjI4slaSOXNt25Q,0,0,3,bTlzwhRdAVcVBnGK4WSIeA
4854848,2016-08-26,0,2koVk44qPX7mV8irHO_e3A,"My family and I are regulars here because of their affordable variety of vegetables they have to make pakbet (Filipino vegetable dish)  and their bitter melon leaves, which no other Asian market place that I know has. They have quite a variety of fresh fish and we usually get the pompano fish, one of my ultimate faves. They have a variety of other foods that you'd normally see at other Asian market places, they're a little pricey, but I guess it's because most of them are imported from the Philippines, so it's reasonable. 

However, their fast food isn't that great I took a star away because of that. My mother's cooking is way better than that. If I were you, I'd try to find somewhere else to eat. Other than that, it's a good place to stock up on Filipino goodies!",_ki_6rb95JA7JFrSRcG_Pw,0,0,4,BvSql6X8ZFfh8VLZAULcVg

They had the price tag right below their papayas at a $1.29#. When i go to pay she says its $3.59 each. Their was no other sign around. Then the cashier at the Deli area starts talking shit in her language. I may not understand but i know she was. 
They would not honor the price which is B.S.
Of course i didn't get it.....never goin to shop there again. So rude....",OtYx4S19RZnLW5pXn4Ybcw,0,0,1,WcIo8rRsdxrB9YZRLxt2sQ
