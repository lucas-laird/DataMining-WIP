When my boss took me here it was really nice looking but I hate places that are too dimly lit so we sat outside. It was nice because we were the only ones in the section. Literally my only complaint could be that the food took too long. It could be, but it won't be. Because when it was taking too long the waiter brought us a free appetizer, a delicious vegetarian lettuce wrap. Then they offered us a free dessert of our choice. I had ordered the chicken sate because that's what I get from everywhere. The chicken was so delicious but the peanut sauce was the best I have ever tasted, nothing else has even come close! I was licking the bowl and wishing it was twice as big. The only thing that I was disappointed by was every time I get this it comes with a cucumber salad and this one came with a regular tiny salad. It's a little pricey but we more than made up for it in free food and even without it it would have been worth it.",OQSya1DStf-2a3o9dcHXug,0,0,5,ONL5qq40AsgJE5Sb69Zwdg

So my Bf and I arrived a lil later on in the night, and the place looked nice...busy, and cozy, but when I saw the prices on the menu ( Which I was warned would be a lil outrageous) I was expecting that the food would be sprinkled in edible gold!! :)
Luckily they had a menu perfect for a couple..a ""prefix menu"" with many different options for under $40. Ok, not too shabby...The waiter was good..my bf drinks like a beast, and his cup was always filled, and my mouth was anticipating our tasty meal...
and then it showed up. 
Honestly, I don't see the hype. I have had BETTER Chinese takeout!!!!!!!! The Lo mein was not very flavorful, the mongolian beef was extra crispy it had turned chewy and stiff,and it was super salty!!! yuck!!! The only dish that attempted to save the meal was the honey shrimp..the shrimp was juicy and fresh! Dessert was our choice of cake shoved in a shot glass, and even that didn't turn my frown upside down ""(
Would I come here again??.... Probably not..unless I wasn't paying for it. And even with that, I would be willing to try new dishes, but I don't feel there is anything worth my $15.95 a dish.",3GRwPwYc8CocrADwlpoXlA,0,0,1,7nICqdOpne9cIZjBv1OmAQ

Half of order was never served and a cocktail set on the serving bar until we had to ask for it again which was after half of meal had already been eaten. The explanation was the bar was busy but we could see the drink setting on the service bar waiting to be served. The explanation for the food was a new menu item and cooks were having problems. Why weren't they trained is my question. In addition we had ordered the same items weeks before at a different PF Chang's with no problem.  How long does it take to train s staff. The whole experience was actually less than one star. We actually left and had dinner at a different restaurant.,sXaPyZdFivZZFnUHxrT8KA,0,0,1,1y0uhtGIiQ3ui2FgYTbzjg

It's like they're using the same secret ingredient for all their food. 

Also, if you're going here... expect delays. It's like the servers hate doing their jobs. It takes them forever to take orders, to give you your check, to clean the tables, etc.  I'm not sure if they're all just being lazy or they're just not properly trained. It's not even busy.

As far as the food goes, it is fake ass, watered down, gentrified, ""Americanized"" faux Chinese food and BORING in every sense of the word. All I could think of when the plates of bland and overpriced, tasteless plates of beef, pork, or whatever the hell it was I ordered was how uninspiring the food in this restaurant was.

tl;dr: Don't eat at PF Changs, there are dozens of other Chinese restaurants in Vegas that are miles better than this place.",gQ6aDsacM0tRTCy33qY_Pg,1,1,1,Izg4FX8p1RAlBw5lq7xDVg

We've eaten in several Chang's around the country and have always found consistently good ambiance, service and food. This won failed at all three. Loud rock music and glaring light from the huge windows showing a not very nice outdoors view was not the usual PF Chang's ambiance. The waiter must have been trained at McDonalds. He did not bring the sauce tray to the table until we asked another waiter. He rushed us through everything, taking the appetizer tray away before we had finished it. When he brought the bill, he stood at the table waiting for us to put the card/cash in the folder. I told him to go away and he looked at me with a glare. The four of us had two different noodle dishes, but the sauce in each was exactly the same and way too much of it. One of our party spent an hour in the bathroom a little later.

464997,2013-05-22,0,Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA,"I've eaten here before and at many other P.F. Chang's love the food and have never felt compelled to write a review one way or the other. The food is good and I have to say it actually is one of my favorite chain restaurants. I have dined at this particular location many times before without incident and experienced quite excellent service, but like I said I am writing this review for a reason. My family dined here last Saturday evening (May 18th) for my Grandmother's 81st birthday. The food was good but the service was some of the worst I have ever experienced. We were a party of 8 so the waiter of course was already receiving the auto 18% gratuity so he seemed like he couldn't care less. he also was clearly stoned off his ass (I'm not knocking I used to be a stoner myself and was dining with a few but I'm just stating facts here). We place our order and a lot of the food came out at different times when my husband and I mentioned that our appetizer did not yet come and the meals had. You could tell that he completely forgot about the appetizer, claimed he put in the order and about 15 minutes after we received our meal, low and behold our appetizer showed up (it was an uncooked appetizer BTW it was more than obvious he forgot). The same thing happened with my sister's appetizer, when she mentioned it you could tell he completely forgot then said, ""Hey man I totally put the in order all at the same time I wish I was back in the kitchen cooking but I can't be they are totally backed up"", in his best stoner/surfer valley girl accent ( I am also a valley girl). The appetizer eventually came at the end of our meal and it was the wrong one and my sister told them to just take it back and off the bill. My grandfather ordered a beer and it was one that only came in a bottle, fine no problem, my husband also ordered a beer at the exact same time, 20 minutes later my husband's beer shows up (draft beer) and my Grandfather's does not, my Grandfather tells the waiter to just cancel it, his response ""Are you sure man it's only gonna take 5 more minutes it's on it's way the bar is just backed up"", (the restaurant is maybe at 60% capacity and the waiter has 4 tables to work, including ours). No just cancel it how does a bottled beer take longer than a draft and why did the first one take 20 minutes to begin with? He clearly forgot until my Grandfather mentioned that he cancel it. My cousin's wine order, 30 minutes. He passed our table and promised to refill our water glasses no less than 4 times, every time saying I'll be right back to refill your water glasses, clearly forgetting to grab the pitcher every time then seeing them he would remember. His shirt was filthy, when he bagged our food he spilled more than half of it down the side of the bag. We had a warrior card that we presented at the beginning of the meal, he told us he would take it for our discount and never did and when he brought the bill which had the beer that never came, the appetizer that was canceled and no discount we had had enough. Now the way I work is I always tip even with bad service, I just tip less. Normally about 10-15% for bad and 20-25% for good but there was no way this guy was getting 18% after all of this . My sister got up to find a manager to talk to them about the bill because we were done dealing with this awful waiter she spoke with the manager the bill was adjusted she took off the 10% for the warrior card the 18% gratuity and comped some drinks, great. Then when my sister was headed back to the table for us to handle the adjusted bill she passed the waiter and he offered to take the bill my sister told him ""no thanks you haven't been much help tonight I got it"" and here's the kicker, he told her to ""f*** off""! So crazy! We didn't report this part to the manager because at this point we could not get out of there fast enough and we had been there over 2 and half hours at that point. What an a$$, little did he know he was just talking himself out of a tip. The bill was adjusted down about $100 and we left a 10% tip on that adjusted bill but had he not been such an ass and told my sis to f*** off we would have left 15% on the original amount and called it a night. If he had said f*** off to me I would have made sure he was fired. He also topped it off with talking shit about us with another table he had just seated right behind us. He had just started off with them and was making the same excuses he had been with us but they had no clue what they were in for, they even joked with him about reporting him to the manager which was clearly a shot at us. The only pleasure I took in that was knowing what shitty service they were in for and how much they would come to regret that comment.

Try to eat on the patio if the weather permits or along the windows facing the strip.  It offers a really nice view at night when everything is lit up.  The overall feel of the restaurant is like any other PF Changs, intimate, loungy, and sleek.  This one in particular was more brightly lit on the inside compared to some I've been to in the past.

The server we had was AWESOME, his name was Melique and I hope I spelled his name correctly.  He deserves an award.  He was knowledgeable, personable, quick, and overall a lot of help.

The only thing I will dock this location for is for leaving an entire round table right next to us dirty for our entire meal, about 1 hour.  The table was covered with food, spilled drinks, crayons, napkins and worst of all right by the front door and next to two occupied tables.  I cannot believe nobody came over to clean it!

The manager comes over (I'm watching the exchange between the hostess, the manager and the waitress and the manager even seemed perturbed) and takes our drink order and then the waitress comes over and takes our order.

Other than the blatant disregard of the waiters and waitress not even attempting to assist us although they saw us sitting there the food was still delicious",GzF0-y_wp-mn1dGnvBFKyA,0,0,3,l-4IeUO3VJjQiW_oNnZ5iw

We wanted to try something different and I browsed Yelp for nearby restaurants with Asian flair. PF Chang kept coming up so we went here.
The bar stood out when I first arrived, it was actually very pretty and well stocked and the restaurant itself was immaculate and clean. We were seated immediately and our server arrived promptly and took our drink orders.
Our server was one of the nicest, coolest servers ever. I don't recall his name but he mentioned being from a small town in Illinois, very nice and tended to us quite well. When the service is good, you know the food will match the service as well.
Indeed the food was spectacular!
We started with lobster avocado rolls, we were so hungry and they were gone within minutes, haha.

Came here for the happy hour menu at 5 PM. Got seated very quickly and perused the menu for a moment. Our waitress was very nice and was good at explaining what exactly was in the dishes so I could make sure what I was ordering was vegetarian (some vegetarian items on the menu do not have the symbol next to them, I think because of egg ingredients). I ended up ordering the vegetarian lettuce wraps for $5, veggie spring rolls for $3, and crispy green beans for $4, and also a red velvet cake sweet shot for $2. Everything came out very quickly and it was delicious. I had never had the green bean fries before and they were insanely good. Green beans fried lightly in a light, crunchy batter with a mayo-based sauce that totally kicks the shit out of your tastebuds, because at first it's nice and tasty and then BAM! SPICY! But these things are crazy addictive and the price was very nice. 

What is even nicer is that I am a Warrior card member, which gives me 10% off everything, including Happy Hour prices (only until June 31st, however). A great deal for a great meal of appetizers. Our drinks were filled consistently, and the server even boxed up my food for me at the table, and brought out extra fry sauce for me to take home. This was an exceptionally nice visit and I am always glad to come here, even though my fortune cookie (wisely) told me to be frugal.

Both times my wife and I ordered some dishes spicy. Both times the dishes came out very bland.

First night the waitress had no social skills. Right after we sat down she was impatient and she wanted us to choose our orders right after we sat down, who does that? Business wasn't booming.

Second night the waitress was much better. Even though the food came out bland again, she at least asked how the food was and offered to get it fixed. She was also very attentive to our needs and was always refilling our water glasses.

I have been to the PF Chang's in San Diego several times and have loved the food each time. Either there is a disconnect and a communication breakdown between the waitresses and the cooks, or the cooks are not preparing the food properly, or the waitresses aren't putting in the orders correctly.

Anyways, I am rambling: the summation is: the food was not tasty.

Chinese food is supposed to be bursting with flavor, even if it's not necessarily a great flavor...it's not supposed to be bland. It's not supposed to be expensive either...but I could deal with that if the food was good.

This was probably the worst PF Changs I have been to in any regard.

But I spare the criticism of our waitress the second time, Janelle. She was solid, attentive and competent. Also, she had social skills and I think she was cute as a button.",QXe15dj_EXATV5zVeEou1g,0,0,2,I-yxMnHjz7LMJ7FI6UoSXg

My friend ordered dumplings in which they were out, so she got the eggrolls instead.

My soup finally came, and our food was served a little bit after, she did come back to ask us how our food was but failed to ask us if we wanted refills on our drinks, my gf didn't but I did!

That being said, service was attentive, friendly, prompt and accommodating on all fronts.  Woo hoooo!  Great first impression there. 

What we gulped and noshed ...

COCKTAILS:
Coconut Lemon Sour - One of their signature cocktails. Light and delicious!
Chang's Mai Tai - Tall, balanced, tropical and gooooood.

STARTERS:
Lettuce Wraps - Their signature item ... Light and flavorful!
Dynamite Shrimp -  Light and crispy coating in a delicate yet spicy sauce! YUMMM
Egg Drop Soup - Flavorful and comfortiing!
Hot & Sour Soup - Dark and rich!
TIP: Ask for a side of the fried wonton sticks to add to your soup.

ENTREES:
Mongolian Beef - Excellent carmelization on the beef adds to deliciousity! 
Sweet & Sour Pork - Very Good, although I prefer a more intensely flavored sauce.
Scallops - Spicy and tender with a slightly crisp char. Fabulous!

Will definitely return to try more!",k8CwFA5FbQ24kbmSR7u-eA,2,1,4,0nQfy6lnPzgf64RXYWVDRw

PF's before and had the wrap that everyone raves about - not my taste at all. So, a couple of friends and I went the other night. I decided that if I couldn't find a healthy (IMHO) vegan offering, I'd have water only. To me, healthy is NO sodium and NO fat added. Basically impossible to order that from any menu at any restaurant. PF had nutritional info listed on-line. One, and only one, dish fit my bill. But, it's one more than most restaurants. Buddha's Delight. Brown rice and steamed vegeys. Nothing else added. Exactly what I needed and was looking for. Healthiest (for me) meal yet. My buds enjoyed their meals and I enjoyed mine. Staff was courteous and friendly and efficient. If it pleases my friends as well as my taste buds AND it has a vegan AND healthy offering, how can I give it anything but 5 stars?",dA7smMo-z6VNmgNzyd640Q,0,0,5,_V7ENymDd5A16jgyMx65-w

The only problem with everything PF Chang's has to offer would be the price.  Yes, we pay for everything: the food, ambiance, and service. My friends were out there for a late night dinner. We happened to sit next to two groups of people celebrating birthdays.  The first table started to sing Happy Birthday.  10 minutes later, they left.  Five minutes after we finished eating, the other group started to sing Happy Birthday.  It was a trip. 

I wanted something simple, since I was at the restaurant Nobu earlier with friends at the Hard Rock Hotel.  Had the ginger chicken with broccoli for the entree with brown rice.  My other 2 friends had the exact same thing, which was the honey walnut shrimp with white rice.  One friend opted for 2 bowls of ice cream and a cup of expresso.  I didn't have anything else.  

I have my reservations of this place, since this place is expensive.  Granted that this place is kind of better than stereotypical Chinese restaurants, it is pricey. You get what you pay for.",1wE7oHKgNOLPM0QWS3jm9w,0,0,3,hEo9vgEr6h0lS-wVfxQqOQ
1969417,2017-08-03,0,Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA,"Decided to come here with my family on last Sunday night. The place was busy and there were 2 groups ahead of us but we were still told the wait was only 10-15 minutes. My husband asked if they needed his name and was told no, that they'd just grab us when a table was available. Both parties ahead of us were seated quickly and a few minutes later I hear ""Luis, party of 3"" we didn't move because she never took our name and my husband isn't Luis. The hostess said it again this time looking right at us and she seemed irritated. I said we're not Luis and you didn't take our name, she then proceeded to wave us to follow her. I must admit, the place looks run down. Our table looked dirty and the rail behind us was filthy and greasy with finger/hand prints all over it...yuck!

I think allowing the hostess to wear whatever is very unprofessional and the servers don't look very good either. 

Our server was extremely polite and when I explained my son has a nut allergy he assured us there were no nuts in anything we ordered (chicken lettuce wraps, tempura cauliflower-awesome, honey sesame chicken, Mongolian beef and sweet and sour chicken-gross barely ate it and still paid for it). 

The food was good except the sweet and sour, skip it by all means...they were out of the beer my husband ordered which was disappointing. Oh and when we arrived there were a bunch of crackheads tailgating in the parking lot and using a bucket as a toilet, when we were leaving there were homeless people camped out of the other side of the fence getting ready for bed...dirty restaurant + unsafe parking lot = never coming back to this location. 

I only came here because we were at the mall and it was close, I usually go to the Boca Park location which is much cleaner and no crackheads/homeless people in the parking lot.",1KbE1qHhVHIdDucYGtfaJA,0,0,2,AtB91De-4sLdWU26BLwy_Q

2049773,2017-02-12,0,Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA,"We arrived around 4pm on Friday, 2/10/17, sat at the bar and were immediately greeted by a friendly bartender named Shelby.  My partner and I ordered appetizers from the Happy Hour menu; pot stickers, lettuce wraps, egg rolls, chicken satay, and cauliflower tempura. To drink, I had an ice tea and my partner ordered a sangria.

All 5 appetizers arrived within 7 minutes of ordering, lightening fast service.  The pot stickers, egg rolls and lettuce wraps were great, as expected.  The chicken satay disappointed in that it had an extreme lemon flavor that was very distracting and the peanut sauce was not what I remembered and did not have that traditional ""peanut-y"" flavor. 

The cauliflower tempura however was the star!  Lightly battered and perfectly spicy, it was truly an epicurean delight! This appetizer is in my top 5 of all time.  WTG P.F. Chang's!

Then this happened...

While eating, a man sat down at the bar, a few stools away from us and I immediately knew he was a problem by the things he was saying to the bartenders.  He did not prove me wrong, within 2 or 3 minutes, he got up, approached me, and began asking questions and making statements, all of which were completely inappropriate.  After asking him nicely to leave me alone at least 4 times, I started raising my voice at which point he finally started to back away and returned to his seat.  This was not without him continually making inappropriate comments and using expletives. I repeatedly and loudly told him to stop talking to me which eventually caught the attention of a manager who approached him.  I said nothing after the manager arrived, thinking he would eliminate the problem immediately.  Instead, the manager entertained the psychotic rant right there at the bar while the insults continued flying in my direction from this individual that I've never before seen.  After what felt like an eternity (a good 5 minutes), he was finally escorted outside where the manager continued entertaining this craziness right in front of the main entrance.  While this was going on, all of the servers and bartenders apologized profusely and made sure we were ok.  

When the manager finished his ""conversation"", he came to me and asked if I was alright, going on to say that it took him a few minutes to realize this man had problems. A few minutes? The insults and inappropriate comments as he approached the bar weren't enough of a clue?  Knowing the manager has no control over the words and actions of other people this was not his fault.  That being said, he did allow the situation to continue for far too long at the detriment of us enjoying not only our food, but the atmosphere too.  The manager never even apologized for my dining experience being, at minimum, interrupted.  He joked about the close proximity to the Las Vegas strip and the unsavory characters that attracts; this was a poor attempt to make light of the situation.

The bartenders and kitchen staff offered superb service and created delicious food.  Management, on the other hand, not only failed to defuse a bad situation in a timely manner, but allowed it to perpetuate before finally acting on it appropriately; all without so much as an apology.  This ruined an otherwise great time.  I am giving this encounter with P.F. Chang's 3 stars by averaging food score (5 stars) with overall tone/atmosphere (1).

These events will not deter me from returning, I very much love P.F. Chang's. However, being a seasoned customer service manager myself, the lack of strong leadership skills, humility, and possessing the empathy necessary to be a leader was disappointing.",WXuyC8C3szmJ_b8Lvx5S3A,2,0,3,uzCZV_mkBV_9BcaAIdKFdA

I came to this location on a Wednesday night around 9:30 and let the hostess know I wanted to place an order to go. She directed me to the end of the bar to place my order which was taken fairly quickly and I was offered water while I waited for my food. I didn't notice the time, but I didn't feel I waited longer than you would expect to wait for food to be made. I ordered the GF lemon chicken with brown rice and the chocolate dome. The chicken was still warm and crunchy (not soggy like I was afraid it might be) by the time I made it back to my hotel room only about a half mile down the road. I dumped the rice next to the lemon chicken and broccoli, poured some of the lemony sauce and some of the gluten free soy sauce they sent home with me over the rice and enjoyed every bite using the chopsticks I found in my takeout bag (also in the bag was a plate, fork/napkin combo and 2 fortune cookies that I was warned were NOT gluten free, but everybody should have the opportunity to at least read their fortune even if they don't eat the cookie). 

The chocolate dome is a dense, fudgy, flourless chocolate blob (it was actually a very nice round shape vs a true blob) that by itself is ok. Topped with the berry sauce and eaten with the raspberries, blueberries and strawberries it comes with is what made it really good. I ate my whole entrée and the whole freakin' blob when I probably should have stopped about half way through both. I'd definitely like to visit the Salt Lake location and try something else.

If you are vegan, run away!! There is nothing vegan here (except one thing but I'll get to that later) despite what you might have on the vegan blogs and PETA. 

I am vegan and I came thinking I could get a deliciously cooked meal, but boy was I wrong. As I always do, I asked the waitress if the foods I saw recommended to vegans online were in fact vegan. She said she wasn't sure so she brought the manager over to chat. He kindly told me that nothing on the menu was vegan but that they would be able to steam up some veggies for me. Not very exciting but it was something. I had steamed veggies without any seasoning or sauce and a bowl of rice. At least I was ""healthy"" heh heh. 

Saving grace: the service was A+ and the manager was super kind and apologetic. I appreciate the knowledge that the manager showed regarding the vegan diet.

Asked a third time, I finally got him to slow down and listen. But attitude was unnecessary...felt like I was inconveniencing him asking for something else. No one pre bussed my plates. I had to move them around Tetris-style to sign my credit card slip. May want to rethink late night schedule as it was definitely apparent that they need more bartenders during late night to prevent the rushing and impatience with people tipping you.

First time I've ever been to P.F. Chang's! And gotta say the experience was great. Our server was exceptional. They started off by giving us a refreshing dragon oolong tea. Not the biggest fan of oolong but it was a unique blend of sweetness and a mild leafy taste. Try it, it surely impressed me. The atmosphere feels classy with the dim lighting, rounded seating and marble-like flooring. The food was satisfying but not without its flaws. Many of the dishes were salty, especially the soup. After a few spoonfuls I couldn't even finish it. The kung pao chicken was so salty it's hard to eat after a few pieces. The honey shrimp was obviously not salty and sweet rather, as it should be :) Thankfully the shrimp made up for the meal but I had to mentally make a note for less salt next time.

I dropped my dad (who is 87 years old) off at the front door upon arrival. Their parking lot is large with no lights. A perfect place for thugs.  

I was approached by a woman the first time, asking for money. She scared the sh-- out of me because she came from nowhere, and thankfully I had the instincts to go the other way and move fast. When I got inside I told the hostess there was a woman loitering. 

When my dad and I left, I had him wait for me, and I looked in the parking lot to be on the safe side and there was no one around.

I was about a foot away from my car and a man appeared from no where and was a about 6 feet in front of me. I quickly got in my car and locked the doors and he was yelling and screaming absurd things to me. 

I picked up my dad, rushed him into my car, warned the folks getting out of their car and snapped a photo of him. 

 I called the restaurant and spoke to the MGR and told him about both incidents. Sadly the food and service is great here, but I would never risk my safety for PF Changs! They need security, valet, and a well lit parking lot unless you are ok with being approached by thugs and ready to defend yourself.

We weren't disappointed in the offerings.  The soup to start was mild, the spicy offerings were not as hot as expected.  

I should try the lettuce wraps next time, but I was hungry for heavier fare and had the Chang's spicy chicken.

Vinegar seems to the be the main ingredient here, and was disappointing unless you consider the odors I left wandering around the strip.

Avoid the spicy chicken.  Not very good.

The spring rolls were very standard fare, and I would much prefer the Vietnamese spring rolls served up at our local dim sum restaurant.

This seems to be a very ""Americanized"" version of chinese food, and despite having nice condiments ( sesame oil was a nice touch ) it doesn't make up for the sterile flavoring and overcompensation of vinegar put in the dishes.",9G2MgXv20YKLjI2Fka2uKQ,0,0,3,hL9EluRHz5Vzx0jVbk2XUA

Eating at P.F. Chang's is like taking an introductory class in Chinese food.  For those that don't know authentic Chinese or asian food, this place is a great start for new palates.  It doesn't try to be authentic so you shouldn't go in assuming to have true home cooked meals here.  

The focus for them is clean ""up-scale"" atmosphere and consistent dishes across all their restaurants so that people from the mid-west  (or where ever people live that have never tried Asian cuisine) can feel comfortable and get a great meal.   Then when a restaurant pops up in Cheyenne WY or Troy, Mich., you have instant success (just an example)... I've been to other PF's and this one still surpasses others in flavor, but for those of you that know authentic food, this still doesn't stack up.  

I give it three for those that are looking to dabble in new things Chinese and get a familiarity to some of the tastes and styles, then once their ""feet are wet"" start getting adventurous... in no time you'll be asking for sea cucumber and birds nest soup (well maybe not that adventurous ;)",dheeM9UTMy9HyBWHh1ePQA,0,0,3,cLYqXAaDXm6KpuRrBYKllg

3520293,2016-02-03,39,Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA,"This P.F. Chang's is usually pretty busy on the weekends. I don't come to this one all that often anymore since we have a couple other locations away from the Strip. Another reason is the parking lot. Being near the Strip there is a lot of foot traffic that walks around this P.F. Chang's and through the parking lot. I had a gift card and since hubby and I were nearby this location we decided to pick up some food to-go for dinner. After pulling in and finding a spot to park, we both opened our car doors to get out and 2 females quickly approached both sides of our car and asked for money and or cigarettes. There was also a guy in a wheelchair that I saw on the way inside who was holding a sign asking for money. Given the popularity of this location even after all of these years, I would think P.F. Chang's would have a security guard outside to help keep the customers who are patronizing the business safe or at least feel that way. 

Kung Pao Chicken Jicama Street Tacos ($7.50) - Chicken that is wok-tossed in chili sauce with Fresno peppers and chopped peanuts accompanied by cucumbers. You get jicama shells to stuff the deliciousness in and the menu says it comes with 3 per order, but honestly they have always given me about 4 or 5 at any location I have ordered them from. Make sure if you are ordering to-go that you request the jicama shells be put on top of the chicken or in a separate container so they don't get soggy. The cucumber is put on the side since it's cold and I personally love the fresh taste it adds to the chicken, but it can be left off if that isn't your thing. I get this almost every time and am so glad they added it to the menu and hope it stays because it's so tasty!

Chang's Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($9.25) - Chicken, mushrooms, green onion and water chestnuts make up this dish that has been a popular favorite by many for years. Oh, yes it also comes with those crispy rice sticks, but I don't like those and request they be left out. They forgot this last time and it wasn't underneath the chicken thank goodness, so eating around it wasn't an issue. I always ask for extra lettuce cups and they are added at no additional charge. The chicken lettuce wraps are something my hubby and I both really enjoy and the portion of chicken is generous which is why extra lettuce cups are needed. The lettuce is put in a plastic baggie so the stay cold, crisp, fresh and ready to be filled with that chicken goodness. 

Chicken Fried Rice ($9.75) - This is supposed to have rice tossed in soy sauce with egg, carrots, bean sprouts and scallions. I requested the bean sprouts be left out and they wasn't the only thing that ended up being missing from the dish. The rice wasn't tossed all the way through with the soy sauce, some of the rice was crunchy, the carrots were sliced bigger than usual and off to the side instead of tossed with the rice and there were no scallions. Some of the egg was overcooked. There was maybe 4 pieces of chicken in the rice and I paid more to have meat in the dish (the veggie rice is cheaper). The rice was a major fail.

Chicken Lo Mein ($10.50) - Noodles tossed in soy sauce with chicken. This dish usually comes tossed with veggies, but I prefer my noodles ""plain"" which just means noodles and sauce without the rabbit food. The noddles were delicious and at first I wondered where the chicken was and then after giving the noddles a toss with my fork I was pleased with the amount that was under the noodles. Much different than I experienced with the fried rice! 

Chocolate Raspberry and Sweet Vanilla Cream Wontons (2 for $3.50) - Chocolate and raspberry filling inside a wonton that is dusted in powdered sugar on one side makes for one tasty treat! I wish the wonton wasn't overcooked a tad, but the chocolate and raspberry filling was very good! You get some fresh raspberries on the side and one each of chocolate and raspberry sauces. Dip your wonton in both it's good! The inside of the vanilla cream was supposed to have a vanilla cream cheese flavor and if they meant vanilla = bland they sure accomplished that. The wonton was way overdone and crispy and the filling really lacked flavor. The chocolate and raspberry wontons were much better and the perfect small bites after eating a big meal for dessert.

I had a great day going: wonderful breakfast at my hotel, hung out at the pool for a bit, went to The Little White Wedding Chapel & got married, then to PF Chengs for our ""reception"". 
My brand new wife wanted to go, and although I wasn't crazy about going to a chain restaurant, I don't think we could have topped it! There were 8 of us, only 2 had been to a PFG before. Josh, the waiter made some very helpful suggestions & the food was excellent!!
Josh was probably the best waiter I've ever had. The drinks kept coming & the food was not only perfectly prepared, but timed just right as well. We were all hungry when we got there, and were soon munching on the awesome fried green beans & having the best egg drop soup I've ever had.

I ordered the green beans, the hot and sour soup and ahi salad. Honestly, I could have done without all of these items. Super average and overpriced.

So this place with self parking on Paradise and Flamingo is easy in and out.

However, it made me very happy that I was there.  

My server tonight was Tiffany and I give her a big shout out. We got into a very interesting conversation about the food and its origins. She was helpful and really seemed to want to be there and create a good customer experience. 

I had the combination fried rice and the shrimp with lobster sauce. Both were excellent by any standard.  They have a 1.5 glass of wine for a fair price.  I don't know what else to look for in a restaurant. I had a great time.

That said, I have had some great experiences at the Spring Mountain Road restaurants.

Food is perfection.  Buddha's Feast (veggies) stir fried spicy is as good as it gets!  Kung pow's are all great.  The rice is sticky and tasty.  Nice ambiance and decor.  Waiter/waitress very nice and helpful.  If your in a rush, it's quick.  Close to Las VEgas Blvd. so very convenient.

My server said we can make them for you still. Made me happy. I always have left overs so before you judge. I take a lot home. Tomorrows lunch is going to be awesome!

 I ordered egg rolls which were blah. The rolls weren't fresh and I can tell because normally I have to cut them in half to cool because they are steaming hot. This time they were barely warm and the sauce had a strong mustard flavor and sent. I do not recommend the egg rolls. 0/5 I would have sent them back but I was starving and I learned a long time ago never send food back unless it's under cooked.

Calamari: was lukewarm and tasted like fish sticks. Enough said. 

Rice: was dry and al dente... at an asian restaurant.

Orange peel shrimp: was the best dish, owing to its sugary sauce and only being slightly overcooked. The the orange rind tasted the opposite of fresh... I literally imagined oranges in a pile of two-day old trash being scooped up by the cook. It wasn't nearly as good as the same dish a couple years ago at another Changs.

Mongolian beef: tasted like shards of a tire. The green onions were offensive, inedible and awkward.

Ginger ale: watered down.

Desserts: in my haste to depart, I ordered the one dish I could remember: mini-desserts, aka, sweet baby food for adults. One or two layers of this crap actually tasted edible, if only in small concurrent quantities.

This spot reflects on Americans' taste in food the way the WCW... u get the idea. Quality of all chain restaurants seems to experience the same sad decline that has befallen applebees, the olive garden, et al.--which threw quality under the bus for profit margins.

The Mongolian Beef was way over cooked, about as brittle and bad as that Panda Express ""Beijing Beef"" crap. My friend's order of shrimp with snow peas was typical and nothing special, something I could have got for half price at a Chinatown dive.  My other friend ordered fried rice, which I didn't try because I prefer white rice. Didn't look like anything special, just filler for the mid-section. PFC does offer brown rice as well. 
My friend is Asian (Korean) which surprised me, because most Chinese don't eat fried rice at all, or if they do, they are just making something out of leftover rice and other dishes at home. I thought only non-Asians ordered fried rice in the restaurant? Well, I take it back, at Panda's I order half noodles, half fried rice, because it ir right there in front! 

Once again, if you like poorly represented Chinese food in a well decorated environment with a lot of other non-Chinese, and want to pay more for it, this is the place America loves! 

It still cracks me up when the waitress asks us if we need help ""mixing"" the sauces for us! As if they were exotic and strange somehow! 

Uh, the three ""Exotic"" sauces are: Chinese mustard, Red Chili paste, and Soy Sauce! The same stuff you get in disposable condiment packets at Panda Express. And she saw us using our chopsticks already! (Do they ask people if they need help with chopsticks, too?)

I think they should only ask the mixing sauces question if 
A) the people aren't Asian and 
B) they are using forks and 
C) they seem clueless about things in little glass jars that they normally get in little plastic packets!",UVxY0iyPaqY7s4BSFtt-xA,5,3,2,ZWNbqJqbeU3NYW9rkeHK1w

A nice outdoor patio, long bar and of course the dining room. Lots of TVs to catch the games and the service is TOPS!

The food is good, they serve large entree portions small starter portions and the SOUP is ginormous!!

We ordered some egg rolls and crab wontons for starters!!

Fantastic!! Crispy and creamy wontons and the sauce was great too.Plum I think.

They bring you al the sauces and pastes. 

We then ordered entrees-Sweet n Sour Chicken, Combo Fried Rice(Shrimp,Pork and Beef) plus the asian marinated new york strip steak with mushrooms and asparagus.

The food was great, the steak maybe a little overcooked-I like it more on the RARE side. The rice,vegetables,chicken and everything was great.

My only knock on this place....when the bill came for 32 adults 1 kid it was $70!!!! For chinese food I think thats alittle much for me.

I'll definitely be ordering some of the fried rice to go in the future though!!",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,1,1,3,2usjU_LAMiZDQz_YyW7EWQ

READ: For all CES attendees 2015, please do not frequent this establishment. Go to Cioppino's (sp?) just down the block - half price, three times the food (and they actually will fulfill your order).

The context:

I called PF Chang's to-go # after a long day of travelling. I waited forty minutes, which wasn't a big deal, and arrived on time. This is on Sunday, January 4th at 8:40pm.

At 9:10 (yes, thirty minutes after I was supposed to be out the door with my food) the bartender told me she ""just entered it into the system.""

Honestly, this is what happens when a chain centralizes ordering.

I have never had such a cold staff respond to my very even-tempered feedback that it is unacceptable to be thirty minutes late - and not to fulfill an order! I mean, I was just SITTING there for thirty minutes and no one followed up??

My boss loves this place, and since he was paying, I wasn't going to argue.  The decor is nice, and is a big change from the kitschy overdone look of lots of ""Chinese"" restaurants.  

Let's break down the whole experience, in order.

Valet parking is offered (free), but the lot isn't all that big, so I don't see the point.  I'm not so lazy that I can't walk the 50 yards from my car to the door.

The hostess had a look on her face that seemed to say we were interrupting her day.  She was not even remotely cordial.  I didn't catch her name.  The table was clean.

Our waitress was the highlight of the whole experience.  She was friendly, ""got"" my boss's weird sense of humor, and never approached the table with questions while we were chewing, though she did interrupt a conversation twice to joke with us.

We ordered egg rolls to start.  When they came out, there was oil from the fryer literally pooled on the plate under them.  When we bit into them, they were still cold on the inside.  Ugh!  Cold, greasy eggrolls!  The waitress apologized, told the manager, and we were sent out another order.  These were still really greasy, but at least they were warmer inside, though still not really hot.  The manager didn't show up at the table, which in my opinion a manager should ALWAYS show up if there's a problem with the food.

The boss ordered Mongolian Beef, and I got Sichuan Scallops.  He said his entree was what he expected, but nothing to rave about.  My scallops were very tender, and just the right level of spicy.  The servings of rice with the entrees were inadequate.

The waitress was really on top of soda refills, and was very quick with the check.  She got a nice tip (25%) but we suggested they put their cooks through a retraining course.  

Typical of what I expect from large chain ""Chinese""restaurants.",L9Ku-DGCPPZzXGitQCSylw,0,0,3,DKie220pO6E3GO1mPYIC6w

In general, P.F. Chang's often has a long wait, but I find it worth it for some of the best vegetarian fried dumplings in the world.  The spring rolls are not so great, so skip them, but sampling most anything else should prove tasty.  They offer a good selection of vegetarian dishes, filling salads, and several other entrees that would get dubbed ""California Chinese"".

Perfect for sharing or enjoying on your own. 

Since we were there, we also ordered a round of lettuce wraps and Chang's spicy chicken. The wraps had a little burn flavor and we got the inside of the lettuce instead of the larger outside pieces. :(

The chicken was so tasty and we had both white and brown rice. The diet coke was delish and served up all you can drink.

We went for their happy hour and definitely ordered way too much food! We were starving. We started with a cup of soup each, not on the happy hour menu but It was only 3.95 for a cup. I had the won ton and he had the hot and sour. We really enjoyed them. I like the fact that the soup came out piping hot. I hate, I mean I really hate when I get a lukewarm soup!!

 Off the happy hour menu we ordered Lettuce wraps of course, always refreshing. My husband really liked their steamed dumplings, we ordered pork and shrimp. Shrimp was my favorite. I really loved the dynamite shrimp, I think it was my favorite!  They were too spicy for my Andrew, I found them perfectly delicious! We also got egg rolls which were good, not great. The spare ribs I really liked and my 6 year old thought they were yummy (we ended bringing her food home, like I said way too much food) but my husband doesn't like star anise much and you can really taste it in the ribs. FYI, we had the wet ones not the five spice rubbed. Lastly, we got crab won tons. I like the filling, slightly sweet, cream cheesy and a hint of crab. The dipping sauce that came with them is pretty good, too.

To drink I got the Chinese 88 Martini but opted Bombay Sapphire instead of Plymouth. They let you do that free of charge. I really liked it. I asked my bartender not to make it too sweet. She was great and attentive and so was the bar back. So we were happy with service.  My husband had the Asian Pear Mojito and he really liked it as well.  He then had a Grey Goose on the rocks, not on happy hour but for roughly 11.00 it was a really hefty pour and we appreciate that!

All and all we enjoyed our meal. Such a great happy hour!",yvAYprNnakItO2O4zjDHtw,1,1,4,K4U2wwr5lDYdbZ-p-z12Ug

If you go into a 'Vegas restaurant and the employees don't wear name tags, expect tourist trap attitude. You can't report them on the company website and they know it.
A manager that let's this happen won't do anything anyway.

Food just OK and same as any other PF Changs with low quality, tough cuts of meat, stale rice, and not a lot of options for a group because of the price-fixe, pick 2 item for 2 policy.

5838064,2012-10-10,1,Ch3HkwQYv1YKw_FO06vBWA,"This is my first review of this P.F. Chang's.  I'm happy to report that they tend to be consistent.  Heading out to California, we just made the dining room with less than half an hour to spare before closing time, and were the last diners sitting.  So, we closed the place, which I learned can have some nice advantages--like all the cups of Hot & Sour Soup you want, and larger food portions than normal.  It's a choice inside the kitchen between discarding extra food or giving it to remaining diners.

So, Diane and I very much enjoyed sipping fragrant Ginger Peach Tea in dainty white teacups as we worked our way through our Four-Course Prix-Fixe meals.  The Hot & Sour Soup with strips of pork was hot and great.  I was willing to pay extra for more, but didn't have to.  

Salt & Pepper Calamari Strips resting on a bed of hard white Rice Noodles were good but a bit hard themselves.  The spicy Bean Sauce that accompanied this appetizer was tasty, and, surprisingly, so were the Rice Noodles.

Then, while Diane savored her Crispy Honey Shrimp, which was sweet and succulent (when I report on the taste of a dish, I have always sampled it myself, rather than just adopting a fellow diner's words--even a wife's), I delighted in the really meaty and chewy Pepper Steak that was served with more fluffy Steamed White Rice than we could handle.  But the viscous, flavorful sauce got really spicy at the end of the meal.  It's a wonder we got to our home in southern California without a rest stop!

We finished with two mini-desserts.  My Triple Chocolate Mousse Mini Dessert  featured three different types of delicious chocolate mousse poured and set in distinct vertical layers, and was simply great.  It was fun to dig to a new level, and soon afterward be greeted by a fresh chocolatey taste sensation.  Our spacious booth was comfortable, and our server, Michael, was very accommodating and proactive through the entire duration of our late dinner.  Filled water glass replacements showed up ahead of need.  Even the music had a nice beat to it.  And the tab for food for two was under $40--a great deal!  So, we walked out happy.

I remember that I always enjoyed the garlic noodles so I knew this was a must on our most recent visit. We also got some spicy chicken, eggplant, garlic spinach and fried rice. The food was ok and my memory hadn't failed me. The garlic noodles were again my favorite dish. The chicken and eggplant were entirely too sweet for my taste. The fried rice was ok and so was the spinach, but I was hoping for more garlic flavor. I wish I only ordered the garlic noodles and if I ever come again (which isn't likely) I would stick with them again. 

Service was ok. Our server was attentive at first but when a large party came in refills became a little more infrequent. He apologized and tried to be as attentive as possible, which we appreciated.
