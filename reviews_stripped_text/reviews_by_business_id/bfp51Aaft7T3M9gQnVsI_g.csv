Prices are inexpensive for a 'nice' restaurant entrees are around $25-$30 which includes an excellent house salad and includes some vegetables with the entree which make the side dishes optional. This along with the dated but nice interior and very good service creates an impression of a great value for an upscale dinner.

Food however was inconsistent. The prime rib, probably one of the safer bets, was okay. They say it is dry aged but there is nothing in flavor or texture that distinguishes it. It was okay, a good value for the price. On the down side the lobster bisque was horrible. It was made with a heavy hand: thick, floury, salty with no hint of lobster. Diver scallops were a mistake. Scallops were rubbery and TOTALLY flavorless, probably the worst I have ever had. Sauce was very good but not enough to save the dish.

It may be okay if you go for the beef without expecting anything special. The prices are pretty indicative of the food quality.",UB1tiADKTSRoKdmnXhvpxw,0,0,3,hxh59xujATyieCkY2tNXcQ

We had tickets to see a show at the Orleans and needed a place close by for dinner.  We decided on Canal Street although we were a bit apprehensive about this hotel steak house. 
 
My husband and I eat out a lot, and consider ourselves to be pretty well-versed on restaurants in general.  May I say we were absolutely shocked at the exceptional food, beginning with a fantastic Old Fashioned, the well rounded and reasonably priced wine list and friendly and attentive service.  Can Canal Street be compared to Sinatra at the Wynn?  As far as ambience, no.  As far as food and service, yes.  As far as the bill at the end of the meal, HELL NO!  Yes, we also dined at Sinatra but we feel we ate an equally wonderful meal complete with cocktails, a great bottle of wine and -- a much more palatable bill at Canal Street.

I started off with a wedge lettuce salad which was dressed with fresh diced tomatoes, bacon and blue cheese.  Absolutely beautiful.  My husband had the caesar salad prepared table side and it, too, was just delicious.  For entrees, I ordered the mixed grill trio consisting of steak, scallops and shrimp over a bed of risotto.  Absolutely great.  My husband had the chicken scallopini  which was not only delightfully tender but tasty.  

We were just too darn full to order the bourbon bread pudding, which kept passing us by on the trays of the servers headed to other tables.  Boy, did that bread pudding look just killer!  Next time for sure.

One nice thing definitely not to miss at Canal Street.  We were seated in front of the wall-long painted mural with a Southern theme.  As the evening progressed, we noticed that the mural lighting changes from morning to night.  It is absolutely beautiful and fun to watch. Ask for a booth facing this serene and pretty wall.",L5J8bVNKjJ5z5AWHytAE8w,0,0,5,UgQEJcoYRwBbQsgQtJlrUg

I actually don't remember what I had for my appetizer but the rest of the table got the shellfish platter (I'm allergic). They all said the food was fresh and good and there was certainly plenty of it. We joked that the waitresses must celebrate whenever they actually manage to sell one of those things. There was a wide variety, everything from shrimp and lobster to oysters, etc.

My entree was actually quite good with one major flaw. I got the Salmon di Parma and it was actually very good. I loved the way the prosciutto melded well with the salmon to add a bit of texture and a unique flavor to the fish. It was all cooked very well. I also absolutely loved the vodka sauce and orzo pasta, I could've had a dish just of that I think. But the one flaw, it was SOOOO salty. I couldn't finish it because of the incredible amount of salt. I know prosciutto is salty, but they definitely then added a hefty amount of salt to the pasta and fish. Tempered what could've been a superb dish.

Food came out in a pretty timely manner. Very disappointed with the portions. My bf ordered the ""half rack"" of lamb, and it came with 3 pieces. Poor tiny lamb that they must have killed for that meal. It came with hummus and a cucumber dipping sauce. It was quite delicious, but oh so tiny! I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass.

But it was a bit tough.

Got sweet potato fries and mushroom risotto as appetizers to share (2 of each) and they were good size and tasted great.

Our reservation was at 8:30. Halfway through our entree, the busser and server was already trying to collect our plates. And my bf was trying to slowly enjoy his food and they asked him at least 5 times if he was done yet. 

Food is pretty decent, but many entrees have small portions. Service killed the experience though. Only reason we were there was because we had a comp, wouldn't go back again without another comp.

They ordered lobster bisque and French Onion soup which they both enjoyed, side salad w/ their dinner was pretty big, and steaks were cooked perfectly. We ordered a side of sauteed spinach and asparagus spears which were both good as well.  Drinks were constantly being replenished during our meal without having to ask.

I would definitely recommend Canal Street to other clients if they're staying at the Orleans Hotel.  The only thing I didn't like was the rolling cart they used to bring out soup, salads, main courses, silverware on. It's kind of shady to do that, just pick the stuff up and serve it from a standing position.

Mashed Potatoes with Boursin cheese. 5 stars. $8
Bananas Foster - Prepared and flamed table-side. 5 stars. $7 (yes, it was only $7)
Whiskey Sour with Jack Daniels - $9
Cosmo $10

I can barely buy it at the butcher for that. Perfectly cooked, although I could have skipped the brown gravy that was drizzled over it.

There are nice plush booths for parties of 6 and under and if you have a large party like ours, 9 people, then you will sit in between all those booths with them facing you.  

The only reason I've come here for dinner is because our friend gives us comps to eat there.  So we usually take the whole family.  

The escargot appetizer is ok, garlicky but that's about it.  The seafood tower is lacking and for $38, they really need to add some more pieces of seafood on that ice tray.  My sister usually gets the lobster bisque but she stopped ordering it because there's hardly any lobster in there.

So the other day I ordered the prime rib, 16 oz cut with baked sweet potato.  And it was a HUGE disappointment!  The prime rib was rare like I like it but it was so tough to cut and even tougher to chew!  The baked sweet potato was overcooked that it was just mush.  My baby nephew loved it though.  

My boyfriend got the special of the day which was a 6 oz filet mignon and a lobster tail for $60.  The lobster tail was rubbery and the steak was not as tender as it could be.  

Service is really slow because they bring everyones food out at the same time - so if you are in a large group like ours then it will take a while.

Even though the restaurant was near empty, our food took forever to come. When the food did come, it all tasted mediocre. The onion soup was overly salty, and everything else tasted like it could have been bought from the any 2-star caliber restaurant on the Strip.

The first time we found it out of convenience from where we were staying at the Palms, and  this time we took a taxi from the Hard Rock Hotel to enjoy another meal here.

The ambience is quiet and romantic, and Big John, as others have called him, greets you at the door and promptly seats you.   The crab cakes were delicious (but next time I will try the lobster bisque as others wrote how fabulous it is), and the house salad served with your entrees is also one of the best house salads I have ever had.

For entrees, I had the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection and my friend had one of their new items, the stuffed veal chop.  For sides, we had the asparagus and scalloped potatoes, both amazing.  We can't comment on the desserts because we were simply too stuffed from all the amazing food.   

John the maitre'd was amazing and described all the fine details on how the food is prepared, how their beef is being upgraded, and the new items on the menu. The price for a steakhouse was very reasonable.

I ordered a side of asparagus which was broiled and tangy and wonderful. On another visit I've had melt-in-your-mouth filet mignon. I finished up with a cappuccino served with sticks of rock sugar.

Service at Canal Street is gracious and leisurely. A giant mural of a New Orleans river with a steamboat provides nice atmosphere.

3972365,2012-09-10,0,bfp51Aaft7T3M9gQnVsI_g,"I really like Canal Street.  As tourists, we went here many times.  As residents, we've only been here once in the last 11 years.  It was time to go back and see if it was as good as always and it was.

The bread basket consisted of a couple of pieces of tasty lavash and two rolls, one a walnut and raisin and the other I don't know because I didn't want to fill up on bread.  The butter comes with a piece of processed cheese spread with grapes and cranberries.  Very tasty!

I started with a house salad that comes with all entr√©es.  It's built almost like a small Cobb salad with greens in the middle and small mounds of diced tomato, bleu cheese, candied walnuts, hearts of palm, cucumber, and hard boiled egg around the perimeter.  I got bleu cheese dressing and the salad was very good.

My main course was the 8 ounce filet done black and blue.  With the steak came some summer vegetables cooked very little.  They were crispy and they were good!  I ordered a salted baked potato as a side.  My steak was done perfectly and the baked potato with that rich salt was very, very good.

For dessert, I got the Canal Street bread pudding with blueberries and a Bourbon whiskey vanilla sauce.  The bread pudding was different.   Not only was there the vanilla sauce, but the bread had a distinct chocolate infusion and there was chocolate sauce along with the vanilla.  Excellent.

Service was very good.  Iced tea was refilled without asking, finished dishes were removed promptly, and there was adequate time between courses to relax and enjoy the surroundings.  I wasn't rushed nor was service slow.

I like the room.  It has a New Orleans theme with one side being a mural.  In about an hour's time, the lights on the mural slowly dim and the fluorescent paint starts to glow with the blue lights and it looks like the lights in the mansion along the river or on the paddle wheel boat were turned on.  Then the lights slowly pick up and eventually it's daytime again.  I've always liked that ambiance and it was there again last night.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,6,6,4,L5yu5AzbJGide1mSQFNXfQ

We needed a fancy place to dine at before watching Mr. Olympia that night at the New Orleans Hotel and Casino. According to the Casinos website, this was the place to eat if you wanted to be fancy and glamorous. The only problem we had with this dinner was the fact that the manager on duty (I am assuming was the man at the front desk in full formal attire) did not know how to work the computer system for online booking. He kept insisting out loud in front of all these other customers that we did not have a reservation. Until he saw it ""popped up."" It was a bit embarrassing and kind of seemed sort of age-discriminating due to our young age.

Inside was lightly dimmed which made the d√©cor and ambiance very romantic yet still dull. A downfall of this restaurant was that is was so overly hot. Hot hot hot inside. It may have been because it just opened, but holy crap we were sweating enough that we had to sit there and drink two waters each before actually ordering any alcohol. We even told our waitress and she said it is not hot over and over again like we cared what she thought. 

The menu is a bit short and sweet but there is enough for anyone to find something yummy. I ordered the oysters and a side of asparagus. The oysters were to die for (yum-maz-ing) but the asparagus was way to drench in balsamic vinaigrette for my liking. My boyfriend ordered the chicken marsala which I believe he did on purpose since we always say mine is the best, but this time we both just starred at each other and laughed since this couldn't really compare to mine. It was so good! We also ordered a bottle of riesling wine and for dessert had some sort of banana pan smeared ice cream dessert. This took the busser about four times to make since all of their burners were out. We were about over it and almost about to tell him to not worry about it we wouldn't take it until it magically started.

Our waitress looked a bit overwhelmed. Our busser was amazing and literally did everything. Instead of tipping the waitress we should have tipped him!",-_lw9mjGf-92eC90JPW2_w,1,0,3,XsjnwI1zRp0hq8g-HBqW0w

The menu is rather small compared to many strip steakhouses but it has all the basics. 

I chose: 
- The onion soup. 3 stars because the broth to cheese ratio was slightly off. I tried my boyfriends lobster bisque and it was amazing! Get the lobster bisque. 
- The filet. 4 stars. Slightly over-cooked for my very-rare taste, so specify it if you want it very very-rare. The flavor/seasoning is amazing.

But I am gana be honest with you... For the price, thi place really was great.

We were immediately served fancy sparkling water at no additional charge (none of that they ask you and charge you for better), and ordered a glass of wine and a rum and coke. My R&C was nice and strong but didn't taste like pure rum... The bread was delicious and served with 2 cheese wrapped grapes where were delicious.

Also, I wanted to make a special note about the house salad (photo attached). It  was absolutely delicious!!! Probably the best house salad I have ever had... It was almost a cob salad at heart... Just amazing!

Finally, the main meal... I got the Colorado Lamb: Traditional Herb Crusted Half Rack  
Lollipops over Hummus and topped with Olive Tapenade and Cucumber Yogurt Sauce Cooked perfectly, great flavor... I would have preferred it served with a potato side dish, but beggars can't be choosers...

Total for all that food, with top, was $115.00. Now that may seem expensive, but if you go down to the strip, a meal of that quality and size would have been closer to $200.00, so I was impressed.

5658554,2010-12-29,1,bfp51Aaft7T3M9gQnVsI_g,"I went to Las Vegas for Christmas weekend and we visited 3 restaurants. Two of them were total disasters. Thank God for Canal Street as it saved the culinary portion of the trip. 

My sister chose the restaurant and when I checked it out online I didn't have very high hopes. The reviews were good and all, but the pictures on their website looked very tacky and drab and it looked like some old 60's dining room without the kitsch appeal. Luckily the decor looks MUCH nicer in person and it's actually a very pleasant atmosphere. 

As an appetizer I started with the shrimp cocktail. This was the only downside to the meal and the reason they are getting 4 stars instead of 5. It was $14 and you only get 3 shrimp. They are good sized shrimp, but not big enough to warrant the price. Additionally, they were over cooked and a little tough. The presentation was outstanding though. It was a very nicely put together plate. 

The dinner salad with the house raspberry vinaigrette dressing was quite good and was included with the price of the entree. That's a nice change of pace considering most high end steakhouses don't include the salad and you have to pay extra if you want one. 

As for my entree, I had the filet mignon and ordered it medium. It was absolutely awesome! Definitely one of the best steaks I have ever had. It was cooked perfectly, was very tender with absolutely no fat or gristle at all. They gave me a steak knife, but honestly I probably could have cut it with a butter knife. 

I also ordered a side of the lobster mac and cheese. It was not at all what I expected, but again, the presentation was fantastic and it was quite tasty even though I couldn't find any lobster anywhere in it. The side dishes are huge and we probably should have shared them rather than ordering our own. It did mean I had left overs though! 

The service was quite impressive. From the waiter, to the busboy, to the hosts, everything about the service was impeccable! Our water glasses never got low and as soon as I finished my soda another one was sitting there in front of me. They definitely have their stuff together here. 

The only negative thing that happened was at the end of the meal we weren't really offered any dessert. The waiter did ask if we wanted ""anything else"" but usually at a high end restaurant like this they will bring out a dessert cart or tray, or at least a dessert menu. I'm not sure we were have ordered anything, but we weren't in a hurry to leave and might have ordered dessert if something looked interesting. 

I would definitely agree with the reviews that mention the age of the clientele here. I think we were the youngest people there by at least 10 years and there was one woman there who was so old I think she was actually decomposing at the table. Also, some of the food takes a little longer to make (the mac and cheese takes at least 45 minutes) but honestly, if you are in a hurry you shouldn't be going to a fine dining restaurant anyway. This is definitely a sit down and take your time kinda of place. 

It is a little pricey ($14 for a 3 shrimp-shrimp cocktail, $3.75 for a soda, etc) but it is very good and was hands down the best meal I had last weekend.",pS0h-b_aWVm-drm880T01w,3,0,4,6YknPIzByJAyK5_ULT3EVQ

Onion Soup was good but did not sport much cheese cover or crouton; there were just two big globs of cheese floating in the broth.  Cobb Salad was more interesting for its presentation.  All ingredients were colorfully arrayed individually in a circle, like spokes of a wheel.

My Filet was fine but Grilled Shrimp was overcooked and not very flavorful.  Garlic Bread was good and chewy.  A dessert of assorted gelatos (Tiramisu, Mint, and Chocolate) with Blackberries were all good!  So, while on balance food and service were both satisfactory, I will not go out of my way to return.
