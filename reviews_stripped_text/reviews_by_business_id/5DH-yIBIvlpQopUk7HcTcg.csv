I know that's the worst time to come in and then do a review on this place. But let's be honest the true colors come out when you can handle a rush hour exceptionally. Panera Bread has great food, I won't jeopardize my integrity as the rest. The only inconvenience for me was the weak customer service and the miscommunication. I just do not understand how you cannot tell your customer where to pick up their food, so you try to figure that out on our own, and when you hand them their order after a 30 minute wait time and the french baguette is the driest most hardest piece of bread to chew in the entire planet. Most disappointing the fact that they threw the french baguette in the bag, not even in a separate container but savagely in the bag, rolling around until I opened the bad at work and saw the french baguette lonely all the way in the bottom. I was unsatisfied with my experience I want to be positive for my next visit and hopefully they can pack my order and listen to me when I want to give honest feedback, the policy states that if you are unhappy with something or have any inconvenience Panera Bread will give you a treat as compensation. I just want more responsibility and maybe that can impact the representation and ambiance of the place. I know Panera Bread can do way better! I believe in Panera.",1IAuZhwpbGl8jwN2DTkh-w,1,0,4,72hyGTjTj-kJMPWVidoyyg

First, I was greeted by the evening teenaged crew calling each other derogatory terms and calling each other broke. I really felt like I was in a high school class room it was ridiculous. THEN we received our food to go, made it home to realize there was CHICKEN in our VEGAN SOUP!!! We ordered the Vegan Lentil quinoa bowl and got chicken instead. Went all the way back to wait for 10 minutes for the manager while watching a worker eat a strawberry while cleaning up tables, taking a bite in between picking up plates... once the manager decided to show herself, she then did NOTHING. Said ""oh sorry"" and refunded the order. Nothing else no actual concern and she probably didn't even tell her staff about the issue. Really disappointed, all I ask is that if you are gonna serve VEGAN options, educate your staff.",WWbRaTL6oFLvGNGZKnMwzQ,0,0,1,3RwTnL9MVi4nDsk1qwtx7g
2069254,2018-04-06,0,5DH-yIBIvlpQopUk7HcTcg,"DO NOT ORDER WITH DELIEVERY SERVICE! Especially if you're ordering to a school campus/big area. I usually eat at the cafe which is a decent experience (except they take forever to make the food), but I decided to make a scheduled delivery in time for lunch. Btw, I made this order around 1 and a half to 2 hours ahead of time. The online service ""supposedly"" makes updates for the food. An hour later, no update. So I call the cafe and nobody ever picks up the phone, then I call customer service and they can't reach that cafe either. The customer service was really nice and gave me a coupon for my food and politely told me to wait. I did. Another half an hour passes with no update. I was going to leave campus soon so I needed my food. I tried calling the cafe again AND STILL NO ANSWER. I just gave up and left. I get a text message at 2 that said my food was delivered. IT TOOK TWO HOURS. I wouldn't be complaining if it wasn't a scheduled delivery, but it was. In conclusion, don't order delivery and maybe don't eat here at all.",5jR46rc-ytAe-mLd68-76Q,1,0,2,-Nx4sOV9Lb_-mm0Cy9d5TQ
2268718,2018-02-20,2,5DH-yIBIvlpQopUk7HcTcg,"I keep forgetting this Panera is open and thus haven't been here until now. The location is convenient because it's only a few minutes from my work and I can place an order through my Panera app and it'll be ready when I arrive. This location must get busy because they have self service ordering tablets in addition to the Mobile ordering feature.

The food is standard Panera fare and my favorite entree is usually the Green Goddess Salad. I love that Panera allows you to sub the default side (bread) for whatever else you'd like (apple, chips, etc). Of course I always pick the apple. Drinks are self service, including tea and coffee, which I love because that means unlimited refills on my coffee!

Panera is pretty pricey IMO for the portion sizes you get, but I love it because it's convenient when ordering through the app because the food is waiting for me when I show up. Also, their food tastes super fresh which is always a plus nowadays!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,4,4,4,7z_RBbnGD0zHdZ4CH6hIyw

I was super exciting when I saw the coming soon sign and now I may have a slight obsession with ordering rapid pickup since it's so close to my office.  Orders have always been correct - and even when I accidentally ordered the wrong soup, they replaced it with the correct one without a hassle.  I'm super sad to be moving offices because I will miss my (at least once) weekly half turkey avocado BLT and broccoli cheese soup.

4035307,2018-06-17,9,5DH-yIBIvlpQopUk7HcTcg,"Not wanting the typical fast food choices decided to have dinner at a restaurant that serves ""real"" food. Beware once an individual decides to go Panera there is no substitute. With this being my first experience at this location I was extremely excited to try the food and atmosphere that Panera delivers continually to its customers. 

This store still has that new building scent. The decor of the restaurant is amazing. The booths are so comfortable. The lighting is fantastic and the natural hues of wood that they use make this location amazing. The carpet is even soft and fluffy. When they built and designed this location of Panera, I feel they wanted the customer to feel at home. Which it does the restaurant just needs tele's.

As I sit here and eat my dinner I have yet to be surprised again with the use of new technology and how Panera is using it. The guest may sit down at their table and order online from the table itself. Basically, the Panera table in the restaurant is the destination of the order. I checked it out you put the table number in that you sit at. How wonderful! Plus, when you decide to order one can do it on a new kiosk electronically in the store, or the good old fashioned way with a real human.

I decided to have the Caesar salad which was very filling and delicious. The Caesar dressing had that proper balance of tang to it. The lettuce was crisp and fresh too. The croutons are made by hand here and one could taste the quality of this. For dessert I ordered a sugar cookie that was in the shape of a tulip. The frosting of the tulip sugar cookie was amazing. This cookie was very soft and fresh. I enjoy knowing what I am eating for these reasons why I continue to trust Panera with the excellence they constantly deliver.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,25,25,5,SkpvxZ_J73PNdd4MjlZUDw

When my meal arrived at my table (about 10 minutes after everyone else, I just ordered soup!), it was the wrong order. The server was polite and took the soup back, never to return. The manager was polite and apologized, but still charged me for my tea. I sat and waited for my food for 1/2 an hour, with no food, and they couldn't even give me a free drink. Everyone was very friendly and apologized, but with so many other good lunch places in the area, good service should be a priority.

4531374,2018-02-01,0,5DH-yIBIvlpQopUk7HcTcg,"I've dined at this location a couple of weeks ago and all was great! My half Chicken Napa Almond Sandwich stood tall next to my Soba Noodle Chicken Bowl with a French Baguette. They get 4-stars for their service, but -1 star for forgetting my treat that I ordered, which I reminded them of. Panera's food quality is good. It is a cafe style sort of food menu. Their baked treats are yummy and the fruit drinks are delightful.

This 3-Star review is based on the delivery service from an order I placed on their website for myself, my coworker, and boss. The online ordering went smooth and each order was clear enough to see who owed what on the receipt.

The delivery said 30-45 minutes, but ended up taking an hour. The tracker that Panera links you to had the driver at one location spot for awhile and then had them hopping to my delivery point and back to where they had started from. I wasn't sure what was going on but I figured that maybe they had to get gas or were rerouted due to construction/convention across the street. When they finally made it to my delivery point, the delivery woman, Charmane, was apologetic for not being on time, which I accepted her apology as I'm sure there are unknown rerouting issues or maybe navigation threw her off. But no, her reasoning was because she had to deliver frozen drinks to another location which was off the route to my delivery point. Understandable, but that's unfortunate that frozen drinks received priority over my order and pushed the time which ran into my boss' meeting time. NOTE TO SELF that I guess next time order frozen drinks so I become first on the delivery list.

Everything we ordered was in the bag. The only food item I was not pleased with is my Half Napa Almond Chicken sandwich because it was smashed. I'm sure it was because it was in the bag squeezed next to the other sandwich that was ordered and next to the bag of soups. May have been smashed, but it was still delicious!

I will be returning to dine-in this location again in the future because the service was great and the food quality is wonderful. As for delivery, I'll just have to either pick-up or have food delivered knowing it may go over the estimated time given from Panera. Delivery woman was very kind though.",bYm6JjJ64F31gzDq2imWJA,0,0,3,BKCH--VU0fT6bHobb8B9kQ

4721807,2018-02-01,0,5DH-yIBIvlpQopUk7HcTcg,"I really hate leaving one-star reviews because to be honest, most one-star reviews I read are over dumb complaints.  Let me just say I've been to plenty of Panera Breads before, I like their product, but I've never had negative experience until this location for which I've had multiple. 

I work right by this location, so it's convenient on the way to work and this is my third and final time there.  It's new and I gave it a few chances because I figured they're just getting the kinks out as most new stores of any kind have, and it takes a little time to smooth things out. 

I ordered a large iced coffee with cream and the brioche breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg and sausage.

The coffee was basically all cream with a hint of coffee.  I walked back in over to the pick-up window area and I promise I didn't make a stink.  I tried to be as polite as possible and kept saying I didn't mean to be a pain.  I explained my issue, said I would like a large ice coffee with just a little cream if they could please do something for me.  I waited a couple of minutes, she brought it back out and I swear they must have just brought me back the same cup I handed them without doing anything to it.

It was the lightest shade of tan you can imagine. I tasted it and it tasted exactly the same.  Coffee flavored Ice Cream tasted more like coffee than this did.  I was in a rush to get to work and didn't have time to deal with this.  On my way out the girl at the register asked if it was ok now, I was honest and said it tasted the same then just walked out. 

The sandwich was mediocre and when I bit into it, it was half warm and half cold in parts. Plus, water actually dripped out a little which was odd.  Not sure if anything was frozen to start.

I threw the coffee out and ate the sandwich just to get my sustenance. Then I had to stop at McDonalds of all places to get coffee because I was pressed for time.  Somehow they understood my simple coffee order.

So $14 later, here I am writing this review and I did tip $1 by the way.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,1,0,1,XhdxLbsBmHbOeHxw47zM_g
4873845,2018-01-23,2,5DH-yIBIvlpQopUk7HcTcg,"Dear Panera,  

I really wanted to like you...I remember years ago eating a cozy bowl of soup at another location in a place far away on a cold day.  When you opened so close to our house, I thought, this is a good option for that late Sunday night snack/dinner when I don't want to cook, and we could just have a quick healthy meal.  Well, we have tried twice now to like it, and my hope is waning.  First, the decor is not cosy by any stretch of the imagination.   I feel like I am eating in a airport cafeteria.  But I could overlook this.  I understand that this is not food cooked on the premises.  I can overlook that.  What I can't overlook is cold soup, chili and pasta.  Both trips.  Please,  is there some temperature regulation that you cannot make hot soup in order to avoid future litigation?  Literally, all our soup, and chili last night was tepid, while our Mac and cheese was downright cold.  And we dined in, this was not to go...Yes, we could have asked for someone to reheat, but I believe that if one of your main dishes is soup, it needs to be served hot the first time, and as this is a quick stop from home, it felt like too much effort.

It's not me, it's you.

Goodbye.",cFKt6c5KUj6NQS0Nb9LB_w,0,0,1,b58nAU_bR0yehL-zSmQPpg
5653786,2018-03-28,2,5DH-yIBIvlpQopUk7HcTcg,"This review is about the delivery service. I enjoy leaving my office for lunch but have had to stay in recently. I decided to use my Panera app and order online. The online ordering system is really easy to use, but you need to be precise on your order. My first experience ordering online was a breeze and I received everything I asked for. The only downfall was that the Mango smoothie I ordered did not taste completely blended. I let it go and moved on. I then ordered online a second time, same exact order and I am not sure what happened, but it wasn't great. The salad I ordered was loaded with bacon bits which I did not order. Don't get me wrong, there is a time and a place for bacon but I am trying to eat healthier so having my salad LOADED with bacon bits was not what I wanted or needed. The second problem was I did not receive my Mango smoothie. Lost a Star! I called right away and finally someone answered. I explained what had happened, and the woman told me the smoothie would be on it's way. Great! Within about 10 minutes, the smoothie arrived. Again, disappointing and not blended properly. All I could taste was orange juice.....this is supposed to be a MANGO smoothie. Just about the time I finished my lunch another smoothie was delivered. WOW! Really nice of Panera to provide me with two smoothies but even the third one stunk, again not blended and very watery. I am not sure who is making the smoothies at this location, but I think they need to attend a class in The Art of Making a Smoothie or take lessons from the location in Boca Park as their Mango Smoothies are simply the best!

As for the cafe, it is just like all the others but this location is very convenient to where I work so I have been in a few times. I like the Panera products but the delivery service needs to make sure that all orders are correct and not include random ingredients that the customer didn't order.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,6,3,3,1Y5dpmBB4ZLDfFQTvQ5tjA
