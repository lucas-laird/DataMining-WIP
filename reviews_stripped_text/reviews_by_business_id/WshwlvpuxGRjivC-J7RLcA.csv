I am not going to complain a whole lot about the food quality.  I ordered the Lasagna and it was quite good with a great bolognese sauce and garlic toast.  My wife had a burger that she devoured with good fries as well.  Serving size was average but adequate.  I would give food quality 3.5 stars.

However . . . sticker shock was an understatement.  Read the menu for yourself and make your decision, but this food was worth at most 60% of what they charge.  (It's Vegas . . . probably 40% in any given home town place.)

The service was spotty . . . the people there acted a little like they didn't know why they were there.  And the most memorable thing?  I think the sound system is being driven by an old CD player - as about every 90 seconds the cookie-cutter pop music would skip for 2-3 seconds like you used to experience when carrying your Sony Disc-man around.  At first I thought it was just a song or two, but it happened in every damn song they played.

Unless the prices come down - we will trudge our way to the Food Court for a quick bite, so I expect a new venue to fill this void sooner rather than later.",NkazTvmy9C_inITSo9SukQ,0,0,2,GPVKOtgWHQXb_KmESYVq9A

First, the prices our outrageous. $44 for a steak and some fries. $18 for some eggs and bacon. $16 for a Chinese chicken salad, or a Caesar. 

I probably would have gotten over the price if the quality of the food matched the tag. Unfortunately, it didn't. There were only a few things to choose from, but my husband got a couple of grilled cheese sandwiches and I got the Chinese chicken salad. My salad was fine. Nothing to write home about, but edible. The sandwiches, however, left a lot to be desired. It's really not that hard to mess up a grilled cheese, but when these arrived we were particular shocked to see they were made with American cheese (not cheddar), and the bread might as well have been Wonder-bread. For an $18 sandwich, we definitely expected some good cheddar and thick sliced sourdough. Also, his fries were cold and dry, like they had been sitting underneath the warmer for a couple of hours. 

Our server didn't gain any points either. From the start, we felt overlooked. We aren't a couple who goes all out when they go to Vegas. I don't know how so many can walk the Strip in 5-inch heels all night. We're a t-shirt and jeans kind of couple. I couldn't help but notice that most of the other guests were in suits and dresses. You know, they looked like they had $$. Well, our server was attentive to those guests, while we got the cold shoulder. He took our order, but our food was delivered by another server/runner, and we had to run him down for the check. He didn't check on us once and certainly wasn't helpful. 

Big mistake. My husband is the most generous guy you'll ever meet. I was a waitress for 10 years, and even I tell him he tips too much, often 40% for service that was just okay. This was the first time that he left a ""standard"" tip, which was about 18%. 

You may have a completely different experience if you visit this place during normal restaurant hours, but for late night it was hugely disappointing.",bqODJ8gRW7M3XhZJHkzk6g,0,0,2,U4MDwkz7GovM0uk1ybmyoQ
237685,2015-06-08,0,WshwlvpuxGRjivC-J7RLcA,"Waiter was nice, service sucks..really expensive. The only reason I ate here was cause I got to Vegas Late Thursday night and everything on the strip where I wanted to eat was closed by 11 or 12..so I didn't feel like walking all over to find something and I was just really hungry at the time. I wasn't really expecting this place to
Charge $67 for two burgers and a drink each for me and my girlfriend, the food wasn't bad or anything, but definitely NOT worth $67..I assumed a 24 hour restaurant would've been an okay priced place for all the travelers and drunk people to grab a quick bite. Like I said earlier the waiter was cool and all but the service was bad and place is just way to over priced..if you're willing to spend that type of money for the same food you can get somewhere else for only 30/40 bucks then go for it!",LQ4BGoPL-c5Iw5HCyjCVVQ,0,0,2,vZVLEajA1my55KGfrjClQQ
497856,2015-02-11,0,WshwlvpuxGRjivC-J7RLcA,"Stopped in for a late night snack/early morning breakfast. 

Seated in a section for 25 minutes until they realized they didn't even have a waitress in the section & then asked to relocate to another section. Bus boy seemed more concerned than anyone else in the entire place for the wait to include management. 

Very limited menu. Ordered the pancake stack & turkey club sandwich. French fries were ice cold, toast on bread was hard as a rock & pancakes were too heavy. One orange juice & a flat sprite later we were over $60 in the hole. I work hard for my money and sincerely hate wasting it. Will never return, nor recommend!",uiYxkV2Fx4_ZlVTVa7KsCQ,0,0,1,-Ornjx0W1pXflfdOSCWXGg
3923390,2015-03-23,0,WshwlvpuxGRjivC-J7RLcA,"Stopped by here just before 1am early Monday morning (Sunday night) as we were in the area and there weren't too many other nearby dining options. We definitely should have been less lazy and gone somewhere better.

The menu seemed pretty meh, so I ordered the ""guava BBQ"" ribs ($34) which as listed on the menu come with fries and slaw. First off, the portion is tiny - just 5 ribs not cut very well, so it was really more like 4 ribs. The ribs themselves were just OK; they tasted like typical ribs you'd get from a typical chain restaurant. I honestly couldn't taste any guava. Unfortunately, the fries were so salty to the point I couldn't eat more than a few - and as far as the slaw, it was literally one bite. It came in a tiny container the same size as the ketchup for my fries. I think my friends were happier with their food (not that that's saying much), but it was all definitely just typical cafe offerings.

Service was not good - I didn't get my water or soda refilled even once, not even after asking. My place setting was also missing a napkin, and again, I had to ask two busboys and then my waiter before I finally got one. After finishing my ribs, I asked for wet naps. The server brought me a napkin soaked in hot water, but then took my other napkln. Apparently diners here are not allowed more than one napkin, even when they are lucky enough to get one at all in the first place.

I don't expect much value from a 24 hour cafe in a strip casino, but $34 for 5 ribs, bad fries, nearly nonexistent slaw, and iffy service? I'll definitely pass.",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,1,0,1,YT3tz3-mjrZR1xa3vUEDRQ
4857196,2015-02-18,2,WshwlvpuxGRjivC-J7RLcA,"We had the afternoon free so the other wives and I were walking the strip, we ducked into Ceaser's and found Bistro 24 right away. Since none of us had eaten there before, we decided to eat there.

Large plates and serving utensils were whimsical decor, and the tables were white linen table cloths, the service was delightful.  My friends ordered a Grilled cheese sandwich on garlic bread with fries - which sounded decadent. And I'm assured it was. 

A salad with chicken topping it, Corrin said that it was light and crisp, that the dressing that she asked for on the side, had been served on it, which wasn't really an issue. 

I ordered the chicken salad sandwich, with a side salad. The chicken salad was flavored with curry spices, I didn't know this when I ordered it, but when I bit into it, it was abundantly clear. I wasn't sure how I would react.. it was REALLY good. I LOVED it. 

Over all, I'd eat here again, if I could.",Um5bfs5DH6eizgjH3xZsvg,2,2,4,lFsfLHHWe6Y02p8VIZA9_A
5668022,2014-12-19,0,WshwlvpuxGRjivC-J7RLcA,"Central is now Bistro 24.  Same location but new owners as the previous restaurant went bankrupt.  There is no signage currently that identifies it as Bistro 24.

Breakfast is served til 11 am and lunch til 4.  After Christmas, Bistro 24 will reopen with many of the same people and a revamped menu.  The restaurant will then be open 24 hours a day.

The burger and fish and chips make great lunchtime options.  We had the Club sandwich and the grilled cheese.  Sandwiches come with the option of a salad, cole slaw or fries.

The bar is great for picking some cocktails on your way back to the room or a bottle of champagne to celebrate your winnings.

A late night snack and dessert is also the most popular option after a not of  clubbing and drinking.   

Centrally located across from the Caesars checkin. Bypass the Starbucks and head over for breakfast and don't miss the stuffed French Toast, their signature dish.

Because of its location, you cant miss this spot and it will be a great central place to meet away from the casino.",vbXmCVj1RZ4civT7nrcKyw,1,0,4,-a5GknwRknMtJN1hjW-lqw
