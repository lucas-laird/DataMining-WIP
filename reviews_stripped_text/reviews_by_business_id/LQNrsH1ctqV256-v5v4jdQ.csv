I was told I have to pay for extra dipping sauces. After some bickering I finally received the sauces and drove home. When I arrived home I discovered my 8 piece hot was missing 2 fingers. I drove back to Sunny's and informed them of what happened. This time Sunny looked at me like I ate two of the fingers before my return. I asked could I get some type of compensation for having to take my time to return because of their mistake. He told me I could get two more fingers or my money back. He made a point to let me know I was not gonna take advantage of him. I thought that was unprofessional.

The extra mild were okay, but it seems like they used catchup to tone down the heat and they were still a little spicy. They were not bad just not our favorite. The place stays busy and the phone is always ringing, which tells you how good their food is. The lady that waited on us had no personality and could use some customer service skills. No thank you or anything and we asked her a question and she was about to write down what we were asking about the Lemmon pepper like that's what we Wanted on our chicken.

I took off a star just because the food did take quite a while to get ready. I wanna say we waited about 25-30min for our food.. My BF got the chicken and waffles ($3.59) and I opted for their catfish fish and chips southern style ($5.99). Okay presentation looked great, prices were AMAZING but I guess the food was just good/okay. The chicken was seasoned very well. The waffle was really soft and kinda soggy. We both agreed we like it better crispier like how other place make it since the chicken obviously will make it soggy in the long run. My catfish looked great and came with a lot but they were also thin so it was more of the breading than the meat, which was a little disappointing too. The fries it came with were really soft too.

Everything we've had here was tasty, and cheap too, which is always nice!

Gizzards come a ton to an order, for under $4. BF's a fan, and with the buffalo sauce from the chicken and waffles dish, they're solid: crispy, and served hot.
Chicken and waffles are a dish I've never quite understood, but the sweetness of the thick, fluffy waffle plus the syrup contrasted nicely with the hot chicken and buffalo sauce. Would get this again, and it's a steal at $3.
Two-piece ""snack"" comes with some deliciously-seasoned fries and a roll. This is a meal even for my unrestrained appetite, not a ""snack"".

I was amazed at the prices, asked one guy about it and he said it was the best fried chicken he had ever had.  Well it was good but if that was the best he's ever had, he needs to get out more.  Now don't get me wrong, Sunnys is good, both the chicken and fish were.  I ordered the fish on my first visit, the seasoning they use to coat the fish is very light and well seasoned, plus they give you a lot for 4.99.  On my second visit I tried the chicken, it too was seasoned very well and the price was also excellent.   On my third visit I got lemon pepper wings, they were just a tad bit too salty but still very tasty.  3.99 for six wings and fries!!!

""Sunny's Chicken and Fish? Sounds good but the place looks kind of shady"". Well folks, let me be the first one to tell you that it's not shady at all. We stopped by around 6:30 for dinner and never felt any safer. It's really not a shady place.

Now to the important stuff.  All I gotta say is get the Fried Catfish plus the Chicken n Waffles no matter what. 

The Catfish ($5.99) has two options. Southern, which is basically cajun, and Beer Battered. Both are very good.  The cajun style has a cornmeal/pepper spice to it while the beer battered option gives you the crispy coating with good flavor. Comes with fries which is also decent. I love both options because when you bite into either one, you can taste the flavor of the catfish and you can tell that it was freshly seasoned or battered right before getting dumped in the fryer. The freshness of the fish is evident in every bite. I know some places you might get that sandy, bottom of the ocean taste but here its non existent.

The Chicken n Waffles ($3.99). OMG. I dont know what it is exactly what it is that coats the chicken but damn, I could eat that by itself. While I was savoring that, I almost forgot that there was a waffle that came with it. By the end of the meal, it didnt matter what I was dipping in the syrup, it all tasted good put together. Oh, you also get some hot sauce too just in case the syrup is not your thing or if its simply not enough.

As for the comments on this place being not too attractive, I compare it to that nice, quiet, nerd type librarian with glasses and the hair tied up. Once you get to know them and they open up to you, they are actually very attractive with their rich personality. You know what they say. It's always the quiet ones that surprise you. 

Some random info. They take cards. There's no bathroom. At least there is a nice sink for you to wash your hands with after you are done licking your fingers from all the flavor.

So in closing, always have an open mind in trying things out for the first time especially when something seems sketchy. This place is a diamond in the rough, hole in the wall, etc. Whatever cliche you want, it fits. Will be back with lots of other people. As a matter of fact, I ordered more food to take home to my family and they loved it! Memo to Roscoe. You got some serious competition.

She went on about when you take a bite, the flavor bursts in your mouth. 

We are food connoisseurs, to drive out of our way for corn fritters or a great cup of tea is not unheard of. 

Upon entering the facility I knew there was some promise since the joint looked like everything a ""the best"" fried chicken shack should be... a shack. 
Nothing pretentious. 

The service was excellent, especially considering how busy he was.
You are what you eat, and food served with a positive attitude is better for consumption.

I ordered the chicken and waffle. The waffle had a touch of cinnamon in the batter which gave it a little flair. The chicken was exactly how my friend described, crispy- juicy- full of flavor = Well worth the visit.

There's really no way to get around it: this place looks rough.  Funky with a capital F.  Peeled wallpaper, old fixtures, archaic menu board, flies.  None of that stuff really matters.  You don't come here for the ambiance. You come here for the food.  It's the  Flavortown Paradox.

The Flavortown Paradox describes the inverse relationship between a dive's appearance and the tastiness of its food.  That's this place in Spades.  

The chicken is cooked to order and served up blistering hot. Mine was cooked perfectly. My only criticism was it was a little too salty.  Delicious, but salty. My two piece combo (breast/wing) was quite filling. The waffle was good, but not really remarkable.

The Waffle/2 piece fried chicken combo is a real bargain at $3.59.

So a good friend and foodie told me and my boyfriend about a new east side spot that has chicken and waffles. He really didn't need to say more, we were in. 
Then I seen a 2pc chicken and waffle for under $4. WHAT IS THE CATCH? Sunny's is a cool addition to the east side with some solid fried chicken. I think there are still pretty new and have potential to be way more than what they are now. The sides like cole slaw, beans, and potato salad are store bought. But the batter on the chicken makes up for it. The waffle was decent as well. The hot sauce, not spicy.
My biggest complaint is the décor and smell. I know you are a new place but clean it up a bit. It smelled like urine or cleaning supplies trying to cover up a bad smell.

From the beginning... The place only had 2 others here when I arrived. All of the tables were dirty and the windows were filthy with lots of scratches. In one corner was a pile of broken tables stacked high with some sort of strange hand written note on the pile.
I wanted to try both the chicken and fish and chips and asked if I could purchase 1 piece of fish to sample... No. I later found out that the fish was catfish, so I am glad that was the answer. I ordered a 3 pc chicken snack with 2 drumsticks and a wing. It took well over 25 minutes to get it. Again this was at 2:15 on a Saturday with nearly no one in the place. One good point was the chicken and fries came out hot. The roll was cold and hard. The ""drumsticks"" we're the the size of seagull legs. The wing was normal sized.
The coating on the chicken was course and really had no flavor to it, the chicken was not marinated either... Pretty bland.

I had known by reading the reviews that there's at least 20 minutes wait for their fried chicken. I was too lazy and stupid to call in before so I ended up waiting over 30 minutes in this unairconditioned tiny store for my fried chicken, gizzards and liver. (There are some sealing fans so wasn't that bad.)
The guy that took my order was very nice. He warned me there was going to be 20 to 30 minutes wait. (Yeah, I know. My bad.)
When my food came out, I was so exited I had to taste a few pieces of gizzards and liver before I headed back to home. Mmmm, they were so good!! They were coated with some kind of peppery tasty seasoning. They were deep fried but it didn't taste greasy at all. I especially loved their gizzards. They were so addicting I finished the whole container off. (I couldn't eat anything for 24 hours after this.) Can't believe they are only $3.29 each family size.
The fried chicken was also very tasty. It had different coating than gizzards' and liver's. It was worth the wait and the long drive. Definitely hit the spot. Thanks to the Yelpers for great reviews :-)

With the sad closing of Kathy's(AGAIN!) It left a huge hole in my fried chicken heart...:(
I saw pictures from Ty W. and immediately bookmarked this place. Not in the nicest part of town, but some pretty tasty bites can be found here!

Sunny and his wife are an Iraqi couple busting out their version of Soul Food in the Sunrise area of Las Vegas, and seems like they're doing pretty well. We were jonezing for some fried chicken, so I went straight for the 2-piece Chicken and Waffles($3.59), 
Wifey Got the 2-piece snack($3.99) which comes with a roll and fries. We also spied some fried chicken livers($3.29) so we tried those as well.

We didn't try any sides, but judging from Dyanna L.'s Review, I don't think their sides are made in house. The chicken and livers are pretty tasty and the waffle is made fresh(Syrup is standard Log Cabin , HFC stuff), so those are pretty solid selections if you do decide to give Sunny's a go. The seasoning on the chicken(same on the fries too, I think) may throw people off, and times be a little salty, and the bare bones place could use a solid cleaning, but people keep coming in and getting wings and chicken by the container full to go, and the price point here is not bad at all. 

In the meantime in between time, I'll keep searching, maybe return for some wings or gizzards!...:9  ALOHA!!!

4040141,2015-11-17,3,LQNrsH1ctqV256-v5v4jdQ,"I had some left over fried gizzards from my best friend awhile back and I thought they were delicious. When I found out they were from Sunny's, a place I book marked awhile back, I knew I'd found a must try hole in the wall.

I've been craving soul food for weeks and decided to try Sunny's out. To my disappointment I wouldn't call Sunny's soul food. I guess I don't know what soul food is, but I imagined some smothered in gravy fried chicken with some heart sides like macaroni and cheese.

This place is a total hole in the wall when you walk in. Located on Lamb and Washington it is exactly what you'd expect to find inside and out. That's my nice way of saying it wasn't so nice looking. I'm from the east side so this is in my neck of the wood and doesn't scare me, but I can see how some may be put off or scared. First impressions aside I thought they served some delicious eats.

It's all about the deep fried here at Sunny's: beer battered fish, southern fried fish, chicken wings, chicken fingers, and fried chicken. Although they offer many sides like Cole slaw, mashed potatoes, and french fries it is pretty obvious the suggested side is a waffle for most of the dishes with some syrup and hot sauce. 

My to-go order included: a huge order of fried gizzards, cole-slaw, 20 wings (garlic parm and hot), a Philly cheesesteak, 2 piece chicken with waffle, 2 piece tenders with waffle. Basically everything but the fish. I spent about $30 and it was a lot of food. A lot a lot of food! The order came out quickly and the cashiers showed us every box to make sure our order was right.

Conclusion is their fried stuff is really good and I wish I ate their to experience the food fresh. I never had chicken and waffles but I now understand America's obsession with it. I was surprised at their wings. They were really good and a good size. For about $12 for 20 I thought they'd be tiny wings. Also everything is super affordable. Getting 2 tenders or two pieces of chicken with a waffle is about $4 and looks to be a filling meal. The batter they use to fry their food is really well seasoned. I wouldn't recommend the Philly cheese steak though. It was greasy in the worst way possible. The meat, onions, peppers, and cheese were all just a mush in the bread.

I can't say much about customer service although the cashier/sunny was nice. I did like that he opened the boxes with me to make sure my order was right.

After a 20min wait my order was ready, the lady shows you your order to confirm accuracy, so when looking at mine I don't see my flaming hot wings. I don't recall if she rang them up or not and after the hunger pains & long ass wait I don't inquire I grab my shit & go! 

Driving back down Lamb I'm eating omw too and I started w/the gizzards. Very fresh & hot! I didn't like the seasoning they added to them. I would've preferred none or lemon pepper, so those got disgarded quickly. Next I hit the lemon pepper wings FRIED TOO HARD! Taste was very good, but they should've been pulled up sooner. I saved the last 2pc chicken snack which was a thigh & leg for last. It was extra fresh & juicy, but again that seasoning from the gizzards was present. It's like a chipotle seasoning that's gross to me. So I ate the thigh, but nothing else. I left the rest for my kids who didn't eat any of it. Lol I would return for the flavored wings only. I almost forgot to write this review, which isn't good. Service was ok, quick in and out nothing major stood out.",KKLWlqtaspsWHYGQLfUl1w,3,3,3,qnXqWd2FK5_TCyctKLtVSw

Located a few minutes off the 515 in perhaps one of the less reputable parts of town, Sunny's serves a lot of the kinds of fried goods that you might expect at this part of town: fried chicken, chicken wings from six (with fries) to 100 per order, chicken fingers, cheesesteaks, fish, fries, and a few sides. On the sides menu, however, are gizzards and livers. Definitely not typical, but definitely the reason that I went.

When I asked for gizzards and livers, Sunny asked me if I wanted them mixed together, aka in one order. I was surprised but very happy, especially when I saw that the half-and-half order still cost $3.29 and still was a huge portion. Both of these organ meats are lightly battered and fried with salt, pepper, and likely some other pieces lending a great crunchy exterior. Inside, the gizzards are delightfully chewy, whereas the livers are squishy and very gamy. Don't order livers on your own if you don't know what you're getting into!

My other order was chicken and waffles. Not sure if $3.99 was the right charge since most say it's $3.59, but I won't quibble over a few dimes. You can have two pieces of any typical fried chicken pieces for this order. I chose dark meat (leg and thigh). I actually thought this chicken had a little less flavor in the batter than in my side orders, but it was piping hot, juicy and made-to-order. Hey, it'd better be fresh after I waited at least 15 minutes (possible explanation later).

The waffle was soft and not crunchy at all even though I dined in. The syrup was standard stuff (get extra, you'll need it), but the hot sauce was way too acidic for my taste. Overall, definitely not my favorite rendition of chicken and waffles, although certainly reasonable for the price.

Speaking of which, prices appear to be mostly if not all identical to photos taken close to when they first opened. They don't offer burgers anymore. I suggest calling ahead (as many others observably did) to minimize wait time.

I would try different entrees before going back to the chicken and waffles, but I've still giving Sunny's a solid 4 stars because of the good value (do the math on some of the portions though) and because the offal is anything but awful.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,10,3,4,rP851heQN8JBiXq2MQ93iA

This place is packed but the great thing is that while you wait, and yes you will wait, people come and go so you can find a seat in the 6 bench style tables they have.    Although this is a 5-6 mile off the strip location you need to give it a try.   It's really cheap and the portions are large as long you know what to order.   
The wings are small so what you want is the fried chicken.   I started by ordering the pulled chicken and waffle for 3.99 and additionally I wanted to grab a 2pc fried chicken snack which comes with fries.   Go with the fried chicken as those are good portion sizes.  
They only con here is the 15-20 min wait, I actually waited longer.  Be patient and if you ask them to check on your order all they say is 4 minutes longer.   You always have the ability to order ahead and they don't seem to have it together.  My review is strictly on the quality of the food and it's ALL GOOD.   Please improve the service if possible. They are very friendly but it seems a lot of people are frustrated although they give you a number when you order.   

Review of the food:
Pulled chicken and waffle was bomb.  Sooo good I inhaled it.  I'm very happy I drove 5 miles for a 3.99 piece of paradise.  

2pc fried chicken snack was some of the best fried chicken I've had.   The seasoning is super tasty and the tenderness of the chicken inside will be a revelation in of itself.  If you could eat bones you just might. 
The bun is very tasty and it is not buttery so maybe you can ask for some of you need that butta face.  
The fries are legit but I was all too full to give it my best and try to finish.  I just nibbled on a few and they are definitely fries that you will enjoy that are not so salty.   
The owners are middle eastern and very nice so say hi to them.

On my first time visit, I almost ordered the whole menu since the prices were so great! 
Heres what we ordered....

Chicken and waffles : BOMB.COM! Waffle was fluffy and chicken was cooked to perfection. You get 2 big pieces of chicken and the waffle is also generously big. Definitely worth $4 .

Southern fried catfish : This was fried to perfection. The seasoning was on point!  If you like catfish, you must
 try.  

Fried Gizzards/Liver : You can't find food like this really anywhere, so it's hard to compare it. They were crispy but could use a little more seasoning. They give you a large portion for a low price.  Still good though.

Lemon pepper wings : Amazing! Fried to the perfect crisp and the seasoning was so good. Dip it with the hot sauce and it tasted even better!

I highly suggest for the owner to just print out the menu on paper and tri-fold it for return customers.  

The fish was really good and well fried AND they give you a lot. Hubs and daughter liked the chicken and said it was well seasoned. i'm saving the wings for lunch tomorrow. I tasted one and it's good too. Quite honestly, I thought the food pricing was super cheap. The paranoia in me wondered, ""is this really fish and where did they get them chickens?""

I ordered the Southern Fish with fries and Joel ordered the Chicken and Waffles. We both shared some chili cheese fries as well. The prices are great. For both of us, with drinks, it came out to under $20. My Dad ordered the same as me and spent under $6. You get several pieces of fish and the cornmeal breading is so full of flavor. I thought mine was great, but Joel's chicken... Wow! I wanted to rip it away from him. I wanted to order more chicken just for myself, but I was so full from the fish! His waffle was cooked crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Now let's talk about those chili cheese fries. They came in a large to go container smothered in chili and cheese! What more could you ask for! YUMMY!

The only down side is that there is no bathroom, but they do have a sink so you can wash all the tasty goodness off in. Also, be prepared to wait 'cause they cook everything to order. Which is totally fine in my book!

Although the chicken and waffles is a great value, this wasn't the best I ever had. Not on Roscoe's level. I think maybe it was the waffle. It wasn't as crisp as I'd like it.

Now with that being said it's only right that my first elite yelp go out to one of my ultimate favorite chicken spots Sunnys market, since it was on the westside (lake mead and D Street), I've been eating from sunnys. I was around 12yrs. and since day one my experience has been incredible and I have not been able to find another chicken spot with the same flavor and great price! 

Sunny himself has an awesome personality, once he knows you he makes sure to greet you (he likes when you say what's up sunny), even if he doesn't know you he still makes you feel welcome.

Because sunnys is mainly found in pretty rough neighborhoods it's really easy to pass it up, but hood or not I've seen every race and almost every working class citizen ordering from him! 

Sunnys menu is very simple with a southern style swing, my favorite is the hot wings and the 2 piece snack (breast and wing) with a side of fries. It's best to order if it's around lunch time but everyone knows if sunny answers his phone consider it a miracle! 

So If your ever on the east side (Washington and lamb) area make sure to stop by and check him out for yourself it's an experience you'll never forget!

I ordered the southern fish and it was good, but could have used some more seasonings.  My daughter got the cheese steak sandwich and that was delicious.  Perfect amount of onions, peppers, cheese  and meat. I'll deffinetly go back again.",Ta0OYIgUFxPNXdO_ZAQYag,0,0,4,RYTshJdj72i4xx8XA9rJqg

It was PERFECT, A1, THE BOMBBBB!!!!! We got the 40pc with 2. Large Sides of fries. $25... Yhe wings seem a little larger than wingstops wings but these are actually a lot tastier!!! My 7 year old had 8 pieces. He ate more than me and my husband who both ate 6 and 7. We had lemon pepper and regular hot... The hot was my favorite but the lemon pepper was good too! We decided at the table that this is most definitely our new chicken spot!!!",imDiaw7PGpr3RY-NYQglLg,1,0,5,Jp8mtQHKsYgR133GG2uKiA

The food is really good but The wait time and general inconvenience didn't offset that. If you aren't in a hurry and want reasonably good food for a good price and time isn't an issue then this is a good option",4LHNxFSdWZG_fXpm_V4yEA,2,0,3,8BLvh7lXJkssbRD25ICE8w

You may see the building and think this place looks suspect but they have great food and customer service.  We place our order ahead and no wait.,0m6jLKOnu_UO4sjc9T5mPg,2,1,5,WJZ6ex_FOvXhUpDN69AGoA

It is better than the old Sunny's as far as no one trying to hustle you on the way in, but it will get that way because I notice more and more hoodrats coming about. The first order was for my husband and his chicken was bloody. I gave them the benefit of the doubt because it was very thick chicken that sometimes people accidentally under cook. The other customers are sometimes rude as hell! 
I like the chicken livers (since I'm anemic) and have not had a problem with those. The workers are polite. Sometimes it smells funny in there but other then that the place is clean. The orders are limited and fries are too greasy.",6UQlnFvSr5dUJuy0RA-M2Q,2,0,2,rr6nw08YpWViJaSDWBNMjA
