1531720,2016-11-15,0,niuHdk9fwX0IJG1zMAHcig,Went through the drive thru today and I must say this was the best Jack-In the box I have ever eaten. Everything was made just right/ just how I like it. Everything was extremely fresh and hot and the customer Service was decent . Highly recommend,ZfLXVsOHH6U-QvFUn6YPyg,0,0,5,fY18lHt-VtDR9XeAeSxoig

I was expecting the food to be ready really quickly. I ended up sitting at a table and waiting for about 10 mins, during that time the CSR for the front was arguing and fighting with another worker in the kitchen area. Finally after several mins, my food was ready. As I was leaving the parking lot, I checked my order and to my amazement everything was wrong. As I walked in and started to explain that my order was wrong, the CSR cut me off and grabbed the bag and started once again arguing with the manager and the other employee that she had previously been fighting with. If everything could go wrong for those poor guys it did that night. I have them a star for showing up for work. Hire you a new CSR or Front person!",Qc19yy3ejz7RoKJTMlZXkw,0,0,1,8t-Sg-sI0u8wcAPAJ3t7Vg

The last two times they forgot to give me the recite then lied to me about it, even taking my food and not replacing it leaving me with nothing just a bill and no food.... bad management and rude customer service.",qFvgK92Py03r5tINA6nxQQ,0,0,1,yH1M9-Dv5mAa_KmhI_RLvQ

That's right nothing missing... Which is amazing nothing worst than driving away and noticing they forgot half your order!!,SIGQgzGkVb_EHsRIvskmmA,3,1,4,1QeMcLIsbHc4Ln2ZYPFvvQ
