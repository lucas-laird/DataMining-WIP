The only thing is they forgot to give us our sodas. But can't knock them for that. I would def return and I am not from Vegas.,W21G4595mrDAFjALYRxPmg,1,0,5,Hc5SowQPOKpTam68q_HGHA

The price is about average from most places I ordered from, but you get a lot of food for the price. The only complaint I have is that I ordered a deep dish, but it didn't really seem like a deep dish you would get from Chicago, but was good overall. I would probably recommend the stuffed crust if you were looking for something more to the pizza.",mR3YSmJazuwCXMhgSzVzrw,0,0,4,JQWSRRzR7vL00oBWKVWEdQ

The garlic bread was tasty but at $6 for two Texas toast sized slices seemed a bit expensive. I ordered the deep dish pizza and was so impressed with it. Really enjoyed the crispy crust, great cheese, decent amount of toppings. Service was good on arrival for my pickup. There are still a lot of things on the menu I am curious about trying. Based on the pizza I had, I will definitely be going back. And I'll also be trying some other menu items.",lzb-yR3m83mv8N4hr4Gcww,3,1,4,UUn1Z44VaYVf5vQ-sI0HKw

1837037,2017-03-29,10,U00_w-9WRddd5R_RGdzA0A,"Came in when they offered half off for all online orders as part of a promotion- join their email club and find them on social media to be updated with this info, as it seems to happen fairly often. The food itself was good, and the discount made it even better. 

FOOD
The pizza is the highlight, available in thin crust and Chicago deep dish style, which is similar to Pizza Hut's pan pizza rather than Giordano's. Crispy, thick, buttery crust was great. The 9"" medium is enough for two to share if you add on an app.  They offer several (9?) signature pies, the Parmigiana is their take on Eggplant Parm with sliced roasted eggplant and tomato. Great choice. 
Wings are nicely meaty, app portion is ample for the price (9 wings for $8). No flavors available to specify for sauce, bleu cheese or ranch dip available prepackaged.
Salads are available in half and full sizes, few different varieties, fresh produce in a decent sized portion. Prepackaged dressings. 

SERVICE
The staff are friendly, the online ordering system is easy to use, and my pickup order was ready within 5 minutes of the scheduled time. There is counter service only, majority of business seems to be takeout and delivery. The guys were nice, but out of three items ordered only one was received correctly. Pizza was supposed to be half and half, wings were supposed to be hot with bleu cheese (received mild with ranch).",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,22,10,3,dK7VVa6c4etF7cca7Z7B6A

2293937,2016-10-16,0,U00_w-9WRddd5R_RGdzA0A,"This place is severely underrated. SEVERELY!!!! My son wanted pizza and we saw on the news they had a grand opening. So we went a few days later. The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I notice they wash their hands before touching your food which is a plus. KEEP IT UP STAFF BECAUSE WE DO LOOK FOR THINGS LIKE THIS. We ordered the Italian sausage with onion and as we were waiting another female came in and we heard her order and say ""I want the Chicago Beef like I had the other day"". Then I asked her ""is it that good that you are back a few days apart""....She said ""Oh my goodness, you should try it!!!"". I then felt like I ordered the wrong thing but when our pizza came to the table I was totally satisfied. This place has some of the best pizza crust that I have tasted in a while. This is not soggy pizza by far. However, a week later me and my son was in the area because I had a doctor appointment and he normally goes with me when he is out of school and we stopped by and ordered that Chicago Beef. We mixed it with with the Italian sausage and onion and man on man. What a pizza!!! I told the manager who is a female, you have to get out and advertise. Even if you have to stand on the corner and give out free samples. Vegas has a thousand + pizza restaurants and in order to survive as a pizza business here you have to go to the people. Meaning, go set up a booth at a high school football / basketball game; get a booth at a busy gas station where traffic is thick and let people sample your pizza. Again, great affordable pizza, but you got to do better with advertising. We will be back!!!",zEJ1kX5pFy664VJLfLOBqg,1,1,5,pO4zTj115gSGLkf6rSxhgg

However, I do believe this will be the last time we go to pizza 9. She ordered a tiramisu for dessert. About half way through my moms dessert (which she never usually gets) she keeps saying this tastes funny, well she notices that there is writing on the bottom and flips it over to see an expiration date of 3/25... today is 3/31. Dairy and eggs are not something you mess around with. Irate I call pizza 9 because this is dangerous for people's health. They inform me that they ""check"" their products daily. This item expired 6 days ago, so I asked if she was telling me that for 6 days they missed the expiration on this item?!?

Usually I'm try to be more calm, but I almost died from ecoli when I was 7, food born illnesses are something i don't play around with.  Sorry pizza 9 while you were my #1 pizza joint for a while we will not be returning.",JdJ2z22XMY3XX39WAz1vNA,3,0,1,xz0oUOu4D0wifVArKqxvLQ

It's a family-owned franchise location that hails from my home-state of NM and it beats Pizza Huts, Papa Johns, Dominos, Metro Pizza, and Little Ceasar's for traditional and Chicago style pizza 9 out of 10 times not to mention that it's the only place you can get Hatch green chili on your pizza!

5515935,2017-07-16,0,U00_w-9WRddd5R_RGdzA0A,"So far, i had been very dissapointed with most of the ""best"" pizza places we have visited here in Vegas. I thoroughly understand and respect  that we all have VERY different opinions of what ""great"" pizza should taste like. From the dough type, sauce ingredients to the amount of cheese it should have. Thin crust, deep dish, square vs round, etc. But i think we can all agree that flavor, quality of ingredients and the proper combination of them is crutial to execute a great tasting pizza. Well i think this place met most expectations when it comes to their pizza. We ordered 2 medium pizzas, first one basic pepperoni and cheese. Second one Hawaiian style. The crust was amazing! Crispy at the edges yet soft and doughy. It  had the right balance of sauce and cheese, as well as toppings. The pepperoni was specially  tasty. My family ate the entire pizza and they all commented on how much they liked it. This was a pick-up order and the pizza arrived hot and steamy. The size of the pizza did not dissapoint either. This was the first time we have ordered from here and considering some of the reviews on this restaurant, I am not sure if we got lucky with our order, if the service and quality has in fact improved recently based on the reviews or if it had been a long time since we had bought pizza from any restaurant around here, but our experience was so satisfying, that we will definately order from this place again.",h6MRkc8h4_anyLtYGbL0bg,0,0,5,3wUQ4R7sWDTEDImV-4pd-A
