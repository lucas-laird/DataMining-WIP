Maybe cause I was craving another Hawaiian restaurant that sadly just closed. I could almost taste their garlic shrimp. We decided to venture off to this spot since it was the closest. The mac salad wasn't the best or worst I've ever had. The fried shrimp was nothing to brag about. And the spicy kim chee was anything but. I'll give this restaurant one more shot. I'm hoping the shrimp sandwich will WOW me :)",QiyvjCMCGhqscz26JcfEkw,0,0,3,spMuqzhFE8ulPNJka9HJpg

1151780,2010-05-09,0,rifLWKQUwANsYNMbndjYww,"The food is pretty good when you're in the mood for some Hawaiian food.   And it comes in large portions.  Some of my picks are chicken katsu, spam musubi, loco moco, manapua, sesame beef, and curry shrimp.  The dining room is very clean and well lit.  The staff is always really nice too. There are better places to eat hawaiian food like Aloha Island Grill or Ohana Hawaiian BBQ.  However,  I choose this place over aloha kitchen.",y0yjngIzeIevhpYKJXjkCA,0,0,3,ylVVbYM6uP_LNvjutx0eWw

The mixed BBQ plate is like Korean BBQ which I like, the chicken katsu curry YUM, the donuts are to die for. Love the mac salad. The first time I tried spam musubi I thought I had gone to heaven.  I had to stop coming here or I would have a serious weight problem.  Have tried Aloha ans LL and thought they were awful compared to this place",or9VwGPVMkBPS1ReXcg6kA,0,0,4,wP82WcQVCo0LgZCWtUdgVA

3457315,2008-10-21,1,rifLWKQUwANsYNMbndjYww,"Best Kahlua Pork I've ever had! Came on some cabbagey kind of yummy stuff with some pickled other vegetables and some white rice. I almost downgraded it to 3 stars because the traditional Hawaiian macaroni salad grossed me out. But then again, I'm not a fan of traditional Hawaiian macaroni salad, so maybe it's just me. 

I ordered a side of kimchi that tasted homemade and was the perfect mix of what you love in kimchi.

I'm looking forward to trying more things at Hawaiian BBQ.

p.s. they are currently giving out free soft drinks. No clue how long that will last.

p.s.s. delivery in a 3-mile radius!",KefuZdgU_o1A6GM95T39Nw,4,2,4,cuqjZpYZkoS8JRmGecBLhw
3467194,2010-12-10,1,rifLWKQUwANsYNMbndjYww,"I've been on a Hawaiian BBQ binge since I first went to Ohana in the Southwest a few months ago. This place definitely isn't as good as Ohana but it sure comes close. The selection is certainly much bigger but the food just isn't as good. I was happy to finally get some decent chicken katsu after my disastrous experience at AA Hawaiian BBQ.

The guy behind the counter wasn't very nice and after I paid I realized he overcharged me for the lunch ""special."" It is little things like this that separate the ok places from the great ones. I would suggest going here during lunch as their specials are fairly prices and as everyone has already mentioned the portion sizes are more than adequate for lunch AND dinner. Just make sure they charge you correctly!",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,1,1,3,dMagTse07A61C8vR8FgftQ
4435012,2011-01-21,4,rifLWKQUwANsYNMbndjYww,"Finally....Kuge has stepped FOOT...into the Yelp universe to make his first review.

Kuge was pleasantly surprised to see this Hawaiian BBQ establishment in great shape and was welcomed instantly by the woman at the counter.    With the $5.95 lunch special Kuge was ecstatic to see they had a wide variety of options available at his disposal.

So the Great One decided to take on the Chicken Katsu which came with a full serving of fried rice and a drink.  Kuge and his roommate decided to dine in and before we were finished discussing 101 different ways to lay the smackdown on jabroni's candy-asses, the server had delivered the food.

Kuge was extremely satisfied by the speed and friendliness of the staff, the only thing now was to see if his entree held it's own vs. The Great One.

With heaping helpings of katsu and fried rice, it was more than enough to please Kuge.  But Kuge has to be honest here, when it came to overall taste he believes that even though it was above average, the katsu with sauce didn't deliver completely.  The Great One's feelings about the fried rice was the same.

But no worries Yelp Universe, Kuge was so pleased with the overall quality of food, service, and portions that he won't check Hawaiian BBQ into the Smackdown hotel!

As a matter of fact with the option of Boba Tea that they serve, Kuge will definitely be coming to Hawaiian BBQ in the future with an empty stomach and he can't WAIT to take on the BBQ beef.

Overall, Kuge is willing to give Hawaiian BBQ 4 People's Eyebrows out of 5.",UER4m0CBVgcFlVbMqhCvCg,4,3,4,b6G7vxvylnITL6JL77vDUQ
4577465,2010-08-14,0,rifLWKQUwANsYNMbndjYww,Amazing service. Fast and delicious food. Closest place to me that has spam musubi. The prices are not to bad either. They even have some tofu dishes.,3DjTbhg_HndAxtRnRBt0aQ,0,0,4,Kd3IfHE-sZz6n4akd0g8RQ
4749755,2009-04-29,2,rifLWKQUwANsYNMbndjYww,"Since I've moved up north, this place is conveniently located two blocks from me. Yet I still buy Hawaiian BBQ from Ohana, all the way down SouthWest, whenever I'm in the area. I have 3 reasons why I do this. 

1. They ask too many questions at the counter. I'm paying cash. I have it in my hand. It's not a debit/credit dilemma, dude. First-day jitters. It's ok.

2. What the fuck is kimchee doing in the upper left-hand corner of my to-go box? Why is my Katsu sauce thin and oily? Why are my malassadas thin and oily? Why do my kalbi ribs bulgogi?

3.  They should rename it Korean BBQ.


The food is alright, the portions are ample. Customer service is ok, the guys running the place are friendly. No complaints there. 

But I like the trans fats better at Ohana.",A2HbQtcuK2tkegX7BXcEtg,2,2,3,oR31TdkA7GqR_pEpwFM8Rw
5261118,2010-12-19,1,rifLWKQUwANsYNMbndjYww,"I love Hawaiian BBQ, and this place satisfies my ridiculous cravings for big portions of barbequeued pork and steak at once.   The price is a little painful versus other places you could eat on a lunch, but for $9 I can have both of those and two cups of rice aaaand a little shotglass of macaroni salad.  Which I hope no one actually shotguns.   But anyway, it's quality food here.",5tFUXNnFh7g1V2waWvQfbA,1,1,4,HeVO06w6Dlt1B5uCSgOfug
