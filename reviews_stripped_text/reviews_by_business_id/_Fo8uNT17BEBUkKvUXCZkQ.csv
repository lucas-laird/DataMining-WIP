And I don't say that lightly I am a taco fanatic when I came here for the first time I didn't expect me to wow me but they did. Only thing I would change is for them to have more locations in Las Vegas maybe closer to Henderson.  Prices beat their competitors!,-WkOUvcE8Ei4CVclqRGe1A,0,1,5,4ZjjyO9XHM1j2WKud6Mf7w

They are the best for this side of town and there prices are reasonable I believe they have a sale on Wednesday's too. Also good costumer service the lady there already recognizes us she super friendly. It's a nice little restaurant next to a gas station kind of an odd place but big enough has tables and chairs.

This was my first visit and I was helped by a mature couple. She took my order and he prepared it. The menu is basic: tacos, burritos, quesadillas, enchiladas, drinks and this is a GOOD thing. The word ""la carreta"" translates to the wagon so the menu relates to what you might expect of a taco wagon or small taco truck. There is no salsa bar but they included a red and a green sauce with my to-go order and they were both spicy and tasted fresh. I ordered two tacos each of the al pastor and the carne asada. My favorite is the al pastor because it was tender with a little heat plus a hint of sweet from the pineapple. The carne asada tacos were generous, nicely seasoned and chopped in easy small bite size pieces. All of my tacos were priced nicely at $1.50 each. I will definitely come back but I'm torn about ordering the same thing because it was so good or trying the rest of the items on the menu.",rd8n2yzHUEgOPeVXbKODwQ,2,0,5,VA6IQ4h9vm8PutjkgvvaLQ

Delectable carne asada tacos, seasoned and cooked well doesn't seem like a difficult order, but I'd given up on trying to find them in this town. I've been to many taco spots and they seem to focus on their pork dishes. The street tacos at La Carreta are flavorful and tender and, yes, greasy. They take a few minutes to come out and they are worth it. The tacos are well priced and the service is always professional.  

Thank you to the other Yelpers who found it for me. I'm glad it's quite a ways from me otherwise I'd be stopping by on a regular basis. I enjoyed their consome, but I'm a creature of habit who is not interested in the rest of the menu. Come here for the tacos.

2013526,2017-03-16,16,_Fo8uNT17BEBUkKvUXCZkQ,"My husband and I are on the cusp of having lived in Las Vegas for 4 years. We moved here from LA near the 10 and 110. Basically, we know our tacos. 

We've had good tacos in Las Vegas, but none ever compared to the street tacos from a stand or truck somewhere near an LA freeway. 

This all said, I took my husband here for lunch about a month ago after months of insisting it was worthy of his consideration. He's gone back several times since, declaring their tacos the best in Las Vegas. I've been along for a few. 

The carne asada taco is available for $.99/ea on Wednesdays. All of the meats are well prepared. The pastor is sweet and charred. The barbacoa is moist and tender. The chorizo is flavorful and just the right amount of sweet. The asada is beefy and crisp. The lengua is tasty. Carnitas will be added to the ""one of each"" taco order. 

The salsas are literal and figurative FIRE. If you like your nose to run while eating (which I do), load up on the salsas. 

The interior consists of 3 - 4 four-tops, a counter for ordering, one large trash can, and a large flat-screen TV above the salsa bar. The storefront is next to a gas station. It's not a place for a large party sit down. In fact, most guests order the food to go.",5DFshFQlbQiQTvtzH7qwlA,32,26,5,arEYROFF13VMD7C3atWdig
