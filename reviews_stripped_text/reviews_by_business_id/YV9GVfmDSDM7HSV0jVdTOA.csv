 KFC was not an option there but driving by, we did see El Pollo loco which kind of made me want to try thanks to Spanish Class.

 First walking in, it smelled sooo good but what made me stop my tracks were the burnt looking chicken on the grill. I had the moment where I was like ""Lets get out."" But my mom wanted the family meal so oh well.

We had recieved a huge meal which was apparently too big for the small hotel tables. The churros were amazing as was the salad. Too much tortillas and not enough rice and beans was my dad's opinion.

The chicken was AMAZING! The thought of the burnt chicken on the charcoal went poof out of my mind. It was crispy on the outside and so flavorfull on the inside. 

We ended up going there at least 2 times before leaving.
 (The second time we took it to Red Rock Caynon for lunch)

A few years or so ago, El pollo loco restaurants opened up in Georgia where I live now. I was super excited and my family and I ate there at least once a month (we lived 40 mins away). Everything was good until they just closed. My family was pretty bummed about it. 
We were in Vegas for a few days last week for vacation and of course, we had to eat at our favorite grilled  chicken place. This location was close to our hotel. The food was delicious as we remembered. We got the family meal and also the new shrimp tacos. Everything was great and delicious. One of our boys who only had El pollo loco a few times when they were briefly opened in Georgia kept saying, "" I forgot how the food tasted but now that we're eating it again, I know why you love it so much"". If you like chicken, you have to go to El Pollo Loco.
Btw, if you need to go to the bathroom, you have to ask the cashier for a token. You then take the token and insert it in the lock on the bathroom door. It was pretty neat. Haven't seen anything like that before.",NYKYkmwJY2D17wjjD3EwUQ,0,0,5,JPeR3qYfZEas5QDGdtmi2A

Ok, 1st of the service was horrific, and they were so unorganized. I promise no pun intended, but ""chickens w/ their heads cut off"". Just eww, then waited 30mins for a damn grilled chicken salad.

Now you may ask: ""Demetria, why did you not just walk out?""

That is a good question indeed, and the answer would be: I wanted that salad for 4 days and I was finally on a side of town that a el pollo loco. FUNK that, I was getting my salad.

Well guess what, I got my salad and has UNCOOKED chicken on top. I couldn't drive back, but he time I made it home, they were already closed.

I called the next morning and got no answer, just the answering machine. So after calling for 2days w/o a response I called corporate. These mf's didn't do $h!t, I was told: ""all we can do is contact the owner and its up to him to call you back"". Are you serious???? So what you are telling me that you're cool w/ one of you franchise is serving RAW F@$&:NG CHICKEN??? 

So I'm so cool on el pollo loco, make sure you food is COOKED FULLY before you walk/drive away.

If I could give NO STARS I would, b/c that is not f'n. The health dept. needs to make a trip down there and I no longer eat at ANY el pollo loco, I had to cancel them out.

4259468,2015-04-29,0,YV9GVfmDSDM7HSV0jVdTOA,"We generally have four choices (robertos, chipotle, baja fresh) for fast-food mexican, and this is one of my favorites. The chicken is really good-tasting, seasoned very well, and so are the seasonal meats (carne asada, carnitas, shrimp---I've had the bowls, burritos, tacos, tortilla soup, and salads) are very good as well, I've tried all of them except for fish. With coupons in the weekly papers and other promotions ($5 meals), it's a monthly staple.

This is the first time we came to this one, though, on the far corner of a shopping strip mall (20 locations in LV & Henderson). It's small, clean overall (there was a food mess with rice grains at the floor of our table, but the employee swept it up for us), with a bathroom. The salsas are at the front counter. The drink machine (free refills) is near the seating (mostly booths). Highchairs are to the right side of the drink machine.

Hubby got a shrimp burrito and I got the shrimp ultimate double bowl (to share with our son), which was yummy. It's nice to see our son eat his food, because sometimes he can be very picky. He likes the bowls and he likes rice. The weekend before, we tried the carne asada, and that was very tasty, too.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,0,0,4,WPfN5jeb8lbQ2T75E14vuA
4459203,2013-04-22,4,YV9GVfmDSDM7HSV0jVdTOA,"Fire grilled chicken...Do I give them an extra star for having healthy eats? I don't know. I don't like giving chain restaurants more than 3 stars!

This place seems pretty authentic...they have an orchata machine. I don't think I am a fan of that rice, cinnamon drink combo though.  Hey, to each, their own!  

Concerned with the pricing versus portion size however.  I hate paying a premium price for anything, and getting a little bit of product in return.  I don't like paying that much and possibly feeling hungry afterwards.  I could have gone to another chain restaurant, and eaten off the dollar menu, and ensured myself a full stomach.  

Good taste and skin crunch to the chicken. You can taste the spices on the chicken, which is always a plus in my book. Bland fowl...is well..fowl!  Sorry, had to do it!  Sides are decent in taste, presentation, yet not portions. Macaroni and cheese actually tasted as if they put some time and thought into it.  Corn cake had nice texture and sweetness.

All in all, not a bad place.  If it is around, I would make stops here on occassion.",5O0ejMUB7XHzyTf1rLu2zQ,7,4,3,Z-6IZsSKXj44Hl3o1N06tA

We went inside and quickly decided that it was a great deal after looking at their menu prices. We went up to the cashier and placed our order and was promptly told that they were out of legs and thighs!!!! I asked the cashier if they were substituting anything else for the same price and she said no. I said how long will it take to get the advertised special, she said 20 to 30 minutes!!! I was in complete shock and disbelief!!! A restaurant that sell NOTHING but chicken was out of ANY kind of chicken is ridiculous!! I asked her again could she substitute something else and she again said no! We drove across town to the El Pollo Loco on Stephanie St and they had plenty of chicken as all El Pollo Loco restaurants should have.
