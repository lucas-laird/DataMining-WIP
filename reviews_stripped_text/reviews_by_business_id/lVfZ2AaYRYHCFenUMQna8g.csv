The burrito had a ton of beans, maybe even three times more than anything else and pretty salty for my taste. There was almost no guacamole and when I found where it was, the guacamole wasn't even mashed and looked like 1/4 of an avocado just thrown in half assed. Hardly any cheese but the meat was good.

734022,2011-12-20,0,lVfZ2AaYRYHCFenUMQna8g,"Almost all the good Mexican restaurants near where we lived have closed over the past 2-3 years so we found ourselves having to drive ever-farther from home to find good burritos. That is, until we saw some poor soul with a yellow Superman-type T-shirt swinging a huge arrow-sign  with ""Super Burrito- Super Good!!!!!"" standing on a sidewalk near this place. We didn't want to encourage that sort of threatening advertising so we didn't go in that day, but once we did get here, we found out it was indeed Super-Good (with one exclamation point at most, though.)

The menu is short and sweet- burritos! Many different types and sizes to choose from and mix-and-match, from the mini bean-and-cheese to the Super Burrito with guac, rice, pico and your choice of meats (or vegetarian.) We haven't been bold enough to try the tongue burrito, but the chili verde and carnitas are definitely good, as well as the more basic chicken and non-seasoned beef varieties. They also have some enchilada and tamale plates on special but we haven't had those because the burritos are really what you have to go here for. 

As befits a kind of dive-type place, the ingredients are only so-so but put together pretty well once they get in the flour tortillas. The meats are all well-seasoned and the pinto beans are pretty well seasoned too. Chips and salsa is worth it if you are thinking a Super Burrito might not satisfy your hunger, (not sure that would be possible) but you might want to avoid the chips with a nacho cheese sauce which seems to come right out of a can.

There's plenty of seating if you want to stay, but you would have to be a fan of ranchero or corrida music because the owners (or workers) are big fans of a radio station that plays it pretty much nonstop. In a way, though, that fits the general vibe of the place- a burrito bar transplanted from some more urban place (in this case, San Francisco) and plopped down on the dividing line between Las Vegas and Green Valley. 

All in all, if you are looking for pretty good burritos at a fair price, a little out-of-the ordinary and cheesy advertising, Super Burrito is definitely for you.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,2,1,3,9QFASMVDm5kD5WoHIFNNwQ

1998371,2011-01-11,7,lVfZ2AaYRYHCFenUMQna8g,"The overall quality of Mexican food in Henderson makes me want to cry.  Most of the decent taquerias are at least several miles away on the east side of Vegas.  And with the exception of the Lindo Michoacan chains in Henderson, I haven't found any food that is Mexican and noteworthy within the town limits. . . 

That is until Super Burrito opened recently.  Driving down Eastern a few months ago, I suddenly noticed the place were there.  So I stopped in.  And after the first visit, I've kept stopping in and stopping in and stopping in and stopping in. . .  

Super Burrito is a top notch taqueria.  They do a great job with the classic burritos-- carne asada and chicken.  Well-prepared meat with delicious beans, rice, cheese, sour cream and guacamole in a nice tortilla.  Each time I order one, I weep for my teenage self who suffered by repeatedly ordering Taco Bell, not knowing what he was missing.

If that was all that Super Burrito did, I would give them a solid 3.5 stars, but what pushes them into the four star range are the different sauces and flavors they cook into their meats.  I have fallen in love with their green chile pork.  Spicy and sweet and tender.  It mixes perfectly with warm pinto beans and just makes me happy.  I've also tried the coca-cola pork, which was crispy and interesting, but a little sweet for me.

Each time I go in now, I make sure to ask what meats they have in case they offer something new to wow me.  Whether they come up with new offerings or not, Henderson finally has a good taqueria.  And that's something to celebrate.  I have no doubt that the town council will host a parade in Super Burrito's honor right after they have their first taste.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,9,6,4,FAJ05YiaU75OoNd2fzXPAA

Also, the fact that they have a drive thru is such a plus. 

Grab a breakfast burrito on a Sunday for a great hangover meal or try their San Francisco burrito (basically a ""California burrito"") - you can't go wrong. I think I like this place so much because you can tell just by looking at their food that it is cooked fresh and with quality ingredients. 

Super B Burrito doesn't serve greasy, cheap canned food that's ready in a couple of seconds or heated in a microwave. It's kind of like a cross between Roberto's and Chipotle - not as greasy and heavy as Roberto's with quality ingredients that remind me of Chipotle,, while still maintaining that authentic Mexican taste.

The restaurant is big and open, with plenty of little tables. It's very clean. 

I was greeted when I walked in and was given a minute to look at the menu, without pressure. The menu is small, which I like in a place like this. Granted, I only looked at the burrito options, but this is how it works: they have all the different Mexican food formats (burritos, tacos, tostadas, quesadillas, etc). So you pick your format, then you pick your meat (there are like 8 meats to choose from, which is awesome). The prices are based on the format, not the meat, which is a breath of fresh air. My decision came down to toppings. The Super Burrito has pinto beans, your meat, pico de gallo, sour cream and guac. The regular burrito has just beans, meat and pico. I chose a regular carnitas burrito.

To. Die. For. This is definitely a quality vs. quantity thing. The burrito isn't huge, but enough to fill you up. The tortilla was warm and pliable and didn't even think about falling apart mid-meal. The beans were..beans. Not much you can do with those. The pico was delicious (heavy on the onion, just like I like it!). The carnitas was killer. Moist meat with crispy bits from the grill. At the bottom of the burrito was my favorite part: that delicious meat/bean/pico soup that collects down there. YUM! As if that was not enough, I sampled both of their hot sauces: the red ""hot"" and the green ""mild"". The hot wasn't ""grab a glass of milk"" hot, more of a smokey, pleasant heat. The green salsa was my favorite! It seems to be a puree of cilantro, onion and maybe some garlic. Like pureed chimichurri...heaven!

2931779,2010-12-14,0,lVfZ2AaYRYHCFenUMQna8g,"Finally, Henderson (or the border with Henderson) has a good taqueria. Super B Burrito brings the simple, fresh and tasty flavors of a classic taqueria to the Vegas suburb.  The guacamole: fresh and oh so good.  The pinto beans: fresh and tasty.  The salsa and hot sauce: fresh and spicy.

Super B Burrito does the classics right.  A carne asada super burrito (around $5 plus tax) comes with rice and beans, guacamole, salsa, cheese and sour cream.  And it's good.  Real good.  Even the tortilla is well textured and chewy (i.e. not out of the freezer).  You may have noticed a repetition of the word ""fresh"".  It's a simple, but necessary concept for a great burrito.  Super B Burrito understands that and it's a solid taqueria because of it (and in a valley that has suffered so long with the 1-2 day old tastes of Roberto's, it's revolutionary). 

But don't think that Super B Burrito only offers the classics.  If you're a meat eater, this is your place.  They prepare pork, steak and chicken in a variety of manners.  I had the coca-cola fried pork in my burrito and it was tender and sweet, but not over-the-top sugary.  Here's how good that pork is: I always (always) order a carne asada burrito when first testing a taqueria.  But when we stepped into the place, the guy behind the counter found out it was our first time there and started offering samples of the various meats.  The pork in green chile was spicy and delicious.  But there was no challenger to the coca-cola fried pork.  It's what will keep me going back again and again. 

Unfortunately, one of the folks that came with us ordered the vegetarian burrito and it was less than stellar.  Super B Burrito basically serves up the super burrito described above without the meat as a vegetarian option.  They do add in some lettuce, but it needs a little more oomph--either the typical fajita veggies or at least a couple different types of beans would help immensely.  Without that you really notice the lack of the meat addition.  

So four stars for the pork burrito, two stars for the vegetarian.  How did we get back to four stars overall?  The customer service is exemplary.  Friendly, quick and willing to educate the customer on the taqueria's specialties.  The guy who helped us was so awesome that we were sold on supporting the business before tasting the burrito.  I will definitely be back as a repeat customer.  Hopefully, they'll improve their vegetarian burrito and we can bring the vegetarian back again for another try.",WPNYp3IyJpOSJ4bhFbYAcw,8,5,4,IAp1Oa9F8lR-1TiQKa_XNQ

3075693,2011-07-01,0,lVfZ2AaYRYHCFenUMQna8g,"Here is a little background about San Francisco bay area super burritos.  It is a giant belly bomb with meat, cheese, bean, rice, sour creme, guac, and pico wrapped in a giant tort and then wrapped up in tin foil.  They are all over the bay area.  There basically isn't a taqueria within 100 miles of the bay that if you walked in and asked for a super burrito that wouldn't serve up this delight exactly like this for around 6 bucks.  I have actually carried on La Tapatia burritos multiple times through security at the airport when I come back from visiting home.    

Some of you might be saying, that is no big deal, sounds like chipotle.  Well Mr. Chipotle was working in S.F. and fell in love with these burritos and went back to denver and started up chipotle.  It's true, check it out on wiki if you don't believe me.  Now for me chipotle dozen't really cut it because it's like a watered down corporate version of what a S.F. burrito really is but thats another story.  Imagine a big chipotle burrito but made with the greasy salty food from roberto's and you are close to what it is all about.      

I digress, the owners of this place are from the bay area and they serve up the authentic thing.  If this place was in S.F. it would be a very average burrito place but considering we are in vegas and that this place is pretty legit it hits the spot for sure.  Their burritos are actually a little small for what is normally standard but in reality they are still plenty big enough for all but the biggest gluttons and they are under 6 bucks to boot.  Their 2 locations are the only places in vegas serving these up that I know of (besides chipotle and it's rip offs).  If you know of more help a brother out.   I am going to try their other and way closer location soon but I don't imagine it is any different.

FYI this place for some reason dozen't have rice on their super burrito so if you want the super authentic thing just ask for it and they will put it on, it's better with it IMHO.  

Their steak is all I have tried and it is quite tasty, it's lean, tender, and flavorful.  They advertise that they use sirloin.  Their chips are pretty awesome too and I overheard someone talking about how they have the best super nachos in the world so it's probably worth a try, they are under 6 bucks too.",WANhIVSoD5oIIu2LfKx5Ig,3,2,4,H-1AU-W2pdolJ_RSJqQgIA

We went to the counter to order, and were told that Super B Burrito was no longer honoring the Entertainment coupon out of the 2017 Las Vegas book. The gentleman at the counter was very nice and said that he would give us a 10% discount instead, and that the new management was not honoring the coupon. We politely told him ""no thank you"" and walked out. This is so short-sighted of a restaurant-- not to honor coupons. That's what brought us in there! I imagine most people would have simply ordered and paid the full price minus the 10%, but we left on general principle and will not return. If we would have liked Super B Burrito, we might have become ""regulars"" there, as it is pretty convenient to us. Now, they will never have our business.

The ingredients are higher-quality (like a Chipotle), but it seems more local and is frequented by actual Mexican people (like Roberto's). To add to the authenticity, the menu is in both Spanish and English, and they have Spanish music playing over the radio.
My hsuband and I both got the Super Burrito - his in carne asada, mine in chicken, and they were good. The Super Burrito comes with beans, meat, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sour cream. The meat was good, but the highlights for me were the fresh, chewy tortilla, and the pinto beans. They tasted like the ones your friend's nana would always be making in the kitchen back in middle school. (if you had friends like mine). Price was around $6.50 for a super burrito and a few chips. Note that despite the name, the burrito is not huge Chipotle size. 
Since they have notices about 'nor-cal's best' and other similar claims on the windows, I thought this might be a transplanted California chain, but best I can tell, Super B is unique to Vegas (don't quote me, my research is not extensive).",YIMeEHUYm69m-Mqf-NjPHw,0,1,4,7iZUCf_PyF0vCEj2jLPngQ

When I got here the place was empty except for the workers, so after a quick look at the menu, my guest and I ordered. The menu is pretty large. They offer burritos, tacos, quesadillas, enchiladas plate, nachos, fries, bowls, Chile Relleno plate, fajita plate, tortas and more. Everything was very reasonable in price as well. 

I decided on the ""super"" vegetarian burrito which was filled with rice, beans, lettuce, pico de gallo, guacamole, cheese and sour cream. It was large and tasted delicious! I personally would have wanted some onion and more pico. I'll try and remember to ask for it next time. This burrito was $5.95, well worth the price. My guest got the San Fransisco burrito which was filled with fries, bacon, pico de gallo salsa, and choice of meat. all for $6.95. He said it reminded him of a California burrito. He said the meat was tender and they gave a good portion of meat as well. They offer two kinds of sauces for you to put on your food. A red which was my favorite. It wasn't spicy to me, just a little kick. And a green sauce. This one was not spicy at all. 

The inside was very clean with all tables wiped down and chairs put into their rightful places. The drink station was clean and filled with everything it was supposed to. 

The reason for my 3-star review instead of a 4 is because of the lady taking our order. She wasn't particularly mean or rude, but she kept on staring at me. I would smile and she would just give me a mean glare. She had no personality and huffed when I didn't leave a tip on the receipt.

The quesadilla was a big disappointment.  For paying nearly $3, I expected it to be about twice as big as it was.  The cheese they used wasn't cheddar, I think it was Monterrey jack.

There's a guy standing out front holding a sign saying ""Upgrade your Mexican"" food. After I walked out I had a passing thought that someone should have done the public a favor and tossed a Mexican coke bottle at him to scare him off or something.

I ordered a Super Burrito with chicken, chips and pico with a side of guacamole, and they gave me a small cup of carne asada steak to try. I asked about the Lengua / Tongue on the menu but they guy kept steering me towards the carne asada for some reason. I also ordered some tamarindo to drink. 

The order was made fairly quickly but while I waited I looked around. I'm a little confused by this place. Is it a Mexican place? A San Francisco type place? The whole concept is confusing with Mexican food on the plate and pictures of the Bay Bridge on the wall. 

When the food was done I snapped a picture of it with the Yelp app. It looked good but that's where things went South in a hurry. The chicken burrito was flat. It's bad when a 7-11 microwave burrito has more taste than this handmade burrito did. And the carne asada steak? They need to go to Fausto's and learn how to make carne asada steak. And the guacamole? Heavy use of the salt shaker made it edible but it lacked flavor even with the heavy salt. How can one mess up guacamole? Talk about snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, this place found a way to mess up guac! The only things saving me from leaving with a growling stomach was the pico, the nothing special chips, and the tamarindo which honestly had me wishing I had ordered a Mexican Coke instead. 

On top of that the place just smelled weird. Not a cleaning chemical weird, or a backed up sewer weird, but definitely something was not right in there. 

I really regret going there. And while I will give places second chances this was bad enough that I don't think I'll go back. For the money I spent I could have had Chipotle. Super Burrito is like the anti-Chipotle. It's what Chipotle would be like if they did EVERYTHING wrong.

I came around lunchtime, but the place was empty. Not sure if it was because it was a Sunday and Mother's Day, but I was glad I didn't have to wait around to order. They have a good size menu so it was hard for me to decide but ultimately decided on the San Fransisco burrito. This burrito was huge!! I was hardly able to finish it and I can eat a lot!! The San Fransisco burrito is made of fries, bacon, pico, and a choice of another meat. I got the steak. Each burrito comes with a side of chips as well. No salsa bar, but they do offer a green and red sauce up at the front you can use. The red sauce was a bit spicy for me but the green was delicious.

The inside of the place was clean. Everything seemed in it's right place as well. For the most part, the people working there were friendly with the exception of the lady taking the order. She didn't seem to have any kind of a personality. Oh well. I can't wait to return and try something else!",zudZl2wYpmZYyoklPVhV-A,1,0,4,pvy0qLq9VVRUq4MBycv-OQ

Back when I was a wee little lad, just started working, we would go and wait in line to get a huge burrito in Millbrae, CA. Home of the original Super Burrito store. I mean, this thing was huge, spicy and we would have to take a nap afterwards!

Fast forward to living in LV, I passed by this place several times and did not think it was the same as the California Chain. Then, I saw the signs, read up on this place on yelp and had to give it a shot!

1.  Location - Easy to get in and out of at a strip mall on the northeast corner of Pebble and Eastern.

2.  Ambiance - Clean and simple. Plenty of tables for eat in. You order at the counter. Signs of home sweet home SF and the Bridge! Yeah!

3.  Food - This is a cook to order place, so it is not like all the meat is in a warmer waiting for you, so timing wise, it will take a few minutes.

- Carne Asada Burrito 
- Chicken Burrito
- Carnitas Burrito
- Cheese Quesidilla

All above were pretty awesome. We ordered it as they prepare it, without the rice. Still very tasty.  Now this thing is not power packed like other places. No, it is wrapped nice and tight and has all the right amount of meat and stuff. This makes it easier to eat and to taste the meat.  All the meat was tender and juicy!

We have been getting used to the huge oversized burritos of late, however, the issue is that they fall apart and it is difficult to eat and enjoy it properly. We end up having to use fork an knife and to me that negates the experience and joy of eating a burrito with your hands!

Service was great and very welcoming.

I enjoyed the tortilla also, as it was not thick like store bought ones. You got a little side of chips with the burrito and wish I would order more, next time! They where real tortilla chips and not overcooked. Maybe try some nachos?! 

For a drink we both order some horchata. For us it was not very good, it had way to much cinnamon in it which just made it taste unappealing. Next time just go with a fountain drink. Also, that atmosphere was quiet and not very appealing to sit and eat in. I may just stop here on my lunch break and take it to go.

My wife and I put our play money entitled ""Blow"" down to $100/month, and looking for a good place to eat is a very stressful decision - one that instinctively led to the place where a man held a poorly spelled sign (though I can't for the life of me remember what it was that made me laugh out loud and turn).

""A good taqueria.""  Pssht.  I may only be a gringo white boy (though I swear I'm one-eighth Mexican), I know and love Mexican food.  I've frequented the Roberto's, the Cafe Rio's, the Lindo Michocaon's - they've all been pretty good.  (Cafe Rio is bordering on American Mexican, but I digress.)

But I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for one reason - the meat.  I love the meat.  Their selections are both varied and excellent.  Marinated for hours and clearly seasoned to perfection, I was sold the second they let me test-drive their meats.  Wow.

Actually, I will put my money on Super Burrito over the rest for two reasons - the service.  The people there are friendly and it's clear that they want to do well here.  Smiles and cooperation makes this a solid mexican food joint to at least give a try.

I have a qualm - I have a feeling that they started in San Francisco - mainly because they have the weird decor of the Golden Gate, etc. adorning their walls, but I have to critique the way it's presented.  It's...  awkward.  And I don't know what it has to do with Mexican Food when there's no ""History of Super Burrito"" plaque or something to let me know I'm still, in fact, in Nevada.

Had their nachos and boy were they salty!  But I happen to like really salty nachos, so it worked out.  I've had the burritos.  I've had the taco salad, too, but the burrito is a solid way to start.
