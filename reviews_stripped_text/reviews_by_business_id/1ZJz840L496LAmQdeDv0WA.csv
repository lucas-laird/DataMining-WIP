For the tacos, we picked the al pastor, asada, and carnitas.  All three were good, but too drippy/runny to be great.  (Warning: Be prepared to make a big mess!)

The highlight was the horchata which was the cinnamon-iest I've ever tasted, and I mean that in a good way.  However, a word of advice.  As those of you may have tried the silly cinnamon challenge will know, cinnamon does not dissolve in water.  That means that all the tiny particles of ground cinnamon sink to the bottom pretty quickly.  Just be aware of that, and give it a good stir pretty often with your straw to avoid a sip of cinnamon sludge.",LpRQnAJGw8xhH0_6SNUZ7A,0,0,3,0oH2V__HMrNoapFDCF8zPQ

My husband and I visited Pinche's tacos to see what the hype was all about. We weren't expecting authentic Mexican cuisine,  just good taco shop food.  We waited in line to order for 20mins, waited for our food to be brought to us for another 20 mins! I had the tortilla soup and corn, both were good enough to order again next time.  The mole burrito was missing mole flavor, but I do give credit that they are large burritos that they are selling. All of the food had a very Indian food like taste to it. Rather weird IMO. We did go on a Saturday night,  but that shouldn't be the issue,  I think they need more staff,  1 to possibly wipe down the tables inside, our table was filthy.  Because there are only a few dining options in Downtown LV, I would go again if friends wanted to check out it.

-Pinches Combo which consist of  3 street tacos with our choice of meats (I choose Carne Asada).  Served with Rice, Pinto beans, and some chips
-Cheese Enchiladas
-Mexican Corn



The second time:

-Tostadas
-Mexican Corn
-Side of Rice

The tostadas are so fresh, and the crunch of the corn tortilla was legit!  So yummy, and they were not stingy with the carne asada.. The corn, well it is just mouthwatering, and I crave it all day!!!  Perfect flavors.  Sometimes Mexican corn can be too much, but they get it right every time...

Overall, my experience there has always been awesome!  Prices could be a little cheaper, but you can't put a price on authenticity..  The workers make it feel like your walking into their home kitchen.  

I love that it's in container park as it's an amazing place to be.

I ordered the chicken tacos which come with onions, cilantro, and salsa. They were really, really good. It tasted very fresh and flavorful. The rice and beans were also good. My friend ordered fish tacos and those also looked really good.

My only major gripe is that the drinks are pretty expensive, bottled or fountain. The fountain drinks only come in one size and it's pretty small. It's somewhere around the size of a solo cup, maybe slightly bigger.

The habanero salsa had a good kick and flavor, that may have been the best part and that they had fresh brewed ice tea.

When you walk in you can feel very overwhelmed by the line of people and the chalkboard menu, fear not my friends, they have a smaller printed menu that is easier to navigate.

This restaurant makes americanized Mexican food for tourists, that do not know the difference.

First lets start with the quality of he meats they use, poor grade!
Then lets discuss their red chili sauce tastes like it comes straight from a can.
The fish tacos, are below average, they lack spice and flavor,
The white sauce was bland, and they don't put salsa on their fish tacos, if they did add Pico De Gallo, it was bland.  Overall, bland tacos.

The chicken enchiladas are more cheese enchiladas, it had so much cheese, I had to remove the excessive amounts, just to make it palatable.

What you are getting here is bland, americanized food, called Mexican food.  An irrefutable truth, the food is BLAND.

False ratings by people that don't know what Mexican food should taste like!!!!

I expected to be blown away, instead it turned out to be just some solid tacos. We tried the Al Pastor (Slow broiled marinated pork), Asada (Grilled Angus beef), Carnitas (Citrus scented pork), Adobada (Grilled chili marinated pork), and Pollo (chicken).

The tortillas were smaller than your typical taco shells, you can tell they are homemade. The Carnitas were our favorite, the other meats were just so-so. The Adobada only came with 3 chunks of pork. Tacos all come with cilantro and onions unless otherwise specified.

The taco plates sounded like a good deal with three tacos of your choice (seafoods are extra), rice and beans, with a side of chips. The chips turned out to be a few tortilla chips on top of the beans, the rice and beans each filled their own tiny sectional of the divided paper plate. 

We also ordered the chips with salsa and guac. The salsa was made with fresh tomatoes, onions, and cilantro, but had an odd sweet taste. The guacamole was delicious, and had that chunky avocado texture that I typically crave in a good guac.

It was $21.51 with tip, so decent eats for the price. The staff was very friendly, and they offered indoor and outdoor seating.

When I saw this place (container park) I just had to stop and check it out. It kinda looked like a kids Quest for adults. I walked around checking all those unique stores and places to eat and decided to go into the pinches tacos container and order some food. Not my first time in a container but it is the first ordering tacos inside one. Last time I was in one of those containers there was definitely no tacos or beer for that matter and my ""first"" class travel companions weren't as nice as the people inside this one, but that's another story and what happened in that container stayed in that container, this is Vegas and this review is about pinches tacos.......
The menu. I didn't get to read it all, actually I wasn't really going to try it is a huge blackboard with like a thousand items written all over it. the combo plate for 8.95 any three tacos caught my eyes and I ordered the asada tacos but came up to 10.45 because they charge .50 extra per taco for the asada or seafood. ( asada tacos are made with grilled angus beef.)
Most of the seating is outside but they did manage to include some seating inside and if you're lucky you may find an empty table inside and enjoy your tacos in full container experience, specially if it's freezing outside.
 Tacos were good...very good. I need to go back and try other items, I took a to go menu and been planning my next visit. Tacos de pollo mole and camaron Fritos sounds very appetizing as many other items on the extensive menu.
Service was good, you place your order, you're given a number (a Mexican lottery card in this case) and your food is delivered to your table by a smiling employee that makes sure your experience at pinches tacos is an excellent one.
 If you like good tasting tacos made with quality fresh ingredients and a clean environment, pinches tacos is the place to go. If cheap quantity and greasy food is your thing,.... well Roberto, this is not for you, but you'll be Gordo in no time.

The Good. Location-location-location.  We are staying at the Golden Nugget and it was only about a 10 minute walk down Fremont Street to the location which is inside a very nice area called the Downtown Container Park.  This location houses cute boutiques, novelty shops and dining.  Let's continue with the Good.  The food.  It is a walk in and order go find a seat kinda place.  We walked in both I and my girlfriend ordered the 3 taco plate with rice and beans.  We each got the two chicken and one carne asada tacos.  Both of our meals were very tasty and as I mentioned came with rice, beans and chips.  The chicken was very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The carne asada was delicious with minimal grissle like other places have.  My date is very picky about Spanish rice, but she loved there's.  Me, I am picky about my Frijoles and these were the perfect blend and seasoned well.  The chips were very good, thick, hot and crunchy.  Price.  Wow!  Was only $9.50 per plate.  Great bargain especially for Vegas over priced food.  Would go back again and again.

The Bad.  When I was done I hungered for more......don't want to be a piggy.

The Ugly.  Nothing ugly about this place and location.  The atmosphere was very family friendly with music playing and entertainment all around.",g8RAZbtbqvI7G4ONUOyuJQ,2,0,5,LwfpAx63wjgQSqZ4UmVUmA

We had a selection of other tacos. All nice but pretty standard. Pollo was a stand out one and the Carne Asada Fries were pretty bad ass but mainly because of their fresh guac. The best guacamole  hands down.

This place has my favorite Mexican food in Las Vegas.
The favors are pretty authentic, the staff is super friendly, the prices are very reasonable and of course, the food is amazeballs.

If you go for breakfast, try the Chilaquiles. If you go for lunch, anything will do. I've had their enchiladas, flautas, tacos, etc. Everything is always great.

Is it authentic? Traditional and genuine Mexican cuisine? I have no idea. 

All I do know is:

- I'm so distracted by eating here that I haven't take one picture of my food. Whoa. Serious. 

- Big menu. I love lots of choices, even vegetarian items. Bonus!

- They make a lot of their items from scratch, including their guacamole and re-fried beans. Yummy!

- Location. I get to eat in peace while I watch my boys play in the tree house. Yes, both kids, my toddler and my boyfriend.

- They bring the food to you. I'm sure we've sat at a very far table to see an eye on my son. But they spotted the order number stick thingamabob every time...and fast!

So Pinches has my vote. Their food is what I look forward to when we decide on visiting the park. The chips and guacamole are usually gone by the time my boys come back from the tree house.",q9jCDNZDRUYl2Pwlgxocig,36,29,5,uAWVz33_3huqzeYZPVmdYg

It's tucked into Container Park near Downtown East Fremont, and I do mean tucked - it's almost hidden in a back corner.  I didn't see a title outside, which is probably thanks to its personality-filled name.  I can dig it.

The service was spot on, friendly and fast.  Everyone on staff delivered full smiles and plenty of help to this gringo as needed.  I ordered the taco combo - three tacos of any choice and rice and beans.  Asada.  Al pastor.  And lenga.  Both the carne asada and the pastor were great, simple with a nice flavor and satisfying.

I got my usual order, a carnitas burrito. I like carnitas above all things because it is juicy and flavorful. This carnitas was the opposite of that. It was chunks of meat (at least they didn't cheap out and skimp?) that had no flavor. None whatsoever. How is this possible? I don't know. I ate about half, then just ended up taking the meat out as I went to make it somewhat palatable. I finally went inside to look for some hot sauce and there was nothing out...no salsa, no sauce, nothing. So I had to ask the cashier for some and I think she gave me 2 of those small cups. This wouldn't have been a problem except it was the only thing giving the burrito any flavor and I went through the 2 little cups in about 2 bites. At least that was spicy, to drown out the flavorlessness of the rest of the burrito.

My sister also had a weird dish with no flavor. I can't remember what it was and I doubt she could either.

At night, the Container Park transforms into an adult playground: 21+ only, and the bars and restaurants stay open. Adults play in the playground -- the tree house, the slide, some games, and the praying mantis comes alive. We came on a Monday, so it was quiet. They don't actually have many tables inside, and it's not really that comfortable sitting inside, but I do like their outdoor seating! It seemed like they were cleaning even though they were still open for another hour, so that was odd...However, they were very accommodating in taking our order and friendly, despite the fact that the person taking our order had to maneuver around someone else mopping. 
Food is solid, but not mind-blowingly good. Fun spot to grab a bit, especially at night when the mantis is alive. We got an order of chips and salsa to start and elote (Mexican street corn). I also got a fish and an al pastor taco. OH, and we also got their blood orange margarita. And that's when things started to get fuzzy...The blood orange margarita is super tasty, but also super strong!? 
My friend LOVED their salsa and actually went back to ask for more. And came back with a big bowl. I preferred their al pastor taco to the fish. From what I remember, the al pastor was decent, but not really rave-worthy. Something about the fish taco slaw was off...maybe they put too much cabbage or didn't chop up the cabbage finely enough, or was missing crema? The elote was great! I love elote, so I'm not sure how you'd mess it up in my book. I love that they have it here! And it's served on a stick, so you can eat it right off the cob without getting your hands too messy.",UMD7kQkVPOvjiaFS6Z0CKQ,0,0,3,kR_yrNSCP3RQLYWIKy9Row

Yes, the name of the place is--tee hee--naughty but the food is very authentic, well made and delicious.  The menu is a country mile long.

We split an adobada taco (good), a camaron (shrimp) taco (great), and the chorizo/cheese dip (fantastic) which comes with a ton of delicious, fresh chips.

I also had a michelada for no other reason than very few restaurants offer it. It was nice and refreshing on a hot night.

I can't recommend the chorizo dip enough. It's rich, creamy and the ultimate comfort food.

I quickly got my money back and didn't even receive an apology from the people making the food.

Last night we took my in-laws to the container park because I had heard from friends about how cool all the restaurants and bars are.  We were surprised to find out there are only a handful to choose from, so we picked Pinches, and I of course bit the bullet and decided to give it a try.

Mom ordered the enchiladas with beans and rice. The tortilla was on-point and the chicken was moist and flavorful, but the red sauce is too sweet.

Dad ordered a burrito with lengua. It came with guac, cilantro, salsa, onions, beans, and rice inside.  Everyone really liked it. He also ordered a chicken taco, which was also delicious.

Sean ordered a carnitas torta with onions, guac, Mexican creme, cilantro, and beans inside. It was good- the bread was almost like a flat bread.

I ordered the asada ""not nachos"", which had cheese, guac, beans, green salsa (everyone else's orders came with red), home-made chips, and sour cream (I asked for no onions, so there weren't any).  It was f***ing delicious! I'm craving it even now as I write this review at 9 am and I'm not even hung over!!! The steak was honestly the shining star; it was so flavorful and not overly chewy or hard. Also it was kinda refreshing- everything was fresh and went well together like a flavor explosion in your mouth.  My nachos were definitely the table favorite.

I think we'll be back soon!!!",4slxBUw4gqvUpMynoUN6dg,1,2,4,P5dBD1t3-QiG4aVc1OXUEA

The burrito was filled with mediocre fish and coleslaw. Coleslaw??

They are located inside container park, and that's maybe why when u enter there's space just for 2 tables inside, and about 5 tables out and a few more on a second level. 

When we enter nobody greet, just silence, we didn't even know if we were supposed to sit or make the order on the cashier first, there's no sign. We order about 14 tacos for 3 adults and 1 kid, 2 cokes , 2 corn on the cob and chips with salsa for about 65 dollars...

I scooped up that succulent salsa with homemade chips.  

I had a bite of a chicken mole burrito.  It was so rich and creamy!  The savory taste wafted up from the fresh tortilla.  I don't really like mole but I was loving this.

Carne asada taco - strange flavor to the meat.  Was wondering if I was going to get sick.
Also Ordered a carnitas, and an al pastor taco.  The meat was  bland, could not tell them apart.  One had a spicy red salsa on top that looked like a disinterested tomato.  All the juice had landed on the plate.  This made all the tacos soggy.

First off, in the Container Park in Old Down Town. Such a super cool place to go.
We love bringing visitors to the park. Take them for the obligatory walk down Freemont St, then stroll over to Pinches for your reward! Delicious, amazing tacos!

I always get the taco plate. 3 tacos of your choice, rice and beans. And although I am definitely a gringo, but one my favorite is the lengua tacos (if you don't know, maybe you should not ask.) But the fish tacos are amazing, as are the rest. I have never been disappointed here!

Last time I was there, had a bite of the Torta (a mexican sandwich) - It was awesome too!

Pinches Tacos was my second food choice at the Container Park after Cheffini's POS system crapped out. Pinches Tacos is located right next door to the aforementioned hot dog place, and they offer an array of basic mexican foods like tacos, burritos, and other standard Mexican food menu items. I went with the Adobada Tacos and an order of Flautas to share wth the table. The Adobada was pretty good, great seasoning with a light crunch, plus the addition of pineapple added that sweet factor that's common with marinated pork. The Flautas were ok, but I mostly tasted the fried tortillas and the guac that covered them. The table liked them, but I would have preferred more filling. 

The wait to order food and the wait to get it was brutal, it was at least a ten-minute wait to order and another ten plus to get it delivered, not sure if that's the norm, but it wasn't the best. 

As for the menu using the words ""Fakeixcan,"" ""Pinche Gringo Menu,"" and the ""Estiffy"" taco is super corny, but I'm sure the soccer moms who rage here love it.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,26,18,3,syjjwpNQfiHzR71KdmErng

It all sounds great right? Big menu, little bit of everything from authentic to Gringo. But overall, I was majorly let down when it came to the food. 
Pricing, decent. Service, stellar. Food, bland, average and needs work.
I dined here with my boyfriend, and his kids who are 16 and 17. We got a variety of things from chicken tacos, al pastor tacos, carne asada torta, cheese enchiladas, and some chips and salsa. 
First off, chips and salsa were good and so was the side of super hot sauce. The taste lingered for hours, and I would buy it alone if I could. (wait can I?) 
Anyway, the chicken tacos were eh. The al pastor tacos can't compare to any of the tacos on the Q's taco challenge ventures. The carne meat was good, but the torta was a bit spongy. My enchiladas looked like they were about to take the cake, but again, eh. BLAND with no flavor. Stuffed full of cheese, with the potential to be bomb, and just ended up being a disappointment. 
I felt bad because everyone there was so kind and on their game. But I literally wanted to hit a drive thru on the way home. 
Maybe I eat too much Mexican food straight from LA, or maybe I am picky. Probably a bit of both, but either way- takes more than average tacos to impress me.",NjNJ1JLnMlOfnDI6Oz6Qew,4,0,3,nxl1-oYTLT8mPulhQ239Dg

Why a 3.5? Price. Size. Taste (1/2 star off). 

Picked up the three taco combo ($9 w/ sides of rice, beans and chips), but it's nowhere close to enough food if you eat like a normal human. I'm not asking for Hash House style meals here, but these 'cos are tiny. Mentioning this so you get an extra side or some of that corn, bc you WILL be heading back on line for a few more tacos if you're hungry and only get the special. I suggest going down burrito road if you're looking to fill up. Any who, so yea, I spent $31 on five tacos, 2 beers and an order of chips and guac. Bleh. 

Of the 5 tacos eaten, my favorites were the adobada and al pastor. Each were paired with the perfect amount of toppings and the meat was moist and flavorful. A fun 4 bites for each of those tacos. Least fave? The asada. A bit boring for me here. 

Looking for the best tacos in Vegas? They're not here. Looking for a good taco downtown? It's here and you might enjoy some live music while you dine.

Atmosphere: Different yet cool
The entire menu is written in chalk, which looked pretty cool, if I do say so myself. The music added to the Mexican atmosphere, if that's what they were aiming for. The inside of the restaurant is very cramped, so it's good that there is outdoor seating.

Service: Not bad!
The menu is huge, size-wise and variety-wise. The servers were nice to me as I ordered my food. They handed me a stand with a picture of a calavera, which I thought was pretty neat. Having this meant I knew that they would come give me my food and wouldn't have to pick it up in the cramped indoors.

Food: Authentic and enjoyable
Upon getting my food, it was hot, hot, hot! The foil wrapping my burrito conducted the heat from the beans really well, and upon biting into the burrito I got, the food was steaming! The beans actually tasted like authentic, made with lard and proper seasoning. My burrito was hot and delicious, although waiting for it to cool would not have hurt. The chips and pico de gallo were fresh and tasted adequate.

The tacos were tasty, the asada tacos was one of the best asada tacos I had in a long time and the pork were in chunks which I really enjoy. The prices are higher than the average taco spot but they  use high quality meat and fresh vegetables. Next time I will definitely try something than tacos because everything on the menu sounds delicious.",6qQPmteAArBdB8606R80sQ,0,0,4,4WxIHCWFC31YcOBIIb_4ng

The corn was HUGE and served with cream, cheese, lime and chili. I've only had corn like this served out of a shopping cart on the streets of Las Vegas and Los Angeles. I remember hoping the corn guy would come around so I could have some. This was ten times better than the shopping cart corn (and that was pretty good too). In fact people walking by kept asking where I got the corn.  My boyfriend had the lengua torta and loved it. He gets lengua all of the time for tacos and said this was really good.

We both settled on the Pinches Combo which is 3 street tacos with your choice of meat, I went with Carne Asada, Shrimp and Fish. I couldn't tell the difference between the shrimp and the fish there was so much breading on them. They also charge you .50 cents each taco for ""upgrading"" to seafood. Elote was pretty good, not the best I've had,  little heavy on the mayo. Horchata was good.

For $35 for two people to have street tacos and a fountain drinks, it was a tad overpriced, in my opinion. Nothing was that good for me to come back again.",SfY0jEFqBkrqq9bVi6P31Q,8,2,3,vwHLvMUrZAiSMO8P3oj9Sw

As one of only a handful of places to eat in the Downtown Container Park, Pinches had a shorter line.  But I wasn't particularly going for entrees here since we had some other food already from another eatery.  I did really want to check Pinches out though.  I ended up getting one of the biggest staples you can find on a Mexican menu besides rice, beans, and tortillas.  Corn on the cob!

The Mexican Corn on the Cob from Pinches Tacos was actually not bad, although I prefer mine grilled.  This one looked like it was just boiled or steamed.  It did have the requisite Mexican cream, cheese, and chili powder on it though.  A very good helping of it.  The corn on the cob was a good size as well, enough for two people to munch off of.  Overall taste was good, the sweet corn blended well with the hit of cream and the salty cheese.  The kick from the chili powder was most welcome.  I would definitely have this again the next time I come back to Pinches Tacos.

The thing that took 1/2 star from this review should be no surprise...the price.  Wow, $3.95 plus tax for one corn on the cob?  Seems really high priced for me.  I mean, you can go down to your local Mexican market around town and get the same corn on the cob (in some cases better) for like $2!  There's this Mexican guy I pass by nearly everyday from work who rolls around his little food cart and sells corn on the cob for $2 and his looks just as good as the one from Pinches Tacos.  I must say, the raise in prices must mean the rent at Downtown Container Park can't be cheap.  

Hopefully when I feel like braving the parking and the crowds at this park again I'll be able to stop by Pinches Tacos for another taste.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,0,3,4lgJ8cw5V53tU8nul5Gj1Q

We were THOSE people that came in 10 minutes before Pinches Tacos closed. Now, typically we would understand if the restaurant employees got cranky because hey, they were cleaning up and getting ready to go home. But to our surprise, we got the COMPLETE opposite of that in terms of service.

We were first timers and had heard so much about this place so we were pleased to find the cashier taking the time to talk to us about some of their popular menu items. We also noticed that there were other diners who were talking to the people in the taco line complimenting everything they just ate which only raised our expectations even more.

In the end, we went with the carne asada and the al pastor tacos. I was able to try both and they were good.

Service: They have some friendly people working the counter and the grill.  They bring your order out to you if you're sitting outside which you most likely will as the seating inside is limited.  They do get the food out in a timely manner which I appreciate.

Food: The 3 taco plates comes to you served on a 3 section styrofoam plate along with rice, beans and some tortilla chips.  The tacos were made with fresh ingredients but unfortunately tasted very bland and lacked flavor.  The beans and rice quality was something you can purchase at your local grocery store.  I think they can do better.  The blood orange margarita was decent and and served in a plastic cup out of a soft drink machine dispenser.  I thought they got my drink order wrong and I was served an orange soda, but all was well.

Everything here is pricey, and this is coming from the guy who was upset when Taco y Taco raised their prices at their original location from $2.00 to $2.15. It's $2.60 here at the entry level, unless you decide to try the cactus taco (I didn't). I just went ahead and did the $8.95 combination plate for three tacos (chose al pastor, adobada, and lengua) with rice and beans. I'm not quite sure if the chips were part of the deal or if we actually did get them separately for our entire group.

The food is pretty decent. I really did like the rice and beans, especially the beans. I thought the tacos were each okay, maybe the lengua being the best of the bunch. The al pastor did not come with pineapple, which was disappointing. It was also curious that there was only one tortilla per taco, not two as all the truly good places seem to use.

Long story short, the prices are high and service takes too long.

Short story long, yes, the food here is kind of pricey. $3+ for a small taco. Almost $3 for an ear of corn. And yes, it took a long time to get just a taco and ear of corn. The staff seem to prepare multiple orders before carrying them out to the customers who, in most cases, eat outside. It was getting gusty outside while I waited so I moved inside.

My food came out very shortly after I moved myself inside the restaurant. The al pastor taco came with a goodly amount of pork, a fair bit of onion and cilantro and a healthy laddle of salsa. It was dripping grease and juice. It was a good representation of one of my favorite types of tacos but it was not my favorite version. The house made tortilla was a nice touch though. 

The corn was good as Mexican style street corn tends to be. The crisp kernels of sweet corn took nicely to the crema, cheese and chili. I enjoyed it thoroughly though, again, it was not my favorite version of the dish. 

For me, the food is fresh and service is friendly. I appreciate both. But the price you pay and the time you wait is disproportionate to what you receive.

One of the tables off to the side was rather large, and could fit about 8 people. Luckily, there were a lot of tables outside, and one with an umbrella opened up while we were waiting. 

I ordered the taco al pastor, while my husband got one as well and a taco carnitas. With a drink, the total came to just over $11. The fountain drinks are rather expensive at $2.75. 

When the tacos arrived, I think that we were both a bit surprised at their size. They were about 4-inches in diameter. They looked really good though, and came with a lime wedge. We dug in, and the flavor was really good. Nice chunks of seasoned meat, with fresh cilantro, salsa and onions. The tortillas were also very flavorful.

The price is 3.95, which to me is a little steep. The corn itself seems steamed, and I'm used to the grilled or boiled. It was prepared with your traditional fixings.. I think... mayo, cheese, and chile. To me the taste was super bland and for the price it was not worth it at all. 

It may be because I'm used to the legit eloteros, they slather it with high cholesterol! I mean, butter, mayo, queso, and some tajin. This place fell hella short... the 2 stars is again based off the corn.

We walked into Pinches Tacos, and I noticed how many people were out on the patios happily eating and watching their kids play on the playground. As far as I could see, Pinches Tacos was the food of choice amongst the people eating, so we decided to start here. 

ATMOSPHERE
Walking in, the decor is interesting: pink walls with dancing skeletons. It wasn't creepy, but it was more of a culture-happy vibe. It made me a bit excited to try what was on their menu. 

SERVICE
The lady behind the counter was helpful, very knowledgable about the menu and very laidback, in a good way. She let my sister and I try the blood orange margarita, and while we were doing so, the owner Javier came in a greeted his workers in a friendly manner. Then he jumped into our conversation out of the blue, which actually took us by surprise, but he was actually pretty fun! We took shots ON THE HOUSE from (and with) Javier. Definitely a great experience xD


FOOD:

SHRIMP TACO WITH COLESLAW, the shrimp is plump and juicy, with good seasoning. The coleslaw however is okay. Nothing to write home about, but I would order this again for the shrimp. At $3.15 it is a bit pricey, but service made it taste better.

MEXICAN CORN ON THE COB, with everything, it was delicious. Lots of cheese,  crema and seasonings. With hot sauce, it was just the way I had it on a beach in Cali. Yes, again this was probably a little pricey to, but it refreshing and with the free shot, it was worth the few bucks! 

BLOOD ORANGE MARGARITA, fruity, just the right amount of ice and the margarita mix is strong but delicious

I love their location inside of Container Park. There are several tables inside next to the kitchen and more seating on a deck outside as well. It's a great spot to enjoy tacos on a nice day. 

The street tacos were so good. I was in love at first bite with my carnitas taco. The tortilla was freshly made and definitely not a packaged product. On top of the tender carnitas there was plenty of pico, cilantro, and onion. We also enjoyed taquitos that were served with plenty of delicious guacamole.

4451836,2014-04-05,0,1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA,"A Friday afternoon lunch by myself away from work landed me at Pinches.

I had heard and read the upheaval regarding the name of this establishment and needed to stop by at least once to see it in person. It is in the Container Park, which was nice enough, but considering I was on a lunch break and I just wanted to eat I was pleased to see there was not much of a line outside PInches (which, by the way - does not have its actual NAME on the restaurant).

The place is cramped, to put it lightly. However, the menu board is bright with neon colors chalked on. Select from tacos (of course), burritos, and even Mexican breakfast items. I will be back for you chilaquiles.

You walk up the line and finally get to the cash register and are unceremoniously cramped against people attempting to get to the ONLY soda fountain in the entire place. The place is just entirely too small. But, I ordered an al pastor burrito, with no cilantro, and a small drink, made my way out of the cluster-F of people and sat at one of the two tables they have to the side inside the restaurant. 

Al pastor burrito - comes with meat, beans, salsa, and rice. Meat was not super tasty the way al pastor should be. I was disappointed. Taco y Taco has better al pastor by a long shot. However, burrito was nicely done, ingredients dispersed. You get what you get - and guess what? This place is in a touristy destination, it's a tiny place, and you can't see the meat they're using rotating beautifully, being sliced before your eyes. So - there ya go. 

It is not bad, nor is it great. There are plenty of places around town you can get AMAZING food like this (and probably for less). I would suggest one of the many places on Charleston Blvd.

Anyway, I'll probably be back during another of my lunch breaks for the chilaquiles. If those are any good, the review may change.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,0,0,3,zVdfBWX9pmxGoJ3C3sGdMg

My second visit the food was not satisfying. The carne asada was all meat flavored.  It was not seasoned or marinaded enough.  Again, the rice was a scoop.  Not enough cheese or sour cream and quacamole on the plate which I had to order as an add on.  The salsa was watery and basically made like tabasco sauce style.  The side fried tortia chips wete a headcount of 5.  My Kiddos' dishes were put together like a school cafeteria lunch - no heart in it.

1) The food - it's not good, it's GREAT. I've only been here twice and both times I had a burrito instead of tacos. I had one of the pork and the asada (beef). It was very more-ish! In my opinion, the perfect size for a burrito so you're not left with a heavy brick in your belly and carb crash shortly after. It comes with a side of chips and salsa with just the right amount of kick.

2) The service was friendly and fast. The first time I was there, it was for a late lunch and the food was out in about 5 minutes. The second time I was there, it was during peak lunch time and there was a line that quickly moved, the food arrived at our table between 5-10 minutes. Both times, the people behind the counters were friendly, approachable and gave good guidance in what to order.

3) The atmosphere was relaxed and it was the perfect outdoor lunch during a warm winter day. There's seating inside and outside, I sat outside on the patio where there were ample tables, chairs and heaters. With the warm (not hot) winter sun kissing my skin and my burritos, I couldn't have asked for a better lunch. I will say that the inside seating was a little sparse, due to the size of the stores in the Container Park, but I believe they made good use of the space that they had.

Even used the word Sir, that says a lot about who's getting your food. Good job!

The burrito was a lot fresher and lighter tasting than most Mexican restaurants. The chicken was lightly marinated, moist and tender. The tortilla was also soft and moist with no dry ends.""Rare""

If you're into spicy heat, ask for the hottest salsa they have. It's kind of like an extra hot version of Ranchero salsa.

I've read reviews that complain about portion to price ratio. True the portions are not traditional American Plate crowding portions.

However, the alpastor is good for people that enjoy spicy food.  While the carne Asada had less flavor and it was less spice. The burritos come with rice, beans and a good quantity of guacamole. The dish also comes with chips and fresh salsa on the side. The food was good, the only problem is that you dont always get a table as they have a very limited patio space. The menu was also a bit overwhelming and hard to read.  Overall, a very good place to eat Mexican food without breaking your bank.",wtNopFY2ybprzk4FuEbWJQ,3,4,4,7P3lcOphK_5GBfweJSa1NQ
4625871,2015-09-07,0,1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA,"Pros: These tacos are AMAZING. The flavors are very tasty but not overpowering... just right! I got the usual carne asada, el pastor, and pollo and every single one was delicious! The best deal is their combination plate of 3 tacos that comes with rice and beans so you'll definitely be full! Coupled with watermelon juice and it will quench your thirst on a hot summer day in Vegas! Just hitting this place up is worth your trip to Container Park (in which the restaurant is made up of a freight container). The staff is very friendly and had us say enchilada before taking our picture... funny guy!

Cons: Nothing off the top of my head. The price, quality, quantity, service, and atmosphere was good!

4628631,2016-09-17,0,1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA,"As far as tacos go, this place has quite the variety on offer. Lengua? You don't see that every day. Beyond this somewhat unusual variety, they've got the basic bases covered: asada, adobada, al pastor, pollo, etc. There's also a mole taco, and a nopal variety. Get adventurous with your taste buds here, because all the ingredients seem very fresh and the preparation is keen. Other than said tacos, I will say you should try the asada fries because they are ridiculous. Think Mexican poutine.

Interior space is nothing special. Pick your tacos, get a place holder, find a place to sit (outside, probably) and they'll deliver. They don't have any brand hot sauce (so no Tapatio) but their house made is good enough.

They offer Micheladas and beer, as well as Mexican sodas, so find a cool spot and enjoy them tacos while watching the container park go by.",eurIEcpGa_tTi1LMWa1pUA,1,0,4,O1qzmoWMUXTO5ge-XsaJpQ

The gringos tacos are probably the best tacos I've ever had in my life. Their guacamole is also delicious. The wait at the bar is why I didn't give them 5 stars. I understand that it was crazy, but we were given our drinks and then had to stand there waiting for the bill on more than one occasion. They need to add another register at the bar if they can't keep up with customer demand at that point. There was one particular man who helped me out more than once and I wish I had gotten his name, but he was in a white Pinches t-shirt and a blue hat.

Came in during 1:30pm with a couple people to try them out.

Around that time, they were packed! If that's how lunch rush is on a Sunday I would hate to see it on a Saturday but good for them! 

Came in and had the following:

Tacos (Asada, Al Pastor) -  tacos were not my pick because I normally get lingua, cabeza, tripas, so not my first choice but I enjoyed it. I appreciated the hand made tortillas. Fluffy and not hard. Just the right amount of salsa that they put on for you. I'm picky since I would rather control the amount myself but still good. The onions weren't over powering.

Michelada -  perfect amount of Tajin and hot sauce. Not too spicy, but not weak either. 

Elotes - nothing memorable. Just your corn, mayo, cheese, and spices. But still yummy to eat. Corn was surprisingly sweet.

Torta - this was actually done pretty good. The bread they chose and the size complimented the amount of meat they put in it. Normally you'll get a soggy bread with very little meat and way too much filler but not this one. 

All in all, I would come back again. Nothing that makes it stand out for me to go all the way to DTLV from Henderson but if I was in the area I'll definitely give them a try. I'm just very partial to Taco y Taco that's all",JtAoso0Ze87DWqnmI5qorA,0,1,4,yDeVXjfwBbGaIWwo8vZq1g

I was very happy with the entire evening and wanted to end it on an even better note with some food from one of the new joints.  We decided on Pinches Taco.  One, because the name was awesome and two, I heard the food was great!

It's in the north east corner of the Container park.  Just like all the stores in the park, it's a small joint, however, offers a lot of seating and tables right outside.  When I visited the location, it was pretty heavily staffed.  I didn't have to wait in line at all and trust me, there were a lot of people, being the grand opening weekend.  The staff was super friendly, everyone greeted me and other customers.  Service was remarkably fast!  Might have had something to do with opening weekend :) Awesome!

There was a lot going on in the menu, so I just settled on Pinche Combination plate for $8.95.  You can choose Any 3 tacos from the menu, and it also comes with rice, beans and chips.  I decided on the three most popular things:  Beef (Asada), fish and shredded pork.  Oddly enough, the pork wasn't really the star.  That taco was served with red salsa and chopped onions.  The asada was perfectly seasoned and flavorful, chopped onions, chopped cilantro and green salsa.  The fish (unknown) was THE BEST one for me.  Battered and perfectly seasoned, served with a cabbage slaw and red salsa.  The most amazing fish taco!

The real star is the thicker and mild corn taco they wrap those things in.  The food came quickly, and eating outside at the Container Park is quite cool in its own right.  Oh crap....one more thing.  Three taco plates, a margarita, a Dos Equis Draft, and a horchada for $42.  While not amazing, it is definitely not absurd either.",bXObgKT7uWVE0h5ry9G4Ng,0,0,4,Nq46P3jCI9LAePvAynaawg

The ingredients seem to be really good quality and taste fresh and don't have that ""gamey"" taste you sometimes get at traditional taco places. My favorite is the grilled chicken.  Only reason not giving 5 stars is the counter ordering always seems a little disorganized and they seem to always make you wait even when it's not crowded and though there are like 6 people behind the counter.",CjUk-UjpqT4IKVwOFCSonw,0,0,4,D0KwVBaA1GxgZUoI3Be2Pw

5083093,2016-11-24,0,1ZJz840L496LAmQdeDv0WA,"For variety, Pinches Tacos is excellent. The menu is quite extensive, boasting a number of tacos, breakfast items, combo plates, sopes, burritos, tortas, taquitos, flautas, enchiladas, soups and sides. There's also a beverage menu that includes cocktails and agua frescas.

We came by one evening, though it was close to closing time so we decided to come back another day so that we wouldn't impose ourselves on the staff who were likely ready to go home by then.

When we returned two days later, we were excited, as we'd seen all the offerings on the menu. My husband decided to order two fish tacos and one nopal taco. I opted for one fish, one nopal, and one pollo mole. Our order came quickly and looked absolutely delicious.

The reviews here about the fish tacos are not wrong; they were incredibly delicious! Topped with slaw and a slightly spicy red salsa, the taco is flavorful. (In fact, the fish tacos alone sway this from being a 1 star review!) The nopal tacos came topped with cotija cheese, but the filling was cold which I did not expect. The pollo mole taco came topped with a red salsa and cotija cheese. While pretty flavorful, there was something slightly off about the taste.

Then, within 6 hours of eating here, I experienced some of the worst food poisoning I'd had in years. The only thing my husband and I could pinpoint, that we'd eaten different from one another all day, was the pollo mole taco. I was very disappointed, as Pinches was one of the places I'd looked forward to visiting even before we arrived in Las Vegas!",KOhtdmixLM13z44D6m5Igg,2,0,2,LVir851L_sLur8uG6_vV5w

Influenced by my uncle's enthusiastic love for the Pinches' elote corn, this was the main reason my ohana and I went to Container Park! 

This was our first stop at Container Park, and as soon as my uncle parked the SUV he was running off to Pinches. 

 Quote from my uncle: ""I LOOOOOOOVE the corn, it's sooo GOOD! You have to try it. It's my favorite at the Container!"" This is all he talks about when talking about Container Park. He loves your corn! 

I've had the elote corn in a cup from the Vegas outdoor swap meet and I definitely agree, Pinches' elote is sooo good! 

They have an extensive menu and I've been following them on Instagram, and I have to say I wish I saved my appetite for this place! We had lunch right before this, and I was too full to eat anything. I managed to eat the whole cob of corn and a drink a cup of beer. Oh! and I got to sip their horchata with cinnamon, it was so good! Better than what I've had at other Mexican restaurants. 

Service was 5 star excellente. The women helping us each time we went back for beer were amazing. 

I'll definitely be back for the horchata and to try the rest of their menu!",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,6,7,4,iMDgabR5ZYehFUYkjaaCvQ

This was my life saver after having a couple of Blood & Cloves with Jameson Black Barrel. Seriously, you need some food to anchor that level of alcohol.

Pinches delivered although they will yell Gringo Tacos at the top of their lungs when you order them. I find no shame it that, I'll eat those tacos with pride. It was a low carb cheat day and I wanted some hot crispy tortillas to fill the void.

My 5 year old liked their basic quesadilla and my husband stole my chicken taquitos after he polished off the carne asada tacos that I had ordered for him.

Short version:
The cashier failed to disclose a 45 minute wait time. After waiting 20 minutes (with 20+ more to go), I went in, cancelled my order and asked for a refund. The cashier then tried to lie and steal his tip back after I paid in cash and left the change as a tip in good faith. 

Long version: 
The total was $6 and some change. I have never had an issue here, so I paid $8 in cash and told the cashier to keep the change as a tip in good faith. Little did I know, the guy failed to disclose that it was a 45+ minute wait. A group of 3 guys that were already waiting before us went in to ask how long it would be for theirs, my son and I had been waiting for 20 minutes ourselves, and the guys reported that it would be another 15 at least for theirs. 

What the heck!!! I went in and spoke to the cashier, who immediately copped an attitude and refused to acknowledge that he should have communicated to customers about the excessive wait times. I canceled my order and asked for a refund.

He complied and gave me the money for the tacos but THEN he tried to lie and tell me he gave me the change back so he could keep the tip!!! THAT is what really set me off and prompted me to write this review.

The corn on the other hand looked beautiful but when I bit into it I was instantly disappointed.

Tried repeatedly to get in touch with the local manager. Finally did after about 6 tries. He took my info and said he would correct it, but never did.

My phone was dead almost a second after I walked in, so I had to stay in place while I waited for Maria to show up. There are only a few tables, but that's okay. At first I was a bit startled because of the flame shooting praying mantis outside literally shakes the building! 

I ordered a lengua taco and a sope de pollo. Instead I got charged for two sopes and no lengua taco. They gave me two sopes and I asked when my taco was coming. When I realized the discrepancy, I told them that it was okay, but they still gave me the taco on the house, which was nice. 

Maria got a burrito and I believe she really liked it. I also gave her my second sope and she loved it.

I went for a combo plate with 3 tacos, rice, beans and chips and my BF went for the burrito with lengua. We also took a plate of chips, salsa and guacamole. 
The plate with salsa and guacamole was very good, both dips were so fresh, not overwhelmed with spices so you could actually taste the flavor of the avocados and of the salsa. The chips were great too!
I got the al pastor, carnitas and pollo mole tacos. Neither of them disappoint. The meats tasted great and well prepared. Personally I actually prefer when the tacos are coming with just one tortilla, you are full less quickly. The sides were both very good too, particularly the beans. 
Regarding, the burrito. My boyfriend said the meat was excellent and with a great taste of lengua. It is not over packed with rice. And the cilantro finish to give a fresh taste. 

Now the service... The all crew was very friendly. When we entered, we looked at the board to decide what to get and the waitress just told us to take our time and go at the cashier when we were ready, it was nice.
