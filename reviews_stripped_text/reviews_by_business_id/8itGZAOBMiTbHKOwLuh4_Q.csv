It's good if you want choices and something fairly cheap and quick, but it's not on my list of faves. They had a handful of seafood options which a lot of people like for less than $10 @ lunch. Place was pretty busy, but again the food was alright, and really nothing to brag about.",FTjIHMSeXJDRTO0QHOoTiw,0,0,3,Ju4D1XSwH7OZM2VUbyGncg

From the orange chicken, mandarin chicken and teriyaki chicken, none of these had flavor worth talking about. Although there is a large assortment of items, none of the items I put on my plate, left me wanting another bite. I write this with a hungry stomach, because it's that bad. If you're coming here, eat the tapioca pudding, it was the only thing that was good.",RdUChHv88CI29ENLVQoUkw,0,0,1,xdsDCWb37Z7You92N8qspg

I like the cream cheese rangoons and of course the orange chicken",E1mcFIOK7k_G08cki2oBuw,1,0,4,rkZ8J51ZBAFhTvOvuUEbJQ

They would not allow our family sit together because of their ""policy"". Extremely disappointed. Never coming back again.",fCOqGeiJtFk_I0JE2lcGGw,0,0,1,UmEVCQZoSXIMmHEpTsbUtQ

The place was fairly crowded but I was seated immediately and my drink order was taken.  There was a lot of food to choose from Sushi, Soup, Shrimp, vegetables, chicken wings, salads, and deserts and much more.   I had the Jalapeno Chicken, some Chicken Wings, some salad and some Honey Dew Melon that was really good.  The servers were constantly doing a good job circling the isles and refilling drinks and removing dirty dishes.  I would recommend giving this place a try for a quick in and out dinning experience at a reasonable price.",L5JFnETi16y2gNiESXBYeA,1,0,4,hUCECvF1CDaaEAPm9Tutig

Came back with my youngest sister, she wanted to try sushi and I thought this was an ok place to have her try something out before branching out into other places. Immediately as we sat down we were asked what drinks we wanted. I had the chai tea and she had pink lemonade. To our luck as we stood up to start piling onto our plates the cooks brought out a few fresh sushi trays. We didn't have much to eat but we were please either the service either way.",bh8HjEzcKKSUI20n5PKvsQ,0,0,5,AxR0g-_2oNLhaKdk6OGXQQ
