1225226,2018-06-24,0,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,"Subs aren't really my go-to meal, but when I heard they had hot subs and fries I was intrigued. It is a franchised chain which seems to be easier to find upon research than how/where the chain got started which struck me as odd. 

Onto the food... The bread was fresh, soft and even though I'm a very slow eater, the bread stayed consistently soft which was impressive. I ordered the steak, cheese and onion. It was a little dry but other than that it was on par with any other chain's generic cheesesteak. The fries were ok, not bad, which is oddly possible. My husband got the bacon cheeseburger and the chicken salad, he said both were ok and he would get it again. 

I'm in no rush to return, but I'm sure we'll eat there again",RyVpd9WTfCC4puHIL8x4CQ,1,0,3,3BrYWwJAvg1VmexFR4w0eA
1588318,2018-06-27,10,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,"I heard about this spot opening up so I came by after a workout at the nearby LVAC. The Beef Bomb sando that they're known for is a hefty sub filled with beef, grilled onions, mushrooms, peppers, and bacon with tomatoes and provolone. It's pretty tasty and I like how cheesy it was, but the beef wasn't seasoned. There also seemed to be mayonnaise on the sandwich, which I do not care for and was not mentioned in description. That said, there's enough on the menu that I'll probably come back and try another sandwich again soon enough.

Since the restaurant recently opened, management was circulating and getting feedback. No one approached me, which may have been an oversight. I would suggest adding silverware to the drink station (had to ask an employee for it from behind the counter) and adding window shades, as the dining room was quite sunny and warm. Hoping they do well in this spot!

TIP: Bring in your LVAC ID for a discount. Wish I'd been asked, considering I came in wearing workout clothes. They also have wheat bread available, but you have to ask for it.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,12,3,ffJS8m8BFIkW8Jj88f3gKw

The service is great, the lady behind the counter was patient and recommended some of the house favorites since it was my first time. The Cajun chicken is so yummy and the fries are amazing.

I had the Rueben on Cuban, my husband had the Maple Bacon (with no lettuce) and baby boy had French fries.

I had the steak bomb which had cheese, steak, mushroom, peppers, and onion. I also had my dog with me and they were so nice me about it.  The owner even came over to our table to speak to us!

I ordered through Uber eats (huge bonus for people who can't leave work). I got the 6"" glazed teriyaki cheese steak. Let me tell you. As someone who grew up in a sub shop, this placed nailed it. The steak, onion and mushrooms were actually cooked IN the teriyaki sauce.  Everything is made to order. And they have fries as well as chips for those who like something a little different.  All in all, I will definitely order from here again.",r7jxw6-4_dTJ9IB02MVgqA,0,0,5,5w4sTh5YYs9k4nn5Rzh6dQ
3345776,2018-06-27,0,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,"Heard it was open so I thought I'd give em a try. In a small strip center right off 215 and flamingo. 


Walked in and was not impressed. Place was filthy. Garbage on floors. Dirty empty tables. I actually had to clean off a table myself in order to have a seat.

 And the place is about the size of a porta potty. Not really much room to sit. Don't come during lunch unless you're getting it to go. Because you won't find a seat.


On to the ordering. Ordered a meatball sub. Placing order was easy. Staff was not very friendly or very helpful. After ordering you either hope to find a table or stand there waiting for them to call your name. Which results in people just standing by the soda fountain machine and all your other drink needs. Very inefficient and annoying to have people standing there texting and instagramming and yelping completely oblivious to their surroundings by being in the way.


Sandwich was ok. Nothing great about it. Nothing bad about thus the average rating. I'll come back after they get some of the bugs worked out.",tuiR8GCh5eX-Z8twljeueg,1,1,3,EjTDzmTtgm5KihF6Y9WKFA

3866210,2018-06-30,0,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,"Tried a grilled chicken 12"" sub to go last week. It was pretty bland. Just not much taste at all. Service took a little while but since they are new in town, that might be an anomaly. The Mrs wasn't impressed either. May not go back. With the price point it shouldn't be lackluster. Maybe I need to try at steak sandwhich. Even so, if you are making something bland just take it off the menu until you find a way to make it better. Decor is okay. They have an open kitchen similar to Caps. Finishes and lighting are pretty standard. About as uninspiring as the sandwich. Location is a little out of the way because you have to pull into a commercial development and which makes it not worth trying again. I guess if I'm jonesing for a steak sandwhich and I'm in the area, then I suppose I can give it another go. But heck, at least the food wasn't bad and that's why it gets 3 Stars.",irPJRh8LQcjahyMOKga5jw,0,0,3,YD63oXizbr9ZQFaeGvCRVA
4381483,2018-07-01,0,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,Wow!!! Super delicious subs and service!!! From ordering to the taste everything is 5 stars!!! We will be back for sure. Great location and hours. The fries are my favorite fries around town. As a Miami native I had to try the Cuban and see if it was as good as my Cubans in Miami and it was sooooo perfect!!! Authentic homemade fresh baked  Cuban bread with the perfect amount of mustard and pickles in the pork and ham grilled to perfection!  If you never tried a Cuban sandwich do yourself a favor and try this Jon Smith Cuban asap!! I also cannot wait to try the Rueben on a Cuban next!!!!

4538385,2018-06-23,0,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,"Great sandwich spot added to the neighborhood, heck completely new addition to Vegas! Jon Smith subs is located next to Starbucks off of Grand Canyon and Flamingo, the location is pretty easy to get in and out of thanks to the multiple entrances/exits from the shopping center! 

For my first excursion I shared a 12 inch Steak Bomb(grilled onions, peppers, mushrooms, tomatos, bacon, mayo, and provolone) and a large fry with my mom. I ordered our food to go, upon emptying our bag we discovered a rather large order of fries(think large McDonald's size cup)(yes, I'm a bad Yelper I should have taken a picture) filled over the brim. 
Our sandwich wasn't soggy and the bread was still soft till the last bite! I had never had bacon on a cheesesteak before, I loved it! I tried a bite of just the meat and I found it a tad under seasoned, perhaps I'll ask for extra seasoning next time? 
I'm excited to return and try the Cuban and Maple Chicken sandwich's, work my way through the menu :)",JfnY0VcP63s5RF1sfOHjBQ,2,1,4,K7wWkUCaf5t8amqXj24McQ
4582398,2018-07-01,0,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,"So, I really want to like this place. I'm not sure if it's just because they're still working on training the staff or what. 
I had the Cajun chicken sandwich. The chicken itself tasted like nothing remotely Cajun I've ever eaten. It was honestly tasted bland except for the enormous amount of liquid smoke flavoring. I agree with the other review, the cheese was on point but the lack of seasoning just made me sad. 
The girlfriend ordered the chicken bomb and had a similar experience. She said it just tastes bland, oh and also she requested an addition to the sandwich that wasn't put on.  I've no doubt that we could've gotten something worked out if we'd eaten there instead of getting it to go.
The ingredients were all fresh, the staff was very polite and accommodating. I will be going back to try something else on the menu though.",waj3HxGNLf84mEUliF_WOA,0,0,3,pnTyEbJwhIFhyfEdEwaNxg

That staff there is so friendly and nice. If you don't know what to get they will help you find the best choice.

Super friendly staff who even handed out complementary cookies! Quite attentive even while just sitting without ordering and waiting for the rest of my party to join me. They definitely need to invest in some tinted windows or some shades to cover up the sun during sunset though or get ready to be blinded when it's crowded and you can't sit by the tables on the sides. Fries are hot and good! Mushroom steak sub was alright, tastes like a mushroom sub.",ooTnyvza14szGKWm3zKbAA,1,0,4,ybBYPDklJMXeL6rE4Rif4A
5350690,2018-06-16,0,-wvWO7UlQNK2IprIukH9uQ,"Super friendly and attentive staff. Apparently it was a friends and family event, but they were super nice to honor their free sub offer to us. I was asked if I wanted to make it a combo and that was comped too. They didn't have a tip jar, instead they asked for us to come back next week during their grand opening.  I ordered the Italian steak, I should have paid more attention to the menu, totally missed the marinara part.  It was a little too saucy to me and I couldn't really taste all the flavors of the ingredients which was a little disappointing. They could probably go a little heavier on the salt for the perfect sub since my boyfriend ordered the steak bomb and also agreed a bit more salt would have been ok.  Good thing is that they have condiments for you to tweak your sub!  Their fries are actually pretty darn good... YUM! Perfect golden color and a  great crunch to them.  Did I forget to mention their subs are served piping hot and fresh soft bread!!
