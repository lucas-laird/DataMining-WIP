The waiter kept my coffee cup filled without me having to ask. The prices very reasonable. We came back for a late lunch. Once again the food and service  were excellent. Food portions are generous and appealing. The waiter kept my water glass filled and removed dishes as soon as we were done. In both ocasiones the bill arrived promptly.

It took forever to put in a drink order and then once we got it, the drinks weren't even right.  We ordered 3 mimosas and one bloody mary and she brought 2 bloody marys and 2 mimosas, except the mimosas were just champagne.  

Once we ordered our food, it took forever to get the food!!!  Then when she did bring it, she gave some of our things to another table and then we had to wait for her to bring out new stuff!!

Its a little annoying though how they stopped serving primerib and stopped putting out crab legs and they were going to put out only flank steak. a little disappointing. I dod like the all you can eat made to order pasta bar. You could make your  own yummy pasta. The dessets were lacking big time though don't go for the desserts.

I honestly don't know how places in Vegas can survive when not backed by a big name chef. They must pay a fortune in rent for the size of this space; doubt they are making money. 

We had 30 minutes for breakfast before our conference which is why we ducked in. Server told us not to order the shrimp and grits breakfast. Just silently shook her head ""no"" and then said ""I like for people to order things I won't have to take back."" Believe me, we appreciated that from the server. But yeah. Kitchen nightmares. 

I had the huevos rancheros and it was good. Just not Vegas good. You expect so much more from the food scene in this town. This dish was basic. My buddy had the smores pancakes and did not complain.

The service was good. A front desk hostess calls to the back to keep your table then you walk down a long beautiful hallway which is maybe 100 feet. The waitress was attentive and quick to fill your water and coffee. 4 stars for service. 

Aesthetically this is a beautiful restaurant. It's a mix of rustic wooden architecture, lots of natural lighting with pretty views, and 70s music in the background that isn't too loud so you can still hear your table concertos. 4 stars for the looks. 

The food was simply not good. It tastes like you were eating at an Applebee style restaurant where nothing is fresh, everything was frozen, and now it's been under a heat lamp. Our coconut shrimp had no flavor and was served at room temperature. The Cuban sandwich was also devoid of flavor and the meats has a rubbery taste. Everything was also overpriced. The coffee was surprisingly excellent, but they charged 5.50 for a cup of coffee so it better be excellent! Food and value 2 stars.

Seabreeze Café is located right in Mandalay Bay, not far from the hotel lobby and near the casino area. My boyfriend and I were fortunate to be seated right away and it seemed that the breakfast crowd was trickling out.
They serve breakfast and lunch until their closing time, which I believe is around 2 and the menu is pretty diverse from that perspective. Most people can find something appealing, whether it's a full meal or a lighter bite, such as a fruit cup, oatmeal or salad.
Service was very friendly and efficient-drinks came right away as well as our food. They have a great ""build your own omelet"" option and a ""skinny"" alternative made with egg whites with a fruit cup on the side instead of hash browns. I ordered that with spinach, tomato and cheddar. They definitely didn't skimp on the veggies which was welcome and the fruit cup had some nice fresh berries & melon. Was it an enjoyable meal? Sure, yes. Was it worth $17? Definitely not...but hey that's Vegas. It was average, not great and pricey to boot.

It sat on two buttermilk biscuits which were OK, not stellar. The saving grace of this dish was the gravy. While not the best gravy I had, it added a much needed flavor and texture. Also, how can you not love break egg yokes - like on anything, right?

The Cheeseburger was good, but not special. It instantly fell apart after my first bite, which is a super downgrade for burgers in my opinion. Luckily the burger was cooked to a perfect medium rare and the pulled pork complimented that flavor. The fries, however, were very very lackluster.

The family and I had to come here after we saw the S'mores pancakes on the menu last night when we walked by. 

Little O had the S'mores Pancakes all by herself, with H and I picking off some bites every now and then. When they brought it out we said there was no way she'd be able to finish it. But with a little help from us, it was demolished. 

H had the Belgian Waffles which were three mini waffles with some fruit on top. The outside was crisp as waffles should be. Then you expect it to be crunchy all the way through, but the inside was moist and had a sweet cake-like texture. Very yummy!

Hubby and I shared the American Breakfast--2 eggs, hash browns, bacon, toast and we added a short stack of pancakes. They were nice enough to equally split the entire order into two plates, not counting the pancakes. Everything was cooked well--eggs were not runny or rubbery, bacon was crisp and they were Texas toast slices of bread.

Service was awful. When you sit down for breakfast on a Saturday morning - in Las Vegas - the least you expect is water and coffee service - with some urgency. It's breakfast!

After waiting for 17 minutes - with a totally barren table -I finally got up and expressed my concerns to a server assistant who brought the table coffee and water. Keep in mind this was a full 17 minutes after we sat down.

The waiter - Thomas - finally made it to our table - seemed rude - no apology for the service time - no special attentiveness for the delay - nothing - more like a toll taker than a waiter. In fact we saw him three times in a 45 minute meal - no drink refills - no- 'how's your food' - no 'can I get you anything else' - no interaction at all.

The restaurant was not all that busy but he made no attempt at hospitality at all.

If he had asked I would have commented on the meal as my food was not very good - but would have been passable if not for the lack of attentiveness - a meal is an experience - especially when traveling!

Feeling annoyed I again left the table and sought out the assistant manager. As I explained our experience he simply shook his head - literally did not say a word - just shook his head - no 'I'm sorry for your experience'- nothing. His demeanor and attitude did nothing more than add to the frustration.

On the way out of the restaurant I asked the hostess who the manager of the cafe was - she didn't know and could only provide me with the statement 'Ralph - I think'

Finally when we walked in to get seated the entire place barely had anyone in it and there was like six staff members. It seemed very understaffed. Our waitress came over and got our orders. The couple that was waiting in the beginning walked out of the restaurant and said ""we can't wait any longer"" because once inside no one served them. Once the meals came one of the four had to get sent back because it was incorrect and overall the breakfast was fair at best. When the check came out waitress disappeared and we had to ask two people to get her. Once she came we asked to speak with the manager. He didn't seem to care at all about the complaint we made which adds up to why this place looked like a ghost town.The food is heavily overpriced and the experience was awful.

I went back for breakfast the next day and had the lobster omelet. PLEASE take a look at the picture I post with it.

5320649,2016-05-21,16,8b5ll2kjXfjgFIqWsjkr8Q,"5/8/16:  What a pleasant surprise!  To be honest, I really was not expecting much.  Typically the mid-end hotel-owned eateries rarely are as good as anything within driving distance of similar price.  I think the only exceptions to this tend to be the ultra-high end restaurants at some hotels, of which some really are world-class.

But here was this huge hallway and space underneath the Seabreeze Cafe sign.  I mean, just one big room of nothing except for a podium and a cute host.  Somewhat intimidating, but we just got up and were in a rush to get to the Encore Beach Club for one of Avicii's last concerts of his career (!!! yeah wtf... at the height of his fame!) so we said hey, why not...

As we walked past that grand hallway, we entered the dining room, and wow............ it's REALLY nice.  TONS and TONS of space.  In fact, I think this restaurant might have the most space per table of any I have ever been to.  Basically each table gets its own corner of a semi-walled space.  All the walls were gorgeously carved, as well as the Roman-styled columns.  Lots of plants and decorations too.  Just felt so luxurious.

And the food was quite nice too!...

1. Fresh Orange Juice $5:  Tasted kinda 1/2 store-bought 1/2 fresh.

2. Coffee $5:  Not bad coffee.  Medium bodied and smooth.  Yeah, it's Five Bucks.  Oh well.

3. Country-Fried Steak $17 ""smothered in homemade country gravy with buttermilk biscuit and two eggs any style"":  So.... again, I wasn't expecting much in the way of food, but hey, it's pretty good!  I mean, I think it could have been crunchier, and the meat somewhat thicker, but the flavor was really great.  And the gravy was good too!--I have had so many bland country gravies lately that it was so refreshing to actually have some gravy with good flavor!  And the biscuits were really nice too--great fluffy and airy texture.  It was kinda cool they placed the biscuits half under the meat,... it helped to keep it all separated should you want to eat it that way.  Anyway, I think this country-fried steak was above average.  7/10

4. Breakfast Croissant $15 ""cheddar cheese, scrambled eggs and bacon on homemade croissant served with hash browns"":  My gf, the baker, said she thought that this probably wasn't ""homemade"" as claimed, but anyway, it tasted fine.  I couldn't remember how the hash browns tasted, but I think it all was decent.  Pretty expensive for what you get though.  If it were just by taste, I'd say 5-6 / 10, but given the price... 4/10

Well..... so I think the low 2.5 star rating reflects the relatively high price for such food.  But well, my country-fried steak was actually pretty good.  And the decor was really epic.  I mean, it's impressive.  Very impressive looking.  So, overall, we really liked eating here.

I wouldn't make a trip here just to try this place, but if you're feeling lazy and are already staying at Mandalay Bay, don't hesitate to come here!
