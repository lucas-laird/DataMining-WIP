Located in the same complex as Goong and Dairy Queen, it is definitely not the best place in terms of parking. On a Saturday evening, parking was a nightmare where some had to park by Soyo or even farther. 

Currently running a grand opening special for 50% rooms, it made the experience quite cheap for 3 hours. For the small sized room, and 7 people, it was less than $50, not including drinks, etc. 

Unfortunately, the AC wasn't running all the time and it got really humid and warm. They had turned it on for a bit but it turns off after a while. I've always had the theory of rather liking it cold and being able to put clothes on, than having it hot and suffering even when you're butt naked.

The system they use is quite similar to Q karaokes if not the same. Unfortunately their song books are majority Korean music, next is probably Japanese, then with a small amount of English and almost a non-exist amount of Chinese/Vietnamese. I mean, at least increase the English side right considering the national language ..... Lol yeah korean owned but still.... Lol",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,3,r452G1yNbHd9W89cqHudGQ

Best part is that the place is legit. Rooms are great, they have promos on their drinks, attentive service, and there are rarely any wait times. They do take reservations.

We went there for an after office chill session. Customer service was great, they gave us water after. Plus, the parking is wide. 

So in a nutshell, Ganzy is everything you want in a Karaoke place minus the hustle and bustle of Chinatown. 5/5 will only go here.",NWJYydOUPmL5it7Dmz43qg,3,3,5,9wdYFLnIAu_sl_C433fZfQ
1488560,2018-05-11,0,LdSQaxwngeZ0zu6zY44aEA,"I thought it was just ok.

Pros- close for people who live in the Southwest.... sound system is pretty good... song selection is pretty extensive.

Cons - rooms are fairly small, even for a large room, and on the expensive side for room and alcohol. 

I will probably return, but if time wasn't an issue and/or there isn't a crowd elsewhere I might be inclined to try a different place first.",COO0J8CcfhU3SWPxqOBnPA,0,0,3,hMpzfttyYixeGULUQiSCCQ
2960449,2018-04-30,2,LdSQaxwngeZ0zu6zY44aEA,"Finally, a karaoke bar that's not on Spring Mtn. Since I came here after class on a Tuesday night, it seemed pretty slow. I believe there are 3-4 rooms. 

The bartender, who worked that night, was pretty awesome. I appreciate her honesty when it comes  to food. haha. Their food menu has mostly korean items. Plenty of yogurt soju option, also. 

Their songbook has mostly korean songs.. and a page of Chinese songs. But it's alright - they have the most popular ones and they have pinyin along with the characters for people like me, who isn't super fluent in reading Chinese. 

I'd definitely come back.",p6ACvaHf7M8GTPPHO24gPQ,3,3,4,InozYItXncFLuYbuMoOAWg
3596263,2018-05-19,0,LdSQaxwngeZ0zu6zY44aEA,"Finally, a karaoke place is not anywhere near Chinatown or in the Spring Mountain area.

Rooms are nice and cozy. Prices are a bit high (for rooms, drinks, and food), even during happy hour. Songs are updated and a lot of selections of popular korean and japanese music. Popular american songs, but I can tell it is more geared towards updating more popular koreans songs.

My go-to karaoke place from now on.",UkSw0peY2kcggoPomHeVUg,4,1,4,gRkPjQ9rCLknoHlqteiFDw

Been here twice now and the service and experience is just as memorable as the first!",JFDRQlorZoX7PwXorTrBfQ,1,1,5,MqruoBxs2mNkEocJ2WcFAw
3651091,2018-06-24,0,LdSQaxwngeZ0zu6zY44aEA,"Called to make a reservation but was told they don't take any and it was on a first come first serve basis? Based on reviews everyone posted about making reservations. Did they change that? 

Walked in the worker gave us a room in which the main tv did not work. Making it to where if you wanted to sing to the lyrics you'd have to stand and turn around or tilt your head backworks.... until she realized she ""just cleaned"" another small room or the guy ""cancelled."" Throughout the night we seen her once. Don't know how the service works here but we basically had to go order drinks at the front to get service because nobody checks in on you. 

Now to the karaoke itself, the sound systems are amazing and the disco lights make it even better. They have an updated list of songs which is a plus as well. I especially love the dark hallways and how they play music outside as well.",_k_9F6owvCWuM3gX5k4l-Q,0,0,3,p1ikp_OwpB93y6F2cIrZFA
3661173,2018-04-30,0,LdSQaxwngeZ0zu6zY44aEA,"Stumbled into Ganzy last Thursday night for GNO. We started off w/ a group of 4 and ended w/ a group of 8. Apparently it was ""happy hour"" (Sun-Thurs 5-8pm) when we arrived so there was a deal going on for the rooms, $15/hr for a small room which eventually led up to $35/hr for a large room after 8pm (and once the others arrived). 

There were also grand opening drink specials! $4 jameson shots, $5 patron shots, buy 2 get 1 free soju shots. Nice comfy booth seating, so not a whole lot of room to move around. They provided light up tambourines which were easily a hit. Easy to navigate karaoke system as long as you remember to point it at the remote. Also much easier to search by song than code. Very friendly and accommodating staff. Love the doorbell to ring for service if needed. 

Will be returning! They do have food options which is good to know.",iOok30z2H8XVnaMeCjgqCQ,1,1,4,ilEMPgi-MyFdnvk4YGWosg

4507563,2018-04-09,1,LdSQaxwngeZ0zu6zY44aEA,"This is my new favorite karaoke place!!! I always go to QKaraoke but now there's one right where I live.  They do have a grand opening deal which I loved.  We reserved the VIP room for 945 pm and It was only $35/hour (special).  They have a huge boom of songs and ask for their international book too!! 

The ambiance is really modern.  Once you walk in, loud music bumping and the bar is right at the entrance.  Staff here are really nice btw!  Drinks prices are not bad, they did have $5 shots I think?? We did receive a buy 2 get one free deal.  We got the soju cocktails.  My friends and I always get yogurt soju and we also tried the mango.  They were great.  I also think that they sell food but we did not order any.  

In the vip room, It was a typical setup of the long benches with long tables.  One thing I was sad about was the mic stand :( I wish there was one like QKaraoke.  Hopefully they get one ;) other than that, the equipment is very easy to work!! It unfortunately does get very hot in there so I suggest wearing lightweight clothing.  We only spent $150 for about 3 hours and 3 cocktails.  They also gave us water at the end.",SyX94Qkpowm_9dsn1SDrCQ,6,3,5,Z9CuyqNufCS3bkuYA8_yxw

HANDS DOWN BEST KARAOKE PLACE EVER.Great customer service and the place is cleaner than most karaoke places in town! I usually go to Q Karaoke and this place beats it! For one, it's away from the hustle and bustle of china town. Location is great, and parking is easy.
