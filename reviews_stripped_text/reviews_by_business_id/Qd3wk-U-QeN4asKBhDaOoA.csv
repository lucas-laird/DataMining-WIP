The hot dogs are nice and juicy and the chili is good too. You simply just cannot go wrong when you eat here. I am always looking forward to going to Vegas just to eat my Weinerschnitzel before I go back home. They don't only have hot dogs, but they have burgers and other things too. I think that their food is great and wish they had one here in Hawai.",MfZZsZAQ3jHovIVbRc8nvA,2,0,4,z3QTwvFdke8F_y3x6JtiTA

Parking can be tight around lunch time & requires a little bit of prowling the lot.

Prices are reasonable, service is quick & there are some interesting drinks available. What's not to iike?!

Definitely gonna keep an eye out for one of these on future trips when I'm looking for a quick bite to eat.",MkXRRhI2JmbWuoXUSK5w8A,0,0,4,zX58lJaU9bCI0SCoBiHS-A

Watch out though they do charge an extra $.50 cents per hot dog to add cheese.  This was a great little snack after a long tough day of outlet shopping.  Oh and their fries are right up there with McDonalds, Yum!",WlWgl1aWl-8wGZYUncV-2A,1,0,4,0DNfyPjZCzd13qzJ8pdLug
