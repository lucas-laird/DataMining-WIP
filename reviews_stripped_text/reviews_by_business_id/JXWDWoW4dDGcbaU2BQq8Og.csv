913411,2013-03-07,0,JXWDWoW4dDGcbaU2BQq8Og,"One of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. I find myself dreaming of their cervesas preparadas throughout the day and week. Long day at work, cervesa preparada. Short day at work, cervesa preparada. Definitely the tastiest I've had in Vegas. I used to end up here every week. 
I usually order a chicken enchilada or a chile relleno, but that's because I head over after work for a little beer action. Haven't eaten here for a full on dinner yet. Either way, the food is delicious, and I'd like to try more seafood.",jxiWra-M9WnXf92xzWlfZw,0,0,5,Fo4pwd9JiEojV5079wutKQ
1617415,2015-04-18,4,JXWDWoW4dDGcbaU2BQq8Og,"It was a trek out to this side of town for me, but there are definitely some awesome hole-in-the-wall Mexican places in this neighborhood. La Playita is no exception, though I will note that they seem to specialize in seafood options.

CHIPS & SALSA: Thick and salty chips, fresh and mild red salsa, it's good but don't fill up on this.
EMPANADAS ($8): start with an appetizer of these, cooked perfectly with a flakey exterior and a good portion of filling. Order of 4 is available with chorizo and cheese or shrimp.
SHRIMP TACO ($3): available fried or ""not fried"", which comes in a warm tomato sauce almost like a seafood stew. Small in size but packed with flavor.
TOSTADA DE DEVICHE MIXTO ($5): generous portion of fresh ceviche, heavy on the octopus, topped with avocado. Simple and bright, not too acidic.

Interior is clean, small, and homey, decorated with a nautical motif. Service was friendly and fluently bilingual. Glad that this place is NOT a cash-only establishment!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,4,4,xA9p7XAOQVAIN1URyYvUgA

You can't go wrong with ordering anything from the menu. I especially love the 7 mares, chilaquiles, and the Miguelito's special. My family and I love this place. We've been coming here for years.",8lxHzpvgSBUwLa4vcCOg3w,0,0,5,F4gmxg-UqrgBqetpfJiXJg
2039866,2015-07-25,0,JXWDWoW4dDGcbaU2BQq8Og,"Second time here last night and they didn't disappoint. Very colorful local place and there always seems to be something interesting happening here. Last time it was an impromptu Mexican duo singing and playing guitar. Last night it was a beautiful pair of horses outside that a couple rode in on. As for the food, I'm a fan of the bistec chipotle although you must be careful as it's one of the hotter Mexican dishes I've ever had. The shrimp and octupus cocktail comes highly recommended as well. Good prices, neighborhood atmosphere and pleasant service make this definitely above the average place in town.",LyV-6nAIilntnUUk5T1B_Q,0,0,4,H_d2Jega-3r12xYWqTryrg

I also really enjoyed the chips and salsa that they give everyone . I will surely be coming back again",004X_tpoHxjutaS1Q65KcA,0,0,5,AcTS84xobuu-Z3vywsv1MA
2329149,2014-05-05,0,JXWDWoW4dDGcbaU2BQq8Og,"I personally loved the food here. I had a carne asada burrito and it was seasoned perfectly. The flavors with all the ingredients it came with was very good. I think the rice was also seasoned well and the beans were nice. I'd say that the food gets a perfect 5 stars. However I am rating this 4 stars due to the small size of the restaurant. It was incredibly hard to get around in that place, especially when its busy. The location seems a bit dumpy as well. I remember passing by it all the time thinking eww, but after reading reviews and seeing this restaurant on Best Of Las Vegas's website, I had to give it a chance. The other factor that brings this down to 4 stars is the fact that they don't serve fountain drinks. They only serve bottle/can beverages, so don't expect free refills. Overall, a solid 4 out of 5 and worth the price as well.",_qtrTMFbg05Q5nJnNnVKeA,0,0,4,xEXAOz4vs_dKJGV90FfwhQ

Started with some chips and salsa--and I must say that's some good homemade salsa and chips.  I had the vuelva a la vida (shrimp, octopus, oyster seafood cocktail).  I love to throw some Chalula and squeeze two lemons in it. So damn good, cold and refreshing in the summer time.  Also had their michelada (bloody beer)--a definite must!  They have the bottles sugarcane Coca Colas.  Also tried their butterfly fried fish--which tasted amazing.  Tasted like pancakes with grilled onions and side of salad, rice, and tortillas.

So we decided to try for a dinner.  Served a nice spicy chunky salsa and cold chips upon sitting down.  We ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp, the empanadas and 2 chili relleno plate.
Food arrived very quickly and was pretty down hill from there.  Empanadas were not hot all the way thru.  The relleno plate use anaheim chilis and were not very good.  Bacon wrapped shrimp was wrapped with to much bacon and the layer of bacon under the first wrap was raw.  I returned that plate of shrimp and told them I did not want anything in its place.
I do not think we will be trying this place again.",hLdd68fn1VP1s7BAZElNhQ,0,0,2,O6wYJ7LtJTKxKeT9XWEkaA
