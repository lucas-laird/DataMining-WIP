I had not eaten a real meal(instead consuming fast food, chips, and alcohol) in three days and my first bite of the BBQ beef combination was amazing! I really liked the macaroni salad and the dressing for the salad. Definitely better than all the fast food around and way cheaper( and tastier) than anything on the strip",2J1HhwWULZASkyx1wUCAJA,0,0,4,pRQtILi3LLbCMDbaHXTkHA

I recommend the sushi rolls (I haven't had the raw fish...but the tempura and California rolls, and shrimp crunch roll have always been great), Teriyaki chicken and beef, pasta salad, and of course their house salad dressing.

This is a casual/fast food restaurant...I guess its mainly for take-out/delivery! The restaurant itself is pretty small... There's like 6-7 tables total. I had a salad with strawberry guava juice today. CHICKEN MANGO AVOCADO SALAD WITH CHICKEN IS MY FAV!!! The order comes with salad and miso soup. I love the salad dressing and the chicken tastes like teriyaki/BBQ. It adds protein to the salad and the mango is so sweet =) Orders are ready in like 5 min and the cashier is very friendly. He interacts with customers and he always makes my order without mistakes! I have had kalbee/chicken katsu/unagi don/rainbow rolls here. They are all very delicious. I work on the Strip and I usually place my order when I leave work. I will pick up my food on my way home. Portions are large and I usually have leftover for lunch! 

Not a fancy stylish place to eat and traffic on Sahara is sometimes irritating! However, the food is what matters and for the price you paid, can't beat!!",Pvehs_IlQWkT1pDG8od_Uw,1,1,5,Untf1-A8xC45MOI9EDyCAQ

The food I suppose was okay.  To be honest I have had so much better, but we didn't try any of the sushi rolls, so perhaps we were just ordering the wrong things off the menu.  The meats BBQ chicken and beef had good flavor, but to us were overly salty.  I thought the noodles were very bland...we actually threw the whole container away.  The soup was okay, if you like that sort of thing.  
I personally won't be eating here again, but I have had much worse.  It just wasn't what we were hoping for and for the price of delivery, we could honestly find better places to order from.",UsUNFqizxM1ZIp7zh1xHag,0,0,3,UBUI-XyTCJ9IJ5GlmcTNzQ

Also, came with a small scoop of rice, macaroni salad and two pieces of a california roll. Flavor was good and from the employees and patrons it seemed authentic.

Pros:
- Chicken Teriyaki bowl ($7.95) was fairly priced. Comes with rice and the glaze was perfect.
- Seaweed Salad was plenty for $5. Fresh and definitely worth it!

Cons:
- Ahi poke ($8.95) - I'd look elsewhere, half of the plate was diced tomato and avocado. Even the picture on their huge menu showed ahi poke with a side of tomato and avocado. The sauce was good but was clearly missing sesame oil (which traditional ahi poke has). For the $9 you pay here you'd get more than half a pound of poke at Poke Express.

Maui Rose is at a great location because it adds to the food diversity and is a nice change to those other food options within a 3 block radius. 

Maui Rose offers the typical Hawaiian dishes, sushi and udon soups. Quality of everything isn't anything worth raving about but the prices and the portions are and prices are. They offer reasonable prices for good quantities of food. You would probably be satisfied with their selection and if you have a case of the Hawaiian munchies and you're within the area, then Maui Rose is a great place to satisfy your cravings. 

The place is pretty dinky and during a lunch hour rush, you might feel a bit claustrophobic. However, you shouldn't feel too uncomfortable waiting for your food in a somewhat confined space as the wait will go by quickly.

I would imagine that a lunch rush would fill this establishment up quickly.  However, I noticed a majority of orders where being called in and consumed elsewhere.

I checked out the menu on the wall and settled on the Maui Rose House Chicken.  It came with Miso soup and a salad.  In addition to the meal I ordered up a Spam Musubi.  There was no soda fountain so I settled on a can of Coke.

While waiting the soup and salad came out prior to the meal.  When the meal arrived accompanied with rice and mac salad, I found the house chicken to be vey General Tao'ish.

BENTO BOXES: Good for lunch or dinner, but more fun to dine in for the presentation. Kalbi option available if you're not a teriyaki fan.
UDON: Available with shrimp tempura or plain, with various combos. Wish the broth was a bit more flavorful but the noodles are perfectly chewy, like springs for your teeth.
COMBO SPECIALS: AKA enough food for two people under $10 if you get the large. Kalbi + chicken katsu is my go-to, served with a feast of sides (rice, mac salad, 4 pieces crunch roll, soup, and salad). If you're broke til payday, this meal will last days AND be relatively healthy.
SUSHI: ~20 basic and special rolls, several with similar combinations of ingredients (like the Jessica and the Cactus). Tightly rolled with fresh fish and not too much rice. All rolls under $10, wish there were more unagi options.

They also have a bunch of apps and sides (spam musubi!), plus fried rice and tempura. Service is friendly and fast, location is more of a grab-and-go joint, as there are only four tables and they're pretty cramped. Small cooler of Hawaiian sodas and other beverages at coutner.

There are about 6 tables and not too much room to maneuver. Plus there are no place settings so it gives off a ""we don't want you to eat here"" vibe.

I only waited about 10 minutes and everything was done. The gyoza were not fresh. They were lukewarm and didn't even come with any dipping sauce. The dipping sauce is one of my favorite parts of gyoza! Total bummer. The bulgogi was okay, but not prepared how I am used to. This bulgogi had broccoli, mushrooms, bell peppers and was sitting on top of clear noodles. The flavor was okay, but I really wasn't expecting the noodles or addition of veggies. The bulgogi plate came with a scoop of white rice, a scoop of mac salad, a side salad and a cup of miso soup. The mac salad had too much mayo and was bland. I usually love mac salad so this was a bummer. The salad was just a plain salad with iceberg lettuce, but it had a very good house dressing on the side. The miso soup was just that, and the musubi was regular musubi, not bad not wonderful.

Anyways, we walked in and was immediately greeted, they were patient and let us look at the menu for a bit. My sister went with the Gyoza Chicken Bowl, and I with the Kalua Pork and Cabbage. I also order poke tuna on the side which, trust me I know my ahi and that was superb! The sauce was amazing, and the avocados mixed with the poke in the sauce on a bed of lettuce was just beyond words fresh and awesome! 

The food was served moments later in a big dish for the gyoza chicken bowl and the my kalua pig was on a bed of cabbage with 2 scoops rice and mac salad. We normally eat at L&L or Aloha Kitchen which honestly is just sub par, doesn't really add much flavor or any thing to that matter or its just greasy which I hate.

My boyfriend and I really liked the lobster roll. I also like their mango and avocado salad- I had it with the chicken and didn't feel like it added enough to be worth the addition. The combination of mango and avocado is delicious enough in and of itself- especially with the fresh, sweet mango used here! I'll be back to try their bento special, musubi and probably the gyoza combo. It's a nice, quick option in the area for something hot and fresh that's not casino-priced.

I ordered for my guests and myself since it is a relatively small place. (No official area for ordering just stand alongside tables forming a line) It was a question of what # I ordered. When the food was brought to the table. I immediately let the waiter know that we did not order the particular roll he served us - it remained untouched. However, we did order the Crunchy Shrimp roll. He quickly walked away, Idk I thought maybe to bring the correct order out? No, he came back to the table with the carbon copy/order tape telling me that I was wrong and that the mistake was mine - scolding me. RUDE! I would have gladly paid for ""his mistake"" but was never given the option to have the correct roll made and served. 

Making the best of things, we continued to eat but it became increasingly hot. Not being a princess, unbearably hot. I attribute this to it being such a small space and a rather majority window store front. You have to go outside to change your mind small. The 3 men that were at the counter continued to hold a conversation that was ""laugh-out-loud"" funny (literally) almost as if we were the ""joke"". Enough was enough and we ended up leaving.

As long as these guys have been here im surprised there are only 31 reviews for this place. Hopefully another positive review will get these guys some more attention. They are kind of tucked away behind McDonalds next to David's Bridal in nice sized plaza.

As you walk in you will notice the place is bit small. What you will also notice is the giant menu that is on the wall complete with pictures and all items are individually numbered. So ordering is very simple. The only hard part is deciding what to get because you have a lot of choices.

The times that I have been here I have ordered the Chicken and Beef Combo which comes with Miso Soup, Tempura, Salad, and California Rolls. Other times I have ordered nothing but appetizers like their Spicy Tuna Roll and Soft Shell Crab. 

From this point I am firmly convinced that it doesn't matter what you order here. My assumption is that it will be awesome! Heck my wife was curious about their Udon and tried it. She loved it! 

Prices are very good for the amount of portions you get. Usually, me and my wife share a combo meal and add a side of something. That fills us up guaranteed!

Service  is awesome! It is run by nice family and every time we come here, they are very friendly!

I wonder if those Chocolate chip cookies that Simpson hidden away, which got him a extra month in Prison was worth it?   Perhaps OJ Simpson should have made a right turn on Sahara, and ate at Maui Rose before doing his  infamous ""commando"" raid across the street from the Palace Station casino.    

For a few years, I heard about Maui Rose from a bunch of Hawaiian customers, and I have to say, it was more than less that liked this place, from what I heard.   Sadly I always avoided this area, because I hated the traffic on Sahara,    On this day of my visit to Maui Rose, I was in the Chinatown and forgot to put in a sports bet before the first pitch of an early Dodger game.    This was the third week of the Dodgers historic winning streak, and I didn't want to drive from Henderson to the TI sportsbook in case I won my ticket,   So I took the I-15 north, and went to Palace station.

Maui Rose doesn't have the biggest dining area, and it was kind of packed during this time of the day, so I ended up taking it out.   Service was good, and I had no problem getting my order in (meaning no language problem)    It took about ten minutes to get my order, and I was out of there with my plate.

I really enjoyed the dressing for the side salad, and this entire meal was only 9.50.  Yeah, it was worth the money.    

I have to give Maui Rose more of a 3.50 to 3.75 star, and rounding it up to four.   I hate their location, but if i'm in the area and have to put in a bet.  I'm going to do a  commando raid at Maui Rose, and pound some food.",ePWsbOWDTJcgIus-BFuKpg,6,3,4,ekOS9lyews53aCTkRb1IMg

Highly recommend the Maui noodles. 

Great place for lunch but gets crowded quick. 

Above average Hawaiian BBQ with a great sushi menu as well. 

3 stars due to:

Poor food packaging: Everything goes in Styrofoam and it affects the taste of the food if it sits longer than 20minutes. Not to mention the health and environmental factors. 

Inconsistent Customer Service: Changes or fixes to orders are usually handled without much emphasis on making the customer feel satisfied. 

I recently called in an order. When I showed up at the communicated time for pick up, the ticket had never been sent to the back to be prepared. After being told I had to wait another 20 minutes for my food due to this mistake, I cancelled the order. Instead of getting an apology for not having my lunch prepared when initially communicated I was told: ""Ok, you can cancel your order, that's fine. Good bye"".

I intentionally go out of my way to support local businesses instead of going to one of the many chain restaurants in the area. It's going to be hard to keep coming here knowing that they don't take their loyal customers seriously.",5gFH2wioctSPa9uj4HUcQA,0,2,3,XXl-DPWwf5m4VfwO16nu8A

They only sell canned drinks (Dr Pepper, coke, and Hawaiian sun) and bottled water for drinks. I got the Hawaiian Sun, strawberry guava flavor.

I have to say the quantity on both plates was a excellent portion size. Plus, you got with your main course a green salad with a delicious dressing and miso soup. My husband really like the Kalbi short ribs and mac salad.

4014974,2010-08-16,1,yGqvmPtlFZMPhLBlNQyggg,"Eh, for one Hawaiian BBQ place owned by Chinese people (that are obviously not from Hawaii) this place is not too bad!

I've visited this establishment a few times but I used to go to the one on Charleston.  That one closed down a while back.  The latest incarnation is on Sahara right behind McDonald's (some friendly competition).  Maui Rose serves your standard fast food Hawaii regional fare, similar in menus you find in L&L and Aloha Kitchen.  The menu consists of favorites like chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, kalbi short ribs, bbq pork, and teriyaki salmon.  They also have some Japanese fare like gyoza, udon, sushi, and tempura on their menu. 

I myself like Maui Rose much better than any L&L here in Las Vegas.  The menu is larger and much more varied so you get lots of choices.  One of my favorites is the Combo Special with kalbi short ribs, chicken katsu, and California Crunch Roll ($9.50).  Each combo comes with rice, mixed green salad w/house dressing, macaroni salad, and miso soup.  Pretty good amount of food for your money's worth!  Another one of the menu items I like is the Udon Combo, mine is the shrimp tempura udon with 4 pcs. vegetable tempura ($8.50).  Add a side order of their home made kim chee ($1.00) into your udon, so spicy yummy!  Great on a cold winter day.  

Now the food here isn't life changing or mind numbing, but for decent quality fast food it hits the spot.  Sometimes I just don't feel like a burger or sandwich for lunch, I want calrose rice!  This place serves that niche just nicely.  Last time I was there they were running a special on spam musubi, 99 cents each!  I bought two to share, but ended up sharing none.  Their musubi is very good!  Must be the teriyaki glaze on the spam.  

Their most popular time is lunch, and they do mostly takeout.  There is a LITTLE place in the restaurant for patrons wanting to eat in but be warned, there's not much room!  Like maybe 5-6 tables at the most.  They also do catering for parties!

Come here for a quick and tasty meal that won't set you back too much.  Just don't come here for the ambiance!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,3,1,3,Fv8n7R9vWETDYz6kLEOluA

I over ate and lost interest for a spell.  I ordered a chicken stick and katsu plate.  It came with a side salad, macaroni salad, rice, crunch roll, and miso soup.  I over ate big time.  All of this food could have easily been split into two meals.  At under $10 for this, not bad.  A ton of delicious food for the price.  Fast forward a year or so and I was back.  This time I brough company.  I picked up lunch for the office.  We are all hooked now.  I learned from my first experience to limit what I order.  I am surviving the gastric bomb much better these days.  I get smaller combos for $7.50 that still come with a ton of food.  It is one heck of a value.  And their side salad is amazing.  I don't know what is in the dressing but it is out of this world.  My only real complaint about Maui Rose is the miso soup.  It does not seem fresh.  More like instant soup mix poured into a big pot of hot water.  I can look past that though.

If you are looking for quality Hawaiian food in the North Strip region, check it out.  Let it be known though, the restaurant is very tiny inside.

Sushi, mandoo, kalua pork, udon noodles, kalbi meat. The best bet is to get a combo or bento. Comes with miso soup, side salad, sushi and mac salad. depending which bento or combo, you can get tempura vegi and shrimp. The meat I got was chix katsu cutlet and kalbi ribs.

As much as I love their meal options, the reason for my recent visit and this review is for their spam musubi.

I was once again given some of the best spam musubi I have had in the city. First off, they actually give you a decent cut of spam and a overall good rice to spam ratio. It was grilled perfectly with a nice amount of crispy caramelized crust. The rice was soft and moist and complemented the spam. Another good thing about the musibi here is that the sauce isn't overly sweet and there wasn't too much of it. It was a holy trinity of spam, rice, and sauce (all wrapped up in seaweed). And it is affordable. It is less than two bucks. Same price of a street taco but more filling.

I can't wait to try more of their menu, and at the very least, get some more of their awesome musubi. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a affordable and tasty lunch.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,2,2,4,NuS39Vmocz0odccWWm2sZg

I've come here a handful of times and don't have any complaints about the flavor of any of the food...it's just right for my taste buds. However the place is very tiny and although they attempted to make some seating for dine-in guests it's almost better just to take your food to go or eat it in the car. It could be claustrophobic at times during the lunch rush. 

I usually pre-order my food on the phone so I can avoid the wait they are pretty good about making your order on time. My usual here is the lobster roll and the Philadelphia roll. But I have tried the bulgogi...Delish. Short ribs...Delish. And a handful of other sushi rolls...Delish.  The prices are decent! Not too steep and the portions are a nice size...so it's worth the money for sure! 

The guy working the counter the last time I was there was full of personality and he was kinda cute...lol but that doesn't make my review...it is seriously the quality of the food.

Head up to the counter to give your order and take a seat.  Your meal should be arriving soon.

#42 Combo Special ""Kalbi, Chicken Katsu Cutlet, Crunch Roll, Crispy"" (Reg $9.50)  The Kalbi is pretty tasty, as I recall before too.  I remember The Husband not really liking the mac salad before, but this time he ate all of it.  

#22 Vegetable Tempura, 10 pieces ""served with steamed rice & soup"" ($6.50,)  Pretty decent size meal for the price you're paying.

Everything on the menu is under ten dollars, and that includes the bento boxes and combination meals. What a great deal! 

Service is efficient, and the people at the counter are nice.  It's an easy place to go, satisfies the food cravings, and doesn't break the bank.

I have to say that provided the cost of the combos, they sure give you more than you can handle.
