Every time I went to first Friday I always wanted to try the fuku burger truck just never got a chance to. 

The actual restaurant is located in the Hawaiian Market place on the Las Vegas  strip. I usually avoid the strip while living in las Vegas because I like to avoid drunk obnoxious tourists lol. 

When we arrived the cashier was very friendly asked us if we had questions etc. The menu is simple but very detailed. 

I got the #4 kinoko (mushroom burger).  I was kind of weary of the pickled red ginger. I love the stuff but just on rice lol. I was actually amazed at how well the ginger complimented the grilled shitake mushrooms. 

My girlfriend got #2 Tamago (egg) burger she said it was amazing. 

There are two different types of fries one has a sauce and the other just seasoning. Both were great the dried fries was better. The one with the sauce was great in taste but really salty.

If you tip they give you Asian jelly stuff in a tube lol  the guys were really nice they tolerated my girlfriends obsession with ketchup lol

Overall I'd come back for sure.",pe0CNeHQWQhWV0PmgwYRMw,0,0,4,4QeIEk_9WhYkcGO3h4cpxA

My wife and I got two burgers and an order of fries for carryout today for lunch (7-23-2015). She ordered the mushroom burger and I got the spicy burger (I forget the clever Japanese names). Both burgers were absolutely bursting with flavor and the burgers had a really good crunch that must have been the perfect sear. I thought the flavors were excellent and the value for the meal was great.

We have had Bobby's Burger Palace and Bachi Burger during this visit to Las Vegas. I find both the other places to be very good, but I must say that Fukuburger will be a place we will return to for each visit to Las Vegas due to the VERY friendly staff and the absolutely delicious burgers.

This is just the worst experience ever because of the poor customer service at this new location. Their operating hours on yelp listed to be closed at midnight on a Saturday night. We got there at 11:20 and they told us they are already done for the day. I mentioned to them the operating hours on yelp, but the guy just did not care at all. During the whole conversation, he stayed in the kitchen and just yelled to us that they are done for the day without any further explanation or an apology. I work in the industry myself and I totally think that the situation would be way better with a simple apology and better attitude.

We are from SD and always tried to catch their food truck when we were in Vegas. We've gone to their Hollywood location a few times before it closed down (boo hoo). 

We stopped by this location on our way out of Vegas for lunch. Service was top notch- guys at the counter were friendly and quick to greet. We asked for some extras and they brought them right out to us. We ordered two Tamago burgers and jazz fries. We ordered our burgers medium but they came out well done. My husband was slightly disappointed his egg wasn't runny and burger was well done. It wasn't the drippy, juicy mess he's used to from Fuku. But it sure didn't stop him from eating the whole thing. Jazz fries were delicious as usual. 

Parking was free in the lot once we mentioned we were going to Fuku Burger. It wasn't crowded on a Sunday afternoon. We paid $22 for everything which is a steal on the strip. I'm sure we will be back next time we're in Vegas!",xIaTzfOHDYsRsHy76TP3eA,0,0,4,hFgA50LWs6lIUYNjOR2Mqw

708166,2015-10-19,0,QpmotuTsf_nHT8RKViFMPQ,"I read all the hype about Fuku Burger and was really excited to try this place out on my Vegas trip. Maybe my expectations were really high, but the burgers were good but did not wow me. And I don't think that that I would go out of my way to grab a burger here again.

I had the buta burger and my other half had the kinoko burger. We asked for the burgers to be cooked medium and medium rare but the burgers came out well done. But that's alright, over cooked is better that under cooked. I also heard other customers complaining that their burgers were also well done. I also had the jazz fries which I thought were nothing special, but tasty. Brown gravy and mayo makes everything good, (thinking loco moco), I'm from Hawaii but grew up in Japan and know these combinations really well, is the owner from Hawaii, or have local connections? Flavors seem kind of ""Hawaiish"" or local kine with a Japan twist. Also, just to throw it out there I had a lychee slurpee that was 12 bucks without any alcohol in it. That's almost how much Fat Tuesday charges with  alcohol in it. I thought that was a little bit expensive. I did have them add a tequila shot which was 2 bucks extra after finding out there was no alcohol in it which I thought was reasonable. 

 IMHO  I think I might of went on a off day and would like to try Fuku Burger again, I especially like the burger wrappers with all the cool stuff written on them. I can read Japanese and thought it was funny and creative thinking as hell, only if you all can all read the s**t that is written on the burger wrappers LOL :). Oh and I think the burgers and fries are a great deal but the slush or slurpees are over priced, Oh well, it's Vegas.",Sr8u_7mOR-ZCOqC938df6w,0,0,3,jCQbmzntnipXdrNzLSd9Bg

The burgers are reasonably priced at $7.99 which kinda made up for this little inconvenience of dodging pedestrians who want a death wish ignoring any safety precautions.  There is parking validation so be sure to ask for it!

Hubs and I shared a Tamago burger where the patty could have been bigger and the bread was a tad dry.  Does not come with fries but you can get one order and share it. Flavors were good though.  We got the fries with gravy and crack sauce.  I was guessing the crack sauce is mayo with somethin' spicy like Rooster.   I was close!  I like the size of the fries, not too skinny and not quite steak fries.  Crispy on the outside in order to hold up to the sauces and not get too soggy. 

We showed up late afternoon after the mad lunch rush, so no waiting for us and plenty of seating.  The place has a fun casual vibe with interesting anime type of art on the walls.   It's also fun that you can give them a crazy name and they'll call it out. They guys who work here are friendly and laid back.     

This is a fun place with a bar up front.  I can imagine the vibe would be fun and different at night.   So if you're in the vicinity of Hawaiian Marketplace, recharge yourself from all that walking and try these burgers.  They're really good.  Also, from the other reviews and the response from management, it seems as though he really does care about feedback and customer service.

We split a fry because the burgers are huge.  Not sure what all is in their crack sauce but it makes the fries even more amazing.  They should bottle it.  

The restaurant has a prime location at Hawaiian marketplace.. Right on the corner.  Next to Chili's. Didn't seem very busy.

Would have given five stars but there is no restroom.  Restrooms are important. Especially when you have a bar. 

Oh. If you park, the nearest lot is $5.  Either that, or some smart, enterprising dude is sitting out there in a vest, getting his hustle on.

2228534,2015-05-11,13,QpmotuTsf_nHT8RKViFMPQ,"Pleasantly surprised!

For a burger place located on the Strip, with the addition of toppings included in the price, Fukuburger is a solid burger at a very reasonable price. Each burger is $7.99. They have five, and also one chicken sandwich also priced at $7.99.

The fries are on the pricey side though, at $3.99 for plain with dipping sauces, and $4.99 for the Jazz fries with all the fixings.

They also offer a loco moco style burger $7.99 and a Naga dog for $8.99, though these don't seem to be the main draw here.

We tried the #3 Buta (bacon) and #4 Kinoko (shiitake). I was afraid the teriyaki sauce was going to be too sweet like so many Americanized Japanese places, but they used a more authentic tasting sauce that is more salty than sweet, though you can definitely taste the sugar. The Kinoko had a tad too much sauce which made the bottom bun soggy. But I really loved the buns. Very soft and fluffy with an almost smooth yet slightly sticky feel on the outside. If you're familiar with Asian bakery rolls, this was very similar. And the buns were toasted nicely on the inside for some nice light crunch.

Both burgers were good. I preferred the mushroom, however bf preferred the bacon. Next time we will try the tamago. Another person in our party tried the #5 karai (spicy) and he said it had a decent kick to it.

Staff was very courteous and orders came out quick.

They do ask you to give them a funny or fake name for your order though. Have fun with it and don't be uptight.

Only minus is you have to go outside to the Indian buffet's building to use the bathroom. They don't have their own. These burgers are messy so you will need to wash your hands afterwards. The bathroom is in serious need of an update.

Oh yeah, easy parking at Hawaiian Marketplace lot. Just tell the attendant you are going to eat at Fukuburger and he won't charge you $5 to park there. You get two hours free. Just show your receipt when you leave. Just make sure not to toss your receipt!",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,25,22,4,iKACamjwEB-h_VapQ7RG0A

2323043,2015-06-29,7,QpmotuTsf_nHT8RKViFMPQ,"This place may as well be called F-U burger because that's the way they'll treat you as a paying customer. They have no regard for their customers and will call you disrespectful and offensive  names just because you don't like their food/business and/or don't give them a 4 or 5 star review. Even if this wasn't the case, there's no way this place deserves 4 or 5 stars anyways and here's why:

First off, the tables are super dirty. There was no clean table in sight...you have all these employees but not one can take the time to wipe down tables every once in a while? I've worked in the fast food industry for many years and this would've never happened at any establishment I've been affiliated with. Our group had to clean off tables ourselves to just be able to sit and eat. 

The burgers are greasy and juicy, which isn't a bad thing but they do not have a restroom or sink for customers to wash their hands at after. This is ridiculous. What kind of place doesn't have facilities for paying customers? Especially a restaurant? I can't imagine the employees have to leave the store just to use the restroom so there is no excuse for not having a facility for paying customers to use. 

Their prices are also pretty steep for a hole in the wall walk up burger fast food joint. If you get a burger, fries and a soda for 1 person, it'll set you back somewhere in the mid teens. Sure the burgers and food are decent but what is this Gordon Ramsay's? If you're going to charge these prices, at least have a cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing location, like other similarly priced casual dining spots on the strip

Never have I been so offended with a food establishment in Vegas and I will no longer do business with them in the future. What a shame because the food was pretty decent. My visit on 6/4/15 will be my last.",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,15,3,1,JNpRKbMl50HHZsMZyTIuBA

2420482,2015-12-05,2,QpmotuTsf_nHT8RKViFMPQ,"Where the new Fuku burger disappoints me is their prices.

Inflation inflation inflation

That's usually the theme of restaurants near the strip, which is why I usually avoid that area like the plague. So when they opened another Fuku near china town off of jones and spring mountain (previously the location of where white rabbit was) I was hoping they'd be a little softer on pricing.

Don't get me wrong, Fuku is good, just not worth $14 for a meal, or $9 for a burger good. When I think fast food, I think cheaper. I can get a full meal at in-n-out for half the price. 

But the pros to Fuku is the fun and flavor of the place. Parking is relatively easy, and you can't help but love the idea of having a funny name for your order be called out. Seriously, I much rather pick up an order with pride at the name of ""scrotes-mcballstein"" than just plain ol' customer number 76..

Their tomago egg burger is really simple but full of flavor, its a must here and it's the only reason I suffer the consequences of $9 a burger.. Their buns are also pretty soft and fluffy to bite into compared to most burger places.

Fuku is fun place to grab a snack if you don't mind paying a little extra for fast food, but when I think fast food, they're usually the last option I think of. Maybe if they didn't fall into the escalated price game, I'd consider giving them a better score.",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,5,1,3,f-Rk8yBXbEMO64m0OT5Fcg

What makes FUKUBURGER unique is the Asian inspired combinations in the burgers. It makes it different--but in a good way. Only of course if your palette is open to new things. I guess you wouldn't be a true foodie if it isnt. 

I had the KARAI SPICY BURGER, and let me tell you, it really IS SPICY! It definitely made me sweat. So if you don't plan on sweating while eating, do not order this. BUT if you are a fan of hot and spicy food, this is delicious and a great choice! But you've been warned on the spice/hot level. Again, I wish I didnt eat this with a group of coworkers and friends. Was a bit embarrassing sweating and constantly patting my head with a napkin and drinking soda.

The burger meat itself was delicious too. The other flavors they add on didn't take away from being able to taste the meat. It was cooked perfectly too. I believe the lady taking the order mentions they are all cooked medium? 

Now it can get a bit pricey when you add on fries and a soda. So expect to pay at least around $10 per person. The fries are good too though. They are seasoned and come with some dipping sauces that top it off. 

So definitely worth a shot. Like I said, it's different--but in a good way. Not the usual burger. Some may not like it, and that's fine. But if you are open to try new things and fusion of flavors, give this place a shot.",Qv0xMxEs9XHEqI_9zb8vcQ,4,2,5,s3asFpaagVgFnaCEu_DZzA

The Burger was thick but not too thick to make you feel gross but it was cooked well, while still a bit pink in the middle like a burger should be. The onion strings, with the egg and the sauces made a damn good combination. I can't wait till the next time I'm in LV so I can get a different burger. 
Other than the food the service was great. It was nice to see a bunch of young people working here. They were all very helpful. I also like the fact that you can actually see the kitchen, so you know its clean.

  It's a soft opening for the new restaurant location inside Hawiian Marketplace.  They have tables outside & inside.  Food was fantastic as always, this would be a great locals hang out.

  Burgers run $8, and fries are $4.   I got a number 4 Kinoko ""mushroom"" burger protein style no Wasabi  :)  Boyfriend ordered a number 3 Buta ""pig"" burger.  The juices that come out of these burgers is so delicious. You must try dipping your fries in the Crack sauce.  It's scary to try new things but we've been following their food truck for a few years now. I'm glad I tried it & now we're big fans. 

  The cooks thought my outbursts were hilarious when the "" I'm in love with da cocoa"" song was on.. they uh, cheered me on I think? I've seen every spoof video on YouTube & I thought it'd be funny to sing along.. We enjoyed the play lists they had & I got excited when the ""whip it through the.."" you know, I did the Emeril Laggase ""bam"" motion at the bar.  They were rolling.

 Always good times, music & fast service. Positively the best time we had all night just hanging out on the strip, not gambling.


Update 3/29/15 9:25 PM  Again. Service was amazing we caught them just before closing up shop here. I was floored when one of the cooks came up to ask how our food was tonight.  I replied,  ""Juicy"". I loved how locals treat locals. If tip you get Tip Jelly (reminds me if jello?).. Mine was strawberry flavored & I didn't take a picture but they cool your mouth off quickly.

3206087,2015-07-18,0,QpmotuTsf_nHT8RKViFMPQ,"FUKU BURGER. I pronounce it wrong, but I like it!

We decided to check out this burger place, due to a Groupon we purchased, which was $20 off the bill for $11. We are burger aficionados so thought this could be a good place to eat.

After our first full day in Vegas and further exploration of The Strip and other hotels like The Bellagio, we planned to visit FUKU Burger.

When we arrived it was very quiet, only a handful of people in the restaurant and nobody sat outside. The place is located in the Hawaiian Marketplace, a little food court area next to Chili's on The Strip.

I went for the Karai Burger, which was the spicy burger with habe√±ero kabayaki, which had a nice layer of guacamole and pickled cucumbers. The burger was nice and fresh and complemented well by the avocado. Maybe too well as the flavour overpowered the taste of the actual burger. My girlfriend opted for the Butu Burger, which was with bacon, cheese, pickled red onions and ginger, covered with a subtle BBQ sauce and wasabi mayo. Both burgers were very tasty!

The staff were friendly and you order at the counter similar to In And Out Burger but then the food is brought to you, whether you are inside or outside.

We shared a portion of fries, which were standard quality and the soft drinks are refillable, so good for taking a drink on the go. Most places in Vegas, or even the U.S. have refillable soft drinks.

Overall we were very satisfied with the food. It certainly filled the burger craving that I had :) I would recommend this place for anyone who fancy a good burger, fries and a drink for two for under $25. It is the perfect location for anyone staying in The Strip.

While we got things organized we ordered burgers. Oh my gosh. We scarfed down the Pig Burger with the bacon and sauce and it was delightful! Eating in the car rapidly was not ideal but the food was so wonderful!

The first was in Hollywood, next the small Linq/FAME food court version, and now we are here.. in the Hawaiian Marketplace. Despite the great food, the first two locations didn't last long but heres to hoping this one survives. 

Fukuburger is probably the best (and for me the only) reason to visit the Hawaiian Marketplace, an oddly located and mostly defunct shopping complex in front of Polo Towers. Despite the questionable location, the food has never been better. Five burgers and a chicken sandwich are the backbone of the menu along with a variety of sides. I had the Buta burger which is essentially a bacon cheeseburger and the jazz fries with crack sauce (fries covered in mayo and gravy). The Buta was delicious with fresh crisp bacon and the tangy fuku sauce created a great contrast. My friend's chicken katsu sandwich featuring a panko crusted chicken fillet and shredded cabbage is worth getting as well. The fries were not bad but all of the sauces made the fries a little soggy. The menu is reasonably priced ($7-9 for entrees and $4-5 for sides) but portions could be a little bigger. 

The restaurant though not as flashy as their old Hollywood location is still inviting and well appointed. There is a large patio area with views of City Center across the street along with plenty of spacious booths inside. On the downside they do not have a full bar and parking can be a little complicated. Overall a great edition to the Strip; I just hope people know about this spot and are able to find it.

Stick to what you're good at (food truck) and close this restaurant. 

Filthy ambiance: An element that's so important to any restaurant, especially one that's right off the strip. Heavy water stains from the misters that coat the machines and counter tops. Dirty seats that look like they came from Goodwill. Overall a bar that just doesn't look appealing enough to even purchase a simple beer from. The music inside has constant profanity and it's so loud I can't even hear anyone speak.

Poor customer service: Such a crucial part of any small business but when your staff doesn't smile nor look happy serving (girl with grey hair) who does that reflect? I've experienced so many small restaurants who's staff is genuinely happy and provides above and beyond customer service. Who's fault is that really? The management failing to lead by example or just the team member not giving a _______.

Drenched patty: I guess when it comes to eating burgers everyone has their own style. I guess that's why so many people rave about the sauce which IMO is drenched and soaked.

I've eaten there before at the older location over a year ago. This location is located inside the Hawaiian Marketplace. We parked in the pay parking in the lot across the street ($5) although we found out later that we could have received validation if we told the guy guarding the lot in advance. I ordered the spicy burger over rice (with no bun) and it was cooked perfect and tasted great. The boyfriend ordered the Fuku Moko. He thought his was just ok, nothing special. Also I was pretty disappointed in the ""Garlic"" fries. It tasted like the grease was old or something and gave the fries a weird aftertaste and I didn't taste any garlic. I think for two people you should receive more than two tiny little sauce containers. The white crack sauce is pretty good... but you should at least receive a normal size 2 oz portion. 

The place is pretty small and I think it might be nice to check it out when it heats up and you can sit at the outside bar. Our table was clean, but when the boyfriend grabbed the Sriracha  bottle it was caked in oil and grime and who knows what else. Someone really needs to make sure those bottles are cleaned. While we were eating the TV's were both on an infomercial. We asked the girl behind the counter to change the channel. She and someone from the back changed one of the TV's but then each TV was on a different channel but both had the volume on, so it was actually worse. I don't know it was a pretty slow night and there was only one other group, I think they could have done better by us.

I visited their store right for a late lunch so the place wasn't too busy at the time.  Great for me since I didn't have to worry about a long wait time for my burger.

Here's my burger verdict. The Tamagu was ok. The patty was cooked well done instead of medium but it was still ok. Would have wanted it a little jucier and not crunchy. The Buta Burger was ok too.. Hubby ate it all and he ate half of mine. He said he preferred the Tamagu. The garlic fries were freshly cooked and crunchy. It was a little salty for my taste. A serving is enough for 2 people.

By the way, instead of a free burger, they gave us the fries for free. Not bad.

Not sure If I'll go back but I suggest you give them a try at least once.",lgoMChnRVAP_s_OgHQa56Q,0,1,4,5X0fHkNgWwzCAyphM2dxkQ

We really enjoyed our Kinoko burgers here the other night.  Ingredients were fresh, tasty and high quality.  The teriyaki sauce was slightly on the heavier-side as far as taste was concerned so it may be worth asking them to put less on it or have them place it on the side.  

Service was good once they realized they had some customers waiting the counter, but we had to yell a few times until someone noticed (it was a slow night there).",GksgDgj09Zl8foywi_Egmw,0,0,5,RUJYsCtQstvvG4pQChi5Lg

It's a bit of a shame that this awesome little burger shop is kind of hidden on the strip. It's located in the Hawaiian Marketplace, an area I had no idea existed. It's definitely worth the trip.

The first thing I noticed was that the inside was cool. There's a lot going on on the walls, this sort of anime art on the walls. It seemed like a great place just to hang out. They also had a few TVs going on and wasn't too busy. Also, the music was on point. They were playing Drake, Big Sean, Kendrick Lamar etc. 

The other awesome thing was when you order your food, you give them a joke name they have to call out when your order is ready. I went with the ever reliable, ""Tig Ole Bitties"". I thought that was a fun touch to the standard fast food affair. 

As for the food, the Tamago ""Egg"" Burger is their #1 burger and I can't argue. You can never go wrong with a fried egg on a burger and the crispy onion strings added a nice crunch and saltiness to the burger. The wasabi mayo added a touch of heat but wasn't slathered on there.

The Buta ""Pig"" Burger was also great. It's a lot of meat as it's a burger patty with smoked bacon and BBQ sauce and the wasabi mayo. Again, it was a ton of meat and flavor. Definitely felt like I got my money's worth with the burgers.

You also shouldn't skip the fries when you are here. They have CRACK fries there, and yes, they are fantastic. 

We spent probably over an hour in there just relaxing and eating this delicious food. Also, they had American Ninja Warrior on the TV and we got into it. Even the people working there got into the show as well. That's just a mark of a place that doesn't take itself too seriously. Providing good service and having a fun time as well. 

When the people working there are having fun, you are bound to have fun as well. Get a burger here! Enjoy it!",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,5,1,5,CXNjQ0GJnLwI9gj-tb-e_g

4234059,2016-01-06,2,QpmotuTsf_nHT8RKViFMPQ,"Fuku is my favorite type of sloppy gourmet burger. As in a little less fancy and a little more street. Hai. 

Where In N Out is my husbands daily go to, Fuku Burger is mine. 

These are Asian-fusion burgers, specifically Japanese, and they are damn good. Mind you I'm half Japanese and half hamburger. But really, I prefer Fuku over the more expensive gourmet fusion burgers out there besides Bachi. Totally different animal even though it's not. If you know you know. The point: be prepared for the sauce. If you're a plain hamburger purist, as in no cheese please, I am one of you and this is not that kind of place. You are not coming here to taste a distinct beef patty. 

The Buta burger is my pick because it has bacon. If you're not familiar with Asian flavors or fusion, I'd suggest you go this way or to the Fuku (the plain). But do an egg if that's your thing (""the Tamago"") or the Karai if you're a foodie, especially a burger foodie. That's a thing right... or is it just me? 

Whatever you do! Do not freak out and take out the pink pickled ginger god damnit. Do you hear? Do you copy? My husband tried to do this the first time he tried Fuku and I nearly divorced him. Seriously. So stubborn. I know it sounds weird. Even when you know what it is, it sounds weird. I mean pickled ginger on a burger? But you have to trust the concepts here. Plus you can always trust the Japanese when it comes to the American burger. As if they cannot fathom that they didn't invent it themselves, they translate it the best. 

You can't get these kind of burgers at these kind of prices around here often. Especially near this location. My favorite burger for under $8? You got me for life. 

Sober or drunk, I can't get enough. This is the spot since they validate parking at this location.

Everyone there was hilarious. They played good music, so honestly, we stuck around and chilled long after our leftover fries had grown cold. It was also amazing to watch a couple of super blazed dudes come in and want to order the entire menu.

I've had 2 of the burgers here.  The Karai (spicy?) and the Tamago.  Honestly, nothing super memorable.

The Kinoko was slightly over-sauced and salty. Also got an order of garlic fries with crack sauce and banana ketchup. The fries were not garlicky at all and tasted pretty underwhelming.

I decided to order the Tamago burger with a side of jazz fries. Even though we ate here for dinner, it is easy to imagine just how popular Fukuburger is as a late-night joint.

The Tamago burger is stacked with crispy fried onions, plenty of delicious sauce, a perfect ooey gooey fried egg and a hearty beef patty. Soooo good. The jazz fries were also crisp and SO tasty with the combination of gravy and ""crack"" sauce.

   This review answers the what concerning one of the newest burger establishments to land on the Las Vegas Strip. It is based from the dining experience we had here on a late April Sunday evening. 

   When you hear the sound fuKu, it conveys a vulgar word instead of a culinary accomplishment. Fuku is a positive word in Japan that means ""lucky."" FuKu Burger is really Lucky Burger. Preceding and concurrent to opening their brick and mortar location on the Las Vegas Strip, the FuKuBurger food truck has been delivering this lucky burger to Las Vegans. When it came to my brother and I, Yelp had delivered this lucky burger to us through highly acclaimed ratings. Being up for a highly acclaimed burger experience, we'd give it a try.

   FuKu Burger is the lucky burger that is an anchor in an unlucky location. It sits in the highly vacated Hawaiian Marketplace which is an island of calm between MGM Grand and Planet Hollywood. The fact that Hawaiian Marketplace is an island is calm might be a contributor to the sundry of available tables on a patio overlooking the heart of the City Center.

  There are two seating arrangements. They are either inside or outside. Being that it was a nice evening we decided to sit on the patio taking in the people activity along the Las Vegas Strip with a backdrop of the City Center. My complaint about the patio was the loud and borderline obnoxious music blasting overhead. The noise had an aggressive beat that stole from the dining experience.

   The service was friendly. At the time that we were analyzing the menu, which pretty much is six different burgers, a hot dog, and two styles of fries; the woman at the outside bar was personable and knowledgeable. Because FuKu Burger is self service, the interaction with the staff is minimal. In similar fashion to its name, it is self service with a unique twist. When we ordered, the lady encouraged us to give them a nickname. After a few minutes of sitting in the patio enjoying our beverages, she'd call out, ""Smiley,"" my brother's high school name.

   The highlight of my FukuBurger dining experience was the Kinoko aka ""mushroom"" burger with Jazz fries. I could of ordered the Buta ""pig"" burger, but I love my mushrooms. The Kinoko burger was a palette of culinary art between two perfect hamburger buns. The mouth watering beef burger was the canvas for melted American cheese interspersed with shitake  mushrooms, strokes of wasabe mayo , teriyaki, and strands of pickled red ginger. The Jazz fried that are sold separate complimented the unique burger. The crack sauce and gravy were the unique ingredients that elevated the taste.

    In a way, FuKu Burger is the lucky burger. At least on Yelp. After my experience enjoying a unique and tasty Kinoko burger and Jazz fries on the Las Vegas Strip on the patio overlooking the heart of City Center, I have added one more to FuKu Burger's cannon of highly-acclaimed rated reviews.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,15,13,4,wUEr-lruh8_G8n0IIqLlSQ

For the price you pay, I dont think it is worth it at all. I ordered that Karai Burger everyone was crazy about but eh, yeah it was spicy but whatever. Too much sauce and it gave me a headache. The actual portion was pretty small too.

Boyfriend got the first burger which looked like a traditional burger and it was just OK. 

With the not so friendly price and ridiculous parking situation, I dont see myself coming back here again. I rather go to Gordon Ramsey Burgr. The restaurant itself wasnt too big either. It had about 4-5 booths and that was it. Menu had about 6-7 different burgers with 2 french fries option with some Hawaiian fusion dish with Loco Moco but was named differently. When I walked in during lunch time, there was only one person waiting for his burger. It was so empty that I had to question myself why did I come here because I was so annoyed with the whole parking. I could have walked yeah but I stayed at Palazzo and there is no way I could have walked all the way from there. Thought about parkinf at the Miracle Mile Shop and walk but my legs were too tired from walking so much the night before.

The girl working at the counter was nice though and thats the only reason why I am giving this place a three star rating.",_VD870pQZJPqcGd07vxMsg,4,3,3,JXh47uP_kwv-hyQKhKTIhw

2 starts for the value.
This review is for the new location on Jones which isn't up on Yelp yet.

Went to lunch with a coworker, we had 2 burgers ( they were great) 2 jazz fries, 1 bottle of water, & added bacon to one burger, total $34.00.

The burgers have great flavor but aren't that big to justify $7.99 each. The fries are good, but I'm not sure why some people rave about a little gravy and flavored mayo being drizzled on them is that big of a deal?

Doing the math, they must have charged about $5.00 to add bacon to the burger?",kzd8RMZKbDoZF133UjNRVA,1,0,3,c3hB_eNDxkDo0780ahQc9w

The service is exceptional and coming from LA, I love me some Asian Fusion food!
Had to get the jazz fries since I am addicted to poutine and this seemed similar, as well as the chicken sandwich.
Fries were good, but nothing like poutine, just fries with gravy. Still, they were very good, as well as the chicken was tasty as well, still would have preferred white meat over gray which was a bit of a turn off.
The guys had burgers and fries and loved them as well.
Prices are fair, so are portions, one of the best values and most unique and tasty flavors on the strip!
Love the vibe of the place and that the cook came to check on us.
Love the margarita pitchers they sell here, keeping mine as a piggybank for my son at home.

They have outdoor seating with an outdoor bar where you can order food as well (if you're under 21, you have to order inside). Indoor, the decor was Asian pop art-inspired with upbeat music, which gave the place an urban feel to it.

The food is an Asian-infused take on burgers, which gives the burgers a unique taste. I had the tamago burger (a burger with an egg and fried onion crispies) and it was the best tasting burger I've had in a while. The burger patty itself was juicy and savory, the onion crispies made the burger crunchy (sometimes the crunch makes things taste so much better), the sauce added a certain tangy-sweetness to it, and the bread was crispy, yet soft and edible. PERFECT.

Staff acted like she was trying to force being nice to us, but that didn't matter because the food was still bomb. A must go.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,13,11,4,TJIwAPvqhFNu6--6hYTlBg

5659912,2015-06-25,20,QpmotuTsf_nHT8RKViFMPQ,"Never in my 7 years of reviewing my experiences on Yelp have I ever encountered any business owner who is so unabashedly unprofessional that it would warrant a review such as this. I'm aghast at the owner's response as I didn't mention things in my initial review like unclean tables, or dipping napkins in our water cups to clean our hands, as I gave this place the benefit of the doubt that this wasn't their norm.

My original 3 star review, along with the addendum that I added as a response to the owner's comment on my original review will be at the bottom of this piece.

What happens when you combine the petulant entitlement of a spoilt millennial, a startling lack of ethics, and unbridled hostility? An experience at Fukuburger.

I grew up in a family that owned a b2b produce company that spanned multiple generations. They supplied restaurants & grocers with produce. I also had to go through multiple food business courses at UNLV's hotel college for my minor. This program is rated neck & neck with Cornell for the top program in the country. I understand how food costs are determined & I understand purchasing. I also understand that no two customers are alike and that matters of taste and value are subjective and unique to each person. Ex: bun cost. I don't eat them, therefore, where they're made is irrelevant to me.

Anyone who has attended a US public school is familiar with a bell curve. In grading, some people will fail, some will ace the class, but the majority of people fall somewhere in the middle. They're not bad, they're not exceptional, they're simply average. From my profile, anyone can see that my reviews follow a statistically natural bell curve. Most of my experiences are neither terrible or so exceptional that I proselytize for them. Such was my initial experiences w/ Fuku.

While the owner tries to silence dissent by throwing around baseless accusations of racism and resorts to a favorite of tyrants everywhere - libelous character assassination, he fails to address my values as a customer. 

Quizzically, the owner believes that stating his restaurant's & clientele's style is ""racist."" This place doesn't serve rustic, country fare. It's a place that has a tatted, suggestive menu girl, hip hop on the speakers, sports on TV, & Asian pop art on the walls. Saying it is urban and reminds me of the pop/hip hop ABDC show is no more racist than calling a place a hipster hangout or biker dive bar.

I believe strongly in the principles of freedom of speech, information & dissent. I believe in standing up for truth, regardless of the slings and arrows a business owner throws. Customers have a right to express average experiences.

People should know that the owner hypocritically lectures me on my review ethics despite dating a former Yelp intern, and he violates the TOS by offering meals, free of charge, to those who write positive reviews, as evidenced by his owner comments on other reviews that have been flagged. No wonder his avg. is so high. I don't know who he's friends with, or why he's so offended that he felt the need to go on the warpath, but nothing would surprise me. I don't advertise that I review on Yelp to businesses, nor have I ever accepted compensation in exchange for a favorable review. My reviews are trustworthy.

May this 3rd business shutter like the other 2 locations.
--------------
Original review: This place is the definition of hype. I've had their food truck fare and was meh about it. Gave them another chance and went here on 6/4/15. I had the butta burger along with fries. Nothing about the food warrants these prices, especially because everything is ala carte and will run in the midteens for a burger, fries and a drink.

Okay, so everyone here looks like they're from ABDC & it has an urban SoCal vibe. The food has artistically drizzled mayonnaise atop it. Whatever, the flavors are lacking and the value just isn't there.

***edited to add - don't worry, I won't give this place another dime. Apparently commenting on the vibe or clientele  is racist, even though Yelp has such things ""hipster"" vibe ambience option. Owner is resorting to petty attacks because his feelings are hurt because of a 3 star review, not a 1 star, a THREE star review. The food was bland to me and not a good value. Not everyone is going to be an ""omg I'm a fan"" of the business. Maybe the other locations would still be open if I alone thought that the prices weren't justified but that's not reality.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,14,10,1,juF_BBp3cA2SkBa03G2dNQ

Fuku Burger delivered all this and more, with the topper being a Japanese-inspired joint that spoke volumes to my nerdy anime-loving soul. Walking in, the walls are decorated with rectangular Japanese portraits that are reminiscent of Gwen Stefani's ""Harajuku Lovers"" series. The menu was simple to read, understand, and to select food from. The Kinoko burger with mushrooms and pickled red ginger was juicy with the right amount of tangy crunch--and gone quickly, as it was excellent. The fries with the accompaniments of their notorious ""crack"" sauce and sweet ketchup were perfectly seasoned and I couldn't get enough of them.
