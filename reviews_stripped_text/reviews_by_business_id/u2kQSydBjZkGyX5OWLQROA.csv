119274,2017-01-29,0,u2kQSydBjZkGyX5OWLQROA,I just had the most amazing meal... their #14 Carne Asada combo platter.  There wasn't one bad thing on the generous plate (and I devoured everything).  The waitress who took care of me made great suggestions and was very attentive throughout my meal.  Need great Mexican food near the airport?... stop looking around... this place is a gem!  I'll definitely come back... hungry!!!,_AfU-gyi-rYTaO3zNXU2yg,0,0,5,sxWTuhn1InyEX9an0qXYow

Today i went there to get an asada burrito and when i got back to my work and opened my order, the burrito was torn up and loose, so loose that the contents of the burrito was everywhere. Tried to rewrap it but theres just no hope for that burrito.",7HtdoVuDFBHzABNMNwGPFQ,0,0,1,9oJx7E4QTll_sA6lpHWTxQ

The food here is so good that if you are on the strip and you don't have a rental car figure out the public transportation to get here or walk because you'll need to burn off the calories. I have two foods that I discovered here and they are fantastic here that I try everywhere else I can get them: Mamey and Chicharrón.

Get the Mamey Aguas frescas and as an ice cream too. Both of these are made here and the Aguas frescas are made every morning! Then get the Chicharrón in your favorite style, gordita, sope or taco. Soooooooo good! Food adventure all over the menu here, the staff is incredibly helpful and will guide you to the perfect meal to put you into a food coma.",r4Yy_zKElwm-x1-KRKCjeQ,0,0,5,6Ytm71cPwyi-mxObyex3xg

The staff is quick and get food ready by the time you get to the cashier. This location also has tortas, tacos and other Mexican good items.

3127574,2015-06-10,0,u2kQSydBjZkGyX5OWLQROA,"We strolled toward Marianas after dinner at the Crab Corner, and are very glad we had the nerve to come in.  English was spoken by the workers but it was definitely Mexican in clientele.  There is an outdoor taco stand on the sidewalk in front of it.

Great exotic ice cream flavors: corn, dragon fruit, cheese, rose petals.  I had a fruit ice called sepote that was delicious.  

Look at the pictures that somebody took and posted here on Yelp, come in and order something you've never had before.  

My wife had butter pecan, which they called nuez, and it was great.  Very rich and creamy.

The scoops are $2.50, $3.50 & $4.50, and the prepared dessert plates called funny cake, banana hawaiiana and banana split, etc., all pictured on the wall behind the counter, are $5.75. 

There are also a selection inside of pelotas, which appear to be exotic, handmade popsicles, but with textures. 

Delicious!",mXbENM6RBcJegz_jGJVvzQ,1,0,5,bb3YIEecapLL9QTIBNJgFA

All the ice cream is made on site and the food is great. Even though the breakfast burrito isn't on their 40+ item menu, they made it for me. They are so nice and fun. I would recommend having ice cream for dessert. I had the strawberry and it was bomb! Please visit and you will be a returning customer in no time.

They always say with any cultural food ""the hole-in-the-walls always have the best ____ food"", and this is a prime example. It hardly stops there. The same love and attention lends itself across the board, from chips to chimichangas.  The owner is an absolute pleasure, whose warm personality and cheery presence just adds to the overall experience.
