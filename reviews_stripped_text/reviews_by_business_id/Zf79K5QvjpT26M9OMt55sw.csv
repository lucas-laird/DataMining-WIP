476994,2013-12-27,2,Zf79K5QvjpT26M9OMt55sw,I became sick from the Tilapia today. The waitress called over the manager & she bullied me into her own belief that the fish was fresh?  I became immediately I'll & vomited in the Restroom. We were not treated like guests & I have never become ill during a meal.  It was embarrassing & the service we received was horrendous!!,jna1GAIsTyvzbpI3VLuNyQ,4,0,1,B-E8H2QrXsVsrUH2e-grJw

My turn came up and I ordered the same thing. He clearly sabotaged the dish and it was swimming in sauce. It was beyond salty...Like he was!
The manager was kind enough to offer walking up with us to make it right but this does not coach and correct a bad employee with a bad attitude. He may spit in our food!

After we passed the smoke filled casino, things got better. We were quickly seated and the hostess was very pleasant (with smiles). Our waitress ""Sylvia"" was extremely nice and very attentive. We never had to ask for refills on our drinks and she removed our dirty plates quicker than any other buffet we have experienced. The food was good. I found nothing to be old or dry. Everything was quickly replenished by the cooks. There were plenty of good choices in every category. The desserts were exceptional as well...also with plenty of choices! All of the staff was wonderful. We will definitely be returning again and again. The reason I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the smoke from the casino floor tends to wander into the dining area and is unpleasant while trying to eat. Otherwise, great place to eat and I definitely recommend it!",SHbdttG7J91kcuuwNZ4-5w,0,0,4,dSEA0GXTEuNK67pkZfsRkw

First off poi was definitely frozen and not fresh and those little serving cups made it ridiculous.  I had to grab 9 of those to fill a small bowl. The poke fish was the same and I swear there was more onions than fish. The spam fried rice was to me the highlight of the dinner. The bbq pork was pretty good if it was from the fresh batch. Apparently they do not know the difference between roast pig and kalua pig. They basically had a pig that looked liked it was hacked with an axe. No shredded pig whatsoever and being it was just randomly hacked the meat was dry.

On one of the flyers at the door laulau is mentioned. When I asked where was it they said they don't serve that there. So let's move onto the sweet stuff.... The malasadas is definitely no Leonards but my suggestion to you is eat it hot. Once it cools you may chip a tooth. The pineapple upside down cake was ok but how can you really mess that up? Now as for the haupia. Oh my I'm guessing way too much cornstarch. I couldn't stop laughing. I picked it up and it bounced off my plate like a ball. The waitstaff was nice though they kept serving us flat soda even after I mentioned it.

But what's the saying? You get what you paid for.... well I feel robbed. My suggestion take your 12 bucks and eat at a regular Hawaiian restaurant or better yet wait till Saturday pay more and do the Silvertons Hawaiian buffet, way worth the 20 bucks. All I know is I'm gonna ask for a partial refund since all I really ate was rice.",5cR_GVGXvz8_MOehn8sZFA,1,0,1,g8OiHyNIcKr2AMJ4wcATwg

The food here isn't great but it also isn't bad.  What it is is filling.

The fried chicken was on point and the rest of the food, including dessert was worth the price I paid, which was nothing.  

The decor of the buffet as well as the casino is dated but that's fine with me.

The seating needs to be replaced as the vinyl was cracked and actually a bit sharp to the touch.

Service was excellent though.  

The place does get busy since it is inexpensive so plan on getting here early.

As a 25 year local, this has been one of our ""go to"" buffets. The price is right and it is close to my home.  My last review complained about the quality of the food and some management decisions.  In the last couple of months the quality and variety of food has improved greatly.  We are brunch on the weekend and lunch during the week, seldom dinner guests.  The carving station offerings are always very good, and recently, turkey, ham AND pork loin have been available.  Liver and onions are back (always very well prepared) and even meat loaf has reappeared occasionally.  I feel it important that I update my previous review to say that I recognize the improvements.  
I still question buffet management's decision to upset most employees schedules.  NO ONE, not the employees, not the quests like the changes. We are adjusting our schedules to accommodate your changes because we value our time with our favorite servers and food handlers.

Here is the first story:

We arrived, my wife, soon to be ten year old daughter and myself were standing in like and talking about said birthday. There was an older lady in front of us and she had in her hand one of those gaming cards you can get at casino, use it when gambling and earn points that you can use towards the casino's buffets among other options. Anyway the older lady saw us, heard us talking about the pending birthday and offered to buy us lunch, using her players card. ""Consider it an early birthday present!"" she said.

WOW ! My wife was in tears by the generous offer.

Here is the second story:

I love this buffet simply for it's Mongolian Barbecue station. My nine year old daughter has never tried this kind of barbecue, and followed me to try some for herself. If nothing else she wanted some free chop sticks. But here is the conversation we had...

Father: First put some of these noodles on your plate.
(she did)
Father: Would you like and of these with it?
(pointing at onions, green peppers and such)
Daughter: Nope
Father: Roasted Vegetable?
Daughter: Nope
Father: What about the toppings on that side of the counter?
Daughter: Nope
Father: Okay, would you like beef?
Daughter: Nope
Father: Chicken, you said you wanted chicken earlier. Maybe some pork?
Daughter: Nope
Father: What about sauces? Want some teriyaki or soy sauces?
Daughter: Nope
Father: You just want the noodles?
My Daughter at this point smiles and looks at the cook, and gives him a dollar I handed her to give to him as a tip.

I let her be as she waited for the noodles and helped myself to the Mexican food station just a few yards away. I got back to our table before she did. When my daughter returned a few moments later, she had something on top her noodles.

Father: What did you put on your noodles?
Daughter: Orange chicken dad... DUH !
(Insert blank face with blinking eyes here)

Food is satisfactory at best, but for Las Vegas casinos, that's what I expect.
Service was better today that at most Buffets. Usually you have to wait to get a refill on drinks, plates to be cleared from your table, etc. Not today.

The only way you can get them to change something out is to take it all put it on your plate yourself and throw it away.

They did offer made-to-order mongolian food whatever that is BUT the pasta,pizza,mexican,chinese and american was pathetic as usual-all dried up and unappealing-twice I walked the whole thing and NEVER put anything on my plate.

This buffet really lives up to its 2 stars - I walked in with low expectations, but figured that it's kind of hard to screw up Hawaiian buffet food, so how bad could it be? The answer is pretty effing bad.  

I was lured in with promises of laulau, kalbi and lechon (crispy whole roast pig) - all lies. No laulau or kalbi, and their lechon was tasteless with rock hard skin not crispy. Some other reviews complained about the poke servings being small, but who cares - it's ayce and these were big chunks of decent quality fish. That, the fried rice and the chicken long rice were the only positives I found - they managed to eff up everything else there. Even desserts were bad - I've never seen bread pudding that looked like that, hard stale malasadas, pasty haupia w big chunky gobs of cornstarch in it. I felt guilty with how much food I threw away.

Even at only $13 I felt ripped off with how awful the food was. If you have to do a Hawaiian buffet, do Silverton's for $20 instead. I also heard that Silver Sevens (ex Terribles) has a Hawaiian night coming up with a loco moco bar!

Located in the dingy and cheerless Fiesta Rancho, a Station Casinos property.  Judging by the appearance of the Fiesta, Station has a bifurcated strategy--keep the high-end properties in tip-top shape while letting the 2nd-tier joints lapse into disrepair.  The Fiesta is only about ten years old but looks 25. It's in an unappealing part of town.  The only reason to go is to redeem a 2-for-1 buffet coupon.

I wasn't crazy about the Rampart Buffet, but I liked it better than the Fiesta. The first thing you notice is holiday stun tunes blaring over loud speakers.  Forget about having a civilized conversation trying to shout over the music. 

The serving stations are Italian, American, Mexican, and ""Mongolian."" The best feature is the stir-fry station where you select your veggies and the guy fries 'em up.  He'll toss in various meats and sauces. Some diners leave a $1 tip.  

I couldn't finish my helping of dry, tasteless, stringy chow mien noodles.  The meat loaf was bad.  The pork egg rolls were dry and tasteless. The American section had small, shriveled filets of a nameless fish (tilapia I was later told).

The Mexican station has a do-it-yourself taco bar. There's really nothing to like about this buffet. I would never pay full price here.  At 2-for-1 it's barely worth it. I gave it three stars, however, to compensate for my anti-buffet bias.

But, on the other side of the spectrum, you get a lot of stereotypical suburban middle-class families(you know, the ones with the 9-5 jobs, 2 children and a dog) eat here to save money.

They allow homeless people to eat here. 

Today, there was a homeless man eating here. He brought his giant bag full of empty soda cans, clothes, and all types of items he had collected in his life.  For the next 40 minutes we had to hear him scream, talk to himself loudly, make loud choking/coughing noises, and to make things worse he constantly kept banging the table with both his fists for no apparent reason. These episodes of punching the table went on for about 30 seconds at a time, and could be heard from outside the restaurant.

The server just decided to abandon the area. He knew that everyone sitting in the 4 tables surrounding the homeless man was gonna be pissed. He accepted the fact that he was not gonna get a tip from any of those guests, and made a decision to not service any of us. 

This isn't the worst experience I've had with a host sitting me next to inappropriate people. When I was at the Flamingo in Laughlin, the idiot host sat me next to a group of 6 guys with swastikas tattooed on their foreheads.

I'm actually shocked that the bum didn't ask anyone for spare change when waiting in line at the Mongolian BBQ area. I'm gonna give this place an extra star for actually serving Turkey at the carving station instead of possum. I'm also gonna give this place another star for making sure there wasn't a severed toe in the bread pudding.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,7,2,3,9Yhm11D7Zq5eK0jFzJXKzw

The only things I would be interested in eating again were the roast pig and bbq pork. The rest of the food didn't do much for me. Most of the main dishes and sides I tried were over salted and the dessert options were just sad. The only thing I liked from the desserts were the little cream puffs that you can buy at the grocery store. 

Service was sufficient, but there were times that dirty plates and empty drink glasses sat a little longer than I would have liked. The sodas on the second round of drinks were all flat, so no one drank them and it was hard to find our server again to get them replaced. 

They have singers and a hula dancer that come around to entertain everyone on Tuesdays. It was pleasant, but I would have preferred they stuck to one corner of the buffet instead of moving around to each table, since we had to awkwardly sit through their set, afraid to be rude and walk up to get more food while they performed. 

I heard other patrons complaining about the price since it was a special menu that they weren't anticipating. 

They did have a good amount of Hawaiian items to choose from, if you're interested in checking it out and the price seems about right for it. Just make sure you sign up for their player's card to receive the discount, since it's about four dollars more if you don't have one. One player's card will get you the discount for up to two diners.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,4,2,1FCRLvKaJ6muIFPv5Tpyvg
