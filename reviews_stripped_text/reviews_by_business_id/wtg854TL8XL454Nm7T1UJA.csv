The ones I had in middle school at lunch were better.
The dog has no flavor is completely forgettable.
Plus, they raised the price from 0.99 to 1.99...so while it may have been worthwhile at one point due to the price, its no longer the case.",js-cfoxnhINZHvm3QR6hTQ,3,1,2,JHRo4-7VF0a9AThbjxmsJQ

I was staying in the Westward Ho and low and behold I stepped out of our room and there it was. True to the documentary the dogs are inexpensive (99 cents) and HUGE. Me and my buddy halfed them. Unfortunately, it both gave us stomach pains some time later. The hot dog is nothing really special epicurean wise. Obviously, it's the size and price that attract customers to help put quarters in the machines at Slots Of Fun. At least I can say I tried it and cross it off my list.",fefbZ3J59Ca4WMmLKa-D-Q,4,2,2,jAe4apSYXX6HZQn8egpJ5g

I love slots of fun, but not the hot dog.",aKY4eFOJeCaXnw1jGPozTw,4,0,2,KHoHCCjhxgsOGILxP_BCJQ

Oh, the disappointment.  The hot dog was definitely not a half-pound and it was double the price.  And the dog was mediocre at best.  Apparently the half-pound hot dog ship has long sailed.  

Still, it was fun to visit just to say we've been.",f6gLCW3xasyascQLoy5vdQ,6,0,2,Culbie86vlDhZtPc6TVxBw
