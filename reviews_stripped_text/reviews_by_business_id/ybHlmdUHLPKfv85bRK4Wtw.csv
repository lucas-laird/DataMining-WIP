I used to frequent this place to study and I'd stay there hours at a time. For some reason, this is the coffee shop where I manage to get the most work done. There's a good amount of outlets and the noise level has not been a problem. 

My favorites from here are the butter me up latte made with cookie butter, the pbm, the nutella latte, and the mayan apocalypse! I recommend exploring their menu because their other drinks are just as delicious. And I've overheard their willingness to make you a new drink if you're not satisfied with what you received. 

Staff is friendly and they even walk around to check up on you to make sure you're doing okay. In all, the atmosphere, the drinks, and the service are excellent. Grouchy John's a must-try for those who haven't yet.

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Starbucks; but going to a non-chain coffee shop just feels better, and gives me a more genuine experience. It also reminds me a lot of the Bay Area, i.e., a world where both homogenized coffee AND more intimidate, community-feel shops can co-exist. 

I had the ""Grouchy John,"" which is a white chocolate and amaretto latte. As a person that LOVES ""sweet"" coffee, this was heaven!  They offer five other coffee specialties.  The shop also offers pastries and the muffaletta sandwich from Bread & Butter in Henderson (which is also delicious).  Oooooh, so many good things! 

The place has about nine two-person tables, and a couple of couches.  There's a couple of bookshelves, with a wide variety of books (and ""good"" titles), and board games (scrabble, yahtzee, etc.).

Two other things I love: it's a comfortable temperature inside, i.e., the A/C is not kicked into overdrive, and the music isn't too loud. This means I can actually read or have a conversation in relative peace. Oh yeah, the staff is really friendly (ok, so that's three things). 

Last tip: if you tell them you do reviews on an online social media site, you get an extra stamp on the frequent flier punchcard. Yee haw!!!",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,3,0,5,BtM7v-uWZXBvWTWHthJtTg

Being a student I often find myself going to one when I need to get out of the house (too many distractions) and get some hard core reading in.   I've been to the big chains and you can find me pouring over books in out of the way cafe's.  I've been to hipster joints, shi shi posh pinky finger up when you sip espresso places.  I've seen the highs and lows.  So what puts Grouchy John's heads and tails above the rest simple they care.  From the drinks to the way they treat customers they just care.  I've been here a few times now, and have just decided to up my frequency on today's visit.  Things I have noticed on my stay here firstly they seem to know their customers, now I'm not just talking drink preference any average Joe can do that, but they truly seem to know them and like them.  If I weren't the jaded individual I am I would assume that they're inviting some of their customers over for Sunday brunch, as they seem like old time buddies.  Now am on that level of chummieness with the staff, no, but that did not stop them from walking to my table and asking me if I wanted a glass of water. I know there is somebody out there saying, ""well whats the big deal with that"".  Well it is a big deal.... when was the last time somebody did that for you?  In fact I have seen them treat everybody with that same level of thoughtfulness and respect.

The drip was pretty good... once it cooled down. When I got it, it was burning hot and tasted a little bit like the beans were burnt in the process. Once it cooled down, the burnt tasted went away.

Whether you're looking for a nice pastry (they get theirs from Bread-n-Butter, you can't argue with that), that cup of coffee or just somewhere to hang out on a hot or cold day, this place is a gem. Not only can you get all those things, this place also offers board games (free) and random books (free) that you can use while you're here. So, leave all your stuff at home and come use theirs.

I love a great coffee shop with an inviting atmosphere, especially when the service is there to match. Every time we've come here, the girls are always nice and friendly. There's usually an asian (I think) guy there that is always helpful. I ordered a bagel and he even bought it to my table for me. Now that's service. 

However, be careful of the two men crew. We were there on a friday afternoon and the service was not all that. The guy that took my order didn't seem to care. I tipped him and he just looked at me like it wasn't enough. Not to mention he didn't even say thank you. When they called our order, we went to the counter to pick it up and again the other just looked at us, annoyed. This is the first time that we've had bad service here.

There are a ton of options for drinks and they have awesome latte combinations (I recommend the Iced OG or a hot Christmas in a Cup). Drinks can be a bit sweet, but the staff is more than happy to alter your drink to be 1/4th sweet, or however you would like it. Ask about their Monday half-off drinks. Another good deal they run is their stamp card. And for those who don't drink milk, they have both Soy and Almond milk.

I have been coming here for three years now, and for someone who doesn't have family or a huge network in Vegas, it's almost like a second home to me. What other coffee shop will give you a free drink when they find out you lose your job and also gives you a reference/contact for a new job?

Grouchy John's is my favorite coffee shop for so many reasons:
1. It's local! It's so hard to find affordable, local places in Las Vegas so this is truly a hidden gem.
2. The service - the owners are here every day, and they're really personable guys who want you to have a good experience. The staff is super helpful.
3. The ambiance - Just go inside. You'll love it.
4. Starbursts! I still don't know why they give them out, but I'm not complaining.

My go to drinks are a simple nonfat latte (something I refuse to get at Starbucks because it's just not the same quality) and an iced chai with almond milk (another reason Grouchy John's wins), but really everything I've had here has been delicious.

964516,2012-05-17,0,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"Working in the customer service industry myself, I find myself very critical (and oftentimes very disappointed) in the lack of this crucial element in businesses (both big and small). 

From the first time I set foot in Grouchy John's, I was immediately greeted with happy faces, great attitudes and I saw that every customer before me was greeted by name. I knew then that this place was exceptional. From that moment on, they remember what time of day you typically visit, what your drinks of choice entail, what special preferences you might have (what kind of milk or sugar you use, etc), and they even remember where you work and things you may have mentioned that you participate in outside of your daily visit. True customer service at it's best. 

One of the things I was intrigued about with Grouchy's was their penchant for community support (they take their business mobile and participate in local events), and their support for local merchants, vendors and small businesses (almost everything listed on their menu can be found here in Vegas - the coffee, the tea, and even the pastries!). 

THEN came the actual tasting itself... Heaven. In. A. Cup. Their menu includes a wide array of different and unique flavors, tastes and options that truly separate their menu from the leading chains, and they have something for everyone. The coffee itself is very, very smooth with a nice finish that literally tastes amazing by and of itself. If black coffee isn't your 'cup of tea', you can choose from a really neat of dairy alternatives (almond or soy milk), the usual milk or half-and-half, and sugars and sugar alternatives including agave nectar, stevia and honey (among the usual sugars). It doesn't have that 'burnt' taste you tend to chalk-up as 'normal' when visiting Starbucks or any of the other big name chains. It just tastes GOOD. Who knew coffee grown here in Vegas (Boulder City) could taste so fantastic? Although I typically get an iced americano with almond milk, their lattes are incredible, their espresso is comparable to that piece of dark chocolate you savor with each bite, and their unique flavors (Salted Caramel Latte, assorted smoothies, and 'Specialty' flavors such as the 'Butter Me Up' created by the customers and staff themselves) are something you won't find anywhere else. And the Starburst you get while waiting for your order will surely put a smile on your face. 

They truly cater to the health conscious and/or people who may have an allergy or sensitivity to the typical 'dairy only' products seen on most menus. 

The teas are also something left to be desired. The interesting blends and flavors brought in by a local woman who owns Joy's Teaspoon are absolutely amazing and definitely worth checking out. You won't find tea blends like hers anywhere. The Almond Cookie (decaf) is an experience in itself and you won't find anything like any of the other flavors in any other stores or coffee shops. 
The pastries (brought to you by the staff at Bread and Butter and Tasty Bunz) are to die for. Be sure to get a macaroon next time you stop in. You won't be able to just have one bite. 

Also, they have board games, bookshelves loaded with good reads and the atmosphere and ambiance is very inviting (think comfy couches). Stay for a while and get your work done (or just chill out and stay awhile!). 

All-in-all, Grouchy John's is a small business with a big heart that specializes in making people feel good and guaranteeing you will have a wonderful and fantastic experience each and everytime you walk in to buy your daily dose of caffinated goodness. Not only will you leave with a smile, but you will be a part of the growing community we love called Grouchy John's.

1079958,2015-08-29,2,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"A COFFEE FAIRY TALE

Once upon a time, there was a magic elixir known as ""coffee."" People far and wide loved and revered this elixir for its taste and it magical ability to keep them awake at all hours of the day and night.

Then, an evil mermaid came along and built coffee shops every 200 feet. She decided to produce coffee that was often burnt tasting. To cover up the poor coffee, the mermaid loaded up her drinks with sugary syrups that masked any taste at all. The result? Carb-loaded beverages that tasted nothing like coffee. And she laughed her evil laugh while sucking money out of her victims' wallets like some demented cross between a Dyson and a $10 hooker with poor taste in coffee.

But in a small hamlet known as Henderson lived a valiant errant knight named Sir John of Grouchy who declared that it was indeed possible to not only have delicious coffee, but to offer a menu filled with flavored coffees, milkshakes, frappes and magical bunny rabbits where not only could you taste the individual flavors but still taste the actual coffee that went into it.  

(EDITOR'S NOTE: Though we haven't specifically seen the magical bunnies on the menu, we're relatively sure they're hidden there somewhere. We also assume that although Sir John is grouchy, it's unlikely he would serve up bunny rabbits for consumption and they are likely only on the menu to distract small children while their parents imbibe tasty beverages.) 

In late August of 2015, this knight brought forth a pumpkin spice frappe that was not only made with real pumpkin (not just some sugary syrup), but was so cleverly balanced in flavor that the coffee was still the front-and-center item to be celebrated. A single sip of this frappe introduced the individual flavors of pumpkin, coffee and cinnamon to the tongue with not a single flavor overpowering the others. A glorious treasure to behold.

A sampling of other items from Sir John of Grouchy's menu revealed that this clever balancing of flavors was successful across a myriad of coffee-related and non-coffee-related items. And thus, the balance and harmony of the elixir ""coffee"" was returned to the kingdom and Sir John was held in extremely high esteem by hundreds and hundreds of coffee enthusiasts, among them this fairy tale writer.

Although the evil mermaid continues her stranglehold on the fair citizens of the desert and much of the rest of the world, Sir John of Grouchy continues to hold his Sword of Coffee Excellence aloft and fights a valiant battle daily against this force of evil. Only we, the faithful following, can ensure that Sir John emerges victorious in his quest.

The End
(EDITOR'S NOTE: Well, not really the end. The store's open seven days a week. So you could technically go any day you want and that wouldn't be the end. Unless you moved away. But even then that wouldn't be the end because you could always visit. But you know what we mean.)",dBHCPvgl1b81iXzF9FTXHg,1,1,5,_Q5iCqiBC3JgA1zFRUzpjw

1118420,2015-09-20,1,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"Grouchy John's is my NEW favorite study spot. It has everything I could want in a coffee shop and I would give this place more stars if I could... Sometimes, as I am driving to Grouchy John's, I found myself seriously considering whether or not I should just move closer to it since I'm there all the time. I would probably be there everyday if I lived closer. 

So start off -- atmosphere is always amazing. I love that there are two separate rooms-ish. I think they expanded, I'm not sure. But one is more coffee shop like. The other is more like a fun lounge, cafeteria like atmosphere. Tons of games set up for your enjoyment. I love the decor!!! Super cute.. I love how community driven this coffee shop is!

I used to be a Starbuck's barista -- I'm not going to pretend and say I know a darn thing about coffee because really, they don't train you to know much -- but I will say that out of all my little experiments at Starbucks making secret drinks and concoctions... PALES in comparison to the amount of choices that you have here! Though I usually order my regular - iced coffee with light cream, I like to venture out and try interesting flavors now and then, and Grouchy John does just that! I've had quite a handful but still have mountain loads left to try -- and I love that. The OJ is probably my favorite so far! 

I think what separates Grouchy John's from other shops -- the people. Definitely the people. I don't interact with them as much as I'd like mainly because I'm always in intense study mode. Medical school does that to you; takes away your ability to interact normally sometimes. ha, but I observe. The owner tends to be there, and he and his team ALWAYS makes the effort to let you know that you are well-taken care of. They are always welcoming, and put in that extra mile to acknowledge you. He often says ""Welcome back!"" That is so little, but can mean so much. It means -- he remembers you and hasn't forgotten you. I can't rave enough about the customer service they give and the genuine-ness that they provide. I set there HOURS on and and they don't ignore me, they will often come around and ask if they can bring water or refill my coffee. I love that it seems to be a very close-knit community and the owner seems to know everyone that walks in by name! They really try to make you feel at home here. 

Other bonuses here:
1.) First coffee and tea refills are FREE!
2.) They have stamp cards, check in and get 2 stamps, get 10 stamps, and your next coffee is on them!
3.) On Mondays -- they have flavor of the day lattes half off! 
4.) They have this Coffee and Paint? Not sure, something like that. But basically coffee instead of wine, and painting!! This definitely seems like fun and the art looks amazing! Again, love how engaging it is with the local and community around it!


I love trying new places because I am a huge foodie, but Grouchy John's has utterly put a stop to my search of finding a coffee spot. I don't need to try anywhere else! I rave about this place and tell all my friends because GJC deserves to be talked about. As a medical student, I don't know how else I would be getting through it all without GJC's... it really is the perfect atmosphere for me. The ONLY thing I would change about this place?

The walls have a lot of different art that makes it fun to look at. This place is truly a hidden treasure; they deserve so much more recognition than they receive. They also have such a large variety of beverage options- smoothies, teas, seasonal drinks, and of course...coffee! They also have so many substitutions for milk which is so helpful.

I ask the cashier for my change and receipt she in a very smart-alic voice, "" oh did I not give you your change? And laughs""!

She right than and there, rings up my order and gives me my receipt and change. With her being under pressure, she rang it up wrong.

The parking lot is a nightmare, was scared to park my car because of crazy people in and out of their junkers. Not sure where all the crappy cars came from, the place was almost empty.

In the back room I look up and notice shit everywhere. Boxes, supplies, furniture and dirty crap lines the nasty painted back wall. Stacks of shit everywhere. Flowing out of the kitchen? What is all that crap?

Then the smell.........this place REEKS of dirty soured mops. It made me dizzy. I don't know if they serve food here but along with a rotten mop there is probably dirty garbage cans and rotten food.

1. If you love Star Wars, this is your coffee shop. Many of the drinks and decor are inspired by Star Wars.
2. Once a month Grouchy Johns does a canvas painting in the shop.
3. If you check in on Yelp, they'll give you 2 stamps on your punch card. 
4. Every Monday, they have a 50% off drink.",3zf53USnWVkoESWD-RswJA,1,1,5,yKZfNjC-wXKYrYZuavXArg

Well, Im sort of a late night study bug, but despite their early closing hour, I would've (and now will) totally come here whenever I do get the chance to study in the day time!

It's not your ordinary coffee shop for sure. You could walk in, sit down, chill, or order your go-to at the drive thru. They have a shared private parking lot in front of the entrance. There's a fair amount of specialty flavors for lattes to choose from, hot or cold, non-caffeinated or caffeinated. (Still dying to try their Sith and Jedi lattes) They also have teas and pastries as well! As for the coffee, they taste better than I've expected them to turn out. Butter-me-up and Nutella has never tasted better in a coffee cup. (:

Now let's talk about ambience. It is definitely a vibrantly decorated place (on the inside.) So much art, starwars decor, canvas', board games, and an indoor mural against the largest wall in the back room. Oh and they also have a television inside as well! I realized that they have a lot more tables than other coffee shops I've been to in Vegas, so finding a table won't be a hassle for anyone wanting to study here. Not to mention, they have a few tables outdoors as well near the drive thru.

Customer service has always been more than excellent each time I've been here. They're patient and super helpful whenever rI don't know what to order each time around. I also got starbursts upon completion of my order LOL. They come around as well and check up on you if you want water or anything.

When you do come here, don't forget to ask for a stamp card as well use the yelp check-in offer for an extra free stamp!

If you've never been here, then you HAVE to come here on you're next coffee run. Who doesn't love another unique and beautifully designed coffee shop?",wzMXdjM-_DlDBkpg3xKnGQ,29,23,5,AaUxq-V2H_qMZijIP5tPDQ

I am not going to say that all of them have bad customer service by Starbucks maryland location is aweful!
So back to my dear dear Grouchy John's, So from day one I have been a very happy customer! The customer service is the best I have ever experienced! That alone tells you why they have people come time and time again breaking away from the chain coffee places. The coffee is amamzing, love all of the creative flavored drinks one of my fav's is the Cinnamon dolce with white moca almond milk and whipped cream. Now on that note one thing I like is yes i am not getting reg milk but want whipped cream and they always catch it before I get my drink if someone forgets, the guy joked the other day and was like they can't miss the most important thing. The place brightens my moring with the friendly employees and the top notch coffe I am a fan of this place. I have not ordered a coffee that I have not liked almond roca mocha is another favorite of mine, I love the milk options as well, I prefer almond milk and they have sugar free flavors!!

What a difference from other coffee places :)

They have once a month evening painting classes taught by Tommy Vinci.  I've been to 2 of these and they were fun.  They are the kind where everyone paints the same thing but everyone seems to paint to their own inner Van Gogh which is part of the fun of the class.

Some pros and cons...

PROS:
-amazing and friendly staff; customer service is definitely their forte.
-two lobby areas, a lot of space to sit down and study, read or just chill with friends.
-FREE WIFI
-tons of books and board games available for their guest.
-a drive-thru that is manned efficiently making it easy for people on the go.
-GREAT coffee and specialty drinks--they never disappoint.

CONS:
-they are located by schools, so when so is in session for the year and its 3PM, the coffeeshop is crazy packed super busy; a little distracting when you come here to work or just relax.",Fpfw1dtekpW1beAH8T1cwQ,3,2,5,V8hqyF1cHo3qbIRCFFaLKw

Great service from JJ! He really creates a friendly, happy, neighborhood atmosphere. Either he or another barista usually come around every 45 minutes to an hour checking up on everyone and offering water and refills. 

Also they have almond milk! My favorite order is their honey latte - just enough flavor to complement the espresso but not so sweet you can't taste the almond milk. They also offer a bunch of frappes and creative concoctions for those so inclined. 

If the drinks aren't motivation enough (which they totally are!), Grouchy John's has free Wi-fi, TONS of books to browse, and you get a couple of free starbursts with each order. 

My Vegas/Henderson go to! Great place to spend a weekend morning, or afternoon, or evening! Anytime really. With a drive through, there is really no excuse not to stop by for a latte.

I had forgotten how many times I've been back in the past 12 months, but I have to say, finding a decent cup of really good coffee on The Strip is zilt, nada, zero!! So I decided to walk The Strip and asked the locals where to go and get a good cup of Joe! Everyone said, go to Grouchy John!

It did not disappoint.  My first sip of their cappuccino, I was in heaven!! It was smooth and so good! I also enjoyed their funky wall decor. I also bought their delicious pastries, and I even got a chance to chit chat a bit with the locals.  There is also a nice outdoor area where they even provide a water bowl for your pooches.  With so much of my work travels to Las Vegas, Grouchy John, is the place for me to get away from all the hustle and bustle on The Strip!!

This place uses pure arabica beans all the way not no robusta like Starbucks, the quality of the coffee is rich, sweet, and earthy--just how it should be.

The service, selection of beverages, and overall environment are beyond what I expected from a small coffee shop. We decided to order an Iced Black-eye (iced coffee with two double shots), an iced Almond Roca Mocha with an added shot, and a blended Curious George( blended combo of coffee, honey, milk, and banana). Being our first time there and having an amazing menu to pick and choose from, the service from both associates was awesome in assisting us to pick from the selection. The flavor of the coffee and not having an overpowering sweetness from the ingredients included was very pleasing. Ive found that with most corporate establishments (not to say I don't appreciate a good Coffee Bean here or there) is the coffee itself gets lost behind all these added syrups, powders, or blatantly is not produced as rich as it could be, but Grouchy John's did it just right. Needless to say we enjoyed our selections beyond our expectations and the overall vibe and environment is very welcoming. I have to say if I was a student this would definitely be on my list of places to relax and study without the fuss and fight for a table or outlet.

They have almond milk which is a bonus because I drink way too much soy milk from other coffee spots that don't offer it.

Wouldn't know much about the smoothies, but I have a serious caffeine addiction and Grouchy John's Coffee does a great job with espresso drinks and coffee.  First, the black coffee is great.  Grouchy John's uses coffee beans that are medium roast (not French roast or burnt like Starbucks beans).  After they grind the bean down, they brew up a strong tasting and flavorful cup of joe.  Thumbs up.

The espresso drinks are great too.  The honey latte is my favorite, offering a sweet steamed milk drink with a sweetness falling between a mocha and a latte.  The honey provides a nice sweetness, but not so much that the taste of the espresso is drowned away.  Love it.  The mocha should be celebrated as well--for those nights when you want a hot chocolate, but also need a pick up--it's delicious.

I ordered the Almond Roca Mocha latte, iced (since it was 100 degrees outside).  It truly hit the spot - woke me up (but not like ""jolt"") and it also hit the sweet craving I was looking for.

Well....these guys use LOCALLY ROASTED ESPRESSO beans. The espresso shots are incredible. They are are truly perfect. Flavorful, rich, gobs of crema (which comes more from the freshness of the beans than anything else). If they served them out of the trunk of a Buick I'd still be a regular!

i have a deep appreciation for coffee and all of the heart and soul that goes into brewing a perfect cup.

i am not a patron of the green mermaid, or starsux, as i call them.
bitter and burnt does not a good cup-o-joe make.
i don't care how convenient it might be because there's one on every corner in every town.
like i said, i don't drink coffee cuz i need to, i drink it out of pleasure and starsux does not please me by any beans...means.
every other coffee joint could disappear and i STILL would not go to starsux.

grouchy john's, on the other hand, puts me in the least grouchy of moods.
i don't know the details, where they get their beans, what type of machine they use to brew, etc., but whatever it is that they're doing, it's all right in my book.
what i do know, just by drinking my delicious latte, is that they care about what they create, where their ingredients come from and how their clients feel when consuming their goods.

i always order a soy latte...PERIOD.
no extra this or that, easy on the blah, light here, heavy there, blah, blah, blah.
when you have coffee, you should be able to taste the coffee, not mask it with other crap.
gj's coffee has hints of nutty, rustic flavors and is as smooth as they come.
perfect crema on the espresso as well.
the temperature at which they serve the beverage is also just right.

Shout out Suzy H for the suggestion coffee and conversations.....knowing that never been Grouchy my beast partner recommended new spot for me! Talk about everything hip, cool, NON corporate/chain, and above all PERSONALITY. Right off the top before walk in the bright yellow color, the mobile trailer sits outside, the character that comes with the name/logo, and knowing only ONE location. The moment you open the door thinking myself SO much going on inside coffee shop is the last thing think walked in. Talk about hippie or woodstock feeling for me. The local artists (I think local) works all over the walls (not just one style from painting, size of the artwork, bold big colors, or think the coolest original artwork seen in any business second room completely covers one wall) not only original but great way support local community. All the different boards games anyone can pick up and play game. The books not just handful but few shelves of book from kids books to adult books. I would think like the board games community style just make sure put them back. The furniture nothing uniform in the place most part different style and sizes for all groups of coffee drinkers go hang out. The names of the drinks are very creative! Not that the place not modernize still have your widescreen televisions keep you entertain, pretty sure they have wifi, and lots of outlets plug in electronics over coffee. Not forgot about pastry they have display with few options not super big but sell bagels, cookies, and other stuff. Not sure if they make them on property but they were looking good. The workers are AWESOME. I love not only super friendly, explain everything cause talk about options, and just feel all positive vibes. I think about coffee more then coffee for me but more like place relaxing, chill, and place read great book or great conversation with family. Grouchy without doubt epitomize that feeling for me. Why without doubt deserve five star rating. Just wish the place was closer on my side of town. =(( 

Evil Monkey was not evil but heavenly. Not even sure all the things in it but saw chai that sparks my interest. I was really happy with my choice. They have stamp card program too.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,4,3,5,6hlgVTmFOaRAcOIYCrJhRA

The atmosphere is cool. They have a little nook in the corner that's filled with books. I didn't get a chance to check it out but I will next time I am there. There were plenty of little tables available for studying. I came during finals week so it was busy but not too crowded. I sat at one of the loungers and just relaxed for a while. The chair I sat in was a cute little leather sofa. From what I remember, it was a bit old with some tape on the arms but it was still super cozy! Definitely no complaints on my part.

I really love Grouchy John's because their staff really goes the extra mile to take care of customers.  If you're hanging out in the coffee shop, the employees will walk around once in a while to check on everyone, sometimes even giving free coffee refills and providing ice water. You really feel like you're in someone's home when you're at Grouchy John's, especially since there are so many awesome books and board games around to keep you busy if you're looking to spend your day or evening hanging out and sipping coffee with friends.  

This place also has amazing donuts, but you have to get there early enough or they'll run out! 

The coffee is great - my favorites are the Grouchy John's Latte and the Cookie Butter latte. Also, they have a wide variety of cold juices and smoothies if you're not in the mood for caffeine. 

I like to sit here and study, people watch, read, listen to music, or just relax on my day off.  Locally owned coffee shops beat corporate coffee, always!",1pqyIOcWh-EEHOR9AHUkWA,5,3,5,UFuJnnHbZjm4a0pP_FSXQg

It wasn't until my best friend started going there and making me get her tea did I start wondering about what made this place so special. I took a sip of her South Sea Magic and I instantly fell in love with this place.

Unlike most places where the tea taste is expected with the traditional black or green tea with the 1 flavor note or if you're lucky, maybe a blend of a mint for a little bit of a fresh taste. Grouchy John has a more complex blend. I have no idea where they get their batch from but even their Sencha Tea which is a darker green tea that is popular in Japan tastes amazing. 

Since I live a few blocks away from this location, this is a spot I visit weekly. Great sitting spaces if you want to chill and get some work done. A very unique coffee shop/comic book/library decor. And of course the #1 perk is that the drive thru is open 24/7.

The almond roca mocha was way too sweet for me, and I think it also has amaretto in it which I am not a huge fan of. All the syrup drowned out the espresso flavor, which was a bummer. I would definitely ask for less syrup in this one. My boyfriend's suicide smoothie (peach, mango, strawberry) was okay but nothing amazing. 

Our barista was pleasant. If I come back again, I'll try either the butterbeer or a more traditional espresso beverage for a better coffee experience.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,4,1,3,eN6hnikm4UPAjMVrE_FJ6Q

I love the artwork which is for sale.  I wonder if I can put my art work up too.

I like this place if you CHECK-IN you get an extra star stamp on your drink card if you buy a drink. Sweet only a few more then I get something free I think.  They have board games to play and books to read and seems like a pretty cool environment. They even have free WIFI

The first time I was here I needed to wake up a little and could've used a good coffee drink. Instead I noticed that they make something cool and because it was once again 100+ outside in Vegas during the summer I had to get some cold.  Went with the Strawberry Banana Smoothie with whipped cream on top which was delicious. They were fast at making it. 

The customer service was great and friendly, I enjoyed the environment.

Grouchy Johns is certainly my favorite from what I have tried so far. I generally only drink iced mocha's or iced coffee especially when it's hot out. The mocha is very good, especially with an extra shot to tame the sweetness of the Chocolate they use. I would give an immediate 5 stars if they used Ghirardelli as its by far the best for a mocha but the syrup they use is good enough to satisfy my craving a couple times a week. The pastries are always excellent and I love their bagels. They also have a great variety of drinks with unique names to mix it up.

As the photos show, the inside is bright and colorful; it's a really nice change from the typically muted look of most coffee shops. There's plenty of pop culture related (mostly sci-fi, but especially Star Wars) art adorning the walls. Again, a nice break from what you see at a lot of coffee shops in Vegas. If you're a nerd like me, you'll probably get an extra kick out of it. They have a TON of books and board games, there's a TV with the news on (it's muted and closed caption). It's not too noisy in here so you can get work done pretty easily if you feel like it, but it's also laid back enough to hang out with some friends, split a tasty pastry and play a game.

I haven't tried any of their more unique drinks yet but I can tell you they make a mean dirty chai latte. I usually get it with almond milk. Their regular coffee is great, and so is the espresso (I guess that's obvious, since it'd be hard to make a mean dirty chai without some equally mean espresso). The presentation of the drinks isn't anything fancy, but I've never given much of a damn what the cup looks like, especially when the coffee is good.

I drove all the way from North Summerlin (Lake Mead/Buffalo) just to try a drink called Shirley Temple of Doom based solely on the name alone. It's matcha green tea with maraschino cherries. Totally worth it. I ordered it iced and it barely lasted 5 minutes. I'm definitely going to return and try other drinks.",y9vss4aVUULf6Zc86MCbvw,0,0,4,RkLx7PvokidwnJ6f6ehMzg

2557805,2013-01-06,0,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"When I was in college, I liked to consider myself a coffee house guru given that I had tried just about every single one in town within driving distance; and though Grouchy John's was about 15 minutes from my house- one of the furthest- I kept coming back because it was easily the best. Customer service was always grand and staff was always knowledgeable of their menu and able to make good recommendations. For me, some of the signature drinks like the Grouchy John are unfortunately just too sweet for my palate, but with a very wide variety and a willingness from staff and ownership to please, it is easy to find a beverage that you'll keep coming back to. And if you do not like your drink, whether it was made wrong or you just discovered it's not for you, they will remake it or give you something else to make you happy.

So for me, I recommend the Butter-Me-Up Late which is made with cookie butter but to me tastes like cereal milk if you're into that kind of thing. Also I love the Jedi and for a break from coffee, they make a superb apple cider with caramel and cinnamon add-ins if you like. Pastries, cookies, bagels, etc. are also delicious, but sometimes when they bring in merchandise from other shops in town it can be overpriced- but this makes sense considering the change of hands. That aside, this is one of the only places I know that really does cross-promote other local shops and bakeries in a wonderful way and Grouchy Johns seems to be the most involved in the community with their Thursday night networking (I forget the official name), clothing and toys drives, and more. Also, love the decor and their displays you can buy especially from local artist Tommy Vinci- very cool.

I would easily recommend this place to anyone. I used it primarily as a study ground, alone or with friends. The only thing is it is busy a lot of the time because it is really popular, so if you go there to study either bring headphones or adapt to a ""white noise"" environment. My only complaint is that I wish it could be open later more often for the night owls among us :) Maybe some day!",gXylvWNBORu4Wh3KoWxmnA,0,0,5,GoajrpwxZ-vSZFIGKtDvWA

J.J. has to be the coolest barista I've ever run across.  

With so many delicious choices, I keep finding myself staring slack-jawed (and drooling) up at the menu unable to make a decision.  J.J. has saved me every time, making recommendations and promising to swap it out if I'm not in love.   To date, there has been zero swaps.

I love this place.  It's comfy and fun....with fun cookies, fun art, fun forcefield activators by the register, fun games, fun books, and fun drinks.  I have a new favorite coffee shop in Vegas.

2889571,2015-03-06,0,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"If I could give Grouchy John's more stars, I would. Let me tell you why. 

I have been to GJ's about 5 times. My fiancé and I were lucky to stumble across this gem of a local coffee shop on our way home from a weekend Vegas trip. 

The atmosphere is awesome- think your neighborhood coffee shop- laid back, lots of games, comfy seating, and cheerful and unique decor. 

The drink menu is huge- lots of creative drinks ranging from coffee based to tea to smoothies. Everything that I've ordered has been fresh and flavorful, whether it's just a plain black coffee or a house special drink. I personally love to order a plain coffee, a latte of some sorts- try the one with amaretto with soy milk- and the yoda- a green smoothie that is full of fresh fruit and veggies. Yep- three drinks in one order. 

The best part of GJs is the service! We always make a point to stop in on our Vegas trips. The baristas are always extremely friendly, genuine, and ready to help. Drinks are freshly made and complimentary starbursts accompany them. Even though we aren't regulars, John remembers us! 

One weekend we had to make a last minute decision to drive back to Phoenix because we couldn't find a place to stay. We decided to stop by GJs on the way home to get caffeinated for our 4.5 hour drive. We walked in 10 min before closing, the chairs were up and the floors were being mopped. I could tell the kitchen was just about clean and shut down, but John greeted us like we were regulars and invited us to place an order.  On top of that, I had a free drink from my frequent buyer card and he deducted the most expensive drink. He chatted with us while he made our drinks and treated us like old friends. 

All of these interactions and experiences lent me to want to give GJs a high review. I remember wanting to give them a stellar review after my first visit and I am even more impressed that they keep exceeding my expectations! I wish I could go more often!",EsZ70yXs6i3Bf3PqK7sQdw,1,0,5,9iPUQZ1cbHBdqWE9CnSnsg

The seating area was very pleasant, with numerous couches and chairs. Choice of music was fantastic! Not very often you hear Modest Mouse while drinking coffee.
However, the coffee was not as impressive as the environment. I ordered a cappuccino, and my friend ordered an iced coffee. The cappuccino was incredibly hot! The milk was noticeably scalded, over-textured, and poured quite sloppily. When the coffee had finally cooled enough to taste, it was fairly standard, though it had a very strange, almost salty aftertaste to it.
The iced coffee was okay. It was not very strong-tasting, however.
I love that they brew Colorado River Coffee Roaster beans, but technique really needs to be elevated to capture my business from quality coffee shops like Sunrise or Samba Latte (which also uses CRCR beans, and effectively so). Grouchy John is allowed to be grouchy if he still puts enthusiasm into his coffee prep. Otherwise, it doesn't work.",BCfzyrMne5E9SKo6YT6aiw,1,1,3,Hk3W07TzBFMACPTZYi_kQQ

Lots of star wars decor and even drinks on the menu are cleverly named. I was greeted right away and the cashier (I think Robert) explained everything to me and told me to take my time. 

+1 for having unsweetened almond milk ($0.40 extra) because not a lot of places use unsweetened. 

They can make any of their specialty drinks iced, hot, or blended. Hot comes in 12 or 16 oz and I THINK iced and blended comes in 12,16 or 20. Extra shots of espresso are $1 each. I also like that they have smoothies as well for $6.85.

Drinks here are on the sweeter side.... like super super sweet. I got the honey booboo which has hazelnut and honey in it, with 4 instead of 5 pumps of hazelnut and I couldn't drink more than 4 sips without taking it back and asking for an added shot.  The drink was good, but too sweet for my liking. Robert ended up making it half sweet for me which was nice of him. He even offered to make any drink on the menu for me but I said I liked what I ordered and just wanted it half sweet. While the new drink wasn't amazing.... (I'd probably order less honey and 3 pumps hazelnut next time for some flavor), I appreciate the fact that he was so nice about remaking my drink.

There seems to be a lot of regulars here and the cashiers remember their drinks! Love how friendly everyone is and how it's not a crazy hectic atmosphere. 

If you like your drink on the sweeter side, this place is perfect for you. If you don't, just request is less or half sweet and adjust your drinks to your liking.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,1,4,q-lsQXbw3NOCHSEKzmzbxw

First it's the staff. It's a small group of baristas that are amongst the friendliest and nicest you will encounter in any type of customer service role. They remember their regulars and always have a happy demeanor, even if the shop is insanely busy. Oh! They make great coffee too.

The menu has all the typical coffee shop norms. I especially like some of their more creative flavor combinations like ""The Sith"" which is mocha and peppermint, or the ""PBJ"" which includes REAL peanut butter along with banana flavorings. They also have some food options including healthy wraps, and the normal pastry selection that is to be expected.

Decor is nice and inviting. This place is huge in the Vegas tech scene. You'll often find developers working hard on their Mac's, while some film guys discuss their latest project they're working on. They have a ton of books and games that you can grab up and enjoy, as well as a tv playing something geeky on the AppleTV. Plenty of comfy seating.

Food: didn't get to try the food. When it comes to coffee shops, I strictly stick with coffee. On this particular day it was pretty warm out so I wanted a cold drink. I was super excited that this place offered almond milk so of course I had to go with it. Their menu is short and to the point. I ended up ordering a flavored latte with almond milk. Unfortunately my drink ended up being so sweet I couldn't even drink half of it. The taste of the coffee didn't really compliment it either. Wasn't too impressed with the drink in the end. 

Ambiance: LOVED the decor of this place. There's so much lounge seating, cool and modern art, and even books and games to entertain yourself with! Also, there's a television but it was turned off when we were there. I'm really digging the Star Wars vibe going on here.

Service: service was alright, nothing really memorable. The guy at the register neither ignored us or helped us. Since it was our first visit there he could've been more attentive. 

Tips: My rating went mostly towards the shop itself. It seems like a cool place to hang out and chill with friends. I'm not a big fan of their drinks and I think I'd rather go elsewhere to enjoy a cup of coffee.",3J1zT17J07X5OUeFq0lgMQ,5,4,3,YgRGIdEZZjFgPC_rlvhPfg

3112235,2017-03-30,1,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"One of the best coffee shops that I've ever been to, by far. Why? Its not just the product (which is pretty good) with Grouchy John's many coffee blends, pastries and other snacks. Its not just in the amount of space it has (front area can hold around 30 people, while the back room area can hold double that). And of course, its not just about its proximity from the Las Vegas Strip (5-7 minutes, depends how fast you are driving). 

For me, Grouchy John's is all about the spirit of its employees and patrons. This coffee shop is like one living, breathing organism that takes after its owner- one enthusiastic, professional yet sassy & pissed off mofo that wants to show you who's your daddy when it comes down to exceptional coffee & good quality customer service. And even if you don't even drink a coffee, you'll feel a pretty good vibe here that will make you want to stay here a while and spend a few dollars more. This is such a place!

Seeing Grouchy John himself (usually wearing a Brooklyn hat with a small scowl on his face) can be slightly intimidating at first, yet when you see how he takes care of his customers, you'll get an impression that he truly cares about you in addition to the brand. I tried a recommended iced coffee blend that was so strong that I took the first sip at 9 AM in the morning in Vegas, and the last sip at 9 PM in Denver, CO after driving all day completely amped up from the amount of caffeine. And all for a few bucks. Now if that's not good coffee, I don't know what it is!

John was helpful in answering any questions I had. ""What ingredients go in the smoothies?"" ""How sweet are the smoothies?"" ""Is the Chai Tea Latte less sweet?""

John handed us our drinks, along with two complimentary gummy candies. Who knew that small candies could make me so happy? I handed John $3.50 in hopes he would consider the $0.25 as a tip, but he returned the quarter back, saying we paid a quarter too much. That's an honest man!

Hidden away in a quiet neighborhood on Maryland off of Windmill, I would have zoomed past this gem without giving it a second thought if it weren't for my buddies' raving reviews. I like the fact that Grouchy John's has a drive-thru for those that are in a hurry. 

Small, quaint and homey is what I felt when walking in. There's a lot of books and board games so there's stuff to do if a cup o' joe won't cut it. Personally, I walked in with a mind set of getting some work done. And that, I did. 

They have your typical coffee drinks. And then they have their specialty drinks. I ordered the ARM (Almond Roca Mocha) with soy milk. YUM! They don't do the whole latte art thing here, just some good java in a simple paper cup. 

I was there for about an hour and a half and about halfway through my stay, a barista came around to check up on all of us and asked if we wanted a cup of water. Little things like that really make the difference between a regular coffee spot and an awesome one.

Once upon a time I was trying to get home and couldn't because there was traffic. So I decided to take an alternate route. As I was driving, I see the store coupled with ""Drive Thru"" and thought that I might as well give it a go. The interesting thing here is that on Mondays, they pick out a random specialty drink off their menu and make it half off. On this particular monday, they chose the ""Grouchy John Latte"" which comes with white chocolate and amaretto. Initially I was hesitant because I had never tried or heard of amaretto at that point but I decided why not. And well, what could I say, it was love at first sip! I pretty much drank the entire thing (I couldn't sleep that night, but it was worth it!). And ever since that day I've been going and trying out their stuff.

They change their flavors with the seasons and I'm a fan of their Christmas/holiday flavors. The only complaint is that when I do opt for a hot drink, most of the time it comes out too hot and burns the integrity of the milk (yes there is such a thing). I can't complain because it seems like Sambalatte is the only coffee shop in town who has gotten the milk temperature right, but I digress.

Had bookmarked this place before my trip to Vegas and was glad I did!

When I used to live in Vegas years ago, I always felt there was an absolute lack of coffee shops. 

This time around, there is a actually a variety of shops open in the area.  

When we walked in, it was empty. The staff (and I believe one of the owners) immediately greeted us with a warm smile and a cheery ""Good Morning."". These may be simple things to do but I have been to many a shop where this is not the norm!

I had already made up my mind that I wanted one the grouchy cookies but the owner pointed out that they also have a variety of doughnut's (SCORE!) from KD's doughnuts (a place I had also bookmarked).

He recommended the blueberry doughnut which I also I got. My lil bro went with a chocolate glazed doughnut. I chose the Grouchy latte which was white chocolate and almond syrup. 

The blueberry doughnut was an amazing surprise!  It was moist and delicious and went perfectly with my drink. My brother enjoyed his doughnut and polished it off before I even noticed. 

Not only do they have quality products here and friendly staff but they also do some other awesome stuff.  They had an area dedicated do donated items for kids in need of back to school supplies. And let me tell you, it was packed full of items. How awesome is that???

They also have a book/library program. The owner saw me eyeing the books and explained that I was welcome to take it and bring it back whenever I was done. He also said that I can do a book swap where in I could bring books from home and take some books I wanted. I almost wanted to cry because I DON'T LIVE HERE!

The place is fairly spacious and is an excellent place to study or just unwind. Of course, the free wiFi will also encourage you to make a trip. And you'll probably see Grouchy John himself behind the counter helping to make your drinks and asking you how things are going.

I started my Monday morning off by ordering a Caffe Latte for myself and a regular coffee for a co-worker, whom I excitedly dragged with me to the truck. I ordered my Caffe Latte without any sweeteners or other flavorings, and I enjoyed the little jolts with each sip I took and all the frothiness that settled around the inside of my cup (mmm!).  My co-worker said the coffee wasn't bad, but hands down did he prefer Grouchy's over the brew in our office. 

After confessing to the cool guys who were manning the truck that I've been waiting for their arrival ever since the previous week (sound stalker enough?), and that I've never tried Grouchy John's Coffee, they gave me two stamp cards and stamped one card full with happy face stamps! 

Aside from the fantastic service, the caffeine buzzes, and stamp cards(!), I must note that I also enjoyed seeing a small Darth Vader figurine by the tip jar (the truck's ""guardian"" as I was told), as well as a few items on their menu with titles inspired by characters from Star Wars -- this created a stir of excitement among some of the predominantly IT employees who were present, including myself. I'll have to stalk the truck again to try those Star Wars titled beverages next time and write an update on this review.

Luckily, the original location of Grouchy John's is close by. I'm a fan of the Star Wars motif and love all the local art that adorns the walls.

Their blended drinks are great, but I don't want to know how much sugar is in them. The Jedi (white chocolate, coconut) and Chewbacca (Trader Joe's cookie butter and dark chocolate sauce) ones have been my favorite so far. For less sweet options the bulletproof coffee (fresh-brewed coffee blended with MCT oil and grass-fed organic ghee) or the nitro cold brew are great options.

The place has stuff for non-coffee drinkers, too. My kid loves their strawberry smoothie and the suicide smoothie (strawberry, mango, peach) is my go-to order when I want something non-caffeinated. 

If you need something to eat they've got a case full of bagels, muffins and pastries. Most are decent, if not spectacular.

It's a shame that they don't have locations around town, but they do have a truck that pops up different places. The truck can usually be found on Sundays in the church parking lot at Lone Mountain and Jones. The stamp card they give you works at the location on Maryland Pkwy as well the truck wherever it should roam. I will make a point to stop at this location when I am on this side of town from now on, but most likely I'd visit the truck on Sundays since it's closer to where I live. 

There isn't a grouchy vibe inside, it's a happy one! This is a place that is kid friendly and they have a variety of board games and stuff to do while you enjoy your drink. I was even given some Starburst to snack on while I waited for my order and this happened inside as well the time ordered in the drive-thru, cute! 

On the menu I saw several tasty looking drinks. I've had both hot and iced drinks and really enjoyed them. The ""Grouchy John"" is white chocolate and amaretto. I would suggest trying that your first time or you could go funky with the ""Curious George"" that's banana and honey. They have a little something for everyone here flavor-wise and prices range from about $2 -5 each drink though some of the all natural smoothies and a couple other drinks are a smidge more. Sizes are 12, 16 and 20 oz. 

 They also have smoothies, muffins, donuts, bagels and oatmeal on the menu. I was told by the girl who helped me that the donuts were brought in from Carl's. I know Carl's has a following, but I personally find those donuts to be overpriced and just average tasting. These are the same brand donuts that you find in most 7-11 and other convenient stores and markets around town since Carl's Donuts has deals with several places to sell their donuts. It would be nice if they got them from a mom and pop place since we do have a few really good donuts places, but it is what it is.

On to the coffee, they are DELICIOUS!  You can order the drink hot, iced, or blended.  I had the Grouchy John hot and blended on two different occasions and they both are yummy.  I love the amaretto flavor in this cup of goodness.  I must say though that the hot tasted sweeter than the blended.  Either version, they were still yummy in my tummy with the right amount of caffeine and sugar kick.  I have also had the Almond Roca latte blended and it was very balanced.  Not too sweet...just right.  We also picked up the best cheese danish I have ever tasted, which is baked by Bread n Butter.  Oh boy, even someone on a Paleo diet must cheat once in a while to taste this melt in your mouth cheese danish with a crispy flaky tart shell.  Oh so good..

I also love the concept of dropping $2 in the bucket, fill up a cup with hot coffee, and leave.  I noticed this on the first morning I visited this coffee shop.

My most favorite part about Grouchy John's is the type of crowd it brings in.  There's a wide range of people that I've noticed coming in mid day during my lunch breaks; from elementary school kids to work professionals, to newspaper reading elders, and everything in between.

This has got to be one of the coolest looking  coffee shops simply  because they got Star Wars stuff inside!
Perusing the menu, they even got items named after Star Wars  characters. Can you say SUH-WEET!?!?

It was pretty packed when we got  there, but  after searching high and low,  we got a little table right below the  AT-AT. Continuing the Star Wars theme,
I ordered a Jedi which was pretty good, but flavor wise seemed to be missing something. Service was great though...Oh, and the artwork on the walls and expansion through the hallway were cool too!

3617598,2011-10-29,7,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"Thank the coffee lords for Grouchy John's. These guys always seems to be conveniently located at Vegas events or 0.1 mile away from my house on Fridays. GJ coffee is always tasty or potent enough where I can enjoy the nourishment of the beans, not just water, some sweetener, and blackness. I would say prices are fairly reasonable for getting coffee that has care and... love lol. My favorite is the signature Grouchy John's Frappe which is white chocolate and amaretto flavoring, now if I could only convince them to give me real amaretto :). 

Other notes:

- The guys are nice, friendly, and probably care about their job a whole lot more than your barista at Starbucks. 

- Drinks come out fairly quick and efficiently, don't think I've ever waited more than 5 minutes for a drink. 

- You can text order drinks ahead of time at (702) 608 - 5195

- You only need 5 stamps for their stamp card!

- Sometimes they do contest on twitter (@Grouchyjohns) for free drinks. Even I won once. 

Creepy note:

I had a dream weeks ago that Grouchy John landed into heart of UNLV and grew its roots into the core of UNLV's soil making it a permanent resident nullifying the need for Starbucks, Coffee Bean, and Einstein's... sadly it probably won't happen. Thus I will have to continue chasing Grouchy's around when I want some tasty coffee.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,5,5,5,TCYWDzos5VXdgf6aa0aUow
3618244,2014-12-15,6,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"When traveling, we are always on the lookout for local coffee shops that are not Starbucks. 

Things I like about Grouchy John's: Love the name, love the fact that they're not a corporate chain. The employees are friendly and appear to enjoy their job.

What I didn't like was the coffee that we ordered and the lack of seating. My babygirl's soy latte was piping HOT! Almost as hot as my Americano. The flavor wasn't bad, although temperature control would be a useful lesson around here. My Americano on the other hand was good and well made. I would order that again in a heartbeat. 

As for the seating, there was a good amount, but they were busy. Can't blame a place for being popular. There are a few outside tables but who wants to drink coffee in the desert heat?

The interior appears to be a redecorated Starbucks. With lots of reading material on the shelves, it has that local coffee shop flair. They have a drive-thru window which furthers the former S'bux impression.

I applaud them for not being just another chain, however their drink menu is pretty much similar with a host of sugary frapps and just barely considered coffee drinks. No V3gan pastries on display either. So it's basically the same thing to me. The reason Starbucks is successful is consistency. I can get a tall soy latte from any ol' S'bux and it'll taste pretty much similar no matter where I am. 

If I were local to Vegas, I would consider visiting here more often. Perhaps it would grow on me. Then again, Sunrise Coffee is vastly superior in ever facet, so I doubt even the frequent buyer punch card offered here would lure me back for more.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,8,7,3,5vb62LpRezEj2Mkae_mtqg

I work one of my jobs from home, so having the opportunity to get out of my bed that has my body permanently imprinted in it from laying in it with my laptop within typing range is perfect.

Most recently I went at like 8am on a Sunday. I try to avoid going all the way back out to my house whenever possible, so I had a couple hours to kill between an airport run and a yoga class. I was a wee bit hungry so I bought something called ""ManBakes"" which I guess are a local product with a really unfortunate name. ManBakes sounds disgusting, and not just in an anatomical sense, but also in a sexist sense. MANBAKES? Come on. Gross. Whatever though, that's not the task at hand.

What's awesome about this place is that when you're inside, you forget that it's perma-summer. I come from a land of four seasons, and this ""Hades April-September"" and ""Light Autumn September-April""  business of Vegas doesn't quite do it for me, but I feel like when I'm in Grouchy J's I could look up from my computer and see snow falling on the ground, or blossoms forming on trees, or something whatever.

My first impression when I got to this cafe was the atmosphere. It felt like I was in a game room at friends house or an attic that was converted to a cafe. The cool thing about my visit was the friendly and helpful baristas. I was thinking they were going to be a group of Grouchy Baristas that hate their job, lol. However, it was the complete opposite and was a pleasant experience.

Onto the coffee drinks, I got the Honey Latte and it was surprisingly good. It had Vanilla extract and Honey mixture that paired well with the espresso shots and milk over iced. I got the chance to try out the Mint Mocha and that was okay. I do like that this independant coffee shop has a good amount of seating and divided into 2 sections. The main room has sofas and tables kind of seperated in sections with local artwork, game boards and reading materials throughout the café. The other room is more like a bright classroom/conference are for group studys and meetings. So your bound to find a large portion of students thoughout this café. A great place to grab a coffee and hangout or study.

There were times when my drink would be undrinkable halfway through because its just too icey and I'm left trying to stir the ice with the super cheap straws that bend and break easily.

First of all, the coffee.  It's a solid, quality offering...drip coffee...nothing fussy, and not expensive.  I quite enjoyed the Brasilian blend.  It's the type of coffee that there's no need to put sugar in (I definitely sugar my Starbucks).  My friend Marc, however, choose to order one of the fru-fru latte drinks which included some sort of ""monkey"" thing with bananas.  They were tasty, although that's not really my coffee preference.

They had a nice assortment of sweets and pastries.  I had a bagel they'd bought from some local bagelry (I'm going to make that a noun).  

What really is cool though is that the staff are all incredibly friendly and welcoming.  The other neat thing is that they have a ton of games for play by customers just sitting around.  Seems like it would be a neat place to hang out.  Bonuses include Wi-Fi, a drive through, lots of power strips, and a free drink loyalty card.

I'm literally here every Saturday (much quieter than Starbucks on Eastern + more space)

They still kept up their old principles such as 
-HALF off MONDAYS 
-Free starburst with purchase
-Caffeine art events
-Employees asking each customer for water (LOVE THAT)
-Stamp card!

New principles:
-HALF off tea + coffee after I think 5pm on weekdays (don't quote me on the time, I think it's 5!)
-More art work is hung up on the walls
-OPEN until 9pm!! I think opening an hour later will support lots of college students & their late night studying habits 

FAV DRINKS:
-Shirley temple of doom
-Butter beer latte
-Honey latte
-Dirty chai latte
BTW they can adjust your sweetness. I read that a lot of people don't like how sweet it is, so I suggest to ask for LESS or HALF sweeten. They're more than happy to do it 

Fun fact: I use to come here when I was in high school and now I'm about to graduate with my BS in 1 semester. I thank grouchy johns for providing me such an awesome place to just study & focus

After the gym, I skipped my regular coffee stop and went to the NCI.  There was John in the curve of the one building with the unit.  I got an iced quad espresso and two pastries--a cheese danish and a blueberry muffin.

The coffee and the cheese danish were great.  I'll keep checking the website to see when the unit will be in my area again.  It was good to see John again--with a smile and not grouchy!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,1,5,QRkB_OU4truG_Sc3ozZYew

Grouchy johns has mastered what every local coffeeshop aims to be in all areas of: consistently good and knowledgable customer service, a certain level of local collaboration (their business card area is always filled to the brim with interesting local businesses and startups, they have a full library of local literature like the Sunday, Vegas weekly and seven; the books in their library also appear to be comprised of a lot of donated good reads; thank you notes from local businesses and or from regulars can be found pinned up here and there, the art on the wall featured by local artists etc) that makes it feel like a genuine local spot that locals have indirectly or not helped to create, and they have a good handle on making a good cup of espresso that doesn't need to be masked by all the flavorings and whipped cream in order to hide their lack of skill and attention to detail like some other establishments (cough cough ahem starbucks cough lol).
This place simply must be experienced in order to understand the ""hype"" and well deserved high praise.
My recommedation/tip to spice things up?: ordering any of their specialty coffee lattes (rushmore, honey boo boo, the sith, etc) iced, breve with 1/4 of the usual sweetness. Of the holiday seasonal drinks, doing the above with their pumpkin spice latte was absolutely superb.  might seem a little finicky/nitpicky but it makes the world of a difference ;)",tQRquQ0TRMzs8B_I4AxxmQ,5,1,5,BiKkmk_gvv2h-aoyWpIiSg

I got Christmas in a cup it was a gingerbread white mocha latte.

It changed my life.

I literally raved about it to everyone it was PERFECT! The perfect sweet treat on a cold night. Not too sweet and just enough ""coffee"" flavor.

Doesn't it just sound delicious? 

I tried to order the drink at Starbucks and it just wasn't the same. Since this is one of their signature drinks I just figure they spent time on finding the perfect gingerbread vs white mocha flavors.

Also my friend got one of their monkey drinks. Banana with Nutella maybe? I don't remember but it was delicious also.

Why do I love Grouchy John's? I'll break it down in list format:

-I adore how I walk in and am greeted by name. 
-I am a big fan of the promotions they offer, like their punch card (double stamps for checking in on social media), free birthday drink and on Mondays one specialty drink is 50% off. 
-I am thankful I can tell the barista I am undecided on what to order and get a great recommendation.
-I appreciate that Grouchy John's is active in our community and hosts donation drives and other events. 
-I enjoy that I can view the artwork by local artists while I wait for my order.

I have passed Grouchy John's just about every Mon-Fri on my way from the office to the gym and never really gave it thought till today and my Yelp check for a nearby place ran me here because of the reviews. 

And now i too have become a fan. I type this from one of the very comfortable couches that fills the interior and makes you feel very comfortable to chill out, work, or converse with friends over a good cup of Joe. The interior is a little funky but friendly with a wall full of books, unique art, and a Star Wars toys wut! The staff is uber friendly and welcoming when i entered. I mentioned my usual order at CBTL and asked if they could do something similar which is just a coffee with chocolate powder and they did it here with syrup (no charge) and it was perfect. I cant say that the coffee is anything any more spectacular than what i have had at other locations around town but i can say that i like the feel of the layout, the comfort of being able to sit and not be bothered to GTFO anytime soon, and of course the WiFi allows me to do my work my work.Service goes a long way with me, and friendliness never hurt anybody so i will certainly be spending my money here again when i want to venture out of my cave (office) and people watch while having a cup. 

Note... they had a picture of a damn bowl of oatmeal i will have to check out next time in here for only a couple of bucks. If it wasn't taco Tuesday and id feel id ruin my appetite i would have done that for sure cause i sure looked tasty. 

Also i had a young lady sit next to me the entire time i was here and just came in for the free WiFi, never bought a thing. Im sure your simply trying to be nice but i think a password or code for the WiFi would be a good idea so you dont have people doing this constantly. I always make sure i have something while im in a business like this because they are providing me a service so the least i can do is spend my money for what their offering...its only fair.",LvLaYXjvzdrPDXC3Zv3XoA,0,0,4,jvAtAOqPJlumWzpBoOMxGA

Their blended PBM is my absolute favorite because it's the perfect combination of coffee, chocolate, peanut butter, and of course, bananas! Plus, I can't help but love the nerdy spin they added to their menu by naming drinks after iconic characters such as Chewbacca, Yoda, and even the adorable Curious George!

4265701,2016-02-17,0,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"4 Stars - Solid coffee, mostly consistent, and when inconsistent, they will remake it for you no questions asked.  If you like flavored coffees, this is definitely the place for you.  For me, however, I generally ask for 1/2 the normal flavor additives, because I find it overpowering otherwise.  If you want pure latte or regular coffee, they are quite solid.
5 Stars - The staff.  Yes, they're a mixed bag.  But in the end, they are always friendly, always helpful, and always willing to do whatever it takes to make you satisfied with your drink.  I was amused and pleased to note that after just a couple times there, many of the staff already know my name.
4.5 Stars - the Atmosphere.  It's great for when you're feeling silly, want to have a convo with a friend, or just indulge your sweet tooth.  The back seating area could be greatly improved on (thus the minus .5 star), because it has a cafeteria feeling and isn't as kitchy or funky as the main area.

Recommendations - 
Honey Boo Boo, seriously, it's as good as it sounds bad.  Or maybe it's just that secret guilty pleasure.
Sith - because why have mocha when you can taste the dark side?
Chupacabra - because we sometimes need a bit of spice in our lives.
Iced Latte - because let's face it, sometimes a good cup of iced coffee is all you want, and they do it good here.

Avoid -
Bulletproof coffee.  Whoever invented this should have their tongue examined.  It's NOT good...  As in, imagine coffee were turned into a health food/coffee syrup.  It's what I imagine castor oil would taste like.  So uh..

I visited Grouchy John this morning while he was parked in front of Slidin Thru HQ. At the truck with John was JJ, the author of Bloodsucking Vegas. I thought he looked familiar. With today's secret word, I was able to get a Caramel Mocha Latte and a Chai Tea Latte. Double fisted gourmet coffee FTW! I don't get coffee often, so it was a good way to sample the grouchy man's menu. I thoroughly enjoyed the Caramel Mocha. It was uber-sweet and would satisfy any sweet tooth. On the flip side, the Chai was much milder.

Like I said, I don't get a lot of coffee. To me, there is simply good and bad coffee. On that simple pass-fail scale, Grouchy John's certainly serves up some good cups of Joe. At $3 for the Chai Tea and $3.50 for the Caramel Mocha (both 12oz cups), the prices are on the upper end. Still, I'm a fan. In the increasingly crowded Vegas street vendor scene, I hope he does well.

1. The staff is great. Very friendly and patient
2. The atmosphere is very relaxing. I enjoyed looking at the artwork on the walls.
3. They have more to do than just drink coffee. Books, games any all the goodies mentioned in other reviews.

What I did not really like was the coffee. Very...very sweet. Infact, it was way to sweet for me and I love sweets. I went with a friend and she too agreed that the coffee drink was too sweet. They use syrups to flavor the coffees and it takes away from the real coffee flavor. Perhaps we made the wrong choices and should have tried something else.

Not sure if I or we will go back. It's a nice change from boring old Starbucks, but the coffee is just not there.

Please note: I am not a big fan of Starbucks. I prefer coffee bean but the store by me has really gone down hill, amongst other issues. That's another reason I tried this place.",ZtSzW0n2gSqWRAmQ_stkXQ,1,0,4,gTiKOITyJ13bdd57_Bad1g

4655249,2013-01-09,11,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"After a hard day at work, Grouchy John's Coffee Shop makes me a joyful coffee drinker. It is one of a handful of coffee shops that I routinely patronize.

  Grouchy John's Coffee Shop is the antithesis of the corporate coffee shop. It has the personality and energy level of a downtown Las Vegas coffee shop. It is a slice of downtown Las Vegas in the southeast Las Vegas Valley. Outside the entrance is the iconic Grouchy John's coffee shop. This is an omen that the customer is in for a unique coffee shop experience. Inside the lobby resembles a student union with the touch of a living room. On the way to the counter, which is on the right, are numerous seating arrangements. There are the standard tables and chairs throughout the lobby. At the far left corner are plush chairs arranged around a small table. At the far window are bar seats that are popular with Internet users. Bookcases holding books share the space with the seats. Grouchy John's is more than coffee. It is also a library. In my opinion, the library is more of a decoration. From what I see, the majority of the customers are on-line reading digital material compliments of the free WiFi (myself included). The sight and smell of the books improve cozy vibe of the place.

  At the counter, the employees are friendly. They notice repeat customers, and make them feel welcome. They show their appreciation for repeat customers with a card that earns stamps toward a free beverage. Forget the card at home. They will not be grouchy. They will stamp another card which you can use with the other card toward a free refill. When I first started going here, they would visit my table to ask me if I needed a refill or a Starburst. So much for grouchy.

  My beverage of choice has been a cup of coffee with peanut butter syrup, This tastes like sipping melted Reeses Pieces with the advantages of caffeine. Today, I tried the Almond Roca Mocha Late. It tasted like a hot liquid desert beverage with the advantages of caffeine.

   If you decide to visit Grouchy John's Coffee Shop, please keep in mind a few things. On weekdays it closes at 8:00 PM., which in my book is way too early. High quality coffee based beverages are delicious on the taste buds whereas they are poison on the breath. I highly recommend bringing breath mints. And most of all, do not expect to leave grouchy.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,17,16,4,fXcTzDERpqWjxSdrBfyG0A
4658053,2015-09-11,4,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"I'm not really a coffee drinker, but ""getting coffee"" is something to do when meeting up with friends, so I oblige. Starbucks is boring, so we decided to try Grouchy John's because a friend is addicted to this place and highly recommended it.

I originally asked for a Strawberry/Banana Smoothie, but the guy at the register suggested I try the Suicide Smoothie instead. I went with his recommendation. The drink was good, but nothing special. I'd rather have Jamba Juice to be honest. Maybe I messed up by ordering a smoothie at a coffee shop, so I'll venture into the coffee items next time I'm here.

Rather than the drinks, the highlight was the atmosphere. The place is fairly quiet, but not stale like a library. It does have an artsy feel. Not in a skinny jeans and PBR hipster type of way though. Nerdy and comfy would be the best way to describe it. This gives it the character that's lacking at the chain coffee shops.

Our first time was through the drive-thru. The drive-thru menu was very easy to read but so hard to decide because of their great coffee variety & choices! Most drinks can be either hot, iced, or blended so whatever your mood, they've got you covered! I ordered an iced dirty chai with soy milk & my better half got a blended vanilla frappe. Like I said, we went back a second day in a row so the drinks were obviously the bomb to both of us!

Today's beverage choices were a tad different & equally delightful! I tried the 'Butter-Me-Up' frappe because it had been recommended to me by the girl at the drive-thru when we were waiting for our beverages the day before! Her recommendation was phenomenal especially if you're a cookie butter fan! My lover got the blended vanilla frappe but this time with an added espresso shot! We also got a vanilla shake for our little one & a caramel frappe for the mother-in-law... all of which were incredibly incomparable to any other coffee drinks around!

Their espresso taste is so rich, smooth & creamy that it's flavor is what's so desirable about this place! Not to mention, the inside of this shop is too stinkin' cute! I was in awe once we walked in on day two to see so much creative color, Star Wars & all around good vibes! A huge plus for me is that they have a stamp card! Each drink gets you a stamp & ten stamps gets you a free drink! The greater value of this incentive is if you check into Grouchy John's then you earn two stamps per drink! Pretty sweet deal if you ask me! If I would've been offered a stamp card the first time around & knew to check in on the second day then I'd already have a free beverage for tomorrow! (So definitely not hard to fill up a card & enjoy a coffee on them!)

Overall, this will definitely be our newest chill & drink spot & I can't wait to drink our way through their menu! Mahalo Grouchy John's!",gTPi6fH_7ElEa5ucojigcQ,1,0,5,1LkKC9ARmKQChveghLzsVg

The girl who took my order was very knowledgeable and helpful in making a recommendation. I got the cold brewed coffee, iced, to-go, and the girl mentioned I can can a refill too. That's good to know. Even though I got a small, it was plenty strong so didn't get a refill on my way out. Coffee was smooth and tasty.

Menu:
They have a large selection to choose from. Lattes, teas, and smoothies, as well as some snack options like bagels and donuts (Pink Box!!). My personal favorite is their nitro cold brew. It's so smooth that I can drink it black. If I want some sweetness, an iced cold brew with a pump of flavor (hazelnut!!) and almond milk is great, too. Sencha when I'm feeling some tea~

We ended up playing backgammon and chess but they must've had about 50 other games to pick from. There weren't any pieces missing and we had a grand ole' time playing and conversing.

And while it is still my go to and this is my first visit to Grouchy John's and he will have some making up to do, I have to say I was pretty blown away by the coffee and service!!
   I was unsure of what to order. So many choices and combinations to choose from! ( they have their fav's- grouchy John, o.g., a.r.m., all of which get phenom reviews). But I decided on the butter-me-up, made with trader joe's cookie butter. Now I just have to say this is one of my favorite guilty pleasures on earth, but to find it put into an addiction of mine (lets just be honest here!)... Coffee??? SOLD!!!!  And the verdict is..... Delightful!! It wasn't too sweet, which I was worried about. I ordered it with whole milk but it didn't feel heavy at all. It was delish and I wish I had ordered the larger size!!
   The service was great. There were a couple people behind the counter and a gentleman that walked around making sure everyone was happy. I assumed the owner and later asked and was correct! He asked twice if I had tasted my coffee yet and to let him know if I liked it and checked on me several times as I sat and enjoyed the vibe. The barista (girl with dark hair) also asked me. It was very nice to have such great service.
   Now....On to the vibe of the joint. I really enjoyed it, but initially it threw me for this side of town I think. I seriously felt I was walking into a gamers room who is obsessed with star wars and may be out of town at a comic con convention. Very eclectic range of people hanging out, playing board games and on their computers.  Honestly,I could see this place downtown... but am more than thrilled that this piece of culturally diverseness found its way into my part of town!!! It's one of my biggest reasons for missing LA so much. Vegas lacks places like this!! I will be back!! Thanks Grouchy John....

After a few sips, I decided I was good.
The coffee was good, but a little too sweet for me. It was slightly salty as well, but not too overbearing. I think it was the cookie butter that gave it the sweet salty taste mixed with the almond milk, but who knows. Either way it was good and I was very impressed with the overall experience.

The coffee is amazing! They have a different menu then some places. I love the OMG because I love salted caramel but it also adds vanilla. I am a big coffee person.. or at least I like to consider myself a big coffee person. There are people who would disagree. They have a unique menu and I love it. Everything is made very well and the flavors are great. I like the ice blended items because they use like a certain ice that just has a different texture. I don't know if the makes sense, but there is no huge chucks of ice which I like. The ice blended items seem to be very smooth.

The flavor of the signature ""Grouchy John's"" is amaretto and vanilla I believe. It was a little too sweet for me. I like the OMG more but I think to each his own. I have a weird sense of the perfect sweet and too sweet though.

The quirky little decor of Star Wars, TWD and the books available to read makes this much more inviting than a Starbucks. It's like they want you to stay instead of just get your order and get outta here kinda feel.

I was very surprised when they offered to warm up the blueberry muffin I ordered (Yes it's summer in Vegas and I wanted something warm to go with the Yoda I ordered).

A couple of buddies of mine, The 80's Kids, told me about this amazing place on Maryland called Grouchy John's.  I has a lot of work to catch up on and thought this was the perfect opportunity to take advantage of this Yelping opportunity.  

I'm literally sitting in this joint writing this review.  It's located on the corner of Wigwam and Maryland Pkwy.  Brings back a few memories from when I used to live a couple of blocks away.  That was almost 6 years ago. You walk in and notice the vaulted ceilings, vibrant colors and eclectic artwork on the walls.  In fact, my buddies' artwork is displayed in this joint.  Walk by the orange back wall and you'll see the 80's Kids artwork.  In this joint, there are books of all kinds and a large screen TV. The staff is young and therefore, vibrant and hip!   I LOVE coffee shop vibes like this one.  Definitely an amazing place to hang out and do some work. 

For my drink I got the 12 oz. Non fat Hazelnut Latter for $4.  The Barista even created foam art for me!  It was a cute leaf on the top.  The drink was a little sweet but not overpowering.  I loved that the espresso used was a little bitter, really working with the hazelnut flavor.  Definitely a great cup to go along with my work.  

All in all, it's a great place to visit!  I love the nerdy, yet sophisticated vibe you get from this place.  I'm really starting to dig this type of ambiance when work is needed to get done on the weekend.  When I'm in this part of town again, I will certainly keep this place in mind.

5050203,2013-11-04,1,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"I've had Grouchys long long ago when it was just a little trailer, but haven't had it since. I am not much of a coffee person, not because I don't like it, but many of them make me feel sick. It's a crapshoot, I don't know why it happens. I just gotta go for milder brews and hope nothing happens.  Thankfully Grouchys brews doesn't give me the ill effects and the flavor of the coffee is quality . According to a friend their beans are from a local purveyor, but I gotta confirm who exactly. 

You can go inside and hang, but there is also a drive thru. Dont forget to check in for your extra stamps on your stamp card. If you're bringing coffee somewhere, ask for a stopper that seals in the drinking hole of the lid. 

I got a A.R.M. (Almond Roca Mocha) Latte hot with almond milk and it was rather good. It kinda reminds me of a biscotti in terms of flavor. The BF got the salted caramel with half sweet. It was good this way, you taste more of the coffee flavor with a tinge of flavoring than it being masked with sweet and flavoring. Mine was full sweet and was good that way too, it wasn't overtly saccharine. I suppose just depends on the mood if I'll order more or less sweetener. 

If coffee isn't your thing, they serve smoothies and tea based drinks and pastries too that are probably just as quality. I will try a non coffee drink one of these days, but it's just hard not to order coffee since I rarely get to drink it. 

Its definitely one of the best coffee shops in town and wish there was one in our area. This is one of those businesses that could be a local chain. Until then, I guess anytime were even in the vicinity, we have to make sure we add in a detour for a drink here.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,1,2,4,GyZV836HRpHk13x4cHpiww

As for their menu, they have a huge variety of drinks and food to choose from including smoothies, teas, classic/specialty coffees, pastries, and breakfast items. I had a hard time deciding what to get at first because everything looked and sounded good. I ended up ordering a hot mint mocha with non fat milk and I loved it. It had a hint of sweetness from the dark chocolate/mint and a perfect amount of bitterness from the coffee. My boyfriend ordered an iced honey with soy milk, which he liked, but not as much as me since he's not too fond of the bitterness taste from the coffee. Overall, it's definitely an excellent place to stop by and get quality coffee and great customer service.

The staff is nice and they usually deliver your food to you (drinks are set up on the bar). They were patient with me, being my first time there, telling me about the menu and what sort of combinations you could order. There is certainly plenty to choose from!
The coffee is great. I ordered the Butter Beer latte, and also tried the Sith latte. Both were major sugar bombs and delicious. They have a large selection of names that will have you cracking up, from ""Honey Booboo"" to ""Shirley Temple of DOOM"". They all sound delicious and can't wait to try more.
I also had the Apple Fritter and Bearclaw pastries. They were warmed upon request and were gooey and awesome! I don't know where they get their pastries from but it's definitely a new favorite in my book.

About 20 of us gathered together for a charity craft project at Grouchy John's on Monday morning. We were welcomed by the staff & had plenty of room in the back room to work on our project. 

I'm not a coffee drinker & had never been here, but now that I've seen how bustling this place is I'll return if I ever need a people fix. I did order an iced tea. They asked me what kind but I don't know a thing about tea-I thought iced tea was iced tea. I don't know good from bad. But they treated me with respect & I appreciate that.

This place consists of 2 large rooms with a few cubby holes if you're looking for a bit of privacy. There's lots of unique & fun art by local artists for sale on the walls, there's a shelf of games to play & books to read are scattered about. Grouchy John's is so inviting & there are lots of things to keep a conversation going. (This is a great place to meet a blind/online date, a few of which I witnessed while I was there. Good luck, folks.)

I had eaten just before I arrived but next time I'll try some of the food there. Lots of pastries, cookies, bagels & wraps in the display case & on the menu.

Walking into here you're immediately greeted with some cool art and toys. The layout of the place is perfect too! At every couch or chair they have an outlet ready for you to use! Just go order at the counter and pick a table. And while you wait or drink your coffee they also have books and board games. A major plus in my book.

I'd also like to note that this places thrives on customer service. Every person that has taken my order has been more than helpful in choosing what I drink. They always have a smile and if there was anything wrong with my drink the would change it for free!!

As for prep time the coffee always comes out quickly. For the taste of the coffee, I've never had a bad tasting coffee here. And if you were bored of a flavor here they always come up with new flavors!

Pro tip! They have some fast and easy to use wifi! I also like how this place always greets you as you come in and gives a goodbye when you leave.

There are board games and other miscellaneous games to play so you should never get bored, and they have a cool mural on the very back wall, which artsy people would probably appreciate. The customer service is usually pretty good--they're always friendly. I've talked to one of the owners a few times and he's pretty cool. 

My favorite drink from here is a large hot caramel macchiato with whole milk, half sweet with no foam. Regarding this drink: most of the time it is made properly. Sometimes it's bitter, which I've learned from my Starbucks experience is usually due to the amount of time it took to make the shots of espresso. I'm not usually a complainer, but one time I said something about it being bitter and I even mentioned the fact that I get the drink every day, yet the guy told me it's because I get it half sweet. Well, I tried not to be rude in return so I just asked if they can remake it after they offered to just add more sweetener. They remade it but I felt like it was also sweeter so I gave up trying. Like I said, they're always friendly, but maybe they're not all experienced in making good espresso? I don't know...

Last month, I found myself 2 minutes away from Grouchy John's before a dance workshop, and in desperate need of caffeine.  

I popped in and got one of my old standards:  The Blended Grouchy John.  
Let me tell you, the quality of the drinks and the standard of service have remained the same:  Absolutely excellent.  

I've been in a handful of other times since then, most recently being over the weekend where I tried my first pour over at this shop. 

Well.

I have found my new favorite.  
The pour over...I mean...I seriously don't get HOW it is SO different from drip coffee and french press, but....this is the first coffee I've been able to drink with no sugar.

Friendly and efficient with a staff of baristas happy to engage the customer in banter about the myriad coffee concoctions or the day's events while satellite radio plays overhead and local art decorates the walls it was with some discussion that I eventually settled on ""The Jedi,"" and although generally a double espresso or Americano sort I have to admit the flavor profile and mouthfeel were perfect while sweetness was not overdone, a sometimes-lost art that I appreciate for allowing the quality of the beans to show.

I've had this place bookmarked on Yelp for far too long. I felt like a kid on my way to the candy store driving to GJ's. I walked in, was greeted with several hellos and a sea of MacBooks. There's a bookshelf with books, magazines, and board games. The walls were decorated with local art (which is available for purchase). There's also ample seating and free wi-fi; what more do you need in a coffee shop?

Stating that this was my maiden voyage to the shop, I got the full run down on their coffees, teas, sandwiches, wraps, snacks and treats. She also said that ANY time you check-in on social media, you get double stamps (10 stamps, free drink). 

I decided to get a GJ special called the Honey Boo Boo - a combination of honey and vanilla. My card was swiped, the register screen swiveled towards me, there was an option to leave a tip (THANK YOU, I was sans cash), and was handed my receipt, a GJ stamp card, and pink Starburst. I've never thought of honey and coffee being friends (I was a barista for 5 years during college).  This combination was amazing. Perfectly balanced, sweet, and a totally new coffee experience and taste! My latte also arrived with the quickness and I was on my way back to the West side.

Well done, Grouchy John's. I don't understand why you're a grumpy gills when you're serving out pure bliss! Can't wait to go back!",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,7,5,5,zN9-Nnu7buSNapEbPVMt3Q

4.5 stars would be more accurate here. The menu has something for all preferences and tastes, the store is playful & fun, and the service is top notch.

Continuing my LV independent coffee shop adventure, my husband and I headed to Grouchy John's Saturday morning. 

Everything about this place was ""just right"". The store feels modern & contemporary but also relaxed and unpretentious. The menu was large but not overwhelming. Plus there are coffee & non-coffee confections that would make Willy Wonka blush! My husband had the Grouchy John Latte which combined white chocolate & amaretto. Grouchy John himself  (i think) helped me out with my selection. He picked an off menu item called Serenity... white chocolate, peppermint and topped with whip cream & caramel (i skipped out on the toppings though - didn't want a cavity before breakfast). My husband also tried their blueberry muffin, banana nut muffin, and a glazed donut (seriously, he did) and he absolutely loved every bite (blueberry was his favorite).

Other than the good coffee, I feel the most notable part of my experience was I felt like I was in a friend's living room. Yes other places also have books and boardgames, but the vibe here definitely felt very home-y. That's quite a feat for first-timers.

I wish I lived closer but I'm already planning a trip back with friends next weekend for another round of Sopranos Trivia (I rule).",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,2,1,4,L1KRpEowSqQpVZLjY5YU7Q

I've been meaning to try out Grouchy John's because of the high ratings and praising reviews. Plus, it's really close to my house. So one morning, before work, I decided to swing by the drive through and get myself a cup of coffee. I opted for a soy latte, no flavor. 

Bonus: if you check in on Yelp, they give you an extra stamp on your loyalty card, which is really nice. It definitely encourages people to come back. More you visit, more stamps you get, which gets you closer and closer to that free drink! 

The employee that helped me was very nice and informative since it was my first time. 

As for the latte, I couldn't even finish it. The coffee beans that they used produces acidic coffee. It was sour in my mouth. It made me wish I asked for regular milk because it might have covered the acidity better than the soy.

They have a small-ish private parking lot and a drive-thru for those of you who don't want to get out of your car or for those commuters trying to satisfy their coffee fix on the go. 

Let's talk about ambience. It's not really a coffee shop worth going into if the interior isn't cool-looking. Grouchy John's paint was bright, fun, and made you want to look at what's painted on the walls closely. The wall decorations were super cool looking, too (with a bunch of Star Wars-related things for all you George Lucas fanatics)!

The staff was friendly. After my cousin and I were staring at the menu for a while, they told us they had a specialties menu just in front of the register (which is cool because it's less thinking for me -- I just have to pick the drink that sounds like it'll taste good LOL).

I ended up picking the ""Serenity."" It's advertised as: white chocolate, peppermint, whipped cream, and caramel drizzle. You could also get it served hot, iced, or blended. OH! And if you don't think they give you enough options already, they throw the ""what kind of milk?"" option at you. I looked at her kinda surprised at first because they usually never ask me that at coffee shops (I'm not really picky, either), but as she went on listing the types of milk I just had to go with the almond milk. BIG plus for having almond milk, by the way.

Anyway, the Serenity with the almond milk hit the spot! The name for the drink really did it justice because I was less grouchy after a couple sips. It was smooth. It had a very rich, creamy taste that only was complimented with the nutty almond-y goodness. The peppermint gave it a little bit of a zing. You know, like the coolness you get in your mouth after eating a peppermint patty. I feel like this drink will be the best drink for cold weather. It's definitely more of a winter holiday drink, but it's still pretty amazing anytime of the year!

All the employees warmly greeted us and helped us along the way in making our decisions. I strayed away from my usual Americano and went with a specialty coffee. I got the A.R.M frappe. This blended drink is a mixture of almond roca and mocha flavorings. It is possible to make certain drinks sugar free and that was how I got mine. My friend got the Grouchy John special and it was too sweet for my taste. White chocolate and amaretto is a rich combination, but I would ask for the syrups to be cut down.

(At Starbucks it's hit or miss when I order fat fee and sugar free. I've paid 5 dollars for a not so great or even drinkable coffee.)

2. They were super friendly and help full. When my drink was ready they even asked me if I loved it, and if not they will remake it. Super nice and thoughtful!!

3.I liked it in there. It was inviting and clean. They had board games as well. My 6 year old's school is right around the corner so it is helpful if we had time to kill in the neighborhood.

I was considering giving it 4 stars instead of 5 just because they were out of 2 things I wanted to order.

I didn't even need to stop at their ""condiment station"" and ""fix"" my coffee.

I love a good cup of Joe once in a while. On my way to my hotel, ""The Mirage,"" I decided to stop by Grouchy John's Coffee Shop since I was in the area and I heard a lot of good feedback from my fellow Yelp buddies. So, I used the GPS on my cell and viola, it was only 7 minutes away from where I was. Walking inside the Coffee Shop, there was a Grouchy John mobile with Vegas news anchors on the outside. 

Grouchy John's is not like Starbucks or Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. It has that Mom and Pop feel (Non Commercialized), that I appreciate and wish we had more around the city. The decor was very fun to look at and they offered games and have special events scheduled.

**Checking in on your Yelp = 2 Stamps on your Grouchy John Coffee Card**

I ordered the Chai Tea Latte and a large donut from JJ (Melon Head), he had excellent customer service and was willing to answer any questions since I was a first time customer. 
What surprised me was, they had a drive thru around and I didn't know until I saw a drive thru window by the register. Pretty neat in my opinion for a Mom and Pop Coffee Shop. JJ also threw in 3 starbursts while I waited for my coffee, that was a first for me. =) 

Overall, my latte tasted excellent and the donut was delicious. You can sit on the media bar and enjoy your coffee or whatever while looking at small parts of the Vegas strip. Grouchy John has won me a return customer and I can't wait to come back and buy me a G.J. Coffee Mug Collection.

Keeping up with the seasonal items we got a pumpkin cream cheese muffin. WOWZERS! This was delicious. I usually don't like pumpkin anything (except pie) but this was incredible. The cream cheese frosting was delicious and it was a nice snack to share with the wife - good size!

We sat outside in the cold - because, well we were tourists of course. They have a nice little setup with a table so you can sit outside. Super nice staff and overall a great place to grab a coffee. We meant to make it back before we left, but didn't have time unfortunatly. There's always next time!",2qKOL7C7WbG_M3EOWvTFxA,8,6,5,6Q8L3wiYbtHrF0NUwFe1_A

Most coffee shops in the area, including grouchy johns actually have signature lattes,  there happens to be a very tasty grouchy john latte (made of amaretto and white mocha) here that I discovered and enjoy very much!

The atmosphere here is very inviting, cozy and very easy going to hangout in for a while. They have board games to pass the time, tons of books, as well as comfy chairs to sit in for a while.

Then we were hit with the very wide variety of coffee and smoothie options, I am absolutely the most indecisive person on the planet, if your ever behind me in a drive thru I apolagize. I finally decided on the shirley temple of doom smoothie, this decision may have been made soley on the cool name. My friend got some iced latte and we shared a breakfast croissant sandwich. 

Now here is where my ""food karma"" kicked in! The customer ahead of us paid for our whole order! And only asked that we paid it forward! Which we happily did for the couple behind us.

Out at the inaugural Saturday Night Truckstop, and trying some new (to me) food truck yumminess, I needed something to wash it all down. It was hot, I was full, and I had absolutely no idea what I wanted.

Trying to help me decide, they asked me some questions. The technical bits went something like this:

""Do you like [flavor, flavor, flavor, sweet, savory, this, that, and the other; and what type of milk]?""

""Um, yes, yes, not really, no, not too sweet, um, sure, maybe, and nonfat, please?""

(Forgive the paraphrasing.)

What I ended up with was an iced, amaretto-flavored espresso drink (I even took the whipped cream) that I absolutely loved.

It's been two years since I first reviewed Grouchy John's and, back in 2013, I hadn't even been to the shop.  Since then, I've made several visits, many most recently.  I don't live near the shop, but it's worth the drive when I'm in the area.

CAFFEINE AND CANVAS nights with Tommy Vinci are what started me coming back to GJ's.  Just like the wine and paint places that you find around town, once a month local artist Tommy Vinci will teach you how to paint a scene of his choosing and make you feel like you know what you're doing.  $35 covers your art supplies (paint and canvas) plus any GJ's drink and pastry.  I've gone twice so far and it was a fun two hours each time.  I can't wait to go back when my schedule allows again.  Highly recommended for a night out with your friends.  Check the GJs Facebook page or Tommy Vinci's page to find out when the next class is and you can register online.

My favorite drinks are the HONEY LATTE and the YODA SMOOTHIE.  
I like the fact that I can have almond milk for the lattes and the Yoda Smoothie is a refreshing green (of course) drink made with kale, spinach, pineapple, strawberries, and mango.

CUSTOMER SERVICE is always friendly and the hours are nice for early mornings.  Yes, some people have to be up at the crack of dawn and coffee or tea can be a necessity.  GJ's opens at 5:00am, Monday through Friday, and 7:00am on the weekends.  Closing time all week is 8:00pm.  The atmosphere is always very relaxed and you can hang out on the couches or at a table enjoying your drink.  The staff has always checked on me to ensure that everything is to my liking.

STAMP CARDS:  Buy 10 drinks and the 11th is on the house.  If you use your Yelp app to check-in, you get an extra stamp.  

THEY GIVE BACK:  On their recent 3rd anniversary, GJ's collected donations for charity and had a blood mobile in the parking lot.  I went after work, donated blood, and there was free birthday cake available for customers.  Not to mention that I also received two free drinks in exchange for donating.  I love to support a business that in turn supports its community.

And lastly, GEOFF the resident gnome sits on the counter to greet everyone.  I love him because he is never in a bad mood and he treats everyone the same, whether they're grouchy or not.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,14,12,5,-Jnuj4d9ND2Y_tFSLgp1mQ

I got a ""Bulletproof Coffee""  which is a coffee loaded in fat due to MCT oil and grass-fed butter.  It was slippery and delicious!

I was meeting up with my Ex to talk about some things and this seemed like the perfect place to do so. Casual, not romantic in anyway (although I guess you could make romance anywhere), and on my way home. 

It's a funky place, and I like that. I love the decor and art work and the music was perfect, although I read and listened to my headphones until he arrived (late of course). I ordered a large dirty chai and it was quite tasty. I also got a bagel, which was good, except they don't give you enough cream cheese.

Initially when you walk into the shop, you'll notice that there is art work posted everywhere. From marvel characters to star wars, they have it posted on their wall! The front room has a few tables and a little library filled with books you can read. Don't worry if you can't find any tables in the front! There is a connecting rooms and in the back are more tables and a shelf filled with board games! 

When ordering, the workers are very helpful. They have speciality drinks and are willing to explain what they taste like. They have star wards themed drinks, like the Jedi (white chocolate, coconut) or the Sith (Dark chocolate, coconut). I don't know about you but I'm one who can't drink a lot of dairy. Not to worry though, they offer almond or soy milk substitutions. I ended up trying the Jedi and it was really good. It was a little too sweet for my liking but it tastes amazing! They also have a stamp card, so you can get a free drink. If you check in, I believe its one extra stamp?

I know they host painting classes in the backroom at 7ish sometimes and close 8, so keep that in mind if you're planning on doing some work or studying.

The chairs and couch in the front room near the counter were nice and comfy. The larger side room seemed more suitable for work or studying with more outlets, tables, chairs, good lighting, and separation from the front counter noise.

Our breakfast sandwich was tasty and filling (see photo). Our beverages were delicious and of far superior quality than that of large coffee chains. The drip coffee did not taste burnt and they had medium and light roast choices. They had several dairy alternatives from which to choose for those of us whose bodies reject cow excretions.

We have becoming regulars here at Grouchy John, at the Maryland location, (they also have a mobile location that I see at UNLV), we are so glad that we gave this place a try, and you should too.

The atmosphere of the place is very warm and cozy. There are a lot of local art works along the walls and they has a very warm, relaxing tone, so you can actually come here and knock out a few homework or studies here and there while enjoying a hot cup of coffee.

The quality of the coffee is very rich. You will notice how sweet the drinks are, so if you are the type of person that likes it on the bitter side, ask for less pumps of flavor. They have quite a few choices to choose from, each with it's own unique, creative, funny name, some related to monkeys, yodas, and john himself. They also offer a few pastries here and there, like the one I had, chocolate muffin, it was delicious. 

They offer a punch card for the regulars, in which they double stamp if you check in on yelp. 10 stamps gives you a free coffee. I urge you to give this place a shot and support your local small businesses!",ZvneWq5RacQdzAdci1LkHQ,1,1,5,JvcnjZ8YgtWq36GdDenbgg

What I enjoy the most is the atmosphere and free wifi! Perfect place to study, have a study group session in their giant room in the back, or even just study on your own on their little bar top. It gets pretty busy at peak times so expect to be studying with some noise in the background, otherwise bring a pair of headphones! The service is super friendly and they always greet you upon entry and exit. Definitely a place that I like to venture to when I want something other than my usual caffeine fix.",wxQCLMnuVYbdtmQCc2ryZg,5,2,4,xmOIS55w7RhZSA6Lb3DsBg
5918371,2015-01-21,6,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"Grouchy John's is my ideal coffee shop. I love that they are very active w/ their customers within the shop and also on FaceBook. They may have other social media outlets but I only follow them on FB. When your in the shop, staff will actually check on you to make sure your drinks and eats are to your liking or even if you'd like a glass of water. I personally haven't seen a counter service type place treat their customers this way. Which is what puts them ahead of the rest!
On FaceBook, they are funny to follow! From Geoff the gnome to Flag Salute guy and even encouraging baby Gracie. If they have a new drink coming out they will give you the details and ask for suggestions on a name. At Halloween time they have a vote for a costume for JJ to wear! 
Such a cool place!! I just wish it was on my route more often so I can support them more! :)",9z3W4AzWHFv_Ba5qE26WQw,13,13,5,p5UZJJ3h07WMHjszuA5sKA

5947382,2016-07-20,3,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"Awesome coffee shop that reminds me of San Francisco's Lower Haight area  -- well, one of the rooms. If you're looking to have a meeting, work remote or study, GJC is a great place. Free wifi and a ton of space.

The coffee prices are affordable. I paid $3.25 for a large iced coffee! The shakes, however, are a bit pricey for the quality and quantity. I ordered Matcha Green Tea shake and wasn't too excited about it. 

Normally, I'd take a star off, but the service at this place makes up for it. The owner is super casual and engaging with his customers. He comes by each and everyone's table to see if they want anything else or if they want a cup of water. Love this local feel they're going for -- it really adds a personal touch.

Overall, this place is pretty dope. They have a lot of artwork on the wall too, which gives this place a lot more personality,",VFr6lODPXmakSm4BFebKww,3,5,5,W59u0ZvEY6OhyXRwE2jZkA

5959862,2013-03-06,4,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"I'm not a coffee drinker or caffeine addict, but I do enjoy a nice tea from time to time. I have been a little under the weather lately due to a cold and while I was in the area running some errands, I stopped by Grouchy John's for a chai latte to ease my sore throat. 

I didn't go inside, but instead went through their drive thru. I'm always a fan of having a drive thru option since I'm usually in a hurry or just want a quick drink for my ride. I have driven by this location on many occasions and finally made a point to stop by. The guy taking my order was very helpful. I had a few questions about the menu and he helped clear up any confusion and decide on my order. Better yet, they didn't treat me like a moron for not knowing all the coffee lingo. By the time I drove up to the window my drink was ready and I was on my way. 

Definitely glad to utilize a locally-owned business for my chai tea needs. I'll definitely be back to check out some of their pastries and other drink options.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,11,9,5,D008e4O3ygm1kYRZ8KHZIA

Thankful that Grouchy John's was able to make great use of this space and make me love them too. JJ is very friendly, always running around making sure every customer is content. They host painting events, they have giveaways, they do silly things, and they know the importance of social media for business these days. Good drinks, good service, free wifi, a movie playing daily, huge book trade sections, games, and my favorite part: an outlet at every seat so people like me who waste hours in a coffee shop on a laptop can stay charged with coffee while our computers stay charged via power-cord!",2aaZq0UkoerFg_t1jxX4yA,1,0,4,KqJT9G39sJa9GJ5HehvnyQ

I just moved back to Vegas after living in Seattle for the past 4 years, and I was going through delicious coffee withdrawals. Starbucks and Coffee Bean were not cuttin it for me and this place was highly recommended to me so I decided to go.

I loved the decor and coziness of the shop. They have a TON of books and games I thought that was awesome. They had a pretty big menu with what looked like a rotating board of special drinks. I had a salted caramel latte and it was delish! Definitely up to Seattle standards and it satisfied my craving :) I will definitely be going back again and hanging out in the shop.",nrThbQwK6RWnX7RhEKQ-ug,5,2,5,e-gW1TdfqmBALKE7x2qcHw

Writing this review, finally, because the staff is patient and friendly when I ask my numerous questions on what is actually sugar-free. I'm diabetic so my drinks have to be ordered carefully.

I ordered the Sith which is dark chocolate and coconut. Both are sugar free. I subbed soy milk as well and made it decaf for drinking in the afternoon so I could sleep later.

It tasted so good I doubted the chocolate was sugar free, so went up to the front to double check. YEP! It's all good.

If you have finicky requirements, this is the place to go. They actually taste good too and you won't feel like you're missing out.",A5h9B2u72GsK3oSmo-Iw5w,0,1,5,9cdgmz9H9WnKUNCRAmdO2w

5991661,2014-09-18,0,ybHlmdUHLPKfv85bRK4Wtw,"Ahhhh! I love finding these cool, quirky spots in Vegas outside the strip! Grouchy John's was an exciting find! (thanks yelp!!) It's worth the 10 minute drive to find coffee that doesn't start with 'S' and end in 'Bucks'. The coffee was really good here, although I am docking one star because I feel the drinks are prepared a little on the sweet side (I came here three times, during our stay, so I feel I had a pretty good feel for what they serve) But, it was good coffee as I said.

Service is outstanding! These people are eager to please! (so confusing considering the name!) Always friendly faces, and they even remade my husbands smoothie like 3 times to make sure he was happy with it (again, main problem was the sweetness...) Anyways, I wish we had a coffee shop like that in PHX!

Love the interior, it definitely has a coffee shop feel, and you can tell it's quite popular as it was always packed the days that we came in. 

This coffee shop is definitely now on our 'places-not-to-miss' list whenever we go to Vegas. OH! btw, when you check in, you get double stamps on their card! I actually earned a free drink while we were there for only 3 days!",iAd8XaHxv05iXyEiZ62Ibw,2,1,4,ja8AWcLfatALvMthcVKIiw
