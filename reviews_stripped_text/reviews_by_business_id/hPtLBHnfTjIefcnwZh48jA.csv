Unfortunately, the service was beyond terrible and the food was no better. Our waitress continuously passed by and never checked up on us and continued to chit chat with fellow co-workers. In addition, the chicken dish I ordered was dry and expensive for such a small portion. While I was there, another customer also complained to the staff that her service was terrible and her food was cold. She asked for the manager and they promptly told her that he was not available. After the woman left, the waiter she was talking to rolled his eyes and started talking crap about the lady not two minutes after she walked out. As the staff continued to gossip and talk crap, my cousin and I were still being ignored and thus we walked out.

530873,2009-05-27,0,hPtLBHnfTjIefcnwZh48jA,"Date night: went to joe's crab shack with my BF for dinner after he raved about the crab steampot he'd eaten there recently.  We were immediately seated at a table once the hostess learned we weren't waiting on a booth.  It quickly became apparent that we would not be conversing with one another on date night where we were seated.  Apart from the intermittent ""line dance"" known to all who frequent this place, the din in the restaurant was deafening.  My BF quickly asked that we be re-seated at the bar where he knew the service was excellent from his previous experience.  He got the same ""crab daddy"" steampot as before.  I ordered the ""beantown steampot"" complete with 2 entire lobsters (my nirvana).  To start, we both ordered their lobster bisque.  It arrived semi-warm and chock full of flavor albeit a little ""orangey"" colored, which begged the question as to whether it was infused with cheese or ???  I was ravenous and ate most of what I ordered. So did my BF with still plenty to take home.  The lobsters, with shrimp, clams and potatoes were very well- seasoned!  An NBA playoff game, nailbiting, down to the wire was airing on the tv's during our dinner which, in my mind, made the experience exciting and memorable.  It also made for a lively crowd.   I walked out, satisfied and full to the brim.  Romantics, it's probably not your place.  But if you're comfortable in your relationship (i.e can wear a bib with your BF and he still desires you) and looking for a satisfying seafood evening that won't break your budget try joe's instead of red lobster.",01prx46XR0mMJpNjpGeS6Q,0,2,4,OJiNSGG5Get2aS10fkSZKA

 This place was way better than expected!
Service was slow, but thats cause they had two HUGE parties inside and one on the deck so I can totally understand. Our server Jessica was apologetic and stayed on her game through the whole meal, remembering everything and delivering it in a timely manner.
What I liked best about this place was the playground for Lucy. Thats such a HUGE perk. When your a parent you wonder why the heck dont ALL chain restaurants do this?! lol check it, for just $12 bux I got twice as much plump and juicy coconut shrimp than you woulda got any where else. Stina had the steak and it was delicous. The foods a little lacking on presentation and the sides were a bit boring.

Ladies and gentlemen the captain recommends you wear the bib, it's gonna get messy. The truth is, I never come here expecting to find exceptionally good food. The food is good but not wow!.. good. The reason I stop at this place is because is fun, also for the service and the ambiance and to get away from the ordinary, it feels like you're far somewhere on a beach. The place can get loud, you know, party loud so if you expect to have a serious conversation this would not be the place to go to. Once in a while the waiters do some kind of dancing for entertainment around the restaurant, and there's also a guy going around making balloon animals and hats for the kids. Try to keep your birthday a secret or you will be embarrassed in front of everyone or embarrass your friends by telling the waiters that is their birthday, either way someone will get embarrassed.
 We ordered the bucket of snow crab legs and the crab stuffed shrimp but before that we had the calamari rings with marinara sauce for appetizer which it was very tasty.

1869821,2010-01-17,9,hPtLBHnfTjIefcnwZh48jA,"It's a good 10 miles or so from the Vegas Strip.  But this location of this chain crab and seafood restaurant is so totally Las Vegas.  It screams ""tourists, come inside!"". You've got the tacky weathered all wood pseudo shack with ""Joes Crabshack"" sign outside.  Inside, there are Christmas lights all year, the big goofy 12' long fake fish hanging from the ceiling, men's bathroom with ""Dudes"" on it, and a special on 60 oz. pitchers of beer. And as a special treat, the kids had the best balloon guy ever.  For one kid, he did a Darth Vader all black ""hat"" with a black sword.  For a little girl, he created an orange fish with blue bubbles.  And for her sister, created a six petaled flower with green steams.  

We were seated in about 5 minutes at 7 PM on a Friday night.  I really had low expectations of this place since I didn't enjoy my surf and turf meal at their Denver Colorado location a few years back.  Although I love crab, I hate to get my hands and shirt all dirty at a restaurant.  I will get sloppy at home where I can take a shower immediately after, but not here.  Pots of crab and seafood were the most popular item here.  A lot of the items are fried, like fish and chips, fried crawfish, fried shrimp. 

My brother had the lump crab cake dinner with two crab cakes, a small bowl of coleslaw, and french fries ($13).   The two crab cakes were moist and naturally sweet with the true subtle crab flavor coming through, with just a slight douse of onion and garlic.  The fries were tender and crisp, and not too greasy.  The cole slaw had bits of red and green cabbage, and carrots in a slighlty tangy and very sweet mayo dressing. I would give that meal a 4.5 rating.  I had the half and half crawfish combo ($12) with one half crawfish etouffee with bits of crawfish in a warm creamy sauce.  The other half was deep fried crawfish tails. It was served with rice and cocktail sauce. Both are actually good and not overcooked.  I only at 1/3 of it because of my New Year's resolution to reduce my intake of fried foods. Myh meal was perhaps 3.5 stars. Our meals were enhanced by the beers on tap. My brother had Sam Adams regular lager, I had the Blue Moon.

Service was attentive enough. Music playing in the background was classic rock and pop from the 70s to the 90s.  The place is loud and energetic, with little kids and adults loving the tacky atmosphere, comedic balloon guy, and the food.  It was a pretty good experience here.

Otherwise, my first, and probably last visit to Joe's was nothing but a vibrantly colored-glorified Red Lobster.

I was super excited to go because, ahem!, I like to eat crab and the place looks funfully inviting. AND IT IS (again, super witty tees)! I enjoy the colors, I enjoy the ""wharfy"" planks I had to carefully walk over in my stilettos, and hello? the commercials are pretty catchy, too.

Amber was a sweetheart. She grabbed a shark toy (cocktail flare) to give to my 2 year old nephew, gave her feedback on menu items, was bubbly, and thought everything we were ordering was delicious! I like her.

The calamari was boring and boring. My kid and I love calamari but this wasn't it. I'm pretty sure it was served with marinara sauce, not cocktail (where's the bit o' kick?). My....(wait, what did I order?)...oh yeah! My crab cake sandwich DID SAY it was served on an english muffin. Never before have I been so put off with consuming an english muffin - room temp, white, bleh. Tomato slice and shredded lettuce on the side. Some remoulade sauce (which I used to slather into my sandwich) was the hit the plate. My daughter got the crab nachos. They were yummy the next day. Sis-in-law had coconut shrimp & fries. I think she ate it. I had one and it was pretty good. But can you ever go wrong with coconut shrimp? IDK? 

In all, I'm pretty sure I won't be back to a Joe's Crab Shack. Okay, okay, maybe to grab a witty teeshirt.",ewEWg1jaBHITtjC3b9CTkw,3,1,3,sr92fjY5j6lk7lZ6CuCDBg

2338823,2011-11-06,0,hPtLBHnfTjIefcnwZh48jA,"Oh my God, this definitely isn't my type of restaurant. I hate having my dinner conversation interrupted with disco lights and an extremely loud version of the YMCA. Children probably love this restaurant because of how loud and colorful it is. And for birthdays they usually have the guest of honor dance around in fairy wings or some other Halloween costume accessory. So I guess this would also be a good restaurant to take someone for their birthday if you really want to embarrass them.

Never the matter, I hate all of it. But despite the obnoxiousness that is guaranteed to accompany my meal, I continue to frequent Joe's Crab Shack because their crab steampots are sooo effing good and only run about $20-25 each. Oh and the crab nachos are pretty good too.

I don't really have much else to say about the food because those are about the only things I order when I'm there. But I've been there at least once almost every day of the week, at different hours, and I've never had to wait more than two or three minutes for a table. 

A quick tip though: Don't sit outside unless you have a big selection of where to sit. The outside tables are like wooden picnic tables and many of them mysteriously wet or slimy because of week-old ketchup that was spilled and never completely cleaned off.",FycUYNTz4fswU8PE62Ybtg,0,0,4,jFNfvIBsJIgw9_mOyl0sog

It's a chain restaurant.  They have goofy stuff on the walls.  The staff does goofy dances.  They have balloon animals.  And they have a bucket on your table that you can throw scraps into.

Now let's get into the heart of the review: It's pleasant.  They know their shrimp and crab, and their Salmon Orleans is delicious.  Our waitress was funny and went above and beyond in providing good service.  The atmosphere was relaxing and very casual.  They have live music.

Sometimes a seemingly ordinary place can just remind you of what's it like to simply have a good time during dinner.  If anything, it reminds me of those little tourist seafood shacks that you visit on vacation with (again) the goofy stuff on the wall, but the food is excellent.  Take that vacation feeling, put it here, and there you go.

I've eaten here before and have never had a bad experience, but this last time, with the food and the attitude just inherently worked for me.  It's also reasonably priced, with a decent selection, so you can easily find something notable to eat here.

When we come here to eat, we usually get just about the same thing every time. A pot of seafood, with crab legs, shrimp, sausages, and corn. Every now and then we get a appetizer, but usually the hot pot is good enough to fill us up. Spices we usually get the same thing, the lousiana spice or new orleans, something like that, I don't really want to go back to the menu to look. But yea, it's the same spice we always get.

Food is pretty filling, but prices are crazy expensive. I really rather go to Boiling Crab or something similar because it is a bit cheaper for more bulk.

This particular restaurant is in LV and we're from the Bay Area, the closest Joe's Crab Shack is in San Francisco which is a about an hour away from where we live.
