91719,2014-01-26,0,YyxB3K1ORzc7ChMKgyxm9Q,Always a great experience.  The staff is friendly and hard working.  The store is one of the cleanest in town.  $5 Foot long sandwiches are great for a inexpensive lunch or dinner.,J9nJcm0XjBaM81z256QsDQ,0,0,5,HHolIa16BTdIczCZ63Mthg
106258,2013-04-25,2,YyxB3K1ORzc7ChMKgyxm9Q,0 stars if i could. Worst customer service. Never been to this subway til today after my daughter's dance class and it definitely lacked cs.  To the two girls working the 6pm shift if you don't like your job work somewhere else or suck it up.  Management needs to instill proper customer service upon training.  We barely ordered our food and their attitude and tone was rude already.  How would they feel if they received service like that! Will not be returning.,TUBuCPrS_8QTNvSnufDXwg,2,0,1,5dM-c0MYZfGZ3IROrXEoJA

It can get busy at times and the line gets long. But that happens at most subways I'm aware of.  It is kept clean.",FEJhYnXdFHhBqPwhAxsGmQ,0,0,5,nGAmk8wY89pH2cM4vFFStw

I went in rushing because they were closing in 5 minutes and yes I know it can be annoying to be the last customers. But the lady decided to lie to me that  her "" register was broken and it would let her ring someone out past 10pm and that it was ahead five minutes"" just bec she did not want to make one more sandwich and my sandwiches are the easiest I get tuna with just lettuce on it! Very upsetting.  Her excuse didn't even make sense. The reason I know they weren't having computer problems is bec the day before some dude was raving they got new computers. Very annoying.",6b-Gte56vuKKEu9ELNMyEg,0,0,1,DzdNZIqWM6bkCz-_xIoZ6Q

The staff is just and friendly as most others in this area. The most important part for me is the fact the drinks were ice cold, because its definitely heating up.

On a bonus note, this location is currently hiring if you know anyone looking for a job.",FTZyZbr1eF7s3Ss7uSLcXQ,1,0,4,5ksQFqYFm8F6rwrryaQhBQ
2911433,2013-01-24,2,YyxB3K1ORzc7ChMKgyxm9Q,"This is an awesome Subway! I have been coming here alot lately since it is so close to the house. I also love the fact that they open at 7am on weekdays. It just makes it too convenient to grab a sub or breakfast sandwhich on my way to work in the early mornings!

I alos like stopping by here after my workout to grab a chicken or tuna sub. I've been a Subway fiend lately! 

The employees that work here are all rediculously friendly, polite, couteous , and helpful. I have been here a solid dozen times in the past 2 weeks and have yet to have a less than pleasant experience. Lets face it, most Subways are pretty similar, its the customer service that makes such a great difference in one location to another. This is one of my faves in the city. Not to mention that the subs are always tasty too! I love the Roast Beef, SweetOnion Teriyaki, Cold Cut Combo, Tuna, and Chipolte Chicken Subs best.

Plus with that monthly $5 footlong special, how can you beat that for value! (I swear I don't work for Subway!) :P

It is a small location, so it is definately more suited for a grab-n-go situation. 

I'm quickly making this a regular spot, so until further notice it easily gets..

4 stars.",CDvhiRiczAq0M5pktyiyog,3,4,4,NR4GCV-chw64EIgKRz4CXw

But today I mosied my way in and an employee I've never met before named Johnny tried to force me to eat a disgrace of a Ruben. I don't like to use foul language as that's not how my momma raised me! But seriously F***k Johnny. Won't be returning here until numb nuts is gone. Yours truly, Terry! :)",QyVziBDONbtHN8_mDMtuCQ,0,0,2,yJBkHhDzYaSCMTffyplhgg

I never had to ask for ""more onions, more mustard , more more more ....."" they are so skimpy on EVERYTHING . And every time you ask for more they just get irritated , I basically gave them directions on how to make a proper sandwich because they don't know how! It's not that hard to make a sandwhich !!!!! .

The two employees are having a very loud colorful conversation and every other word is f**k by this girl, to be followed by ""I gotta go smoke"" while I'm glad they wear gloves to make sandwiches.... Come on, I have young kids here. Thankfully it stopped as I was about to get up. Haven't seen these particular employees before tonight.

5796988,2014-08-25,2,YyxB3K1ORzc7ChMKgyxm9Q,New management new owner or what ever it maybe sucks. Working in the near by strip mall in the Scottsdale Plaza we try to support businesses in the area. Just for a drink refill they want to charge a dollar.Just because we took it back to the office to eat and didn't eat there. Poor attitude. No more supporting  this location and I am sure to tell all the business around this area too.,LnX7-WmpML5bY6Fzlz468g,2,0,2,Nly5VqpoTPyyVLxZ4t-GCA
