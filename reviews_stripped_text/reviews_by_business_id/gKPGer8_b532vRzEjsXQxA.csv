I usually won't try small Italian joints (I'm an Olive Garden kind of guy), but once the complimentary garlic bread hit my mouth, I knew it was gonna be alright. It was pretty awesome! I ordered baked ziti with alfredo sauce topped with grilled chicken (which wasn't on the new menu, but our server hooked us up). Everything was excellent. Service was phenomenal. It felt like we were the only people in the restaurant! Needless to say, I will be back.",lfHVFjodimeix3bP6KdgnQ,1,0,5,dqpHLTUAUqRbvQHgAa2ZSQ
106342,2014-03-27,0,gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA,"First off, I have to say I'm saddened by my own rating... and I have to wonder if this place has changed hands and has new owners or something... because we've eaten here numerous times over the past 6-7 years and it used to be pretty good... I just never bothered with yelp until this year.  We hadn't visited in quite some time, partly because of a burnt calzone, and partly just because we just didn't think of it many times... but we decided to go again this time... and it wasn't a good experience at all!
First off, we used to love their garlic bread, we used to ask for an extra basket... but this last visit, UGH!!  The bread wasn't even toasted like it used to be... it was mushy & soggy... and not just because it had puddles of butter on it. Usually, it's lightly toasted on top, a great light crispy golden brown... this wasn't toasted at all and if you picked up a piece & turned it over, the butter POURED off of it.  We each took one bite, and stopped eating it, and left the whole basket practically untouched!
We ordered what we've ordered MANY times in the past... we wanted to SHARE a calzone, which is exactly how I ordered it, I said ""We're sharing the pepperoni calzone.""  When they brought it, we were surprised they cut it and split it onto two plates for us, we thought ""how nice of them.""  The calzone wasn't burnt at least, like it was last time, one reason it had been so long since our last visit.. but it wasn't great either... the sauce tasted totally different and it just didn't taste as good... so it was good, but not great.  It wasn't 'bad' per se, but I was disappointed... had that been our first time at that restaurant, i wouldn't have been back or ordered it again.  But it used to be great, which is why we came back occasionally.
But what really angered us and was the final straw... when we got the check, they charged us $4 extra to SPLIT the calzone in half.  We asked our server, who barely seemed to speak or understand English btw, and she just said ""sorry.""  We thought about demanding a manager... but then we thought why bother, we won't be back, they can have the lousy $4, they must be desperate for it.  But on the way out, a male server seemed to see the frustration on our face, and we told him about that charge... he said ""she should have told you that, if the kitchen cuts it, we charge that, if you cut it, we don't.""  I said ""she never said anything, we never ASKED you to cut it, we usually cut it ourselves & would have been happy to today... and it wasn't that great anyway.""  He apologized and said he hopes we'd give them the chance to make it up to us.  We said ""no, we won't be back.""  If he really wanted to FIX it, he would have refunded that ridiculous overcharge right then!!  Plus it's sad they charge $4 for the kitchen to slice a calzone for us.  We also based our tip off the amount without that $4 charge... I tip on food & drink amounts, not on unnecessary up-charges!
You would think they would be happy for ANY business & not charge people for something like that, which makes people less likely to dine there again.  The place used to be mobbed all the time, some years back, we had to wait for tables... but it was practically empty last nite, and is deserted many other times when we drive by.  But now we understand why.  Honestly we think they must have changed owners or something & chefs, because we didn't recognize anyone that we used to see all the time, and the food quality & flavors have changed and the service has gone downhill.  What a shame. :-(",3ebfZkfUcJC6NaeCeNhgLg,3,0,1,Qr_6ZAaWKWzwU99_M8r2tA

The food used to be a bit better than what I had this last visit. The service was friendly and everything was quick to come out of the kitchen. I had the eggplant parmigiana with fettuccine alfredo and it was okay. The marinara had an odd taste - something that reminded me more of an enchilada sauce than marinara. The alfredo was good - not too soupy (which I hate) but had a slightly more beigey/ecru tinge to it instead of being more white.

734021,2011-12-17,0,gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA,"In a town full of good Italian restaurants, Strings delivers value for money without Olive Garden-style slick service and ""Tuscan Culinary Institute inspired"" dishes that in all likelihood are on the menu because of focus-grouped reviews, food stylists and a marketing department that creates Italian-sounding words almost at will. 

So if that sort of thing has gotten to you and you are transitioning out of the Olive Garden lifestyle, Strings makes it easy, as some of its set up is familiar. They have all-you-can-eat salad served in almost the same bowl-tong combination as the OG, but of better quality. The soup as an alternative option also has a home-cooked taste, etc. The bread is also of higher quality. So where Strings first wins out over the OG is its locally-owned attention to every course that the standard Olive Garden experience cannot match. 

Strings' lunch menu is a smaller-portioned size of their dinner menu (with reasonably-priced specials), so let's just get to dinner items. I've settled on the Tortellini Alla Panna as my favorite- perfectly cooked, with a sauce that neither weakly disappoints nor overpowers. Of course, standards like lasagna and various spaghetti and fettucine dishes are also quite good and if you are really hungry, their triple combination of lasagna, tortellini and stuffed mushrooms will take care of it well. The marinara sauce can sometimes be hit or miss but never fear- if you mention this to your server another plate or bowl will appear with improved sauce in a matter of minutes.

I've been there for business lunches, casual evenings and dates and even one Christmas Eve dinner and no matter the occasion, the food is worth it and the price has been right. It helps that the place is locally-owned, giving it a hometown and familiar flair. 

The only reason I cannot give five stars is because once every 3rd-4th time I've visited, service is spotty. By that I mean either long wait times between courses with no explanation (and sometimes avoided eye contact), or over-attentiveness because there is a line of eager guests and we are subtly encouraged to get the pasta and get on with it. It's rare, though, and the food is certainly worth the occasional service glitch.",43nXxZLfX8nPUNzQlPpUeA,1,1,4,HsQmB21kWmLzIsXg-1AqfQ

The garlic bread was a nice surprise--just like my mom used to make it in the mid-1970's, on a soft french bread spread with garlic powder, butter and paprika, then put under the broiler until crisp and just starting to brown on top.  The salad LOOKED like something my mom would make, which had me leery.  I usually don't like fruit and ""stuff"" in my salad, but the dressing (a creamy Italian, maybe?) pulled it all together and I actually enjoyed it.

The entrees are the source of that unfulfilled promise:  they reach for interesting combinations, but don't quite make it.  At least they aren't Sysco pre-cooked offerings, and they are fairly tasty.

The desserts would probably appeal to most diners, but they are clearly Sysco (or other food distributor) offerings, far too sweet, and not sufficiently flavorful.  Again, not bad--just not superb.

That being said, the Award Winning Combo....is well, award winning.  This is the only thing I get at this restaurant having eaten there maybe five times now.  My husband tries different things and they are always good as well, but I love the combo thing.  A lasagna inside a puff pastry.

The bread basket..garlicky goodness and the house salad is awesome and I don't even like that kind of salad ever.

Hubby, a friend and I went her the other night. It was the first time for hubby and I, not for the friend. 

We were seated right away, kind of seating ourselves. Our friend arrived a couple minutes after us and we waited a few minutes to be acknowledged. We were approached by the waitress, asked if we were ready to order drinks, and while I was mid word to start my order, she throws her finger up and says ""just one second, there's food up in the window"". She then served the other table and chatted with them for much longer than necessary when you haven't even gotten a drink order out of another table. 

I have to say, I was anticipating a much worse experience than what we had based off of the initial encounter. After this, though, it seemed as though she was able to balance her attentions between her 2 tables (the place wasn't that busy). She was funny, upbeat, attentative and prompt (aside from the water thing). 

I ordered the fettucine with chicken, my standard at any new place. It was a large portion with great flavor. Went very well with the bottomless bread basket. I had about 1/2 left to take home. 

Hubby ordered the chicken parm. It had red AND white sauce, which he loved. He cleaned the whole plate (usually he has at least a little left over). 

We also had the salad, which was very good. I am not a fan of raisins in salad, but those were easy enough for me to not eat. They even catered to a picky appetite and served one bowl with ranch. 

Overall, a good experience with great flavor. The items are a little spendy, but appear to be about average for sit-down Italian fare. Definitely worth trying at least once.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,1,0,4,eKWf6PXRGcZwePyg-KDwjg

I had a pasta with sun-dried tomato, pesto, curry!!, chicken, roma tomato and three ginormous shrimp that were cooked perfectly. It was the best tasting and most unique pasta dish I have ever had.  I sampled my daughter's spaghetti and meatballs and they were perfect. 

Other than the waiter who may have just been envious of me because I was with my beautiful 3 year old girl and three rather attractive women (my sister-in-law and two friends), it was great. He was very attentive and the service was quick. We even heard the chefs barking at each other a little bit in the kitchen (I mean that in a good way). 

A great value too!",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,2,2,4,jpsAaT2juD0qPBAuJppNwA

I thought the house salad was really good, and the Lasagna Pastry was interesting and pretty tasty.  My companion ordered the Prawns & Sausage Fusilli and was pretty disappointed.  The sausage was clearly the same little balls of sausage that go on pizza, and not all that good in the dish.  I have nothing truly bad to say about the place, but I don't have many good things to say either.  It's all just OK.",fhK-Jjx-W23JhI9_YFymzw,1,1,3,L-sSXrIGbQ9Jkn5zU7Samw
4844439,2010-06-30,6,gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA,"Convinced my family members, who were visiting from out of town, to try this place (instead of Olive Garden, which was their suggestion, after we had eaten at Denny's the previous night.  Don't get me started....) based on a Reader's Pick write-up in City Life.

You can usually get SOMETHING vegan at an Italian place, although it's probably plain marinara; and that's what I was bracing myself for.  Filling, but boring.  Well! I was in for quite a treat when I consulted our very attentive waiter about vegan options.  He was helpful, seemed to understand what I was saying, and even had them modify one of the specials for me! 

I got a breaded eggplant filet (no eggwash!), with sauteed mushrooms, red peppers, and tomato/olive oil sauce (hold the parm!).  It was delicious, and different from anything I've had at an Italian place before.  Also had a pretty standard but good salad. 

The fam loved their stuff too, and proclaimed it ""Better than Olive Garden,"" which is high praise for them. ;) They even talk about going back next time they're in town!  I was very impressed with the level of service and the attention to my dietary needs.  I would gladly go again as well.",C-DfyTJjLP6PDP4P__TsBw,3,4,4,cfkkcshYVKk3bayIPA17RA

5016673,2013-03-22,0,gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA,"I've past this place for years and always wanted to try it. So when a living social deal came up for it I quickly purchased it. 

My husband and I went on a Tuesday night. There was only two other couples and one large group in the back. (The large group ended up being what I think were the owner and friends). With only one waitress there you can imagine the lack of service we got. In the end we had to wait 20 Min's for a box for my food and the check. 

As for the food, I ordered the house salad, which oddly enough contained raisins,but turned out to be really good. The house salad dressing was also good. My husband however ordered the ""famous"" minestrone soup. It was sad. Just some broth, a few veggies and a bean or two. Not what we expected. When we finally got garlic bread it was OK, but it was not fresh baked bread by any means. I felt I could buy that loaf at Smith's and call it good. Our main entrees where rather tasty. I ordered the Shrimp and Chicken Parmesan. Other then the shrimp being breaded and over cooked, it was yummy. The Chicken was not dry and their noodles and sauce were excellent. My husband devoured his meal. It had their three famous items: stuffed mushrooms, some covered in marinara sauce and others in alfredo sauce, lasagna baked in a pastry dough, and fettuccine alfredo.  He loved all three!  

The decor of the place was left to be desired. They had some sad jars of stale pasta and broken neon signs around the restaurant.  Also, the tables had tiles grouted on them and you could totally tell they are not properly cleaned. Bits of food were wedged in the cracks of the table top. The topper was when my husband went to the bathroom and there were door mats underneath the urinals. The mats used to say welcome, but had been peed on so much they were very faded. He said it was extremely gross. 

Needless to say we will not be coming back. I feel with some care to the cleanliness, decor and minor menu changes this place could be what it once was.",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,2,1,2,JbFTh02KUup9OvyZRhQzZw
5091112,2013-05-05,0,gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA,"I have been here multiple times over the years and am still not tired of it. Today I went in with a girlfriend for lunch. I ordered a spinach, mushroom, and bacon linguine, and she had a calzone milano (diced chicken, spinach, mushroom, alfredo sauce). We both enjoyed our entrees and had a GREAT time with our server Jonathon. 

My favorite things about Strings are:
- the menu (they have the expected entrees such as Shrimp Scampi, Chicken Parmesan, Lasagna; but they also have other items like a Spinach and Pepperoni Penne Alfredo, and a Lasagna Pastry)
- the service (fresh garlic bread and always the BEST and PERSONABLE servers)
- 50% wine Mondays (always a good time with your girlfriends!)
- Italian Cream Sodas (my favorite are raspberry, strawberry, and peach)

I would recommend coming by, especially if you're picking up a friend from McCarran, it's down on Tropicana and Eastern.

The venue is on the small side (hence Strings Italian CAFE) but its very comfortable and it can host a large dinner party if you call ahead.

***The minestrone soup is different, so if you dislike cabbage please order the house salad instead. (All entrees come with soup/salad)",xz81pPXEuon4-7yRg2ptDQ,0,1,5,mN_ZexD4ggzEywiEkrPepw

 It is good enough to go back or to check out but if you really want more authentic go to Sergios down the street.
 The atmosphere is kind of cute, it is not very big, if its busy you will hear everyone's conversation. Tables are close.",1jIlvLV10nOhwqcvWNQnQw,0,0,3,OQFKs3EsAOp5gJpfSqrKKg

I was surprised when I walked in; the restaurant was nicer than I expected from the exterior.  We were seated right away and the server brought a basket of garlic bread to our table when he came to take out drink orders.  I was so glad to see the basket of bread since it was past 2pm and I was starving!  The garlic bread was delicious; I could sit there all day and eat the bread.  I went with the server's recommendation and had the chicken parmesan.  It came with the choice of minestrone or salad.  The minestrone was decent and chicken parmesan was pretty good.  The side of fettuccine alfredo that came with the chicken parmesan was a little bland.  Service was excellent; our server was friendly and attentive.

5659292,2011-02-28,0,gKPGer8_b532vRzEjsXQxA,"Went here with Jen tonight (2/27/11) after we jumped around at Sky Zone. It actually wasn't our first choice. We went to PT's first, only to find out that location didn't serve food. Hmmmph. 

After breaking my own rules about talking on a cell while driving, I single handedly made a U-turn into the parking lot and through rolled down windows, and Jen and I decided that this was as good a place as any to try, as neither of us had been. I walked in, still on my phone, like a jerk :(, so we didn't check out the menu prior to being seated. I wish I had.

Okay, so I'm really not big on grain anything and I've stopped eating all sweets. Pasta falls into that ""Ummmm no"" category for me because I don't want to negate the hard work I've been taking on in the quest to get back into my former 16-year-old body.  Guess what's on the menu here? Pasta. Deep fried foods. *Sigh* There was no anti-pasta, so I was really concerned about finding something that I could eat, and wouldn't cost $18. I ended up with the cafe combo (unlimited minestrone soup, salad and garlic bread.) 

Jen asked them to make her penne vodka, her Italian dish of choice, which wasn't on the menu. I was a little confused that the waitress kept asking her if she wanted more pasta, because I didn't know they had all you can eat pasta (do they?) She also got the exotic sorbet bomb. Her meal total was about $16 - not bad. 

The service was attentive - Laura, and a man who was working on his English, served us and did a great job. 

Would I go back? Eh. There's not much for me to pick from with my diet restrictions, but if I had free reign to eat pasta for dayz... sure I would. 

Oh, and just another thing. The salad is killer and has raisins (which I love in salads!) 

Last thing, I thought it was really nice of the staff to charge me $8, rather than $9 for my meal. I liked that.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,2,2,3,h3zRDn0DMJyxRt_btxH8tQ

I normally order the lasagna pastry which is one of there original  creations. which is a pastry lasagna layer and baked with red sauce and white fettuccine it is so yummy, but when not in the mood I order the fettuccine Alfredo

Complimentary Garlic Bread was as good as always.  This time the kitchen was just about out of Stuffed Mushrooms when I placed my order, but two remained, and I received them for free.  Again they were memorable mixed with a mild Marinara Sauce, a very faint Pesto flavoring, and nicely melted cheese.  Of 15 mussels cooked in an excellent, zesty, tomato-based Seafood Broth, 12 were good and 3 were bad (closed up).  But that was still a win, because in most establishments I have frequented, normally only 12 mussels are served.  This time a bowl of tomato-based Minestrone Soup was hot and very good throughout.  Rough Romaine leaves bathed in a creamy Caesar Dressing also evoked a happy response from me.  

Thick Grilled Asparagus was much improved over the former thin and burned version.  A quite generous portion of thoroughly cooked Roasted Potatoes was served.  And, well-pounded veal medallions were delicious covered by a sumptuous and creamy Marsala Sauce.  A dessert of Exotic Bomba made with sherbet and very good Raspberry Sauce furnished a refreshing ending to a fine meal.

Service by Robert and an Iced Tea Lady was excellent and friendly.  Even though other artificial sweeteners were on the table, I asked for Sweet & Low, and got it!  Seating was comfortable, and the ambiance was nice with the sounds of Louis Armstrong and Frank Sinatra piped in as background music.  It just seems that being out of Stuffed Mushrooms on a Wednesday night at 6:30 p.m. is much too soon for that to happen.  Better provisioning could have avoided this.

We had an entertainment book coupon, so we decided to try this place out.  YUM.

I must say, though, that I disagree with the quality of the standard garlic bread.  It was only ""meh"" in my opinion.  They did have a cheesy garlic bread that you could order, and we did.  As Rachael Ray would say ""YUM-O"".  I had the alfredo with shrimp, my hubby had the veal parmesan.  The veal was real!  In other words, not a frozen patty.  Also, he noticed that the red sauces that came with the cheesy bread, with his veal and on his pasta were all different - they didn't use one red sauce for everything!

My shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the alfredo sauce was just the right amount of heavy.  Not thin, and not too thick that I could feel my arteries clog as I ate it.

The salad was quite tasty - I have to admit to some trepidation about the raisins - but it was good!

Our server was great.  We told her it was our first time there, so she took the time to tell us a bit about the history.  (They weren't very crowded when we got there, so she did have the time).

We will definitely be back!",ER4VikNscGAqk8O2pX61WQ,1,0,4,xdZjBntQf4heRGu8VZcvsQ
