The food is great overall, with every item having a distinctly different taste from the others in the chain. Definetely worthy of 5 stars.",MDAumb01JkYddQgJJccXXw,0,0,5,78XTarb8CHbsIzOQLayoxg

I needed something oily greasy and Mexican to eat haha so this was the right place. 

The Horchata was not only refreshing and delicious but above average. I understand that the way Horchata is liked can be totally subjective so just as an FYI i love mine extra gritty however not to sweet. (sounds like my last relationship)

The rolled tacos were also very yummy. Burrito was a plus too!",16sjjf0Wb5N31y-YQE6Y1g,0,0,3,YAcEde1zNocSANGnv0IqeA

Love the rolled tacos and the California Burrito is too good for words!! Tamales are the best you can get if you can't wait til your best friends Latin feast at their house during Christmas:-),wL-eQ6ZPYj-kUOh2uPavTw,2,0,4,vJP1DLenYp1OYSgvz3Fp9Q

Same menu as every location,same food sadly. Myself I like Ground Beef to be like a seasoned maidrite not Shredded Pot Roast with NO flavoring.

TOO Greasy and bland for my tastes!!

I prefer Victors next door",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,6,3,2,nrv5F_aI5RiT9ZEjsj52zQ
