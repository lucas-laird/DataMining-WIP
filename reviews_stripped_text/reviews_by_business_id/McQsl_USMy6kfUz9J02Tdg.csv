The BBQ pork was over-cooked pork slathered with BBQ sauce.  It did not taste like the two items were cooked together. The wantons were nasty!

The sweet and sour chicken was okay - nothing special.  The chicken in hot garlic sauce was pretty good.  The shrimp and scallops were good - it was mostly vegetables, but the flavor was decent.  The pork fried rice tasted old, not fresh.

The restaurant was hot as balls.  My back was totally sticking to the pleather seats.  We just moved to this side of town and were hoping for a go-to Chinese place, but this is NOT it.",xNltGiYRMLdqs5YSKyRJ7Q,0,0,1,OZBBKj5hgWylzpdyoP47aQ

951829,2011-01-06,0,McQsl_USMy6kfUz9J02Tdg,"THis place was recommended by a friend of mine.  I wanted to try a new chinese place in the southwest of las vegas.  I ordered orange chicken and asked for the sauce on the side.  It came as I ordered it.  The staff was O-K, but not really enthusiastic.  She did check on us frequently and accomodated everything that we asked.

My husband ordered the moo soo pork,  I didn't like it and thought it was too salty, but hubby liked it.  

Needless to say as much as my friend ranted and raved about this place (he drives all the way from the northeast side to eat here) I didn't like it as much as I thought.  I would not be my frist choice, but I would be willing to try this place again....",vG9CWs1De6KlzpeHl-Ambg,2,1,3,71IxAAffZA38ErHHNWb3_A

They serve more ""american chinese food"" as their business is more lunch people - but way less sauce and fresher than most.  

However - little known secret - if you want AUTHENTIC chinese food (less sauce/sugar and no MSG) they will make it for you.  But, if you like the PF Changs style cooking (which I admit at times I do too!) - this place is comprable and at half the price and no wait!",kVAy8nol_GefMbR7awm5TA,3,1,4,WGuhLT7MUmqyJ5B5W0SfnQ

I'm not going to itemize because each time I'm there I get something diferrent.  I Haven't been disappointed yet.  On the rare occasion when something's not quite right they take care of it immediately and if the dish is a bit over seasoned it's not washed down.  A whole new dish is prepared.  The place is small and cozy.  A nice place to go to for quiet conversation and great food.  If I could double or triple the stars I would.  I've recommended Lotus garden to others an they all really enjoyed it.  No fancy high end dishes.  Just good old Chinese dishes with great variety and great prices.,fjfPYjnmOqUn4qqUBFuBZA,0,0,5,QwuXoagd8MPAEzEW6rw-Zw

1479694,2015-11-11,4,McQsl_USMy6kfUz9J02Tdg,"I finally found a Chinese restaurant that has decent, quality food. If you like eggplant, you must try the spicy eggplant dinner! The eggplant is cut in chunks with noodles and some vegetables. It has a great flavor; I was pleasantly surprised.

Another great entree we enjoyed during this meal was chicken egg foo young and beef and snow peas. The egg foo young consisted of thick pieces of egg omelets with chicken in a tasty sauce topped with chives. The beef and snow peas entree consisted of a lot of fresh snow peas, onion, watercress, and carrot. 

Although the food preparation is fairly quick, the table-side service (e.g., refills of hot tea, more napkins, check) is slow. When we were in, only one server was on the floor handling everyone in the small restaurant dining area. Regardless, she was nice and the atmosphere was comfortable, clean, and nicely decorated. This complemented the dine-in food experience.

2085839,2011-09-23,1,McQsl_USMy6kfUz9J02Tdg,"I ate here because I was hungry and craving Chinese food. After a disgusting experience, I wish I never ate here in the first place. I wish you could rate in half stars but then again it wouldn't deserve that rating either.

First off: There was only one waitress doing everything in the front of the house: taking orders. answering phones, cleaning off tables, refilling drinks and taking orders to the tables. And the service was horrendous. I waited at least five minutes before she took my drink order, and another ten minutes for her to take my food order. If you wanted a refill, you literally had to flag her down and tell her.

Second: The food was mediocre. I'd choose Panda Express over this place. The food was bland, the rice was crunchy and so was the ""egg flower"" soup. I also ordered the Crab Rangoon, which were basically just filled with cream cheese, no crab taste whatsoever. They were still cold, fresh out of the fryer, and came with no dipping sauce.

Third: This place is a health department nightmare! The kitchen staff wasn't wearing anything to be sanitary. No hairnets or aprons. I have no clue if they were sanitary when it came to handling raw food. Two out of the three glasses at my table were filthy. The first glass had food particles floating at the top. The second was dirty around the rim. The glass I was drinking out of was ""clean"" but the outside of the glass felt gritty, and glassware isn't supposed to feel like that. I noticed the waitress cleaning off one table. She used water from a used glass to wipe the table down. After a man had been drinking from it during his meal. She pours a little bit of water out onto the table and proceeds to wipe up whatever mess was on it. After seeing that, I lost my appetite.

Fourth: There were no free refills. From a place charging nearly $3.00 for a soft drink, I'd like to see free refills, but this place charged $.75 per refill. But you could buy soda from a 24 oz. bottle, which costs $2. I noticed on the drive home that the soda bottle I purchased was expired almost three months ago.

All in all, this place was disgusting! The service was terrible, the food was terrible and the cleanliness of the place (or lack there of) was horrendous. I would never go back here. And avoid the lunch rush, because this is when it happened to me and I don't want anyone getting sick of this joints lack of cleanliness.",GZLbv-are_wAC9XVxW70LQ,6,1,1,YjZRNodK15I9GGrXBsQFDA

I finally found a great Chinese food place near me. (I had to move to find one though). I ordered pork wonton soup, egg rolls, two chicken dishes and a beef dish and it was all NOM city baby!

The sweet and sour chicken was fresh. The chicken was encapsulated in a fried golden brown dough that tasted sooo good. The sauce was the right consistency and the vegetables were a plenty and cooked to perfection. The General chicken and beef and broccoli dishes were just as nice.

I ordered take out and had pups in the car. The sweet woman at the counter said she would deliver my order to my car so my doggies weren't alone. AWWWWWW (It's the little things)!

This place is a full restaurant with lots of comfortable booth and table seating options. The service is great and the food is whipped up and served quickly.

It's not bad at all to be honest. They give you some chip like noodle and sauce. The waitress is really fast to get you your drinks and food is given fast as well.

- Your choice of entree that comes with fried rice
- Your choice of soup (egg drop or wonton) or house salad
- And an egg roll

I went for the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce -- without fried rice on the side -- and egg drop soup. Not enough ""egg drop"" in my soup, and my entree was lacking in the taste department. The sauce was on the gelatinous side, and I didn't care for the bits of beef scattered throughout. Furthermore, the vegetables tasted like they were fresh from the freezer. As for the egg roll, there's nothing exciting about it, but it is packed with veggies and rice noodles. 

The service is quick; my co-worker and I received our food in under 10 minutes. I should also add that the employees here are resourceful. My co-worker wanted to take her Thai iced tea to go and asked if she could get a to go cup.

I decided to go with the Mo Goo Chicken. Described to me as chicken vegetables water chestnuts in a stew sauce. So when my co worker came back with my meal (I WAS STARVING btw) I was excited to dig in until I opened my box. The Chicken was literally swimming I a gelatinous sauce with steamed vegetables in it. It was hot and there was not much flavor. I didn't see a sprinkle of pepper on there and the chicken although cooked all the way was as white as snow. Literally I poked my fork at it in and it jiggled. (Gross) the fried rice was so tough and chewy. The only part I ate of the entire box was the egg roll. Bland but hot and I was desperate so oh well.

4655524,2016-01-20,8,McQsl_USMy6kfUz9J02Tdg,"The neat thing about hiking adventures is that it is usually followed by a dining adventure. This past Sunday afternoon following Norm K's Freeway and Donkey Wash Trails Hike UYE, I tried Lotus Garden Cuisine. 

  Lotus Garden Cuisine is in the shopping center at the northwest corner of Rainbow and Sunset Roads immediately north of  the 215 Freeway Rainbow Road exit. Due to its proximity to three major roads, it is in easy reach to motorists commuting across the valley. This is a Chinese restaurant that many people could enjoy. One of the many is yours truly who will share his positive experience dining here. 

   From my experience dining in Chinese restaurants there are two types of dining environments. One is the take out style restaurant with tables and the other is the cozy restaurant with a server. Lotus Garden Cuisine is the later. 

  I made it in time for the lunch special. In my opinion, the Chinese Restaurant lunch special is one of the best deals around. For the price of a fast food restaurant, the lunch special gives a lot for the money. As soon as I set eyes on their lunch menu, I was impressed. They offer over and above what many of the Las Vegas Chinese restaurants do. When it comes to the lunch special, many of the Chinese restaurants serve either egg drop or hot and sour soup calling them soup of the day. However, Lotus Garden Cuisine offers hot and sour soup, egg flower soup, wonton soup or house salad with house dressing. I have yet to see a Chinese restaurant offer house salad with house dressing as a lunch special choice. The lunch special menu gets even better. Hitherto now, every Chinese restaurant lunch special charges additional for shrimp-based entrees. At Lotus Garden Cuisine a Mongolian Beef entree and shrimp with lobster sauce lunch special is $6.75. All 22 lunch special entrees cost $6.75. They include soup or salad, egg roll, and fried rice. Plus, before the meal, they give you crunchy skinny noodles with duck sauce. I was starting to enjoy this dining adventure. 

    I complimented all this food with hot tea. I'd pour the tea from a tea pot into a small cup. The advantageous thing about hot tea besides the taste is that it gives me a break from the high sugary soft drinks that customarily  compliment my dining adventures. 

    The food was served over the Chinese Zodiac place menu. Looking at the place mat, I had a revelation about myself, ""Being born in 1972 makes me a rat."" But a good rat that is ambitious and sincere. Kind of like this review. Anyways the food served on the place mat was on regular china with silverware. This isn't China Go Go or one of those places where the food is in styrofoam boxes with plastic forks. There was a quality presentation to the food. And ultimately a quality taste. 

    From the wonton soup which included broccoli to the shrimp chop suey, this was delectable Chinese food. There was sufficient shrimp interspersed with the vegetables, sauce, and onions that made up the shrimp chop suey. The egg roll was bigger than a Twinkle. The fried rice had a nice texture. 

   I had zero complaints about the service. The waitress would check up on me and never rushed me. Plus, she never charged me for the hot tea. 

  The lunch adventure concluded with the check and fortune cookie. All this delicious food that I shared with you and hot tea in a cozy atmosphere came out to $7.30 before the tip. That is less money than Panda Express and even some of the food at McDonald's. My fortune would read ""Keep your plans secret for now."" Now is over, and I can let everyone in on my plan that I am spreading the word that there is a really good Chinese restaurant called Lotus Garden Cuisine that is a hop and a skip from the 215 Freeway off the Rainbow Road exit.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,15,11,4,WR5k9ZpRWP5Gz1RFh1V6pg

Although tonight I ate supper here (craving good veggies), I usually come here for lunch. They have family-style specials that are fun to share with co-workers and friends. Soups always satisfy, and sauces make their dishes pleasing.

It's all fresh and MSG free, so no post-meal headache. With good balance of veggies and proteins, feel like I come away happy and healthy.",VDrwwTUBukgD1yAaQw1-cw,0,0,4,xk8nW-urCzIazSFBNMrhCA

5102245,2017-06-29,0,McQsl_USMy6kfUz9J02Tdg,Decent lunch special.  Quantity looked small but it was way more than enough for a lunch meal.  They also gave wonton soup which is unusual for lunch specials and these were pretty decent wontons.  Tasted handmade and not mass produced.  Gave it an extra star for that. The atmosphere and service were good too.  I only dinged it one star because my beef green beans was a little salty.  its really suspect whenever i am served salty meat because restaurants do that to either mask old meat or make bad cuts more tender.  This is usually because the business isnt enough and stuff gets old.  More restaurant style panda express with more menu variety.  The dishes is also made fresh instead of under hotplates and mass cooked.,SyyYQfNQ4a4Lua5RBlggmQ,0,0,3,bUGgm5u-imqngINmcagvCw

I never asked for a discount however once she snarled at me I replied once she returned to the table. I didn't eat half, I took one bite and the taste and smell has made me nauseous. No apology, just an attitude, wow.  

She said ok, returned to the table to throw the check at us. I have no idea why she was so belligerent towards us? I was super sweet, nice and discreet. She was in the kitchen yelling loud in her native language, it made us uncomfortable.
