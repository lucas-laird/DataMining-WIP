The cashier Caleb was not very friendly as he greeted me .  No smile or have a nice day in fact he didn't seem too pleased to take my order.  The waitress Jessica also wasn't friendly . There was no kind word or smile as she shoved my food into my hands. Never once did I hear , ""have a nice day or thank you ""  The food was great but the customer service didn't make me want to return .  I visited a place called Yardbird and all their staff smiled and said , Hi .  As I left Yardbird every staff member I came across smiled and said , thank u for coming, have a good day or come back and see us as they smiled .  I felt more welcomed and appreciated at Yardbird.

From the outside, the place looks like a real hole in the wall, which it is...this place has soul.  Before you even walk through the doors, the aroma of smoked meats sets forth the salivary glands into full production.

I ordered the Trio plate with pulled pork, spare ribs and brisket with a side of hush puppies.  For the money, the volume of food is a very good value.  I managed to eat about 3/4 of the plate and the leftovers easily comprised a separate meal.   The flavor of the meat was delicious and the sauce complemented the meal perfectly.  Even the hush puppies had a nice underlying spice to them that was quite addicting.  Something as simple as properly seasoning hush puppies tells me there is attention to detail here. 

Good food can get you four stars but its the staff that pushed it to five for me.  They were incredibly friendly and upbeat.  You can tell when a place is well-run by just listening to how they interact with each other.  It was clear that this staff really cares about what they do and have a passion for their craft.

However, the food shines bright! Especially the World Famous Meat Loaf!! Sooo soft that u cant distinguish the meat from the mashed potato.  Just a delicious soft gooeyness that melts in your mouth.  The ribs are good too but I can say that I've had better ribs before.

35475,2016-03-27,3,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Are you kidding me with the wait? 

The wait was way too long. I waited 1 1/2 hours and was quoted 25 minutes for my food. Had I have known it would have been that long of a wait time, I would have left. The order taker was not very friendly and did not make a good first impression. She seemed rushed and annoyed that she was taking orders, even though I already knew what I wanted and only asked one question about the pies. 

After waiting an hour in a half for our food, I was really hoping for amazing barbecue. In fact, I was so hungry at that point, I didn't think I could tell the difference. Anything seemed like it would have been yummy. But, I was wrong. I could definitely tell that the food was just okay. Definitely NOT worth an hour in a half wait. 

Ribs were good, hot links were good, but the chicken, pulled pork, and chopped brisket were bland. I had to drown it in sauce to make it worth eating. And even drowning it in the sauces (I tried all the sauces), it still did not help the flavor get any better. The baked beans were average, the corn nuggets - I did like and would say is above average. The coleslaw was mehhhh. Not impressed. 

One of the order takers was 'smart mouthing' customers who complained about the wait on their food. i was appalled. I kept my mouth shut. But, customer after customer steamed with frustration after their wait time pushed way pass 45 minutes, then an hour, then an hour in a  half. What was more frustrating is the order takers were still quoted a 25 minute wait on food, when they knew full well the kitchen was backed up to over an hour. I have no idea how this place got such stellar reviews and no one mentioned the crazy wait.  

I love BBQ and for the past few days I had been going to Famous Dave's. After this ridiculous wait at Rollin Smoke Barbeque, I'd rather go to Famous Daves. The food at Famous Dave's is just as good. In fact, what I ordered there was quite possibly a tad bit better. The atmosphere, service, sauces, and speed of food trumps Rollin Smoke Barbeque any day! 

At Famous Dave's, the wait was only 15 minutes for our feast for 6 people. In my opinion, a 15 minute wait for a feast of 6 is totally worth it. Plus, there was so much food we had left overs. The feast for 6 comes out to be $11 a person (if you have 6 people) and was so well worth every penny and every bite.",f9v_i9HV2iI1m0Dy29yKjg,1,0,1,5eMMgiqfuYDzzx7QPtzwHg

70715,2013-08-16,6,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"We were in Vegas April 2013 and did a random Yelp search for some BBQ.  This place had high marks and they weren't too far off the strip.  I even feel badly about the low rating that I am leaving, because so many others were so good.  But this is our truth...

We walked into the place and the smell of smoke was potent and we were really eager to try a little of everything.  We ordered a sampler and because we ""checked in"" there we got a free dessert.  The meal was a HUGE disappointment!  What a shame.  We have strong roots in the south and this did not do it any justice.  

The chicken was flavorless.  The ribs had smokey flavor, but was borderline jerky!  The pulled pork was sub-par.  The sides were also a disaster.  The beans were hard and way too spicy, just underdeveloped flavor.  The mac and cheese was a mushy blob of fake-tasting cheese, just not good!  The bread they served was hard and cold.  I would have paid them extra NOT to bring the so called dessert to the table.  That was the poorest excuse for peach cobbler.  Marie Calender's from the local grocery store would have been way better.  The banana pudding was baby food grade, and gritty, just not right!  

Maybe we went at the wrong time of day (dinner time on a Tuesday night)?  Perhaps it would have been better at lunch time or on a Friday/Saturday night?  Maybe, if we're desperate, we might try again on a more popular night?  

I think the guys are trying hard, because the service was pretty good and hospitable (hence the 1 star).  For us, the service was the only bright spot.  We left a lot of the food picked over and with our pockets $30 lighter.  The waiter came over to the table with a big smile and said ""Ain't it good?""  We just didn't have the heart to break it down for him.  It is terrible when you pay for food and it doesn't meet your expectations and you leave hungry...what a waste of time and money :-(",worFdw_7a0CNoq0-ZsEtKw,6,1,1,9Np9lqbvc_Yo8WIdmB6vTw

Trust me, I am not new to reviews & am a well traveled person (been to 34 countries so far) & I ALWAYS give benefit of doubt to any restaurant as anyday can be a bad day for them (as its for us). That's why I try more than 1 thing on multiple days before crossing out any restaurant.

They stated that the ice cream was Blue Bell and in fact it wasn't. I'm from Texas and know the ice cream very well, and what BBQ should taste like. I've had better ribs at chain restaurants where the meat falls off of the bone. Unfortunately this meat felt like it was fighting for its life to maintain a part of the bone.

161539,2013-09-11,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"The restaurant is in a very odd industrial area near auto shops, strip clubs and warehouses, and is probably the only one in the area. You walk in to a haphazard restaurant with not much of a front counter, but instead a confusing podium to order at with no one standing there most of the time. The menu is on a wall kind of near this podium, so you better know what you want before you walk over to order. There are a handful of two, four and large top tables between the two awkwardly cramped rooms of this place, sparsely decorated with a few down lights and some reclaimed wood on the walls. You can tell it was thrown together cheaply, but it seems to fit with the homegrown feel of backyard BBQ. The great smell of smoke fills the space the whole time you sit there, and never really fades away while you're there or from your clothes when you leave.

The menu features pretty much all the standards you would expect from a BBQ joint, but as I said I was suckered into ordering their Outlaw Burger: brisket, onion, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese and chipotle aioli. I'm skeptical of any BBQ place that can't get sweet tea right, so I was nervous about this thing given the somewhat flavorless tea I sat with while waiting for my burger to arrive. And what came out was just too big to enjoy; the patty alone is a thick mass of meat that's possibly a bit overcooked just because of its size and how long it has to cook. The bun was far too small and thin to hold up to this mess, even with a decent helping of lettuce at the bottom to create a buffer from any sauce. Probably the best flavor in this whole thing were the onion rings, which tasted far better on their own than in the burger where they got lost in the myriad of flavors. The huge glob of cheese had good flavor, but like most other things in this burger there was just a bit too much of it. As for the aioli, slaw and other items, I couldn't really tell you much because I didn't notice them enough. I think if this were your typical 1/4 or 1/3 pound burger it would probably be pretty good, still a far cry from the best burger in Vegas as they've claimed, but maybe in the upper half. But like my recent complaints about a huge burger in San Diego, this is just too much to properly enjoy.

Something extremely puzzling and disappointing for me was the complete lack of fries with my burger. Looking at their menu online now, apparently the $8.99 ""smoking deal"" for the Outlaw Burger is a deal for just the burger, you have to read the small print at the bottom where it says to add $3 for a side and drink. I wish the guy that took my order would have said something as I spent $2 for just my iced tea expecting the fries that were in the picture with my burger. What burger doesn't get ordered with fries?! I guess maybe one of this size, as I surely wouldn't have been able to finish it if I ate anything else, but fries are almost always a necessity. For $11.88 I certainly got a lot of food, but I don't know if it was worth the cost or stomach bomb. I have a feeling that you should stick to the true BBQ that this place is known for, and not their ""best burger"". I know I'll be back to test this theory.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,2,3,VJdTiLfioG6EXXPsi_1_iQ

This is my main method of judging BBQ joints and they passed with flying colors. Added to that, the greens were perfect. If you've been missing collards, mustard, or turnip greens, this is a great combination of all three. Definitely check in first so you can get the dessert. I didn't but the server didn't mind adding the order, which was nice because of the consideration. I got the banana pudding which was good, but I would have liked to have had some bananas in it.

I ended up throwing some of the brisket in the Mac and cheese to offset the amount of cheese and tang up the straight forward Mac and cheese side I had.

We were in the area so we stopped in after hearing nothing but good things. Lucky us, we scored a parking spot right up front. When we left, people were parking down the street. Well, I know why!!

My sister and I split the four meat combo. We got brisket, chicken, ribs and pulled pork. My favorite was the pulled pork, but all the meat was excellent! For our sides, we had corn nibblers, hush puppies and jalapeno cole slaw.

Sadly, we eat low carb, so we just had a little bit of each side. I was very very sad that I couldn't inhale all of them. The fact that I left three hush puppies behind literally makes me want to cry! Either way, we were finishing up and one of the guys from the back walked up and asked if the cole slaw wasn't good. You could tell he was concerned and wanted to make sure everything was okay. I explained that I am low carb and low sugar and that I WISH I could eat it all. I explained how good it all was and he gave us a high five. Nicest guy!

So not only is the food great, but the customer service was equally as good. You can tell they care about every aspect of their business, from the quality of the food to the people they serve.

As a fellow small business owner, and one in the food industry, it can get VERY hard to just run an establishment, let alone do it in a way that makes people obsessed with your food. Somehow, they make this place work pretty seamlessly and we will most CERTAINLY be back soon.

Immediately stepping out of my car into their parking lot the smell of bbq smoke floods your nose. You know it's going to be good. 

I must say, to my disappointment that I did not get to try as much as I should have. I had the Pull ""Piggy"" as it's called, which is pulled pork on a hoagie roll. I read some other reviews that it was pretty large and since I was coming for lunch I didn't want to over do it. My mistake. It wasn't that big at all. Simple six-inch hoagie roll stuffed with smoked pulled pork with a drizzle of their bbq sauce and some green onions. It was very stuffed, but I still wasn't full afterwards. My fiance got a sandwich as well, the beef brisket. Both were absolutely amazing. The meat is tender and packed with flavor. The bbq sauce isn't overwhelming and heavy - enough to add flavor and more moistness.

   Located behind fashion show mall, near all the ""adult"" stores.. a little shack... other people drive up ; 3 guys and a girl in another vehicle pull up and order before us in line.. Too bad these male law students can't pay for the girl.. she ordered last.. I was like "" Why are they not pitching in for a lady to eat at a BBQ!?""  i guess they are all on ""friend status"" only.....

   Special of the Day: Beef tips, with two sides and a drink for $13.00.. I got the LAST order. the gentleman i ordered from, w/ braids/dreads(dirty blond) was so nice and had the best hospitality.. it was so refreshing. 

    I want to try some chicken and pig.. so the Half Chicken and Half Spare Ribs was in order...
Mention a Check-in on Yelp and they will gladly honor a free dessert.. I asked"" What's the best to get?""  the Braided gentleman in his accent.. ""the Banana one"".. i said ""let's go for it!""

   At last the food arrived and it easily feeds for 6. but my bf and I could finish these trays of food in two sitting!  wow, THe food here is just so different.. Smoky and not too sweet but the beef tip and ribs had a special zing... not too spicy. i just say .. ZING"" is the word and i liked it!

We chowed down.. even the loaded potato salad and chipotle Cole slaw was a nice accompaniment to the hearty meat. 

Dessert! ohh my goodness real ripe banana and the pudding with the vanilla wafers and spray of whipped cream! i want one right now ! soo indulgent that i almost had a big ""O"" ..no i didn't but it made me think .. How much time did they really make this banana goodness in a cup?. was it just jello instant banana pudding and i'm just having a taste bud trip? 

So... is it worth going to the Rollin? Yes! Go.and make sure to utilize the roll of paper towels on the table and don't get upset that your clothes smell like a Smoky BBQ plate!",wC4xpodmp16tX9f__3LKPw,3,1,4,M_sjPw2T8SiN6uR1pdb-ow

Nice char on the meat, great smoky flavor! The pulled pork was tender as well. Great pork flavor. The fatty part of the brisket was killer! Nice burnt fat pieces with succulent strips of beefy goodness. They also threw in regular pieces of brisket which I didn't care for but took it home anyway. I don't care who makes it, I've never cared for brisket as I've always thought  it's a dry piece of meat. It was great cold the next day. The mac n cheese was creamy  enough, but even the extra cheese on top didn't make it ""cheesy"" enough. The yams were excellent. Lots of brown sugar cinammony goodness! The portions are large and come with a piece of Texas toast under the meats so it soaked up all the pork juices and was an extra added treat! My friend enjoyed his chicken and spare rib plate with jalapeno cole slaw and fried okra. There BBQ sauce is very good! Not too sweet, peppery and flavorul!

531193,2013-04-10,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"As a foodie who grew up in Kansas City, my great frustration with the Las Vegas food scene for many years was the absence of authentic wood-smoked barbecue.  The dirty little secret of the BBQ business is that a lot of it isn't smoked, but just baked in a regular oven.  Oven-baking is a zillion times easier - no fire to tend, no smoke burning your eyes - but it lacks the delicious smokeyness that BBQ fanatics live for.  You will never see a wisp of smoke coming out of Famous Dave's, Lucille's, or Memphis Championship.  But if you drive up to Rollin' Smoke, you'll see the smokers billowing away right in their parking lot.  Rollin' Smoke, Top Notch (both relatively new) and Annie's Kitchen (open for a while now, but not in the best neighborhood) are the only three BBQ joints in Las Vegas where they actually smoke the meat.  And believe me, once you've tasted the difference, you'll never go to the oven-baked frauds again.

For BBQ lovers who must know:  hickory is the wood of choice at Rollin' Smoke, the dry rub is fairly mild, and their sauce is closest to the sweet Memphis variety.  If you're not that concerned with the fine-print details, suffice it to say that Rollin' Smoke is exactly what barbecue should be:  smokey, meaty, and falling-off-the-bone tender.  If you're looking for a LOT of meat for a terrific price, go with the St. Louis ribs, the $12 half rack feeds two normal adults or one BBQ glutton.  The $20 full rack should easily feed a family of four; the size of the rack is straight out of The Flintstones.  While most people prefer babybacks because of their tenderness, my problem with babybacks is that there just isn't enough meat on them.  My eyes popped when I saw the babybacks at Rollin' Smoke because I've never seen babybacks anywhere (well OK, not in Kansas City, Memphis or Texas - 3 of the 4 ""capitals"" of BBQ) with so much meat on the bones - all the tenderness of babybacks but twice as much meat.

There are plenty of other great items on the menu.  The pulled pork and beef brisket are both winners.  For lovers of Texas-style, they even offer beef ribs, done to perfection (beef ribs are a lot trickier than the pork kind).  My favorite side dish is the bacon potato salad.  The mac & cheese is great too.  One side to avoid is the yams, which I thought were blechy.  True to the owner's roots, two Southern classics are available for dessert:  banana pudding and peach cobbler.  They also serve up a blackberry cobbler which is pretty good (even though I don't like blackberries).  Two caveats before you eat here: 1) be very specific about what you're ordering, because mixups can happen; and 2) order less than you think you can eat, because the portions are huge.  If you're looking for food late on a Fri or Sat night, Rollin' Smoke is open until 1:30 a.m. - a far better option than the overpriced mediocrity of casino coffeeshops.

The typical BBQ joint is formica tables and white plaster walls, bare except for a few pictures of the owner posing with whatever celebrities have eaten there.  Rollin' Smoke is a bit nicer than most because it took over its space from a failed restauranteur whose background was interior design, not food.  But forget the interior, all you need for ambience is a view of those beautiful billowing smokers in the parking lot.",hJ6jVSwzPLUH_SVou4is7w,5,4,5,QZoG-uO0j0UwNfghBya4yw

I am going to keeping taking my friends here.  These are the best ribs that I have had in town.  They also have a ground beef/brisket hamburger that I am dying to try.  This place has no thrills but incredible food.  Highly recommended for the food and adventure.,SKxSUuYhCIUf5L1BMDuSEg,1,0,5,cQLTjQixGEoji-h9yIdrHw
604497,2015-10-21,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"This place was amazing...the only reason I gave it a five star is for the MEAT and meat only! The sides are just okay okay, the Cole slaw was below average and the potato salad I thought was great it had BACON (nice touch), but the hubs said that was the only reason the potato salad was decent. The sauce I could do with or without. 
Okay let's get to the main reason I'm posting this review, the MEAT! The meat was amazing! The flavor is spot on. I'm originally from Oklahoma and haven't been able to find BBQ that is even is the same wheel house as Oklahoman BBQ. You guys have completely nailed the BBQ. I can't even put into words just how good the meat is! So for me I will purchase the meat on its own and do my own sides. Love love love it!!!! Thanks for helping me find a great main meal!

613810,2014-10-24,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"The food steals the show in this restaurant.   Due to the popularity with the locals, the establishment is under strain to keep up.

Food: 10/10 - This is where this establishment shines.  True barbeque.  The brisket and ribs have smoke rings in the meat and the building smells great when you walk in.   Great value!   You get a lot of food for not a lot of money.    Served on white bread just like BBQ should be!  

Service: 7/10 - The kitchen really cares about what they are serving.  However the ordering process is under strain to keep up with the largely local patrons who visit.  The line frequently stretches out the door and with one person taking orders the wait can be longer than it takes to eat the food.    The person taking the  orders is friendly and trying hard to keep up but the management needs to improve the infrastructure.  The podium itself is very simplistic and the whole setup is not build to handle a crowd.

Decor: 5/10 - They have a fish tank featured on the tv show ""Tanked"" but it is in sad shape.  The restaurant is worn out and a bit unorganized comprising of 3 disjointed eating areas.   The eating areas look like they were expanded to meet demand but in an adhoc manner.

Cleanliness: 7/10 -  The area to get your sodas is sub par.  Poor lighting and hidden for first time visitors.   There were no major areas of uncleanliness but the restaurant was not beaming with cleanliness either.   Some improvement is needed.

Parking: 6/10 - Parking can be tight.  Small shared lot.   Note: You are in strip club central in this area.

Restrooms: N/A - Didn't visit.

Overall: 9.5/10 - Don't bother with BBQ on the strip.  This is a local gem if you can go at off peak times or don't mind waiting for your food.  

The food is what brings the locals here and for good reason.   The problems that this establishment faces are good problems to have.  Namely, they are growing fast and are in a phase where they should be planning their next phase of development.  They are in need of a re-haul on the building itself to bring the eating area into one cohesive place with a modern order taking setup.

If they can overcome these obstacles there's no end in sight to the good things that lie ahead at Rollin' Smoke BBQ.",6n0zHhe9S8a5USbpDG_fKA,3,1,5,t6VPB_RqQ0mImP47Rx1H6g

My boyfriend and I got the 3 meat platter. Beef brisket, burnt ends and pork. My boyfriend said he really didn't care for the beef brisket. The burnt ends were over seasoned. The pork was just a huge clump of plain pork which I had to add a decent amount of sauce to.
Sides: mashed potatoes and corn bites. I'll be honest...I swear the mashed potatoes were those Betty crocker bagged dry potatoes with stuff added. It was weird. They tasted flavorful but fake. The corn bites were decent hot but once at room temp they were blah. 
We spent about $25 on this meal which is a little expensive. We did get a lot of meat but it just overall was not great.

Rollin Smoke is the real deal!  I was in Vegas on a business trip and tried it on a lark... Where have you been all my life, Rollin Smoke Barbeque?!

As soon as I walked in, I could smell it... That authentic smoke that portents rich, savory flavor in meat (if it is done correctly, and Dusty - the proprietor of this gem - does it correctly).

Their prices were definitely solid for definitely solid for the portion size, which is a pretty remarkable thing in Vegas.  There is even a 10% off coupon on their website!  I got the all-you-can-eat deal (which is all you can eat of anything on their menu... anything!) because I wanted to try a bit of many different things, and it was $21.50 after coupon.  But their other meals and combos were very reasonably priced as well.

Now for the feast... I tried sausage, brisket, hot wings, spare ribs, and beef ribs, but they also had shrimp, catfish, baby back ribs, chicken, hush puppies, beans, and on and on and on.  The sausage was solid with a nice little kick.  The brisket was a little lean, but very tender and tasty.  I got the ""Damn Hot"" hot wings (I have won several wing challenges in my day), and I don't know if they were trying harder to hurt me than normal, but they were HOT, with a building heat that walked that line between pleasure and pain.  All of that was great, but the ribs really shined.  The spare ribs were large and meaty, with a deep-down smoke flavor that spoke volumes about the slow care that went into their creation.  And the beef ribs, which Dusty insisted I try, were the coup de gras... Meaty, mild, flavorful, and tender... The best beef ribs I have ever had, no contest!  And how did I finish this homage to gluttony?  With a homemade bread pudding (covered in whiskey sauce) that was heavenly!!

Dusty himself chatted with me and my friends for a bit - telling us about his cooking process, the pride he (as Pit Master) takes in his food, and the labor of love his restaurant has become - and we even got to meet the special chef whose grandmother's bread pudding recipe would now forever haunt my dreams.

This is THE hidden gem of Las Vegas...  I have lived all throughout the South (Texas, Georgia, Virginia, and everywhere in between), and this is the BEST BARBEQUE I HAVE EVER HAD!!  If you like barbeque, and you are coming to Las Vegas, I highly recommend you give this place a shot.

The dishes here are unique and do an excellent job highlighting masterful barbequing skills.  I had the Barbeque sundae and highly recommend it.  With layers of mashed potatoes, beans, pulled pork and slaw, it combines all the perfect sides with the 'que in one handy cup.

The hot link was the worst I've ever had, it had so much connective tissue that I couldn't chew it and ended up looking like the clown with the never ending scarf being pulled out of my mouth (eeewwww, and not attractive, right???),  The coleslaw was fairly flavorless; as I would eat it the heat would gradually build but nothing other than that.

Husband had the pit special; brisket, pulled pork, spare ribs, hot link, hush puppies, mac & cheese, and collard greens.  He agreed with my assessment on the brisket and the hot link.  He liked the hush puppies but felt the mac & cheese and the collard greens were WAY over cooked and lacking flavor.

Brisket: Top-notch. Moist, flavorful, well-smoked. A delight.
Ribs: Split verdict. I thought they were great, wife finds beef ribs a bit too chewy but admitted the flavor was great.
Hot Links: Excellent. Spicy and flavorful.
Pulled Pork: A bit dry and not up to the standard set by the other meats. That said, there sure weren't any leftovers.

Sauce: Pretty ordinary, really. Not bad, though, and the meats don't need its help, so it actually works pretty well in a supporting role.

Beans: Fantastic. Almost like a bowl of chili. You could make a meal out of these alone.
Potato Salad: Maybe the best ever. Bacon really does make everything better.
Cole Slaw: Unique and original, but didn't really work for us. The only real misfire in an otherwise exceptional meal.

This is a really good barbecue joint, bordering on greatness. When you factor in its unexpected location, it probably deserves five stars.

The meat, 2 out of 3 were outstanding.  The hot links are great and made in house.  The pulled pork was as good as I've had in Vegas. Didn't care as much for the brisket.  I didn't hate it and it was tender, but it just didn't hold up flavor wise to the other meats.

851259,2014-09-01,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Good barbecue is one of the most rewarding finds in the culinary world. First, one has to learn about the place, then one has to hunt it down, then one has to resist the urge to leave... because NO barbecue restaurant worth it's prices boasts the most upscale  atmosphere or structural amenities. 

But then the food comes; and one is suddenly more happy to be sitting at that grubby, sweaty little picnic table than they could have ever anticipated. 

So, that being said, Rolling Smoke Barbecue is the finest quintessential barbecue experience I've had in fifteen years in Las Vegas. 

I learned about Rolling Smoke from one of their newest team-members, ""Chef"" Nick. He's been a close friend of mine for years, and he has been doing an amazing job promoting the business. He greeted me when I came in, too, which was classy. 

The service otherwise was gracious and friendly, the Atmosphere was as modest as barbecue gold mines can get, and the food...

Wow... The food.

The ribs, brisket, and pork I purchased practically melted in my mouth, leaving behind only the subtle texture of the meats' not-so-subtle spice rub; a rub that thankfully doesn't overpower the undeniably robust flavors of the proteins themselves. 

...A flavor that makes it completely understandable that the restaurant is perpetually inundated with a line of hungry patrons. Don't worry - though - the kitchen has it down and they churn out an order every fifty seconds or so.

Oh, and at just over $15 (prior to well-earned gratuity), this barbecue meal is certainly worth the price. 

Please, go check this place out. It will leave you entirely satisfied and grateful that you stuck around.",gnJmqmY3YZoulgMp5muTKg,1,1,5,azeLZVjoBgkQh4GS-CAx6g

This place is amazing. I normally don't have a huge craving for BBQ, but maybe that's just because this town isn't especially known for it's fantastic BBQ. Rollin Smoke definitely changed that part of me. Since I first went there (about 3 weeks ago) I've been back 2 more times with a bunch of different people based on craving for that sweet magical BBQ they serve up. I feel like the more I eat there, the more wizard-like powers I will gain via BBQ sauce. Maybe I'm confusing that with my constant yearning for naps.

It is insanely delicious BBQ. Everything I've had there has been phenomenal. The pork, the chicken, and the burger...which I was unaware was insanely massive. I would recommend having the rest of your day planned for napping if you choose to eat the Outlaw Burger. It is tasty, but it is freaking enormous. It's got to weight a pound in your hands...It's a challenge to eat, but it's so good.

The sides are really great too. I keep trying new ones every time I go because they have a pretty significant list of options, so it's nice to switch it up and not be disappointed ever.

I really loved this place, and I really like the location. I know it's not the most convenient place on the planet, but getting there is easy, and it's kind of buried. Like a little local treasure. Places like these keep me exploring this city for more delicious dishes.

If I had any complaints about this place the only one would be that it can leave you smelling very smokey after you leave for quite some time. Not the worst problem if you're trying to get eaten by bears who like tasty things, but if you're going to a meeting with a new client or something immediately after, I might consider going in with a 'BBQ outfit' if that's even a thing.

We had to go back for round 2 and hit the place up on Saturday April 19th. This time I got the smoked meat loaf and a hot link, the wife got 3 types of ribs, the pork, the baby back and the beef rib. The meat loaf was the best I have ever had, smoked meat loaf is the the only way to make meat loaf, I can't wait to try it in my smoker! The wife's pork ribs were perfect again, but wait the beef rib is the bell ringer! This thing is actually prime rib on a stick (rib) it's about 3"" thick and done perfectly, the smoke ring, bark and flavor are the radical, this is smoked prime rib at its finest. My only dig would be the hot link wasn't cooked enough (luke warm), but the flavor was great. We will be back, every time we are in Vegas, I can't wait!!

On another note you'll be safe at this place, every cop in town eats there. 3 squad cars were in the parking lot when we pulled up and then 3 more showed up when we were eating. I don't know who was covering the streets of Vegas, but they were all eating well! I had to have the tee shirt, way to go Rollin smoke!",kJQB3iFtP4hywkS4UidYKA,1,1,5,gRf6wtfBj2SPWCBtFXiNog

Romans 10
8 But what does it say? ""The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"" (that is, the word of faith which we preach): 9 that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ""Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame."" 12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord over all is rich to all who call upon Him. 13 For ""whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.""",vxrdGO5QVQkRfIU-ds2uyQ,0,0,4,UC02xWw9P3lWvT6wf7HMLA

The sauce itself is good and I liked that they only gave one option, because that's the only one you need. We also had the sides Mac n cheese and jalapeño coleslaw. In my opinion, these two sides can be skipped. Mac n cheese tasted a little too artificially cheesy, and the coleslaw had an overwhelming jalapeño flavor.

I do think I have told at least 15 people about this place since our visit last Saturday.  If that doesnt say how I feel about this place, how about the leftovers that I ate for breakfast the next day.  Yes, I must say this is simply (but not simply stated) the best BBQ I have ever EVER had.

Dont let the location fool you...its part of its finger lickin good charm and you cant beat the smell of pure goodness when you pull into the parking lot.  When we first arrived a couple was leaving voicing that they will be back next year - as they come here every year when they visit Vegas.  I think that says alot too.
...a must have for tourists too?!

We both ordered the sliders-both coming with 3 and you can pick what meat you want.  I had the chicken and the brisket while my man had the chicken, brisket and the hot link sliders.  He said the hot links were his favorite-IF there could even be a favorite.  All of it was totally fab.  For sides we had the waffle fries and the mac and cheese.  The waffle fries were sprinkled with a sweet and salty flavoring that I loved and I'm still craving and wont be satisfied until I have more.  The mac and cheese was super creamy.  I thought it was very good.  Alot of the times mac comes out all dry and coagulated.  Not the case here.  I could literally eat a big bowl of it and call it a day.  ***ehem But I wouldnt recommend it only because there is SO much more important things to savor.  Lets talk about the meat - yes their slogan is that they ""rub their meat"" and however you take it consider that some good lovin (hehe).  The meat is smokey and savory....meat with FLAVOR!  The sauce was perfect (not too sweet, not too thick)-and Im very picky about sauce.   The portions were so huge.  I'm sure the guy thought I was not sure what I was getting into when I ordered the 3 sliders.  I brought home 1 1/2 that was leftover and like I said I think I must have been dreaming about it all night because I did have to dig into that first thing the next morning.  As I opened the box all I could smell was the smokey heavenly goodness and I knew right then it was going to be a good day.

So yeah on Wednesday I was sat down and asked to not be mad.....hmmm yes my man went there for lunch without me.  And YES damn right I was mad.  LOL  Yes, peeps....it is JUST THAT GOOD.

So, at a new barbecue place, I'll always test the pulled pork sandwich.  The true southern test is if the sandwich comes with coleslaw on top of the pork in the sandwich. This place didn't do this! But, upon request, they did add it - but a star is removed for not making this standard. People can't experience a real pulled pork sandwich w/o coleslaw on top. 

Overall, the pulled pork has a great smoky flavor with the required tenderness and no stringiness. Some 'ends' were included - the charred, chewy ends, which is exactly right. The coleslaw was also excellent, as was the standard sauce.  I also had a side of potato salad. I'll admit that there are many types of potato salad, none of which can compare to my mother's, but this potato salad was really, really good.

I'd try it again when the sweet taste of central Texas wasn't so fresh. I might like it better. The combo I ordered also came with a dry burnt bun and I selected the mac & cheese for a side. It was pretty good, but I do prefer a creamier version.

My brother joined me for lunch, he had the baked potato topped with cheese and brisket. His order came out with pulled pork instead. No worries since it was a winner.

I have experienced some joints that do a couple of meats well but fall short on others, this place is knocking it out of the park. Brisket was juicy, pork was tender, sausage had great flavor, and chicken was smoked just right. The ribs tasted fantastic but we're not as juicy as I like, again this was the sampler so I think a slab will be juicier.

Sides of Mac n cheese, hush puppies & bacon mashed potatoes were also delicious. With drinks total came to $45 for a family of 5. They do have 10% coupon on the website. Do not leave Vegas before trying Rollin Smoke!",DGfWxhq5v_74p-f-wFvuhQ,3,2,5,zY8j5B6uY4EQ7BdotyyvdA

With all the favorable reviews, I have to believe that all of Rollin' Smoke's menu items just can't be as bad as that brisket. So I may give them another try to sample some of their other items.

We both ordered the all you can eat ($25 pp) which is good value! Round 1: ribs, 2 orders of hot links, pulled pork, 2 orders of brisket with the jalapeño cole slaw, kicken beans, mashed potato casserole and potato salad.

REVIEW: meat was all tasty except for pulled pork was incredibly dry. Took a lot of extra bbq sauce to enjoy. The hot links are sure tasty with just the right amount of spice. We LOVED the kicken beans that were slightly sweet and savory -- Mmmm! The jalapeño cole slaw is unique and one to at least give a try. 

Round 2: chicken, 2 rib ends, ribs (again) and sides of fried okra, corn nuggets and onion straws. The chicken was juicy but came smothered in sauce which I don't care for. Rib ends were crunchy and had true smoke flavor. The corn nuggets are AMAZING with a sweet inside and perfectly crisp outside. The fries okra came with a side of sauce that complemented it well (sort of a Raising Cane's creamier sauce). The onion straws were average but tasted good.

Luckily for them the 2nd round is smaller (less wastage). We left smelling like smoke and were super stuffed. We are not sure if we will give it another shot or not but we can say that we have been there.",kp4J0Aw6uQ0T2WSn0_uDng,3,1,3,cvdwXW6WVmNtydpwVaNNCw

Quick switch to a sandwich and shared some sides with my friends: hush puppies, corn nuggets, beans & corn bread.  
The beans were a strong disappointment, perhaps because that is one of my favorite parts of good old fashioned Kansas City barbecue.  Here the beans were a little too firm for my taste and the sauce was thin and not quite as flavorful as I would have liked.  The hush puppies were decent, the corn bread was moist but more in the style of a cake batter with a very small amount of cornmeal added.  The fried corn nuggets were ok.
My sandwich was good and the meat was tender, though as others have commented I added quite a bit of BBQ sauce to it.
One aspect I didn't care for was the ""messiness"" in the dining area.  I certainly understand that operating a high volume dining establishment is hard work, especially when the food is messy to eat, but it can be done.

The staff were all super friendly and the customer service was spot on. The location is a little bit out of the way from the Vegas strip, but it is worth the drive and will definitely be coming back again!",fTeBTUgfzadoOhRYvyOXlA,0,0,4,h_kjRwD1EyC-LE6MityFMA

Looking at the good reviews for this place, my group and I decided to come to this place.  The place itself is small so try not to come during the rush for lunch because you won't find a place to sit.  What really did like right off the bat here is that they have a large smoker you can see by the side of the building as you walk in, and you can smell the smoke already! My group ordered a combination platter called The Pit and it came with spare ribs, brisket, sausage and pulled pork.  We also shared the outlaw burger, which eventually stole the show. The sausage had a mild smokey flavor but it was a little dry. Everything else was very moist and tender and had a good smokey flavor.  The pulled pork and brisket were very tender and flavorful and didn't need any sauce.  The ribs were a little tough to eat off the bone I   I thought, and I didn't get any extra spiciness from the rub. And when I tried to kick it up a noth by adding their bbq sauce, It didnt work.  Their bbq sauce is very bland.  It has no spiciness or tang or zing.  Just mildy dressed up tomatoe sauce. The best thing I tasted there was the OUTLAW BURGER.  The baddass big flavor patty, the onion strings, and the tangy mayo were awesome together.  My advice is to come for the Outlaw burge, pulled pork, and the brisket!",5RoN_H0dTqkYDSvO227Maw,1,1,4,AJAVZ4k5aAInQMDxU1dCGw

Upon entering for lunch, we saw that it was pretty busy, though we were only in line for about 5 minutes. We ordered the D's Delicious Sampler ($50) with Bacon Potato Salad and Loaded Mash for the sides. 

The service was pretty good. The food came very quickly and we didn't wait long at all (maybe ~10 minutes, give or take a few). We ordered that party pack because it looked like it'd give us a good taste of what Rollin Smoke BBQ had to offer, and it didn't disappoint. 

I can't say I'm a expert at eating BBQ (with only Lucille's and Phil's for comparison), but my family and I were very pleased with the St. Louis spare ribs. The meat was very tender and came right off the bone. The sauce, which we got on the sides, were pretty decent. Out of the possible 4, one of the best ones were the Sweet Country Girl and Mama's Sweet D-Licious; they weren't like your run-of-the-mill BBQ sauce. The Spicy sauce and the vinegar were mediocre, so we didn't get too much of those. The sides were very good too, though we never had the chance to finish them.

For a family of 4 (parents and two 18+ men), I was surprised that the $50 party pack filled all of us up, even to where we couldn't finish the sides. And I daresay we had quite an appetite already.

I did a cross country roadtrip where I was able to sample BBQ from some of the best southern BBQ joints I could find -- and Rollin Smoke BBQ is amazing! Not as good as Texan bbq, but this is just as close to the Lone Star state it'll get! WAYYYYYYYYY better than Famous Dave's. Oh boy, do I hate Famous Daves -- such an insult to BBQ.

Atmosphere -- super laid back, picnic table, and family style. Very casual dining. 

Boyfriend and I shared a 4 meat platter, we had: RIBS, BRISKET, CHICKEN, and PULLED PORK. We went a bit crazy with the sides because we wanted to try everything -- loaded mashed potatoes, hush puppies, mac and cheese, cole slaw, onion rings, and waffle fries.

Everything was so good! My favorite was the pulled pork, it was seasoned really well and so tender. Close second -- the bbq chicken. SUPER JUICY! The brisket was melt in your mouth, a bit over seasoned for me. Ribs were okay, not the best I've had ever, but were good. 

All sides taste home made. My favorite were the hush puppies, mac and cheese (SO CREAMY), and loaded mashed potatoes. 

I kept seeing people order the Outlaw burger. ONLY SMOKES! It's humungus! Definitely trying that next time I come back! 

All in all -- bf and I are super excited to have a bbq joint we love and can bring family/friends to! We will definitely be coming around whenever we are near the strip. Definitely a must try if you are in the area!",zLd_95bDEo8Wo-Ca7u54_g,3,2,5,fjo7gpInZwbOzcBhNjpeNQ

1126374,2012-10-24,2,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"My quest for excellent non-chain restaurants continues, and finding this one was a happy accident.  There are large smokers in the parking lot which is originally what drew our attention to the place.  Usually we find our gems from Yelp, but this time it was a drive-by (or I should say that I find places on Yelp as the bf is in the food industry and like many industry people has a baseless grudge against Yelp).  

Since i am not a huge meat eater what I really care about are the sides.  The sides were amazing.  Which is great because a lot of times at BBQ places the focus is on the meat only and the sides are kind of an after thought.  The peach cobbler was insanely good.  And I have been dreaming about the loaded mashed potatoes since I had them.  I also had the mac n cheese.  The waiter (who I assume is also one of the owners since he thanked us about 20 times for coming in) recommended the mac n cheese.  Listen if you can't execute a delicious mac n cheese you should throw yourself off a bridge.  It's macaroni, cheese, cream and bake.  It was really good but I was more impressed with the other sides that are nonstandard and were amazing.  On my next visit I plan on trying the banana pudding.    

It does have its advantages and disadvantages, depending on who you are.  It is right down the street from the Rhino - a disadvantage to me, but an advantage to any dirt-bags.  The parking lot is kind of sketchy, again a disadvantage to me, but like home to dirt-bags.  The BBQ sauce is really peppery.  I personally like milder sauces and I am not a big meat eater, but I could still appreciate the execution of the sauce and that it was made in house.  I am not used to eating smoked meat so was a little concerned that the chicken looked pink, but the bf explained to me that that is how smoked meat should look that has actually been smoked in a smoker and not just marinated in smoke ""flavor"".  All the meat was very tender, but the sauce was a little too intense for me.  That being said I was more than happy to stick with the sides.",9JKxJZV5r3maeG6uG_2VHw,5,3,5,0eUkAfvKJ216xNMziD6pJQ

The Good-

I love that this place is in a small little strip mall that is off the strip. Its Decorated nicely. I didn't catch the ladies name that took our order but her customer service was top notch! The prices for the food were where they should be with the exception of desert. Their BBQ sauce is to die for. The portions were good sized also. The sweat tea was on point. 

The Bad- 

We ordered burnt ends. Our expectation was that they would be somewhat burnt. They weren't. The first order was pretty fatty and not really burnt at all. We sent them back. What came back was a tad bit better. Ultimately they were just too fatty. I know that you will get fat with burnt ends but typically it is balanced by the burnt more chewy part of the meat. Unfortunately they didn't meet our expectation. We ordered a side of loaded mashed potatoes to go along with the meal. I feel like they were instant with a possible potato mashed up in them. They weren't terrible but they certainly weren't great. The only other comment I have is that she should find another place for the drink station and condiment stand. It is in the main room that also houses the checkout which makes it very congested when trying to get something to drink, utensils, or leaving the restaurant. 

Over all I gave it 3 stars which I thought was fair. I would give it a whirl once more time but would try some other meat entrée.",FplU4P9iDYFeI90alc9orw,1,0,3,zEZTlB5v87eYJ9Ttb8bDDQ

We both found the brisket to be moist and tender with a great flavor and just the right amount of smoke.

Slider trio with side( picked cole slaw) - meats were pulled pork, sausage and chicken ($11 ?? ) 

Rib combo - beef, st louis and baby included ( $16)

we've yet to try the ribs since the other food filled us up !

The meatball sammie was actually 3 sliders - each had cheese and a decent sized, dense meatball drowning in a very spicy sauce - loved it ! 

The trio sliders - also spiked with the spicy bbq sauce - loved the pulled pork and the sausage - would've preferred brisket for the 3rd slider ( probably could've had if i asked ) - large pile of meat on each slider;  smoky goodness - all good !

As usual, the sides complimented the meat perfectly.

1160480,2017-04-20,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,There aren't many BBQ joints in Vegas.  But I wasn't impressed.  Maybe because it was near closing time but they were out of green beans and Mac N Cheese and to make up for it they gave us extra helpings of onion rings.  Nothing was fresh.  The onion rings had been sitting around so they were oil drenched.  The cornbread was dry and pasty.  The baby back ribs were also very dry which made it taste like jerky.  I got a 1/2 pound of the burnt tip brisket and this item was also drenched in oil.  All this resulted in some sleep depriving acid reflux and searching for some antiacid medication   Look I don't really care but when you're paying 34$ just for the two meat items and the total bill coming to over 50$!  This place just wasn't worth it.  I thought with more than 2000 reviews I shouldn't have run into problems like this.  Is was highly dissatisfied and disappointed!

The brisket itself was pretty good. The BBQ sauce wasn't that great at all though. 
I would pass on the sliders because the bread was so greasy that I ended up just taking the meat out and tossing the bread. The beans were great. A bit spicy, but I love spice. The Mac and cheese & the cornbread were pretty good also.

By doing this, you are able to sample 2 or 3 of their meats while choosing a side. Their mac and cheese is good and gooey with cheese, but my personal favorite and go-to is their mashed potatoes, which is topped with cheese and a heaping amount of bacon bits. As for their meats, you really need to try their spare ribs and brisket. They are both super tender; cutting into the brisket is like cutting into butter. And for the ribs, the meat just falls of so easily.

The moment our Uber driver dropped us off we were like ""I didn't know Las Vegas has a Compton"".  The area is near the freeway underpass with a few homeless people that were probably previous high rollers.  I know because I lost $80 and felt like I on the cusp of feeling homeless myself.

We walked in and noticed we were the only Asians.  This is unusual since we've never felt like this living in San Ho.  If something were to go down I know their Ghetto Fu is no match for my martial art skills.  Besides, all these guys probably has clogged arteries anyways so I proceeded to order some food to share with my girl.  

We ordered the brisket and beef ribs with a side of their potato salad.  The brisket was quite dry and my clothes had more of smoke ring from the casino than the meat.  The beef rib, although quite large and meaty was also quite fatty and only slightly better.  I just doused it in their BBQ sauce and called it good.  Surprisingly the best part of the meal was actually their potato salad.  It was creamy and topped with plenty of crispy bacon bits.

Not quite representative of the Yelp 4.5 star experience that I expected.  It's about as good as BBQ from a cafeteria.",C1suecKrUtbxbPnma2KMMQ,9,4,3,RA7h2FqDSWxaALQPaifLyw

The place is not that big but it is full of people.  It smells great inside... something you would expect in a bbq joint.  You pick a table then go to the guy where you can place your order and pay.  They will then bring you your food.  Drinks and utensils are self served.  

The menu is filled with great selection of yummy food. We ordered the following (our eyes were bigger than our stomach for sure):

1) The Pit Special (4 choices of meat + 3 sides) -  We picked the brisket, pulled pork, double on the spare ribs, corn nuggets, bacon potato salad & mac & cheese.  The brisket was disappointing coz it was dry. The pulled pork has great flavor. The ribs is perfect! I love love the ribs... glad we doubled up on this.  The corn nuggets and bacon potato salad are amazing!  The mac & cheese is ok, had better.

2) Meatloaf + corn bread for his side - my son loved this one. The meat taste great but the onion rings are overpowering for me (not a big fan of onions). Now the corn bread is to die for!  It's moist and totally delish... one of the best that I've had. 

3) Chicken Wings (Buffalo) + Waffle Fries - my husband loved the hot sauce but he said the wings was alright (he had the hot sauce on the side). The waffle fries was not bad but it wasn't great either.

4) Banana Pudding - this was disappointing for me. It taste like it came out of a package. 

Overall, this place is definitely a keeper for us.  We are all looking forward on coming back to try the other food on their menu.  The price is not bad, food is great, ambiance is casual & food servings are good size.",kjNbCZ0Le3IDGk7RMZZ93g,5,1,4,khc2piBVjbtaCB6CoUbanw

I had the pulled pork sandwich and, unfortunately, had small chunks of bone in it. Nothing huge, but come on...that's not supposed to happen. The meat is tasteless and you are forced to douse with sauce to get any meaningful flavor. 

Also, the prices are pretty steep. You get the pulled pork sandwich for just under $10 (not a problem), but then you must pay an extra $4 for combo/drink (problem)! So, lunch for one person is nearly $15! Too much for BBQ.

Good proximity to the strip, though. However, the area can be sketchy at night.

The place had a large amount of people, but the wait wasn't long at all. This isn't a sit down and get served type restaurant. It's more of an order at the counter and pick where you want to sit joint; a style that is very appropriate for a BBQ place in my opinion. 

We had a party of three so we got to see a decent amount of the menu. My boyfriend got the talked about Outlaw Burger and it was HUGE! Only 12 bucks for the combo, which includes a drink and a side. It comes with a ton of onion strings and an optional sauce if you want to kick up the heat. 

As for myself, I got the Brisket Sandwich Combo($11).
For my side, I got the corn nuggets which were absolutely delicious! I tried a sample in line and it was love at first taste. As for the sandwich, it definitely was good but could have used more sauce. 

Our other party member got the sausage link combo($11) with mac and cheese. He wasnt digging the sausage sandwich but I think he wasn't in a sausage mood, unfortunately. The mac and cheese on the other hand...oh baby! So creamy and delicious. They use shells instead of elbow macoroni which definitely is a strong point for the dish. 

As for the staff, very friendly and made us feel at home.

Overall, everything was amazing! My faves include:
- Corn nuggets
- The Outlaw Burger
- Mac and Cheese

Overall, I would give it a B. I'm not comparing NC BBQ to Vegas BBQ, but some of the side items tasted a bit off and the prices were high.

I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese. I should have noticed the word ""pulled"" pork as it has a different mouth feel than chopped pork. The pork itself was smoky and tender. Long strips of pork inside a hoagie roll. I added coleslaw to the top which was a mistake. The coleslaw (ugh) had chucky bits of cabbage stalk, jalapenos, carrots, corn and I swear I saw bacon in the mix. It wasn't sweet and it wasn't salty; It added nothing to the meal. The mac and cheese on the other hand was delicious. Oddly enough, it tasted like potatoes au gratin I just bought from the store. 

Aside from that awful coleslaw experience I would go back but not to order the pulled pork sandwich. The prices are a bit high and I wish tried something that was just amazing! I will have to go back when they aren't charging full prices such as after 5pm. Perhaps, the ribs and brisket are better.",4vj_0BQeXjCyNB7ESS5mGg,1,0,4,GAEt7TG1pLvdsSevYTRoPw

1409470,2014-03-03,2,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Came here on a rainy friday afternoon with Doriee, at 1pm, hoping to run into the Travel Channel filming crew. We did, but apparently filming started at 11 instead of the posted time of noon (oh well). We met up with Roger, as well as invited one other friend. 

Location, actually not as hard to find as i had thought. Though i had ""scouted"" the place a few days prior, still wasn't hard as some may have said. Coming from Fashion Show or Mel Tourne, taking a right onto industrial, then left at the light, then right again, and you are pretty much there ! 

Restaurant is a little small but lots of seating. Parking wise, decent amount. Unless there was some specific thing going, should be parking avail. 

Upon entry, first thing you see is their huge menu on the wall. Since Doriee was on break and didn't want to eat too much, we decided to share. And being ""marketed"" the beef rib so much by Roger (steak on a stick is what he calls it), we opted to get the Rib Platter Special. Comes with one side and a drink. For the side, we got the corn nuggets ! Or rather Doriee ""excitedly"" shouted corn nuggets XD ! Since she was on her lunch break (1 hour time, but work was close by), we hoped it wouldn't take long. Upon ordering, we were told about 25 minutes. 

Rib Platter Special - $17.99 - 3 Baby Back Ribs, 2 Spare Ribs, and 1 Beef Rib - Ordered with a side of Corn Nuggets. 

To our surprise, it came in about 20 minutes or less. Good on timing !! :D

Pretty big platter. Was definitely a good sharing size between the two of us. Corn nuggets were piled on the side. To our surprise (again), the corn nuggets were pretty good. Corn gave it a nice sweetness and it was nice and crispy ! The sauce it comes with is like a mix between thousand island and like the sauce from Raising Canes. Sweet, little tangy. 

Now the main entree. Ribs. The so-called ""steak on a stick"" was a beef rib that had a lot of meat on it, as well as a pretty thick layer of fat. The meat was not how i imagined it to be. Yes, as the restaurant name suggests, smokey, definitely a lot of smokey flavor (lasted the rest of the day lol!) but the meat broke off like it was stewed meat? I'm not sure if its because beef ribs weren't one of my favorite type of rib or its been too long since i had a beef rib but it was quite disappointing. Flavor was decent but meat texture wise, a little different. Both the baby back ribs and spare ribs were, yet again, smokey, but to our disappointment again, it was quite dry. Would have preferred it to be a little more seasoned/marinated to give it a nice flavor instead the meat but the dryness of the meat kind of made it saddening. Tried to help it with the bbq sauce on the table, but didn't really help. 

The BBQ sauce was a very thin sauce, so if you were to put in on anything, it almost rolls right off. Flavor wise, sweet, tangy, spicy. Not bad but not my favorite either. 

The following two items were ordered by Roger and another friend but im just putting what i SEE :P 

The Outlaw Burger - $8.99 - Brisket, Onion, Bell Pepper, Onion Strings, Red Cabbage Slaw, Lettuce, Tomato, Cheddar Cheese, and Chipotle Aioli

HUGE burger. The burger is, i believed a confirmed 1lb patty with tons of stuff stacked on top. Roger tried to press it down to make it smaller to eat, but to no avail. That burger was DENSE ! Not too much of a burger person but looked pretty good ! Maybe could try, if it was split with someone half n half.. 

Brisket Dog - $8.99 - 1/4 Lb Beef Hot Dog, Brisket, Smothered in Cheese and Onion Strings

I didn't even notice the hot dog in it until after my friend bit into it. Similar to the burger, ingredient filled/stacked. I was actually surprised my friend ate it fairly cleanly without everything falling out and onto the plate. 

Desserts !!!

Southern Peach Cobbler & Country Black Berry Cobber - sweet and flavorful. sauce was very thin and runny. kind of hard to eat (especially if you were sharing. would prefer the sauce to be a little thicker. still pretty good ! 

Mama's Banana Pudding - imagine a bread pudding but instead of bread, its vanilla wafers... with slices of banana and pudding. Yummy dessert :P 

Reese's PB Cup Bread Pudding - soaking in a RUM sauce, the dense but flavorful bread pudding is like hell on a plate. bread pudding usually is already pretty flavorful from it absorbing the heavy cream but in this case, it is a PEANUT BUTTER CUP bread pudding... rich peanut butter taste with a nice rum sauce glaze on top. Prob my fav on the 4 desserts listed. 

Overall. good place. though the ribs were a bit disappointing. Everything else was pretty good. Would like to try other things, like their brisket and such",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,4,3,3,5vPBv1foXQVKEuAG8UMUyg

Can't remember what they chose, but I remember that the sides were loaded mashed potatoes (so good!), baked beans (also delicious) and coleslaw (don't get this, it's sour and kinda flavorless). My mom also ordered a beautiful salad. You don't expect a bbq joint to have great salads, but they did! 

It's nothing fancy inside, and it's very much a little hole in the wall. As most people know, that's where the best food is, so don't be a snob and let the food speak for itself.

Its was a perfect combination of flavors on every bite. You had chunks of different type of meats with the creaminess of the mash and the saltiness of the onions. I also got the mac and cheese(YUM!)

So much I came out licking other peoples fingers (I'm kidding)!! We got the AYCE special for $34.99, and the couple with us got a 2 meat combo plate and added a drink. The total was around $60 for both of us. This is an order at the counter, seat yourself place which I don't mind at all. 

The AYCE special is anything on the menu any day and any time. The menu consists of a plethora of meats, burgers, sandwiches, sides, and desserts. I think we tried pretty much every meat in the place. Ribs, meatloaf, chicken, pulled pork and wings, just to name a few. If you have a hearty appetite, AYCE is the way to go.

For my meal, I got a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and spare ribs, and for the sides, my daughter chose yams, collard greens and, mac & cheese. The food was delicious. I really loved the ribs. They were so tender and meaty and fall off the bone. A good rib needs no sauce, and these did not need any. Speaking of sauce, they have like 5 different bbq sauces, ranging from sweet to spicy. I personally love a good tangy yet sweet based sauce, so I enjoyed their bbq sauce the best. But they have something for everyone. The chopped brisket was yummy too, although I would probably get the brisket sliced next time. The only thing I did not like was the mac and cheese. It was really bland, but they have like 10 other sides to choose from. I can't wait to come back for some more yummy BBQ. Oh yeah, and my family does not do creamed corn at all and neither does Sean (from Mr. Mamas). But he strongly suggested we try them and we did. Oh So Good!!!!

1455114,2016-04-26,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"OK so I went to the electronics store in the same small strip mall with a friend. We decided to try out Rollin smoke. The small Asian gal that took our order did not smile, did not seem friendly, and it was only 11am so not sure why she would be so grumpy so early in the day. I had the catfish po' boy for $12.99. It comes with no sides, with nothing. The sandwich has two pieces of fried catfish, not big and not small, also lettuce, tomato and a yellow mustardy 'tartar sauce'. The fish was mushy, not sure how else to explain it. The lettuce wilty, the tomato over ripe. It also came with sliced onion. The menu does not mention the onion, had it mentioned them, I would have had them removed as I am allergic to onion. Not worth the $13. My friend had the two meat plate for $13.99. He chose the pulled pork and the chopped brisket. His also came with a side so he chose the cheesy mac n cheese. His was all good. Not a lot of meat, not sure it was worth the $13.99 but much closer to being worth the cost than the catfish sandwich was. 
So to recap, do NOT get the fried catfish sandwich. Not worth it, and not that good. The onion taste on the wilty lettuce with mustard instead of real tartar sauce on mushy catfish.... the duo meat plate was not bad. And just deal with the grumpy order taker. As you can see from my reviews, I rarely give a 1 star rating... so listen to it. Better to go to the Big B's in Henderson or the John Mull's Road Kill Grill on Thom blvd in northwest Las Vegas.",dxCce2EdLOAy78Y3fAXCgw,1,0,1,2bExThIqCGjSYxWaROcPew

1462564,2013-06-04,3,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"One word:  Legit.

Being a southerner at heart and also from the DC area - this place is as close as I'm going to get to some straight up dirty BBQ in Vegas.  I would go to this place just to smell the beautiful, and oh so addictive smells and then head off on my merry way.  Mmmmhmmm.

I have to mention the cornbread right away.  No BBQ joint would be official without some fresh cornbread.  They've got it right and tight!  So right, that I ordered a ton of extra to-go for a party I was attending later in the night.  Even more right, that I asked for a sample while ordering..  Sad, but very true.

With all the smells, I was a little overwhelmed on what to order.  I had my sides figured out, but my main plate was hard to pinpoint.  I was experiencing one of those ""eyes are bigger than your stomach"" moments..  Oh wells.  After jostling the idea of ribs around for a few, I kept it real and went with the Beef Brisket.  Ribs are tricky and I'm incredibly picky, so I needed to start slow.  :)  No regrets there.  Flavorful and plenty to eat for leftovers.  They offer a few selections on the amount of grub you order, which was neat in my book.  Now, back to the ribs...  They have a variety to choose from cooked according to whatever region in the states.  Loved that!   Next trip:  RIBS!

As far as sides go, I was also a little overwhelmed in this department as well.   Never overwhelmed in a bad way.  I went all out with the fattiest of the bunch and had the Mac 'n' Cheese, Loaded Mash Potatoes and the Bacon Potato Salad.  Yes, BACON.  POTATO.  SALAD.  #WINNING!

The service was friendly and they even complimented me on being so small but yet ordering so much.  ""Is this all for you?""  ""Hell yeah it is.. C'mon now!""  

Coolest part about this joint (other than the food, of course):  They deliver AND offer party packages where they'll actually wheel their smoker to your party and hook....you....up!   Whaaaaa?! 

Rollin Smoke has my foodie heart forevs!  

**This is a popular joint, which means.. lines, lines, lines.  Try to skip the food rush and go during a slower time of the day!  Don't get me wrong though, the long lines are worth it in the end.",0uo7LHVMFaDf1PkcGZprNg,3,3,5,TLjT9gtcwZn8SPCyZv8s3A

No hi or hello, it was like we were annoying her. She treated everyone like this so I didn't feel singled out. We got our food, brisket sandwich and pulled piggy sandwich. I felt like the meat could only be saved by drowning it in sauce. Mac and Cheese and Cornbread was good, but I wanted great BBQ and it came up short. The restaurant is a weird layout too. If it's a cold day sit in the inner portion of the restaurant. The area by the order counter is by the door which never closes. Even the employees won't shut it when they go in and out, so it can get cold while you are eating.

 The next day we tried to call in a large order but the phone went straight to voice mail so it took a while to get our food and when questioned how much longer, they made rude comments to us.  We have received good service in the past but the owner was working during that visit and this time he was out doing a BBQ competition.

If anyone is hesitant about the area,  don't be.  You can smell the smoky goodness down the block and it will draw you in like the crack den of BBQ that it is.

This is a family run hole in the wall and the plastic cutlery atmosphere suits it.  We sat in the mural covered back room, our first hint that the owners hailed from Arkansas.  We didn't even know that Arkansas ""did"" BBQ, my who knew concerning that state began and ended with the now Vegan Bill Clinton; little did I suspect that I would be in for a presidential Q.

We arrived around 3:00, as they close at 8:30 PM Monday-Thursday and made our way to the back room before we placed our order at the podium in the front room.  And here comes a niggle-most of the tables were not wiped down and nor would they be for some time after we arrived.  I don't mind lolling around in my own juicy, fat and Q juice runoff, but I'm not a fan of cleaning up someone else's.  Niggle two was a less than pristine bathroom.  I'm hoping that all this was due to the time of day, more than a recurrent daylong drawback.

We both ordered the $24.95 all you can eat, so we could sample a greater number of things and graze off of each other's plates.  We placed our order with John (one of the owners) I was trying to gauge the amount of food that we would be getting and he thought my beef rib order would be a bit too much, but I let him know I was a good little eater.  I may be short, but I do have some amazing chow down capacity.

We then prepared ourselves for a leisurely wait, eagerly sniffing in the smoke fumes.  There were only two diners in our room, and one of them decided to share his phone Gangsta Rap at mega-volume, I stopped sniffing at the air and unleashed a very annoyed and loud ""REALLY!?!?!"" but it wasn't until his food arrived (fortunately quickly) that this rude dipshit lowered his personal jukebox.

Then our meal arrived and the gluttonous food orgy began.  For sides we had the corn bread, fried onion straws, greens, corn nuggets-all contenders for a pure outstanding deliciousness award, some tasty curly fries and a ok roll.  For meats we had pulled pork, hot links, beef ribs, pork ribs, rib tips-all perfectly smoked and overwhelmingly delectable.  The chicken and brisket were good and the sauce was nicely spiced not too sweet. We ate till it hurt; leaving the final stretch of mass stomach expansion for dessert, a tasty berry cobbler and banana pudding.

Halfway through my cobbler I hit my max and gave up.  If we could have lolled around and napped we might have been able to finish, or explode.  I stopped short of saving a well picked bone to save and use as a Pebbles Flintstone hair clip just so I could savor that smoky goodness for the rest of the day.

Recently I placed a take out order. The guy on. The phone was very pleasant but he forgot to add a few things to my order. I wasn't charged so it wasnt a big deal. 

hey are always out of the beef ribs. I've heard they are delicious. Hopefully one day I'll get to try them. 

Bbw chicken. It's not a whole chicken. It's 8 separate pieces. Very tasty and moist. 

They were also out of the baked potato the night we ordered 

Brisket.  I ordered 2 lbs to make up for the lack of beef ribs. The brisket was dry and had a very bad after taste that made it taste like old meat that had been. I tried to mask it with the delicious sauce but I couldn't. It wasn't the smoke flavor. It just tasted like old meat that should have been thrown out. 
The brisket has a very light smoke ring. Little to no bark. It was definitely not winning any awards. 

The sides were all ok. Nothing is ever crave but decent. 

I asked them for a variety of sauces but they only included one type. 

I'd go back but only because I'm still want to try the ribs.   The brisket was one of the worst I've ever had.  (Two pounds ended up in the trash). The chicken was good but over priced in my opinion.",_UwZg-ztV7gc9u0zsRSHxA,0,0,2,-5dd5XW00ficoakFPtfpbQ

Rollin Smoke is so good at smoking their meat that they slice their brisket on the thick side, but the slices are still perfectly tender. It takes some serious smoking talent to be able to pull that off. 

We tried their smoked meatloaf (with brisket in the meatloaf mix), spare ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. All were fantastic. Sides we tried were greens and mac-and-cheese, and it was clear they take pride in their sides as well. 

This is a small place in a small strip-mall off the Vegas strip just east of the I-15 freeway. If you blink while driving by you might miss it. You order at a podium then go find a seat and they bring your food out to you. We were there at 4:30 PM on a Tuesday and there was no wait and ample seating available, but it's easy to see how Rollin Smoke might get very crowded and seating might be hard to come by during peak times. Parking might be challenging during peak times as well. 

The prices they charge for their food represent an exceptional value in a tourist town like Las Vegas. For the price of a fancy appetizer on the strip you can have a 3-meat platter with a side and a drink. What a find!",j_TSUybr0hoAu7r_wyehEg,1,1,5,7Qijl0ddHX3wxfQBHiiZHg

We got the pit special, outlaw burger, Mac and cheese, kickin beans, loaded mash, onion strings, catfish, and corn fritters! you can just taste the smokiness from the BBQ! so much flavor. 

I loved the kickin beans, it has brisket and has a perfect sweet and spicy kick! 

the catfish is cooked perfectly and is a must, it comes with two sauces, but is also good on it's own. 

the best thing was the corn fritters, OH MY GOD. I don't think a gallon of this would be enough  sweet corn and cheese deep fried nuggets. I could eat this all day. if I had to order one thing only it would be this.

Hubby and I went with a friend to try this place out and left with full tummies and happy faces.

First, ambiance.. it's a tiny place inside an industrial strip mall next to an overpass.. the word ""dive"" was invented for this place, I believe.  Trust me, you won't care.  The new tables inside are nice, though.

Service.. great!

Now for the best part.. the food.  The sides were average to good, but we didn't try a lot of them.  Cole slaw was ""interesting"", mac n cheese was ""okay"", baked beans were ""good!"" .. but we forgot those as soon as we bit into our meats.

I had the pulled pork sandwich, the ""Piggy"", which came with a side and a drink.  The sandwich was enormous.. first thing I did was cut it in half for taking home half of it.  Then I bit into it and all my taste buds jumped up and did a cheer.  It was the most incredible pulled pork I've ever had.  Superlatives abound.. juicy, tender, meaty, saucy, omg nom nom nom.  I'll be honest.. that other half never stood a chance of going home, I ate it all.

Hubby couldn't decide so he got a half rack each of the baby back pork ribs and the beef ribs.  He was exclaiming about how incredible the pork ribs were and then he tried the beef, completely forgot the pork was there.  He's definitely a beef ribs guy, always prefers those, and found a level of beef rib heaven he hadn't known existed.  And the size of those beef ribs?  Definitely brontosaurus sized, massive amount of meat on each rib.  

Our friend got ""The Biggin"" sandwich and the brisket sandwich.  He devoured the Biggin and was making lots of strange noises, occasionally coming up for air to proclaim the food amazing.  The brisket arrived a bit later, and brought out a new level of attention - he said it was as tender as a pulled pork sandwich and we all were amazed that there was moist and tender brisket, because every other bbq joint manages to dry the meat out.  Since he has two hollow legs, he ate every bite of both of those monster sandwiches.

The prices are cheap, the food is amazing, and it's probably good that they're not located closer to home ;D.  I'm willing to bet that the Pitmaster there gets marriage proposals on a daily basis, because of his great food.

I ordered the mixed rib platter minus the babies, and instead subbed another beef rib. To round out my meal was the loaded mash and I added some greens. I won't be hungry again until at least this time tomorrow!!

Rollin' Smoke's rub compliments the flavor of both the beef and spare ribs nicely. I added a little of their spicy BBQ sauce because I like my BBQ to have a bit of a kick. The spareribs were perfect and the beef ribs were very impressive. Smokey but not overpowering. Dusty came to my table and asked how everything was, and I couldn't compliment him enough. He shared his technique on how he preps the beef ribs. I guess I'll be back, because I certainly don't have that kind of patience!!

I have been smoking my own meats for months so I wanted to compare what I am doing to what they are doing. My uncle from Casper loves the place so I wanted to see wassup. I have smoked prime rib, ribs, chicken, steaks, potatoes, onions, and pork butt using mostly apple wood. I asked the waiter what kind of wood my St. Louis style ribs were smoked on and he said ""I honestly don't know"".  I was disappointed with that answer BUT one minute later he came back and told me ""hickory"".  I will be using hickory on my next 6 hour rib smoke because it is soooo delicious. I saw a review talking shmack about no smoke ring. ""More of a smoke ring on my clothes than the meat"". That is BS. See photos. I ordered the half rack of St. Louis style because I have cut racks in half at home and figured I could eat all that. I was wrong. There was way more meat than I could eat for sure. Plus the bomb ass corn nuggets were irresistible. They were playing the Vegas Golden Knights game when we were there. I watched the Golden Knights tonight while eating heated up left over ribs under the broiler. Go Knights!!!  And some people complained about the location.  What??!! I know ghetto and the place is off the strip but it is NOT ghetto or unsafe or ""Compton"" or whatever haters be saying while sipping Haterade. I didn't feel unsafe at all.

The pulled pork is tender moist and succulent. The ribs were delicious flavorful and not even close to being dry. Lets get going to the sides.  the chipotle coleslaw was flavorful but not overly creamy. Just the way I like it! The dirty rice was fantastic combination of rice ground beef red onion and something else I couldn't tell what it was.

Located in an area known for plumbing supplies, auto repair, strip bars and this that or the other thing and BBQ!?  RSB was a totally unexpected ""Hump Day"" treat.  It was the rave upon our return to the office.

 The outside upon initial glance may look greasy spoonish but this is by no means the case. The inside was comfortable with seats to spare.  It has a contemporary look inside but the smell and hospitality which leaves no doubt that this is serious BBQ.  That and the large smokers out in the parking lot.

I went with the ""Spudastic"" a baked potato filled with beef brisket and smothered with cheese and sour cream.  I combo'd the meal ordering as my side the jalapeño coleslaw and refreshing sweet tea.  It was pure joy to eat.

The ten of us dining while marveling the smoked pieces of brisket, pulled pork and sausage on a lone picnic  table outside in what is almost December...INCREDIBLE!

I haven't had much barbecue out here and was skeptical of how good barbecue could be, but yes, there is good barbecue in Las Vegas.

I've only been twice and both times I got their duo plate.

With these plates you get the option to choose from: Brisket, hot links, spare ribs, 1/4 chicken, and pork.

I got the brisket and hot link.

The brisket is very juicy and you can see the beautiful smoke ring around the edge of the meat. 

The hot link has a nice snap to it and is definitely one of my favourite parts of the meal. 

Along with the meat you get an option of a side and I've gotten the mac n cheese and the potato salad.

The mac n cheese was alright, nothing too special, but I do love their potato salad. It's creamy and the potatoes are still firm. It's a nice refreshing taste when eaten with the rest of the meal.

The location is a little off the beaten path, but it is worth searching for. My husband and I came in late on a Friday Night, close to closing. The staff was very friendly and the wait for our food was painless. We ordered a rib special platter that came with baby back ribs, Louisiana style ribs, and one pork rib. Everything was fall of the bone tender and so buttery. Plus, it wasn't doused in bbq sauce. The spices were enough to carry the meat without it having to be swimming in sauce. When we were finished, I was disappointed that there wasn't more! Haha. We had banana pudding for dessert and it ended the meal on a great note. The only negative thing I can say is that the platter we ordered came with a side and toast. We had bacon potato salad that didn't stand out very much and we also got a piece of toast, which was just that: a piece of sliced toast. It was a little underwhelming. This being a BBQ joint, I was expecting something a little bigger like Texas toast maybe. But the real show stopper of course is the meat and thinking about the meat makes me forget about the sides.

Pulled Pork Sandwich combo: I was pressured to get hush puppies, which were good for hush puppies (they have a little zing/spice to them from the jalapeño they mix in which made them better than average). As far as the pulled pork, it was some of the best I've had (although fattier than what I've had recently) however the bun it was served on left much to be desired. It was a hoagie type roll with sesame seeds, so the pork was trying to soak through the seem. Thankfully the sandwich didn't last long enough for me to make a huge mess of it. 

Meat Duo: brisket and pulled pork. Jason said he's had better brisket, and prefers Memphis (cause he's a square!) but the pulled pork was good. 

Check in dessert: Butterfinger Bread Pudding: it was tasty, good texture for a bread pudding- I would probably order a regular bread pudding if they were on special when we come back.

We both really liked the sauces they offer on the table (we tried the spicy and sweet sauces) and the service was friendly. They were definitely happy to have gained our business and made sure we really enjoyed our food.

BBQ beef ribs 

I like the casual restaurant vibe, they bring you your food but it's pretty quick and easy to eat and go. Prices are reasonable-hope they don't change. 


On to the negative-brisket and pulled pork was almost identical. One of them was dry and I forgot which one. One was good. Guess I should have remembered.  The mac and cheese was nothing special. BBQ beef ribs was burnt one time and small the next time. Collard greens-just ok.

Look i was just galavanting doing life, i was gon' get right back. Anyways no introduction needed, but you in the presence of Soapy Knuckles whatever whatevers, aka Brisket Baron Davis, aka Steak Fries Steelo, aka the Baby Back Boss Hawg back with that heat rock for ya and today we talkin Rollin' Smoke BBQ in Vegas.

First off this joint not on the strip, so to get there i had to cross the red sea, commune with a tibetian monk, and solve like 50eleven riddles just to grace their doorway with my presencr. Once you get there tho, aint no games are to be played. You know this place real cause all the cats who work their look they been through some thangs in life, and put all that love, heartbreak, triumph, and disappointment into the meat they chef up for you. I don't want to taste no ones bbq that aint been the storm and the rain. Every bite of the rib tips felt like an intrusion into a therapy session... but like a session where they had delicious life changing bbq, and overly accommodating people. 

I got the trio-meat plate, which was wild ambitious cause between the beef rib, spare ribs, rib tips, and greens w/brisket i didnt have room for my peach cobbler (but you damn right i ate it, cause momma aint raise no quitter). The best thing was the rib tips, the fat to meat ratio was perfect, cause literally felt like you threw it in your mouth and it started melting. The sauce? Pro tip: Mix the arkansas sweet and the spicy, i call it the femme fatale. It does a fantastic job of letting the meat talk that cash, but also making a statement on its own. The beef rib tasted like dreams fulfilled. Like if you could be Tom Brady for a day... minus the butt chin and being unable to dance and being a cheater and having to live in Boston... okay so nothing like Tom Brady, but you get the point. 

This is what two straight 5 Durag reviews from me? *checks to see if Trump still in office* nope, nevermind im not dreaming and neither are you. Look man, i had to come through and give yall something to chew on. Go there, eat it all and tell em the Villainous one sent you.

I'm not going to get into the debate of Texas vs. Carolina vs. Arkansas vs. wherever.  You've seen those charity ads with the tagline ""Hunger knows no borders?""  Well, as far as I'm concerned, good BBQ knows no state lines.  If you insist upon knowing however, an Arkansas flag hanging inside provides a clue as to their roots.

As others have remarked, this place is located off the beaten track, and easy to miss.  Even with the GPS bleating at me and the smell of the smokers wafting through my windows, I blew by it and had to circle back.

The shopping center it is located in is a bit down-at-heel, but not dangerous.  Walk through the door and there is a podium at the back of the room with an ""Order Here"" sign.  It may be unattended, but there is a hotel desk-bell to help you get their attention.  

There is a nice selection of dishes, sandwiches, platters, and combos, so you should be able to find something however small or large your appetite.  

The BBQ is excellent.  Thoroughly smoked flavor; not dried out.  They provide sauce, but it really doesn't need it.

The bbq does have a nice smoke ring I give it that, thin pink line, crisp crust, easily pulls off the bone. The bbq hickory smoke aroma in the air is intoxicating and draws  you into this place!  Taste wise it's good, not great. I've had better bbq with better spice rub mix and sauces.  

First impression was a hit for the ribs, a miss for the brisket. It was not as moist like our favorite place. Our recent returns here have been good. Although sometimes the ribs are a tad dry. It could be because we got the ones left in the warming trays longer. 

They did a nice job expanding the dining area. As far as picnic bench seating; it's great if you are with a large party and you take up the majority of the table. But when you have to share a table with strangers that have no table manners or have poor hygiene, it puts a damper on my dining experience. 

The price they charge for what you get is great! That is always the highlight of conversations I've had with other diners and why another reason this place rates high on here. It's cheap!

I asked for the trio meal, with brisket, pork and baby back ribs, but they refused me.  They said they could add the baby backs to the duo meal for an extra $6.  Not wanting to get off the ""high"" of quitting my job, I relented.

This time I asked for no greens and they obliged.  When the meal came, the food was cold. (It was about 7:30pm; they close at 8:30.)  I tried not to let it get me down.  The $6 baby backs amounted to exactly two (2) bones.  And I'm not even quite sure I got the baby backs, because they were meaty and chewy (and cold), resembling St. Louis ribs (which I could have gotten at a discount).  Anyway, that's not my biggest complaint.  This time, for some reason, I found the BBQ sauce to be very spicy.  I don't recall it being spicy the first time around (otherwise, I would have marked it down).  So for those of you keeping count -- I recommend the brisket and the pork but NOT the ""baby back ribs"" -- and also, come here during lunch, when the food is presumably fresher and hotter.

Pulled Pork (Oh so tender)

Me?  although i love a juicy $50 steak someone else is paying for, when i spend my own money, i love to find treasures like RSB.

A hole in the wall that you need to travel off strip for in the industrial district, but, ROLLIN SMOKE BARBEQUE is well worth the effort!.  

The menu is pretty simple but with a wide variety of options.  I asked for a suggestion and was told the brisket and rib plate with slaw.  FABULOUS choice!

The brisket was tender and thinly sliced.  The subtle smoke flavor was deep in the meat.

The ribs fell right off of the bone with just the right amount of sauce to compliment the meat.

The slaw was fresh and spicy and had some corn in it to add to the flavor.

Team was friendly.  The place was clean.

If you are looking for a burger, i saw one being delivered to a table that looked incredible.

Lizelle, the cashier,  was friendly and helpful if it is your first time. Ask anything on the menu. Service was also attentive. Both Lizelle and Karina were making rounds, cleaning up spills on floors, and checking that everyone was doing well. 

Seating was on picnic tables which I thought was pretty cool.  Different sauces to try and generous if you're taking some to go too. The sweet sauce is like honey mustard, but even their default BBQ sauce is a safe bet for extra flavor. To go boxes and plates are on the counter next to cutlery. It's pretty  easy to get what you need.

I noticed their prices increased since last time I was here which was pretty disappointing though (minus a star) . BBQ is always gonna be a bit pricey, but is it worth it? I say, ""try it."" Trio plate is a safe bet, and for me, it was good for two people. Ribs, sliced brisket, and pork, a side, and a slice of white bread for $17.99. Old menu prices were much more reasonable and would've kept me coming back.

No, I'm not talking about all those strip clubs in the vicinity, I mean lip-smacking delish Southern-style BBQ at Rollin Smoke BBQ!  And by smoke, I don't mean the big dispensary that recently opened up nearby either!

I had some relatives flew in for the SEMA car show and they texted us to meet up for lunch.  They picked Rollin Smoke due to the sheer number of Yelp Reviews (2000+) and 4.5-star average!

I am no BBQ connoisseur; however I really liked the food we ordered.  The pit special came with 5 meats including spare ribs (which my wife loved),  pulled pork, chopped brisket, smoky sausage and skin-on, bone-in chicken with very juicy meat.  I liked how everything was seasoned and lightly sauced if at all.  After all, they have lots of options for sauces for you, ranging from sweet, vinegary, tangy, to downright hot and spicy!

The other excellent aspect are the sides.  The Collard Greens were perfect - just bitter enough, while the yams were sweet.  The surprise dish and everyone's favorite were these sweet corn fritters that was a hybrid between a tater tot and cream corn.

The sliders trio was also okay- it comes with your choice of meat.  Franky, its probably better to stick to getting more ribs or other items ala carte.

The fiancé and I love good BBQ places and saw that Rollin Smoke Barbeque has beef ribs, not that common where we're from so we knew we had to splurge and substitute for them! We opted for the trio choice of 3 meats: beef ribs, spare ribs & brisket (sliced instead of chopped). This was $17.99 + $6 sub for the beef ribs & it came with cornbread and a side - we chose the bacon potato salad. 

Our food came out super quick and was a big portion, definitely enough for 2 people. The bacon potato salad was so good! The beef rib (only one rib) was disappointing because it was immensely fatty and the brisket (~5 pcs) was even worse because it was sooooo dry. Brisket is supposed to be tender with an amazing smoke ring but theirs failed at both. The spare ribs (2 pcs) were good but didn't fall off the bone. I liked the bbq sauce, not super thick like some places. Corn bread was meh, if you like light and cake-like then this is for you. I like mine super crispy at the top.

Brisket reminded me of Spam, ribs didn't really have a taste, and the mac & cheese must've been made with sour cream because it was a little too creamy with a weird taste. The kickn beans were bland and undercooked. The hot links I'm guessing Hoffy or Bar S? Yuck. And guess wat? I decided to go all out and order desert. Peach cobbler! Ugh more like bland peach cake!

All were good but I have had better in terms of texture (a little on a dry side for me) and a little on the flavor (minus 1 star). The really got the smokey part down where the brisket leaves the deep red rim below the charred tip.

For sides we got:
corn nuggets -  which was yummy as I never had something like it
collard greens - i loved it as it wasn't too greasy or cooked with bacon. Instead they used pieces of the smoked brisket to cook it in. Delicious and less guilty to eat.
fried okra - never thought this was good but it actually was. 
I wanted corn on a cob as one of the sides but they didn't have any which is the first I've heard at a bbq but since their other choices are good, i wont complain. 

Cost: Very descent. For our 4 choice sampler, 3 small sides and a soda to share ALL for $19.99!! I'm happy with that! 

Seating: Majority are in a big benches. Which you may have to share if it gets crowded. So for some you don't like sharing go when its not prime time or learn to be people friendly. 

Parking: Good amounts of parking but not a lot. Location is good for the boys who loves strip clubs because this bbq joint is near and surrounded by most of them.",qpActPt-ts9RRiZvn0n2KA,2,2,4,TQl-1IaWhB2l3RakO_1iOA
1866502,2016-07-22,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I had been looking forward to this place after seeing it air on the Food Network, I was surprised at the location to be honest with you. Rollin Smoke is situated in an older industrial commercial area behind the strip, it is easy to get to but can be a bit confusing if you're not from here. It smelled great of course and the place was smaller than I thought, there were people lined up along the wall to place their orders. I ordered the half rack of baby back ribs, 1 pound of brisket and a quart of the BBQ beans to go.
The food was good, the ribs were a bit dry but still moist and the brisket was chopped? I was actually expecting sliced brisket but I guess you have to ask for it sliced. I wasn't amazed but it was good and I will be back for more. The Kicken beans were awesome though, a bit of heat with pulled pork. One thing I did not like was that I had to pay for extra sauce because there was no to go containers for the sauce and the sauce in the dispenser is for those that are dining in only and I was told that I would have to buy extra. The other was that it felt a bit crowded in there especially the main room where there were people eating at the tables while having people waiting for their food hovering over them just seemed a bit uncomfortable for me and that's why I chose it to go. There was no space in the other room because it was packed and the only other option was outdoor seating and that was way out of the question in 106 degree weather.",eda0twS2gUSDdOE1MAtuwg,1,0,4,5PLEeT32u543ghtmSntckw
1867753,2014-09-06,3,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"As with anyone who has been to Vegas a few times, you grow sick of the options on the strip, so one of my goals was to find a few places off the beaten path for us to try this next time around. 

BBQ is really the reason I started yelping and everywhere I go, I usually seek out a BBQ place to try, so when I saw all the positive reviews of Rollin' Smoke, naturally I was a bit excited. 

After our first long night in Vegas, we decided to skip breakfast and hit up Rollin' Smoke for an early lunch. Our cabby didn't know where it was, but it was a fairly quick ride from the strip.

Walking in, you are greeted with a glorious, thick, smoky smell that always accompanies good BBQ. As with all my BBQ reviews, I usually seek out a way to try out most of the meats, so we ordered the three Pit Specials (3 meats, 2 sides) and one order of the Beef Ribs. We quickly realized we ordered too much food for the four of us, but it was no matter, it was all delicious. The meats:

The Pulled Pork - The pulled pork was flavorful and moist, with a moderate smoky flavor. If you like pulled pork, you won't be disappointed by this. 

The Hot Link Sausage - Despite how good the other meats were, the Hot Link made a good run to be one of my favorites. This isn't like most hot links you see which are red in color, both on the sausage meat and on the casing, with that annoying spicy flavor that seems to linger forever. These had a reddish-brown casing and a very delicious and unique flavor too them, with a nice spiciness as well. Definitely recommend. 

The Ribs - The baby backs were delicious. Moist, tender, fall off-the-bone good. They seasoning added some nice flavor as did the moderate-to-strong smokiness. Another awesome dish.

The Brisket - The brisket we were served was from the lean side and had a nice smoke ring to it and despite being from the lean side, was not dry at all. Very solid brisket and only due to the greatness of the other dishes was this our least favorite. 

The Beef Rib - Holy crap, the other reviewers were not wrong. This thing is amazing. It should be called The Flinstone or Brontosaurus Rib. It is massive. It has an amazing bark, strong smokiness, and tons of meat. It wasn't too gristly either, like many beef ribs tend to be. You get two ribs for 15 bucks and you think that is steep until you receive them. That will be more than enough to fill you up. A must order here. 

The Sauce - I think good BBQ can be graded as to whether it needs sauce, and the BBQ here stands on its own. However, the sauce was pretty good if you like sauce. The rust-colored sauce starts out sweet and ends tangy and is fairly runny too. It is great for dipping and doesn't overpower the  meat. 

So the 4.5 star rating for Rollin' Smoke is spot on and consider this to be a 4.5 star review to match as well. This Arkansas-style BBQ just made it on my mandatory to-do list in Vegas for each trip. If you like BBQ, don't pass this place up.",JYYYKt6TdVA4ng9lLcXt_g,4,4,4,yTJNmlOolf9pA0FTh22Flg

Our sampler came with tri tip, brisket, pork ribs, and sausage links (substituted it for a beef rib). The order of a sample also came with your choice of 3 sides. The sides we chose were the corn nuggets, waffle fries, and corn bread. 

The sides were my favorite!!! If you like sweet creamy corn encased in crispy fried goodness, then you'll like this. I would definitely come back. They also have an ayce option which is a crazy idea to me since my boyfriend and I barely made a dent in our generously portioned sampler.

It's gigantic and completely acceptable to share, weighing a monstrous amount and nearly filling an entire takeout box. Piled high with juicy, flavorful brisket (tastes like Texas!), crispy fried bell pepper and onion strings, cheddar cheese, and chipotle aioli, this thing is packed with big, bold flavors. The red cabbage slaw adds the perfect bit of crunch and acidity, bringing what could be an overwhelming mouthful flying back into foodie heaven.  I'm pretty sure I'm going to have wet dreams about this burger.

Initially we were turned away because they had ""just closed"" only for the owner to come chasing after us, insistent that we could still be served. Right after our order was placed, a family walked in and were turned away. I'm flattered and grateful that we made it in under the wire, but maybe turn off all of the neon flashy BBQ lights if you're closing so that you don't have to ruin anyone's day!

To top it all off, the couple of employees we had interactions with were very graceful and welcoming. Most of all the place looked clean and did not have a funky smell, the way some places do.

1939054,2015-01-13,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Frequently thrown into conversations about the best BBQ in Vegas Rollin Smoke is certainly better than most, but is it actually good BBQ? I tried to write this view avoiding all hints of BBQ snobbery but that is just impossible for me- the snob is too strong. So you may want to take my comments with a grain of salt- for the average American RSB is probably perfectly acceptable BBQ. Having lived in the south and spent a lot of time in Texas and KC it wasn't all that I hoped it would be, but it was still probably the best in Vegas (probably need to due a more detailed head to head vs Road Kill) 

If you are from the south or KC you will prob find RSB to be pretty mediocre. If, however, you are a Las Vegas local who doesn't get to travel to BBQ hotspots frequently then it is a lifeline. Its all a matter of perspective really. There is nothing wrong with RSB, the food is pretty good. It would not, however, stay in business in large scale BBQ cities.

I got the buffet so I could try everything. My favorite BBQ, or really any, food is beef rib so I ordered one of those right off the bat. The beef rib was a little dry, something several people had warned me about in advance, but smothered with sauce it was pretty decent. Not life changing, but definitely good and considering how few places in LV even serve beef rib its probably the go to for that. 

Pulled Pork- this was better than the beef rib. Not dry, pretty flavorful, went well with the sauce. They showed the pig the respect it deserves

Pork rib- def better than the beef rib here. Seemed like it had been smoked for a good amount of time and wasn't way over done to the point where the bones fall apart or anything

Brisket- meh. The brisket I got had very little fat and so very little flavor and was somewhat dry. I like big thick slices of brisket, these were very thin and not very tall, so I'm guessing they weren't cut off a complete brisket. 

Chicken- this was actually pretty good. I don't normally order chicken at BBQ places because its chicken and pig is usually available but since it was all you can eat I gave it a whirl. Would eat again

Mac and Cheese- this seemed like it had some potential but was served pretty cold.  It was in fact Cheezy

Baked Beans- these were great, would eat again and in large quantity. 

Corn nuggets- fried corn, hard to go wrong, could eat about 3 lbs of these in one sitting.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,3,2,4,8WVrWIoshF8I1B2N0VIGlw

At first my boyfriend and I were looking for steak, we have these weekend staycations we stay at the hotels because we like room service in bed! We headed down stairs to the steak house and decided last minute how YUMMY BBQ would be! 
So I YELP'd BBQ and a few places came up, one being Rollin Smoke and most others smack in the middle of the busy Saturday night strip time (no thanks)... 
We drove about the mile yelp said, and yes it was a super dark street not a lot of cars around... and I started getting that ""I think I've seen this Law and Order episode"" about the couple that goes to the dimly light bbq place and is never seen again. 
So we drive past and I say to my BF ""you know it is normally these off the beat path ones that are AWESOME!!! And you can't ignore the 3 GIANT smokers in the parking lot!! 
So I say let's go!""

When we got in the place was quite nicely decorated and very clean, you can smell the food which made my tummy start screaming ""FEED ME""
The 2 gentlemen running the BBQ place were as kind as can be! 
We each to get the ribs and chicken combo with side of coleslaw & BBQ beans.
The prices were great over there and they have a bunch of things to choose from which was great!!
SInce the place was not packed we got to sit in the room with the TV and they even let us watch what we wanted. 
Our food came out and we were shocked to see they there was enough to feed a small village in just one order! 
I don't even know the best way to describe this smoked deliciousness of ribs and chicken that hit my belly! Oh it was heaven, the chicken fell off the bone when I picked it up and the ribs were so tender! And I got the flashback of a few minutes earlier of the chef saying ""he was from the (arkansas or Alabama) and he took much pride in his smoked bbq."" NOW if ALL bbq places would care that much!!!
 
They must start cooking their meats early early to get them with that much flavor. 
In my life I only profess & save my undying love for very special things, so far only my doctor and a sushi place from LA have made it on this list, but I know I am adding ""Rollin Smoke"" to it now!!!

I had my leftovers for breakfast and my grandmother had some of my chicken left, she commented it was the best she had ever had!! (and that was cold leftovers)!!!   

I know it might seem sketchy when you drive up but DON'T be a fool and pass it by just for that!!!
This BBQ is some serious HEAVEN!!!!",sxqOFdFtQgqtpZUumcFe-g,5,5,5,xPmgtgLz7ggT9W0yDFljFw
1946554,2017-01-23,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I lived in the South for about 10 years or so and while I was there, I got real taste for good barbecue, so when I heard about this place, I was excited to try it. It did not live up to my expectations.

I had the two meat plate with pulled pork and 1/4 chicken, with a side of mac 'n' cheese. This comes with their house sauce, which seems to be some sort of Arkansas-style sauce. I didn't care for the sauce and while it didn't affect my rating, my decision to avoid the sauce did.

So here's the problem:  even without the sauce, I should have been able to tell that the meat had been smoked. The pork tasted like...pork. Not smoked pork. Just pork. The same with the chicken. I could have gone to the grocery store and picked up a whole rotisserie chicken and it would have tasted exactly the same.

According to the web site, they use rubs on their meat. I did not see or taste any evidence of this. Both the pork and the chicken were bland. I can't say either meat tasted bad, but I also can't say either meat tasted like they'd been barbecued.

One other thing -- the service was a lot slower than I would expect for meat that's supposedly been cooked already. I took 20 minutes for me to get my food. I've never had barbecue take that long.

I don't think I'll be going back.",V4HrWt7zYJaPaSiW4I2mgQ,0,0,2,FmCm4Cuy-_DloR-5BI2E8g

1952264,2016-01-06,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I just ate some of the best barbeque in Las Vegas or anywhere else.  I had the 2-meat platter with an extra side: I picked pulled brisket, spare ribs, mac n' cheese, and loaded mashed potatoes.  Everything was AMAZING.  The brisket was rich, tasty and melt-in-my-mouth, with some interesting hints of sweetness in there: I did add some Arkansauce, which added punch to the flavor.  The ribs (there were supposed to be 2, but there were 3; maybe because I was a first-timer; recommended by the countergirl) needed nothing.  Best ribs I've had, anywhere.  Charred a bit on the outside (with the smoky-salty rub cooked right into the surface of the meat), tender on the inside, came off the bones with little effort.  Loaded mashed potatoes had good flavor to start with; bacon and green onions just added to the richness.  Mac n' cheese was richly cheesy.

Better than the food was the attention (I came in between lunch and dinner rushes, so 3 other diners and me had the place to ourselves).  I got visited during my meal by the countergirl, the dining room attendant, the manager, and the chef/smokemaster-in-chief.  I didn't have much to say to them, except that I was beyond words at how GOOD everything was.  The boss man was so happy to hear that, that he had a small dessert sent out for me - so I can also tell you that the blueberry cobbler a la mode (he asked what I'd like, and I asked the dining room attendant to surprise me; great choice, dude!) is also fantastic - sweet and just enough tart and tangy.  This was my belated birthday treat to myself, so that was a perfect ending!

The dining room is simple - benches and trestle tables - cheerful and fastidiously clean.  A great oasis from a rare rainy Vegas day.

Do note: Vegas locals get 10% off our bills when we show locals' ID.

This is real, local, down-home barbeque at its best.  The friendliness, flavor and authenticity can't be beat by any of the chains.  If you haven't had Rollin Smoke yet, you haven't experienced the rich, off-Strip local foodie scene in Las Vegas.",3htgxntzJVRMCJbVI-fR_g,1,0,5,po5xZIP3TRwtJTuwfiqgPA

1996945,2012-07-12,4,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"This is not Southern style brisket. It's chewy and fatty (i found three large chunks of fatty brisket that somebody could choke on if they tried to swallow it). Listen, I ate at 36 real southern BBQ joints last summer and this brisket would rank last. Website says he is from Arkansas, but I would like proof because the brisket doesn't qualify as southern. You can tell by the way he chops it, real BBQ brisket is more shredded. He also should know nobody serves brisket on a hoagie roll in the south, it comes on a bun. Rollin Smoke has two sauces, one claims to be hot, but both taste exactly the same, nothing stands out in that respect. Moving onto the side dish, which is in a tiny cup and not worth the $2. It was jalapeno coleslaw and wasn't too bad, but I honestly didn't see any jalapeno's in the cup. It also appears he has changed the prices - up of course - after being open a week. The online menu says a combo includes drink, chips and side for $2, now the chips are excluded. The price of 1/2 rack of ribs is $10 online and $12 on another menu that is off to the side inside the place, but on the official menu it is now $16. The big smoker on the outside and good smell makes this place appealing to the eyes and nose, but it doesn't pass the taste test. If you do go, show the website coupon on your phone to save 10 percent and that way when you get home and eat your nasty brisket at least you will have saved some money and won't feel as bad.",ELcQDlf69kb-ihJfxZyL0A,3,1,2,USTuxJ6McMcL4P_CjDQLLA

2003892,2017-02-19,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I consider myself a foodie, not just because I like to eat food and visit hunger satisfying restaurants, but also because I like to watch food television shows.  One television show on The Travel Channel is called Food Paradise, which featured the Best BBQ in America.  Rollin Smoke Barbeque in Las Vegas was one of the top ten restaurants featured on Food Paradise and I can personally attest that it lived up to its billing.  4.5 stars all day.

Rollin Smoke is located in an industrial part of Las Vegas not too far from the Strip and with the Trump Hotel overlooking this barbeque star of a restaurant.  There's really nothing else on the corner where Rollin Smoke sits except the restaurant itself.  Even having a late lunch/early dinner around 3:30pm didn't mean we escaped the popularity of this restaurant.  The parking is limited, so be prepared to park on the street or anywhere you can to get your mouth on this delicious BBQ.  Due to its popularity, it's great that Rollin Smoke can accommodate a good sized crowd.  It's a little confusing to figure where to start your order, but you'll have to stand in line, place your order, and then take your seat on the many picnic benched spread throughout three seating areas.  Rollin Smoke is owned by a family from Arkansas, which was obvious with many homages to the Arkansas Razorbacks throughout the decor complete with a Razorback hog head.  You can easily see that Rollin Smoke is award winning with trophies and framed positive reviews about the BBQ here.

I deducted half a star because it took some time for us to get our food, but it's also understandable because of the amount of people who flock to this BBQ mecca.  I ordered the Trio Choice Smoking Plate, which comes with your choice of three meats, a side, and a slice of bread.  I chose the brisket, 2 spare ribs, hot links, and a side of collard greens with brisket.  Everything was finger licking good.  Loved the spare ribs and hot links.  They were cooked right, hearty, and the meat was scrumptious.  I wanted more than the 2 ribs I got with my plate.  Make sure to try all of the sauces they have to douse your meat.  My fave two sauces were the spicy and House Arkansauce.  Their collard greens with brisket were the best I've ever eaten.  The greens were tender, juicy, and with the brisket, just pushed it over the top.  Last, but not least, Rollin Smoke's sweet tea was really good.

You don't have to be a foodie or watch food television shows to appreciate the outstanding BBQ Rollin Smoke has to offer.  If you love delicious food and want to leave a restaurant satisfied, then Rollin Smoke is a must eat, must visit location.",TdDxMS27vu0fXXxIvz16bQ,3,0,4,sfc1mWmYgav3sh5lZ7DC3Q

The man n cheese is a must. Super good flavor and the cheese isn't runny or too thick. Cooked perfectly and by far one of the best I have had.

It would have been nice to have corn bread in my platter than the one piece of bun underneath that was oily .

Fast forward two years and WOW, what a difference, This food is dynamite!!!

Let me start with my favorite menu item, the beef ribs. These things are insane tender with a ton of flavor yet simple, literally fall of the bone, fall apart in your mouth and moist with a great pink smoke ring. The server that brought my food told me it was like ""prime rib on a stick"" and boy was he right! Bring your appetite if you order these, they are huge.

Brisket is darn good as well. Great flavor, nice deep smoke ring and thinly sliced. I have been back three times in the last two weeks (Hi my name is Paul and I'm addicted to good Q) and I have yet to get any point, only flat. I one day will ask them if they are smoking full packers or just the flats. If you ever get the opportunity to get smoked brisket point don't pass it up, it's heaven! (Point brisket is where the ""burnt ends"" come from) 

Pulled pork is good, but this is where they lost that coveted fifth star from me. I know it's tough to please everyone ( I have been doing BBQ catering for years) but I believe it's a big part of pulled pork to have a finishing sauce added when you pull the shoulder to add that extra level of flavor. I use a home made clear eastern Carolina style finisher on mine and everyone loves it. 

In all this is the best Q restaurant in the valley bar none and I am so happy to see a fellow pit master doing well on his own. While my co workers and I ate lunch today ( 5-1-14 ) the line of people went out the door and never let up the hour we were here.

My bf loaded up on the meats, I think he tried pretty much every meat in the place. Ribs, meatloaf, chicken, pulled pork and wings, just to name a few. His consensus is the meatloaf is bomb and the baby backs are delicious. He enjoyed the other meats as well, but those were his favorite. He had 3 plates each consisting of 3 meats AND sides, so he definitely got his moneys worth. If you have a hearty appetite, AYCE is the way to go.

For my meal, I got a 2 meat combo with chopped brisket and spare ribs, and for my side I chose mac & cheese. The food was delicious. I really loved the ribs. They were so tender and meaty and fall off the bone. A good rib needs no sauce, and these did not need any. Speaking of sauce, they have like 5 different bbq sauces, ranging from sweet to spicy. I personally love a good vinegar based sauce, so I enjoyed their Carolina sauce the best. But they have something for everyone. The chopped brisket was yummy too, although I would probably get the brisket sliced next time. The only thing I did not like was the mac and cheese. It was realllly runny and pretty bland, but they have like 10 other sides to choose from. I can't wait to come back for some more yummy BBQ.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,11,11,4,XaycfT-LhNnIBQjNII5Zdg

2090209,2017-07-12,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"On my first day back in Vegas, decided to take Lyft to Rolling Smoke, the Highland Drive location, since it's literally right down the street from the strip (and the Palazzo where I always stay when in Vegas.) Quick $4 Lyft trip and we're there. Came to get some grub on one of the hottest days of the summer (It was 115 degrees out and their ice machine was broke.) I ordered a 3-meat combo plate but because they were out of spare ribs, you either had to order chicken or hot links OR be forced to pay $3 extra for pork ribs. To me, that was bush league, why should we the customer be charged extra because you ran out of spare ribs? If anything, they should have absorbed that cost due to their lack of planning. It was July 3rd, so they should have figured an influx of patrons the day before 4th of July. 

At any rate, I ordered the mac and cheese with my combo and had a seat. About 5 minutes later they delivered my plate to me (pictured below.) I should have known that so quick to get my plate, it would likely not be hot and rather, the meats likely already sitting on a heating lamp. Such was the case. Neither the porn ribs nor the brisket were hot. Heck, they weren't warm, either. They were room temperature. I would have taken it back and asked for hot meats, but I was famished, as I had just flown in, and wanted to eat ASAP, so I made do with what I got. 

Moving forward, I'd be leary about this place, if they keep feeding you room temperature meat in favor of moving the line and selling low quality food. Having previously been to Franklin BBQ in Austin, TX, that remains the holy grail/standard for ribs and especially brisket. This time around, Rolling Smoke BBQ didn't compare.",Si6CDh3AIT5hrsqYFebLLw,2,1,3,FBCp20jXsrPI-rdKp69v0g

When you walk in the door, follow the path on the right to get to the register and place your order. They have a large menu behind the register but they also have individual ones hanging on the wall for you to look at while waiting in line. 

I was really tempted to get AYCE (all you can eat) for $34.99. You start off with three meats and then keep going til your heart's content. What was enticing about it was that beef ribs are included and the AYCE is equivalent to a full rack in price. I told myself to be rational. ""You JUST got to Vegas. There's so many places you want to eat at today. Don't jeopardize that by tapping out at the first restaurant.""

Using my head, I ordered a 1/2 rack of beef ribs but then self-control went out the window when I also ordered the brisket 3 ways. I figured my daughter and I can share; don't judge. = p My husband went with the duo of choice of meats; he chose chicken and spareribs. 

I sorely underestimated the size of the beef ribs. See, I'm from the SF Bay Area and in my experience, it's been difficult to find places that serve decent beef ribs, or beef ribs at all for that matter. There are 2 places I found and well, they weren't very meaty at all. I ain't trying to pay for for mostly all bones. 

Anyways, I was full from one rib and a couple pieces of burnt ends. My daughter couldn't even finish one rib. By the way, they fell right off the bone and were fork-tender. Dip some in a bit of sweet country sauce, and oh my. So gooood! Side note, the sweet country sauce wasn't even sweet. It was thin and more on the mustardy/vinegary side, which I prefer over sweet bbq sauces. 

My husband took a bite of chicken and murmured ""oh my god."" He then took a bite of his spareribs and made a noise of appreciation. He was pretty much non-communicative for the rest of his mea, which didn't last very long because he devoured that ish.

- BBQ was a little dry, seasoning ok.  2 out of 5 if you've had great BBQ and traveled the world.
- WAAAAYYYYYYY over priced for portions and quality.  Did I mention WAY over priced.  $33 for a lousy small helping of ribs.  
- Outlaw Burger?  Should be outlawed.  Horribly tiny and meat is awful.  Tastes like they put filler all in it of some time.  So gross meat I spit out one bite.  I dont know where that big burger they have on the Yelp photos is but thats not.  Bait and switch you ask me.
- Only one BBQ sauce on the table - and liquidy weak.
- We had 3 ketchup bottles completely empty.  Very old employee came round and just shrugged when we complained like ""owell.""
- Fake pretentious BBQ poise with a couple lame pickles and bad white bread ends.
- No air in main eatery, side eatery for parties has air.  Who wants to eat in a muggy bbq joint in Vegas.
- Bathroom, borderline poor.  The toilet seat had been pulled off so I guess if you where a woman or someone you just had to squat.
- Super loud inside so noisy you cant talk or hear yourself think.

There was plenty of room for large groups. My party consisted of 7. We order a couple things to share and it was more than enough.

Chicken and pulled pork. Holy. Hell. Both were super moist and tender. The chicken was my favorite by far. Nice smokey goodness. It had great smoke flavor and fell off the frekkin' bone. My two favorite things!

Hubby had the outlaw burger and I shared my meat plate with him. We also had sides of mac and cheese, yams and corn nuggets.  First off, hubby loved his burger.  I had one bite and it was good, but too much like meatloaf for me both in taste and texture.  I like that they smoked the burger. We do that at home as well and there is nothing better.  Next visit hubby is getting the meatloaf he said. Something about loaded mashed potatoes.......yum.

I really enjoyed the brisket, it was moist and had just the right amount of smoke infused into it.  Some of it was cut too thick for my liking and as such, didn't have that tug and pull apart you expect, but thankfully, it wasn't served drenched in sauce, that is a no-no in my book.  

The pulled pork was good, but not great. It lacked that smoky flavor but it was very moist.  I have the same problem making this at home. It is difficult to get that smoke all the way into the deepest part of the meat.  Their BBQ sauce was very nice, not too sweet or just tasting like spiced-up ketchup. The two together were nice and next time on a sandwich it is.

The chicken was also good, but my favorite for flavor was the homemade sausage. It was nice and smokey and had a great kick at the end.  I would like the grind a bit finer though.  The sides were all tasty.  You could taste the cheese in the mac and cheese and it was not greasy at all. The yams were nice and chunky and sweet but not too sweet. The corn nuggets were perfect, nice and crunchy on the outside, tender and sweet on the inside. H&J on Eastern, take some lessons from this place on how to cook these. 

We shared a banana pudding for dessert and it was creamy good, but I would have liked to see some banana slices in it. The vanilla wafers were nice and soaked with pudding goodness.  I am not sure how we had room to eat it all, but we did.  We took plenty of meat home for leftovers.  

Will we be back? Yes, of course.  This is by far the best BBQ we have had in Las Vegas so far.  Just wish they were closer to home.",i9ny3oipXJMfZezK983RAw,5,3,4,C0pGKPFIe5jG6a3E7GZATA

First, don't come expecting anything fancy or close to it. While not a hole in the wall, it's pretty basic, picnic benches, wait in line to order your food (luckily, when we arrived, there was no wait, but there was a long one about midway through the meal), and a server will bring your food to you. You get your own drink (fountain drinks), plastic ware and plates. It's very close quarters, so people will be all around you while you eat. 

The cashier was very sweet and a real jokester! She told us that they were out of everything but hot links and got a good laugh out of seeing my face drop! She reassured me that she was just kidding and we proceeded from there. 

My friend and I decided to split the 5 meat, 3 sides platter ($27) and get an order of cornbread on the side. The platter comes with: chopped brisket, pulled pork, hot links, 1/4 chicken, and 2 ribs. Of everything, I liked the ribs best- they were tender and seasoned well. The hot links were spicy but good. The chicken was fine, but nothing to write home about. I was slightly disappointed in the brisket- it was SUPER fatty. Like almost all fat. It tasted great, but greasy and just not enough meat. The pork was pretty dry, sadly.

The sides, however, were all awesome. I could have eaten a tub of corn nuggets, they were that good! The Mac and cheese was delicious, and I really enjoyed the baked beans as well. The cornbread was yummy- sweet, dense, moist.

We had enough food to take some home, so that's always a plus. Someone did check on us during our meal, which also was appreciated.

I had company in from out of town and we are a bunch of gluttons, so all you can eat bbq sounded great. We checked the website to make sure they still had it. They did, and the website said $24.95 per person. We walked in, and there was a piece of paper over the price on the menu board that said $34.95. I told the girl that was ringing us up that her website said $24.95, and I didn't think it was right to do the bait and switch, we had driven two cars 20 miles to get there. She said ""you could access the website?""! I pulled it up on my phone and showed her. She went to talk to someone in the back, then returned and said, sorry, that's the price. I said, ""so you're not going to honor your advertised price?"". She said, ""do you want to talk to somebody else?"". I said only if it might make a difference. She went and got the owner. He told me ""sorry, I had to raise the price or I'd be out of business, that's been our price for three months"". I of course said, ""you've had three months to update your website and you're not willing to honor your advertised price?"". He said sorry. I really wanted to eat there, it smelled great. I can not however patronize a place that will not honor their advertised price, especially if it's been wrong for three months on their website. I can't imagine how that can't be intentional.

We ubered here from the Bellagio which was about a ten minute drive, then ordered almost everything! We got a three meat plate and I think it's called the big Dave, a sandwich with brisket, pulled pork and hot links. I added Chipotle slaw and do yourself a favor and ADD IT TO YOUR SANDWICHES! OH MY GOD, my mouth is salivating. The meat was so tender, so caramelized on the outside and just melted in your mouth. Their BBQ sauce is PERFECT.

Seriously, I drowned my food in that BBQ sauce and wanted to plug it into an IV. Their mustard sauce and spicy bbq were great too, and when we ordered our food and found a table I saw a guest eating the moistest piece of cornbread I've ever seen. I went right back to the counter and ordered some! THE MOST PERFECT CORNBREAD IN THE WORLD. Went great with the other 6 sides we ordered!

Hidden beyond the Vegas glitz & glamour, just underneath the Desert Inn Arterial over pass, comes a well known local bbq/soul food establishment of roots from Arkansas.  In what seems to be a shady location just blocks from famous Vegas strip clubs, comes a place called Rollin' Smoke. Yes, the area & location can be a little sketchy to those unfamiliar especially at night...but don't let that stop you from coming in.  Featured on TV...the marketing campaign and Yelp reviews can speak for it self. With more than that....The wifey and I thought we would pay homage and taste what all the hype was about...considering it too was recommended by friends and co-workers. We went on a Thursday night, about an hour before closing and service was pretty quick with a good amount of customers dining in and carry out. Fairly a small southern hospitality type of place, it caters to a back yard southern type of feeling.  We chose to try the 5 meat platter to taste the different flavors. Ribs, pulled pork, sausage, brisket, & chicken. Came also with 3 sides of your choice as we opted for loaded mash potatoes, mac & cheese and corn bread. 

To our disappointment, the ribs were a little salty & the flavor wasn't all that. The ribs were a little dry and not fall off the bone tender juicy. They also only had 3 types of sauces on the counter to choose from...one of which tasted like a mixture of mustard and ketchup. Still it was decent sauce. Not really sure what it was, maybe I got caught off guard because it was almost closing time, or maybe the meat wasn't as fresh or maybe I was just expecting too much from all the hype.

Maybe I should have said something or ask for recommendations and favorites...but I didn't want to make a big deal. Food was still good and plenty and did fill us up & even had left overs to take home.

Still, I only knocked off 2 stars because of my expectations. Service was excellent, atmosphere and staff were very friendly. I do want to give them a second chance and maybe even try their famous outlaw burger. I definitely want to give them a higher rating. I mean I could be wrong, because everyone else seems to love their BBQ.

Please Rollin' Smoke ... Make me a believer and want to come back...because whether it was hype or not...the place is legit & deserves a second chance!",Wp11jaXd3nQGwxTVH5ZTyg,1,1,3,0u9liBJ6yWRq5ZfcQVY_oQ

There is a big pit on the side of the building but I got close to it and it wasn't hot, not even warm so it was obvious that it had not been used that day.  I have also noticed that ""BBQ"" places that serve things like nachos, seafood and meatloaf usually have bad BBQ.  I saw excellent reviews here so I decided to give this place a shot.

I ordered the two meat duo with spare ribs and links.  Took forever, about 25 minutes, they should be able to get food out faster, especially if the food is not cooked to order.  The ribs were OK, very little flavor, rather bland, the links tasted like spicy hot dogs.  I also don't understand the green onions.  I've never, ever seen that on BBQ but as I looked around they were on everything.

We ordered the trio meats (chicken, pork, and ribs) with corn nugget, loaded mashed potato and a side salad (BBQ vinegrette dressing). You order your food and then find a seat. My husband ate most of the meat and rated it a 3.5-4 stars. The meats were tasty with variety of different dipping sauces you can choose from; the only negative was the dark chicken meat was a little dry. The corn nuggets were different as we have never had them before. You expect it to be salty but because of the corn it is sweet. The mashed potato was good if you like yours smooth and not chunky. We tried the sweet tea based on several reviews. It was super sweet and tasted like the Asian grass jelly drinks. We were expecting it to be a cold Canadian ice tea but with the adjustments we made it was good. My husband had to add ice and 1/3 cup water just to make it the right amount of sweetness and temperature as we wanted a cold drink. It's a little out of the way in the middle of nowhere, but if you are craving for some meat it's worth a visit for lunch.",Qw8l9KkfUe_S9R3_lswwTg,0,0,4,Lf-m6Fu4Q8L9v_PEOHo5bg

Imagine waking up at one of the best hotels on the Las Vegas Strip and you've just had a great meal at a famous chef's restaurant the night before, but you're wondering what the locals eat.  You're wondering if a town like Las Vegas has local places that most tourists don't know exist.  If you're like me, you go to the source, Yelp, for good information, and Yelp came through in a great way.

On this date we found Rollin Smoke Barbeque, and it was a good, make that great, find.  It is a hole in the wall joint tucked into a strip mall off the beaten path, and, as of this review, it was averaging 4.5 stars after 455 Yelp reviews.  This is a very good thing, as Yelpers can be unkind and unforgiving on occasion.  Typically I look for consensus when using Yelp, and that is usually achieved after 100 or so reviews.

On our trip there were three of us arriving, my wife, my sister in law, and me.  Of the three, I was the most committed to the experience, and the other two were good sports.  After the food arrived, they were also sold.

We ordered so that we could try almost everything, as we got enough to share with each other.  We had beef ribs, pork ribs, chicken, jalapeno cole slaw, beans, potato salad, and, as its two days since we were there, I'm sure I'm forgetting something.  We also 'checked in' on Yelp, and when we did this they offered us a free desert.  We chose the blueberry cobbler.

If you are 'high maintenance' this is not a place for you.  You order like you're at Carl's Junior; stand in line, place the order, give them your name, find a seat, and they bring it out to you.  The room does not feature fancy table clothes or fine silver.  It does include a plethora of paper towels (on a roll for your immediate use), and a TV tuned to a sports channel.  In the room with us was a crew of air conditioning repair men, about ten guys, and the fact that they were there, locals, helped me know that this not a tourist spot, but a local's place.

The $40 worth of food that we ordered literally arrived in about four minutes.  It is important to note that we had attempted to avoid any kind of lunch rush, arriving before the lunch hour.  There were probably 10 other people already there, and I suspect that the lunch hour features a lengthy line.

Regrets?  Yes, just one.  I wanted to taste one of their links, but I didn't get the chance, but next time, and there will be a next time, I'll get one.  Las Vegas is many things, and there are a lot of really great places to eat, and, as in all big towns, there are some great locations off The Strip that you've got to find, and Rollin Smoke Barbeque is on that list.",_mMGDi9ZSY-r85GAEcsksg,9,7,5,MR-jO9f4462n3Rcw1V4McQ

I've visited rolling smoke a total of three times, and every time I try something different that was just as good, if not better than the last item.

First a warning, as soon as you walk into this place, you will experience an instant uncontrollable flow of saliva. The smell is just AMAZING! Now that you've been warned, lets begin with the menu. My absolute favorite is the rib plate and the brisket. The ribs are tender, full of flavor and just come off the bone with ease. The brisket is equally as delicious, with a good variety of BBQ sauces to complement the already great smoked flavor. 

A few tips:
The place to me seems a little hidden, so GPS it for easy directions. You WILL come out smelling like smoke. The staff is helpful, so if you are unsure of what to get, just ask for their recommendations.

Not going to deny but I had high hopes and it was sort of a let down. We had the Pit Special 5 Meats 3 Sides. While the flavors are good it was barely lukewarm. And why would you chop up the brisket? More like scraps to me. All jokes aside.  The menu did indicate it is served chopped unless otherwise requested. Again, who notices that? Shouldn't it just be mentioned when you order upfront? I personally think they just want to get rid of their scraps as obviously captured in my photo.

The sides are pretty sorry. The waffle fries is nothing more than criss cross fries. Cheesy mac and cheese was not only cold but the worst I had. The yams is more of a dessert.

Tip: Ask for their special spicy sauce. It is so damn good! Skip the regular bbq sauce and vinegar out in the open.",26WdIC3_NDe96xtR2tqeVA,1,0,3,x8pmgxdWO-3yPmcFsuDkbQ

I think I went at a bad time. There wasn't a lot of people there so I guess the grill was not kicking out hot food. I guess they just gave us what was leftover hanging around in the kitchen. I ordered the beef ribs because most reviews said to get them and they were really fatty. Rolling Smoke needs to understand the average customer had good bar b que in their lives and know what to look for when eating it. I say that to say, I have a strong feeling the meet I was eating was not made that day. I think the meat was leftover from the prior day because it had a very older texture to it. The links were good but it is not hard to cook a link. The chicken was ok and probably would have been better if it was served hot. The best thing we had was the kick ass beans and cornbread. 

Lastly, I been in Vegas long enough to know that most of these restaurants have good days and bad days. Most places, you are not going to get good food unless the establishment is crowded and they are forced to keep making hot food. I went to Rolling Smoke when it was not that crowded so I believe they just gave me the meat that was cooked a day prior. No way that meat was cooked that day. I think they didn't want to waste money by throwing it away. In my opinion, restaurants should never risk a customer by serving old food that should be thrown out instead. We are coming there for an experience and we are paying top bucks for it. 

I have been to restaurants and had a fantastic meal, just to go back to the same restaurant and have a horrible meal. Therefore, I will try Rolling Smoke one more time. I will chalk it up as one bad experience hoping to get the experience most people on this board received.",zEJ1kX5pFy664VJLfLOBqg,0,0,2,wMhlobD3XAejNVx7WDNkQw

There's also an all-you-can-eat option, which is characteristically Vegas! There's no limit in the all-you-can-eat option. You can eat anything that's on the menu -- bbq, burgers, sides, etc. I couldn't bring myself to do it, so I opted for the three combo plate. It comes with one side and I just added another two more.

It was a hearty meal shared between two. The baby back ribs were an extra charge but we had to do it. It was smoky, flavorful, and tender. Rollin Smoke has bottles of homemade bbq sauce. There was a sweet and spicy one that I really liked but can't remember the name of! 

We also got brisket. I ordered it chopped because you get the option of chopped or sliced. Looking back, I wish I got sliced because the chopped brisket was more so shredded brisket. I wish I was able to have some more texture to my brisket! Nonetheless, still good.

We also got hot links, which were nice and spicy. The sides we got were mac and cheese, corn nuggets, and potato salad. The potato salad was okay. The corn nuggets and mac and cheese, however, were so delicious! I am a mac and cheese aficionado and I want to steal their mac and cheese recipe. It was so cheesy, creamy, and satisfying! The corn nuggets were deep fried creamed corn. They might've been my favorite side order! I highly recommend their mac and cheese and corn nuggets.

More so ones that fellow yelpers rave about. Not sure the last time had some good old fashion ribs. So excited too get down and dirty. Talk about epitome of Hole in the Wall. Industrial Rd not exactly the prettiest road in Vegas but great for gentlemen clubs. Anyway so for second thinking going too one only too pass it and then once did get too Rollin Smoke Barbeque look down the street shocker another one. Once you do get here the smell from the pits literally parked right outside in the parking lot (I have no idea when they start but assume in the morning) and them ribs block out everything. I think Hole in Wall places have so much personality and character ALL its own. 

Once get inside the menu is fairly small but they do have chalkboard with their daily specials. You go up too the cashier too order then they bring the food out too you. You sit wherever you like or have room. They have two room adjacent too one another and other room talk about personality on the walls with the art. How can you not love the boars head or pig head looking over the restaurant from one corner? They do still T-shirts that like the logo but next time go get one of kind T-shirt. 

I decided too get The Trio plate. What better way too try little of everything or get my meat in. They out of the hot link so got double order of the pork. My sides went with the mac and cheese. I also ordered side of The Kickin Baked Bean. The pork was excellent! I could easily see myself tearing up pull pork sandwich. Guess is one of there more popular items. The ribs were solid little bit different style then the ones more use too but still solid. Wish could tell you about the hot links but save that for another review. The sides the mac and cheese was really good. It not cheesy cheesy but not runny also so had nice balance. The Kickin Baked Beans now that am FAN. I enjoyed the pieces of pork or beef that in it. I really did have nice little kick spice level too them. Even though it small menu fell like lot more thing for me too try.

The prices talk about reasonable priced! Compare too some of the other franchise places this place is a steal. You get so much more personality and one of kind experience. Under $20 you can fill yourself up with any combination and still have enough for desserts. The service is awesome! Small business owners that sense the personnel touch all around. It small place so just make sure you beat the crowd cause the place can fill out quick. If never been Rollin Smoke Barbeque someplace check out or fill like mixing up one night.

I am a manager at a global enterprise software company and every year we go to Vegas for our Sales meeting.  I was looking for a place to have a relaxed team dinner and wanted to get away from the glitz for a bit.  Also, the team loves BBQ, so that was the criteria.

We went to RollinSmokeBBQ and this restaurant is just great.  Excellent tasting BBQ - the baby back ribs, brisket, hot links - just awesome.  Easy, casual ambiance.  Family owned business.  The owners were very accommodating to us.  The pictures on their website don't really show it but they have two small dining areas - the main area where you order your food, and then another separate eating area off in another room to the side.  That room can easily hold 30 people.  My group of twenty arrived, we sat down, ordered, grabbed drinks and the evening just got rolling.  It was easy as that.

We ordered 20 'all you can eat' packages but had the restaurant just bring it all out family style and place it on the tables.  The team dug in like piranhas - it was excellent.  It didn't take long for everyone to be bursting full.

All the food was great.  Excellent, friendly service.  The owners were very appreciative of our business.  After the meal, it was a nice walk back to the strip.

I got the ""biggun'"" sandwich, which had pulled pork, brisket and hot link.  The hot link was delicious and did not have the overly greasy and oily nature of a standard hotlink, which are often like kielbasas.  The meat was very good as was the sauce.  I had a couple pieces of brisket that were a little overcooked, but overall it was excellent.  I also had some of their st Louis ribs, which were tasty.  Flavorful, tender and fall off the bone, although a little fatty...but that is what you generally get with st Louis ribs.  Fried okra and greens were very good as well, and they had a ton of other sides.  Unfortunately they were out of the cobbler and pudding, so I did not get to try those despite all the claims of excellence. Now, they location and décor are not exactly phenomenal, but I suppose it is what they could afford starting out.  It is close to the strip also which is good if you are in that area.

Other places claim to have BBQ (ahem, Famous Dave's) but they DO NOT. Rollin Smoke is heaven on a spit. They know what they are doing and they do it well. If you are super hungry and want something that will hit the spot, go to Rollin Smoke. These guys are from the Carolinas (sorry, can't remember if it's North or South, apologies), and they do BBQ well. I won't go into whether this is dry rubbed or not because if you are from Las Vegas, you won't even know what I'm talking about anyway. Just go there if you want great BBQ here. You'll love it. 

Also, for those folks who complain about Rollin Smoke running out BBQ, I have to remind folks who don't know that real BBQ takes time. Lots of time. Smoking is a dedicated process, and if this restaurant runs out of meat, they run out of meat. They can't magically smoke more in 30 minutes or less. So, get there early so you can get what you want. My kids had the pork sandwich and it was huge and they ate it all. The bacon potato salad is heaven. My husband had the 3 meat Brisket Dog, and loved it. I had the Smoked Meatloaf, and I thought I'd died and gone to heaven. I had plenty of leftovers for my husband and I to share. We saw (and were frightened of) the Outlaw Burger, as it was easily a foot tall. So, again, please note: Bring Your Appetite. 

This is a ""get in line and order"" place, with seating in three different rooms. We loved sitting in the room with the ""Tanked"" fish tank that used to be their original smoker.",tlchIlg-3pH2MwCDn_IAFA,2,1,5,wGZ-fu_cjoiy4ZFr8UwmSw

When it comes to BBQ, American BBQ, I've gone to St. Louis, Memphis, Kansas City, Texas, the Carolinas, various states in the East, South, Mid-West, and West, pre-Yelp and current Yelp days, and have experienced both good and bad BBQ. You can say I've had more than my share of BBQ and can tell a good BBQ from just a decent BBQ place but no way am I an expert. I've hated BBQ spots locals loved. So IMHO and friendlier version RSB is just decent, OK is being nice. I've been here a few times and well I am NOT a fan. Each time I've been disappointed with one thing or another. Yes I've gone back but that's just cause everyone's been raving about RSB and I wanted to give them another shot and then another.

One of my first visits was with a group of 5-6 from work. I don't remember what everyone exactly ordered but remembered me having the chopped pork sandwich and another having the chopped chicken sandwich which neither I can find on the menu, must have been a special. Anyways from both of the sandwiches we created a community pile of what's this!? tiny pieces of chicken bones. There were a lot of chopped up chicken spine and rib bones all mixed in our meats. Even if I was mistakenly served chicken with my pork, bones, really RSB. I had more typed out but I leave it as that. The only good thing about it was I had a free dessert with Yelp check-in. STRIKE ONE.

After writing off RSB for a couple months the group made it back out. This time ribs and Outlaw burgers were ordered. They certainly took their time bringing the ribs out.  Ribs were ordered first and was last to be served. What exactly were they doing!? Warming it up or cooking them as it was ordered. I actually asked for and ate my dessert first cause I was hungry. The ribs that came out was beyond disappointing tough, rubbery, had little taste, and sucked. I've had way better.  I noticed my ribs were different from the others. Oh there's a ""rib plate"" and a ""rib platter special"". STRIKE TWO.

After working up an appetite playing basketball all morning I came here looking to finally clear things up and getting the rib platter special. It was a lot of ribs but it lost all its luster. The beef rib wasn't as tender as I was hoping but tender to some liking. The rest were decent nothing exciting just a lot of meat covered in sauce. I smelt all the smoke inside and outside of the RSB but I got only a hint of smoke taste. STRIKE THREE. Throat slash. 

The best BBQ in Vegas!? I don't know about that. Maybe, than again Vegas aren't known for BBQ and the ones I've enjoyed no longer are open so maybe I don't know anything about BBQ plus I sometimes enjoy buffet BBQ ribs. You want more info there's AYCE BBQ for $24.99. It's located off a few side streets near the Strip. They have a small parking lot which is shared with the other businesses. They're from Arkansas. They're friendly but I wouldn't call the service great. There's large tables, small tables, and booths. Lines for ordering can form out the door.

We decided to give this place a try given the great reviews.  Location, we are talking about a dark street next to a gentleman's club akin to uber hole in the wall.  Only in Vegas!

So we were greeted at the door by a taxidermed hog and in front of us in line were three police officers... My thoughts-heck yah we were in for something good!

Customer service was top notched.  I ordered the 1/2 rack baby backs ($17.99) and a pound of the brisket ($10.99).  Floored that sides were not included as with typical BBQ spots, which makes the pricing on the expensive side.  

Baby backs came out and the color was a rich coffee grind black and just brilliant.  I was expecting some excellent bark.  But, oh Romeo, alas it was not meant to be!   There was no texture to the bark although the meat did fall off the bones.  The dry rub was mehhhh.   The three sauces had a more watery consistency than traditional BBQ sauces, which is absolutely fine.  There were three varieties - mama sweet, house, and BBQ.  The house had a nice balance between sweet and vinegar and was our favorite.  The brisket had what amounted to a peppercorn rub.  They love the peppercorn at this place. Perhaps it was the end of the night, but it came out very dry.   We ended up not eating most of it it, which was a shame.   

While dining, we eavesdropped on a conversation.  Apparently this is Rick's (of Pawn Star fame) favorite spot and he and Rollin teamed up to open another spot in Rick's strip center by his pawn shop.   Well, sounds like Rick is rollin in the dough with his Rollin location, which we will check out next time we are in town.

As we drove in i started getting worried bcoz the ambiance wasn't what I expected. It was a saturday noon when we arrived. We were in line waiting to order when suddenly people started coming in in groups. Suddenly they were busy... Oh coz it's lunch time. Wow! I guess they really are popular.
Since it was our first time we ordered the 3 meat meal with macncheese and extra order of mashed potatoes. I can't remember how much we paid but it sure was very much affordable than what we would usually pay at  Lucille's for the amount of food we got.

I wasnt able to take pictures as we were starving and we just ate soon as our food arrived. What we ordered again was a 3 meat meal with mcncheese and extra side of mashed potatoes and drinks. The meat meal also came with a roll. The serving was enough to feed 2 adults a preteen and a toddler. They were yummy!!!! Very flavorful. Serving was ample to actually alot (atleast for us).

Staff were excellent. The lady who took my order was very helpful. She gave suggestions and didn't quite rushed me despite the line behind me. 

We liked this place so much that i recommended it the same week when my workplace offered to treat the employees for lunch.

The coleslaw was ok, expected something more, what with being advertised as chipotle. BBQ beans were a HUGE disappointment. Nice level of sweetness (not too), but the meat they put into it was pulverized, had a consistency of almost like ground beef. The beans came across as a poorly executed chili.

Great place when you are starving for meat!!!

Generally I stick with Tri-Tip, Chicken and/or Brisket when trying a new place.  These guys did NOT disappoint!  Meat was tasty, flavorful and juicy (not overly greasy, just juicy).

The Chicken was cooked perfectly and unusually soft (in a good way), same with the beef. 

The cornbread is excellent...tastes like it has a lot of butter, which is pretty damn good IMHO~

The seating sucks though; I had to have ma boy buy my grub while I went and sat in an open booth. There was a huge crowd of folks waiting to order (you order first, pay then go sit.  They bring you your food).  I kinda got some disappointed looks from the crowd as I apparently was the only one smart/clever enough to go grab seats while your buddies are ordering for you?! haha

Side Note 1 - Don't ask the staff if they have any to-go containers...they will look at you like a total dumbass as containers are plainly visible at the counter, next to the soda and utensils hahaha (the dude just rolled his eyes and pointed, I in turn looked a damn fool~ hahahaha)

Side Note 2 - This is on a side street that has about 4-5 strip clubs. The street itself is dark and looks like the kind of area you could get mugged, raped, etc.  So go with a nice sized group of people if you're gonna go at night, and bring tazers or mace~

---Overall---

Service: A.  We got our food pretty quick~

Food: A. Great food if you're looking for a heavy meat fix!!!

Atmosphere: C.  If I wasn't worried about getting ass-raped, I would probably visit more often.",-kkq4fbhtnbnYAPpxpnvHg,0,0,4,IMtyXldXfdqZ2KGyqkrB1A

2480195,2015-08-24,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I have seen Rollin Smoke on several Food/ Travel Channel specials, and have been anticipating my trip in since I planned a trip to Vegas several months ago.
We stopped in about 11:30 and though it was fairly busy it wasn't hard to get a table and we didn't wait in line or for our food very long.  The parking however is very sparse so we had to park on the street across the way a bit. 
I have to say that the main takeaway that I got from Rollin Smoke is that Salt Lake City (where I live) has some very underrated BBQ places. For what has been stated as one of the best BBQ places in the country I honestly have enjoyed certain items at places here in UT even better. 
That out of the way we were very please with the food and clearly their technique is flawless. The smoke rings were perfect and they did have hands down the best ribs in every way that I have ever had. One thing I did not notice on the board is that if you don't ask for it specifically they default to chopping up their brisket, and though it was quite tasty I would have preferred my brisket to be sliced, and I am surprised (since I've never seen it that way before) that chopped rather than sliced is their default. 
They also had the best mustard based BBQ sauce I've ever had which they call ""Sweet Country Girl"", and their other sauces are quite tasty too but I typically prefer a thicker Texas style sauce (didn't effect my review, just a note) to their Louisiana/ Alabama style thin vinegar sauces. 
I Ordered a 3 meat plate: Ribs, Pork, Brisket and a side of their potato salad. The portions were good but not generous, and as mentioned above the ribs were awesome, brisket was tasty but would have liked to have tasted it sliced, and the pork was good but not exceptional. Everything did have a very nice smoky flavor and a perfect crust, and I ate almost everything mostly dry, but added dashes here and there on my fork. 
My wife ordered their big baked potato (cant remember what they call it) which was just huge and loaded with all sorts of goodness and brisket on top. It was very delicious and I think that they smoke rather than bake the potato but I could be wrong. 
They take your order at the counter then bring it out to you when its ready. The service was okay but nothing great and they weren't particularly friendly at the counter, but they guy who brought out our food was pretty nice. 
I will certainly eat here again, but at this point cant say that it is my overall favorite BBQ place. Their prices are actually pretty good for Vegas, and I think they give a discount to locals (which is a bit annoying).",p_6-Q9uAqn3i8NLjudkJ1A,2,2,4,aW-1v1NLi9HM4NCvRjrLgg

I got the AYCE for a reason, since I'm in Riverside County it wasn't everyday I could visit even though I wish I could.

The one issue I had was the timeline with the AYCE. The place was a bit loud which was ok with me. When I purchased the AYCE the gentleman at the register said something about the time, since there was a very long line I didn't want to hold it up. In any case, I asked another employee about the time and for some reason he had no idea what I was talking about.  Well the thing is you only have a 1 hour window from the time you purchase it so remember that when you get the AYCE. Since the line gets pretty long you might wait up to 10-15 mins each time which limits you tasting their deliciousness. So keep that in mind.

What a great BBQ place.
This is your classic, no frills BBQ joint. The menus are on the wall, you order at a tall podium and the staff brings the food to the table. 
We got there early on a Wednesday and there was no line. While we were there the line grew out the door. 
The fried okra was freshly made and tasty. The jalapeno coleslaw was very good, a nice take on a classic side item.
I had the rib combo, which I wound up making two meals from. Others in our group had the sliders which were very good as well.",4X63BuUHCQjNUt0QPK4Ugg,1,0,4,Vj-EFwAQFMhLyUsXY3aM3w

Everyone in my group was so hungry that we didn't even entertain the thought of sharing (which we really should have) and we all ordered separately.

I opted for the chicken wings with the sweet corn pups and a side of catfish. One of my friends got the meatloaf and others got the ribs and brisket sampler deals.

OMG SOOO MUCH FOOD!!! I loved the sweet corn pup things an the catfish was sooo good. Battered just right with alot of catfish meat. My wings were pretty tasty.

The only reason why I did not give it 5 stars because the set up is a bit confusing. 2 entrance doors one to the dinning area and the other to the main entrance with a few tables, does not have any signage IE seat your self, order here...  So at first we sat down and waited 10 minutes and we realized that we had to order up front.  The menu is massive with all these delectable choices and sides and the smell inside makes you even hungrier.  The writing on the board on the wall is a bit small and intimidating since there are so many things to choose from.  When you get to the counter they only have one menu for you to look at so it holds up the line when you are trying to order.  I chose the mixed platter and the girl at the counter choose my meats and I had potato salad and mac n cheese as my sides, friend ordered all you can eat.  Food took a little bit longer than I would have wanted to but it was 4th of July weekend so it is totally understandable.  When our food arrived it was hot, and it looked amazing.  The food tasted even better than it looked if that is even possible.  I had baby, short and beef ribs and my friend had one of everything on the all you can eAt.  The ribs were perfectly cooked nice bite to it but still fell off the bone.  The bbq sauce on the table was refilled while we were still eating and it was warm and complimented the ribs perfectly.  These guys definitely know what they are doing and they have the recipe for success.  

Just a suggestion for first timers (I will be coming back and I will have your system down) 
Place a hostess podium with menus, make signage saying pick up menu, wait in line, place order and find a seat.  By having menus available people will stand in line less time and it will be easier for the order takers to expedite service.  Other than that I have absolutely nothing negative to say.

Even as a sometime vegetarian/full time pescetarian, the smell from the car park smokers was intoxicating. 

One could say the air was moist with flavors...Huh?!?! Ya had to be there. They do have moist towelettes which I grabbed (forgetting the crew I was with) for post feast clean up. 

They were out of greens and the fish and okra were deep fried (will try another day) so I opted for the yams, jalapeño slaw and baked beans: the latter has some type of meat in it, tried my best to pick it out, but veggies be aware. They also had Smoked Tabasco on the table = went right into my moist jalapeño slaw! Love hot sauce :)) 

Service was very friendly and checked on us frequently - even one of the owners! The unsweetened fresh brewed tea was delicious. Nibbled a piece of corn bread and all of the carnivores loved their bones, pulled pork, smoked meatloaf etc...Misti gave the Southern gal stamp of approval to the okra. 

Still offering dessert with Yelp check in and the banana pudding looked old school divine, and moist!  Can't wait to come back and try more options and bring carnivore friends. I'm sure they will appreciate the moist delicious meat! There may not be ""Sex in the Champagne Room"" next door, but there's terrific down-home eats till 1:30AM on weekends, guaranteed!!!

We ordered rib tips, links, mac n cheese, mashed potatoes, potato salad, coleslaw, peach cobbler and caramel cake all to go.  It took over 45 min for our order to be ready.  I would think the sides and desserts are already prepared and just need to scooped in a container.  So the wait was for links and rib tips?  The smokers were not on when we were there so we weren't waiting for meat.  

Customer service could have been friendlier.  They customer in front of me asked what sides they had and the guy taking orders just hit the menu where the sides were listed.  I wanted a link and sides but was told I had to get the hotlink sandwich.  I asked ""So I can't just get a link?""  He said no not really.  When I pressed the issue he said I can get a 2 item combo and just get all hotlink.  I ordered that but why not just sell a link for $3 or $4 bucks?  After 40 min of waiting and seeing people order after me get their food I asked how long it would be and was told very gruffly that they are ""very busy"".  They were busy but I ordered before the lunch rush started.  I was also sitting in the booth next to the register so I could hear the orders and knew who was picking up phone orders, etc.  Also during the 45 min I waited at least 5 people told him the coke was out.  It was still out when I left.  

Ok.  On to the most important part the food.  Cause really, I will wait for hours and put up with bad service for some awesome BBQ.  

Sweet Tea- Not good.  I actually switched to soda and I rarely drink soda.  

Rib tips- Hubby thought they were ok.  I'm not a big beef rib person but thought they were ok also.  `

Links- No way that was 2 portions of links from my 2 meat combo.  It wasn't even 1 small link total.  But that is ok since they were so dried out it looked like they were days old.  I have never seen meat that dry in my entire life.  I'm being generous to say they looked like they were sliced the day before and left in the warmer overnight.  

Mac n cheese- very bland, noodles overcooked, could have used salt or real cheese.  

Mashed Potatoes-  Instant.  Yes they use instant potatoes.  All the other stuff there is good.  If they would use real potatoes it would probably be amazing.  

Potato Salad- This was the best out of all the sides.  It was ok but wouldn't order it again.  

Coleslaw- Ok.  

Peach cobbler- Cold.  Who serves cold peach cobbler?  Again ok.  Not great.  

Caramel Cake- Yellow cake topped with caramel syrup, like the kind you buy for sundaes.  This was actually not bad.  I might even try it at home.  

All the sides seemed just a little spice away from being good.  Maybe I went on an off day.  I don't know.  After reading everyone's reviews I was so excited to come here and had high hopes for what I thought was going be my new favorite BBQ place.  I was heartbroken at how bad it was.  At some point I will try again cause these 5 stars reviews have to mean something.

David at the front is super engaging and welcoming. I assumed he was the owner, he made us that comfortable.

Make this dude an owner or something. Sign him up to a long-term contract or just give him lots of money and make him promise not to leave.

We wanted to eat somewhere that's savory, delicious, and popular of course! We originally saw this place on YouTube, through a food blogger. There's an option for ""all you can eat"" bbq, since Las Vegas is known for that right? At first, my boyfriend wanted to try AYCE, but after seeing the portion size, he opted out, lol!

Let's get started with the portion, they do not skip on the meat! Our baskets were fully loaded and made fresh to order. I ordered the baby back ribs, which fell off the bone. My boyfriend ordered the burnt ends, which had a nice char and crunch to them. Our sides were corn nuggets (these were so good! ), corn bread, yams, and criss cut fries. 

The yams were sweet and delicious, makes my mouth water just thinking about them. The corn bread was soft and packed with flavor. The fries, not as crunchy as I thought they would be, but still good. Now, the corn nuggets...I've never had them before but everyone loves them and now I see why. They tasted amazing! My taste buds were in heaven!

We tried all of the sauces with our bbq, but the Mama Sweet sauce really stuck out. The blend of sweet and savory hit it home.

In summary, we would DEFINITELY come back if we were ever in Vegas again. Make this your last spot to stop at before leaving!",C_Y5dfZgHpFzBrnWTNj0KQ,1,1,5,o3PTbRJedDJ5Bx1koLzwWw

We had combo ribs plate $17.99 with Mac and cheese side, also a trio meat with 2 x's brisket and spare ribs $14.00 with beans. Ordered a Full slab of Baby backs to go $28.00 It said that every plate came with a dinner roll and a drink. They didn't put the roll on. I questioned the guys delivering  the food they said ""no"" it doesnt. I re read the board and ask the girl at the register she says ""yes"". When they deliver the rolls the explanation is that there is a menu change coming. OK I get that. Use a piece of tape and cover the roll if your not giving it out anymore.
Here's my advice. You charge alot for the food don't be short sighted. The roll is pennies on each plate.
I and many others ( long line behind and in front of me) do not mind paying prices if the food is good. Give something away on the plate (roll). One of the guys tried to sell me that the slice of bread that my food was on was the roll?
Look down the road at longevity and you will see if you penny pick people no matter how good the food is we won't come back.

Las Vegas did not have Barbeque until Rolling Smoke opened, thank God they are here.

Everything about this place is GREAT!  I could go on for paragraphs about the food.  We ordered some of everything,  even the catfish. 

Brisket - AMAZING (not fatty,  cooked perfect),  Pulled Pork - OUT OF THIS WORLD, Spare Ribs - MOUTH WATERING, Chicken- VERY GOOD (it may have been touch dry but I couldn't tell because I covered it in their delicious sauce), Catfish - one of the best I have had,  light crispy and flavored perfect a  definite surprise for a BBQ joint.  There is basically no dish on the menu that you can go wrong with, even the sides were great.

Now about the service:

I was worried when we pulled up;  the place is small and there was literally a line out the door (Saturday night dinner).  Remarkably,  the line was so quick we barely waited - I don't know how they did it but it was perfect.  We got amazing personal service and it was quick (figure that one out).  If the food is amazing,  then the service is AMAZING x10!

After we placed out order our waiter,  a younger guy with blonde dread lock type hair, delivered it to our table.  The place was packed,  I had been watching the waiter and he never stood still  or stopped moving,  it was BUSY but he took the time to tell us about each dish and came back 3 times to see if we liked everything. Not only did he come by the but the Chef came over to each table to welcome the customers,  tell them about the dishes and make sure they liked everything.  We even had one more guy from the kitchen come over and check on us.  It was amazing service,  you just don't get service like that in Vegas anymore.  You can see everyone obviously loves their job and loves that restaurant - the attitude a made the place fun and enjoyable to a whole different level.  I can't say enough good things about our waiter,  he was 5 star service and just a nice guy- we would probably go back for him alone but the food is the shining star of this place.

The only regret I have is that I forgot to buy Barbeque sauce to take home,  good excuse to go back this week :)",NVBJ7RxdswFXCscwgObCTA,0,0,5,nLJ38DfNgrr47TDFGZITfw

The Q here isn't sauced and tends to run a little on the drier side, relying primarily on dry rub and smoke for flavor, but they have a variety of sauces to moisturize your meat. We ordered a little of everything, here's the breakdown:

Spareribs: probably one of the better meats here, it's a little dry but with solid rub seasoning, decently flavorful.
Pulled pork: my favorite meat option, probably because it was the right balance of smoke and natural pork flavor, appropriately tender.
Baby back ribs: too dry, more than a bit of a letdown.
Smoked chicken: we got white meat, so the dry theme continues. My lady friend said it basically had no flavor, I didn't think it was actually fairly decent.
Brisket: could be more tender, and not nearly as seasoned as the other meats.
Hot links: essentially smoky and spicy kielbasa, not bad but nothing earth shattering
Burger: this may have been the highlight between me and my lady friend, they use a combo of smoked brisket with ground beef to make the patty so the burger has a depth of flavor that you wouldn't otherwise typically expect. It's practically impossible to eat without a knife and fork given the mountain of onion strings on top, but that's not really a serious complaint.
Mac and cheese: nothing special, a little on the watery side, needs some seasoning.
Corn nuggets: these things are like crack, I could eat these all day. Not nearly as creamy in the center as ones I've had in the past, but the sweetness and textured crispiness are on point.
Corn bread: I want to say the bottom is soaked in a light honey syrup, fairly moist, I'd consider it a win.

We walked out with nearly 2/3rds of our food as leftovers, which is probably better for my health but a bit of a disappointment since it means I didn't try to gorge myself to exploding. I don't know if this is the best that Vegas has to offer for Q, but I'll probably hold off on coming back here unless my friends really feel the need to satisfy their smoked meat cravings the next time we're in town.",pNDsq4v56zTT2xhyYvUMQQ,3,0,3,FN4mH6FkNmH4d0yaUyGKtg

The beans were a great side- thick and chunky with big pieces of pork mixed throughout. Yum yum. The potato salad had crispy pieces of bacon on top which launched it into a new level of awesome-ness. The fried okra was perfectly breaded and fried. No extra salt required. The mac and cheese just seemed like a dud next to all the other sides, so I'd skip that one if possible.

It wasn't until my food came out and I had a bite without the sauce that I understood exactly why I should do the same as the business suit guy. Their barbecue sauce is really good. I wish I could bathe in that sauce. Not really that would be gross but you understand the sentiment. 5 stars for that sauce.

They have $7.99 or $8.99 deals and even offer all you can eat barbecue. I ordered the $7.99 trio sliders and got chicken, brisket, and pork. It was so tasty. Presentation is aesthetically pleasing meaning the food is good looking. I do mind that the meat was colder than usual at room temperature or even a little colder. Food should come out piping hot so that once the customer decides to dig in, the food will still be extremely warm and fresh. 3 stars for the food.

The people working there are super cool. We were asked how our food was tasting too many times by 3 different workers. 5 stars for the service.

Setup of the restaurant is weird. The ordering counter is inside one of the dining rooms so the line wraps around the dining tables so if you sit on those dining tables it'd be awkward. There's a connecting room with dining tables and me and my 2 friends avoided sitting on those dining tables by the line so that we sat at a table meant for 2. 2 on the bench and 1 on the chair, 2 shared one end of the table. There are outdoor dining in the front but no one wants to sit in the 100 degree Las Vegas summer weather. It wasn't until we were about to leave that I saw a separate dining table accessible from the outdoor dining on the left side of the restaurant. There could be signs inside the main dining area pointing out that there's that other separate dining room..

Actually if Chris Rock only ordered one beef rib here, that would be all he needs. I made the mistake of ordering a beef rib on the side because I thought the dual meat combo of beef brisket and pulled pork was not gonna be enough because I was really hungry. The beef rib itself  does not look like it came from a cow because if it did, the cow would have been as big as an elephant!

As you can tell, the beef rib stole the show. So lets break down my other choices.

First of all, those two black smokers you see outside are legit and im not talkin about Snoop Dogg and Dr Dre. They use hickory wood to smoke all their meats and it aint no joke! Their smoke flavoring is just one of their key ingredients that makes their barbeque so good. 

The dual meat combo of beef brisket and pulled pork smothered with their signature barbeque sauce will definitely get your salivary glands working overtime. The brisket has just the right amount of smoke flavoring and if the pulled pork was any more tender, Elvis himself wouldnt be any more proud singing ""Love Me Tender"".

As much as I would of loved to try all their barbeque being the carnivore that I am, that only warrants another trip or three to accomplish that. I would also like to mention their sides. I chose the bacon potato salad, but if you ask me, I think you cant go wrong with any of them. Just recently, they added fried okra and corn to their menu.

As for the desserts, assuming that the button on your pants has not busted off already, the peach cobbler is literally the icing on the cake not to mention the banana pudding.

Some random info: Yes they take cards. Yes they have sweet and unsweetened tea. Yes they have a decent amount of room with enough tables and chairs. Lastly but most importantly, their service is very remarkable (no surprise because they have the southern hospitality demeanor).

Oh, and one last thing. The area they are in is kind of suspect. Im not trying to scare you guys or anything, but the street they are on is dominated by strip clubs. Dont worry though, these guys are not open late so I dont see any problems, unless you are into strippers. LOL.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,16,12,5,cS0J89Z3mDCuoT2TlJINGg

I came here for a business lunch with the rest of my coworkers from my office. I ordered The Outlaw Burger, and I ordered 2nd out of our line of 7 people.

We all went to sit outside and wait for our food. Fast forward a bit to after everyone else has their food, I decide to go in and see what's up with my order.

The lady checks my ticket and goes to see where it is. She comes back and tells me ""it'll be right out"". I wait another 10 minutes and see many other orders come out, but not my order. I ask again and she checks again, then tells me ""just a couple more minutes"". 10 minutes later I ask her ""am I going to get a burger today?"", so she checks again. 5-10 minutes after that she comes out and says ""they have it on now"".

A full hour after I ordered, after all my coworkers have finished their lunch, and after every other table in the place received their order, they finally bring my burger out. I had to take it to go, since I spent my whole lunch break waiting for it.

The guy who brought it out was nice and threw in some fries, but I was upset at that point. I paid $13 for a burger, even left a good tip when I signed the receipt thinking I'll be the nice guy who tips at these places, and the lady who caused all of this didn't even attempt to apologize.

Needless to say, even though the food was decent, they just lost business from 7 locals, out of which I was overly excited to try the food here.

I've had my fair share of meat experience and Rollin Smoke BBQ is high on that list. 

The Food: ""Pit Special"" - $20 + tax
You receive 4 meats of your choice and 4 sides plus a drink. Portions are pretty big although I'm on the smaller side (4'10, 90lb) so an average build will definitely not leave hungry. I got the brisket, spare ribs, hot link, pork, potato salad, corn nuggets, Mac n cheese, and lastly corn bread. The meat was delicious, some bits were dry but nothing too bad, mostly moist and falling off the bone. Cooked well with a little pink in the brisket and ribs, subtle smoky flavor, and had a slice of bread to cushion the goodies. The corn nuggets remind of corn muffins I've had growing up in the Philippines (corns bits, crunchy bread) so I loved them but it might be a hit or miss for others. The corn bread is TO DIE FOR. Soft, moist, amazing flavor. Boyfriend had to promise me that we'd take some home when we leave Vegas back to LA - it's just that good. Can't vouch for the other two sides since I was too full to try them and I don't want to review it non-fresh. 5/5

Atmosphere: Spacious considering the location. Has outdoor seating and a private party room to the side. Couple flatscreens to entertain you. Steel tables - easy to clean and sanitize. No napkins, just a huge roll of paper towel since you're bound to get down and dirty. Interesting mural of people on the wall and mascot merch scattered around. All in all, eating there was good. 3/5

Customer Service: You order and pay at the front then seat yourself. Cashier was nice enough, not super welcoming but helped me out with recommendations and they were all hits :) Although she did accidentally charge me extra on the 4th side (put as separate from the Pit Special) coming out to $25 instead, no biggie if it's not a repeat mistake. I only saw 3 staff on the floor: main cashier and the other two switching off delivering food and checking up on customers. The one guy was very nice and welcoming! 4/5

2832969,2016-06-07,3,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Rollin' Smoke is located in a weird business park complex which boasts the corporate headquarters of a place called ""Kiesub Electronics"", but also has 3 buildings in the same place that bear the Kiesub name. The complex/mini strip mall feels like someone's trying too hard to make their own little sandcastle come across as an empire. Tucked away on the side not visible to us immediately was Rollin' Smoke. 

This was also part of my Vegas journey to find a good burger. Rollin' Smoke's got a burger called the Outlaw that they like to pile with brisket. People dig it, so I set out to try it out...only problem was, they were sold out.

I settled for a Brisket Dog instead, because I enjoy a good potato chip sandwich every once in a while. ""Puttin' Things on Top of Other Things Cuisine"" is totally in my wheelhouse. If it was just the dog, the brisket and the Arkansauce that they serve up, I think I would have enjoyed it a lot more, but the cheese wiz on that sandwich really doesn't tie it together flavor-wise. I ended up scraping off the wiz after a couple bites, and it was much tastier that way.

The brisket...I dunno, man. I dunno what they do down in Texas that nobody else seems to be able to replicate, but this place didn't come close. It's just about Bludsoe's quality. Not quite salty and flavorful enough. Much as I hate being a locale champion, any BBQ that I've had outside of Texas just doesn't cut it anymore. I don't know what it is. The group I was with had the same impressions. It's perfectly fine, and it may very well be the best BBQ in Vegas, but it's pretty low on the totem pole in terms of overall rankings. The links are nothing special, and neither was the pulled pork. I'm not a ribs guy, but one of my group dug the ribs. So maybe order that if they're out of Outlaw Burgers. :)

The brisket is a bit on the dry side.

Not sure why they have opted to serve chopped beef brisket instead of sliced. The chopped variety has way too much in the way of questionable ingredients like grizzle and fat, even some bones.

Their barbecue is so good that it's hard to understand why they have opted not to serve sliced brisket sandwich. This would be a huge improvement and worth at least one more star.

It's a humble and simple setup when you walk through the doors but the flavors roam about the air which play a prelude to bounty in which you're about to partake. The wall sized menu is easy to follow and offers a whole lot to choose from. This being my first visit, I had to take a while before deciding but everyone does that it seems. The line gets long and for good reason. If you get there after 11:15, expect to standing outside those doors leading in. There's ample seating on a sunny day or dry evening. The weather is perfect for both for now. All tables have unlimited napkins, ketchup and BBQ sauce. The people are very friendly and check in on you every 30 minutes or so to make sure you're enjoying your food. Indoors is splint into two eating areas. One is the room you come into to order with picnic benches set up and various displays all around the room including the giant sized menu. The other has a couple of flat screens going with a game or two on broadcast.

The food was savory and very tasty! We had a hot dog, the Duo which is a two meat order and a Trio a three meat order consisting of brisket, pork ribs and hot links. Other choices we could have had were a ¼ chicken and pork. Our sides were waffle fries and mashed potatoes. The hot dog was meaty with good chew and snap when you bit in. The fries rounded out the intake quite nicely, not too oily and plentiful. The hot links are sneaky spicy as they invade your palette bite after bite. So good! The brisket was tender and cut right. I needed extra sauce because that's what I like. The ribs were killer! Lots of meat on those bones, tender but held good form after the bite. Those were sucked dry. The mashed potatoes garnished with fresh bacon bits and melted cheese were thick, rich and flavorful. I could eat that all day! Unlimited drinks and BBQ sauce are always a plus. 

What's my bottom line? I have a saying about restaurants: You get one shot at the title; if you succeed, you'll get more shots at the championship! So yeah, I'm coming back! There's so much still to try and this initial visit definitely left a strong, positive impression. Great prices, championship quality BBQ.

Ordered Duo plate with 1 side and bread plus a drink. Opted for the short ribs and brisket with cheesy mac and cheese as the side.

- The meat lacked any flavor and was completely missing that ""Wow"" factor we experienced on  each previous visits. Plus the meat was actually lukewarm, like it had been sitting out for a bit.  The short ribs were still good, but the brisket was very disappointing. 
- Plus it seems like the portion sizes have gotten smaller. We both looked at our plates and said at the same time, ""That's it?"". Hmmmm.
- Personal pet peeve of mine: Dropped 4 singles into the toke jar and never even received an acknowledgement. I work for tips and thank EVERYBODY who tokes. It is just rude not to.

2947590,2013-06-03,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Like other folks here have said, I claim to be NO expert on barbecue except to profess that I freaking LOVE it and have had the privilege to eat it all over SoCal and throughout our travels across the US. 

I still have many, many places to visit and look forward to many more eatin' adventures but here's the down low on this joint and Dusty, the front man for the place. 

We were in Vegas to celebrate our 10 yr wedding anniversary and my husband wanted to surprise me with a visit to a great barbecue place so he did his research and away we went. Below are my humble observations, take them with a grain of salt, add in what everyone else wrote and you are in for a treat.

1. Yes, it's in the hood/industrial type area, sprinkled with strip joints and such, but get over it, the rent is probably cheaper than hell and there are always customers around. 

2. Dusty, a young dude to greeted us at the door, is one of the owners and what a hell of a front man he is. Uber friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and filled with positive energy, he treated us like old friends and even if the q had turned out to be shitty, we would've come back just for the customer service...thankfully it was not.

3. Small joint, not a huge menu but concise, to the point and the prices are so freaking good! Most of the barbecue places we've ever been to, charge an arm and a leg for a decent sized plate...here? 3 big, meaty pork ribs, 2 sides, a roll, $11.00 bucks and well worth every penny.

4. The bacon potato salad, jalapeno, corn coleslaw and banana pudding were absolutely legit and awesome!!

5. The best part? My BEEF SHORTRIBS!! So tender, so meaty, with just enough smoky bark on the outside, I sucked those bones like a flipping piranha...OMG!!

All in all, 5 stars all around and if I could give more, I would. If you visit and love the place, then please write even a quick review. They deserve as much business as they can handle and I hope they are there for a very, very long time...Good luck Dusty and thank you again for the most awesome beef ribs I've had in a long time.",2xT2ekjhxi0PhF3_ueiVkw,3,2,5,0HfQEfh9ZdeYRFxbuMsd0A

Heavens!!

Do not let the location scare you. It's kind of industrial and out of the way, but you've got to get here for this incredible food, clean location, terrific customer service and fast preparation. We've already decided we're coming back here next time we're in Vegas.

Rollin Smoke BBQ is amazing! My sister and I shared the Trio plate of chicken and 2 portions of spare ribs. The chicken was moist and flavorful and the ribs fell off the bone and didn't need additional sauce (although I tried their sauces and liked them all)! We chose the Collard Greens as our 'included' side dish and they were delish!! We also ordered a side of the corn nuggets (creamed corn deep fried and a Must Have!). My dad had the scrumptious meatloaf plate that included tasty mashed potatoes, a huge piece of meatloaf that was full of flavor and fresh, handmade crispy fried onions smothering the meat along with a roll.

Chef Tim came out to check on the guests and I told him we were from Southern California and could not get over how delicious his food was. He asked if we ordered the Cornbread and we said we'd heard it was great but hadn't ordered it. He brought us each a piece and I can say that it was the best cornbread I have ever had. He said ""cake flour""... ""that's all I'm saying"".

I told Chef Tim that my father loved the fried onions (which were, by then, gone) and that he was going to make a sandwich tomorrow out of his leftover meatloaf. Tim took the plate to box it up and when we got it back, there were 2 pieces of bread (to make a sandwich) and a huge pile of fried onions, in addition to my dad's leftovers! LIke I said, GREAT customer service!!

Then Chef Tim asked us and a few other folks if we wanted a tour, so we got to go back and see & smell the hickory wood and gorgeous meats in the smokers.

Ooh yeah and their sauce. Man do they have a wide variety. You can go with the regular bbq sauce, spicy, vinegary sauce, sweet bbq sauce and many, many more.

They also have great options for sides. I personally like the dirty rice and it goes so well with the meat selections. You have a choice of getting the 2 meat or 3 meat choice. My favorite are the ribs so I get two orders of that and if I'm really hungry I'll get the briskets as well. The 2 choice is about $13 bucks while the 3 choice is around $18.

First, the taste of the BBQ has really improved since our first trip.  This time it was nicely smoked with just the right amount of spice and flavor.  Meats well done and cooked well.  I wasn't that fond of the pulled pork, which seemed too salty but the other meats, ribs, beef and links were A OK.

But, this time the food was cold.  Not freezer cold, but it tasted like it had been sitting out on the counter way too long and was medium to medium minus warm.

The service from cashiers were very nice and intimate too.  Each transaction was unique where the cashiers would create small talk to show appreciation and make the customer feel special.

I ordered the 5 meat combo so that I could taste a good sampling.  Food arrived fast but it was clear that most if not all of it had set there in a steam plate for many hours.  Without sauce, all tasted bland and stale.  The sausage link was both dry and others while not try, clearly had that watery taste.  Ribs were decent but just like pulled pork was not edible without the sauce.

I could tell this food could be better if it were fresh but I have to rate what I ate and that was very disappointing.

I had three sides:
1. ColeSlaw.  I love coleslaw to cool my mouth between bites.  This one seemed fresh and nice but had a strong mexican flavor which ruined the experience.  This is a personal judgement of course.  The beans were both a little too spicy and sweet.  Again, I can see others liking it.  Last was waffle fries.  I liked these very much even though they too were not very fresh.

I also had a couple of rolls and these were excellent.  Nice, soft and fresh!

Back to the sauce, it had a magical ability to make the stale meats tasted decent.  Without it I would have walked out with one bite.  It is rather thin, medium spicy and sweet (this was the ""American Sauce"").

On the atmosphere, the place had a rather unpleasant smell to it.  While visually clean, it made you think it was not.

A couple tips, get the beef ribs if you want ribs, they are huge and great. 
Even though the AYCE price is not $35, if you can handle all that meat, GO FOR IT! Still a great deal. Get one of each side, because they are all good. I am a big fan of the loaded potatoes and jalapeno slaw.

Parking lot is small, but a good size for the establishment. Right outside are two or three picnic tables (the kinds you'd see in the park), and on the door there is a menu for you to look at. In the room where you order there are a few more picnic tables, menu is along the back wall and the cash register is in front. The lines can get very long, but thats because a lot of people have a billion questions like WHAT DO I GET?!? WHAT'S GOOD!??!

Yes, lines are long but they get the food out pretty quickly. 

Hot link is super spicy IMO. So if you like spicy, then go for it! Best bang for your buck would be any of the platters. My bf and I got the rib platter or something like that, it came with spare ribs, pork ribs and beefy ribs along with a side of your choice and a piece of bread. It was about $30, and the tray of food gets brought out to wherever you're sitting. Make sure you listen for your name. When I saw the platter I thought... meh, nothing special, presentation isn't great, just seems like a bunch of burnt meat piled on top of each other. BOY, was I wrong! Don't eat the beefy ribs FIRST because they are SOOOOO good. Everything just falls right off the bone. Save that for last! The spare ribs and pork ribs aren't bad either but, seriously if you had to pick just ONE thing off the menu, go for the beefy ribs. 

Add some Alabama (?) sauce to that and it'll be like a party in your mouth. Also, I'm not a huge fan of banana pudding but the one here is delicious.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,2,2,4,1HBtVwGxqo3PYv_uW1HqzQ

They were really tender, flavorful and very meaty (just how I like it). 

However,  I deducted 2 stars because the BBQ sauce was terrible and they had the nerve to charge for extra BBQ sauce. It tasted like tomato sauce with pepper (YUCK) and nothing BBQ about it. For me the sauce will make it or break it. I also was disappointed with the collard greens.

 If you place a to go order, be sure to check it before you leave. My order was wrong when I first received it and wrong again after they tried to make it right.  Bring your favorite BBQ sauce it will go great with any of their meat.

I always get the AYCE option, and one of their employees remembers me because I always order it.  What I don't understand is why rolling smoke is sending out a quarter of the portions that they used to with each order of food. Before, I would order a meatloaf and get a FULL order( 2 nice slices) of meatloaf. Not a little crumpled portion from the end. Before I would order a of beef ribs and get 2 in an order, not one. This last visit, not only did the order taker miss a few of the items initially ordered, but they NEVER(even in previous visits) ask if you want to order more. You have to compete with the people in line and it creates and awkward situation. All portions sent out were not even close to what I used to get and sadly, I was bringing in people for thier first visit. How are you going to justify an order of wings and only give 2 wings in an order? 
The 4 meat platter came with 2 tiny strips of brisket and the wrong sides. 

You guys gotta find a better system for the AYCE. Maybe a flag on the table so your staff knows who is spending  twice the amount of money than the average guest and could show them a little more attention. Also accuracy in order taking is important too. I didn't mind the mistakes and poor service before, because there was value in what you were serving. 
Now Higher price/way smaller portions/no server/difficulty in ordering at $35 a person plus 20% tip? 
Ouch. That's disappointing. You can't raise prices and give your guests way less. That's a no no.

Speaking of meat coma, I was talked into getting their AYCE the last 2 times for $25. This is the best value because you can literally get EVERYTHING on the menu but their portions for regular items are huge.   For AYCE, i typically get alot of beef ribs, get some brisket, and catfish.  Their catfish is perfectly fried with a nice crust and I squeeze a little lemon on it and pour a little hot sauce and i devour every bite of it.

Their desserts, cobblers are great too.  AND this place is open till 1:30 on fri/sats.  Also good for groups - came with a group of 10-12 people and they sat us all easy.

3079843,2016-04-20,6,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I started looking for barbecue in Las Vegas and had already bookmarked a few, but nothing looked like what I had in mind.  Then I stumbled on Rollin Smoke on Yelp and thought, this could be it.  Now the name Rollin Smoke has a completely different connotation if you're not thinking about smoked meat, but let's not go there.

Let's go to the 'cue.  What to get?  I read about smoked meatloaf, and the pictures look good, but hey, it's meatloaf.  You don't judge a barbecue place by the meatloaf.  You want brisket and you want ribs.  I was particularly interested in beef ribs, and they have them on the smoker here every day.  How about some pork ribs?  They have a rib platter with baby backs, spare ribs and a beef rib.  Add another beef rib for $6.  Sounds good, but too much for today.

The beef rib was just what I was looking for.  Thick and meaty, dark with smoke on the outside, and juicy and fork tender inside.  Just pull gently and it releases from the bone with a puff of steam and meat juices rolling down to the plate.  The meat is seasoned, but not overdone.  There's some rub and some smoke flavor, but it's not dominant.  You can really taste the meat.  Barbecue sauce is offered, but with meat this good, who needs it?

Spareribs were also terrific, again partly because they are nice and thick.  They have good texture and are juicy and moist, with good smoke flavor and seasoning.  Baby backs were a little disappointing, still tender, but a little drier, and at least on this day, didn't stack up to the flavor of the spareribs and beef.  

There are two dining rooms inside and a few tables outside.  The store is just a few blocks off the strip, just on the other side of I-15.  Parking can be tough, but come between the lunch hour and the dinner hour and there's no trouble.  Who doesn't like linner?  Staff was friendly and helpful, joking and laughing, and made a point to come around to all the tables to check on everyone to see how they liked their barbecue. 

There are plenty of sides, and I had the corn fritters.  Folks rave about them.  They're good.   They're fried nuggets of batter encapsulating some sweet corn kernels, but I was here for the ribs, and was not disappointed.  I'll be back again for the brisket and some burnt ends.",O2rustXsunayIkiGKLoyeA,10,8,5,PuvcBhEcFoCTagbbQS1VxA

I did not like either sauce and this should have been an inclination of what was to come. I ordered the two meat plate with pulled chicken and pulled pork and for my side I chose the baked beans. 10 minutes later my food was ready. First, I tried the pulled pork and the pulled chicken and both were less then impressive. I used some BBQ sauce that I had at home to spruce up the meat. Next, I tried the baked beans. The beans were good, I liked the chunks of brisket and I think their house BBQ sauce tastes better when it is cooked into something. Lastly, the peach cobbler was inedible.

My brother ordered a plate that included a bunch of meat that he could eat/sample with my dad. I had a couple of spare ribs and the mac & cheese. The ribs were decent, but definitely lacked flavor in my opinion. I enjoyed the mac & cheese because- well it was cheesy. I tried one of the sausage slices that came on my brother's meal and that was my favorite thing. It had a lot of flavor and went well with that mustardy sauce. I tried the beans and they were not best by any means, but my brother enjoyed them. One thing I noticed is that all of their sauces had a twist and none of them were ""traditional"", which is a good thing, but I wish I could have had a traditional bbq sauce that I could use for the meat. Maybe they had one, but I didn't see it. Also, the layout of the restaurant was sort of weird, it was just really closed off and the two rooms felt like two different restaurants. The last negative note that I have is that the restroom is right by the kitchen and it had no lock for just being a single restroom. So it's in a small hallway and you're having to walk sideways so you're not in the server's way or whoever's leaving that kitchen. So the no lock thing made me uncomfortable and I had my dad stand outside of the door so no one would enter while I was in there. The restroom looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in days. I understand that the restaurant gets busy sometimes, but that's unacceptable to me. I will end by saying the server/busboy was really helpful and kind. He was cleaning the tables quickly, yet efficiently to let other people sit at the tables. He came by to pick up baskets and clean our table off so that was cool to see. So this place isn't the best bbq in all of Las Vegas, but I would recommend you try it and form your own opinion.

People have meals they remember.  People have meal they never forget.  But very rarely do people have meals they have to ask themselves if it really happened.  No food should be allowed to taste this good.  They really shouldn't.  Because all it does is make all the other bbq feel bad, feel ashamed for their inferiority and their audacity to put themselves into the same class of eats as Rollin Smoke.

3167872,2014-02-16,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"If you're looking for good BBQ in Vegas, Rollin Smoke is where you're going to find it!

Located in a small plaza on Highland, Rollin Smoke is a fairly small restaurant and gets crazy busy at times. When you walk in, there's a large menu on the wall and after you place your order, you can go sit down and they'll bring the food to you. The menu is somewhat large and features classics like pulled pork sandwiches and meat combo plates. They've also got some not-so-usual options like the gigantic Outlaw Burger, Chicken 'n Waffles and even an all you can eat option. 

I usually order a two meat combo with brisket and hot link. Most places seem to serve a packaged hot link and just toss it in sauce. While I have no idea whether there's is or not, it's one of the better ones I've had. The sausage is flavorful with a great snap and they don't douse it in sauce. Since I'm a fan of spicy food, I like that there's has a little kick to it as well. And there's a reason I can't stay away from the brisket either. It's extremely tender, flavor is great and it's not overly smoky. Again, even though I really like their sauce, they don't douse the meat in it which is a huge plus. You have to try the sauce though, it's slightly sweet but has a mild heat...really tasty.

If you're into dessert, they have a few options there too. We've used the Yelp check-in for a free mini dessert a few times and always get the peach cobbler. My wife is a peach cobbler fanatic and this is her favorite in town. I've heard good things about the banana pudding though and I'll be getting that next time.

This a solid 4.5 stars for me and only because I've had inconsistent plate sizes. One time I got a combo plate that had so much meat I couldn't finish it, but then the two other times we've went, I finished mine and starting picking off the wifeys. Not a huge deal but it's a bit irritating. Either way, Rollin Smoke serves some of the best BBQ in town and at much better prices then most of them too.

Last time we were in Vegas we wanted to try something different: ""cheaper"" eats, just to shake it up. It was fun and we ended up at Rolling Smoke as a result.

Now, here is the thing: this place gave me the best ""bite"" of food I've ever had in all of Vegas. Tied with $500 chef tasting menu meals at Andre's. I kid you not. The ""world famous beef rib"" was that amazing. It reminded me of the Flintstones brontosaurus chops it was so big. Husband and I split it and it was so good I was tempted to fork fight him for it. It was lucious.

I don't actually remember anything much else. The sides, the other meats (we got a 3 meat platter and upgraded for 6 bucks to a beef rib with it per Yelp recommendations) and the service were just a bit above average, I recall. There was something I vaguely recall about a charge for sauce or something that was irritating but beyond that all I recall was that rib and my mouth waters just thinking about it.

They have lots of specials/combos where you get a fountain drink (self serve, with refills), a side, and a main (sandwich, wrap, salad, or just meat by the 'slab'). I was feeling obese that day, so I got a salad with pulled chicken, the cole slaw, and a cornbread. All three things were amazing. My companions had half a smoked chicken which was just ridiculously juicy and smokey. The rest of the crew got brisket sandwiches (pile of brisket on a hotdog/small hoagie bun), mac n' cheese, and beans. The mac n' cheese wasn't met with much enthusiasm given the runniness of the cheese sauce and the firmness or thickness of the type of noodle used. The beans were described as 'kickin' by both the owner and the one at my table eating them, so I imagine that was a good thing. Overall, I will definitely be back here for more BBQ when I'm in Vegas. The food was just too good to not go back.",ltTLCzM4p-1cnC70SPNfSA,3,0,5,4extyAf51vovWNNMAQA2wg

We got the Pit Special with sides of mac and cheese, loaded bacon mashed potatoes, and cornbread. We ordered to-go and had to wait about 20-30 minutes for our order, as it seemed to be quite busy. The layout of the restaurant was a bit odd, so we awkwardly stood in the center, where there was the only open space, while we waited.

Overall, the meat, while all tender, was not as flavorful as I would expect. I tried the brisket, sausage, and chicken. The barbeque sauces themselves were very flavorful, with a hint of some complex spices that really made them stand out, so if you doused everything in the sauce it was tasty. For the sides, the mac and cheese was more on the creamy side rather than cheesy which I wasn't a huge fan of. The bacon mashed potatoes were excellent; with the cheese and onions on top, they were delicious! The cornbread was also good, soft with melted butter on top.

Overall decent food for the price, but not what I expected of the 'best BBQ in Vegas'. I also did not enjoy the wait for our to-go order.",08Mi5YofPJaM_8Vo3TmG3Q,2,0,3,BbczyZTmlxpCB_jLNqThSg

The brisket was sliced very thin, cold, tough and had minimal smoke ring, bark etc. The sauce on both was too sweet for my taste. The sides were mediocre. The mac n cheese a bit too watery, tasting more of black pepper than cheese and the potato salad dry and bland. It all came with a dry toasted little dinner roll. Service was minimal, the guy at the podium seemed annoyed to take my order. Order and pay in advance at the podium and the food brought to your table.

The location is off the strip, but slightly next to the freeway. It was kind of hard to find the place because its further in and side streets had a few turns from the path we took (we were coming from MGM). It looked like a legit hole in the wall restaurant. It was situated in an L shaped plaza with a couple other stores. The parking was open, no validation needed. I couldn't tell if the place was the barbecue place until I walked up and stared at the menu on the door. 

Interior = 4/5 
Place was nicely decorated. There were two places for sitting, the main area with the cashier and a side area with more benches and booths. It was pretty easy to find seating and they even have all the barbecue sauces in the side with little cups which was so convenient. I can see how it can get crowded especially if the line is long, which can get bothersome for some of the people sitting down since the line wraps around the benches in area.

Service = 5/5
The cashier was super friendly and gave us recommendations on what to get and his recommendations were on point. He took his time to explain everything as well since we didn't know what burnt ends were. After we ordered, and we're eating, the owner went around saying hi and greeting people asking how the food was. So the environment was super friendly.

Order = 5/5
We got a sampler (chicken, brisket, ribs) with half a pound of burnt ends, as well as the coleslaw, corn, and Max and cheese. I loved all of the sauces, so try everything - each has a unique flavor and texture. The food was so yummy. I found the chicken to be good, it wasn't dry like other places and the brisket and ribs were good. What stole the show was the burnt ends. That was beyond delicious and just the right amount of fat so it was soft and full of flavor. I found it cool they served it on bread, I thought it was to soak up oil or grease. Whatever it was used for it was cool. The sides were okay, I liked the coleslaw had a bit of a bite and the boyfriend loved the corn.

Overall = 4/5 
Great food experience for barbecue. Probably one of my favorites, since the meet was full of flavor and not dried. Service was welcoming too and makes it comfortable for first timers. I will come back and order a pound of burnt ends.

Maybe it was high expectations due to the many 4-5 star reviews, maybe I just don't know good barbeque when I eat it. By no means am i a BBQ connoisseur but here's my take on this place. I can only comment on the brisket and the sides I ordered. I got a to go order of 1lb. of brisket, a side of loaded mash, yams, & mac n' cheese. When I opened up the container with the brisket I was really irritated because it was chopped. Maybe that's my fault because I assumed it would be sliced. I know some places ask if you want it sliced or chopped like Dickey's but the cashier never asked so I guess I assumed. Ok fine it's chopped no crying over that. However it wasn't really even chopped it was really in small, tiny pieces, like the kind of little pieces that are left from sliced meat. I feel like it was all the scraps leftover from slicing. All of the pieces were dark, like the outer crust of the meat. I couldn't find any pieces in there that were grayish like it is in the center. This probably explains why it was overly salty since it was all the outer pieces. Thank goodness there was a slice of bread underneath because it would have been really hard to eat alone. I didn't even want to put any sauce on it since it was too salty. Oh and I got a little small container of sauce for 1lb of brisket but I guess in my situation it didn't matter. It just wasn't enjoyable at all. As far as the sides go, they were ok. Nothing spectacular. Yams were good, mac n cheese decent, loaded mash was similar to Dickey's mash which is decent. Maybe I need to try their brisket sliced, maybe I need to try something else on their menu. I don't know. I don't think I'll be going back any time soon which is too bad because I really wanted to love this place.",07T3KSHLXO-vUzVxXSXTBA,0,0,3,_gYz5w-Up5_Ic085bKd2CQ

Rollin' Smoke met every single one of them. We all ordered different menu items but somehow we all wound up with the brisket, which was perfectly cooked. My husband isn't big on Carolina sauce, but he must've used half of the bottle while we ate. It was that good! I could've eaten a gallon of the Mac 'n' cheese all by myself. Which is a good sign because I'm very picky about Mac 'n' cheese.  I also could've eaten a gallon of greens, they were perfect!  There was so much food, I gave my leftovers to my brother. I think he may have finished them in the middle of the night.  Another thing I liked about this place was how friendly the staff was. Good food AND good customer service? Yes, please! Dusty was such a gracious person, I wanted to hang out with him and talk BBQ for the rest of the night.  

We were a little nervous when we saw a line out the door, but once we finished eating, we understood why.  There is no way that food that good wouldn't have a huge line.

A mere 5 weeks ago I posted a rave review on this business and its food; however, I must take a step back today from my initial review, but not because the food isn't any less than great.

I can understand the rapid success of a business making ownership proud of their product, but the immense price increases noted on the new menu (3rd increase in just a few months that I am aware of) are quite staggering to say the least! On 7/9/15 I ordered a 3 meat plate w/one side and drink for $13; yesterday, that same 3 meat meal ""deal"" came w/one side for $17.99, AN INCREASE OF 5 BUCKS and NO DRINK???? Not a single person in line when I ordered and still a 10 minute wait for my smaller 2 meat plate order (only due to new 
price increase). 

Similar price increases across the board on most all menu items; has success spoiled RSB so much that it has decided to cash in now at the expense of the customers who helped them get there or is this just another case of ownership killing the goose that lays the golden eggs?

The Pit Special consists of 4 meats and 3 sides. We got the brisket, pulled pork, 1/4 chicken and 2 spare ribs with kickin beans, bacon potato salad and onion straws with one order and cole slaw substituting the onion straws on another. I had to go up and place an additional order of corn bread, banana pudding and blueberry cobbler because the longer I stared at the menu, the more I wanted to try.

The portions were generous and each Pit Special fed 2 of us. The meat was awesome! All of it! I loved the chicken and ribs. Juicy, smoky, perfect. The sides were all delicious. The beans were a little too peppery for me but still a great flavor and the cole slaw & bacon potato salad were quickly inhaled. Oh and the BBQ sauce was sweet and also perfect.

3318786,2015-01-25,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Went there on January 20, 2015.  Been to Vegas many, many times.  We stay on the strip and pretty much always eat in the many restaurants/hotels on it. A few months before this trip saw Rollin Smoke on TV on one of the many food shows. I ""adore"", appreciate, and seek out authentic BBQ joints. The real stuff is not easy to find. Well this is it! The place is a dive and small. There were 3 of us and finding a table, even though they were busy with diners and take out orders, was easy. The various sides we had were good. The proof though is in the meats and it did not disappoint. The pulled pork, chicken, spare ribs, brisket and beef ribs were outstanding. They do not overload their rub with salt like way too many other places do. That potentially does not only tend to dry out the meat, but it overwhelms the flavor of it. Here it's perfect balance. Most BBQ places do not offer beef ribs. If you've never had one it's a must. These are not the beef ribs you might see in your grocery store's meat case. Those hardly have any meat on them before cooking, let alone after. These are short ribs. Yes, these you find in your grocery, but they are cut into short pieces for slow cooking and braising. I have never seen them in the case in full rack. I have a home smoker and I get them from my grocer and ask for the pack that they then get out of the cooler for me. These contain the full four rib rack.  ""Short"" has to do with where it comes from on the cow, not the length. But because we always see them cut up, its easy to make that connection.  Matter of fact, while not quite Fred Flinstone's bronto ribs that tips his car over, they're the closest thing to it.  They are 8"" - 10"" long and loaded with meat. While a slab of spare ribs stay in a smoker for about 4 hours, beef ribs have so much meat they are in there for 8+ hours. So next time in Vegas, take a cab or your rental car and go here.  We try to get to Vegas once or twice a year and now this will be added as one of our ""must"" eating places on every trip.

We were feeling a yen for BBQ after seeing Lyle Lovett & His Big Band over at the Smith Center, so I Yelp-ed Barbecue and the rave reviews for Rollin Smoke made our choice easy.  We arrived a little after 10pm and were told that they were out of meatloaf, yams, cornish hen, burnt ends, and beef ribs.  Since they advertise that they're open until midnight, I thought this was rather extensive a list of food to be out of.  We ordered a combo plate of brisket, chicken, hot links, pulled pork and pork ribs, along with sides of cole slaw, corn bread and corn fritters.  Hubby had the brisket and chicken, neither of which filled him up... kinda small portions of both.  My ribs were tough - not fall off of the bone tender at all.  The pulled pork and links were both OK, not anything special.  The highlight, in my opinion, was the corn bread.  I'd go back for more of that... it almost tasted like it had a coating of honey butter, which was delish.  Hence, the 2 stars.",JX1oFRvbUZ3GdCCcl3gAnQ,0,0,2,TgMtks9qW1nW6NbG8bUREQ

HOLY BAJAYZUZ!!! They are ""DAMN GOOD!!!"" The pictures of course do not do it justice. I get my combo. $13 well spent. This is all you really need if you're a beef rib connoisseur. They give you two Gangster Sized Ribs, a side (mine was the bacon potato salad), a slider bun, and a tasty cool beverage to wash it all down with on tap. The best DAMN BEEF RIBS I've ever had! They were freaken GIANORMOUS!!! Fall off the bone tender. I easily cut them off the bone and it looked like I had two big steaks. I cut off one nice slice and made a rib slider with the bun. I usually don't have trouble finishing my ribs, but these were like BRONTOSAURUS RIBS off of the Flintstones! FOR REALLY DOE!!!

They have beef ribs that are juicy and delicious.  Smoked 19 hours.  They have a rub on them and then you add BBQ sauce. The Pork ribs, chicken are very good too.  Haven't been able to find any food to complain about.  I get a little quiet when I am there enjoying the food so much.

People have complained about cost to portion, but the portions are big enough for my husband to be stuffed and full most of the day.  Cost wise, it seemed reasonable for good quality BBQ to me and I will be back frequently.

I tried the catfish and it has a crunchy cornmeal coating with and no weird after flavor you sometimes get with catfish.   I have had it twice now since it is so good.  Once in a basket and once as a poor boy sandwich.   Love it.  I can't decide which is my favorite the beef ribs or the catfish.

The sides I have tried are:  mac and cheese -flavor is good, but I prefer a baked thick cheese sauce over this one.
Hush puppies: pretty tasty
Corn fritters:  tasty, the corn is inside a breading.   Being from Virginia I have some expectations that probably aren't normal or liked by many others.  I felt these were good, but a little blander than I like.   I enjoy the corn tucked into a spicy hush puppy myself

Haven't had space for any desserts yet, but I will have to get some to go next time.  I am usually going somewhere else after.

They also will cook up a whole pig for parties.  Price varies depending on market price so call them.  Very cool.

Can't wait to eat there again.   Also if you go early enough in the day they have a cool electrical store called Kiesub next door.   If you are tech oriented you will enjoy it.",-R-Z97qJK3E1S8lQSda8Gg,1,0,5,tf4cgbMTo2pvsTta7k0ZZA

Sides: we had several and shared. Mac n cheese is pretty decent. Baked beans, tasty, but Ive had better. Cole slaw was unique and had a nice smokey flavor without the chipotle heat as suggested in the name. Potato salad was meh, typical potato salad with bacon crumbled on top. Now, the star of the sides show- those little corn nuggets. There is something magical in them. Not sure if they sprinkle opiates in them(kidding), cause they are seriously addicting.

This is TRUE bbq, you can tell they don't just slather bbq sauce on the meat and call it barbecued. You can taste the smokiness in the meat and it's unbelievably tender. There were 3 of us and we got the all you can eat so we were able to try a bunch of items on the menu:  chicken, brisket, pulled pork, hot links, spare ribs, baby back ribs, beef ribs, mac n cheese, coleslaw, fried okra, banana pudding, berry cobbler, and a root beer float.

The highlights were definitely the ribs. The spare ribs and baby backs were my FAVORITE things we tried. Spare ribs had a bit more kick and spice, and the baby backs were juicier and fattier (in a delicious, perfect way). The beef rib was also delicious - not to mention the biggest rib I've ever seen - but very rich and filling. The coleslaw was excellent to cut the richness, sweetness, and smokiness of the meal, and the fried okra was simple and perfect. Mac n cheese was also great (I totally judge a bbq place on hthe quality of their mac n cheese... ie Big Ern's at Container Park sucks). Brisket wasn't thrilling, but I admit I like my brisket with a little fat on it and this was quite lean.

The prices are insanely good, cheaper than Famous Daves or Lucilles, and the food is better! We got AYCE but would've been fine sharing the Pit Special, Rib Platter, & adding a couple beef ribs - which is basically exactly what we ordered, except we paid more because we chose AYCE and they added extra to the platter, which we didn't need and had quite a bit leftover. Also the service is awesome, they genuinely care if you're enjoying the food. The entire experience was great!  I can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu, I have my eye on the collard greens, loaded mash potatoes, and ""bbq parfait!""",hkO0mlhfqoyl1IFMULPT6Q,2,1,5,JaP3Q6-0TwziXiUMgk1HLw

I will say that the place is pretty small and seating can be hard to come by because of the popularity of this place. It is worth the wait though! The sides are al a cart. The hush puppies were interesting with peppers inside. It added a nice spice to the puppies but they would have been much better if they served them with butter.

To the extent it may add a little sizzle to the bbq fire, I've judged a lot of KCBS sanctioned bbq contests over the years, and I can state without hesitation that this is terrific bbq.  5 star all the way.

I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Will while I was there, and told him I thought he was definitely an expert bbq chef, and that his work rivaled the best of the best bbq places in the country.  Interestingly, one of my favorite dishes from Chef Will was the beef ribs, something that is never part of a genuine bbq competition.  The beef ribs were amazingly tender, with just the right amount of beefy, smokey flavor, and exactly the appropriate texture for easy biting and enjoying.  My son and I chose to take advantage of RS's amazing bargain - $35 for any amount of any items on the menu.  What a great way to sample everything.

We arrived at RS before its 10 am opening, and we were not the first in line.  This place has definitely been discovered, yet it deserves all of the new reviews it receives.  The ribs are perfectly cooked, the brisket is tender, juicy, and has just the right amount of smoke and meat flavor, the sides and desserts are absolutely terrific.  And yes, the corn nuggets are in a class by themselves.  Wow, are they special and addictive.  If that recipe ever gets out, it could be the beginning of world peace.

Even Brenda, behind the counter, was as helpful and nice as could be.  She made us feel right at home, helped us with our choices, explained the system for ordering and receiving the delicious dishes, and generally conveyed an honest, feel-good vibe.

No legitimate barbecue place could occupy a clean,modern building, right? For my first visit I had to try the rib platter ($22.99). With fall-off-the-bone tender baby back ribs with a good crust/bark and smokey flavor, thick and meaty spare ribs, and a massive, charred and fatty beef rib, this was a great option to try multiple proteins. For a side, I went with the mac 'n cheese. Made from elbow pasta and sitting in a thick, creamy cheese sauce topped with cheddar, it only served as a speed bump in my road to devouring the barbecue.

 Spare Ribs- Fall off the bone tender. Brisket- juicy. Pulled Pork- chopped to perfection. Chicken- tasty, skin and all. Hot Link- just the right amount of spice. The blueberry cobbler- ""Heaven , I'm in Heaven...""
The sides, bbq beans- great white rice topper! Corn Nuggets- should have ordered double. Mac & cheese- cheesy and Deeelish!!!
  Once a year I just might have to do the All-you-can-Eat for $35 but wouldn't eat for 3 days before going and just drink water.

Hubbys from Texas and cant find decent brisket here despite many a valiant effort. 

Until now. Heres the scoop:

This place is tucked behind a strip joint in the seedy area behind the mirage on highland drive.  

In fact, if you're squeamish about going to the hood, you may want to come at lunch time rather than dinner. 

If youre from out of town, dont expect much in the way of atmosphere. The decor is minimal. There are six tables total in the small front room, and maybe 6 or 8 inthe small side room.  . 

This place belongs on diners drive ins and dives for sure. 


Service was ok. At times we had to wait a few minutes for servers to emerge from the kitchen. However, When they werent cooking, they were polite & personable.

Despite all of this, the rating is five stars for the food alone. 

This food really is off the hook. 

1. Biggest beef ribs ive ever seen and thats not an exaggeration. 8oz of beef on each one at least. Sooo tender .& juicy, and the sauce was perfect

2. Best brisket in town, hands down. TENDER, MOIST, unlike at every other wannabe bbq place in town. 

3. The fried okra was the best ive had this side of the mississippi, OR north of the mason-dixon line. I dont like okra if its not perfectly cooked. This was. I was frankly shocked! 

4. Jalapeno coleslaw was very good if a bit hot!

5. Blackberry cobbler was pretty good. I enjoyed it. 

Portions are good sized & filling.

Note: Theres a soda machine tucked in an alcove thats hard to find. At first we thought all they had to drink was sweet tea with no ice lol

In short: if youre from the south and are craving authentic bbq, this place is worth the trip. Oh, and the prices are HALF that of lucilles bbq. Five stars!",6ehZ3X1gaHe-fxzndNRweA,9,4,5,DnYzcYZOuZUFK3XmvcDRaw

I did the two meat meal for $10.99. I got two short ribs and two strips of brisket on top of a soggy piece of white bread and a side of macaroni and cheese. I thought the short ribs were very good and would recommend those. The brisket was good and the macaroni and cheese was forgettable. My wife got the $7.99 brisket sandwich and thought it was pretty good.

Because we checked in via Yelp, we got a ""free dessert."" We ordered the Blue Bell Ice Cream Sundae. What they brought us was a shot glass sized plastic cup filled 2/3 with ice cream and 1/3 with whipped cream. If that dessert really costs 3.99, it is a complete rip off. It's more likely that they only gave us a sample size dessert as the ""free dessert"" that was advertised. Don't they know better than to cut corners with people who use Yelp? Whatever the case, I was less than impressed by that. 

Overall, I might stop back by here to give it another shot if I was in town for a bit and looking for a meal under $15 a plate (although they have many options that would put you over that limit, including an all you can eat thing for $25).

The sides we picked included the jalapeno cole slaw, bbq beans, mac and cheese and an extra side of dirty Vegas rice and cornbread. You know you've come to the right spot when everything you try is finished with an mmmm sound, a smile and a look of agreeable satisfaction to the person you are dining with. Just to describe a few, the brisket had an intense flavorful smoke on it you could see and was tender and delicious. The ribs were perfectly large and full of rich meat with a sweet intense spice rub. The jalapeno cole slaw was crunchy, a little spicy and had just enough dressing without drowning it. The mac and cheese was the perfect cheese sauce to noodle ratio with noodles cooked just right without drying out the dish. The cornbread was cooked perfectly,  sweet and salty with a warm layer of melted butter on the bottom that made it a little more guilty of being just so good.

I spent a good bit a time in Texas, so it ain't no surprise Texas barbeque ranks up there on my list of the some of the best eats this here world's got to offer - brisket, ribs, sausage and of course, smoke. There's this little barbeque shack in Austin that smokes its brisket for 16 hours, can you believe that - 16 hours? It comes out crispy and as black as coal on the outside but just as juicy as all get out on the in, with the prettiest pink smoke ring, it just about makes you wanna cry. Why, I spect it's about as close to heaven as one could ask for. The fella who runs this place is a real arteest - leavin' just the perfect amount a fat to make that brisket as moist as a Guadalupe mud pie. Anyway, when I thinks of barbeque, well, that's what comes to mind.

So it ain't no surprise to the folks that knows me that Rolling Smoke Barbeque just doesn't cut the brisket - or rather, it cuts too much of the brisket. Where's my crispy, burnt, smoky edge, where's my juicy, tender beef, and where's my smoke ring - what the hell did you do with my smoke ring? Boy, angels is weeping in Amarillo.

Now don't get me started on them there sausages - they's got so much flavor, why did you have to go and overcook it like that? I mean this stuff was drier than a West Texas desert. It's a good thing them corn fritters was damn tasty (course, I'd had better) or I'da went to bed hungry that night.

Okay, I'll admit it, for Vegas this shit ain't bad - hell it just might be the best barbeque joint in town, but that's no damn excuse. 

For pete's sake stop cutting off the good stuff  for dem sissy-pant  intellectual types from Henderson. They's so terrified of this part of town anyway, they drive in and out of here so fast you'd think their asses was on fire. 

This is barbeque dammit! People's food. We knows its got fat, we knows its got calories, we knows it ain't healty, but that's the way we likes it - if we's wanted healthy we'd go to Henderson. Besides, it'a give us a chance to put a scare in dem locals up there.

Shit gets a 3 cause this is Vegas, but don't go thinkin I'm all happy or anythin'. Ya'll make me miss Texas.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,6,4,3,xlOQMY_tETpyUt23alN5tw

Right away, Dusty suggests the Smoked Meatloaf which has become one of their regular items on their updated and expanded menu of deliciousness. We also got the Seafood Platter with Fried Catfish, Fried Shrimp, Hush Puppies and Fried Okra which they were out of, so one of the cooks suggested the Corn Fritters, and those did not disappoint!

The food here was awesome I ordered a Trio: brisket perfect smoke and great seasoning. Pulled pork flavor was spot on yet a little dry, nothing a little sauce didn't fix.  Ribs were the best I have had in LV. A friend of mine had the outlaw burger and I tried a small bite.  Perfect balance of flavor, my only suggestion is to not over mix the ground meat, also mix the meat when it is really cold. The texture of the burger was off for a med/mid rare burger, really dense as if the meat was over worked, it was like meatloaf. Other then that, its worth the wait.

And I look across of me and I see a guy that ordered his food after me, and he got the same exact burger before they got my order. 
So I ask the waiter why he got the burger before me when I ordered before him, and he just simply said that yours is coming up, playing it off knowing that he messed up. 
So after 10 mins later they bring my food, but I only  got my fries no burger. Waiter said its coming right out. 
After another 10 mins I finally get it. Was kind of hard to enjoy my food. But nevertheless fries were good and the burger was just as good. And the price for all the food was just. I would of given 4 stars if they didn't mess up my order and not try to play it off that it wasn't the waiters fault.

Those three words are the celebratory chants of a Rollin Smoke Barbeque meal. Alright so maybe the chef will encourage you to shout it when you leave, but it takes little convincing, trust me!

My knowledge of barbeque is limited, but I mean I own a Traeger Grill, does that count for anything? No? I didn't think so either... but while my Traeger makes deliciously smoked clean meats it doesn't compare to the smokey glistening glory of RSB. Their ALL YOU CAN EAT BBQ is what makes Vegas or America in general really freaking awesome. I mean sure we're in the top 10 for most obese countries, but hey at least we do it right, RIGHT? 

The special is $25 and includes EVERYTHING on the menu, except drinks ($2), you gotta buy that, BUT... its pretty much all you can drink too. Don't pass on the Outlaw Burger,  the beef ribs, or the nachos, but do pass on the pulled pork. Don't wear a belt, its useless, no belt will make look skinny after the massacre. You can of course also just order ala carte.

Take the booth with the pig, it will give you extra encouragement when you savage through his four legged cousins.

I recently tried the Biggin sandwich (brisket, pulled pork and sausage) and it was very tasty.  The sandwich was loaded with meat, literally falling off the bun, all of the meats were tender and had a good smoke flavor.  Along with my sandwich was a side of bacon potatoe salad, which was good.  The potatoe salad had good flavor and bacon in just about every bite.  Total for my sandwich, salad and drink ran me $11, which I think is a good value for quality food.
This is a spicier bbq than most people are used to, but it works.  It reminds me more of a kicked up Kansas City style bbq.  I stuck with the original sauce, which was plenty hot and did not try the spicy or the extra spicy.

All in all this place is making some pretty good bbq, which is much needed in Las Vegas.  The biggest draw back is that they are located on Highland next to Diamond Cabaret and they are only open until 6pm.

I get a text from a long time friend that he had some amazing BBQ and now is at a strip club next door getting lap dances.

Friend: Dude they have over a 100 beautiful women.

Me: What? Wait BBQ??

Friend: Sends pictures of this drop dead gorgeous brunett in a red,white, and blue bikini.

Me: What? Wait BBQ?

Friend: They even have this amazing short person stripper.

Me: What? Wait BBQ?

I had to make this my first stop straight from the airport...and I am glad I did. I was lucky I hit them at an off hour as right after we ordered...the line went out the door!

The food: Lean baby back ribs that are thick, meaty, smokey, and flavorful. Brisket to die for....incredibly tender, smoke ring ladden...OMG....get a combo of the sliced and chopped. 

I would also recommend the burnt ends ( this is something not a lot of places offer). Tons of crunch, tons of flavor, and little fat.

Great sausage and great smoked chicken...but I would not waist stomach capacity on those two.

They offer four great sauces: I had the momma sweet delicious...get it, it is delicious and complex. I also had the sweet country girl....both complemented the meats...and are great to drip the rolls and bread in.

Sides that were outstanding were the bacon potato salad, the jalapeno coleslaw and mac and cheese. I would pass on the cornbread (tasted very pedestrian), corn poppers ( hard as rocks if they are to go), and Yams ( too sweet and syrupy).

I was lucky enough to meet one of the owners and she was sweet as pecan pie and just  a nice person to talk to.......they care about what they serve and how they treat their customers and employees.....nice.

When you pull up into the parking lot, you can see the smokers outside. When you walk in, the smell of barbecue is in the air. The place is inviting and the staff (and owners) are very nice and genuinely proud of their food.

I got the trio platter for $13.99 which includes three meats, a side, and a fountain drink. I chose pork spare ribs (ribs+tips attached), beef brisket, and pulled pork, with mac&cheese as my side. You get two spare ribs as an item in the trio. Other choices were 1/4 chicken or links. It's quite a deal!

The pork spare ribs are amazing. Meaty, well-seasoned, great smoke ring, and the flavor was unbelievable. The brisket was quite good and the pulled pork was tender and flavorful. I wish I would have eaten the brisket and pulled pork before the spare ribs though, because the more delicate flavor of those meats was overtaken by the taste of the ribs.

Midway through my meal, I heard someone order a beef rib. I LOVE beef ribs and it's very rare that a barbecue place serves them. So I had to get that too. $6.99 for a rib, but completely worth it. It is intensely beefy in flavor and gets more and more juicy as you eat it. Sort of tough on the outside, but near the bone it was beyond anything I could have hoped for.

I was so impressed that I was texting my friends all through my meal. I ended up ordering almost $100 of barbecue to take back to my friends. It has been a week now, but my phone still smells like barbecue. One of my friends ordered some smoked hot links, so I got to try that as well and they are really good. I usually scoff at ordering links at a barbecue place, but these were special.

All told, I tried every meat on their menu except for the chicken and the smoked meat loaf. The pork spare ribs take home the ribbon, but everything else was not far behind. My friend's beef ribs did look much smaller than the one I got and he said it was dry all the way through, so ask for a big hefty one to make sure it's tender.

For side dishes, I would not recommend the mac&cheese. It wasn't that good. Other tables had jalapeno cole slaw, bacon potato salad, fried okra, and hush puppies. All those seemed to be well-liked.

The barbecue sauce is made in-house and is very good. It might be very slightly too sweet for my liking, but I order my barbecue with sauce on the side anyway, so I didn't mind much. They also make a spicy barbecue sauce which you can request.

Oh, they also have a buffet option. For $25, you get unlimited everything on their menu. If you like beef ribs, two beef ribs are $15. Eating four beef ribs and a side already puts you ahead.",M9hpSOJG67mGXuwlansGjg,1,1,5,qu8KXJPphucOjMyROcwvcA

He was super humble and couldn't stop being grateful for all the Yelpers who had Yelped about this place. He also helped us with making choices. With a party of two he suggested the trio plate and the pulled pork sandwich if we wanted to have variety since the plates were more than enough to share. We chose beans and mac and cheese as our sides, and I tell you it was also just as good and homemade tasting as the meats!

The sides I ordered were Mac N Cheese with an extra helping of Corn nuggets for another $2.50. The sides are glorious too. By far the best corn nuggets I had to date. I also received the banana pudding just by checking in thru Yelp, a $4 dessert for free. Just GLORIOUS.

The outlaw burger is a must try if you're just visiting from another city. It's basically a meatloaf type burger with onion rings on top, and tastes just amazing. 

For those of you that have already had the outlaw burger, I suggest getting the multiple meat platter with some sides. I like to get ribs, brisket, and chicken.

I would have given this place five stars last year, but this year it's four stars because they are always busy now, the lions are getting longer, and the portions seem to be getting smaller. They also changed their sweet potato side recipe, and I like the first version of this not the new one.

The most important thing I'd recommend is to go there on an odd day, like a tuesday or wednesday night, because on their busier peak periods the food isn't as fresh, I think they may just make huge batches of the common items and put them under heat lamps. If you go there for lunch you're guaranteed the freshest meats. And wow, are they worth it.

The meats are tender and flavorful, from the ribs that are soft and juicy, to the crisp snap of their spicy sausage. Their sides are to die for, particularly the loaded mashed potatoes and the baked beans. And you absolutely have to save room for dessert, their homemade banana pudding is a gift from the cosmos.

I wanted BBQ. Yelp led me to Rollin Smoke. We drove there. Upon arrival, I was somewhat skeptical, because this place is in a somewhat sketchy area. Surrounded by strip clubs, warehouses, and a few rundown places, it doesn't really look like the place you'd take your family. But when I got past that initial impression and walked inside, I knew I was in a good place.

The location is pretty small. There is seating out in front and two rooms of seating inside. Most of it is communal in style--just picnic-style tables with attached benches. The place is permeated with the smell of smoking meat. What a great smell! There are a number of good options on the menu.

As I do pretty much without fail at a BBQ joint that is new to me, I got a sample plate with some brisket and chicken. The combo comes with a few pieces of brisket, 1/4 of a chicken (a leg and a thigh), a piece of Texas toast, a couple of pickles, and a side. I got the green beans side (despite normally going for the BBQ beans) and ate that first. I was pretty impressed with just the green beans. They were fresh and crisp and were seasoned to perfection. Then I worked my way into the chicken. It was seasoned perfectly as well and cooked just right. It was nice and tender and delicious. I often skip the skin on chicken, but this was great stuff, and I ate it all. Finally, the star, the brisket. Brisket is the standard by which I measure any BBQ joint. This is excellent brisket. It's sliced to the right thickness. It's nice and tender and falls apart with just a little work with the fork. And it's delicious. With or without any added sauce, this stuff rocks!

Speaking of sauces, there are a few options. I went with the Arkansas version, which turned out to be pretty darn good. When I first squeezed some out of the bottle, I feared that it was too liquidy, but the consistency was great when put straight onto the brisket itself.

My friend got a brisket salad, and I ended up finishing it for her. It too was delicious. I'm not really a fan of romaine-based salads, but the greens and tomatoes were all fresh, the peppers were spicy, and the brisket was delicious on the salad as well.

There are a few options that are intriguing to me for when I visit in the future with a healthy appetite. The $35 all-you-can eat option is a rarity among BBQ joints. And the picture of the burger on the wall made the burger look like quite the challenge.

This is great BBQ, not just for Vegas, but in general.",gELwad3XC2fthoffd5Kafg,3,0,5,pRZskL9DwK2FpMydJweQtw

The brisket and pulled pork are decent but when at the Rollin Smoke Barbeque you will definitely want to order their ribs.

Their pork baby back ribs has an excellent smoky flavor to it and the meat is very tender. It isn't quite fall off the bone but nonetheless it is very tasty. The prices aren't too bad either and the quality of the food puts it above Famous Dave's.
The baked bean sides is about average but the macaroni and cheese is quite creamy and smooth. The noodles they use for it is different and the cheese isn't as sharp. It's more of a mellow flavor. The macaroni and cheese isn't bad, it is simply different.

The portions unfortunately aren't large for a two meat combo.

My GPS took me down some road that I have never heard of or been on. It seemed like I was in an industrial area.  I saw a sign with the name of the restaurant clumped up with other businesses. I pulled in the driveway. There were two police cars already parked there.  I messaged William about the location. He said there are strip clubs in the area.  ""Thanks!"", I messaged back.  A little worried, I walked in anyway. 

The place was about half full and I stood in line to order. The cashier, Dave, was very friendly and helpful. I decided to get the Platter which had 3 baby back ribs, 2 St. Louis spare ribs, and one beef rib.  Then I had to select a side dish. I figured that I knew what Mac and cheese was about, so I got the Corn Nuggets.  Yes, I didn't know what that was either. ..  Dave said that it's Sweet Corn,  breaded, and deep fried. Intriguing!  Let's try it!  Then, Dave give me a cup. I asked if this meal came with a free drink because I noticed that the drinks are $3 with refills.  No... I got a complimentary beverage!  Yay! Thanks Dave!  The soda dispenser is self service! !

I guess I was supposed to sit down and have the meal brought to me.  The other room had a table occupied by police officers. I sat in the corner, under the television. Another option was outside seating, but it was dark and cold. I left my jacket in the car, prepared to battle some ribs. ..

The Beef Rib was on the top. I couldn't stop eating it. The moist meat fell off the bone. It was like smokey, soft, stew meat. The charred ""koge"" fat layer on the top was scrumptious! I wanted to give equal attention to the baby back ribs and the St. Louis spare ribs, but I couldn't let go of that Beef Rib. It was that good!  Later, I realized that I ate everything without sauce. There were containers on the counter, but I was so mesmerized that I stayed in my seat. I got up for a soda refill and a take out container & package which are self service along with utensils.

I wasn't able to finish everything in one sitting,  so I brought it to my hotel room and had a perfect midnight snack! The only thing that might turn some customers off would be a cockroach.

It's not far from the strip in distance, yet feels a million miles away.  This hole in the wall restaurant feels like it was transported from some small town down south, not the glitz of Las Vegas (in a good way).  Your olfactory sensors are hit with the heavenly smell of smoked meat even before you cross the threshold (prepare to leave with a new smoke cologne too).  

You counter order and pick up your utensils before heading to a table.  You can sit at the picnic tables by the counter, or cross over into the dining room that houses additional tables and a couple TVs.  Tables are equipped with a roll of paper towels and their signature BBQ sauce, which is a little sweeter than traditional Texas sauce, but good.

This trip we got combo plates of Sliced Brisket with Fried Okra and Pulled Pork with Kicken Beans and Jalapeno Coleslaw.  The brisket and pork were perfect.  Both tender and smokey.  The pork had some awesome burnt end pieces that were fantastic.  The fried okra was good.  The Kicken Beans had some heat and pieces of the smoked meats in the sauce.  Definitely a side I would order again!  I did not care for the Jalapeno Coleslaw too much.  It had a bunch of black pepper that overwhelmed the flavor of the dish.

I need to remember to keep this place in the rotation a little more often!",Dgk0Wdoh7HPjhKQEPBU_jQ,10,7,4,nmkiOXtvV9nGh-XyTbPI3w
3873627,2016-11-25,2,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"They unquestionably have some of the best BBQ I've ever had. So, if that's all you care about, read no further. 

However, on Wednesday I ordered a five meat platter for my wife & I for our thanksgiving, along with a half chicken. The total was around $45.

I was asked if I wanted some sauce with my order...

Well, yeah, of course I do: 'I'll take a little of each,"" I said. 

Not only did RS charge me extra for the three sauces, they were half full. I was able to use them on my pulled pork & chopped brisket. However, my chicken, hot links & ribs went without -- essentially wasted.

Now, not only did RS charge me for sauce without telling me, NONE of the three small containers were complimentary. They gave me zero sauce on a $45 order. An order I intended to use for my Thanksgiving meal. That's a 1/4 chicken, a 1/2 chicken, pulled pork, brisket, and hot links with zero sauce included. 

Unfortunately, with no sauce, I scrapped those plans and went to Bachanal at Caesars.

I have one issue and one issue only with RS: they do not seem to genuinely care about their customers. They do great business, they are always busy and they clearly take that for granted. Their prices are already astronomically high, but to not include sauce (and when you do, you charge without telling, and still come up short) is just bad business. It goes beyond just being 'cheap'; it's a slap in the face.

Rollin Smoke is certainly making money. They've raised their prices by at least 15% in two years . Yet, they're too cheap, or they care too little, to complete their meals. 

It's unfortunate because it doesn't need to be so difficult. Sometimes, it's the little things that make all the difference. 

EDIT: 4/29/17 -- still haven't been back. I was at the Great American Foodie Fest at Sunset Station last night & just shook my head walking by the RS stand.",fQFkGWuZERnQI5_9qRi72g,14,1,3,ilINYZlzu5eYLce9ebqhbg

Like a typical Yelper I checked out the reviews immediately after seeing his post. I was impressed that they have so many reviews and 4 1/2 stars average rating, you really can't beat that. To be quite honest and I hate to put it this way but Rollin' Smoke is meritocracy at it's finest. My friend and I shared the pit special with brisket, pulled pork, chicken and ribs with sides of fried onions, mac n cheese and corn bread. We also ordered banana pudding for desert. I hate to say it, but my favorite part of the meal was the fried onions.. Yah, sad I know? The ribs were pretty tasty, but everything else was kind of blah. I can't really go into detail, maybe because it wasn't that good to me or memorable. Maybe it was a bit too authentic for my liking or the possibility they BBQ theirs Arkansas style. I'm only guessing the owners of this BBQ joint are from Arkansas considering they have University of Arkansas memorabilia around the place.  I tried a BBQ place out last week and I would definitely choose them over Rollin' Smoke. I was not a fan of the sauce either, to the point I scraped it off ribs. The prices here are pretty reasonable, so I can't complain about that. The inside of the restaurant is really rough around the edges, but maybe that's the vibe they are going for? To add to that, the restaurant is the oddest place one could think of. Pretty sketchy in some ways, but that doesn't turn customers away considering there was a good amount of people eating there on a Tuesday night.

While Rollin Smoke's location may be subtle and discrete, its food is definitely not. All their smoked meats and sauces are gluten-free. The meat here is simply phenomenal. If you you're a big boy or girl that can eat, go for the AYCE for $35 - anything on the menu is fair game. 

The times I've been here, I've stuck to the combos. The pit special is more than enough for two people if you like variety. I love the brisket, pulled pork, and spare ribs, but less of a fan of the chicken and hot links. Today's visit, my friend and I shared the rib platter special and were not disappointed. The baby back ribs and St. Louis spare ribs were some of the best I've had. One beef rib would've been enough to share, but we added on an extra for $6. To top it off, we added a 1/2 pound of burnt ends with a side of waffle fries and corn nuggets. I've had burnt ends before, but they were nothing like these. These burnt ends were juicy, tender, and so flavorful that they required no sauce. The corn nuggets are now my favorite side! I've also liked the mac & cheese and cornbread in the past. 

Despite having over a thousand rave reviews, I like to think that this joint is still one of Vegas' best kept secrets. It reminds me of Freddy's BBQ from House of Cards - amazing ribs and food, but only if you're in the know.

I paid an extra $3 for the burnt brisket tips by recommendation of the cashier, and she wasn't kidding. It was smoky, tender, and a bit spicy from the peppercorn crust. Since mine was a two item combo, I also got the pulled pork- not too salty, tender shreds of pork. Served with one slice of white bread and a side. I got the chipotle coleslaw since I wanted some greens with my heavy meal.

3888390,2013-08-20,6,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"This is, by far, the best BBQ in Las Vegas.

Here's why:
THE BUSINESS MODEL!!!

-great BBQ, including catfish and beef ribs and banana pudding and BBQ nacho fries; choices you don't find at many other BBQ places.
-a family of charming characters who treat everyone like they were their best friend.
-a menu that overcomes the ""combination"" curse. 
What's that, you say? 
A combination curse is a combination plate that isn't exactly what you want, but you order it anyway, because you have no other choice.
At RSB, they overcome this curse because all elements of the BBQ universe are available ""a la carte"". 
For example, I didn't want a brain-dead combination with a ""carb"" side and drink...I wanted nothing but protein. So I ordered, a la carte, a beef rib (gigantic!), a piece of white chicken and a piece of catfish. I dare you to find that ""combination"" at any other BBQ place in town. 
It was sensational!

Oh and I almost forgot, one of the best burgers in town (next to Fat Choy) aptly named the ""Outlaw Burger"". 
You eat The Outlaw Burger, and when you go outside, your car has magically morphed into a tricked-out Harley!!

If you're a local, you're crazy to go anywhere else.
If you're a visitor, it's half a mile from the strip, just down the road from the Trump Tower.


Side note: 
They should do a reality show at Rollin' Smoke. 
If Pawn Stars, and Duck Dynasty, can be successful cable shows, a show set at this place can be blindingly, staggeringly successful! 
Kind of a combination between the Diner shows and the Down-Home shows.

We ordered on the right side where you enter and then waited at a table on the more dining room side.  I ordered the meat trio with pork, ribs, and hot link.  I also showed them my Yelp check in offer for a free pudding with a sandwich which they honored even though I didn't order a sandwich.  Since the trio is more expensive, I guess it doesn't matter.

I could tell from the time we walked in that they did their own smoking.  The place is heavy with the smell of smoke.  In fact, the first thing I did when I got home was to change my shirt.

The trio of meats was OK.  The pork was lukewarm at best and was dry.  It needed their BBQ sauce.   Two of us had gotten that and both were the same so there was something not right with the heating in the kitchen.  The meat fell off the ribs and was very good.  I'm surprised I liked them as much as I did.  The hot link was also good.  As a side I got the kicken beans but there was nothing these beans were going to kick.  They were just normal baked beans with some spice.

The banana pudding was OK.  It was nothing special and I'm sure it comes from some kind of bulk make your own package.  The serve yourself soda was great.  I was really thirsty after the hike and I went back and refilled several times.

I guess I sealed the deal yesterday and realized I'm really not a BBQ person.  Lunch was OK but it's nothing that I would crave nor go out of my way to get again.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,8,9,3,2laxVUpEpOwVEjJ850f0UA

Now that I have recovered from the behemoth meal that was Rollin Smoke Barbeque, I can now gather myself to write this review.

First of all, if you come here expect to wait in a line. Don't worry though, the line moves fairly quickly.

Here's what we ordered:

1/2 slab baby back rib plate (4/5) - Very meaty ribs, not fall off the bone but still juicy. I give it a 4 instead of a 5 because they didn't remove the casing from the outside of the rib and it made it a little hard to eat. Overall, I liked it and would order again.

Outlaw burger (5/5) - My boyfriend who is a total burger aficionado tells me that this is the best burger he's ever had! Keep in mind that he loves bbq and bbq sauce so this burger did not cramp his style. There are tender pieces of brisket paired with ground beef, fried onion strings, barbeque sauce. Don't be shy because this WILL get messy!

Service is good here and people are really friendly. Unlike other casual dining places, the staff actually comes to check up on you after they've delivered your food. 

Oh yeah and we checked in on yelp and they gave us a free ice cream sundae due to our burger order. Can't beat that!",vHD6gH1GU9-qtTP_b-hypg,1,2,4,RM0Ms1BpmNVHU2JYmA2USQ

Smoked meats are fantastic, but without a uniqueness in choice of woods ( Bleh - traditional mesquite and hickory  :-P ) or without some real body of unique seasonings,,, what have ya got?  If flavor WAS there,, I didn't taste it, and I ate slowly. I had the pulled pork and brisket. Both of these should be oozing with flavor.. I had to lightly sauce every bite to enjoy it.
However, the brisket was cooked perfectly, pork a little over but no biggie..the table-side sauce is excellent which got me thinking... Maybe that was their intention? To leave it bland and let the customers sauce it to their liking?

When my wife asked co workers who have been long time Vegas residents where to get the good BBQ, this was the place frequently mentioned.

Recently we tried this place out, and my brother and nephew went as well.  Everyone was very full and very satisfied when we left.

To find this place is by word of mouth, or you'll have to google it, because it sits a bit behind the Vegas strip in a more industrial area and chances are you would not happen upon it by mistake.

As soon as you drive up, you get that smell. That smoked BBQ smell that makes your mouth instantly water.  

The prices are a little up, but worth it for the food that you get. I personally ordered the three meat plate, which I chose to be the ribs, the pulled pork and the sausage.  My wife got the burnt ends for her meat.  All of it was crazy good.  Large portions, juicy meat and just totally full of flavor.  Be warned that while their food is not crazy spicy hot, there is a little kick to it.  The only thing I didn't find worth it was the side orders, I paid like four bucks for a side of coleslaw that was not life changing. 

My nephew for the Outlaw Burger, which I'll load a picture off. This thing is every bit as big as it looks in the picture, and the hardest time he had was trying to figure out how to eat it.  He said he loved every bite of it, and has talked about coming back to Vegas from Cali to have another one.  

Overall this is some of the best BBQ I've ever had and I liked the squeeze bottles of lots of different flavors of sauces they have all over. If you're in town, you gotta check this place out.",MonzeL9WteeNAqYZG07cIw,1,0,4,6t8iYlMzIQaEqBZTc-ff9g

The restaurant is way off the beaten path, on strip club alley, in a dank industrial part of town, under a freeway overpass. I was impressed with the overfull parking lot and the line out the door, thinking this must be some good stuff. 

The place seemed kind of run down, and the Aquarium was really disappointing. I guess it lets you know how much they care about their place. After all, who pays thousands, or tens of thousands for a custom aquarium, then replaces the amazing fish with feeder goldfish, the tank was dirty and the special features didn't function. 

Back to the restaurant though, so I order, and while ordering my wife wanted some sauce to go, and the menu has prices for cup, pint, quart, gallon or whatever. I ordered a pint of house and a pint of Carolina. We ordered to eat there and paid the $50 for the 2 of us. We went and sat down, about 20 minutes later I went looking for our food, that never came, and found a girl, food runner, whatever, with our food boxed up to-go in a bag wandering around looking for us... Confusing since I ordered for dine in...

Took the bag to my wife and we opened it to start eating, and there were in addition to the 2 Styrofoam clamshells with our food, like 16 little tiny 2oz sauce ramekins. Not the glass Mason jars in the case. 

I thought the meatloaf was borderline just ok, It pretty much just crumbled apart, had to use the mashed potatoes as a binder to keep the bits of meat on the fork. I make better meatloaf myself, in fact I smoke better food in general than they do. My wife had the Pulled Pork, she ""enjoyed"" it, but didn't finish it

As a BBQ connoisseur, having enjoyed BBQ in Texas and several other states, I would have to say this does not even come close to ranking as good BBQ.

We got there no problem with the GPS. I was worried that the place would be crowded since I was dinner time but we just beat the rush. 
The plan was to order the ""pit special"" 4 meats and 3 sides. We got burnt ends, pulled pork, quarter chicken, spare ribs, one beef rib, corn nuggets, loaded smashed potato and bacon potato salad.
Everything came out in about 3 minutes which was great since I was starving. The burnt ends were delicious the pulled pork a little dry, the chicken breast was moist since most times chicken breast is dry. I tried the spare ribs and my was I surprised they were the best tasting spare rib I ever had. Great smoke and tender. Not hanging off the bone but still on and but so tender and flavorful and it came off the bone with a bite. The beef rib for me was no disappointment either. Big moist and the same as the pork ribs. They were a little fat but that's the way I like them. Probably too fat for some but that is where the flavor is.
Corn nuggets were good and the other sides were average.

With over 700 reviews and a 4.5 star average, as well as numerous esteemed Yelpers referring to Rollin Smoke Barbecue as the ""best bbq in town"" I had fairly high expectations for my first visit. Sadly, I was not blown away.

Allison S., Dyanna L. and I met up at Rollin Smoke with our men for dinner on a recent Saturday evening. From the parking lot the place smelled amazing, so we quickly got in line to order. Rollin Smoke is a order-first-then-seat-yourself kind of establishment which I have no problem with. I do wish the tables were wiped down more regularly though, as the one we were at was rather dirty. 

Our food was ready very quickly. My husband and I both got the 2 meat plate; brisket and chicken for him, ribs and pork for me. Each came with a side (green salad for him, loaded mashed potatoes for me) as well as a 'roll' which is really just a slice of bread. 

For me, good bbq means good ribs, and ribs will always be what I judge BBQ on.  This is where Rollin Smoke fell flat. The ribs were tough, not the fall-off-the-bone that I expected (and read about in other reviews). The flavor was ok, certainly not amazing. The pork was better, my husband's brisket was good, and Allison let me try some of her hot link which was excellent. 

Perhaps it was just an off evening for Rollin Smoke? I will certainly go back and try the ribs again, but for the time being I can not give Rollin Smoke more than an A-OK rating.

NOTE: The price for All-You-Can-Eat has gone up to $34.99. Website is not updated as of 1/5/15.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,8,2,3,zuR342a9piAvn7JL4D0Vew
4054674,2013-04-07,9,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Here's the rundown regarding Rollin Smoke BBQ;

1.  Huge, I mean gigantic portions.  See pictures for yourself
2.  No one can compete with their prices when it comes to BBQ.
3.  Hole in the wall type restaurant, my favorite type 
4.  Great service
5.  Conveniently located near my favorite type of clubs.  Joking...I think. 

When I first met Heather H, the first thing that came out of her mouth wasn't ""Hi, nice to meet you"".  It was ""have you been to Rollin Smoke?, You have to go there ASAP"".  Actually, she did say ""hi"", but Rollin Smoke stuck in my head.  If you don't know Heather H, she's a well respected Yelper in the Las Vegas community.  And if Heather and her boyfriend love the food here, then it must be pretty damn good.  Read the reviews, rarely any complaints from anyone about Rollin Smoke. 

When I found out that we were having dinner at Rollin Smoke one Friday evening, guess who I reached out to?  Heather H of course.  I thought it was funny that while she responded to my questions, she was also on her way to Rollin Smoke for lunch.   She's a die hard for sure.  As for her suggestions, she suggested something she never had and the rest of the menu. I guess this means a Win Win situation for me. 

My Meal:
Chicken and Ribs Combo:  Read this closely.  Don't look at prices because it's deceiving. The portions are huge!!! Portions are so big, that I only was able to finish half my chicken and one rib.  I loved the chicken BBQ. It's cooked perfectly, chicken still tender (not dry), and the flavors poured out of it with every bite. As for the ribs, I only had one and thought it was just okay. I hate to admit that I've had better ribs elsewhere. But for the price, it was a great deal. 

Their mac and cheese is a must eat as well as their corn bread on steroids.  I finished the mac n cheese, but could only muster half my corn bread.  Both had a little kick to it.  Yes, even the corn bread had a kick to it. 

Service was pretty good too.  You need to order at the counter and the food is served to you.  Like most BBQ places, the food does take a little time to cook so be patient and enjoy your company. 

I ate a lot, Terri R ate a lot, and Chad S ate a lot. I guess that equals to all of us eating a lot.  $40 for 3 people to eat on a Friday night is not bad at all.  It's such a bargain here that you'll even be left with a few bills to hit the nearby clubs and make it rain.

Two weeks ago, I took some co-workers here and one of them ordered the fried shrimp.  I know!  Stupid, right?  WRONG!  Because she eats like a bird, she gave each of us a piece and dang!

I'd have to say this is my favorite BBQ of all time. I'm not a big meat eater, so it says something if I LOVE a place that serves mostly meat. When I lived in Vegas, I heard about this place from a friend/coworker who told me that I needed to try this place out since their food was delicious, and boy am I glad I was able to try it out. 

This is a little hidden gem and is kind of hard to find if you're not familiar with the area. I got lost trying to find this place and I lived in Vegas, the very first time I came to this location. The parking lot is very small as it shares it with the other businesses in the area. A lot of the time people have to park on the street or in a nearby parking lot and walk over to the restaurant.

From the outside of the building, it looks really small with hardly any space to accommodate the crowds that come here, but when you enter, there is a small seating area and then they have another room with more tables as well as some picnic type tables outside. 

I love how when you get out of your car, you instantly are hit with the delicious aroma of cooking BBQ. So delicious you can almost taste it. 

The person taking orders are quick and efficient while still being polite and cheerful. They're very knowledgeable about their menu and can give suggestions on what to try if it's your first visit and you just are too overwhelmed with the options they offer. When your food is ready, they either call out your name or call out what is ordered, so keep your eyes and ears open or you might miss your food. They usually come around calling names several times though, so you shouldn't have a problem getting your food. 

Food comes out quickly, smelling delicious and looking even better. Food is fresh and hot when it is delivered to your table. I've tried several of their items on their menu and have been satisfied with just about everything. The Club Wrap ($11.99) was one of my favorite items to have here. It has just the perfect amount of meat with lettuce, tomato, bacon, and cheese. I also loved their BBQ Smoked wrap. Note, I didn't see this as an option on their menu anymore, but I'm sure you can ask them to make it and they'd be more than happy to do so. Also the ""Spudtastic"" ($12.99), Outlaw Burger ($13.99), Hush Puppies ($3.50), Fried Okra ($3.50), Corn Nuggets ($3.50), Cheesy Mac N Cheese ($3.50), Waffle Fries ($3.50), and Loaded Mashed Potato ($3.50)  are some of the items they offer that are simply delicious. 

You can just order the meat item or make it a combo and get a side and drink to finish off your meal. However, unless you're super hungry or can eat a lot of food, I'd suggest you bringing a friend along so you can share as they give you good size portions. I'm always stuffed whenever I leave and I usually don't do a combo meal. 

My experience was always a positive one whenever I came here and I look forward to making another trip here in the near future!!",GWs9J6lIUqrySTxl6uXO0A,26,29,5,A-s2z4DAt43BdhhQd6sSLg

The Arkansas sweet sauce paired perfectly. 

I was craving a hot dog all week so I had the dog from the kids menu. It was a big, beefy dog on a hoagie roll. It was more than a kid should eat. House sauce on this one was awesome. Added a side of loaded mashed potatoes. Not sure, but these might be instant potatoes. They reminded me of KFC which isn't a bad thing. Topped with cheddar, green onion and bacon; it was delicious.

The place smells great when you walk in the door... the guys, there were really nice and welcomed us in...

The menu is diverse... 

I had the three meat plate...  brisket, ribs, and pulled pork. 

Brisket was really good... Ribs were even better... and the Pulled Pork was KILLER! 

Portions were generous... flavors were fantastic!  The potato salad had some spice to it and so did the pickles. 

My wife had two meats, pulled pork and brisket... she raved about both.  She is a huge brisket fan, and she said it reminded her of being in Texas.  She loved it! 

I think the guys there have a handle on the BBQ side of things... it's great! Where I think, they could use some help is in the dessert's area... they were just alright.  I wasn't there to have dessert... so not a big deal... but... it's the only weak link about the place which stood out to me.  Dial that in... it's a 5+ star place.

4074385,2017-03-31,2,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I have a true love / hate relationship with Rollin Smoke. I grew up in North Carolina so I know really good bbq, and RS is sometimes good and sometimes bad. There's no in between with their food here, it's either delicious or nasty. I used to dine here twice a month but my last three experiences in a row were pretty awful, with very fatty meat, dried out chicken, and poorly prepared side dishes. 

My regular order is the two item plate with a chicken breast and chopped brisket. The chicken especially can be hit or miss (and lately it's been a very big ""miss""). I usually get the collard greens as my side and they are always delicious (it's easy to cook good collards, though), and of course freshly made items like the waffle fries are always tasty. The green beans and chipotle coleslaw are only good half of the time.

The prices here are really outrageous. I'm sorry, but a Saturday afternoon lunch for two shouldn't set me back $50. If you order extra sides, get ready to open your wallet (crazy expensive at $3.50 each for the portion sizes that you get). And don't get fooled by the people taking your order, they'll ask ""what bread do you want?,"" and will suggest the hush puppies -- but they are NOT INCLUDED and will cost you even more money. I think this kind of ""fake"" upsell is dishonest; it shouldn't be presented in a way where your average customer would assume that's a free bread choice. What you do get free is a slice of white loaf bread underneath your meat. 

The freshly brewed iced tea is really good, and they have both sweet and unsweetened tea choices. Note that they do NOT provide Splenda so bring your own (I always do). The house bbq sauces are tasty, make sure you try them all. They have communal squirt bottles on the condiment counter. 

If you dine in, note that the seating is extremely limited and on busy days you will be jockeying for a place to sit and eat (because people rudely claim their space before their party is even finished waiting in the long line to order, which messes up the flow and then you have people with their food walking around with nowhere to eat it). Your clothes will also reek of smoke for the rest of the day. 

After three strikes in a row of mediocre meals, I'm sorry to say I've taken this joint off my dining rotation. I may be willing to give it another try in the future, but I am in no hurry to do so anytime soon.",BQkC6RneYfvfG6wRe0hsvQ,18,4,2,-bFlvUsbf4gWwdRzegMupw

We ordered beef brisket and ribs.  Even my 4 year old who generally hates to eat anything but sweets was excited about our meal.  The guy working the counter was really sweet and when he heard my story brought out an assortment from the back to try... Hot Links, Pulled Pork and bbq'd chicken.

I brought a friend in today for dinner. It was her first time, so she spent a few minutes to look at the wall-sized menu. I also found myself staring and trying to decide what to get. I wasn't feeling up to tackling a big portion today, so I didn't get the outstanding Outlaw Burger again. Instead, I went with the Catfish Po Boy ($8.99) and a dessert of Country Berry Cobbler (free with purchase of sandwich and Yelp check-in).

I spent some time nibbling on my friend's Dad's Favorite, which is actually a sandwich (and thus qualifies for the dessert, although we didn't know it at the time). The brisket, pork, and hot links were all pretty tasty, although my friend could have done without the hot links because she is even more heat-averse than I am. She definitely went for a soda refill at least once.

My po boy took upwards of 10 minutes longer to come out, which I felt was a good sign. It was worth it for that catfish. It was quite moist and flaky, properly seasoned, and lightly crunchy on the outside. The catfish was definitely the star. No complaints about the spicy and tartar sauces, which I ended up spreading all over the sandwich. Lettuce was fine, lemon was helpful, and tomato brought a nice lightness. Only thing I would have liked is if the bread was buttered or something. The bread was merely toasted, and it actually looked a bit burnt, but thankfully had none of that off-putting flavor.

The country berry cobbler actually came out at the same time as the po boy. Unfortunately, by the time I was ready for dessert, the whipped cream had died. I actually had the peach cobbler last time, and while I would probably take the peach if forced to choose one, the berry cobbler is also very good and has enough of a tartness to offset the sweetness. It was also still warm, since it was served in a foam bowl, but I'm thinking that it contributed to the downfall of the whipped cream. I'll have to remember to try to ask for a delayed dessert presentation if I do this again.

I noticed that at least 3 tables had people doing the AYCE, and that made me wish that I hadn't had lunch today. I definitely want to try the all you can eat option some time. I enjoy that sort of thing, and I would finally be able to get my hands on all of their meats at once. Maybe I'll be ready to bump it up to 5 stars on that day, but until then, I still highly recommend Rollin Smoke Barbeque to all lovers of meat - and catfish.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,5,2,4,Hnh39kuR-XYNcc-QS9MP2w

This is the best example of a small business that through word of mouth has become a smash hit with people everywhere!!! Rollin Smoke has come along way in such a short time, I remember when you could see the chefs in kitchen cooking up a storm from the front counter and the area when you walked in was the only place to sit.

Situated between the strip and the 15 highway, Rollin is on South Highland Dr inside a small strip mall. You will see the smoker and or food truck out front, so be sure to keep your eyes peeled.

The best recommendation for a Rollin Smoke lunch or dinner is: Everything..... From the Ribs to the Brisket and home made deserts, this place won't disappoint you. If your hungry go after the Outlaw Burger... It's one tough burger to get into, and you will be full after.

I will say due to being on a few tv shows recently, the lines might start to increase, so get in early!!!!!

The guys were amazing, coming early to setup and checking in on every one to make sure all was good throughout the party.

Neither the bellhop at the hotel nor the taxi driver had  heard of this place and we had to pull out our smart phones to map the way there. Located in a semi-industrial area that's just 10 minutes away from the strip, it took a bit of convoluted driving to actually get there. It's not a fancy place, simple benches, plastic utensils, noisy, with an order counter and serve your own drinks, but oh man... the food... the food! (They also have sweetened tea - have to have that in a Southern BBQ place, right? Right??)

This place was suggested by a couple of local friends when I was visiting and we met up for dinner. We got what I think was the ""Pit special"" which was the variety platter, 5 meats and 3 sides - Pulled pork,1/4  chicken, hot links, ribs and brisket - an extra order of the corn nuggets - think of tater tots made with kernels of corn and corn meal, green beans and coleslaw. The slaw was good but we had to dole out the corn nuggets to be fair or any one of us would have hogged them all.

Best Southern BBQ I've had in a long, long while - so good I did not try any of the other sauces - they make several - on the meat. They did not drown everything in sauce either, but encouraged you to try the various sauces. Crisp, well seasoned chicken skin, saucy (but not too saucy) pulled pork, ribs with just the right amount of char, tender brisket, spicy links... it was all good.

Then it was time for dessert and the chef was walking around talking to customers and we asked about dessert, with a friend asking if ""Mama's Banana Puddin"" was made of real custard. Hoo boy, you'd think we just insulted his Momma. ""You think I would use box vanilla pudding? Man, you gotta stand there and stir that custard by hand or it ain't good! That's the only way you can make Banana puddin!""

We settled on the banana pudding and the blackberry cobbler and shared - because we were so full from dinner (and we had left overs to take home) - we scraped those bowls clean! Talk about greed... I was tempted to get another! The Banana custard was smooth and tasty, the consistency of the custard just perfect - none of that grainy fake pudding mix in that!. The cobbler topping was not overly sweetened which let the blackberry taste shine through.

Altogether, a wonderful gustatory experience - and the cost for this wonderful experience? Oh... about $12 each.",0orGVjaNx1Hzh12vNRay0g,5,1,5,Hd4JnXEei1O3qrDfStKEcw

Today was a down day and the 1st time was a better day.  I was at a 3.5 after the 1st time and gave it a 4, today it earned it's three.  

Had the rib combo 3 baby back,  2 spare, 1 beef. The beef rib came out sauced,  I didn't expect that as it didn't last time.  I sent it back and asked for one without sauce. When I got the plate back it was the same rib with sauce rubbed off. This was highly irritating. Wonder what else was done to my food while it was sent back.  I don't dare to let my mind wonder that road.  I should have been served a new rib that had never been sauced.  Not one that was wiped off. Sigh, urg, I seem to be more upset about this the more I think about it. The beef rib was good this time not as good as the 1st time.  The baby backs were better than the spare but both were underdone as neither pulled away from the bone easy and were kinda tough, even though they had good flavor. Definitely not as good as the 1st time. 

The 1st time I also had the brisket which was above average but not great.  Also had pulled pork that was pretty good.  

All the meats here do have varying degrees of a Smokey taste,  as well varying degrees of smoke rings.  So they are cooking these meats with the right methods. 
 
For sides I have enjoyed the corn nuggets and fritters both times, but I am not sure if these are not just prepackaged items instead of homemade. 

Last but not least the desserts. I had the berry cobbler today.  I would definitely stay away from this item as it wasn't very good.  Ordering the peach cobbler and banana pudding seem like your safest and tastiest bets for dessert. 

In summary if this was my 1st time it would be my last time. Still can't believe I didn't get a fresh rib instead they just wiped it off. If this would have been my 1st time they would have been 2 stars based just on that fact alone. Not sure if I will stop back in here or not.  On a good day they are the best in the area.

I was told about Rollin' Smoke Barbeque about a week ago and I have been wanting to try it since.  I can check that off the list now.  I went with a co-worker, the very same man who told me about it in the first place.  Immediately upon my exit of the car in the tiny parking lot I noticed the smell of BBQ smoke.  It was only enhanced as I entered the establishment.  Aside from the delicious smell of BBQ, which has permeated every fiber of my clothing and still lingers, I was greeted by a huge version of their menu posted to the wall.  I opted for the smaller hand held version though.  It was easier to read.  After looking at said menu for a few minutes I decided on the brisket dog.  I also ordered a side of corn nuggets based on reccomendations from my dining acquaitance of the day.  The hot dog was immense to the point where I gave up eating it with my hands and went with the fork and knife method.  It was a heavy gauge dog with a fantastic red color and the nice snap of a natural casing.  But it was difficult to actually see that beneath the truck load of fried onions, chopped brisket and nacho cheese.  What a gut buster this behemoth is.  Then there are the corn nuggets.  Little bite sized fried pieces of corny goodness.  It is best described as fried creamed corn.  It is crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside with the sweetness I have grown to love.  Frying it just adds to the alure.  After eating the dog and these corn nuggets along with drinking a cup of lemonade, I am stuffed.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,4,2,4,K_jK7qzaCbVGumGzwOL7xA
4148277,2013-11-09,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Being from North Carolina, my BBQ standards are pretty high (that goes for the fixins that come with it as well). I'm in the military, so I moved out here from NC almost 3 years ago, and in that amount of time I've never found any place that was up to par with what I considered good BBQ. Memphis isn't very good. Famous Dave's is okay. Lucille's is pretty decent, but for the drive to Henderson (and fairly high price), it's just not worth a regular trip. Then I got tip from a new friend (who was also a fellow North Carolinian) about a place that was a little off the beaten path but well worth it... Rollin Smoke Barbecue. So we decided to give it a try. That leads me to this moment, as I sit here with a full belly typing this review. My wife and I both had the pulled pork sandwich. Her sides were Mac & cheese and potato salad, mine were Mac & cheese and hush puppies. All of which were delicious. The meat was tender, the bbq sauce was delicious and had just a little bit of spice to it. All the sides were awesome. And we washed it all down with the only kind of tea that should exist... SWEET. Then to get our sweet tooth fix we shared some banana pudding that was amazing. Even as I stuffed my face I was studying the menu so I could plan my next visit. Rollin Smoke is the real deal. Great barbecue and extremely friendly staff.

Luckily, the cashier Danny was very helpful and very kind and helped make our decision very easy.  We were planning on just getting three separate meals but he offered different options of combo plates that we could share!  We settled on the $50 combo which allowed us to try the best of ALL worlds.  It comes with 12 rolls, 2 sides, and 5 different kinds of meats.  I think the best part of the combo is getting to try their different meats because each one is cooked so well and worth trying.  We got the mac n cheese (Danny also helped us choose sides based on what we were in the mood for) and CREAMED CORN NUGGETS MAKE SURE TO GET THESE !!!

They only have one BBQ sauce, gracias a dios, it was really good. I just like a variety of tastes in my mouth... take it as you will. My personal favorites were the sausage and pulled pork. The initial kick of the brisket was good (we got burnt tipped) but I was over it after awhile. 

There sides are what really blew my mind. They were all really good, coleslaw, beans, mac n cheese, everything!! They were so good, i recommend all of them. We dropped about 40 dollars which was enough to feed four grown men... or three grown men and me, which is the equivalent of a 13 year old boy. So 3 and a half people. 

This is also on the outskirts of the city BUT it is totally worth the trip if you are in the mood for BBQ.

Rollin' Smoke offers what I consider the most authentic BBQ in Las Vegas by a long shot. There aren't any competitors even worth mentioning to compare.
1) Atmosphere: it's a rather small property that's divided into a few section, one where you place your orders/grab your drinks, utensils etc/some seating available, and two other sections offering seating as well. Regardless of how you're eating (take-out, dining in, a la carte, all-you-can-eat), there is one line for all. You can sit wherever you'd like while you wait for your food to be delivered including outdoors. 
2) Service: Everyone on staff is super friendly and very helpful. It was our first time there and we didn't feel rushed while we took a minute in line getting an explanation of how the menu works. Food was delivered timely and correctly. 
3) Food: I'll start with saying my ribs literally fell off the bone when I picked up my first bite. Now...
All-you-can-eat is $24.95 and includes anything on the menu. Pace yourself! You can always come back for more. We grabbed a bit of each meat and were very pleased with every type- ribs, brisket, chicken, catfish (very fresh, lightly crunchy and not fishy-tasting). Everything was exceptional, including our sides of Mac and cheese, cole slaw and hush puppies. Oh the hush puppies! So yummy! Dessert was awesome. Next time we'll have to try our berry cobbler a la mode.

4278350,2016-02-08,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"At a mere mile away from our hotel, Rollin' Smoke made perfect sense. It also had the highest ratings of any Vegas barbecue joint I researched, which was just icing on the cake. 

In true Las Vegas fashion, Rollin' Smoke offers an all-you-can-eat meal option which encompasses their entire menu! Tempted as I was, my stomach didn't feel quite up to the challenge (partially due to the prior night's ""festivities""). I set my sights a little lower and ordered their Pit Special: brisket, pulled pork, burnt ends (instead of the advertised quarter-chicken), spare ribs, and hot links with bacon potato salad, cheesy mac n cheese, and kick'n bbq beans on the side.

The potato salad was, in a word, magnificent. Bacon and green onions give this side a great crunchy texture that brilliantly compliments the creamy mayo base. The beans were nice and sweet, with a great spicy kick on the black end. They certainly weren't lacking for black pepper, that's for sure. Large-size pasta noodles allowed the gooey cheese to get embedded in each nook and cranny of the macaroni. The extra layer of cheddar on top was just what it needed, too, adding another degree of cheesiness.

Rollin' Smoke's brisket comes chopped unless otherwise requested. Chopped or not, there was a ton of bark to go around. I also found a great smoke level in each bite of the incredibly tender brisket. There was just a hint of sauce drizzled on top, which allowed me to taste both it and the delicious meat at the same time.

The rosy smoke-kissed pulled pork looked exceptionally inviting. Upon closer inspection, it came with a smokiness that mirrored its appearance. The meat was also really juicy, with very flavorful chunks of bark throughout. As a Texan it pains me to say this, but I think that I enjoyed their pork more than the brisket.

The hotlinks were damn good. They had a great snap to the casing, with a char that added to the crispness as well. The heat of these links catches you a little off guard. It also masks any potential smokiness, but that's to be expected.

Burnt ends aren't something that I get to enjoy all too often, so I was happy to find them on Rollin' Smoke's menu today. These were worth every bit of the $3.00 upcharge, and then some. Melt-in-your-mouth tender doesn't quite do them justice as a descriptor, but it's the best that I can muster. There was a great smoky flavor, coupled with a somewhat spicy glaze.

The ribs were cooked perfectly, with only a slight tug needed on each bite. Rollin' Smoke managed to produce tender and juicy ribs without cooking them into ""falling off the bone"" oblivion. The crust had a great blend of spices that combined both heat and sweet. Each bite of rib meat also contained a good smoke level that kept bringing me back for more.

In a town known for celebrity chefs and Michelin-star restaurants, Rollin' Smoke offers a blue-collar alternative so indulgent that you'll forget all about the glitz and glamour of the Strip.",KnLyt9JZw8QUr7QAEkguow,7,5,5,nrHBSZ_GgZ4F6f_9tcDgvA

Typically going to Vegas it's the same restaurants or small food/snack shops that keeps the stomach satisfied, but on the last trip a couple friends decided to come here for a birthday dinner. Upon reaching the premises my nose was hit with the mouth watering smell of bbq.
Our party of 18 or so people were given a spot at an empty room and were greeted with great enthusiasm and hospitality. My gf and I were probably the 4th to put in the order of the Outlaw burger and the Rib Plater special. After waiting in the room slowly everyone started to get their food and were enjoying the dinner while we waited. After coming in to check on us (forgot the gentlemen's name) he explained the food was forgotten or being remade, which I can't remember, but long story short they got us the food and also gave us a free A LA MODE Black berry cobbler.

Rating of the burger and ribs

-Jaw dropping sized burger filled with such tasty bbq flavor that's complimented with the onion strings (DROOOL)
-Very flavorful sauce (More on the tangy side) on the ribs and the meat slides right off
-The cobbler is something that needs to be ordered either by you or someone in your party. I was so full after the burger and a few ribs but was able to have a bite off the cobbler and it was amazing.

""Han take me back""  but once they have the food they go, ""omg... Han pleaseeee take me back here""

Service: Service here is great.  They try their best to get the customers orders as fast as they can despite being busy during the peak hours of the day.  Another big plus about this place is that the chef will come out when he has time to ask his customers how the food is and a brief history of the restaurant.  Nothing like the person who makes the food to really care about what the customers think, bravo!

Food:  You really can't find anything bad to choose from but i'd avoid the brisket (a bit dry when i had it last time i was here)  Their famous outlaw burger is literally the size of your head.... like a mondo burger (good burger reference).  So juicy and literally will leave you so full, you won't be able to eat till tomorrow.

BBQ: BEEF RIBS!!! that is all.  Literally picked it up and the whole piece fell off.  St louis ribs are also very delicious and juicy.  Meat is so succulent and the juices that exude out of the meat is parallel to wringing a wet sponge.  I might just pass out from describing how good the ribs are.

Overall. Just go here!",lXZ7aziyUJyA6V0FlIR1Wg,4,2,5,zKmGBt7MNWwQqg6jM0XWNQ

4348212,2014-02-08,7,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Saturday night in Vegas and we were planning on meeting up with our friends for dinner and some fun. The first place we planned to go to was not getting too many rave reviews.
Stephanie S. had the wonderful idea to come here instead for dinner. This place was pretty close to where we were staying on the strip, which made it easy drive for us. Located on the other side of the strip (yes on the seedy side of town) pass a couple of popular strip joints, made a turn thinking did my GPS give me the wrong directions because it's really dark on this street and it looks like it's the industrial area of Vegas. Well you are in the industrial area but it is also a mix of other business as well. Rollin Smoke is in a small shopping center look for a sign that says ""Kiesub Center"" and you have found it! Did I mention that they are open until 1:30 am every day too?

As we were pulling into the parking lot, I notice two huge bbq smokers outside. Knowing that anything that is put into a smoker is going to be mighty tasty I was ready to order right there in the parking lot!

Walking into this eatery the BBQ smell hits you like a mack truck on the 15. Their menu is large and in charge! 

Everything from an all you can eat BBQ for $24.99 (you get anything on their menu, anytime, any day of the week)

$7.99 sandwich's (like the pulled piggy, smoked brisket ECT)
$8.99 meals (BBQ nacho fries, various wraps, outlaw burger and many options that are more wonderful to choose from)

Then there are the various plates that they have. Minh and I decided on ordering and splitting The Pit Special: 

Four meats (of your choice) and three sides (of your choice) - Brisket, Chicken, two orders of spare ribs. Bacon Potato Salad, Yams, and Corn Nuggets all for $19.99!

They took Minh's name down and we seated our self's in an over sized booth. The owner was there making sure everything was running smoothly. This is a family owned business, which makes it have that charming-family-cozy kind of feeling.
As we were waiting for our food and other friends to arrive, I was chatting with Stephanie and watching the small eatery fill up with hungry families, club-goers and other various walks of life wanting some stick to your ribs goodness. 

A friendly server brought our food to our table. All I can say is the Pit Special offers a lot of food for your money! There is more than enough to share with another person. 

The corn nuggets were the best ever! Fried on the outside (no grease on any of the balls) and yet soft and fluffy in middle. I was popping these in two at a time (sorry babe if you only got a couple). There are addicting! 

The bacon potato salad was another favorite, chucks of potatoes various seasonings, mayo and probably mustard piled with bits of delicious bacon.  Swoon!

All the meats were tender (they ""rub"" their own meats daily) you can taste the quality of the meats they have. Not one piece was dry; we did try their homemade BBQ sauce, which was delightful on the brisket. The chicken and ribs had so much meat on it I got overwhelmed for a second. 

This place is a gem in hiding, BBQ in sin city at its best! To the Holland family thank you for making this delicious food for every kind of budget!",coKnuxLznH0FHb34m4ZLCw,13,10,5,b206Qy4TyZInSgLPG7P7hg

I got the Spudtastic with brisket and a side of Bacon Potato Salad.  Everything was fresh and tasted amazing! This will definitely become a lunch/dinner regular for me.  The line never went down while we were there.

Picnic style seating.  We sat at a table with some other people while waiting for their food and everybody was so nice.  Staff and regulars.

So when we had to choose a place for an in office lunch there was zero disagreement that we had to order from Rollin Smoke. The location is a bit of a hike from my home in Henderson, but not too far from work (lucky me!). 

We've now ordered twice since it was such a hit the first time. We ordered the Super Sampler which was definitely the right amount of meat for 8-10 people. It looks like a lot of food, but nobody will be able to resist seconds. Six pints of sides will not go far if choosing six different sides. I would suggest choosing three different items instead of six to make sure there is enough to go around.

The MEAT. You come here for the meat because it is the best BBQ meat you'll have the pleasure of putting in your mouth. All of the meats are obviously smoked and they do it to perfection. The flavor is really sealed into the meats. The ribs fall off the bone, chicken and pork are tender, and the sausage packs a nice heat.

I have enjoyed almost all of the sides as well. My favorites have been the Collard Greens (with brisket of course), Macaroni and Cheese, and Baked Beans. The only side that wasn't awesome was the Loaded Mash. Maybe my taste buds were off this day, but it tasted instant.

Seriously, if you're visiting Vegas or live there, just try it, you'll love it.  They are located in an almost industrial center part of town, and there's not a whole lot of parking, especially when they are busy.  They are right down the street from our go to Tattoo shop, so they are really convenient for us to grab a to go order when someone's tattoo is going to take all day.  They also have two dining areas and seating outside too if you'd rather eat in. 

The portions are huge; my boyfriend and I can share one of their two or three meat platters easily.  On this most recent visit we ordered two of the three meat platters.  One for us to share, and one for the two teenage boys to share.  For under $40, all four of us were completely stuffed and we still had leftovers.   For our platter we had ribs, pork and brisket with the bacon potato salad and banana pudding.  The ribs were falling off the bone, the pork was flavorful and juicy and the brisket was really tender.  I grabbed a few extra containers of their sauce, but we didn't need it because the meats were great on their own.  The service is excellent even when they are busy.

Take your local county fair, where the only thing in common between the display photos and the food is how plastic, dry and devoid of flavor the food is. 

This place is a lot closer to the former, because everything was excellent (we didn't order sides, though). All the meats had a prominent smoky flavor and was thoroughly moist, though I'd definitely give special attention to the burnt ends and the ribs. We also had the sliced brisket which we preferred over the chopped up version. It was leaner so definitely not as moist as the aforementioned two options but definitely still tender. Portions are huge - we ordered four pounds of meat for four people - which we discovered was slightly excessive.

There's literally four (or five? or six?) different sauce options so you can go wild. Of note, though, the spicy is the best. Drinks are refillable and the drink cups are non-disposable souvenir options that you can take home and bring back to get a discount on fountain drinks.

If there is one food I'm most passionate about, it's BBQ!
Yelpers gave this the nod and pointed me in the right direction...
We split the 5 meat platter to get a well rounded lay of the land.
Chicken was perfectly moist and flavorful, piled pork was tender and soaked up the sauce readily. Hot link left a bit to be desired as it was tough and loaded with black pepper which overshadowed any smoke. Ribs lacked a depth of smoke I look for in top shelf specimens, but were very tender! Least impressive was the brisket which is disappointing as it was a bit greasy and the extreme chopping left the consistency a bit to be desired.
The sides were fan with the best mac & cheese I've had from a restaurant. Creamy cheesy and hints of other flavors(garlicky ranch?!?) that kicked me right in the tongue. Beans are loaded with meat and a perfect spicy sweet that finished the 1-2 tongue punch combo.
Ambiance is strip mall picnic, service is ""self"", and prices are in line with expectation.
Don't get me wrong this food was solid 3 stars, I was just hoping for more out of the  food from a place with smoke in the name.

The menu is huge, so it might be worth checking it out ahead of time. I ordered the Outlaw Burger with waffle fries, and my husband got the Duo plate with chicken & brisket. We, also, got a side of corn nuggets & a peach cobbler. With 2 drinks, everything came to $25.

You order at the counter, and seat yourself. Drinks & silverware are self serve. And, when your order is ready, they bring it to your table. While we were waiting, I observed a few people who were obvious regulars. Another good sign.

Every single item we ordered was excellent. The chicken was super moist and flavorful. The brisket had those delicious crispy pieces on the edges. Waffle fries were crispy and well seasoned. The peach cobbler was warm and gooey!! But, the rock star of our meal was definitely the Outlaw Burger. It. Was. Huge. Like 10"" high huge!

When we were wrapping up our leftovers, they didn't have a lid for our cobbler...so they gave us a whole 2nd one to go. It was a little thing, but their service really impressed me.

We also got the smoked meatloaf and pulled piggy sandwich. The piggy sandwich was very tender and moist but the star of the meals really was the meatloaf. I don't like meatloaf but I liked this one. It isn't your traditional meatloaf, it is smoked and BBQ. So very good. The portions are huge as well!

There was an additional room with seating off to the side, but I did not peek in. 

Service:  the staff was extremely helpful and friendly. Chef Will was awesome! He noticed I was staring at the menu for a very long time, so he asked if it was my first time here.

Food: I really wish I could give the food a higher rating, but it was just not as good as I hoped. The corn nuggets were delicious!  The pulled pork and beef ribs were pretty good too. But the jalapeño cole slaw tasted more like black pepper cole slaw. The bacon potato salad was good, but too many onions for me.

They have a 10% off coupon on their website, just show them the coupon online and save some money.

Rib Platter - $24.99 - Comes with 1 beef rib, 2 spare ribs, and 3 baby back ribs. I love when bbq places have combos like this because I love to try everything they offer. Beef rib was huge and had tender flakey meat. Spare rib fell off the bone and was moist. Baby backs were a little dry. Seasoning was peppery with a little hint of sweet. My side was the Corn Nuggets which were like cream corn poppers, so good.

Brisket, fatty, 1lb - $18.99 - Meat melted in your mouth. You can pull it apart with your fingers. 

Half Smoked Chicken - $9.99 - Good smoke. Had some good juicy meat but some pieces were dry.

Burnt Ends, 1/2lb - $12.99 -  Disappointing. Not moist or fatty. Very little bark. They do not allow quarter pound orders either.",d8KR5c1ievS0C53h4fhEeQ,1,1,4,1sGDV5d07JqPtG6WGNaNIA

4 Stars *****

This place is located in a less than desirable area. It is on Highland Dr near the strip club district. Nonetheless, it was definitely worth the trip.

I am giving my 300th review to Rollin' Smoke BBQ. Definitely a solid 4 star meal when it comes to BBQ beef brisket. I just tried the Brisket 3 Ways which consisted of sliced brisket, chopped brisket, and burnt ends. The meat was very good on its own, but I added some of their Arkansas BBQ sauce to it. I thought their bbq sauce was excellent. They also offered a sweet bbq sauce, but I preferred the tangy version. I also ordered a side of waffle cut fries, which were seasoned very well.

I will definitely be back to try the beef ribs and some other menu items. I will probably add another star on my next visit if the beef ribs are as good as the brisket.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,15,14,4,xK_9kUQcPTBO0b_vPTmRWw
4584911,2017-02-21,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I'd say if you need a BBQ fix, this is probably your best option because not only is it affordable but it is also very close to the strip. 

It's hard to come up with a comparison to this spot because it was my first time having Arkansas style BBQ. Now, if I compare it to BBQ i've had in Austin, TX (which isn't quite fair to be honest) the meat wasn't as tender and as flavorful as I had hoped. Although for being in Nevada or anywhere in the west coast region, they do a pretty good job. It'll definitely fix the BBQ craving!

Upon our arrival, LV was having a downpour so there was not many people in line to order. It was my first time here so I ended up deciding on ""The Pit Special"" that comes with 5 different meats and 3 small sides. I'm huge on beef ribs and ""The Pit Special"" unfortunately didn't come with one so I switched one of my meat choices for it (extra charge of $6). If you're like me who can't stop at a BBQ joint without ordering a beef rib, I'd say it's better if you just add a beef rib to your platter instead of substituting so that way you get to try everything. Our cashier, Sofia, wasn't the happiest of campers to be honest when it came to us ordering. Obviously as a customer, you're going to ask questions about what to order and you kind of except some sort of recommendation but this lady wasn't in the most pleasant of moods. She asked me if I would like my brisket either chopped or sliced. I asked her what the difference was and she said ""Well, one is chopped and the other is sliced."" I was definitely taken back by her response but I was hoping she would be able to say, one had a thicker cut or if one sort of cut of meat had more fat than the other. Anyway, this lady had zero patience and I was just ready to pay and step away because i didn't want my meal ruined due to one sour apple.


The food was brought out by a young boy who prior to that was making his rotations around the tables cleaning and wiping them down for the next customers. He was very attentive and I think most of the people waiting for their orders noticed his efficiency and great attitude. 

I immediately started with the cheesy mac and cheese and I think that is definitely the way to go! One bite of the mac and cheese and another into the chopped brisket!! The House Arkansauce was great on EVERYTHING!!!! I had it on the beef rib, the chicken, and the brisket!!  As far as the rest of the sides, the bacon potato salad was delicious but I'd say the yams were a little too sweet for my liking. 

The meat was definitely delicious but I did notice some parts being a tiny bit dry. Maybe it was just my beef rib, but the rib had parts where it was extra tender and other parts where it was a little tough.

I ordered a platter with ribs and pulled pork. It came with toast and a choice of side. I was hard pressed to find a side that wasn't spicy - jalapeño coleslaw and kickin' beans?!

The ribs didn't have much of a smoke ring, but the smoke wasn't lacking and the rub was good. The sauce is spicy, but a perfect amount. The most impressive thing was when I asked for butter, they served me a container of warm melty butter, YUM!

My husband got brisket, which was kind of dry, but the seasoning was great, and it was perfectly salted. The loaded mashed potatoes were awesome, as if they mashed it using some of the bacon grease from the topping - so yummy.

Even my kid's food was good. The hot dog was a fat juicy meaty delicious thing, and he got hush puppies or corn nugget things that I couldn't stop stealing. The only thing he didn't like was that the cheese he ordered was spicy nacho cheese. No surprise.

Been here on multiple occasions and their food is consistently delicious.

Its one of those places that always makes you leave satisfied and feigning for a nap. The staff are warm and welcoming, and the decor is barbecue-y (a lot of Arkansas Razorbacks stuff). 

A definite highlight of this place is their sauces. Their sauces have a ton of depth in flavor, and for the spicy lovers, their hot bbq sauce has a kick to it as well. 

Prices are decent as I would definitely not consider this cheap eats, but this place is definitely worth the money. Visitors of Vegas should definitely try to visit this place. Oh yes, if you're going to strip clubs at night, pick one that is near this place because they open LATE. 

Only downsides of this place is the location of the place (industrial, empty during the daytime, and I haven't been at night) and that parking is hard to come by because their lot is small.

But there are smaller tables, and even a second room (it's where the BBQ Grill fish tank is) if you want a little less of a crowd. 

But it's all about the food and Rollin Smoke delivers with excellent Brisket, chicken, and ribs that will make you think you're not in Vegas but in KC or Memphis. I could run long here but let's just say I spent 30 years in KC. I love BBQ. When I crave BBQ this is where I go, period.

We were too late for our 15 seconds of fame, but the film crew was still there and it was neat watching them work. It was also not as crowded as I had expected, so it was quick to order and many tables available. The food took a bit longer to come out, but I believe that's standard.

I ordered the ""Duo Choice of Two Meats"" Smokin Plate with Hot Link and 2 Spare Ribs (other meat choices are brisket, pork, or 1/4 chicken), Waffle Fries (there are 16 choices of Smokin Sides), and a drink for $10.99. The sausage or hot link was really tasty and they're not messing around with the heat! If you can't handle spicy food, watch out. I enjoyed the ribs as well, especially with their BBQ sauce. I definitely could've eaten more! I liked their offerings of sweetened and unsweetened iced tea as I mixed the two and had a nice balance.

We tried a couple cobblers, banana pudding, and the special Reese's PB bread pudding. The cobblers were all right and the banana pudding was decent. The bread pudding was off the hook though! Really good!

I think one of the best parts of their menu is the AYCE option for $24.99. It's offered all day, every day and has no restrictions (except no sharing or to-go, obviously).

This place fires on every cylinder!  From the main meats down to the sides.  I mean, I wish I could in some sense describe my experience here so that it even comes close to the actual event.... 

I ordered a rib basket, and for $14.99 I got a beef rib, pork ribs, and a half rack baby back rib.  Now that may not sound like much, but the ribs are HUGE.  The beef rib was the largest I've ever seen.  The meat was tender, juicy, and just shaved off the bone with my plastic fork.  The pork ribs were good, more dense as it should be but still juicy, flavorful meat.  And I can tell you I've never had a baby back rib that even came close to this baby back rib.  

Onto the sides.  I've never had a jalapeno slaw that came close to this one, a fantastic blend of spice and sweet, not soppy wet and not dry either.  Mash potatoes with melted cheddar and chives!  Holy crap.  The potato salad was fantastic.  Now I have one rule about BBQ is that I ALWAYS have room for the banana pudding.  I'm sorry to say I broke my rule, so I am not going to be able to inform on the banana pudding.

The meat is prepared immediately after you order on their grills which are on-site.  You will get exactly what you ordered prepared EXACTLY how you want it!  The staff is very quick and responsive to your needs and the menu has extraordinary options in terms of BBQ preparation.

You can get an amazing assortment of meats from brisket, ribs, chicken, pulled pork, hot links, and yummy sides like beans, mac & cheese, and cole slaw.

Plus there's an 'All-You-Can-Eat' option for $25.00...wow...if your stomach can handle it., I highly recommend taking it on!  ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING on the menu for only $25 bucks!

I recently decided to take it on by getting the brisket, the baby back ribs, the chicken, and hot links, along with sides of baked beans and mac & cheese...I think I really did see God at one point!

This is not just some BBQ Joint where they'll throw any random meat in a bag onto a grill...this is BBQ made from the heart and the soul delivered fresh and hot to your mouth.

There is no more to say other than, if you truly want a taste of BBQ from the Gods...Rollin Smoke is the place to go!",m8d1HYOCF8WCfO3AuwiJSw,4,1,5,ltCqNKcZfwKJ512aOYPlQg

They serve BBQ of all types. We ordered the combo BBQ to sample their BBQ and also a pulled pork sandwich. It was a large burger. Underneath all that meat was a sausage. Everything was cooked just right. The meat was juicy and came right off the bone.

The place was packed for 2pm on a Saturday, clearly pass its lunch hour but there was a steady stream of customers. If you want hole in the wall, this is the place. Everything about the place tells you these people didn't come from LA or NYC. They came from what, Arkansas? There's a boar's head on the wall to greet you and keep you company when you wait in line.

The menu items are simple. We got mac and cheese, yams, and fried okra. You get a side if you order a soft drink. How can you eat BBQ without a Coke? You just can't, so the side was an added compliment.

There is only 1 restroom though so I suggest you do your business become you come or else it might be a wait. Out of the 3 different styles of BBQ, I'd say they hit it on the head for each one. There is bbq sauce on the table if you like but I found that the ribs were nicely done and I didn't need anymore sauce.

Sauce wise, I think Lucille's might just be a tad better but not by much. I like them to cook their meat as good as this place. Is it always pefect? Nope. The first time that I came here, the baby backs were a little dry but this time everything was cooked right.

I could not finish my meal and took the rest home. If you have trouble locating this place it's across Shetakis distribution and below the Sahara bridge I believe.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,1,1,5,Rh6xJtGaV3epxQlR7wi2hw

I've eaten at Rollin' Smoke BBQ twice now, and left both times feeling as though I'd eaten some of the best BBQ of my life. I'm a true lover of good BBQ and have even taken pilgrimages to places like Memphis, TN and Lockhart, TX in search of the country's best. I feel I have a good frame of reference for evaluating what good BBQ tastes like, and, let me assure you, Rollin' Smoke is damned good BBQ!

Everything I've tried on the menu has been excellent, but the dishes I dream about are the smoked meatloaf--which I have to say may be the single best meatloaf dish I've ever eaten--and the burnt ends, waffle fries and corn fritters. The ribs, chicken and everything else is excellent, but the above dishes were my favorites.

Las Vegas is frankly very lucky to have BBQ of this caliber, as very few cities in America do. The manager is super friendly, and the whole staff is very friendly and accommodating. They also give a discount to locals, showing that they appreciate those of us who live here and support these businesses on a regular basis.

I know I'm going to leave with a smile on my face every time I eat here, and I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Unlike many on Yelp, I don't give out five-star ratings easily, but Rollin' Smoke has earned it! Please support this great Las Vegas restaurant! My only complaint is that they close at 8pm Mon-Fri, but the most important thing is that their food is truly outstanding!",c-YbKFuw-vhEOBLad_NMBA,4,2,5,1uRBr6Ln3eg6oJWec1kN_g

No seriously, everything was awesome. We got a lot of food, not JUST because we were starving, but because we wanted a large variety of food so that we could give them a fair chance to impress us. Well, job done! I have to say, we were impressed!

With the help of the perky and oh so passionate cashier, we ordered the Pit Special 5 Meat 3 Sides for 27.99.

We enjoyed The whole meal and we ate every bit of it. The best part to me was the Hot Links and maybe the Mac & Cheese, if you force me to pick. To be honest, when we go back, the only change that we would make is, instead of the Peach Cobbler, we would order Mama's Banana Pudding.

I do want to mention that the Peach Cobbler was really oily. It was probably because of the cream that was on top, but either way, we've both had better. I wouldn't order it again.

My second visit was crappy. I ordered take out late at night. My fiance was craving sweet tea so I made sure to order that first. No problem the lady said. The sweet tea actually comes with the meals that we placed free of charge. I go to pick up my food and she hands me two cups. I go to pour myself the sweet tea to go but it's empty. I go up to the counter to let the employee know. She apologizes and tells me that she'll get a new one out. I'm waiting for a good 10 minutes, maybe not realizing that it's been 10 minutes because I was on my phone. A male employee walks out from the back and starts cleaning up. I politely ask him if he knows that status of my sweet tea and I inform him that the previous employee said that she would have it brought out. Well apparently, she is now off her shift and he knows nothing about it. He tells me that unfortunately, they're out of sugar and so there's no sweet tea at all until they get a shipment. 

Ummm. Seriously? I realize that I'm the last customer there but they were a good hour away from their posted closing time. He apologizes for the inconvenience when in reality, he should have apologized for making up a piss poor lie and telling it to my face.

Brisket (upgraded to burnt ends), ribs, and coleslaw with a drink and a piece of bread for $22 felt steep for the amount of food we got, yet by the end I was thoroughly stuffed and for that reason, I actually feel like this is a good deal. I believe the quality of the meat and technique were excellent, which deserves a higher price point. Did I mention that it was delicious? It was delicious. The brisket was crispy on the outside with the soft, delicate, juicy interior that I have come to love. The ribs fell right off the bone. They had authentic Carolina vinegar which cut through the fatty brisket. Their mustard base sauce had excellent tang and was good, but I bet it would go better on smoked chicken.

Plus they only have one size drink--I really didn't want to have to buy a big drink for my child to drink two sips of something.

The burger was amazing and I had only ordered a 1/2 pound of pulled pork and received well over a pound (I assume it was for the wait)  I ordered for two people and my name was the same as another patron so I'm assuming there was some confusion there.

Its a true  BBQ joint. Plastic forks and knives, Styrofoam and paper plates.

The smell of smoke was pretty amazing. I was floating in like this place was the pied piper.

The menu is pretty simple like it should be. 

The owner was taking the food order. Its kind of different. You pay first and wait for a runner to bring out your food. The owners are very nice people and really care about their food.

I ordered The Biggin, its a sandwich with pork, brisket, and hot links and it was friggin delicious. There's no easy way to eat this monster. You have to dig in and understand things are gonna get messy.

One boy ordered the catfish po boy. Yes its not BBQ but he loved it and they did make it perfect.

Another ordered the Brisket Dog. I didn't know it was on a sesame seed bun which he was allergic to. They made it over at no charge and put it on a hamburger bun. The sandwich was as big as his head! I was entertained just watching him trying to eat this behemoth! Its a good thing they have rolls of paper towels on the tables because this kid needed a whole roll. He loved it too.

We had the pulled piggy sandwich plate and the brisket three ways. We had the mac n cheese and the corn nuggets for our sides. The food was FANTASTIC.
-Pulled piggy sandwich was perfectly smoky and had comparably less fat to other establishments I've been to that have served pulled pork sandwiches.
-Chopped brisket: juicy due to being a bit fattier than my preference, but served like it's supposed to
-Burnt ends: my personal favorite
Sliced brisket: perfectly tender and ready to pull apart
-Corn nuggets: YES PLEASE. I'd eat these all day long if calories didn't count.

Two things I would change about Rollin Smoke if I could: the location (super small parking lot) and the seating arrangements. Unfortunately we came on a really cold day and the seating area is rather sparse. This resulted in the doors opening and closing a lot, so our food got cold pretty quickly.

That's right....You ever walk into a BBQ joint and want to try everything on the menu?  Well here you can.  I wish I would have noticed that before I ordered.  Just the $28 rack of baby backs would have made it worth my while to do the all you can eat.  Smoked Meatloaf sounds awesome, and the burgers looked great too.  You can bet I will be back to try them on my next Vegas trip.  

Truth be told, I should most likely give this place 4 stars, just based on what I ate.  The pulled pork was kind of a let down for me.  Not much sauce mixed in with it, I found it kind of flavorless, and not smokey at all.  However the sauce on the table added a much needed zing and saved it - 3 stars.  The brisket was better and had a nice smoke ring to it as well as a dry rub.  It was sliced in thick slices how I prefer it - 4 stars  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#0Lk8zyIUqCEMxyYmpGMTyg

The baby back ribs were the best of the three meats that I tried.  They had a nice bark to it, but still fell off the bone.  There were plenty of meat on these ribs and it was clear they were slowly smoked and had a great hickory flavor to them.  Ribs are always the main test of BBQ for me and these baby backs clearly passed the test and are darn good - 4.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#fSy8vbKrCQuI8Sgv8I5qmA

For the sides we tried the bacon potato salad, the kicken beans, the mac 'n cheese, and some sliced pickles.  The pickles were very good and had a nice vinegary flavor to them.  It's clear they will stand out well on any of their sandwiches.  Tasted exactly like the large dill pickles you get at Disney, in case you need that for a reference.  The kicken' beans, lived up to their name and had some spice to them along with a good peppery flavor.  There were some shards of brisket added in for some smokey flavor.  I personally prefer sweeter southern baked beans, but for some reason those are hard to get outside of the south.  Bacon potato salad, could have had more bacon in it as I couldn't really find any in there.  I still enjoyed it and it had a texture of a smashed potato salad.  The clear star of the show was the mac 'n cheese.  Some of the best I've had, it's very cheesy and creamy.  I don't see myself ever coming here without getting a bowl of it.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#ph5LXQhF8FkZ-8nd6jVSfw

Although we were plenty stuffed, I noticed a free dessert with check in.  All the desserts sounded great, but we went with the banana pudding.  No matter how full you get, for some reason, you can always manage a little banana pudding.  It just kind of slides down.  Rather than vanilla wafers it was more of a swirl of vanilla crust in the pudding.  It was ok, but I think I would try another dessert next time - 3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#B-ruv_7a2ibeC_2NaLAEWw

I love the vibe of this place, it's clear these are men living their dream.  The toys they have to play with in the parking lot are impressive, all kinds of mobile smokers and dressed up cars and trucks with their logo painted all over it.  It's like the bat cave of BBQ.  Holy Smoke Batman....To the Rollin' Smokemobile Robin!  And just like that they are on the move to provide smokey BBQ goodness wherever hungry folk most need them.  Also make sure you visit their party room and you will find a fun pig shaped fish tank that looks like a BBQ smoker.  Look inside and rather than coral you have all kinds of smoked meats for the fish to swim with.  Hit the button and smoke even comes out of the top of the tank.  Apparently this tank was featured on Animal Planet's show - Tanked. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=dTv25Jp39MplokBxlgRkkg#QMwyRQhoijuHeKKEaQLoeA

We're thinking about ordering ahead of time and going in to pick it up to eat there next time we go.

If you have ever been to Texas, North Carolina, Oklahoma, or even Kansas City you have an idea about what I'm talking about because you can smell all of these places food as soon as you pull your car up. 

First of all, I should have known better when I walked into the restaurant and didn't smell the smoke or the BBQ.  The food taste like they either boiled it first and then cooked it in an oven or kitchen grill top. 

Secondly, you are given small portions for big time prices. Far to expensive for a mediocre food. 
Now if you are from Las Vegas then I can understand why you would like them because you don't know any better.

It is not buffet, don;t worry, they ask want you want to start with and bring you more of anything on the menu.  I started with the brisket, pork ribs and the beef ribs my friend could not stop taking about.  
These are not your normal small, barely any meat back ribs, these are short ribs, and contrary to the name, they are not short or small. These are the ""Dino Ribs"" and full of tender flavor.
Enough of that, the Beef ribs were among the best I had, the brisket was a lean cut, I wish I asked for the moist / fatty , not sure if they have it, but that is what I try to get.  I found this brisket to be pretty good, tender & flavorful, I just prefer mine from ""The Point""
The Spareribs had a great flavor, the right 'bite', you do not want fall off the bone, many may think that, but the best have a bit of bite, but are also tender.  These were so.
The service was great, the guy that took my order was patient, he may be the owner, not sure, but worked with me on my order to make sure I got want I wanted.

I never thought I'd pay $53 for a brisket when I cook Q, but welcome to 2015.

I've been a handful of times (every three or four weeks) and perhaps it's talking Q with the owner, perhaps it's because I'm from Arkansas, he remembers my name. I'm not a big customer, but by golly, that's awesome.

The brisket was just as amazing as the ribs. It was moist and had lots of flavor to it . Their seasoning had some secret spices in it, it was not your typical Texas seasoning. I liked the fact that they only put a tiny bit of sauce on their brisket. They didn't drown their meat with sauce. The meat was flavorful to a point that I decided to scratch the sauce off the meat. The brisket also had a great bark. You know what: it was barky, tasty and smoky.

Sadly, the sides were not on par with the meats. The coleslaw was bland, and the mac n cheese was too runny. It didn't taste fresh to me.

a. Location - WTF, I felt like I was driving to one of those back alley strip joints or toward that Erotic Museum.  However, I must say, driving there from the 15 Freeway was very easy!  Just in a very dingy area is all.

b.  Size - They must have increased size,  as I was expecting a really small place with like three tables and they seemed to have expanded next door with some bench like tables to sit good size parties.  I would say though, that the max they can have in this place is like 9-10 parties of various size.

c.  Menu - Pretty darn awesome if you ask me.  Simple to order and if you like meats you can make your own combo from the duo, trio or the Pit Special with a bunch of different meats. They even have large party size orders on the menu.  The brisket was great, the beef ribs darn good. I always order baby back pork ribs so these beef ribs were the right size and very tasty.  I loved the hot links and I did not care so much for the pulled pork, a bit dry if you ask me.  

d.  Hot Sauce - On the table were two types of sauces, and neither was too hot.  I did use quite a bit on the pulled pork. I generally like a hot sauce. I did not ask them, and I wonder if they have it.

e.  Friendly - The owners and workers here are all very friendly, ask about their food and they want you to enjoy your experience.  That is such a cool added touch!

f.  Ordering, drinking and etc - You order at the front and pay, but they bring the food to you.  The soda fountain and the ice tea area are in a small and tight area, so if it is busy, it will be tough to get to. 

g. Leftovers - They plenty of serve yourself plastics for any leftovers you have.

h.  The sides - Plenty of sides.  The potato salad was awesome. The beans were great, the corn nuggets were totally cool.  These were the only sides we had.

Results - Awesome finger licking food, great pricing and great service.  Loved it better than Famous Dave's and Lucille's. GK says check it out.",owlUazXSDLaxlOV7z8181g,5,2,5,e-GseFuJDKDGhaRytybDnA

The portions we got here would have easily cost over $100 back in Orange County. Brisket, pork, chicken, mashed potatoes, corn nuggets, mac n cheese, dirty/fried rice -everything was just so gosh darn tasty.

But, there is a decent amount of parking close to the restaurant.  There are also plenty of places to sit, including tables outside.  But, since I came during the Las Vegas summer, there was no way I was sitting outside.

I was having trouble deciding between the Outlaw Burger and the 2 meat duo with pork and brisket.  The guy that was helping me suggested the meatloaf, which is made up of both brisket and pork and smoked.  It comes with potatoes on the bottom and BBQ sauce and fried onions on the top with pickle slices and a roll on the side.  I added fried okra, because if a place has fried okra I have to try it.

I was glad I took this guy's suggestion.  The slab is ENORMOUS, it easily fed me for dinner as well, and I'm a big eater.  The smoke in the meatloaf was incredible, very impressive.  I could have used more fried onions, but what dish couldn't?  I'll order more next time I eat here.  When you had a bite with the sauce and the onions, it was the perfect blend of crunch, meat and a bit of spice.

The okra was very good, but not the best I've had.  Service was fantastic, it took a bit to get my food, but they are super popular and making your food when you order.

We ordered all the meats dry and with sauce on the side and also asked for their spicy bbq sauce.  The test for good bbq is how their meat tastes without sauce.  This place definitely passed the test  I'm not usually a fan of bbq sauce anyway, but this place definitely does not need sauce.  The rub they use on their meats were delicious.  The beef rib was so nice and fatty and it basically melts in your mouth.  The flavor of the spare ribs were good too.  However, the meat on spare ribs should easily fall of the bone, and these did not.  

The sides were ok.  I liked the bacon potato salad.  I wasn't a fan of the other stuff. Although my friends really liked the corn ball things. 

Definitely worth a shot, but it can be busy.  Some of the other reviews said it was hard to get a seat.  I can definitely see that happening on the weekends during peak hours.  We went on a monday at 6pm.  There was a line for the food, but we didn't have any problem finding a table.

4990660,2017-11-28,5,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"First time in my life, I've been craving BBQ almost on a daily basis. I credit (or blame) Rollin Smoke for that. I come to LV several times a year, and almost always end up eating on/near the Strip. But this time, I took a drive out here, under a freeway overpass, next to a strip club, in a less than glitzy part of Vegas. But so what, it's all worth it.

Upon entering, you'll see the seating is communal, resembling picnic tables & benches. Once you decide what you want, place your order at the counter. Grab a table and in a mere minutes, someone calls out your name. You better answer, because he's holding your food. 

I would've gotten the 5 Meat Pit Special, but the wife isn't exactly a carnivore. So I ended up with the Trio Basket; 3 meats and one side. Chose ribs (of course) brisket & pulled pork. 

Ribs: F-ing awesome (and I rarely swear about food) Smoky, salty, tender and a bit fatty. I'm craving hard as I'm typing. 

Brisket: Covered in a crust of coarse pepper, it is so tender with small chunks of fat to give it that greasy coating. 

Pulled pork; Super tender but bland as hell by itself. Grab some sauce to give it life. Would not order again

Corn bread; sweet, sticky and moist. Perfect ending to the a meal of meats. 

Extra order of Corn nuggets; Because the fatty meats aren't heavy enough, these fried corn nugz are great, and have a slightly sweet finish. 

Napkins are on the table, and about 4 choices of various sauces are at the counter w/ small paper sauce cups. I'd say try all 4. They range from sweet to heat. Depends on what you get, it may add a new level of flavor, like the underwhelming pulled pork. 

There are separate rooms. First is the main room, where the entrance, the ordering counter, and fountain drinks are. Over to the left, is another room with big screens airing sports. A third room is a bit larger, detached from the first 2 and seems quieter, but I never made it in there. 

The food, came out fast and was excellent. The service, not bad. The girl who took our order really didn't want to be there. She was lethargic, and couldn't describe any of the flavors of the food to a first-timer. And all I asked was ""how is the pulled pork?' She answered, ""it's pulled pork."" ...

I only ordered a brisket sandwich,  so I don't know why that would take 20 min. But it did.  What was very disappointing is the sandwich was cold when I finally got it.

Given Rolling Smokes reputation I thought I'd try the Summerlin location since it wouldn't be as busy.

Yelp led me to Rollin Smoke. 

This place is the definition of a hole in the wall (which made the contrast with the Bacchanal Buffet all the more pronounced). There's a strip club two doors down. Do not judge the book by its cover.

I ordered at the counter and got the 3-meat combo (brisket, pulled pork, pork ribs) with a side of onion strings and a piece of catfish. Everything was incredibly delicious. The pork rib, particularly, stood out among the meats  - tons of meat, falling-off-the-bone, great smoked flavor. 

But the catfish was the star. There was a delicious coarse cornbread breading...like a hushpuppy around the fish. Unreal!

Maybe it was because I was eating alone, but there was something magical and welcoming about the atmosphere (a weird word to use for a hole-in-the-wall...) There was a stuffed boar watching me from the corner; i filled up my soda club in a dark closet, but the whole thing was unaccountably perfect. 

One of the DJs from the strip club came in and ate the taller, biggest burger I've ever seen. The two of us chatted with one of the other patrons about how great the BBQ is here. The owner (manager?) noticed that I had done a Yelp checkin and gave me a free dessert (I hadn't even asked). And just as soon as I was wondering how I was going to get back to Caesars...a cabdriver walked in to check out the place. 

I really wanted to go back the next night to try the beef ribs and maybe the baked beans, but alas...it wasn't in the cards.

My mouth is watering for my next trip to Vegas. 

One small note: Rolling Smoke closes kind of early (8 or 8:30) during the week, but it's open late on Fri and Sat. 

Go there now. You won't be sorry.",jUuYKz1NBtstEjUTbyJnMA,5,2,5,0lR-dKgkAQEb5628vuvCGQ

5042269,2014-06-01,2,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Tonight was a good night for new culinary experiences. After watching the new Maleficent movie and having a few glasses of wine, we decided to make our way to Rollin Smoke. I have heard nothing but great things about this place. After checking Yelp, I noticed their 4.5 star overall rating with about 500 reviews. OH-EM-GEE, how have NOT been to this place yet?!?!

It's not surprise, this place is in the middle of an industrial area, right under the freeway and next to all the strip clubs. Sketchy as heck, but holy smoker in their parking lot! The aroma of smoked meats filled the air. I didn't care what the outside looked like, I was more interested in what they had to offer! The inside of the joint is a down home BBQ joint! Different reds and yellows adorn the wall, different rooms to accommodate different types of parties. They have a few rooms and even outside space. There were metal table tops, wooden benches, TVs in each room and a mirage on the back wall of the room we chose to dine in.On every table there was a bottle of their homemade BBQ sauce. It was more of a vinegar base, a little too tangy but that's just my own taste. The staff was super efficient. The guy who took my order, I think was one of the owners. He was super personable and really seemed to care about how things were going, how I liked my food and really thanked me for coming in. For my meal, I wanted to try a few things. Here's what I got:

Half slab of beef ribs, 2 bones, for $15.99. This Smokin Plate came with a side, I chose collard greens, corned bread or roll and a drink. The beef ribs were the best beef ribs I've ever had! It literally just fell off the bone, no joke. The rub they used brought so much flavor to the rib! Every bite was juicy, flavorful and packed with smokey goodness. The collard greens were cooked with brisket, had a little spice and vinegar and so good!

Pulled piggy sandwich for $7.99. **There's a Yelp special when you check in** Every sandwich purchase comes with a free dessert. I chose the peach cobbler (usually for $3.99). The pulled pork sandwich was made with chopped pork, not finely shredded. I loved that because the meat had some depth to it. It was served on a hot dog bun which was different but seemed to work! The corn bread side was buttery and moist, probably the best corn bread I've ever had! I made a comment that my grandma's corn bread was unbelievable but this one gave my grandma's bread a run for it's money (Sorry grandma!).  As my free dessert, the peach cobbler was gooey and filled with chunks of peaches. 

I must say, this is THE BEST BBQ joint in Las Vegas, hands down. I've had a few BBQ joints here before but nothing compares to Rollin Smoke. This place really does a great job at serving great food. When I'm here, it's just good ole country fun. Looking around the dining area, every party seemed to have a huge smile on their face. I've been to lots of places down south, from Nashville, to Louisville, to Charlotte. BBQ joints different where every go but when you're in Las Vegas, you REALLY need to get your butts down here.

The ribs, chicken , hotlines, mac and cheese , BBQ beans and the corn was good. 

I couldn't tell which was the brisket and which was pulled pork. I thought the pulled pork would have the BBQ already one it and the brisket when it says chopped I figured like chopped into slices not demolish. Maybe I got the last of it idk? However when I think of brisket I think slices not a pile of shredded beef.

5051486,2013-06-03,2,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Surprisingly good BBQ in the oddest of strip malls. We missed it the first time around, it's by a Diamonds Cabaret Strip club and when we pulled in the store front is dark so it looks even closed. You'll see large BBQ smokers in the parkinglot so you know you're in the right place. It's open late-ish during the week, and 1:30 am during Fridays and Saturdays! 

Bobby, Misti, and Mamie said something about grabbing some food to eat here after a UYE and somehow it struck a cord with everyone that BBQ sounds amazing and talk was rumbling about hunger that the rest of us decided to sort've crash on their idea. 

The BF and I shared two dishes, made both a combo (drink and 1 side) -

Smoked meatloaf  was awesome. The BF says one of the best he's had. It's definitely great flavor and is a different style of meatloaf being smoked, then basted in some of the sauce and topped with crispy onion rings. It was on a bed of pretty good red skin mashed potatoes. If you love meatloaf, this is something to try. 

Beef ribs are normally something we skip over, but seeing as they looked good and people were actually saying they were quality I decided we should give it a go. It was meaty, juicy and tender which is rarely achieved. I have to compare it to my holy grail of Phils in SD, and while it doesn't have that cracktastic crisp outside to moist (haha CHRISTIE O. ) inside, the quality is definitely there and satisfies that want for a good beef rib. So many places don't even serve it, just because of how hard it is to cook right. These were solid. 

Our sides were also solid. The baked BBQ beans had pulled pork pieces in it and was very good and hearty. Potato salad is the red skin potato style mayo (no mustard) style and had crispy bacon bits and green onions on top. I like all kinds of potato salad and this was good.There was a little bread piece on the basket which was kinda stale and dry which was the only hiccup.  They have one kind of BBQ sauce and it's on the zesty and a tad spicy side which I enjoyed it a lot. 

I really wanted to try a dessert, but we already had the major meat ""itis"". Maybe one day I will come back and eat something ""lighter"", you know, like a sandwich chaulk full of meat. 

It's a order up type of place at the counter and serve yourself drinks out of the beverage closet (it'll make sense once you're there). The staff was friendly and made sure to check on us. 

 Apparently the owners are Arkansas folks and while that is a ""fringe"" state that normally people don't think about slanggin' the 'que, it takes on influence from the best ideas of the rivalry states, really.

 I definitely think even from this first visit, this place raises the bar on BBQ offerings in this town. We will be back, probably really soon.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,9,5,4,8Ym0oub6kR4uv9iJxmyR_A

It's been on my list for a long time and I finally made it down here to see what the hype is all about and I can honestly say the hype is real. I mean you can smell the smoke all throughout the restaurant and all the way outside. We came on a Friday night and it wasn't packed but there were people coming and going the entire time. Me and the boyfriend decided to share a 4 meat combo with three sides which is a really good deal for 19.99. You can sample almost all the meats the have to offer. Almost not all. We chose hot links, pulled pork, spare ribs and brisket. Choosing sides I couldn't decide so quick and they were more than happy to let me sample both the fried okra and the corn nuggets. Easy winner there the corn nuggets are so fricking delicious! Sweet cream corn inside fried crispy with almost a beer batter exterior. The BOMB! We seated ourselves and the food came out not too much longer after. My favorite has to be the ribs. Fall apart tender and just the right amount of smoke. The brisket could have been more tender and the pulled pork was lacking in smoky flavor but still very good. I'm not a fan of hot links but these were pretty good. The greens were delicious and tender and the mac and cheese was very creamy. I prefer a less creamy mac and cheese but it was still good. My favorite were those corn nuggets. I could eat those all day but I don't think that would be a good idea. I asked for some chipotle dipping sauce and it was the perfect condiment. Sweet corn nuggets with a spicy smoky dipping sauce. I guess we were still hungry because. My boyfriend ordered more pulled pork and ribs with greens of course since I had the Mac and cheese.

The wafting aroma of sweet hickory smoke.  The earthy, mild spice rub that has deeply penetrated the proteins; a moist, beefy rib with tender sinew and rendered fat;  fall off the bone baby backs; ""suckably"" delicious cartilage of toothsome spareribs, and glistening slices of brisket.  The acrid, bitterness of the smoke ring in strong contrast to the almost sweet meat.   Food porn!

The sauce has a good vinegar kick that helps to cut the one dimensional flavor and cloying, richness that becomes more difficult to take the more you eat and the colder it gets.  

Their signature, bigger than any human's mouth, stuff falling out, BBQ sauce on your face ""outlaw"" burger is good eats.  Brisket, sauteed onions, peppers, fried onion strips, slaw, veg, cheese and a chipolte aioli; what's not to love?

Remaining menu items less successful.  The breaded catfish and shrimp are both overcooked and rubbery.  The smoked meatloaf, excessively smoky and bitter.  Deep fried sides often oily with one exception, the outstanding cream corn nuggets.  Crispy on the outside, rich creamy corn goodness on the inside.

Prices are very reasonable for the quantity.  The $24.99 AYCE a winner; anything on the menu, one price.

The worthy indulgence is not without cost.  Suffice it to say, remember waking up from a drunken stupor after having smoked your first cigar?  All the mouthwash in the world...",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,21,18,4,Lv6QPpBw9-aKqNbYGnUUgQ

Gone is the mom and pop feel and the prices have increased accordingly and no longer a screaming bargain.  Some examples: they charge $3 for drinks, I could barely finish my meal before but now can so quite comfortably (but still is filling), I was never asked how my food was and when ordering, I was not given any suggestions or descriptions on their menu choices.

Ordered the meat trio $17.99:

Baby back ribs are not no longer fall off the bone and a bit dry.  The BBQ chicken is soft and tender but the smoky flavor and seasoning didn't sink into the meat.  The beef brisket is still pretty good but was chopped too much.

The downside since there from Arkansas, they should know about Sweet Tea....which, when they first opened, there tea was very good but then they contracted with Coke and they supplied them with there version of Sweet Tea, which in my opinion they need to stick to Cola.

The place definitely looks a bit dumpy from the outside but as soon as you pull into the parking lot, you can smell that sweet smell of meat. 

I was going to order the package deal for either $50 or $80 bucks but decided to do a la carte instead since none of us wanted to have hot links. Boy, the damage was quite a chunk of change but the food was delicious.

There is seating on the outside, inside where you order and pay, and there is an additional room to your right hand side when you exit the main entrance. I don't know if we were just lucky or what but we seriously got the entire back room to ourselves. It was awesome. Picnic style benches definitely made it an authentic country style bbq feel. There is a drink station in the cashier's area and the back room where we were at. They have the sauces, to go containers and bags all out for your to bag your left overs.

brisket: delicious, tender and seasoned just right. There was pepper speckles on the edges which gave it a nice taste. There was a thin strip of fat but when it is hot, it melts in your mouth. I tried one after it had cooled and it definitely did not taste as good.

beef ribs: super pricey. I had asked how many ribs a half rack came with and the lady said two. I thought I heard wrong but I ordered a whole rack anyways. When I got it, it was seriously just 4 ribs but they were huge. Melt in your mouth heaven for sure and definitely worth it.

pulled pork: this was probably the only item I did not care for. It was not that well flavored and even with the sauce, it was bleh. Next time I will not order this.

burnt tips: everyone was raving about these burnt tips on yelp so I had to get some. It was good. Nice and saucy but not a crazed fan.

corn nuggets: yummy. nicely fried and sweet.

waffle fries: like your normal waffle fries with a hint of dusted sugar. yumm

bacon potato salad: this was also an item I saw a lot of people raved about but honestly, I thought it was just alright. Didn't taste amazingly good and did not taste bad. I would prefer regular potato salad.

The food came out fast and we definitely had leftovers for two more days so it made it worth while. The establishment is kept clean and friendly service staff.

Next time, I would definitely skip the pulled pork, burnt tips and bacon potato salad. Good to try it at least once but I will definitely be going for the main food items like brisket and beef ribs :)

I would definitely recommend this to any meat eater/bbq fan. As my husband said, this is a Vegetarian/Veagan person's version of hell. Meat, meat and more meat!",EtaJMHr1Df_8B9ODxhqhvQ,4,1,5,mjEC_MTQqKM9YZxfQ7Ro5g

The pulled pork is smoked perfectly, and goes great with the BBQ sauce.  The hot links were quite peppery and succulent. I felt that the brisket was slightly over cooked, but it was okay when i mixed it with sides.

First of all, this is a true hole in the wall place...I would have never tried it if it wasn't for Yelp, and I would have barely found it if they didn't have the BBQ grilles parked out front!

Start off with the food....the Pulled Pork sandwich is truly amazing  :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#3VPTArn4TCy4jDYzeSJbyw

Beautiful char carmelization on the outside...tender juicy goodness on the insides....and the tangy BBQ sauce sets it off!  Not spicy, but it has that flavor depth that is needed for an interesting (but not overpowering) BBQ sauce.  It is easily the best pulled pork sandwich I have had, but it is actually one of my most favorite ways I have consumed the pork beast himself.

For the side, I asked what was most recommended.  I was told to try the mac and cheese :

http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rollin-smoke-barbeque-las-vegas?select=GGZosl72mVr20EopFH0CCQ#uGQtCaucN0VVUbvSjXBlkQ

It was good!  Lots of spices in here...not spicy, but with more depth and distinguishing tastes put into the food here than a normal mac and cheese at most other places.  I can feel the love :P

Yelp check-in merited a free dessert...I was recommended the Peach Cobbler (pictured with the sandwich).  It came out piping hot, gooey and tasty....just wish I had some crust in there like the one I love so much at Wing King.  But besides being crustless, this was an excellent rendition.

I will say that there was a miscommunication at order though, and my side also never came out with my food until I reminded them it was missing.  I was strongly considering dropping my 5 to a 4 star, but the food and prices are so good, that I feel guilty holding it against them.  If the order was taken correctly the first time, I doubt I would have had anything to complain about...again, just a miscommunication.

I didn't expect to find a place that would be on par with good 'ol Texas, but Rollin Smoke definitely takes the award for best barbeque in Las Vegas. 

One of the best things about this place is the staff. Everyone that works there is super friendly, and loves having a conversation with you while they're taking your order. It creates an ambience that really makes you feel at home, which a lot of Vegas restaurants are lacking in. 

You have many different options to choose from including AYCE but honestly, you'd have to come extremely hungry to manage that one. My go to is the three meat combo, which gives you any three meats of your choice, bread, and a side. It's good for those who like a little variety, but also want a little extra to take home. I usually stick with burnt ends a.k.a the only way to eat brisket, ribs, and whatever else I'm feeling that day. They put a little bit of sauce on it for you, but there's also bottles of barbeque sauce at the table so you can go as crazy as you'd like.

I kept reading reviews on this place and finally got out there to try it. I escaped work for a bit and hit it for lunch. I lived in NC for several years and really missed having great barbeque. This has filled the void.

First the meat, I had pulled pork sandwich and my husband had two meat option, pulled pork and brisket. They were both awesome! Cooked nicely on the smokers outside, just enough sauce, not too much, perfect smokey flavor.  Next time I will try the links.

The sides were terrific too. So many places seem to haves sides as an after thought but not here. I had jalapeno coleslaw. It had a nice kick, not too much mayo, super flavorful. Husband had the beans. So good with extra chunks of meat and a smokey flavor. We were both stuffed at the end. All very affordable too! Two meat special, two sides, sandwich combo including drinks for both just $22.

With the great weather I wish they had more tables outside. I could lounge out there and smell the smokers all afternoon. I also wish they could sell beer since that pairs so nicely with barbeque. But that great meat trumps those issues.

Seriously this place precedes itself. Just so you can understand the level that Rollin Smoke is on they were awarded for top 20 best bbq restaurants in america from localeats AND best burger in vegas seven. Yeah...they're pretty epic.

It's pretty easy to miss this place, they're near the cross streets highland and desert inn, inside a signless plaza. Just look for a grill outside and you'll be fine. The vibe of the place is very relaxed mixed with decorations of tshirts, a pig, awards, and a mural. A big plus in my book is the amount of seating they have, from the times I went I never had to fight for a table. 

Customer service? Always on point. They strive for it. Anything wrong with what you're eating? They'll fix it. They always have a guy walking around asking people if they're doing fine. 

If you're coming here for the first time you should definitely try the rib tips, and outlaw burger. It takes a while for the outlaw burger to cook, nonetheless it's worth the wait. Let me start off with the rib tips. You can order 1/2 pound or a pound, if you're eating with a group of people, just share a pound it'll be more than enough. Their rib tips are mouthwatering!!! Cooked to perfection. And when you get those fatty pieces in your mouth you can taste the definition of a good bbq. The outlaw burger is just as satisfying. Let me just list the ingredients in the burger it has; brisket, onions, bell pepper, onion strings, red cabbage, slaw, lettuce, tomato, cheddar cheese, and chipotle ailoi. Yeah, all that in a burger. You know that one question? What do you want to eat before you die? This might be the answer.

Tip: There's no shame in getting your hands dirty and pigging out. Dam son just eat that bbq! And you can order to-go over the phone!",6EX02WhE9qj4UDfPSh-viw,6,2,5,V29PlvZK_y0EI_ZkM73dLA

I've been spending all of my life dreaming of this Southern paradise. Well, at least the part of my life during which I have lived in Las Vegas because prior to that I was in the Southern paradise of Hotlanta. 

Driving here you will have your doubts that you are actually going to end up at an establishment that serves edible items. You may even believe you are being drawn into a cleverly disguised strip club or an automotive shop, but if you have your windows down about half a mile away you will start to smell the que, and you'll know you're headed in the right direction.

I must say that I think their sides are even more delicious than their meat. I sampled their killer fried okra and baked beans, and I would go go back for those alone. But of course, their meat is delicious as well. I went with the two meat sampler and chose pulled pork and brisket. It is a generous heaping of meat. It was hard to tell where the brisket ended and the pork began, but they were both flavorful thanks to a sauce that is more spicy than sweet. The pork was a tad dry, but I didn't let any of it go to waste. 

The environment is definitely casual, and in one room, they are using table cloths because there is apparently a couple of not so attractive tables hiding. However, the table cloths do lead to a lot of stains, so I hope they can wrangle some more attractive tables soon. 

As for service, it is spectacular. The nicest bunch of Arkansas boys you could hope to meet. This should definitely be at the top of your short list of must-try BBQ in Vegas.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,39,19,4,ei0NRtF3mfO5nRw4yASw0Q

Chains restaurants like Dave's and Lucille's are great but missing more of that southern down home feel. Enter Rollin Smoke, located in the shadow of the Las Vegas Strip, this small eatery is does everything right.

We got here around the lunch rush, and had to wait in a small line to order. The host/cashier was Dusty I believe, friendly guy, and he was quick and attentive. Because the staff is well prepared, the food was out within 10 minutes, very quick for a BBQ establishment, and it shows great preparation.

I ordered the Pit Special, and for 20 bucks you get a pick of 4 meats, 3 sides and a drink. That's enough food for 2 meals or to share. I ordered a piece of the catfish on the side, which was very good as well. Catfish is hard to perfect because you have to cook it through but not over cook it. I'm willing to attest that the catfish is about as legit as it gets.

The meat itself was fantastic, the ribs were tender but not greasy. It was nice and smoky with a good texture. Someone on here said the ribs weren't ""fall off the bone"", which  is correct. That's not to say it's tough, because it's not. Being smoked they way they are, they aren't greasy, they pull off the bone with very little effort. That's better than greasy, mushy ""fall off the bone"" people talk about when they use that phrase.


The sides were fantastic. The loaded mash was pretty good, not as good as some of the garlic mash I've had, BUT, excellent in it's own right. The mac and cheese was great. I'm kind of a mac and cheese snob, and nothing is as good as my moms homemade, but this was better than most BBQ/Southern restaurants. My one and only complaint was that the food could have been a bit warmer. That's it. 

For not much money you can eat like a king. Fast friendly staff, and great food makes this hidden gem a winner in my eyes.",C5Qn-hpdAfMbi4HxWeBZhQ,5,1,5,M9xkEb7E7zJZwJnpc-watQ

Our Las Vegas crew raved about it though.  Finally, when I made it out to Vegas for the millionth time we decided to swing by for some finger lickin' BBQ.  It's located quite a ways off the strip, just down the street from Spearmint Rhino, in an industrial looking area.  It's a pretty small place, but it's got some BIG flavors.   I got the 3 meat plate, since I felt like I had to stuff my face the first time to make sure I tried all the good stuff.  I picked the brisket (which is chopped unless you ask otherwise), chicken, and ribs.  For my side, I had the macaroni and cheese.  The boyfriend had the Big Hawg (pulled pork sandwich).  We didn't realize that they'd put an entire pig's worth of pulled pork in that sandwich, but we're not complaining.  The pulled pork was very tender and juicy, and the sandwich was stuffed with a whole pig, coleslaw and some delicious bbq sauce.  My 3 meats were pretty good as well, the chopped brisket had nice crispy pieces and nice juicy/tender pieces.  It was a good balance.  The chicken wasn't anything stellar, but it was good.  I really enjoyed the ribs though.  I'm not a huge rib eater because I don't really like to get my hands dirty, but these ribs fell right off the bone.  I'm totally down with that.  I'd skip the mac and cheese and go for the dirty rice (if you're brave enough) next time.  I had a few bites of my friends' rice, and I fell in love and then became insanely jealous.  

The staff here is super friendly and attentive.  They'd come out and check on you every now and then to make sure that you have everything you need.  The place is clean, but seating is limited.  We got there at just about 11AM, and it was empty, but moments later it filled up quick.  They also have several different BBQ sauces out for you to try as well.  I liked the spicy one, it went well with the brisket.  I may have to add Rollin' Smoke to my list of places that I must visit when I come to Vegas.  That list is getting long, and it's getting difficult to get through the list each time.  Damn you Vegas for having such good food!",kNbngGqDVQddsKWDc5AIRQ,3,1,5,O2CPH88ThpnrvwT2iFKVIA

We wanted to branch out for a new lunch spot--something that wasn't on the strip or in our hotel. I Yelped ""lunch"" and Rollin Smoke was one of the first places to pop up. So me, my girlfriend and my sister piled into an Uber and set out for some bbq. 

The menu can be a bit overwhelming with all of the different meats and combinations. I wanted to sample a little bit of it all, so I opted for the 5 meat platter: pulled pork; brisket; hot link; chicken; spare ribs. Everything was really good and unlike some other Yelpers, my chicken was fall-off-the-bone tender. I love seeing that tasty smoke ring on the ribs and the meat melted in my mouth. The sauce selection was great and I really like that they allow you to sauce the meat yourself. Nothing worse than bad bbq being covered up by an abundance of sauce. 

With the 5 meat platter you are given a choice of 3 sides...I opted for the baked beans; collards and mac and cheese. All were very good and the bits of pork found in the collards added flavor and were a nice touch. The mac and cheese was gooey and had that homemade feel. 

Also, the service was great. The employees at the counter were helpful and it seemed like every few minutes a staff member would come into the room we were dining in to make sure everybody was enjoying their food.

Having recently returned from a Lone Star State tour of smoked meat Meccas ranging from Black's and Snow's to Pecan Lodge and Franklin it was with modest expectations but high hopes that I approached Rollin Smoke, a space many locals and critics have hailed as the best barbeque in Las Vegas, and opting to explore the menu through a generous $24.99 all-you-can eat program I must say I walked away a (very full) believer.  Located on South Highland where outdoor smokers and burning hickory alert the senses to something more than industrial surroundings Rollin Smoke is as small and homey as many a' Texas or Kansas City 'cue spots and staffed by Razorback pitmaster Trey Holland plus a dedicated team of enthusiasts the service is every bit on par with that down south - a true love of the art noted in lengthy answers to questions about woods, temperatures, and process while simultaneously making sure every guest is content.  Featuring a diverse menu with spices and rubs harkening the style of BBQ found across the south but a bit more aggressively sweet than that in Texas it was with a trio of smoked meats, two must-order sides, and buttery cornbread that I began and although brisket was a bit drier than I'd prefer the smoke was prominent and flavor was on point - a trend extending to fatty ribs and supple pulled pork that lacked not for juices, the latter falling just short of KC's Oklahoma Joe's reference standard.  Still nibbling at the creamy corn nuggets as plate two arrived it was here that I sampled Holland's two most raved items and with a blackened caramelized crust overlying tender flesh and melted collagen the beef rib wowed just as much as the signature meatloaf, absolutely rife with hickory notes and light heat amidst a delicately packed beef.  Ignoring decent but mundane chicken and mac n' cheese I found inedibly bland compared to the rich potatoes and previous fried sides it was with a duo of desserts that I rounded out the tasting and suffice it to say that while banana pudding tastes straight from a box the focus should instead be directed to the cobbler, a bubbling bowl of soft peaches with buttery pie crust crowned with Texas' own Blue Bell vanilla - a perfect end to a pretty damned good meal by any standard.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,12,9,4,LjyNUfBiJB02sGsrgALckw

5355572,2015-07-05,12,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Rollin Smoke Barbeque is the epitome of what a BBQ joint should be. My roommate and I came here to satisfy our BBQ fix, and were actually really impressed. 

When we first arrived, it was busy and no one was at the counter for a while. However, the wait was well worth it because Rollin Smoke Barbeque beats out all the chain BBQ places in Vegas.

Inside, there are two dining rooms with one of the rooms being where you order. The rooms fill up quickly when it's busy so if you want to dine-in, try finding a seat first. There are also a few wooden picnic tables outside for outdoor seating.

As for the food, I ordered the trio choice plate with a side of fried okra and an a la carte order of cornbread.

The trio choice plate was your pick of 3 meats (out of: brisket, pork, 1/4 chicken, 2 spare ribs, or a hot link). Everything about my order was on point. The pork was soft and succulent, with a tenderness that made it practically melt in your mouth. The brisket was probably the highlight of the trio platter. Whenever I go to BBQ places, they usually end up burning some of the brisket, but it was perfect here. Savor these tender cuts of meat because it's THAT good. As for the chicken, it was a little on the pink side, but the parts I did eat had a smokey BBQ flavor. (Don't be afraid to literally drench your food in the BBQ sauce they have on the table!)
The fried okra were little bite-sized pieces of heaven. The cornbread wasn't dry like most places; it had a good texture with the classic, sweet cornbread taste.

The parking lot to this place is on the small side and it can get awkward getting into if you're not alert, but who would've thought that this little treasure would be in the midst of all the plumbing and electrical buildings nearby.

       - AYCE - They have a $25 AYCE, anything on the menu deal. I'd suggest people doing this so you can try a little of everything.
       - Authentic BBQ - Walking in, you can smell this place knows how to BBQ. They have smokers in the back. That's how you know they're the real deal.
       - Hole in the Wall - The location is located on Highland Drive. Yep, it's the same seedy highland drive with all the strip joints.
**Ordered**
       - Pulled Pork - I've had a lot of pulled pork in my day, but nothing as tender and mouth watering as this. It's a must order.
       - Brisket - Not like the dry briskets you'll get elsewhere. Their brisket is tender and flavorful.
       - Beef Rib, Baby Back - Very meaty. Like I mean, TONS of meat on this bone. However, it's not really fall off the bone.
       - Baby Back and Spare Ribs - The flavor of their rub and BBQ sauce is delicious, but the meat wasn't too tender.
       - Catfish - Deep fried to perfection, but lacking in spices I'd say.
       - Bacon Potato Salad - If you like potato salad, adding sweet sweet bacon to it is a no brainer.
       - Corn Bread - Moist and hot out of the oven. You can't go wrong with corn bread.

**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you like BBQ. The brisket and pulled pork were my favorites.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,2,4,8eq1Q9xeFfbWNm0grnBNaA

My favorite was between the chopped and burnt ends. Makes me hungry just thinking about it... I got the Mac n Cheese as my side, also delicious. Pretty much nothing fancy, just Meat and Mac n Cheese. As for the food, probably the best BBQ I've had. The location kinda sucks but it is close to work so I guess that's a plus. The only drawback that I can think of is the price.

I thought he was taking a take out order.  Came to realize that he was the owner, now that is just not good customer service. That was the first reason it didn't deserve a five, then the next reason was that I came to look at the photos to see if we for what was in the photo since the owner was telling everyone including myself to yelp for him 4 and 5 only please.  He even said you can do it from your cell phone.  I told him then i saw you got 4.5 stars. i don't know if you get as much as some of the photos featured, for sure the burger was Hugh but the trio and such I am not sure.  The strike two was on one of the photos it said free dessert if you yelp, well when I ordered my blueberry a la mode he didn't give it to me for free or even mentioned it.  He has been there for a year and at this point as a business owner wouldn't you do this to get people to come back? Or suggest this place? Or even yelp for you?  What is 6.00 dessert? Strike three:  they didn't bring out all the right sides well I mean he said this it I had to tell him we still have a side of rings and an order of waffle fries.  This is the reason they got a three from me.  The food was delicious to everyone that went, the baby backs didn't seem to fall off Like the spare ribs.  The brisket fries were Huge and yummy.  The Brisket dog look great and I heard it was delicious.  I couldn't try it because I am not a fan of smoke burnt BBQ, there is Noy one kind of BBQ sauce and it was not my fav with the tangy taste.  I like the sweetness of BBQ sauce. I am also big on service even if the food is awesome for them to get a five.  In some cases no service is okay but it want because they were super busy and for god sake it was the owner not an employee.  Oh and the bathroom is weak, one single one and it doesn't flush well after you have been waiting, luckily it was not a number two for me.  The toilet paper just would flush...yikes.

So this place, great service. The guy who took our order was nice; our food didn't take ridiculously long to come out. My wife and I split a trio with chicken, hot links and spare ribs. For $17 & some change, I was disappointed with the portion sizes. 1 hot link (not sure why they said linkS), 2 medium size spare ribs, 1 chicken drumstick & 1 thigh. Sorry, I may be spoiled by Chicago's fine eating rep but $17 at a BBQ joint in Chi-town typically gets you A LOT MORE. I also decided to try a blackberry cobbler (the menu says blueberry but they have blackberry)

Food wise, it was ok. The rub on the ribs were ""OK"" (I've definitely had better). They weren't super tough but they weren't slide off the bone tender, they were somewhere in the middle. The hot link was actually good but it wasn't a smoked hot link that's standard for a BBQ joint but a pork hot link. The chicken was ok. My wife didn't like the seasoning on it so she peeled back the skin & put BBQ sauce on it. The blackberry cobbler was descent but considering the stark tartness of blackberry, it could've been sweeter to offset the tartness.

1. Parking is difficult if they are busy at all.

The service was top notch with about 3 people asking me if everything was good.  Unless you are maybe an ultra bbq snob, you will love this place if you love bbq.

Anway we ordered the trio and my daughter didn't want the chicken, so he replaced that with another rib ..(you can switch anything around , and depending what you get there may be a upcharge which is not bad. Now I had the brisket trio...OMG... burnt ends, sliced and chopped.. Plus I asked for a beef rib as well. The beef rib is gigantic..looked like a bone from the flintstones...so damn good..it was tender and just so damn good. My fiancé had the outlaw burger... OMG..Huge and delicious. Those onion straws are also the best I ever had.. Now after our meal, next thing we knew the cooks and Kathy (love her) came to our table and sang happy birthday to my daughter and brought a little dessert out for her..

The BBQ was great last time but not so much today.  Brisket came cold and not a lot of flavor.  Didn't like the way they pulverized it.  Sliced is better like Franklin BBQ.  Maybe that's the way they do it in Arkansas.  Ribs and hot links were okay, sides of potato salad, collards, and cole slaw good.  They have great homemade sauces.

And I've found that the West Coast didn't have much in the way of barbecue when I was living in SoCal (correct me if I'm wrong, I take suggestions).  And while I like Lucille's here, that's more Cajun than the stuff I grew up with.

On a whim, we found this place.  It's in the middle of nowhere, in an area you probably wouldn't venture to, in a tiny shopping center that you wouldn't notice.  But you'll notice that smell when you step out of the car.  And I mean BAM!

Once that scent hit my nose, I had to know more.  Also, not Texas based, I will graciously concede that Arkansas knows their stuff, and this place knows their stuff.

The staff is nice, and one look at them told me these people weren't anything but legit.  I liked the cook immediately.  We ordered a rib combo plate, and let the dining begin.

It was so good.  Nice and spicy, meat falling off the bone, a big squirt bottle of sauce on the table, I ate and ate and ate, and then I got kind of woozy, and asked for a ""to go"".  I moaned all the way home.  Partly because I was full, yes, but partly because this place hit the sweet spot of barbecue goodness.  I went for my leftovers, and shredded bones like a barbarian.

I regret nothing.

Will I go back?  Absolutely.  Small, subtle, out of the way, but so worth it when it came to dining options, friendly people, fast service, and quality of food.

We got to try all of the sauces i loved the vinegar and peppers where my husband liked the mustard based sauce. 
My husband noticed that they has an all you can eat option that featured everything on the menu. So that is what he wanted to do the next time we came to town. 
The all you can eat is 35.99 which is very comparable to some of the buffets on the strip but the quality is so much better, for the AYCE you start with 3 meats and 2 sides, you have a hour time limit, you skip the line to order more, and you can pretty much get anything on the menu including desserts. Come hungry, they give you full size portions with every order.
 My husband who can eat more then most people got full after the 2nd order but insisted on getting a few more things so he could say he tried all the meats on the menu. 
My favorite are the burnt ends they are so worth it, (you usually have to pay more for them for most meals but they are included in the AYCE). The hubby loved the St. Louis ribs and the smoked meatloaf, but everything we had was pretty amazing.

I have eaten here three times and was satisfied every time, The pork shoulder is mighty fine, brisket real good too, however the ribs have been a little dry both times I ordered them. Maybe I just played unlucky and ordered them at the wrong time. I like their sauce quite a lot, it's tart, not too thick and spicy enough that one is not tempted to overdo it.

I called at 8:40 PM last night, although they were closed Chef Tim was gracious enough to let me pick up 2 lbs, of sliced brisket after hours. The brisket was excellent, juicy with a very dark crust and just enough fat.

The customer service is great as well, they come around and check on you a few times to make sure you are enjoying the experience.  As I'm writing this review, I'm already planning my next order....perhaps beef rib with beef brisket and I'm determined to have some fried okra next time!",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,6,4,5,D11sxw8xigzeAw-aen2kww

Either they're great at ribs, or great at pork, or great at brisket. But for whatever reason it's really hard for any barbecue place to be great across the board.

Well, stop the press. Because Rollin Smoke just raised the bar.

Every meat that comes out of the smoker is perfectly done. The ribs are served dry - the melted fat of the meat captures the hickory smoke and the dry rub is as good as they get. The pulled pork is great. The brisket is worth going out of your way for - and I'm somebody who generally isn't a huge brisket fan. The hot link has a nice slow burn to it.

The sauces served alongside the meat complement it well - but they aren't necessary. The Carolina vinegar sauce pairs best with the pulled pork - especially with a little slaw on top.

Their sides are impeccable too. Just really flawless.

Portions are huge too. I'll order a 3-meat combo here at lunch and gnaw on it for another full meal and a half.

I just can't say enough good things about this place. It makes me happy even just Yelping about it.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,0,5,w9zAb0fPtMZ1nFj_zVgfXw

It was a place you order and grab your seat. They offer an ample amount of picnic bench seating so don't worry about a rush and not having a place to sit. Just think you can make friends with someone new. I got here around noon on a Friday. I just beat the rush. But as I said don't let that steer you away; quick and efficient service.

You walk up and place your order. We ordered a smoking plate of the pork bbq ribs, bread and the mac n cheese combo and the fiancee ordered a smoked brisket sandwich. We also ordered the blueberry cobbler a la mode.

The ribs were really good. I like my ribs with a lot of sauce so luckily there was a bottle of sauce on each table. There are 2 dining areas with TVs, as well as outdoor seating. The outdoor seating is pretty much used for smokers. 

The staff is really courteous, friendly and informative. If you're new to the restaurant, they are very helpful in making your decision. We did notice a lot of first timers.

The only issue we had, was that our food came out lukewarm. Not sure if the food was sitting out for a few minutes before serving to us, but it would have been tastier if the food was hot upon arrival.

The baby back ribs I had were tender, smoky and flavorful.  A little extra house BBQ sauce made it even better, even though they are good when eaten dry too.  The only negative was that the thin membrane on the bottom of the bone wasn't pulled off...although it's a time-consuming process, it could have allowed additional smoke to the bottom of the meat, too.

My colleagues shared a sampler platter and thought it was some of the best BBQ they've had...and remarked that the baked beans were THE best they've ever had.  I can't disagree, comparing it only to SmoQue (Chicago) BBQ's brisket beans.  Awesome.

Anyway, this was definitely a welcome surprise, finding this place without reading reviews or being referred beforehand.

5596986,2015-07-11,0,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,We went for our first time for lunch on a busy Friday afternoon. I had the brisket sandwich and my boyfriend and the three meat meal with three sides. Everything was amazing. The corn nuggets were my favorite side and all the meat was cooked to perfection.  The reason for the 4 stars was that it took quite some time to get our food. I know they were busy but it took about 45 minutes after we ordered to get our food. I am sure we will be back.,wggDBDBWmkjL2Dwb2dfZBA,1,0,4,5xSuygX8s9p0CGBOuinjJA
5599609,2013-12-13,1,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"I have bookmarked this joint a while back and finally managed to swing by today.  I was heading toward Spring Mountain through the south off ramp from the I-15 flyway to get my pho sesh when I realized that Rollin' Smoke was right off Highland Drive.  I don't know about y'all, but there is only one thing I do in this industrial area at involves poles and minimal clothing, so yeah....great place to put a BBQ establishment!

I decided to go with something not too heavy, not knowing that a light meal here is equivalent to a light meal in Hawaii...no such things as smeediums here.  The sandwiches offer a check in discount to include some dessert as well.  I ended up saving mine after being more than satisfied following my meal.

I opted for the Outlaw, for those that know, you know.  It comes with a brisket burger, deep fried onion crisps, there very own BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese on a lightly toasted bun and topped with some pickles and peppers.  Additionally, I made it a meal and added fried okra on the side.  

The meal came out rather quickly, considering that there were other patrons that were there before me, but have not yet gotten their dishes...and when their dishes did come out, it wasn't anything huge or extravagant.  So note to self, burgers and sandwiches come with the quickness.

However, there is something about burgers that in now way humanly possible can fit into anyone's mouth, no matter how much you smash it down by hand.  I had to cut the bad boy into 4's in order to get it down without getting cited for indecency.  Kinda like getting a salad from a place that serves it on the smallest petrie dish ever constructed...I never seemed to ever get the logic in that.  But seriously, I'd rather complain about my meal being way over sized versus being a meal for an action figure.  

One thing I noticed though, they do not ask how you would like your burger, meaning that it comes standard as what looked to be medium rare plus, but not quite well.  It was moist and flavorful, but started to toughen up towards the end when it cooled off.  The Okra was on point and the BBQ is a nice compliment.  

The decor is like most BBQ joints that is accustomed to getting thrashed following a nice serving, evidenced by the whole paper towel rolls at each table.  There is no sense getting all done up if you are there to get dirty.  Yet, there was three flat screens playing three different ESPN channels, always a good sign.  The place appears to stick to it's Arkansas roots and has the Razorback Fight Song posted on the wall in the extended dining room.

What rubbed me the wrong way was that I dropped a few bucks in the tip bucket right in front of the waiter, and he did not even acknowledge it.  That was disturbing since I actually clean up after myself pretty well.  I almost felt like sticking my hand back in the bucket like I was fishing for catfish, but oh well, I may be making too big a deal about it. 

I definitely want to come back to try the ribs and other offerings, so if its BBQ you want, this is the place to be.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,3,1,4,7JfZ_NCAJzhLGqXO3zvWXg

we got the pit special.  i found all the meats to be average at best and quite a few tasted re-heated.  the baby back ribs were not enjoyable for me. the bbq sauce was nice - found myself adding a lot to the meat to help the flavor.

the sides were excellent - we got: bacon potato salad, jalapeno cole slaw, and mac n cheese.  the cole slaw went well with a fork full of pulled pork (which wasn't all that good on it's own).

banana pudding was terrible, i threw it out. i can make it better myself and i'm no chef.

When you get out of your car and walk up to the door you are immediately hit with the most wonderful smell. Ordering happens at the cashier up front and the wait wasn't bad but considering that we went on a Saturday around 11:30am it probably gets incredibly busy later in the afternoon. 

The lady taking our order was super friendly and she recommended trying the burnt edges brisket. They do have an up charge and I am not sure how much but it was totally worth it. I ordered the combo two meat plate: burnt edges brisket & chicken and for my side I choose the corn nuggets. 

My husband got sliced brisket & chicken and his sides were Mac & cheese and collards. 

The burnt edges were so delicious and I can confidently say way better then the sliced version. I would pass on the collards and the chicken. The collards were too salty for my taste and the chicken was dry. However, the Mac and cheese and the corn nuggets were excellent.

This place is one of Vegas's hidden gems. Located under an overpass on the backside (i.e. More seedy section) of the strip in an industrial area, only the locals know where to find it. You can smell the hickory smoke before you even park the car.

The place is small, and consists of some wooden picnic tables for dining, and a front counter with register. There is only one menu, on the wall behind the counter, so make sure to know what you want before you get to the front. 

I personally suggest the brisket three ways and the chicken sliders (served on sweet Hawaiian rolls to boot). You will not be disappointed in the quality of meat, customer service, or level of smoke infused into your meal. The Arkansauce is pretty darn good too, although the meat doesn't necessarily need it. This place is awesome!

I took everything to go and once I drove 15 minutes to my room we tried all the food and it was amazing. It had a good hint of smoke and all the meat was soft and falling off the bone in the best possible way. The signature sauce was like liquid crack and I was about to drink it and the Damn hot was exactly what it says. I love spicy but the hot sauce burns all over your mouth so I am good with that but it had flavor so if you can handle it go for it.

This was an impromptu visit- I had very little time to prepare, so little that I, (yes me) arrived wearing a pretty teal dress and high heeled boots. Clearly, I wasn't prepared for the feast of sauces and meats that was about to grace both my lips, and outfit. 
It's tucked in a gritty strip mall in Vegas, off the strip, near a strip club, and paired, ironically, with a Christian radio station. (WTF?) 
We pulled in after a convention, at 6pm, and headed into the small storefront, as the 5-0 pulled someone over in the lot. The interior is coated in a mural, some yellow paint and stocked full of picnic tables in the color of barbecue sauce. (Appropriately) If you make your way towards the giant pig-head mounted chest high on the wall, you'll find the menus. Or read it from the ordering stand in the back right, where you can see a glimpse of the kitchen through a swinging door as you await blurting out your overly excited order.
""Meaty sampler for two, for me, but add a half pound of burnt tips, just the tips, that's what she said, sorry, I can't help myself, I meant burnt ends."" the guy behind the counter chuckled, and asked what sides, sizing me up in my frilly girly attire. ""Corn nuggets"" that was the moment. The defining moment of the night. (I also got the Mac & cheese and greenbeens- a girl's gotta be sensible) 
I gladly exchanged my cash for the idea that I'd soon have my hands (among other things) on this highly renowned meat.
We found an empty picnic table in the side room, and I filled it with napkins and little cups of barbecue sauces in preparation. As I anxiously awaited my trays of food, I was entertained by the 5-0 who were busy just outside the window arresting two hoodlums and launching them into a paddy-wagon. Dinner-and a show? #Winning.
I heard my name. ""Meg-Ann"" (close enough) and jumped up to claim my anticipated treasure. Before me was a tray coated with shredded chicken, smoked sausage, ribs, BBQ chicken and brisket. 
I'm fairly certain my eyes grew to a third the size of my face, and I began drooling as I inhaled the scent of southern deliciousness. A second tray graced my presence- I got so giddy I *almost* peed. There they were, Corn-freaking-nuggets. 
I squealed. The entire room responded to my outburst.
Burnt ends. Ooey, gooey, meaty, melty tips of immense flavor and fat and fabulous that trumped everything else..., everything, that is, but the corn nuggets. Those little fuckers could easily be responsible for my crossing over from the fit-side, to the obese, type 2, side. And all without question. They're sweet, crunchy, and tender, and easily justified by the fact that they contain a vegetable (not that corn is an exemplary veggie). I allowed a few before it began. I rolled my shoulders back, tossed my hair behind them, and wiggled my fingers before diving into the trough of meat before me.
I really can't explain what happened in those first few minutes. I remember the blue and red lights flashing across my face, lighting my blond hair in a blaze of color, as I mauled through flavors of carnal deliciousness. There was sauce everywhere... My face, my cheek, my forehead.... My hands, my arms, the table, my dress? And even some on the napkins I laid in preparation.
I don't think I had a fork. Maybe I had one, but in the whirl of BBQ sauce and meat stuffs, and smokey flavor and blue and red lights and burnt ends, I can't see where it fit in, how, or if.
I annihilated the burnt ends. They were truly the best and most succulent bits of yum that graced my lips (hair/face/clothing....) they didn't need the sauces, so I saved them for the chicken. All the meat was tender, busting with smoky flavor, and cooked with love. (Or lard. I get those two confused) 
I wasn't able to eat it all. Those sit-ups only allowed for a slight expansion of my diaphragm, and I wasn't capable of shoveling any more deliciousness in. I tried. I tried so hard. And it was worth the carnage. The other patrons stared at me like I was a mystical unicorn vomiting rainbows. The girl they saw walk in morphed into a ravenous monster hell bent on BBQ domination.
This was, by far, my favorite BBQ experience of my existence. I'm still questioning whether they laced the meat with LSD or some other psychotropic drug that could explain the transformation that took place that night. But I'll chalk it up to all that ""love"" they used in making my meaty meal.
Yelp- this place knows BBQ, just don't be afraid to lose yourself in the magic and mayhem that is Rollin Smoke.

   The sliced brisket had a nIce little smoke on it with enough fat on it so it's tender, I mean practically fork cutting tender. 
  But the star is the burnt ends!!!!  Seriously melt in your mouth and the  sauce is just clinging to each of the moist, flavorful morsel of meat.  It is by far the best burnt ends ever conceived.  
  The other sides we bought were the corn tots, I can't remember what their actually called but they are good. It's creamed corn that's deep fried .

We didn't leave a single crumb on our plate. We also had the banana pudding that one of the chefs so nicely gave us on the house, just to be nice. He told us that there are several chefs, each one specializing in their own meat. How cool is that? No wonder it was all good. My husband hasn't stopped talking about our meal so we're going back tonight for more, I want to try the peach cobbler! Shout out to Matt at the register for helping us decide what to order. All the employees were so nice and friendly. The atmosphere is relaxed and fun. When we pulled up, our Uber driver wished us luck.

Went on Saturday 2-20-16 at 5pm.  This restaurant is located in the dark seedy underbelly of Desert Inn & the 15, surrounded by strip clubs and industrial yards.  We actually came here one time before but it was dark and we were scared of the area so we went somewhere else.  We're fraidy cats! I'm glad we gave it a second chance.  

$18.91 got us a two meat combo and an additional side of corn nuggets.  For my two meat combo I chose chicken and pork, and chose mac & cheese for my side.  The combo comes with a drink in a cute re-usable cup.  

They do have one high chair for the kiddos.  The ambiance is casual, staff is friendly, and there's more seating than you'd think from looking at the outside.  It was a little cleaner than I was expecting but not much.  

The chicken was juicy, tender, smoky, and wonderful.  The pork....oh deer sweet 8 lb. 10 oz. baby jesus that pork is somethin' else.  It will melt in your mouth.  And their house bbq sauce is perfectly sweet and tangy.  The mac & cheese is made with perfectly cooked cavatappi and swimming in runny cheesy goodness.

Why? 

Good food, good prices and they have one of the gnarliest burgers I have ever seen.  Additionally, the food tastes excellent too.  The burger is little excessive on the onion strings but I'll take it anyway.  It's definitely bursting with flavor.

So this place has been on my radar ever since I saw the pictures of the Outlaw Burger.  Since I love burgers, I had to make it here when I was in the area.  Luckily, I finally had that chance.  So with no hesitation, I walked in, stepped up to the counter and proudly, enthusiastically and anxiously as hell, ordered the Outlaw Burger...with a side of loaded mashed potatoes and cornbread.

After only a few minutes (maybe 10 at the most but probably considerably less) the server delivered my order.  The Outlaw Burger is a monster!  The thing is probably about a foot tall, mostly onion strings but the actual meat and cheese portion of the burger is delicious.  The only downside is that halfway through the thing was falling apart and I pretty much had to eat it like a salad.  I'm not going to complain though because the thing was delicious.

The loaded mashed potatoes were a worthy addition to the meal and really hit the spot.  The sweet cornbread wasn't too bad but I probably would have ordered the corn nuggets or whatever they were called next time given the amount and since I've had sweeter, tastier cornbread before from my local grocer (in Rollin' Smoke's defense, I've yet to find better cornbread outside this particular grocer).

Service was good, the food arrived quickly and it hit the spot for sure.  For an off the beaten path little BBQ joint, this place has it going on.  I'm already thinking about eating here again, the only thing keeping me is a few hundred miles...at least for now.

They are nestled in the heart of the strip club district on Industrial, but worth the drive to the neighborhood. I've been here a few times with large groups of people and I love the pit room in the back, it even has a really cool grill fish tank. 

Rollin Smoke really excels at their BBQ and sauces. We always get the pit special, 4 meats and 3 sides, and it feeds my little family of three. Their ribs and brisket are especially good. They do lack consistency though, the first time I had the brisket I could cut it with a fork and another time it was a bit tough. Either way, you want to slather it in the sauce on the table, it's the perfect tangy sweet spicy BBQ sauce. 

Rollin Smoke is a bit of a let down when it comes to sides. I've tried many of them and the only ones worth mentioning in my opinion are the waffle fries, the green beans, and the hush puppies. You do definitely want a side of corn bread though, it's so good and sitting in a little butter bath. YES!

Hot Links: The perfect meat side for my rib meal, yes I get meats as a side to my meat. The taste wasn't as ""hot"" as you would think, then again my mom raised me with a molcajete. Tasty to dip in your favorite sauce. 4/5

Sauces..Ask them for a sample tasting of them before you make a decision of such high importance

Sides 

Corn Bread: My relationship with corn bread has always been 50/50. I approve of this one. Soft at the bite, taste home made, the style of it was made to be had with this meal. 4/5

BBQ Beans: These are my babies when it comes to BBQ meals, there was a hint of flavor that elevated it past average but nothing that I'd recommend in bold if you're not such a fan of beans to begin with. 3.7/5

Waffle Fries: The side I dipped in the least. Missing a good seasoning, lacked a crisp taste. 2/5

Potato Salad: In a league of it's own. Someone was a side hog with this one but the 2 spoons of it were very good. Hard to break down the flavor but Javier approved. 4.25/5

Dessert:

Banana Pudding: I'm so sad I was too full to indulge in this the way my inner child would have liked. But this swirled me back to my cubbie days when I thought snack packs were the bomb. The nilla cookies added to this only makes it sound that much better, right? And that's because it is. 4.5/5

Woah, looks like I guinea pigged it for you.

This all was not a bad price either, considering Vegas is Vegas. It was $40 something, The only downward arrow is that the sides are uber small, meaning it's a portion for one. Order 2 of the ones you think you may like the most if you're meal sharing.     

Service:

This was a to go order. It was ready in the said time, they sent me off with sample tastings of their sauces, their customer service enthusiasm was meh. I'd say they're their BBQ beans equivalent in this department. 3.7/5

My Final Say

We all know somewhere in Kansas City or Austin there lays an establishment that is probably better than Rollin Smoke, but regionally speaking, I have not met a close competitor to this place in the West. Let that serve as my 5 star justification. 

I recommend coming here, unless you're a part of Hank Hill's blood line, I am sure you will be satisfied with your meal here.

If you're craving for moderately-priced BBQ in and around the Strip, then Rollin Smoke should do the trick. It's a hole-in-the-wall, underneath the highway, tucked in a tiny strip mall near Spearmint Rhino -- uh, yeah so you should have no trouble finding the place. 

I had the 2-item combo, with the brisket and spare ribs. I also ordered an extra beef short rib. The only thing memorable was that giant beef rib. Tender, juicy, succulent and slightly sweet meat that came cleanly off the bone.

*Thumbs down*
The brisket was slightly dry, and the spare ribs were bland. It desperately needed some of their house made BBQ sauce, which is super peppery.",KFZISl5mOUJ6bu3qCUrO-g,7,5,3,FGvIM8Cr_dgQxpEjJ_XDJw

Brisket is pretty good although the their burnt ends are actually burnt ends.

Burgers are pretty good value and most of their sides have good flavor (try the corn nuggets or loaded potatoes)

The real problem is that their service is pretty bad. I've spent over 20 minutes waiting while my friends got their food in 5 minutes. I asked them to check on the food and they said ""I'm sure it's coming"" and shoved my check back in my face.

My friend suggested this place called - ""Rollin Smoke Barbeque"" so we flipped on our GPS and headed to the back roads to a seedy part of town (where there were a lot of strip clubs, bars, & adult book stores).........but then when we finally found this place and walked in............ I was in Ba Ba Barbeque heaven!!!!

The restaurant was really packed, and as we walked to the counter, the friendly clerk took our orders. After you order your food, you find an open table (good luck), and when your food is ready, they will bring your order out to you.

There is a Sauce station within the restaurant where you can get additional BBQ sauce. I want to point out.........try the ""Mama Sweet"" BBQ sauce! It was bomb @ss good! My friend liked this BBQ sauce so much, I actually saw him put it in a little cup & drink the sauce! That's how much he loved the BBQ sauce!

Before you sit down at your table, you will also have to get your own plastic eating utensils, napkins, as well as your own drinks, as the soda fountain within the restaurant was self serve.

For my meal that night, I ordered the ""Trio Choice of Meats"" - where I picked the following - Brisket, 1/4 Chicken, & 2 Spare Ribs. ($17.99)

One of my friends also ordered the ""Trio Choice of Meats""  - where he picked the Brisket, 2 Spare Ribs, & Hot Links. ($17.99)

And my other friend ordered the ""Duo Choice Of 2 Meats"" - where he picked the Brisket, & Pulled Pork. ($13.99)

With our meals came with a side, and I ended up taking the corn bread. All of our meals came with collard greens, and the collard greens had some kind of smoked meat mixed inside.

What can I say about the grub?

I totally loved the BBQ Chicken! The chicken meat was all so soft, and the meal literally fell off the bone.......nice smokey flavor too! 
The spare ribs was also delicious, and I just loved how the meat came off of the bone so easily! I really loved how soft the BBQ ribs were....... 
As for the brisket.........it was just okay for me. Loved the smokey flavor, but I gotta tell you the brisket wasn't very soft. I've had better tasting brisket on Oahu.......from ""Verde"" in Kaimuki.

Overall a pretty good barbeque joint! No frills..........kinda of place, and they definitely churn out some pretty great barbeque meats! 

Be careful of your surroundings when coming here........if I was with my girlfriend, I'd probably pass on this place.........my friend also mentioned to me that if he was here with his wife & kids, he'd probably do the same.",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,10,8,4,lCXp88s6O_Qaj5ZXES35LQ

  Brisket was SOOOOOOOOO good. It was shredded up and looks just like the pulled pork to the point that my bf and I were trying to figure out which was which from our photo.  I didn't like the pulled pork (lacked flavor and was dry) and the spare ribs were okay. 
  
 Sides:  Hush puppies (meh), Corn nuggests (THE DEALIO IS HERE), and kickin beans (yes!) 

 My bf thought this place was so legit, we went back 2 days later. I asked at the front where you order SHOWING the photo of my original Pit Special plate and asked him which meat was brisket and which one was pulled pork. We wanted to get it right, because one was substantially better tasting than the other. And, it was confusing, since they looked exactly the same shredded up together. He told me that the one that I had liked was brisket. 

 SO, I order the brisket.  What do I get?  Sliced meat. It didn't look like anything from the photo i had shown or what I had eaten 2 days prior.  Not only did it look different, but It wasn't as juicy and didn't have the same texture. 
  I found out from the server that the brisket comes in two styles (shredded or sliced). It would have been nice for the guy that took the order to specify it for me if that's the case.  AND, I don't know how he can get it wrong after seeing a photo. 

  Not to mention, I ordered corn nuggets (cuz that's why i came back 2 days later) and when the server arrived at our table with our food, that was when I found out that they were out of corn nuggets. I had paid additional money for this side. So, I ask this guy how long it'll take to make them (because I was willing to wait for it) and the waiter told me ""several days.""   
  My friend went there 2 hours later, and told me there were plenty corn nuggets. WTH dude. I woulda seriously waited 2 hours for my corn nuggets. Or come back in 2 hours for it. But I was told several days, and I was leaving the next day. 

  When you're a vegas native and can access a restaurant any day, probably these things don't matter. But, when you're a visitor, a foodie, and you pick a restaurant out of all the choices available, it's disappointing when you don't get what you ordered. 

  Next time I go, I shall ask for SHREDDED BRISKET. It's SHREDDED BRISKET versus a BRISKET, y'all!",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,0,3,RBJaH69OrslWyKY7RDzSbw

Outside was super crispy, and inside was sweet and moist with little bits of corn kernels.  This item definitely sets this place apart from other BBQ places.

My wife and I ordered the trio meat combo with pulled brisket, 1/4 lb chicken, and hot links.  The brisket was juicy with a nice smoked flavor; chicken was tender and flavorful; and hot links were spicy with a nice snap to them.  I put some Carolina vinegar on the brisket which helped cut down some fat and added a refreshing flavor to the meat.  The house BBQ sauce was tasty although a bit watery so I mixed some of the habanero paste to thicken it up.  They tasted pretty good together.  The sweet BBQ sauce, which tasted like honey mustard, was also pretty good, and went well with the hot links.

Let's start with the fact they have all the their drinks outside. They even have Sweet Tea, which is dangerous, because it's all you can drink every visit! Yup I am number one fan of sweet tea... 
I like the fact that the menu is pretty easy to understand, but with all the yummy options I alway struggle on what to order, and when I finally decide what I want I usually always want something else. The good thing is when you go in a group or your family, you can sample everyone else's platter or sandwich!  So it's alway a win win win!
This particular visit I got the Pull Pork, and it was amazing, I love how moist and soft the texture was.  I definitely love the sauces you can Squeeze on them to amplify the flavor.
But the thing I LOVE the most about coming to this restaurant is the customer service, everyone is so sweet and helpful.  The last visit an associate by the name of Antonio, was super helpful and nice. I love the fact that he went out of his way to make sure everything was okay for me and my family, even when my son was having a moment because his food was touching the meat, Antonio went out of his way to grab him some Mac and cheese on the side without even asking us if that would help the situation, Antonio definitely made our visit a pleasant one!  High Five to Antonio for going out of his way to make me and my family's visit an awesome one!  We will definitely be back again and hopefully Antonio will be there to help make our experience awesome again! 

Due to the moment my son was having I didn't have time to take pictures, but I will definitely be back again, and I will grab some shots of how amazing the food looks",ciS2XOo391iRUR2DUmSEWw,6,1,5,48bcEhhFprI7pugPNhhpHw

Ok, its not in the best area of town and doesn't look like much from the outside, but when you walk in and smell that wonderful smoke and BBQ flavor you know your gonna love it! We of course had to try the Outlaw burger made with brisket and fried onion strings as well as the brisket and rib combo plate with corn fritters. The burger was HUGE and the brisket was so tender and delicious. One of the best burgers ever. The brisket and rib plate was also great. The ribs were probably some of the best I've ever had. They were so smoky and tender and the corn fritters were golden bites of goodness. 

Our friends ordered the BBQ nachos which were waffle fries loaded with BBQ pork, cheese, beans and sour cream. So good. 

I will definitely be back to try the hot links and baby backs. Thanks for a great meal!",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,2,1,4,k2r52wvP4zZnkj6rDTwSwA

Peach cobbler is so good, it'll make u slap ur momma!

Brisket is moist, juicy and melts in your mouth.

Fried Okra is the best in town hands down.

Catfish is properly seasoned, crispy on the outside and juicy and flaky on the inside.

So we walked in on a Saturday night at around 11 or so and we were the only ones in there. So I will admit, I wasn't sure if the reviews were going to be right. I mean if this place was going to be as good as everyone said, then why isn't this place packed?

But we sat down and the guy was friendly and down home. I love a southern gentleman, they win me over every time. He told me that they were out of the beef ribs but if I wanted to wait 45 minutes that they would be ready. So I didn't want to wait 45 minutes and went with a meat platter. I got the brisket and st Louis ribs and hot links. Already told you about the brisket, the ribs I enjoyed too. They were tender and smokey and very flavorful. If I am being honest, then I would probably pass on the hot link. I think they were just bbq'ed too long for me. 

So we got dessert with our yelp check in and I wasn't too sure that they would taste so good based on their appearance. We ordered banana pudding and peach cobbler. I would alone come for the peach cobbler but again, if I am being honest I would pass on the banana pudding.

I love BBQ. It is just always so hard to find a good decent eats for BBQ in this town. But the quest for me has ended here. I rave about this place to everyone. 

The BBQ sauce here is amazing too. Sweet and Spicy. I tried to see if they bottled it and sold it but they don't. So instead they gave me a to go container for free.

You order up at the counter and take a seat. They bring your food to you. The cashier was cool and even know how to say my name correctly. Respect given. 

Like any good BBQ joint, they better give you a good bang for your buck. I expect finger licking seasoned grilled meats and a slew of sides. They sure didn't disappoint. They sure know how to rub their meats!

Brisket: Seasoned perfectly. The best brisket in Vegas
Spare Ribs: Fall off the bone and flavorful
Chicken: Not dry and seasoned very well
Mashed potatoes: Buttered and smooth just the way I like it

5918780,2013-02-28,9,fL-b760btOaGa85OJ9ut3w,"Highland Dr and Industrial Rd are better known for their close proximity to the Las Vegas glittery night life, where even the least physically attractive individuals can lease the personal attention of barely clothed seductive sirens $20 at a time.  But thanks to Rollin' Smoke Barbeque, this same area will also be known for down to earth, simply delicious BBQ. 

On a recent weekday evening, a handful of coworkers decided to meet here post work to try some BBQ that Nelson Q has proudly put his 5 Yelp stars stamp of approval on. In typical fashion, I was the first to arrive.  The parking lot was empty except for 2 cars, all the other businesses were closed, and there was a guy in suits finishing his early dinner.

The restaurant itself is very low key. It housed nothing flashy in terms of decorations, except for a big boar's head mounted on one of the walls. The lobby/ordering counter is in a small room, but the main dining area is in the adjacent room. The seats are comfortable, and there is a TV for you to watch sports or highlights, while you wait for your order.

Most of us opted to try the Outlaw Burger. For $6.99 + tax, this burger is the size of two of my fists stacked on top of each other.  It is packed with a 1 lb patty (60% brisket and 40% ground beef) and cooks down to about 12 oz, served with Rollin' Smoke's homemade tangy BBQ sauce, the usual vegetable fixings and some (lettuce, tomato, fried onions, scallions, and cheese) which not only made it physically big but the flavors complimented each other and resulted in a mean serving of burger that I can easily recommend to anyone not opposed to eating pork and beef.  For $2, you get a drink and choice of one side (bacon potato salad would be a good pick), and make your order a combo.  Currently there is also a Yelp Check-In promotion, where you get a complimentary dessert with your order.

Rollin' Smoke BBQ, now my personal #1 one pound burger in LV.

Decor:  3/5  No frills hole in the wall restaurant. You are here because you want good BBQ, not design ideas for your Texas ranch.

Food:  4/5  Good BBQ made with passion and love.  They serve Blue Belle ice cream too (coworkers said it reminded them of the ice cream in the Philippines. I will take their words for it.)

Value:  4/5  Good for the wallet. I estimate that 65%+ of you will not be able to finish the Outlaw Burger, side + drink.

Location:  5/5  Not far at all if you are visiting the Strip.  The cabbies will probably know it too, if not, it is just down the street from Sapphire. 

Parking:  5/5  It is practically all for Rollin' Smoke BBQ customers.

Easily 4 stars!

P.S.  If you stop by during lunch, I heard this is where some of them sirens get their lunch/breakfast before/after work. So I've heard.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,17,13,4,7pBaJnPxTVbQ9o0EWI3JAg

But then again, I rarely find myself driving on Highland Drive, which mainly seems to be a business district with strip clubs. Anyway, I'll try to keep it short and sweet. 

This place is all about the sides, I absolutely love them! I secretly think they are even better than the meat, LOL! My favorites so far are:

Cheesy Mac N Cheese - very creamy cheese sauce, and they top it off with even more (shredded) cheese!
Corn Bread - always hot and fresh! I love how they put a good amount of butter on them and are not dry! 
Corn Nuggets - one of the employees suggested that we try this, and I'm glad we did. Creamy corn on the inside. Crispy goodness on the  outside. Great with ketchup, A MUST TRY!
Kicken Beans - I don't eat beans (unless they are soybeans), but my husband and friends have said that this was delicious. 

The one side I was not crazy about were the waffle fries. They were soggy and cold the one time I had ordered them. 

OK, OK, the meats are pretty good too. My husband and I shared The Pit Special and I did like the brisket and pulled pork. Both were juicy, tasty, and cooked perfectly. Their barbecue sauce is good, but a bit tangy. I still say it's all about the sides! :P The employees are very friendly. They walk about asking if you enjoy the food and if you are happy. Drinks, utensils, condiments and to go containers are all self-serve. 

Sometimes they can get crazy busy, where the line is out the door. You know what they say, the hole in the wall places are the best! I'm glad we found this spot, I think they have the best barbecue in town!",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,6,2,4,eFiJ-gRbHND5kCmyFv2bHw

It was a little difficult to find, but I had driven by Rollin Smoke while I was in the area on a previous occasion so knew generally where it was located. We had initially attempted to go to Peppermill, but the wait was longer than we were willing to eat, so I made the executive decision to try Rollin Smoke. It's in a pretty inconspicuous location, so keep your eyes peeled. 

The restaurant was much larger and nicer looking than I had expected. Roomy, with plenty of seating, even booths which I always prefer, and very clean. You order at the podium and they bring your food out to you. Since there was a free dessert with Yelp check-in offer, I took advantage of this and ordered the pulled piggy sandwich with jalapeno coleslaw and peach cobbler. Our food came out quickly and everything smelled and tasted great! The meat was pretty good. I'm no expert, but I enjoyed my pulled pork quite a bit. The coleslaw was spicy and tasted pretty good. The cobbler was great too, but I would ask for no whipped cream next time. My family all love their meals as well. Some of the sides were hit or miss, but some of our favorites were the corn nuggets and coleslaw. The mac n cheese was ok, but I'd have to order it again to see if I like it better next time. 

Their menu is quite extensive and they have so many great options that I look forward to exploring on our next visit. Overall, the experience was great and if they were in a more convenient location I could see myself coming here much more often. They have an all you can eat option for $25. I don't think I could handle it, but it seems like a pretty good deal. They also have family packs available for large parties, which is great.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,17,15,4,dLqZ0yu_zvmhsNPgmLRMKg

Loaded potato was a complete let down. First off you're gonna tell me that gross form of bright orange ""liquid cheese"" is better than actual grated cheddar? Nope. Then there's the skin - if you are a person who actually enjoys a crispy potato skin DO NOT - there is so much salt on the exterior it makes your tongue go a little numb. The brisket was maybe the sweet flavor that I got every few bites, but it's hard to tell b/c the minuscule crumbles they call brisket. 
The hubs ordered the 2 meat plate so I did get a fantastic bite of the pork but that could be b/c everything else was a total let down. The waffle fries were also the way to go, as the mac & cheese must be made with the same liquid as already mentioned. 
Lastly the canned peach cobbler was a joke, coming in at $7 for dried biscuit-ish bread in a swamp of overly sweet something.. and off brand ice cream.

Now it's expected that a barbeque establishment would have a number of sticky, somewhat dirty décor, but this place was at least a little bit more than that.  Very little cleaning up happens here and everything looked like a big hot mess.  

Service was decent, although a bit slow for a night that didn't have a lot going on.  They were starting to close up however so I wouldn't ding them too harshly for having a likely busier part of their day that they're recovering from.

As for the sides, and rest of what was offered.  The sweet tea was a letdown since it was sweetened tea, not sweet tea.  The sweet corn cornbread was decent, along with the mac & cheese and other items, but it didn't wow me.
