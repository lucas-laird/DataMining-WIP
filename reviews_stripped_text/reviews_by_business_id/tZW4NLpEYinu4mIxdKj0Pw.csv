The BLT was like one your mom would make you, tons of bacon and just delicious. BBQ pork fries were delicious and the grilled cheese burger was good as well. 

The rotel and homemade chips were AMAZING. Only negative and the reason I couldn't give a full 5 stars was they didn't fill the cup all the way on the rotel. 

Would order here again for sure. Amazing. Give it a try, you will be glad you did.",JHtJEs6jwxJSv3I8f7DvQw,2,0,4,9-T-2lBdU2EhM2_GLzv5fA

First they split the brat, then grilled it flat until it was totally dried out (who on earth does that to a beer brat?) and then made it even worse by serving it with a few peppers and onions on a dry old hotdog bun that had split totally apart. I can't adequately describe how incredibly horrible it was. The single  star is for the accompanying shoestring fries which were actually palatable.",hAJM1pxtGPRu2xQ1nkc_5Q,0,0,1,TEPLRsE3C3pSeMB-JUagVA

The Burger I got was called the ""killer burger."" it is a cheeseburger with LTO and instead of a bun it's stuck between two grilled cheese sandwiches. It's a lot of bread but it was very good and filling. The fries I got were well seasoned and flavorful as well. I will defiantly order from here again if I get the opportunity",-Ng6kNjzZee-hT-RZYg_Eg,0,0,4,AG7kfbPtW9SGUpDrTXGpiw
4736424,2017-09-04,0,tZW4NLpEYinu4mIxdKj0Pw,"This was my second time ordering here through postmates. I had a order of chicken fingers and a small pepperoni pizza. I couldn't enjoy the chicken fingers because they were a tad dry and the fries were blah. The pizza was very cheesy, which I love. I just wish they would've gave me a few more pepperonis. The pizza should've been cooked longer. Despite my rating, I would definitely come back and try new things on the menu.",yXRccPG1XvKQtO9AGQYUnA,0,0,2,Cu204NYrUSjR2Kbsmz3mFw
5256235,2018-06-19,0,tZW4NLpEYinu4mIxdKj0Pw,This place is by far the worst I've ever had delivered to me. My pizza is the worst ever. Way to show your customer you don't give 2 shits about them. I most definitely will never come or order from here ever again!,W6WlxdWfp5uIsF_8OtjE7w,0,0,1,osp0PVLVIACTQqxqBhCtvg
5485441,2018-01-21,0,tZW4NLpEYinu4mIxdKj0Pw,The food was trash. My boyfriend is upset he wasted his money. The pizza tasted worse than school pizza. The fries were barely warm. It was just over all bad and I wish I could put 0 stars because that's what it was.,Yqc9Q1bYy1nkK61-9fqIFA,0,0,1,Tj6kGz7NN1_jGJe09jQm_w
