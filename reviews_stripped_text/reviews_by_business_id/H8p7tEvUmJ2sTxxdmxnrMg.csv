overall, i probably won't be back just because i probably will not return to palace station, but if i am at palace station, ill probably stop by again",yG00-Dcv5iFS2SaezGu-Kw,0,0,4,0ziohTthuSsL_a6gtYwMnQ

2497499,2011-12-19,0,H8p7tEvUmJ2sTxxdmxnrMg,"Great place to go for happy hour specials. Cabo serves up a great happy hour menu from 4-6 pm seven days a week. My favorite item is the 12oz bud draft for 99 cents. They have bud light, lime or wheat as well. I prefer a craft beer most of the time but for the price, it's a good deal and I like beer, period. They have a pretty extensive hh menu, most of which I haven't tried. The shrimp cocktail is decent and has been voted ""Best of Las Vegas"" in recent years. That doesn't hold much water for me personally, but to each her own. They offer ceviche, cheese quesadilla, beef taco, bean tostada and an 8oz mojito all for 99 cents. They have about six items for $2.99 and $3.99 too. I can't vouch for any of these offerings as I usually drink the bud and then order off the regular menu.

The last two times I've been here, Dena has served me. She is great at her job! Always friendly and quick with a smile. We can be pretty demanding at times and Dena takes it all in stride. She takes notes, which I dig because I almost never order a meal straight from the menu. I usually add or subtract items and I always want something on the side. The food usually comes out to my specifications and when it doesn't, she is quick to please and remedy the situation. 

I don't recommend driving across town to frequent this location but if you find yourself in the vicinity it's a pretty good stop. Standard ""Vegas Mexican"" food and rock bottom happy hour prices. Ya dig?",u9w4LOoKYsM00Scb0HCH1w,0,0,3,7uFo5eJtuWKTXNqvDd4Kqg

There was no line when hubby and I arrived, but we still stood there waiting for about 10 minutes before someone noticed us. I would have wondered if they were even open, but I called prior to see if they had a wait and any specials going and the girl who answered the phone said to come on down. Then once we were seated it took another 10 minutes to have chips, salsa, bean dip and drinks brought to out table. It would have been nice if we were acknowledged sooner.

We ordered ""Chili Con Queso"" priced at $5.99 to start. This is the one thing here that is still consistently good. It has a blend of cheeses with onions, tomatoes, serrano chilies and comes with tortilla chips. For the price it is a great deal and goes a long way. I had the AYCE ""Crispy Tacos"" for my meal priced at $8.99 that included beans and rice. The beans were cracked on top and hard. The rice was so dry and flavorless. My tacos (chicken and ground beef) had a terrible flavor and the bottoms of the taco shells were so greasy and soggy that when I picked up my first taco the bottom fell out. I would have asked for new tacos, but the place was packed and I only saw 2 servers and one person clearing tables, so flagging someone down wasn't easy. I had honesty gotten my fill with the chips, salsa, bean dip (it wasn't cracked and hard like the beans on my plate) and chili con queso anyway and didn't want to wait any longer than we had been waiting during our experience already.

Our server was nice (what I saw of him) and I could tell he was really trying, but with very little staff on hand he could only do so much.

Prices were alright. Typical. My albondigas soup was $5.99...and it was a pretty big bowl. I ordered a shimp tacos combination plate and it was $11.99 i think.

I want to put in a good word for their bar at the Palace Station.
They have an excellent happy hour.
Oh yes .... the usual 4 -6 PM happy hour.
But what sets them apart is the quality of the Margarita's you get for $4.00.
They call them Perfecto Margarita's....

Beautiful glasses holding a generous amount of quality tequila.
They prepared Blackberry for me and they were just supurb.

On another occasion, we went to the bar later in the evening (11ish or so) and we sat at the bar and while waiting for our drinks we played the video poker.

It doesn't feel like your typical Mexican restaurant inside- it feels very contemporary. The staff doesn't wear traditional costumes, either.  

This was part one (lunch) of my double-header in-law birthday celebration a couple weekends ago on a saturday afternoon (my husband's parents have birthdays on consecutive days). My MIL had a restaurant.com certificate so we wanted to try this place too. The last few birthdays were spent at a Mexican restaurant too BTW. Anyway, service was on the slow side. It wasn't even crowded; there were a few other parties besides us, but it was far from being busy. 

The salsa and chips were really good. I like the spicy one and mixed some bean dip in one bowl with it, when the server brought us more. My husband got the chicken fajita burrito (came with rice and beans), I got the sampler (I couldn't really make up my mind so I chose something with lots of choices- beef nachos, cheese dip, cheese quesadillas, 4 taquitos, and 4 chicken wings), my MIL's husband got the taco combo plate (also came with rice and beans), and my MIL got the beef fajitas. My husband's burrito was so big that he only ate half! It kinda looked like a football. My nachos were good, but because I had chips and salsa, I did not finish it. The taquitos were really good, but then again, I love cilantro (hubby's not a fan). The cheese dip was in a good sized bowl- my husband liked it alot, and I gave half to my MIL to take home. The quesadillas were good, but it's hard to mess up something kinda basic. The chicken wings I didn't touch but offered it up to my husband and MIL, who then said it didn't have too much flavor and was heavily battered (I try not to eat chicken wings these days.) 
My MIL's beef fajitas were really good- the beef was so buttery soft, that I might order that the next time we go here (this is saying something since I'm not huge on red meat, I'll eat it if it's there, but I don't have to have it; I eat chicken on most days). My MIL's husband finished his tacos. We were all full but we indulged in fried ice cream afterward (what's a birthday without dessert?).

So basically my high marks are based on the salsa, and food overall at reasonable prices, since the service could've been better, considering there were just a few other parties besides us. He checked on us once during the whole meal. And we might check it out again if we have a certificate.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,1,0,4,_ezNo0iEk46_V91btYsVWw

 Admittedly, we got there a little bit late (about an hour before close), but does that mean that we're not entitled to good service? Our server Jim seemed to think so. 

Jim stumbled to the table conspicuously inebriated and probably more than 3 sheets to the wind (I think he probably had his whole linen closet blowing in his boozy breeze).  However, the Cadillac  margaritas that we ordered WEAK! Perhaps it's because Jim had sucked all the alcohol off of the top before he served them to us. When I personally brought them back to the bartender for a redo (Jim was nowhere to be found),  the bartender really had no interest in doing anything other than cleaning up the bar so he could get home.

We spoke to the manager about honoring the AYCE deal that was listed on Yelp, however he said the promotion had expired and that only the I.T. guy was responsible for internet promotions. I guess you can't expect much from the MANGER or anything like that, right? This man was built like a Sprinter Van, and if Jim was drinking all the restaurant's profits, the manager had obviously been offered his paycheck in the form of burritos and tacos and enchiladas...which he GLADLY accepted. He still refused to honor Yelp deal, so we opted for the fajitas for two special that was going on at the time. 

Here's the good news. Jim left before he was done serving us (we saw him later in the pub getting cozy with a cold one at the bar), so Lucy took over. She was amazing and attentive, but sadly it was the end of our meal, so we didn't get to experience the extent of her awesomeness. Another busser named Do also seemed genuinely happy to be doing his job, too! He was also quite helpful.

The food was mediocre, but I do love that they bring a tasty bean dip to the table. I probably will come back to another of the Stations Casinos Cabos, but definitely not Palace Station.  

I had more fun at karaoke at  Jack's Irish pub that night. Singing Tina Turner songs made me feel better!",wDc4RxHpfwB49EpNZu1jfg,1,0,2,PQjuSZ-10yiwqaCRDLN_Ag

We were sat by hostess, a guy (not our server) brought chips n salsa. Waitress finally came by took drink order. We asked for two ice waters. We got to bottom of chips and still no water. I seen the manager (blonde) walking around greeting guests. I got up and asked her for the waters. She aplogised and said she would be right over with the waters. Never happened. Finally our waitress came over and was like oh I forgot your drinks, What did you order? We finally got our water after 20 mins. Then she came back and took our order. When we got our food a different waiter brought it out our food and it was great!! Then we didn't see our waitress for another period of time. When we finally did see her again she was hanging out with the manager chatting. I had to go up and ask for our check. So twice I had to get up and ask for something. I will be back I love the food and I'm hoping this was an one time thing on the bad service. But if this was my first experience with the restaurant I probably wouldn't be back.

We looked at what was offered in the Casino.  Cabo had a special of a create your own combo meal for $8.99.  It looked pretty good, so we thought we would give it a try.
First thing they bring you out complimentary Warm Chips and then some warm refried bean dip and 3 freshly made salsas.  A spicey roasted tomatoe, regular tomatoe and a green tomatillo.  The refried bean dip was warm and tasty and the other 3 seemed to be made very fresh.  My favorite was the Roasted, which had about MEDIUM HEAT.
I asked how the Chili Relleno was and the waitress said that they are made fresh with a roasted chili that is then stuffed with cheese, rolled in flour and then fried.  I also ordered a steak carbaron(sp?) taco which was like a street style taco on a small corn tortilla with fresh onion and cilantro.  The combo also came with Rice and Beans.
My wife had the Chili relleno and a pork tomale.

Lets just say, that based on the Chips and Salsa were very good and the rest of the food was even better.  Any who ventures to try a Chili relleno knows that they can be met with mixed results.  I had one one time that I swear was a Egg Omlet with Diced Green Chili's.  The one here was VERY, VERY good and had great taste.  Everything had great taste, even the black beans and the rice.

My expectations were not very high and had I looked at these YELP reviews prior to going, I'm sure I would have NOT GONE, but we were Oh so glad we did.
If you are in the neighborhood or staying at the Palace station, I would highly recomend Cabo!  It was Muy Bien!!!!",GTVvT2oRgj6Cwr_NidAZZw,0,0,4,SW1ZsAANpunEFVCpUd8xOQ

Only 3 dollars cheaper with the cars but oh well. Had to buy a drink with the deal. Margaritas were below average.  Small glass   Tons of ice.. Not strong at all.   We asked for salt on my glass and i got sugar. She wanted sugar and got salt.  Wouldn't have been a big deal if we had gotten the same flavor.. Food was food tho.   Bean dip comes with chips and salsa complimentary . I wanna try all you can eat tacos,S_BD0m7gsYAHqBDqOK5EEA,0,0,3,ax1fgjZTzerRdWNvs5L_bA

Sooo apparently their servers can't serve two tables each? No wonder this place is always empty!!!

My friends and I tried their all you can eat tacos for only $7.99.  You get your choice of ground beef, shredded beef or shredded chicken.  On your first plate you get 3 tacos, side of rice and choice of either black beans or re-fried beans. There's also lettuce, tomato and cheese on the side so you can make your taco however you like. I ordered the shredded beef and it was surprisingly good and pretty juicy.  

The meat is pilled on high so the three tacos are pretty filling. But if that's not enough for feel free to order more tacos since it is ALL YOU CAN EAT.  The tacos will come two at a time and the rice and beans are given upon request. 

Chips are also served along with a bean dip and 2 different types of salsa.  The Cabo Mexican Restaurant is a solid deal!",QMo7BDncb54YJVKeRHx6zA,1,0,3,wm_kpdBS55KMJu8aSQVbDQ

After much complaining and receipt presentation I managed to get a meal comped..which would be the only reason I would ever set foot back into this place.",KVbMZV-XJPSH9wXEwuXIaA,2,1,1,PFYG5F9sKeduAsvXR0OWcg
