64190,2016-07-29,1,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,Yes it's in a gas station. Don't let that deter you just take it to go. You might see the closed clock sign or maybe no register during business hours. Don't let that stop you either. Chances are the wife is not around but the guy is still there haha. If you like jerk chicken then you must try this place! Never heard of a jerk chicken spot serving coleslaw before but just ask for plantains instead and gravy on the rice and peas and you'll be good. Nicely seasoned and spicy like jerk chicken should be. Support small business so I don't have to go without jerk chicken again!,WptCfZ_h6pdnkBJx4ha8Aw,5,1,5,JmJjRdC1sfwWv7sOGQl5CQ
407917,2016-06-25,0,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,I just ate there with me and my family and we had the oxtail and the jerk chicken and I have to say it was delicious . plus the customer service was great and all the people was friendly and nice.

653318,2016-07-12,0,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,Legit! Small unassuming kitchen in a gas station. Gave me flashbacks of MoBay.. great authentic flavors and just the right amount of spice.,o5hZLSgek20FFV0-aHY6TA,2,3,5,w5a32BezR-xJMpJF1odq_g

1791512,2016-09-01,1,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,Well I went to this business an hour and a half before closing. The guy was sitting there and I said I'd like to order the jerk chicken wings and he says we're all out. So I said well what do you have we are all out of everything. So I told him you might as well close. I will not waste my time going there again.,UKFgwgNM1a7Gmr0UIGPzpw,3,1,1,_mUqjw3cpTXPnw4myQWfMg
1942124,2016-10-05,10,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,"Despite all the cuisines represented in Vegas, I have yet to find a go-to spot for Jamaican food. I pretty much have to wait til I go out of town to get my fix for goat curry, oxtails, or jerk chicken. Needless to say I was thrilled to hear about Jamaican Spice- even their gas station location couldn't deter me, and I was happy to support them so they could eventually move to a stand alone restaurant if the food was up to par. 

But after two trips out of my way, I have yet to find them open. I have no idea where the Yelp hours are from, because there are no posted hours at their counter. The space is bare but for a Jamaican flag and doesn't even look open. At one point, I visited at 5:30PM to a sign saying they'd be back at 2:30- no clue how that works, did someone forget to come back from break after the lunch rush? Are they returning at 2:30AM? Does this business even exist? I have no idea. Even the cashier in the gas station said he had no idea what was going on with this place.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,9,2,Tc5PB7EzImvPGB4fEtQj2w
2019616,2016-07-09,5,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,"So 3 stars for a restaurant in a gas station?  Have you lost your mind peas?

Look go eat there, if you know Jamaican food made by Jamaicans you will give it 3 stars too.  I was so good  I had to call them up and tell them so.

Nose sweating tasty jerk with rice and peas ( Jamaican for red beans and rice) you need to try this place out.

Next time it's oxtails for me. And sometimes I heard they  have brown stew.  Ask when your there. Any way...


Revised to 3 stars other visits didn't hold up",neMVTHC6x9zSA45wqRfdyg,9,1,3,6OG0qVtFQdSXPtmN_wucIA

The gas station has always stated they don't know why they aren't open but, they should be....",kf1RTN-xQBEnQcWkXuY-JQ,1,1,1,5BgGcLk0NrlmocoWtf-Lqw
2913134,2016-10-06,0,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,"I was excited to see a Jamaican place kinda close to where I live. Since there aren't many Caribbean restaurants in the Valley was hoping that this was going to be great. Surprised to see so many things out of stock on a Friday afternoon. But I was hungry so I ordered Jerk chicken over rice. It was ok, not too spicy but overall just meh. 
Hoping this was a fluke, but don't know that I want to spend the cash to try it again.",YSpEWPRBiugwoTaEdMaP2Q,0,1,2,kH53a1H4JvuAh71uOCI0MQ
3284757,2016-07-20,0,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,"Good customer service, waited awhile but I believe that's because I got there just as they opened so had to wait for em to finish up. Overall the food was worth the wait. I can only speak for the rice&pease with oxtail, I'll try the other dishes and update as soon as I do. It's not your traditional restaurant its a little in the cut located inside of a gas station.",0bMu8Pf4xQpoeSTvR9RdNQ,0,0,4,RYQ_i9uFCchceKX7DwGWew

Tastes great.
Lovely server.
Tastes just like the restaurants in NYC!

4487600,2016-07-02,0,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,My husband sent me here for some curry goat and when I got there the place was so clean and the owners so nice - I also ordered the check chicken wings. This is some of the best cooked jerk chicken and curry goat we have eaten. This restaurant is definitely a hidden gem that I can recommend!!!!,oQ1-epEL9THRefXyXhq_zw,0,2,5,2FtK4QKbxUGnl41hJauCDQ
4488312,2016-08-29,0,wCtU6XrWlz_BVPESKvIekQ,Drove from Southeast end of town (about 30 mins) and during their business hours they weren't even open!!! Kitchen looked as if it hasn't been touched or cooked in for weeks! My boyfriend & I have been looking for some good Jamaican food in town. No luck yet. Highly disappointed.,yg_RyJjOCpKt1GvO1mU5NQ,1,0,1,V7xnP9f51Biwokq0Z6KVRw
