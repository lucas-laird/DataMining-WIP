I was there at their grand opening with my family and I just wanted to leave after I sampled some of the food they have. This Chinese restaurant represents one of the worst on my list. I'm Chinese and I cook myself, so I know more than a thing or two about what has passed through my taste buds. Krazy buffett is a disgrace to the Chinese food, it's anything but Chinese. Why the one star? Well, my 13 year old daughter threw up soon after we went home and I was quite sure it's because of the food poisoning! I won't eat there even if they pay me.",EpmG5DFs9cJYA9g6f8kQfA,1,0,1,OrfpHon2C4TULk2vLoMFnw

108843,2011-07-29,0,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"This place is Krazy. It was unexpectedly very good. It could just be my expectations were low to begin with, so even average food exceeded my expectations.  I've driven past it dozens of times but never considered trying it because of the name. That is until one day I was craving crab legs and searched Yelp for a decent seafood buffet. Krazy Buffet popped up and I figured for a fraction of the price of a casino buffet, I'd give it a try. I was nervous about eating here (I mean, what can you really expect from a place that misspelled crazy?) But I was surprised at how good it turned out to be.

First I should mention they only have crab legs for dinner which starts at 4pm. If you paid for lunch and stay around for the crab they will charge you extra. At least that's what the sign says.

Anyway, the crab legs were just ok. I don't know if they were frozen or pre-cooked, but the texture seemed a bit squishy to me. But hey, it was still worth it because it's crab! We ate so much crab I think they were happy to see us leave.

The selection of other items was pretty good. It's what you would typically expect from a Chinese buffet. The items that stood out to me were the large steamed shrimp with shell on (a bit bland but very fresh), clams, meatballs, tiramisu, and strawberries.

Service was great. Everyone was so friendly, they kept our drinks full and our table clear. Obviously a buffet is self serve but the employees here are much more pleasant than some expensive high end restaurants I've been to. I'd recommend it for a cheap meal.",BCjrY4emoG1yyjhO17WdWg,0,0,4,jgm1y4Jj-qklxRNRF1ZBLA

Our waitress Nicole was nice.  I'm finding hard to write anything else. Unfortunately, the best item was the soft serve. The crab legs were super budget and only had a tiny bit of meat in it, the oysters and shrimp were ""water logged"". The choice and servings of ""sushi"" were so miniscule that it doesn't even count. Some things looked really good, but the flavors just weren't there. The chow mein was more like brown spaghetti. Several choices (actually too many)of items that starred imitation crab. The salt & pepper squid was ok. I meant to try the Broccoli Beef, but forgot. The seabass was tough and chewy.

197210,2010-12-28,0,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"My mom wanted to come here yesterday for lunch since she had received a $30 gift certificate from one of her friend's for Christmas. At first my sisters and I were all apprehensive since we're very picky about buffets. My dad has owned and operated several buffets in his lifetime and we have all worked in one or more of his restaurants in the past. My mom said she likes this place because it looks very clean. She said although they don't boast the biggest selection its cleanliness outweighs this by far. 

I ended up eating only one plate since that's what always happens to me at buffets. I can never seem to pig out or stuff my face. I tried many different things but this time I was pretty conscious of what I put on my plate. I didn't want to get a lot of stuff and end up wasting half of it so I got a little bit of the things that did seem appetitive to me at the moment. I got random things such as the Blue Fin Shark (my sister said her portion tasted sour, don't know how that could have happened), a very plump chicken wing, a big dollop of Chocolate Pudding, a big plate of clams, Coconut Chicken (very similar to Walnut Shrimp, which they don't serve), a cucumber and tomato mix, seabass, sauteed spinach, two pieces of two different rolls, etc. All-in-all everything wasn't bad and I liked the fact that they offered multiple types of fish and seafood in general. FYI, they serve raw oysters for dinner. They also serve some Chinese buffet staples such as egg drop soup, hot & sour soup, lo mein and sweet & sour chicken along with fresh fruit and various desserts.

The place was pretty packed when we were here and there seemed to be a constant trickle of customers coming through the doors. We ate pretty quickly since we wanted to get our shop on at Stein Mart, which is conveniently located in the same strip mall. The total came out to be $33 something for the four of us.

The soft serve ice cream was more water based and icy than it was creamy. I know my dad's soft serve ice cream spat out ice based ice cream too so I can conclude now with certainty that Mc Donald's soft serve ice cream is the best. The ones offered at buffets can never and will never measure up. So in other words don't get your hopes up on one of these soft serve machines.",e7YqL66GjjTnKH3r0Na9IA,0,0,3,PTC8ZCCjH948O8g_0ZEqbg

This place is called Krazy for a reason, lots of people were here on the Sunday afternoon we came. The crab legs were piled on plates quicker than they could get out on the buffet line. I'm sad I didn't get to sample these suckers as people piled them on their plate like there was no tomorrow.

Overall the food on the line was pretty good and exceeded my expectations. I ate so much that day that I can't remember what was the best thing on there, I just know that I was completely satisfied afterwards.

The waitresses are very pushy when it comes time to pay the bill. They slip you the check in the right middle of your meal and expect you to pay up immediately (at least make you feel that way since they seem to hover near/around your table taking short glances to see if you have placed the payment). While that part is sort of annoying, the last straw was when the waitress started demanding her tip. Not to bring race into it but it is usually the restaurants with Asian decent that seem to believe that tip is mandatory. (Note: I am Asian myself relax). My suggestion for improvement is to take the payment in full as you enter, or when you leave. It feels rude when your meal is interrupted for payment.

Unlike most other buffets, drinks are not included in the initial price. And you pay your bill at the end of your meal, not before. But service is pretty good - dirty/empty dishes are quickly whisked away and drinks are promptly re-filled.

As for the food, there are a few standouts. The wontons were excellent, and almost tasted homemade. Most of the food were full of oil, but it's to be expected at a buffet. Soups were mostly forgettable though.

Dessert and fruit section were pretty vast. The fruits here actually looked and tasted fresh. And there's your standard chinese buffet desserts like soft serve ice cream, almond cookies, macaroons, cake, etc.

Take this last visit, for instance. Random women's hockey game (go SF Sirens!) and the family love of buffets. Thankfully we ended up at a non-strip buffet (those are nice, but a bit much for just regular eats).

Krazy Buffet--with a name like that, I was instantly sorry I forgot my camera and phone. But the food proved to be decent, fresh (lotsa ppl = plenty of turnover on the food), and sucha deal! At $7 for lunch (less for the folks, since they're on the AARP train), we were able to nab the bill and look like good kids, without much strain on the wallet.

Of course it's not the best quality Chinese food, it is a BUFFET. One thing that's been really bugging me about Yelp lately is how so many people compare buffet food to restaurant food, which just isn't fair as buffets work on a totally different level. /Ramble.
Anyways, the Krazy Buffet is definitely one of the better Chinese buffets. I loved the spot Penda's on Spring Mountain@Rainbow (It closed recently. R.I.P.), but that was pretty much hangover/stoner food, and I'm still upset over the $11.00 I wasted at New China. Krazy Buffet on the other hand is always fresh and good quality. There's quite a bit more seafood than usual to be found here, however, the seafood items are ironically the least fresh of all the offerings in the buffet. The sushi ain't half bad though. 
The service is decent enough, my drink was never empty. 
They also offer french fries and garlic bread. That gave me some interesting ideas to say the least, since Chinese food is something I love to improvise with.

Lunch prices went until 4, although note lunch does not include crab. Took about 13 min from Red Rock Canyon.

Overall, very impressed with the food and service given the very reasonable prices. The food is what you would typically expect at a Chinese buffet. A lot of Chinese dishes, soups, sushi bar, some American items such as pizza, salad/fruit bar, dessert and soft serve ice cream. Note that this place did not have the Mongolian BBQ station that some Chinese buffet places have.

Sushi selection is large- about 8 different rolls with at least one vegetarian and one fried option, but most are variations of Philadelphia and California rolls. Primary fish used are crab and spicy tuna, lots of avocado in use here but in one roll it had more of a guacamole flavor to it. Not the best quality fish, but large selection for a price under what you'd usually spend on a single roll at an actual sushi restaurant.

Soups are fresh, won ton was good but broth was a bit too oily for my liking. Fish used in cooked dishes (baked salmon, grilled seabass, seafood delight) was underseasoned and over cooked.

Other items were decent: salad bar and dessert area had the usual choices, plus an octopus salad that had way too much jalapeno for my liking. Chicken wings were fried but tasted fresh. Chinese options weren't overly Americanized or greasy: beef and broccoli, a sad-looking lo mein, several tofu options.

In my seemingly never-ending quest for a high-quality, non-casino, AYCE Chinese buffet somewhere in the Valley, I drifted in here while on West Sahara on business with one of my jewelers. 

This is pretty bland food-as-fuel, nothing more. 

The waitress was polite and her service was adequately attentive.

The buffet offered an entire steamer-station full of just seafood choices. For-real, not-imitation, crab legs was the clear draw, but there were various other, somewhat odd, choices such as stuffed mussels. I avoided all of that, until the venue 'earned my trust,' so to speak. Except I did slightly sample the salt&pepper calamari. Meh.

And while there were a lot of choices, the buffet seemed somewhat light on the traditional entrees one might expect to find in such a place. You know, the usual suspects: Beef w/ Broccoli, Kung Pao chicken, et. al. Just not many of those guys in the house.

So, in the end, I stuck close to the soups, the teriyaki chicken-on-the-really-pointy-stick, the crab Rangoon, egg rolls, lo mein noodles and such. Removing the dried-up, baked-on chicken from the stick was dangerous enough to be a mission for Special Forces. There wasn't a single item I could describe as desirable enough to want to return. 

Again, in a word, bland.

And I wasn't entirely surprised that my tummy was somewhat queasy for at least a couple of days afterwards. And every time it groaned, I heard it saying 'sayonara' to this joint for sure.

I shouda guessed. I suppose I was KRAZY to go in there in the first place. The quest continues.",Lb-W21R8P4AdQyljVxY21Q,1,1,2,pSQDRZ_tyuJ_BkRtVkvqQw

However, if everything is fried which I understand is a simple effective way of cooking about-to-expire seafood and meat, please dear god change out the oil once in a while. Every single thing tasted like shrimp. I put my fork down, praying for everyone around me to be done. They must have been going insane from the heat outside, for they were loving every morsel of food even pirates might turn down on a deserted island. When desert was acquired what seemed like days later, I was not so pleasantly surprised to find the fried puff pastries and assorted fried deserts all tastes like shrimp! They really need to get up to par with the changing of the oil weekly, plus frying different foods in different friers. Not to mention I was extremely sick the rest of the day. Simply creating a schedule of maintenance and temp logs would alleviate many of their problems. Sheer laziness is not excuse to hawk crappy food and call it a buffet.",w8zIDmVgAFs7xtsN88cQIg,2,0,1,Nk6Xp4EKjPP4mzvwg5fDSA

BUT it is patronized by many (not by Chinese) for their seafood selections like crab legs, oysters, mussels, clams, etc. The dessert section has a very few selections though but with a full stomach, I doubt if you still have a room to spare for that.

This Asian style buffet in my opinion is better than others such as Asia buffet. They have a bigger variety of food, they have shrimp cocktail and oysters, sushi, and a nice blend of meats and vegetable options. A pretty decent place for a cheap dinner.

UPDATE: Wrote this review right after I ate here... it is the next day and my brother threw up all night and I had bathroom issues all night.

I would say the earlier you get here, the better. When I went at 8pm, the food was not being turned over as there were not many diners.

2185409,2017-04-30,0,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"Just a brief review of one of my local and often enjoyment resturaunts. 

The location is by no means subtle, easy to find, and the crowd varies depending on the days. Weekdays are a prime time since it's relatively calm, and the food is definitely abundant. Speaking about the food (Obviously?) It's absolutely phenomenal for the price you are paying, drink prices aside.

That was the good, now to the bad.

The food can often be, well very underdone. Given the price you pay, I wouldn't expect much further than that. The crab legs are really where it's at, so that's definitely where the value comes in to play. It's often a hit or miss, the crab can often smell rotten or somewhat decayed, given the obvious smell of ammonia, which is very strong at times. 

Unfortunately i did once receive a horrible case of food poisoning several hours after, which out me out of work for 3 days, and all I had was the crab legs then entire duration of my visit. That being said, I'd take care in cracking open that delicious crabmeat, by inspecting and smelling the meat prior to consuming.

On a other note, I'd stayaway from the Nigiri.

I was surprised by how many different dishes were offered. Let's just say, even though the quality wasn't AMAZING, I wasn't upset about it for the price I was paying for my meal. 

SERVICE: 3/5 
The service was pretty good here. They refilled waters as needed and came to check in on our large group (we had about nine people in total). However, I sometimes felt rushed by certain servers. The service wasn't outstanding, but it wasn't bad. I think they served us well overall. They also didn't charge us an automatic gratuity, which was surprising because it seems so customary now-a-days. 

AMBIANCE: 2.5/5 
The ambiance is fine. It is pretty mediocre and doesn't really add or negate from the dining experience as a whole. I wasn't super impressed with it overall, but it was good. I didn't think the place was extremely tidy or clean-feeling, but I still liked it. 

PRICE: 4/5 
For about $13.99 per person, there was a good variety of food to choose from. I can't complain. They are also running coupons in the newspapers and such in the area, so you can always use those!

most places that serve wonton soup is going to have a ton of msg in it. i used to eat this broth the street vendors in korea would sell. they would boil the fish cakes in the broth. i asked the lady what made it so savory. she said MSG. the wonton tastes the same.

My boyfriend wasn't feeling that well after we ate here last night, but just brushed it off since some places we go, the food quickly moves through him. I however felt fine for a few hours until I was about to go to bed and the pain started. I don't know if it was food poisoning or what, but it was bad. Maybe this was just a one time thing, I don't know, but I'm not really wanting to find out. 

Breakdown of the restaurant (aside from me getting sick). The place isn't very big, but the have a decent selection of food items. The desserts could use a little work tho. There isn't anything that is that great to choose from. They have a lot of seafood items which is why I wanted to try the place because that's usually most of what I get. For $15, you can't really beat the price to get crab legs, shrimp, claims, mussels, crawfish, etc. The staff was very attentive and picked up our plates and refilled our drinks quickly.

I came here on a weekday lunch with my coworkers. The manager or one of the male hosts greeted us right away and we were seated immediately. 

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety and selection. They had four soups-egg flower, hot n sour, miso, and wonton. They also had a sushi station. I rarely get sushi that's been sitting out from a buffet so I can't comment on the quality and taste. There was also a salad and dessert bar and of course lots of Chinese food.

There's no way one can try everything here in one sitting. Out of the foods I tried, I liked the steamed clams in some delicious sauce (no idea what's in it but it's good), seabass, chicken wings, and coconut chicken in a creamy sauce. I didn't try the salad bar because I went for the main courses. Their dessert selection is alright. I grabbed a cream puff, chocolate mousse, and soft serve ice cream. Our waters were filled and plates cleared so no problems with service.

This is a steal for $8.79 to satisfy your cheap Chinese food cravings. There's a 10% off coupon on their website but I was embarrassed to use it because my coworker made fun of my coworker for using it last time so I didn't. LOL.",TS4RfxKny-c8QYcnMpfkiQ,5,7,4,obmFwh0oKQ1TOk4Yz6bqRA

The sushi was bad and I did not even want to try their pizza. 
I will not say the name of the place but there is another Chinese buffet on Rainbow, a few blocks from Krazy buffet and it is ten times better. The only reason why I went here is because my date insisted on it because her friend recommended it. When I took her to that spot she immediately noticed the night and day differences.

Crab legs, tasteless, same with the shrimp unless you get one of the salt and pepper shrimp or crab which do have taste but none of the original food, just of salt and pepper.

At half the price of the better buffets in town this place will attract those who want a lot of food cheaply but do not go expecting any subtle tastes or anything that will make you take notice, but they do have a lot to offer as far as variety.

 I've come to the conclusion that ALOT of these type Buffets are basically serving the same dishes and what stands out is the things that they offer that the others dont.

I arrived late for lunch around 3pm and even at that late hr the place was active with people -a good sign. The place was well lit and I was offered a nice comfortable booth where I could spread out my paper and read. I even lucked out and was sitting across from a crying baby!! lol

 As I said, they are basically serving the same thing as other places with the difference here being Sweet Potato French Fries, fresh breaded shrimp & Fish with cocktail & tartar sauce available. They also had peeled shrimp on ice as well as whole fried shrimp and grilled shark. Also ""coconut chicken"" was offered but the chicken was more breading than substinance but the sauce was very good, they even have a fresh sushi station with several types of rolls available.

The desert station was pretty pedestrian with no standouts at all other than the small coconut cake squares they were offering were dry and stale which is nbd as I really wasnt there for desert.

I also got to see them putting out the dinner items such as the snow crab legs and while thin, they looked good.

 Overall I'd have to say try this place because you cant go wrong. Of the 3 places on Sahara I still rate Buffet @ Asia #1, followed by this place and Pacific Buffet at #3.",pFnRSBFyU7IEF-9Z-UHP7A,2,3,4,HX0NeFh__EBqT5RjggzTzA

They have a decent selection of Chinese goodies and other asian flavors. 

I ended up with a plate stacked with cream cheese wontons and gyoza...Somehow it seemed like the right thing to do. They were so crispy and gushing with cream cheese goodness. So bad yet sooo sooo good! They make them very good here. 

Plus their sweet and sour sauce and gyoza sauce sealed the deal! I'm a saucy girl, and I dunked my gyoza and wontons like there was no tomorrow. Super yummy! 

They had oysters on a half shell that were cleanly shucked, tasted sweet, and didn't get us sick after eating... That's a huge plus in the books! 

The crab legs and butter with lemon was a hit for me! (Only served at dinner) 

The vanilla soft serve was creamy, sweet and a perfect ender to the gorge fest!

We originally went here for the AYCE crab legs, but the crabs are a joke.  They're basically the crab shell and if you're lucky you will get a little crab meat if you search inside.  The rest of the food available in the buffet was nothing to talk about.

There are TWO main reasons we will NEVER EVER EVER go back here!

1)  There was a long, black hair found in my friend's house steak.  Neither of us have black hair, so obviously couldn't have been ours after we received our plates.  My friend was a little more compassionate to this, since she does work with food as well and we do have to consider it's a buffet with lots of people hovering over food throughout our visit, but still.

2)  After we found the hair in her food, she told the server about it.  His response was 'Ok.'  That was it!  Not an 'I'm sorry,' or 'Let me take the food away for you.'  This is what made the experience worse than the food.  The service is AWFUL.  Worst server I've ever had.  Even when he took our plates away before it seems like he was annoyed he even had to do his job and was rushing us to get out of there, which after we found the hair I didn't mind doing just that.

At the cashier, my friend complained about the hair in her food and the cashier was a little more apologetic for it and offered her a $3 discount.  I didn't get a discount at all.  I guess we were better off taking what we could get and getting out of there and never looking back!!

If you're looking for a good buffet with crab legs, don't waste your time here.  Pay the little bit of extra money and go to Palms or Rio",4vCsySzTnsM7HT8z4LkLQQ,2,0,1,WMIwbjuxrkqjQuv_hyyzUg

It was pretty empty when we got there, around 4pm so I guess people were just getting off work because when we were leaving it was filling up fast. So get there before 5pm to be safe. 

Also on the being empty part, I was a bit concerned about it due to food just sitting and not being replaced.  That wasn't the case here. They kept putting out fresh food and taking out older ones.

My parents saw the waiter drop my fork and spoon while I was away getting my second plate. All the waiter did was put it back up on the table. Right in fucking front of them!

The meat of the crab legs appears to be made from cheap, unhealthy crabs with very poor meat inside. Also DO NOT EAT THE CLAMS! There are alot of clams that remained closed after being cooked, that means the clam actually died BEFORE it went into the pot, which can be a dangerous vector for food borne illnesses.

And for $12 a person for this kind of crap? Stuff that is unsanitary and can potentially kill us?

3142192,2014-06-05,1,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"Me: My kids love buffets. As far as Asian buffets go, this is really good. It's small so food stays fresh and small batched. I don't think the use much if any MSG. The steamed fish, stir-fried clams and the spinach dishes are always my go-to. Everything else is pretty good but these 3 are best. For quick Asian food fix, this beats Panda or take-out shops any day. 

Him: The fish here is amazing. The flavor is nice and light and it breaks easily when you eat it. It feels like it flakes apart. You don't have to really bite it. They have good sushi too. It's not like other sushi restaurants, but it's still just good. I like the noodles too. It tastes like the Chinese noodles I like with extra onions which means extra-flavor. Only go for lunch. Don't go for dinner like other people do who just go for the crab. I like crab but they have skinny snow crab and it's too weird because it doesn't have much flavor or meat like Dungeness crabs.

I went there with a friend yesterday.We've both been there before and I've eaten here on at least 10 or more previous occasions.I always enjoy the food TREMENDOUSLY here.They have a pretty decent variety and the food is very fresh and extremely tasty.I probably end up eating more here than just about any other Chinese buffet I go to.The manager (Daniel) and staff are extremely friendly and personable.
         Some of my favorite items include cocktail shrimp (with cocktail sauce). I really like this and most Chinese buffets do not have this.I would also recommend their garlic shrimp(extremely delicious flavor),pepper steak(tender),steamed fish,teriyaki chicken and a variety of other items you may like depending on your tastes and preferences.Their sushi selection is average,not bad but not spectacular,but to tell the truth,I enjoy the regular dishes so much that I rarely eat the sushi.
        Buffet Asia used to be my preferred Chinese buffet but Krazy Buffet has definitely replaced it as my favorite.My comments are based on the lunch buffet.You can go to the dinner buffet for about four dollars more but I haven't done that yet.I assume they might have a few extra items but I'm more than satisfied with the lunch selection.If you go to their web site,they have some coupons that you can print which will give you either a 10% or 15% discount depending on what time of day you go there.
       In closing,I truly recommend to anyone that is reading this review that you pay at least one visit to this place.If you do,I think you will go back again.I would come here at least once a week if they were closer to where I live.Try it.If you like it,post here and let us know.",8BGl261AJRO7pJNiQJ8Tsw,4,1,5,XmztZLw5Rp5ovJQnd9WkrQ

3294120,2009-02-26,0,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"I friggin' love a place with a goofy name, especially buffets.  The image of a ""krazy"" buffet for me would be loud colors, customers and a general orgy of food.  I guess because it was rainy, 11am on a weekday and everyone is broke as a joke, it wasn't exactly KRAZY.

However, $6.99 weekday lunch... and a friggin' 15% off coupon for senior citizens.  I got the senior citizen discount as well since I was dining with my parents.  I would have been okay to pay full price, but hell, that's more $$$ for next time!

If you are a veteran of ""Asian"" buffets (primarily of Chinese food with some Korean and ""sushi"" mixed in), then this will be a familiar typical experience... except that it's friggin' $6.99!!!  Even Asia Buffet II cannot compete with that.  Yes, the selection is a little lighter than AB II, but that is fairly reflected in the price.

In case you have never been to an Asian buffet, first of all, tsk, tsk.  You are missing out.  Basically, you are looking at AYCE chow mein, rice, broccoli beef, dumplings, four soups like hot and sour, wonton, egg flower and if you are lucky westlake, kung pao, string beans, deep fried tofu, possibly some Korean short ribs and sushi (of the roll variety with a smattering of hand rolls).  If you upgrade to dinner, you extra money goes into the sushi selection and the addition of crab legs.  My general policy is that this is not worth the extra money since sushi and crab are on my list of ""Things not to go cheap on"".

I suppose that Krazy makes up some of its food costs by charging $1.39 for a beverage, including tea.  Though, they only charged $1.39 for the table, rather than each as would be the case if it were sodas.  I am not entirely sure if a second pot would have yielded another $1.39 charge since we only got one pot.  If you are that strapped, then be sure to ask.

Anyway, I think that this a great place after a night of drinking or perhaps after losing your whole stack to a 10-3 suited.  Happily, I was just hung over.",xgcxhbbnokR-ZBazUrtXnA,0,2,4,-ZVvrz1VNlHY-CZoIVmYLQ

Also, what bothered me a bit and deterred me from getting some items were that some of the customers are gross. They were using the tongs to get the items and then throw the tongs with the handle in the food. Or they would throw the tongs on top of the food so that the handle was in the food. Gross ass customers that have no manners or courtesy of other people's health. I don't know where your nasty hands have been nor do I want to even guess.

Luckily I made a great decision and the food was fresh, hot, and scrumptious. They had plenty of greasy, fried appetizers that were all tasty and a great start to the meal. To my surprise the sushi was really fresh and there was a dedicated sushi chef making rolls the whole night which was refreshing to see. Generally when you head to a buffet the sushi is fairly fishy smelling and rarely edible but kudos to the sushi chef here.

If you are looking for a buffet where the busboys take your plates creepily within 2 seconds of finishing your meal then Krazy Buffet is the nuts.

Me and my fiance' have joked about this place for quite some time, just because of the name.  Seriously, ""Krazy Oriental Gourmet""?  Huh?  What the heck? I thought oriental referred to rugs now?  Maybe I'm wrong, not sure.  Anyway, we finally decided to give it a try about a month ago now, the first time, hehehe.  

It was so darn memorable the first time we went for lunch, I had to get me some more!  AND...I spotted that they have crab legs at night, and I'm a crab crackin' fool, LOVE me some crab!  The crab was nice, hot and fresh.  Thecooked veggies are amazing!  They even have a pretty nice salad bar and soft serve for dessert.  Plus it very clean.

The time a day you go to this place really governs the quality and the freshness of the food in my opinion. I notice that when i go during the lunch hours, the food always seems the freshest.  Krazy Buffet is a pretty good place to eat at ,during my experience there today and on other occasions ,I have noticed that  the staff there really  seem to be concerned with the comfort level of the customer- Making sure your drinks are full- Making sure the food is good- asking if the temperatures OK-- But not overly did or annoying - really more so in the sense of being observant-  I appreciate that kinda stuff.

They have a large selection of Chinese and Japanese food to pick from. Ranging from sushi , noodles , sea foods  , fried rices, vegetables,coca-nut flavored chicken, soups, desserts -ect- - They also have a small selection of typical American likes--- like pizza , french fries ,ice cream , salads- ect.

The price seems to very as expected depending on what time of day you go. The same goes for the food. During the day the typical price is about 10 bucks and at night time depending on what kind of foods you desire- like crab legs for instance-- the price could reach up to 13 bucks-- But hey it's all you can eat.

 Any way I'm going to give them an overall star score of 4, because the food and the service have  been pretty consistent during every visit I have had, and for me that matters the most.-- Consistency. 

Hope this was useful to some one . ENJOY.!",J9WNIFySCceex1e5VcsOHw,0,0,4,JUMmNdVlSibSo46zpqIZGw
3754831,2012-05-02,0,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"I ate at the Krazy Buffet for lunch on a Friday.  It was busy but always had a table open for people streaming in.  I was seated promptly, my drink order was taken quickly and I helped myself to several dishes that had shrimp and found them to be of average flavor and not anything that was over the top.  The chicken wings looked cooked perfectly but had no flavor...none...they were hot temperature but bland even though they looked good.  Their Hot Sour Soup was good but lacked that vinigar(?) flavor.  I tried small portions of several dishes and did not find anything that was so good that I would go back for, but none of it was ""bad"".  My drink was refilled quickly, however, I was puzzeled by a sense of invisibility while eating there.  No one asked if my food was good or if I liked what I was eating.  The wait staff spoke Chinese to each other and I think my dining experience could have been better had I been acknowledged or spoken to.  The overall rating of the food would be average or 1/2 a point below average.  I try to find positive issues when rating buffets,  as these places have a low margin of profit, and deserve fair and impartial comments.  So with that being said,  the place had ample parking, clean eating area, sufficient dishes to satisfy a lunch crowd that wants quick service, inexpensive food to cure the hunger and be on your way.

Today she and I were running a few errands and since she was driving, decided she wanted to eat at an Asian buffet for lunch.

We knew of the place Krazy Buffet on Sahara Avenue in Western Las Vegas and had been there before. So there we went.

I am still trying to figure out the ""Krazy"" part. Is the ""Krazy"" part the blatant mispelling of the word crazy in the name?  

The food was average at best. The servers brought us drinks, and cleared plates from the table but beyond that, nothing. Cost wise the bill for the two of us was between 22 and 23 dollars. Not bad at all considering we are in Las Vegas and buffets liter the city.

You can compare it to Panda Express. Wait--- except it's unlimited, the food is not drenched in grease, and you can finish your meal with ice cream. Hm, I guess the only similarity is the price ;)

4014330,2009-08-27,2,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"I don't know why we somehow always end up at a Chinese buffet at least twice a month.  Maybe because it's cheap?  Maybe because there's a lot of selection?  Maybe because I like to risk a bad tummy ache?  It's probably a combination of all these things.

We usually end up visitin Krazy buffet because of the coupons...yep!  I've been able to find them almost weekly in some of our local neigborhood papers.  Not only there but you can sometimes find a coupon in the online version of the Las Vegas Review Journal, they have a coupon area on the website.  The coupon we use is good for 10% off lunch or 15% off dinner.  Or is it 15% off lunch and 10% off dinner?  I can't recall right now.  Either way, with lunch being only $6.99 and dinner being $10.99 (all you can eat seafood none the less) it's not a bad deal if you're pinching pennies or want a change from Panda Express.  That coupon helps, especially in our broke-A$$ economy.

The selection is not bad, but for myself I prefer lunch items over their dinner items.  I say this because darn near all their lunch items are served at dinner, with the exception of the addition of crab legs, sometimes a steak option...and sometimes fresh oysters.  One night there might be oysters but the next night there might not be.  I know, it's a bit of a throw off so check the buffet line at dinner if you really want oysters!  I prefer lunch because I don't eat that much crab legs, and I'm not all that hot on oysters so for me the savings of $4 is worth it.

The selection of food is pretty good at Krazy Buffet (there's more choices though at Buffet @ Asia) and they keep things pretty fresh.  Their operation is also clean, which is a big plus for me.  If you read my Buffet @ Asia review you would know that they have some sanitation issues (but why that doesn't stop me from eating there I don't know..I'm guessing it's their awesome garlic fried wings).  

Anyway, they have a lot of your typical dishes you would find at a Chinese buffet.  They have the requisite orange chicken, beef and broccoli, and fried rice and chow mein.  They also have things like sauteed mushrooms, steamed tilapia, teriyaki chicken, coconut shrimp, stir-fry veggies, and pork chops.  There's a sushi station but I kinda stay away from it because nearly everything is California roll-ish and not particularly great.  They have a decent salad station with fresh lettuce, fresh veggies, and a large bowl of shrimp for shrimp cocktail.  The soup station is limited, mostly your Chinese staples such as egg drop, won ton, and hot and sour soup.  They do have miso soup sometimes which of course is Japanese.  Krazy Buffet does have an array of fried foods (yah of course) that has fried chicken wings, egg rolls, chicken skewers, sweet and sour shrimp, sweet and sour pork, and even some Chinese doughnuts.  Most Chinese buffets have pretty basic dessert areas, and Krazy Buffet is no different.  They have pre bought almond cookies, fortune cookies, chocolate cake, carrot cake, and some smaller dessert stuff.  But they do have fresh fruit like strawberries, cantaloupe, honeydew, and canned lychee.  Of course there is a soft serve ice cream machine with vanilla or chocolate.  

Overall, not a bad deal for under $9 for lunch, tax and tip.  Especially if you got that coupon.  It's not a revelation in culinary arts, but the food will keep you full for 2 hours or so...like most Chinese food does for some odd reason.  Clean and efficient, not all Chinese buffets can achieve that.  I just wish their fried chicken wings were as scrumptious as the ones from Buffet @ Asia on Rainbow!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,3,3,xPxX5phS-zW7pk7lRiCNUA

Many people wait for the crab to come, so we basically had to stare at the buffet area so we can get some when they brought it out.

We went in at 3pm and it was $9 per adult till 4pm. We thought the offering might be thin due to the time but they had everything.

The food was salty as expected but still pretty good. They were placed in small trays and rotated often. Everything seemed fresh and nothing was terrible. Overall, we were pleasantly satisfied and stuffed ourselves appropriately. 

Resist the urge to go for the oysters on the half shell and crab legs they start bringing out at 4pm for the dinner menu and you won't have the rude experience of having the manager come to your table to tell you that you'll get charged the full dinner price of $13.

They have good servers despite of their cheap customers. One star less because their host/cashier staff aren't great and the sushi are not good but hey, its not a Japanese restaurant.

Hubby and I come here about once every 3 months or so when we have a great crave for crab legs and feeling cheap to go elsewhere. Plus the only meat I eat is seafood and am very picky with so we like that this place always has something for me (crabs and some shrimp) instead of going elsewhere paying a fortune and I don't touch any of the other entrees. But really this place is CHEAP! The service is good. There are a couple of gals that we really like having as servers, one of them is Jenny. They refill drinks, check back on you and clean up your mess constantly. The guys not so much. You have to flag them just to get a refill. Also don't hesitate to ask for extra crackers since they only give one per table, they are whiling to give you more if you just ask. We took my dad here this past Sunday for dinner. He was amazed how cheap the price was and pointed that this place was A LOT cleaner than the other place, Buffet@Asia lol. I've been there probably 5 times. First time with my husband and the rest because some family/friends dragged me there and couldn't be too picky because I wasn't paying. Anyway, we were talking about how cheap the cost of the dine was and how worth it it was. We noticed how other tables around us didn't seem like they tipped much or at all. We weren't trying to look and talk about how much other people tipped and what not we individually noticed how cheap their customers can be. Food was CHEAP, quality was decent and service was decent. We felt bad. We follow our standard of doubling tax for a basic eh, so so service and triple for a good service. But not tipping is just plain RUDE. Don't eat out if you ""won't"" tip. Its Vegas people! Yes, it is their jobs but these employee ofter depend on tips to make a living.
We get it IF the service was bad and not tipping can probably justify that but like said servers were decent. Its a buffet restaurant, do you really expect your servers to chat with you?

For $8.29, the food is pretty good. You have your Chinese-American regulars, such as orange chicken, wonton soup, dumplings, fried rice, chow mein, etc. But you also have steamed fish, pork ribs, clams, vegetable tempura, Americanized sushi, and... *trumpet sounds* a soft serve ice cream machine.

They have a pretty good assortment of food choices. I personally prefer to get a cheap Chinese chicken wing craving fulfilled here during lunch. Plus, their apple strudel dessert is one of my personal favorites. For those with kids, don't fret, because they have french fries and pizza for them little picky eaters.

A positive thing to note is that they have salt & pepper shrimp WITH the head and legs on. You can eat the whole thing. And I just love that salt & pepper taste.

The restaurant interior is nice, but it reminds me of when I used to live in less-than-ideal areas. The seats are kind of sticky and graffiti in the restroom is noticeable. However, I don't really mind since I know I'm getting a decent meal at a very affordable price.

This place has a lot going for it, but also has some not-so-good things going for it.  Mostly the good outweighs the bad.  The bad stuff primarily stems from the people that can often be seen there.  

Once when my fiancée and I went, we noticed a little boy that was dropping his food all over the floor, then proceeded to crawl down and eat it...OFF THE FLOOR.  His Mother was either not noticing this at all, or simply ignoring him.

Another time we went, we had to endure a large party of people with screaming kids whose parents just kept yelling at them to settle down, which obviously didn't help.

Again, these are matters that aren't the restaurant's fault, but I do think they should be wary of people that are making unnecessary loud noises or shouting, disturbing other patrons of the place.

The food though is delicious.  I love their salt and pepper squid, the meatballs on a skewer, the steamed pork buns, and the coconut shrimp!

Not too big a fan of their sushi selection, but thankfully I can enjoy sushi at a wide variety of other places here in town my fiancée and I frequent!

I have one of those moms. Where I really don't want to go home and eat her cooking. The selection here is pretty decent. I did not bother to try sushi bc I go to a sushi restaurant for those.

They had 4 soups of wonton, beef, sweet and sour, egg drop, the usual suspects. So the wonton soup was only ok but I stuck green onions on my beef broth as it was good enough. I find that coming in with low expectations makes everything not that bad. They had quite a few desserts. The macaroons are soft and tasted ok. Had grapes and watermelon for dessert. Watermelon was crunchy.

Service was ok. Most smiled at me as I passed them and my plates miraculously disappeared when I came back. I dined Han Solo so had a chance to actually eat and observe quite a bit. I don't know why ppl complain so much for a $14 dinner buffet. A Korean and Japanese one starts at $26.

arrived at 7:30 and none of the cold ""hot"" dishes were replenished even though completely gone,
place was prety empty and the waitstaff were holding up walls, so why was my empty plate still there when I returned from a trip to the buffet?

When we visit buffets, I keep track of how many items I am compelled to spit out, and I am happy to report that there wasn't a single item here that didn't pass the test. I didn't love the spinach or the green beans, but they were not overly salty or flavored poorly. They were simply plain.

It was around 3:40pm when we got seated and the man seating us was asking if we were going to do lunch or dinner.

I realized this because there's a sign by the crab legs stating if you get some then there's an automatic dinner charge. My boyfriend had told him dinner so we decided to try out the crab legs as well. They weren't bad. For a dinner price of $14 what can you expect. They went fast and they didn't seem to want to refill them with more til about an 30 to 45 min later. I thought all the food was pretty mediocre. There wasn't anything special. There was sushi and that was really good. I like the sake (fresh salmon and rice) sushi but they would go fast and they wouldn't refill them. I fact it wasn't refilled even when leaving.

For that price, you get crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, clams, mussels, and probably 40 other dishes that are all decent to quite good.  Plus, you can use the coupon for $5 off the bill!  Only exception was the sushi section where I thought the nigiri were not quite up-to-par.  Service was typically stiff but very timely.

Here's what I liked:
- Crab legs were great, and unlike most places not salty at all.  Only if I saw that giant pot of melted butter earlier...
- Seasoned crabs also, which I did not have but mum said was good
- Raw oysters!!!!
- Crawfish was yummy, they put some type of seasoning on it that was great.  As with any steamed crawfish, it's a pain-in-the-ass to eat though.
- Mussels in the mayo-based sauce was great, mussels were plump
- Clam in some type of garlic(?) sauce was also great
- 4 types of soups - miso, wonton, hot & sour, and egg drop were good
- Several flavors of ice cream
- Fried bananas were awesome!
- Mandarin orange - the canned kind, but I love those
- The apple strudel-looking thing looked really good, but did not have room in my tummy
 
Didn't like so much:
- As mentioned above, stay away from the sushi
- Desserts were not great.  I had the cream puffs and they were awful.
- Fried rice tasted like the ones at fast food places, not Chinese restaurants
- Overall Chinese dishes didn't look impressive

This place was about 25-30 minutes away from home, but we don't mind the drive if we get to try something new.

When we came in (around 630pm) it was pretty busy, but we were seated as soon as we came in, which was awesome that we didn't have to wait. There's people that complain about how old the place looks and the seating but I didn't mind it at all. That's actually not something I really care for anyway when I go to eat somewhere.

They had a WIDE variety of food. Sooooooo much. I don't think I can eat for another two days! Their crab was delicious especially with the hot butter. They are SMALLER crablegs than what you'll get paying $20 bucks at a casino buffet but it's all you can eat so what does it matter? It was hot, delicious and sooo worth the $12.49.

They had so many different foods to choose from and it was of good quality. I'm not a massively picky eater but I can be and I really enjoyed eating here.

This buffet is off of Sahara not real close to the strip.  

This place is kinda in the middle of the road to me.
I have been to way better places and also have had worse.

We have been here a few times in the past as well that as before Yelp :)

We have found that the earlier you go in for dinner or lunch the better it is as with any buffet same with this one for them for bringing out hot fresh food.

The night we went in it was pretty busy and the food was being replaced pretty fast.
My husband really likes the crab legs. They are not big but they are ok to satisfy your craving!
The Sushi is not at all like going to a Sushi place but it is passable. They do put out a few different kinds of rolls.. Like I said it is ok nothing that satisfies my cravings for Sushi but I did have a few pieces and they were just ok.

The price for lunch and dinner is not too bad. Nothing like the strip buffet prices.

Over all the food is just ok, it is usually hot and the items that I did try were not too bad. I am not too crazy about Chinese food at a buffet. I would much rather have it made fresh for me. 

The staff keeps the plates cleaned up real good and drinks filled pretty fast even when busy.

I used to live just a block from here approximately four years ago when they were building Krazy Buffet. I had moved just prior to their opening and wondered what affect it would have on one of my favorite Chinese restaurants just down the street (Bobo China). 

I was in the mood for Chinese and we were very hungry, wanting to resolve our lunch and dinner all in one shot.

The place is clean, has comfy cushy booths, lots of variety of food to select from and great staff clearing tables and bringing drink refills.

The food was good, not bad and not great. The sushi was better than usual buffet sushi which is usually horrid. I enjoyed the stuffed mussels, orange chicken, fried rice, fried shrimp, coconut shrimp, sushi, meatball skewers, pot stickers, cherry bananas and coconut macaroons for dessert.

Mmmmm those pork meatball skewers were packed full of flavor with a drizzle of BBQ sauce on them. Yummy. I could sit and just eat a plate of those balls and be satisfied. 

They have a great salad bar as well which was super fresh and had all of the toppings and dressing you could want.

My hubby really enjoyed the super big juicy chicken wings fried to perfection in a delicious light batter.

This visit did the trick, we came we ate and we conquered.

This Asian buffet serves up decent Chinese foods that are typically sold at Chinese take-out outposts throughout the Las Vegas valley.  Plus they have a salad bar, small sushi rolls station, desserts, and in the evening also dish out crab legs, oysters (maybe oysters are served all day. Never been here during lunch).  And the price is fair for the food they serve (10% off discount ads can often be found in local publications).

I live fairly close to Krazy Buffet, and the parking lot area in its immediate vicinity is always packed with cars during meal time.  On most of my visits, including this past Easter, the restaurant was filled with a lot of patrons.  But service was still good (drink refills and clearing the used plates are taken care of staff that patrol their assigned sections).

I am not much of a crab legs person at these buffets (just don't feel like getting my hands dirty), but at nights that is the thing everyone else goes for.  But the kitchen is pretty good about making more to refill the near-empty trays with leggy reinforcements.  Raw (Olympia) oysters are also served (not sure if this is available during lunch), which are also very popular.

The sushi is okay. Definitely can't compare them to the ones you order at Japanese restaurants.  But you are also not being charged $25 for their AYCE sushi option. The seaweed salad is great, and is just like the one served at all the other Japanese restaurants.  

The steamed fish with soy and scallions is my favorite item in the hot Chinese food section.  Get some steamed rice or fried rice, get a few pieces of steamed fish and spoon on some sauce and you are good to go.  Sauteed Long Beans, Honey Walnut Prawns, Chinese and Mushrooms, and Fried Sesame Balls are my usual favorites at Krazy Buffet.  If you are new to this eatery, try those.

Other highlights:  crawfish, fried chicken wings, coconut fried shrimps, mini-meatball skewers, Korean BBQ ribs (hit and miss), .

If you planned ahead and saved some room for desserts at the end, you can make your own pie a la mode, or go crazy with the Krazy orange slices, canned fruits, jello, or have some fried plantains.

Krazy Buffet is perfect for all of these occasions, conditions and more:
1)  You have a large party and a limited budget.
2)  General Chinese/Asian food craving.
3)  You are hungry and generally indecisive, but still gotta eat.
4)  Have family units to feed, but no time to cook or you can't cook or you burnt the Stouffers Lasagna (or forgot to turn on the oven).
5)  You are Krazy for buffets.
6)  You want to carb up Asian style before the next 10K.
7)  You are seeking restaurants with plenty of veggie options.

8)  Your Chinese heritage compels you to come up with lucky 8 number of reasons to convince others to check out Krazy Buffet.

Food:  4/5  Great selections. Generally pretty good.

Price/Value:  4.5/5  For AYCE crab legs, the price of admission is very reasonable.

Service:  3.5/5  Drinks are refilled automatically and dirty plates cleared by house elves.  But just like the famous Dobby, a little demonstration of monetary appreciation for services rendered is appreciated.

Parking:  3.5/5  You should park further to walk off those extra calories, but there will be plenty of parking spaces before you get to burn off a single calories.

Rounding up to 4 stars!",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,0,4,rEtaqSWXcUnbiPU137t2Kw

Before you read my review take this into consideration, its $7 for lunch & $12 for dinner ALL YOU CAN EAT Asian-ish buffet....WHAT DO YOU ExPEct? Definitely NOT gourmet food!? THat would be one helluva KRAZY idea! In a nutshell salad looked unappetizing, chicken wings were good til I discovered it was because of the MSG that they use on it, egg drop soup tasted like scrambled eggs swimming in cornstarch soup, kalbi beef had an after taste as well as the baked green mussels ( I can taste/smell meats etc when they have been properly washed or cleaned, they have a certain stench to them even after they are cooked) the sushi looked unappealing and the fish did not look fresh, the desserts consisted of canned fruit of the lowest grade possible, almond cookies, chocolate mousse etc., they did have a chocolate & vanilla soft serve yogurt machine but bananas smothered with red sauce? Interesting.... At least they had sliced fresh oranges. They did have crab legs for dinner as well as seasoned crab pieces. The ok dishes for me were the chop suey, the pot sticker and the fried rice. Hey at least the food is edible...not a total waste of money. If you are looking for a place to just satisfy your hunger that is within your budget that can give you the variety you crave then you have come to the right place! Oh and by the way I think that buffet @ Asia has way more varieties and fresher more delicious food than here, it is more expensive though.

The food is always coming out fresh when the trays are half empty, the variety of food will please everyone.  My daughter loves this place since she is a picky eater.  You have to try it and for the price you have nothing to lose and everything to gain lol.  xoxoxo",RCgfxH5PclsgSKRWDGJ86A,1,0,4,BucCIe6jmtlxWUmBHlp_KA
5959255,2013-01-26,5,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"My fella is an Asian buffet food fiend and I try to indulge him from time to time by enduring a meal at Buffet of Asia because I'm a good girlfriend! This morning I decided to indulge him as well as my Yelpyness by trying a new place where he could eat Asian food til her bursts and I'd have the opportunity to check off a bookmark from my list. Win win. 

We arrived around 11 and the place wasn't too busy. The place is pretty clean and service was really attentive. Refills were quick and plates were cleared away quickly as well. 

On to the food. The line was kept clean and the food options were plentiful. I was impressed by the amount of veggie options that they had. That is often lacking in buffets. I will probably never be a big fan of buffets, but this is one of the better options in town.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,13,10,3,wpj4fFYnOVT0mDf81_Y2AA

Seems every time we come the owner or manager (or whoever he is) is so completely rude. We came in at 8:30 on Friday night and they close at 10. They started taking food off the buffet at 9:15 and asked us to pay so they could close their register at 9:30. When we said we'd pay when we were done eating he got angry and said they were closing and that everyone else had paid so we needed to as well. And when we asked why they were taking the food away so early they said everyone was done. Uhhh, no we aren't!! They were so rude and this is the second time we've been through this with them at this location. The location on Cheyenne is much better with better management and better service and they don't treat the customers like this and close 45 minutes early and ask you to pay before you're done eating. We won't be coming back. Didn't get our money's worth at all, and don't appreciate being rushed to pay while eating with 45 minutes left before closing. Horrible customer service!!!",VDd76GM11DVvK7gKxFtD0g,1,0,1,XQaYqvOwWmTKaV2usXDszg
5996343,2017-07-31,2,hDL3Q-GNQlOuE04_zWEMJA,"This buffet is pretty standard and has a lot of seafood. We came on a Sunday which the price is $12.99 plus you have to pay for a drink which is $1.40. 

The service was okay. I had to wait until I got my second round of food for the server to come and bribg me a drink. I think if your party is big and gets stuck in the room sometimes the server forgets about your party. I had to flag our server down a couple of times to ask for drinks for some of our party as well as for myself. 

The crab legs were good. Some had barely anything inside and some had a good amount. The egg drop soup was really good and the walnut shrimp was a bit tangy. I liked the deep fried shrimp too. 

I thought it was cool that they actually had a candle we borrowed to put on a dessert for my mom's birthday so we could sing happy birthday to her. Also they have coupons where you can get 10% off and you just have to print it and give it to them when paying.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,2,2,3,ky5V0eOxPdCsp81vF7EJPQ
