Food was decent but the service was awful. Waited so long and had to chase down my delivery driver in my bath robe because he couldn't find my apt building. They also forgot my orange soda. EAT24 is amazing and if you ever use the app, you know. Don't hold them responsible for the carelessness of this restaurant.",gy8tGCVYlqohm1eO_39SKQ,2,0,2,MbC2DO6a4mVfVNyAisewBA
1523806,2014-07-01,1,FZDcm4f7aOvYK7aD7aBtvA,"Ordered a few times from here. Food was great each time. Last time it took a bit longer than usual (about 55 minutes)
This time we waited an hour and checked what was going on, they said the driver was on the way. We waited until an hour and a half then called, to which they reply the driver is leaving now he'll be there in about 15 minutes. Hour and 50 minutes later no food still.",3ZIhHBqetkMQAJNp_eMwzg,3,0,1,rvndIQkqALy4a7yrwiGm8w

Deserts are all typically frozen, but tasty. My problem has always been with their delivery. Typically we order from them using eat24.com and delivery takes FOREVER. We have never received our food in under an hour, and as I'm typing this I have been waiting for over an hour and a half for a burger, 8 wings and fries. 

If you're going to eat from Ray's I strongly suggest doing pick-up, or try another means to ordering their food. I can't speak for any other food apps, or calling them directly, but my experience with their service has been awful.",BJVGx1OAh0iUfRAD5WVyag,0,0,2,nnTS_8SGc1RelEa7L_yXeA
2658600,2014-11-16,1,FZDcm4f7aOvYK7aD7aBtvA,This place is terrible. Not only did I have to wait over hour my delivery they cant even make or shape a calzone.there was barely any cheese and there salad is a joke. How can a place be cheap with lettuce !

And yes taking 2 hours for delivery is a bit much for food that's average at best- plus the good is always missing stuff :( DONE",y0axDGrceM7ve0chunw2Iw,4,1,1,PSyUQyQPuhpqLhbuA7rYZg

Calzone (cheese) also delicious, could have used just a little more ricotta. Delivery was fast, food was hot, and the driver was really nice. Definitely will order again.",ta_mSUw_BZnij91tTdQsDw,0,0,5,upp8MY1aOpwxJzb5dyoq8Q
5447792,2014-08-31,2,FZDcm4f7aOvYK7aD7aBtvA,"I have never eaten at rays. I work less than a mile from them so I used the eat 24 app and the driver called me an hour and 40 minutes after the order asking where I was. Slow service is no service. Especially when I am .77 miles away. Will never order from you again. I then spent an hour with eat 24 on chat support to solve the refund. You wasted my time to such a degree, that is feel it's necessary to leave you a bad review. Change your delivery time to 100 minutes.",8bAM0gNl1wc0iAHTtmkLmg,1,1,1,m9GiZzrVMO1vhmdq_hxgVA
5902095,2014-08-21,0,FZDcm4f7aOvYK7aD7aBtvA,The wings are always good. I live around the corner and order to go. I can always count on Ray being there and his happy face.,FnPElbRtiMpfJfoLdPcBeA,0,0,5,grhXLn-cEacdof_HdJK2wg
