A rude employee stated I could not eat there if I was not at least 21. I would have appreciated a ""How can I help you today?"" but instead he came over like he didn't even want to speak with my friend and I. I could understand that rule especially near the bar but there is seating far from it and I have eaten many times in those areas. I just wanted fries and now a rule that didn't stop me before, is interfering.",G0cxjXmzWhCsfEYgPSPq3w,1,0,1,x5EAHpiGHZRROO2FNmMaAw
1584695,2018-02-24,0,-SGZcGqnsp_uRIjKP2RGZg,My boyfriend had some drinks here after a round of golf. He accidentally left a gift card (without his name on it) at the bar.  The waitress made sure to keep it safe so we could pick it the next day.  We were so thankful.   She was so sweet to do so.  We stayed for some drinks and hung out. She took care of us and even comped a drink.  We didn't try the food.  But April is so sweet and made sure she got it back to us.  Thanks guys for that!,5uuJhippghVNvAILQvwwnQ,1,1,5,A2wCcTKWRbTdRSqOrxBMhw

But instead we experienced a nice crowd that flowed in and out for a very relaxing experience.  The kitchen staff was keeping the food fresh and hot and cold food cold!  As it should be!  The prime rib was slightly on the medium well side, which I like, but could have been more to the rare side as some others wanted.  The saving part was it was flavorful and very tender. Our server was friendly, always with a smile and kept all her tables glasses filled with water and of course Mimosas on going!  They had several flavors with  prickly pear and mango our favs!!!   With new management and new ideas this place is a Las Vegas winner!  Golf, great drinks, good food, easy parking and a beautiful view! A person at the next table said the Thursday night happy hour was great!  Gotta give it a try!",fF141DglsFFtpa0-O8V-oQ,1,1,4,hGce5pG7s9xEbgvg_yS0Tw

However, as many times as my husband and I have been here we have yet to have a good food experience. The service is a bit slow, but not bad, and since the atmosphere is super casual, we don't mind the wait. But man, I wish I had the funds to take this place over and get some good solid food selections on the menu, and show them how to be price conscious while being ingredients quality conscious as well! It's that great of a location, I'd do it in a heartbeat!",fpOzdR8rncq-_kBugg-6dg,1,0,1,KKf3U0PBfwB56zcjf3TN4g

The food is very good and they always have specials like $9.99 Weekend Brunch with Bottomless Mimosa Bar. Follow the golf course Facebook page for updated specials. The staff is very friendly, and we have yet to be disappointed. We live in the community and find it a great place to bring friends and family.",QctMxrrxIIrha8gB7XAo8Q,1,1,4,ip9McFo1fGlLoNLZD_6kTQ
4785746,2018-05-11,0,-SGZcGqnsp_uRIjKP2RGZg,"I live close by so have visited this place many times. Sometimes we get service but most of the time when we walk in and sit down, we are ignored and get no service.  And usually it's not busy.  Last night we got a flyer that RHG was hosting a band from 6pm to 9pm, we arrived at 8:20pm and after we sat down we saw people coming out of the kitchen serving food to golfers.  When the waitress came to us we told her just wanted to order nachos and she said the kitchen was closed.  It's so close and convenient, that's the only reason I've kept coming back. After last night I can count at least half a dozen times I haven't gotten service.  We've always been friendly people to them, however I guess they just don't like the RR residents or something. We are officially never going back.",p5ZMohYt8XPW05TdHefDrw,0,0,1,GualE_bI71Ukrvd5tB4tqw
