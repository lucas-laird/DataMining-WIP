73602,2014-07-18,0,82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A,"I would pretty much rather eat anywhere else. I would even say McDonald's is better than this place. We ordered a cheeseburger, gyro, fries, fruit salad and a water bottle. First of all, the delivery person was 20 minutes late, like outside of the 65 minutes it was supposed to take. Secondly:
- The cheeseburger was CHARRED. Like disgustingly burned and hard on the outside, and the inside was dried up.
- The gyro was gross... just like salty meat in gross bread. Just didn't taste fresh at all.
- The fries were the worst I've ever had. Just kind of empty fried hollow things.
- The fruit salad was FROM A CAN.
- The water bottle never came. I asked the guy where it was and he just shrugged. Didn't offer me a free drink next time or anything.

Basically I'm never eating here again and you shouldn't either unless you just want to throw your money away. I could barely stomach it. Bleghhh",HbvzpK_aj8p1lCJ5ax5LlQ,0,0,1,BvI_LtycCZ5lXB4dQX5otA

My coworkers and I order from this place from time to time while we work our late days. The food is just mediocre, but because the menu has some variety we can all agree on it.

Well we ordered from grubhub, and I tried updating our new address on the website, but I guess it didn't save. Mind you, our new building is 20 feet away from our old one, so it's not that huge of an inconvenience. Apparently it was. I'm at work, and both the driver and the restaurant are calling my cell phone multiple times, leaving multiple messages. Eventually when I can call them back, I apologize and give them the new address and move on with my life. I can see the driver walking around across the parking lot, I figured he'd find us pretty quick. 

Another 20 minutes goes by, and he finally shows up. Immediately when he walks in, I'm apologizing for the confusion. He's not saying a word, shaking his head at me and huffing and puffing. He asks me what address we're at, looks at his slip, tosses it and the food at me and walks out. 

My advice to you, sir: we all have to put on our smiling customer service faces, even when we're annoyed. Drop the attitude.

Oh also my grilled cheese sandwich was dripping in grease? or butter? or something. Either way, it was hard to eat. My coworker's egg salad sandwich was so full of mayonnaise that it was falling apart. Come on. I'd say the equivalent of gas station food.

Good flavors and there are lots of different cheesesteaks to choose from. The fries were so-so - and the cheese melted over the top was minimal and did nothing for the fries (2 stars). For the wings, I opted for the Cajun. They were about average (3 stars). I would have enjoyed them more if they were spicier and saucier. The pizza was eh (2.5 stars). Edible and not bad for delivery, but definitely lacking. However, they do offer lots of different pizzas and I am curious to try some different toppings and see if that doesn't make it better.

2388721,2014-01-28,6,82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A,"I feel like Cafe Modena deserves an update from me.  So here it is. 

I came across Cafe Modena a few years back and it is one of my favorite spots to eat at when I'm in the area, like I'd be here at least 4-5 times a month. It's located off of Spencer and Warm Springs inside of a bar named Chris's Place, the bar and dining area are actually separate so it doesn't feel like a bar.  Entering and looking around you'll probably think that there is no way the food here is any good, the decor is old and most of the time I've been there it's empty except for the party I'm with and some smaller parties but I can I assure you the food here is excellent. I mean it's not ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" like what 5 stars means but it's made very well, always consistent in the quality, and taste very good for traditional, non-fusion type of food, better than your standard neighborhood bar food.

My favorite here are the calzones definitely the calzones. The regular calzones are reasonably priced at about $8-10 and are huge.  They even offer a large for $5 more and those are a beast. I've never gotten a burnt or undercooked one. The insides are filled with nothing but deliciousness.  There's a plain, a vegetarian, spinach, grilled chicken, ham, and pepperoni and I've had them all my favorite being the spinach. Cafe Modena is actually my preferred place in Vegas for a calzone.

When I'm not ordering a calzone which doesn't happen that often my 2nd favorite is the Big Fat Gyro with Tzatziki Sauce and fries. Gyros are still pretty new to me and I've only had them at a handful of places. They're good, I enjoy them.  It's one of the items others ordered often.

Nothing here is what you would call small. In fact for the price the amount of food is generous. I came here one Friday looking for a small meal and ordered chicken quesadilla apps. Thinking it was going to be way to small for me I decided to add the wings and fries special which was only like $7. The chicken quesadilla had a nice thick mixture of cheese and chicken. It was plenty filling on it's own and I still had the wings and fries coming.  When the wings came out I ate a couple of the wings and called timeout. There were about 10 wings and large pile of fries, no way I could finish that after eating most of the quesadilla. 

The lasagna and spaghetti are two other excellent choices. The rest of the menu are your usual items like pizzas, pastas, soup, salads, sandwiches, burgers, ribs, etc but they'll probably be big in portions and low in price. The daily specials are also a deal.

As I said earlier the decor are kind of old. It's dressed in pink and turquoise pastel colors with a couple old televisions but it has cable and is spacious.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,9,9,4,17s-FB77G5CKS3KlUGXadg

Being so late I was not sure if I missed the cut off for some real delicious delivery. I decided to consult my handy Yelp app and found a great restaurant that sell pizza and other goodies too. This restaurant has a local location where customers can eat a physical place or order delivery. Delivery again was the route I went. There menu is very extensive and thought I would try them out. 

The online order process was smooth and I did it through the Yelp app, and it is being delivered by GrubHub. I did have to call the restaurant directly since the Yelp delivery app does not allow me to put the apartment number or building number in. Plus, I feel comfortable talking to a human making sure that they did get the order. Since it was so late the employee that answered the phone was imputing my order when I called and informed me that she would be delivering it too.

While the Yelp app did give a certain window of time it was delivered later than what the delivery time should of been. I was not in the least upset since I received everything in the order perfectly. I ordered a Garlic Pizza and it was so great the feta cheese was so amazing and fresh tasting. The cheese pizza that I ordered for the twins was delicious. It was just a really good pizza. The ingredients that they use are so much better than most averages pizza restaurants too. You can taste the quality of their food. As an appetizer I ordered fried mushrooms with ranch and garlic knots. The balance of garlic on the garlic knots was just perfect. The fried mushrooms were some of the best that I have had in a long while . I will order from here again. It is so great to try new restaurants but when you find one that Las really great it's worth a little dance and celebration.",I-4KVZ9lqHhk8469X9FvhA,20,12,5,OpoD7GB_SnFBss5-l0KQ3g

It was all awesome except the salad was no where near fresh with gross cucumbers and nasty tomatoes.

4060189,2016-02-20,0,82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A,"Will not order from again. Ordered fried mushrooms and a chicken Alfredo at work. I work at a warehouse and it is locked after sundown so I have in the delivery notes to call the hotline so someone will knew they've arrived. Instead, the driver sat outside and honked for who knows how long. I didn't know he was here until someone came back from their bathroom break to tell me about it. The mushrooms were fine, though the ranch was so watered down it would not stay on the mushrooms, so I gave up on that before I made a mess and ate them dry. The chicken Alfredo wasn't even edible! The chicken was dry, most of the pasta was still crunchy, and the sauce was so cold and lumpy I'm not even sure it was heated up to food service specs in the first place. I ended up throwing it away because I don't think it was actually safe to eat. Definitely not the kind of quality I'd expect from a restaurant partnered with Eat24.",OfUaF8Amqzb_GaI01Mumlg,0,0,1,aXL4Eq0QnMXXh8oFOVxPEQ
4220676,2015-04-06,2,82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A,I love the food!! It tastes amazing and very fresh. So glad I found them!!  It was really accidental and providential. I needed to take quick food to a New Years Party and I had nothing to take. Fast forward and that was my first exposure to Cafe Modena. They were open and delivered my order within the hour. I was beyond impressed. The quality of their varying menu items will leave you impressed (relieved for me taking food to snobby foodies). I've ordered 3 times since Jan 1st and have been pleased with each experience.,7FMjkpt6TsH1Ljl4hbe9Ng,3,3,5,_c-gWKNA_U0DHWg2hA1ShA

You never ever get the right food and always a Cop out excuse   Like oh we have a new waitress or new cook.

That is until Modena!!!  Yay,  finally decent food that delivers!!  Hubby and I are both home sick.  The food was so good the first night,  we ordered AGAIN Saturday night. 

Not just Pizza.... Both nights I had Catfish dinner.  Fish was cooked perfectly,  white plump and flakey, delicately seasoned.  I also had the BEST chicken noodle soup I've ever had from a restaurant.  Little noodle flowers, lots of chicken, green beans, carrots, corn and peas.  A healthy dose of black pepper made the seasonings blend nicely. Yummy!
Hubby had Giant Mushroom Cheeseburger one night and Double Philly Steak Sandwhich the next night.  He said both were good.  Big portions, with big steak fries.  His side salad was more than just a heap of iceberg lettuce like most takeout salads.  

Delivery took about 40 minutes,  and we both ate big meals for under $30 total. 

I don't know about their pizza or dining there,  but I know they'll be added to my speed dial!",nsZquYOxe6b_6x8MOKC-lA,3,2,4,VTvxDMSsfN8SHPbgFt22EA

So We randomly ordered a pizza from Cafe Modena La Pizzeria. It was Delicious! It was delivered hot and on time. The ingredients were home-made and the veggies were very fresh. The pizza was fully loaded too. It's a family owned and run business. And the service was very warm and friendly. I highly recommend that anyone visiting Las Vegas, who decides to have a ""pajama day,"" call Cafe Modena. They deserve 5 stars+.",ZBmgr9uC6kRa9KritAsF7w,0,1,5,vwrIrcHJZWo7FZ6Byk6bCA

I ordered chicken wings which came dry no sauce on them so figured whatever ill use my own. Both me and my gf ate them and not more then a hour later We were throwing up our guts and using the toilet. It tasted all rubber it was so nasty that it tasted better coming up. I called up the restaurant to talk to the manager about it and as soon as I did this mother flucker Ivan tells me first thing was contact a lawyer and go to the hospital. No manners no customer service straight up A holes there. Save yourself hours in the bathroom and a huge head ache from another sh't hole...,Byo_zj5JfYV_crjGYFj0hw,0,0,1,FccY9GEEHSFDmqAPhvNnMw

5569442,2016-02-13,0,82-wE5pkxyBKhfxyyZap_A,The worst service I've ever experienced.  I spent $40 for food that took over an hour to get to me on top of being cold. I could have made a grilled cheese sandwich for my son much cheaper and it would have been hot for him he didn't even eat it because it was cold. The pizza tasted like it was sitting out for at least 10 to 15 minutes before the driver actually picked it up off the warmer if there even is warmer there. I will never ever ever eat at this disgusting place again! When I called to complain and ask for a manager the guy said there was no manager on duty which I know is a lie because no store whether it be pizza Hut dominos or this cafe Modena whatever it is they should always have a manager for the shift the guy had no customer service skills whatsoever he was extremely rude. Honestly I hope this place goes down the tubes. Oh they also double charged me for delivery. Its called a flare delivery rate! I hope the idiot who I spoke to on the phone reads this and his supervisor sees this review. He told me the manager could be found at the Mandalay bay hotel. Ha!

They earn their tip and delivery charge.
