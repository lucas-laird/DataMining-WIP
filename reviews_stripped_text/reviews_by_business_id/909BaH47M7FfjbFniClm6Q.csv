The management is a joke! I've been here multiple time and they can't seem to get shit right.  I mean your a pizza place that serves a limited menu, how hard is it to get an order right 50% of the time. 
I literally just got back from this place a few minutes ago and instead of eating I am too upset that I'd rather write this review, in hopes that i save someone else's time.  
I called and placed a phone order, a bestest light sauce and cheese light sauce.  I was advised that my order would be ready in 20 minutes.  I arrived 22 min. later and was advised that it would be another 5 min as my pizza had just been placed in the oven.  Okay, fine, whatever..i asked are you sure 5 min. and they assured me it would.  Well, that was an absolute bold face lie.  I waited impatiently as person after person walks in and placed and order and leaves!  No pizza after 5 min., none after 10, none after 15 and none after 20!!! Seriously!! 22 additionally minutes waiting in the store and I finally get my pizza.  ""Oh I am sorry about the wait"" is seriously not enough! This has happened multiple time at this location.  I  heard them talking and they said they gave my pizza to someone else, they did not tell me this, they should have.  
We have a few pizza places in Vegas, literally anyone one would be better than this rip off place.  I mean if you see pizza at a dumpster it be better!!",0rHzL5Qy-IFrwSmRKehx2Q,3,1,1,cn7HddWhY0OLkFC3j0dakw

I walk in there a few folks waiting, which is a red flag already.  The place that advertises Hot N Ready never seems to have anything, but no biggie I really want this Crazy Bread lol.

Unfortunately, after about 5-10 minutes of standing, and zero acknowledgement decided the craving was gone.  This place is ran horribly.  I saw the few employees there walking around not sure what was going on.  The one person who I saw get a pizza had to send it back  as it was not cut.

Went today and the girl at the register was very rude! It was around 7:30pm! Not a happy customer. 

WORST!!! WORST!! WORST!!! Little Caesars store ever!!!!! They never ever ever have a pizza hot and ready!!!!! Management should really step up and change all the employees in there. Make sure you ask them if your pizza is ready because even when your pizza is finally ready they still take forever to hand it over to you. I have to ask if my order is ready and then she's like oh yeah sorry... Papa Johns is faster when i order for delivery!! What's up with that!????? I've been here several times and it's always the same thing!

2741726,2014-03-07,5,909BaH47M7FfjbFniClm6Q,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4. Come one people! Either you like it or you don't! In my case, I like it because of the fact that it's only 5 bucks for a large cheese or pepperoni pizza! My kids love this stuff and it's easy on my wallet. The pizza itself is not the best but good enough for me and my family! 

The first paragraph pretty much sums up the 4 stars. I would of gave them 5 stars not too long ago. Why? Because before the crazy bread was only 99 cents and it automatically came with marinara sauce to dip it in. Now it costs 2.50 and the marinara sauce is extra now. Their wings are pretty good too which used to be 5 bucks for an order of 6. Now it's 6 bucks. Really? A dollar a wing? The wings and breadsticks alone would satisfy me. Now that luxury is gone and we just have the 5 dollar pizzas to go by. 

As for service, sometimes it hit or miss. Often times its a miss when they have the lunch and dinner rush. You cant blame them for being really busy those times because like I said, its hard to beat a large 5 dollar pizza that is ready to go as soon as you pay. The misses are usually if you call for take out and order some of the other pizzas that are not pre made. Since they are constantly pumping out 5 dollar large cheese and pepperoni pizzas, regular orders get mixed up, which happened to me a couple times. They would forget a topping or put a topping I didn't want.

So hate these guys all you want. Bottom line is, their 5 dollar pizzas are hard to beat especially when you have kids and want to save money. It's a win win for both parties. I would say enjoy this deal while it is still good because my assumption is that it will go up to 6 bucks as well eventually.

Little Caesars has always been able to fulfill my sudden craving for pizza on the go. I use to look forward to their simple pepperoni hot n ready deep dish or their buffalo wings. Their pizza for as fast as they make it always has the perfect cheese and sauce ratio, their wings although not huge WingStop type wings but still had the perfect amount of sauce and were just so tender. However I must say after tonights visit I'm extremely dissapointed. The wings were no bigger than a quarter and cooked/microwaved to the point of being tough and our pizza was burned and overcooked sooo much the pizza soaked up all the sauce and you could barely tell cheese was even on it and oh were those pepperoni's or meat chips? I was so dissapointed I chose to eat ramen after a few awful bites that were quite a struggle to get down.

Let me just start off by saying that I recently had twins so on this day at this particular hour and it happened to be that they fell asleep. I had called the store and I was parked outside and I asked one of the ladies if I gave them exact cash which I had if they could bring me the pizza. 

The lady on the phone told me it was against their policy she said there was a mobile app that I could order from there. I asked her that if I order from the app since I parked right outside their doors if she could bring it to my car she said it was against their policy she can't leave the store with merchandise. So then I said OK will can you meet me at the door because I don't want to leave my kids in the car because they're asleep and their 10-month-old. She said and I quote ""ma'am I can't bring any merchandise outside but you are more than welcome to come inside and I can help you carry them out.""  Hmmmmm 

Soooo let me get this right! You want me to unload sleeping twins to walk inside with their car seats and you'll help me carry the pizza out? But!  I can't sit in my car and let my infants sleep and you bring it out???  Wow!!! 

It's against your policy to carry out pizza but! You can ""help"" me carry it out?

""We are have a issue we will opening late"" ok no problem I understand but it's noon your employees are sitting counting the drawer while I am at the locked door. Another women goes to the door as I'm leaving and knocks on the glass ""hey what time is late?"" Instead of answering her question or acknowledging her the employee runs to the back. You don't do online ordering or pick up or delivery. FAIL!!!!",GhlsfYxODYe1u1GdXvqyzw,1,0,1,veDbhfZR-NN5n_kiPPa6Ew
5213330,2014-09-27,1,909BaH47M7FfjbFniClm6Q,Horrible experience! Ordered a deep dish and a hot and ready. They made our deep dish And forgot to cook our wings once it was ready. So our deep dish sat there for 20min as we had to wait another 10-15 for our wings. To top it off the employees laughed at the whole thing blaming each other. Not an apology or any kind of sympathy. I'll drive a little further next time for better customer service. Hopefully no cold pizza this time. They also forgot our sauces. Horrible experience and customer service,-dDxic_xFDnPdO3LZIWLrg,1,0,1,9pbWye7hIaaKWYyW_aHXOw

5278151,2014-10-20,3,909BaH47M7FfjbFniClm6Q,"During Sunday Night Football, I shimmied on over to Little Caesars during half-time. Surprise, surprise, the line was out the door. I didn't mind though because I was expecting to walk into a madhouse. The line whittled down pretty quickly and I ordered my $5 hot-n-ready cheese pizza. The cashier was friendly and told me she was sorry but there would be a wait for my pizza. No worries! I swooped up an empty seat and 5 minutes later, BAM, my pizza was ready. You could say that since I had to wait, my pizza technically was not ""hot and ready"" as advertised. The upside was that my pizza was super fresh and hot right out of the oven.  

Yeah Little Caesars doesn't have the best pizza, but for $5 for a large pizza, there's really no room to complain. To boot, this Little Caesars has a great location. It's right next to a Baskin Robbins and a Starbucks across from the Smith's shopping center on Ann and Camino El Norte.",U-nR7ND8CDN2x8ia73CH2Q,2,1,3,X-ta9HqhXmp9XjYc2SYC1g

I asked why since the sign on the soda cooler states that from 11am until 2pm  Vets will receive a free $5.00 lunch.  She stated that her manager Diela stopped it and only allowed 30 free lunches.

The worker told me we don't offer those any more and ""what do you expect for a $6 pizza"". Less than mediocre pizza and low quality service screams avoid this place but at times I stop by purely out of the convenience of it being less than half a mile from my house and really cheap.",mGJQsSfg-HYHfFew2jGbRg,2,0,2,y5oJHFvfX8YfCQPAS7FSdA
