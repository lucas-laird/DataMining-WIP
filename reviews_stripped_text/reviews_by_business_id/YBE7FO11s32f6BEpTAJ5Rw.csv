The larger male server neglected are waters and only refilled them once when my mouth was on fire from my disgusting cocktail. The male at the fresh market was very unprofessional he put the meat my filet on top of all my veggies and some pieces fell out as I carried it get cooked. I went to grab my sauces and it was dripped all over the side, I was disgusted with the food thrown all over the place and the flys in the sauces. A very unpleasant time I had at my vist this time to the mixx, don't count on me and my friends EVER go back to this place. absolutely horrified with the restraunt I would rate it zero stars if I could. To anyone considering this restaurant I reccomend Kona Grill or Cheesecake before this place.",ZVqcimgU62mbdaDB0kjv4g,0,0,1,IuxuaS65lA4NLFv8KsDEqA

Picking out everything you'd like to be made to order right in front of you was amazing. The sirloin and shrimp were delicious!!!! And at such a great price. Be sure to come during their happy hour too. We were super impressed with the atmosphere and the food! Can't wait to go back again.,ct383jZrrbEbHGMyvr2-3g,0,0,5,FRtKwAUj_M3u20F5fJibcg

It was nothing short of amazing. 
My girlfriend and I stopped by the other night and there was live music- I think his name was Calvin? - amazing vocals and set the atmosphere. 
This place is beautiful. 
The attitudes of the staff were also very welcoming and helpful. 
The cocktails were phenomenal and beautifully presented on an interactive iPad. 
And the food. Mind- blowing. 
Everything seems to be done with a smile, precision, and perfection. We shared a few appetizers and each got our Mixx dishes which was a cool concept that accommodates different styles and my friend's allergy restrictions. Vegans welcome!
Needless to say, this is the coolest and most well-done place that Summerlin has seen in quite awhile.

203340,2016-11-28,1,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"THE MENU/OPTIONS KEEP CHANGING! For monetary reasons in the restaurant business I understand why the changes were made. But every visit our fave restaurant is fading more and more. 

We loved the premium meat in the special box presentation and I always ordered the filet mignon which was always perfectly cooked, juicy, and flavorful and that came with a medium market bowl. Not anymore. The premium meat box is gone and now the premium meats are full entree platters that come with....just vegetables?? No substituting (and apparently I was the only person to have asked that thus far) except for other veggies the chef has in the kitchen. They removed potatoes almost completely from the menu, except for the truffle fries (THANK GOD those are still there). I lament the loss of potatoes in the fresh market area. 

My husbands disappoint came with the moment he saw salmon was no longer offered at the market fresh bar but is rather a premium entree now which he hated that idea as ge wanted a salmon market fresh bowl and a filet mingnon- only available if he bought two premium entrees AND a market bowl to mix all together himself. Also he always got the buckwheat noodles which are gone and instead have thin rice noodles and other Asian based carbs except for fettuccine noodles. Another let down for my husband at first but he did enjoy the rice noodles after he tried it. 

My saddest moment was the realization the chef at the grill no longer tastes as he cooks, leading to my fettuccine alfredo sauce dish to be incredibly bland. The sauce was thin, greasy, and tasteless after grilling- what happened to the creaminess? The cook also was always previously very friendly and would talk to us while we watched him cook for fun, this time as I stood there watching he looked at me as if to say ""need something??"" Also, my husband got cod fish and tilapia in his bowl effectively causing my dish to taste fishy (something I GREATLY dislike since I don't eat seafood).

*staff was nice and attentive. 
*delicious dessert despite never getting my exact combination request - they really should write those orders down. 
*warm yummy bread and salted butter
*drinks were a little rough with the mixtures the first round, but got better as the night went on...or maybe it was the buzz we were getting.",gxTIOq4i9WsKfE0DGiNhjw,2,1,3,HU4LqON-1Rj0Bb3wjF_4aA

318612,2016-07-13,0,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"I decided to take my wife out to a nice dinner, we have two little ones so kind of a rarity these days, and we wanted to check out the new restaurant The Mixx Grill in Boca Park. WOW, what a beautiful new gem in this area!!! All details in this restaurant have been thought of and is a very sleek, lively and fun. 

The appetizer selections are diverse and well thought out yet absolutely delicious (we had the crab & shrimp sliders as well as the calamari). For dinner my wife ordered the delicious shrimp entrée off the ""Chef's Favorites"" while I opted to order off the ""Fresh Market"". Let me tell you, what a refreshing concept to build your own dish. The options that are available are absolutely amazing and a great value. I had the Prime Rib Cap but there are other incredible options like Japanese A5 Kobe, Alaskan King crab legs, just to name a couple. Although these items are a premium charge, they are a fraction of what you would pay on the strip or other ""high end"" restaurants, an unbelievable value to have these options in our local neighborhood! My rib cap was phenomenal as expected (always the best steak on any menu in my opinion) and was complimented well with basmati rice and the amazing fresh vegetables. 

Next, the most important part of any restaurant is the staff. Everyone was incredibly polite, professional, and friendly from the moment we walked in the door. The hostess Alyssa was immediately attentive. Our server Mariah was always cheerful and informative. Other staff members, Tara and Troy, were helpful when Mariah was busy with other guests. It was the kind of service you would expect from a restaurant that was open for years, yet they've only been open a few weeks. This can not be overstated, in my opinion, because the way the staff makes guests feel is truly what brings people back. Great job, staff at The Mixx Grill, we really appreciate the service. 

I highly recommend The Mixx Grill, the new treasure in Boca Park. And we congratulate the ownership and staff for orchestrating such a great new fun concept for our local community. We can't wait to try the food again and watch this restaurant evolve for years to come.",j_U4GPBugQe4BCXdyVKklg,1,0,5,GFUGyFtmDEzDp_0j2OdAag

Sliced cheese from some local grocery store, cheap brand, the bread we had looked like toasted Wonder bread. same toasted bread came with the bruchetta..completely soggy. The chicken wraps were not good at all. Below average, you could tell the sauces came out of some cheap brand jar. Chicken tasted like it came in a pre-made frozen meal. I was excited for the bacon wrapped dates...I really wanted to like it, it was way too sweet, it was just not good. Dessert was dry. We did not like one single item we ordered. Our waiter was great..really nice guy, but the food was less than mediocre. It's too bad because the decor was beautiful, ambiance was nice except for people walking through the restaurant with their paintings. I just had this feeling that the owners know they are in trouble, so they are trying to save money by buying cheap ingredients, hoping that all of Las Vegas won't be able to notice.",YO1XHa6bsleAiaMKDbsoxg,0,0,1,v68LIpZRTvjONbRhChAbNg

I ordered a signature drink, it was ok but not as good as it should have been for the price. Then I was handed the menu... the menu I was looking at looked nothing like the menu I saw online and basically the reason we came in. But, we were there and decided to make the most of it. The risotto was great as were the brussels sprouts. The steaks were good too, the sea bass eh, so so. We had to ask for the asparagus that was supposed to come with the steak, when the sides got there, there were 3 skinny pieces and 1 person didn't get theirs at all.

798225,2017-02-20,1,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"If I was able to give this place a -0 stars, I would. This dining establishment is HIGHLY misleading from their website. Based on the first line from their own website under ""Our Story"", they wrote ""We wanted to create a place that would bring world class dining with a welcome atmosphere to the Las Vegas""...THEY FAILED! This was our first time going to this establishment and we were expecting far more than what we got based on their website description! From the fact they didn't have the first 3 items in a row that were offered to us and we inquired about (sparkling water, Jameson Whiskey and salmon) to the lack of empathy and customer service from the Manager, Carlotta (I think that was her name). She never came to our table on her own after our nice waiter told her of our not too pleased dining experience that we were having. Not knowing who was the Manager, WE saw a woman dressed differently than the waiters walking by us and inquired if she was the Manager. When she stated she was, I asked her if she was made aware by our kind waiter of the issues we were having at our table. She replied she had been advised and offered free drinks. When I advised her she doesn't have the drinks we want, she just said ""Sorry"" and walked off. At this point, we already had eaten the overly salty Calamari (because we were starving) and not once did she offer to comp at least our appetizer as an optional gesture. 

As briefly mentioned, the only great experience we encountered was from the very kind waiter, Minh. He was immediately apologetic and almost personally embarrassed by the fact that he had to on 3 separate occasions, come and let us know they did not have what he thought they did have. They're very fortunate to have him and hopes the Manager can take some lessons from him on how to provide EXCELLENT customer service.

We decided we would only have a couple appetizers here and then go have actual dinner somewhere else. That turned out to be a very bad decision as well. We ordered the Calamari and Artichoke & Spinach Dip. The Calamari was very salty and the Artichoke & Spinach Dip was atrociously repulsive and the tortilla chips it was served with were stale! Needless to say, we did not finish the dip and quickly asked for the check. Our waiter, and NOT the Manager, strongly requested because of this horrible dining experience, that our Groupon not be redeemed. He fought for us based on lack of customer satisfaction which we appreciated! 

The food was so bad that I literally got sick shortly into dinner at the next location and I'm still dealing with an upset stomach from the two appetizers. This place is a disgrace to the word RESTAURANT and should close PERMANENTLY!",WVo6pkwuIRdCUS-N42U3sg,5,0,1,edQhqfSGnTab99p2hSQMPA

Happy hour items are $4.77. We got the bruschetta (AMAZING- my group hasn't stopped talking about it), Mini burgers (They come with 2 and fries, actually are ""mini"" so don't plan on sharing if you're hungry but they had great flavor) and truffle fries (absolutely delicious). 

Overall our waitress outside was super sweet, the managers were european men that stopped by the table and they were very accommodating- treated us like family, and the hostess was adorable. Bus boy was very attentive to refilling water and their attention to detail on the share plates/cutlery was equal or better to the training at some of the top restaurants I've worked at on the strip.

I dropped in for a quick happy hour bite to check The Mixx out after reading about their grand opening in The Review-Journal. Folks, let me tell you, they've got it going on over there! 

The vibe is awesome, loved the music (a chill/house combination at the perfect volume), every member of the staff greeted me and made me feel like they were glad I was there. The decor and ambience was amazing, I really don't know how they pulled off such a perfect combination of high-end casual but they did. When you see the interior and the menu, you expect you're plate prices to be at least three times what they are. This is the first gourmet restaurant that I can see coming to more than once a week. 

I tried the hummus, since I was just snacking, and, being a hummus aficionado, it was honestly the best I've had. The portion was easily for three, so I took the rest home and my dad loved it too, and it was served with perfectly crisp cucumbers, roasted and then chilled carrots and sourdough toast. Wow. All on the happy hour menu too. Even though he knew I wasn't there for dinner my server, Joshua, gave me the VIP treatment and menu explanation. He even brought their unique, back-lit protein case over to my table and showed me all the options for my next meal. Impressive, to say the least.  Colorado lamb, here I come. I watched some other guests navigate the food bar, great concept btw, picking your own gourmet creation, and then enjoyed watching the chef toss and steam and creat their bowl on the huge iron they have as the restaurant centerpiece.

Joshua was kind and extremely knowledgable, made for a fun food-learning experience and definitely left me anticipating my next visit. The hostess even held the door for me as I left and invited me back with a genuine smile. Found my new favorite spot! Thanks, Mixx!",ETR8i7xUDI4ivSvAsNc_tA,0,0,5,wFxMI4PIiq_kLZaw3ZZxRA
1118387,2017-01-30,1,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"I don't even know where to begin about this place. Easily and without question, one of - if not THE - worst dining experience I've ever had anywhere, let alone in Las Vegas. First and foremost, this is NOT a new concept. These Mongolian grill places have been around since the early 90s (see BDs Mongolian Grill for example). We wanted to come here because of the great Yelp reviews, but after our experiences, I'm convinced that the glowing reviews are fake.

We came in with a group of 6 for dinner on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately in the back of the restaurant, which afforded us a tour through the dining room which quickly revealed that the place was essentially empty; I'd say less than 20% of capacity. That alone should have been our first tip.

The service throughout the meal was ridiculous. At one point we genuinely wondered if we were being Punk'd or something similar, it was so bad. Server would try and take a drink order, but forgot his note pad. Then he went to get that, but forgot his pen. Left again and came back, to take our orders and went through the table. No joke, guy came back to the table 3 more times to clarify what people ordered. A) We ordered off their cocktail menu; B) Didn't you just write it down guy?!

Drinks arrive, and it was a universal reaction after a toast . . . a look of bewilderment and puzzle came to everyones face. The drinks were generally awful. Little alcohol, too many mixers/ingredients, and a complete disregard for basic mixology (given the name, we expected a LOT better). We all switched to beer or wine for round 2 to avoid further disgust from the bar.

The appetizers come out and are mediocre at best. A check in from the server goes something like this:

Server: how is everything?
Me: Eh, its just okay.
Server: Excellent! (turns and walks away)
Me: ???

My wife ordered off the menu, and went for the ""king crab"" fried rice. She couldn't even eat it. The rice bordered on raw, with a disturbing amount of soy sauce, and the crab was so over cooked, I think you could have used it as a toothpick. She clearly didn't eat her food and our server, was of course, completely oblivious. The rest of us ordered the ""buffet"" (which truth be told, is really what it is), and it was generally fine, though what do you expect when you basically make it yourself?

I think the absolute worst part of the whole thing though was the ""entertainment."" On a Saturday night, 8:00pm, they brought out a ""comedian"" and a singer. The singer was fine, and if she were the only act, it probably would have been okay. But this ""comedian"" was atrocious. Completely and utterly atrocious. In a span of about 45 minutes, we heard the same bit at least 3 times. None of it was even remotely funny. And unfortunately, his attempts at humor required him to stoop to raw vulgarity and derogatory jokes. There were several kids in the restaurant, and you could see the disgust on the parents faces. Several tables were complaining and got up and left, and the dining room was mostly empty by the time we were finally able to get our bill and get out.

All in, we paid about $100 for mediocre service, average food, and horrible ambiance. Hoping this place shutters quickly so we can get a legitimate restaurant in here quickly.",M_JB5tiXDnpoBTXYwzyIvQ,4,0,1,j3SukhIUy7Rkj28SIUGGvQ

There are rice/other starches, veggies, proteins and sauces.  One of the staffers puts the ingredients you chose into the bowl and it's taken over to a huge flat grill where the chef cooks it.  The food was very fresh.  Although the regular bowl is a little pricey at $19.99, we decided to try it again this past Tuesday.  First, it was a very warm night and glass doors were open to the patio.  There were fans on but it was a little too warm.  The food on the food bar was a little wilted.  The young man (may have been a manager) was the one to get our bowls together.  But he didn't seem to know the food.  There were two bowls of meat with a tag that said lamb and a tag to the side that said sirloin.  I asked for sirloin and he took from the bowl in back of the sign for lamb but I assumed he knew better.  It did turn out to be lamb which I ate but would have rather had the sirloin.  When it came to the sauces, I am limited, cannot have cream based sauces.  I saw a sign for balsamic vinaigrette but didn't see anything that looked like it.  I asked if they had it and he proceeded to a container of creamy yellowish dressing.  I said no I wanted balsamic and he looked at the sign and started to scoop it up again.  I said no again, that isn't balsamic and I can't have the cream based dressing but he started to give me a taster anyway.  I ended up with teriyaki, the only non-cream based sauce.  This is important to know if you are vegan or have dairy issues, that choices are limited.  It was frustrating that he had no clue.  We did go on to have an enjoyable evening; wait staff was great, water constantly refilled.  A man I assume was the general manager breezed through, asked how everyone was doing and turned the fans up.  However, after one of my friends noticed that her bill had been rounded to an even amount.  I didn't take my receipt but I had the same as her and realized mine was the same even amount.  She contacted our friend who found her total was rounded up.  It wasn't a lot but that is not cool.  If there was some promotion, it wasn't communicated so any round up was unauthorized.  There are too many good options in town to bother going back there or recommending the place to anyone else which I did initially.

Grand Opening: June 18, 2016!

I was invited as a guest for tonight's special event before their grand opening. The servers, bartenders, chefs, and hostesses delivered top-notch service and attention to all their guests. Our server, Kristen, was extremely gracious and proud to be part of The Mixx.

World-influenced food: They have 28 appetizers with international fusion and a strong French influence. 

Their dining concept is very unique - they have a full-service bar where you can create your own entree. This is separated in three sections: the grains, veggies, and proteins. After you make your own selection, you arrive at their main centerpiece  -""The Iron."" Renowned chefs will cook your meal as you wish and you are a spectator of a culinary show.

As for the cocktails, I tried the Elixir which comes in a copper pineapple vessel served over ice! The Mixx has a tablet which showcases the details of each cocktail and beverage. There is an option to invent your own cocktail. 

Chef Ogden and JP Teresi has set the bar high - this will be one of Vegas' premiere dining spots for locals. Highly sophisticated with local vibes!",cGok9ycGn_HvZaht9xkyPw,44,37,5,zim-m84nXfAdgVBN1bFPdw
1531203,2017-03-28,8,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"The Mixx is a mix of several different dining options: part bar with HH specials and live music, part sit-down dinner with upscale steak and seafood entrees, and part build-your-own-bowl (and dessert!) setup not unlike a Mongolian grill. All menu prices inexplicably end in .77, for another (unnecessary) added gimmick. The atmosphere and decor are classy but the concept is muddled. 

HH: Food specials are limited to about five dishes all priced at $4.77(?), which isn't that great of a deal when the dishes are bruschetta, truffle fries, and hummus. Their regular menu is pricey. The bacon wrapped dates and sliders (pair) on HH are decent deals, and the burgers especially were cooked just right so they were nice and juicy! I'll be getting them again.
BUILD YOUR OWN: The ""regular"" size portion is huge, like share-it huge. I dined in with a friend and she went to the buffet area to mix up a variety of carbs (noodles!), proteins (including shrimp and lamb), veggies, and sauces. It's one of those things where your food is as good as you make it. As others suggest, it'd be great if they had some go-to combos listed on the menu to pick from (scampi sauce + shrimp + tomatoes + spinach + mushrooms over your carb of choice, for example). 
REGULAR MENU: The coconut lemongrass mussels are worth a shot. The creamy broth is amazing, similar to a tom kha soup, but with mussels. Portion looked large but we got a few empty shells and a couple that were tiny and/or dried out, which was somewhat less than appropriate considering the $18 price tag, but that broth was damn delicious. 
DESSERT: What the hell. Another build-it-yourself thing. They currently have a Yelp check in offer to get your dessert for free ($8 value), so do it. The brown butter tart with vanilla bean ice cream, strawberry preserves, caramel drizzle, and candied hazelnuts was frickin' awesome. Again, portions are huge, and even sharing didn't take down this treat. This is actually one of the rare places I'd insist on getting dessert when I return.

Service even at the bar is pretty friendly. This space is huge and they kind of seem to be doing a little too much under one roof, but the food is tasty enough to come back for.

1966579,2016-10-23,0,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"Discovered this place because this is where Gordon Biersch use to be in Boca Park. I was a bit upset at first because The Mixx took over the space of one of my favorite bars in Vegas, but after my first visit I was sure glad The Mixx took over. This place is amazing!!! The cocktails there are works of art. You can truly see and taste the amount of hard work that go les into every single cocktail made there. The food: BEST SLIDERS I'VE EVER HAD. Pink in the middle, juicy, bursting with flavor, and apart of their awesome happy hour. The bacon wrapped dates, I have to be honest, fell short. Good, just not great. 

The drinks are amazing, the food is amazing, but the one thing that truly stands out is the service. Joshua, who I'm assuming is one of the managers there, has superior customer service skills. During the first visit there he took the time to explain the concept of The Mixx and one-by-one described their signature cocktails. Coming from a customer service background, I can tell when someone is just going through the motions and when someone is passionate and sincere about what they do. You can truly see the passion Joshua has and his dedication to providing the best customer experience. Bravo sir! 

My lady and I have deemed The Mixx one of our go-to spots at night. On our second visit we went in for only drinks, but they were closing down early for the night due to the wind and slow business. Instead of turning us away, Christa, said she'd gladly serve us and to take our time. I know how frustrating that can be to be on the verge of going home and then have to service last minute customers. Never once did she try to rush us away or have anything less than a bubbly attitude. What an amazing bartender and she makes an awesome whiskey sour!

1981772,2016-08-19,1,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"This place is located in Boca Park right next to The Cheesecake Factory, it has outside seatings, a lounge/bar area, tables along the wall and more tables in the back, behind the big grill in the middle. 

Came here for the first time today, I liked the concept and thought it was interesting. First off, our waitress was very friendly, very attentive, and very helpful with the menu. She greeted us as soon as we were sat, got us water, and explained the menu to us. Our drinks were constantly refilled, dirty plates were instantly picked up, service was on point. 

We ordered the Mai Ti Tai that was served in a Tiki cup, this drink was very tasty. We also shared: Truffle fries, Chicken Lettuce Wrap and Steak Tartar. The fries and wrap were delicious, the steak tartar was bland and was nothing special. The presentation of these dishes were perfect, the dishes came out looking very fancy and delicious. 

The main entree is the problem. So the idea is that you choose your meat or seafood, a sauce, and your veggies and choice of rice or noodles or pasta (pretty much the same concept as Genghis Grill). I thought that the base (rice, pasta or noodles) will be served separately, and the meat and veggies will be cooked together and served on the side. They stir-fried everything together! I ordered the Filet Mignon with peppercorn sauce and a few different veggies, this came out to be a big wet mess. While their appetizers were presented so beautifully, the entree were simply scooped up from the grill and thrown on the plate, you can clearly see there was no effort on the presentation of the main dish. The sauce was very bland, could barely taste anything. There was too much sauce on the dish so the entire plate was very wet. Mine was missing three veggies that I asked for (baby bok choy, broccoli, and cauliflower) and my friend's dish was missing cauliflower and broccoli, we asked for it and the veggies were brought to us on a separate plate. However, the broccoli and cauliflower were mashed up and served mixed together instead of being served as a whole (I posted pics)...this was disgusting. The mixture was bland and watery..and since it was not mixed with the rest of the ingredients its was just gross. 

Disclaimer!!! The manager stopped by and apologized for the veggies being left out, which was not a big deal to us. We simply asked for it and left it alone. At the end of our meal, the manager brought out 3 desserts, which was so unnecessary since it was not a big deal. But this was very kind of them to give us the desserts. 

When we asked for our check, we were told that the desserts were rang in but was then comped off at the bottom. When the waitress split our checks for us, we were charged for the dessert. We probably waited an extra 10 minutes for the manager to correct the checks. They then gave each of us a coupon for 2 free drinks the next time to stop by. 

I would definitely come back to this place because the drink was really good and the appetizers were delicious, also service was very nice, they also have happy hour. They are still new so the mistakes in service are understandable, not a big deal at all. BUT I do not like their  entrees! They should probably just serve the rice and noodles on the side, or give that as an option instead of everything being mixed together. I can't comment on how my friends' felt about their dishes, but neither one of us finished our meal. The entree was a big disappointment.",7svBs9qqPJHPRXZ56Q3ZuQ,0,0,3,F-6Z_a30B7MVSIOI-mbaoA

This establishment look like a place that would have exceptional food and great service, but it was our experience while dinning there it was one of total disappointment. Our hostess seem not to to happy to sit us, not sure if it was because it was close to closing. We order from the market fresh option in the menu which promised a larger variety of meats(sirloin, various fish, chicken, crab, etc), vegetables and grains but to our disappointment once we got to the food bar we wore told  the only option left wore fish (tilapia) or chicken and both of this items look like they been there for quite sometime . Not to nation that the gentleman ( who seem to be a member of management) who  help us had the same none-welcome attitude of our hostess. After serving us he send us on our way to get our food cook by the only welcoming individual in this place ""the cook"", who need to get a bit cleaning up to make the interaction of client and staff a bit more presentable ?. To add insult  the overpriced teriyaki bold that we wore handed back was a total let down on the  promises of a fresh nutritions meal, for the simple fact that a frozen TV dinner would have taste better in my opinion. Let's just say after paying for our $65 check, lessons learned!

2113486,2016-08-30,15,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"You know, I hadn't really thought much about it, but Boca Park was lacking a fine dining experience. Mixx fills that void, but without breaking the bank. This review is only for their happy hour, but between the atmosphere, food, and service, I hope they do well. 

I'd received a coupon for 2 complimentary well cocktails with no purchase necessary, so I wanted to high tail it over there to use them before they expired. I noticed that Mixx also had happy hour between 2:30-6:30 (and a reverse happy hour as well), so I figured a bite would help soak up the alcohol.

The space is gorgeous. It consists of a standard patio area with misters on the outside, but the inside is sleek and modern, dark woods, reds and blacks. They have a huge cast iron skillet in the middle where you can watch the chef prepare your meat, and a ""bar"" of meats and accoutrements for you to select to craft your meal. As I was not getting a full dinner, this wasn't necessarily of interest to me that night, but it was pretty cool to see.

Joshua, one of the managers, was fantastic, and gave me and my party a full tour of the space and explained the concept of Mixx. Apparently, they will bring in DJs and have dancing on Friday and Saturday nights as well. I'm a sucker for dancing, and there's nothing like that in Summerlin, so I will definitely be back for that!

After our tour, we settled in for happy hour noshing. Although there are only 4-5 items on the happy hour menu, the 3 we sampled were excellent. The 2 mini burgers were just enough food to be satisfying, had great flavor, were juicy and delicious. I was expecting only a few fries with them, but they came with a pretty decent serving of thin cut French fries. The truffle fries we also ordered were a bit unnecessary given the fries with the burger, but also tasty (to our server's credit, she did try to warn us!) My friend got the hummus, and it was a large serving, with pita bread and veggies. I'm not big on hummus, but he enjoyed it. Oh! The bread they served before the meal was fantastic- warm, soft, and doughy, just the way I like it!  Our drinks were well prepared.

Service was a tiny bit spotty, sometimes it was very attentive, and other times, there were long gaps. Most noticeably, getting our bill took quite a long time. Other than that, Kat and the service staff were great! 

I'm interested in trying a full meal at Mixx, and definitely returning for a night with a DJ. I'll certainly return for happy hour again!",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,29,26,5,pkesM76sQujRU6o1qj4wPA

2220863,2016-09-09,5,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"Talk about different concept for restaurant. Not sure if seen something like The Mixx Grill and Lounge before or recall. The restaurant is not much different then other high end restaurants/lounge. The difference starts get seated there this huge circle flat top and then whole line of individual ingredients laid out really nice on ice. It was my first time so had no idea. I like this is going be interesting. You get the menu again throws you off. The DIFFERENT concept is you basically build your own side and dessert. Two parts too the menu one half has your list of appetizers. It nice long list with good diversity. Soups and Salads. The second part is the Fresh Market or build your own side. The way that works you make as many selections form each section start with Sauces, From the Earth, Land, or Ocean. Also have Premium section offers more proteins choose from but since Premium paying more for them. I do like the way they present the premium section to the table. At first thinking cigar box because literally looks like one or tea box. Once our server open the box really fancy high end display of  all the premium products. The desserts work the same way build your own except without the fanfare of premium box. LOL!!

I came with friends. We ordered couple different appetizers. I ordered one of the build your own sides. I went with the soy and ginger vinaigrette, spinach, baby bok choy, basmati rice, zucchini, chicken breast. It was ok. It NOT at all eye appealing. Is kind of ironic everything else is very much fine dining and very well presented on plates. Reality is build your own side is stir fry. The portion size for the money is great deal. I would recommend less is better comes to choosing your components. If order side the side share so can get taste more of the menu. I only had room for the roasted tomato bruschetta. It was good. The desserts were very good. We tried four different ones forgot the names. Each one stood out. The service was awesome. Our waiter was on it all night. The food nothing that wow me.

The lounge area is pretty cool. Out front they have patio area in Boca Park. They got huge wide screens. I could see myself hanging out at the lounge on HH checking out game. The food not so much cause nothing stood out for me.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,7,3,0BsHPxTUsk4ckyd_r0pMBw

Our server was very friendly and offered helpful suggestions. You get an iPad for the drink menu, which was pretty cool. Unlike most photos of food/drinks ours actually looked just like pictures - beautiful. I had a mango drink with a side shot of champagne. It was fresh and delicious! For appetizers we tried the sliders snd bruschetta and both were the perfect size to satisfy, but not spoil your meal and very tasty. The dinner concept here is what drew us to the location. You choose all your own ingredients from a fresh display of meats, vegetables, pasta/rice, and sauces. The employees were helpful in offering suggestions so you craft s delicious dinner. We chose filet and shrimp and we ate beyond being full because it was so good!! If you know what you want, your waitress can get it for you so you don't ever have to leave your seat. We wanted the full experience so we chose them and watched/waited while it was prepared. After dinner we had a cocktail like no other.

2302886,2016-11-05,3,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"This concept of this place is really interesting; the execution could have been a little more delicious. 

This had quite the date night atmosphere, low lighting, and a classy vibe. I felt a little under-dressed but nothing notable. The person who sat us almost forgot to ask if we had ever been there, but he remembered last minute and was able to explain how to do things. Happy hour is limited; I got a house white wine, bacon wrapped dates, and truffle fries from that menu and a medium bowl so I could experience all they had to offer. 

They have what looks like a buffet, and you grab a bowl, and they cook everything you can fit in your size bowl on a giant circular slab.  Well, that's how it was explained. In reality, THEY grab a bowl for you and carefully portion everything you want. So the whole tagline of ""you can have as much as you want as long as it fits in your bowl"" is slightly dishonest, They have many sauces, I tried soy ginger which was fun. I opted to watch the chef cook my food, and that was entertaining, but they do have the option of delivering it back to your table. 

I wish that they had a menu of ""favorite combos"" or something. It wasn't delicious,  but I am sure it COULD have been had I chosen the correct combination. 

The truffle fries were average, and I am glad I tried them during happy hour because otherwise, they would be highly overpriced. The bacon wrapped dates were my favorite thing. I even ate all the decorative lettuce under them! If they had added more lettuce and whatever sauce was on them it could become a salad that I would come back for!

Until then, it was eh. I'd come back if I had friends in town that wanted to feel like they were trying something that was unique.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,7,6,3,epgEZ-fP7MGrYiq64IF5Fg

Especially when you have friends get together for Happy Hour.  It is the worst tapas ever!!!
We ordered bruschetta, it was okay., stuffed mushrooms.  Omg, I have never seen anyone served me stuffed mushrooms on button mushrooms.  They normally prepared it with portobello mushrooms right?

It was a great day to sit outside, but the table we sat at was the smallest 4-too I have seen. Thank goodness we were only 2.
The stir fry menu was out of chicken thighs, shrimp and lo mein noodles. 
They had no black iced tea and just substituted  tropic green iced tea in an Arnold Palmer we ordered without checking with us.
Happy hour bruschetta had whole blistered grape tomatoes, which I enjoyed but my husband did not.
Tartare for $13.77 had a tablespoon or less of tuna and blah taste. Crab cake seemed like pre packaged frozen with not enough sauce.
Server was nice, but seemed very inexperienced and untrained. No good info on menu and did not offer another drink even when glass was empty

We waited about 5 minutes before the hostess brought us waters and said the server would be there shortly. It was another 5 minutes before our server got there and said ""sorry about the wait. Do you guys want anything besides water?"" We asked what beers they had on tap since the cocktail menu only had overpriced mixed drinks listed. He named off a few beers including a ""sriracha ale."" My boyfriend was intrigued because he likes to try weird beers so he asked what it was. The server told us it was a local brew, so he got it. He liked it, but couldn't figure out why it was called sriracha ale, so I googled it. It's actually Sorachi Ale and it's from Brooklyn. He said Sriracha and we said Sriracha multiple times. The dude clearly had no idea. 

We ordered salads and about 5 minutes later ordered a fish n chips. The salads came at the same time as the meal another 15 or so minutes later. I ordered a salad before my food so if get it before. He didn't even acknowledge that the salads took 20 minutes and that they came out with our food. The fish was pretty good, but the fries looked like something you get in the middle school cafeteria. They were clearly frozen crinkle cut fries. 

The beer was $10 for a 16 oz, which is insane. You can get a 22oz on the strip for cheaper. And like I said, the cocktails were way over priced. 

The atmosphere was super weird. I don't even know how to describe it besides saying I was happy I was outside watching football on a projector with low sound because the ambiance inside had an eery feel. Not to mention the strange outfits the staff wore....

My boyfriend and I ordered a shrimp cocktail, potstickers, mushroom risotto, deviled eggs, rolled street tacos, and the shrimp scampi. Let me start by saying I wouldn't order a single item again. 
The shrimp cocktail was the best, simply because the sauce had a horseradish flavor. That's it. 
The rolled tacos, were not at all rolled tacos. It was one big chimichanga that tasted similar to the ones you get for $1 in the frozen section of Albertsons. The pot stickers were also at one time frozen, and then covered in a sauce that probably came from a jar. The shrimp scampi didn't have garlic, lemon, or wine in the flavor so I'm pretty confused on what was there other that shrimp, butter, and noodles. The mushroom risotto legit had cheddar in it. It reminded me of that packaged broccoli/cheddar rice. Honestly everything here had somewhat of a packaged taste to it. And if I have to talk about the deviled eggs, let's just say they sat on the table after trying one. 
Halfway through our meal a middle age man who looked like a manager came in. He seemed arrogant and cocky, and my other half and I both looked at each other with the face of- ""ohhhh it all makes sense now"". It's unfortunate that people like to cut costs and overcharged in hopes to be successful. Other than a decent staff and a few good drinks, I'm not sure what this place has going for them.

My Husband and I frequently dined in at Gordon Biersch, and were very sad to see it go. Every time we would drive past The Mixx, we always said ""we have to try it out sometime"" We enjoy going to Tapas restaurants, and we love this area, so we gave it a try. 1st of all, it was a Saturday night during dinner time. We walk in, and the entire place is completely empty. After we were sat down at a table, I asked my Husband if we made a wrong choice. He said ""let's just stay and try it"" so I did. We were waiting for our drinks and it seemed like customers were coming in to look at the menu and walked out. There was a male (I'm guessing he was a manager) seemed to practically almost beg to have customers stay and dine in. Then a man (I believe is the owner) walks in looking and acting like an angry, coked out Tony Montana, He seems to be angry at something. He yelled because the manager couldn't force people to stay and dine in. He storms towards the bar, chugs his drink and slams his glass on the bar, and rudely says something to the bartender. Then he goes to sit at a table towards the back next to the cook. As time went on, a few customers came in to dine. The owner continuously gets up, and is yelling at his employees and also cursing at them, in front of customers. Some of the staff would even talk back to them and roll their eyes as they were walking away from him. I'm sorry, but I think raising your voice and cussing employees out in front of customers is extremely unprofessional. He's lucky my kids weren't in there with us to hear him. I would have just walked out. Then at one point, as he was sitting next to the cook, he started throwing POP-ITS at the cook, while he was cooking. He then, stood up and started throwing them across the room and threw them at the Manager and our waitress. I couldn't believe what I was watching. It was completely awkward. It was also awkward when he chose to yell at our waitress just before she came to our table. THE FOOD- the food was OKAY. Definitely not worth the prices. Some of the tapas were burnt and way over salted. I'm just sad to say, I'm glad they got shut down. They were shut down for not having running hot water for a long period of time. Many other demerits were added, just enough to permanently shut the entire restaurant down.",6LBJNnqGO33y3wXFY7x45Q,0,0,1,CbrtnDWMJqfRpjyTmHsBww

I should add I'm pregnant and while eating well cooked seafood isn't bad in and of itself, having raw shrimp could have serious consequences. To be translucent they did refund us the shrimp (after I insisted they do so), but to me this doesn't makeup for the experience. 

Overall, they are lucky to still have their doors open and I wouldn't be sad to see them closed permanently. Seems like they need a little visit from health inspectors.",9m8TgBpmcZOscIPnHCSgNw,2,1,1,bMUskz8dm_vtOlomwPdCIQ
2641399,2016-07-09,2,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"My husband and I decided to try this place out. The place looks great but the experience not so great. We were extremely dissapointed and these are the reasons why;

1) The young lady that was serving our table, seemed as if she was brand new to serving tables. Not that theres anything wrong with that, because we were all new to a job at some point, but it made our experience kind of sour. 

2) She kept forgetting what we had ordered, and did not even bother to explain to us how the menu worked until we asked her if she could help us understand the concept. Even after she explained it to us, she made no sense and we were still confused. Another server noticed we were still puzzled and she came over to our table to thoroughly explain the process. 

3) When we went up to the bowl bar, or whatever you call it, they were very limited on ingredients and they had also ran out of some. Now this to me was unacceptable, as it was a friday night and the place was basically empty. They should have been well stocked. The servers at the actual bowl bar were very quiet. They did help me pick out some delicious sauces though. When we finally went down the bowl bar preparing our bowl to be cooked, they placed the raw meat on top of all my other ingredients. That to me was a big no no. Yes i know it's my personal preference to have raw meat separate from my other ingredients, even if its going to be cooked all together, but they should have at least asked if i would have preferred it separate. 

4) When we returned back to the table we asked our server if she could recommend any fruity sweet drinks. We also asked for jack and coke, and rosé.  She recommended two drinks, a coconut one and a pineapple. This time she actually talked about the drinks and told us that the coconut one was her favorite and that they were so good. I love coconut so when she was raving about how great it was we said ok lets get that......big mistake. Both the coconut drink and the pineapple drink were extremely watered down. There was not even a hint of coconut flavor in that drink and the pineapple drink was also watered down. Now when she went to pour the rosé in the glass, only a tablespoon of rosé came out. She had served us from a bottle that was nearly empty and she did not even notice. She did return back with a new bottle and served the rest. 

5) After we had sat down and ate our food she asked us if we wanted some dessert, and silly old me asked if she had a recommendation, again. Well she recommended the cream puff and i got it with a citrus sauce and mango sorbet. Let me just say, that again, we were disappointed. the only good thing about that dessert was the mangos sorbet and the cream that goes inside the cream puff. the rest was not good at all. 

6) After being extremely disappointed with the service we received, she comes to our table and provides us with the check. She walks away and we open up the check book. As we are trying to figure out how we will split the bill between my husband and our three guests, she comes back to our table and apologizes and takes the check book out our hand and says that she forgot to charge us for our bowls. we all looked at each other and just couldn't believe that this was all happening. Then she asked us, "" do you remember what size bowls you guys had?"".......really? weren't you supposed to know that info? any who she went back and charged us for the bowls we had ordered and gave us the correct receipt this time.  

Had it not been for the very disappointing service that we received, i would have given them a higher rating. What i can say is that our bowls and our appetizers were very very good. And the  chefs were extremely nice. If i had to rate this place based on their food, I would have given it a 4 star rating. Not 5 because the dessert sucked

I think the concept of this place is great, the place looks beautiful. I think that if they would focus more on properly training their employees to deliver better customer service, this place would do great. I think right now they are just focusing on having beautiful looking people working there.

We started off with happy hour at the bar - until 6:30 by our calculations, although there is no official happy hour menu given.  We had half off wine, and a half price bacon-wrapped dates appetizer that was spectacular!  However, we watched the bartenders complain about whether they or a waitress were assigned to a large table (worried about tipping apparently), and it took three bartenders to make a specialty drink not on the happy hour menu for the same table while ignoring the rest of the bar customers.
Our dinner, however, once we were seated at a table, was awesome!  Our server Abraham explained the concept and the higher priced specialty cuts/portions right away.  We opted for regular bowls, and headed to the Fresh Market bar.  My only bummer was that they were out of scallops at 7 pm on a Saturday, and I didn't find out until I had made half my bowl.  Substituted lamb and tasted a couple sauces to make my choice, and we were off to the grill!  The grilling was perfect, and the topping of crumbs/pine nuts was delicious.  My hubs had just meat and potatoes/rice, and loved it!  The manager brought by some desserts also - a must have for the next trip.

3104883,2017-08-05,0,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"Oh boy. Where to start. I had pretty high hopes for this trendy little eatery conveniently located in Boca Park. I was feeling in the mood for a little upscale environment with unique menu options and crafty cocktails. All signs pointed to The Mixx and even after some questionable Yelp reviews I decided to give it a chance. 
So the skinny of it is:

Great location, and cool environment - however, they are completely missing the mark. It was a Friday night, and we had the restaurant practically to ourselves - which is never a good sign. 
The food menu was a bit boring and we settled for a variety of apps. (Truffle Fries, Mini Burgers, and Bacon Wrapped Cream Cheese Stuffed Dates)  They were a bit on the pricey side so we were hoping the size of the apps would compensate for this. Sadly we were mistaken. 
The cocktails were just TOO much. We were briefed on their specialty cocktail which comes in a cool pineapple cup (SOLD!)  but then they go further and put some herbs in it, then light it on fire, then dust it with poprocks - I shit you not, this is what she told us. I was practically screaming with giggles at this ridiculous concoction. Nothing screams 'You're trying to hard to be hip' like a cocktail on fire and then topped with children's candy. 
Anyway, 3 apps and 2 drinks later aka $70 and we left the place still hungry and stone sober. 
Which begs the question did we even really eat there? 
So much potential lost here.  

I give it 3 stars because the waitress was super nice, the environment is neat, and they had live music playing which is always a plus for me.",hGPlPuFPYmxTtjDvXExEtA,3,1,3,v1EUdVUswZfh_Z6tdPW9JQ

I work in the service industry (I'm a manager actually) and was beyond disappointed in the service here! We sat down on the patio (there were no customers inside and not too busy on the patio) the woman that sat us took our drink order immediately. We then look at the menu, the menu which is VERY different from most restaurants and not a thing was explained to us! We waited SO long for a waitress to come back to take our order that one of us went to go inside to place the order and then the waitress remembered we were her table. I ordered two appetizers because the rest of the menu didn't make any sense to me and the blank stares I got from our waitress made me not want to ask her any more questions than I needed to. We then asked for bread, they told us oh, bread is free and comes with the meal. We responded, ok that's great, we figured we had to order it because we don't have any, may we have some. Our food showed up before the bread finally did. Smh. I then went into the bar to order myself a drink, not wanting to wait for our lovely waitress any longer. I ordered a ""ketel and cranberry"" the bartenders exact words were ""my ketel is stoli, grey goose ect..."" i responded to her, no, I want ketel one. She then responds VERY rudely, yea I get that, I don't have it! Ok, that's fine, you should have just told me that. I'll take goose and cranberry then. Takes her 10 min to make my drink at an empty bar! She gives me the drink and walks away.... umm can I pay? She again beyond rudely, oh, that's all you're going to get from me? I actually laughed and said yes and paid for my $10 drink ($1 per waiting minute) long story short, the service here is the WORST service I have ever experienced. The only reason I gave this place two stars was because they had a really awesome guy out on the patio that had his guitar
And sang, he's also the only reason I didn't leave and speak to a manager on my way out and demand my money back! I had two bites of each of my appetizers because they were horrible! If your going to have shit service, you're food better be good! I highly recommend people to stead clear from this place!!!!",WYlnZwBzLsyL-LU3lCyTnQ,0,0,2,iywbtD62p153CnvRZuDmfg

Proteins that were standard options are now on the premium list and the server didn't do the awesome box presentation they once did.

Their appetizer menu is great; we almost ordered more than we should!  Suggestion is if you'll be ordering a MIXX bowl share a small or medium between two and order a couple of apps.  As what we had was a shared small salmon with spinach, broccoli, zuchini, portobello mushrooms, and quinoa Mixx grill bowl THIS WAS SO DELISH!  Plus crab & shrimp sliders, mini avocado burger sliders, and truffle fries - good thing we were hungry.  

The crab & shrimp sliders deserve a section highlight though.  Crab cake and shrimp fans, this is your appetizer.  For some reasons: it can also be a lunch or dinner by themselves.  You get 3 of them and they taste fantastic with horseradish!  Neeeiiigh I'm not kidding it's not baaaaahhhd at all!  But fine if you don't like horseradish or baby goats.  You still gotta try the crab & shrimp sliders!

Then of course you know how consuming alcoholic beverages while eating appetizers takes you a long way!  Our beverages were sparkling water, a bitter rita made with grapefruit and gin gurus.  I thought I'd like the bitter rita a being a grapefruit fanatic.  But the glass is short - 4 sips and it was gone.  We consulted with three gin gurus.  Their advice was silent but relaxed our consciousness :P

We were seated outside where the big screen TV was - literally was like a pull downscreen; no sound just something to look at.  If it's still warm enough if ever you go, try being seated outside.  Even though we were outside, our server, April, was still very caring.  So I can say that in a high regard.  Thank you April!

Thanks especially for offering dessert.  Build it and make it nommified!  Hope you have room in your bellies cuz the white chocolate cheesecake paired with salted banana, drenched in vanilla bean sauce, topped with candied hazelnuts is waiting for you!",JQIZhoQB-Tg9hdBEj90m4g,27,30,4,_p7UmpAuJ-_sCA8fqVlQxg

The decor is beautiful, a very open space. We sat at the bar and were looking through the digital cocktail menu (really cool menu concept btw)  we chose the pineapple drink which was pretty tasty! That's pretty much where the good stopped...  
We asked the bartender (we don't know his name but he's really tall with a beard) for a few shots. He didnt have a suggestion after we asked him to just make whatever. It's always fun to try a new drink that a bartender can make up but these wasnt the case. The bartender gave us a bartending manual that had over 1000 drinks in it and said for us to pick one out. Not wanting to go through the entire book we opted for a simple lemon drop shot. The bartender made them and I specifically asked for no sugar rim (I don't like the extra sweetness)  and he did it anyways claiming he can't make the shot without it. 
After taking the shot he said he made extra and had enough for a few more if we wanted them. Not wanting to waste alcohol we said OK. 
Upon getting our bill we noticed he charged us for the 4 shots...  Now I'm not complaining about paying for them. We drank them it's only fair however the bartender shouldn't have tricked us into two more shots that we would have never ordered to begin with. 
On top of everything he was extremely pretentious and made you feel belittled every time he opened his mouth.

Butter bean humus. Fantastic idea. Could've been amazing but it wasn't creamy at all. The flavor was very good but I didn't care for the texture. I love that they give carrots and cucumbers as a side with toasted bread. The carrots were kinda soggy. I like that they tried to par boil them but i think they were boiled too long. The kale beet salad was pretty soggy as well. The beets tasted like they were frozen and thawed. The apples were super soggy instead of have a nice crisp to them.  The Cesar was weird but I really liked it. It seemed like it was heavy on mustard but it worked. Not necessarily a Cesar but I liked it best. The French onion was weird. It was thick like a bisque.

My kids meal came out with just the wings no fries or chocolate milk. To top it off my daughter's chicken Parmesan  was partially raw. I'm not talking undercooked I'm talking cold raw chicken.

Why did we have to pay at all? The entire experience was horrible. Would never return! Beware!!!!",7dBEgP-wx9INed3QhaVMxA,1,0,1,LsZLlfihfmWNJSx1BQJuHA

The Mixx is a prefect name for this confused and identity crisis establishment.  Started out kinda fancy.  Now they added gaming, big screen TV, Tapas, breakfast, Tapas, Yeeesh!  Seems pretty desperate to keep re-inventing themselves every couple of months.

Too confusing for me.

Next week it will have a swim up bar. Ha Ha

The saving grace was the great jazz singer who performs there weekly.  Appetizers took forever to come out, and our waitress was MIA most of the time. The place was empty, and I see why Kona Grill was packed. You will continue to lose customers if you do not care about quality service, and food. 

My update: I was contacted by the GM, Mr. Woroniecki after he read my last review for an opportunity to make my dining experience better. I was willing to give The Mixx another chance since I had other great experiences at their restaurant. I met the owner, Mr. Tieriesi and he was so warm, and accommodating to us. Mr. Tieriesi and his staff gave us a VIP treatment. We had a great server, Ray who made sure our dining experience was outstanding. I truly appreciated that there are still businesses that stand behind their product, and they care about their guests. I was impressed to return, and to share their business with others.

A giant tv on a wall in the outdoor seating area is the first thing that catches your eye. The seating area is a little small, as are the tables. Perfect for a small plate and/or drinks, but a little challenging for an entree.

Now, this is where this lounge becomes unique. If you eat here, you are shown to the inside to the back of the restaurant, where you can build your own meal, sort of like Subway. You have your veggies, meat, and sauces that are put in a bowl by staff. Then in the center of the restaurant, is a round grill, where the chef cooks your food that you picked out. You can watch the cook, or go back to you table and they will bring it to you. The food was delicious and for a medium bowl, the cost ran around $17.00. Not a bad price. I am not sure if it is the norm, but they had live music, where it was nice soft jazz music. Not loud at all, where you couldn't hold a conversation.

 Our server was Mariah, who was very pleasant and helpful. Checked on us thru ought with out hovering, which is exactly how I like it. They quickly refilled our water glass without asking.

Our stuffed mushrooms never came and we had to ask for them to be removed from the bill. Bacon rapped dates were sooo burnt. Deviled eggs were bland, we didn't finish them. Risotto was watery, barely ate any. Wings were just ok. Pork sliders tasted sour- just not good something felt off. Fries were fries. The potstickers were good. The meatballs literally weren't even meatballs. We were handed a plate of meat sauce - horrible. Pancakes were SO doughy not fluffy at all. The mussels were good but the bread that came with them was stale. Coconut shrimp were burnt to a crisp, inedible. Even the water had stuff floating in it and had to be sent back.

We ended up having two glasses of wine but no food because the menu was just too all over the place. Anywhere from fries to tapa style salads and meatballs... we just were not fans especially to pair with wine. 

Service: Ok, the hosts are nice and seated us quickly. The servers are not knowledgeable in the menu or happy hour rates at all however and we had about 3 servers in the 1 hour we were there. Their website said one price, a server said another price, and our bill from another server was again a different price. 

Ambiance: The outdoor patio looks great, it has cozy lighting and live music. The inside is not very cozy with black floors and high red walls. There's an odd area toward the back where i believe the kitchen is but it looks like a high hibachi and the chefs are looking down on the dining area. It's very odd. There is a bar thats pretty short and looks like mostly gaming seats. It's difficult to put a finger of the mood they're setting, our host was dressed in a tight dress as if she was going clubbing later and our waiters had various uniforms. I believe women were in red collards shirts with black pants and men were in white collard shirts with ties. 

I'll likely choose Kona Grill a few doors down over this place.",AeGPePY0FG7_Mu0CHck3GA,0,0,2,VDL3_pG7cguUGk1pVyLS6w

The atmosphere is kind of like they desperately want to be a very happening bar and lounge instead of a restaurant, but pretty nonetheless.  The whole cocktail menu on an iPad was a little bit weird.  The pretentious waiter just dropped it on the table and sauntered off.  The ipad itself seemed to have a poor internet connection or something, as it mostly just buffered and took entirely too long to navigate from page to page with the lag time.  In the end we all opted for simple glasses of wine to avoid the hassle.  
I went with three others and we all opted for their bowl options. They have a very large selection of bowl options and we all went in different directions, some opting to go rice based and Asian inspired and some going for Italian inspired pasta dishes.  All lukewarm and completely devoid of anything resembling flavor.  I guess that's just what you get with a bunch of unmarinated meats, unseasoned veggies and premade starches.  
The bread was decent and served in a very cute bag thing.  Prices were reasonable for the bowls, but if you had chosen to order from one of their kitchen options it would run you about $40 per entrée.  I had the groupon so it was really no harm no foul for me but I wouldn't go back.

The cons: 
-The appetizer of fries took about 35min to arrive which we were almost done with our meal by then. 
-Our son ordered mini burgers off the App menu as well, took about 35min. Then, they did not come with avocado (on avocado burgers)? We had to flag down our server. She took another 20min to get three slices of avocado.  My son ended up eating 1/2 the burgers and cold trying to wait? 
-My husband was told they ran out of Pepsi from a order mistake.  They had cans of pop which he was given a 1/2 glass refill of flat pop and told they would bring him a can to refill, that never happened our entire meal.  
-We had to ask for our server twice because she wasn't back. 
-She delivered dessert menus and handed us the check all at once??? I told her I wanted dessert. Now, it took us flagging her down again! 
-I was encouraged to try one of the mixology drinks which mind you are $13.77 and it looked nothing like the photos? No fruit, sweetened rim and no muttled  (spelling?) ingredients? Taste was good. But if about presentation, it had none.  

The two stars were given just because overall we liked the food, concept and patio.  There were at least 5-7 staff wondering around?

4163711,2017-08-10,0,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"My boyfriend and I purchased a Groupon for this restaurant. It was a $40 deal for $80 worth of food. I mentioned this upon arrival to the restaurant. The woman who sat us told us that it was for anything on the menu, except drinks. One of the primary reasons I purchased the Groupon was because the drinks were on the pricier side (comparable to Strip cocktail prices). So, with drinks, I assumed our bill would amount to $80, anyway. I was a little peeved because I believe I read the fine print of the Groupon and it did not mention anything about the fact that drinks were not included. After talking with our server, we discovered that we couldn't use the voucher because we needed to have four people in our party. Understandably, the Groupon did say ""for four,"" but in my previous experiences with other restaurants, they didn't care as long as we purchased enough to fulfill the Groupon. I thought it usually meant that in order to amount your bill to that price, you usually need about four people. This made sense when I purchased the Groupon (the menu has since changed) because each dish averaged around $20, However, from their standpoint, I understand that they probably want four people so that the bill would amount to much more than $80. Anyway, we ate here despite not being able to use the Groupon. 

I should say that the reason why I was enticed by this restaurant was because of the make-your-own option on the menu. Another reason why I purchased the Groupon. On a previous day, a man actually flagged us down while we were walking to Cheesecake Factory to tell us about the ""uniqueness"" of this option. So, I figured why not try it. As of last week, according to the server, this has unfortunately been eliminated from their menu. So, we ordered the following: 

1) Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Dates: My boyfriend really enjoyed these. I think this was his favorite out of the entire meal. I am not a dates fan, but I did try one and it was good. It came with five dates, I believe.

2) Meatballs: These were okay. They were stuffed with cheese. Cheese is always good. However, the texture was pretty hard - maybe seemed overcooked. You receive two very large meatballs, which were very filling. They are the same meatballs as in the spaghetti dish, so unless you really love meatballs, I wouldn't order both.  

3) Lasagna: Nothing outstanding. It was decent, but I wouldn't order it again. 

4) Pasta Carbonara: Large portion. According to my boyfriend, it was a little better than average. 

We also ordered two beers and a soda. 

The total for our meal came out to $66 without tip. For the amount of food, the bill wasn't outrageous. Just not sure the price reflected the taste. Admittedly, I was still upset about the Groupon. 

The service was very good. Our server, Jessica, was very polite and came to check on us often.  She gave us recommendations on the menu and seemed knowledgeable, with exception to the items at the bar. They didn't have a dedicated beer list, so she had to go ask the bartender what type of beer they had. She said that there were a lot of different options, so if this is the case, I think the restaurant should have a list. I know being a craft beer person, it is always good to be able to see what would go well with my meal. The only other thing I would say is that both the woman who sat us and the server gave us a weird vibe when it came to the Groupon. So, I imagine that is a recurring issue for them. Overall, the service was good.

The atmosphere of the restaurant was nice. It had a very clean, welcoming vibe to it. The restaurant was not busy while we were there, but it made us feel like we were having more privacy. There were a few gaming machines at the bar. Two people seemed to be enjoying themselves while we were there. There is also an outside area with misters that had a big projection screen of ESPN. It might be good for game day. 

The only other thing that I noticed was that there was a discrepancy between their menu price and what they actually charged us on the receipt. I didn't mind because it was actually cheaper that way. The online Yelp Eat24 menu also doesn't seem to accurately match their physical in-restaurant menus. For example, on their Yelp ordering, there is a Maine Lobster dish, but it wasn't on the restaurant menu. The make-your-own option is also still on Yelp. There are also no posted hours on the door. Not sure if that's purposeful. 

Overall, service was good. Food was average. If it weren't for the Groupon issue, I would've been slightly happier. But, not sure if I would come back, even with my unredeemed Groupon voucher, only because I know that the bill will amount to much more than $80. I would have to say that this restaurant has a great location and a lot of potential. But, right now, it just isn't hitting the spot.",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,2,0,3,8cUtdasY3Ihb7tRJ5Dt27A
4163881,2017-09-28,0,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"Some of the worse restaurant food I've ever had. I'm only giving it 1 stars cause our server was awesome. First off, if you have a Groupon, it doesnt include alcohol (I had called before we went in and whomever answered the phone said I could use it on everything) It also doesnt state anywhere on the Groupon that alcohol isnt included. So okay, we ordered a BUNCH of food. 
      Everything tastes like it was frozen, with NO flavor. The only good thing was the bacon wrapped dates. We kept ordering different things hoping it would get better and it just kept getting worse. I'm not even a foodie with high expectations and am severely dissapointed with this place. We ordered the creme brulee and couldnt even eat it, it had the strangest consistency. The beer battered shrimp? Smothered in thousand island sauce with relish (not stated on menu). The whole thing ruined our dinner night.",wTD3ojpGL4URdzd7rVXbPw,0,0,1,QpOu7Cauc3tXmzb7o_Yqcw
4211696,2016-08-24,2,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"It isn't because of the extremely slow service when there is hardly anyone in the place, or the forgetful server, or the mediocre food and drinks, or the dessert items that they have, don't have, oh yeah, they do have. No, wait, yeah, it is because of all of the above.
 
We went on a Sunday afternoon for happy hour to have cocktails and appetizers for a friend's birthday. I even made a reservation thinking because it was a new place with such amazing reviews, it might be hard to get a table. I didn't need the reservation because there was barely anyone there. I didn't take it as a bad thing since one could easily think: attentive and expedited service. That is until it took awhile to get anything to drink to start us off. I ordered us a round of waters first, assuming regular tap water. But it was the slick move by our server asking if we wanted sparkling or flat. When I said ""regular"" he came back with a bottle of Evian carefully splitting it three ways. And because I wasn't really paying attention due to my thirst (yes, we live in the desert), I didn't stop him, I just let him pour. Well played my server salesman. Well played. 

Then came the drink menu, which our server was very animated in describing the house drink specials. I can appreciate an animated and affable server indeed as it only increases his/her sales. So I ordered the Mixx Elixer vodka drink served in a cool copper colored pineapple, my mom ordered a mai tai and the birthday girl had a dirty martini. While we waited for our drinks, we perused the happy hour menu and its limited items and chose three different things to order whenever our server came back with our drinks. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, the bruschetta and the truffle fries. Our server came back a short minute later and stood by our table looking like he had something to say in that, ""I forgot what I was going to ask you"" face to which he then followed it up by actually saying out loud, ""I forgot what I was going to ask you"" to us, not to any one of us specifically either. We laughed, mostly at him because it was like, okay dude, you really shouldn't come to work high. Then he asked the birthday girl if she wanted blue cheese stuffed olives with her martini, which she already was sipping. Yeah, sure, bring on the blue cheese stuffed olives. 

And why not since those olives became our appetizers as what we ordered came out much later and one plate at a time. The couple seated next to us who came in after us and probably ordered after us got their truffle fries before we saw one plate put down on our table. The bites were just okay and because we didn't really see much of our server after the apps came out, we didn't even entertain ordering another drink. Or at least my mom and I didn't. When he finally decided to show his face, we were plenty done with our apps, sucking on ice from our downed cocktails and there was no more water in our glasses. But the birthday girl ordered another drink. I honestly thought to take her next door to Cheesecake Factory for a birthday treat, but for some reason I decided to ask her if she wanted to order a dessert off their menu. What a production that became.

The server came back with her drink and I mentioned the dessert menu. The birthday girl ordered the chocolate cake with caramel after it was suggested, and my mom and I decided to share the cheesecake. A few minutes later, the server said that they didn't have the cheesecake. Okay fine, then I guess we will share the chocolate cake and caramel, same as the birthday girl. Then he came back and said, they don't have the chocolate cake. Back to square one for all of us. So after a few minutes re-thinking her birthday treat, my friend chose the brown butter tart with fruit or something like that. I was asked if we wanted anything and I replied absolutely not. Then a few minutes after that, a woman, presumably a manager, came out and apologized and announced that they did have the chocolate cake. Did we still want it? Christ! Whatever! Bring my friend whatever she wants and while you're at it, the check too because God only knows how long that would take.

They brought two desserts: the chocolate cake and the brown buttered tart and the bill. They didn't charge us for either dessert. That was the consolation, trying to make it right. I can appreciate that as I don't consider myself a difficult patron. Plus, I used to work in the restaurant business, so I understand a thing or two about customer service. I just don't get how a place with more staff than customers can be lacking in service and knowledge of what's on their menu. Happy hour it wasn't.",LbSMqzQ6BiAFcJUHBPNldw,3,0,2,ZzpuD_wUq4OM2F4S1STzmQ

Sincerely cared that the customers were happy. Made sure he made the experience personal not just a chore. When he approached our table made sure we has everything we needed, and that we were genuinely taken care of. He is very personable and made us feel welcome, not like we were at just a restaurant but we were at his home. You could truly tell he loves what he does and it's not just a job or a chore to him.

Nothing really unique other than crab cake sliders.  Prices about $7 more per item than what I would considered normal lunch prices. 

The concept of the restaurant is that you choose protein, veggies sauce and sides to be ""cooked to order"" on a hibachi grill..... Which is why we came however this was not available until dinner menu started.

Nobody has anything to do so they continuously come to your table and ask about the food...if they were busy Im pretty sure they would not have time to chat. We were treated as if we had never seen a tablet with the bar menu on it. Flemings has had these for years now. You have families coming in yet hostesses are dressed inappropriately for a family friendly atmosphere. Its dark and romantic inside, but how romantic is it when you have to get on a chow line to pick out your food and then have someone cook it in the middle of the restaurant. Servers standing there looking like you should be in awe of this and they urge you to take videos of the cooks...REALLY? This is one level above of stale buffet restaurants. I am concerned about the meat and fish staying out so long. I felt that the beef was on the brink of spoiling. The average length of stay is about 45 minutes. The experience does not match the decadent décor. Clearly MIXX is all mixed up. Is it a buffet or a lounge? Is it family friendly or a Sexy night club?

Woo-hoo, that's my kind of place!  Except for a few diehards at the bar, it was virtually empty.  Then again, all of Boca seemed to be empty.  Thanksgiving, Black Friday and Cyber Monday burnout?

It's a pretty and modern, upscale-vibe place, with just the right amount of lighting.  We chose a booth just past the big grill, and our server came over right away, probably grateful to have something to do :)

I ordered a glass of Prosecco, and we opted for the large create-a-bowl.  I liked that there were lots of meat/fish choices, and you're able to add as much as you want of that, as well as the starch and veggies.  I put together what I thought was a pretty healthy combination, then went to the grill to have it cooked.  Too late I realized that the cook was sprinkling what to me was a huge amount of salt on the food.  I stopped him, he threw it out, then walked me back to the food bar to start all over again.  He was probably cursing me under his breath but, to his credit, he kept a poker face.  Yes, I'm salt-phobic, but in the interest of honesty, I'll say that the finished product could have benefited from a *little* bit of salt.  Just not the amount he was liberally applying.  I think the cook should ask before using.

When the bowls are being filled, there's also a choice of a bunch of different sauces.  I chose the peanut sauce; the cups they put the sauce into probably measure half a cup.  I didn't want to consume that much of the thick, calorie-laden sauce, so I didn't have the cup filled.  In the end, the amount of food in my bowl was too much for the reduced amount of sauce, so I asked for some balsamic vinaigrette, which was delivered promptly and cheerfully.  It turned out to be a great combination, and the pungency of a small amount of the balsamic did the trick.

While I chose steak, chicken and shrimp, my husband skipped the shrimp and had fish and tofu in his.  We both thoroughly enjoyed our dishes, and we each brought home enough for another meal.  Unless you're the kind of creature who disdains leftovers, it makes no sense to order the smaller size.

We were completely finished with the appetizers and the waitress was no where to be found for us to order our entrees...... it was a good 20 minutes before she came back to the table, and then had to leave again to find something to write on to take our dinner order. I am not sure why she wouldn't come prepared to take our order?
So you pick your protein, your veggies, rice or pasta, and your sauce and then it is cooked on a huge grill in the center of the restaurant.
I had the Shrimp, Rice, Red and Yellow Bell Peppers with the Spicy Sweet Chili. It was okay, the Spicy Sweet Chili sauce was good, but it was really all I could taste. It really overwhelmed the shrimp and 
My husband had the Premium Meats, Prime Angus Beef Rib Cap $30 and the Maine Lobster $32 with the rice, mushrooms and onions.
Let me say that I am not someone who minds paying money for a good meal. Price is not an issue when I get a quality meal. 
However, when the quality doesn't meet the price thats when I feel I have to mention the price of the Premium Meat selection here, it is not at all worth the price!
The steak was okay, but not anything special. The lobster was super small and again nothing special.
The ""Nothing Special"" food along with some of the worst service I have experienced means I won't be coming back.",FEwPxhjdVKxSPVQQAHX2gg,4,2,2,1s8sAOQ2QWphGpF0hnp5EQ

We had truffle fries and they were very good. Despite no one being there the grill was dirty from a meal they made for staff. It was clean when we arrived. The counters around the grill were not the cleanest. He proceeded to clean the grill despite our food being right underneath it. I asked him TWICE to please not get any of the grill debris in our food when he was cleaning it. Nope didn't stop him. Then he showed me food garbage all over it like it wasn't that bad. I was prepared a fresh bowl. My friend had chicken and I had seafood. He cooked them with the same utensils. The food was typical Mongolian type grill food. Tasty but not really worth the price tag.

This is a great location for large parties as they have plenty of space. They also have a private room that can probably host around 50 people. They have happy hour from 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM. At this time only well drinks and house wines are part of this sale. The signature drinks are still at full price. They also offer a few appetizers for 4.99, but the list is very short. I ordered a few appetizers but I was not very impressed. Although they were not bad they were not memorable. I also tried their stir fried bar which was a very cool concept. They have a bar full of veggies, sauces and meat. You can pick all of the ingredients you would like to have and the best part is that you can watch them making it in their huge grill which is located in the middle of the restaurant. Just based on their stir fried alone this place would be five stars in my book. I got the Prime Angus Beef Rib Cap with rice and peppercorn sauce and it was amazing. 

Overall, a cool place to hang out while enjoying good food. The dessert concept was also very cool. You pick your main dessert for example cheese cake cream puff just to mention a few and you can add any topics you want including ice cream!

4676294,2016-06-27,0,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"I am always skeptical when a new restaurant opens as I would prefer to wait until they get the kinks worked out with food and staffing.  Mixx was definitely the exception to the rule.  I met a friend for dinner - starting with drinks at the bar.  They have a terrific menu with unique concoctions at a reasonable price .  Larry, Alan, and Phil were behind the bar and were so hospitable, that we decided to have dinner at the bar rather than getting a table.  While all three were terrific, I have to give Alan kudos for not only making us feel like old friends (including addressing all guests by first name), but also being incredibly entertaining.

We both tried a couple of their signature cocktails including the Chili Bang! Gin Guru, and Sour Ritawhich were all amazing in presentation and flavor.  We then had their version of the hummus, served with toast and vegetables, which was a nice variation.  For dinner, we selected their grill where you make your own meal -  you select vegetables, starches and proteins to create a variety of combinations including Alfredo, chimichurri, and soy ginger.  In addition, they have some custom topping to accent your dish at the grill.  Both grill chefs were also very knowledgeable and really cared about making he experience personalized by offering suggestions to further accentuate the flavors.

Overall, this was a terrific experience in all aspects.  Staff was friendly, entertaining, and very personable.  Food and beverage definitely had a great value for the price.  Compared to many restaurants that need a lot of time before they get it right, I think they already have an incredible combination.

I hope they continue on this path and flourish in the Summerlin market, as they definitely have the formula for success!",MH9WjTAwXbd3S89fivtoDA,3,3,5,QsFQ2SVCRXslr7-cW7-uNw

We ordered tapas and and Entree to share the food came out cold somehow even though it was coming out one by one.

It has good potential if they can put forth a bit more effort in the kitchen. Our waitress was very nice, patient and helpful.

Either the kitchen doesn't know the menu or they flat out don't have any culinary knowledge. Truffle Aioli is not mayonnaise from a jar that you supposedly added truffle oil to. It tasted just like Best Foods you get at the grocery store. The fries were good, but that was it. The French Onion soup not only looked like jello, but the crouton was rock hard and the cheese, well, not sure it was cheese. The stuffed mushrooms were soupy and it wasn't bread crumbs, as stated on the menu, it was chunks of soggy bread on top. The peanut infused chicken was the worst thing delivered to the table. Teeny tiny bits of dried out chicken. I didn't even know what it was supposed to be. I've included pictures so you all can see what we got.

The hostess initially attempted to seat us on the patio, but the misters were going more like fire sprinklers so we requested to be seated inside. Typically I expect to be asked if I'd like to sit outside, not have to do the asking.

Cocktail prices were more in line with what I'd expect to pay in NYC. The two we tried were completely bland and uninteresting ... and we weren't convinced they actually had any alcohol in them. Okay, so let's try some beers; what've you got on tap? ""Uh, actually ... sorry, none of those taps are currently connected to anything. We've only got a couple selections in bottles at the moment.""

The first two appetizers we tried to order were unavailable. Our server thought our third choice probably was, too, but she ran off to check and they did indeed have some shrimp left. When it arrived it was bland and uninspired but edible.

The core of the ""Mixx Grill"" concept seems to be a de-ethnicized teppanyaki setup: pick some stuff off of a buffet and have it grilled up for you. After our experience so far neither of us felt like attempting that kind of adventure, so we both looked to the six pre-configured entrees on the menu. My companion's first two choices were both unavailable -- that's two out of six! -- so she settled for the bruschetta appetizer as her main. (Again, edible, but the bread didn't seem to be grilled so much as...lightly warmed on one side?) I chose the ahi tuna. I have literally never had a less flavorful -- or, even, tasty -- piece of ahi in my life. An unadorned can of StarKist would have been better.

Oh, and I must also mention the ""Lounge"" part of the name: The evening we visited, this consisted of a pair of completely generic crooners with recorded backing, at a volume that made conversation nearly impossible and bordered on painful.",ddu4rHcDU93mOkM4Haopbg,3,0,1,fjP63b2Hb-tNkC20-z9tBg
4895392,2016-07-03,0,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"I wanted to like this place but unfortunately it fell short and I would not recommend it.  I was pleased to see it open as it looked like it would be on the higher end  in terms of quality and decor.  Boca Park, in my opinion, could use a restaurant that is on the higher end. They have plenty of middle of the road options (like Cheesecake Factory or Kona Grill) but nothing one step up from that.  

To start off, when we first arrived I heard a saxophone player playing and I thought ""Oh cool, they must have a little live jazz band or something"".  I realized when I sat down that it was just a guy with a saxophone standing in a corner playing along randomly to the radio.  Inside they have plenty of room where they could put a 3 piece jazz band if thats what they were going for.  It came off as awkward and half assed to me to have one guy with a saxophone standing in a corner, playing random sax licks to songs on the radio.  Have a jazz band or don't have a jazz band, but ya can't do it halfway.  

I ordered the truffle fries and the filet mignon.  The truffle fries were OK.  I've had better, and I've had worse.  The filet mignon was very mediocre. It was no better than a steak you'd find at Cheesecake Factory.  From what I remember it was about $30.  For the same price (maybe $5 more) you can go to Echo & Rig in Tivoli Village right up the road and get a filet mignon that rivals the $70 filet mignon you might find at the higher end steakhouses on the strip.  My date ordered some chicken dish, which again was just OK.

Overall it was just a bit underwhelming.  For the two of us the bill was about $100.  For the same money I could go to Echo & Rig literally 1 minute away in Tivoli Village and get much better food/ambiance.  The Mixx seems like it is trying to be a more hip, slightly higher end restaurant, but in my mind they've just fallen short.  If a place is really great I don't mind spending a lot on dinner. In this case I left feeling like I shouldn't have spent $100 on dinner, and maybe should have gone to Kona Grill instead.",8nqjDsFnUA2gy-r3JtJPCQ,4,0,2,Yd0s4Jw3W807djGocxt1ow

We hadn't heard much about this spot but knew of it from its location and decided to check it out. Upon entering, the beautiful sweet hostess immediately greeted us with a smile and we proceeded to the awesome patio. 

I'm just gonna dive into how this restaurant operates. It's an awesome concept, a little confusing at first, but fun once you learn how to Mixx. On one side of the menu, you'll have your appetizers, salads and soups that you order through your waitress. On the other side, you'll see a combination menu where you'll pick out your protein, veggies and sauces BUT you don't order your combination through your waitress, you'll actually get up and walk to the ""buffet"" style bar and a chef will prepare your bowl for you to your liking. You'll start from the left side and as you walk along the bar, the chef will add anything in your bowl that you choose:

1) pick your veggies and starches
2) pick your protein
3) pick your sauce
4) head to the grill and watch the chef cook it

Both meals we picked out were amazingly delicious. My bf picked out a pesto chicken fettuccine bowl with spinach and tomatoes and I picked out a buckwheat (gluten-free) noodle with quinoa, baby bok choy, zucchini, 2 types of mushrooms, spinach in a spicy sweet Chile sauce. Incredible! Also from the appetizer menu which picked out the Brussel Sprouts and WOW!! Some of the best we've ever had!

Besides our food being awesome, we loved everything about this place. The owner is genuinely caring and loves his restaurant. Our server Valerie was awesome and has a great fun personality. We would love to have her again on our next visit. The restaurant is very large, spacious and the design is very chic, even the bathrooms are fancy. The patio is perfect and a great spot to host large parties. They have a menu to serve every diet, including my strict gluten-free vegan diet. Oh and before I forget, their sangria ice tea and awesome (alcohol free).

I wouldn't sit at the bar again. She did tell us to come back for the happy hour. So we took her advice but We got a table this time. We tried everything on the happy hour menu to try.

The salmon I ordered was decent and not bad. The only reason I gave the second star is because of the dessert it was good and put me in a better mood considering how bad everything else was.

Unfortunately  it failed in other areas that probably won't bring us back. Our server was ok. He didn't seem to be very happy to be there. They had a good selection of wines and drinks, although none of the speciality cocktails didn't connect with me. They seemed to cater mostly to those with a spicy palate. But like I said, they had plenty of wine choices and the prices were decent.
As far as the food goes I would say it was just average. We got some sliders ,the risotto and the bruschetta. The bruschetta was probably the best thing. On the sliders the Buns were too hard and it was just kind of blah. The risotto lacked some of the ingredients,  like the artichokes, there was very little and it was super creamy and it was kind of weird that our server did not bring us a spoon so we were using our Forks to dish it out. Oh and we got the Greek salad which was decent but nothing special.
We weren't going to get dessert but we looked at the menu and decided to get the chocolate cake but unfortunately I misread the menu and thought it was the molten kind where it was a warm Center. It took forever to come out so I thought yeah it's the molten cake so that takes a while but then when it came out it wasn't so it really shouldn't have taken that long cuz it was just a slice of cake and it was cold and hard and not what I wanted so we returned it. Then our server took a long time after he brought our bill to take our payment. I actually had to get up and go give it to him.",nVaEKWMYWVGdJKsSx0Bb_Q,0,0,3,41dv2BpLrcfulvPpb2X7HQ
5653747,2016-06-30,1,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"This is a new grill and lounge that just opened a little over a week ago. I happened to be in Boca Park last Wednesday and noticed it was just opened so we opted to make a reservation for last Friday night to celebrate a good friends birthday.

We were promptly greeted and seated in a comfortable open booth near the door. For those that are unaware, this space used to be occupied by Gordon Biersch Brewery. The interior has changed somewhat and it is much more open and spacious then it was before. 

Our server promptly brought over an iPad which allowed us to scroll for drinks. We all chose the Mixx Elixer (a house specialty) made with vodka and assorted juices. The presentation of this drink is the clincher. This drink is served in a really cool pineapple cup. I was excited as I have a passion for anything pineapple! Also, the drink was complimented with a spoonful of ""pop rocks"" to either add to your drink or just have fun with a mouth frenzy instead. I had completely forgot about these candies so it was a fun throwback. The drink itself is very tasty and really went down easy on this very hot evening. 

Next came the appetizer which was a lovely plate of artisan cheeses served with nuts, fig jam and brioche.  The fig jam was light and flavorful and paired well with all of the cheeses.

The dinner concept was remarkable as you choose a sauce, then ""from the earth"" (veggies), then either a ""land""or ""ocean"" choice (meat or fish), but your sauce choice really dictates the meal. Once you have completed this task, you have a choice of waiting for your server to bring your entree' to your table or getting up from your table and overseeing the server collect and prepare the ingredients for cooking. Just steps away is where the chef cooks up your meal on a circular grill. My friends opted to stay at the table and wait for the traditional serving of their meals. I, however, am always different and wanted to enjoy the total experience so off I went. I chose the lemon butter sauce, Alaskan Cod, fingerling potatoes, zucchini and cremini mushrooms. There is small buffet style serving bar and you watch as the server loads up your bowl full of the chosen ingredients and then you walk the bowl over to the chef for him to cook. You can either order a small, medium or large portion of food. We all opted for the small order and were very happy since the prices are very reasonable. Once my food was cooked, our server brought my dish over. Unfortunately, it was a bit too salty for my tastes. I am not sure what went wrong but I had a hard time finishing the meal and was some what disappointed. My friends ordered the shrimp scampi and the rib eye steak. They both seemed to enjoy their meals but did not rave about them.

The service was hot and cold.  Our server started out great but then as time went on she would disappear for large amounts of time and we had to ask for our check twice. She was trying though and was most likely trying to find her groove so I won't be too harsh. The food runner was on pointe though. He was always refilling our water glasses and clearing our plates and was extremely attentive. I wish I would have asked his name so I could give him kudos! Also, there was a gentleman who approached our table early on and explained the whole dinner concept to us. He was really engaging and helpful. He may have been one of the owners, but once again I did not get a name.

Why only three stars?? The restaurant is brand new and still working out the kinks. The food was good but not great and the service needs improvement. This is competitive plaza in terms of dining options.  I do plan to return and give them another try this summer and hope to update my review by two stars.",Y3PQ5P_R7jcgiIS_1dIv-w,8,6,3,DCS087_EskV3gNtvYEzCgA
5679713,2016-10-10,4,YBE7FO11s32f6BEpTAJ5Rw,"Asked to seat 3 adults/2 kids. She said let me set a table for 5---she basically took the table for 4 and grabbed a chair and put it at the corner and squeezed a setting in. After they brought that big copper drink, there was no room for anything. Forks went falling. A bread basket came. We ordered 3 appetizers and guess what....there was no where to put it. We literally had to put stuff on the bench we were sitting in. 

The waitress was slow. Took 20 minutes for her to come and get a drink order. 

There wasn't a soul on the place yet we are crammed at a table for 4.

The area to get your vegetable/protein bowl was a shit show. He had to run all the way around to give the cook the food. Why was he closed on on the side he needed to get out on? It already took a long time to get food with no one in it, wonder what it would be like if there was people in here. 

We added our new food to the already overcrowded table set for 5 yet meant for 4 children. We had to put more food on the bench.  Where the hell is the waitress again? More crap falls off the table. She doesn't care and there's are more people dressed in cocktail waitress dresses versus people eating. I would have ordered more food and drink yet she vanished. 

She finally comes by and I tell her to look at the small surface space, and she's confused. This is why she will never be more than a waitress and she can't even do this right. I asked her if they had 5 grown adults how would they seat them? She has no clue and asks the bus boy that walks up. He's adamant that they would do this same configuration and he's so proud of his answer lien he just won who wants to be a millionaire. I bust his bubble and tell him how wrong he is, that a table should have been pushed up with this. The size of the plates doesn't allow for us to be comfortable-for crying out loud we have plates of food on our bench and we still have no room. I ask what would happen if you had a group of 10? This is higher math and they can't figure it out, it's like deer in the headlights

The food was good.
The tables are tiny and they obviously fear putting two tables together so don't order appetizers. Don't order the elixir-the Cup itself takes up a whole place setting and they won't know what to do.

I would expect at least 2 pieces per person. We ordered the mixx it bowls where you pick your own items and have them cooked on the grill. O-M-G the cross contamination in that place is crazy. I had steak, my friend had tofu and he might as well had steak because the same utensils were used for mixing. Two other patrons had chicken and again as all our food cooked they were being stirred with the same tongs. Additionally, only a little salt and pepper were added to season the food. So as you can imagine the raw meats that were selected to be cook had absolutely no flavor when done-even with the Alfredo sauce I asked for on top.

I love this concept completely. It's like an upscale chipotle but the taste and cross contamination definitely was a turn off.",V1doW0DP1fVPSvdD7uyN8Q,3,0,1,tvtrv2F4rkgA7-bU3UWBwg

They deserve none at all to be honest. They are embarrassing for Summerlin let alone Las Vegas. Service is full of big/air headed fools. Every place in the food and beverage industry here in Las Vegas prides themselves based on service. Great customer service is what it's all about right? First off walking into this place there was no hostess nor host. I was sat by the bartender that noticed us after a nice 6 minute wait just standing here with no one to notice they had some guests. Upon getting sat in one of their booths I only had one other person with me along with 4 dinner settings on the table. Server greeted us with an iPad that didn't even work at all. So much for a cocktail list.. the dining room is HUGE yet there's one other table and more employees than guests. Server was snotty and didn't even tell us her name didn't take the other two settings off at all after a few trips . We ordered some apps off the menu and I couldn't notice but the calamari was so bland and the breading to it just was smushy and soggy full of oil on the bottom pieces.. the bacon wrapped dates were just disgusting .. the bacon was burnt and seemed like they made that first and left it under the heat lamp while cooking the others. Last but not least was our hummus that was store bought in pretty sure with some oil topped on it before sent out. Two raggedy carrot sticks and some chips... nacho chips... I've never had such a poor hummus plate in my life. The saddest yet easiest thing to serve out a basic kitchen and still couldn't deliver.. with those bland items we barely touched we actually were kinda forced to get those in a way because after tying to order a few other apps we were told that they might not have shrimp and than out of this and that over and over. I ordered a coke and that was flat I drank it still but never got a refill within the  hour that we were there for. So we decided to try the grill thing they had since what can go wrong with choosing your own items and having it cooked on a grill right? Well wrong again.. I couldn't notice but all the meats were all very old and not fresh at all. You can tell by just looking at it that everything is cheap and just not fresh. We went ahead and did a plate anyways because we were hungry and that's what we came for was for dinner, we left the plate up there for the chef to cook and sat back down. They brought the plate to us when it was done and it was the nastiest looking thing I've ever seen.. straight up slop . Super oily and bland my wife didn't even touch it. She felt sick after the apps and looking at the stir fri that was made. I tried a few bites and like I said it's just gross it made me want to vomit. I don't know if it was a combination of the apps plus that slop or if it was just that. To top this whole evening off they didn't have the air conditioning on at all. What place in Las Vegas does not turn on their air? Along with the huge grill in the middle putting out extra heat it's just nothing but sweat inside there. The poor employees always wiping their nasty sweaty foreheads over and over and serving their guests. I can sit here and name another 50 things that went in During this massacre but I rather just let them embarrass themselves. Also.. is the guy in the suit a manager or a server? I've never seen such unstable messes in my life with such great yelp ratings. I gotta say some one either was paid or these guests are straight up McDonald's professionals to be putting up 5 stars here! Does anyone else notice the napkins with stains on them and they smell like trash.  This place is trash stay away!!!
