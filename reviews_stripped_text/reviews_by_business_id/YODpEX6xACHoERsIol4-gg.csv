1961855,2015-05-22,0,YODpEX6xACHoERsIol4-gg,I am so disgusted with this place. This morning I ordered breakfast. I order oatmeal with NO FRUIT. I order 2 Cinnamon rolls and a 3 piece French toast sticks. I received Oatmeal with fruit and 2 Cinnamon rolls that were hard a rock. How hard can it possible be to microwave some food.,GG5dReg9sRJeqRBfJN1hoA,0,0,1,4-nUY4ULwfF8Yzg0AdzIHA

I asked for his regional manager and was hung up on. Our food was cold and order was wrong. We did not return for a while. I called BK customer service to no avail. So we saw the 2 for Special and the nugget special and went back hoping for a better experience. When we go to the window we were asked ""what did you order again?""OMG! Really? Then got home and our order was wrong! We ordered 2 meals for 10 and 2 10pc nuggets. Asked for nuggets fresh and yes they were cold!!!! I did not order a double wopper with cheese and thats what I got. The nuggets were cold. Again at the BK near my work the food is always hot and when I ask for fresh its made fresh! I think this stems from the manager thinking his customers are crazy. I will never ever go to this location ever again!",iMVHqFAY79af29FgZceOGA,1,0,1,CHK7HhDK-116MTluGd3yLw

So i return for my meal and manager David very rude decides not to honor their word so i left. Why would anybody expect me to pay twice for a meal, that manager needs to be fired. End up calling the managing company who made it better, but to have a manager as rude no company should allow this behavior.",KBb3an3fIvZJqA5QPcnJNw,0,0,1,XAVjAcG-qfyZz3YM1xkSlQ
3141431,2018-01-30,7,YODpEX6xACHoERsIol4-gg,"Burger King just needs to take a look at what other fast food places are doing with breakfast and incorporate some of the same practices! One of the most frustrating things is that they stop serving breakfast at such an odd time of 10:30 AM and when people like me who would enjoy French toast sticks at a later time can't get them it's annoying. My most recent experience at this particular location was what even inspired me to do a review. I was in the drive thru line at approximately 10:18 AM and of course sat there for about 7-10 minutes which put us super close to the ending of breakfast. When I finally was able to order the woman who was taking the drive thru orders tried to tell me no more breakfast when in fact it wasn't even 10:30 AM. The last thing I want to do is sit up and argue with somebody this early in the morning about some damn French toast sticks so that was really annoying. Anyways the manager end up having the kitchen drop a fresh batch of French toast sticks for me because technically I was correct I got in that line prior to 10:30 AM and even placed my order BEFORE the time that they claim breakfast stops. All this could've and SHOULD'VE been avoided by simply doing like McDonalds, Jack In The Box and the others and offer ALL DAY BREAKFAST.. Period!",qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,1,1,o4N3pdeqHBsFsSqm0LrXMg

I went through the drive-thru during the height of lunch hour and was impressed with the expeditious service. The food was on-par with other BK's I've visited. I will return, as this location is conveniently located for a quick jaunt from work. The fries weren't as hot and fresh as I would have liked, but good enough to eat every last one of them.",18xIAA444UuAWwEWiPCW-A,0,2,3,btlFdOM1rXEW3F0_tTVlFw

No one was in line and I didn't have to wait long for someone to take my order. The service was fast, I enjoyed my meal, and I got to stay for a little while for what was like an hour.

This location refused to provide this sauce at no charge..  We will not be going back to this one.

Don't go to this burger King drive the extra distance to go somewhere else.

They even charge 25 cents for sauce for your nuggets.

STAY AWAY.  -",eGHILlox-KdEF-QjuIYFxQ,0,0,1,GRu1uCO9zPFfYWW5IHG8Jw
5821465,2016-09-07,1,YODpEX6xACHoERsIol4-gg,"Burger King= whopper. 
I got myself a whopper junior combo with fries. And then at the checkout, the sign for a deal on the chicken nuggets got me good, so I threw in an order of 10 pieces since it was a super deal. I can't recall but I think it was $1.99 or something. 

The chicken nuggets had zero crisp and were sorta soggy. It's basically a larger shaped version of their flimsy chicken fries. 

Their coffee was surprisingly decent. And despite my doubts that it was real coffee or had any caffeine, I definitely felt myself amped up a bit. 

The whopper junior was as good as usual.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,2,1,2,TumtLxKczaFp8xnmVTRj1g
