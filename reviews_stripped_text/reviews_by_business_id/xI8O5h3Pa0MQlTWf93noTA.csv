That is 40 minutes before the should only be serving breakfast and Myesha was a terrible customer service representative. She showed no integrity for the regulations and even worse respect for the customer. She is a terrible employee and deserves to be fired.

The ice cream machine is perpetually broken and a lot of times so is their credit card machine. Worst McDonald's in Las Vegas!

The 1st 3 people,before me all ordered food for there the worker bagged rhem all up then asked do you want a tray.  Then they called a number 2 guys walked up to ger thier mcflurries the same guy bagging up all the inhouse orders ssid oops were those suppose to be m and m's. ? They replied its alrighr i made my order it was like 430 pm hardly full or busy i ordered 2 #3s  double qp meals large and 1 classic chicken,3. Sandwich with only mayo.  The cashier tried immediately to pull a nellis bonanza,scam he just looked at us after order so i ask can i have my drinks. He said yes 2 large right ? After just taking my order. Puzzled i said yes.   He gave the 2 drink cups we waited 20 minutes or so they call my number 1 #2 and 1 chicken w mayo but also with the brown sauce,i asked please dont put that on did anyway cashier put mayo no pickles but didnt put mayo only hahaha i got so mad i walked didnt get my change or my chicken sandwich worst customer service ive ever had for a reference ro nellis bonaza,read the mcdonalds review on nellis bonanza,i posted.  Dont eat here or make sure they charged you for everyrhing so after a 20 minute wait,no surprises.  Thier service sucks id gove them a 0 out of 10 not even a 1 star. For a,billion dollar corporation made off we rhe people, they sure dont know squat about customer service satisfaction or even getting your order right.  I feel like his mess up was intentional only because he disnt want to give me,my cups,hed have preferred i waited till food so he,could say oh i didnt hear 2,meals i asked why did he give me 2,drinks then if i,only ordered,1,meal 1,chicken,sandwich,these,workers suck",SzpFv5GP5vzEOY2xYg1s2Q,0,0,1,-lS53fhEHX3AmXn2m9rC7Q

I was JUST there. I wanted a coffee with no whip cream and extra caramel. Super easy, right? Apparently not. They put extra whip cream, barely any caramel. I paid extra for it, so I asked them to remake it. The girl did, but tried to give it to me with, again, barely any caramel. I explained that I asked for extra and even paid extra. She got an attitude with me, then walked away. Another girl asked her what she was going and said, ""MORE f***ing caramel!?"" 

So sure as shit, the girl had to be a smart ass and put as much caramel as she could. Literally, the entire bottom was filled half an inch up of caramel. I couldn't help but laugh. What an immature and ignorant staff. I will never go here again. This place is a complete dump. I will definitely be contacting the district manager, because the manager here is a joke and doesn't take anything serious.",QSBFFl-nAUIjoENyw2v4KA,1,0,2,zQSTWimxOqFXOSRCrxldEQ

they cancelled the order while it was in the process of delivery. The cashier used her address but my name. Never let your card out of sight longer than a swipe.

The young lady working there handed us our drinks but not our pies. we asked for them and she said ""one second"" the manager or whoever she was literally told me ""you didn't order any pies!"" with an attitude saying it like I never did, when I know I did! I understand they were busy, so we! were patient but at the end it was a disappointment.. she also said ""I got a lot of people waiting in line if you wanna order your pies you can park in the front or drive all the way around to order them because I got a long line"" first of all, I waited so long to get my order, second They gave me the wrong order and third they could of handled situation differently and professionally!

3542972,2012-10-16,1,xI8O5h3Pa0MQlTWf93noTA,"This is a large, relatively modern-looking mcds. Its a bit grimy, which in mho, kind of defeats the purpose of the remodel. Why bother making it all pretty & modern if youre not going to wipe it down regularly?

The service here is ok. Food is standard mcds fare. 

The one reason we come here is for the HUGE four-story play area. The kids enjoy exploring it, and i enjoy getting a half hour of sanity.  theres a small space underneath for littler guys to play in, but this playplace is realistically more for older kids who can climb well. 

The kids room is completely closed off from the rest of the restaurant, which works great at keeping my boys from running off, and theres a separate bathroom in here just for aparents.  No changing table, which for some strange reason seems to be the way las vegas restaurants roll. I really hate that. 

Therefore they shouldnt be surprised when i change a poopy diaper on one of their posh bench seats since theres nowhere else to do it.
Maybe then they'll wipe it down afterwards... But dont count on it.",6ehZ3X1gaHe-fxzndNRweA,1,1,4,TFVpcr2EdXSxOnM14wrTJw
3599898,2015-07-02,0,xI8O5h3Pa0MQlTWf93noTA,"Wish I could give this place 0 stars.The employees are lazy. There's maybe 1 or 2 hard working employees. I was standing in line once, waiting and waiting and some 20 something year old girl employee kept looking at me, she knew i was trying to order but kept ignoring me. I eventually got tired of waiting. As I was walking out, she had a stupid little smirk on her face. If it wasn't for the fact that I was with my family and 2 year old nephew I would have jumped over that counter and gave her a piece of what her stupid attitude deserved. The drive through line is always ridiculous. Especially at night. They take forever to hand you your order and will only sometimes give u ketchup and napkins. The inside is nasty and smells like a giant toilet. There's always sketchy people hanging out in the front asking for money. Once in awhile there's a homeless person or 2 just hanging out inside . Awhile back there was one taking a nap in one of the booths -_- I would love to see this place shut down. The bathrooms are appalling. I hate this McDonald's so much. I have lived near this McDonald's long enough to know it needs lots of improvements before even considering being open.

The wait times are much longer in the drive thru and you're most likely missing something like your chicken nugget sauce, napkins, etc. Plus with the new drive thru you have to verify your purchase multiple times so be sure to still check your bag(s).",AXrouzqDq0yTGObjHuMAdQ,0,0,3,dhvuWAo2PZTC5qeCsLy1LQ

I am going to be yelping the McD on MLK and Lake Mead...sure hope it's not the same owner...stop cutting corners with your syrups, overcooking fries and not melting cheese. You can be slow as molasses, like Jack, but the difference is Jack's food is excellent quality,  hot and cheese melted.
