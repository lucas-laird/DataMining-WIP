A 20 percent gratuity automatically given to these servers no matter what! Our server brought my husband wet naps and extra napkins when he had one rib left. Then she was never to be seen again. I had to leave my table to find her for my check. She did not deserve a tip. I work in a restaurant in RI and my girls would run circles around these servers with smiles on their faces. Management needs to step up. 
I'm an owner at Tahiti and here yearly so we figured we would give them another shot. This time we ordered pizza to go. A 4 item pizza. The bartender informed us they were out of peppers. Ok no problem. We get to our room. You could count the toppings and it was missing pepperoni! Yes, we were charged for 4 toppings. Lol. I don't think there will be a third visit.

The name is a bit cheesy and initially turned me off to it, but it's actually quite good. They also have a really nice patio poolside so you can enjoy your meals outdoors. 

About the food: typical bar food (which I enjoy). I had the chicken fingers both plain and tossed in buffalo sauce. They are good both ways and come with fries. The fries are just okay I would say. My brother had a good Cobb salad and my dad said the fish and chips was excellent. I believe it's a cod fish - supposedly not all places use cod and my dad says when it's served with cod it's better. 

About the prices: I think average probably for Vegas. It's in the Tahiti Resort Wyndham property. Good place and I'd go back!",sTTiGs0N0Y9J1KIon_5NMA,1,0,4,hMFiK2K9y_HabFn8xhUs1w

The restaurant is small, it has a nice outdoor area with TVs although it was way too hot to sit outside and eat. We sat next to the TVs inside away from the traffic of people. When we arrived to the restaurant we were greater right away and told we could sit wherever we would like. A bit confused when we first came in because there is not sign, it was nice that a waiter was there when we arrived. Within minutes we were greeted by our waiter, and were given a menu. Minutes after he arrived to take our order. The Passion Fruit Margarita I got was very good, the Pina Colada my husband got he loved. I order the lettuce cups, no shrimp or chicken (I'm Vegan) they were very very good! I was actually full which was nice. My husband got a burger with fries, I do not remember the name of it but it was rare the way he likes and he absolutely loved it. Overall the experience here was great. The staff was friendly, the prices are on point, the food was delicious, and atmosphere nice, and pretty touristy. The menu is slim so not many choice, but satisfying.

We are owners at the timeshare where this bar is located in and overall I was disappointed. It's a nice bar with decent food but we are definitely skeptical about the ethics of the staff. No where on the menu or anywhere else do they let you know that gratuity is included in your bill until you're paying the tab. On your final bill they are supposed to stamp in red ink so that you can see the gratuity was included. My friend's bill did not have that stamp and I was distracted and did not see it on mine and we both paid double gratuity. On the third day my husband was playing the poker game at the bar and wanted to cash out. The bartender is the cashier for the machines. The bartender thought my husband was too drunk to notice that he shorted him $40.  A stranger gaming next my husband was nice enough to jump in and back my husband up.

We were served our beers immediately, but didn't pay any mind, thought our burgers would come soon. It took half an hour for a restaurant that was only moderately busy. At least the chef came out an apologized for the wait. Our beers got warm as a result of waiting for our food, so we asked for fresh cold ones. Bartender got snippy and said they serve beer all the time and no one asks for it with their food, we should have asked. Had we known how slow their service was, maybe we would have. The waitress comes over and apologizes to us, snippy bartender scolds the waitress, and waitress further apologizes to us in Spanish this time. Out of nowhere, BARTENDER HAS THE AUDACITY TO TELL HER FRONT OF US THAT WE'RE JUST UPSET OVER THE 20% TIP, as if we couldn't afford their $76 dollar bill for 3 burgers and 3 beers.

It looses the other three because of their 20% automatic gratuity. I don't mind on food so much but on drinks that is ridiculous. The average mixed drink is $9-$11. That means you are tipping $1.80-$2.20 per cocktail. Even worse, their ""Happy Hour"" which includes some well drinks, domestic drafts and food charges 20% on the full amount before the half off. Basically you can have two cocktails and chicken fingers for $16.00 before tax, not bad right?? Until you see you just had to tip $6.40 or at the rate of 40%. As an owner of this timeshare, I think I have paid enough without being forced to tip more than the average person would. They need to get rid of the automatic gratuity on the alcohol, it is the biggest scam I have ever seen. If you are that desperate for money, charge more for the drinks and food. Just be aware before you go so you don't experience sticker shock. There is not currently a sign posted or a notation on the menu telling you about this.

The hotel does offer a shuttle, but when in Vegas, it's inevitable that your feet will hurt and you will get tired and you will be sucked into eating at your hotel. If you are staying at the Tahiti Village you will have one choice - 17 South.

Though I usually try to avoid 3 stars while on vacation (Yelp snob), my feet hurt too badly to argue with a star rating. My husband and I ordered some sort of alcohol, a hamburger, sweet potato fries, and the Island Chopped Salad. For Vegas, the prices seemed reasonable for the portion sizes. And the food was fine. 3 stars? Yeah. Probably so. The burger tasted good, but had a weird sort of frozen meat after taste. The chicken in the salad was also poor quality. Sort of like the type of chicken you would expect to find in a salad pulled out of a freezer in a gas station. Meat quality aside, the meals were prepared nicely and had nice flavor. The stars of the show were the sweet potato fries. Definitely get those. In fact, just get those.
