If you want some delicious, authentic tacos, then this is the place to go to. I will have to warn you that they are not the usual small tacos. They are made in regular sized corn tortillas. The cook asked me if I would like beans added. I was under the impression that he meant on the side, but they would have been tasty either way. They also have affordable pricing based on both location and low overhead. If you are not intimidated by the neighborhood (which doesn't appear to be the safest), I recommend that you try this taco truck. You will not be disappointed.",-cjsGZjSVZyjJJUw5L_XbQ,0,0,5,pqnfA94-gdPuOm59XPRR-Q

There's something about enjoying your food standing up outside or sitting on plastic lawn chairs in a designated parking lot. Or how about choosing your ice cold glass bottle of Coca-Cola or Jarritos from the cooler of your choice. It's kind of exciting picking out your bottled beverage; kind of like Let's make a Deal show where you don't know what you're going to get from cooler number 1, 2, or 3. 

We found Felipe's Tacos #3 as we were driving along Rancho looking for another Mexican restaurant and we were pleased as we made a last minute decision to pull in. (Sorry car behind us, we were angry + hungry= hangry). Tacos are $1.50 each with your basic  choices of pollo, pastor, chorizo, cabeza, lengua, bistek. What makes the tacos out of this world is the fact that they press the tortillas to order and what a difference it makes! I could just eat the tortillas as soon as they're pressed then cooked on the flat top because the texture was slightly crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. There were 3 different sauces to enjoy with the tacos but I found that they didn't need the extra pizzaz drizzled over the meat. If spending less than $10 for food, drink and tip is your thing, then Felipe's may be the place for you.",QiVO1CAXajUamfYhjimaew,2,1,4,pCcsKQEjNNBSid59yEFxeQ

I swear this is what might happens. We had fish and shrimp tacos that were authentically amazing. I'm not Mexican though as a disclaimer but I think my point is still valid lol! The workers there are so pleasantly sweet. The woman helping us treated me like I was her grandchild, I loved the ""sweeties"" and the look of admiration as we but into our tacos. Definitely something my grandmother would do! Most tacos are $2 with specialities like tripe $2.50 and shrimp $3. Cards are accepted with a $1 fee. No taxes.

3753117,2015-01-04,0,MlIS0BxTR9QyPotGZ4JVUA,"We stumbled across this Taco truck while waiting waiting for a bus and we decided to get a quick snack.  Oh boy were we surprised....  Fresh pressed tortillas, perfectly packed and seasoned chicken tacos with frest coriander ($2), and the cervice tostadas were fresh, crisp and oh so refreshing ($3).    
By far the best Mexican food we have had in Las Vegas (and we lived in San Diego for some time so our expectations were high).
I just wish the truck was a little closer to where we live, we would be there a couple of times a week!!",Iald8XnParyH5scxNCm81A,1,0,5,bP0bK5j7xLeRbZPkbTZP3A
3938274,2015-12-13,0,MlIS0BxTR9QyPotGZ4JVUA,"Nice portions with home made tortillas. Is a taco stand , not your big chain place so it concentrates more on the flavor. Talking about that,the lengua is really good and the asada is a lot of flavor.

Worth the trip from the other side of town.",akLIKSw5zGxxWtWkNCYrJg,0,0,5,15_pcgr65toFhfxGrMl75w
4425414,2013-04-26,2,MlIS0BxTR9QyPotGZ4JVUA,"I love Felipe's Taco's, I think it is the best taco stand in town. Located off the corner of Vegas and Decatur in the parking lot of an auto shop, you can't miss it. They also have a hot dog stand but I have never tried it. I recommend the Carne Asada or the Al Pastor. They make the tortillas from scratch and everyone is hand pressed pre order. I also love the fact that the have real Coca-cola in the bottle. Great for the nights out drinking or when super lazy and refuse to cook. They are also good for when you are on a budget. Not open on sundays.",cykRUvJHfKHXjefx0BCKcA,2,2,5,ZTxSttZtg5dpEqDfWcjJ6A
4617398,2015-03-19,0,MlIS0BxTR9QyPotGZ4JVUA,Clean facility. Rated with an A. Kind staff that are extremely helpful and quick to cook up your meal. It's located on the corner of Vegas Dr. and Rancho with a good number of parking. I highly recommend their ceviche tostadas. Lots of different choices in meat selections for your tacos/burritos.

5051054,2013-03-04,0,MlIS0BxTR9QyPotGZ4JVUA,"I was in the search for Sinaloa tacos/Karinas which I knew was on the corner of Decatur and Vegas. I ended up seeing this bustling little cart and thought it was it. It was not and that cart was in fact across the street at the gas station. However, we were here and there was people so we stayed and ordered up a snack as planned. Felipe's tacos is in the Milford Automotive parkinglot and shares its space with a hotdog vendor so it's a easy way to tell where you are at. 

The menu is no frills with the meat types under the order window and then you can tell them in what vessel you want it (tacos, burrito, torta, quesadilla) from as far as I can tell. Pretty much everyone was going for tacos though. We ordered some cabeza and lengua. The plus of this place is you can see at the window the tortillas are being made fresh by hand. For $1.50 the tacos are a good size and come with onions and cilantro and they throw a few radishes and limes on your plate There is a DIY bar with 3 salsa bottles (a mild green, a spicy green, chipotle red) and some pickled red onions. 

Cabeza had good flavor and parts were tender, BUT it was in larger pieces and unfortunately the BF got a taco with really large balls of fat/gelatinous facial parts. Normally that mixed all up makes for flavor, but in a huge bite like that made for ick factor. 

Lengua was surprisingly good. This was very tender and good seasoning. It was prepared in a way that it fell apart in shreds so it just depends whether you're a fan of that or more toothsome cubed bites, but I thought it was solid. 

The tortilla was good and a bit crispy on the edges. 

I think it's probably a quality cart judging from the crowd and my lengua, but maybe for cabeza this is not our spot.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,3,3,3,P9aRHoI1wjJPFKrLZx11XA
