The service was poor,waited a long time (and when we got there was hardly anyone in the dining area) for service.  I can honestly say we had the spinach/artichoke dip with wonderful chips it was the best I have ever had and it was warm and that is where the warm ends. The food was served cold as Mr. ordered brisket sandwich-dressed up and I had junkyard dog, the bacon was strips and not diced as the menu said, so harder to eat, the onion crisps on the top of the hotdog were great.  There were some unique items on the menu.  The servers seemed to disappear.  The only thing our server did which was really nice is we needed refills on our diet pepsi and she brought out a pitcher of diet pepsi.. thank goodness she did that our we would have really been up a creek.  Nothing was taken off the table when we were finished eating and then I noticed no table had been cleaned as guests finished appetizers ..the plates just piled up.  BTW we did not present our groupon till we got our bill, so that was not the issue of the poor service.. man if those servers hustled more they would get better tips and maybe better reviews.",cjr1LELLivsTgksEJnuasg,0,0,3,_FP5lMKwkG2706lxrxk9Gg

Saw 3 tables walk out of restaurant. Table next to ours left food ordered on table and left because they were sick and tired of waiting for their order.  This place trys to come off as a bbq type of restaurant.  Only thing bbq is the sauce they pour on food. Nothing bbq.  We ordered ribs, brisket and flank steak.  Ribs were $22 for 5 ribs.  Ribs tasted boiled, fatty and no flavor. What a joke!  Brisket had no flavor except for bbq sauce and you get a small portion.  Flank steak was tough as shoe leather. This place is terrible!!  You may get a 2 for 1 coupon and still feel ripped off.  Upon leaving, noticed cook and waitress texting and talking on phone and standing around, while a bunch of tables waiting for food.

Also, if you are looking for a place to have a beer and watch your favorite game, this is your best option in Circus Circus as they have several large screens dedicated to sports.

I tried going to the bar and was promptly ignored.

Breakfast: 4 of 5-had the morning shuffle ( best scramble ever!) he had eggs Benedict, great sauce! Not too heavy. Pitcher of coffee brought to the table so you don't need to keep flagging down the waitress. Quick service! Home fries could have used a kick but were uniformly crunchy which is hard to come by.
Lunch: 3 of 5-  both of us shared the nacho platter, I am somewhat of a nacho platter expert and I was a little disappointed that they used the yellow nacho cheese instead of real cheese cause it makes the chips soggy, other wise just ok. We both had the mini sandwich sampler, delicious! Fries were great too! Shoe string thin and very crunchy. Had a coconut rum drink that I can't remember the name of, but that's because it was really good! It's apparent the hostesses are picked more for their hotness than customer service skills, as there was a wait despite having half the tables empty. A smile would have been nice too, because you are a hostess after all... 
Dinner: 5 of 5!!-  2 for 1 dinners!!! I had the 16oz melt in your mouth Cajun rib eye with the BEST mashed potatoes I have EVER had, he had the BBQ ribs, fell off the bone, we both agreed best we'd ever had. I HATE coleslaw, that being said my boyfriend almost stabbed me with a fork for trying to eat all of his, soooooo good! Topped it off with a giant keepsake porcelain toilet bowl filled with a mango rockin Rita margarita. OMG. Only regret I didn't have enough room left for deep fried twinkies that I really wanted to try!
Decor: 3 of 5 - ""Red Neck Pop Art"" not a classy joint but amazing food relative to the cost. Noted a large stage that was not being used. Why not!? Also would've liked to see more of the team circus circus bartender flair they so heavily hyped on the drink menu.  
What ultimately sealed the deal that we won was a comment I overhearfrom a woman while we were leaving ""bite"" at the stratosphere, to paraphrase ""I just spent $500 on sh$&&! Food in the sky and now I have to wait in line for an elevator? NEVER AGAIN!"" moral of the story, if you want some classy $h!&, don't go to Rock & Ritas, but if you're after some bangin food at a reasonable price and toilet bowls that over flow with booze, then this is your place!",W_-zuhpVXtuDLn8iutyDeA,3,1,4,km2U2_mNHECx7knPP44YoQ

My husband had the ribs with beans and cole slaw. He said the ribs were really tender and tasty. The beans has a little spice but the best side was the cole slaw. It was a wet slaw with lots of flavor and tomatoes as a twist.

The short version: glad we had the Living Social or this would have been an Epic Fail!

The long version: My husband and I bought a Living Social, $15 for $30, before we came to Vegas. We went in on the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend around 3pm. They were not busy and seemed to be adequately staffed.

We were seated quickly, but it took forever for the waitress to take our order. Then it took forever for us to get our food. Then it took forever to get the check. This would have been an easy place to skip out on the check! From start to finish, we were there over an hour and a half!

We shared a Caesar salad, portions were great, but way too much dressing. We were wiping dressing off the lettuce. My husband had the chicken quesadilla, we were not impressed. I ordered the Turkey Ham sandwich. Extremely disappointed! The description makes it sound like it will be a hot sandwich. All it is are cold cuts and a slice of Kraft cheese on Texas toast.

The saving grace was desert! If you go, don't go for the regular food; go for the deserts and drinks, because the grilled Krispy Kreme donut w/ ice cream was fantastic! The manager was really nice; she made appropriate chit chat while handling the Living Social discount.

Side notes:
* The internet connection sucks there.
* It took us almost an hour to get from New York, New York (our hotel) to Circus Circus (where Rock & Rita's is located) and 45 min to get back.
* Even w/ a Living Social or Groupon, we wouldn't go back.",aibqm2aKQg9kRYttllWq5Q,0,0,2,vc03mP4ozP5hz41MFhZLNA

I went here with my bf after seeing an add for the 1/2 off margaritas sign outside Circus Circus. We ended up not even getting the deal we went in for. We order those large drinks you see everyone on the strip walking around with. The bartender was GREAT! He was entertaining and welcoming. He made us drinks and even put on a show while we sat at the bar. During the show he and another bartender who was about to begin his shift put on a show throwing bottles and doing other tricks. During the show they gave every complimentary drinks. They tasted like water but it was still fun. I think by the time my bf and I left this bar we were drunk and loving it. This was my first time in Vegas so I was really enjoying myself. We stayed 2 hours. If we had stayed any longer I dont think  I would've been able to walk out of this place.

There are too many places that specialize in burgers and eggs to order that junk here. Well, I must give Rita's, despite the touristy atmosphere a decent nod on their brisket. It was sliced Texas style and was pretty tender with a choice of three sauces. I tried them all. Personally, I'm a good judge of brisket because I just ate at 36 diiferent BBQ places in the Southern USA while I was traveling for work. In the regards of those places, it doesn't come close, but this is Vegas and I can't recall finding much good brisket around town. It's $9.99 with a side dish (garlic red skinned potatoes needed more garlic) and a decent deal if your a brisket fan in the area. You can order at the bar too which makes it less lonely than grabbing a table inside. 
      OK, I will admit to using a lunch special coupon too, but it only saves you a $1 and on this visit I ordered the sloppy joe sandwich for $6.99.

We went here for an early lunch (almost empty might I add). We ordered the sandwich sampler since we really didn't find anything appealing. The sandwich sampler had a beef dip, sloppy joe, fried bologna, & bbq pork sandwich. All the sandwiches were served on Hawaiian sweet buns which made the sliders too sweet. The fried bologna had grey poupon that made it taste pretty unbearable. The sloppy joe was too tangy and the beef dip didn't even come w/the au jus sauce. The bbq pork was tender but because of the bun, it was too sweet.

Server Katheryn was horrible. We didn't even start eating yet and she brought us out our check. I had to wait 15+ min for a refill on water (after I had to remind her twice).

Food was decent. Shoestring fries were good, ""homemade"" chili on the chili burger had a sweet flavor, but lacked kick. Sadly, that's where it stopped. 

A $6 kids veggie platter consisted of some ranch, baby carrots, celery sticks, and some broccoli florets - something we could have done with $2 or so at a local grocery store's produce dept.

My wife ordered a French Dip, however there were out of baguettes, so they offered her something else or to prepare on a regular sesame bun. She opted for the latter, but that meant she could no longer easily dip the sandwich in the included au jus. It then took her 10 minutes to get someone's attention for some horseradish sauce to make the sandwich more palatable.

As for service, the place was less than half occupied, but it took the hostess 5-10 minutes to seat us. When they finally did, we were stuck in a corner (relative to other tables). Our server was NOT all that busy, but still far less than attentive. We had to get up and get our server's attention more than once when we needed sauce or refills. When we asked for more iced tea, she brought us the pitcher and left it at the table so we could pour our own. She had someone else deliver our check.

After being seated at one of the booths, we were given breakfast menus. The options were fairly limited but the prices were decent and the service was lightning fast.

I got the Breakfast Shuffle - three eggs shuffled with chorizo sausage, green onions, Monterey Jack and cheddar cheeses. It also came served with breakfast potatoes.

While the potatoes were very tasty the eggs were cook unevenly making for a weird experience - every bite was different in taste, texture and caused me to have a bit of morning anxiety... The cheese was flavorless and added nothing to the dish somehow. It hardened instead, which lead to me believe that it was of sub-par quality. As far as the green onions, and the chorizo, there was barely any of each in there. Honestly, I was not very impressed.

Having already known at the Circus Circus was mediocre, I had high hopes for this place, especially since you'd think that they'd step it up since there's such few options available in the hotel.

This place is INSIDE Circus Circus - that wasn't mentioned anywhere so it took a bit to figure it out as I was looking for a small BBQ shop on the street. If I had known in advance, I would have been prepared as Circus Circus is a low to mediocre experience known for it's low prices. It caters to families and kids, and I saw more kids and strollers as we walked from the garage to Rock & Rita's than I did for the following 4 days we spent in Vegas - combined.

This is typical megacorp institutional food, not a locally owned BBQ shop, which I thought it would be as there was no mention of Circus Circus on the Groupon. I'm guessing that was intentional.

If you're staying at CC with your kids and you need adult time by yourself, this is a place to escape to in order to get a quick bite, a beer (they had reasonable beer choices), and some adult conversation.

My mother ordered a root beer float and decided she liked it. However, they only gave one water for a table of four?? Were we supposed to share it? Not sure about the logic of that one. 

We ordered a classic burger with fries, a chorizo jalapeno chowder, a BBQ chicken sandwich with salad instead of fries, and a two meats plate with veggies and mashed potatoes. Burger was okay - normal, I would guess. Dad didn't like his soup - he said it was too spicy. But it looked pretty good. 

Fries were delicious. They're cut tiny, but they're incredibly crispy crunchy and yummy. I finished his whole side of fries with the pickles. Yum. 

For the two meat combo ($29.99??) we got ribs and tri-tip. Tri-tip almost turned to dust in our mouths. It was soo dry. They tried smothering sauce over it, but it didn't really help. 

The ribs didn't have much flavor, so we had to ask for more BBQ sauce. My mom liked it better after that, but I didn't get to try it. Was already too wary.

As for the side of beans,  I'd rather buy my own can of Bush's baked beans thank you very much and not pay for someone to ""prepare"" them for me.

His burger looked great and he was happy with it. My sandwich was good but not great. The meat did not taste freshly smoked. And I prefer more BBQ sauce. The fries, however, were awesome. Crunchy shoe string potatoes with tons of flavor.

My friend ordered a couple of drinks. A pina colada to start with some Malibu rum in a test tube to mix in. But when our bill came, and with this initial drink plus our food, the value of my certificate was still not used up. So another drink was ordered. The waiter tried to bring it free of charge. That is cool and all but we were trying to get an actual bill rather than a free meal because neither of us had cash for a tip. We wanted to put it on a card. So the waiter brought us a seperate bill charging $0.01 for the second drink and then we left the tip. Kind of a round about way of doing it but hey, whatever works right?",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,0,3,6e8mR1RNfD0um7JGfw7UrQ

Servers were super FRIENDLY.

Now for the sad part....

Food didn't taste good.  I mean, it was edible, but not on the tasty side.  We ordered their sampler (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rock-and-ritas-las-vegas?userid=N4K69ZdyU-B8NzVYxwjK0A#NwszeOYtFHoGOHLtNpnqcQ) and their brisket dish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/rock-and-ritas-las-vegas?userid=N4K69ZdyU-B8NzVYxwjK0A#UYhmORthQuXqctUxW7eVgg), along with 2 sodas which totaled to about $50.   Pretty pricey... except, we had a comped meal from Circus Circus.

Anyway, I don't know why the fried pickles tasted weird, but they did.  I liked their french fries and the chili cheese nachos from the sampler.  The nachos were decent, but the cheese dried up so quickly.  The briskets were soft and tender, but it smelled funny.

These are one of those restaurants where you really gotta use ketchup, bbq sauce, and hot sauce to make your meal taste good.",N4K69ZdyU-B8NzVYxwjK0A,10,11,5,D54V5UL7DwM1a8XzUoUdXw

When I was sifting through the menu I saw pictures of little mini toilet bowls filled with Chili and blue alcoholic beverages. I'm sure they thought this was clever but it just conjures up images I don't want to think about before I eat.

My cousin and I ordered the ribs which was about $22.00. When it came out mine was okay but it wasn't ""fall off the bone terrific"". My cousin's was tougher my husband even had a hard time cutting into it. The waiter came by and asked how the food was. My cousin says, ""Do you really want to know""? The waiter cautiously says, ""Yes"". ""I'm not a complainer but these are the worst ribs I have ever had in my life."" Just for the record my cousin is a complainer LOL but she had a point. The customer service here is really good that is why I gave them three stars instead of two. They were nice and offered her another menu item to replace the ribs and they removed her ribs off the bill. She ordered a medium rare burger which came out really rare. It just looked like they seared both sides of the burger. Most of it was red so my cousin didn't really eat it but was tired of complaining. I didn't  finish my ribs either they made me queasy.  I had a bite of my husband's jalapeno burger and I wished I ordered that instead. My brother loved the junkyard dog. He said I wouldn't like it though because it was salty. My brother and husband ordered a krispy creme sundae.  I had a bite it was a little too sweet for me.

The chili hamburger was good and the seasoning on the shoe string fries were good as well. Mean prices were pretty average however the drinks were waaay overpriced! You can use casino credits for the food, not alcohol, so if you have comp $s than this is a good place to eat. 

Service at the bar was terrible, so I would recommend trying to eat at the main restaurant instead of one of the side bars. 

Checked out the $0.25 Wings during football games. Wings aren't worth more than $0.25 each so no huge savings and one person needs more than a dozen, but taste isn't bad. 

So second time around... OMG changed my mind... hamburger was not fully cooked, wings made me sick... or maybe it was the burger. Fries were chewy. Service.. just as bad as before.

One thing that really stood out is when we were leaving, our server said ""have a blessed day"" I'm not religious or anything, but that's something I've never heard of and something I feel adds a very personal touch.

The service...pretty bad. Our waitress seemed annoyed by us the whole time and flustered whenever I asked a question. I don't think she likes her job.

The Margaritas: Uh, how can you have ""rita"" in your name and then make THE WORSE MARGARITA I'VE EVER HAD. And that's saying a lot because I've tried them all. 

Basically, for $6, soda would have been more worth it.  It was crushed ice in a plastic cup with a salted rim, filled with water and a splash of tequila. I think they put a tiny bit of sweet and sour to make it yellow. It was tequila flavored water. Not a margarita.

When the waiter came back, I asked if I could get a Caesar Salad, instead of Caesar Dressing, Ranch Dressing. The waiter then told me that what I wanted isn't a Caesar Salad. I was kind of ticked off because I knew what a Caesar Salad was and I didn't ask for his opinion. Moreover, I just wanted the salad, plain, with a side of ranch dressing. The waiter then went on a tangent explaining how the Caesar dressing is mixed into the Caesar salad; to be honest I was over it already and just wanted to leave, but the waiter the waiter finally took my order down and took it back to the chef. It took about 30 minutes in order to get a bowel of lettuce, croutons, and parmesan cheese with a side of ranch dressing. The lettuce was fresh as hell, which was probably the best thing that came out of this Rock & Rita experience.
