The original is always great. But the other flavors are so incredible it's nice to mix it up! And let's not forget, the shots per drink are very very friendly servings. About 10 shots per drink. Non stop pouring!!!!! No measurements here. Worth every penny in Vegas. This is where you will get the most for you money!!!!!! I promise you won't be disappointed.",vfZMuq0Bi4TOmc3qv0ePqg,0,3,5,nBHg5oX5SwxEYGITjGDdlw

I'm a cheapskate but this is my vice EVERY single trip, multiple times. Worth the price, great bartenders.  Makes the losses at the casino bearable for sure - they'll do the trick and are so good you forget you're drinking.  Used to always order the original mojito until I discovered the blackberry mojito with Malibu.  . This place is actually part of the reason I return to Vegas.",RYy53DVv7Un6fOLlq8MzRw,0,0,5,89NVQNERcNbftXvKlzPzXg
