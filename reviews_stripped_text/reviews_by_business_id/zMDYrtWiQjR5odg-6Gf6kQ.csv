I'm not even sure if they serve illy coffee anymore since they just use regular cups now...they probably don't which is why it's no good anymore. I still find myself coming here because I work next door and it's convenient to just come here versus driving to Starbucks. They have pretty decent breakfast sandwiches and bagels but that's all I've really had here, so I can't comment on any of the other pastries. The lady here is nice if you get to know her, otherwise you probably wouldn't agree. They will also validate your parking if you buy something",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,2,0,3,1T-rN1uzdz0ZsjkOl9BPhw

I have also tried their chicken caesar salad for lunch and it was good as well. (Got it as a lunch special and the price is really good!) 

Overall, happy with this place. Hope they stay around for a while! :)",dgVJzkjTHapHRloRKYv4bA,0,0,4,NNs66QPcwFRDktw04TM9WQ
