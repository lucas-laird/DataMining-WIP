FOOD: The food is different depending when you go so it can be a hit or miss with this restaurant. If you go during a slow time, they have less food and the food that's available is cold and stale. So the cafeteria is broken up into stations. The stir fried station offer dishes like fried rice, chow mein, steamed clams, pork belly, and fried vegetables. The dim sum station doesn't have many dishes, but it offers the basics like shu mai and har gow. The meat station offers various skewers and steamed soy sauce chicken. The noodle station allows you to create your own noodle soup bowls with whatever toppings you choose. Dishes range from $3 to $11 each. Spent over $50 for just two people and that was over-priced for cafeteria food, but it was worth a try. Wish this place was a buffet though.

DRINK: The dessert station offers boba drinks if you want something freshly made. They have bottled drinks in the cafeteria or you can pay for a fountain drink at the counter. They do serve hot tea.

DESSERT: The dessert station lacks variety so I didn't get anything from there, but the dim sum station sometimes has some sweet pastries that aren't too bad.

ATMOSPHERE: The cafeteria is pretty with colorful Asian lanterns. The cafeteria stations are very clean because it's new so I just hope it stays that way. The seating area is very unique, but most of the seat are very uncomfortable so get the cushioned booths if you can. The staff is new and untrained right now so they kept dropping and spilling everything, but I'm sure they will learn and get better.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,16,13,4,Afb9J3kXvsSBRCHEFV8z5Q

You wait to get seated, then wait in a disorganized line, cafeteria style. There was only one lady at the first station and sometimes she'd get help from another lady. They'd help whoever got their attention first lol

Our food got warm to cold by the time we ate cause of all the waiting to trying to get our food.

The guy cooking and cutting the meat  used the same tongs to handle raw meat and cut up cooked food.. we asked for the ribs and BBQ pork. He pulled out raw meat, put it on the grill and then went to cut our bbq with those tongs without washing or changing it lol..

Boba milktea was watered down, not good. Get the canned drinks. 

I liked the egg drop soup, it had chestnuts in it.

The xiao long bao were dry on the top but nice and juicy, the juiciest we've had in vegas in fact. Best part of our meal. One star for that.

Braised pork had a peanut and sesame-like flavor, not too good and they would include bones with no meat on it,  wth..

Bbq pork was dry and tough but had good flavor. Ribs were okay but slightly salty.

2140442,2017-01-12,1,dA_Xl2A45YVc9nnYLK0oqA,"Located on the first floor of the Lucky Dragon casino. Self parking is free and valet parking is also available. Dragon's Alley has so much potential, but our trip here was so disappointing.  Here's a summary of what we had:

Beef chow fun- we had the end of the buffet bowl, so our noodles were all hard and chewy since it was dried out. It was also cold and flavorless. I'd only get these again if they were more fresh, since it was only $2

Fish balls- overpriced $4 for 4, and they were alright. They were reheated in a broth, but only the bottom two were soft. The other two on the top didn't reach the broth, so they were cold and barely edible

Spicy tofu- one of the better dishes, but how can you go wrong with tofu sautéed in mapo sauce?

Roast duck- small portions, but actually and a decent amount of meat. We'd get this again if we were craving a few bites of duck. 

Overall, I wish the best for this restaurant to improve their food quality. There was plenty of seating and the décor was nice. Dragon's Alley is basically a Chinese food cafeteria, but they need better warming trays to keep the food hot. I think that it could really be a great place if they paid more attention to the details of the food and made it in smaller batches. Also, it was a slow night, so they didn't have much turnover.

What was annoying was the cook at the noodle station. I'm Chinese, but my girlfriend is not. I could understand the noodle station cook chatting with another customer in Cantonese about the food. But when my girlfriend asked him, politely, what he had at his station, he SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND GRUNTED.

The cafeteria inside of the casino offers a lot of different  small plates priced at about ($4-$5) each, dimsum plates are $5 each (but not usually served hot/fresh) and some dishes even costing only $2 like congee and sweet and sour soup. They also have boba and a soup noodle station. 

We ordered the: 
- Singapore noodles plate: curry flavor is good, no shrimp in these though! 
- Soup Noodles- can get a choice of rice/thin/ thick noodle cooked to order. Comes with couple of pieces of Chinese broccoli, shrimp, beef balls, and fish balls. Choice of chicken or beef broth! We got the beef broth . Broth is kind of salty, overall pretty good.
- Hot and Sour Soup- not really hot/spicy.
- Duck small plate- good, but oily 
- Soy sauce chicken- prob my fav of the small dishes we tried, chicken was juicy + flavorful 
- boba: apparently they have a mango slush boba that's great but they ran out of mango :(. We got the blueberry slush instead which used fresh blueberries - but it was too sweet for my taste! Boba itself had great texture, and would get that with just their normal milk tea (or Thai tea which the nice lady let me sample!).

The food while fair priced was extremely lack luster. We walked bast the dim sum and saw them pull out frozen dumplings, so we vetoed that station. I would have assumed with 5 people there one would be making them fresh. 

The Singapore noodles were greasy with no flavor. The beef and mushrooms was our favorite! The spices on it actually gave it flavor that we unfortunately didn't experience elsewhere. 

The grill station is a great concept with skewers of meat but I'd rather them be cooked to order then sitting. I got 2 overcooked ""beef"" and inedible chicken.

The beef really stood out for me the flavor and the tenderness were fantastic but a little fatty. It would have been perfect with steamed rice but I only saw fried rice. The rice and the chow mein tasted fine but it wasn't extraordinary. I'm typically afraid to order chicken because it's either smelly, tough or too dry. This chicken was tasty but be careful of the tiny bones.

Once the host(ess) figures out how many are in your party,you will be directed to a table where you will be dining after getting your food. None of that typical stress about finding a table to eat at once you procured your food.  Then it is off to grab a plastic tray and order the food you want from the different stations in this ""best of the street foods from Asia/China"" concept cafeteria.

From my understanding, the menu is not static, although they will have the basics I stock at all times (or the cook/chef will be in the process of making a fresh batch).  In fact one of the features I really love about this place is the open kitchen where anyone interested in seeing how Chinese food are prepared can get their fill of the culinary actions.

As far as food goes, the best value are the plates of roasted duck. The Noodles Station serves up generous portions of fresh noodles and toppings (although varieties of toppings was limited to just cooked chicken when I was there, and other photos uploaded on Yelp indicated a larger selection).  The Wok Station serves prepared Lo Mein ($2), Singaporean Noodles, and typical Chinese dishes such as Mongolian Beef ($4), Stir Fried Long Beans and Beef.

The Dessert Station serves a mixed of Western desserts (e.g., Cheesecakes, Muffins and Danishes) and what looks like traditional desserts serve at dim sum restaurants and also Boba Teas.

Of all the items I tried on my first visit, the roasted duck was my favorite. I ate it with my noodles and upgraded a fairly plain noodle dish to a Roasted Duck Noodle.  The Lo Mein was decent, but for the $2 price it was well worth it.  

Sadly I had no room left for dessert, so I can not offer any additional insights on that portion of the menu offering.

Although the wait is shorter during their off hours, the food is relatively fresher during the lunch and dinner rush. I personally would not mind a little wait for food near the peak of the taste, although during that time Roasted Duck was long gone.

Definitely worth checking out if you will be at the Lucky Dragon.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,9,8,4,T4dgrGtBsagsCg8q9Hnkqw
