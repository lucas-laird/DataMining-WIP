I never expected such a small restaurant can have so awesome food for such a cheap price , but I believe it's only for real Chinese food lovers tho. I was in China for many years and the food of this restaurant is of authentic Sizchuan style.
I talked to one of the waitresses and found out she was a UNLV student and all of the rest study in UNLV, too. They are very nice . I guess it's because they study hospitality so that they know how to serve and be considerate lol
Btw, before I checked out, the waitress asked whether I work in UNLV  and she told me this restaurant has permanent 10% off for UNLV students because they want to say thanks to the students who supported their business. I am amazed such a small restaurant is thinking about social responsibility ?! What the f... 
Anyway, definitely will come back again!",-RysHKtENY1GT7Qa4LB7CQ,1,0,5,FpYZ47KjS-BGxmc9lhczew

We have tried a few other dishes and they are great also. Its dirt cheap and has a large menu - perfect!,BuKN22G8IY_rIuLLZ1Z9Xw,0,0,5,Pdec3_Nn37uuiT9Hbz-2HQ
1949958,2015-04-09,2,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,"I never thought a Chinese restaurant could be so bad until I came here for dinner yesterday. My bf and I were originally going to eat at Aloha Kitchen (right next door) but we both thought, how about Chinese?? So we decided to give this place a try. It looked pretty nice and they had like 3 families having dinner there, so I thought it was gonna be good. 

Service: once we got in, the host/waitress took us to a table...without menus lol. She say us down and asked us what we'd like to drink. She then brought us the waters we asked for... Still no menus. We were thinking, did she think we knew what we wanted already? Haha. THEN she finally gave us menus. Like after 5min of sitting down. Oh and that water she gave us? Was warm and didn't give us even one refill during our visit. My bf and I finished our waters during our meal and didn't have any more :( she barely checked up on us, and when she did she was never aware of what we needed. For instance, refills. And one of the dishes we ordered was a soup, and she gave it to us without and spoons lol. We waited like 5min and she never came to give us spoons so I had to ca her up and ask for spoons and she was like ""omg oh yeah!"" So basically, they were definitely lacking service. Also, it wasn't busy at all in the restaurant, but service was ridiculously slow. At the end of the meal it took forever to get her attention that we wanted the check, while we were only like 15ft away from her! And after she gave us the check it was like another 10min for her to pick it up. It was just bad....

Food: okay onto the food. Can I start off with how high the prices are for the dishes?! They average $10/dish. You would think you'll be getting food worth your money right? Haha well.... We ordered the house combination fried rice, orange chicken, and minced beef egg drop soup. Two words: NO FLAVOR. For any of them! Well, the Orange chicken wasn't bad, it did have flavor, but didn't taste like any orange chicken we've ever tasted. First off, the Orange chicken was near the color orange..lol they should change its name to black chicken! When it was first served to us we were so confused if they got out order right because it didn't look like any kind we've seen, nor tasted! It tasted more like teriyaki and molasses put together. The only thing I liked about it was the way it was battered and fried. That was good. Other than that, nope. The fried rice here was the most bland fried rice I have ever tasted in my life. They put like no seasoning for taste at all! The meats in it had absolutely no flavor whatsoever, and especially the shrimp in it. It tasted fishy. Gah, I couldn't eat any of its meats bc of that so I only picked at the rice and I would drown it with soy sauce to add flavor to the flavorless dish. I just don't understand how a restaurant could mess up on fried rice.. Anyway lastly, the mince beef egg drop soup. Tasted like boiled WATER with minced beef and chopped tofu thrown into it. I couldn't finish even a tiny bowl serving of it.


To sum it all up, we are not coming back here and I advise others to find a better Chinese spot to visit. There's no flavor in the foods and the service is lacking and I won't pay their high prices for that. Goodness, I don't understand how their menu is so expensive and their dishes have no flavor. Where does the money for the food go?! I apologize for such a harsh review, but I've never experienced something like this before.",X7zysG3Cja6G2blwDyE76Q,3,0,1,172q_M7k4XpuPllzsHCIdg
2195279,2016-04-07,0,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,"Meh... Ordered several occasions at Jugoo. The food is quite salty, not enough flavor, and VERY oily.  Ordered pickled vegetable with intestines, and the intestines were not cleaned very well, had gross stuff inside. Oh well, it's intestines, what can I say.",9qXweTtCHjUT1hdKBfLmXQ,0,0,3,Nu3wAEEyl9tZk8iLdDQ6Vg
2308860,2014-04-23,0,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,"Awesome place for spicy food when your in the mood, try the sliced pork with chili, so good . It was closed down and they had the best twice cooked pork , then reopened, they have most of the same stuff, but if you love spicy then this is the place, small cozy and good authentic food.",UE1bsVY8You01ufabmDv8g,2,0,4,TBZQQqg1qbZHCuNVaTak2g
2318510,2014-10-21,0,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,"This place needs help. I've only been here once but was not impressed at all. Prices were high. Quality was low. Rice is extra although the girl at the front gave to me a little for no charge. She was sweet but I don't even know if she understood what I said. Not really that tasty either. It looked like only relatives were the ones eating there. The kid said they bought from the old owners and also that the chef that stayed from the old place was let go recently even after staying with the new owners. The menu is a little complicating. Just very plain and the headings and the items were the same font which makes it hard to discern between the different categories. Wow! I should really be an adviser. So many places I go to that I could help with only a few small changes. But, no one thinks I know what I'm talking about.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,1,0,2,Q733npsi51-aC9-ILb4J5A
2332144,2015-03-07,1,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,"I randomly drove around Vegas navigating the outer areas of the strip in search of food not a high end dining experience nor buffet, but something local. 

We found the New Jugoo (or as my receipt says ""New Ju Goo Chinese Res"")

The menu is good, I think it's Szechuan styled, not Cantonese cuisine, with chicken, pork, beef and seafood options.

They're big portions and the pricing is okay at roughly $10-15 per entree. It's probably best for ""family style"" where a group orders a lot of dishes and shares 'em all together.

The service is fast and friendly.

I had the Chow Mein as well as the Black Pepper Beef, both were excellent.

This is not a place you'd take a date to in that dress to impress style, but more like comfort food and down n' dirty eating and casual dining.

Overall, it's probably not a destination dining restaurant that I'd make it a point to return to every trip to Vegas, but if i were a local or in the area, I'd come back again as it feels reliable and a decent value in all aspects.

It's better than going to a PF Chang's or Panda Express and a lot cheaper than the fancy hotel casino Chinese places on the strip.",Vkj42md-5O3VoOD9pBg6Sw,3,1,3,5CiDqMD9Dugs7CYvybB74A
3696989,2015-08-14,0,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,Absolutely the worst Chinese.  I've ever ate.   I'm very disapointed   I ordered l57  chicken w string beans.  Lunch special. First of all it was 7.50 for a kid size portion. The chicken I kept spitting out each piece. Covered in pure fat. Very low quality meats. I pushed the chicken to the side. Ate the old wrinkled up beans  because I was so hungry.  I didn't send it back because I was so hungry. Ate rice and beans. Never ever will return or recommend this place. They are right next to my fav aloha kitchen. Which is my fav. Never ever had a bad meal there. Always consistent.   So please skip new jugoo   Go next door to aloha!!!!!,OwlvbsQ5tX7kF2x_l3JVPg,0,0,1,QTkU9t9nFAHn3rktHF1WCA

4127833,2014-06-03,0,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,"They have an extensive menu and a shorter lunch special menu. The lunch special is an entrée or an entrée and a vegetable. I had kung pao beef, and wanted to order eggplant (they were out) and ordered Buddha's vegetables instead. Both were decent. The plate came with a good amount of rice. Despite having a lot of dried red pepper, the kung pao wasn't especially spicy. The vegetable tasted like it may have been cooked with chicken broth. 2-entrée lunch plus a soda came to just over $10.",-4JDJeFS0YAYSiSvIshGLQ,0,0,3,lveqJZzYj-P-1pzmMtNoJw
4606020,2016-10-15,2,YDrHSEW-O-XLz4DckcyMzw,"This place is a complete disappointment. The service was horrible, food was not the quality it should have been for the price and they tried to overcharge us. 

When receiving the check, the price for each item was about two dollars over the listed price on the menu. After confronting the waitress about it, she already knew what I was upset about. She then proceeded to ask me what I wanted her to do about it. I told her I want you to give me the menu price, she walked away and came back with another receipt that listed the correct price. 

Overall my experience here was quite disappointing and I will not be coming back here again.",bKFaaIlR96aoXsC-LblH_w,2,1,1,hxVBhLlmR0bFwBBfTh02EQ
