Long Review:
As I browsed at their flier, I checked if they had an actual location in Vegas (heard of a trick con artists use) and they did but it only had around 2 stars :/ I gave them a chance anyways and ordered. I got 2 16"" specialty pizzas, 25 pc hot wings, cheesy bread, and fries. The total was around $66 and the call ended before I could ask for a time estimate. Tbh I think they over charged bc my total estimate was around $57 including delivery and tax. As I waited, I decided to go through the yelp reviews and became more and more worried about my order but I basically placed all my hope in the few positive reviews (Did those review have low pizza standards or something? bc Lil Caesars is better) I later called in to see when my order would arrive and the lady (Tina... i think?) said every order is 45 minutes. Soon after that call, our order had arrived. Not bad...the 2-hour wait horror stories weren't always true 

Before dropping the food off the deliver guy called again to reconfirm the location. The food looked promising, no mistakes regarding the food, but instead of a 2-liter bottle of dr pepper, they gave us 6 cans, i guess it could've been worse ? Overall the pizza was ok. Honestly wouldn't buy again, the toppings were fine and the amount was good but the crust was so underwhelming and thin. Very greasy. Cheesy bread was good. Wings were mostly hard and dry, I'd recommend actually adding sauce. It seemed like they gave us an old batch then added a couple fresh ones to make it up. Fries were good. They were just normal fries lol. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. If you were extremely hungry then maybe, but it's Vegas and the food options are endless.",v4r9bk5l8LcpzgKidhxYoA,0,0,2,2Cvf4rLDjiacTkNoVA_M0A

I first called at 7:09 and was put on hold 3 times. When asked the delivery address I gave the man on phone the hotel name 4 times, which he should have known if for no other reason the menu was slipped under the door.

I tried to order a 12"" pizza but was told the minimum delivery order was $15. I looked at the menu, mentioned it said nothing about a minimum order (a 12"" is $12.99) and it meant with ""that's our policy,"" so I ordered a 14"" at $15.99.

At 8:02 I called to see where the pizza was and was told it would come in 15 minutes. It finally came at 8:34. The only positive of this entire experience was that the delivery lady was pleasant, even if the pizza was lukewarm by the time I could eat it.

That brings it from a 4!to 2 star. C'mon show passion and care about customers and youll make more money that way then being tight with products, what a shame. Could be a 5 star place!",KkkcimK1PS9JhL1_AajbMA,0,0,2,eEC-Eh3Sq0z49GEXN9DPMw

Told the lady when we ordered that we were paying with a card, she said the driver would have a card reader. The driver didn't have the reader so I called in the card number, the lady at the shop tried to charge me $2 extra. Pizza was cold and not what we ordered.",0CeD1r-OH_EQc6w2GxWlXg,0,0,1,wj4Sen3bLu85o1QloselGw
