Trey, the waiter/manager/do-all guy was fantastic and was very patient with a group of old timers.  We all loved the food, the atmosphere and the great treatment as valued guests. We all had pork ribs, plus one of my guests had the brisket.  All were delicious, which I've grown to expect from the Road Kill Grill.

As we followed the directions on Google Maps, it lead us towards the mountains to the Clark County Shooting Complex. First I thought, Google maps lead us to the wrong location. But it was right, the restaurant was hidden inside the shooting complex. 

The restaurant wasn't much, just a small counter surrounded by a dining area. There were only two guys took the orders and prepared the food. 

We ordered the Brisket sandwich and the rib teaser. The brisket sandwich had a generous amount of brisket and it was very tender. The same can be said about the ribs. Both were delicious and it exceeded my expectations. I thought the BBQ would be mediocre but it was some great tasting BBQ. 

The restaurant is definitely a hidden gem.",isIgfxN4EezltNageG2Tzw,5,6,4,ylr2CXu_thw5stdiQkHuhA

Continue driving north on Decatur until you get to the shooting range and then follow the signs towards the shooting center. Road Kill Grill is inside there. 

PSA They do not have the full menu that they do at the other location. This was likely a cafeteria for shooters to get snacks and stuff they decided to open up a delicious bbq spot here, but why? The location sucks and the lady said they are usually slow in the summer because no one wants to go shooting in a billion degree weather. This location has a small bbq menu and a few other non-bbq items like corn dogs, quesadillas and chili cheese fries. There is also a vending machines with frozen burritos, ice cream, drinks and snacks. 

We both ordered the 3 meat combo for $17.95, which includes 3 meats and 2 sides. I chose pulled pork, brisket and hot links with mac n cheese and fries. My bf got ribs x2, and brisket with mac n cheese and beans. We also got bottled water $1, and Gatorade $2. 

Our food came out fairly quickly which is great cuz we were hungry! The 3 meat combo was huge and definitely enough to make 2/3 meals. The fries were hot and crispy and they had ranch and fry sauce for dipping which were both house made and delicous. The beans were really good. They had a smoky flavor and a bit of a bite to them. My favorite side was the Mac and cheese. It was so cheesy and delicous. It was like if you look up comfort food in the dictionary, this mac n cheese would be there. So good. 

All of the meats came unsauced and they provided regular and hot bbq sauce on the side. The pulled pork is always my fav but this one was very salty. I really liked the hot link which wasn't very hot, and you get two of them. The ribs were St. Louis and had a nice smoky flavor, but they were kind of dry and not super hot. They weren't fall off the bone and had a bit of a chew to them, I wonder if they were cooked a few days before? Still good but not my fav. The sauce helped a bit! I enjoyed the brisket the best, it was tender and needed no sauce. 

The service was friendly and the food was good, but I'm not sure I'd go out of my way to make the trek to this place again.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,4,2,4,vz6Exff0-Zzi34vwuEOxZA

It's a big place meaning the land the BBQ joint SIT ON. I say this because when you walk in to order your food, that is all the space the inside has. About 10 people can fit inside. Stand in line, order your food, pay for your food then walk out and turn left and left again to a shaded are to eat your food. The food is very tasty. I had the combo of pulled chicken and rib tips my two sides were green beans and collard greens with a side of Mac and cheese. It also came with a corn bread cake. It's was as Guy would said on point. Very favorable. We also met a great family who was visiting from North Carolina who was visiting the area and checking it out because of the Diners Drive in and Dives. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was 100 degree out and sitting in the heat with the dry winds was a little uncomfortable.

I was shocked, because I had NO idea that there was a second location, here at the range. 
I've been wanting to try the original Road Kill Grill for a minute, so I was thrilled when mom and dad offered to buy me lunch. 

We tried: 
The Brisket sandwich
Pulled Pork tacos
Mac n cheese.

The Brisket was amazing.  It actually heated up pretty well, as I took half home to my husband.  The meat was tender and flavorful, even without the great BBQ sauce that they provided.  Loved this.  Will DEFINITELY have it again.

Pulled Pork tacos:  Have I mentioned that I'm not a pork fan?  I swear I never used to be.  Sometimes I still get squicked out ordering or eating it, but these tacos were the BUSINESS.  So good.  Tender meat, shredded to perfection.  Cheese.  A mystery sauce (I think maybe a cilantro creme?).  Onion.  My only wish was that the corn tortillas were a little more cooked.  They seemed under done/raw-ish to me.  But they were still delicious.   I begrudgingly shared one with my dad (since there were 3 street tacos), and he agreed.  Delightful.  

The mac n cheese:  I liked it.  It could have been creamier, and the noodles were mushy soft...but I like it that way.  My husband wouldn't have enjoyed it, but he can write a review if he tries it.  I liked it a lot.  Really good, and you can tell its homemade and not boxed.

I ordered the three meat combo and got:

Hot Links - Pretty Good and nice flavor

Rib Tips - Pretty good and even better if left in the sauce overnight...

Briskit - A little dry but decent flavor...Their sauce is muy fuego...the spicy isn't spicy but its so damn good. I'm a fan of not putting condiments or adding extra shit to food that has been prepared for you because I believe it should be good the way it is. However this sauce with that little dry briskit made it good.

Mac & Cheese - You can't fuck up mac & cheese and if you do you need to stop cooking...so yes of course this was good and you can tell they used real cheese instead of that powdered or liquid form.

Green Beans - Ehhh yah it reminded me of them frozen green beans maybe cause its soaked in some broth but yah I should have gotten their greens...

Cornbread - who doesnt love cornbread and bbq...

Honestly I eat a fuckin lot and I couldn't finish the 3-meat combo (pause)...they give you so much good food for your buck that it is worth it. Plus the way all the hard work, passion and dedication is resonated in the food how can you not love this shit. Good Merican BBQ at it's finest.",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,4,1,4,MOxUzgGVjwc4jADBmfDFtg

Although this location is a little hidden from the main road, this restaurant serves delicious bbq-style platters for a very reasonable price! Once again, their customer service is above and beyond your typical restaurant experience!",wEUTvcluXA29lakzRpnXRg,0,0,5,ZRqL5UUGXjlHhnLOFwoglg

My husband is from southern VA and is a BBQ fanatic (Carolina style mostly). We got the pulled pork and chicken sandwiches thought they tasted like ""BBQ"" you can make at home by putting meat and sauce in a crockpot. The bread was great. As was the macaroni and cheese and French fries we got for sides. Decent meal, we just thought the meat would be smoked to perfection and that was not the case",zaM1hiWPpC3SZJ5hbOHEQw,0,0,3,E4Gh-X3kncfKxq7BSu67aQ
5492422,2016-03-21,6,3qIFv-MbDoj-gDigpo_FgA,"Genius idea to put their second location inside the Clark county shooting complex!  Pretty much guaranteed business since there is NOTHING else out there.  With that said their ribs are legit and I would travel to try them out...but the good news is they are just minutes from Aliante!  This location looks like a normal grill at any sporting complex.  Small and dinky looking...but plenty of indoor and outdoor seating.  The menu is a lot smaller than their original location, but has the goodies like ribs, pulled pork, brisket sandwich, hot links.  They also serve breakfast on the weekends.  For $9 I got the four rib teaser (which surprisingly came with 5 ribs) and one side.  The ribs were nice and tender and the mild BBQ sauce was the perfect combo of sweet, smoky, and spicy for me.  The Mac and cheese was good, but not the best I've had.  My husband had the hot link sandwich...came with two hot links and a side.  The French fries were really crispy, just the way I like and we enjoyed their fry sauce.  This will be our BBQ spot up north...we have yet to try their original location...but it's on the list since the menu is bigger there!",Tdv7HZa4Hyjm-X0MtNmeag,5,5,5,ZzvS5fw9_7VXZgZt0TqJ6A
5505856,2018-04-15,2,3qIFv-MbDoj-gDigpo_FgA,"If you want to be treated like shit this is the place to go.  Patricia mentioned a young man.  I had misfortune of ordering from a woman,  so it's not just one rogue employee. I'm pretty tolerant of bad service but I can't recall ever having such hostile service. 
How's the food?  I don't know. Maybe I was just so angry that when the food eventually came I couldn't enjoy it.  And I did not enjoy it and neither did my friend. 

The fries had nice seasoning but I didn't like the them.  The chicken nuggets were like McDonald's but fried longer.  The brisket was passable but had a lot of extra fat I had to pull off.  It wasn't as tender as I would expect.  The BBQ sauce was good.  We didn't like the coleslaw either.  It seemed a little mushy for my taste.  The soda was room temperature.

While I'm not expecting food poisoning I'm going to give my first one star review for a restaurant.",d7g8abap1rSvE5dwa7r0oQ,3,0,1,OxqL7N0n9iykvIGXcZCbdQ
5600047,2016-04-07,1,3qIFv-MbDoj-gDigpo_FgA,"The closest restaurant to my house is this place!  It's in the shotgun center at the gun club.  Basically a cafeteria.

It has a limited menu, sandwiches only.  No collards... Boooooo.  I had the brisket sandwich.  It was tender, flavor just ok, but the flavorful sauce fixed right up.  

Not worth the drive because of the limited menu, but better than waiting online for 2 hours at their other place.

Great views up here.",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,1,1,3,sfsye5g5xpPmu7tk5nAMYQ

I can't remember what I got, but it's one of the best. Every time I took a bite after the first one, I drooled and gleeked because I was in heaven. 

""Gleeked""  the act of taste buds mortaring the food about to enter your cake-hole. 

Anyway, I wish they had a spicy honey mustard or something to go with the BBQ. You can even bring your kill to their butcher shop! How convenient! I wonder if the butcher requests a cut of your kill. If so, by all means! Great place, John!",j7SH8LM1L8eExP2AO71UbA,0,0,5,EVNRFbWDQjF4zEasUxgy-A

Being able to eat smoked bbq outside on picnic tables with my family like we did when I was growing up was an awesome experience I won't forget.
