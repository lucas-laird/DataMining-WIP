501008,2016-11-21,0,46ud6EO8tIlgnLnhLN2Tvg,My husband and I used to go to the old location frequently. The best catfish that I have ever had. Seriously. My husband always gets the chicken wings and he loves them. All of the sides are good and I love the peach cobbler! Will keep being a loyal customer at this new location too!,6FWLtLbbjIRA-jzYukQMiA,0,0,5,Di-0fLwSX6uxbVnKCWgaVg

1701392,2016-11-24,9,46ud6EO8tIlgnLnhLN2Tvg,"Go for the grilled shrimp poboy- it's great! Crusty bread, cajun-seasoned shrimp, special sauce, and fresh veggies, hard to go wrong. Other items I've had here are hit or miss though.

The fried items aren't great, maybe it's their oil? Their catfish is supposed to be a highlight but I still prefer to drive the extra 10 minutes to Mario's. As for sides, the red beans and rice were pretty gummy, the mac was decent, and the fried okra was so salty it was inedible.

Prices are pretty good. New location is clean, located right by Four Kegs. Service was pretty friendly for grabbing takeout. I'll be back, but I'm sticking to the poboys.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,19,13,3,jMYkD0kWKDneqR7HaTJJeg
2031820,2016-09-04,1,46ud6EO8tIlgnLnhLN2Tvg,I Love Southern Style Eatry the food is awesome I think awesome is really not a accurate word to describe  The food is damn delicious and the desserts let me just say you will be there everyday trying to get more.

The new location will be at Charleston & Torrey pines inside internet cafe area. Should be ready by Tuesday. Spoke to the manager. They did say you can still order delivery. Contact the manager, phone # still works & always super nice.",1ZHlZItoQdpzW0L6T5F_8g,3,1,5,GubyDI7-yB8bo0CL4NJKaA

4043194,2016-10-01,1,46ud6EO8tIlgnLnhLN2Tvg,"The is my 1st time here since they moved to the new location. Service was good. Facility was clean. It's smaller than the other location, but that's ok too. We ordered fried shrimp, fried cat filets, greens, Mac, & yams. Everything was good, but I don't like how you can't order just meat only. Like just shrimp or fish w/out sides. My kids didn't want anything but shrimp & I still had to buy dinners. I didn't like that. The prices seem a little higher too! Everything was still delicious, I'll give them that & I hope they do well here. BLESSINGS!!!!!",KKLWlqtaspsWHYGQLfUl1w,5,4,4,p3Ol5PksyWk9DWz-rtULRA

If you're in the neighborhood, I'd recommend checking it out.",woOMSSAlMO7mszimFKIHBw,0,1,5,ELTJ8T75q5gJYgA5zKAjug
