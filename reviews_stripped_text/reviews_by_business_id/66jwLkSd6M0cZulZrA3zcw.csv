    Today the service was good. Food was fair. Dishes were very dirty. Hair was found in the food. Sadly I'm the one who suggested giving it another try. 
   The mgr Tommy came out and apologized. He was very pleasant. Waitress (Trista?) Was very good.  They are the only reason for the second star.
  I can't blame the waitress for dirty dishes. I didn't look at the reviews until leaving. If there are this many complaints about dirty dishes, you'd think they'd change something.  I never ask for or expect a comped meal. But I do expect to get what I pay for. We were disappointed for the last time.",qGRyN_oAZ-v42be-YMJXcg,1,0,2,jefVEk9FDm_Q_ZLrjRn-0A

When I voiced my concerns to the waiter he could care less about my dissatisfaction. He just said     ""well is there anything else I can get you?""

I expressed my concern to the waiter (don't know his name, he didn't introduce himself) and nothing was done, he just said ""I'll tell somebody."" And we received our normal military discount, no special treatment. My guess is that the waiter is new, due to his lack of problem-solving skills and dumbfounded look. I would also bet a paycheck that the waiter is new. I'm sure he dropped all the meat at once and didn't ensure that the meals were cooked because he didn't want us to wait for our food. Perfectly fine, except that one of us didn't eat because of it.

My husband ordered a beer but left his id at work.  She said very rudely that they have to card him saying ""you don't look like you can be my dad"" (my husband is 43 and she was like 30 so no, he may not look old enough to be your dad but we do have a 19 year old daughter so technically yes, he is a dad..) so we asked to speak to a manager.

I asked if they no long tossed their salads..... 20 min after the salad came out both dishes arrived freezing cold. The manager brought out the food, disregarding the quality. I asked the bartender if they could cook the food more and warm everything up. The second time the food came out the mash pots had a 1in root in it. I pulled it out of my mouth almost throwing up. I was so grossed out. I told the manager that there was some type of bone or plastic in the pots. 
She picked up the thing I just pulled out of my mouth with her fingers. I gave her a weird look. ""ma'am i just pulled that out of my mouth"". She said oh my hands are clean....  Then she started to justify that it was a root and they forgot to clean the potatoes, regardless that should have never been there.
She took 50% off the meal. She was not appologetic at all. I don't understand how you can mess up literally everything. Plus Im a bit concerned with the hygiene of the establishment.

The queso chicken tastes great.  Rice, corn, black beans, avocado, chicken all bathed in that queso.  Quite a tasty entree.  If you like these flavors mixed with a lime glaze you will like this dish.

We went to dinner tonight to celebrate our family member Michael's birthday. We wanted it to be fun an special so the first thing we did before he got there was tell our server that we were celebrating a birthday and if they could please bring out the little sundae and sing for him at the end. Now, not only could you immediately tell that all but maybe 2 of the employees (including the hostess and our server) were completely uninterested and just wanted to go home but we werent even done eating yet when the server comes back and asks MICHAEL if he even wanted them to come out and sing for him or if he just wanted to skip the whole thing to which Michael, being an older man, then said, "" Well no, that's ok then, I've heard it before, its wonderful"". The server then proceeded to ignore us completely when we told him that we WOULD like them to sing. That was the whole point of us telling him (the server) in the first place. I personally was really irritated by this and so were the other two people that came to show love and appreciation to Michael, who has done so much for us.
First off, WE were paying the bill, WE requested the surprise. The fact that we are young does NOT mean that we can be easily dismissed because someone is choosing to be careless and lazy. The server never should have come to ruin it by ASKING if the birthday man even wanted it after we had already told him That's what we wanted.

We could easily hear the conversation she was having with the table in the back and I'm sure they could hear ours with the waitress.

She went on this homophobic rant about gay people and how she's never let her daughter be gay and how she thinks it's ridiculous that we have so many gay people in the media. I have a boyfriend but I am not straight. I was so disgusted that a waitress would go on such a bigoted rant in front of customers.

No, wait, that might actually taste better than what it was. I am not exaggerating when I say that the nasty rubbery taste of that spinach stayed in my mouth for 2 days. My husband's steak was on a bed of the same disgusting spinach. I don't know if they keep buckets of that crap in the back, but seems like it oozes out of every dish they bring out. The salmon was dry a dry plank of fish that could not possibly been prepared only once.

I found myself here yesterday because I was outvoted by the group I was with.  Oh well, it happens.  We went for lunch and it was an ok experience.  I had the Bourbon Black and Bleu Burger.  It was surprising yummy.  It had a lot of kick and I had a small party in my mouth.  It was better than I was expected, which was a nice surprise.  The other people in the party both got the 3 cheese penne and chicken dish.  I didn't sample it, but they both enjoyed it.  My picky eater, my 18 month old did surprise me by eating half of her grilled cheese.  She never eats anything, so that made me happy.  I tried a bite and it was quite good with the bread being a sweet, eggy bread, like brioche.  

The service was really good and we always had what we wanted without having to ask for it, which made for a pleasant meal.

We ordered our food after waiting another 5 minutes for our waters. The waitress seemed aloof, and maybe it was because she was also a bartender, but I dont care, be cordial you douche bag!

While we were ordering our drinks, 2 dudebros came in and sat at the bar. The blonde bartender immediately got on their jock and started flirting with them, waiting hand and foot.

Against my better judgement, we stayed. On three different occasions our food was brought out either cold or FROZEN!!

4764555,2016-01-15,3,66jwLkSd6M0cZulZrA3zcw,"Stopped in today for happy hour. I wanted some drinks and food. I was expecting the same service and menu I get back home in Nashville. I was slightly disappointed when I realized things were not the same, but I ate here anyways.

First thing first, although we were seated promptly, it took forever for the waitress to come by. Thankfully, when we were seated, we were given a menu, so when the waitress did decide to drop by, we already had our meals picked out.

I always order some form of chicken pasta. Here they have a Three-Cheese Chicken Penne dish that usually pretty awesome. I went with that, luckily, my friend wanted the same thing so we decided to just get the 2 for $20, that way we could share appetizer too. Also, because it was Happy Hour, we ordered Mozzarella sticks along with our meals.

The Sticks came out 1st. They looked great. I really appreciate that the cup for the marinara sauce has gotten larger. As opposed to how the cup used to be, they actually gave us almost enough sauce to get us through all of the Mozzarella Sticks. Progress!

Once we were done snapping pictures and dug in, we noticed that not everything is as good as it looks. The sticks were warm but the cheese wasn't melted. They were very hard to eat. They tasted like a fried box covered in marinara sauce. They gave us like nine, I was hoping at least one would be worth the money. Nope, all terrible. The sauce was the best thing about them. Sad!

A couple minutes later, the Buffalo flavored Boneless wings came out. I must say, I'm a sucker for their wings. I'm not a big wing person, UNLESS, they're boneless and are being served at Applebee's. I love them because they're always cooked to perfection and seasoned with just enough spices to keep me coming back.

I hate anticipating food that's usually incredible, but when I hype my friend or myself up to go get it, it's disappointing. With that being said, those damn wings were horrible. If it wasn't for the ranch dressing, I would have flipped. It's sad that I have to mask dishes with sauces. The wings were overcooked so they were hard to chew. We only got a hand full of them but they looked like the cook chopped a wing up and made 3 out of it. Don't get me wrong, we did have a couple large wings but most of them were really small.

Just after the wings were dropped off, the entrees came out. Same as the other dishes, the meals look cool, a little dry, but never the less, decent. Once I got the waitress attention because she always on the move, I asked for more Alfredo Sauce. It took her a few minutes to stop back by to say that it will be right out, but by that time, I had already tasted the Pasta. It was cold and disgusting. Well, the noodles were cold, the chicken was warm and the plate was hot. All messed up! Not to mention the serving wasn't enough to fill up a 6 year older.  

I told the waitress that the entrees were terrible and she said that she was sorry and offered to bring something else out. We declined because I don't like sending food back. I told her that we will just pay for the apps and she took the plates and walked off.

She came back out after 3 or 4 minutes and bought the check. She had discounted the entrees and the Mozzarella Sticks were half off, being that they were on the happy hour menu, but the Wings (also on he Half Off Menu) were listed at full price. I asked the waitress, once again, after I got her attention, if she had made a mistake. She told me that because we didn't purchase a beverage, we couldn't get the Happy Hour prices. I was confused because she had discounted the Sticks already. She then told us that she had done us a favor. She said that the Sticks were not suppose to be discounted either.

Subsequently, I asked for the manager. I wasn't opposed to purchasing a drink but I didn't like the way she just sprung things on us, and then talked to us as if we couldn't afford our meal. I'm not sure if that was her intentions but my friend and I both felt slight offended.

She went on and on about how she was doing us a favor, although we had already asked for the manager. She then took the receipt and said that she will see what she can do. After about 5 minutes, she came back out with the receipt. Said that the manager had said that he would add the discount this one time, but next time, we would only get the discount if we purchase beverages. I said that it won't be a next time and then she repeated her statement. I gave the woman a $20 to get her away from the table. She brought the change back and we left. I never did see the manager.

I know that it's not her fault that the food was horrible or that the rules are setup how they are, but she can control her attitude. She was just too snappy for my liking. Plus she was a terrible waitress, she couldn't even keep our water glasses full.

Then we wait another 10 minutes after getting our drinks for her to come back and take our order. In the middle of us talking and giving her our order, she starts walking to the table behind her and rushes our ordering process. But then she spends a 5-8 minutes with this table talking about what's in everything they want to order. Of course it was another 10 minute wait for the food and our server wasn't the one who served it. Our food was very average. We could've made the food at home for a cheaper price.

5054190,2014-05-11,4,66jwLkSd6M0cZulZrA3zcw,"AMBIANCE: 3 - Regular. I mean, it's Applebee's! It actually feels a bit cramped on the upper levels. 

SERVICE: 4 - Excellent. Our server was very helpful and funny. She was attentive and polite. It was exactly how a server should be! I know it was slow, but she checked on us way too much! 

FOOD: 3 - It's true, there are big deals here and real money to be saved! They even revamped their entire menu, and I got the steak on the 2 for 25 deal (including appetizer), but I have to be honest, it wasn't good. The food at this Applebee's has just deteriorated over the years and become painfully average. Though my mom did order the strawberry avocado salad, which was probably the best thing on the menu! 

The only reason I like coming to this Applebee's location is because of their happy hour (big drinks at $5-6, I think) and they've always had a great bartender that works there! My favorite Long Island comes out of this Applebee's! 

So my final advice, when you're at Applebee's, (I think you know it!) ""a happy hour is a happy day!""",OoyQYSeYNyRVOmdO3tsxYA,4,5,3,MS_SSCbMDDtVQJtpjj3nSw

About 10 minutes later she comes up, grabs the drinks and sets them back down. Then she proceeds to yell at the bartender. Finally our drinks meet our table and we put our order in.

Our food came about 25 minutes later delivered by another server. Who knows where our server was. We ate our food which is bland and ok, nothing remarkable. After another 20 minutes a different server brings our bill. She mentions something about our server being on a break but she can't find her.

5530637,2016-08-25,5,66jwLkSd6M0cZulZrA3zcw,"I was out voted, and off to Applebee's for dinner we went.  When we arrived, we were seated within minutes.  That rates 1 star.  Our waitress (Sara) didn't get over to the table for at least 10 minutes, and was incredibly slow to even bring 4 drinks (2 of which she didn't even know which was which).  At least we finally got them since everyone at the table was very thirsty.  

For dinner, I ordered the Butcher cuts and potatoes.  It looked like a large and delicious meal.  What I was served, was smaller than an order of loaded nacho chips, and looked nothing like the picture (see the pictures below).  There were only 2 pieces of grilled tomato and 4 or 5 pieces of broken onion rings scattered over the meal rather than a stack piled high on the meal like in the picture.  The pieces of butchers cut meat were all tough pieces of meat.  I've seen better meals from Banquet TV Dinners.  

When the bill came and when I looked it over, I saw they were charging full price for the 2 beers even though it was clearly happy hour and they have the advertisements propped up at every table.  When we asked the waitress about it, she said it would get fixed, and that the customer has to ask for the happy hour price in order to get it. Really?  The customer has to ask for something the restaurant advertises at every table?  

I did try this restaurant once before on a holiday.  That time, the manager was out front trying to keep the people waiting to be seated from leaving.  I watched him seat a loud complaining couple at a large booth for 6 and kept parties of 4 or more impatiently waiting to be seated.  After waiting and watching the unprofessionalism of the manager, we told him he could scratch our name from the list and that we were going somewhere else for dinner.  He rudely replied that it would be at least an hour wait at any place we went to.  10 minutes later, we were seated at a different restaurant and enjoyed a nice meal.   

I wouldn't recommend this restaurant because of the unprofessionalism of management, the seemingly deceitful excuses by the staff and poor quality of the food.  I like to relax and enjoy the meal when I go out.  I left irritated and unhappy with the whole meal.",gJbjgo4zWyoTfjiCvzsFRw,8,3,1,0IYlgRs6iHfekFjkT_sG_w

Upon walking in on a Tuesday night, I found the restaurant to be fairly slow, which can be expected for early in the week.. There were one or two people up at the bar which was great. Easy peasy seating. Yes!!

Shortly after sitting down, was greeted by the bartender (Megan). During my happy hour visit, she was friendly, helpful, and fun to chat with. Really appreciate genuinely nice employees. Sometimes hard to come by in Vegas. 

I have always been a big fan of reverse happy hours and this one, has some decent deals. Check out my pics for what's actually on happy hour. Remember I'm a menu junkie. 

Kept my order very simple and just ordered 2 Large Bud Lights ($4 each) and the Crispy Wonton Tacos ($4). The beer was ice cold and the tacos were crunchy, yummy, and left me wondering if I should order more. (I didn't)

A great experience and will be back for more. Thanks Megan, Reyna, and Applebees. You didn't disappoint.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,5,2,5,1zBFDUq3_CzLL4Sbywx-tQ

It would get more stars if not for the butchered meat and the baked potato was not washed and did not taste good. How do you mess up a baked potato? I do not know but this location and the one at Charleston and Decatur have done this. I do not like the chicken fingers and their hamburger is barely edible.

That was the last time we saw her until closing. At 12, the server dropped off the check. In the time that we'd been dining, not once had we been asked how the meal was going, if we needed drink refills, or even if we wanted dessert or boxes. As soon as midnight came around, every employee seemed to forget there were guests and preceded to work on side-work. At one point, there was not one employee on the floor for 5-8 minutes; they were in the kitchen laughing and chatting away. She never came over to collect the payment for the check. I had to physically get up and look for my server in order to pay because it had been 15 minutes at that point. We weren't the only ones looking for service either. When our server finally returned to the floor, she remarked ""oh you're ready"". While processing our check, the couple at the bar informed her that one of the tables might have done a walk out; there was no money on the table nor was there a signed slip for card transactions.
