The sides were alright and the salsa bar was good until I witnessed a 3 year old girl slobbering all over the spoon and vigorously dipping her infested hands in to the sauce/salsa containers. Very unappealing to say the least. I told the child's mother and the store manager about the blatant condiment violation and they both looked at me with the intent to trick me that they did not speak English. They succeeded because the little girl was still using the salsa bar as her private playground. No salsa for me!!!,HRyFtrmf19GTKEM_kOa2pg,1,0,2,okhwHoi1ecdRUGHXcQkqwA

1153380,2016-09-25,0,06MlxbtB4ZYeg_ri02RIAQ,"Firstly my boyfriend and I wanted fast food and decided to go to this restaurant because we wanted to eat grilled chicken.
The cashier was not friendly at all and she had an unpleasant look the whole time. I wanted chicken wings but the cashier said they didn't have any and it would take 15 minutes to make more.
The place has bright colors minimal design and it looks dirty and the trash cans were overflowing with garbage. It took us a minute to find a clean table. Most of the tables had old food on it. 
The first thing that you will notice, which made us disappointed was trash near the counter that the employees kept walking past.
The service was absolutely disappointing. In addition they could hardly notice us when we wanted something. I asked the manager to clean the restaurant lobby where customers were eating and she said, ""okay, thank you."" I asked the cashier for more salad dressing, it took some time to get her attention.
In conclusion the whole experience was not good, I would never go back to this place again for any reason and I don't recommend this restaurant, not even to my worst enemy.

Also, this location in particular has repeatedly gouged me on little things: chips and guac order is only half-full and chips are stale, ask and double-check for cilantro sauce and still don't receive it without going in and asking a third time, torn corn tortillas, and tortilla soup that is 80% broth and corn.

I'm not sure if the chicken wasn't prepared like normal... or if it was yesterday's. The skin was so tough, when normally that's what makes it so delicious. 

The reason it's getting one star though, is because this store obviously has a sewer problem. Walking up to the store it smelled great. Inside was another story. At first I thought it must just be because they had the bathroom doors open for cleaning. But eating in the dining area it was still an overwhelming smell. It was stronger by the soda machine, where only water and soda is going in the drain. So definitely do not eat in!!!! It really ruined the food.

I got there at lunch time and there was a line halfway into the seating area but it wasnt a long wait to order, maybe 5 min.

I had previously looked at some reviews here and because of THAT, I ordered a small bowl of Chicken Tortilla soup ($2.99) and the before mentioned fish taco (Reg $1.99...wt coupon .99). The Total wt tax came to $4.30.

This is a few steps up from Taco Bell and the plates I saw being served looked really good & healthy. My taco was very small and not a good value at the reduced fare of .99. It was good but the Fish Taco's for .99 at Long John Silvers are way better & bigger. Now when it comes to soup, I am spoiled rotten, as I worked at a condo and the Chef there was a Pro and in fact was once Tommy Lasorda's personal Chef, and the soup this guy made was the MOST AWESOME EVER!!

The Tortilla soup was NOT as good as reviewers made it out to be. First off the portion didnt match the price of $3. I have had Campbell's Chunky Mexican Chk Soup ($1.50) that is a bigger portion for less and packs more overall flavor. It was ""OK"" at best and did have some nice chunks of chicken but not worth $3.

I'm not writing this place off by any means and will probably go back using it again as a destination on a walk one day and try the Chicken Tortilla Salad. But for value's sake, I could have paid another dollar & gone to lunch at Buffet @ Asia (see previous review here) & had more of a choice of dishes & all you can eat.

I went in to order 2 dinner combos for a hungry crowd at home.  It was after work & they were slammed.  After ordering, I waited for about 5 minutes (not bad).  Well, whomever packed up my food just called my number & pointed to the bags on the counter.  I went home & started unpacking & realized, they didn't give me the 2nd dinner's chicken (about 12 pieces).  I called the restaurant & spoke with Latrell, explained the mess.  He immediately asked if I could go back there & pick up the rest of my order, well of course I could, I still had hungry people at home.  On my way to the restaurant, I received a call from home that we were almost out of rice.  I immediately called Latrell (on my hands free), and explained that I needed more rice too.  When I got there, he had  packed up the chicken I was missing, an additional container of  12 pieces of chicken & 2 containers of the rice, all compensated for having to go back down.  Before I got my food, he showed me what was in each container.  Great  management move!",_4YSZRyqkHHAqe6dslQUng,1,0,5,jk81A-o05U9fn6b_QpJziQ

thing he had to say was ""uh huh"" saying usually people ask for utensils and napkins. If someone calls your store letting you know about service they have received don't try to argue and make up an excuse just own up to it!!!",XzcfH6aS6W80XlSQSTKpIg,0,0,1,ys_bu0gOJayLKyq9C9KOEQ

 I love the new Tostado bowls. I get them without lettuce, cause, well, lettuce. 
 The people are friendly, and other than forgetting the avocado once, get the drive thru order right.
 Parking plentiful now that Borders is gone.  (Sob)
 They have a salsa bar, and I like them all. The bar can get a little messy, and the outside is never spotless.

My personal favorites are the Pollo Bowl (chicken, beans, rice, pico de gallo, onions and cilantro all done up nicely in a bowl) and the Twice Grilled Burrito.  Muy Bueno!

On a recent visit, my El Tradicional burrito had a pretty nice sized bone in the middle of it. Yes, I found yet another bone in my chicken from two different chains now.

This time, instead of being a big chunk of bone, it was a nice sized rib by the looks of it.

I tried calling the store to let the manager know their staff should be a little more careful, no answer. I know how busy they get during the day, so I figured I would call a different time. No answer. A different day, before the daily lunch rush. No answer. Fill out a form on the corporate website, receive only an autoresponder email. Next visit in, I brought the bone and receipt, manager was too busy to step away.

Oh well, I'll keep eating there, the chicken is pretty good. Will have to see if I have already filled my quota of chicken bone incidents for 2012.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,1,3,usfkaNNLNROt8Oko5YHcrw

I live super close to this location however now find myself traveling further away from home to ensure a good experience. 

The staff has a bad attitude and they often get my order wrong or leave something out that I paid for.

When there is an issue that is their error and not my fault they never apologize or make it right. The staff almost seems resentful when they make a mistake on my order.

The Manager does not speak good english so it is hard to communicate with her regarding issues. 

The last time I was there around 7pm, keep in mind they close at 11pm. The cashier Ivan was arguing with me because they were out of chicken breast (white meat preference). He said I could wait 30 minutes and he informed me that they have guidelines to follow that Corporate makes on cutting back on chicken that is made???? I am not sure how that is my problem as a customer but ok?

I will never understand going into a chicken restaurant and them being out of chicken?
