24629,2017-09-07,0,EiEaPRsi2AW3j3xraIssrA,Ok where do I start. Every time I go in here they ALWAYS get my order wrong. And you'd think by now I'd understand. But I have hope and I tell myself you know what this time I know they won't disappoint me. But here I am getting disappointed. When I order my $10 Mexican  Chicken Cesar salad I ask for and extra side dressing and croutons. Sometimes they don't have any croutons which to me doesn't make sense. Like how are you not going to have croutons for a chicken Cesar salad. Anyways then I ask for an extra Cesar dressing there's times where they charge me for it and never put it in the bag. Then there's times where they they give me ANOTHER DRESSING like ranch (I would eat it with ranch. But I dislike ranch). Then they always take forever for the simplest things. And I would understand if the place was annoyingly busy ok I get it. But sometimes there's no one in there. I love this place but for a small $10 Mexican chicken Cesar salad you expect to have everything in the bag before you leave.,ImCVghBpeiiUu924uyk_Eg,0,0,1,jlu6RCHS8LBoMlGNT0WTsQ

Today, I paid $10 for parking only to walk out with a weak excuse for a salad. Usually I struggle to finish, but just tossing the contents to distribute the dressing immediately revealed the bottom of the container. There wasn't nearly enough lettuce to call it a salad. I asked for a sandwich as a salad and they took the same exact portion for a sandwich and laid it in the box. No exaggeration, I could count the leaves.

The Bronze Cafe at The Center has always been a quality establishment where we could get good healthy food at a moderate price. This service convinced us to try their newest cafe location. They did not disappoint. Their new dinner menu was absolutely fabulous. The service was excellent as always. The atmosphere is a work in progress, but it still offers a downtown Las Vegas feel which is a pleasant departure from the hustle of the Las Vegas Strip. I personally recommend the Peruvian Chicken Dinner, smashed sweet potato and the monkey bread for dessert. You will not be able to finish (the portions are quite large). I made 2 meals out of this dinner. My wife had the Salmon which was very tender and didn't have that strong fish taste. Overall a very pleasant and satisfying experience.

I am a frequent bronze customer (2-3 times a week) you can check square since I always get discounts after the 10th time.  

I am beyond frustrated with this location and the only reason I HAVE to go to this location is when the center is closed. 

Employees here are so careless and look like they hate working there. 

I always get 1 thing... the same thing, a biz salad and this is the 4th time something is wrong, so I am fed up.

1. The portions compared to the center are much smaller. 

2. The chicken on my salad looked like confetti. When I went back, the excuse was the machine was broken.... why do you need a machine to shrade chicken. 

3. I waited for 25 min in line because 4 employees where chatting away. 

4.  My salad is wrong...  I paid and waited 5 min for my food to be handed. It was ready... it was on front of me but the guy who charged me left. 1 employee making coffee and 3 chatting away. I had to flag an employee down for my food. He apologized.. but really?! To top it off the chicken is super salty! This hadn't happened to me before. 

Is there a manager here???

The variety salads are my favorite there is nothing to compare the flavors or quality of these pitas and salads really in the whole city.

Really sad The Center location closed. Unfortunately I'm just not a fan of The Market for several different reasons. I just don't like The Market. (I have free parking Downtown on both electric vehicles so that is not the problem.) 

The cashiers here seem miserable, maybe she was having a bad day but the person checking me out for a premade Thai Noodle salad looked like it hurt for her to speak. Zero thank you, rang me out and turned around and walked away. Oh well. 

The last time I hopped in for a coffee a gal didn't really know how to work the machine. Too many coffee houses around, not sure why they even offer coffee.

I've picked up breakfast burritos here before (that tofu scramble!) that took excessively long to make when I was the only customer present, but they're worth a wait. I also dined in once or twice after a run downtown, thankful for a spot to grab something quick and healthy.

Most recently, I ordered on my way to a night class using the Eat24 app. Order was not ready and was incomplete when I arrived, even though I was late. Again, I was the only customer. The soup was bitter and unpalatable while the salad dressing was so thick it had the consistency of hummus and couldn't be distributed appropriately. Though the staff were apologetic and I know the food has been better, this seems to be the norm more often than not, lately.

Still a fan, albeit with scaled-back expectations. Check the pics for the evening dinner and weekend brunch menus, which eventually I'm sure I'll try. The vegan baked goods selection is solid even into the afternoon.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,12,3,YW0g9MgxM3amzEoJYYX3CQ

I called and spoke with someone on the phone who told me 50% of the menu is vegan so the choice was finalized! 

As we walked up, the sign says 'The Market' and I didn't see any signage for 'Bronze Cafe' so I wasn't sure if we were in the right place. Luckily, a staff member was outside and was able to greet us. As we stood outside with a sort of lost look on our faces, he said 'if you're looking for a good place to eat, come on in!' And we did! 

Lots of great menu options. I am a big protein eater so I wasn't looking for anything vegan. I went with the Daniel Special and added double protein. It was fresh, and delicious. 

I'd go back any day! In fact, I likely will sooner than later in order to try their pay by weight salad bar which also looked good.

I invited two of my friends both whom are not vegan & I'm mostly Vegan but sometimes eat fish. We were greeted with a warm welcome & an explanation of the food items available & a slight history of Bronze Cafe by Chef David Mozes. We were served their delicious freshly squeezed orange juice along with coffee & water. All 3 were wonderful. A perfect way to start a meal. We were given four choices to sample from based on David's recommendation. We had the Vegan Fried Chicken, Salmon & Shrimp, Steak, & Chicken. The steak could've been cooked a bit more as it was pink & tender & slightly raw. The chicken was tasty but nothing super spectacular. I really enjoyed the Vegan Fried Chicken. It had a curry flavor to it with a bit of a kick from the spice added. I thought it was cooked properly & held great flavor & texture to it. The salmon was tender, cooked just right, with a nice glaze. I would definitely recommend trying it. The sides they served with the entree including sweet potato mash, cous cous, kale, spinach, rice, etc. were all great compliments to the meat. 
We ended our meal with dessert offerings such as blueberry pudding made with rice milk & chia seeds and an Almond Marscapone cheesecake. Both vegan & made in house. Both delicious. The service was good, the price was what you would pay for healthy made in house fresh food ingredients and affordable. 

The Brunch we decided to do on a Monday morning. We were greeted & served with freshly squeezed orange juice & coffee. Both amazing as I had remembered them from the dinner. We were told the chef would be bringing out four different dishes, his choice. We were delighted to try out the vegan options as I rarely see anything other than vegan pancakes, potatoes, waffles, fruit, and muffins, so I was curious to see what they had whipped up. We tried beignets with a vegan fried chicken, chilaquiles with vegan cheese & tofu, tofu scramble instead of eggs, and a hot soup looking dish with a mixture of hot spices surrounding red & green bell peppers & onions. We really wanted to try the griddlecakes with vegan apple sausage but I will grab that next time I visit. The options we were presented with were great. My feedback would be most people don't usually eat tons of spices & hot sauce early in the morning. As you're just getting your day started to overload your stomach with spicy tomato based sauces & peppers isn't easy on the digestive system so I would normally include more carbohydrate based foods to balance it out. Less spices. Three of the four dishes were very similar in style & texture so as we were sampling them we felt like we were eating the same dish just a different plate. I really loved the chilaquiles especially for the vegan cheese. it's filling, appetizing, and easy to eat. 
I would definitely come here again. It's a nice little cafe to enjoy a cup of coffee and a meal for anytime of day. The service is friendly, welcoming, and excited to have you as their guests, and being mostly Vegan I am happy to have this place as an option. I appreciate being invited for the Chef's tasting as one of their loyal customers to the Maryland Parkway location it's always nice to try new menu options & additional locations.

After hearing some coworkers rave about ""The Market"" and the abundance of unique offerings (ie. Vegan options, nitrate free bacon, butterscotch beer to name a few) in this day and age where people crave burgers and gut busting fried options, I decided to visit for lunch.  Since that day, I've been eating here 2x - 3x a week.  Inside of ""The Market"" is the Bronze Cafe that at first glance looks like a coffee/smoothie bar but have no fear as their food offerings are on point.  Due to the fact that I'm an avid carnivore, I asked the cashier what the best Non-Vegan options were.  She suggested I try the ""Green Goddess Chicken Salad Sandwhich (housemade chicken salad with tomato, greens, onion, basil aioli and lemon vinaigrette).  I went that route and hardly ever deviate from that most delicious choice.  Since my wife continues to ask me if I've had a salad recently, I have been ordering this ""as a salad"" (for no extra charge) and all the flavors are still present.  I have ordered the ""Complicated Order"" once (Bacon Jam, Bacon strips, avocado, turkey, who cares....BACON JAM!!!!) and i'm still dreaming of the bacon jam.  It was very good.  Overall, a great place to come check out to pick up an item of two at the grocery section of ""The Market"" and a phenomenal place to dine during lunch.",NppW9SFDMKioUAx_87QQhw,0,0,5,6V6Ha52YTcBszTNVRcGfYg

Much different experience. Four women and a man behind the counter at the cafe. We were greeted. That's all I'll say. It took a couple minutes to figure out what we wanted - an acai bowl and tree of life, two coffees.  Everyone in the dining room was eating so there were no more orders that we could see. 

15 minutes later, the acai bowl is called. Ten minutes later, my husband gets up to see about his tree of life.  It took 3 people to figure out it was not made. No one knew why.   My husband is much kinder than I so he didn't say anything. 

Both orders were delicious, however, the owners need to work on the people behind the counter.  They couldn't have cared less about the order being forgotten. No apology, no thanks for waiting.

Food: Outstanding!
Their food, although simple in theory, is both visually pleasing and delicious. I ordered a sandwich (don't recall which one) but it came with a very fresh salad, and the ingredients in the sandwich itself were warm and the bread had a firm and crunchy outside and a soft, fluffy inside.

3283728,2017-01-16,3,EiEaPRsi2AW3j3xraIssrA,"So my friend Elizabeth from yelp were literally talking about the market the other day. We both have the same feelings about the market. So she said give them another shot and go to the 60 Min Chef's Tasting - Bronze Cafe Dinner Menu. So I thought hey why not.

She sent me the link so I registered online for the chef tasting. I made an 8:00 reservation with my partner. We were seriously looking forward to this ALL DAY LONG. We got all dressed up for another night out. 

I went in and the staff had no clue what the chefs tasting was. He said oh I don't know let me ask the chef. He came back out and said that the chef had NOTHING prepared (even though we clearly made reservations for it). It was not the best feeling to go out of your way to give a place a second chance and this happens. 

The server or whoever was waiting on us said ""the chef said you can pick something off this menu to eat"". Bear in mind I'm sure it wasn't even the new menu. We had 4 options to choose from because one option they didn't even have, of course it was the vegan fried chicken that I had wanted. He said we also had to pick different meals. So really I was limited to three meals to choose from. 

My partner ordered the falafel appetizer little did the server tell us that the appetizer was pretty much the same thing as the entree. So I had falafel for app and entree. 

After that we were just ready to go at this point but the server said dessert so instead of leaving we tried it. The Vegan blueberry cheesecake was quite good. Tasted out of a box but if it was cooked in house then it was even better.

All and all I'm not upset by the servers who took care of us, I'm just very upset I gave this place many chances and I seem to always be let down. Especially when you promote this tasting and have others excited for it then just not do it that time. Why did others get to do the tasting?!",ugpGI6jgFq_gDyaGBn1Cmw,9,2,1,Z3O_RKoSeLsEW2HBN0DV2A

The breakfast burrito is HUGE and is so good. Seriously, do not plan on getting this to share because you'll end up eating it all by yourself.
Hummus: simple, delicious.

It's actually a very cool place to get a meal or pick up random crap that is in your typical hippie or vegan form when shopping for groceries. 

What honestly stood out to me the most here was that every person working, every person eating, or shopping was smiling. This is a true testament to the employee loyalty and happiness when it comes to getting some awesome food. 

My friend talked me into going to their first location down the street at the LGBT Center which we found out was closed permanently... Luckily they told us about their primary location which was down the street on Fremont. Their food is pretty awesome I must admit even if you like meat or vegan...

Massaged kale topped with beets, quinoa, avo, carrots and garbanzo beans, this salad is filling and delicious. Another favorite of mine is the RSTLNE sandwich that has coconut bacon and jam and is unbelievably tasty. A vegan version of a BLT, it beats out for me any BLT, and serves better on my conscious about leaving animals off my plate. Glad they are making it accessible in downtown for all vegan plant based options. We also had their raw Neapolitan cheesecake, and at $4.50, it's the cheapest raw cheesecake I've ever had.

The menu is packed with healthy choices and vegan options. Free wifi makes it a good place for a working lunch. Free 10 minute parking outside makes pickup of takeaway easy too.
Some of my go to items:
Carrot cake smoothie with added turmeric. 
California Turkey sandwich
The lovin cookie brownie
Acai bowl.
The acai bowl is seriously the best I've ever had. Nuts, grains, granola, in a big bowl of acai. Hearty and delicious.

4108183,2017-11-16,4,EiEaPRsi2AW3j3xraIssrA,"I've enjoyed their sandwiches before, but I had one thought on my mind today: free birthday smoothie.

Bronze Cafe is a casual, vegan-friendly (but not exclusively so) eatery known for the sandwiches, salads, baked goods, and of course smoothies. They started off in the vast lobby of The Center on Maryland (my review here: https://www.yelp.com/biz/bronze-cafe-at-the-center-las-vegas-5?hrid=euRQSJ4foEOTD9ZObh5KAg) before expanding to this smaller but still spacious spot inside The Market on Fremont St. The original place is gone now, and I was a bit daunted by the idea of parking in Downtown Las Vegas (note: it sucks even more these days than before if you want to find free parking), but I found a not-too-awful free parking space a few blocks away and walked over.

The reason for my visit: free birthday smoothie, via the FiveStars rewards platform/app. Bronze Cafe is just one of several business around town that now uses FiveStars instead of physical stamp cards and the like, and one benefit for customers is free birthday stuff. I checked out the smoothie menu and was intrigued by the array of seemingly healthy yet appealing combos of ingredients.

The employee at the register gave his thoughts on certain smoothies when I asked, and I eventually decided on ""The Matcha Superfoods Blended"" ($6.50, 24 oz). The matcha was a bit light but it was discernible, and same goes for the banana and avocado. The blend wasn't too sweet or icy, just smooth and thick, the latter perhaps providing an ""oomph"" to the drink. Overall, it's more balanced than most of the sugar bombs which you'll typically find at smoothie chains.

I'm not a big fan of how Downtown Las Vegas works, so despite the 10% Yelp Cash Back or the potential for unlocking rewards, I'm not likely return to this Bronze Cafe on a regular basis for the smoothies, salad bar, or sandwiches, but I'd definitely recommend these smoothies whether or not your birthday is coming up. I certainly hope to return in a year's time!",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,7,6,4,165B0jpJzbZ02U39ZKqYkw

Both items are still very delicious. The ingredients in each pita go really well together. I love their house-made lemon vinaigrette!  :)  

The menu is bigger with a lot more delicious sounding options than before. I did notice that there weren't as many baked goods such as cookies, scones, etc... unless I totally missed it! However I just noticed someone posted a photo of the baked goods menu so I definitely have to check it out next time.

Inside is nice, clean & spacious with lots of seating (inside & outside). Staff was very welcoming and helpful. Food came out quickly and was brought to our table by the nice young lady who made our order.

Me? I stand with foodie food...and this ain't no Cracker Barrel! 

I've been a HUGE fan of the Bronze Cafe ever since they opened their Maryland Pkwy location...but the ambiance over there could be somewhat awkward. I tend to get rowdy when I'm enjoying good food, and there were times I ate there when the place was deserted and almost creepy-quiet, so I really had to rein myself in. Well, now they have this new location downtown...and I can be as loud as I want!

The atmo down here is sort of Ikea-cafe chic; the restaurant is on one side of a mini hipster grocery store. Between the beards in the market and the boozers on Fremont, the people watching here is unparalleled! But as with the other location...the food is what really kicks ass!

A friend and I shared some of the items from their new menu, and everything was off the chain!    Flatiron steak and shrimp with chimichurri sauce, served with warm curry quinoa...and then the vegan fried ""chicken,"" which is actually seitan, on a bed of sweet potato mashed with coconut milk. SO GOOD!!! To drink, we had fresh squeezed orange juice from their in-store press....and vegan pumpkin pie for dessert. YUM!!!

4393112,2018-01-24,1,EiEaPRsi2AW3j3xraIssrA,"I've been coming to Bronze Cafe on and off for years now, it's always been one of my favorite places in Vegas. Most of the time I usually go to eat there, have some coffee, and study/work. They have plenty of table space, good chairs, and a few outlets to use plus they are open late when I want to put in more hours. On occasion, I'll order take out when I'm feeling too lazy to cook at home and want to avoid the unhealthy choices at drive-thru's. There is a little area near the entrance to park your car for take out, making it quick and easy (you don't have to pay to temporarily park there). 

Despite my many, many visits, there are a lot of choices there I have yet to try. I like to stick to my favorites here which are all vegan.. some of those include The Tree of Life Pita, Guac & Mole, RSTLNE, all of their vegan soups, Falafel, The Bizness, the cheesecakes, all of their vegan side dishes, the fruit waters, and the Raw Cacao Superfoods Blended. I am not vegan but try to keep my diet in non-vegan items to a minimum, and coming here has improved keeping that in check. 

Peter and David are just the best kind of managers/chefs around, I always like catching them during my visits and saying hello. They always care about how my experiences are and if I'm enjoying the food. Peter is always full of good stories and can always make me laugh. The staff for the most part are very awesome and helpful.. there have been one or two employees that seemed completely miserable to be there that my friends have also told me about and by the looks of it, couple other reviewers have encountered as well. Though I haven't seen them in my last visits so maybe they are long gone! 

Other little things I love: It's inside of the Market where I can pick up any extra items I might need. TVs usually showing news and/or food network (it's nice to get a break from sports literally everywhere else). Big windows for a nice view of Fremont and the neon lights outside, also ideal for people watching if you're creepy like that.. just please at least order something and pretend like you're normal! And lastly, it's in the middle of a lot of other neat places downtown, perfect for meeting up or ending the night out.",kKfcdp4iq0w-9gHOp3E44A,1,2,5,hUc6DISUda2VNraX47KMTA

On a separate early-morning visit, I tried a huevos dish, the name of which I cannot remember, which was also delicious, as was the accompanying chicken apple sausage.

This location definitely feels like a business, rather than the community feel that The Center offered, and there isn't a parking lot specifically for The Market, but it is a convenient, walkable location if you're attending events downtown. I strolled over from the Historic Fifth Street School, an option that The Center location didn't offer.

Speaking of, it is PAST time for the Cafe to update its website and its menu, neither of which make it clear that the location at The Center has CLOSED. As I type this, the website still shows The Center location as ""Open Now. Closes at 8 p.m."" It was only thanks to other Yelpers that I learned that that's not true.

I tried the Matcha Superfoods Blended, containing housemade unsweetened almond milk, banana, avocado, dates, Matcha green tea powder ($8). This was my favorite. The smoothie was not overly sweet, but packed some great flavor as well as a lovely boost of energy afterwards. 

I also tried the Carrot Cake Blended, which was very much too sweet for my liking (I guess I should've guessed that ahead of time with 'cake' being in its name...). This smoothie is filled with carrots, dates, vegan vanilla protein powder, housemade unsweetened almond milk, ground flax, cinnamon, cloves and nutmeg ($7). Very, very filling.",KOhtdmixLM13z44D6m5Igg,1,2,5,TzL7Ya1s1xWMAUxB82ppHg

Most days, I stop by for a quick coffee and Swedish oatmeal or pastry to go, but I dined in to try the full brunch menu this morning with my meat and potatoes boyfriend. We chose a table near the window (great people watching in dtlv) and enjoyed some Peets coffee, water and fresh squeezed oj. The oj is bomb....so bomb I got a big one to-go on our way out! 

For breakfast we got three plates to share: the shakshuka- eggs baked in a rich tomato/pepper sauce, the eggs benedict- sweet potatoes, caramelized onions, peppers, mushrooms and corn with poached eggs covered in a butternut squash puree that tastes better than any fatty hollandaise you'll ever try, and the fried ""chicken"" and beignets- vegan, but had me at beignets and didn't disappoint! 

The boyfriend was impressed, and left completely stuffed. David and Peter were off, but Kassie, Ana and Omar took good care of us :) 

We live downtown so enjoyed a nice walk home to work off our feast! I highly recommend to anyone who loves food and maybe looking to incorporate more veggies into their diet.",iB70u8O5teQ_pNio0vAjpQ,0,0,5,EbcMMnmyGMNFDazSl_z-Lg

5279799,2018-07-02,2,EiEaPRsi2AW3j3xraIssrA,"Recently experienced by way of catering, a meal that managed to impress both colleagues and sponsors by way of healthy, fresh fare plus a bevy of Desserts, it was finally on Saturday that a visit was paid to Bronze Caf√© at the Market, renovation to the shopping area doing nothing to diminish the quality of food or service in a place that undoubtedly qualifies for ""hidden gem"" status in Downtown Las Vegas.

Now the center of operations for Bronze Caf√© since late-2016, the Restaurant's time at The Center coming to an end some nine months ago, it was just prior to 10am that staff was found along a lengthy counter, a variety of races and sexes represented not only by the employees but diners seated indoors or on the outside patio.

Toqued by Peter Bastien and managed by David Mozes, the Caf√©'s focus on Vegan or Vegetarian options accommodating health-conscious clientele while certainly not skimping on splurge-worthy options for those so inclined, it was with eyes on Weekend Brunch and new selections from the Pastry case that dine-in choices were made to go with several Pastries for take-away, a great cup of Cold Brew Coffee served over Ice sipped slowly while waiting for the Entr√©e. 

Playing low-volume Pop overhead, a Television and Library both also available to pass the time, it was after roughly self-plating a wedge of Vegan Pie from its plastic Clamshell that first bites of the day were taken, a Crust which is expectedly dry given the lack of Lard or Butter still doing an admirable job of holding up to thinly sliced Apples while Carrot ""Cake"" eats more like a Granola Bar than Dessert but still achieves great results by way of dried Fruit and Nuts plus plenty of Spices and natural sweetness.

Having already discussed most of the Pastries in previous writings, a Jalapeno Scone doing a remarkable job of showing the ingredient without scorching the palate, it was also in a second style of Monkey Bread and Cheesecake each made with Almonds that new items were tasted, the later particularly delicious even when compared to May's Double Chocolate version and as creamy as any in town despite being 100% Vegan.

Priced comparably to any of DTLV's best casual spots despite using mostly Organic ingredients, the full array of Salads and Sandwiches available from open to close, it was after perhaps ten minutes of careful preparation and plating that Bronze Caf√©'s Vegan Fried Chicken and Beignets was served, the fact that Wheat Gluten Protein is likely not everyone's textural ""Cup of Tea"" rendered moot by a crisp and oilless exterior plus flavor not far from real Chicken while the Beignets are a bit flatter than some, but still nicely textured and far less greasy than the versions served beneath a mountain of Powdered Sugar at World-famous Caf√© du Monde.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,5,5,7jtYmRex40y8GnTFRaPYQg
5280985,2018-04-08,1,EiEaPRsi2AW3j3xraIssrA,"The Bronze Cafe has my absolute favorite vegan sandwich. Wait! Forget vegan, it's just a phenomenal sandwich - The Tree of Life Sammich. It's a little piece of heaven on a flatbread pita with red peppers, avocado, mixed greens, tomato, housemade pickled onions, housemade vegan cashew ""crema"", Brazil nut crumble, and mango cilantro ginger vinaigrette.

They also have a delicious green smoothie that my picky daughter can't seem to get enough of. 

I believe all their desserts are vegan, which is a major plus! You can't go wrong with the Fruity Pebbles Rice Krispy Treat, but my new fave is the lemon-mint cake. It's the kind of cake that my grandma would approve. 

Now, the service at this location has been a bit spotty. They've mixed up my order, or I've had extended wait times (even though I was the only person there). I'll chalk it up as growing pains. 

Speaking of growth, I'd love to see a chain of Bronze Cafes throughout the Las Vegas Valley!",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,6,3,4,st3Pm5NRUQo6gN7dPwTy9Q

I ordered via telephone - the girl who answered was friendly, informative, she recommended some items to me and repeated my order back to me.

5709394,2017-05-15,0,EiEaPRsi2AW3j3xraIssrA,"Sounds like consistency is a bit of an issue here. The food, what I received anyway, gets a 4/5. I placed an online order for delivery on Sunday night, my first order from this place. The delivery fee is $10. The issues were as follows:

- first a phone call that they are out of banana bread. I asked for the coffee cake instead. The person seemed to be completely confused what that was even though it was on the online menu. Finally I just nixed it.
- I ordered a sandwich that came on ciabatta but wrote ""pita flatbread"" in the special instructions. It was on ciabatta.
- I chose the gluten free hummus version, which says it comes with cucumbers instead of pita. It came with pita, no cucumber.
- I ordered a side of brussel sprouts. No Brussels sprouts came. No ""side"" at all.

Now it seems I need to get in touch to at least get a refund for the brussel sprouts and banana bread I paid for and never received. At a minimum. Or I could just dispute that plus the delivery fee with my credit card.

Either way, it's annoying. All of these things were in my order  confirmation. The only thing right was the pre-baked cookie and the fact that it came in a timely manner. Not worth my effort with this place, done and done.",EW3jDZFPhUEKPxPMhxLN8A,3,0,2,bYd8UaU1uQo3mrQE7P-iNA
