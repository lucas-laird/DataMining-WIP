They were so nice! HUGE smiles, super friendly. The guy that took my order was a sweetheart and the lady who gave me my food was wonderful and smiley too! And hazelnut crepes? I died and went to heaven! Thank you for being there!
So good & so yummy! Their snow cones were also VERY POPULAR at the school and the line for them was HUGE for a long time! Well worth it!",yuIeaeReYwldp1iQRtGuQQ,1,0,5,U5ffzlmOGNvLPbEGEMayjw

They recently held a menu preview with a ticket giveaway for the upcoming Foodie Fest, where they will make their debut.

Additional details:
+ Solid, high quality ingredients: the grilled chicken crepe was full of meat and a creamy munenster cheese!
+ (Surprisingly?) Friendly French service, super polite and happy to explain their menu options. I also like the nice touch of having a table available for those who want to dine on site!
+ Food truck is still wrapped in their TIL promo materials but menu is clear and truck itself is set up so that you can see inside and watch the crepes being made!
+ Crepe itself was hard and crunchy on the edges and overcooked. Taste made up for this and I assume it's something that will be rectified as they get more experience, because flavors indicate that they know what they're doing.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,16,4,Rfc8E68TkknCdlPUsDyuZg

Nick and his wife make some amazing crepes out of their recently flipped shaved ice truck. Confused? During the Fall season their shaved ice truck becomes a crepe making machine, bam, we're back on track.

I stopped by their food truck at the GA Foodie Fest because I was in need of something lighter to get my tastebuds kickstarted, they weren't serving savory crepes so I grabbed a banana, coconut and Nutella crepe. Oh my, the crepe was super light, fluffy and the sweet ingredients didn't over take the crepe's vanilla flavor base. This was no gut bomb, just a delicate sweet treat and great way to start the Foodie Fest. 

Yeah, so, I like dessert first. Deal with it. 

By the way, I believe French Food Therapy is the only truck serving crepes at the GAFF. Do your body good and stop here.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,26,22,4,AgwxmwMMID6k7HnitcHORw

I was at the water street winterfest and decided to swing by this crepe truck to grab a bite. OMG let me tell you. The #2 chicken Crepe was so good that I went back to get a sweet dessert crepe but unfortunately they were already closed. It was so good and really hit the spot! I was looking for something different. I'm so tired of Mexican, Italian, fast food. I wanted something different and amazing. 

I have to find out how to get another crepe. Is there a restaurant? Or how can I track down this truck again and get another chicken crepe? lol.",g3O27xTQYdBXPLs05RAxuA,0,0,5,s9LJxNxybRhRI7hFPEY23A
