63786,2016-04-17,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Today I went to Shawarma House because I haven't been before and I was hungry.   It does seem like good Mediterranean food is hard to find in some parts of the valley and I was hoping this would be a solid adventure. Anyhow,  I purchased two of the beef shawarma wraps to go. I drove home approx. 5 minutes away,  spent another 5 minutes or so putting away groceries before I broke into the food.   As I held the wrap in my hand (still wrapped in foil) I noticed there was no sign of heat at all and that continued from the first to the last bite.  From the pita bread to the veggies,  sauce, and meat,  all cold.   The flavor was great,  the customer service was great,  but the food was cold. Maybe a bad day there or an off chance experience so I'll check it out again some time in the future and leave another review.",2zZQ9zphA_p-p-7Ojjr5_w,0,0,3,jaWFysgdWzliMZMV5067tA

101790,2016-06-04,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Great pricing for their ""Happy Hour"" from 2 to 4 during the week.  I paid $7.99 for the beef lula with Armenian salad, grilled tomato, rice, pita and a can of soda.  Also paid $7.99 for the chicken kabobs with Armenian salad, grilled tomato, rice, pita and a can of soda.The beef lula & chicken kabobs were cooked perfectly and tasted very good.  Armenian salad was good but could have used a little more dressing.  The rice, pita and soda well were rice, pita and soda.  I also had the Mediterranean fries which were cooked prefect and tasted great.  I tried both the garlic sauce & the Tzatziki both tasted really good.  Overall it was a good amount of food and should be enough to fill most people up.

The dining area was kind of small but it was really clean.  All the employees were very friendly and nice plus they answered all my questions since it was my first time there.  The AC wasn't working but hey things happen.  Of course I picked the hottest day of the year to go there. 

The only negative about my experience there was that I had to pay for a side of the garlic sauce.  That is not a big negative as I said above the sauce tasted real good but just wished it came with my order.

I will be back for sure since it is near my work.  Plus the food tasted great and the employees were all so nice.  Even at the regular prices for each plate above @ $10.99 it is still well worth it.",PAvUfCRzSSl97v5M3ddUfw,0,0,5,CBRmLHgDHOsKLB_Tk_zmgw

We need more of these mom and pop type places where food is made from scratch, not reheated frozen processed food like all the chain restaurants.  They have a large area for delivery but we dined in.  Food was pretty good and customer service was great.  
The most expensive item is $20 (lots of food- almost enough for two) but mostly items run under $10.  
My only complaints would be that the steak and chicken were over cooked in my opinion (well done) and we ate off of plastic plates and utensils. 
Friendly faces eager to please their customers and even gave us a complimentary dessert and a special treat for my daughter.  (The baklava was perfect- not too sweet and syrupy like many.)

Aaaaaand the food was great. I really enjoyed it. Very fresh, well seasoned, a nice amount for the price. I got a gyro combo, with a side of the spicy tzatziki and normal tzatziki on the gyro. Should have done spicy on it and another side, the stuff was good! 

Cons? Location, really. I could see people complaining about that, but I found it easily. Sadly people probably won't stumble onto them which is kinda sad. As far as the food, I'd add more zing to the normal tzatziki, maybe some more dill? I wanna say the meat needs more flavor but it doesn't, because it does well with the rest of the ingredients as is in my opinion. Not sure. But I don't have anything terrible to say about the place.

The gyro-meat shawarma fries with tzatziki sauce were salty and delicious.  The bed of fries were sprinkled with Mediterranean-style seasonings, although as mentioned above they were a bit too salty.  Nevertheless, the fries were cooked perfectly and became a great base for this dish.  I chose the gyro meat (over beef or chicken) and it was a great choice...tender, seasoned nicely and fresh of the spit.  Covering all of this was a generous portion of tangy, bitey, garlicky tzatziki sauce.  This was the equivalent of Greek nachos and they went down easy. ;-)

 I was greeted by a man and a kid at the counter so I would assume that this is family owned and told me that they've only been open for 2 months now. I, myself, have tried a lot of Halal food especially in New York. 

Today, I ordered the Lamb Chops combo for to go- rice, 4 lamb chops, half a tomato, yogurt salad and 1 pita bread for $15 + tax + tip, total of $18. I wasn't really impressed as the meat was dry- over cooked on the grill I guess, and it was bland. It didn't come with any white sauce in it and the yogurt salad was just ok. The pita bread didn't come with hummus and you would have to add $2 if you want one, which I think was not a good idea. Pita bread comes with hummus and hummus comes with pita bread! 

Overall, this combo is very expensive for the area that they're catering for. In comparison, a Lamb Chop combo in NYC would only cost you $10, and the same box would give you overflowing rice and salad, 4 lamb chops and falafel! 

They still have a lot of room for improvement. My suggestion is to lower the price OR increase the amount of 1 serving. Also, get a guy who really knows how to cook Mediterranean food.

Excuse me?! For the record, the salad is simply listed as ""shawarma salad"", and says nothing about the dressing, but if you can ask me if I want to pay extra for feta or olives (which arguably should be included in a $10 salad), you can ask about the dressing, too. 

Salad was small with a sparse layer of lettuce and some dry chicken and not much flavor. Maybe it was an off day, but I'll probably think of Gyro Time or Baladie before returning here.

Husband said the beef shawarma was decent, but my chicken shawarma was tasteless and dry. The rice it came with tasted old and stale. It also came with ""pickled vegetables"" which turned out to be mostly pickled cabbage that seemed to come straight out of a can. The hummus was drowned in oil and gritty in texture. The med fries were good! Just French fries with some seasoning on top. I had also ordered a side Armenian salad with no dressing..but turned out to be swimming in dressing.

It may not be the best I've had in Vegas but it is definitely worth the mention. 

The pricing you'd see at any shawarma place is about the same at the place. My biggest complaint is the $3 tiny bowl of rice you get when you order it as a side but no biggie. I'm big on rice so rice quantity is important to me. 

The chicken in my chicken / rice meal was delish. Moist and cooked just right. Of course, my rice was out way before my chicken was but that's where my $3 of extra rice comes in. 4/5

My wife's chicken shawarma wrap was a decent size and was pretty delish too. No complaints coming from her.

The lady that took our order was super nice and friendly. Checked on us and made sure we were doing OK.

Nice joint, facility is nicer than most of the shawarma places we've visited.

The lamb was very good. It was supposed to be medium and was medium well to well, but they are very thin bone in chops so it would be almost impossible to get a perfect medium. It had good flavor and I would eat it again, but I've had better for less and with a better presentation.

The chicken was extremely dry and lacked flavor. It was very dissapointing and was left on the plate to be disposed of.

The steak medallions were supoosed to be medium, but came out well done. They were dry and lacked flavor. The dogs enjoyed them when we got home.

The Dolma lacked flavor and I doubt they were made in house. If they were, they weren't fresh. 

The Kibbeh were fine, but dry.

Tomato. It's a tomato.

The rice was plain and didn't have any of the traditional spices I normally find when I eat Mediterranean food. It was also... very dry.

My plate didn't come with tzatzki or any type of sauce you would normally find.  I'm not sure if after paying $19.95, you are supposed to order them as sides. There were also no pita bread,  which I found odd.

My wife had the falafel wrap, which she didn't care for. The falafel came in sticks and the bottom portion was mushy and wet.

My first order was terrific so I placed another order today and it was horrible. So, now I'll find another Mediterranean restaurant. 
I ordered hummus but it did not arrive. I called the store and nicely let them know that my hummus did not arrive but that I got my pita bread. The person that answered the phone, Angela was very abrasive from the beginning and told me that my receipt did not reflect that I ordered hummus. I told her it must have been an error because I did click the button on the Yelp app. And she was very adamant and forceful about the fact that I did not order hummus and she could send me a copy of the receipt if I didn't believe her. Snarky!
After our call disconnected I called back and asked if I can buy some hummus because that was what I was really craving. I had to keep de-escalating. I explained to her I'm in bed not feeling well. I didn't cook dinner I didn't want to go out of my house that's why I spent 40 plus dollars on food delivery. She was very curt and told me know they have a $10 minimum order and that they will not deliver it. I said you know this isn't about policy Angela this is about customer service it was an error and I'm asking you if I can please buy some hummus and she flat refused to sell me hummus unless I came and picked it up myself.
I was shocked at how rude she was and poorly she dealt with a simple customer request.

2597488,2017-01-14,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"I ordered delivery via Yelp and with them being 8 minutes away, my delivery was free, which was a huge plus!

I ordered the beef shawarma fries, hummus, baklava, a soda, and two orders of pita (partly because I needed to meet my $20 minimum, which was hard because of the low prices, and the other part because I read reviews about people not having enough pita for their hummus) - the food got here very quickly (especially for having ordered on a Saturday afternoon) and everything was still warm.

I will say this - Market Grille Cafe kinda spoiled me a bit with their amazing spanakopita & the best rice I've ever had, so my standards are a little high for Mediterranean. Although this place doesn't have spanakopita (my fave) the Beef Shawarma does not disappoint. I was also overwhelmed by the amount of pita that I ended up getting. It was nice to see they weren't stingy with the pita as some reviews suggested.

The beef was well-seasoned (and I'm Creole so I have a low sensitivity to seasoning lol) the fries were crisp on the outside and soft on the inside; in other words, perfect. I asked for the garlic sauce to be put on the side, which I appreciated them heeding to. The sauce more or less is like garlic ranch dressing with the consistency, but still very good. The hummus was a little bland, but I picked up a tip from another yelper and added the garlic sauce to it and mixed it well - the hummus became 5 stars.

I was very happy to see that the soda was canned, which I prefer (I'm not a big fan of watered-down fountain drinks). The baklava is actually the reason my review is 4 stars and not 5 - it was soggy on the bottom and the pastry was more on the soft side & not crispy how I like it, but overall the flavor was still satisfying.

Also, the young lady who delivered my food was very kind and sweet. She had no problems following my delivery instructions to find my apartment, and her genuine kindness made the whole delivery experience that much better.

I'm one of those people who's always skeptical about trying new places out of fear of disappointment and wasted money, but I'm so glad I took a chance! You guys have a loyal customer out of me! :)",YolvUTj8xsalfnIQRcEkIQ,2,1,4,bPEB7eRfm4bEY9P_Kb_-WQ

2639629,2016-10-07,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"So we ended up here on a spousal commitment to try something new every week. (We yelped Greek food)

Upon parking the signs/pictures in the window explaining the menu were extremely helpful as we have never stepped out for Mediterranean food.

We walked in and were immediately greeted with friendly and helpful staff who helped us along our Mediterranean culinary journey.

After a little contemplation we ordered the number 4, 9 and 11. 
Also ordered baklava and shamali with walnuts.

The rice was simple yet seasoned perfectly with so much flavor I wanted to take it home. The lamb chops which I ordered medium were cooked to proper temp and were delicious. Everything on my plate from the roasted tomato to the pita was an experience that I will compare all my other Mediterranean endeavors with.

My wife and daughter were both extremely pleased with their menu selections as well and a return visit is in order.

We recommend the lamb chops, stuffed grape leaves and hummus, falafel and baba ganoush and crush the roasted tomato and jalapeno into that rice. 

You will not be disapointed!!

This place is clean and friendly with outstanding food.

The price was right and the menu was just big enough to provide ample variety without straying from what they say they're about:  shawarma.  Walk in, go to the counter and order, then pick your seat.  The menu is right on the wall but if you need a little time, you can also grab one of the menus from the counter to review.  I didn't get the name of the lady behind the counter but she was very nice, as were the other employees we saw interact with customers.  Before we knew it our lunches were brought out freshly prepared and hot.

I tried the beef shawarma plate with spicy garlic sauce.  It came with the beef on top of rice, hummus, pickled veggies (cabbage, carrots and celery) and hot pita bread on the side.  I went with a colleague from work who ordered the chicken shawarma plate and we both left satisfied!  There was definitely enough food to put a strong lunchtime desire to rest.

The restaurant is a little small, but not cramped.  It was also very clean.  Located in a storefront, there's plenty of parking, even though there aren't a lot of spaces right in front.  No big deal though.  For the time we sat there, it seemed there were always a few spots open, and there are plenty more around the corner.

If it's time to eat and you're near the intersection of 95 and Craig Road, definitely give the Shawarma House a try!",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,6,2,4,YSzHk8ReZxXRuT6tOjlCPQ

2746706,2016-02-24,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"I just visited the Shawarma House last week.  I was visiting my parents who live in LV.  I found it based upon ""Hot & New"" on Yelp.  The location is in a strip of stores right on Craig Rd.  Very clean and tidy inside with a good amount of seating.  The entire menu is also available to go.

I ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate - includes rice, hummus, pita bread, pickled turnips and a soda.  The beef is served over rice and is drizzled with garlic sauce.  The beef is so very flavorful on its own but with the garlic sauce it takes it to amazing!  The garlic sauce is so good you could put it on a shoe and eat the shoe.  The portion size of the beef and rice was spot on, perhaps generous for smaller appetites.

The hummus is made in house, in fact they were making a fresh batch when I walked in.  The consistency and flavor were very good.  I personally like a bit more garlic in my hummus but I added a bit of the garlic sauce from my plate and kicked it up a notch.

The only part that wasn't my favorite was the pickled turnips.  No big loss as I had more than enough food to satisfy me.

Service was very friendly and prompt.  It is counter service and they bring the food out to your table.  The beautiful woman, an owner perhaps, working the counter was a delight to chat with regarding the restaurant and the food.  She showed great pride in both and was kind enough to treat me to a baklava to bring home to my parents.  BTW - my parents had never had baklava and they absolutely loved it.

I had the chicken shawarma wrap combo, an order of hummus and a small side of tzatziki.   The shawarma was delightful!   So flavorful and delish.  So glad I got the tzatziki though...it was super amazing with that spread on top.   
Hummus was fab!   The pita that came with it was a little dry though.  But the hummus was outstanding.  
The tzatziki was super fresh and perfect with the shawarma.   I was a little bit confused by the sizing, however.   It came in a pretty big portion (I got the half order), and was easily twice the size of the hummus portion.  I would have preferred the sizing to be opposite (bigger hummus, smaller tzatziki).   But in any case it was outstanding!

Between the ground beef and ground chicken kabobs... They were both delicious, favorable, and juicy but I enjoyed the ground chicken the best! 

I usually do eat pickled jalapeño but today I chose not to try the grilled jalapeño. 

The grilled tomato had a gamey flavor that I wasn't a fan of. 

The rice was actually really good too. I'm more of a sticker white rice kind of Asian, so trying something different is always strange. But I was surprised and I enjoyed it.

And for my salad I chose the Armenian salad with olives and feta cheese. Winner! I could totally do a whole plate of it. 

My daughter has their kids chicken nuggets and fries...it was so good, she kept expressing how delicious it was.

3451996,2015-11-13,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Shawarma in northern part of Vegas and isn't the northwest!!! Those of us who reside in this area know we are limited when it comes to ethnic restaurants, now we have a fast food alternative that is NOT a franchise, a burger, fried chicken or a taco place! I was recently in Montreal and went crazy over the shawarma restaurants as I walked the city, and wondered why we do not have them here, and voila, my prayers were answered, they just opened 10 days ago!

I ordered the Beef Shawarma Plate, it was served with rice, hummus, pita bread, pickled turnips and a drink for $8.99. The beef was flavorful and was topped with a creamy garlic sauce to die for. The rice was flavorful and the hummus, I ate on its own because it was creamy and well seasoned. I am so pleased to have a go to place that is close, and the prices are reasonable because food is ordered at the counter.

I noted the Whole Rotisserie Chicken with pita bread, garlic sauce and pickled turnips for $8.49, I know I will be stopping by for that deal! Today I am returning to sample the Spas Armenian Yogurt Soup that is made on Fridays, I will add an update afterwards. 

This is a new restaurant on the corner of Jones and Craig. They are open  7 days a week 11-8 and they also deliver with a $20 minimum. The owner is from Armenia and is very passionate about his food. and I was made to feel welcomed.You know where I will be found!",LgiBFHIsRWIduc7HTq2rkA,5,2,5,5PQiRzsiJX1_aSaQMXusuA

3516979,2016-04-04,44,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Shawarma House is a much needed addition to this part of town! There are a few options around the area for Mediterranean, but Shawarma House is doing it right as far as the customer service and taste of the food offered. Inside is clean and they have tables and chairs with napkins and salt and shakers at each table. Sodas come in a can ($0.99 cents each) and they have bottled options (from $1.49 to $1.99) as well. From 2 pm until 4 pm (Monday - Friday) they have a Happy Hour that is worth checking out. The employees are very friendly and will offer you a sample if you aren't sure about something on the menu. I have placed to-go orders on my visits and the wait wasn't very long. 

Lentil Soup, House Salad and Pita ($5.99 during Happy Hour) - The HH price was very reasonable. The lentil soup had great flavor and worth trying out if you like that type of soup. The salad was a smaller version of their Armenian Salad and was good, but lacking the feta cheese that was offered for an additional $2. I thought it was silly to pay that much for the smaller version and declined politely. The pita was good and I liked the amount they gave and that it was warmed. 

Armenian Salad with Feta ($7.99 for full order) - This was a mixture of Armenian cumbers, tomatoes, red onion, feta cheese and oil and vinegar. The full salad is only $5.99 if you don't want feta cheese, but I recommend it. The salad had a fresh taste and they put a good amount of feta. The only bummer about this salad is that it doesn't come with any pita, which I am used to at other restaurants. It's an additional $0.49 cents for each pita. I also like tzatziki which comes in a half ($3.99) or full order ($5.99) sizes, but I didn't want that big of a portion, I just wanted a side of it. The girl who took my order gladly rang me up for a small side of tzatziki at $0.49 cents and it tasted really good. Definitely try the tzatziki if you like that sort of thing. 

Chicken Shawarma Slider ($1.99 each) - I was curious about how their chicken tasted and this was the perfect way to do just that. The pita was made in-house and the little pita pocket had chicken, tomato, lettuce and garlic sauce. The chicken had great flavor! I really love that they do not use pre-made frozen meat like some other places use. They actually season the meat themselves and layer it on the spit. The garlic sauce was good and the pita fell apart a bit, but was good also. 

This place is worth checking out and they do offer delivery aside from the option of dining inside or taking your order to-go.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,63,63,4,LpiNrGzpo6QGZM7783TPXA

Upon the recommendation of 3 different people, I decided to make a couple of trips up north to visit this restaurant tucked in a strip mall. 

I was greeted each time with a warm smile and friendly greetings. I noticed that the menu board had changed options slightly and I try to eat a balanced meal, whenever possible. As a pescatarian, I would like to see some seafood options, but the vegetarian options are just as good. I wanted the falafel plate, but it literally came with no vegetables except the pickled side dish. I decided to order the veggie skewer with a side of spicy tzatziki sauce. The spicy tzatziki is no longer on them menu, but they'll honor a request for it to be made if asked. 

A side dish is recommended as there is a wait for your food to be ordered since it is made fresh. The spicy tzatziki is to die for: a must get. It pairs nicely with warm pits and even as a side to your meal. The Armenian salad was standard and not overly dressed. I was pleasantly impressed with the presentation and flavor of a veggie kabob. The nice char with the herbs and spices really uplifted the meal. I liked that the skewer was removed and plated well over the rice. I was underwhelmed with the rice as I really expected it to be more flavorful and maybe with more spices or herbs. 

Regardless, I enjoyed my time and meal at this location. With the friendly service, I might come back for a lunch special or something under $10. I'll definitely be coming back with a friend.",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,2,1,4,lSvbD2lZtlUX2rGWEITiAw

My wife and I ordered here when we had a craving and when they first opened,  we both voluntarily handed out their flyers and menus in our neighborhood. Last week or so, my wife was out with my daughter and I was home. My doorbell rang and to my surprise, Shawarma house was delivering to my house. I thought my wife ordered it and asked if that was the case. I asked, "" if she already paid and if she already tipped?"" The driver and owner told me it was all taken care of. So, I took the food and opened it and ate a piece of chicken. I called my wife to let her know her food was here and she said, ""What food?"" Uh oh! So I call them and tell them, ""You delivered to the wrong house."" They asked if I wanted to buy it, but I didn't have the cash for it right then so I couldn't. They said they would send someone to pick it up......Mind you, I told them I ate out of it. Now, health wise and money wise, you're going to spend time and gas to pick up food I already ate out of.... Why????? To sell it anyway? To recycle it? To be petty? Why not say, I hope you like it, maybe this will get you to buy this off the menu next time. That's how you keep customers. I mean, what were you going to do with it? At that point, the best it could be is advertisement. Nope.. They picked the food up and lost a customer and my respect.

Comes with rice, grilled tomato, a choice of salad, pita bread and a soda. You can add hummus for $1.99 extra, and I did just that cuz I gotta have hummus lol

I don't remember exactly how long I waited, had to be about 10-15 mins tho. I am extremely hungry since I didn't eat all day yet but they were all very nice so I don't mind waiting.

3960216,2018-03-28,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Shawarma House has been my go-to takeout restaurant for a while. It's a breeze to order them on Yelp. My favorite entries are the Gyro Plate and the Lamb Chops Kabob. They are too amazing. 

Gyro plate has your choice of meat, rice, hummus--plenty much for one person. The meat was super tender and flavorful which is perfect when eaten together with the fluffy rice. I like to add some hot sauce (i.e. Sriracha) to the mix to make everything dance in my mouth. The pita bread is soft and has that chewy texture that I really like. Gyro plate is probably what I ordered the most often. 

Lamb Chops is the greater indulgence. At 17.99 plus tax, you get four big lamb chops perfectly cooked medium rare. The meat is always juicy and the succulent lamb taste lingers around which compels you to take another bite. I think medium rare is the default; they don't ask you ""how would you like your lamb chops"" but medium rare is what I consistently get.

Mind you my review is based only on food that was delivered, which probably means that the food could be even better if you go to the actual restaurant and eat your food right away.

4014366,2015-12-27,2,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Finally some decent Mediterranean food around my neck of the woods!  Family owned, Shawarma House hits the spot!

We liked it enough that we went two nights in a row for dinner!  The first night we went with the namesake, their beef shawarma.  The combo with seasoned fries, pickled turnips & a can of soda is $7.99.  The beef or chicken shawarma by itself is $5.99.  Not a bad deal for a meal, pricing about the same for other Mediterranean joints in town.

Didn't take long for things to come out.  Upon first inspection their shawarma could use a bit more of a serving of meat in the pita.  It was on the sparse side, but thankfully the shawarma meat that was there was pretty flavorful and tender.  Spiced right, and with the included garlic sauce they make, the shawarma was most tasty.  Like their fries too with the seasonings used, I think it's probably the same stuff they use for their shawarma meat.  Picked turnips were nice & purple, but didn't do much for me since they lacked any sort of flavor or pickling.

The second night we opted for 2 of their whole rotisserie chicken meals for $8.49 each.  Good value, the rotisserie chicken meal comes with a fresh made chicken, rice, pitas, hummus, garlic sauce, and pickled turnips.  Granted the chickens are on the small side (meaning not Costco humongous chicken) but they were moist and very flavorful with their Mediterranean dry rub.  This chicken stuffed in a pita and topped with some garlic sauce made for some good eating!

Rotisserie chicken was good enough for us to order a few more for lunch at our house on Thanksgiving!  Yep, chicken before the big turkey night event!  And our family really liked their chicken a lot.  They all agreed that garlic sauce adds a big flavor boost.  Could slather the stuff on a boot!

Will be visiting Shawarma House on the regular when I really need that pita fix.  Just gotta be sure to bring some Yelp breath mints!  Spicy!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,9,4,4,6ib4t0tahW0RqFXCK7BdjQ

The service was fast and friendly and I didn't feel pressured to hurry up and make a decision, because I had no idea what kind of food shwarma was. After I finally made a decision and went with a beef shawarma wrap my buddy order the chicken and we split it. Both of them was very tasty! I give the beef a slight edge and my buddy really enjoyed the chicken. We also had hummus with a pita wrap and that was tasty as well. I ended up spreading hummus on my shawarma.

4186006,2017-03-08,3,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Moral behind my long story - if you are aware that EAT24 has incorrect information and someone orders from EAT24 - you should have called to confirm that I knew what I was getting...instead of trying to upsell me, tell me I should have called instead of using EAT24, and kept comparing themselves to other companies...even though I never said anything about other companies. 


I have been to Shawarma House several times and the food is always delicious and always have the same lovely lady at the front desk. I am giving a three star due to the way I was ""upsold"" due to a EAT24 mistake, which I understand Shawarma House is not totally to blame. EAT24 states that falafel comes with 2 sticks where Shawarma house only offers 1 stick for their side order. I arrived to pick up my order and expressed my concern because it would not have been enough for my lunch. ( Shawarma House called to let me know pick up was ready but if they KNEW they were having those issues - they should have confirmed with me over the phone- and in that case I would have told them to change my order). I ended up spending way more than I should have. I would have gotten something different if I knew I was going to spend $4.00 on 2 Falafel sticks. The lady there tried to say ""well we give you special garlic sauce and other locations use power and we make our food fresh so you get what you pay for"" ""I told her that I ordered everything vegan so the garlic sauce would not work for me. She then told me that for an additional dollar, she could add a third stick. The issue should have been corrected right then and there and then Shawarma house should have handled it directly with EAT24 to get the money back, instead she told me to contact EAT24 and request a refund. 


At least the DOLMAS WERE ON POINT TODAY! YUM.

EAT24 responded and said that the ""manager"" at Shawarma house said incorrect information:
 

Shena: I just spoke with the manager at the restaurant and he said it is $1.99/stick and that is why you only got 2
12:37pm

Jody M.: That is incorrect.
12:39pm

Jody M.: The manger told me to contact you directly and ask for a refund because they have contacted you several times in regards to this issue
12:39pm

Jody M.: EAT24 states Falafel sticks $1.99. Having the S on there would make it plural.
12:40pm

Jody M.: I ordered 2- expecting to get 4 sticks
12:40pm

Jody M.: Your order form has it plural. Your order form is incorrect per the manager there.
12:40pm

Jody M.: I would not have paid $1.99 for 1 stick
12:41pm

Shena: Unfortunately I can not made them change anything.

I am use to eating Lebanese shawarma. I have to go back to Michigan to get good shawarma. I have not found anything close to it on the West Coast until now. The Shawarma House is pretty close. They cook the meat on the proper rotisserie machine. It was flavored different than I am use to, but it was good. The garlic sauce reminds me of the sauce the Greek restaurants use for the gyros, which I am not fond of. I did like the pita bread they use. They get it from California. You can't get good pita bread in Vegas.

Tabouli: Okay.
The parsley was not chopped fine enough and it need more bulgar wheat, salt, and olive oil.

Grape Leaves: Excellent,
The vegetarian grape leaves are served cold and were seasoned perfect.

Falafel Sandwich: Very Good.
I would say it was excellent if it was served with tahini sauce, but they use their garlic sauce.

Baklava: Okay.
It was okay. I have had better.

Hummus: Excellent!!

I will definitely be back to try more of their menu items. I recommend that you stop by and try this place. You won't be disappointed.",aD263WOD4RShoqgvVhcKqQ,10,6,4,5IboSbeBEe0v8NP2Gh5GRA

Thank goodness my check in with Yelp got me a free drink because I needed something to choke down the dry, mushy, unflavored chicken shawarma pita I ordered.  My friends also hated their food.  I pretty much knew the chicken shawarma plate my friend ordered would suck since my pita did but my other friend ordered the falafel and beef pita.  The falafel was so much to his disliking that he didn't even bother eating the pita.  So in all fairness that might have actually been good.  

However, it was a sad, sad day for my appetite and taste buds.  I'm normally not this harsh but upon reviewing my Wells Fargo bank statement the $19 spent there just reminded me of how annoyed I was that this was food was ugh!  Y'all were actually encouraging us to go on Yelp like you were just waiting to hear something good LOL!  If we would have eaten there I would have been honest with you but since we took it home here is the review you wanted.  I wouldn't suggest anything other than getting a better cook.....maybe someone who's actually middle eastern and not Black.

Food: ordered Beef Shawarma wrap - it was good, needed more Tzaziki sauce (i think that's what it's called), as it was a bit dry. It came with picked ""veggies"" which was picked cabbage - it was not good. Fries were okay.
Beef Kabob, opt for medium rare got well done. Cashier ask if he'd like to add feta cheese ($1.99) and olives ($.99) assuming it'll be a decent size salad, it was a tiny side. Not worth it.

When calling to tell them about it they not only wouldn't replace it (or even give me the missing sides) and said the salad was more of a dip and it was my fault somehow. In thier mercy they said I could order again and they'd wave the delivery charge. How this place has the rating it does is mind boggling.

Update: A manager named Angela called me a couple hours later to ask about customer service and food quality. Even though neither was very good, she talked to me for awhile to make sure she could do whatever she could to make things better and I have to commend her for coming down to my apartment to get the food because she wanted to show the owners. Also gave me a credit to another meal. I have to add 2 stars for that.

Newer update: Angela came personally to bring the food and it was amazing. It's hard to find a restaurant willing to make a customer this happy. Maybe it was just a bad night but they have done nothing more but be awesome about fixing the mistake and I will definitely order from them again.",NVbXd4SoaSZvP7Qjhr2GGg,0,0,5,H5uCkLhFHzGMGK_E5KQJ0Q

Tasty and juicy meat + their delicious garlic sauce. You should definitely try this. I've been disappointed by lots of places in town that serve shawarma but I wasn't disappointed by this place. Hooray! 4.5/5

Well, I figure since I was heading to see the lover for lunch...might as well, aye. I entered with babies in tow then was immediately greeted. Loved that! Especially since there were no other customer in the restaurant. No excuses. Belieeeeeve me there have been time I had entered a business with tumbleweeds rolling by and no one says a thing, looks at you look as if you just brought max occupancy.

The young lady working the front then handed me their menu, but I already knew what I was going to be getting. I ordered the #1 which is a chicken shawarma wrap, Mediterranean fries, and a can of soda. My french fry addict ordered, plain french fries! I mean, what else are you supposed to order at a Mediterranean restaurant, people! You come for the French fries! Lol. So I was happy that they sold plain french fries for the nagging minion. 

The side of fries cost $2.99. Serving was perfect. My #1 was 7.99 and again...the serving to me was perfect. The meat was not dry at all. I ordered to-go then had to wait for the lover to come out, which by then my beard grew and my food softened up abit. In fairness, I can't say how fresh the vegetables were or how perfectly fried the fries were because of that. None-the-less, I inhaled it! It was so good. I think if I ate it fresh it would've been even better! 

Bought the husband a baklava...he enjoyed it because it wasn't too sweet unlike other baklavas he has tried. I have a nut allergy, so I couldn't tell you if it was deelish or not. I spent a total of 15 bucks and a dime. Not bad.

Glad there is a Mediterranean joint nearby whenever I'm feeling shawarma-ish. Next time I think I'll try the plates instead of the wrap, then I can assess the situation properly. All-in-all...it was pretty good. Gets my recommendation until further notice. I'll definitely be back with the whole gang.

Fantastic food and great customer service. Well done!",J5OAGtHBpBW6w731cn6oOA,0,0,5,7fGdkWlN9TlZKbyuOSEYtA

If you like baklava you have to try theirs. It's such a good balance of ingredients and not overly sweet. All the pastries are also made in house. You can tell this is a family owned business and they take pride in making good food, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction-they really go above and beyond. I could go on-on about how good everything is but you should definitely have to try for yourself.",i25At3OIPk1hzEpyUQQ4ww,0,0,5,4DTmRKGp4wMj3HEjWjVKaA

5813569,2015-12-22,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,Very delicious food! We all had the beef shawarma and could not have been more pleased :) And the customer service was just as excellent to match. We were checked on several times to make sure everything was going well. And when they had even given us a beef plate instead of chicken by mistake they brought us the chicken to go anyway at no extra charge. We didn't even have to mention anything. Highly recommend if you're looking for great Mediterranean place.,eickIi71gSokCq05g5Li8Q,0,0,5,qSbQTORNDY8sTpobAJS1-A
5828451,2016-05-27,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"Let me start off by saying I am visiting from Los Angeles an area saturated with Mediterranean Food everywhere, so I eat a lot of it. Lets go step by step. Walking in the staff was awesome and they greeted me and my friends with smiles. Ordered the food ( I got the beef shawarma wrap) and before we knew it the food was ready and my eyes were wide open because of the portion. Took the first bite and it was so appealing  and delicious. On to the sides, which include Armenian salad and tabouleh. Both were delicious and again the portions are great! 

Summary:
- The plate was delicious, portions were perfect and price was very fair.
- Sides were delicious and appetizing and a great compliment to my wrap.
- Staff was very nice and helpful

Million dollar question.. .Would I recommend this place?? HECK YEAH!!! I will see you when I visit from LA.  Thank you shawarma house!!!",CC-4OXPsiSZbZB92Fhu6kA,2,0,5,SO4UmBXxvAHEdQHcmMR7Uw

5854405,2016-01-24,0,ozMd45nXHTCl3mdOwouwlw,"I've have been by Shawarma House a couple of times now, so decided it was time for the review. 

SERVICE -

Everyone here is very friendly and always greet me when I walk in the door. They have been prompt with whatever I order. I only had one small issue with a take-out order; *when I say ""no onions"", I mean NO ONIONS!!*

FOOD -

For the price point, I say the food is good but not great. I enjoy the Shawarmas, but I haven't been overwhelmed with anything just yet. Everything is slightly under-seasoned for my palate, but I'm yet to finish any meal. A solid choice for sure!

ATMOSPHERE -

The restaurant is new and very clean. Any unoccupied tables always clean and clear from any previous patrons. Floor and rest of the interior are very clean. I hate walking into any restaurant and seeing dirty cups/dishes/trash in general left over from other customers.

All and all, I like the place and will continue to order from here. It has a great price point and is a different offering in this part of the Valley.",bc8C_eETBWL0olvFSJJd0w,3,1,3,IILIYOCC4amYnDD5KMPIYg
