445426,2012-04-27,1,CgnHLwWbteqb8qxcZgBLyw,"Oh no. I previously gave this place 4 stars based on their Thai BBQ Chicken. I still love that dish but I made the mistake of attempting to order their Pad See Ew. It's a dish with flat rice noodles sauteed in soy sauce with chinese broccoli. I love this dish at Thai restaurants. If it's done well, it's quite addicting. As for this dish...

Way too much pepper! It was more like Pad See EWWWW!  I took my first bite and wanted to spit it out. I guess I should have mixed everything together, but cmon, should I really have to do that? It should have been mixed together for me already. There was no balance of flavors. It was just pepper and a lot of it.  It wasn't too bad after I tossed everything together, but I was still traumatized from the first bite that I was scared with every bite after that.

Not a good dish from there at all. However, their bbq chicken has saved them from total downfall and I probably will attempt to order a different dish from their establishment (just not the Pad See Ew).",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,1,1,2,ZD1v5DR22gTw_2s37pw9EQ

This is actually one of their nicer locations.  More roomy than most and I did spot a small stage for what appeared to be karaoke.  

The service was prompt and friendly.  He was even messing with me as I joyfully suffered through my Drunken Noodle (Spicy level 10!), it's always a good sign when the server puts the effort in to make a connection with the patrons.  

Food wise, I would recommend their Specials: S-1 (BBQ Chicken), S-4 (Honey Duck), or S-10 (Sate Skewers)...all served with a plentiful side of fried rice with shrimp.

The location is much bigger and has more available sunlight that the jones location so I do like that. The dining area is clean and well kept. I have never been in their bathroom so I cannot comment on that. 

I ordered their Thai Beef Jerky with a side of sticky rice. This dish is always good and the dipping sauce is tasty. I also ordered chicken Pad Thai. I asked for medium spice. My pad Thai had no spice at all... Just that slices of bell pepper were added to it... Never ever have I had or seen bell peppers in pad Thai. So I was extremely disappointed that was added because it distinctly changes the chemistry and flavor. That jones and Flamingo location has never put bell peppers in my pad Thai. And there was no lime on my plate so when I asked for lime... I was disappointed to find out they had no limes just lime juice.

The food was good like it always is. It's family style so you can share everything. They were out of beef satay :( & only had sodas, Thai tea & water available to drink which was a big inconvenience for the babies & my niece since they wanted apple juice. 

Also, there was only 1 server the whole time we were there. Luckily there was only 1 other table eating when we arrived. I felt bad for the server for having to take care of such a large party by himself but he did a good job on checking on us and making sure to take away each cleared plate.

The chicken and pork were incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly, and it came with tons of shrimp fried rice that's loaded with shrimp.  On the side was their ""house sauce"" which is a sweet-spicy sauce that is HIGHLY addictive and I poured it over everything on my plate :) The portions of the entrees were very generous too -- you could easily get 2 meals out of each entree.

Upon arrival we were greeted immediately, but once seated no one came up to us for about five minutes. Once the waiter came up to us, he seemed as if he was in a hurry and seemed annoyed at us. 

As for the food, they do offer more lunch specials than the other locations which is nice. But, the portions seemed a lot smaller. On my second time trying this restaurant, I tried the BBQ duck lunch special. There was more sauce than anything, very small pieces of duck and a few Chinese broccoli here and there. 

Also, there was no unlimited Thai Tea refills. That's one of my favorite things about the other location, is unlimited thai tea !!!! 

Overall, I probably won't be back. The service was bad both times I went and the food was just alright. The further drive to the other location is fully worth it.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,3,1,3,CJGBTFrYoBJqx7F3bBVxzw

That atmosphere was very nice, perhaps a little more upscale than the ""hole in the wall"" Thai restaurant.  The service was good, although the server had me box my left overs even though I was the only customer.  That's ok though, the food is the important thing.  I ordered Thai Iced Tea, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Red Curry with Beef.

The pineapple fried rice was very good.  It wasn't greasy or bland, but had a nice subtle flavor with a hint of smokiness.  It included pieces of shrimp, imitation crab, chicken, tomato, and fresh pineapple.  It was a bit generic, and perhaps not totally authentic in flavor, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.  

 The red curry with beef was fairly impressive.  It was well prepared with green and red peppers, and with a medium heat, it had a nice spicy flavor, not bland at all.  The curry was soupy, and although I had to ask for white rice with it, I quite enjoyed it.  My only reservation about this dish was that the beef was just a little tough.  

The presentation of the food was very well executed.  The atmosphere  was upscale and relaxing. The service is pretty good too.

The satay beef is extremely flavorful, and you can tell they are authentic by the way they marinated their beef for days. The panang curry is perfect because the beef is not just solid meat pieces, but includes plenty of fat which makes any/all curries delicious!!!

When I walked in, I was pleasantly.  It was a very clean, nice looking and nicely decorated restaurant.  It was very quiet - not too many customers, but still, quite quaint.

They sectioned off part of the restaurant for our exclusive use.  My aunt pre-ordered trays of food and they laid everything out with plates, etc and we would get food at our leisure (buffet style).

First off, the food was delicious! The Pad Thai was one of the best that I've tried (and I don't usually like the Pad Thai at places) and the Chicken and Beef Barbeque (especially the ones on the skewer) were very very tasty. :] Both had just the right amount of flavor that complimented the food. They definitely know what they're doing.

On top of the good food, they had GREAT service.  The waiters were always on top of things and even cleared your plate as soon as you were finished.  One waiter even asked me if there was something I needed help with or needed just because I was looking around. That kind of attentiveness comes around quite rarely.  PLUS, when all was said and done - you know, cake, presents, the works, they even helped us to carry out the leftover trays and cake to the car. Now THAT is going above and beyond. :]

Overall, I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and would love to go back and try it as a regular customer and not just a ""party guest."" lol.

I received half of a chicken that was cooked until it was lightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with a BBQ flavor that was not overwhelming.  My plate also included a large portion of shrimp fried rice that was both moist and flavorful.  Service throughout was excellent.  

We returned the following evening to allow Ann to order the BBQ chicken while I tried another of the house specialties, BBQ ribs.  We also enjoyed a Thai cucumber salad.  My wife's chicken was as good as the night before. The ribs were tasty, but too tough.  Our server on both nights was excellent.",L8P5OWO1Jh4B2HLa1Fnbng,2,2,4,IGire5VN9aKMEV1r3fkzGQ

* TERRIBLE SERVICE *
**************************
They charge for extra bbq sauce.  The one that comes with the meal is 
tiny.

*** Charging for extra sauce is ridiculous especially for a BBQ place.

The Thai lady who works there was very moody and rude.

First visit
The waitress did not seem to want to be there; she gave us an attidute to the normal things asked for like napkins and refills.  We had such a bad experience I did not want to tip.  At the end I felt bad thinking maybe she had a bad day and left a normal tip.  We decided that we would never dine-in again.

Second visit
Wanting to bypass the terrible service we decided to order out.  Upon arriving to pick up the order we received the same attitude.  Having paid the bill I asked for extra BBQ sauce.  She immediately threw a fit, stormed back to the kitchen and brought back some sauce to which I happily paid for because they charge for extra sauce.
Guess what? - The To-Go order didn't even have sauce to begin with!  WTH?  She should have known that she did not give us any sauce and she charged us extra for the ones I asked for.  Of course this was verified at home.

4840139,2011-02-20,0,CgnHLwWbteqb8qxcZgBLyw,"I first walked into this restaurant skeptical. My favorite Thai place has been Kung Fu for over 15 years, and I haven't been too impressed by any others in town. I got a Groupon for this restaurant, it was near my home, so I decided to give it a shot; I am so glad I did.

This is a small and quaint spot, with a welcoming decorum. The staff is pleasant and welcoming. In addition to the surface beauty, the food was phenomenal. All items on the menu are priced reasonably, and there is so much to choose from. As a fan of Thai cuisine for most of my life, having grown up with a Thai family, I was a little concerned over the way a couple of items on the menu were described as being served. But my concern was immediately erased once I ate all my favorite dishes. Everything was perfect. The Chicken Sate was tender and moist, the Tom Kha Gaiwas unbelievable full of flavor and a mighty serving to boot. And my ultimate deciding factor dish, Chicken Pad Kapow, blew me away! A friend of mine, who is a Vegetarian, enjoyed the Tofu Pad Thai and kept remarking on how great it was (he is notorious for his complaints about Vegetarian dishes I might add). So overall, I will say this is on the ranks of my highly recommended establishments for, not just good Thai food, but overall great food. 

The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is the fact that I was not given steamed rice with my dish, and that the shrimp I requested in my Tom Kha Gai was replaced with chicken. The chicken was good, but I would've much preferred the Shrimp I had requested.",5xGO2SXrxv5_sYDrwXvh2g,2,0,4,iLWuBkU-UC8am9EHu4Wn-g
4943193,2012-02-19,1,CgnHLwWbteqb8qxcZgBLyw,"I always go to this place! I absolutely love it. The servers are always very friendly. Plus, the food is amazing!

I either get the chicken curry or the bbq chicken. I recently tried the pineapple curry.. and as a request, they even did half chicken & half shrimp for me.

I've tried the crispy duck but wasn't really impressed, but everything else is pretty delicious. The curry is mild, well to me anyway. It has a very tiny kick to it. I wish sometimes that they would give us an option on the spicy level.

The servers are always nice.. they're not super attentive like what you would come across in a neighborhood restaurant (Applebee's, Chili's, TGIF, etc). But that's to be expected at pretty much any Asian restaurants.
 
The only reason I'm docking off a star is because I would like the option of determining how hot & spicy the dishes should be. (Other Thai restaurants do this)",cYvO88wNlRc_gd03caBZ7Q,1,2,4,G4iTHSeRhZHhiER9Zek0aA
4974401,2010-08-20,0,CgnHLwWbteqb8qxcZgBLyw,"Weekday lunch specials are always a bargain, and this was no exception at Thai BBQ on W. Flamingo.

From the outside, Thai BBQ looks like a fast food joint.  But you'll be surprised with the nice sit down restaurant feel inside.  

There are about 14 choices under the Lunch Special menu, with only one of them being vegetarian.

I went for the L-12 Beef Panang Lunch Special ""Chunks of tender beef cooked in curry and coconut milk, served with steamed rice."" ($6.50).  I was more excited about the curry and coconut milk than the beef part.  The sauce was definitely tasty on the white rice, but the beef was a bit heavy.  It made for great leftovers (with a bit of peanut sauce) says the Husband.

Whereas he chose the L-14 BBQ Pork Sate Lunch Special ""Marinated pork grilled on a bamboo skewer, served with peanut sauce, cucumber sauce, and fried rice."" ($6.50).  He usually goes for the Beef Sate, but it's not offered here during the lunch special.  Nonetheless, we both really like it and I found myself nibbling more his protein than mine.  The cucumber sauce is more like a a cucumber salad with red onions and jalapeno slices in a vinaigrette. 

I really liked their version of the Thai Ice Tea ($1.95). It was strongly brewed and sweet!  Yum! 

Service was great. There were a handful of customers and the waiter was attentive and friendly.  Definitely no problems there.

Sidenote: They could definitely update their bathroom though.  However, I do appreciate the Charmin toilet paper they use!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,5,3,4,qqCxGK95kLy5feMWAINMzw

Their Chicken Penang Curry wasn't as great as the one I had in Seattle but it's good enough.  It had the sweetness and spiciness I wanted.  The only downfall to this restaurant is that you have to pay $1.25 for rice when most other Thai places will give it freely and no charge.  Maybe the economy is affecting them that they have to charge for it.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,2,0,3,r51dfPo6SWP51RibQgGfzg
5237300,2011-05-19,3,CgnHLwWbteqb8qxcZgBLyw,"OK, I must stay loyal to Thai BBQ chain because they introduced me to the pleasures of Thai food. BUT I must say, this particular location really let me down. I've been to this location a number of times, and for my first review for them I'm disappointed to report that the staff here really needs to get their stuff together! I found a much better Thai food restaurant and will no longer be going the Thai BBQ, unless I'm extremely desperate for Thai food. WHY? Because on final bon voyage visit to Thai BBQ, I experienced the worst service and delivery. 

The hostess that was there that night was unbelievably rude, for example, we arrived at 9pm and they close at 10pm, so when she greeted us she looked at her watch and rolled her eyes. Not to mention the mean mug we saw when we first walked in. Then to follow, literally two minutes after we sat down, she came up to us and asked us if we were ready to order, she didn't even ask if we wanted something to drink first. As we waited for our meal we glanced over at her and noticed that 1) she never smiled (looked extremely angry) and 2) Was talking on the phone while she sat other guest. This had to have been the worst hostess in the world!! OK so got our meal and felt extremely uncomfortable every time the waitress came by- which wasn't a whole lot and finally time to leave- we decided to be nice and leave a tip of $1 even though we felt she really didn't deserve it. Meal was less than $20. As we walked out to our car we glanced back and noticed the waitress mad-dogging us as we left! NO JOKE! She had the blinds open and was staring us down. Then she followed us outside, stood there, and gave us a look of death! I'M NOT KIDDING. ON TOP OF THAT she came out a second time as we were in the car pulling out, and started pointing and yelling something that we couldn't understand. At that point we were burning rubber out of the parking lot! We understand that leaving a dollar might have been insulting to her, but we figured it was better than nothing given her crappy attitude and poor delivery. Had we known we would be harassed out of the parking lot that night by an ornery waitress we mightve brought some protection. 

I don't want to end on a negative note because like I said, I started out with Thai BBQ, as far as meals go I suggest the BEEF SATE (comes with a delicious peanut sauce that is to DIE for, Marinated sliced beef or chicken, in a mixture of Thai spices and coconut milk grilled and served on bamboo skewers with cucumber salad.) I've had the Chicken Sate but it wasn't as good as the beef. I'm huge on curry, and the Yellow chicken curry is good except I'm not a huge fan of simply adding sliced green peppers in the curry to make it spicy. At the very least try a side of their fried rice- DELICIOUS! and so sweet- you'll love it!",3hWJxx8-gMutgaKY2T7IKQ,2,2,2,QKYxsIeiJ1-ob_QTQPyhJQ
5390425,2013-01-16,2,CgnHLwWbteqb8qxcZgBLyw,"My first and last time eating at Thai Original BBQ.  Oooooh, how dramatic!  I bet you can't wait to see what disaster I incurred!   Well, none.  I got the right food that I ordered, it was close enough to being available at the time promised, and the service and price were fine.   

No, the reason I won't be back is that compared to all of the other quality Thai offerings Vegas has to offer, it simply wasn't good enough.  I will be the first to admit that Thai BBQ is suffering the affect of being the ~21st Thai restaurant I've tried here in Las Vegas, many of which are outstanding in every aspect.  I can't help but compare any new Thai restaurant to class acts such as Weera Thai or Prommares, neither of which is exceptionally far from this location of Thai BBQ.   All that being said, let's get to it:

I called in my order of a Chili Chicken lunch special because it seemed closest to what I normally order when I get Thai and also because of the lovely photo uploaded of the same dish in the photos here.  No seriously, look at this beautiful dish:  http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IBxLi-C_it0Rm-m6N0TQDg/l.jpg     I was told it'd be ready in 15 minutes and I arrived probably a few minutes beyond that.

Upon entering it took a few minutes for the solitary server to get my order.  It wasn't an extremely long wait and she did seem very busy waiting actual tables so it didn't bother me.  If she was on her phone using snapchat or tumblr or sextor or whatever new app the kids use nowadays, I'd be a little more bothered by this.  

Got back to my office and was a little disappointed in a few things.  1) That pic I posted above?  Mine looked nothing like that.  The chicken was chopped up sloppily and not beautifully ground up as you see above.  It was like going to Wendy's and expecting to get that 99 cent burger that can barely fit in Wendy's mouth on the commercial, only to receive one that your pet hamster can gobble in one bite.  2) No eggroll.   As a matter of fact, there was nothing but the chicken dish and the rice.  Now nothing extra was promised or advertised, but it seems pretty customary for most Thai restaurants to provide SOMETHING with the lunch special besides the discount.  If anything it adds a little value that I could have used after being charged $2 for my brown rice upgrade.   

The food that WAS provided, tasted okay, but not great.  The rice seemed a little mushier than I prefer, and as I mentioned before the chicken was pretty haphazardly chopped up.   

Sorry Thai BBQ, that ultimately winds up being worth 2 stars.  If you'd have gotten to me a year ago, you probably would have eeked out a 3.  Where's Doc Brown when you need him?",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,8,2,2,LY-iHqVtgLGraUYLHj2t_A

My Pad Thai wasn't very flavorful and the Beef with Broccoli looked so gross I didn't even want to taste it.  We ended up tossing it all and having cereal instead.

5778760,2011-07-19,1,CgnHLwWbteqb8qxcZgBLyw,"Been to other locations in town but my first time here - outside doesn't look promising, but the inside looks much better than the rest. Its decorated with dark woods and statues, the type of place I wouldn't mind a sit down meal. I came because of a $20 for $10 groupon, and the woman at the register was super sweet. A lot of times places kind of give you a little sneer when you break out the groupon or restaurant.com but she was just as pleasant and smiley. 

I did a to go order of ala carte garlic short ribs, honey duck and spicy beef salad w Thai tea. I'm really not a fan of this chain's shrimp fried rice so I never get the house specials. Total for everything was about $28 cheap!

Friends had highly recommended the spicy beef salad, but I wasn't that impressed. When I saw slices of beef in the description, I assumed a piece of beef sliced like most other Thai beef salads I've had. This was thinly sliced then cooked, basically what they'd put in their noodle or rice dishes. Cooked with julienned carrots and served over a few romaine lettuce leaves w cucumbers, onions, chilis, lime juice and cilantro. I got 5 out of 10 spicy and it had just enough heat for me. 

The garlic shirt ribs are probably my fav dish there. Its a generous portion of little pork ribs fried super crispy and dredged in a sweet soy sauce. It reminds me of Hawaii style Korean chicken. Yum! Ribs are mostly meat, a lot of boneless chunks and not too fatty which is a plus.

Honey duck was also disappointing, but at least reasonably priced. A half (small) duck for $8. It says roasted but I'm pretty positive it was fried. It was really crispy like the ribs but meat was pretty dried out. Had no seasoning or taste on its own, but served with a sweet honey sauce on the side. 

It was a ton of food and with 2 ppl sharing we still had a lot left over. This is the best of the original Thai BBQ chain in Vegas, and I'd definitely come back (because I bought 2 groupons!)",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,0,0,4,xZ83DEl306PNKK_2rw0l-g

I usually try a curry dish at Thai restaurants, but have not been here enough times yet to give that a try, but they look really good.  I tried the sate dish (pork) served with fried rice, and with the peanut dipping sauce was just plain good eats!
