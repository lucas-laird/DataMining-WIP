We had made a reservation for 9 and got there around 8:30 and they were able to seat us after about 10 minutes. Our waitress came over pretty quickly after we sat down but then it just went downhill from there. We had ordered drinks and the waitress brought my friend the wrong beer. We then ordered edamame and a bunch of sushi cut rolls, We were really hungry b/c we had just traveled to Vegas and went straight to dinner from the airport. We ordered the spicy tuna, salmon avocado, shrimp tempura and spicy scallop rolls. It then took about 45 mins. to get our rolls and we were starving! We ate those rolls pretty fast once they got to the table. We were still hungry, so for some reason we thought it would be a good idea to get some more rolls. Bad idea. The next set of sushi rolls took another hour. We almost wanted to cancel the order b/c it was taking so long. We were hungry but also tired and just wanted to get out of there. 

After we finally got the second set of sushi rolls, we immediately asked for our bill b/c we knew that would take a while, which we were right about. 

After about another 20 minutes, we were able to pay our bill and leave. 

As far as the sushi goes, it was really good. Our favorite was the shrimp tempura. Our least favorites were the spicy scallop and tuna b/c they were not spicy. 

The whole meal lasted almost 2.5 hours, which is pretty ridiculous. Not sure if I would go back b/c I don't think I have the patience.",WQbJUmnkVpbbOaWMQloHDg,0,0,2,XG9vnDa1BejZSXlP327qRA
17820,2009-01-06,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"I will start off by saying that I have been to social house more than once and my first visit was excellent and couldn't wait to bring everyone i knew... that was 3 years ago. My second trip was medium to great and my last experience this past Saturday was absolutely horrible. 

The front desk reservation person was completely off the wall and gave the puppy eyes as if that was going to make the 45 minute late seating after our reservation worth it. Furthermore, she said it would be 5 min, not 45.  the bartender tried to remedy the situation by feeding me alcohol. 

ONTO THE FOOD

The waiter was a super nice guy, understands the business and knows how to deal with people and the feed, sit in Nate's section if you can, he gets it. 

The manager came by, I tried to explain my disappointment with the host, and he gave me the I'm on top of it, but i could give two bits of crap. The fake smile and talking about how great his restaurant was and how great rolls were .... if you are proud of something and want people to try it... bring them a sample.   

cucumber salad was excellent, sushi was medium to okay... kobi salad was great....  curry lobster roll ... that roll keeps them in business in addition to the explosions by treasure island. Michael, the sake sommelier, was very smart and knew his sake... talk to him if you want sake . hamachi with the tempura jalapenos...seemed like a knockoff from nobu ..nonetheless it was tasty.. i ordered a half lobster, it came out TWO TIMES UNDERCOOKED....    so no more social house for me... the manager did nothing to want to keep me there... i feel bad because nate and michael the waiter and sommelier knew their stuff....  impression from management..... we are social house... wait for our half bad food.... reservations are a joke... and we can get leftover tourists who want sushi

112225,2013-08-27,1,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"The most expensive meal we had in Vegas was at Social House, an Asian restaurant located inside Crystals at CityCenter. The interior of the restaurant was absolutely gorgeous. I have got to say, almost all the Vegas restaurants we visited had fantastic decor.

The menu is rather typical of a Japanese restaurant, sashimi, sushi, rolls, etc. Since this was our splurge meal of the trip, we opted for the Social House Omakase, at 95 USD per person. The Omakase consists of seven courses, chosen by the chef. The price is rather typical. You would expect a similar price point, give or take 20 dollars, to enjoy an Omakase in a Japanese restaurant in Toronto. Considering we are dining on the Las Vegas Strip, this is really not that bad.

Here are the seven courses, all were good:

First course: Yellowtail jalapeno
Second course: Albacore Garlic
Third course: Tuna Special
Fourth course: Citrus Peel Miso Cod
Fifth course: Sea Bass
Sixth course: Five-piece sushi
Seventh course: Strawberry sorbet

I need to clarify something. We put in the special request of ""No red meat and no dairy"", which was probably the reason behind the two consecutive cooked fish courses (4th and 5th) and the sorbet for dessert. Hey, what else are a non-redmeat-eater supposed to eat, if not more fish? Certainly not their Spicy Ponzu Kobe Sashimi or their Hanger Steak with roasted shallot and Wasabi cream sauce! Sorry for teasing you with delicious sounding dishes.    :P 

Please come and visit my blog, where I have pictures of every course and more ;)
Thanks in advance.

Upon first visual the place is just as stunning looking as the mall. It was dark, sexy, and filled with pretty people. We settled in at the bar and ordered some martinis.  Our bartender was an uber sexy Asian gal wearing a corset. My husband says I need to start wearing corsets too :)

We started with cucumber sunomono and a couple specialty sushi rolls. One roll was kalbi beef, the other was vegetarian. Loved both of these.  The kalbi was slightly crispy from a quick frying. The vegetarian was filled with a nice bit of cream cheese. Next we tried the Himachi specialty roll and the spicy scallop roll. Again, these were spot on. The spicy scallop came with a yummy sauce that could've been eaten alone!

The rolls had 6 pieces each. Just enough to fill our tummies and continue on with our night, without feeling too bloated. And they weren't over-the-top expensive either. I think the highest one was $12.

Social House makes up for ""Vegas prices"" by offering the friendliest staff I've experienced in a long time. And the atmosphere is cool.

I'm really not a huge fan of saki, but theirs tasted like fresh squeezed watermelon juice.. of which I AM a fan.  I also liked that they serve it chilled because warm saki kinda grosses me out.  This was also the 1st time I have ever tried yellowtail sashimi, as I usually stick to ahi tuna and salmon sashimi... but Social House has now broken my old sashimi ordering routine for good.  The other items we enjoyed were the miso cod, crab & shrimp fried rice, and lychee beigents.

Yes, the food is a bit pricey, but Social House is still 5 stars in my book cuz of the awesome staff who totally HOOKED US UP for the night w/ VIP services at the new Christian Audigier Nightclub below, as well as LAX and PURE.

We came here for dinner on Saturday night at around 6:30pm, so no waiting in line. The waitress lead us upstairs for a table of two at the  corner. The interior design and ambiance was very nice. A little too dark, that we couldn't see our food clearly. May be because we sat in the corner.

As soon as we sat down, a waiter came and asked us if we would like some water. We said yes and he asked ""sparkling or plain?"" And I said sparkling. At the end when we got the bill, $7.50 was charged for that bottle of water. I was not happy about that service as he didn't mention sparkling water is not free. As a high-end restaurant like this, this is not a good customer service. So I took out one star for the service.

We ordered two Social House rolls: shrimp, spicy tuna battera $20 for 6 pcs; and hamachi, chilies cilantro, garlic chips with citrus soy sauce $12 for 6 pcs. Both rolls were just ok, just a decent Japanese roll. For hot dishes, we ordered pan peared sea scallop, nasu miso, curry emulsion $26 for 6 pcs, citrus peel miso cod $22, and searing tuna with Social House ginger dressing $24. All of them were yummy, but the portions were small. 

We also ordered a small bottle of cold sake called ""Rihaku Wandering Poet"" $38, which was the best sake I've ever had so far! Finally, we ordered crispy ice cream $10 for dessert. We substituted with coffee ice cream. The ice cream was wrapped with crunchy sweet corns and taro sweet paste served on the side. Delicious!

It is a fusion Japanese restaurant, so don't come here for authentic Japanese food. Also I think their hot dishes are much better than the sushi rolls. Unfortunately, I think the food is a bit overpriced. Otherwise, it worth going there again.",OfBxv_lindDyWpqyvK_pzw,1,2,4,iobiRChuP_Zeq-BVGQoZXw

I only hung out at the bar/lounge area which came across as an old school yet modern asian inspired lounge.  Of course there's bar seating but there's also a few tables in the lounge area to serve small groups.  If you wanted to, you can order from the full menu here as well....not just from the bar menu. 

Highly recommend the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno.   Well balanced flavors from the ginger and jalapeno.  The texture and overall kick was tasty.

Bartenders were very attentive to my needs, making sure my glass was never empty.  In fact when they poured my beer from the bottle to a glass, they left the bottle with its remaining beer next to the glass.  Okay yeah not weird....but the cool part was every time they did that, the bartenders consistently made sure the bottle was turned so that the label was facing me.  Yeah at first I thought it was coincidence but then I realized each bar staff did that consistently.  Yes I drank that much to make sure it was consistent each and every time.

We ordered snow crab dynamite as recommended by the waiter, and it was disgusting. It was simply fake crab meat covered with heavy cream and cheese that seemed semi baked.

I've had ceviches, I've had Japanese Hamachi (Yellowtail) and I clearly know the difference between the good and the bad. But, this was hard to categorize. I just don't know how they managed to make it so bad that it just broke out of my chart. After these dishes, I decided to stop ordering, and asked for the bill. It came out to $95 after taxes.

for our meal, we let our waiter, garrett, give us the grand tour of the haute items of the social house.  we started off with some tuna tataki in ponzu sauce.  my mouth went crazy after taking a thinly sliced piece of seared kobe beef.  that piece of meat was so thin and drizzled in garlic infused olive oil that it just melted in my mouth.  the same thing happened with the thinly sliced yellow tail drizzled in jalapeno infused olive oil.  they have their fish flown in daily.  i had to have toro (so silky and just the right temp...it melted in my mouth) and uni (cold and really creamy).  we also got special social hose rolls...curried lobster w/avocado and cucumbers and a kobe tataki and marinated shitake mushroom roll.  we also had giant chunks of shrimp and lobster cooked with lemongrass. for our last savory dish, we had soy mirin kurobuta pork belly.  it was atop a japanese pumpkin mash, which was supposed to even out the saltiness of the pork, but i think it overpowered it with its sweetness.  i said, ""the hell with it"" and ate the moist and tender soy marinated pork belly.  our waiter, had a specially made platter that included most of the desserts on the menu, mochi filled mochi, chocolate molten cake with toasted melting marshmellow, pancakes over rice pudding (uninteresting), a very very light cheescake, a guava sorbet, a tangerine sorbet, and my favorite freshly made coffee ice cream (kona blend...the fragrant aroma just lit up my nose)  i also have to add this meal was not without sake b/c we had a whole bottle of momokawa pearl unfiltered sake.

Since the rolls were so expensive, we thought that we'd get the most bang for our buck by ordering the pre-fixe menu which is about $49/person.  It comes with edamame, a salad of your choice, sashimi appetizer, entree of your choice, and dessert of your choice...

Let's start with the good...

Service was great.  We didn't have to wait long for our food at all.
 
Patio - the view of the strip was awesome.

Now the bad...

The sashimi appetizer was 3 thinly sliced pieces of fish.  This hardly constitutes as an appetizer.  Unsatisfying.

Salad - The kelp salad was yummy...the chicken salad was just your run of the mill greens plus grilled chicken.  I could have made it at home.

Entree - Steak was tender & the fish of the day (halibut) was good...but it was just meat.  Maybe 2 or 3 vegetables.  Couldn't the entree at least come with a bowl of rice?  The cost would be maybe 50 cents?

Dessert - The mochi was SMALL (make a circle with one hand and that's how big it was), but the lychee flavor was good.  My husband ordered the sorbet, and unfortunately the chef's choice of the day was cucumber sorbet.  Have you ever had Korean pickled cucumber?  It tasted like that in sorbet form.  Not good.

The food itself was pretty good but for some reason, I remember the yellowtail sashimi being much better at Nobu Next Door, I think it was fresher there.

1009460,2008-12-29,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"Social house is one of my favorite sushi spots on the strip, great for any meal, and for some reason, is in Treasure Island -- don't let the location turn you away, there's nothing to scare you away at this restaurant!

Social house is tastefully decorated, offering great ambiance, and as an added bonus -- open late night.  The hours make Social House a great option either pre or post an evening out on the town.  The seating and lighting are tastefully elegant, but understated -- a rare find in Vegas.  The sushi bar is equally well done, and great for those few times you're in the city alone.

There are two bars in the restaurant, one closest to the north end of the property; which is great for small groups that want to eat/socialize; and one on the other end -- a little louder but a great spot for some drinks afterwards.  Other seating options consist of indoor seating alcoves (small groups of seats,) indoor seating areas with traditional table arrangements; and outdoor seating.  Outdoors is probably a better option for large groups or for folks that don't mind noise, as you will hear the pirate ship show going on outside if you choose to be seated there.

The staff are very efficient and knowledgeable, and the food competitively priced for a typical upscale, quality experience.  My water glass was never empty -- and my drink wasn't either for that matter!

I've had multiple dishes in this restaurant -- everything from the standard rolls and sashimi fare -- but would highly recommend the Hamachi Jalapeño dish from the menu.  It's a house specialty, with the Hamachi tastefully cut thin, placed in a sauce, with small chips of jalapeño on the top that have been flash-fried.  It sounds a bit odd, but the fusion of tastes is amazing -- and a great appetizer for a group.

The well-stocked bar is not that uncommon for Vegas, but the selection of Saki definitely is -- you'll find what you want (both from a food and beverage perspective) here at this establishment.

Social House tends to get busy during peak periods, so reservations are suggested based on my experience.  Fortunately, you can do these online -- making it even easier.  The total experience will make it worth the effort -- and you'll come to appreciate this find in Vegas.",jvk_0W69kOWdF9c5weqc-A,0,0,5,UoOb44gCUOPwgXPLEl0_rg

My 5-star reviews are few and far between these days, particularly because many of the restaurants I've visited in the past few months have missed the mark in some way or another.  Social House provided that rare experience that combines the best of ambiance, food and service. 

The modern restaurant is visually stunning from the moment you first walk into the lounge area and then sashay up to the host table. We had made a last minute Open Table reservation on a Friday night, and we were seated as soon as we came in. I loved the set up of the restaurant. First, they put us in the back area, but it was a little too dark for my taste, so we asked if we could have one of the booths in the front section. They were so accommodating, and said we would love this new table as it gave us a view of everyone who parades by. And it sure did! I am 100 percent sure my husband was the oldest person in the restaurant, and even being 16 years his junior, I am about 80 percent sure that I was the next oldest. But it sure was fun people watching . . . bachelor and bachelorette parties galore with some of the most interestingly dressed and entertaining people gliding by us.

Our server was fabulous! The menu offers so many wonderful options and he helped guide us through the choices, pointing out the fabulous and steering us away from the ordinary. We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno. Don't be put off thinking it might be too spicy . . . it's not . . . a perfect melding of flavors with the tender Yellowtail and the crunchy jalapeno in a cilantro soy base. Next up . . . the salmon tartare, which was my favorite. The combination of the fresh and silky salmon layered with wasabi cream and drizzled with citrus soy was heavenly . . . so much so that I ordered another just for myself while hubby was licking his chops -- literally -- the tender Kurabuta Pork Ribs smothered in a sweet soy glaze were falling off the bone. We then shared the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups . . . while we loved the dish, we found this a little skimpy for the price with only two pieces. As I was getting quite full, I opted to order only the roasted miso eggplant which put the finishing touches on my great meal.. My hubby with his big appetite ordered the hangar steak with roasted shallots and more of that delectable wasabi cream sauce. From pig heaven to cow heaven!

Social House is totally a hip place, even for us not-so-hip middle-agers. We had a fantastic meal, conscientious service and ""free"" entertainment. No doubt we will make another trip to Social House on our next trip to LV.

We'll start with service first.  The service was okay, not super attentive, but my issues fall more with the 'mistakes' that occurred.  My sister-in-law is a celiac and cannot have any gluten products (tempura, soy sauce, etc...).  This was communicated and understood by our server, but when the sushi was delivered all rolls we put on one plate, meaning tempura flakes and soy spreading between the rolls.  Which rendered half of her rolls inedible and we sent some back to be placed on different plates.  My friend also asked for a glass of ice which took two requests over 10 or so minutes to get.

However, the only thing that keeps me from making this a 2 star item is that the food was very good.  Strangely, the appetizer type items were stronger than many of the rolls.  The two appetizers we had (Tuna Tataki and the Yellowtail) were both very good.  Of the rolls we ordered I would recommend the salmon mango, but the hamachi was disappointing.

we started with miso soup and edamame ( soup so-so...$5, edamame decent ...$5 / bowl )

ordered one of the house specials - yellowtail w/jalepeno ( $20 ) - about 6 slices, very nice 

we also shared a citrus chili infused squid - wow - great balance and very tender squid....i believe it cost about $15...again..decent price for a strip flashy place

SO had the scallop roll and the salmon/avocado handroll ( $5 for the handroll...it was a little on the small side but priced right )  the scallop roll was very good...can't remember the price on it...my guess..a.bout $8-$10

I ordered the citrus miso cod - i tell ya for $22 a good deal - it was a decent sized piece ....vey tasty...came with a fennel slaw...i thought a great contrast...i still give matsuhisa a slight nod on taste but SH gives them a run for the money !!

had 2 foo-foo drinks ...some sort of tequila sunrise type of drink - it had watermelon and rasberrry...a little too sweet for me...$12 and then i had a pineapple mojito...if i had my eyes covered and drank this, i would've guessed it was a standard mojito...i guess putting the pineapple wedge on the glass makes it a pineapple mojito - it was very tasty and definitely tasted the liquor in this one...also $12....

The decor is modern and trendy, as is to be expected of a place trying to market itself to the young and beautiful. The main room looks a little bit crowded and is very loud, but sitting in one of the smaller side rooms is pleasant and comfortable.
The chef worked at Nobu for years, and while his sushi is just slightly above average (nothing bad, but also nothing to write home about), the sake selection and appetizers were by and large very tasty and interesting.

We sampled a wide variety of appetizers, and the garlic-oil seared fluke, whitefish seviche and scallop and giant clam dynamite were truly delicious. Well balanced flavors, first-grade ingredients and great preparation. The salads were fresh and tasty, but nothing new or awe-inspiring. A noodle dish arrived completely overcooked - not only far away from al dente (as it was described by the server), but complete mush.

The service is laid back and casual, maybe a bit too casual at times. While every staff member we met was very friendly and enthusiastic about their food, they definitely seemed to have been hired more for their looks than professional experience. Be prepared to meet some handsome, charming, food-loving kids who sometimes fly a bit by the seat of their pants.

Upon entering, the classy, lounge-like ambiance will attract the eye; sitting at a booth will further the sentiment as you cozy in and enjoy the superb music selection. 

As for the food, outstanding to say the least. The waiter, who was friendly, attentive and gregarious, recommended the spicy peppers as an appetizer (and as an alternative to edamame) and they were delicious. The buttery sauce meshed well with the semi-spicy chilies and made for a light, not-so-filling starter.

We followed with the BBQ eel (grilled maybe, I forget) and the lobster tempura, both of which had a distinct and delectable taste. In general, I enjoy sushi that has some sort of sauce drizzled over it, and both of these had a spicy one, which I appreciated. 

Dessert followed, and we went for the lava cake with Kenyan coffee to accompany it. Good combination and a great finish to an outstanding meal. 

I also had and would recommend the cachaca drink after dinner, it was somewhat like a White Russian but with the distinct taste that cachaca offers. 

Overall, this was an outstanding meal and a great way to splurge in Vegas and not be disappointed. Meal for two with tip cost $180, which was well worth it for the combination of ambiance, service, food and drink.",Np2q37v8xL_r01XJRPfvnA,3,2,4,aaacQnXQo6PH7XqIcvp4Lg

We opted for the prix fixe lunch menu since it seems like the best deal to get. I ordered the seafood ramen, spicy tuna roll, and salad. The bf ordered the loco moco, salmon roll, and salad as well.

Everything was delish!! From the salads to sushi to entrees, everything was very good! I especially liked my seafood ramen. It had a very good broth to it. Hot and flavorful. The loco moco was good as well. Their gravy was good and a good meat patty to their rice.

Service was top notch too. Out waiter was friendly, fast, and very attentive.

I had been craving sushi for a while, so I figured Vegas would be the place to get my fix!  We decided on Social House and both the bf and me were very happy with our pick!

Made a reservation for 6pm (Saturday night), as we had a show to get to by 7:30.  Perfect timing - we were in and out pretty quickly, because we glanced at the menu while waiting at the bar for our table.  The decor is very sexy - the lounge/seating area is parted by a curtain so you forget you're actually in a shopping center.  Instead, whisked away into a dreamland of great food... haha :) 

We shared an appetizer of Shichimi Confit Butter Potatoes, yummm! Then enjoyed 3 of their specialty rolls - Hamachi (with jalapeno/cilantro green sauce and garlic chips), Sun Dried Tomato (vegetarian roll), and a Battera roll with shrimp, spicy tuna and avocado.  (I learned that a Battera roll is layered into a box shape instead of the traditional circular rolls - different and fun!)  Did I just die and go to specialty roll heaven?  Yes, yes I did.

My boyfriend and I rely on the internet. That being said, we went on Social House's website to view the online menu. My boyfriend LOVES sushi and I do not. I saw something that I could get on their menu (chicken dumplings), so I gave in and we went to Social House. We made reservations at 9:00, but showed up at 9:10 and were told that our table wasn't ready yet. We waited at the bar for about 5 minutes or so, walked into the dining area and there is no one in there. There are tons of empty booths. Why did we have to wait? We were not given menus when we were seated and basically stared at each other for another 5 minutes or so before we got our menus. I look at the menu and just my luck, no chicken dumplings are listed. There is absolutely nothing else I liked on the menu. I'm a picky Italian and I love my pasta and that's about it. My boyfriend was also going to get lambchops along with some sushi. The lambchops also were not listed on the menu either, but were listed on the online menu. The waiter said that they did not have the chicken dumplings, but they had something similar to it. They did have the lambchops. So I ordered the ""similiar"" item and my boyfriend ordered sushi along with lambchops. My ""simiar"" item comes out and it was a big bowl filled with curry and chicken meatballs. It looked disgusting. But I was starving so I tried one. It was worst than it looked. I couldn't even go on to take another bite. My boyfriend's lambchops were also drenched in curry...he did not like this either. Why is curry even in this restaurant? The reason for the two star rating is that their online menu is not the same as their menu at the restaurant. If I had known they didn't have any food I liked, we would have gone to Khoi or Sushi Roku (where we've been before and love). We wanted to go somewhere different this time. They need to update their online menu or put a disclaimer. The waiter didn't charge me for the ""chicken meatballs"" after I complained, so they get a star for that. All in all it was a horrible experience, we will not be going back.

The outdoor patio overlooking the strip and Venetian (and pirate show) is spectacular.  Social House probably serves THE best spicy tuna rolls I have ever had.  The toasted sesame seeds inside the rolls were a nice touch and the tuna was uber fresh.  The salmon and cream cheese roll was dee-lish as well.  We tried the adobo chicken roll (one of their house rolls) and sent it back.  I guess warm chicken threw us off and we didn't like the taste of it.  In fact, it was weird.  Prices were reasonable and they had a great wine list.  We will definitely go back the next time we are in Vegas.

As for the service, it was good.  We liked how the waitstaff cleared our 'used' edamame plate frequently and filled our water glasses nonstop.  Our waiter did forget one of our items but hey, everyone forgets things once in a while.

However, the winner for me was the ramen! I was surprised to see it on the HH menu. I asked our waiter about it and he said it was one of his favorite dishes, so for $8 (thank you HH!) I decided to try, with a poached egg in it. WOW so delicious! The broth was flavorful, not overly salty.

**Ramen in Tonkatsu with Pork Belly ($8+$2 for pork belly)  - Portion is small, didn't satisfy my hunger. In the ramen it contained two slices of pork belly which just tasted like regular lame pork. Soup and noodle was not bad, but I definitely had way better ramen. I probably would not get this again.

**Thai Beef Salad ($10) - I thought it's in regular salad style, but it's actually four ""lettuce cups"" (see uploaded picture) . I would prefer regular salad style so I get more lettuce, but lettuce cups are pretty cool and fun to eat too. I really like the flavorful and juicy beef in the salad, and the dressing goes well with it. I believe the non-happy hour price for this salad is almost $20.

**Kobe Sliders ($10) - 2 sliders with shoe string fries. The sliders and fries are both pretty good, but the portion of the fries is comparable to the size of McDonald's small fries. 

The food was decently good but the portion was small. Our bartender was nice and friendly, and the ambiance/atmosphere was nice and cozy. If I ever come back here again, it would only be for their Happy Hour. The domestic beer is only $3 during Happy Hour!",jWCIU5YhqIqNamh7FRrskQ,1,1,3,gLV1EphzlbJfF6cQvymZkw

I was skeptical when her husband asserted, ""The best meal I've ever eaten was at Social House."" Not wanting to be disappointed, I walked in with small expectations, hoping for good sushi and nice atmosphere. When we entered Crystals, which is a high-end shopping mall, I became very skeptical. 

But I forget. This is Vegas; a place that can truly surprise you at every turn with it's ability to take the seemingly ordinary and make it extravagant. Social House's atmosphere was filled with the swanky lighting, decor, and music that you can find only in Sin City.  

We decided to go with the chef's menu. Meaning, the 6 of us dining spouted off things we didn't like (cucumber and salmon) and left the rest to the chef. Course after course came out with each one better than the next. The dishes were perfectly cooked (when applicable), dressed in the best of sauces, and presented beautifully. Yellowtail sashimi, kobe beef sliders, edamame (I know, it seems weak, but it was phenomenal), and a ginormous roll platter. There were several other dishes, but I can't even remember everything! It ran pretty pricey- about $100 per person, but if you're open to trusting the chef and trying a smattering of dishes, it will not disappoint!

This place has a full bar and great sake menu.  It has great intimate lighting and can be loud but that helps keeps the conversation intimate and not have to listen to anyone else.

Edamame - half was salted, the other drizzled with miso sauce (I think)

Yellowtail sashimi - pretty good. The crispy jalapeño gave it a good texture (not spicy)

Roasted eggplants - delicious! Great side dish.

Miso cod - AMAZING!!!! Flavors were so good. Cod was perfectly flakey and so moist. I would come back to eat this again.

I have seen this place several times during my stays in Vegas. Each time something came up and I was unable to try them out. Well not this time. 

The Social House does not disappoint. Keep in mind that you are not going here to gorge yourself to death. More specifically you are coming here to come out of your comfort zone and give your taste buds a work out. 

I had some sashimi that was absolutely amazing. I will dream about it, I will crave it. I even had raw salmon and LOVED IT.

I also had the thai beef lettuce wraps. I would probably not order them again, but they were good. 

I ended with coconut donuts holes. I pretty much despise coconut, specifically that banana boat tasting fake coconut taste. This did not have that taste. In addition the ball was crunchy on the outside and warm soft goodness in the middle. A fantastic way to end the dinner. 

Also, they DO HAVE Kaliber (I know such a whatever to be in Vegas and not drinking...I think it is more of a whatever to be offered O'duals everywhere I go). Huge plus in my book.

The atmosphere is nice with dark woods and interesting decor with straight lines and low lighting.

I would for sure come back here. I would probably not leave it up to the server to pick stuff out for me (now that I have a better understanding of menu).

Lastly, this place is EXPENSIVE...about a hundred bucks a person if you are really going to go for it. Yes you can do it for cheaper than that, but I guess you get what you pay for.",my2QdiHb5c9i67otCSL-bA,3,2,4,GOdz3DTR5YpiXnmzhZhNRA

I am ashamed to admit that I wasn't really familiar with those words (or at least the first one) before coming to Social House during a recent trip to Vegas, but now I will never forget. 

See, you fine Yelpers had told me that this place has a pretty bitchin' lunch special, and my fiance and I really dig Japanese food so we decided to check it out. The first thing we noticed is that the atmosphere in here is awesome: hip but comforting. Nice. We were seated quickly and got our orders in for the lunch special. While we waited for the courses to arrive, I sipped on a sake flight. Three generous pours for $20 is definitely not bad for Vegas, even if one was Ty-Ku. (Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that I can already get that one in Utah.) All the selections were rather pleasant and complimentary. 

Salad came first, and mine was the cucumber type while my fiance's was more of the usual type. Definitely a fresh and tasty way to start. But next came the star of our show, big bowls of rich, delicious pork bone broth, generous cuts of pork, tasty noodles, and even some egg (to make it even more decadent). It was accompanied by a bowl of garlic and other spices that we dumped in, and that really kicked it up a notch. I don't have anything to compare it to, but the flavor was just amazing. I was full, but yet I couldn't stop eating. It put me in a happy place. 

After that, the sushi rolls arrived. Did I mention that I was already full? I got the salmon and avocado roll and my fiance got the spicy tuna roll. We tried a little of each and were impressed by the quality of the fish. Very nice flavors. Unfortunately, it was just too much food and we weren't quite able to finish it. Not bad for $25 a piece. 

The place was pretty empty by the end of our meal (it was a late lunch on a Monday), so we sat and sipped some tea for a bit. They have quite a good selections if you're into that sort of thing. We had one of the oolongs, which had a wonderful aroma and a nice, mellow flavor. 

I'll definitely be back here the next time I'm in town. I just wonder how long it'll be before I try something other than the ramen. That's the problem with not having this place closer.",Wo_ASbM3pzJ4r1Qf6CcNOA,3,4,5,hQ0W469P_sKKb2qESTBySQ

Ever since I went to Social House, I certainly changed my mind about going to Koi again!  

My girl friend and I went to Social House last Saturday a little before 5, before the restaurant opened for dinner.  The host was very friendly and informed us that the restaurant was not opened for dinner yet.  My girl friend and I each had a a cocktail while we waited.  Wow! I loved their ""Socialite"" cocktail and my girlfriend was amazed by their ""lycheetini"".  Both drinks were incredible!! This definitely gave us a boost of confidence about the meal we were about to have. 

When it was time for dinner we picked a bottle of sparkling sake called ""hana awaka""....it was sincerely the best sparkling sake we've ever had.  It was a little pricey (then again, what's not pricey in Vegas?) but it was definitely an amazing experience to try something new! 

The food, oh the food was just so incredible.  My favorites were hamachi jalapeno, hamachi tartar, miso cod lettuce cups, and uni.  All of the dishes have nice portion since it's meant to be shared, which I thought was a great concept!  The food was just so fresh and nicely flavored we actually ordered some dishes again!  My girl friend and I were definitely in sushi heaven.  

Everyone in the restaurant were extremely friendly and seemed genuinely happy to be working there.  The manager came to ask us twice to see if we were satisfied with the food and if we were having a good time.  My water never went below half empty as the water and busboy constantly refills it as soon as I drank some.  For someone who drinks a lot of water with my meal and so I'm constantly asking for more water, this is a huge plus for me.   

The ambiance was amazing.  We enjoyed the trendy music but it was not too loud we couldn't hear our own conversation. 

Overall, we had an incredible experience dining at social house.  It was such a fantastic meal my girl friend and I were still talking about it half an house after we walked out of the restaurant!

The ambiance inside the restaurant was cozy, up-scale Asian, but most of that falls flat when half the restaurant is an open veranda looking out on a Mall. We sat right by the Mason-Dixon line between upscale, fresh restaurant and Mall sterility and it killed it for me.

Pan Seared Sea Scallops, Nasu Miso, Curry Emulsion ($36)
- 5 inky dinky little pieces of scallops plopped on top of pieces of eggplant
- a layer of foam on top of the scallops

Shrimp Tempure with Sweet Sesame and Spicy Ponzu Sauce ($20)
- of all the dishes, this is the most worth paying for
- it can probably fill a child aged 9-12 up
+ the sweet sesame sauce is the tastier sauce of the two. it is sweet and tastes like whipped mayonaise

Sweet Chili Chicken Wings $15
- KFC, Popeyes, and Ralphs fried chicken wings tastes ten times better at a fraction of the price

Lychee Beignets (Lychee Fritters, Strawberry/Vanilla Sorbet, Vanilla Sauce) $11
- warm tiny doughnut holes filled with sweet creamy filling that tastes a little off key
- it's suppose to taste like lychee, but it really didn't, moreso of vanilla gone bad

There are definitely much better Asian Fusion restaurants out there (i.e. Tao Restaurant), so prevent the hole in your pocket and don't come here, unless you absolutely don't care because have lotsa, LOTSA mooolah to burn.

The food, the drinks, and the setup (including that amazing balcony/patio) made Social House THE must-visit place, despite its location inside the otherwise useless Treasure Island Hotel.

But then they closed.  (Bad!)
Then I was told they are reopening somewhere else. (Good!)

Well, on this last visit to Vegas, I had told Mr. K that I'd like to visit the new location, and together with a couple of friends, we visited Social House, now located inside the TRULY IMPRESSIVE Crystals City Center (which wasn't even there on my last visit to Sin City).  

Walking in, I noted that they carried over the same modern/hip theme.  The bar/lounge area was just as nice, and very similar in feel.  We took seats at the bar and ordered some appetizers and drinks off of their happy hour menu.  One friend had the sliders, which I didn't try, but I ordered the tempura-like shrimp, which was quite tasty. 

The general manager was kind enough to give us a whole tour of the restaurant, and it was -ALMOST- as nice as the old location.  OK - I'm lying; it was really nice but not really as nice as the old location, where the two floors simply knocked my socks off.  Similar to their old location, they did include a patio dining area, but it's not really a patio when you're just overlooking the rest of the fantastic Crystals City Center (indoors). 

Because we had a fancy dinner planned for that evening, we couldn't sit down and actually have a meal at Social House, which was always SH's selling point in the old location.  But the GM did invite us back to try their ""amazing coffee"", so we promised that we'd be back after dinner for dessert.

Despite having had dessert after an amazing dinner - we promised, and we delivered by running back to Social House for their coffee.  I believe the coffee was $14 (gasp?) but Mr K and I took a seat at the lounge and waited patiently through the brewing process (which was rather fascinating).  A long time ago, I had come to Social House to have their ""dough balls"" which still remain in my mind as one of the best desserts ever.  I was thrilled to find that it was still on the menu, so of course, I had to beg that we have ""one more dessert""!  I did note that it was now called ""Lychee Dough Balls""; that should have been my first hint.

The coffee was spectacular, as promised.  After dinner at SH, you must try their coffee.
Their dough balls???  WHAT WAS THAT?
I had one and could touch no more, but it was dough balls filled with a lychee gel or concoction of some sort -  and it would ooze on the first bite.  While I am a big fan of anything that oozes - - this was just a bad, bad combination.

Bring back the old dough balls!  Why mess with perfection???  It used to go perfectly with the coffee!

In the end, I don't feel like it's equal to the old Social House for several reasons, and have to dock it a star.  But Social House is STILL one of the hippest joints in Las Vegas, and for excellent Japanese fusion, you MUST try this place!",_pIG1_s6Bzymn1zeyLjBHQ,4,4,4,TluDTLf6CnqkkQUr6bcIbA

The things that stood out on the menu were some Filipino dishes that you're not used to seeing at any restaurant that serves sushi.  According to the waiter, the head chef is a Filipino guy.  The waiter did a very good job selling the stuff to us, but as a Filipino, I certainly knew better than to pay $18 for six pieces of lumpia, or $20 for some pancit.  I'm sure the chef cooks them well, but those two dishes should never cost that much unless you have enough to feed an army.  Most of what we ordered was less than memorable and what really stood out were the steaks.  The filet came out rare and the ribeye came medium rare.  Both were amazing!  I'd go back and order just those.

This is a great place to get sushi for lunch or dinner. The outside area where the bar is located is casual and great for a quick lunch.  It is located inside crystals mall so it is also great for people watching.

July 2, 2009  Las Vegas, Nev.  Today, PURE Management Group (PMG) announces that on Sunday, July 5 it will close its innovative sushi restaurant, Social House inside Treasure Island in order to concentrate on negotiations for a new location on the Las Vegas Strip for the popular restaurant concept. 

Since August 2006, Social House developed a solid reputation and loyal following for its delectable cuisine, unrivaled décor and exuberant vibe. Executive Chef Joe Elevado created a masterpiece menu of Pan Asian cuisine and sushi, relying on an eclectic blend of Asian tastes prepared with the freshest ingredients and a keen eye for presentation. 

During the interim period Social House employees are being provided with employment in other PMG venues. In the interim, Joe Elevado is tasked with the further development of the Social House brand. PMG will continue to operate Christian Audigier The Nightclub also located in Treasure Island.

1983887,2009-01-25,1,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"Went here for dinner, and I must say I was quite impressed.

First of all they were having a 2 for 1 deal on a few drinks, and the Ginger Saketini was AMAZING.  I didn't taste the alcohol and they used real ginger (although annoying to find pieces of ginger float into your mouth while drinking, it added that special punch to the drink).  I had two of those and was feeling pretty buzzed quickly. 

We sat outside on the terrace, and from where we sat you can watch the Sirens of Treasure Island show.  All I can say is after enduring one of those shows, you dont want to stick around for the one in the next hour to witness that again.

Onto the food.  I ordered the Tocino BBQ babyback ribs.  When it arrived, I hate to admit, but I was disappointed there was no rice, so I ordered that on the side.  Totally filipino I know.  I was skeptical looking at my ribs because I had a feeling the meat would be stuck to the bone and I'd have to use my hands to eat it.  So i picked at it a little with my fork gauging if it was going to be tough to get it off the bone.  I was definitely wrong.  The meat peeled away with such ease, and when eating it, oh man, it just melts in your mouth!  It was soo good!  There were chunks of something around the ribs, and I wasn't sure what it was.  It looked like mango, but it wasn't.  Turned out they were pickled beets.  Not really my thing, but my friends definitely enjoyed it.  

I also had some of my friends Cod, and that also melted in my mouth, so so good.  OH and the seaweed salad.  That's really stuff that's generally good, but for some reason at Social House it tasted like the best seaweed salad I had ever encountered!  Very good!

Next time I'm in Vegas I think I'll convince my family to dine here once. :)  It's definitely worth a trip back.",tB_88H8UbEki6tcthaXZcg,1,1,4,Bxv5TMl2jh8sziUsehh_VA

I actually found the soybeans pretty tough to get out of the pod, so I'm thinking maybe they were not cooked enough?  My husband had some sort of peppers for an appetizer.  Again, just ok.  Now...the sushi...fabulous!!!  We ordered 3 rolls and everything was superb!  The angry tuna roll is a must try!  If I were still hungry, I would have ordered more!  It was that good!

I didn't know if we had to order from the happy hour menu and the hostess tells us- nope, you can order from both if you want.  Terrific!!

We get there and Robert sees us and greets us- how nice to remember us from last time!

1. Japanese Bellini (from the happy hour menu)

We didn't get a chance to meet Michael last time we were in, and Rob brought him over and introduced us.  Both are very nice gentlemen!  They asked if they could try out a new drink they are working on.  Us turn down alcohol?!  NEVER!

It was a splash of cranberry, lemongrass and ginger cocktail.  It was very light tasting and something that you would totally expect a Japanese restaurant to have.  My mom sucked down the entire thing- she's a fan! :)

We then decided to go for the gusto and ordered:

3. Social House Ultimate Roll (from the regular dinner menu-$40)
King Crab, Seared Kobe Beef Tenderloin, Lobster, Seared Scallop, Spicy Tuna, Avocado, Cucumber, White Truffle Oil

Sesame Kelp Salad - Good, but nothing special.  Not that different from seaweed salads elsewhere.  

Yellowtail Sashimi - This was by far the best dish we had that night.  Flavorful and delicate with a nice citrus/soy kick.  The fish was the perfect temperature and it all just melded together brilliantly.

Seared Albacore Roll - Very good as well.  Great blend of flavors but similar to other really good rolls out there.  

Soft Shell Crab Roll - I really liked this one because of the extra crunchiness of the crab.  Maybe they overcooked it slightly because there was also a smokey flavor to the crab, which was really nice.  The contrast of textures really played well together.

Order of Tuna Nigiri - Quality tuna and very tasty.

Order of Shrimp Nigiri - Pretty standard but still good.

The Skinny: decided underwhelming dishes with very little flavour or complexity (2) service: understaffed, there was only 1 waiter available to take orders from two separate rooms (2), value: there is no value for overpriced, slightly above mediocre food (2).

When we stopped by after seeing that they had tonkotsu ramen on the menu during their happy hour.

The hostess promptly seated us at 7:30 pm and just gave us drink menus. This is despite knowing  we were interested in their happy hour and wanted to try their bar menu. 8 minutes later, someone comes by and gives us a menu -  not the bar menu but their dinner menu. Finally we get their bar menu to peruse (it wasn't available on the internet because we checked) after we specifically ask for it about 5 minutes later.

We did notice that there was only one waiter at the time running between rooms and they were understaffed. One of the service staff (not our waiter) did come by and apologize for the service.

We ordered the pulled beef fries with green onion and wasabi cream ($5), tonkotsu ramen with bamboo shoots, green onion ($8) plus the pork belly ($2, four slices), and a serving of their cod slider ($4).

First of all, a package of ramen you get at the Chinese supermarket is markedly superior to what they serve here. It's an insult to call the swill they serve here tonkotsu ramen - it completely lacked the full bodied flavour of pork. The noodles were overdone, the preserved bamboo had an unpleasant rank aroma. It was terrible all the way through. The addition of the anemic bland pork belly did the dish no favors.

The cod slider fared better but was still very unsatisfying. The fried cod lack crispness while it was definitely overwhelmed by the mayonaise-y tartar sauce. When they listed this as being bar ""bites"", they weren't kidding - the sammy was small. Quite frankly, a filet-o-fish would had been preferable and easier on the wallet.

Finally, the pulled beef fries. The pulled beef short rib was one-note while the wasabi cream... didn't taste at all like wasabi. The gravy was also overly watery which made the so-so fries get soggy too quickly.

Given how this place performed during their happy hour, I would not consider trying Social House again. This place is barely edible and expensive to boot. Given the plethora of other great places to try on the Strip, this is definitely a pass. 2 stars.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,2,2,-n8U3O2NCHIIhACnQvVPnw

We were looking for a sushi place, and the sushi restaurant at the Cosmopolitan (where we were staying) wasn't open until 5:30PM, so I searched for another place and Social House came up right across the street, so we figured we would check it out.  I reserved a table for four on open table.com, which was incredibly easy to do from the yelp.com app on my phone.  Once we arrived, we were seated promptly.  We must have arrived at the perfect time, because the chefs were literally just starting to cut up the fish, so everything was SUPER fresh.  The staff was friendly and respectful.  The only set back was that the food took a little while to come out and our food all came out at different times, which may have been because they were still cutting up the fish, but I'm not sure.  Either way, I would definitely visit this place again.  The decor was dim and romantic, but not too ""date-night"" for a group of friends.",L5DOdLNaNiqFxeB-lZDlWg,3,3,5,XOzmoMYJ8z3Mi8jeDY8quQ

The Social House is located inside the posh Crystals City Center mall on the Strip, and there was more than enough class and sass (and a little bit of poser trash) present during our dinner. The interior was absolutely gorgeous, with creative chandelier fixtures and beautiful wall art. Their dishes are meant to be shared, but I had a couple of dishes that I definitely wanted to keep to myself...they were just that good. First, I had some lovely Classic Cucumber Saketini. It was great; not too sweet, and absolutely refreshing. I chose a couple of small plates, including the salmon tartare, crispy tofu, and kobe sushi. They were all quite delicious, although my absolute favorite was the tartare. It was just so fresh, and well-seasoned, and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. There are a lot of upscale dining experiences in Las Vegas, and even more ""bang for your buck"" restaurants that can make one's head explode. This is definitely the former, and a estimable option at that.",Bv9C6zi0qmBXfJkO42iRAA,3,3,4,pdgXrcxnOUWRGz4L1Z_-rA

2192404,2012-07-10,17,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"I believe that good ramen can cure most any non-communicable disease related ailments, and great ramen can entirely change your day. The bowl I had at Social House lies somewhere in between, but considering it's found in a strange land where such simple pleasures are hard to find I found it worthy of extremely high praise. I cannot say that I tried any other dishes here, as unfortunately on the day I visited they weren't offering the lunch special that's available during the week which includes 2 other courses in addition to the ramen, however, this one bowl was enough for me to lock Social House in as a regular stop when visiting Vegas.

My service was also exemplary here, which isn't an easy task considering I sat at the bar and only had one item to eat, but Jonah managed to do his best to keep me from dozing off and winding up with noodles on my face at 1 in the afternoon. Yeah, long night watching the sun come up, although thankfully I wasn't stuck out at the Vegas Motor Speedway like my friends who attended that night's EDC event, which was shut down due to wind, trapping everyone in an ecstasy induced frenzy for a few hours. From what I heard though the Steve Aoki protest set was pretty memorable and well worth the headaches. Jonah seemed to know all the blondes who looked like they had just left a ""Peepshow"" audition by name and typical menu orders as they strolled in, so clearly the guy is doing something right.

But, back to the ramen. It's about $17 for a bowl with pork belly and tonkatsu broth, and I think slightly cheaper if you want the seafood or miso versions...pricey, but what here isn't? I definitely recommend the pork belly though, even if you're vegetarian, because it's Vegas and whatnot, so if you can cheat on your husband you can cheat on your diet (and it might help take your mind off all the meat you had in your face at Thunder Down Under, which you just know your ""best friend"" Orphelium has photos of and will be eagerly awaiting the next time you forget to return her organic sewing kit to accidentally break them out in front of Thadly). The pork in this bowl is quite plentiful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g?select=nHoa4e7h9Fe8ocEHkMI44w#-PhxZpR8PqXM_IFuzOupXg), and after a minute or two of soaking in the steaming broth it's extremely delicate and easy to dice up with your chop sticks. The broth itself has a good bit of depth as well, but I highly recommend dumping the entire side portion of pepper and spices and crispy garlic in for added flavor. By the time I got to the bottom of the bowl there was a really nice subtle burn going on in my mouth, exactly the thing I needed to get the day started in the right direction.

The setting here is pretty sexy (it's located inside the super luxurious Crystals mall), in a bold and brooding teahouse sort of way, and while those ideas may seem rather juxtaposed, I promise it works. I would love to return to Social House for a full course dinner meal, if this ramen is any indication, but for the time being I'm content in knowing I found what is likely one of the only places, and quite possibly the best, to offer up one of my favorite post-drinking-night cravings.",hpw7UrWf51aaWKbaGGJ2hA,16,15,5,5SbvQt8ZgOqJYaBnV0SCeg
2194067,2011-11-22,3,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"I went to Social House when it was still at Treasure Island!!! I went for my 21st birthday with a large group. Although I had made a reservation and specified the balcony, we still had to wait a good 15 minutes before a table was made available for us... so boo to that. One of my friends actually had a very stern chat with the GM since they were acting as if they weren't going to give it to us. Because we were a group of hot girls mostly (my bf at the time was with us) we were seated right next to the window on the balcony to watch the Pirate show. I loved that they did that for us since watching the show was awesome! The boat went right by us and we got to watch the show as we ate. Hot seamen 12 o'clock! For my first time in Vegas being of legal age to drink, this was definitely one of those experiences that left a lasting impression and fun memory.

Social House itself is very overpriced, if you could not determine that form the menu yourself. Six dollars for a tiny cup of miso soup?! No. Just, no. 

I think I was alcohol poisoned by this point in time on my trip because I really couldn't eat anything. My stomach was hurting all throughout with a sharp intense stinging pain and I could barely move the entire weekend. I guess that's what I get for drinking excessive amounts of alcohol for 5 nights straight before heading to Vegas... whoops. Because of this, I only ordered a miso soup and 2 orders of sushi... one being salmon. It was good but not great. Certainly not worth the amount they charged.  If I wasn't paying for it I might have enjoyed it more haha. My friends all enjoyed their meals. I remember that people loved the black miso cod entree so I hope they still have this as an option at their new location at City Center.

So yes, it was my birthday. I looked good (as you can see in my photo) and besides the small stint in the bathroom where my friend and I refunded our soup in the middle of dinner, I had a great time there. Ok so maybe that was TMI... but deal with it. You've read worse.

I will miss this location.... if only for the TI pirate show and the beautiful gold box wall in the entrance- it was great to take pictures in front of! I look forward to one day trying out Social House at its new home but it will have to be for a special occasion.

First planned stop was American Fish for happy hour but... closed!  Second planned stop was Sage and... closed!  Bar Masa also closed! Dammit!

We started to lose faith and I nonchalantly suggested Social House in Crystals because we had never been there.  If the menu didn't appeal, at least we could have a Sapporo at the bar and re-think our strategy.  

I was expecting something akin to Kona Grill... typical sushi but nothing to write home about.  I was so wrong.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  The friendly bartender gave us menus and we discovered that they actually have pretty decent cocktails!

I had the Socialite ($14) which is spiced rum, passion fruit juice, orange juice, and serrano chili.  I didn't really taste the chili, but it was all good because it was yummy!

My husband had the Cachaca Espuma ($16) which is cachaca (fermented sugar cane), lime, green tea, and a vanilla/coconut foam (referred to as espuma).  The bartender grated a little lime peel on top.  I'm not a big fan of coconut and the smell was pretty strong but my husband made a dent in the foam so I could try the drink below without gagging and it was pretty good!

For food, we tried the yellowtail with crispy jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro (just like the microchives that used to be on everything a few years back), and calamansi soy ($22).  I think calamansi is a type of citrus fruit but I didn't ask.  This is excellent!  The crispy jalapeno adds good texture and is different than just having fresh or pickled jalapeno tossed on top.  And the garlic dust!  Everything should be covered in garlic dust!  Awesome idea!

We also tried the crispy pata which is a crackling pork shank with pickled carrots and garlic served with a chili vinegar on the side ($24).  The vinegar is very strong, and they warned us of that, so you only dip the pork in a little bit.  The pork shank has both crispy skin and tender meat.  Also the bones have some tasty bone marrow inside so get a chopstick and fish it out!  Yummy dish!

These are smallish portions but high quality food... perfect for a foodie crawl.  The bartender and servers are willing to spend time talking to you about your likes and dislikes and develop a tasting menu on the fly for you, which is pretty cool!

Edamame to start and ""Star Rabbit"" sake, a fruity one that sounded different, curry rice, and chilled seaweed salad to start, add to that another bottle of sake and some house sushimi special with chili and mint finished with soft shell crab roll. Everything ordered tasted grand and we were not even the least bit upset by the $$$$ we ended spending.  Taste was excellent, very surprised!!!",DGszSnRNWoAOtD8WGf9wpg,1,1,5,zrHVSHRPWucCLPHkbxEDqQ

Mothra Japanese Bellini $9 4/5 - I think it is lychee liquor + champagne.  I liked it but I don't think I will order it again but my friend really liked it..
Hot Sake $8 - Very decent size.  about 1/3 more than Japonais @mirage.
Lychee sake $12 the cup was cold too (which not that many places in Las Vegas do that, even 5-star hotel =() - my friend said he could feel the alcohol as he drinks along.
Thai Beef Salad (Skirt Steak, Bibb Lettuce, Onion, Tomato, Spicy Dressing) $10 - we ordered it because the reviews said it has 4 lettuce cups (otherwise I would have ordered the Cod Bibb lettuce cups) - The beef was decent quality too. 
Ramen Noodles $8 + Pork Belly $2 + poached egg $1 5/5 - star of the meal.  I didn't have high hopes after spending a few days in Las Vegas.  Everything seemed to be tourist traps.  I liked the tonkatsu more than miso.  Miso was too salty for me.  I wasn't sure if the ramen was from the supermarket package but it was still good.  Even better than some of the ramen shops in Vancouver. 
KALBI BEEF ROLL (Crispy Kalbi Beef, Negi, Sesame, Kochujuang Sauce) $7 - crispy roll but it wasn't deep fried.  it had more filling than Japonais.",dJa6Pn01nUMxvUIfEthw5Q,1,1,4,QOo9KeYD8cZ1fNcIctJMJQ

According to a Yelper this was the best time to order the Omakase, so the chefs could go crazy and get creative. Omakase it was. I told our server that I can't have any thing breaded or with flour because I am gluten intolerant and will get sick. Note this for later in the review and what bumped them down to two stars. 

The first three courses were great, really inventive and good flavor. The 4th course was a very nicely prepared, but very typical miso black cod and not something I would expect on their ""chef's choice creation"" menu. The next dish was a pork dish and the pork was a bit dry. Flavor was a bit bland. Then the ""sushi"" course was truly disappointing. Usually one orders the omakase expecting some inventive stuff. This was just a plate of salmon sushi, yellowtail sushi, tuna sushi, red snapper sushi, and some other fish. No special anything. Just a piece of fish on the rice. 

Then came dessert. Tres leches CAKE. With flour. I told the server that I couldn't eat it and they replaced it with a mango pudding. 

Our server was super nice, but at times was a bit slow coming by our table, etc. It wasn't even that busy so I can't really let that slide either. 

Overall really over priced for the mediocrity that its food was. Service was middle of the road, but a big ding for them by serving me a glutenous dessert.",OXKq9yoImxPbK48FHLo69w,1,0,2,Ysy-M90fXs4oLmIWnyheWQ

I saw a small sushi bar open and asked the hostess how long the wait was, and to my surprise she said they had tables free, all upstairs.  Whoa...they have an upstairs?  Being completely blinded by the glitz and glam of Vegas, i didn't' realize that this was a full blow restaurant.

The walk up the staircase to the main dining areas makes you feel like you're in a bank, as golden safety deposit boxes surround you.  The Asian decor when you hit the rooms is very subtle in some rooms, and very traditional in others.  The atmosphere is really fitting for the name of the place.  Things get really lively too if you get the outdoor patio seating that overlooks the strip.

The food is absolutely awesome here.  If you're picky about sushi, get whatever they have that's fresh here.  The ahi and hamachi were fabulous, and the salmon excellent.  Flown in all the way from Japan overnight, we got lucky with our batch of sashimi.  however the hidden gem are the mini-Kobe Beef sliders.  OMG, heaven on a King-Hawaiian roll.  The flavor,the texture, the taste.......ecstasy on the tongue I tell you (OK....that could've been put differently, but let's move on).  

If you need a buzz and want some exotic tastes in liquid form, they offer so many different types of sakes that you won't find at your regular sushi bar down the street.  There's over fifteen unique ones and if I had more time, I'd have tried them all.

So, I ordered the Tonkotsu Ramen for $8 and the Angry Tuna Roll. Both were packed with flavor and super tasty.

2493447,2008-11-07,1,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"Social House is Asian fusion and when my Asian parents hear the word fusion, they make a little grimace face. They're old school. They don't do fusion. But we found out they had Ishiyaki on their menu, so that got my dad excited. Ishiyaki is a style of cooking where you cook meats, fish, veggies, etc. on hot stones. 

However, when the stone came out, it wasn't a stone, it was a ceramic-looking grill plate. So my dad asks suspiciously, ""Is that a stone?"" And the pretty boy waiter smiles and says ""yes,"" but in the way of ""yes, I don't really know anything so please don't ask me any more questions."" It doesn't look like a stone, so my dad keeps asking. My mom and I wrangle my dad in so we can start eating (we're also there with other people and don't want to make a stink) and tell him ""it's ok, it's a stone""...as we all look at the grill plate. I later found out on the internet that most ishiyaki nowadays is not done with natural stone but with a man-made stone composed of minerals that can keep the stone hot for a lengthy amount of time. Some of the stones actually look like real stones, but others look like the grill plate we saw. It would have been nice if the waiter could have explained that to us instead of just smiling and looking like he was lying to us (for all he knew, he was).

Food:

We ordered a couple of meat & veggies and seafood & veggies plates to cook on the ""ishiyaki"", as well as miso soup and rice. Everyone thought the miso soup was pretty good. The rice, according to my mom the rice connoisseur, was not. Of the three dips that came with the Ishiyaki dishes we thought only the miso-based one was ok. The kobe beef that came out was good as were the other grilling foods. Since we did our own cooking, I can't say how the rest of the other menu items are.

We ordered the mochi ice cream for dessert. One order came with 3 unique flavors. I forget what they are but the lychii was the best one.

Service:

Service was slow, slightly snotty and only partially attentive. We asked for extra chopsticks after the grill items arrived to use them for cooking (it's a sanitary thing) but our waitstaff forgot about it (and were nowhere to be found) until we were almost done with dinner so everyone one just flipped their chopsticks back and forth for cooking vs. eating. Another thing is that they brought our dessert out as the Treasure Island show was starting. They encouraged us to get up and get closer to watch it, but our desserts were left on the table melting the whole time. It would have been nice if they took it back to the freezer while we were watching the show but they didn't.

Verdict:

While I think the people we were with might come back, I'm pretty sure my parents (fusion-haters) would not come back, especially since it wasn't the authentic ishiyaki they were imagining. As for me, I doubt I'd come back either. It's a little too hipsterish a place and I didn't like the vibe or the service enough to return. There's so many restaurants in Las Vegas, I would be more interested in trying a different one instead.",kswbpegMVDNCaTW3MaBB_Q,1,1,3,sz5m_5FLDeY6EgU-QrWsCA

This is probably one of the worst places I've been to.

Also don't expect any chef specials because of the clientele of the patrons who frequent this place (haole's, first timers, ""rolls/california roll"" type of diners), they don't have anything out of the ordinary or even typical items of a real Japanese restaurant. Instead its the bare basics.

The interior was really nice, but it's probably the only thing it has going for itself because the service sucked too.

I particularly enjoyed the Social House roll and the Lobster Tempura roll.  I also enjoyed the sashimi assortment (but not the scallops).

The part that I don't get is that this is raw fish wrapped in rice.  Maybe my palette just is not developed enough, but I can't really tell the difference - once wrapped in rice with a sauce on top - between a piece of tuna here and a piece at the takeout sushi joint by my house.  Except for the fact that our party of five spent $250 more for dinner here and only one of us drank.

2709816,2013-11-08,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"My husband and I eloped in Vegas last weekend, having our wedding at the Aria. As part of our wedding package, we were given dinner at Social House immediately following our wedding ceremony.

We arrived at ten pm on a Saturday night only to learn that they had the days mixed up and they had been expecting us the previous night. It wasn't a big deal though, as the restaurant was absolutely dead. There were maybe only two other tables being used. The bar was empty.

We were expecting something special for our wedding dinner, but the server didn't even mention it. He gave us a sheet with two options for our prix fixe menu. 

Again, we were surprised that the menu didn't even look nice. It was just on a standard sheet of paper, nothing mentioning weddings or special events. It would have been very easy and cheap to make this a little extra nice. The server wasn't even aware of our options and had to look at the menu with us. We could't tell if he was just new or totally indifferent.

We went with the first option, which was seven courses. I can't remember all of the courses, but it  included a big variety. The sushi was okay and I liked the mixed- green salad. The miso cod was awful. We both took one bite and pushed it aside. I also didn't care for the pork buns, which were a fancy version of a cheap dish that I always get in Chinatown. We liked the pineapple cake for dessert.

Our meal included two small bottles of a floral sake wine for a toast. We ended up ordering more alcohol and with tip, spent close to a hundred dollars. I have no clue what the actual value of our meal was, however, I would have preferred to have been given a dollar amount and ordered off of the regular menu. We would have rather had some sushi of our own choosing. The courses that we ate were really hit and miss. Nothing was outstanding.

Besides the complete lack of acknowledging our special event ( especially since our dinner was arranged through the wedding chapel as part of their package), the service was spotty. At one point, three courses came out at the same time and often our drinks were left unfilled. Our server would disappear and another employee would have to track him down. It happened twice.

2787061,2010-10-20,5,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"So let me explain . . . 

Lynn & I are once again in Las Vegas for et another DUI conference.  I know, I know -- it's either Vegas or New Orleans, but hey! both cities know how to drink!  Anyway, after several nights of excellent but ""fancy"" food, we were thinking something light and Japanese came to mind.  The problem is, we're staying at the Death Ray -- sorry, the Vdara -- and there are no restaurants per se in the hotel, and the Japanese restaurants nearby in the Bellagio or the Aria don't open until dinner.  BUT . . . there is this place called ""Social Hall"" that opens at 1:00 pm on Friday, so --

Now 1:00 in the afternoon is a DIFFERENT CLIENTELE than a nightclub/bar/restaurant into the evening . . . all we really wanted was some lunch.  So readers would be well advised to a) take this review with a grain of salt, and b) understand it is a review of this establishment for LUNCH, in contrast to the overwhelming number of other reviews in which more sensible Yelpers than I went during the evening hours.

No complaints about the food.  It wasn't a ""Wow!"" but we sort of weren't expecting it to be.  The kitchen was out of some things -- I guess they weren't expecting people to eat lunch (but then why open for lunch?), as we were repeated told that a particular dish ""isn't ready yet.  It will be ready for dinner.""  Uh, OK, but why open of lunch?  The Bento box was fine; the sushi was good.  But overall it seemed to lack that certain *spark* that elevates it above the ordinary.  

The waitress was simply not interested in us or in our needs.  Water glasses went unfilled.  She never asked us if we wanted to order more sake.  And it took forever to get the check.

And the pulsating techno music at 1:00 in the afternoon gets tiresome by about 1:10.

HOWEVER . . . in a move that is VERY unusual for Las Vegas, someone in this place truly cares about coffee!  They have a beautiful Hario siphon setup, complete with halogen heaters, plus a La Marzocco 3-group Linea and three Mazzer grinders for espresso.  The Ethipoian Harrar siphon coffee we enjoyed was superb!  Bonus points for that alone!  

If I were here for dinner, or if I were clubbing, well, I can certainly understand this place getting 4+ stars in reviews.  But I will probably take a pass on this place for lunch . . . unless it's just to duck in for some truly wonderful coffee.",BhwaJuqrwt_Stlf4XndzzQ,1,1,2,rK_UJXFfX7tgjYpguPrN5Q
2798930,2011-02-20,1,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"I was in a bad mood after a crappy week at work. But dinner at Social House turned my mood around in a hurry. Four of us headed out on a Friday night to get some sushi and decided to stop here. We never had the chance to check out Social House when it was located at Treasure Island, but were glad it was able to open elsewhere because the food was amazing.

There wasn't a bad dish among the ones we tried. Some of the standouts include the yellowtail with crispy jalapeño, salmon with wasabi creme fraiche, citrus peel miso cod on bibb lettuce cups, the tamarind short ribs, and the seared albacore with spicy tuna, shrimp tempura and avocado specialty roll. If you go, I would highly recommend any or all of those.

If you're turned off by modern/fusion Japanese cuisine this isn't the place for you. While they do offer traditional nigiri and sashimi, the menu is filled with items and ingredients that have an Indian, Filipino, and southeast Asian spin to them. The executive chef, Joe Elevado, is a former Nobu chef so you can expect that same Nobu level of creativity and execution.

The location isn't the best -- inside Crystals where there's very little foot traffic. There's no need to make reservations before 8 or 9 because the place was dead. When we got there at 6:30 there was only one or two other tables that were occupied. The interior is long and narrow with a modern and sleek Japanese feel. There are several intimate and cool spots to eat, like the row of booths running down the center of the room that provides a spot to see and be seen (if there were more patrons).

As with all places on the Strip, expect to pay a premium. Social House may not be outrageously expensive, but it isn't cheap. We spent about $95 a person for 10 dishes, wine, beer, tax and tip.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,3,3,5,TXMOOlqTQAR9224yv4PonQ

The kobe beef sliders were reminiscent of typical diner fare, of course with a Las Vegas twist. We only stopped in for a bite, so I wish I could have sampled more sushi and sake. Desserts looked grand, from what I saw on the table of the couple next to us, which brings me to another negative point: the table spacing lacked elbow room. I felt like I was all up in the business of the couple next to us.

Kobe Beef sliders with Onion rings (Mom ordered this)

Warm Chocolate cake - molten on the inside, anyone familiar with Finale in Boston, this dessert rivals Finale's, who has it perfect.
Outdoor seating - Caught the Pirate show, loved the simplistic decor.
Decent service once you get past the hostess stand.
Almost forgot - try the Japanese white wine.  It's a plum wine and to die for.

Bad-ish:
So-so hostesses - They weren't very welcoming, and we were seated late for our reservation.  Very annoying.
Our waiter forgot to put in our dessert order, so we waited a lot longer than we should have.  On the plus, we got free coffee for his mistake.

At first this place looks like the type of restaurant where you would see Lauren Conrad and her posse of MTV cameras and producers.  Once you get past that first impression, it's a really nice place to eat, low key and quiet if you go early evening.  There is way more than just sushi, and the portions are a great size.

Needless to say my experience was very intersting there, Went with a big party. Mind you it was my best friends birthday, who is japanese, and it was a friends and family dinner. The waiter passed out the menu and then gave us a 30min lecture on the menu. I was way more confused about the menu after the lecture than I was before he blabbed on about the menu itemsI Also he kept of saying Social House is very non traditional and that all the traditional stuff on the menu is boring and not to order it. Dude half of the people at this table is Japanese and they pretty much took offense to that. In their defense I would have taken offense to it as well if I were Japanese.  Also he was talking to us as if we were trying Japanese food for the first time. He was trying to explain to us that edamame was soybeans. SERIOUSLY!! HE was a very annoying waiter if you can't tell. Totally had to dock a star for that.

On to a brighter note. The food was delicious. We ordered edamame, yellowtail sashimi, tuna sashini, soft shell crab, popcorn shrimp, kobe tacos, lettuce cups, rolls and the scallops. 

Sashimi:
Both of the sashimis were delicious. I would highly recommend both the yellowtail and the tuna. However I liked the TUNA ALOT!!!!!! The different sauces and flavors were just amazing. I would definitely go back to eat the tuna again. 

Popcorn shrimp:
BOMB!!! Came with these amazing suaces. There was one that was really spciy and delicious. I would highly recommend this as well. 

Lettuce cups:
SO GOOD!! A bib lettuce with a piece of miso cod. Filled with so much flavor and deliciousness.

We came here for yet another Vegas birthday dinner and we were blown away with how amazing it was.  Our server was very helpful in recommending drinks and food and they really went all out to make sure our waters were never empty and that we were enjoying our food.  We ordered practically everything that was recommended -- an array of sushi and some appetizers and entrees -- and the only thing I can really think of that wasn't my favorite was the beef roll.  We even tacked on some extra food after we made our primary order just to try some other things because we were having such a great time.

It was my friend's birthday and they came out with a special HUGE dessert for her that we all shared.  It was a chocolate cake with some vietnamese coffee ice cream and it was so delicious and so thoughtful of them to do.

All in all, I'd definitely come back here again -- it's a little weird going to Crystals for a dinner, but definitely worth it!",8OvOiyAMrjfIx5bmWNSCyA,3,2,4,YOuHvwBazheH7a4hxW5RTg

We got to the point where we didn't end up eating any sushi because we were beyond full before then. With dessert and leaving stuffed, we were at (55/person). Not too shabby.

The only weird thing was that we ended up getting a big table outside the restaurant, in the mall.

3050745,2015-01-12,3,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"This review is for the ramen.

Located in the Aria Hotel, Social House is a popular destination for people looking to dine on sushi and ramen.  I've been a few times on various trips, always ordered the tonkotsu ramen w/ chashu, and had the same reaction each time. 

The ramen always takes an unconscionably long time, for whatever reason.  It's always the last dish to be served and is not worth the wait.  At first glance, it's a pretty bowl of ramen topped with crispy minced garlic and spicy seasoning, but that's where the good news ends.  

Social House's ramen fails on all three of my ramen criteria: broth, noodles, egg. The broth is so thin and watered down and there's none of the distinctive pork flavor that characterizes most tonkotsu broths.  It's definitely bland on the ramen spectrum.  The noodles have been way overcooked on every single visit-- so soft and absolutely no chew.  They don't even seem to be alkaline noodles, but rather, noodles you'd find in a bowl of instant ramen.  Don't even get me started on the egg. Social House serves a POACHED egg, which is confusing at best.  It's nowhere near authentic and the egg retains an unappetizing gelatinous texture in the broth.  What is even happening here?

I wouldn't recommend adding an order of chashu.  The cuts of pork belly are usually skimpy and not tender. Idk, the entire bowl is a strange excuse for tonkotsu ramen.  I think the only people who would enjoy it are those who have zero points of reference. 

On a more positive note, the kobe sliders are pretty great.  The kobe beef is extremely tender and juicy and the hoisin-based sauce makes each bite deliciously sweet.  The buns are pillowy and just the right size. I love sweet+savory flavor combos and everything about the kobe sliders works for me! 

If you don't really care/can't tell the difference, Social House provides a dark/sexy environment to enjoy some mediocre-ish Japanese food. But if you're looking for a great bowl of ramen, you won't find it here.",-nEq8pL9qoN-eT3IPel-OQ,5,3,2,PNrmKXQOzvDhtdO5fY--Jg

We LOVE LOVE LOVE sushi and sake cocktails, so when we saw Social House featured on Giada's Weedend Getaways, we went right to OpenTable.com to book a reservation.

The room has a a great vibe and feel. Love the music, but as is the rage these days, it was just a bit too loud. Perhaps that was to prevent us from hearing all the obviously interesting conversations around us. I'lll get back to that.

We arrived early for our 8:30 reservation on a Sun eve but were seated promptly.  Two servers dropped by to introduce themselves and noted they would BOTH be taking care of us; a concept that seemed to work very well throughout the eve as we are checked in on frequently all night.  We asked for suggestions for sake cocktails; we were surprised they offered so few as they are all the rage back in Omaha. But she suggested a sake-a-tini which turned out to be delicious.

The food is definitely the star here. Others here have raved about the tuna sashimi with the jalpenos.. Yum yum. The kobe beef (you get your choice of domestic or imported!!!!) with creme fraiche was also to die for.  We came for sushi and focused on the rolls... and loved everything! The box roll is excellent.... and the lobster roll with a curry sauce on the side was also a great recommendation from the server. 

If people watching is your thing, Social House sure does have it. We were seated among some very interesting tables.  The older couple on our right was obviously each out for the eve away from the real spouses... she had a very high pitched Betty Boop voice and a rock on her finger the size of Rhode Island. On the other side of us, Borat and his brother were dining with their rent-a-dates and being all creepy and shit... talking to their dates with their puffedout chests, feeding the ladies as they pretended to be alternately repulsed and delighted while spending their drachmas. 

All in all a great Vegas evening. Social House provides a great stage and wonderful menu. Check it out for yourself.",x2YxydBXQ8v2LKfeobvB0Q,1,0,5,HlWzQVSvXNGojlqpUqHqiA

However, for a $125 omakase dinner, I was expecting a bit more sashimi and sushi. Instead, our meal was pretty heavy with a lot of meats. Half of the meal were cooked dishes, and we only get 3 small portion of sashimi (first three courses) and 4 sushi each (9th course). The sashimi were great, but the sushi was only okay I think. 

dinner for six plus 1-2 drinks each, our bill came up to be a bit over $1,000 before tips. There is no doubt that the food tasted great, but it was a little bit too pricy for the items that I got in my opinion.",suJLydMivOMegcRNKNuKNg,1,0,3,AfGrecuFhKgGVOGIeEGfEg

3076496,2012-12-23,1,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"My boys and I go to Vegas twice a year to basically let it all out! I mean, it *is* Sin City; excess, excess, excess, right?! Social House is a great place to participate in hedonistic adventures. I appreciated the ambiance and decor. Very chic, sophisticated, and elegantly adorned with contemporary Asian decor.

Our (very attractive) server greeted us immediately and took our drink orders. Two of us had the white lotus lychee martini. It has Skyy Vodka, lychee liquor, pineapple juice and a fresh lychee. How could you lose with a lychee martini?! My other two friends ordered the SH Red Champagne. That was a lovely drink too... with citrus vodka, orange liqueur, lemon juice, hibiscus, and prosecco. 

Here, you can share small plates or order some individual entree-sized plates. We decided to share plates since we wanted EVERRRRRYTHIIING! The grilled salmon was very tasty. The teriyaki sauce with it was thick, somewhat sweet, and the salmon was beautifully cooked. The miso port short ribs were fantastic. The meat fell off the bone and the Israeli couscous was a nice accompanying grain. The angry tuna roll was everything I hoped it would be. However, I've had similar in ""everyday"" Japanese restaurants before so I wasn't completely won over by this. Nonetheless, it was still tasty. The kobe tacos were fantastic and is great for sharing. The tuna tataki salad was also great. Now, as a Filipino, I HAD to order the crispy pata. I understand I can't expect it to be like the ones I had growing up... Social House's interpretation was solid... but still left me a little disappointed. Perhaps because I know crispy pata shouldn't be $26 (HA!), but also because I think the SoHo pickles didn't suffice as an accompanying side. I wish it had come with some sort of greens instead or paired with an interesting starch that isn't necessarily rice. (Typically, us Filipinos would just douse that pata with vinegar/soy sauce-vinegar and bring on the rice, but I know it's supposed to be an ""elevated"" version of the classic meat so.....) 

Anyway, Social House is the place to go if you want a wide array of pan-Asian food, has a ""fun"" crowd of scenesters, and is close to all the action (it's inside Crystals). While I am giving this place 4 stars, however, I think there are other places more worthy of your Vegas culinary travels than Social House.

I ordered the $40 roll with Kobe and sent my entire order back. The other guys were starving so they at theirs but agreed it was Chinese buffet quality.

Edamame - You get two bowls of this... one regular and one soaked in this chili sauce.  So delicious!  I ate all of the latter obviously.

Hamachi tartare with taro chips - Taro chips were a nice touch. Hamachi was mixed with guacamole.  It's a pretty generous portion because the fish comes out in a dip like fashion.

Sesame kelp salad - Very refershing; high quality seaweed.

Sichimi butter poached potatoes - Perfect bite-sized potatoes with a good kick from the sichimi.  One side order is HUGE... it could've fed all of 10 of us as a side.

Kobe sliders with shichimi french fries - Beef was perfectly cooked and the fries were just as addicting as the potatoes if not more.  You get banana ketchup and a lemony tartar sauce (that's what it tasted like) which went nicely.

Taco trio - There were three kinds but I ate the beef one.  I liked it!  I would say it's half the size of a normal taco so you don't get too full.

Seared branzino - Most tender sea bass. If I didn't do tapas style eating, I would definitely get this as my main entree next time. 

Angry tuna roll - REALLY crispy.  Instead of frying the entire roll, they fry one portion of it and top it with the tuna.  I like that.  

**We also got two other rolls somewhere at this time but I can't remember them.  They must not have been that memorable.**

The food was amazing. The sushi was very good, I had a chicken with sundried tomatoes in it, very different, but very good. The Kobe burgers with flavored ketchup and mustard were also a big hit with everyone at the table. For dessert we basically tried one of everything even the lunch bag of donuts which were delicious. The drink menu also has some interesting and fun choices that were all tasty.  Overall a top of the line dining experience.

The look of the place was unique.  When you check in, they escort you to the second level and while walking up there, the walls resembled safety deposit boxes, which I thought was artistic.  

The service there was great.  The servers there were friendly and courteous, but when they made recommendations, I slightly started to laugh (quietly).  They started to praise certain dishes that are unique, but in reality anybody can whip it up at home.  

Now the food.  It was good, but like I said it was not unique, nor was it fresh.  I have eaten at Kitayama in Costa Mesa, Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, and you can taste the freshness.  My buddy kept on praising the fish here, saying it is as fresh as it can get.  I took a bite into the uni, sake(salmon), and sashimi dishes.  They were good, but not fresh.  For being high profiled Japanese restaurant, it seems like they concentrated more on the artistic looks of the food than the taste.

In my opinion, there will never be a great Japanese restaurant in Vegas.  In order for that to happen, California has to sink into the Pacific and then Vegas will have immediate access to the ocean to get fresh seafood.  Even though seafood comes in fresh on a daily basis by air or truck, the quality does go down from being refrigerated for a long period of time.  All in all, the design of the restaurant is interesting, the servers are polite and courteous, but I would recommend another restaurant if you are picky on taste like I am.",PMYy47wc_Mzd_XCPu8CbOw,0,0,2,Sh1W5_pGYeItjOPg301veQ

the inside is good if you wanna dine or date--the newspaper stacks effect was quite impressive, a liitle bit. but this is not my thing-- cant they be more flexible to accomodate all their
 customer's wishes?no. cozwe asked for an outside seating,  there were ppl right out there and why cant we? i dont understand. 

mood:

anywayz, i was with the right peeps tonight. so i guess that was okay. tonight's buzzed-mode talk was about ""satisfaction"". it was alright, juz chill--

@ the end of the chillaxin i was enjoying every second of it as i was being the audience of two people figuring out how the night could satisfy the  unsatisfiable kid in me.
 haha, even made it more fun --i sealed my lips juz lookin at them and  hearing all this stuff-- its what im talkin about--
chill and connect.

wallet-watch:

pricey. tonight i got 3 pineapple mojitos--beer was $7, a sushi plate, and some friedlings. sake trio was like $20+....

It's got a nice sexy, cozy vibe when you enter. There is a bar and a seating area which has chairs and love seats. Something about love seats around a table is so cool to me. They have a bigger room in the back for large parties too. We choose to sit in the front area. We ordered the sunomo (cucumber salad) and a house green salad. Both were excellent. The sesame seeds on the sunomo were spot on! Both were delicious and refreshing. Next, we got the shrimp tempura and the seafood ramen. Both were very tasty. I was surprised and impressed that the soup came with 2 extra large shrimp and 6 clams. The tempura came with 3 shrimp and a couple of veggies. Last, we had the spicy tuna roll and the veggie roll. I'm not really into raw fish but the spicy tuna was DELICIOUS!!! The veggie roll was good too, but I think the spicy tuna was better.
The service was great too. Our glasses were filled throughout the meal. They came over and cleared out plates pretty quickly, asked how everything was. 
So, for $20 a person, you cant' beat it. Well, if it was $15 you could, hahaha. 
They sneak in upgrades on the pre fixe menu where you can order salmon teriyaki and a few other things for an additional $5. I'd rather they just put it on the menu for $20 or take it off. It's sneaky and that's the only thing I didn't like.

Don't knock it until you try it ! It was staple at our house when my dad and uncles would all drink together. Total comfort food for me. Crispy pata is also known for being hella cheap too.  My wife and I ordered the crispy pata which was cooked perfectly and tasted bomb. The skin was crispy and pork was juicy and not too greasy. It was as good as the hole in the wall filipino places in LA , but damn $28 though? My lola is probably turning over in her grave if she knew how much we paid for that damn savory, juicy, deep fried pork knuckle goodness. Sorry lola! =(

Yellowtail Jalapeno (Crispy Jalapeno, Garlic Dust, Tiny Cilantro, Calamansi Soy - $22) - Yellowtail didn't tasted super fresh, but I did like the fried jalapeno.

Thankfully, a dinner at Social House also became a tradition after our first visit. This last year was our third time, and Social House definitely did not disappoint. 

While I loved the ambiance at their old location more, their new spot in City Center maintained the delectable flavors we came for. If you've never been, the chef recommends ordering several small dishes and sharing them family style. They're also super flexible about customizing the serving sizes to your group (i.e. we had six on our side, so they let us order one and a half dishes for some things). 

Here are some of our picks:

- Hamachi with jalapeños. Sure it's simple and it's been done elsewhere, but that doesn't make this dish any less delicious. The quality of fish here is superb, and they accompany it with tempura'd jalapeño slices. Amazing, I just wish it came with more pieces.

- Hamachi tartare. Tried this for the first time this year. Not amazing but it was still tasty.

- Cod bibb lettuce cups. Oh my lord, these were great! The host mentioned that these were a specialty of the chef: slow cooked miso cod wrapped in a bed of lettuce? Do not miss, for sure.

- Kobe sliders. We didn't get them this round (""They're essentially $5 a bite."") but these are incredible. 

- Tocino ribs. Fall off the bone is an understatement! These were incredibly tender and had a great flavor.

- Angry tuna roll. I'm generally wary when people deep fry rolls, but this was still delicate, flavorful, and definitely had a good kick to it!

- Sake bombs. What the heck? Their new method is an overturned shot glass in a cup of beer. Def not as fun as balancing the sake glass over chopsticks and slamming the table with a resounding KANPAI! Bring those back!

The restaurant was dark and decorated in red and black colors throughout. It would be a great place for an intimate dinner with a significant other. I would not recommend for families or people with children. 

This sushi restaurant was a bit on the pricey end but completely worth every dollar spent!
Imagine my comfort level when our waitress explained she also struggles with a gluten intolerance and was well aware of how to prepare the foods and when to check on items to make sure I was safe. 

She answered all my questions about the menu and made me feel extremely safe about eating there. When I had questions she didn't know the answer, she immediately went back to the kitchen to ask the chef to ensure I was staying gluten free! 

I decided to try the most expensive roll in the place - it had gold flakes on it! Kobe beef, king crab and yellow fin were some of the meats in this roll. It tasted like magic. I loved it and every single thing about it was phenomenal. I hadn't spent a lot of money so far on food during the trip so I decided to take a splurge. 

We also had roasted mini potatoes that were seasoned so perfectly and roasted to the greatest crispiness ever that we were all fighting over them at the table.

The place was pretty empty at noon on a Sunday, but filled up pretty quickly. We were seated, offered drinks, and ordered from the prix fixe menu.

+First course: Social House green salad with baby mesclun, tomato, and julienne slices of some root vegetable. It was dripping in the ginger dressing. It was tasty, but I wasn't interested in drinking my salad.

+Second course: Tonkotsu ramen, pork broth, a slab of pork, served with a soft-boiled egg and some fried garlic bits. The broth tasted kinda funny, so we added a splash of soy sauce for some flavor, broke open the yolk to add some creaminess, and sprinkled in the fried bits of garlic for some bite. It helped tremendously. I finished the entire bowl. Woo, proud member of the Clean Plate Club!

+Third course: spicy tuna cut roll. Here's where the problem lies: I don't know about you, but I cannot stand it when sushi has creamy ingredients added to it. Save the mayonnaise for sandwiches and the cream cheese for bagels. When I order sushi, I want simplicity; the flavors of the rice, nori, and fish must be able to stand alone, otherwise, I begin to wonder what you're trying to hide with that huge dollop of aioli. End rant. Anyway, with all that said, the sushi was NOT my favorite. Even the shrimp tempura cut roll had a ton of aioli added to the already-creamy avocado. What gives?

I reserve on Opentable.com for 6pm Saturday. My boyfriend and I arrived 5 minutes earlier and were told to sit in the lounge for our table to be ready but we didn't wait long. As soon as our Hostess lead us upstairs I knew i was going to LOVE Social House. Its fun, hip and chic, Social House Restaurant has a live DJ and interactive sushi bar (kinda reminds me of Blow Fish BUT better). Its fashionable yet relaxed atmosphere ideal for big group or a romantic couple dinner.

Our waiters were very attentive and friendly. I didn't know what to order and our waiter was happy to suggest his favorite dishes. So we finally decided on 1 Cold Dish (Mixed Nigiri Sushi $32), 1 Hot Dish (5 Spice Chicken Wings ($10), 2 Social House Rolls (Adobo Chicken and Caramelized Onions with Soy Vinegar Chicken Reduction $12) & Shrimp and Spicy Tuna Battera (box) Roll $20). I have to say the food was excellent especially the Shrimp and Spicy Tuna Battera. It was TOO die for. $20 for a 6 pieces sushi was worth the price. The roll was a square shaped rather than the normal round roll. The mixed Nigiri plate were fresh. Our whole meal cost about $118 with non-alcoholic drinks. Many people might think the sushi is over price but I thought the prices match the fresh quality, flavor & presentation. You wont find the typical mainstream sushi rolls. 

Our waiters kept coming back to see how we were doing and also refilling our drinks without me requesting for a refill (that's a BIG plus). The next time, i am in town i will definitely eat at Social House again.

Although the place is described as ""Japanese"" tapas, I'm pretty sure that's just a technique they use to get you to order too many items.  Don't fall for it because you can try just a few and still enjoy the experience without being hungry.  We tried:

- A special off-the-menu appetizer the waiter suggested with thinly sliced tuna, green pepper oil, and crispy scallions.  AMAZING!
- Scallop dish with Japanese eggplant and vanilla foam which was cooked very well, but the sweet foam weirded me out a bit.
- Kobe Sliders, which normally comes with 3 and some tempura-style onion rings with banana ketchup (normally yuck, but it was very lightly flavored) and some kind of citrus mayonnaise.  This dish ROCKED.
- A lobster California roll, adobo chicken roll, and a spicy tuna with shrimp roll which were just so-so and not as well-made as I would have expected (not very tightly rolled).  I would actually skip most of the rolls unless there's something really fantastic that you can't live without.

The hot and cold appetizers are really where it's at.  I can't say much for the raw sushi items because we didn't try any, but the rolls were a bit of a disappointment.  However, it's a great atmosphere and very trendy without being too shi-shi.  It's by no means cheap, but you could probably get away with $50-60 a head and be satisfied.

The Manager stopped by our table to congratulate the beautiful bride-to-be and to offer shots for the table since we had the honor of being their first Bachelorette Party in their new location. Whoo! 

Donning pink tiaras, pink feather boas, and hoochie dresses, our six-pack of chicks got the party started knocking back choice cocktails and fancy sakes. Our super helpful waiter had tremendous patience explaining the menu to our drunk asses. We choose an assortment of sushi rolls, one of my favorites being the Crispy Kalbi Beef Roll. I was also digging the Sesame Kelp Salad. 

The specialty cocktails were eclectic and worldly, but I think next time I'll stay Asian instead of delving into the South American... their Pisco Sour 2.0 was interesting but I still prefer the traditional version over their take with hibiscus syrup. The Red Champagne was delicious, especially if you like sweet and bubbly. The winner of the night was the sparkling blueberry sake by the name of Star Rabbit. It came in a little blue bottle with a hot pink label... delicious and a perfect fit for the theme of the night. I think we killed about 3 bottles of that stuff. 

Since we couldn't bring ourselves to leave, we decided to order dessert as well. The Milk Chocolate Cake was a hit with the table, but the Coco-Nuts a bit too out there for our palates. Also, an arrangement of chocolate truffles was sent out to our party which ensured that we left with full bellies. 

After passing out ""Hottest Jawline"" and ""Nicest Eyes"" stickers to our waiter, other waiters, the manager, and busboy, we left Social House and continued on elsewhere with our Bachelorette festivities. Not without a quick romp in the fountain outside Aria... watch out for those Star Rabbits!!!",WOWnFwvuu-IFJaA_oHwPqw,10,9,5,6Bg9-uAZZ-nW7tVbcEYoHA

The restaurant is tucked away within the City Center but very easy to find.  Many Taxi drivers still think it's located in Treasure Island BUT IT IS NOT.  It's easy if you enter closest to the Aria valet.

The food was AMAZING!  We went with a simple menu with 1 sashimi option and the plates were cleared and I had several guests asking me to order more food for them.  
Everything came out at just the right timing.  The tables were set beautifully and I was able to bring in my own personalized cocktail napkins and champagne glasses.  They even setup the table with my place cards and placed gifts at everyone's seat.
They made us personalized menus for everyone as well.

We had our own private bartender to utilize if we needed it.  Most of the guests ordered from the servers but it was nice to have that option.

We ended up ordering our wedding cake directly from them as well.  That was the BEST decision we could have made.  Stephanie was the pastry chef and she did a phenomenal job.  EVERYONE loved the cake and it was made perfect for us.  She did 3 tiers and even made us a small cake to taste and take pictures cutting into.  She did different fillings for each layer and they were all so delicious!

The wait staff was amazing and accommodating and the general manager, Michael was a saint!  He was so patient with us and I would work with him again at anytime!

I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner and/or a special event.  We had regular the regular menu when we visited before the wedding and we loved every item we tried!  We can't wait to go back and eat!!",eiGP6f108axfJ6SBXzAmug,5,4,5,gkp5x8b7TIqTCX176RQlVQ

First let me say the place is set up really well. There are all of these intimate eating areas so no matter where you sit you don't feel like you are in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant. 

Second, the decor is awesome. I have posted some pictures so you should really check it out. I would say the pictures don't do it any justice but at least you will get a good idea.

Third, the food was amazing. Definitely nothing you would expect from a regular sushi restaurant. All of it was innovating and by far the best I have ever had. One of the girls with us doesn't eat fish but she ate everything and LOVED it. Everyone I had dinner with said it was hands down the best meal they have ever had. And if you follow any piece of advice it would be GET THE DESSERT PLATTER. If it is just 2 of you go for the small one but if you have the room for it I highly suggest the large one. You miss out on 3 of the desserts if you only get the small one.

Lastly, the service was out of this world. So far in all of the reviews I have read nobody has mentioned the awesome service they have. If you are looking to try new things and really enjoy what the restaurant has to offer they have a service where the waitress/waiter will ask for your likes, dislikes, allergies, and price range. Then they will custom create a menu for you. There is not picking involved. They bring out what they think are the best dishes according to YOUR taste. Everything is served family style and they bring out a dish about every 10 minutes until you are full. It is a great way to really enjoy the food you are eating and to feel super luxurious. Plus the servers are not overly aggressive. They give you your space and only check in before they bring out another dish to make sure your are still hungry. There were 5 of us and here is an idea of what we got: (not sure about some spelling)

Seaweed Salad
Edemame
Tuna Titaki
Yellow tail with Tempura Jalapeno
Curry Lobster Salad
Scallops with Eggplant
Braised Short Ribs
Tempura Shrimp
Specialty Roll
Large Dessert Platter 

WOW so much food and it was pretty affordable too! We got a mid-range bottle of Sake and tipped generously and it was $90 per person. Not too bad for being right on the strip with a VIP view of the Pirate Fights.

Either way I will be visiting this restaurant EVERY time I am in Vegas and if I had the funds I would fly there just to eat another meal like I had.",4Rwu18O7baMB5ZzqvGgkEA,2,1,5,xBlbrY-h5Sk6Mt9QwVWs-w

3983712,2012-07-26,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"I came here while staying at Aria for the happy hour 5-8pm. I sat at the bar and had the ramen and added the egg and pork belly. I also had a hotate/scallop sushi and the salmon avocado roll. 

If I was only rating the ramen i'd give it 4 stars. It was a good portion, (I didn't finish my roll) and the egg was perfectly poached and was a great added flavor and texture to the dish. The pork belly appeared sparing but was actually a perfect sized portion for the bowl. 

The scallop sushi was a disappointment. I wanted a chopped spicy scalloped, and thought that is what I asked for when I ordered and asked the bartender about it but when it arrived it was a scallop split in half over rice with the dab of wasabi on the rice. The scallop was okay, I was expecting it to at least have a sweetness to it but it wasnt. The roll was not worth it's price. For a happy hour i would say the price/portion size was disaapointing. 

Best things were the ramen and my $3 blue moon. Atmosphere is nice dark woods and reds, good sized bar and lounge area. I think I would have been better off skipping the roll and scallop and just ordering a specialty sushi appetizer.

our group ordered a ton of things and were really impressed with the freshness and preparation of the food. yes this restaurant is expensive, and the portions are small, but this is vegas-expect to pay for quality. 

stand out items included the waygu wasabi cream sashimi, yellowtail jalapeño, kobe gyoza, and the hanger steak.

first of all, its a saturday night and they are out of pretty much EVERYTHING. oysters, certain types of sake, toro, you name it--they had to see if they had it. so needless to say, we weren't gonna order omikase with a depleted selection. we ordered every appetizer that our server recommended and they were decent--definitely not the kind of metlt-in-your-mouth and make your knees give out sushi i was expecting, but it was okay. we ordered albacore belly sashimi because it's one of our favorites, and received 2 pieces of seared albacore? huh?? that's like ordering toro and getting maguro. and they still insisted that it was it. laaaaaame. 

the decor is awesome--walking up the stairs it looks like you're in a bank vault. and the ambience is really relaxed and feels more like a lounge then a restaurant, which is a definite plus. and they have outdoor seating that over looks the strip/pirate ships. 

its seriously not worth it guys. you're better off walking to a roulette table and putting 200 bucks on black. that way at least there's about a 50% chance you'll walk out of treasure island happy.",mBhV9BJ43n6zoiL09Y4cNg,0,0,2,8a1ay9kkDFxJbcq9SlhG-Q
4023307,2009-06-22,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"Have been here twice- both times were amazing. 

The first time stumbled upon social house only because we were getting sh*tfaced at kahunaville downstairs but didn't want their food so went in search of something better and BOOM there was social house. We didn't have a reservation and were about to settle for just sitting anywhere when the hostess recommended the patio because the pirate show was going to start in 10 minutes. We thanked her for the tip and were seated outside- and got a front row seat for the show! 

everything we ordered was amazing- we were even with a sushi hater who said his terryaki chicken was delish. 

when we got the bill we were a little taken aback- it was pretty expensive our bill for 3 people + 2 bottles of Saki was about $80- $90 bucks but we all agreed it was worth it. 

the second time we went it was a girlfriends 21st birthday and we had just won $1000 on penny slots so wanted a great dinner to celebrate- knowing the insider tip about the balcony we called ahead and made reservations for 15 min. before showtime. The waiter was so sweet and took multiple pictures for us and gave us passes to these clubs going on and even a free birthday shot for the bday girl. 

once again the food was GREAT. we all ordered something diff and all picked off each others plates. 

again it was expensive but it IS VEGAS so......

After reading some of the so-so reviews on Yelp, me and my bf didn't have high expectations of Social House, but we were ""WOWED"" by the food. Considering it's an Asian Fusion restaurant, the dishes far surpassed the ones we had at Okada at The Wynn and Sushi Roku at Caesar's Palace...

This was the first place we hit up after our flight landed on Friday, 12/5. We arrived at 10:30 PM for our reservations and were seated promptly. 

The décor was trendy and upbeat. I would not expect anything less for an upscale LV restaurant. What stood out the most was the wall filled with gold drawers by the staircase, which was reminiscent of the drawers you would find in a Chinese Herb store. The patio overlooks the TI Pirate Show--the perfect place to sit if the weather was hot. The only complaint I had was the tables were too close too each other, so you can hear your neighbor's entire conversation and they can hear yours. 

The restaurant was not busy at this time, but it took about 10-15 minutes, for our server, Danny/Donnie (?) to even show up. But, more on that later.

On to the food and drinks...

COCKTAILS: 
*Green Tea Lemonade: Gross, it was very bitter and hard to drink.

*Ginger Saketini: Even worse. It was super sweet and you couldn't taste the alcohol. It was so sweet that it was like drinking syrup.

FOOD:
*Yellowtail with Crispy Jalapeños: EXCELLENT; the BEST SASHIMI EVER. The yellowtail was fresh and melted in your mouth. The warm tempura battered jalapeño was a perfect compliment to the yellowtail. A big thanks to the Yelpers out there who recommended this dish!

*Kobe Sliders: EXCELLENT. Yes, it's expensive ($24) for three white castle sized burgers with tempura battered onion rings, but well worth it. The kobe was tender and melted in your mouth. That in between the slightly sweet toasted bun and ponzu (?) mayo was an AMAZING combination. The onion rings were light and crispy, not too oily. 

*Uni with Quail Egg: OMG GOOD! The uni was massive and incredibly fresh. The quail egg on top of that was buttery heaven. I always judge a restaurant by the quality of their Uni. And, Social House's Uni is definitely one of the best we've ever tasted. For about $10/piece, I guess it better be. :)

*Hamachi Roll: Very Good; it was fresh and buttery and paired very well with the garlic chips and citrus soy. It also had a nice kick to it.

*Shrimp Spicy Tuna Battera Roll: Ehh, could have passed on this one. This roll was topped with cooked shrimp and filled with spicy tuna that was NOT spicy. It was very bland.

*Carrot Cardamon Cake with Pistachio Ice Cream: OMFG--One word that best describes this dessert to a ""T"": is ORGASMIC!!! This is ABSOLUTELTY THE BEST DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD. The carrot cake came out warm, crisp on the outside, and was topped with toasted carrots, alongside cream cheese fraiche. Once you cut into it, you find yourself with an incredibly moist, light, and flavorful cake. 

One spoonful of the cake, a little of the cream cheese fraiche and a sprinkle of the toasted carrots with a tiny scoop of the pistachio ice cream carrot=ORGASM in your mouth. The flavors went very well together and the different textures (crunchy, warm, rich) were AMAZING.  The pistachio ice cream was OoOoo La La; this was the richest ice cream I've ever tasted! 

SERVICE: 
Needs a major overhaul. From start to finish, the service was terrible. This should have been an indication when entering Social House, and we were faced with 3 zombie-like hostesses. 

My bf and I are not high maintenance; we order and eat quickly, clean up after ourselves, and leave right afterwards. So, when it comes to service, all I ask is to get nicely greet with a smile, promptly take our orders, and check on us just once. 

We got none of the above from Danny/Donnie (?), our server. He was no where to be found for the first 10-15 minutes (it was not busy at the time). When he did come, Danny/Donnie had  an expression on his face that read: ""F***, it's Friday Night and I don't want to be here. And, since I'm miserable, I might as well let everyone else feel the same way"" look on his face. 

C'mon dude, this is you job; I've done retail for 4 years, and the least you can do is ""fake"" it. After he took our orders, we didn't see him for the rest of the night. 

Apparently, we weren't the only ones who felt this way. The table next to us who also had Danny/Donnie said he was not deserving of any tip. 

The rest of the staff is just like him; young, snooty, and arrogant (except for the bus boys). Geez, people--does it hurt to crack a smile?!?!?! 

Hopefully, when we come back again in the Summer (and we'll definitely be back for the FOOD), they will have new friendlier staff. If this is the case, and the food is consistent, I'll definitely change my rating to 5 STARS!",eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg,2,1,4,u88QmZjHoKNUa-h1h7p30g

We walked in and being a Thursday at 6PM, it was not busy. As the happy hour is only available in the bar lounge area, we were seated at a table next to the shuttered windows looking outside (to the mall walkway). 

The happy hour menu consists of cold items, warm items, rolls and beverages. 
I ordered the most expensive happy hour drink... $9 for a sparkling sake Bellini, and it was yum. So easy to drink, I could have easily had 3 of them. 

For food, we had: 

Ramen with poached egg and pork belly - O.M.G. This is a hidden gem for ramen. The Tonkotsu broth was creamy and rich (thinking about it makes my mouth water). With the poached egg, the broth became even more buttery. Amazing. 
There were 2 slices pork belly I thought there was a good mixture of fat and meat, but it was perfected with the seared outer layer. You can tell it's a good sear when it's still firm after sitting in broth for a couple minutes. Some of the noodles were stuck together but at least they were all cooked and not al dente. 

Salmon tartare with Taro chips - I didn't get a picture of this because it was our first dish and I was bordering hangry, so I devoured it. The taro chips were house made and fresh. The salmon tartare was good but it came with a load of Ikura on top, and I'm not fan. Also, there was a layer of wasabi? cream in the middle which added to the creamy texture of the salmon and gave good color contract but I didn't think it added to the dish. 

Thai Beef Salad - these were essentially Thai beef butter lettuce cups. The beef was tender and flavorful but this was certainly not spicy and I was expecting spicy. I guess I could have asked for sriracha. 

Kalbi beef roll - I usually don' like rolls and especially cooked food rolls, but this was not bad. I think this is how they made it.... take a long slice of cooked kalbi (cut out the fat), bread with panko, flash fry, and then roll in sushi rice. Topping each roll was the Korean sweet spicy red sauce.

First impression: hostess is a bitch.  I called for a reservation and the girl on the other end didn't sound particularly happy.  Said, ""Ok, you're all set,"" and just hung up.  I barely even got in a ""kthxbye.""  We arrive and I'm assuming the hostess is the same girl who I spoke to on the phone.  No smile upon greeting us, and we later see her giving the  same shitty treatment to the party next to us.  A younger girl asked for water for her family on the table and is told coldly ""your server will be right with you.""  

Our actual server was nice enough.  The ikura & scallop nigiri was pretty good quality.  They were sadly out of uni.  Wouldn't recommend the angry tuna roll- the ponzu onion totally overshadowed the rest of the dish.  I tasted no spicy tuna, only pickled shit.  I guess you could say it made us angry!!  (Har har har)  We also had the garlic oil wagyu sashimi, which was tasty but also very expensive.  The rest of the food we ordered was aight- some vegetable tempura and the shichimi butter poached potatoes.  Oh, I was pleasantly surprised to see the potatoes were a huge portion, but upon further inspection, the bottom of the bowl was full of cabbage instead!  Haha!

Upon leaving, we were thanked by 2 other staff members, but the hostess merely glanced at us and ignored us.  I have no idea why one would put this individual at the front of the house.  She seriously needs to go.  

I wouldn't mind giving this place another chance, but I'd suggest Blue Ribbon for quality sushi nearby.  Their staff were all very friendly even when working on Christmas day!",Ae6uCur_p5vFG-ZBPdtTrA,1,0,2,vmJH4K-eAsyvvqvH3r8vjA

Design and vibe was nice, similar to a lounge or night club. Decorated in a dark setting. Service was good-they were on top of constantly checking up on us...a little too much to the point where they might as well sat with us since they heard our whole conversation during lunch. 

Food was so blah. No winner winner here. Still trying to forget what I ate. Th seafood soup tasted like they made it 2 days ago. Yellow tail was great and fresh (i think the only fresh seafood they had). Chicken teriyaki bowl seemed like a frozen premade bowl from Costco. 

I don't get the hype ???

We had the Seared Fluke, Seared Albacore roll and the Citrus Peel Miso Cod. The Seared Fluke was a white fish served sashimi style. It looked really plain when served, but the soy salt was what gave it an interesting flavor because the soy sauce flavor was super concentrated. The seared albacore roll which had spicy tuna, shrimp tempera and avocado, was also tasty. The miso cod was probably our favorite out of the three. The cod itself was pretty light, but it was prepared with the skin still on which gave it flavor and a nice chewy texture.

My husband and I got:

Cocktails:
1. Tea & T - I loved this tequila-based cocktail that came in a cute teapot :)
2. Some kind of cocktail with bacon-infused whiskey for the hus, which he sent back. Too smokey-tasting.

Dined here with my cousin and my 1yr old nephew, the Sunday after Christmas. Having a child in tow didn't stop us from venturing into fine dining for the evening.

Our meal started with shrimp & pork lumpia served with sweet chili sauce, the flavors reminiscent to Filipino style home-made lumpia rolls with a heavier price tag. There's no set guidelines to good lumpia making it rather subjective from household to household. In short, it was good lumpia.

The second dish: Hokkaido Sea Scallops came out salty! Thoroughly disappointed. The texture of scallops was spot on but failed in execution, good grief whoever worked our plate needs to lay off the salt.

The final plate before we eventually got fed up, the Striped Sea Bass, was tender, not flaky nor overdone, was accompanied by a similar steamed fish sauce prominent in Chinese style preparations (specifically Guangzhou if memory serves me correct). Moreover upon pondering on the closest approximation to its flavor; it would be my sister's Mother-in-Law's fish sauce...(which is absolutely divine & perfected through generations). A recipe I've coveted for a long time now.

These revelations really bummed us out, when we came to the realization that all that we consumed for the night were mediocre version of comfort food that we were raised on and easily accessible if we just had dinner at home like the rest of the family...

- We were seated at the outside patio.

And this is the revised pirate show with the slutty pirate ladies and unecessary dancing on the ship. Don't forget about the explosions and fireworks. I can't believe how many people still stop to watch this.

The show lasts about 20 minutes. It's really loud so conversation with your party will cease and everybody will be focused on the show. It's a good thing food for 9 people came out quick so we avoided the encore.

- Don't get the Sapporo fish and chips. You can find that at the hotel food court. And while the chips are like those Asian shrimp chips you fry up, I wanted fries haha. Should've got the Kobe beef sliders.

4376439,2012-02-21,1,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"After reading numerous yelp reviews we decided to try Social House for one of our dinners on a recent trip to Vegas.  I was extremely impressed overall.

Ambiance:

This place absolutely nailed it when it comes to decor.  From the 15-20 ft wooden door in the entrance way to the dim lounge lighting throughout, it was the perfect retreat from the flashy lights of Vegas.  

Service:

Our waiter was extremely helpful.  We first asked for some recommendations for hot/cold sakes to choose from.  He asked what we liked and suggested particular sakes based on our feedback and desired price point.  Both our hot and cold selections were great and paired very well with the food.

Food:

At the end of the day, what really distinguishes a restaurant is the food they serve.  Some dishese were better than others, but overall, most dishes were had were incredible.  With a group of three we were able to order a pretty good cross section of the menu.  

Yellowtail Jalapeno:  This was the BEST creative sashimi I've ever had.  Don't mistake this for traditional sashimi, because it is.  It's a modern take and extremely well done.  The yellowtail melted like butter, the jalapeno chip added the perfect hint of spice while providing a texture contrast, the cilantro provided the ideal freshness and the Calamansi soy provided the citrus to round everything out.  This was extremely balanced explosion of flavors without losing the fish.  Yelp needs a 6th star for this.

Tuna Special:  This was also great, but after trying the yellowtail jalapeno first, it became an after thought.  Same great balance of flavors and textures.  4 stars

Rock Shrimp Tempura:  The rock shrimp had the lightest tempura batter on the outside while staying tender and succulent.  However, the breading could've used some flavor (a little bit of salt goes a long way).  Of the trio of dipping sauces, the spicy ponzu was by far my favorite.  3 stars

Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups:

Our waiter was extremely accomadating as a normal order is 2 pieces.  He suggested adding a 3rd piece without us even bringing it up.  I had high expectations, maybe a little too high after reading various reviews.  The cod itself was cooked to perfection.  However, the whole thing just lacked flavor.  Maybe the addition of a sauce would've elevated this dish.  3 stars.

Kobe Sliders:

The Kobe sliders came on Hawaiian bread.  The burger was flavorful and the shoe string fries were good but lacked creativity.  All the flavors were what you'd expect in a Kobe burger.  3 stars.

Kalbi Beef Roll:

Good god this was good.  I love a good kalbi, but so many places over cook the short rib and it becomes stringy.  This is how kalbi should be done!  The texture of the beef was unctuous (in the best possible way) while the flavor was deep and full.  Of all the sushi I've had in my time, this was hands down the best non-traditional sushi roll I've had.  I could've eaten 3 rolls of these and been perfectly content.  Just like the yellowtail, this goes beyond 5 star territory.

Seared Albacore:

This was also amazing, but like the tuna special sashimi, it was overshadowed by the Kalbi roll.  The flavors and textures all complimented each bite.  4 stars.  

Overall, I'm really glad we were able to stop in.  Prices are expensive but reasonable for Vegas.  Social House provides far more value than some other restaurants on the strip.  This has become a staple in my Vegas restaurant rotation!",NZdg6-8JU_T2Gh7F789Cug,6,1,4,LLM6O2mU-kmPdttPVovd5Q
4413685,2014-01-30,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"After trying to find a decent sushi place on the strip, I decided on Social House as the photos of the sushi didn't look like there was an excessive amount of rice, nor did they  look sloppily made (as some other restaurants have). Coming here was a good choice. We ordered the sunrise, salmon and avocado, and spicy tuna rolls and they were all very good. The bf particularly enjoyed the spicy tuna a lot as it was not the normal ""paste"" that sushi restaurants usually incorporate into the rolls, but real spicy tuna pieces. The sunrise roll was excellent. I thoroughly enjoyed the touch of lemon that was on top. I did, however, think that there was too much mayo inside of the sunrise roll. 

For dessert, we ordered the panko-crusted truffle cake, which was deep fried and had a decadent chocolate lava filling inside. I was not expecting that much from the dessert, but it was spectacular. The chocolate tasted a bit dark and the cake itself was yummy, for having panko in it (not used to it being in a dessert). 

We also tried their unfiltered sake (momokawa) and it was pretty good. I'm not a fan of sake and I liked it (:

Prices are high as this restaurant is located in the Crystal shopping mall next to Aria, but service is very friendly and the food is great. Also note that this is a fusion tapas restaurant, which means small portions. The sunrise roll had 8 pieces and the other two had 6 I believe. Sunrise was on the speciality roll list, so it was $22.

First course-Scallop & Caviar Modern Sashimi: Hokkaido Scallp, Petrossian Caviar, Yuzu Foam.
Excellent! Light, citrus, elegant. It was so good to start off. Wish the serving was bigger by just one more scallop, it was that good.

Second course-Salmon Tartare: Scottish Salmon, Ginger Miso, Taro Chip
Incredible! Our favorite of the night, the sauce put it over the top. Probably our favorite of the night.

Third course- Oyster Trio: Kumamoto Oyster, Yama Imo Dashi, Soho Salsa, Ponzu Gelee
Very good, could taste the different flavors across 3 fresh oysters in a half shell. The house oyster was very tasty.

Fourth Course-Ginger Sweetbreads: Crispy Veal Sweetbreads, Sweet Ginger Scallion Sauce, Fuji Apples, Baby Radish
One of my favorites, well seasoned. The sauce put it over the top as a winner. The sweetbreads nicely fried, the sauce was so good!

Fifth Course-Citrus & Fennel Toothfish: Chilean Seabass, Blood Orange Vinaigrette, Pear Tomato, Mizuna.
Very good! The fish melts in your mouth, the sauce delicious and the fennel adds a dash of freshness.

Sixth Course-Angus 300 Petite Tenderloin: Angus 300 Tenderloin, Fole Fried Rice, Bacon Wrapped Enoki Mushroom, Soho Steak Sauce
Almost perfect! Great piece of beef, excellent sauce, flavorful rice but too much rice, about half the size of the rice would have been perfect. I can see how this might be OK as an entree but for a tasting there was too much rice.

Seventh Course-Cher's Nigiri Sushi: Tai, Kanapachi, Maguro, Aji, Ebi
Good sushi, the rice was too much after the previous dish. Would have been perfect just as a small serving of sashimi. Still good!

Eighth course-Banana cake, Peanut Buter Mousse, Valrhona Chocolate Pearls, Banana Ice Cream, Bacon Chips.
ZING! Such a delicious and well balanced dessert! Moist cake, smooth peanut butter mouses, excellent banana ice cream and perfectly crispy bacon bits. Great way to finish off the tasting menu.

Overall, I'm a big fan, we had a great culinary experience. We'll definitely return here again for some of the chef's special dishes.

This is a contemporary, strangely adorned restaurant located in Crystals. The restaurant itself was basically empty when my friend and I entered and were greeted by the hostess. We were sat in the dining room which espouses some kind of odd bordello/bird nest vibe. I say bird nest, because the enormous lighting fixtures above the dining room resembled bird nests made of hair. Take that as you will.

Our waiter (Daniel) arrived and took our drink order. Ice water was ordered and we were delivered room temperature water. Daniel scurried around the restaurant taking care of other tables and disappearing while my friend and I decided upon our Pre Fixe meals. Many minutes later Daniel returned to take our order. 

Daniel insisted the Locomoco was ""just hamburger on rice with gravy"". No really, ""it's just hamburger""; that is after we asked what the entree was and how it tasted. Nice sell, Daniel. Oh and he did beseechingly tell us, ""It's a Hawaiian dish"". Mm hmm. 

Ordered -

Green Tea ($7). Obviously this green tea must have been produced from rainbows from a panda's ass, because never in my life will I ever pay for Green Tea that is $7 ever again. Note to self - ask for drink prices. *face palm*

Miso Soup - decent, perhaps a bit too salty. Very few cubes of tofu and even less green onions.

Chicken Teriykai Donburi - Chicken was dry as a bone. As sad as it is to say I felt as though *I* cooked the chicken in this dish because I ALWAYS overcook chicken. The pickled veggies in the dish were lost on me because I don't eat pickled anything.

Salmon Roll - Decent. My favorite part of the whole meal. Wish I'd just gotten sushi for the whole meal. Although the rolls were on the minuscule side (no wonder, this place is in Crystals on the Strip). 

Food - Mediocre at best, perhaps dinner is better?
Decor - Bordello Bird Nest
Service - Hope Daniel enjoyed his tip as much as he enjoyed being our server, as in, not much.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,3,1,2,gSts4ve-N_c6Nu2vaPZFNQ
4468892,2010-08-25,4,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"My girls + a boy and I went  Social House for a Bachelorette Weekend.  All I can say is they really service you in every which way possible a dining establishment can. Decor check. Charming cute waiter check. Melt in your mouth kobe check. The only thing that possibly made me a little sad was when I saw the bill...my goodness, did those 18 pieces of thin orgasmic meats really cost me nearly 100 bucks?!? That's the most expensive orgasm I've ever had! 

With all naughtiness aside: 

Ambiance: Dark brown hues, with manila lights. Made me feel like I was dining in a ritzy cave in a brightly lit crystal city center mall. It was romantic and everything you would stereotype a Vegas upscale joint.  But somehow, I wished that it was a little brighter so that I could actually see the food. When dining, the appeal plays great tricks to the the belly. In the case of social house, I couldn't see the freshness of the yellowtail carpaccio or its brilliant colors until I went home to check out the pics. Did the yellow tail appeal match its freshness? Absolutely! But if maybe they threw in a couple of candles so I could see my food would I have instant gratification instead of going home 3 days later to find out. 

Service: The waiter was not just your typical waiter. He did whatever he could to serve us in anyway he could. Provided a very charismatic dialogue and never made us feel like we were a bunch of commoners eating in a what could have been a pretentious place. The manager also stopped by to apologize when they had slightly over cooked my dining companions raw steak and was really friendly. In other words, they try to strive per perfection. 

Food: 
I've teased you enough, so without much further ado, the food. We started with a toast to the bachelorette with a red champagne, made with a tint of hisbicus. It was sooo yummy and sweet like a kiss. Not for those of you who likes the taste of liquor because there wasn't even a hint of that taste. Deceptive, because the bride to be and I were a little happy afterwards...drank too fast because it was delicious. 

Appetizers, we had the yellowtail carpaccio with tempura jalepeno, 5oz of thinly sliced Kobe, and toro tartare. Entree of Kobe hanger steak. The yellow carpaccio was absolutely great. The fish melted and the spice from jalepeno was so subtle, I could barely taste it. It provided the perfect crunch. The tuna tartare, lacked a little flavor at the first taste but then the little rice balls injected flavor and flair to its texture. 

The kobe beef, prepared too ways, was fantastic. The garlic-seared kobe was by far superior over the spicy ponzu. Both melted, but the garlic-seared had a unique flavor to it. The Kobe hanger with yuzu egg was very tasty but didn't melt like the appetizer. None the less, it was very tender.  Also had a yellow tail roll with chimchurri, good but was nothing extraordinary in comparison to the rest of the meal.  

For dessert, they had complimentary truffle lollipops..yum...

Conclusion: Social House, I am impressed. But why must you make my  wallet bleed so hard. Fortunately, I live way too far away for you to become one of my new addictions. Because if I were closer, it'd be an abusive relationship and your kobe beef would be doing the ass smacking.",9rHSwmHoqihbaxm3pKKw9Q,2,1,4,axOHb5zKA5pbOkU0j-Yzvg

We were seated upon arriving in the front. Very comfortable chairs and ambiance. We were waited by a young woman named Lindsay. She made the experience for my best friend I one of the best restaurants experiences. She was so warming and helpful with every question we had. We decided to give their 7 course meal a try. No regrets! They prepared us 7 dishes, most not on the menu, to eat. So good! The quality of the food is one of the best I have tasted. Everything was prepared just right. The deserts were another story now. One of the best, well presented deserts ever. We got to try two of them. We requested for the Desert chef to come out since my friend is going to culinary school and thanked her for the amazing treats. 

Overall, a must go to spot. Cant wait to go again and hopefully get the wonderful staff that helped us out!

Since you know, all the celebrities go here. haha. Anyhow, we went to Social House to celebrate a friend's 22nd birthday. When you get to the restaurant inside the hotel, there is a bar and lounge area. To get to the actual dining area, you would walk up a flight of stairs.. The stairwell that takes you up to the restaurant consists of walls adorned with gold safes... It feels like you're in a bank or something. 

Anyhow, didn't get to get a great look at the inside of the restaurant since our group was larger and they sat us outdoors ... No complaints since it was a last minute reservation for a large party. The only complaints were that it was really cold and even though they had heating lamps outside, the lamps were placed in no strategic order whatsoever.. Most of my friends were freezing and they told us the lamps were bolted down even though they werent.

Anyways, on to the food... Before we got our food, I ordered a green tea cocktail that was mMmMMMm yummy. Usually with green tea cocktails, you can barely taste the tea, but they really know how to make a green tea cocktail here. You could taste the blend of alchol and also a strong green tea taste... it was delicious. As for the food, my boyfriend and I shared a shrimp tempura roll, Unagi w/Cream cheese, spicy tuna roll, and also Teriyaki Chicken.

So bottom line about Social House.. Very very good sushi, but also very expensive. But just like Rob T. mentions, if you want to have a good night in a nice restaurant w/good food, then this is for you. Unfortunately, the service we got wasn't so great... Maybe because we were younger, but who knows.

but let me tell you, it's pretty awesome sitting outdoors and having an amazing view of the strip while eating some good sushi... oh, and also a front row , from the top , seat for the TI SIRENS show...

definitely memorable.. not sure if i would return since i can get amazing sushi for a much lower price.. but, this is definitely a great place for ambiance if you're with a group of friends and want to have a nice dinner out before a crazy night out on the strip.",jNsPTMmg9EcqY7q2Q-Rm6A,0,0,4,k_cpqdWTGGmB-abixWdWaQ
4499948,2013-11-13,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"This review is for their social hour (AKA happy hour) as that is what brought me here in the first place. 

So social hour is daily (including weekends) from 5-8PM but ONLY in the bar area which consists of about 6 tables and the bar itself (10 seats?). It is on a first come first serve basis but if it's full when you arrive, you can have the hostess add you to be next to sit in the bar area. The restaurant is a little hard to find as it's in the Crystals mall on the 2nd floor next to Mastro's huge treehouse looking venue. 

So onto the food:

Watermelon Sake - Strong but with a good watermelon taste. Needless to say though, I did not drink much of that. 

Tonkotsu ramen with added pork belly - At $11, this is a steal in Las Vegas. The broth was not bland and the pork belly was a huge slice, not just a scrawny piece. Inside was green onions, bamboo, and bean sprouts. Enough to make me full and suck up my alcohol intake for later on in the night. My friend ordered the miso ramen with pork belly and enjoyed his bowl as well. 

Kobe beef roll - Something new. The beef was crispy which I enjoyed. Don't expect a gigantic roll though.

Angry Tuna Roll - Tempura fried seaweed with fillings of tuna inside the roll. The portion on this roll was more so than the Kobe beef roll but also a more heavy roll in terms of per bite. I prefer the more light taste.

Cod Butter lettuce cup - I really liked this and could have ordered 2 more for myself. The It's lettuce cup with chunks of grilled cod (seasoned well) and crispy noodles on top. Definitely suggest trying this. 

Overall meal came out to be about $70. Both of us were full. Will be back to try other social hour menu items soon!",o2b3y3m4-sT4jUllCn2-oA,5,1,4,js_0Xd2nt8sw-O_2ljO4Fg

The gf and i have been craving Sushi for sometime, so why not wait til Vegas to get our mouth around some yummy stuff! Pretty much started the research once we got into town. Found Social house and made a reservation. Picked a nice time slot, 6pm. We had to be someplace by 7:30 so it worked out. 
We walked up to the place and there were only a few people in the bar area, at first glance the place looked tiny. The Bar wasn't all that big but looked freaking AWESOME! told the hostess my name and she said we'll be seating in 15min, you're more than welcome to sit at the bar and wait. OK! i forget the times on the happy hour but you cant be a beer for $3 in Vegas! 
After waiting our 15min. we were called up to be sat. Walked through some sexy red curtains and BANG right back to the ample seating and awesome decor. We were greeted by our server and told about how the Social House works. I was expecting super small portions but for Vegas and the venue not bad at all! 
We picked up 3 different rolls, the Sun Dried Tomato Roll, Hamachi Roll and the Shrimp Battera. ALL 3 were ultra delicious and almost the best sushi i have ever had!! This was the first place i have picked different rolls and liked them ALL! We also ordered up some butter potato's which were also pretty dang good.

I only had a couple of basics: the spicy tuna roll (cut) and salmon sashimi.    The sushi was quite fresh, but didn't quite hold a light to the sushi I'm used to back in LA.  The desserts were pretty good as well.  I had the apple crisp with ice cream and the warm, gooey chocolate cake (yes, I like to make dessert my main entree).  Service was a bit lacking, particularly in comparison to other Vegas restaurants.  Also, the crowd was really rowdy, but it may have to do with the plethora of drunk guys who seemed to be in Vegas for bachelor parties.  What a shame...the classy ambience of the place made for a great lounge to have great conversation with friends.

I visited on Friday night (11/16) and I still have the Kanpachi Amberjack (baby Hamachi) on my mind. I made a reservation through a phone number that was listed on the website. I came at a fairly early time, 6:30pm, because the restaurant wasn't very busy. My guy and I ate outside on the patio, which is why I recommend making reservations for the choice seating. 

There were two servers, one was supposed to be food, the other beverage. Louis, who was our beverage, was excellent; he ended up being food towards the end of our meal. The other guy was so-so, I don't even remember his name. Louis was very nice and helpful.

We ordered:
Kanpachi Amberjack, Shiromi Whitefish, Miruagi Giant Clam, Spicy Scallop roll, Hamachi Poke w/Cilantro, Garlic Chips & Citrus Soy Sauce, and Yellowtail Tartar.

The Kanpachi Amberjack was by far my favorite; so creamy, just melted in your mouth. Thank god my boyfriend is a sushi aficionado, he knows how to pick 'em! The Yellowtail Tartar also had me moaning. The clam and whitefish were a bit flavorless albeit the clam was very fresh. The best clam I've had was at Sushi Ota in San Diego (plug for them).

I forgot the name of the sake we had, it was called Star something, the Blueberry sparkling one. Hella good!!!!

We ordered the vanilla ice cream with crunchy corn and the little ube (yes they have ube!) dipping sauce for dessert, and since it was my bday they put a lil candle through it. Adorable.

The guy insisted on ordering for me: sunomono (cucumber) salad (the size of a soy sauce dish) and 1 order of tamago (egg) sushi that he split with me.  No joke!  We sat outside and that was my first view of the siren show, ugh.  After that I tore off to Godiva in Fashion Show and bought myself chocolate.  Good riddance.  Fast forward, Social House left TI, and I forgot about it.  Then I was in Crystals one day walking around and saw an ad for desserts in restaurants there.  The yuzu frangipane called my name.

Last night Eric R. and I attended a really cool event at Social House in Crystals.  It was a sake lesson from a sake sommelier, paired with different bites from the food menu.  First we had junmai premium sake paired with yellowtail sashimi with tempura jalapeno, garlic dust, tiny cilantro, and calamansi soy.  Did someone say tempura jalapeno slices?  Yes indeedy.  Next, we sampled another sake, some higher level, paired with big eye tuna sashimi, sweet chili sauce, crispy shallot, red onion, and negi oil.

The next dish was amaaaaazing: nasu spicy miso: small delicate roasted Japanese eggplant with spicy miso glaze.  This was truly delicious!!!  Our last dish was a set of rolls: salmon avocado, hama-chimi (hamachi, avocado, jalapeno-cilantro chimichurri, garlic chips), and negi toro (fatty tuna with green onion).  Our final sake was Ty-Ku coconut flavored nigori (unfiltered).  This was actually really delicious.  I have long been a coconut fan but I am on a huge coconut kick lately.  This one is worth purchasing, and I can get it at Total Wine or Lee's according to the sommelier.

This ended up being a really fun event.  At the end, I ordered the yuzu frangipane, which is made to order because it is a molten cake!  Warm almond cake, molten yuzu cream cheese filling, raspberry sorbet, almond toffee, and fresh raspberries.  It was tasty, more like almond than yuzu.  The idea of it is really good, but I am looking for yuzu to punch my taste buds, so this in the end was not quite yuzu-y enough for me :) and it cost $12.

The staff manning the bar and lounge area were nice and friendly enough, as were my closest neighbors along the bar.  Their aptly named Social Hour Menu is offered from 5pm-8pm daily.  It isn't large, and was pretty much meat-centric, but had a decent variety.

I considered my appetite and decided to go with:

.Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups $10 citrus peel miso cod, bibb lettuce cups, 2 pieces

.Ramen Noodles $8 choice of Tonkotsu or Miso, pork belly add on $2

The cod lettuce cups were pretty tiny in size but completely the opposite on taste.  The miso cod had a richness that reminded me of Chilean sea bass; my favorite (yet sadly endangered) fish.

The ramen was a bit forgetful.  But then I did just so happen to have enjoyed  Santouka's ramen with its spoon-worthy broth and tender pork but two weeks prior.  Admittedly, not quite a fair fight.  But as a filler, it did well enough.  I could have made a nice light meal of 5 pieces of the cod cups, but I doubt they'd have sold me a half order, and at $25, it would a bit heavy on the wallet.

In all fairness, the low rating is based solely on service, so in context, let me say that we arrived around 3pm on a Tuesday and were one of three parties seated in the bar area.  Perhaps it was their intent that one person be served and complete eating their meal before the second person was served in order to facilitate socializing, but we would have been much happier being served at the same time.

The green tea brewed too long before it was served, and it was quite bitter.  Refills on water and other beverages were hard to come by.  Miso soup and Bento box were served at the same time with no real explanation for the delay or the inability to serve the soup first, as is customary.

On the upside? The food tasted great!  And I probably would have enjoyed it even more if I hadn't felt so guilty eating while my companion waited for their food.

It was pretty empty and we were seated immediately.  Our waiter, Byron, was all-pro, offering us the ""we'll take care of you"" menu.  We told him some rolls, and we liked a little crispy, and he delivered:  a plate with four rolls- a something-something-lobster-avocado-something, one with something citrus-y (maybe lemongrass), one with avo and cream cheese, and the ""angry tuna""- a spicy tuna with grilled onions followed by some crispy rice-spicy tuna bites.  All were exquisite, and some of the most complex sushi we've ever had.  Too many ingredients in each one for me to even remember what the main fish was.  He nailed it.

It's a little spendy ($20+ a roll), but when you have that kind of meticulous detail and crazy complex combinations plus service that well-focused (plus it's at Aria on the Strip), it's totally worth it now and then.",YbiBC-LYzb4b6kSHBpjwPQ,1,1,5,Sk6Mq-G_OcyzWUSy_ZAGWg

I'm a huge noodle soup fan, in fact it's one of my favorite foods, and strangely enough, Ramen is not in that group. I've never had a Ramen soup I've really liked, and this includes the famous and much hyped Momofuku Noodle bar in NYC. I've tried Ramen everywhere, and just about gave up when I thought the Ramen at Momofuku blew.  Alas, the ""social"" hour at Social House had great prices and I read great things about their Ramen. So I thought, what do I have to lose, it was a very reasonable price and many others said it was very good. So I went with the pork belly and poached egg, and damn it was the best Ramen I've ever had! It wasn't bland like most Ramen soups, it was very flavorful, and the pork belly was seared just right and had a good amount of meat (unlike most Ramen noodles). The poached egg was also perfectly cooked. While most Ramen is bland, this one had a delicate balance of flavor, meat, noodles, and broth, what supposedly Ramen should be. The harmony created one hell of a noodle soup dish. 

Everything else I got was also good, the kobe sliders were good (came with fries too!), angry tuna roll was good, the salmon avocado rolls were good, there was really only one meh item and that was the Kalbi rolls. Everything else was delicious. The reason why I was able to try all of those dishes was because of the happy hour prices, it was very reasonable. I expected it to be little portions, but they were actually big portions and I shared them with my brother. 

Another big plus were the bartenders, big ups to them, they were some of the coolest and friendliest bartenders I have ever met. They were very friendly and talkative, the type that made you feel good on your vacation/trip. Thanks to them for making the experience at Social House even better. I rarely ever, EVER, eat at the same place on two consecutive days, especially on a trip. This place I had to just because of the great food, great prices, and very friendly bartenders. I even recruited some others to go. That's just how great this place is. I was very pleasantly surprised to find this place on The Strip, in Crystal Malls no less, since everything there was very expensive. Even the drinks were at a great price, it was $3 for a blue moon. You can't go wrong at this place, it nails everything you want when you go out to eat which is really rare: great food, great prices, and friendly service.",8MlBmpm6S2nxeQ5eCgl3rA,3,2,5,CsDgbQAQHgOKd3lIETjwkw

4748095,2009-01-27,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"I've been here 5 times now over the last 2 years, and even my ex-boss who's a total Nobu snob genuinely enjoyed himself when he joined us for dinner. The atmosphere is posh, lighting and decor is very interesting, clientele are varied and the volume can get loud especially as the night progresses. For me, this is just part of the ambiance and--maybe it's just me--but isn't this restaurant called  ""SOCIAL"" house? If you don't appreciate an atmosphere of socializing, perhaps you're better off elsewhere. ;)

When I'm in Vegas for work and want to entertain clients, this is where I take them, and we have never been disappointed. I don't recommend groups larger than 10, though. Nor do I recommend it for a romantic proposal dinner.

This place is relatively expensive, so you're either aware of that and have a corporate account or, if you insist on dining here and cost is an issue, you need to ""order smart."" In my experience, if you order a scallop dish in pretty much any decent restaurant in the country, you're going to get 4/5 medium to large scallops. Yes, it sounds skimpy, but this phenomenon isn't exclusive to Social House. As a general rule, my advice is to stay away from scallops, lobster, traditional steak, and anything resembling a California roll. Besides, there are usually much better items on a restaurant menu so don't be afraid to step outside of your comfort zone, especially at Social House. If you pay an extraordinary price, don't order ordinary food and expect to be dazzled.

I will rank our group favorites, starting with the absolute top choices:

Yellowtail (hamachi) with jalapenos... this dish alone has converted many clients who claimed to dislike raw fish. Simple but absolutely heavenly. Order it, and don't shy away from the little sliver of jalapeno. It isn't that hot, even for a mild palate.

Miso cod... trust me on this one, this is superb. It is a cooked dish, and both the texture and flavor are truly out of this world. Many people hesitate in trying, and yet they all come back for seconds.

Kobe sliders... yup, they are expensive. They are Kobe, after all. And they are really, really tasty.

Seared tuna with ginger... also a very good choice. A classic but it is well done here.

Tocino short ribs... not your traditional ribs. The meat comes right off the bones, and the sauce is divine. 

Sushi/sashimi in general is good, rolls are pretty standard. We always order this stuff last because the items above are so spectacular. Usually we end up wishing we hadn't ordered any rolls at all because we got our fill on everything else and a sushi roll just seems anti-climactic to our now-pleasantly flabbergasted palates.

Warm chocolate cake... probably the best dessert available. We have not been fans of the Blueberry cake and the Lychee beignets were just OK. The mochi are pretty standard, but if you like mochi, go for it.

As for beverages... they have a few different mojitos that tend to go over very well. Sometimes a little too well. Fresh blueberry and pineapple are among the exotic mojito flavors available (they use real fruit). The cold floral sake was also a hit with most people, although you may wish to consult your waiter about the sake options as there are quite a few available.

Balance: ""We were lucky to get the deck table (judging from the other reviews, I guess it's hit or miss with the seating) and it wasn't too hot outside.""

Ceasefire: LV Strip sights and sounds accompanied the conversation and since we were trying a bit of everything, the servers kept the sushi plates coming. Liked the lockbox touch on the steps coming up too, that was different. Recommend the ahi and other fish dishes.
Have to try the kobe burgers next time. Get the yellowtail with extra jalapeno and ""wasabi that fucker."" (It's the new ""superman that ho,"" in case you were wondering.) It's potent. They also kept my sake warm. Good on ya.

The ambiance was pretty hip, definitely a positive for the restaurant (very surprising considering Social House is located inside a mall!) For an appetizer, we ordered edamame and they had a unique way of serving it because half was salted, but the other half had a delicious chili (non-spicy) sauce. Very nice!

For our main courses, we ordered these sushi rolls:
- Angry Tuna 
- Hamachimi roll 
- Tempua Lobster
- Seared Alabacore
- Spider roll

The Angry Tuna was definitely the best and the others were good (not great). For the price points ($20 per roll) I was expecting more.

They really like to seat you when the majority of your party has arrived. they even have a moderate sized seating area. The decor of the entire restaurant was beautiful. very japonesque.

We got on to an elevator and she hostess pressed the VIP level button!! and we got led to a large room with our own bathroom and it was the room that overlooked the wooden drawbridge of Treasure island!! so it was tight! So we had that balcony to ourselves!!! Perfect place for pictures. come a little dressy!

The menu is extremely expensive. but their sushi really does melt in your mouth. but c'mon now $10 for a spicy tuny hand roll that was the size of my three fingers squished together. so thank goodness i had a heavy lunch that day.

but my favorite was the chef special salad : seared ahi tuni, king crab , in a bed of greens with a ginger vinaigrette that was perfectly balanced. a delicious $45 salad.

it is a family style menu. important question to ask is, how many people does each dish serve? and he'll most likely to tell you that it's two people per dish. 

make sure you ask how much a bottle of wine is before you just say ""can we have a bottle of pinot grigio?"" (it was $56.00).

the service reminded me of being in Peru, they arranged your place setting for you and placed the napkins in your lap too. 

the waiter is really great about suggesting items, and please do trust them.  and get the dessert platter. and have him just surprise you with the three choices.

The sushi I ordered at social house- salmon roll and spicy tuna roll were like rolls you can go to the local supermarket and buy. (I, personally would never do that) They were good, but they were so plain and boring. For the price of each roll- you think they would have been spectacular, especially since they are on the menu under ""specialty rolls"" when there was nothing special about them. 

I got the lunch combo for $20. Salad to start off with, it was good. Dressing was good. Second part was the seafood ramen soup. This was interesting. I am a big seafood fan, so I liked it just fine. It had the weird imitation fish floating flower shaped spongy things in it. Never eat those anyways. It had clams, shrimp, mushrooms, ramen noodles, and they give you a side of two different spices one was red and one was a  yellow black color. Didn't know what either of them were, I just tried them on my finger and then dumped them in. I liked the soup. I would order it again if I got the lunch deal. Lastly I got salmon sushi. Plain. Meh. Have had better in little ol' Redding, CA. I had to order an additional roll because I knew I wouldn't be full from the small portions of the lunch special. However, the soup was not small. It was in a rather large bowl with a lot of noodles. (still ate it all)

Husband ordered the $20 lunch special as well, got a spicy tuna roll, deep fried shrimp/veggie tempura, and miso soup. He also ordered an additional spicy tuna roll. He tried a wasabi bloody mary. THAT was interesting. He loves wasabi, so he liked it. I hate wasabi so no thank you. I think it was a $15 tall skinny cup dinky drink. A little while after drinking it he said it gave him an upset stomach. It was probably 90% tomato juice aka bloody mary mix 5% wasabi & 5% alcohol.. (another guy in our group ordered it and said it gave him an upset stomach as well) :-P yuck, IMO.

The decor inside was really nice and pleasing to the eyes. The lighting was dark. It was cool and relaxing with music playing low in the background, almost too romantic for our loud group of friends. They were very friendly, didn't take very long for us to get food and the service was good.

We ended up spending about 86$ between the two of us. Not including tip. We left $100 bill. IMO that was way overpriced for the stomach ache drink and the boring sushi. I don't even recall if I ordered a drink. I wouldn't seek out this restaurant again just because I like colorful, flavorful sushi.

I was exhausted and about 8 Scotches deep and not in a particularly good mode when the food finally came.

As much as part of me wanted to dislike the food; I couldn't do it!  The sushi was surprisingly good, the sashimi was fresh and the rolls were well balanced and proportioned.

Even the Kobe beef roll (I deducted one star because of this atrocity) was tasty in a weird way.  

The sake the server recommended was quite good; since I did not pick up the check I have no idea if it was a good value as well.

Social House is a fusion style Sushi place, which is cool if you like that.  I am sure it appeals to more people who are on vacation.  Being a Sushi purist I don't mind visiting places like this, but they always slightly disappoint.

Everything from the people, the great looking staff to the freshest sushi i have ever have and its coming from a place called TREASURE ISLAND! in the desert with 110 degree weather and a town made for the brave.. alright alright, to the food..

here was my usual in order
1. tip waiter 20 right off the bat and explain to him every 7 mins should be a new sake bottle arriving at the table. no where getting somewhere..
2. waiter comes after about 10-15 mins of my request so me and the social can get to know each other and just to vibe out in this place.
3. ill have the chefs taste for the whole table.. bring it, sushi, sashimi, sake, sexy rolls, (sushi or not) wink wink. yes yes yes, i love this place
4. i order 5 hamachi with fried jalepeno for 7 people.. thats how powerful this dish is... life changing 
5. more sake, talking to tables left and right, cheersing everybody.. is that a word? 
6. i cant describe everythig i eat, between the rib eye and the lobster with the sashimi.. furggetabout it!

i did get kicked out once for too much noise i guess and i told the manager he should go jump on the pirate ship, gamble his life away, and you know the rest.. all good though, we made up and now they are closed but not to worry because supposedly it reopened at the city center.. ARIA!  so basically, the social house will never be the same and the special people who got to get the full expirience, congrats!

Long story short - This place was very trendy - the staff was great, but the food was just ok. We went for lunch and they had a fixed menu option for $20 (great value) You get 3 items - preselected items of course. Myself i did the miso soup, chicken teriyaki, and spicy tuna roll with bottled water. The miso soup was very high in sodium, The chicken teriyaki bowl was good in portion and the chicken was cooked good, but the sauce and season  was lacking. The Spicy tuna roll tasted like pre made stuff at whole foods. The highlight of my meal was my fuji water. It came in a custom made chill cup made of metal. I didn't know it was $10 until i got the bill. 

The fact that Tony Hawk was dining next to us and greeted us on the way out - probably isn't enough to get my to eat here again. I will still recommend this place because of the lunch prefix menu and the value that has.

Our promoter was able to get 12 of my girls comped for a 7 course meal, and so we went!

Our hostess sat us down upon seconds of arrival and that's always a plus.  There was then some trouble and miscommunication with our dinner getting comped, but after everything was settled, we started our meal.  However, I would like to add that the management was very professional and nice at all times.  Usually other places would give you attitude and etc and would make you feel unwelcomed, but this place did no such thing.

We started off with edamame.  The edamame in chilli sauce was different!  But a good different!  Followed by the salad which was lightly dressed and decent, nothing too out of the normal.  The third dish were these beef tacos.  This was my ABSOLUTE favorite!  It wasn't a normal hard shell, and everything just came together nicely!  Great flavor and texture made it all that much better.  The sushi rolls were forgettable (california roll, tuna roll and salmon roll).  The dessert was pretty good.

Well, we showed up at 8pm on a Saturday night and there was no reservation in our name - not sure who's fault that is though. So luckily there was a table set up in their bar area and we were able to squeeze our group of 5.

Service was a bit random, our waitress was pretty weird and would start a conversation and then just walk away. When asked what she recommended, she didn't have much to say. My friend waited at least 5 minutes to get her attention to get some soy sauce - he had just ordered sushi so it was a bit awkward for him to wait while we started eating.

The food was pretty solid though - we got the edamame, the potstickers which were good and the tempura veggies, also good. I got the ribeye steak. it was a lot of meat and properly cooked, but I should have noted that it was going to be drenched in teryaki sauce. The shoestring potatoes were just sprinkled over the top (they're not like french fries).

5094750,2011-10-06,5,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"Contemporary decor matched with diverse selection of  trendy, modern interpretations of Japanese food.  A great combination.

The food is bold.  Flavors always pronounced.  No dish is overly delicate and it works perfectly in a social setting with good drinks and great friends.  It is a running theme at social house that you should be social.  Share your food.  Portions are large and with the exception of mains are plated to be shared.

The cold starters are all very fresh.  Top props to the yellow tail. Each piece topped with a jalapeno slice, micro cilantro, a hint of garlic (garlic dust), and a tart but salty calamansi soy.  The subtle flavor of the fish is quickly lost but its texture is the perfect foil to the bold flavors.  The toro tartar is also worth a try.  Love the texture from the arare (Japanese rice crackers).

The rock shrimp tempura starts the list of great hot dishes. Sweet shrimp surrounded by a fluffy yet crisp outside and served with a spicy ponzu dipping sauce.  Perfect with any drink.  The citrus peel miso cod in a lettuce cup is phenomenal.  Deeply infused miso flavor and a juicy peace of fish.  Add the sauteed foie to it and the richness will blow your mind.

Sushi? The crispy eel, shrimp tempura, avocado, with a spicy aioli and teriyaki unagi sauce make for GREAT eats.

Several visits and the food never disappoints.

Service is very good and never intrusive.

Although there is a good and fairly priced wine list,  its more fun sampling their cocktails and matching it with the food.

Saw their advertised lunch prix fixe starting at $20.  The Tonkotsu Ramen stood out to me....but how does it fare considering the location?

I started off with the Sunomono. This was a little bland IMO. I would try the soup or salad next time.  Nothing really stood out to me here, and yes, I have had some great renditions of this simple dish :)

Tonkotsu Ramen Noodles ($5 add). This was delicious! Much better than I was expecting actually. The Pork was cooked to a crisp on the edges, so it had a nice consistency and flavor, but the insides were a little less tender than others around town.  Solid choice though!

Third Course : Spicy Tuna Roll. This was ok...decent flavor in the roll and fish tasted fresh.  Don't expect anything out of the ordinary here.

And to finish, I wasn't sure if I was going to order dessert or just a drink.  But when I saw this choice on the menu, it seemed like a good mix of both :

Blue Yuzu Ice Cream Float ($15): Grey Goose Le Citron, Blue Curacao, Fresh Yuzu Juice, Virgils Cream Soda and Vanilla Ice Cream. This was surprisingly tart from the yuzu juice. It was very overpowering, so if you aren't a fan of yuzu, stay away! If you enjoy yuzu though, it's pretty tasty...just very tart.

Overall, lunch felt a tad spendy at $25+, but considering the location and how good the Ramen was, I would say it was worth it!

Give it a try...esp if you are craving ramen in the area :)

It was very delicious - very fresh fish, real wasabi, and great service. It was so good that we went back for another meal on Sunday evening. This time, it was a completely opposite experience. 

We ordered the sashimi platter again, but this time the fish was not fresh at all. The cut of tuna sashimi that they served was not only not fresh, but also a horrible cut with tendon and very chewy. I had a stomach ache after for an hour or so. 

We also ordered two of the modern sashimi platters - one with Yellowtail and the other with albacore. It was obvious that it was not freshly made as the server brought it out literally 1 minute later, and it tasted like they just took it out of the fridge. Gross. 

When I asked why the fish was not fresh, the server just gave me some not relevant BS answer about how the fish is flown in from Alaska. Horrible service!

Reservations for the patio overlooking the pirate show were easy on a Thursday night and the crowd was a mixed bag of older rich guys with their wives and younger hipsters wearing True Religion.  Like everywhere else in Vegas, however, it isn't as much about how you look as how you spend.  

Seating was prompt and the servers were quick......too quick, IMO, to suggest the most expensive menu items when my buddy asked for recs.  Admittedly, though, he was knowledgable of the menu and knew how to guide my non-sushi-loving friend to some safe choices.

Throughout the course of the meal we selected and sampled the Tempura shrimp with cold udon and sweet sauce, Unagi Avocado Rolls, Kobe Tartare Roll, Jalapeno Hamachi Tartare, Cracklin Scallops with grilled eggplant, Chocolate Lava Cake, and Mochi.  Each dish was delicious and my friend raved the Kobe roll so much I actually ate beef for the first time in 7 years (what happens in Vegas, I guess.)  Particular standouts were the flawless Scallops and the Cherry Blossom Mochi.

After the pirate show (from an AWESOME angle directly behind and w/o the crowd) we made our way out to the bar area, and although not particularly my 'scene' had a great time.  The waitress was friendly (not to mention gorgeous,) the drinks were pricey but tasty, especially the espresso Martini, and the crowd was fun.

All told, for a ""scenester"" sushi club, the place is nice and the fish is much fresher than most places of the like.  If you're looking for a place with a good view of the strip, some dinner time entertainment, a happening scene afterwards, and decent prices (expected Vegas Markup) for the food quality I'd say Social House might fit the bill.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,2,1,4,jqMAEsZrIwrq4FnFQolEzA

Social House is a surprisingly hipster place in the Crystals Mall with high-quality stylish food and good saki.  But, service was a bit odd.  It was late in their dinner cycle when they accepted our dinner reservation.  Yet, it seemed they wanted to rush us out.  The timing seemed off as many items took far too a long to arrive while other items arrived super quickly.

Food = 4.5 stars
Service = 3 stars
Ambiance:
* Upfront by bar = 5 stars
* In the dark back of restaurant = 2.5 stars

Story...
We made reservations for 9:30p.  Arrived at 9:32p.  Yet, it look a very long time to seat us and it wasn't that crowded.  We asked if we could sit at the very stylish bar, but they opted to put us all way in the far back room at hugely wide table that made conversation difficult within our group and with the server.

While the food was pricy, it was super tasty.  Everything was of very high quality, including the rice, which was perfect - flavorful and not too starchy.  

Yellowtail Jalapeno Sashimi - 5 stars ($22)
OUTSTANDING!  Amazing subtle flavors.  Would order another again in a heartbeat.

Spicy Tuna Roll - 5 stars ($13)
Awesome combinations of flavors!  One of THE best we've ever had.

Hamachi Yellowtail NIGIRI - 4 stars ($12)
Very good.  Super tender, but with solid texture

Sake Salmon NIGIRI - 4 stars ($12)
Creamy texture with good salmon flavor

Salmon Mango Roll- 5  stars ($22)
WOW!  Wonderful flavors and textures with a sweetness almost akin to dessert.

We might go back, but there are many so other sushi restaurants to try here in Vegas first.",OpzqHzqod7FZusRzin5KRg,2,2,4,AyacMEvRLcuKYuYH5_R4BA
5323956,2013-07-22,1,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"Came here on a Saturday for the ""Social Hour"" menu that's offered from 5pm-8pm.  Their social hour menu features deep discounts on drinks and appetizers ($5-9 per plate as opposed to $15-18 normally).  We didn't have a reservation, we were just looking for a place to grab a bite before going to see a show.  

The location is a little weird - inside the Crystals mall across from Stella McCartney - but that didn't detract from its atmosphere, which is otherwise cool, understated, and fashionable.  I'm not sure why the hostess asked for my first and last name before seating us, because she didn't ask for any contact info afterwards to solicit feedback on our experience... oh well.  

The service was prompt and multiple waiters were constantly coming to our table to ask if we needed anything else.  Our waiter was also very knowledgable about the menu and components of each dish.  

There's a moderately sized bar area where a group of women were gathered for the happy hour drink specials... most were dressed in cocktail dresses ready to take on the town, but a few were in yoga pants and fluorescent headbands.  One of the less attractive consequences of a mall location, I guess.  

Tried the tonkotsu ramen from the social hour menu, which is a full size bowl for $8 but does not include any of the usual add-ins... you can add pork belly, poached egg, fish, and other things for an additional fee.  It wasn't the BEST ramen I've EVER had (once you've had Underbelly in SD, other ramens just don't compare) but it was definitely palatable.  The Thai beef lettuce wraps appetizer was definitely large enough to share.

The miso soup was so salty and the flavor was just.. a weird indescribable flavor that I can't explain but it just was not good. The ramen wasn't horrible, edible but I wouldn't say it's anything special. It does come with some spice and roasted garlic flakes on the side that's really delicious in the ramen.

I have had dinner here multiple times, each time for some fair eventful evening, and each experience very good.

The Social House is located (in case you didn't know) inside the Treasure Island.  It has a bar on the casino floor corner where you wait to be escorted up a very sleek stairwell to the second floor where there is the dinning.  The layout of the restaurant is very unique and echoes that of many high end restaurants in LA... the beautiful thing is that the cost is less then those of similar architecture.  

If you loathe the pirate show you should not dine here, if you like it and its nostalgic Las vegas feeling as i do it really adds to compliment your evening on this second story dinning experience at the Treasure Island. 

This is a Japanese based restaurant, the food is good to great and the environment is alive and hip... a very unique energy... a lot of buzz with out the pounding annoyance.

Great location, enjoyable atmosphere, and good food put this joint at 4-5 star rating.  Left rating at 4 star for the all too familiar ""wonderful"" attitudes of the Las Vegas employees...",PXIuvdfDP_dUkd-zGxl2sQ,1,0,4,pLzJ07BH7zFnKwbfJSseeQ

I got the angry tuna roll and it was divine. It is on the smaller side so you will have to order something else to satiate your appetitie, but I was OK with not choking on the size of the sushi when trying to consume it!  I got the ramen soup next, which is like my new favorite thing, and it was really tasty as well. 

The bartender that was serving us was excellent, gave us his recommendations [including what not to order] and was extremely attentive.  Other great news about sitting at the bar is they have TV's for football watching!!! Hooray TV's and Football!

Selected the miso soup, chicken teriyaki donburi, and a spicy tuna cut roll. The miso soup ran a tad bit on the salty side, while the chicken in my main entree was extremely overcooked (bone dry). Even the heavily teriyaki sauced rice could not help the chicken gain any moistness. The best part of the meal was the sushi, which I suppose I would order next time if I were to again return to this restaurant. 

Service was hit and miss. The waitstaff were very nice, but our food took ages to come out (almost an hour). We almost thought that they had forgotten about our order. I also told the hostess that it was my friends birthday, expecting the restaurant to do the whole bday thing for him. They brought over some mochi ice cream (which was pretty good), but charged us for it! I didn't exactly order the thing, I just expected a small token and an embarrassing song or something.

Spicy tuna on crispy sticky rice - I think Koi (with a location right across the street) is the original, but the version here was even better. It was perfect - spicy, crispy, chewy, contrasty, yummy with a different note from baby cilantro ad a sliver of jalapeño.

Hamachi with jalapeno was a touch different also, the sliver of pepper deep fried. It was (rather surprisingly) a nice generous portion, and the fish was pristine.

The shishito peppers were the usual fun tasty game of palette roulette but they had an added element which the menu said was lemon miso. Not sure I got the lemon note, but it was really good.

And finally the duck buns, hoison sauced duck on chewy bao buns with pickled cucumbers, are divine. 

Good sake list,  some interesting cocktails, and very attentive service round out what was an almost perfect experience.

The down sides: the salad dressing on the house salad was grotesque - they'd be far better off using bottled ginger dressing.  And the usual Vegas WTF over music - house-trance club music blasting throughout the restaurant with no refuge (maybe under the tables?) - what's up with that? If you're dropping $125+ per head on dinner is it really necessary to try and annoy you so you want to get up and go ASAP (that seems to be the Vegas dining plan).

First Impression:  What is with the safe deposit boxes?  Other than that, this place is amazingly designed and rather maze-like.  It's nice to get lost somewhere other than between slot machines and chain smokers.

We sat on the patio in the evening.  It was nice, end of summer night. Unfortunately the Sirens show was cancelled due to high winds (although I'd seen it before and it would definitely ruin the mojo of the restaurant).

I LOVE family style.  Lets me try a whole bunch of new things and not having to eat huge quantities of anything.  Although I'm sure it wasn't so fun for one of my buddies who is a more tentative eater.

The cocktails were decent -- I got the green tea one.  Never had anything like it.  Had a second one.  It was good, but not mind-blowing.

The food, however, was right up my alley.

Scallops are a weakness of mine.  These were AMAZING.  We also got the jidori chicken breast (very tender), lobster curry salad (light and perfectly done), house salad (decent), sesame noodles, yellowtail sashimi, and some rolls.

Everything we had here was wonderfully delicious, and the view from the patio made the experience even better.

We ordered the ahi special, the seared scallops with eggplant, the citrus peel miso cod, edamame, a bottle of sake (forget which one) and some rolls for the table.  All of them were very tasty.  I'd say that scallop dish is up there with the best scallop dishes I've ever had-and I'm a big scallop fan.  The miso cod was the closest to Nobu's cod in terms of quality and taste out of all the miso cods i've tried-although it was a little too sweet.  I'd also like to mention that the edamame was cooked well-something that many upscale Japanese restaurants do not get right!  It came out warm, soft and SALTED.  In addition, our server Jared was down to earth and a pleasure to talk to.

The ambiance was nice as well-I'd say its better than Nobu's ambiance-they have a large patio that overlooks the strip.  Perfect for taking first timers visiting Vegas.  The crowd is hip and young, but the quality of the food shines through the fluff.  I will definitely be back.",4k9-LoufKfGflVzQfmkrdw,2,3,4,sxLvRNV-1zz3roSuFG7STw

My absolutely awesome girlfriends surprised our lovely bachelorette with a great sushi feast. We were there for fun, for drinks and some food to keep us going for the rest of the evening. Our servers were awesome and chose a 5-6 course since we were indecisive. They chose some great dishes. My fave was the cod lettuce wraps - yummy in my tummy!

Social House is on the pricier side and I later learned we were charged $60 for 6 bowls of rice. WTF - who charges $60 for rice? However, it was worth the good laughs and raucous we caused as a group ;)

There was only 1 other table seated inside and nobody in the lounge.  Also, I thought that it wasn't that easy to find.  Crystals is pretty massive, and the restaurant is on the backside of the 2nd level, near Wolfgang Pucks.

Anyhow, I really like the decor and the lighting.  This would be a great place to go on a date.  The hostess was very friendly and welcoming, and our server approached us immediately.  She was happy to answer any questions the group had and also to make recommendations.  The only down side was being told that the kitchen was making ""last call,"" when we hadn't really had enough time to look over the menu.  We also had to decide if we wanted dessert BEFORE we ordered.  But, I guess that's what happens when you are the last reservation of the night.

I am not a big sushi eater, so there isn't much I can say in that regard.  However, the rest of my group ordered rolls and a sashimi platter and they really liked everything.  Their favorite was the angry tuna.  I had the hamachi tartare, which had a great ""kick"" to it and the garlic dust was an amazing addition.  I also ordered the kobe tacos, which were PHENOMENAL.  I don't know what they do to them, and I feel like an idiot ordering kobe tacos at a Sushi restaurant....But I swear, they were amazing.  The shells were homemade and had a nice crunch to them.  The beef wasn't greasy at all, and the pickled cantaloupe was an awesome addition. I also tried the SH Red Champagne, which was refreshing and delicious.  The hibiscus flower in the bottom is a nice garnish, and edible too.  Although, I thought it tasted like a soggy fruit roll up (not necessarily a bad thing haha).

I thought the prices were pretty typical for a strip sushi restaurant.  Nothing seemed TOO outrageous, IMO.  Also, there was the strangest mix of music playing, I didn't think it matched the restaurant at all.

Overall, I loved the ambiance and the service was great.  I would definitely go back and I will definitely recommend it to friends who visit from out of town.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,2,1,4,OKRwLbTpYzzWCmY5ZRihoQ

Everything was delicious -  kobe sashimi, scallops, braised beef, mango pudding and these leche donuts, holy crap! I drank too much saki so I honestly don't remember it all.

At the end the chef came to talk to us. When he found out we were local he told us to come back and make sure we mentioned we were locals who had been there before so he could make sure we got to try something different.

I only tried out 3 things off this HH menu and that's really all I need. They've got ramen -- choice of either tonkotsu or miso. And of course, my personal favorite is tonkatsu. 

The broth is delish! It might possibly be my favorite broth here in Vegas :0). My friend said it was better than the last time she came here, too. 

The noodles were a bit too soft for my liking but still good nonetheless. Maybe next time I can request firm noodles or something. 

We also ordered angry tuna and salmon avocado rolls. Yums. Both are good but I especially love salmon + avocado so that's a winner. They're $8 per order for the rolls. $8 for the ramen as well. 

Service for food was as expected but the ramen will take awhile to come out. We finished with our rolls and the ramen still wasn't ready. The hostess just gave I'm-stuck-up vibes though but everything else in terms of service was good. I will be back! :0)

5743765,2012-04-05,4,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"I love ""family style"" Japanese restaurants. Even though ""family style"" may remind you of Bucca Di Beppo, I assure you this is nothing like that!  

Let's break it down for you... order a plethora of items and dig in! I love when you can trust a server to pick out the best items and just let them go for it!  We just told them a price point per person we wanted to stick with and off he went.  Honestly, for $60 per person, we ended up with A LOT of food.  I was a little nervous, considering Japanese can get pricey, but by the end of the meal I could hardly finish the last dish (although I did:)

I think the marinade for each sashimi we got made each one, topped with the extremely fresh fish made those the stand outs of the evening for me. I thought they were all killer and would recommend any of these:

Yellowtail Jalapeno - garlic, cilantro, calamansi Soy with a fried jalapeno to top
Salmon Wasabi - wasabi crème, lemon Soy, crispy shallot, chives
Fluke Soy Salt - chili Oil, soy salt, citrus
Kobe Sashimi - a play on thinly sliced kobe beef, yumm-o!

We also ordered the Cod Bibb Lettuce Cups. I thought the contrast between the cool lettuce and fried cod was really good.  I know this wasn't a favorite of the table, but I really enjoyed it!

Our last course was the sushi. The angry tuna roll was pretty amazing. I mean, deep fried sushi roll? Who wouldn't love it! The seared albacore was good and so was the yellowtail, but angry tuna, the star of the show, for sushi at least. 

I would definitely recommend making a reservation before you get to Vegas, but one thing I will note is that we came in around 7pm and the place was dead, so you may be able to squeeze in last minute.

My mom did not even like it and so poor thing could not eat anything since she does not like Sushi.  So the food was OK, but not worth the price.

5806912,2007-06-22,0,4hG2j_ibsNblDgqei05U_g,"Social House is part of TI's continuing makeover. It offers a modern take on Japanese food, as well as the obligatory sushi bar. However, Social House is a little more than that. Operated by the same people that run Pure at Caesars Palace, it's designed to be half restaurant and half lounge. At night, the dining tables convert into cocktail tables.

Social House's chef left Nobu to work here. The overall feel of the menu reflects his Nobu roots, but with some new twists. Choices include Kobe taro chips with peanut sauce, coconut lemon grass soup, citrus peel miso cod, soy mirin kurobuta pork belly, and tamarind short ribs. The sushi bar serves up the usual suspects.

The feel of the place varies according to where you sit, and when you go. There's a sushi bar, a couple of other bars, indoor seating, and outdoor seating. Late at night, the place turns into a hybrid restaurant/lounge; the high tech tables adjust to become smaller and more lounge like.

During early evening hours, Social House feels mostly like a restaurant. I ate in the lounge. It has dark wood floors and dark wood tables. The lighting level is low, provided mostly by small lights hanging in dozens of wooden bird cages suspended from the ceiling. Moderately loud Latin American music, with a heavy beat, is playing. The lounge partly faces the Strip - and TI's pirate show. An interesting twist!

Sesame Kelp Salad was a pretty good version of a standard dish. The green seaweed was tender yet crunchy, with sesame seeds and enough sesame oil to give it flavor. It was a very large portion, and would have been a good candidate for sharing.

I followed that up with Orange Peel Miso Cod, plus a bowl of steamed rice. Not so long ago, this would have been deemed exotic; nowadays, it's pretty common. However, that's not to say it wasn't good. Indeed, the fish was soft yet flaky, cooked just right. The sweet-but-not-too-sweet glaze was nicely flavored.

Social House prides itself on its sake selection. I'm not a sake expert, but it's fun to try different types. This is a good place to experiment. The sake was served in a very attractive bamboo carafe, with matching bamboo cup; a nice touch.



I'm having some trouble providing an evaluation because I had just one simple meal, and I wasn't around late enough in the evening to see what the place was like as a night spot. As a spot for a light early dinner, I'd say it's pretty good, with reasonable prices.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,0,2,3,ThY9QFsvuPs9U5zzlvbV1Q

- Citrus miso cod lettuce cups
- Kobe beef tartar

We started w/ the sashimi trio. the yellowtail had creme de fresh, which I thought was odd, but was most excellent. There was also a type of soy sauce put on the third portion of the trio, that is rare in most parts of the world, and was very tasty. 

Next was the toro (Blue Fin Tuna)! There were these little cracker balls in the sauce it was served with that made for great texture contrast.  An amazing dish.

Next course was the largest seared sea scallops I've ever seen! Also, we had the striped sea bass, which was probably the climax of the entire meal. The Sous Chef ,Jake (who you may know from Bouchon???) prepared this so perfectly. 
At this point I was full, but not finished. Jake brought out the ultimate roll and one other roll, that memory fails to recall. The ultimate roll was the goddiest roll ever. Covered in raw kobe beef on the outside, and all kinds of other pricey goods inside, this roll was rediculous. I wish I had ordered it earlier, when my appetite was still present...done? Nope! Sous Chef Jake brought a custard type dessert that was very excellent and a bread pudding that I absolutely had to finish!

I was here recently for an event.  While waiting I decided to try their ramen as a friend who used to work here said it was really good.  Plus I read a few reviews that had positive feedback on their dining experience here.

Service at the bar:  Efficient, not particularly friendly, but knowledgeable about their menu offerings.  Food came out fast!

Food:  Tonkotsu Ramen with Chasu and Poached Egg.  Broth was okay, not particularly rich or creamy, but also not too salty (which is more of the traditional Japanese ramen broth style). Noodle was cooked, but still had clumps where it did not separate during the cooking process (sadly disappointing).  I liked the fried garlic pieces, which added to the flavor.  I would not add Sriracha, which they offered automatically, if I wanted it spicy.  (Pretty much the same experience that Candace C had 2 years ago).  Chasu was inconsistent.  One piece was light in color, with decent fat on it and was tender.  The other piece, was clearly darker, as if it had sat out unwrapped, and the exterior was also partly burnt (not just a nice seared, but charred to carbon).  Overall, it was not the Debbie N's ramen experience that I had hoped for. I trust both of these Yelpers' opinions, which are night and day differences, so consistency appears to be an issue.

Price:  For ramen it is more expensive than the other local ramen option, which we now have a lot.  So mega resort pricing in effect.

I would like to come back and try other items on the menu, especially with 50% off dinner food purchases with their Social House Tomodachi (Friends of Social House) Card.  But for now, it was just a sub par 2 stars experience.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,3,2,grJHmsIoeTCaDp2WZ4I4sA

I was told portions were more tapas style, but the portions are wwaaayyy bigger than tapas style. Here's what I had:

Citrus Peel Miso Cod: A good 8 ounce portion with awesome flavor and almost marshmallow like in texture. I wish I wasn't so full byt he time this came because I REALLY wanted to finish it.

Kobe Tataki Sushi roll: MMmmm...this one made me drool. A Shitake Mushroom roll topped with Med rare slices of Kobe beef. The beef was super tender and the sauce brought out so many flavors.

Cold Noodles with a creamy sesame sauce and tempura shrimp. This was hubby's favorite thing ever! Somehow I'm supposed to find out how this is made...

Hubby also had an assortment of nigiri and the Lobster Curry roll which looked good, but I didn't taste. He said it was fabu!

Carrot Cardamon Cake. holy shit. can I eat this for every meal the entire time in Vegas? Because I would like to.

Food: Decent. Really nothing special. Here's what we ordered:

Sunomono salad- bland. I had to add a ton of soy sauce to it to make it edible. I wish I would have gotten the green salad. 
Shrimp Tempura Donburi- just okay. Very small portion of shrimp. 
Salmon Avocado Cut Roll- awful. I have had better sushi off the strip.

Miso Soup- he remarked that it was average. It had almost a smoky taste, which he enjoyed, but it wasn't good enough to make him want to go back.
Chicken Teriyaki Donburi- he noted it was a hair over cooked and nothing special.
Spicy Tuna Cut Roll- he said it was not spicy and not very flavorful. 

Prices: The Lunch Prix Fixe is the way to go. It's an okay amount of food for $20. I was still hungry after my meal. I also don't think the quality of the food lives up to the price. I would charge $15 for the portion size and quality of the prix fixe.

Atmosphere: The restaurant itself is really lovely. I love the decor and the vibe. It's a very comfortable and chic setting. 

Overall, I am not interested in visiting this place for a third time. I gave it two good tries and am still unimpressed.",MBtZDus_PXanqTEjUTNxCQ,0,0,2,10yizprOQ-ufYRHZQwT41Q
