2922,2015-04-29,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,Horrible service. Long waits even with many open tables and sketchy wait staff. We put $100 in the check fold and the waiter brought it back to us saying there was only $80 in there. I asked if he could check to see if a bill fell on the floor but he hardly looked. When i spoke to the manager he showed little interest and never called me back. DONT GO!,yRl_qaXNNX7EAhwtjgEobg,0,0,1,oeRZYMMEi_G41UO795Ueig

Made reservations for 7:30pm tonight. Went in, couldn't get sat until 7:40 because the server was too busy to handle another table. Well I can tell you right now there were only 8 tables sat in the entire restaurant, I walked around and looked. We ordered drinks right away. 3 waters, a kids root beer, and a blackberrry mojito. At 8:05pm, we still had not got our drinks. 25 mins after we ordered them. So I went and told the host. 5 minutes later, our server comes back by  and says ""I'll bring your drinks out in a minute, the bar is just really busy."" And I literally looked at him and went ""for my freaking water?"" And he was like ""I want to wait for everyone to get their drinks at the same time"" No! Bring me my water. It's been 30 minutes for some f-ing water! So 30 minutes for water and 40 minutes for a mojito? Seriously? What kind of establishment are you guys running. Finally takes our order. He walked away while we were trying to tell him to add an extra portion for the kid that was with us so we told the manager. We also told the manager multiple times we were not happy with the server or experience and the manager just shrugs us off basically. Server comes out with cheese. Alpine, and the Wisconsin cheddar. Well, that's what we ordered at least. What he brought out was the Wisconsin trio, which has bleu cheese in it, which I'm deathly allergic to. Had he not said it was the trio, I wouldnt have known until after I took a bite, and then I'm being rushed to the hospital because you like to hire incompetent staff. He fixed it. Cool. Water refills get low, very low. He's nowhere to be found. Our cheese has been long done and it's sitting on the table burning and stinking. Probably about 30 minutes we sat there with no water and burning cheese. Manager actually walked past and I flagged him down for more water and told him again we were unhappy. Shrugs us off. Server comes over to remove cheese. We order chocolate. Chocolate comes out. We eat it. Again, no water refills for a long time. Burning chocolate on the table. Drops off check. Leaves burning chocolate. We pay, we leave. Burning chocolate is still on table. Very rude server. All night he had an attitude, slamming things on the table, etc. I'm a server myself. I had just got off from my serving job. If my manager had heard I let a table go 30 minutes without water, I would've been fired on the spot probably. If a table had complained to the manager that they were unhappy, the manager would not have just shrugged them off. Worst dining experience ever. Will not come back. Not worth the money. $20 for our bowl of cheese. $20 for a bowl of chocolate. These bowls are literally the spice of a small dogs dish. I've bought cheese from Walmart in a jar for like $5 and it's a larger portion than what I got here. Please do not come here. 2 and a half hours I was there for some cheese and chocolate. Not worth the time and money.",mET9D3Kk0k2sWxslVGKPBw,0,0,1,NdEjukz0Eg92iOvMK8E0BA

My friend spoke Ashley the hostess who told her happy hour was from 5to 6 and the last hour 7 days a week. WRONG! on saturday we got there just after 5 only to find out that happy hour on Saturday and Sunday is from 4-5. The hostess was so rude about it and my sweet friend is a force to be reckoned with. The manager honored the happy hour price for the food which was a very nice gesture but the hostess from the very beginning was not at all apologetic she was extremely cold and rude. Like she was pissed that the manager had helped us out. She sat a table next to us and was all smiles and sweet as can be. Unfortunately this is the only melting pot in Las Vegas, and it is a wonderful date spot. I will return only because the manager was so helpful our server was sweet and the food was good! But please know your Hostess is the first impression of any business and as a person who has hundreds of options on where to spend my money when it comes to dinner her impression matters!",6X3--JJwPaCcNEGhhl90Yg,3,0,3,R3mhfR4QGf1JpksVSLVenw

When you come here, be prepared for AT LEAST a 2 hour meal.  It might go faster if you skimp on the number of courses.  We had all four so it took us awhile.  We had a cheese, salad, entree, and dessert course.

Since we are a group of 6, we had up to 2 choices of cheeses as well as cooking styles for the entree later on.  Both cheeses were good - the spinach and artichoke and the special from the Big Night Out - which had a whole brie in it! Cheese are served with bread and some veggies.

I liked the mojo, and the coc au vin would probably have been better had the alcohol form the wine (poured in at the table) cooked out.  We picked out 3 a la carte entrees, and that was plenty for 6 of us.  We, after all, had to save room for the dessert.

Dessert is on a separate menu and there's a lot to choose from.  Since we were all pretty full, we just got one large dessert (instead of 2 regular sized) to share.  It comes with marshmallows, cheesecake, strawberries, bananas, pound cake, and brownie.  The chocolate was flambeed (oooh, fire) and was totally yummy. (We got the one with marshmallow, I cannot remember the name of it).

We started off with several delicious drinks, which are not too expensive. We got the Swiss Cheese Fondue to start. Yum! Comes with apples, veggies and bread. Then we both ordered the California salad. You could almost make a meal out of just those two items. 

We got the Fondue Fusion and it came with Filet Mignon, Lobster, Chicken, Shrimp, Pork, and Sirloin. We ordered the mojo cooking style which is a citrus and it is good! It also comes with red potatoes and veggies. The server brought out about 8 different sauces. All good! 

We ended with chocolate turtle desert fondue. So good. 

Warning, if you don't want to cook your own food, dont come here. If you are in a hurry, dont come here. If you dont like fondue, dont come here. If you dont like simple preparation, dont come here.

It took over 30 mins to get our entr√©e of meats, haven know it was raw meat we were gonna b served I would have asked what took so long. The food was good with great flavor. Cooking times were a bit off and I didnt wanna get sick.

Finally, after waiting for our server to come back so we could order desert we got the hostess attention. Then our server came back within 5 mins  and cleared our table. We told her bring the desert and the bill.

At first I was skeptical about the whole cooking process -- this was my first fondue experience. But I am still alive so the stuff did cook! 

Best part: Disaronno Meltdown for dessert (white chocolate and amaretto). YUMMY!! 

I would definitely recommend this place for the food and experience. It was a bit on the pricier side. We just happened to drop in without reservations about 30 mins before closing (unbeknowest to us), and they were gracious enough to take us anyways. I felt bad because we kept our waiter like an hour past closing but he was so cool about it, we left him a huge tip.

301451,2017-01-17,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"I have been to the melting pot in Saint Petersburg Florida and that was phenomenal! Wanted to go again and went to the one in Vegas! Still phenomenal as always! But this one was different then the one in Florida and it was still great!

TYLER is amazing! If you can get him he is interactive and so funny! Made the experience that much better to kinda have dinner and a show!

At this melting pot they do EVERYTHING in front of you! They made the cheese fondue, the cooking styles, and the chocolate fondue. In Florida they made it in the back and then would bring it to us and we would dig in. In Vegas apparently they do not have a kitchen just a prep area which we thought was so cool. The only bad thing about that is that you can't just dig in you have to wait for the cheese to be ready but soooo worth it it's just a tease!

Portions were perfect for everyone at the table! One thing different from Florida is that in Florida that have a FONDONE option which they cook all your meats in the back and then bring you the cooked meats and the ready made broth you chose. They didn't have that option in Vegas but I think that's better because you get the full experience of fondue! We were there for about 3 hours so plan accordingly you might be there for awhile if you get the 4 course meal!

I recommend that classic alpine cheese fondue! Our favorite cheese so flavorful I could bathe in it if it wasn't so hot. Mojo cooking style had so much flavor in the broth to cook everything in! Recommend flaming turtle and bananas foster you get a flame show with that which makes it that much cooler!

Make sure you call in your reservation ahead of time and plan on spending a couple hrs. eating.

340724,2014-08-17,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Where do I start... If you are looking for a fine dining Restaurant this is not the place to eat! I used to work as a chef in 5 Star restaurants, and when I go out to eat I expect to get the same quality food for the price. 

Since this is a chain restaurant, the quality has probably gone down hill over the years and that includes not only the quality of the food but the type of servers they hire as well. 

My husband and I ordered the four coarse meal for $40 per person and that included a small bowl of diced stale bread, raw cauliflower, broccoli and carrots and Luke warm cheese for dipping. 

Second coarse was a starter salad 

Third coarse was the main meal if you want to call it that, which included a plate of low grade quality raw meat.... They offer you chicken bouillon to cook it with, which tasted like top Ramen, so I know for a fact they don't make their own stocks. 

Once cooked, which takes a while to do, since the liquid is at a low simmer, I was still hungry after eating, since they offer a small portion of meat.

I was so irritated that we did not even stay for dessert and our bill was over $100

The menu changes quite frequently, it is a nice surprise to be able try new things every time we go. The service is great, the staff is witty, professional and not pushy. The booths are cozy.

1st time I ever went there was years ago...the hostess was the worst I have ever encountered my whole life! My party and I didn't make a reservation and instead of explaining that reservations were required, and try to accommodate us (the restaurant was practically empty! maybe 3 parties were seated in the whole place! The lot had about 6 cars parked) she rudely asked if we had reservations, and as soon as we answered no she almost shouted at us that she can't seat us if we didn't make reservations. 
2nd years later I made reservations for 2 and I went and had the whole experience with my best friend. We had the cheese fondue 1st, the salad 2nd, entree pot next and last was the dessert fondue pot. All of it was absolute crap! It tasted horrible! Even the salad was yuck! It was wilting leaves of iceberg lettuce!
3rd time I went we did the whole experience again. When we were seated, our server was a sweet Hispanic lady and she introduced herself and began the process of serving us (which is almost like a show). In the middle of this I for another server pulled her a few steps aside of our table and then began arguing about our table supposed to be her table. They were arguing in front of us. As if we were stupid the other waitress won the battle and resumed where the Hispanic waitress left off. She then told us that the other lady was clocking out because of an emergency (the whole time during our dinner the Hispanic waitress was there serving a different table!) this was sooooo awkward for us! The food was once again just like the last time...mediocre.

Their default salad has beet and egg, not my favorite.  The third course you have three choices, meat meat meat.  Difference is, meat, or with 1 lobster, or with 2 lobster tails, with veg and several sauces.  I feel the blue cheese sauce goes with beef really well. There is a free soup base, and two other with extra charge.  The last was the best, their desert.  You can choose any chocolate base, we chose the Yin and Yang.  There are white and black mush mellow, crispy rice, cheese cake, and the last not least, the strawberry, which we found the best dipping in the Yin and Yang.

I had sort of built it up in my head as an experience that we'd enjoy sharing, if and when we finally tried it. It's rare that we can all be together, due to the older kid's work schedules. Service was slow, and the menu really wasn't all that exciting. The thing was, we were all super polite. We ordered a lot, because we had such a large group. So, the variety of options we'd ordered was fairly wide. But, we were unimpressed. It was just over-priced and not-inspired food. What's more, when we left; all of my kids said the same thing: They felt like they had just stepped out of the Twilight Zone. The atmosphere was a little creepy.

1165480,2012-08-30,1,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"This is a really fun place - great for a date, because the booths are high and semi-private. Also, you get to cook food together, which is cool if the conversation dies. Of course, I always go there with my bff, so we're never short of people to talk about, er... conversation. 

The meals are served in courses: cheese, salad, main and dessert. You don't have to do all four, but seriously... why wouldn't you?

The cheese course is served with bread cubes (white and dark), raw veggies and granny smith apples. You can pick from four or so different cheese combos that your server will prepare at your table, complete with a well-rehearsed warning not to burn yourself on the steam table or fondue pot. 

Salads are pretty straightforward. The house dressing is rather sweet, so if you're not into that, stick with vinaigrette or bleu cheese. 

The main courses are great - we usually get a mixed plate of raw meats both seasoned and unseasoned. All are fresh and delicious (chicken, filet, shrimp), and they come with broccoli and mushrooms and eight dipping sauces. You will also need to choose from flavors of cooking broth. I've tried Cajun and coq au vin - both very nice. At this point, you will receive another friendly PSA about eating raw meat (bad) and burning yourself (also bad). 

Dessert? Three words: white chocolate caramel. There are other choices, but I've never ventured past the pot of gooey melted heaven that you get to dip marshmallows (coated in graham crackers or Oreos), Rice Krispy squares, pound cake, cheesecake and various fruits into. Nobody will judge you if you just use your spoon and eat it from the pot, although in your frenzy to get it all, please remember to let it cool!

Even the coffee there is divine. 

Be forewarned - you will easily spend money at this place. My friend and I left last night poorer by nearly $125. Is it worth it? Oh yeah.",fZR7spauUm_S8tZQrgFYiA,4,0,5,KAP-_XBIKWk-Ym-Z6QW4XQ

I had the Jalapeno Fillet mignon, teriyaki beef, chicken and vegetable pot stickers, and pork with a spicy Memphis rub I believe.  We got the regular broth because we all had to agree on one that can be a little difficult with a larger group. Everything I had was good and very filling.

1333430,2017-12-04,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"I took my husband here for his birthday, and boy do I wish I would have taken him somewhere else.

I have never been here before, so I didn't really know what to expect.  

The first red flag was the lighting.  I don't think I have ever been bothered by lighting in my life, but my husband and I both felt like we were in a spotlight.  It was soooo bright!!

The menu looked promising.  We did the two people 4-entree deal.  We received a cheese fondue, a salad each, and 4 entrees each (meat/seafood/pasta).  We both ordered a cocktail right away, and didn't receive it until we received our cheese fondue, 20 minutes later.

We ordered the spinach artichoke cheese fondue per our watiress's recommendation.  When the cheese fondue arrived, there was a hair in the garlic.  The cheese fondue was probably the best part of the meal.

We ordered a variety of entrees (duck, filet, dry rub pork, sacchetti, potstickers, meatballs, chicken, etc) and didn't enjoy any of it.  We went with the waitress's recommendation of coq au vin cooking oil, and regretted that as well.  Everything is cooked in the same pot, and some of the flavors just don't mesh well together.  

Even dessert wasn't all that great.  We received a boat of dip-ables (angel cake, banana, brownies, marshmellows, etc.) which all tasted stale.  We had the chocolate peanut butter fondue.  The chocolate itself was tasty.

Service was pushy, but we both work in restaurants, and know what it's like when managers make wait staff practically beg their guests for reviews and sign-ups.  We were asked to donate to children's cancer while finishing up our meal, which is just uncomfortable.

My husband and I were very disappointed.  Maybe boiled meat isn't for us, but we will not return.

The staff was very friendly, which is the only reason this place is getting two stars.

I'm not sure what the hype here is.  The ""experience"" itself is cool, but the food is overpriced and not good.  I would say save your money and go somewhere else.",FWYjGKHmbjxrkXROctTGYA,4,1,2,YDyymx65dy5F_DoDeUZCsA

1389761,2009-10-14,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate his dad's b-day. I actually had gone to the melting pot three times prior to this. The prior times I had gone were only for appetizers and dessert, and our parties were only the max of four. 

My first two times, I had the cheese appetizer, specifically the Wisconsin trio I believe, was delicious. They offer a variety of breads to try with the cheese, as well as some vegetables. These were great with the cheese selected. 

I had tried some mediocre fondue desserts, but this was great! It is offered with either dark chocolate, white chocolate, or both. They give you a plate of fruits, crackers, rice crispy treats, and marshmallows. 

After these encounters, I never had enough room to fathom eating the main entr√©e plates.  

So for my boyfriend's dad's b-day, It was the first time for fondue for about 8-10 of us. I know I had really had high expectations for the main course. We ran into some big problems. First, there were only 2 pots for all of us, This caused a lot of fork tangling. The fondue forks were all colliding with each other and everyone had to move their fork when somebody wanted to take his or her own fork out. Second, the two cooking ""methods"" were vastly different from each other and no meat was suited for either of them. The filet mignon was just OK. I mean would you want fried filet mignon? 

Lastly, we tied up our meal with the dessert fondue, which was absolutely delicious (as expected) 

Conclusions: Go for the cheese appetizer and chocolate dessert and expect a high price. In a restaurant like this you're paying for the amount of time spent at the table because there is hardly any turnover (our group was there for 2 hours). Skip the entree unless you like pouched or fried meat. The main problem with the food is the cooking method. Also, a timer really would have been nice for those of us concerned about food safety.",VizhcyMWWPz3UDXEBeix4w,1,0,3,1bJEn1xv4dPUU-ZHKikT5Q

Veronica was every informative and answered all our questions! The meat was extremely fresh! The sausage was spicy and the salmon was to die for. They cook it in a vegetable broth which adds plenty of favor to the vegetables and meats! The chocolate fondue was obviously my best part!

Arriving, we were greeted by the most monotone girl who wasn't happy to be working New Years Eve.   I get it but at least crack a smile.   We were seated immediately but as I sat down, there was a dirty napkin still on the seat.  Hmm.   I had to hand that to the girl right away.  Looking closer at our table, it was still dirty and needed cleaned.  Yuck. Even after we left, our jackets had 'leftover' food on them from the unclean table area.  Not really happy about that. 

Our waitress was shortly over to our table explaining the special menu they had for the evening. 
After making our choices and drink orders, she was back quickly to prepare our cheese fondue.  Absolutely delicious.  It had a nice blend of cheese, onion and bacon flavors combined.  This was served with rosemary and french breads, apples and veggies.   It's always great dipping each of these into the cheese blends.   

The salads were also delicious.   Pear with crumbled blue cheese and almonds tossed in a vinaigrette.   Fabulous.   It was small but you really didn't need anything larger with all of the food yet to come.  

The entree was loaded with cracked pepper filet, bbq pork,  honey chicken, mahi maui, jumbo prawns and gorgonzola saccetti.  You could add lobster tail for $15 but this was definitely enough food already.   The entree was mouth watering.  Plus the entree is served with potatoes, broccoli and mushrooms.   Yum!

With all of that food in our stomachs, there was still the mint chocolate fondue to devour.   Their chocolate fondues are accompanied by a plate of various desserts to dip including rice krispy treats, brownies, marshmallows and fruit.   I really shouldn't have eaten it but it sure was tasty!  

During our meal, our waitress wasn't really up to par.  My husband had ordered a drink which must have slipped her mind.  She later came back and asked again if he wanted another.

You could tell she was angry that she was a waitress. She was short when we asked questions, never seemed to want to explain anything thoroughly and when I asked a question she replied ""I'll answer that when I bring the food."" Once she left the table we needed a GPS to locate her again. Food and drinks were just ok but her service was exceptionally horrible. These people need training bad. They blew it with me for a return visit and I'll tell the world to avoid this place unless you want your night out for dinner to be ruined. Our expectations weren't even close to being Met.

1856646,2014-01-25,1,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Rushed us w/ the bill:

We were in the area and decided to dine here if we could get in.  We walked in around 5:30 on a Friday night and they were able to seat us without a reservation.  There were 2 tables w/ people besides us when we first arrived. They opened at 5pm.

We have been here a few times before and knew exactly what we wanted so we ordered everything right when we sat down.  We did not have any questions about the menu--our order was very simple and straight forward.  Two iced teas and two house salads w/ tangy dressing.  We ordered the pick three for two with all Teriyaki Sirloin, 1 order of sausage, (which was 4 slices) and extra potatoes.

Half way through the meal our server asked if we would be doing the chocolate course? We weren't sure at that time so we said No.  He said ""I will be right back w/ your check.""  A few minutes later he dropped the bill.  We weren't even done cooking all of our meat.  I usually decide if I want dessert when I am finished with my meal not halfway through the main course.  I understand there may be some extra prep work and they would like to know about dessert so they can get going on it.  No need to drop the bill so prematurely especially because the place wasn't even busy. Maybe he was mad we weren't raking up a huge bill.  We have done the Big Night out option a few times before and learned exactly what we do and don't like.  We usually end up with way to much food.

I understand it's a slow place to turn tables over and they don't want you there all night but c'mon? We were quick to order and not eating super slow.  It really irritates me to feel rushed like that.  We finished cooking the last pieces of meat and got a to-go box for them.  The time my bill was printed was 6:02pm.(see pics) We were there maybe 40min. max start to finish.  40 min. is quick for The Melting Pot which is supposed to be a ""slow paced"" dining experience.

The food was really good.  Teriyaki Sirloin has lots of juicy flavor. Love the 6 different sauce selections and the garlic salt. The salad size has decreased since the last time we visited.  Our iced teas hardly had any ice so we had to ask for a glass with ice so we could put ice in our teas. 

Overall not the best experience.  If we were dining for a special occasion I would be really unhappy.  Since it was just a Friday night out I can deal with the issues but won't be rushing back anytime soon.  I thought I would be giving a 5 star review tonight but we were actually quite disappointed. : (",5fZk-aijjsRehb_jZJRXag,1,1,3,7QHnTAu06GnKMbto8GRcIw

Limited wine list, stale bread for dunking and some pretty poor quality filet.  The vegetables had been in the fridge for a quite a while.  The chocolate sauce was too thick and no one would ever eat the fruit without chocolate to cover the taste, or lack thereof.

Oh, and did I mention the service was terrible and completely indifferent?  We were there for a birthday and the place was 2/3 full.  Despite a reservation, we were seated a small 'in-the-walkway' table.  We were ignored before ordering anything and then between each course.

We didn't see our waiter at all after the entree, we kind of grabbed people walking by.  When we left a waiter apologized for the 'gaps' in service, for what that was worth.  We never saw any sign of management or any one who cared.

2071844,2015-11-18,3,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Melting Pot is the perfect place to celebrate a special occasion or take a date. Dim lights and comfy booths make for an enjoyable and romantic dining experience. This is a fancy schmancy way to eat fondue.

I'll be honest, I've never had a date take me here, I came here with my mom. Loser, party of one. All jokes aside, we came for my mom's 50th birthday and it was quite an experience. We were seated in a small dining room that we had all to ourselves. There were 5 of us, so we were given two fondue pots. You can choose ala carte items, or go for the 4 course meal which we opted to do. The 4 courses are:

Salad- Everyone can choose their own type of salad. Casear, house and California are among the options.

Cheese- 6 different styles to choose from. The cheese is usually mixed with a wine and other seasonings and condiments. 

Meat- For the meat course, you choose which type of meats you want to cook. They have surf and turf which is the more expensive option, or steak and chicken, shrimp etc. Then you choose the cooking liquids you want to cook your meats in. Different flavored broths, spices and wines make up the options. There are a few different selections for this, but they are all yummy. This course also comes with raw veggies that you cook in the pot as well. They soak up the delicious broth really well. They also give you 4 different sauces to dip the cooked meats into after they are done. Everyone gets their own metal colored cooking sticks, so you always know whose items are whose.

Dessert- My favorite course. You can get different types of chocolate, as well as mix-ins to create your perfect dessert experience. Turtle is a personal favorite of mine.

The cheese, meat, and dessert courses are all prepared and cooked in fondue pots. Once you make your selections, your server will put all of the ingredients into the pot and turn on the fire. You do the rest. There are plenty of delicious dippers, bread, and veggies for the cheese and meat course, and fresh fruit, marshmallows, brownies and cake pieces for the dessert course. 

All in all, I really enjoyed our dinner here. The whole meal takes around 2 hours, so expect to be there for a while. I think it was around $40 pp for the 4 course meal, but as I said earlier you can get ala carte if you wish. Maybe skip the salad and go straight for the meats. You could also stop in for just dessert, which I am tempted to do in the near future.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,8,4,5,i4ALaOgoliWHT2unzfevGQ

2156645,2014-07-22,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Food was good. It was my mom's birthday. 

Service, however, went from fine to non existent to worse. 

Went almost thirty minutes without our server (Ashley) seeing us. During that time, we were out of drinks and the oil got so hot that it was bubbling and popping - enough so that a blob of hot oil burned my finger while it was clear back near my plate. 

What did the server do? Nothing... She was nowhere to be found. We called for her and she did not come so we called for the hostess who seated us to come and turn down the oil. She kindly did so, brought us refills and apologized.

When Ashley finally showed back up, we told her about what happened and without apology, her first utterance was to correct us and tell us that the hostess was not a hostess, but actually the manager. She then went on to explain that she got assigned another table clear on the other side of the restaurant. 

After she disappeared again for a while, the manager/hostess came back and my mom suggested that they consider placement of tables for a single server a bit closer together. The manager went on to explain that they do that on purpose so you don't have to hear all the explanations over and over as new people are seated around you. We mentioned that the consequence in this instance was almost thirty minutes without any service. We had to listen to several more excuses such as how they staff based on the number of reservations, the high number of walk-in customers they had that night, etc. She asked what she could do to make the visit more enjoyable (isn't that YOUR job to know... given that restaurants are a service industry and you are the manager?)

After that, Ashley seemed pretty mad. She dropped off dessert at our table and was effectively giving us the silent treatment... No explanations of what any of the bite sized desserts were or any of the usual pleasantries. She provided only a caution that when the level of chocolate gets low, it might be extra hot, then ran off. 

The bottom line? Expect the same good Melting Pot food here as you would at other locations.... Just not the same good Melting Pot service. We paid over a hundred dollars for dinner for two to be left to our own devices with a pot of hot oil and have to listen to a laundry list of excuses why the service sucked. 

And perhaps most importantly... Don't roll the dice on this place for a special occasion. Awful service can certainly put a damper on someone's birthday! I spent the whole ride home trying to get her mind off of it.",9LUyW8Npgzc_KzHSqWYV6Q,0,0,1,Vo1jb6KKBRI4xH6_AW7UOg

We had reservations and it was our anniversary. We had also called to change our reservation time to 15 minutes later and then arrived at the original time... They didn't give us any problems about our timing and sat us right away. Since it was our anniversary they say is in a quiet corner which was very nice. We were greeted by a very nice waitress by the name of Angelica. We got the 4 course meal which I suggest everyone gets because u get the most for your money and experience , for the cheese appetizer we got the Wisconsin trio. They prepare it right in front of u. This was amazing. Then we had our salads and this is where my only issue came into play . I had a Cesar salad and my plate smelled so fishy. My husbands as well. I told Angelica and she said it was most likely the anchovies from the Cesar salad. This made sense to me... So on to the next course which was the main course... I got the land and sea and he got the steak lovers. But the same issue with the plates happened again, even with his steak lovers. It smelled like wet dog .... The food was very good and nothing tasted tainted or anything . We were greeted by I believe the manager who said he was sorry about the salads and then I told him to smell our plates, he agreed they plates smelled bad and said they were taking care of the problem and rehashing everything. He also checked on us again during our meal and explained he had comped the salads, a round of drinks and something else, anyways a huge part of our bill was comped and by dessert our plates smelled normal.

Regularly, we wouldn't be able to afford a regular meal here with the whole family, but..... on Sunday, they offer a very reasonable $21.00 three course meal for lunch. Which was a steal for Melting Pot! We had a party of 6 with a 4 year old. They were very accommodating to our very picky child in the group. Our waitress was great, it felt like she had an answer to all our questions and she was pretty fast with all our requests. 

For the 6 people, we got two fondues, the Alpine and the Spinach Artichoke. Each person got any salad of their choosing. I got a pear gorgonzola. Yum! For the meat, they had a selection of different sliced deli meats. Very yummy with the fondue we got, but almost seemed liked we were shorted on food. They brought out 3 trays that had 3 slices of different assorted slices, when asked where the other plates were, was said that each plate had two meals on it. Which I thought was odd, seeing as why would there be an odd number of pieces of each meat. 1.5 pieces per person? Odd. but whatever, we were getting a great price, couldn't complain. Now the best part of the meal....dessert! Once again, we got two choices of the fondue. We got the ying and yang and the flaming turtle. So good. The only bad thing was my dad is allergic to chocolate, so he couldn't enjoy the full dessert extravaganza. They brought out a huge platter of sweets to dip in our dessert fondues. YUM!

Atmosphere:  Just ""meh"" to me.  In trying to keep a more private feel, they had us angled toward a plain wall in the back.  It's the type of booth where you are facing more out than facing each other, and in order to sit comfortably, you pretty much stare at the wall.  Or, do what other people near us did, and browse facebook on your iphone.  Also, it was quiet at first which was nice, but as it got closer to 6:30/7pm the noise level really started to pick up.  One thing I have to mention, is the smell.  When we walked in there was a pungent odor that can only be described as rotten dirty feet, or an animal's rear end.  I discovered later that it's the smell of the cheese fondue (of course, the one that we ordered).  I had to smell it several times throughout the evening and it was making me sick.  

Food: The cheese fondue was just okay once I got past the smell.  Too much wine added to it, and it was overpowering.  The main course was a combo of steak, chicken, and shrimp.  Once it gets boiled in the broth, it all pretty much tastes the same-- bland.  With a faint flavor of more wine.  Boiled steak is just gross.  The shrimp and chicken was okay as long as I dunked it in plenty of sauce.  Like I said, the dessert was fantastic and it would be worth it to go back for dessert, except for the risk of having to smell that awful cheese again.  So...no.

Service:  Was actually great.  The hostess was cheerful, and our waitress was very pleasant and did not rush us at all.  

Over all, it's a bit pricey for what you are actually getting.  There are plenty of other places to drop $100+ where you will get a much nicer atmosphere and incredible food that you do not have to cook yourself.  And no rotten cheese smell.",CV0bWIjggVjXi_Akjw9xiA,0,0,2,Gy-2tGZmXYdyr3gT1lNfPw

We ordered the 4 course meal at $45.95 each that comes with cheese fondue with bread, apples, broccoli, and cauliflower for starters. The second course was a salad of your choice from the menu, then the third course was a choice of the meat selection or the classic selection that comes with steak, pork and shrimp that you cook for up to 2 minutes in the fondue which consists of oil, garlic, cilantro and other seasonings. It's definitely filling and you still have the final course of a choice of chocolate fondue from their menu which comes with strawberries, banana, brownies, sweet bread, and marshmallows.

Only thing which wasn't great was the Steak on my wife's plate, it had a little too much sliver skin (ewww). The salads were nice, the desert was delicious. 

The service was efficient and attentive. It was priced a little high but it was nice that the shrimp for my daughter was only $8.95 and was more than enough for her.

Cooking meat in hot liquid is not really my personal thing, but its still pretty good.  And then there is the desert course...various delicious tidbits that you can dip in melted chocolate.

Then I asked, how much longer is "" not much longer?"" Her response? "" Not much longer."" Wow..So glad I made a reservation. I looked around and saw at least ten empty tables, so we gathered our things ready to walk out and a lady came to seat us.

She was so inattentive that the busser ended up refilling our drinks TWICE. She turned up the sherry so high that it overflowed onto the table and she was no where to be found. Again, the busser came to her rescue and turned down the heat. He apologized and said it was way to hot. Her name was not on my receipt but her server ID was 33. Not sure how she has a job at all.

Came back a few weeks later dressed a little dressier and we were seated right away. Now I've been to the Melting Pot in Arizona and NEVER had an issue but I guess Vegas is a little more elite. 
Well with that said.....I am expecting it to be A+ service and cuisine which is was not....the table was dirty...there was dried up nasty food stuck to the wood wall.

2583270,2012-05-25,1,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"This was a really great dining experience for me and my group. We had the four course classic menu with a cheddar cheese fondue, house and Caesar salads, the mojo fondue cooking style for our entrees, and a classic chocolate fondue. The four course menu is set for parties of 2 so we ordered 2 sets. 

Unfortunately we weren't able to select different types of fondue per set because we were all seated at one table. This was unfortunate because two members of our group were not adventurous eaters so we stuck to the basic/classic fondues. On the bright side however, because they didn't eat any of the seafood entrees me and my ""date"" got to have double the amount of seafood!

It was really fun spearing and dipping and cooking your food in this community pot! Occasionally we'd have a ""man down"" call and have to go fishing for lost pieces of meat or veggies and that person would get a TON of cheese or chocolate on their food.

The prices were a little high for the amount of food but what you're really paying for is the experience. Our waiter was excellent and we let him know that we were in a bit of a hurry. He let us know that fondue dining tends to take a little longer than a normal meal but he managed to keep the meal paced quickly. 

It's definitely a great place for a date or to celebrate a special occasion! I will definitely be back next time I'm in Vegas!",WRTKHSPSum0sg6HDYM5prw,1,1,4,bDI_OI39sPMd8dgzjYYA5w

We were seated in the very back (my husband and I) where the lighting was dim and very romantic. Tyler was our waiter. If you ever dine here, ask for him. Tyler was by far the BEST waiter we've ever had. He was funny, charming, and very knowledgable. We ordered the 4 course meal and the wine pairings. Two red wines and two whites. I can't remember which one we ordered but it was the one with Moscato. I didn't like the red wine pairings but the moscato was enough to get me through the entire meal. 

Anyway, I was a little skeptical of cooking  our own food BUT it was a very unique and enjoyable experience. The food (entree) didn't look like much but boy were we wrong. The cheese fondue was soooo good. They offered bread, fruit and veggies. By the time we got to dessert (turtle fondue) we were so full we were barely able to sample each treat. With the tip we spent around $160 but it was well worth it. We cannot wait to return for another spectacular experience. Also, we were the last patrons in the restaurant but Tyler told us to take our time, there was no rush which we appreciated. If you've never been, you need to go.

2656931,2016-10-17,6,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"It was our first time trying it tonight and we fell in love! It was for our three year anniversary so we made a reservation at 6:30. We were so hungry, so we decided to call and see if we can just move it up. They were more than glad to move the reservation up! We also didn't feel like dressing up. We usually do when we go to nicer places but we just wanted to be us today. We were immediately sat and got a cute small booth! Perfect so now we don't have to awkwardly decide who gets the chair and who gets the booth! 

The server Tyler had to have been one of the best servers I've ever had. He was so funny, he knew the menu, and made amazing recommendations! Now most of the time when two kids in their early 20's come in with basketball shorts and band tee's, people tend to assume that 1) we can't afford much or 2) we won't tip much. It has happened to us before so I was really happy when he was actually giving us amazing service. So good we even had to talk to the manager to let him know that Tyler was amazing! 

We don't like wine but they had an amazing deal on beer! You get one beer per course and each matches the style of the part. So for the starter, there was an American lager. For the salad, it came with a grapefruit coriander IPA. Now I hate IPA's but that was a great IPA. For the entree, it came with hefe wheat ale. With the dessert, of course a stout. Now these all were brewed in Vegas! They're local beers and all really amazing. All that for $14!

There are about 8-10 different choices for the cheese, we just got the Wisconsin trio and it was just really good! It came with stuff like pretzels to apples, to cheese wrapped prosciutto! 

We both got salads (which we tend to never do just because we're not fans of salad) but the California and the caprese are probably the only two I'd purposely order. Personally the caprese was better than the California!

For the entrees, we both got the classic! I got duck instead of chicken though. They have a pot full of broth for the entree and you just cook your own meat! It's great for slow eaters so your food won't get cold. It only takes 1:30-2 minutes for the meats and seafood to get cooked. We got the mojo style broth and it was really amazing! They also have 8 different dipping sauces too so get creative! Anything from teriyaki sauce to a curry one. Very great. 

Finally, the chocolate s'more for the dessert! It was a pot of milk chocolate. On the side it came with chocolate chip cookies, brownies, rice crispy treats, and much more! 

They also gave us complimentary chocolate covered strawberries for our anniversary! What a great way to end it. 

Tip: if you say that you don't want something (like a salad) which is part of the 4 course, you'll get charged $7. So might as well get more food and save $7!",Nhk0jTP2gkU12G4LHJVR3A,14,14,5,UQa-_QTF7HLRolM3-wVILA

The waiter was only about 5 minutes to the show, after seated (which wasn't bad). He explained everything, asked the occasion, knowledge of the food and desserts, spot on the game. I could even hear another waiter chatting next door and the guy had jokes! It was nice to chuckle a bit. 

Anyhow..the food. The food. The cheese fondue was good, I can't say much because I love cheese and its really hard for me to find ""gross"" fondue. The potatoes, let's talk about [these] guys.

I cannot say that every waiter is as extraordinarily amazing like our waiter, Tyler, but I am guessing that the Melting Pot hires only the best.  Tyler was more like a waiter, chef, ma√Ætre d', sommelier all in one person. His knowledge about all the foods on the menu, how they are prepared and how they pair together, timing of when they were brought out etc was far greater than any other waiter I've ever had serve me.

The last time we went, I have to say I was a bit disappointed. The prices have all gone up and what you get has gone down. We would always get their Big Night Out. The Salad and Cheese Courses were good as always. The main course was smaller than it has been in terms of the meat. Veggies were all the same.

The biggest disappointment was the desert. They would bring out actual chocolate pieces, mix everything up, and melt them properly. The last time we were there they busted out the Hersey's Syrup, warmed it up for us in a pot, and served it with most of the normal fruit and other desert bits, less their piece of cheese cake. Apparently they now charge extra for that.

So. The Melting Pot was already expensive but I was willing to pay that when we got our money's worth. Now they want more, give less for the main course, and dispense Hersey's chocolate syrup for the desert.

2911319,2016-01-18,5,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"The Melting Pot made my first fondue dining experience a memorable one! I had never even thought to try a place like this until a couple of great friends suggested it for a get together. 

We set up our reservation a few days in advance and I have to admit I was pretty curious as to what all this would entail by the time we got there. 

Our waiter, Tyler, was fantastic! He was knowledgeable, personable, and hilarious! He put a great emphasis on presentation and truly added to the experience of it all. 

We opted for the 4 course meal for our entire party.

It all got started with the cheese fondue. Tyler prepared the cheese  and brought out items to dip into the cheese. Among the items were bread pieces, apple slices, baby carrots, cauliflower, among other things. My favorites were the bread and apple slices. The bread was a little hard and I'm sure that was intentional, but I would have loved to had totally soft bread to sop up more of that tasty cheese! The cheese was thick, gooey, and so incredibly tasty! The whole table was all over it!

Next was the salad. While everyone else at the table opted for house salads, I went for the caesar salad! The salad was light and delicious! A great way to cleanse the palate for what was coming next!

...which was the main course! I opted for the Steak Lovers ($39.95)which consists of a premium filet mignon, teriyaki-marinated sirloin and
certified angus beef sirloin. Apparently, you can add a lobster tail for an additional $9.95, but I thought I'd save that for next time. All three meats were savory and delectable! Absolutely loved it! They bring you an assortment of 6 different sauces to dip your meats into. One spicy, one mustard, another sour cream, and some kind of other sauce that incredible! I think Tyler called it ""Green Goddess""? lol I hope I got that right. The entire party loved hat and we had to get some more, as it ran out pretty fast!

Finally, it all wraps up with desert! We all decided to have The Original, which is a milk chocolate fondue swirled with peanut butter! How can you go wrong with that! They bring you another plate of snacks to dip into your chocolate fondue, Items such as strawberries, rice krispies squares, pineapple slices, and pound cake squares. The choclate was thick and creamy and oh so delicious! A great way to cap off the meal!

I remember thinking at the begining of the meal, that it didn't look like all that much food, but by the end I was stuffed! It was all very filling and satisfying!

The only reason I chose 4.5 stars instead of 5 was...
- a couple times during the meal, there were some inordinate delays in getting items and refilling some others. It wasn't a big deal, but it did hamper the flow of the meal.

Other tidbits-

-one of the members of our party was celebrating her birthday and they were kind enough to bring her out a chocolate covered strawberry plate with Happy Birthday signed in chocolate on the plate. Was a very nice and appreciated touch!

As I said at the outset, The Melting Pot made my first fondue experience a very memorable one! I would not hesitate to recommend this place and we will certainly be back to show other friends about this place as our friends introduced us to it!

It was very dark inside the restaurant. I actually thought the place was closed from the outside since it was so dark. I liked it, it had a very private setting. The tables were very private as well, you don't even really realize that there are other people seated around you.

Since we came for dessert it was pretty easy to decide on what we wanted, so we just ordered the regular YinYang Fondue which was $28 and was half dark choco and half white choco and a lot of dippers. It was all SO delicious. The chocolate went so well with all of the dippers. I guess the only dipper I didn't like was the marshmallow, but that's only cuz of texture. I totally want to come back here as soon as I can. The staff was also extremely nice and welcoming with smiles on their faces and lots of greetings.

I took my husband here for his 40th birthday and because it was Halloween, the place was almost empty.  We got awesome service and chose the Wisconsin Trio for our cheese. It was delicious to say the least. If you're not a fan of Gorgonzola, don't do this one. We had it with the usual fare-bread, veggies and apples. We each had a salad-Caesar for the hubs and a caprese for me. I loved mine, the husband likes his. The candied pine nuts on the Caesar was a nice touch for sure. For our main course we got various meats-filet mignon, chicken, ahi, sausage. They were quality meats, no doubt about it. My issue is strictly just a preference thing - I'm not a fan of boiled meats. It's just weird to me. The taste was manageable-I guess it was just the thought of meat after meat after meat cooking in the same boiling liquid. I'm weird, I know? 
The star of the fondue show? Dessert, without a doubt. Oh my died and went to heaven situation. Bananas, strawberries, pineapples, pound cake, marshmallows, Rice Krispie treats and brownies all dipped in scrumptious milk chocolate. They offer an extensive list of variations for dessert fondue and this was one of the more basic ones but it was anything but basic. 
It was just the husband and I and the food was plentiful. We both agreed that although fondue is a super fun way to eat, it might be a little difficult in a large group. All in all it was a definite ""we'll be back"" spot. I think out next visit will just be salad, cheese fondue and dessert.",vpvW58vXP9xuOsWg-OCFxg,1,0,4,BboRM2VOuEeVHXmT36cgww

3018311,2014-12-15,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"This was such a fun experience...one that I intend to repeat.

I had always wanted to eat at this restaurant, so I set up a reservation for my best friend's birthday.  We were seen to immediately.  We were a bit stressed about the time since we had heard that a full meal takes two plus hours and we had to get from here to Mandalay Bay for a show by 6:45.  We told our waiter, Jose, our concerns and he set a timer on himself and assured us he would make sure we left at a decent time to make the commute.  That greatly impressed me.

To start we ordered the Cheddar cheese fondue.  It was amazing.  You could especially taste the ale they add to it.  My only complaint was that the bread they serve with it is too large for one bite and needs to be cut smaller.

For our salads, I got the Caesar and my best friend got the California.  Both were really good and I would definitely recommend.

For our entr√©e, we split The Classic which came with sirloin, Memphis-style BBQ pork medallion, Pacific white shrimp, herb-crusted chicken and teriyaki-marinated sirloin.  We had ours cooked Mojo style which is Caribbean seasoned bouillon with garlic flavor and citrus.  Our waiter instructed us to cook each piece of meat for two minutes.  While each piece was good, our mutual favorite was the teriyaki sirloin.  They also bring you fresh vegetables (potatoes, broccoli and mushrooms) to add to the broth and six different dipping sauces to use on the cooked meat.  So good.

The highlight of our meal was definitely dessert.  We ordered the s'mores which was a base of milk chocolate with marshmallow cream that our waiter flamb√©ed and topped with bits of graham crackers.  For dippers, we were given a plate of fresh strawberries, blondies, bananas, pineapple, marshmallow treats, pound cake, brownies and additional marshmallows with either grahams crackers or Oreo cookie bits on them.  The fondue tasted exactly like s'mores and I especially liked it with the extra marshmallows and brownies.  I would go back simply for this dessert despite that I liked everything.

I was especially impressed with our waiter, Jose.  He was helpful with the menu, courteous, engaging and, as previously mentioned, mindful of our short time frame.  I recommend this restaurant simply for the experience.  You'll be quite pleased by the delicious food and amazing service that goes along with it.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,0,0,5,cy3p0LR61y0O6TcM1a7dDQ

Our server was always missing in action. We were not served desserts until around 9:40 PM. What annoyed me more was when we were in the middle of eating our desserts, she went around to drop off the check. It felt like she was hurrying us up. Well if she was more attentive, we could have finished earlier than we did.

On the lighter note, the food was excellent. Everything was on point! It's really just the service that got to me. The servers need to be more attentive and aware of their guests.

3072511,2011-01-06,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"The Melting Pot really never disappoints..

For our last visit, we got the four course option.

The first was the cheese fondue.  We ordered the option from their special French themed menu.  It was a mix of Brie and a few other fancy sounding cheeses with bacon and truffle in there.  It was served with the customary bread, apples, and veggies.  This cheese option was just OK.  However, I'm not gonna deduct any stars just because I'm not the biggest fan of the cheeses in this fondue.  I would definitely ask the waiter for a recommendation when it comes to the cheese.  We usually do, however, the guy who took our order didn't seem to have the knowledge/experience of their usual waiters.  He was quickly replaced by a more experienced waiter when our cheese came out.  Apparently, he was a busboy that is training to be a waiter.  Anyway, always ask for a recommendation with cheese.  On previous trips, we had plans to order the special cheese and our waitress recommended against it and offered other choices that were popular.  Try the mexican style cheese fondue it's definitely the best!  Gourmet nachos!

Next came the salads, which also don't disappoint.  My girlfriend and I always order the house salad with house dressings.  So good!  My sister got a caesar and my mom got the house salad with the peppercorn ranch.  They both liked their salads as well.  

Although we decided last time not to order entrees, because it was just too much food, we still got them this time.  You have to get the Coq au Vin oil/seasoning/broth mixture to cook your entree in.  It is by far the best option.  On all of our other trips, we would get the mojo which is a citrus/caribbean option.  The broth makes all the difference because it alters the flavor of every dish.  The mojo is good, but only if you don't mind the citrus flavor in every dish.  We ordered two of the special fondue fushion options.  This is the best option if you are interested in ordering all four courses, because it comes with more choices on your entree plate and costs about the same as ordering a la carte.  It came with lobster, filet mignon, ny strip steak, chicken, duck l'orange, shrimp, and these little raviolis.  Every single option was delicious and well marinated/seasoned.  The sauces also go better with the entree options when you use the Coq au Vin.

Last but not least, we got the original chocolate fondue.  There's not much to say, but this is perfection.  They seemed a little cheap with the dippers as they usually come back and ask if you'd like any additional.  We asked for some bananas and the waiter seemed a little stingy when he offered to get some.  But that's ok.  It's still delicious.",ShpEmWgg_O6WWpHseZkHEQ,1,0,5,sJSIUeSsV1SP6PbNTyk1wg

I don't ""heart"" it, that's lame. 

I LOVE IT!! 

I ate here for the first time in 2007 and totally enjoyed the whole experience! The inside is so not what you'd expect from the outside of the restaurant, and that's a good thing!! It's dimly lit in the dining area, which sets the mood if you're there with your sweetie! But good for a group also! 

After years of yearning to return to The Melting Pot (even though I saw one in Portland, OR the 3 times I've been there with my sister...she never wants to eat there!), I finally got to return to their Summerlin location and introduce this lovely place to my BF. 

We decided to get their Big Night Out 4 course meal and change up the options. For salads, he got the house and I stuck with their Latin theme which was a shrimp ceviche salad. Both were excellent, but I liked my salad the best! 

For the cheese fondue, we switched the queso cheese for their spinach artichoke cheese fondue. It came with carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, cubed bread, and cubes granny smith apples. Soo yummy!! 

Our main dish (I forget what it was called) had lobster tail, filet mignon, shrimp, 2 other meats, and ravioli. The broth we chose to cook them in was their garlic one (I can't remember what it was called!). But everything was soo delicious! Of course the waiters tell you the suggested cooking times for everything, but we quickly lost track of time! 

Dessert was switched for their Cookies and Cream Marshmallow Dream, which was made with dark chocolate. The dippers it came with were: cubed rice krispie treats, cubed pound cake, strawberries, marshmallows, and pineapples...soo good!! 

ps: the first time I dined here, I was able to make reservations via OpenTable, but not anymore :( You can still make reservations online through their website, though! 

Our server was very nice and helpful, he was very patient with us while deciding what to eat and drink! I got the wine pairings for the Latin Big Night Out meal - and they were all pretty good. 

I must say - I do love the personalized napkins they have in their bathrooms - they're soo thick and of good quality!! And the mints they give you with the bill and have upfront are also good! We also bought 3 bottles of their garlic and wine seasoning for our families, which my sister said goes really well with mac and cheese!",xkmwzqyy4ZSMsEIejwq41w,0,0,5,Uuij-kCvmamHO4HJ_mP7pw

I think I only liked this place was because of our server KATRINA she was absolutely fantastic! Always smiling, explained everything, sweet and just nice and made conversation. 

Let's first start off with me calling the place to make a reservation, hostess over the phone seemed a bit clueless on to what a reservation was?! She seemed confused when I asked her a a simple question. But Whatever didn't really bug me. 

We walked in and the place was really dim (I guess trying to set the mood) we really didn't see other customers because the booths were very closed off (again to set the intimate mood) this didn't bother me. We sat at a booth and I have to say the seats sucked, the seats were so low It was positioned in a way to where I could not reach the fondue pot. Fondue pot was way out of my reach next to the corner. I had to reach over and had my knees to the seat to be able to dip my food, and see what was going on. 

Food: we did the 4 course since it was our first time. Cheese fondue was good, I enjoyed the salad over the entree, entree the classic with shrimps,
Pork, steak, chicken. We added the Coq au fondue broth which was additional $4.95 not worth it. Server totally sold me... But it wasn't good i could taste too much of the red wine. As soon as u you dipped your meat in the fondue it lost all it's flavor and I swear all I tasted was the red wine vs everything that was in there. The server prepared the fondue for you and explained. The dessert was ok we got the ""ying and yang"" white and milk chocolate, came with an assortment of desserts for dipping such as fresh fruits, brownies, pound cake, marshmallows. I felt like it tasted cheap or they serve cheap food, but the bill oh no not at all. We spend 120$ 2 people 2 4 course meal+ 2 soft drinks+Coq au add on+ one espresso. Honestly we should have shared ONE 4 course meal. 

This place to me was more for the experience, don't come here if you want outstanding food. Just come here for either the cheese fondue or dessert fondue and skip the main entree fondues!!",C9Xy03vm_oJ-vWzn-8TB5w,1,1,3,362PNfuV67WK7NzR9fIevw

3142191,2014-06-05,2,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Me: For the price and what you get, there's a reason we forget about this place. First, I couldn't get a reservation when I called. They were full in found an opening online. Snagged it on the way there since we were en route to try our luck at a table anyway. When we got there, they had our reservation and seated us immediately. The place was virtually empty! It was about 6 pm on a weeknight. The ambience is nice and the idea is great but the execution, or rather MY execution of basically boiling or soaking my food in hot broth or not-hot-enough oil, left every bite either washed of flavor or over/undercooked and also left me wanting to go out afterward for a proper dinner. The cheese and dessert fondues are the only saving grace for our 2-star review. Would definitely come back for just dessert fondue, but not again for dinner. 

Him: Apples and cheddar get half a star but even the cheese had a spicy, bitter alcohol flavor. It's also not too saucy--too much flavor and too cheesy. The apples make it so it's not too intense. The dessert fondue is amazing. I would give it 3 stars here for that. For dinner, I remember I tried everything but I don't remember any of it. I don't remember except it was bad.

You cook everything yourself in the fondue pot, hence the name, The Melting Pot. It's well worth the time and price. You can always just go for cheese or chocolate as well if you are on a time crunch or not hungry enough to complete the 4 courses.

My wife and I are Melting Pot pro's at this point. We would go 3-4 times a month while living in Orange County.

We've had him twice now and each time we were cracking up the entire time. I would recommend asking for Tyler if you go in!

It was our first time and we were unsure of whether we should get two entrees or share. Our server wasn't really able to answer the question and told us it was just a matter of preference. My husband asked her how much meat we would get and she just compared two of the three choices and explained that one was more than the other. Unfortunately that isn't very helpful when you have no idea how much he meat comes with either. We went ahead and got two entrees just in case, and I'm glad we did or we likely wouldn't have had enough. We did the classic and the Wisconsin cheddar. The cheese had an overwhelming flavor of beer. I understand it has a beer base, but it literally didn't even taste like cheese. We did the complimentary cooking style and the meat wasn't bad, but it wasn't something that I would rave about and have cravings for. Finally, we had the pure milk chocolate for dessert. The dessert is definitely the star here. We decided that we'll come back the The Melting Pot, but we'll likely only come back for dessert in the future and skip the other courses. The service wasn't bad and due to being a member of their email club we got six chocolate strawberries for free, which was nice.

3474161,2013-12-22,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Not impressed. :( My husband and I used to go here to celebrate our anniversary, but it had been a few years. I decided to take my family. I made a reservation and pre-ordered the chocolate covered strawberries that were free with my birthday coupon.

When we arrived at the restaurant, they could not seem to find our reservation. There was nobody in the restaurant yet because I made the reservation for when they first opened. It was the most uncomfortable 10 minutes, as they never once apologized or even hinted that they made an error. It felt like they thought we were lying about having a reservation. I tried to cut them some slack because maybe they were stressed and had a lot of reservations behind us. Then one of the hostesses said, ""Well, we just can't take any more walk-ins tonight."" My stepdad said, ""but we had a reservation,"" and they just didn't say anything.

The server was fairly friendly, but I was going out of my way to be extra nice to her because she really didn't seem to want to be there. It took a long time to get refills and to bring out each course.

I just feel like the service was seriously lacking, especially because they didn't have that many customers when we showed up. None of the employees seemed happy. If I'm spending $250+ to take my family of five to dinner, I expect much better service. I'm not sure if we will go back again.",UIPObNsyeYu-KZe0UmLA0A,0,0,2,7xi3_sNjKnnXfe4vyz5GqQ
3480475,2015-08-11,8,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"The Melting Pot....what can I say!  I love this place.  I've been once a year for the last 4 years.  My and my other half go here for our anniversary.  I am a little disturbed by some of the negative reviews I've read about this place which I will pick apart like a four leaf clover on St Patrick's Day.  We've always made reservations when we decide to go so we are guaranteed seats and the 2 times we were late we didn't mind waiting because that's what civilized people do instead of looking to see if there are any empty seats.  On this visit we were late and had to wait 15 minutes becaue the staff was short handed.  Our alcholic beverages were comped because of the extended wait.  

Is the Melting Pot all concept......YES.  It is what it is. Most restaurants have a concept or a theme that makes them unique.  You can't go to a fast food restaurant and get Fondue.  Think about it!  

IF YOU ARE A CHEAPSKATE....stay home!  I hate it when people write that the food was overpriced or the portions are smaller.  Every single time I have gone the portion sizes are exactly the same.  When I go I'm prepared to spend 100 dollars and 20 dollars for the tip.......
If you want cheper Fondue Cheese Desert or Salad then by all means go to a cheaper restaurant and leave a postive review on your cheap delicious food.  

I like Melting Pot for the atmosphere and the delicious food.  I've never had one experience of wilted lettuce or nasty food.  Do you seriouly think that the server is going to bring out wilted lettuce if this place is all concept?  This is not the type of resturant where the servers are going to argue in front of you...period.  The staff is well trained and are always nice the few times I have been there.  One reviewer stated that the Hispanic server had to go home and they saw her still working.  That's just nonsense!  Pure nonsense! 

There were a few periods where there was a lag in drinks refreshed.  Our server Mike was awesome for the most part.  Very courteous.  I like to interact with our server and find out a little bit them. The staff at this location have worked with each other for years now. This is like a special ocassion restaurant....not a place you come to for just deserts and then review it like its a ice cream place.   

Will I go back...most definitely!  Go at your own risk.",_XcsG3krzuXLXaLDncBITQ,11,12,5,2lWZ6JI0iizrW9BD2mObiQ
3484886,2017-06-11,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"It's been years since I've been here, with that said I'll start with the positive, the food was good.  

I ordered a salad, and the alpine cheese fondue, (for 2) which comes with a handful of veggies, some green apples chunks and a bowl of variety cubed bread.  Apparently, although I missed the clue, the waiter said something about ""double the cheese"", when they were making the dish at our table, which at the time didn't mean anything to me until I got the bill, and it had to be explained to me why I was charged 4x the amount of the stated price for two people. 

When I first placed the order, I ordered 2 different cheese fondues (the waiter didn't think one would be enough since we were not having an entree or desert.)   After we finished the first fondue, the  maitre'd came by and asked if we were ready for the next course. I explained we were full and would like to cancel the second fondue if that was okay.  He was very polite and stated he would let our waiter know. 

We waited some time before the bill came, and was explained that we had double the cheese, thus why the cheese fondue alone was $40. I didn't order double the cheese, but can only guess its because I cancelled the second fondue, and didn't have an entree or desert the bill needed to be bumped up.

3499322,2014-03-14,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"I love the Melting pot. Been several times and to other one across the country basically from sea to shining sea.  So the food her is pretty good. The quality is pretty on point. The California salad is amazing I can't lie. And cheese and chocolate you can't go wrong. 
So now it's time for me to address somethings I've seen in other comments. To the people who are concerned about the raw meat... Are you touching it with you fingers? Also the same person seemed upset that they had to cook their own food... What did they think fondue was? This isn't hibachi. Just be safe and don't cross contaminate and cook the chicken through, this doesn't take long. 
As far as prices go. Yea it costs a decent amount of money but I'm sure everyone knows that before they come. Some of the meals are like $40-50 a person well guys that's fine dining prices but you actually get 4 courses. Also if you're there and you want more order it! You're already dropping cash might as well go all out. Lastly if you're broken you probably shouldn't make this your last meal before you get paid again. But yea the prices are a little high but you're paying for the experience and decent quality food. And the food portions aren't that small! Last time we went aka March 10 2014 we were offered more veggies bread apples and dessert dipping items. 
Lastly if you want to try it and eat more go when they have the $39.99 steak and chicken dinner 4 courses and like unlimited meats during the 3rd course.",-0MXmdIs75oSWmp8XlQKIw,0,0,4,AdISmIU4K8CwVoAayGe3fw
3507588,2014-05-09,6,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"I'm a HUGE fan of Melting Pot. I loooove me some cheese. If you've never been to a MP before, it's not only about cheese. You can get seafood and steak and (ugh, chicken). They have salad for appetizers and about 5 choices for chocolate desserts.
For me, I would always choose the Wisconsin Cheese Trio. IMO, it is THE best. I usually order cheese for 4 even though there is only 2 of us. Yea, say what you want, I'd rather eat cheese than chocolate. Or maybe it's because I'm so full from all the cheese, that I can pass on chocolate. 
Ambiance is nice, and service is usually very good. Feel free to ask for more apples or carrots with dinner, and the same with dessert. I like the brownies best, so I'd prefer more of those and no bananas.
The special the had this time was cheese and chocolate for 2, $22 per person and it includes TWO drinks! Pretty cool!

3553505,2018-03-19,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"The melting pot hmmm. Let's just say up until last night it has been a good 10 years since I was there. A lot can change in 10 years. While I love the concept. It's a meal. It's an experience. All of that was amazing I have mixed feelings about it. I went for a post birthday celebration with just my daughter & I.  She's 6. I had the 4 course meal pick 3. We decided on the Spinach Asiago cheese fondue, caprese salad, chicken, pork and angus beef, and the Yin-Yang with white and milk chocolates instead of dark. We did do the cheese and chocolate for 2 (they up-charge for that) & we added the charcuterie board. My daughter had a chocolate milk which is on their online menu and I had a soda. 

Pros: They have a wide variety of Gluten Free things without sacrificing flavor. They have gluten free bread and brownies. Me as a person with Celiacs Disease I appreciate that so much. Having knowledgeable staff in that corner is also amazing as a customer. 
The food was delicious. The experience is amazing. Our waitress was great. The happy birthday plate was gorgeous. The WHOLE meal was DELICIOUS. We left full and happy. 

Cons: Online reservations are so impersonal. The mix they bring you for the cheese is small. For 2 people they load the bread and not a lot of the carrots, broccoli, cauliflower or apples. My daughters chocolate milk was not as advertised but was more money. The booth was great but the table was so tiny. At some point I spilled my soda and wore it for a considerably decent amount of time before someone brought white towels that absorbed. They brought me a happy birthday plate (see pictures) the white cake square was original and not gluten free?! Why couldn't they use a brownie or a chocolate covered strawberry or nothing at all? Also my caprese salad seemed to be missing a piece of mozzarella. There were 4 tomato slices and 3 slices of cheese.",PJo4BfHkvGJPP2iSIWioiw,0,0,4,oAeJQzOMQlHpCQJ8J9fx6g

3561843,2011-02-03,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"The PERFECT date night dinner........in my ever so humble opinion! 

On my first date with my husband, which was practically a BLIND date, he brought me to the Melting Pot. I had never been there before because I was the epitome of the BROKE college kid, and had succumb to the realization that I probably never would. When his invitation arose to join him there for dinner, I was beyond words EXCITED! 
As a female, you'd think I'd be fretting over what to wear that night or how my hair looked, but not I. I was worried about devouring massive amounts of food.......I had heard all about the goodness, and God knows I LOVE TO EAT!!! 
The lighting is very dim, creating a romantic ambiance, and the booths are SMALL.........you have no choice but to get close! Each table is equip with one burner, so if you're not a sharing person, this might not be your cup of tea! 
We shared the BIG NIGHT OUT.....it consisted of a cheese fondue, salads, entree and DESSERT. Holy heck, that was A LOT of food! I seriously could have stopped after the cheese fondue, but then the salad arrived and it looked so fresh and appetizing. After pacing myself, the entree portion was placed in front of us. There was a variety of veggies, meats and seafood to choose from, plus six or so dipping sauces! Dessert.........my absolute favorite part of any meal.........didn't disappoint! Different varieties of chocolate to choose from, plus pound cake, bananas, strawberries, rice krispie treats and brownies! 
*Let me take a moment........................SIGH!* 

I love this place! I love the atmosphere.......I love watching my food cooked in front of me.........I LOVE THE FOOD..........it's simply just GREAT! 
We don't get back often enough, but that's alright by me. Eating like that should only happen during the holidays! :)",o2rgo7amwFR9NGQkMGxrgg,1,1,5,MLOuIZ0w_TMr8r3lqgeNZQ
3576514,2018-05-07,2,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"So I think the easiest way to review this place is to break it down into sections because there is so many layers to this restaurant. So I'll first start with the experience 

Experience-So when you go to the restaurant you have a 1 sided menu and you have to select what kind of cheese you want , the meats you want, and want kind of desert you want. It can be a little confusing at first but the staff there is very helpful and will take the time to explain it to you. After ordering the staff will come bring your cheese out and prepare it right at your table and when it's ready you can dip different breads, apples, and vegetables into the cheese and eat away. Next they bring out your meats as well as a pot of broth and with the cooking forks they provided you put your meat right into the broth and let it cook at the table until it's ready (about 2 minutes). After the meats they bring your chocolate fondue out and make it at the table for you to enjoy. The whole process takes at least 2 hours and you need to be prepared for that so I would highly recommend that you take someone that you like and can hold a conversation because it will be a long night. Based of experience I would give it 4 stars 

Food- so I'm not much of a cheese person but I was down to try and we ordered the bacon mushroom and the cheddar and it was ok at best, no one was raving over it and we had a party of 8 people it was nice that they bring out different items with different textures I dip for the cheese. Next was the meats , I will say the meats was a step higher and I tried everything on the menu because we all got different things, also the presentation was fantastic . My favorite was the andouille sausage and the filet mignon follow by the pork belly, I will say the sauces they brought out to go with the meats were perfect and they had a sauce for every palette. Lastly was desert and I honestly felt like they build you up for this because each serving got better and better and the desert was something that will make you wanna smack your mom. So we ordered the s'mores and bananas fosters and it was truly heavenly!  When they bring the chocolate out they have a little demonstration and they set it on fire and the chocolate melts down and it's ready to eat, the banana fosters was rich but not overly rich and you could taste all the combinations of flavors. What really sets off the desert is the tray of dipping items they bring , marshmallows, strawberries, brownies, cookies, Graham crackers, pineapples and a few other items. It was truly a shame that we didn't start with desert because if I rated solely on desert it would be a 5 star and after tonight next time I go will be for desert only .

Lastly I'll go over the ambience and customer service- the establishment is clean, quaint, has dim lighting , and some soft contemporary music playing , however, it is quite warm In there plus the stove top at the table was making everyone glisten and heat and women's makeup doesn't mix and makes for some interesting conversation lol. The thing that made up for the heat was our server Veronica who was just amazing, she was very attentive, nice, had a big smile and just fit right into our party like she was our friend forever. It's very rare you find a gem like her and when I go back for my desert only I will be asking for her

The melting pot is a very unique experience and is one of those places that you must try once, it's not cheap but by the time you get all the food and desert  it starts to make up for the price but still be ready to hit the atm lol. Know it's a long process but you can always just go for desert and save some time and  money and I promise you will be satisfied and happy plus the staff is great .",PB1PY4NhNu1bNwQCEUcFQQ,4,4,4,Pp1c7p1EbSKue9rnfkr0iA

3607155,2014-02-11,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"A group of friends and I went for a going away dinner. I ordered my own Spinach Salad and the Orange Duck Entree.  The salad was good but felt it was rather skimpy for the price.  The duck was presented nicely on the plate but the clove in the orange marinate was overpowering. There were five of us in the party and for the price of the meals I would rather go somewhere else. For the 16.95 Duck entree you get duck and a few broccoli spears, mushrooms and red bliss potatoes.  If you want anything other than the traditional fondue it is $5.95.   If it is a party of two or less you may get enough food, but I noticed for what our group of 5 ordered there wasn't enough dippers for the vegetables and desserts.  They conveniently combine vegetables for everybody in two bowls and all the dessert on one plate.  Well, how do you know how much each order is suppose to get?  C'mon broccoli, mushrooms and red bliss potatoes are cheap!!  For two dessert orders they put it all on one plate and we only  got 1 square of cheesecake,  When we asked our server about it he just brushed it off without offering to bring us anymore. If you've never been, perhaps as a novelty go check it out but considering I have been there twice by invitation, nah..no reason to go again.",wi0dVER4HBLYEmYHoqu-Ew,0,0,2,rF2WwSnZHBl6TsuwHZ-I5A
3630142,2018-04-16,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Melting Pot is my boyfriend's favorite restaurant, and I had made a reservation for the Sunday after his birthday. Unfortunately, our dinner plans fell through on Friday night, and he suggested we go on Friday night instead. I called the restaurant and asked if they had room for 2 in the next thirty minutes or so and I said yes. Because my boyfriend was in the car, I didn't want to draw attention to the fact that it was his birthday but I also was hoping they would notice when they checked the reservation I had made for Sunday. Luckily, I needn't have worried, when we arrived, they greeted us and wished him a happy birthday and throughout the meal they made a point to make my boyfriend the center of attention, which I appreciated. 
 Our server, Ashley, was the sweetest person ever and went out of her way to make the meal special. She was full of helpful tips and was really good about refilling drinks and making the evening go as smoothly as possible. We started with the French onion cheese fondue which was absolutely fantastic. We followed it with a Caesar salad for my boyfriend and a French onion bisque for me. The salad was delicious as usual, but the bisque stole the show. It was similar to a standard French onion soup in that is had melted cheese, croutons, and cartelized onions but it was different in that it was extremely thick and very very rich. It was perfect for sharing, but a whole bowl would have been a lot of richness for one person. Next, we did the coq a vin fondue with a variety of different meats. Meat isn't really my favorite food so I could take or leave that part of the meal, but my boyfriend loved his stuff. For dessert, we ordered the smores fondue. The only thing I can say is that must be what heaven tastes like. They also brought out a chocolate covered strawberry on a plate that said ""Happy Birthday"" with a candle for my boyfriend which I really appreciated. 
 Now if you look at my past reviews, I've been to other melting pots and was not impressed with the quality for the price. But the Melting Pot in Summerlin changed my Opinion?. The service and atmosphere they provided were exactly what I would expect from a meal of that price, ?and we will definitely be back for our anniversary in August, if not before then!",sgTRJRhaGL__BsJcWaE3qQ,1,0,5,VBJZI4C9BvpnFXUo9tianA

The restaurant provides a relaxing comfortable private seating area to make your night with your partner more intimate. You can show off your so call skills cooking your food ingredients right at the table with your partner together. This creates a productive and fun experience.

But now it seems we have become regulars. Why wait right!!!! Our waitress was Katie and she was amazing. Both times we have been recently we've asked for her and our service is impeccable. The food is always spot on and smells amazing. I started out this time with a melting pot mule, which has become my favorite while we decided on everything else. I highly suggest trying that drink. So First you start with picking up cheese. This time we ended up trying something new so we went with the fiesta and the spinach artichoke both were very good. Then comes the broth to cook your food in. Usually we  get the Bouillon but this time we tried two different cooking styles the Mojo an the Coq au Vin. They smell so good. I have to say the flavor it gave to the food was amazing. I loved the citrus of the Mojo with the lobster and the shrimp. An the Coq au Vin With the vegetables and the steak we're wonderful. Everything was perfect. But you're not finished yet save room for dessert. We ended up trying the Smore's and of course just the original milk chocolate. And again both work great. By the end the night we were so full we couldn't even finish the dessert. Another great night. And a shout out to Katie for amazing service.

I always say that I should only come here for the dessert but somehow always get roped in for one of their combo meals.  Really I could just go for the Cheese starter,skip the ""dinner"" and go straight to dessert.

Dinner portions at the melting pot always scares me because of the cross contamination thing and ""boiling"" protein in the same pot...In addition you get full off all the protein and have to miss out on the pound cake dipped in chocolate.

To start for a group, like ours, the Bignite meal which normally serves two.. will work. You get the cheese fondue, the salad and then we added on two platters of meat and the chocolate paradise(as i call it) It's weird having to cook our own food, but then if a hair got in it, i know who to blame :) :) 
I also ot the ying yang Martini and me and the boyfriend couldn't help but savor each sip. The duck, heavenly, the chicken in the batter was even better.
The bailey's irish chocolate was the best and the service was excellent.
This place is best with friends and family because the food isn't served quickly, and nor should it. It was great having fun with friends and great food.
 ALSO THE service was fantastic! OUR server was the best. He had two tone hair color. I can't remember his name but the best. Also it isn't for the cheapies but there are ways to get discounts like restaurants.com :) we got 25 dollars off. 
The boyfriend says it's made of awesome.. so there guys. That's for you.

We planned a mini date out, just my better half and myself with out the kiddies. Calling the Melting Pot at 9pm to make sure they were still open until 10pm (as promised on the website) and sure enough the phone said so too. We show up and there is a sign on the door apologizing for the inconvenience as they were closing at 9pm... 15 minutes prior to our arrival. Devastation. Babysitters already planned and payed, kids safely tucked away at home, and our first real date in a loooooong time crushed.

I know what you are thinking, ""why did they get 5 stars if you were so devastated?!?""

Well, I will tell you. The manager (Zach) was amazing. I wrote a letter explaining in detail our complete devastation. He apologized thoroughly and said they could not get the message to change when they would be closing. He then treated me and my husband to dinner to ease our suffering. We were able to use the money we would have spent on dinner to pay the babysitters to come back and watch our kids. He came over and greeted us at our table and had Chris take care of us. The service was impeccable. The food was amazing. Overall, LOVED it! We will definitely be going back when we get the chance. I really felt like they gave a hoot about us.

Tip about the meat:
Before when going to the melting pot we didn't pay attention to the length of time they suggested for the meats. We figured we would be able to tell and our food was always overcooked and average. This time we listened to Chris and the food was all perfectly cooked. So when your server tells you how long each thing should be for... LISTEN!",4wHbcKixm6Mh_PpjnaDTeQ,3,0,5,sYwYeYDKtCaxkX5mlQJacw

We arrived a little bit before our reservation, and they were able to seat us immediately! The decor is a nice, dim lit restaurant, with enough light to see what you're doing, but not a blinding amount. The food is delicious. They have a wide range of cheeses, meats, and deserts you can order. The Banana Fosters was so much fun! He lit it on fire and sprinkled cinnamon, so it was like a firework show at our table! 

Our server, Tyler, really sealed the deal. We got to our table, and he was incredible! He was funny, relatable, and extremely knowledgeable. He explained the entire menu, down to a simple science, and was even able to help my stubborn grandparents, who had never been to Melting pot before. He made recommendations on cheeses(The Wisconsin trio was amazing!), and even explained which dipping sauces mix well together, and what to dip each item in. His service was very attentive, and I never found myself with an issue, empty drink, or complaint. His service made our visit extraordinary, and that's why i felt like making a yelp account, simply to praise this amazing visit!

My one complaint is the table controllers; The controller for one of our hot plates was right next to one of our chairs. I feel like rebuilding the tables to have the controllers at the end of the table would be easier. A couple times in the night, he had to reach in front of me to change the temperature of the plate. Slightly inconvenient, but they did a very good job of being polite about it, and it was only for a few seconds when we did have to change it.

I liked it, but since I have lived in Switzerland and have had real Swiss fondues there its kinda hard to impress me;) lol). The mushroom and spinach salad was ok, nothing special. The entree was by far my favorite. There was ahi tuna, shrimp, teriyaki beef and thin slices of steak, and chicken, plus fresh mushrooms,  broccoli, and potatoes. The chocolate fondue was pretty tasty as well. I asked to substitute marshmallows for extra strawberries and they brought us an extra bowl of strawberries. I thought that was nice.

Took the gf here for our 3 year anniversary the day after Valentine's. As you can imagine, it's been 3 days of feasting since we both had to work Valentine's so we celebrated a day early and then of course had to eat on Valentine's and now here to complete the trio.

Gf's favorite meal is shabu shabu, so Melting Pot is the fancy equivalent...or so I thought.

Got the Four Course Special:

1) Battled between the Spinach Artichoke and the Fiesta...gf won out with the Spinach. But I liked it too. Was starving and wiped the fondue stainless bowl clean. 4 stars

Note 1: pace yourself, it's a marathon not a sprint.
Note 2: the cheese gets progressively hotter the nearer you get to the end.

2) GF chose the spinach mushroom salad, I chose the Big Night Out monthly special salad, basically 1/4 uncut lettuce with gorgonzola cheese and bacon. Liked mine, loved my gf's! 5 stars

3) Then came the land and sea. :/ Loved the concept of dipping meats and seafood. Picked the red wine broth. Really didn't add any flavor to the protein. And the cooking style was truly a compromise.  1 star.

4) Wow, dessert is melted chocolate. Need I say more? The best were the brownies the worst were the marshmallows but is there really a worst, not really, it was just in comparison and because I don't really care for marshmallows other than at a campfire and even then, it's for the fire show rather than the taste. 5 stars.

Average it out: it's a 3 star, with a heavy weight on entrees. If this was a dessert and appetizer place, it would have been a 5 star!

Service was knowledgeable and professional, though could feel our server winding down for the night as we were one of the last tables. But definitely still very pleasant service!",sXnw6JMtCRFCiWRWCcM-bA,2,0,3,T4pmQzSSU8kbmsVaiEhtbQ

4134600,2010-08-18,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"I went here for my bday last year in 2009. This has to be the best fondue I have ever had. Not only was the food delicious, our waitress, Amanda, was an amazing. She was very attentive and extremely friendly. There was a card and flowers waiting for me on our table that my boyfriend had the staff place. We ordered the Fondue Fusion which, for the first course, included our choice of cheese fondue, salad, a main course, and dessert. We picked the Traditional Cheese Fondue made up of Gr√πyere and Emmenthaler Swiss cheeses, white wine, garlic, nutmeg, lemon and Kirschwasser. The cheese came with bread, apples, and veggies to dip. I absolutely love cheese, however this mixture was a bit too bitter and I would not order it again. For the next course we ordered a Caprese Salad made up of mixed field greens topped with fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and basil with a balsamic glaze. The third course was the main course which consisted of a Lobster Tail, Filet Mignon Florentine, Limoncello Balsamic Sirloin, Shrimp Diablo, Sun-dried Tomato Chicken, Orange Fennel Pork Tenderloin, Porcini and Portobello Sacchetti, and Fresh Vegetables. While all those meats were delicious, next time, I dont think I would order all of them. Since we ordered the fondue fusion, we got every kind they had, they have different options with less amounts. We picked a canola oil spiced blend to cook the meat in, since they do give it to you raw, and you cook it yourself. Finally the dessert course came....it was AMAZING. We had a Chocolate S'mores fondue, made with milk chocolate, marshmallow fluff, and crushed graham crackers. To dip in the chocolate was strawberries, bananas, pound cake, brownies, rice crispy treats, cheesecake and marshmallows. I dont think you could go wrong with any of the choices of chocolate, they all sounded delicious. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place, and would definitely go back again. However when and if you do go, be prepared to spend at least $100-150.00.",2KXR93JrBu2FOjFIhy0QzA,0,0,5,3fTReKpnzYR6zoJ28qvqSw

Cons - Service and attitude.

We made reservations for a group of 20 two weeks ahead of time. 

When we arrived the hostess replied that she would get the room ready now...hum. Couldn't have done that a bit earlier?

Drinks took over an hour. Server said the bar was busy. We got our drinks in two shifts about 30 minutes apart so half of us were drinking and the other half was just sitting there. Obviously no food yet. Remember that we had reservations two weeks ahead of time so they knew that they may need additional staff.

Food was started an hour after we arrived. The pots are double boilers. There is an inner pot with water and the fondue goes in the outer pot. We had been here so long that one of the pots ran dry and scorched the food. More delays.

I could make this a novel but won't. It took 40 minutes to get our checks...40 minutes after we asked for our checks.

We asked for a manager - none came.

Also, DO NOT be in a hurry if you plan to eat here comfortably. We were here for 2 hours! But it was a great and unique experience. I've never had fondue before, and I really enjoyed everything. 
We got the spinach and artichoke cheese dip to start, which was great with the bread and veggies, but a little weird with the apples. Our salads were very good, but very small (a good thing considering it is a 4 course meal). The meat dishes took the longest to go through because you get 3 skewers to use, and it takes 3 minutes to cook each piece of meat. But by the end of it, you barely have any room for dessert. We chose the chocolate and peanut butter fondue, which was an excellent choice, but I only had a little of it because I was so full. Over all, I really enjoyed everything, my only gripe comes from our waitress mixing up our cheese fondue so aggressively, she splashed my arm with the hot fondue and didn't seem to notice or slow down.

Be sure to sign up for their email club so you get notifications about their special deals. They'll also send you a coupon for free chocolate covered strawberries for your birthday and anniversary. 

The menu had changed a bit since our last visit, but they still had all of my favorites! 

One of the current Cheese specials was bacon jalape√±o. We chose to do that, but with no jalape√±o (although they let you dictate the amount - none, some, extra). It was fantastic! They were also great enough to bring out extra apples for dipping (extra dippers are no extra cost!). 

I would definitely recommend the California Salad - its my favorite! Candied pecans, bleu cheese and tomatoes on a bed of mixed greens. 

My husband was torn between his old standby Entree of the creole or trying something new - an Asian Entree with teriyaki and dumplings. We opted to get both and share! However, I did ask that the seafood on the creole plate be replaced with their current pasta. Again, no extra charge on this because obviously the pasta is less expensive. I'm not much for their seafood and their pasta here is so good! Also, the perfect portion for me. 

The entrees come with six different dipping sauces, all of which are quite yummy. But we always ask for extras of the curry, the green goddess and the bleu cheese. 

For dessert, we thought about trying something new, but ended up just going with our usual choice of dark chocolate. I requested extra marshmallows, brownies and blondes because those are my favorites! They also brought out a plate of dipped strawberries to eat there (the others were to take home) and wrote happy Anniversary on the plate. 

This is a special place that's perfectly romantic and we will return again and again. All of the courses allow plenty of time to really sit and talk - it's wonderful!

We decided to go with the four course choices since overall it seemed like a better deal then doing just individual entrees. For starters we had the Wisconsin trio fondue which was AMAZING! It came with veggies, bread pieces and apples. Personally I liked the apples best. 

For entrees I had the Vegas fusion and my boyfriend had the French quarter. I tried some of his which had a Cajun spice to it, very good but not as delicious as mine. Every item was sooooo good. The lobster, duck and sirloin were my favorites. The complimentary sauces were great too. Personally I loved the curry and teriyaki. 

Then for dessert aka heaven we went with the yin yang fondue. It was a mix of dark and white chocolate and unbelievably good. It came with pieces of brownie, fruit and a few other sweet treats.

4744286,2010-07-18,4,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"For me, The Melting Pot is one of those places that you go to for one reason.  Like how there was only one reason to ever watch Baywatch (Pamela), or only one reason to watch Nascar (crashes).  With the Melting Pot, you're not going for the models or piles of wrangled metal, you're going for the dessert.  

My first visit was exactly that, a trip to Melting Pot with a group of friends to find some tasty dessert.  Being chocolate fiends that night, our group of six ordered:

Cookies 'n Cream Marshmallow Dream: Dark chocolate topped with marshmallow cream, flamb√©ed, swirled together and garnished with crushed Oreo cookies.

Flaming Turtle: Milk chocolate, caramel and chopped pecans, flamb√©ed tableside.

Both desserts were absolutely delicious, and were served with fresh strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice Krispies treats, marshmallows, pound cake and brownies to dip into the fondues.  All of these dippings went well with the chocolate-y fondue.  Though, if you go with friends, go for the pound cake and brownies first before they get to it...

Fast forward a couple weeks and my friend and I come here for dinner.  Our meal consisted of:

First Course: Feng Shui Cheese Fondue, served with bread, vegetables and apples

Salad: The Melting Pot House Salad with Peppercorn Ranch Dressing (delicious!)

Entree: Pacific Rim - teriyaki sirloin, shrimp, pork, duck, chicken and potstickers.

At the end of the meal, both my dining partner and I agreed that the overall experience was good, but not great.  I'm glad that I've had a chance to experience a meal here, but nothing blew me away.  I actually felt sad that we were too full to not make it to dessert, which would have been the best part!  

I will say this, though: I much prefer the shabu shabu/sukiyaki experience.  Having one pot per person and using chopsticks to eat just seems to make everything go smoother; compared to one pot and six skewers sticking out the top of it.

4810479,2010-02-15,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"I should have written this review a while ago. Took the F there for her birthday in late January. Fantastic.

Everyone from the hostess to the manager wished her a happy birthday on her way in, they had a birthday card waiting for her on the table, and the waiter knew it was her birthday as well. This restaurant has the most put together staff of anywhere I've been in a while. The waiter rivals the one from my Maggiano's review, and will be mentioned more later, but I really believe you won't be treated better in any Las Vegas restaurant then you will be in The Melting Pot.

I've never been to a Melting Pot before but she had so she explained the menu before we went. They have a meal called a 'Big Night Out' which is a 'course' menu; a cheese fondue, a salad, an entree fondue, and a dessert fondue. When we went the traditional menu was supplemented with an Alpine themed menu, which gives an additional option for the cheese, salad, and dessert course, but we were encouraged to pick and choose what mixes we would like from the traditional menu as well. Quite nice. 

We went with the Alpine menu's cheese and salad course, the court bouillon entree cooking style, and bananas foster dessert. I thought the cheese course was very good. If you opt for the Alpine cheese course be sure to try the pickles in the fondue. It sounds odd but was one of the highlights of the meal. The salad was acceptable but we decided we would probably go with a different choice next time. The entree was fantastic, and the dessert was one of the best we've ever had. We rarely order dessert but it was well worth it here; if you're also the type that usually passes, make this the exception.

Again, service was excellent. Our waiter was spot on, very polite and attentive. Able to answer all questions and he made some great recommendations.  

I don't recall them having liquor or beer, but they have a very nice wine list. I was able to find some liquor on the dessert menu which was a nice surprise. They've got a fair selection of cordials, cognacs, and brandies and a nice collection of scotch, if that's your thing. I'm not a scotch man, so I'll have to take my father here and report further.

Obviously, if I haven't said it enough, this was a great night out, especially considering it was her birthday. A great restaurant with a great staff.",LJPlDsqBS-TvR4LKnhRvLg,2,1,5,g5yMpX2D6psoMu_LeRD5oA

The waiter finally came out with the cheese plate after I hit the hostess stand for some candy to get me by.  The cheese was excellent, especially with the bread.  I was temporarily mollified with cheese and waited for the next course (Land and Sea).  And waited.  A person brought out a dirty pot and assumed that was an acceptable way to serve a very expensive entree.  I asked for a new pot and another person felt it was acceptable to wipe the pot with a dirty rag.  Rolls eyes.  The meat was good but not as much as it was in the past.  No dessert and we still rolled out of there full.  I was advised not to complain (bad karma) and left quietly.  Will not be back.  Hopefully a competitor of Melting Pot will hit the Las Vegas scene.

The evening is fantastic, it takes about 2.5 hours or more, and it's a great pace.  You are never in a rush, and it's certainly a different way to dine.

So, when we went to Melting Pot last night, I was troubled to learn that the menu had changed.  The Big Night Out which we had shared so many times was gone, replaced with a more a la carte ordering system.  You order by the person now, still having to share the cheese and dessert courses with the table as a whole.  Already, I was annoyed by the change in the menu.  THEN, I open the wine list to find fewer than 10 wines by the glass in white, even fewer in red, and only a page of wines period.  This is much, much less than Melting Pot used to have. I pointed this out to our server, and she informed me I was correct, the wine list had been paired down significantly.  Apparently the decision was made to simplify things.  Of course, I imagine stocking pricier bottles was not paying off, and I certainly understand a restaurant needing to make changes based on the bottom line.  But, it certainly affected my meal and will affect my decision whether to come in the future.

The meal was a solid Melting Pot meal.  We had the Wisconsin trio, an excellent blend of cheeses.  We asked our server to go heavy on the blue cheese and garlic, and she obliged in spades.  Excellent flavor.  The cajun platter and lobster fusion were next, and while good, the meat course left a little to be desired.  I feel like the portions are smaller, but I can't prove this.  I will say the shrimp was the favorite meat, and that's saying something when we ordered a dish with steak and lobster.  A tip if you eat here, put the mushrooms and potatoes in IMMEDIATELY.  The potatoes still weren't completely cooked by the end of the meal.  That's always been an issue with Melting Pot.  I would think there is a way to fix it, but I haven't seen it yet.

The dessert was the star of the meal.  We had the white chocolate creme brulee.  White chocolate with caramelized sugar drizzled on top.  Excellent, very glad we tried the special dessert.  My favorite in meals past was always the main course, but today it was the desserts.  I'm not saying we won't come back to Melting Pot, but the chances are much slimmer than they were yesterday before our meal.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,3,1,3,alnXFPGb9DoeYxtaV4c2YQ

Did big night out both times- comes with a salad, cheese fondue, a entree with various meats and seafood and veggies with a cooking pot of liquids/spices to cook meat in, and a dessert fondue. 

I find this fun. I like to do japanese shabu shabu so the entree cooking is real similar but I see that its not for everyone though specially people who dont quite know how to gauge how done their food is get frustrated or grossed out by this. They give you a lot of flavor options and to me some dont work- I like to cook in coq au vin and dip mostly veggies and seafood in the various sauces, marinated meats I eat rather plainly. BF and I enjoyed doing this and we were sooo stuffed, uncomfortable even from all the food.

 I recommend at least for people to do the cheese or dessert as those can be appealing to anyone. I love the dessert pots here and would come just for the dessert. I really like the disaronno one- amaretto with white chocolate and they rotate new flavors and some have been very good.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,0,0,4,wiu8tEQV_EwEOsCpVoI4Eg

My favorite restaurant of all time! The first time I went to the Melting Pot was December 2007. At that time I remember spliting the Big Night Out special. I left there about ready to collapse...it was a ridiculous amount of food for two. 

October 2008. Learning from my previous experience, I decided to skip on the four course meal experience. My friend and I ordered the cheese fondue, salad, and chocolate fondue. Everything was so SOOOO good. We ordered the Wisconsin trio (cheese)...we were not disappointed. Our (gorgeous) waiter suggested that we give the Spinach Artichoke Cheese fondue the next time we come back. I had the California Walnut salad. The first time I had it, I remember liking it a lot, but this time around, there was too much dressing. I felt as if I was taking forkfuls of the vinagrette dressing. 

And for the grand finale, we ordered the Cookies n Creme Marshmallow Dream chocolate fondue. Delicious! I loved when the waiter came over to prepare the fondue. It's such a cool display--my friend recorded it on her camera. On the platter, there was cheesecake, brownie bites, marshmallows, rice crispy treats, pound cake, strawberries, and bananas.",hFGYC-wjaZCSuhMdO8K_Tw,0,0,5,ce0uJzHcZDKpA67E-nCBcA

My husband and I arrived 15 minutes early before our guests to scope out the menu..The items are kinda on the pricey side. But, I figured what the hay! You can only celebrate your bday once..right? Upon my guest arriving come to find out we all were new to this experience. The food kinda lacked seasoning and was in very small proportions. Our food took quite awhile to cook. 

Needless to say don't come here hungry, cause you will leave the same way you walked in. I've realized this is more so for like heavy socializing .

For our entrees I had the angus beef and 2 portions of the key west Shrimp and my husband had the angus, duck breast, sirloin, and mushroom pasta. Frankie put all the ingredients for the cheese pot and we enjoyed it with tortilla chips, different breads, and green apples. The green apples surprisingly went well with the cheese pot. The house sald was good. It was standard but tasted well with the garlic and wine seasoning Frankie put on the table. For the entrees we were given 6 different type of sauces to experiment with. I really loved the strong cocktail sauce with my shrimp. When the portions came out, it didn't look so big but it was definitely filling!
The chocolate pot was amazing! It came with strawberries, bananas, pineapples, graham cracker coated marshmellows, rice krispy treats, pound cake, and brownies. I really loved the toasted coconut shavings in the chocolate pot!

You get to choose a cheese fondue for your first course, with veggies & bread for dipping. Each person gets to choose a salad (I miss the old mushroom salad, but the new one is good). Then a cooking style for your main course (Coq a Vin is delicious, and the regular boullion is not bad at all). And lastly, you choose from a chocolate fondue for your dessert plate, all are delicious!
If you have 6 people you end up with 2 burners, and you can choose 2 cheese, cooking styles & chocolates.
Drinks are a little expensive, and the food is slightly overpriced, but in my opinion you are paying for the experience. Good times!",4wpV4DZlNxQ2xG_O3Y9lSg,3,1,4,uUs_j2olMHm1Bn-mDPZVvQ

We ordered the Fiesta   cheese fondue and we ordered the spinach and artichoke cheese fondue. The spinach and artichoke cheese fondue was delicious and we preferred that over the fiesta. The fiesta cheese fondue is not spicy it's very mild however the spinach and artichoke contain more of an herb infused essence with much more flavoring to it.
For our second course we ordered the salads. Then we moved to the next round of fondue which was the cooking of the meat.   We ordered the Caribbean based fondue broth and we ordered a another one that contain I think like a beef broth type feel to it.

5360586,2011-04-02,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"You wouldn't believe this if I tell you that this is definitely the PERFECT family restaurant, great for kids!  Well, if your kids are cheese fanatics like mine are...oh, and I guess I should add that they are also chocolate fanatics as well, but what normal kid isn't a fan of chocolate?

We dined here on ""Mommy's"" birthday, and although everyone touts this place as being very ""romantic"" and ""perfect for date night,"" I will have to admit...we looked beyond that and thought of the kids first.  They completely enjoyed having to dip their own food into the cheese fondue and more!

The Melting Pot is an amazing restaurant that really defines a great dining experience.  Don't dine here if you are looking to feast on some heavy dishes.  Come here for the great interactive experience of dipping your bite-sized morsels into a variety of fondue to capture this experience popularized by its origin countries of Switzerland and France.

We chose the prix fixe menu, their 4-course Big Night Out menu.  To start, we had their Spinach and Artichoke Cheese Fondue made of Fontina and Butterkase Cheeses, perfect for the kids.  It is accompanied with fresh bread, apples, and vegetables.  The second course is their salad course.  We chose their Shrimp Ceviche w/Avocado Salad...tasty, but a bit on the over-dressed, tangy side.  Next was the entree course.  We requested the Lobster Indulgence which included 2 tails, NY strip, chicken provencal, white shrimp, duck a l'orange, and a ravioli (or potsticker).  If that isn't enough, you can order more a la carte.  We chose the Mojo fondue which is a citrus, garlic and cilantro flaired bouillon w/Caribbean seasonings.  Had the kids not been there, I would have opted for the more traditional Coq Au Vin fondue...always love me some red wine!  And of course, lastly, the dessert fondue!  Dark chocolate w/a bit of dulce de leche and a sprinkle of Fleur de Sel, or sea salt.  Truly decadent!  Choices to dip?  Strawberries, bananas, pound cake, brownies, cheesecake, rice krispie treats, and oreo-crusted and graham cracker-crusted marshmallows, were all inhaled within minutes...mainly by the children, of course.  Did I mention that this place is a perfect family restaurant?

Their wine list is also amazing, nationally recognized as one of the best in any national restaurant chain.  Mommy & Daddy were able to say *C*H*E*E*R*S* w/a bottle of Old World Red, 2005 Rioja Reserva, Marquesde Riscal.  Very smooth!

Service is upscale and very friendly.  Although a bit pricey, my husband and I, along with the 2 kids, enjoyed our dinner and celebrating our special occasion here.  Highlight of the night was my son constantly raving this place to be 5-stars, 6-stars after he had the dessert.  My reason for the 4-star rating is simply this:  I'm a fan for this dining experience, but I don't think this is a place to dine often enough other than to celebrate a yearly occasion.  Yet, I have to say that The Melting Pot is truly spectacular!",xozBOvi6cWO_p1OdteF9zw,3,3,4,TyOEkZEJaWx44Xg8DPoUyg

It is often pushed to the back as a special occasions type of place. That does not mean that I do not try to find a reason to come, but after they shut down the one on Eastern, the idea of fondue slipped away. I was reminded that there was a second location in Summerlin and it was perfect because one of my old professors lived on this side of town. With convenience for her in mind, my friend and I drove out here for dinner with her.

I had forgot to make a reservation on a Friday night, but we were seated as soon as the whole party was present. As a party of four, all we wanted was the cheese and chocolate course. If you are starving then the Big Night Out is the way to go. Two courses was more than enough for us. The portions of sides to swirl in cheese is minimal. It is nice that the servers have no issue with a request for more veggies, bread, or granny smith apples. The same about portions could be said about their desserts too. With chocolate, I have no issues of ladling the chocolate straight into my mouth though. 

A few hours later, a full stomach, and some wonderful conversation left us all in a place of joy. Now to plan another special event.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,2,5,W9rHT3udcZ0j0SH-YusL1Q

We tried the 4 course meal which was fantastic! We ordered the Spinach artichoke cheese fondue which was absolutely amazing. We tried the cheese fondue with pears, apples, bread, and veggies. For the entr√©e course I ordered the filet mignon and it was very generous portion, the only downside was the smell of raw meat. It was fun cooking your food but it felt a little crammed at the table for 3 people. When it came time for another cocktail, our server was nowhere to be found. He came back to our table to ask how our entr√©e was and as we were going to order dessert he walks away in mid order. We had to keep asking another waiter to please get our server so we could order dessert. So 10 minutes later, our server finally takes our order for dessert and we ordered the Flaming Turtle chocolate fondue.

I was still wanting a few more pieces of tofu to fill me up. I usually get an extra side of tofu. The side comes with around 4-6 pieces. It is the perfect amount. However, when I asked for a side the waiter said that the new menu doesn't offer sides anymore. He told us that we would have to get another 3 or 4 course meal. This would be an extra $25. That is ridiculous. I definitely would recommend to the staff to start up sides again. I did not get the extra order. I would have been fine paying $5-$10 for a few extra pieces, but that was not an option. Because this wasn't an option, I didn't spend more money. I believe that it is very ridiculous to not have sides. Especially if someone doesn't want many pieces, just a few. Just a thought.",K4becgYFxpo5s-Gabg8x1Q,0,0,4,qFIuBDfEvlun3GGvgvpzTA

We had her once before on Valentine's Day 2016. We were lucky enough to have her again. She is so upbeat and friendly. Always asking us if we needed anything. Explained everything we needed to know. We had the 4 course meals. My husband had the French Quarter and I had the Steak Lovers. So excellent!  Our first course was the cheese fondue. We had the Wisconsin Cheddar. It is so amazing!  Second course we had salad (my husband is not a salad eater so he skipped this).  I got the peppercorn ranch salad. Also good. Then we got our main course. My steaks were so good along with the potatoes and broccoli that came with it. All the dipping sauces were really good.  Our last course dessert! We got the Yin & Yang!  So so delicious!

5588855,2015-03-28,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"After all this time, I finally get to try The Melting Pot! On our recent honeymoon to Paris, I was going to try fondue for the FIRST TIME! I was sooo excited and then sooo sadly disappointed. There were so many restrictions. I didn't get to really try anything except dipping my flavorless meats into a boiling pot of oil. I didn't enjoy my experience at all.. So the husband promised to take me to The Melting Pot when we got back to the states. So here I am!

We went with a 4 course dinner. 

Started off with the cheddar cheese pot and added Italian meats. The cheese was so tasty! It was cheesy with a hint of beer. But the bitter beer essence made the dish even more gratifying - and I don't like beer! This course usually only comes with bread, vegetables, and apples. But I am so glad we added the meats. They're excellent with the cheese. 

The second course was the salad. I ordered a Caesar and the hubby ordered the house salad. The Caesar was much better of a choice. But im biased.. I LOVE Caesar's salad! The house salad, although the sauce is homemade, tasted like French dressing. It was.. plain. 

The third course was a broth fondue. We went with the mojo flavor which is both garlicky and lemony. It was great and went well with all our meats. We ordered a Classic and the Fondue Delight to give us the most variety of meats and seafood. So delicious. My husband was also a big big fan of the Garlic and Wine powder they gave us to add as seasoning. With 3 fondue forks each, we cooked meats and seafood at the same time. Seafood cooks faster so you get to still eat while waiting for your chicken and red meat to cook.

The fourth course was dessert fondue and we went with The Original. It was chocolatey with chunks of peanut butter. It went well with everything! We also added the cheesecake and raspberry. Delicious. 

I was solo happy with my experience and I would definitely come back! I loved this place. With all our additions and sangria to boot, the meat ended up costing us ~$150 but that's a steal for all the food we got!! We left stuffed and happy.",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,2,0,5,SK7BdPV7DJdTMr9dszq_Og

The things to dip in the cheese were horrible carrots that were too small to poke, bread that was old and crusty and apples that were soggy.
I would not go back to this place ever; we will make fondue at home for cheaper :) I didn't get the chocolate that everyone raves about because we were so disappointed with the cheese.",s7gMQwX2zansoCEXzvulvQ,4,0,1,hF_57hk8aFHeWzKK50-zJA

5811283,2015-12-09,4,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"We have been here MANY times over the years. This past time I would have to say it was a bit disappointing.

I can understand it is a dining experience and different than a lot of restaurants but for the prices paid there should be more food than what is put on a plate and brought out to be shared. Never enough veggies to put in the soup mixture and the meat portions have gone way down.

My son and husband are big eaters and they were both still hungry when we were done and we ordered a lot,

We always love the cheese fondue as well as the chocolate and we always have to ask for more to dunk in the chocolate as well.

The Dinner pictures are from this past time and the Chocolate fondue pictures were from our Easter Visit Both times there was 4 of us. 

We also ordered 2 bottles of wine.. So our bill was not cheap, Its a shame places have to change over the years. 
You can tell when a place cuts back,  Why raise prices then?

This would have been a 5 star for sure if everyone was full , We love coming here but we are kinda hesitant to go anymore.. 
 
Service was not too bad.. We only had to wait a couple of times for  the server to come back so we could ask for a few more veggies, Other wise he was pretty good.

Atmosphere is nice, I love the booths they are kinda private and yet a little romantic feel if you were to come here on a date,

Would we recommend? 
If you want to have some good food, cook for yourself is kinda fun ~ Kinda expensive for what you get, 
Would we go back?

5851029,2007-06-29,0,hHe1mFDxxrtejXHfiysJJg,"Located in Boca Park at the corner of  Charleston and Ft. Apache.  Accross from Office Depot.

A great place for a fun night out.  Be it an intimate dinner for two or for a large group like our entire office, the Melting Pot is a fun and delicious way to spend an evening.  Honestly, even at a bare minimum, expect to spend at least three hours there.

We went for one of the the pre-made combinations called ""The Big Night Out"", since it had everything that we wanted. Filets/Duck/Lobster YUM

The combinations consist of three courses.

- The Appetizers - a selection of fresh veggies, breads and cheeses with your choice of fondue using a variety of cheeses.  Cheese on Cheese... it's such a delicious crime YUM

-The main course - Consisting of fresh meats(Filets, Chicken, Duck) and possibly seafood(Lobster, Shrimp, etc) depending on which combo you ordered. And your choice of stock.  We went for the coq au vin which is chicken broth with scallions, red wine, etc.

-Desserts - We went for the Yin Yang, which is a variety of brownies,marshmallows (Graham Covered/Oreo Covered) and fruits.  The best part is the fondue consisting of white and dark chocolate arranged into a Yin/Yang symbol.  Awesome presentation.

Our server was extremely helpful as this was our first visit and patiently and humorously explained everything to us.

One thing that made my eyebrow raise though is the fact that they charged us the full adult price for my 8 year old nephew.   So just be aware of this if you are planning on bringing kids.

If I recall correctly the combos are about 75$

- Reservations are HIGHLY recommended.  As mentioned earlier,  dinner here takes a few hours, so they can only serve a few groups per night.

- This place is always a great date idea if you want some guaranteed quality time toget to know your partner. (Just make sure you can entertain her/him for the entire 3 hours or else it'll be torture)

- To complement the Yin/Yang dessert, they also have a Chocolate Martini that is also presented in Yin/Yang fashion.",j3Xr0XifJTb43Hdmue8b9A,2,0,4,wlKcDzDqL9A7piKrFUM9Lg
