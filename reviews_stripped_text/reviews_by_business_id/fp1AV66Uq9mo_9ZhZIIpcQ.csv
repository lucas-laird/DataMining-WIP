He gets it 15 mins later, no harm, no foul. We got home and the pizza is so greasy and disgusting that it is pretty much just falling apart and my kids won't even eat it. Trust me, that's saying a lot of how gross it was when my kids won't eat a cheese pizza. Called and talked to the manager Kenny and asked if we could have it delivered since they messed up twice. He said there's no way they could do that, it's for carry out only. I asked then if we could get another pizza for free since they messed up our order twice and my husband now has to drive all the way over there AGAIN due to their mistake. He said no, and offered us cheese sticks. I said we already ordered cheese sticks and we don't need anymore but an extra pizza would be nice. He offered me Wings and we don't eat wings, so I said a plain cheese pizza is about the same price so why cant we get something like that that we can actually eat because it's an hour of waiting now to eat some food due to their mess ups. All he would offer is to remake it. So my husband's going to pick it up now, but I'm hesitant to eat it because who knows what they've done to it now that I pissed them off, and the quality was so poor to begin with. I have ordered here many times, but I won't be back. Ridiculous that they can't offer a better customer service. Especially when I order there frequently. I can see from past reviews that this is a common occurrence.

Updates 1/1/18: sitting in this effing place for 25 mins after scheduled pick up time trying to give them one more chance. After sitting here for 20 mins they magically realized they missed cooking some of my pizzas. I have had guests waiting at my house for me for the last 30 mins. This place is just terrible. Offered me free breadsticks but WHY did you not know until 20 mins of me sitting here that my shit wasn't correct? Worst Pizza Hut ever. Same manager as last time.

She advise us of the promotion that they were having and we ended up getting a lare pizza plus additional chicken wings.  She was just so kind and sincerely wanted to help us. When the order came out, she made sure we were happy with how the chicken wings looked as well as the pizza. I go to a lot of pizza joints and it's really rare to see such great customer service.

958319,2017-12-02,0,fp1AV66Uq9mo_9ZhZIIpcQ,"Such a horrible first time experience with this location specially from Kenny(manager) and Bianca. I just moved in a new community and it don't exist on the map. So I first called in to make sure what I needed to do since it don't exist on the map when you order online. I called and spoke with Kenny (manager) to verify if they deliver at my location by explaining to him my location and he said yes. He informed me to order online for the special and that he could change the address so order was in and called back to give current address and Bianca answered. I spoke with Bianca and informed her I spoke with Kenny(manager) about my location and now all of a sudden they are saying I'm located north of the cut off to where they deliver after confirming with the Kenny(manager). Added to that why wouldn't you listen to your customer when they are telling you and giving you directions of the location instead of looking it up on Zillow and google maps. You keep telling me you know for sure I'm located past the cut off delivery location when you haven't been here before and it's not on the maps and then the nerve you hang up on me. What a poor customer service. I always give the benefit of the doubt on yelp reviews until I've experienced this today, now I why this store has 2 stars. If I could give no stars to this location for a review that would be a big fat 0 stars. Kenny (manager) definitely needs some training for the way how you treat and talk to your customers. Kenny (manager) and Bianca you just need listen to what customers are telling you on location instead of assuming and looking it up on Zillow and google maps like you said on the phone. Also don't tell your customers to put a different address and correct it after the order has been placed and say you don't deliver to my location after the fact that I'm told a few minutes before the order was made that you do definitely deliver in this community after I told you the major cross street.",RzmMXmy-Nm94QgEAn-KuLg,1,0,1,8YJeLwt8kuYEQXAp2mEBsg

2146481,2017-04-02,0,fp1AV66Uq9mo_9ZhZIIpcQ,"TL;DR- MAIN reason for two stars- employees. Long wait. Pizza was good though, and came out correctly. 

Oh lord....
Ordered online for pickup on 3/31/17. 
Placed ordered at 6:34pm- just two normal pizzas- I got a notification saying it should be ready in 10-20 minutes. Got there at 6:55pm. There was a screen in the corner that had our name and said order would be ready at 6:49pm... and it was 6:55.... not a big deal, computers get it messed up. 
Sat down after paying. First red flag. Jared, the kid at the counter, took our money without saying more than ""what's the name on your order?"" Not very friendly or inviting. For the duration of my wait, I never saw him smile at a single customer. For a Friday night at about 7, there wasn't much going on. Me, two ladies, and one guy who seemed to be waiting for an order. Now this is the thing that REALLY bothered me-- the phone started ringing almost as soon as I sat down after paying. There was no one else there yet... Jared just would NOT pick it up... some girl came up to pay, and he took that, but still wouldn't pick up the phone! This phone was ringing for at least ten minutes before he picked it up! I feel so bad for whoever was calling. Just for no reason-he was RIGHT there- he did not pick it up. Why? He didn't feel like it or something? He was doing absolutely nothing. Also, I saw people walking around in the back who seemed to not be doing anything. And some lady (older, short, red (ish?) hair) came up to address someones concern... uh, for what I presume to be a manager, she was very unkempt. Her hair was everywhere, she kept sighing and rubbing her eyes talking to this customer as though she were tired, sick, or just sick AND tired of talking to customers. She was one of the people I saw just walking around and seemingly not doing anything.
A little less bothersome, because I have no idea- maybe y'all had a bunch of deliveries- but the wait was very long for two medium pizzas... like I said, I ordered at 6:34pm. I believe we walked out of there a little after 7:10pm. 
Look, I know you guys just opened. I think a lot of these kinks could be worked out with a change in staff, or a change in HEART of the current staff. Yeah, kids may be desperate for a job, but don't hire them just because they're not as demanding, when they can't treat customers right. Maybe there are some other kids working really hard in the back. But if so, don't keep the one kid with no people skills, who doesn't care, in the front. On a Friday night?! When there will inevitably be more business than usual?! Staffing wasn't thought through.... 
I hope that I'm convinced to update my review through more visits and better experiences.
**EDIT- Just to add! Think about putting a tip jar up front for cash tips! Might motivate front employees a little more....",MFEMVNd4NdteCE_Fdvw-lA,1,0,2,D6jgax3VGN73BpGQR4U8Xg
2308144,2017-07-24,1,fp1AV66Uq9mo_9ZhZIIpcQ,"Had a really bad experience with calling in my order here. The person on the phone was rude because of his condescending comments. Comments that weren't necessary to express. When I called back to  create an additional note to the order he made a mistake, didn't own up to it, and blamed it on a different representative. It was the same representative because his voice and comments were recognizable. I understand that he could've had a bad day, or the job itself is just not fulfilling his happiness which shows through his tone of voice, but as GENERAL MANAGER of the store I would expect his customer service to be the best and to give a great example to his employees around him. 

KENNY, if you're reading this comment I know you can do better in your services for taking orders over the phone. The coupon/discount you offered and added to my order is a great start. Please strive for offering a better customer experience for the betterment of your work ethic and to show your employees the right way to take orders over the phone.

Not too much of an issue. I saw some pizzas go in their warmer and until I came up about 5 minutes later to see if they know what happened to my order, they went to pull it out. I brought it home later to a party just to realized their dough was undercooked and didn't rise. It was hard as stale breadsticks. I called to tell the store manager the issue and he said he could remake it now or let me order the same thing another time with the order saved in their system. We decided on the later. Called in tonight just to realize they cannot offer to remake it because that deal wasn't present. I asked if I could order it online and apply the credit that they spoke of when I got to the store and they said no, and had to order over the phone. They also did not honor online deals.

3170421,2017-11-17,0,fp1AV66Uq9mo_9ZhZIIpcQ,"Never had an issue with a Pizza Hut before until the last order. It was a Sunday and presumably a busy one due to their special that day. We were taking advantage of their 50% any pizza special. Like usual we ordered 2 large stuff crust pizzas from online. They give us a pick up time which is usually on the ball or ready earlier. Pick up time was a little bit longer this time 20-30 minutes which is not a problem. We show up in 30 minutes to pick up the pizza and ended up waiting 30 minutes in the store for the pizzas! Another angry customer before us had waited 20 minutes and when he asked how much longer and was told another 20, he actually walked out on them. So we finally get the pizzas. Take them home and begin eating and the dough is hard and dry! Usually I have to dab the grease a little before eating but it was dry as cardboard. My husband was poking fun at the pizzas and comparing it to naan bread pizzas.  We called up this location to complain and the manager offered to either have the same order delivered or give us credit for the order. We opted for the credit as there were a lot of people in our party who had already eaten the pizzas we brought home and were full. The manager said he would save the 50% off deal so we could use thay again next time. That was great. Much appreciated.

Fast forward a few days and the credit hasn't shown up in my account online. We call back and speak with the manager and he says it is saved on the computer. It has to be used in store...ok...

Fast forward another few days and we call in and try to order pizzas again. We figure lets just repeat the same order, same deal. And here is what finally tipped me pver the edge to prompt a negative review on yelp. Different manager says we can't utilize the same deal of 50% off and states he has no idea what the other guy told us. Now we are stuck paying in store prices because we can't use this credit online. After a bit of debate they were willing to honor the online prices because of our ordeal. We ask about the $7.99 two topping large pizza deal that is online. They said they are not a participating location for that promotion. Um..yes they are?? I had my iPad right on front of me! We ended up paying extra for our order to just use up this credit and definitely never will use this location again even though it is the closet one to our house. They don't deserve our business.

I guess this location is kind of new because they deliver to my house. Well if you are willing to wait 90 minutes for a pizza that is.
