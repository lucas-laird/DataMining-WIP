This place has some of the best Chinese food around!!!!

The portions are HUGE and the food is great. 

One thing you can really tell that a different cook made the dish from time to time one really likes ginger and one not so much. Its an interesting twist to the same dish. If you like a subtle change to the flavor of your dishes then its not a big deal but if you like it to be the same all the time then be aware it might not happen.

Overall great selection and good value for the money and it does not take a long time to get your food even if you have it delivered.

Not sure why this place is still open or why people like it. It's absolutely disgusting!  I seriously question the standards of those who deem this place great or even good. It's far from either. 

Food quality poor, its like they use the worst cuts of beef around for Mongolian Beef & try to pass it off as something edible & pleasing when its clearly not. Fried rice is that of cardboard. Everything is soupy, greasy, and just not appealing at all. If you want MONGOLIAN BEEF SOUP,"" this is your place. 

Chop Stix is soo much better & up Bermuda at Silverado Ranch. 

Save your money, your stomach, and palate & avoid this place. I don't know about the other locations but this one could use a Kitchen Nightmares makeover.

Ordered the Orange Chicken and it should be called Soggy, Drenched Chicken Wanna-Be.  The meat (if you can even call it that) was a very low grade. Probably fake chicken from a can. Very chewy.  Then they try to cover up the non-chicken by saturating it in the sauce, which by the way, did not have any resemblance to an Orange Sauce either in look or taste.  Chow Mein noodles were even off, very greasy.  Not to mention, the service was horrible.  The girl who took our order was not friendly and acted as though taking our order was a burden rather than a pleasure.  If you want cheap Chinese, go to Panda Express.

But today I've waited over 80 minutes and the food was still not delivered but I have to take my friend to the airport so I left and I call in to cancel the reservation . On my way to the airport the delivery guy called while I was driving, and I explained to him that the order was canceled. Than he goes off about how it takes him more than 30 minutes to drive to my warehouse and that he will never deliver to us again. Which is fine with me because I don't think anybody thats hungry would want to order food and wait a hour and half before they eat. Again, I know exactly where the restaurant is, less than 10 minutes drive away from my warehouse. I only cancel the reservation because I have to take my friend to the airport.

I suppose my biggest complaint is that 3 times I have eaten here now and gotten sick all night from it.

The first time I figured that maybe it was just me, I have health issues and thought, well, sometimes food causes problems and sometimes the same food, the same restaurant even does not and I let it go.

The next time a friend of mine brought me some take out and I did not ask where from, she has pretty good taste in places and I was sick all night long--I did not find out actually from where the food came from till last night when I had them for what I thought was a 2nd try and once again, spent the night sitting on the throne of doom.

As someone who eats out both breakfast and dinner 3+ times a week, I have been to a lot of wonderful and not so wonderful restaurants and won't lie, I have had much better and will not take any more chances with this place again!

And for the record, I had Chinese food last week at Galanga Thai on Windmill and Las Vegas Blvd, delicious and did not get sick.    :o/",tbivfqTrnwTp7mSKSz1j0g,0,0,2,Lro7WsOjcfVxtDvmm68dDw

Even though I usually order to go, the staff is still very friendly. They have online ordering available so that's a bonus. And orders are usually prepared pretty fast, within 10 minutes. 

I've tried the Chicken Fried Rice and Pork Fried Rice ($5.95). They are average...I prefer the chicken. Both are a bit oily, but still good. The Chicken Wings (8 for $6.25) are better, but a bit pricey for what they are. They are delicious though! One order of fried rice and chicken wings should be plenty for two people, or for one dinner and a midnight snack.

TIP: There is plenty of lettuce/garnish/peppers that come with the wings, kind of like a mini salad. It's pretty flavorful and spicy, so I'd recommend saving it with the leftovers and add your own ramen or small bowl of rice. Good for a small snack!

I've lived in this area for nearly 20 years and the same spot has changed ownership/businesses several times (the other businesses weren't that great).

Aside from being fast, the food is really good and the portions really are large.  I've had the same item a few times and noticed that the flavor varies slightly.  Last time, my meal was a little heavy on the ginger.  Normally this would be a negative, but in this case it tells me that someone is using fresh ginger and actually adding it to the dish.  For how fast and cheap this place is, it's comforting to know that fresh ingredients are being used.

At around 5:30, I ordered dinner at another close-by Chinese restaurant (check out my reviews to see which one) and at 6pm, I was throwing my order out because it was revolting.  I hopped onto Yelp to write a review and then read some reviews for other Chinese joints.

That's how I found China A Go Go and I'm not disappointed!  I don't typically order honey walnut shrimp, but I did this once after it received many good reviews on Yelp.  I also ordered crab rangoon, my personal favorite at almost all Chinese places.  My order total was around $19, which I guess is the going rate around here...

Anyway, they gave me wonton chips while I waited. They were stale, but who cares?  I didn't come here for that.  Literally within ten minutes, I had both of my food items and they were pipping hot! The crab rangoon pops in your mouth and their sweet & sour sauce is pretty good.  The honey walnut shrimp is a large helping of medium- large sized shrimp that don't taste like they were previously frozen and they are pretty thick.  The sauce, although still not my favorite, isn't too sweet and has somewhat of a tang.  I would order both again and will definitely recommend them to friends.

Orange Chicken - Not bad. A lot more bread. Not very crispy.

When I moved here in November I was curious if I could find a Chinese food place that I loved as much as I did back in California. I am not big on a lot of Chinese food but I love chicken fried rice. This is usually how I rate a good Chinese place. I am a picky eater so I have always ordered mine with no vegetables, rice, chicken, and egg only.
China A Go Go is on my way home from work so I thought I would give them a try. I ordered on-line with the special instructions of no veggies and a pick up time of ASAP as I was leaving work in 5 minute and it is about a 5 minute drive away. I was leery of the online ordering but it worked just fine. I arrived at the place and my order was ready and best of all it was correct, No Veggies!!
The best part of all is it tasted exactly like the chicken fried rice I use to get at my favorite place in California. I am a fan of this place and I see a lot more orders in the future. The price was also reasonable.",eWanvjvMjR-a92JVGAX0BQ,1,1,5,PGhKCT8wLZtH8WJ7WIgjug

The food is pretty good, the same as most Chinese delivery places but you can't beat the prices here. The delivery charge is only $2 and a lunch combo with a drink and your choice of egg rolls or Rangoon is just under $8. I recommend general tso's or the house chicken, every time I order it's very good. The Orange chicken has been hit or miss... I'm not sure why. The portions are very big, they give enough for two separate meals.

It's not that I don't like it, that's not the case at all, by my manly physique it can go without say that there are very few things I dislike. I'm just not very adventurous in this avenue of dining. There are the things I like and I'm not very open to swaying away from them.

So here's what I've had from China a Go Go - Sweet N Sour Chicken, Lettuce Wraps, Fried Race, pork stuffed Won Tons, General Tsao Chicken, Egg Drop Soup, and Honey Walnut Shrimp. Well, now that I typed out that list I just realized that I might be more versed in Chinese dining than the above paragraph said. Whoops...All of the listed items are outstanding. The Honey Walnut Shrimp is absolutely amazing. The shrimp are ""UUUGE"" and the sauce is the perfect amount of sweet. The amount of food you get is amazing. The Lettuce Wraps appetizer is enough to feed 4 hungry hippos. Those two items are by far my favorites on the menu.

Here's the biggest thing, and not to stereotype, but I'm going to, I've found that service can sometimes be less than desirable at Chinese restaurants. This place puts the stereotype to rest. For a fast food-ish type restaurant they were very attentive when dining in. Provided refills. Checked on us numerous times. When ordering to go we asked how many crispy won tons you get on the side because we had 4 people eating, they decided to throw in free pork won tons ""to make sure everyone has enough food.""

Although the staff were friendly, the food was not as good as some other Chinese restaurants I've experienced in this town. 

I ordered egg rolls and the mongolian beef lunch special. First - the spring rolls. Now when I envision a delicious spring roll I see a delicate wrapper with shredded goodness on the inside. Light, flavorful. These were the opposite. The wrapper was SO thick, it felt like I was chewing on two of them, not just one. And the ""shredded veggies"" on the inside, were not shredded. They were chopped up and extremely thick, the veggies were hard as well, as though they hadn't been cooked well. It was too much to chew. The ""spicy mustard"" they gave to me was in a packet and was not hot AT ALL. It was like regular mustard. Yuck. 

The mongolian beef was good but again, the slices of beef were enormous! They were not bite sized. They were double and triple bite sized. Definitely do NOT order this on a date because you will look like a velociraptor tearing into his meal. There was a lot of flavor, but also - a LOT of grease. The fried rice that went along with the meal was dry and tasteless. I only ate a couple of bites.

So overall, if you're looking for a quick meal with big portions and friendly staff - you've got it. If you're looking for refined taste and normal portions - you might want to try elsewhere.

I was impressed with the wonderful lunch specials that they offer, so many choices. The prices are so very reasonable too. 

The restaurant offers decor that is festive in the rich Chinese culture. The servers speak English but their primary language is a Chinese dialect. The staff is very friendly and even with the language barrier they understand the guest enough to get the order correct. Plus the menu is in color and has pictures that you can point to what you want. My order was prompt and made correctly the first time. 

I had the lunch special offerings of Beef and Broccoli which was delicious. And for extra an extra healthy choice later  ordered the Steamed Veggies special too. I figure since I will not eat all of it, l will have something healthy to snack on later. Sure enough I did not eat it all. The helpings are fairly large too. The steamed veggies were just right.

It comes covered in sauce but do not be afraid; they've added the perfect amount of seasoning so it's not too salty at all. I also ordered the Singapore noodles today.

I drove by for lunch today and was happy to see the grand opening sign. I'm not sure if they have any actual grand opening specials, but I didn't care. I wanted to verify if my previous beef with broccoli experience was just a fluke or if it was for real. As expected, the dish is one of the lunch special choices available for $5.95.

I still don't know what it is about that beef with broccoli, but it was indeed damn flavorful! Next time, I have to make sure to get all rice instead of half rice and half chow mein. I need as much rice as possible in order to soak up all that delicious sauce. I may even need to get white rice instead of fried.

4655203,2012-02-04,0,QpOAv584eb-ecG4TLEm95g,"Wow! China Go Go does not splurge on their portions. I felt like I ate half a family dinner. Not a lunch special (served to 4 PM.).
  China Go Go features two price ranges for lunch specials. $5.95 and $6.25 for shrimp based entries. Personally, I prefer the pepper steak, shrimp chop suey, and shrimp with lobster sauce.
  This is the typical China Go Go experience. Upon ordering from the menu, you pay. If you are drinking a cola, you pick up a cup and serve your self at the cola fountain. The server will deliver your food and plastic utensils. If you are happy with your service, there is a tip jar at the counter.
  The lunch special started with noodles and duck sauce. I enjoy thick noodles.
  Then, they served me the soup of the day: egg drop soup. This has been the soup of the day at China Go Go everyday for the last three years. My taste buds would enjoy something different, such as won ton or hot and sour soup.
  Finally, they served my entree: shrimp chop suey with fried rice and chow mien. The portion could feed two people. The shrimps were giant. No scrimping on quality here. With all the broccoli and mushrooms, I felt like I was eating healthy, instead of pigging out. The fried rice was your average fried rice. I am not crazy over the chow mien. It's like filler on what would be a great album. In all honesty, I prefer Panda Express's Chow Mien.
  As I said, China Go Go gives a lot for a lunch special. However, large portions do not guarantee a five star review. I would be a fan if they change their soup of the day or add won ton soup at a reasonable charge, and improve their chow mien, which is served with the meal. I give China Go Go 3 1/2 stars, which is good.
 Return factor: high. I appreciated the customer service. If the customer service is great on my next visit, I'll most likely become a fan and up my rating to 4 stars on an updated review.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,0,1,3,2bTsDb7CsTSARUXmaMZ-yw

However, I had a horrible Chinese food craving after a weekend of too much alcohol and needed some grease to balance me out.  Since this is just down the street from my house, I decided to give a try and get delivery.

First off, you can place your order right online. It's really convenient and easy.  Everyone knows how hard it is to order Chinese food on the phone sometimes because you can't understand each other!  I ordered pot-stickers $5.95, pork fried rice $5.95 and combination kung pao chicken $8.95.  The prices were SO REASONABLE!  My order was $24 with tax and delivery fee.  But I noticed that they have these family meal combos where you get soup, an appetizer, fried rice, white rice and 1 or 2 entrees for a set price that was under $25, or a personal combo package for $9.95.  

The delivery took about 40 min, which is typical.  The best part is that the food is FREAKIN' AMAZE balls!  It's some of the best Chinese I've had in Vegas.  The ONLY thing that made me give this 4 stars were the pot stickers.  They were huge and the insides were yummy, but they were slightly undercooked so that the top part dough tasted not completely done.  If they had just been cooked more evenly, these would have been amazing.  As they were, I had to pick off all the dough and just eat the outside and the bottoms.

I ordered the egg rolls, chicken and broccoli and beef and broccoli. I ordered both chicken and beef so I could compare the two proteins and must say I find the beef to be tastier! The egg rolls were more like spring rolls to me..they are small with a delicate, flaky crust...not like the big NY egg rolls I am used to with a thick crust. 

  I liked how the rice is portioned in containers that are the same size as the entrees; there is nothing worse than getting a carton full of rice that is the size of my pinky. Also, they marked the rice cartons with a little black dash so I don't have to play a guessing game when I go to the refrigerator for left overs...which will happen...many times. The entrees are $9.55 each and are easily three portions! 

   The only downside was that the onions were a little too undercooked for my liking. I like my onions to be cooked until they are soft...not with a crunch and that pungent raw-onion taste.",Ru3XlA1NeRAYgtE0KUK7tg,0,0,4,8Ci-GfVYXwyby9ubQ6eoWg

I came with my husband during his lunch break because I was craving cheap Chinese lunch specials and this location was the closest. We went in and the waitress was kind and told us to sit down anywhere. I was quite impressed that they had booths and looked like a cute little restaurant since most other china a go go's look like only take out locations. There was only one other table but within, no joke, about 10 minutes, the place got packed!
They bring you crispy wontons with sweet and sour sauce, and egg drop soup (only for dine in) as you wait for drinks. I ordered the Mongolian beef lunch special for about $6, expecting something small and greasy, assuming you get what you paid for.
It comes out in to go boxes and that box was FILLED! My husband and I looked at each other in shock at how much food they give. We could already tell that we weren't gonna be able to finish it. It comes with both chow mein and fried rice and the food was piping hot/fresh.

Orange chicken is orange chicken (for me, the best take out Orange chicken comes from Panda Express). General Tsao's chicken was yummy too!

I've ordered taro boba from here before too--and it's just as good as the places in china town.",1z01NwSTBMUae8Fjw2rQog,0,1,3,IxPqcxZC6e3PchMuhBMRuA

They taste like cream cheese rangoons, which i love, but they are the best ones I have found.  We have tried a lot of items on the menu as well as ordered when relatives came and everyone loved their food.

I love their Thai boba tea and garlic shrimp with a crab wonton appetizer! It is so amazing! They really take care of their regulars too. I would eat here everyday if it were possible.

Came on time nice guy. Food was hot lightly packaged old school style in the cool little box . no bulky foam box with dripping plastic bag around it.( thank god) Got veggie chow- mein. Very good! no mystery slime sauce all over it for flavor, just good noodles and a garlicy scent. So good i actually thought i was eating chicken lol.. but i wasnt.

Really like the little container of ORANGE sauce. Refreshing flavor.",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,1,0,4,hyOMBt5i-nxj_vyLcwnoaw

Beef Broccoli is always yummy don't care for the noodle that they make. it is a little thicker than your chow mein noodles, and smaller than your upon noodles. 
Boba drinks are alway bit with me, all the flavors are good with or with 9ut the Boba in it...",LnX7-WmpML5bY6Fzlz468g,0,0,4,je6HEu_h3BTm7F_PRg4Ftw

I came here for lunch with a coworker. We ordered some pot stickers and the eggplant and tofu entree. Our food came with egg drop soup. The portions were enormous. The two of us were able to share the entree and still had about half left to take home as leftovers. The food was prepared quickly and was extremely fresh for a fast food type of restaurant. The prices are also fantastic. 

I'll definitely be frequenting this location for lunch more often!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,4,3,4,qHWDwf05NYQUid36ZHjXZg

Ordered delivery through Grubhub. Our order arrived early, and we were extremely pleased to find that the restaurant was able to cater to all of our special requests (ie no tofu in the eggplant, no veggies in the chow mein).

All of the food we ordered was delicious. The flavors were all correct and well balanced. My eggplant was cooked perfectly, and I loved the addition of thinly sliced jalapeños that gave it just a little kick. The orange chicken was mild and sweet, perfect for our youngest child. The paper chicken was tender and flavorful.

Also, the kids meals are a terrific value. Huge portion that made 2 meals for my kid.

Can't wait to order again! :)",cHr4S_PSpAWpLi8CWtLzrA,0,0,5,dWa7X-OFfy3k09S92M6fZQ
