I want this place to be good, because of the set up and the food, but it cannot be, because of the service, the prices and the crowd (there was a junkie, rolling around on the floor and pool table, but never removed).

On this stop in, our group gathered for some birthday drinks. When I arrived, they said that the server had been slow and it would be best to go to the bar for my first beer. Well, that didn't help...

Both bartenders walk past me, looked at me, but never acknowledged that I may want something.

When one finally came over, she said ""what do you want?"" I asked if they had OKTOBERFEST and she said no, than yes, than I don't know, then very sarcastically ""agreed"" to get my drink. The male bartender then came over and snatched the money from my hand. I had to speak up. I snatched it back and he said ""don't you want quarters for the pool table?"" I said ""no"" and turned away from him.

The female came back and simply said ""$6.00""... I didn't say anything back, just gave her the money, left no tip and walked away.

Later, the server coming around took an order of 3 beers and 2 cocktails. She brought them back over the course of 3 trips... and charged me $4.50 for the same beer. Yes, it is only $1.50, but considering I would typically drink about a dozen beers, this was in indicator to order nothing further. 

Everyone was aggravated and with less than an hour in, we paid up and moved the gathering elsewhere... and had a great time... and spent well over $250 gambling, drinking and ordering food... Apparently the Lodge did not want that money.",rdysF0ymVkMX82Bu_8x3nA,6,2,1,R9cBRzRs3eOcYH61lYRhDw

Wasn't too busy when we went, so it provided a nice atmosphere to kick back with the friends, play some pool, and have good conversations. The other patrons who were there were friendly enough, and were more than willing to converse with anyone.

As far as the bartenders go, they were great. Provided great service and were very personable. Drinks were reasonably priced. About the same prices you would get at any local bar.

As are most bars in Vegas you walk in and feel the plume of second hand tobacco smack you almost on your ass. But that is normal and essential to our economy in town, people drink, smoke, eat and be merry!

Me and wifey ordered our drinks (she looks vodka and sodas I like beer) our drinks were brought promptly. It was a changeover in staff so bar maids were counting down the register, what I did not like is how they gravitated to the oldest guy there, big spender? I dunno but service did suffer lightly and customer drinks and ashtrays started diminish and stack with no question. 

Nevertheless I got my beer when I wanted it. Music was 90's alternative which is cool but gets old after a while. I can only listen for so long. Prices were ok although I wonder when happy hour is as they didn't advertise it tell us. Was it happy hour?

Once acclimated I saw there was a large circular center bar complete with video gambling machines, extra lounge seating around the perimeter, pool tables to the right, and a wall of about four TVs overlooking about 8 small round tables. The interior really has a nice lodge feel with the woodwork implemented and the Big Buck Hunter video games towards the back.

50 cent Wing Wednesdays are where it's at here at the Durango Lodge. Sauce choices range from mild and hot to teriyaki and hotyaki and come with all the wing fixings such as ranch, blue cheese, carrots, and celery. The wings aren't the best I've had, but they're not bad at all especially for the price. If you're looking for somewhat more healthful option, the avocado chicken burger is a primo choice, subbing a salad for fries. I have also had the buffalo chicken wrap which I thought was very good, along with their penne with alfredo sauce, Italian sausage, and garlic bread.

While everyone else was drinking, I just ordered the country fried chicken smothered in gravy which came with potatoes and salad on the side.  It was alright, nothing great because it's the brown gravy that I crave but instead they poured white gravy on it so the taste just didn't do it for me.

My wife & I couldn't believe what we were hearing. People in this place are actually dealing & using cocaine throughout this bar! Its crazy! The owners really need to re-think who they employ here because this place is a dump! Metro police needs to investigate this bar. It's a shame my wife and I had to experience our 1st time in this bar like this but now you know. Good thing is my wife has connections on the political side so she will be letting her colleagues know about this bar and to NOT go in here and let people know what's really goin on in this bar!",HP9uq8QA61P8fm40lwHcQA,2,0,1,lH6gJO_fDNQvzBCTQZ703g

My date paid for them, but I believe that's what the bartender said.  Will definitely return here when I'm in a billiards mood!",Y76nS3L426UCz7N_1pUfUQ,0,0,4,QxhpYMKCGIXToMK2g8vOJQ

They have pretty decent (but kind of expensive) food.  Honestly, if you really want to eat, there's a Roberto's, and a Villa Pizza in the same lot.
There's a lot of seating room around the bar, at some tables off to the side, and also by the pool tables.  
One thing I really like is that when you sit at the tables, the waitresses are really good about coming by, and bringing more drinks.  It's pretty quiet too, so it's a great place if you want to have a drink, and talk.",vKbRbgAEYDCdl-xjPIWLfQ,2,1,3,ejKeIEncx2VvDkWLI-JscQ

The reason they got only 4 was the variety of beers - not so much a collectors place /: but all in all I like coming here",8ePvT-ZzcTqGYO7Qkpt-jA,0,0,4,_Qymd3sK-mmjU8cyZi45WQ

I had driven past this place a gazillion times, but had never stopped in so we gave it a try. You really get the ""lodge"" feel when you walk in, lots of warm colors, wood and stone.

Had a great time, servers/bartenders were really nice and went out of their way to provide great service, crowd was mixed, old-young. I had heard on the weekend it sometimes could be a younger crowd, but that wasn't the case, we were only there from about 8-9:30pm.

Will definetly go back. . .",FOFKuCoclgR0zAlVe7i1Zg,1,0,4,mWAsjlh5pFrXbFcCre75_g

The bartender Jordan is great and its more because of him that I and my husband choose to go there. The ambiance is nice, nothing spectacular and everyone there are pretty friendly. I go to gamble but there are usually people playing pool too. Great place as a neighborhood bar.",reLrRzRvCUzoVPaSo5fCzA,1,0,5,iBBpX_HMZhPwz6JDLNmhww
