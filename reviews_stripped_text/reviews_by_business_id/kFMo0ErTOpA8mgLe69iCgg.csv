1568468,2016-10-24,0,kFMo0ErTOpA8mgLe69iCgg,What can be better than to attend a convention and be able to have Nathan's hot dog and fries. I look forward to the convention knowing I will have Nathan's for lunch. They hands down have the best fries and with cheese sauce it doesn't get any better. I think they need to spend more time training their staff and familiarizing them with their menu,JfRIu7c4akoBf3DLnvWgIA,0,0,4,BHSlkuW4C4kF1VbV-wt92g

You're better off spending your money on the hot dogs here. Those are actually pretty good here .",gqa4neXrgtxFCpoefA7FtA,0,0,2,Rf_lLVzwtI2se-X72u9ksA

We visited the Las Vegas Convention Center 3 days in a row to watch my nephew's basketball tournament.  During that time, Nathan's was the only place open inside there.  Suffice it to say that they were very busy those 3 days.

Their hot dogs, french fries, and lemonade are okay.  Prices are a bit steep, but that is to expected inside the Convention center.

Overall, not a bad place to eat when you are here.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,4,4,3,zlEiCyNJiwjj_mEzUanNbg
