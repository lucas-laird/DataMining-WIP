I didn't even know people could go to Lou Ruvo if they didn't have business there, so it was a great excuse to check the place out. They have a nice outdoor garden where you can wander and see the sculptures after you finish your lunch. I had the grilled cheese. Very tasty.",A_n8VaF8cv8-eBNz84no7w,1,0,5,o8h0n0AEkiEyezkNOFX_hQ

I had the Albacore Tuna Salad on toasted Sourdough with watermelon juice and he had the Smoked Turkey & Swiss on Talera with watermelon juice.  The talera bread reminded me of ciabatta bread; and I wanted to try their gluten-free bread; but, they were out.

Fresh ingredients, thoughtful architecture - check it out.",amvZ9tmLWraWoML6K4Xiuw,3,1,3,iTVWM6R1nTcxl9pwmCo7Xg

Its centrally located and where else in Vegas can you dine  in a unique courtyard designed by the Famous Architect Frank Gehry?! The over head steel canopy  provides shade and aesthetic interest while enjoying your favorite menu item... The watermelon juice is one of my favorite items to order along with the veggie sandwich.

The staff was so nice and food was satisfying and fresh. It only has outdoor seating, so be mindful of the weather. It is shaded, so we enjoyed the outdoor dining. We tried the smoked turkey and swiss sandwich, caesar salad and tuna sandwich with a sunrise smoothie. Only bummer was that they were out of the first 2 things I tried to order.
