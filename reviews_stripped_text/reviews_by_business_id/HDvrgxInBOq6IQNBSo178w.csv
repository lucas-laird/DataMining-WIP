Rice Trax's portions SHRANK. It wasn't enjoyable anymore. I miss the ambiance of the smaller restaurant. It was more inviting and felt like a mom and pop store. Rice Trax has lost it's uniqueness. Rice Trax has turned into every other local Hawaiian place like L&L, Ohana Hawaiian BBQ and Island Sushi. I don't think we'll return any time soon.

589701,2014-04-21,1,HDvrgxInBOq6IQNBSo178w,"I have mixed feelings about this place. On one hand, they relatively inexpensive bentos considering they have huge portions that are easily customizable. (Can't beat an average of $10 per bento!) On the other hand, I always eat more that I should here and because the food is so heavy I end up regretting it in the end. They have preset combinations but I always make my own. You can do a 2 item or 3 item combo and each comes with your selection of rice, your chosen entrees, Mac salad, and 2 sauces. The garlic chicken, mochiko chicken and furikake shrimp are stand outs in the menu. You can choose their house fried rice, white rice, brown rice, or make your own. The kimchi friend rice is one of their offerings and it had a pretty good flavor but it's way too oily/greasy.

1400177,2013-09-04,1,HDvrgxInBOq6IQNBSo178w,"What a yummy find!

You can create your own bento or choose from their pre-made choices. I opted for Mochiko Bento & the bf chose Furikake Bento. 

Let me start off by saying, oh my goodness, the portions are ridiculous! They are so generous! No, really. Like I could share a bento with someone and we would both still be super full. 

Anyway, you can choose white, brown or fried rice. Fried rice has an upcharge of like $1.25 or something. Kinda pricey, I know, but I wanted to try it. They ask what veggies  & I just chose peas, carrots and corn.  It was tasty. Not the best fried rice but I liked it. It needed more flavor though. Like somekindof seasoning. Maybe garlic salt? I like egg on my fried rice too so that's another negative thing.

Mochiko chicken was more on the salty side & I usually have mochiko more on the sweet side. I liked the chicken katsu on the stick. Dipped it in the Teri sauce and sweet chili and aioli sauces (all free btw, just ask); they were all good condiments! Teriyaki steak was tender and not chewy. Boyfriend loved his bento too. He finished all his shrimp and Mac salad! I did not even touch the house salad. I just wasn't a fan of it at all.

All in all, portions were definitely very generous, food was tasty but watch out, price can rack up if you add extra things.",Nbr4DYLPxURjxelLVTSt8A,4,2,4,aPZeMqrdWX7veTQCVrwivg

A bento is ~$10 depending on what you get. But you do get your money's worth because the portions size is pretty large and the bento combos come with plenty of food. It's just that I'd rather pay less for less food than more money for food that may not get finished. But that's just me.

Anyways, I got the Mochiko bento which came with Mochiko chicken, salad, rice, shrimp tempura, chicken katsu, and beef skewers. Like I said, it's plenty of food that also tastes good. I particularly liked the chicken Katsu. There was something about the flaky breading that made it taste better. Their rice comes with furikake which was nice too.

Never really ran into that problem at their old location so maybe they're adjusting to the new location/demand and running out??  

I won't be back for a while, probably call to ask if they've run out of pork before I do. Seems like a weird thing to have to do at a place known for their fried rice.

Instead of going with the make your own went with one of Bento combinations on the menu. I got the Furikake Bento. Updated review let me add bringing back the Furikake not that I don't get enough at home. It kind of like Spam if your local from da islands you know certain things that go with rice. Furikake is one of them!!! The Furikake Shrimp was awesome! It basically shrimp tempura with nice light panko breading style not greasy or heavy. They toss it with the Furikake seasoning. The shrimp is nice most and hot on the inside. It first time ordered the Furikake Shrimp definitely not my last time! They were so addicting could have whole Bento of it. =)) Two other entree was the teriyaki chicken and the teriyaki beef. I had both before and still right on point. I enjoy the fact that everything comes on screws. It makes easy too eat, not so messy, and leaves more room for rice. Forget too mention Furikake on rice. Seriously can never have enough of the good things in life. The house salad (instead of mac salad) really enjoy. The greens are nice fresh, crispy, and like the house dressing comes on top of it. Plus they don't drown the salad with the dressing. Whatever the dipping sauce they give you with the Furikake Shrimp is da bomb. 

In the need for Bento at reasonable price really no other spot would go in town. Looking forward too my next Bento!!!!",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,1,2,4,Qs0bpUpjNndgVt2neQlWHQ
2416625,2013-10-03,1,HDvrgxInBOq6IQNBSo178w,"I've always been a big fan of Rice Trax but almost forgot about going there because of where they were previously located. I'm excited that they moved, a block closer to me and a lot easier to get to for everyone else. I'm loving the new digs a lot more, near businesses like Oyshi and Soyo on Rainbow and Robindale.

Vegas has a few decent bento places but nothing else really like Rice Trax. They raised their prices about $0.50 more from what I remembered. The bentos are now about $10 with big portions and lots of taste. My favorite is the Furikake Bento probably because it came with furikake shrimp, pieces of golden fried shrimp with furikake a mixture of sesame seeds and seaweed.  It also comes with their house salad which is their tastiest item, teriyaki beef and chicken, rice, and a delicious dipping sauce.

Most recently, basically today, I had the Mochiko Bento.  It came with mochiko chicken, its a lot like popcorn chicken but using mochiko flour, kind of oily and gummy I didn't like it a lot. It also came with large pieces of chicken katsu, a couple pieces of shrimp tempura, skewered teriyaki beef, rice, and more of that tasty house salad. It was a lot of fried oily food but good tasting food.

You can also create your own 3 items and 2 items bentos from any of the items they have listed and create your own fried rice by choosing items from their fried rice bar.

Their food look good and taste good but watch out for their wooden skewers in some of their items, they don't taste so well.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,2,2,4,dmoa3yhC0Fn3afMfj9Hv1g

From ordering to finish, it was 45 minutes.  Granted, it was a busy dinner hour.  It just sucks when you are hungry and waiting.....

I always have kimChi in my fried rice, always.  At this new location, it seems like the fried rice got sweeter.  I'm not fond of too much sweet teriyaki-ish flavor, especially in my rice.  The garlic chicken is the bomb and my favorite here.

I, for one, love this location because 1) it allowed Tonkatsu Kiyoshi to move in to it's old spot 2) there's a lot more space and seating for when you're waiting on your order. For the first few weeks of the grand opening, I think they were still getting adjusted to the new location and orders were overwhelming them. However, I think now they have adjusted and are able to serve customers quickly again. I'm a big fan of their House Fried Rice, with added egg and corn. I usually order 3 items, which I never finish, but I figured this place is all about the reliable leftovers. For the sake of my health, I don't frequent this place too much, but it's a nice place to go to when I feel the world is just a little bit too stressful and I just want some Hawaiian comfort food. I'm not sure if they've done so already, but I think it would help if they took orders on an electronic system, versus writing every thing down by hand.

The idea of mixing and matching is really the only excuse to give this place one star(besides the fact 0 isn't an option lol)

From the time it took me to place my order and then to check on it, my lunch break was already over. And the food wasn't even ready for take out. 

Thankfully they gave me a full refund, but there's no need to take 25 minutes for one order. 

It must be good if the girl at el pollo loco told me to try it. She told me to call ahead to save myself the wait. Hopefully we can try this out again in a few months!",7L8utEpYiVj3pNNjZkQaLQ,0,0,1,ul8cie5OtgrsNQPwslF56g

5091792,2013-08-26,1,HDvrgxInBOq6IQNBSo178w,"Discovered this place through my friend's IG (thanks Mae!). This place is 4 stars just for the ease of ordering, decent variety, flavor, portion size (large- very Hawaiian) and flavor. I particularly like the Mochiko chicken. Fried rice seems to always come sautéed in some kind of soy-based sauce. Very Hawaiian in flavor and focus. Decent options in fountain drinks including 4 types of iced tea. All in all for prices hovering around $9.50-$12 it's a filling, somewhat fast option for a working lunch. I had to take off stars for 1) very limited seating, 2) no POS system (waiting in line to order is common since they WRITE DOWN all the orders!). Everything btw comes in a styrofoam takeout container- even done in orders, lol. Other than that, decent place to grab a simple filling Hawaiian plate-style lunch.",lFcmHJTpCXLY_RtMQHS1BQ,2,2,3,P5haqO5UnXHN3EH8QZ6rgw

Very sad that they closed their doors.  The food was very good",Ahdo2T-uQ-qO-6FM88M4mg,0,0,5,Rz0qhnknsx2Tn6BDkzMThA

I've been living in the vicinity for years and finally got my butt to Rice Trax.
I was disappointed in the girl that waited on me (I think she may have been new). There was no line so I let her know it was my first time in and was a bit overwhelmed with the menu. She didn't bat an eye or offer any advice, so I chose to build my own bento with Chicken Katsu (on a stick), Shrimp Tempura, and Shrimp Furikake. I had no idea what Furikake was and I asked the girl, her response was, ""it has seasoning on it, it's good"". Not very helpful, I verified that it wasn't spicy and put in my order. I noticed after the fact they have Mac salad, so I ordered a side. I now know you can substitute it in place for their salad for an up charge. (No thanks to counter girl).  She never mentioned I could get fried rice or did I want any certain sauces. I know for next time though. 
Who I am guessing was the manager was very nice and efficient, I wish she would've waited on me! I got my food quickly. I liked all of my food. There was one sauce they gave me, I didn't care for. The portion of rice was huge!  Price is maybe a tad high but it was fresh, not greasy, and tasty. I will definitely go back, an probably soon!",DoRCeCcJbrsM2BiAKj3trA,1,0,4,6It-gq_aQdrF1KXvcsxmMw
5426643,2013-10-06,0,HDvrgxInBOq6IQNBSo178w,"Wait time was ok not as bad as other reviews. We got 2 plates and waited maybe under 10 min (but no one else was in there). Cost was just under $20 for a 3 and 2 choice. Food was pretty tasty as I remember. Serving size was also pretty good! On the 3 choice my 3rd item was spam (for my son), and they gave 3 slices. There was a slight smell in the restaurant that wasn't appealing but it subsided after a few minutes and the bathroom has no soap!!! Yuck.....so that's why the reduction of 2 stars. You guys gotta keep up with at least providing soap....tsk tsk. Other than that it was good but room for improvement. I'd like to see a low carb option....like a shrimp salad or something. If you do have it, it isn't on the menu....",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,0,0,3,AheSL2WESzOIciWqQt-99A
5588932,2013-10-01,0,HDvrgxInBOq6IQNBSo178w,"Finally this place is open again! I missed them when their Jones location closed down.

First, I have to say, they have some of the best macaroni salad I've ever had, ever, anywhere, period. It tastes extra delicious with a dash of siriacha sauce. I could order a side and finish it all to myself. 

Their kimchi fried rice is my favorite. At their new location, they don't list all the different types of rice anymore, so if you don't see it listed, definitely ask for it anyway.

All their meats are crispy and come in large portions. Perfectly cooked, tender, and tasty. 

Overall, it's a great place to catch a quick bite that is 100% better than the average fast food. Oh, but come during a less busy hour, because food here always takes awhile to get to you.",n28qz1Lt9ROormO7eCooOg,0,0,3,RepNwz7Am3ypOwyQiOGk4g
5669010,2013-08-25,0,HDvrgxInBOq6IQNBSo178w,I was disappointed with Rice Trax. We went last week after waiting for it to finally open. The fried rice was way too oily and I couldn't even eat it. My beef was very dry. The macaroni salad is very good though. We ordered the tempera and it was $150 for 3 coin size prices of carrots. It was not absolutely horrible but I wouldn't rush to go back.,ogMyBjaHN4ogC-Sv_pF99Q,1,0,3,3iy-lMcfThcZ2RsOkcMe3Q

Ever since they moved to the new location I didn't go there as much. And now I no longer live in lv. Nevertheless I'm shocked it's gone. 

You don't miss your water till your well runs dry.
