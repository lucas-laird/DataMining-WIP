Well since then, I've been contacted by the GM and Corporate and I'm pleased they'll be handling the problems that may have been bringing the service down. Also, I'm pleased to inform everyone that they have now brought back some of the old favorites and can't wait to eat them!!! As for the GM Brandon, he should be the one to thank that I've decided to edit my post because that shows a lot of character and leadership to make the necessary changes in order to keep customers happy!

It's hard describe exactly what the problem is, but it seems to come down to the offerings --- they're always a little too offbeat (exotic?) to be satisfying --- I would like to see more chicken, fish, and beef selections, and more traditional vegetables.  Also, the salad dressings are too acerbic (why no Ranch or Blue Cheese dressing?), and they could have a greater variety of salads.",wp3ZAA_bBNGjSmwH-F12dQ,0,0,3,dAX1wLLo_MsCV1M3cL4f6w

192246,2016-02-17,0,gHoP4eJimaMltfUlp6EP4Q,"We were in a few months back, in the bar area. The bartender Cher I believe was working. She said she wasn't the usual bartender, she was filling in. I don't know why she wouldn't be their regular bartender. She was fantastic. The bar got pretty busy as a large party came in and she still gave us stellar service while tending to everyone else.

The food here is always amazing. Everything is great. Never had a dish we didn't like. We have been into this location before and the other one before moving to it's new GV location. Taylor usually takes care of us when we are in this location (Sahara) and he is an outstanding bertender. Honestly we come back because of him....and the delicious food. But we really enjoyed meeting Cher and will probably dine in the restaurant next time so she can be our server. 

I hear their late night happy hour is a great deal. Nearly all the appetizers are half price! And the apps are pretty much al we order from. Big selection. Duck tacos, hummus, coconut shrimp, lobster bisque, etc. The pizzas are great too. Really like the options they have for gluten free and vegans. Open 24 hours with the full menu available.

203725,2013-11-14,0,gHoP4eJimaMltfUlp6EP4Q,"They would've gotten 5-stars, but because they gave me the regular pizza crust when I asked for the gluten free crust, and I didn't notice until I already consumed a bite, that's a big red flag for me.

1.  I asked for gluten free crust.
2. They delivered my pizza to me at my table.  I took a bite and immediately knew the texture was wrong.

HOWEVER, they handled it PERFECTLY!

First, they made sure I wasn't in imminent danger.  I'm not ALLERGIC, I'm intolerant...my stomach feels sick later, but I can still breathe and don't need an ER.  So, they did the right thing there.

Then, waiter accepted FULL responsibility.  They remade my pizza and they remade a fresh dish for my friend as well so that she didn't have to choose between eating without me or waiting and letting her dish get cold.  Good move!

Waiter was absolutely amazingly friendly and made our happy hour beverages himself (he used to be a bartender...my Mai Tai was DELICIOUS!)

They remade my pizza, with a gluten free crust, and they didn't charge me for it without me asking for them to take it off!

Basically, they messed up, but they made up for it in a big way, and I'm sure they learned a valuable lesson. I'm glad this happened to me and not someone who is deathly allergic to wheat, because that would've been a horrible experience for everyone involved.  I'm hoping the staff learned to be more attentive to dietary restrictions.

NOTE TO ALLERGY SUFFERERS:  Make sure you DOUBLE CHECK your order once you receive it and ask to speak with a manager.  This is true anywhere you go.",TnhTyk1qfJ8jL2bHpeTrhQ,5,0,3,d6bNs51ApQPdPeI-7owB0g

355363,2014-07-07,2,gHoP4eJimaMltfUlp6EP4Q,"My husband and I went here on a weekday for lunch. 
We were seated promptly. There was no wait.
The dining room was three quarters empty.
It has little decor and ambiance. Very plain. Nothing special to speak of.
There's a mix of tables and booths, and bar seating.
 
Our server, Alexandra B., came to the table fairly quickly. She asked if we'd like drinks. Husband ordered water. and I asked for water, a glass of Leaping Horse chardonnay, and a side of ice. My wine was $6.50 a glass and was very good. Full flavored and very drinkable. Alexandra forgot to bring my side of ice. I had to ask her for it again.

 We were expecting that a place that has ""pizza"" in their name would have a bigger array of pizza and do pizza well. We had visions of sharing a big ""Supreme"" pizza and taking some home. Not possible at Sammy's. They only have individual pizzas. So with our dreams of sharing a Supreme pizza and having great leftovers for the next day squashed, my husband ordered an ""Italian"" personal pizza which had pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms on it. You get one big piece of pepperoni on each ""slice"" of pizza. The mushrooms were very sparse. Hubby said it needed more of them. He said the pizza was ""fair"".

I ordered the Chinese Chicken Salad. It looked beautiful. I was happy, seeing this bright, beautiful salad with its array of vegetables including the surprise of green bell pepper, which you don't often see in this type of salad. 
However, with my first bite, I was disappointed. The dressing that was tossed throughout the salad was bland, boring, and didn't have enough Asian flavors.
One of the great things about this salad, if done right, is the tangy, full-of-flavor Asian dressing on it. Flavors of soy and ginger are usually in the forefront.
Not so with this one. It tasted like oil and vinegar and not much else. I think I detected a hint of soy and less so, ginger, but I'm not sure.
I had to look hard to find the chicken. there were a few unevenly sized pieces throughout, some of them a little too charred, with black areas covering a big part of a few pieces. The chicken was also dry. I ate four or five bites and just couldn't eat anymore. It was pretty tasteless.

We ordered dessert. Hubby decided on the Messy Sundae. Our server said it was ""big enough for four people"". He decided to try it anyway. The sundae was pretty ""monster"". It was big but would it feed four? Depending upon how much lunch you ate, and what your appetite is like, it might. I'd describe it as ""feeds 1-4"".
It came served in a tall glass goblet  and was filled with vanilla ice cream, and had chocolate sauce not only all over the ice cream but on the saucer that the goblet was on. It was topped with walnuts and a large amount of whipped cream. There were more walnuts in the chocolate sauce on the plate. Hubby really enjoyed the sundae.
I decided to try the Caramel Pudding since I love caramel. It was served in a small wine glass and the pudding filled the glass halfway. It was topped with a small amount of whipped cream. The pudding was creamy and rich and full of caramel flavor. The only thing that would've improved it was if there had been more of it! I really enjoyed it.

Alexandra was cheerful, efficient, and checked back on us a couple of times.  

To sum up, we were not impressed with our entrees at all. We know of several other places that do pizza, and Chinese Chicken Salad, much better than this. Sammy's is a 20 min drive from home. We wouldn't come back here again unless we happened to be in the neighborhood already, and then we would stop in for just dessert and a glass of chardonnay. :)",MTf7fYn4f777fUwFrNZvmg,0,0,2,3wUxqVieL0g8ngQSKiLH0A

The bartender was very friendly and the pours of wine were generous.  It is a little dark inside but that is expected for a bar/lounge.  There were just a few people in the bar so the noise level was quiet which was great.  A couple people were gambling but the machine volume was turned way down so that was also pleasant.  Right when we ordered our last drink, a group of people came into the bar and one or more of them was smoking.  Not cool.

The waiter was fabulous, very friendly and attentive. But the pizza was inedible. The gluten-free crusts are apparently frozen, but they were not cooked completely through, and had a really off putting taste. The sauce on a pineapple pizza had no flavor, and a margarita pizza was even worse. 

Have had great gluten-free pizzas in other cities, and even much better ones from my own freezer at home. If not for the friendly waiter we probably would have just left the restaurant.

All of the restaurants have the same menu, but over the past three years of eating at four Sammy's in Vegas, this one has become my favorite for lunch, while the Rainbow location remains my happy hour spot.

Mojca, Albert, Sam, and Tia all do a  terrific job, even at the busiest times.  The guys in the kitchen turn out consistently fresh and impressive entrees; particularly the salads.  Christina runs a tight shop and it shows up in the great food and service.

I love Sammy's! The food today was perfect and exactly as expected. This review is aimed to the poor service we received.

I am in town to visit with my mother whom I rarely get a chance to see. We came here to relax and have a nice late lunch and chat. We came in around 2 and the floor was empty. It was a perfect setting to visit and chat. 

My issue is with the pressure we received from the waitress. Her name is Alexandra. She was in such a rush to push us in and out. She was very rude. As soon as we got food she seemed to be rushing to clear our table. As soon as she could she was offering us to go boxes and trying to take our empty plates. She was in such a rush for us to hand her plates that a water glass got knocked over. I asked for some more tea with an agenda to finish our visit and she pushed us to take it in plastic to go cups. After she brought us tea in plastic cups she ignored us completely. I had to yell out to her for attention to get a little more tea. 

In total we were only sitting in the restaurant for under an hour of time. Our bill was nearly $100 and we were treated like we had no value. I see no reason to feel so pressured and rushed to leave. This really spoiled my visit with my mother and I can't believe the disrespect during such a slow time on the restaurant floor.

To start, there was no host or hostess around, for a while.  It took forever to even get water, and we were seated outside when it was warm out, so the wait seemed even worse.  It wasn't busy inside, so I'm not quite sure what the hold up was.  Our waiter was friendly, but he seemed to disappear for long stretches, and when our food finally came and we had problems with our orders, he was no where to be found, so another server handled the problems.
As far as the food, the lebni was great as always.  We tried the new White Tuna and Spinach salad, it was very good.  I wanted to try something other than my usual entree, but I couldn't decide what to order.  The waiter recommended the Organic Arugala and Pear Pizza.  I instead ordered the new Diavola Pizza, wanting to try something different.  What a mistake.  It was horrible.  Slabs of hard salami on spinach, with gouda and peppers.  Just too much of a mish mash of tastes for me.  My boyfriend tried the new Sicilian Pizza, and hated it almost just as much.  They replaced our pizza's with a 5 Cheese and a Mozzerella Pizza at no charge, but at that point both of us had lost our appetite.

We ended up getting two pizzas and an appetizer. 

The app was a Mediterranean Dip Trio. It included Hummus, baba ghanoush, and Lebni cheese. My favourite out of the three was the baba ghanoush. The hummus was also good, but the Lebni cheese just tasted like a really lemony sour cream. Of course, this was my first time having Lebni cheese, so I can't compare it to others elsewhere. I'm not saying it was bad, just not as good as the others on the trio platter. 

The two pizzas we got were the Goat cheese pizza and the Burrata and Pesto pizza. Both were good. My boyfriend preferred the Burrat and Pesto, but I preferred the Goat cheese. 

The pizzas aren't large. They are about the size of a large dinner plate. We ended up taking leftovers home. Not a whole lot, but a few slices of pizza.

Great HH! Plenty of options on drink choices and tapas type apps.

Our favs are the hummus it comes with pita but the gluten free option is lettuce wraps (butter lettuce pieces). When we order this we ask for both and they are always nice to do so. I like the lettuce and husband likes the pita.

Small pizzas you can do gluten free or regular. For the true vegan option I believe you have to select the gf option and of course the Daiya. I'm not a fan of gf or Daiya but husband has order that with mushrooms and kala olives and it was ok.

My personal fav fav fav.....is the quinoa and beet salad. Not only is it yummy it's freaking huge!!!!!!!! It's big enough for three people but I like to eat it until my jaw feels likes it's going to fall off :D it's yummy.

Everything was slow from the beginning drinks alcohol bread.  It took forever for us to even get our order in and we told her from the beginning we wanted separate checks and who was on what check.  The waitress forgot drinks and food all night, seemed overwhelmed and actually gave one of my guests pizzas to another table so he sat waiting for over an hour wondering where it was and finally ordered French fries to hold him over until the pizza that was coming never came, he then canceled it after he realized she had no idea where or what happened.  The food came out here and there, one salad appetizer here, someone rises meal there, and the pizzas all took the longest.  We had basically ask her over an over for things and wait a long time for everything.  She apologized but after 2 half hours we decided to skip desert we just wanted to leave.

Ha.

Today, I chose Sammy's. I was out and about Las Vegas with my parents and they tend to be picky eaters. So I thought back to some of my friends who have special meal requests, and I lovingly thought of my friend Katie K. who introduced me to Sammy's a while back. 

Katie has a distinguished palate when it comes to food, so I figured this would be a good, safe place to bring my parents.

We were in the area, so I hopped on Yelp, got some directions, and Boom Boom Pow....we were at Sammy's.

Between the three of us, we shared two pizzas. Enough food for everyone on this light afternoon lunch. The vegetarian pizza (eggplant, peppers, onions, and such), and my all time favorite pizza (goat cheese, sauteed wild mushrooms and spinach).

Everything was fantastic. Fairly healthy, not overly greasy, full of flavor, and a meal that just makes you happy.

Service is very good, and the menu is quite diverse. 

I can't wait to come back for the Tapas menu!

Sammy's is going to be my ""go-to"" before big night's out in Vegas!

The biggest issue is the service. It takes an exorbitantly long time, and it's been a consistent problem for me. I've waited ages and ages for food, even during non peak hours. 

The last time I ate here, they forgot one of our drinks, forgot to put dressing on the side of a salad, and then when the brought out the remade salad undressed, they didn't bring any dressing on the side, I had to ask three times for salt (we sat outside and there wasn't any on the table), and had to ask twice for simple syrup for my iced tea. Some of these were special requests, but a restaurant like this should be able to handle that. 

One of the strange things was that there were a total of 5 different people that came to the table. I'm sure this contributed to the inconsistencies we endured.

Parmesan fries with chipotle aioli was a simple but good accompaniment to the duck tacos, shrimp & crab dip, and our garlic chicken pizza.

Bookmarked this place for their HH: 4-6PM, half off tapas and $2 off wine or beer.

Restaurant interior is more upscale than I expected.
Menu is fairly diverse with vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free options indicated with symbols. Tapas menu has several Mediterranean options, there are a bunch of salads, and of course, there's pizza- if you join their mailing list, you'll get a coupon to try a pizza for free (dine in only, with purchase).

BF and I were here for a light early dinner, got 3 tapas and a beer.
FIG & GORGONZOLA FLATBREAD: Yum, 4-slice portion with good balance of flavors from the sweet figs, salty cheese, and mild spinach, as well as a bit of pork? Adding a sprinkle of red pepper kicked it up a notch.
PARMESAN STUFFED ARTICHOKES: Good lord these were the table favorite, served in a blanket of parmesan crumbs with a cup of dipping sauce. 'Chokes had crunch and flavor, herb coating was light and complemented the cheese inside, which was mild instead of overpowering (as done elsewhere).
DUCK MINI TACOS: An order of 6 mini tacos, filled with 24-hour-marinated duck topped with cilantro, tomatoes, feta, and sour cream, HH pricing at just over $5? Amazeballs. I never would have combined duck and feta, but I love them both and here everything worked so well together in this dish. Fresh and flavorful!

Only thing that detracted from my visit was the service: entered and stood by hostess stand for quite a while before being acknowledged, and our server had way too many tables to herself and was quite frazzled. This was frustrating because there were easily 8 employees present, but I guess maybe they weren't on the clock yet? As 6 o'clock got closer, business picked up and the three women mobbing the hostess stand eventually started picking up the slack.
Normally I'd dock a star for this, but despite being overwhelmed our server was polite and our food came out quickly, and was amazing.

Fabulous food, phenomenal happy hour.  Even with a beer, total before tip was under $20. Will be coming back to try more!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,12,9,4,95raON9Chd1L4bUPnWiOHw

This is a great place off the strip with delicious thin-crust pizza, with any of the options easily made vegan with their Daiya mozarella.

I got the Truffle Oil and Mushroom Pizza, swapping the brie for Daiya, and it was probably the best pizza I've had in a long time. Easily in my top five for vegan pizzas.

Also a winner? Their ""Wok'd"" Sesame Shishito Peppers. It would've probably been something I would've glossed over by myself, but I'm so glad that my friend ordered them because I nearly polished off the plate. So good, and simple. Now that I'm back home, I daydream about them.

Since I knew I was coming here, I signed up the day before for the e-club and got a coupon for a free pizza, with a purchase that is equal to or greater than the price of the pizza. 

I came here with a few ladies after work. It was after 7 so we missed the happy hour which is daily from 4-6. I was surprised they don't have cocktails, only beer and wine. We ordered the balsamic chicken salad and the red quinoa salad, and the organic arugula and pear pizza on a gluten free crust (+$4). The balsamic chicken salad is one of my favorites, it is bomb.com. It has grilled chicken, gorgonzola cheese, walnuts, and greens mixed together with a tasty balsamic vinaigrette. The mild cheese with the tangy dressing work so well together, the flavors make my taste buds do a little dance. The pizza had gorgonzola, arugula, pears and prosciutto. I thought it was too salty for my liking, with the salty cheese and prosciutto, but my friends ate it all up. 

Our server was the worst. He was nice and all, but he forgot to bring us utensils, water and extra napkins after we asked him numerous times. I eventually had to grab utensils off the other tables and find my own napkins, not cool.

After dinner, we ordered the messy sundae to share. It comes in a large glass cup, with vanilla ice cream, chocolate and caramel sauces and whipped cream. When it arrived at our table, we grabbed our spoons and dug right in. This proved not to be an easy task though. The ice cream was as hard as a rock, so we had to wait like 10 minutes for it to soften up so we could eat it. I assume they pre-scoop the ice cream into a glass cup and then freeze it, which probably saves time, but sucked for us.

The people who eat here have NO IDEA what good pizza is. After walking in, my first thought was, ""this does not look good!!"" I should have gone with my initial reaction. The service was mediocre but the pizza was bland, to be kind. When you walk into a wood fired pizza place you should be greeted with the fresh aroma of burning wood, baking pizza dough and melting cheese. Not here. It looked like a Pizza Hut and had no aromas of fresh cooking food, let alone wood fired pizza. I ordered the margarita pizza, one I order nearly every time I visit a real pizza joint. What came out was not at all tasty. The tomatoes were cut too thick, making the crust soggy from all the ""moisture"" not steamed off. The crust, while a meager attempt at a Chicago style deep dish, was very flat. It had very little taste, had no hand tossed texture and zero crispness. The cheese was in sufficient quantity but looked like it was microwaved and tasted as such. The signature melted spots on top of a true ""fired oven"" pizza were nowhere to be seen. To give fair marks, it did have ample fresh basil, but much of it was older looking leaves with a wilt that should never be served on a true pizza. The second pie, a pepperoni, was just as sad. When we asked for a to-go-box for the last three slices, they were brought out in a clear plastic pastry box, stacked on each other. We figured this was their pizza box, but the table next to us got a traditional box. Apparently when you have only three slices left, you don't get a box. Do yourself a favor and skip this pie shoppe. You'll find better pizza at Dominoes.",usaF8WS8BXQlcdfBwyWeWA,0,0,1,7pIV7NGKksEGImi9X01msA

After a night of drinks and karaoke (where one guy thought Linkin Park was some sort of Death Metal group the way he sang ""In The End""), we were convinced to come here by Cheska at the mere mention of ""tacos"". Oh, not just ordinary tacos mind you, but duck tacos. Yes, the aquatic fowl that is wildly enjoyed by this Yelper.

Lo and behold to our surprise, after hours, they have their own set of Happy Hour type pricing and serve tapas (which the duck tacos are a part of).

You'll have to excuse my lapse in memory, I had more than a couple of beers prior to getting here and then some when we did get here, heh. 

Sirloin Skewers, drizzled with a sweet teriyaki glaze - it was bit on the sweet side, and the beef being a little tough, but it was still good and wasn't overly sweet/drowned out by the sauce

Mousakka - with nicey spiced lamb (which I normally don't care for) and melted cheese, but this was really good served with pita bread

Duck Tacos - shredded duck meat, in a small hard corn shell, served with chopped up veggies and a cilantro type sauce; it was good, a bit on the small side, but it wasn't something that would knock you off your feet, still one of my favorite things we got

we ordered duck tacos and lettuce wraps to start. to drink i ordered a hefeweizen and my boyfriend ordered the tenaya creek local draft which we both enjoyed. everything about the duck tacos was amazing except the duck. it was dry and mostly tasteless. the lettuce wraps were alright, like every other lettuce wrap i've had but a little on the salty side. then we ordered a tuscan pizza and a sicilian pizza to share. both were good, but i thought the tuscan was wayyyy too salty. i'm almost positive it was the olives. for dessert we ordered the fudgy sundae.... it came to us in a wine glass on a plate sans the fudge. instead, it was a nasty corn syrupy chocolate sauce (the kind you squirt out of a bottle) that poured over the side of the glass and covered the plate, which was really unappetizing to me. the brownie in it wasn't actually a brownie but these cookie-like pieces. not at all what i had anticipated for $8.50.

Both were good, but the garlic cheese bread was really good in its garlicy and cheesy-ness.  I also had one of the duck tacos from one of the others' plates and it was decent, but if I got it again I'd get it without the creamy tomato cilantro sauce.  Overall, I'd say the food is worth 3 or 3.5 stars, but Dave's coolness bumps this location up to a solid 4 stars.",ZBDh6XD98hTp9_w0mLgCVw,5,4,4,cYQsup39LvC3XNcEudZS2A

This place is very nostalgic to me, because it was my first ""gourmet"" pizza experience as a child, and tonight I was reminded of why I used to love this place. 

My family and I shared a Chinese chicken salad, the bbq chicken pizza, garlic chicken pizza, garlic shrimp pizza, the New York style, and the Thai chicken pizza. Talk about pizza galore. The ingredients on the pizzas were all very fresh, and the dough was so soft. The cheese was also really thick and chewy which I am fond of. My favorites were the garlic chicken and shrimp and the bbq chicken pizza. I forgot how large the pizzas actually were so we ended up taking half of the pizzas home. IMO, this place is still better than CPK (CPK is overrated and overpriced).

Server was nice and accommodating.

I don't have many choices because of my gluten intolerance but Sammy's has GF options.  My husband and I ordered the exact same pizza's as we did at the N Durango location and they didn't taste anything like the ones we had there. 

They both were under cooked, the ingredients didn't taste fresh at all. It just didn't taste like it held the same standards as that location. I've only eaten at the N Durango location and that set the bar pretty high and this didn't even come close. 

It wasn't even worth asking them to remake it, or put it back in the oven, because I don't believe they could have done any better than what they served us. Needless to say I walked out hungry and slightly grumpy that I wasted my money. 

It has a casino/bar and restaurant you can sit and order at and I normally don't like to sit in the ""smoking"" section but the hubby wanted to gamble and we were the only ones in there so I that's where we ate. Bartenders were nice and very personable.I ordered the cucumber cooler (i think)  and it was about as delicious as the food.

I've raved about the Durango & 95 location. Now I know that each location could be different from the next, so keep that in mind.

They have small plates like Tapas, soups, salad, tacos and ofcourse pizza. I had the Thai pizza and tried the Thai satay.

I love their Chinese chicken salad and the chicken garlic pizza is delicious! The salad is huge and can easily be split between two people. The pizzas at Sammys are coated on the bottom of the crust in cornmeal before throwing it in the wood fired oven so it added and extra crunch. 

I usually order the lunch blackened chicken over a bed a warmed kale with lentils and tomato soup. The chicken is moist and flavorful and the salad has a light lemon dressing without any oil so it's tasty without being fattening.

We always drive the extra miles to go to the Sammy's on Rainbow/215. That location is great, the food is ALWAYS, ALWAYS cooked to perfection and tastes great. We go so much, the manager knows us and we have our preferred/favorite server, Gwen. She's great!!! If you don't mind the drive, I recommend that location....especially if you don't want to have stomach aches from the greasy foods from THIS location on Sahara. Our faves are the BBQ chicken pizza (made with Gouda), spicy chicken meatballs, crab and shrimp dip and the hummus.

I have been here several times and their pizza is awesome. I personally like the ""New York"" pizza and have never been disappointed.

I have also had the balsamic chicken salad a few times and it is also good, but not as good on the good scale as the pizza.

Where they fall short, starters and appetizers.  Because the individual pizza is filling, I usually stay away from the appetizers and starter items.  However, today I was in the mood for something new.  It was raining so I figured it was a good soup day.  I ordered Lobster Bisque - VERY tasty but $8 bucks for a small sized bowl.  I also thought some of the parmesan crusted artichokes sounded good.  Nope, they were not good and they were $10 for basically one artichoke heart cut into 4 pieces.  I felt a little violated here.  

Service is always adequate - never bad but never anything above and beyond and that's ok with me too.

I would recommend this place for the pizza and because it's very good, I gave the 4 stars.  I would have only given 3 stars otherwise.",McDGTZ5J4ViG46PNrkPOfA,1,0,4,uY7kTufLRymiNSFy_BtEeg

Our most recent visit was a few weeks ago, when we used my promotional Birthday Gift, the iconic Messy Sundae (ooey-gooey caramel and fudge topped vanilla ice cream with walnuts and whipped topping; it's one of my fave desserts of all time---yeah, it's that good). It was a saturday and was way before the lunch rush. So, it was quiet, until the large family who kept asking for ""gluten-free"" this & that arrived (Oh, I'm sure that their server was annoyed. Ok, maybe they weren't as annoying as the family who complained about the salads being ""way too big"" and thus their bill was adjusted, ahem; that was on another past visit). We got a different pizza this time (we've tried five different ones total, over the years), and had the truffle fries (to-die-for romano cheese-topped goodness). Our son loved the fries. He's kind of a picky eater, meaning, he won't eat it if he doesn't like it, picky. 
 
Service is always good. The bathroom is always clean. The rest of the restaurant grounds/main dining area, is always clean. If you can brave it, it's cold right now, there is seating outside, in the front. There is a bar part, too (separate---and yes, you guessed it, I've been to that part, too, years ago, though). And Happy Hour too. The food is solid--- from the pizzas, and must mention that the mini kobe beef burgers are really yummy, too. The salads are really good, too (I wouldn't be complaining about how big they are, either, hahaha).

It's christmas time, and there's a gift card promotion (Buy $50, Bonus $10 certificate), so why not get some christmas shopping done here, too? Grab a bite, try the kobe minis, along with a pizza, and get the messy sundae. Sounds like a plan. 

Also has a few other locations: centennial, flamingo (9516), rainbow/215, and green valley, too.",fiGqQ7pIGKyZ9G0RqWLMpg,2,1,4,d8iQQqjR8GcBNMRG2jRXNw

 Makes me a little nervous about this place.

The pizza here isn't huge... they are a little bigger than a personal pan pizza at Pizza Hut. Sammy's gives you some healthy options for the crust you can either get wheat crust for a dollar more or gluten free for I think $3.00 dollars more. I opted for the wheat crust because I'm not sure what health benefits gluten free would have on me. I'm not used to making healthy choices but I try...sometimes. I was afraid the crust would be hard and stale but it was very fresh and fluffy inside. My topping for my order was Mozzarella with fresh basil. The cheese was nice and gooey like gum which in my book is a good thing! 

It was a chilly day so I also ordered a bowl of Lobster Bisque soup. This is my first time having it and I was happy that it had a creamy texture. There were little bits of lobster in it and it didn't leave a weird after taste in my mouth. It was pretty tasty!

Yet I commend Sammy's and their manager Karissa for taking the time to listen & respond to its customers when they didn't have to. Thank you so much, Karissa.

We returned to this location, and the pear & arugula pizza was delicious again & perfect this time. The gluten free crust was the best my partner said he's ever had. Everyone enjoyed the ducks tacos. It was my partner's daughter's birthday, and we all loved the gigantic ice cream sundae. The sundae was something I wouldn't normally order as an adult lol, but omg it was goood.

Our server was delightful; she really went the extra mile. From recommending an Arnold Palmer (his daughter's first, which she loved), to carrying her birthday candle to the side so the wind wouldn't blow it out before she could, to just being genuinely cheerful, she and the manager on duty provided exceptional service. 

It was beautiful sitting in the outside booths on a sunny day. I think this is a great lunch spot, a little oasis in the middle of the city. And after feeling valued as a customer, they've got my loyalty.

They do tend to get really swamped during lunch time at the Sahara and Flamingo location by businessmen.  They have amazing happy hour pricing between 3pm- 6pm.  

I'm just gonna lay out a list of good tapas there.  The mini duck tacos,  the coconut shrimp skewers, chicken lettuce cups, mac & cheese, and the hummus is yum!

My favorite pizza is the truffle & brie pizza.  It's crispy, thin crusted, layered with melted brie cheese and mushrooms and truffle oil.  It's a nice change in taste compared to the usual mozarella cheeses used in pizza.  I added prociutto to it sometimes if I'm feeling a little carnivorous. 

The salads are always ice cold and fresh.  You can't go wrong with the Caesar Salad served with grilled chicken breast.  The romaine lettuce is always ice cold all the times I've had it, and its's served with dressing is savory & tangy.  The Chilled Roasted Vegatable Salad is definitely is my favorite guilt-free salad.  It has edamame, tomatoes, mozarella pearls, spinach, drizzled with olive oil and balsalmic vinegar.

Probably picked the wrong place to eat). The restaurant was very warm... I am always  old (even in las vega summers) but the first thing I asked the waitress aw to please have the ac turned down as I was sticking to my shirt after only a few minutes in my booth. She agreed that it was warm,but thought it was because she was working hard. It never cooled off much after our initial discussion. Oh well... Food was ok... Not great and not bad enough to send back. Grilled shrimp salad was soggy, over dressed ( forgot to ask for dressing on the side), soup was hot, weird oily creaminess. I did not like the leftover coating in my mouth so hubby ate this. Garlic bread was over greasy... Really it was a white pizza, not garlic bread like I thought. Bar far, the worst part of the meal was a salad that we took home for our daughter. We ordered the chopped sAlad to go. We did not bother to. Heck it before we left the restaurant (would never have occurred to me!). When she opened the sAlad, she thought we were playing a joke on her. There were 4 small cubes of chicken,6 small pieces of copped tomAto, a sprinkle of chopped black olives and about 4 cups of shredded lettuce!  We could not find anything else in this sAlad... She deconstructed everything, cut up her own tomAto, shredded some cheese, removed more than half of the shredded lettuce and had her dinner. Still An anemic salad, but when it's late Nd youRe hungry, what are you going to do? Horrible... There is no way they would have served this salad in the restaurant. I feel ripped off! I would have called to complain, but then they would probably offer to replace or give a coupon. No thanks, I have no desire to go back...

Since we had our dog with us, we decided to call and see if they let dogs eat on the patio.

Me: ""Excuse me, do you guys allow small dogs on your patio?""
Sammy's Employee: ""Yes! Of course, it shouldn't be a problem.""

Well it was a problem.

We arrived and was greeted not by someone asking if they could help us, but someone who wanted to tell us our dog was not allowed. And rather than having it be a conversation to get clarity on their policy (because after all we just called) -- he said that ""Sammy's was a restaurant and dogs weren't allowed to eat on the patio because it was a health violation.""

Hmmm...

Well how does Lazy Dog Restaurant in Summerlin stay compliant? I saw enough dogs on their patio to merit a shelter.

Tapas, Lettuce wraps, Tacos, Hummus? I thought this was a pizza joint, but there are mostly non-pizza items on the menu.

It's nice to see gluten free and dairy free pizza options on the menu, but they charge way too much for it here. The personal pizzas are around $13, but if you want GF/DF it will be $5 extra. Apparently Sammy's thinks people with allergies should pay 40% more than everyone else.

The gluten free crust is not made in house, it's a very thin premade crust. Worse, they don't even know how to fire it. My pizza was soggy in the center, it flopped over and the toppings fell off when I picked up a piece.  $18 for this small soggy pizza is steep, even if it is gluten and dairy free.

I make a far better gluten free pizza at home. Even Whole Foods can make a better gluten and dairy free pizza, at less than half the price of Sammy's.

A redeeming factor is the Daiya cheese, it's awesome and pretty much impossible to screw up. Even if you eat dairy you will probably love this stuff.

The waitress recommended ""Kobe"" beef sliders to my friend, and assured her that the fries were fresh cut when asked. The sliders tasted like average low grade beef, lacked seasoning, and were overcooked (she ordered medium rare but there was no trace of pink inside). The fries were clearly frozen, definitely not fresh cut. Maybe the waitress didn't know, or maybe she flat out lied about the fries being fresh cut. Either way it was a disappointment.

Left feeling like I overpaid for mediocre food, got price gouged because of allergies, and food was misrepresented by the waitress.

Another reviewer @Tim D. put it perfectly, I wasn't hungry when I left, but I wasn't terribly happy about that. Pretty much sums it up for me.",5rL-YgU3CXHbQA3Txzdd9g,3,2,1,Mm3PrysHifV7OWimqWDeIQ

4-6pm AND Midnight-8am! 
- It also has a smoke-free, 24-hr Tavern!

Before coming to this Sahara location, my wife and I had visited another Sammy's by Durango/Elkhorn and we loved it (separate review). I am glad to report that this Sahara locale also has all the niceties typical of Sammy's. It has the same great HH menu with $2 off drinks and half price tapas, and excellent service! Although its patio has only a view of the parking lots, it does have a charming fire pit. The restaurant has an impressive building exterior; a nice entrance through the patio; a comfortable bar counter and 2 wings of small dining areas. Next to one side of the dining room is its famous 24-hr Tavern.

MY HAPPY HOUR EXPERIENCE:
- Per fellow Yelpers' good recommendations, I dropped by this nice place 2days ago for early happy hour, and had a delightful experience.  As expected, since it was a Monday, the place was not crowded, with only a few tables of guests. 
- Thinking out loud: If they extend the happy hours to 7pm (like Gordon Biersch, Kona Grill, Embers, and Chicago Brewing Co.), it might draw more people coming after work.

Here, I enjoyed, once again, the pork dumplings (3.50), and mini duck tacos (5.25), a beer (3) and a cab (5), all of them just as tasty as those served at the other Sammy's! Being by myself this time, though, I couldn't get all my favorite dishes. Sigh! I had to pass up the garlic cheese flat bread and the lettuce cups! Would have been even nicer with more people to share and sample more temptations! My bill came to a reasonable $18 (plus tips). Not bad!

The waitress was very friendly. But she was working all alone for our section, so was not too attentive, though adequate. One of the managers (Jeff?) was helping her out, though, which is a mark of excellence for management. Another friendly lady manager (Heather) also dropped by at various tables to chat a little with customers. Both managers were super pleasant, making customers feel welcome. They pointed out to me the unique features of this particular locale, such as the reverse happy hour (midnight-8am) and its 24-hr Tavern, which is supposed to be smoke-free, too. 

- Yah, I'm putting this locale on my own ""List of Favorite Bars in the Summerlin Neighborhood Area for Happy Hours""!

Round two: It is after 11pm, but I am okay with dealing with smoke because I am starving and an arugula pizza sounds divine. However, after sitting at a table for at least 10 minutes, the only interaction was a bartender telling us it was a shift change and someone would be with us in a minute while he proceeded to clear tables, restock ice and take his closing tables checks, so after those 10 minutes, I left. I was just too hungry. All of this to say: snooze on their 24-hour tavern. (See previous update for reference.) Stick to the main squeeze. I can't imagine we will keep this on our 24-hour dining options after the past two visits.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,10,8,4,UUJWSl8uud9ld6qzwLf5og

My last trip, I sat outside on the patio. A beautiful 70 degree day in January isn't wasted on me. I came starving and glanced over the menu. My lunch mates were also craving everything, so we settled on a few tapas and a pizza.

We ordered the Chicken Lettuce Cups, Mini Duck Tacos, and Parmesan Crusted Artichokes. The lettuce cups were flavorful and light. I didn't care too much for the duck tacos, but my girlfriend loved them, and she devoured the rest of mine, my favorite was the artichoke. They were deep-fried and came with a yummy sauce. Indulgent and sinful. My favorite of the entire meal. 

The pizza we ordered was the Sun-Dried Tomato (Artisan crust) which was topped with goat cheese, pine nuts, and basil. Me, oh my. This was a very nontraditional pie and the flavors were fresh and bold. The pine nuts added a fun crunch twist, usually reserved for just the crust. I would order this again and again.

Being fatty patties, we ordered the salted caramel pudding which is pretty much sex in glass. ORDER IT! I only state that sternly because it's like crack (addictive) and I need other people to understand/feel my pain.

Sammy is a great bet for those with different dietary needs. The have an assortment of vegan, vegetarian, and gluten-free goodies. Service is always attentive. It's a quiet, relaxed atmosphere.

I really enjoyed the salad I picked: the Chilled Wild Mexican Shrimp. My sister ordered the Caesar salad which was average and the other one we ordered was the Red Quinoa which I wasn't crazy about. I didn't like the quinoa and it was kind of spicy but that is more my personal preference. Everyone else loved it but hands down everyone loved the Chilled Wild Mexican Shrimp. 

The pizza was good...nice and thin for the woodfired. I wonder how thin their thin pizza's are. I thought the pizza's would be a little bigger though but after eating the salads first, it was a good amount of pizza to eat...not too much. 

The service was good...friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable too. 

The best part had to be the dessert: all five of us shared the Messy Sundae (vanilla ice cream covered in chocolate and caramel sauce with walnuts and whip cream). Soooo good. There was even some left over after all five of us digged in. However, the ice cream was put in this weird plastic like wine cup which made it kind of hard to get the ice cream out and the chocolate fudge on the bottom didn't make it easier because it made the cup slide. I would recommend they change the presentation of the sundae into a bowl to make it easier for sharing.",3_UzdLx7oQ4759Ho-5bGPQ,0,0,5,MsG6QbCOPKQQTZ8ERaiuEw

5 star reviews are easy because you just can't wait to spill your guts about your love for that place and you want to describe every component of your meal as if you were extolling the virtues of your children.  Vice versa for 1 star reviews: the hyperbole and metaphors just write themselves when the server ignores you for an hour or your $15 burger is ice cold in the middle.   3 stars though on yelp?  ""A-OK.""  ?   Where's the fun in that? 

Sammy's delivers decent, but unspectacular food with good to great service with average value for your dollar.   -SLAP-  Wake up!

I go here once every few weeks because a friend of mine at work loves their Ahi Tuna burgers.   I've had them.  They're okay.  Yup.  ""A-OK"".   I've also tried their Mini Salmon Burgers, their mini kobe beef burgers, their white tuna and spinach salad, their chicken and hummus wrap, the Diavola pizza, and the Oak Roasted Salmon Filet.   They were all... you guessed it.  ""A-OK"".  Yaaaaaaaaaawwn.  Where was I?     Nothing has blown my mind.  Nothing has gotten me on the phone with the Clark County Health Department.   Everything has satisfied me (okay except the Salmon Filet because it was $16 and really not worth that), and unfortunately for the entertainment value of this review, nothing has offended me.   

They do give a discount for CSN employees (and maybe students?  I didnt ask because I don't really care), so props for that!   

So yeah, 3 stars.  If you made it to this part of the review, you deserve a compliment.   Go you!",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,1,0,3,e_pOWhRajQ4dNfode5LgKw

When it arrived, it was very thin crust indeed, so thin, the juices from the sausage and mushrooms seemed to have melted through the crust, it was impossible to eat without a utensil.

We decided to order the Arugula Salad, Lobster Bisque, Tomato Basil Soup, (2) Shrimp Angel Hair Pastas and the Flourless Chocolate Cake for dessert. There was a couple of things we complained about during our visit: first, the soups came out pretty cold. We asked our server if it could be heated up but they were nice enough to bring us a fresh and hot new soup. Second, our server was barely around our entire dinner and didn't even offer us bread with our soups. We had to ask other servers who walked near our table for refills and other requests. Third, the two pastas were lacking sauce and were very dry. We had to ask for extra sauce on the side and thankfully they brought out a big bowl of sauce for us to put on our pastas which definitely helped. However, throughout most of the meal I had to keep adding salt and Parmesan cheese to mask this ""dishwater"" taste the pasta had.

The epitome of bad chain-restaurant food.  Their namesake pizza is all dough and the crust is soft.  Crust should be crusty, not like a big slab of white bread.

The menu is a bland sampling of everything popular at other restaurants.  Tapas?  Really?  Those are not tapas.  They're appetizers.  Chicken Lettuce Wraps stolen from Pf Chang are not tapas.  Garlic bread, dumplings, baba ghanoush, thai chicken skewers.  What the hell is this menu?  These are appetizers, not tapas.  Also this is a crappy, bready-ass pizza place with wilted lettuce salads and bottled dressings and surely no real chef anywhere near the kitchen.

They want to please all of the suburban happy-hour housewives out there sipping an overpriced glass of grocery-store chardonnay so they lay out every bs thing that is trendy on someone else's menu.  Sliders and tapas and wraps and hummus and chicken lettuce wraps and pizza and tacos and burgers and doughnuts.  Enough.

If you want sliders, hit slidin thru.  If you want tapas, go to Firefly.  If you have a hankering for pizza, go to Settebello or Aurelio's or Due Forni.  Hungry for tacos?  Los Tacos or Tacos El Gordo.  This place specializes in bad renditions of food done way better elsewhere, made for people who don't know any better or don't care.

Just do one thing well!  Your namesake pizza is a disgrace.  Start there.

Another warning sign of a crummy restaurant is when you see trademark signs after their menu items.  Welcome to Chili's or Applebee's or Sammy's or whatever other pre-made frozen garbage restaurant with sauces that show up at the backdoor every monday in a  bag.  Everything heated up to order!

Nice selection on the menu with a variety of flavors and vegetarian meals.

Started with the Crab, Shrimp, and Artichoke Dip. GF's choice...I thought I would hate it. Turned out to be my favorite part of the meal. Topped with bubbly Romano cheese and served with herb rubbed pita bread. I really loved this. Oh ya and it had huge chunks of soft and sweet garlic.

We shared the Sun-dried Tomato and Goat Cheese Pizza w/ Pine Nuts. This was also very good but kinda small. Also shared a Beef Skewer Salad. Nice amount of beef ( 6 skewers ) but not much else that was that good...some lettuce, peanuts, bean sprouts, and grilled pineapple ( probably made the whole salad worth it ). The salad was $15.99 and just OK. But is was pretty big. 

Next time probably skip the salad and order the one I know I like ( Thai peanut ), or another entree.

Speaking of, I had the greek salad and it was truly wonderful.  It was fresh and had plenty of baby persian cucumbers, feta cheese, olives, red onions, tomatoes, and pepperoncini. It came already dressed in just the right amount of house dressing.  They make a damn good salad! 

I had an appetizer as my main course...I had the seasoned shredded beef empanadas which had dried currants, onions, and spicy salsa verde on the side for dipping.  The crust was nice but the filling was bizarre...the cumin was overpowering and the dried currants were a strange addition...like tiny little raisins.  I can't recommend this dish at all.

While our family like this place and our child cannot get enough of their pizza, I highly recommend you always checking for yourself and making your own opinion when reading reviews--all reviews, especially filtered by Yelp as not recommended. You need to scroll down to the bottom of all reviews and click on ""xx other reviews currently not recommended"" to be able to read reviews hidden by Yelp.",J4SZo350Uctc6Qf9q9PUTQ,2,0,5,IPZhgpK75zL3_LXPL8AUqg

Waitress apologized.  Said the chicken was being fresh cooked.  Manager finally came by and offered us a free tapas to ease the wait (nice touch).  But when dishes finally arrived, I found about 5 pieces of chicken in my heaping salad that taste wise had been compromised by an over generous drenching of some kind of dressing (sesame oil, I think) that produced more heat than taste.  Wife's wrap was more robust with chicken, but not noticeably fresh cooked.  Overall, a poor experience.",C4FSyd-6Vj_vnNVejGckEg,0,0,2,Z2B-85hcREJdNQIDOZyXdw

Pretty good GF pizza.  Good wheat crust pizza. Very good coconut shrimp skewers. Love their commitment to sustainability. There was an issue with presenting the free pizza coupon on my smart phone, but they made an exception and took care of it.  loved that it was nice and mellow in there: nice break from the typical Vegas experience.  Worth the 10 minute drive from downtown.  Great outdoor seating.",FqqzEY8r8WnkDwGob4hc3Q,0,0,5,D25BRy2hORnWnfDGmovkpQ

The last few visit to Sammy's have been at their Centennial and Flamingo locations, and I raved about it.  This time wasn't such a fortuitous event.  

We shared one of their Tapas appetizers, the hummus with kobe beef, and that was fabulous.  It came with triangles of seasoned pita that stayed crisp to the end, and we sure did finish every drop of the hummus.

We followed it up with our standard - The Thai chicken salad.  The last time we had this was at the Centennial Sammy's, and it was so big we couldn't finish it.  This time it was skimpy, with half the amount of chicken, and not enough of the greens for us to be fully satisfied, and I'm not a big eater.  There used to be two sizes of this salad, but it was changed before we had it at Centennial, so it's definitely not a case of us having ordered a larger size last time.

When we commented to the waiter (our waitress seemed to have disappeared and he was the only one working the room), he asked if we wanted to change it for something else.  We didn't.  It was late, and we'd already gone through most of it, which wasn't hard to do this time.  He then asked my husband if he'd like another beer.  It sure sounded as if he were comping it as a result of our negative comment, but when he brought the bill, there was the charge for that second beer!!  He did remove it, but it seemed to go hand in hand with the indifferent and unfriendly service that took over when our waitress split.

This Sammy's is a bit closer to our house than the others, and is usually more convenient when we're on our way back from the Strip or environs, but next time we'll have to rethink it.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,1,1,3,8AfG3qx5hva_Xgoui_a34Q

Mostly because of the cookie cutter decor, mediocre service, typical short of nothing special menu and general ambiance. Yes, IMO Sammy's has some of that, but for what they lack they have a better than expected menu. They offer whole grain pasta and generally healthy options-or at least more than most. It is difficult to eat out and be limited to very few options when you're watching your diet. The food was tasty with average prices. I can't complain about much, but I won't complain at all. I'm sure I'll return in the near future.",WyMuUvqsJN1-s6LsNIeAlQ,4,4,4,JUTkxng2qkS98yX3m9qTLg
5969880,2014-12-07,0,gHoP4eJimaMltfUlp6EP4Q,"Food is decent. Service needs help. Walked in 8pm, place not even 1/3 full and immediately told I'll be right with you. No hi welcome or nicety. More like what you would expect from flos diner. 
Seated and waited WAY too long for menus and drinks to order. 
Maybe I am too critical but I expect my water to be refilled without asking, to be asked - when my beer is empty - if I would like another, be checked on during appetizers and the meal as to if we are enjoying the meal and is everything good. 
With all that being said and the food being adequate there are many other choices with better pizza and service - which may be why the place was 2/3 empty. I will move onto other places - good luck",p30VbeNZC6mzRUTL6lg69w,0,0,2,O6QUi2avU4cZd4SwLpvibw

I was able to add goat cheese which was awesome so I'm assuming you can add extra toppings to any of the pizzas however I'm not sure if it costs extra b/c I didn't see the bill so be sure to ask if you care about that.

The pizza was definitely good. Not bad, not out of this world.
My hubby, his grandma and I shared their donut dessert that came with
chocolate and raspberry sauce. Yummy, cripsy and fresh out of the oven!

Extra points for expressing sustainability and buying local ingredients as a matter of importance on their menu. Yay, sustainability, local ingredientsand yummy food!",Mt0CBc2ExBfu9A8GnWlk4g,1,0,4,LPB1r6_4BFlXTgSKhTtv5w

Waitress always remembers us and has for years. Food menu is available 24/7 through the attached bar so if you're out late its perfect. You can sit outside near the fire pit or plenty of inside seating also. My favorite food items include the Lebni app and the goat cheese pizza, but I've honestly never had anything bad here. Wish they would open up on the north side!",kiao9cLyffXHVth0B1FwfA,0,0,5,6dCwxpe_aW5OBwfIDeU5AA
