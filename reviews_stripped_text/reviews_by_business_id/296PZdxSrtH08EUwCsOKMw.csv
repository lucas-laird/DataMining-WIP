54604,2010-05-26,1,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"After reading all of these ecstatic reviews, I mentioned to my boyfriend that it would be fun to try this restaurant someday for a fancy occasion. He took me there for my birthday last night and I was underwhelmed.

First of all, the decor has not been updated since the 1970s at the latest. Lace tablecloths, hideous carpet, old school everything. The bar was equally strange. We asked for a wine-by-the-glass list at the bar and they didn't have one. We ordered a split of champagne.

Upon being seated, we were presented with a massive plate of veggies, two ""bread baskets"" (translation - one basket of giant water crackers and one basket of flavorless pumpernickel cheese crackers)  and handed the menu. The menu is as old school as menus get. Think about all the items you would see at a fancy restaurant in a small town...the kind where there is only one fancy restaurant. Totally typical meat and fish fare, everything bathed in some sort of butter sauce.

Everything is exorbitantly expensive. Most entrees are well north of $50. The only thing on the menu that attracted me was the Maine lobster, but it was over $100 and I didn't feel like any entree at this restaurant would feel worth that much.

We ordered the sea bass and the salmon. Before they arrived, we were treated to a citrus-lemon-lime sorbet bathed in champagne. A fun, old school touch. When they came, they were plated next to the table on a rolling station that kept everything warm. 

Both pieces of fish were insanely massive, looked like they had been fried at some point during the cooking process, and came in a giant pool of butter, along with a tomato stuffed with breadcrumbs and assorted lemon garnishes. They tasted ok and were cooked nicely.

For dessert, we ordered the key lime pie 'from Florida'. It was great except had a soapy, bitter aftertaste so we sent it back and got an average Tiramisu.

Then they brought out a plate of candied fruit dipped in chocolate along with a massive fruit bowl. None of it was great.

It seems like the focus at Michael's is to give great service and to stuff the clientele so they are rolling out of the restaurant, not to wow people with food and ambiance. If you're a young, foodie type, skip this restaurant. If you're taking your grandparents out to a fancy dinner, this might just work. I will not be returning to this relic.",SvDBPy8VQoe7gdzR-RAcjg,6,0,2,DSMoMqnpNJMFkbTRNdW_nw

First of all, it has an ""old Vegas"" vibe to it. Classy, relaxed, and the sort of place I imagine the Rat Pack used to visit while in Sin City. The ambience is thick cushioned seating, rich dark woods, and very rich feeling without being pretentious.

The service is insanely attentive and polite. Friendly and courteous, the staff treat you with respect. They are friendly without being overly familiar, there are no ""yukka yukka"" antics that you see at other places. Just perfect service.

The food portions are massive and plentiful and delicious. The food may not be the best, but it is worth the price and the service alone is worth the price.

If you are looking for somewhere that makes you feel like you've stepped into classic Vegas, this is the place for you.

Absolutely recommend!",_-fbl1YgL72wrnDa23y3wQ,4,1,5,SPUCtWOYZ4u42FxanRVzYQ

The prices are a bit more; however, there are a lot of extras that this goes to support.  The great crudite that begins the experience to the intermezzo served with a splash of Dom Perrion to the fruit bowl at the end.

The table side Caesar is not to be missed and the lamb chops were delicious!

 Our steak was cooked to perfection and the vegetable sides were so fresh.  Loved the Hollandaise and Bernaise sauces on the side.  Service is impeccable-every detail is taken care of.

From the time you arrive to the time you leave you feel like you are back in the glitzy Bugsey Segal Vegas.  Yes the prices are on the high side but worth every penny.

It was still as good the second time around, and while it was -hard- not to get the New England lobster..The Dover sole was out-of-this world divine.

Wanted to note that the desserts have improved! No longer cold or icy, just a perfectly cool temperature for eating. I got the Contreau chocolate mousse cake, and it was heavenly.

I also splurged and got a 20-year old glass of port for dessert. Yes, i'm a goofball and don't remember the brandname. (was a tad drunk, so sue me) and it was an eye-opening rush of alcohol goodness. Smooth as the finest silk, too bad my buzz was already going good to savor it more.

Now, however, out at the South Point, the quality has faded.  The waiters no longer strive so hard to create that one of a kind experience.  It's like they chose to get by on as little effort as they could.

Sad to see the quality go so far to the south.  It's time to close the brand and put it ouot of it's misery.",6lVUZznV7Fqy0mHwqKVNcQ,4,0,2,bGN6-aHTw8VH2XzqFsX29Q
532818,2013-01-18,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"Micheal's has been a Las Vegas tradition for over twenty years. Many of the waiters have been there since it opened. When Micheal's closed from Bill's many were out of a job. Micheal's reopened at the South Point Casino and those who wanted their old jobs back had them. How many employers today will do that? None that I know of.

The door to the restaurant does not reflect the beauty of the interior. When you enter you notice the red walls, tables and furnishings. It is very elegant inside. If you look up you will see the stained glass ceiling. This was removed from the old Micheal's location and brought to the South Point. This allows long standing customers to feel as if they were in the same locale.

Service is very quick. There are several of the wait staff around at almost all times. They do keep their distance while you dine, but are there at the wave of a hand. Many of the dishes are prepared table side. Some of the salads, many of the entrees and some of the deserts. So, even if you are not getting one of these items you can watch the show at the table next to you.

Every item was delicious. The steaks were prepared as asked for. They were so tender and tasty. Savory does not describe it good enough. This ranks as some of the best steak I have ever had. I had gratin potatoes on the side. They were not oozing with cheese like a lot of gratin potatoes. The cheese was more hinted at and the dish had a wonderful smooth rich taste.

We were all to full for desert but were brought an after dinner fruit plate. This plate did not have pieces of fruit. It had whole fruit. Grapes, apples, strawberry's, blueberry's and oranges. As well as some chocolates. Who needs desert with that after any meal.

Be prepared to spend a few hundred per guest. This is not cheap food, but it is worth the expense.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,3,2,4,aojCpSRryqMMHMyMqgE-Ng
535766,2008-06-28,10,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"My boss has several favorite restaurants. But this is one of his all time favorites. And he's taken me here twice now. Once for my 40th birthday. And last year as an X-mas treat. Santa came early that year... but in a good way. It truly doesn't get much better than this.

The service is impeccable. Without being unctuous. As some service in fine dining can be. It wasn't just that our waiter was clever, quick and charming. He was so very knowledgeable. He took a great deal of time to explain the whole deal to us. But it wasn't one of those, ""Holy hell will he just get on with it already?!"" moments. It was a thing of splendor.

The first time we had the tasting menu. You had a choice between two menus at that time. And I went, big surprise, with the seafood. As did my boss. We began with a three level layer of plates with different caviars. And the accoutrement. I didn't grow up wealthy. But every new years caviar was served. The Romanoff stuff in the little jar you buy in any supermarket. I've had the good stuff before. But this was unsurpassed. Russian, American and I can't quite recall what the third one was. But it was all excellent. Hey, boss! If you're reading this, I need a raise so I can eat this stuff more often.

It was followed by a plate of lobster claws and crab legs with a mustard sauce I would smother on a lover. Just that good. Is that tarragon? I don't even care. Just stand back. Because nobody comes between me and my shellfish. I'm just selfish that way. Then a scampi dish that I would knock my grandmother over to enjoy. We had a French version of risotto that was superlative. It was a cross between bouillabaisse and risotto. Rock me chef. Just rock me. It had langoustines.

We shared bubbly, and a few half bottles of wine that our great server suggested... boss isn't fond of sommeliers. He had an experience with one that was bad. He still wakes up screaming.

Managed to get good and toasted despite all the food. As he carried me back to my room I recall whispering, softly, ""Langoustines, Langoustines.""

The second time was just as good. But a little less drunk out.",Lqd1JqofF8ECev8uuxb3xA,11,8,5,zaQyK-cmfrCJfxlEEkFHQA

584602,2016-07-22,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"So the best part of our dinner was our waiter making our Caesar Salad from scratch.   They start by cracking the egg and using just the yolk.  Then they do their thing, and out comes this awesome super fresh salad.   I also liked all of the fine little touches and appetizers that were came out with ""complements of the chef.""  

I ordered a steak that was cooked perfectly.  It did have this mushroom sauce that I will order on the side next time. 

My Wife ordered the Sea Bass.  Very crispy.  We suspect they deep fried it, since the outside was so crunchy and the inside of the fish so moist and tasty. 

They have an amazing dessert cart loaded with all kinds of treats, we had a chocolate cake that we enjoyed.

The atmosphere was red, swanky, and super old school. 

Service was amazing.  We had to tell our one of our servers so stop bringing water. 

The only issue of course was the price.  It was a bit higher than I would have expected, but the little touches and experience made it seem worth it.  

 I would definitely go again, but only for a special occasion.",xnzXQXTKzIa3wy-C795Hxg,2,1,4,DPEyS6FbHIaGtKRYgE4lLQ

1.  There were 4 of us and just behind us was a man talking on his cell phone.  We mentioned to the head waiter that we did not come to this restaurant to listen to some moron on the phone.  Nothing was done.
When you dine at a restaurant of this quality you don't expect to have to listen to people on their cell phones.  Since the people are rude they should be told to please use their phone away from the dining area, either in the bar or in the hall.
2.  Ordered French onion soup that had to be sent back as the onions were basically raw.  When I told the head waiter the problem he argued with me but eventually replaced the soup with a salad that was skimpy at best and severely over priced.  The quality of the service and food has gone down immensely.  Will not be going back after 7 years of patronizing this establishment.",2f3AviKa9yehY1BBWFDtYA,1,0,3,M_qzK4qWT7m_zS5E3R6Zow
659676,2012-11-02,1,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"It's like this place was good 15 years ago and then they stopped trying. The decor was extremely dated, I know they're going for that classic steakhouse feel, but it just looked old. The relish tray was all unhealthy junk out of a can. No fresh bread, only crackers. The service was just adequate. They served you water out of plastic bottles. I appreciate bottled water, but at this price point, either pour it in a glass pitcher to serve or buy bottled water in a glass container.

The Caesar salad was made fresh table-side but it was really oily. The Filet, while cooked perfectly, was essentially flavorless so I had to keep smothering it in the bearnaise sauce. The broccoli side dish was literally soggy steamed broccoli on a plate of water. I will say that the SeaBass was perfectly cooked, flavorful with a nice flaky crust. That, I would recommend. 

For what you spend here, take the 10 minute drive up to the strip and go to Mastros, STK or even Carnevino, you'll enjoy everything about those restaurants a lot more.",s5tbgDQhyyMtf36DRpBz9g,1,0,2,MYcJs_rNc-fKogp0P6BnVA

I got the sirloin ($86). It was not as flavorful as I've experienced at Michaels and certainly not worth $86. Our side dishes ($12 each) were creamed corn, asparagus and au gratin potatoes. The corn and potatoes were quite good. There was nothing special about the asparagus. Following our disappointing dinner, the dessert tray was presented. We all surprised each other as each of us declined a dessert - something that is unusual for our group! All of us said we were not going to continue to be disappointed.

Shrimp Cocktail  $25 -  Rubbery shrimp

Complimentary Sorbet with Dom pallet cleanser

Shrimp Scampi  $58   Sent back because Shrimp were so fishy.  Replaced it with Chicken Sicilian for $54.  Not very good.

6 OZ filet  - $68 ala carte  -   Dry and unseasoned.

Potato Au Gratin - $15  - Very good.

Complimentary Dessert platter with fruit and chocolate.  Very good.

We had a fantastic meal with impeccable service! The decor is a little outdated for me but I understand the theme they were going for. We had 8 servers waiting on our party of 6. *One thing I really loved was that the menus handed to the women were different than the menus handed to the men in that prices are NOT listed on the womens' menus. Cute, right? Clearly an old-school/old-fashioned practice and I like it. Alot.

Everyone unanimously agreed that this would be our cheat meal, (especially considering that I have a photoshoot coming up in 10 days, so this really was the ""last supper"" for me, ha.)

I can't remember it all (food coma) but here is some of what our table ordered:

2 bottles of cabernet

Appetizers
-Caesar salad (prepared table side)
-French onion soup
-Shrimp diablo (Favorite)

Entrees
-Dover sole (Favorite, multiple people ordered this dish)
-Seabass
-Filet mignon

Sides
-Potatoes au gratin
-Green beans (Favorite)
-Asparagus with hollandaise sauce

Dessert
-Bananas foster (prepared table side)
-Cheesecake

The chef also sent out, complimentary, 2 platters of chocolate dipped strawberries and a giant fruit bowl filled with fresh fruit.

If you ever get the chance, eat here. It's in the Barbary Coast (of all places!) but don't let that fool you. 

The service is amazing. The food is amazing. Right now, I literally can not think of another word to describe this place. 

It is probably the best restaurant I've ever eaten at. I know that it's really expensive. But I wouldn't know exactly how expensive. Because when they give you the menus, the women's menus don't have prices on them. I know. It sounds so old-school and sexist. But I'm actually really glad I don't know. 

The service is impeccable. The setting is small and intimate. And the food. The food is to be savored. Each and every bite.

Dinner is an event. It takes several hours. Last I checked, they only took reservations at 2 times in the evening... I think it was 6pm and 9pm or something like that, anyway. And you MUST make a reservation. 

It's totally worth every single penny you spend here.

2012503,2014-01-07,5,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"This was probably the most expensive meal I've ever had. At the very least, it was definitely the most expensive meal I've ever paid for. But it was so totally worth every penny.

This place is totally hidden inside the South Point casino. And I never would have guessed that a place like this would exist in the South Point. Don't look for any signs telling you where it is. You just have to look for the unique door. And oh what a gem it is!

We had a reservation, but arrived early and had no problems being seated early. In fact, it's a rather small, intimate space, and we were one of maybe 5 or so parties in the entire restaurant.

It's totally old school. It's the type of place you've read about, but never actually seen. It's all red, plush, and vintage.

Upon being seated, James O. was actually directed to sit next to me, instead of across from me. They definitely cater to the romantic night out.

We were not given menus right away. Instead, our drinks orders were taken. (There is no drink menu, but the waitstaff will tell you what they have.) Then bread and veggies (complimentary) were brought to us. And our water glasses were filled. We talked and munched and took in the space. And then we were given menus. I really enjoyed this approach.

The menus were unique for each person. James O. got the menu with the prices. I got the menu sans prices. While possibly sexist (especially since I was the one paying for this dinner), I found it a classy move. And frankly, I'm glad I didn't see the prices. I just might have freaked out and insisted on us sharing everything and not ordering all that we did. But then I would have missed out big time...

We were attended to by at least three waitstaff. One who was the head and a couple of assistants. Our glasses were never close to empty and anything we wanted was predicted before we could even ask. Very classy, old school service. A total indulgence!

We started with the caesar salad and french onion soup. The caesar salad was made tableside. Dressing and all was created right before our eyes. And it was a seriously fantastic salad. Even though James O. ordered the soup, they also brought me a spoon (note that they didn't bring him an extra fork like they did me for the salad - again, classy and able to predict what we wanted before we could voice it). The french onion soup was oh so incredibly divine! I literally let out a sigh as it dripped down my throat. So that's was french onion soup is actually supposed to taste like! Don't miss out - order this soup!

For entrees, I had the special of the night, a bone-in filet mignon with mushroom sauce. James O. opted for the standard, on the menu, filet mignon (which automatically came with bernaise sauce). We also ordered the asparagus with hollandaise as a side. The steaks were partially prepared tableside, which was awesome. A love a live dinner show! And OMG the steaks were mouthwatering fab! Easily one of the best steaks I've ever had! (Even reheated the next night, it was yummy.) The asparagus was huge (I usually prefer the thinner stalks), but cooked to perfection and quite good. We ate slowly and uninterrupted. A fabulous, romantic meal that was completely delicious to boot!

While we had to take half of our steaks to-go, we couldn't resist ordering dessert. We opted for the bananas foster (since again, I love a good tableside dinner show). And again, it was fabulous and exceeded expectations. I'm not even a big fan of bananas and I loved it. And then they brought out complimentary fruit (a HUGE bowl of it) and plate of chocolate-covered fruit. I don't think I've ever seen grapes that large. And the chocolate-covered fruit was perfection.

From beginning to end, this was a fabulously perfect and romantic meal. We enjoyed and loved every minute of it. Sure, it's pricey. But you definitely get what you pay for. If you're looking for a wow meal, look no further. This is the type of restaurant that really conveys that classy, old school, Vegas-feel - especially in terms of service.

2032838,2012-10-24,1,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"(Warning:  Many of the 5 star positive reviews for this restaurant on Yelp are phoney.  Either from employees, family or management.)   Two words: Rip Off.  Stay away.  We went to Michael's as a party of four people.  The ambiance was good (but a little cheesy with all the red crushed velvet).  Service was good.  However, the food was mediocre and way overpriced.  When I say overpriced, I mean way overpriced to a point of being ridicules for the quality of the food.  Here is what we paid, and what it should have cost compared to some of the top restaurants we have been to, including Gordon Ramsay Steak House, Cuts Steakhouse, Delmonico Steakhouse, and others (""the other places""):

We started with cocktails.  Two of us had a Cosmopolitan, which normally is between $10.00 and $12.00 at the other places.  At Michael's, each Cosmopolitan was $25.00!  Times two that was $50.00 for cocktails.  The other two people had water and were in a state of shock.

Here is an example the cost of our appetizers and main courses.  One Veal Piccata, normally $32.00 other place, was $72.00.  Yes, that's right: $72.00 for a few slices of veal in lemon caper sauce.  A rib eye steak, normally $56.00 at other places, was a whopping $70.00 at Michael's.  A Sea Bass dish, normally $40.00 other places, was $58.00.  A Caesar's Salad, normally $16.00 at the other places, was $25.00 per person. A Scottish Salmon appetizer (which tasted like it was from Costco and frozen), normally $12.00 to $15.00 at the other places, was $25.00.   For dessert, a scoop of vanilla ice cream with some berries on top, normally $14.00 at the other places, at Michael's it was $25.00.  Was the food that much better?  No.  In fact, it was much worse than the other places.  The rib eye steak was plated to make it look unappealing. It was very fatty on the edges, not well marbled, and I'm sure it was not a prime cut of beef.

Why anyone would go to this restaurant is beyond comprehension, especially when there are so many great restaurants in Las Vegas that are much more superior and less expensive.  Do not go to this place and save your money for other things.  We will never go back to the South Point Hotel because of this experience.",pnUtRhBIXW3dCMqwtditng,5,0,1,GMCjPHTPL3aEQn5RRJ88og

2122361,2014-04-19,10,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"First, I would like to address the 1 star reviews you see. Notice how everyone in the review is complaining about 1 of 3 things:
1. ""It's old"" yes! It's old!! The f-ing rat pack and many other old,glamorous people ate here. It's old Vegas. It has history. Grow the F up. Not everything is going to be new and be laced with ""truffle oil"" or Panko bread crumbed or be a fancy burger. 
2. It's expensive-get your money up. Seriously. It's about an experience. If you don't want an experience and you want to tell all your friends about how you ate at ""that guy on TV""s restaurant, then do so elsewhere! Stay on the strip. Be typical. 
3. It has a dress code- sorry you can't wear your flip flops, board shorts, trucker hat, or whatever other crap our ""lazy ass dressed down"" society wears everywhere else. Again, it's time to grow the F up. Other people don't care that you can pay for the food. They don't want to sit next to you and see your crusty feet or stare at your disheveled mop. 

I am not old. I am not rich. I was raised to enjoy places like this and not take them for granted. 

That being said, I liked it. 

I like that they give the lady the menu without prices. I like that they bring you a pickle plate with crackers. I like that they cleanse your palette for the meal with a lemon sorbet w/ some Dom poured over. I like finger bowls after a meal. I like having my water cup filled after every sip. I like my food brought out to me like a show. I like complimentary chocolate covered fruit and a fruit bowl. I like knowing that I could take my time with all of the above and not be rushed out the door like the herd at Outback. 

We had:
2 Vodka drinks
Shared a very large crab cake
The lamb chops
The lobster
Baked potato
Creamed corn
Coffee
Michael's Banana Strawberry Cake
$355

The only thing I would do different:
Order 1 entree to share(they are large) and skip dessert(unless u can share w/ like 4 other people). They are good but huge and the complimentary fruits and petite four at the end are perfect. 

So ignore the trendies w/ the 1 star reviews. Go experience it at least once for yourself.",f1cKpQLE4jfn0Rt5HV9vVw,22,9,4,ejjlPPGr_lOikk6hclZCsw
2140454,2017-01-21,4,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"Given all of the amazing reviews for Michael's Gourmet Room, I had extremely high hopes for my experience here, but was unfortunately left just a smidge disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it's a stellar restaurant (given the price point, it just ought to be), the service is fantastic, and I loved all of the small touches, but the food itself just didn't wow me.. Le sigh..

Let's start at the beginning, shall we? Entering the restaurant, you are transported to Old Las Vegas. Dark woods, red velvet abound. The booths are lovely and cozy, perfect for a romantic dinner. The host pulls the table out so you can slide in without looking too awkward. You're poured bottled water (you have no choice, drink the water), and a few baskets of fancy crackers are on the table. (I'd rather have warm bread, but oh well). There is no cocktail menu, so you'd better know what you want to drink beforehand. My lemon drop (it's the only sweet cocktail I could think of on the spot!) was well prepared, and our server continued to top it off from the little container of excess nearby.

You're first presented with a tray of pickled veggies, which were very nice, then your menus. The menu for the ladies didn't have prices listed- very old school! I ordered the Maryland lump crab cake to start. It was full of meat, and there was some filler, but it was not an overwhelming amount. However, it wasn't very seasoned. Where's the Old Bay when you need it? I found myself having to rely on the tarter sauce too much.  The stone crabs were nice and meaty, and the mustard sauce a good accompaniment to them.

My main course, the sea bass, was also tasty, melted in my mouth, but underseasoned. I'm sensing a trend... the tomato with breadcrumbs on the plate was pretty, yet unnecessary. The creamed spinach as a side dish- you guessed it. Underseasoned. I enjoyed that it came with mushrooms, though. I tasted the steak- I don't care for well done steaks, so it wasn't my preference, but it also could have used more flavor.

The desserts were the star of the show! The tiramisu was delicious, as was the creme brûlée. They also bring out a rather large fruit basket (display?) along with chocolate covered fruits, even if you don't order dessert.

So... all in all, I'm not entirely disappointed, and it was a lovely experience. The servers were professional and made sure we wanted for nothing, but they need to be a bit more liberal on the seasonings before I'm inclined to return.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,7,2,3,ylL2cAK11QcLNkE8zF-jRw

2183087,2011-01-21,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"I have got to set the record straight.  All of these posts that are more than a few years old are ridiculously inaccurate. Michael's (named after the owner of the South Point hotel and casino) was moved to the hotel only after Mr. Gaughn bought out the South Point from the Coast casino properties.  That's right, it used to be South Coast casino.  And,Michael's used to be at the Barbary coast casino, until Mr. Gaughn moved it to the new South Point (as he retained the rights to his restaurant when he sold off his interest in coast casinos, and outright bought the south point (formerly South Coast).  Since the South point was less than a couple years old when this occurred, it is impossible that the restaurant ""has not been updated since the 70's"".  In fact, Mr Gaughn paid a considerable amount of money to move a load bearing column because he didn't like the appearance of the restaurant with the column where it was.  This restaurant flies in fresh items (for example the Dover sole), and has impeccable service right down to the bathroom attendants. With the new location, the absolute attention to detail, the finest quality food, and a professional serving staff, I can see no reason that this restaurant could ever be rated as less than the best dining experience one can find in Vegas.",3s3WjlGettH4yOwTyX9k3A,2,1,5,EuA04KSV-O1KLRZJwb7icw
2186911,2017-07-14,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"This is a 5 star experience if I've ever had one!  

We received a recommendation for this and I have to say that I was a little skeptical given the location.  It was well worth the drive from the strip though.  It wasn't well marked in the casino, so we asked for directions.  It's not far off the main entrance and it's towards the bowling alley.  When you first walk up, the beautiful door is an indication of what waits inside.  

The service was top notch from the time we walked in through the end of dinner.  The décor is beautiful and our waiter, Vincent, explained the history of the restaurant. 

The food just keeps coming and coming here!  Make sure you arrive hungry!  

A vegetable tray and breads were the first to arrive.  We then got our appetizers of French onion soup and crab claws.  I'd recommend both, but I loved the presentation of the crab and how much crab meat there was!  

We both got steak for dinner and shared the au gratin potatoes.  Very good, but we brought some home for leftovers as it was just all too much.  

We got the amazing strawberry shortcake for dessert and were shocked when they brought chocolate covered fruit and a fruit bowl after that.  Ommigosh...does the food ever stop?!  So good though!  

My only suggestion would be a cocktail menu.  They have a full bar, but not a cocktail menu and I need some inspiration.  We ordered a bottle of wine that was pretty inexpensive considering how upscale this place is.  

Loved, loved, loved!  Definitely an experience to be savored!",wLGfVCgOdNKzJ3TGTzlvLQ,3,1,5,5J6ERNzex4smmhuvI4eeKw
2193703,2013-06-23,4,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"I came here quite some time ago, alone. The service (for me) was ok, sometimes uncomfortable which I will explain later. When I was seated, the waiter brought over a vegetable platter that was huge. I liked it and felt that it was great, but certainly too big for a lone diner. I imagine they recycle these things from table to table, which makes me question how many hands have touched the items in the platter. 

I ordered an appetizer, a filet, and a side. I also had a dessert. The food was amazing and I cannot complain about it. I also ordered a small bottle of Duckhorn, and it was exceptional. The one star I have given them is not for the food or the cost, but rather what I witnessed which will make sense as you read on. 

My bill was hefty. It was over $200.00 for one person. I think the wine, and the other items added up. Was it worth $200.00? I would say no. The food is good, but definitely not at that price. Some of the nicest steakhouses would cost that much (with wine) for two people, but for one- I feel it was a bit inflated. I assume they try to make up for that by the large veggie platter and post- dinner fruit platter  (its not a platter you get to keep if you do not finish, but instead more of the recycled type platter I explained above). 

Lastly, there was one thing that made me slightly uncomfortable. As I was seated, another woman came in after me (who was alone) . They gave her a menu and she already knew which drink she wanted to order. What I overheard (because there were not many diners and she was directly to my right) was the waiter telling her that she could not order a salad/ or side and an appetizer at the restaurant, and that she had to order a meal off the dinner entrees. She was confused and stated that she did not want that much food but really enjoyed those items. Well, they refused to serve her. She asked if it was because they wanted her to order a more expensive item. The waiter then started treating her pretty poorly by telling her she could not dine there if she did not order an entree. She asked for the check for her drink. It was pretty sad because restaurants are in the business of service and excellent customer service. I was sad to see her be turned away. She also then stated to the waiter ""that is why your restaurant is empty, due to your customer service."" 

I had never felt more awkward or uncomfortable in a restaurant. What made it even worse is after she paid for her drink and left, the waiter realized that I must have heard everything due to my proximity and he then began explaining himself and stated ""the restaurant was busy earlier and not empty as she had stated, and she was just being cheap."" I was silent, remained silent, and was just shocked that this even happened.  This would be the reason I would not return. 

Sometimes people only want a light meal due to dietary restrictions, or maybe whatever other reason that they are entitled to, so to be denied service is something this woman will remember forever, and it was very sad. I should have left as well, but I did not think or act quickly enough because I was shocked. I regret that and if I could go back in time, I would have asked her to join my table, and then maybe it would have been ""permitted"" for her to order whatever she wanted since I had already ordered an entree. 

Needless to say, I won't return, but I am prepared to better-handle a situation like this if it ever happens again. I would respectfully suggest that the restaurant reconsider their policy (which I never saw noted on the menu) because people that come in are there because they enjoy your food. They should be respected and treated kindly, not denied service because you have deemed the bill will not be ""high enough"" or worth serving them. This does not happen in the finest restaurants I can think of, so it should not be happening in yours. I can only in good faith give you one star as a result of how you treated this woman who was there to enjoy your service, your restaurant, and you left her feeling very bad (along with me).",B5_2UTDPG7nRionQsiUXGA,35,5,1,Its9qN2EhLlotQqS77N-Tg

Why else would you pay the equivalent of a mortgage payment for one dinner? I'm exaggerating but not that much.

I have to say they have this place soundproofed extremely well.  Once the front door closes, you no longer feel like you are in a semi-smoky casino nor can you hear the jing-janging of the slot machines.  There is soft piano music playing on the sound system and you really feel like you are away from it all, in a quiet, ultra-classy restaurant.  No thumping Katy Perry music here.

The service, like during our last visit, was perfect.  Our waiter wasn't quite as personable as the one we had years ago but he was on top of everything at all times, answered all of our questions about the menu, and offered helpful suggestions. Also, his team of assistants and bus staff were excellent.

We ordered some of the same items we loved the last time:  the crab cake (easily big enough for two to split and it's wonderful), the Caesar salad (again, easily shareable for two people, made tableside, delicious), and the Dover sole (melt in your mouth wonderful).  This time, I went with the veal saltimbocca with proscuitto on top and it was very good but not otherwordly.

The cocktails are incredible here but be forewarned:  they are huge and probably equal to two drinks anywhere else.  The wine selection is excellent, too, but we only did wines by the glass.

You get complimentary chocolate covered fruits and mints at the end of your meal and also the gigantic, magnificent fruit bowl which no one in the history of time has ever sampled, as far as I can tell.  I am not sure anyone really needs to order dessert here, with the freebies and the massive amounts of food, but the dessert cart does look wonderful.

This restaurant is very, very expensive but keep in mind that you are paying for perfect service, along with excellent food.  It may be five more years until I return but I would miss this place if it were gone.",bURBDO2lgSrxnth2P7v3Gw,2,2,5,mCJu_M4yW8vw721RErSjdQ

WOW- we were wrong! Over the years we have kept coming back, even though it's now at the South Point a little bit away from the strip. It's truly a gem. It's very expensive but the service is hands down the best service I've ever had in my life. The food is great and each time we return it's the same servers - who I'm sure make a pretty penny working there.

2497483,2012-06-14,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"My experience at Michael's was truly fabulous. So wonderful that I have no other choice than to give it 5 stars. I read some of the reviews that were less than 5 stars because I was curious as to what could make anyone think poorly of this place. Most of the complaints were about the pricing, which in no way affects my review. I was with a large party (9 guests). I didn't pay the bill and this place is so old school that ladies are given menus with no prices. How much fun is that? As a truly thrifty and informed consumer, had I been aware of the price of anything I may have made different dining decisions and/or had a different experience. Having said that...

Wow! I don't know if I have received better service anywhere, ever. My water glass was never less than half full throughout the entire meal. They were prompt, courteous and made sure everything was perfect for our party. 

I ate the sea bass and the salmon (split with another guest) and both were phenomenal. They were both plated pretty much the same way including a whole tomato topped with a breadcrumb mixture and a decorative lemon. The only difference being the toppings. The sea bass was topped with an abundance of fresh leeks and a little dill in a butter sauce and the salmon was topped with marinated cucumbers. The sea bass was buttery and I thought it might melt on my tongue. The salmon was moist and flavorful, a winning combination. 

The only things I tried that were a bit mediocre were the green beans and William J's Salad. The ""Imported French Beans, Almondine"" were just waxy green beans with some chopped almonds sprinkled on top. Opt instead for the asparagus, baby carrots or creamed corn. All of which I would order again. The salad was underwhelming at best. The portion was large enough to share but I would skip it all together. It was mostly lettuce and slightly bland. Opt instead for the Cream of Fresh Tomatoes Soup which was one of the best I have ever tried.

I tried every dessert. Yep, every single one. The best was the Peach Melba and it was wonderful. I had to pass it on, as we all sampled a bite of everything. But if I could've kept just one in front of me, it would have been the peach melba hands down. The Cherries Jubilee, Key Lime and Cheese Cake were all better than the Bananas Foster. And the Bananas Foster was pretty freakin' good if that gives you any indication of how yummy my night was.",u9w4LOoKYsM00Scb0HCH1w,4,4,5,MZM92rJVYBJfkdWVF4A8tw

This is the kind of truly old school place I can picture he & his buddies tearing up the town back in the old days. 

Again, surprised to find it located in the Southpoint, a place we only visit to dine here. Over the years, we've lamented the loss of William B's in the Stardust which had a similar feel. I've only docked it a star as I feel the decor could be bumped up a bit...feels a little worn for a newer spot. 

Some of the servers must have been here forever, as they remember my Uncle Chick on sight (particularly the Captain) you'll have 4-6 or more serving you depending on number in your party and from waters being filled, wine/champagne. selection being varied and spot on to (I'm told) delicious breads = damned carbs!

Standouts are classics, too: the tableside Caesar Salad is on point, their sea bass, salmon and various seafood delicacies always keep me superbly sated. Of course steaks of several varieties (and prep as Daddy INSISTS on well done) along with expertly prepared steakhouse sides round out an enjoyable and never rushed dining experience. Even though gratis chocolate coverered strawberries and fresh fruit are graciously offered, I always save room (and take leftovers) to enjoy tableside prepared Bananas Foster = a favorite treat. The ""show"" factor of this preparation rivals my beloved Hugo's Cellar.

We expressed upon being checked in upon by our service staff that we were not satisfied with the rack of lamb.  The Maitre D' ( José Martel) came by and we confirmed with him our dissatisfaction.  To our surprise, when we received our bill we were still charged for the rack of lamb.  We asked for the Maitre D and Mr Jose Martel came back to our table and said that he refused to take the Rack of Lamb off the bill.  ( we ate 1 lamb chop) When we pressed the issue, Mr. Jose Martel became noticeably upset and expressed to us that he would only remove the Lamb if we agreed to never return as customers of Michael's at South Point ever again.  Needless to say, we were beyond appalled by Mr. Jose Martel's remarks and lack of professionalism.

From the time we walked in the door we felt like the most important people in the room.  We had a nice Cabernet from the Stags leap winery that was delicious.  We started with a crab cake.  This crab cake was so large that even split in 2 it was larger than the average crab cake.  The crab was impeccable and had a minimal amount of filler.  We were thrilled with the crab cake.  I had the French Onion soup which was simply wonderful.  The broth was so rich and soothing with just the right amount of browned bubbly mozzarella cheese on top.  I ordered the twin Lamb Chops medium rare.  This lamb was so good it is hard to describe.  It was charred beautifully on the outside and was bloody and delicious in the center.  It was served with a mint jelly in a wonderfully decorated pear and accompanied by a flower and  a stuffed tomato.  My wife had the bone in filet and It came with a béarnaise sauce that was excellent.  We had the potatoes au gratin and the asparagus as our accompaniments and they were prepared perfectly.  We were both stuffed but we decided to have the fresh berries over ice cream and flambeed with cherry liquor.  This was decadently awesome and we were almost able to eat the whole thing.  That was when the waiter showed up with a fruit bowl that was impeccable and a platter of chocolate muses such as strawberries, apple, apricot and other chocolate delights! These were compliments of the chef.  We were so full that we could not eat another bite and so they packed up the chocolates so that we could that them with us.

Another free item was the palate cleanser of lemon sorbet and Dom Perignon champagne  and then an after dinner dessert plate of dark and white chocolate dipped fruit.  Many of the courses were prepared table side--which one does not see often any more--the table side preparation seems to enhance the dinning experience (in my opinion).  The escargot appetizer was prepared classically and was great.  The spinach salad with hot bacon dressing was excellent and I also had the lamb chops--very delicious.

3400214,2014-07-21,4,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"Many things about Michael's are lovely. Like the marble-floored entrance, the big, comfortable wing backed chairs, and the O.G.red walls with low lighting. I'm a sucker for that stuff.

Other nice touches are the absent prices on the ladies' menus, the champagne and sorbet palate cleanser, and the salad making and dessert flambe'-ing performed tableside by waiters dressed much better than the clientele. 

Dishes we loved were: the French onion soup, crab cake made with actual lump crab, authentic Caesar salad, and giant lobster carried out and presented on a silver platter that would have seated 3 children comfortably.

Not so much: the veal was pretty mediocre, and the breading on the Francese was soggy and falling off. The scampi came with no pasta, and the Coquilles St. Jacques was not gratineed to a nice golden crust; rather the scallops were just plopped into a kind of gloppy cream sauce with mushrooms and a ring of what we hope were mashed potatoes around the rim. Nope.

Martinis were served with the extra in glass pitchers; a nice touch if you like martinis.
I prefer an icy cold Diet Coke myself, but they only had Pepsi products, and they were in bottles. Uh-oh, you know what that means. No free refills. I know this isn't a place you go when you're looking to stretch a dollar, but they were making an enemy of me, which isn't easy to do when you happen to be the proud possessors of a three story dessert cart. They kind of made up for it with the little tray of complimentary chocolate-dipped fruit, but who did they think they were kidding with that fruit basket? You might get a few die-hards nibbling on the grapes or cherries, but does anyone finish a five course meal and find their mouth watering at the sight of a big raw apple?! Talk about anti-climactic.

Anyway, bottom line: Michael's has great old-school ambience and wonderful service. Some of the food is quite good, but when you are dropping close to $200 per person before tip, it needs to be great. All of it.",-qj9ouN0bzMXz1vfEslG-A,10,2,3,Ryeknhu1tpXqhjbOWvBbPg

3577039,2016-05-05,1,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"One thing you will notice in the many Yelp reviews of this place is that some people, myself included, make mention of the price.  Be aware that many studies have shown that diners from a group that paid $100 for a meal will rate it as tasting better than another group of diners that only paid $50 for the same meal. 

The service, from the moment you walk in the door, is impeccable.  My fiancee and I had a reservation and were seated immediately.  The restaurant has a red decor and has fewer than 20 tables, although there's lots of space between tables so it's not too tiny.  There's a bar up front as well.  

They pull out and actually rotate the table for you if you are sitting in a booth, which is a nice touch.  The ""bread"", such as it is, is already on the table.  Actually it's a loaf-of-bread sized amount of water biscuits (crackers).  Also on the table is a single rose in a small vase, salt, pepper, and paprika.  Shortly after being seated the waiter came over to introduce himself and then let his assistants take over with other things.  

At most steakhouses I've been to they give you the option of bottled water or ""house water"" (read: tap water), the former of which is not free.  At Michael's there is no option: you will receive bottled water.  My fiancee also ordered a drink from the bar and it was made for her at the table and then the extra bit of it that was not able to fit in the glass was left for later (which a waiter's assistant came over to pour when he noticed her glass getting empty).  

Anyway, we were served the crudites plate which has mostly veggies and the oft-mentioned hard boiled quail eggs.  I am not a big veggie person but liked the pickles.  My fiancee liked the dip and cauliflower.  Also another basket arrived with crunchy pumpernickel slices that had a bit of cheese on top (the cheese was also crunchy), along with a tray of butter.  I'm a bit put off that, at no time did we ever actually get any real bread.  

As others have mentioned, when you get the menus, they will give a menu without prices to females and the menu with prices to males.  I think this is a little silly, but I'm not going to start picketing outside the restaurant or anything.  The menu is actually fairly short and there wasn't a very long specials list either.  We ended up ordering two french onion soups, two filet mignons, and sides of au gratin potatoes (one of the specials) and broccoli with drawn butter.  No wine list was ever given to us, but my fiancee was able to order a glass of wine.  At one point I got up to check on something in the casino and when I sat back down my napkin and utensils had been replaced.

The soup arrived very quickly.  It was quite good.  The quality of the cheese is excellent and it's not too salty.  We were given a palate cleanser of sorbet and Dom Perignon champagne, which is a nice touch.  After a while our entree and sides arrived.  The waiter along with two assistants served it to us, and the steaks were actually finished tableside.  The waiters, as they put the food on the table, actually put Bearnaise sauce and some of the sides on your plate in addition to leaving the side dishes there.  

The quality of the ingredients is amazing, but the seasoning leaves something to be desired.  My fiancee did not really care for the broccoli, even though she normally loves it.  I thought the au gratin potatoes were pretty good.  The steaks were massive -- probably the largest filets I've ever had -- but spiced very plainly.  Mine was actually a tad under cooked too, but I'm OK with that.

Per other reviewers recommendations we skipped desert and just had the complimentary chocolate covered fruits and fruit basket.  Definitely a good choice.  The fruits are all very good and more than enough for 2 people.  The check was taken care of very quickly and we were in and out in about 90 minutes.

Now, onto the prices and comparison to other places.  No prices on drinks from the bar or wine, but a vodka soda was $21(!) and a glass of wine was $16.  The filets are either $72 or $82 depending on if you get the small or large.  A bit overpriced, but more than that the taste was nothing spectacular.  I'd much rather have the taste of the $36 filet at Twin Creeks at Silverton just 2 miles down the road, even though it's probably only 75% as large.  The sides are somewhat reasonably priced, $13 for the broccoli and $17 for the au gratin potatoes, but again we'd rather have other sides from other places that happen to be cheaper.  No real bread is a major whiff by Michael's.  

In all, with tax and tip it was $345 and honestly I'd rather go to SIlverado Steak House (also South Point) which would be half this price and is actually better in my opinion.  What you are paying for is not the food but the service & the little touches here and there (Dom, crudites, free fruit bowl and chocolate covered fruit).  On the edge between 3 & 4 stars here, but will go with 4 because it's worth checking out once.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,6,2,4,nVIW0hUBmH-Z5F-CPjnH_w

As soon as we sat down and had 5 waiters surrounding us, bringing out food and bottled water, I was instantly transported to another place...

I went straight for the ceasar salad (prepared table-side), and the Chateaubriand (serves 2).  There is no arguing that this is the best meal I've ever had.  Period.  I could cut the filet with a fork, and they even make plain old vegetables taste amazing.  The chef is clearly a master at pairing flavors together, as the sauces that came with the Chateaubriand perfectly melded everything together.

The service is truly 5 star... I've never had better service.  The steak was absolutely perfect, and I also sampled the Sea Bass, as well as the Scampi.  Both of those dishes were amazing as well (especially the Sea bass... magnificent).

Safe to say this is probably the best restaurant in Vegas, despite the fact that its located in the South Point casino of all places.  Don't be fooled by the haters, this place is old school and real deal.

Pro-tip:  Order a dessert (cherries jubilee, or perhaps the bananas foster) if you want a real show table-side. Save this place for a special occasion, because I doubt you'll have a better combination of food/service.",dgLwz5aoZSvh6ys4AcgcFA,0,1,5,SFZUB5UNAtD7puVI8Yu3pw

3907087,2016-03-26,3,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"What an elegant and romantic evening I had with my wife last weekend. I've been so busy I haven't had time to write this review, but it's still been on my mind since the night we dined there.  I was looking for an upscale restaurant to take my wife to, because we hadn't been able to go out much since our second child was born.  So this was a real delicassey.  Five star service from start to finish.

In the beginning you are welcomed with a tray of fancy appetizers of cheese, broccoli, tomatoes and hard boiled quail eggs.  All made of the freshest crops and picks.  Our main appetizer was the lobster with cocktail sauce and it just was awesome!  Generous lobster meat portions and of course went very well with a generous serving of a pomegranate martini.

Main entree consisted of Filet Mignon that I shared with my wife and it was actually a decent size portion.  For the side I ordered green bean almondine, which hardly any restaurants have anymore.  Our main server looked like Jeff Bridges and had a great sense of humor.  For the people on here who complained about the price, I say this to you: If you can't play the game with the big boys and can't afford it, then stick to Applebee's.  This place is for the people who can truly enjoy fine dining at its best.

They only minor critic one can give the waitstaff is they fill your glass about 95% full of water when it should only be filled 67%. The Maryland lump crab cocktail appetizer and the Coquille St. Jacques were both excellent and huge. I had the Dover sole which was only good not excellent.  My wife had the Veal Saltimbocca which was exceptional.  We received a complimentary piece of cake for our anniversary which was a nice touch.  I have to remove a star though because of the value.  While the food is good to great all items seem to be at least 30% higher then they should be even considering the quality.  Maybe, maybe if this was in the Wynn or Bellagio would the prices seem fair.

4170462,2013-05-27,3,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"Everything in Vegas is an imitation of something from somewhere else. Famous restaurants in NYC, LA, Chicago, Yountville, all open outposts in Vegas. So when I discovered a true Vegas restaurant that is one of a kind, it was like travelling back in time. 

Michael's is THAT kind of a restaurant. 

It is truly unique and authentic Vegas experience, the traditional, classy, old school Vegas. When the mobs used to run the town. When public nudity was frowned upon. When a magical oasis sprung up in the middle of a dessert and drew people from all over in. 

Don't let the off-putting South Point Casino (and rodeo boys) deter you from visiting. The fact that it is in an unsuspecting corner of a kitschy casino - apparently they literally moved it from the old spot into this new spot - makes it even more fascinating. 

The meal was enough to feed a village. My tip? Basically skip lunch for the sake of dinner. Trust me. Also allot at least 3 hours for dinner. After all the courses, it's essentially a French dining experience.  

Everyone's meal started with a massive pickled plate of beets, carrots, cucumbers and assorted pickles. We ordered fresh stone crab appetizers on a decadent ice bowl, with a bib I could not refuse. The table-side Caeser salad was so involved it required two people. The dressing was maybe the best garlic to lemon ratio I've ever had. The Michael J's salad had avocados and similar ingredients, and was equally refreshing. 

In the middle of our meal came a palate cleansing lemon sorbet with Dom Perignon with the perfect little bit of lemon rinds. Some other unique details of the service include the almost kitschy massive wine glasses with golden letters ""Michael's restaurant"" on the side and the beer that was put on an ice bucket the way one would serve champagne. 

As for entrees, the Chateaubriand for two just blew me away. The cut was unbelievably tender, and both bearnaise and hollandaise sauce decorated the plate. Asparagus, baked tomatoes, broccoli and carrots were perfectly pan-cooked, again with table-side service. 

At this point I may have loosened the buttons on my pants. 

Due to time constraints, we had to skip the key lime pie (flown in fresh every day from Key West) and plethora of cheesecakes. In its place was a complimentary dessert plate of chocolate and white chocolate dipped strawberries, petite fours, chocolate covered kiwis, bananas and pineapples.

There is no doubt I will go back to Michael's every time I visit Vegas. It's a pilgrimage, no, a right of passage, an homage to the history of the city. And if you don't want to get too philosophical, it's really just a really superb meal.",8Ho76SmTaoPGN1yvaBNrtg,11,5,5,RBRXFzSxUNnI8I5EZI-tDA

First and foremost, it is not ""trendy"". There are no fries covered with toppings, there is no Pork Belly glazed with Maple or God knows what. 
There is however some of the freshest fish, best beef and salads anywhere along with outstanding service. 
It is very old school and the Waiters are the best we have seen. 
Dinner here starts with a wonderful Garnish tray that among other things include Quail Eggs, Olives, Pickles, Cucumbers and Beats. They also give you toasted Dark Bread with Parmesan cheese, and crackers, etc.
On this particular visit, I ordered the Live Maine Lobster. This thing was a Monster, huge. Cooked to perfection, I selected broiled. They dress the Lobster table side. 
I also had the French Onion soup, the best I've ever had. 
The sides were Cream Corn and a Baked Potato. 
I could go on and on, but one must try this place, you will love it.

4260268,2011-07-02,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"I have been coming to Michael's with my parents since I was a small child. It was always a special event, usually while on a weekend trip in from Southern California. Back then, Michael's was located at the Barbary Coast Hotel, which closed back in early 2007. The old Barbary Coast is now the obnoxious Bill's Gamblin Hall and Saloon. So when Bill's came in, Michael's left. They then relocated to the South Point Hotel and Casino, further south on the Strip. (The old owner of the Barbary owned the South Point too). In truth,  I was anxious to hear that they were moving to a new location at the South Point. I was happy it was still going to be around, but secretly worried that they would not be able to maintain or recreate the old school Vegas feeling and ambiance they had when it was located inside the Barbary. 

I was proven wrong. If you read reviews on here that bash the way that Michael's looks, stuff like...""It hasn't been updated since the 1970s,"" blah blah....um, excuse me...it's like that on PURPOSE.  When it was moved from the old location, pretty much everything, and I mean, EVERYTHING was carefully placed to mimic the way it looked for all those decades at the old Barbary Coast. Right down to the beautiful glass dome in the middle of the restaurant and the front door. The whole idea of Michael's is to transform you back to a time when dining out in Vegas was an event. Here, the Ladies do not receive a menu with prices on it. Only the Gentlemen do. This is the type of meal where there are so many rich, savory taste experiences, you have a champagne sherbet in between courses to cleanse your palette. And don't forget the fruit bowl, chocolate, and fruit petit fours that come after the meal, along with multicolored sugar crystals for your after dinner coffee or tea. Excited yet?

 Michaels has all that and more. The best, largest, juiciest filet you will ever eat. If you love seafood, the Florida stone crab is flown in daily and NOT to be missed. The claws are gigantic.  The Sea Bass is perfection. I also love the spinach salad they prepare for you table side, complete with hot bacon and vinaigrette dressing. And please don't forget dessert. My mom and I swoon over the Cherries Jubilee every time. But if cherries are not your thing, you can pick something like Bananas Foster or one of 10 or so fresh mouthwatering desserts from the pastry cart. 
The service is top notch. Your captain and Maitre d will wait on you hand and foot,  (without being pushy or overbearing) and make you feel like family. And that's exactly how my family feels about Russell and Jose, who work there.They are family. So much so, that my husband and I celebrated our small wedding night dinner here with my parents last December. 
Expect to be there for at least three hours. And as some other reviewers unfortunately found out after it was too late, it is semi dressy/dressier. So yes, guys, put on a jacket, ok? It's one night, so suck it up. Like I said, it is not dinner, it is an event. And one definitely not to be missed. 
It is pricey. Know that going in. But you could spend the same or even more on the Strip and not even come close to this experience. You can go to a five star, elegant steak house at the Palms, or the Palazzo, or Mandalay, or even the Wynn. But I can guarantee that these trendier places won't pamper you the way that Michael's does. Those places are into kissing the asses of say, celebs,  and other bigwigs. At Michael's, you don't technically have to be a bigshot to be made to feel like one.

4265409,2014-01-16,5,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"Never again!  Let me start by saying we have loved this restaurant since it was in Barbary coast.  We are locals in Las Vegas and considered it one of our favorite restaurants.
Last weekend, we took two of our best friends who were visiting from out of town to eat at Michaels.  We were excited to have them join us.  We were immediately seated when we got there and had been sitting down for about 5 minutes when the maître d' came to our friend from holland and told him to stop staring at the girl with her boyfriend/husband who was sitting behind us.  First of all, there were two couples sitting behind us and we didn't know which one he was even talking about.  Secondly, we were just stunned!  Our friend was so embarrassed and didn't know what to do much less which girl he was taking about.  We considered leaving but decided to just ignore it and have a good time.
In the meantime, the head waiter kept ignoring us and running over to the table with this couple as if we had done something wrong.
We were so embarrassed and frankly shocked we didn't know what to say.  
Let me say we were dressed nicely, are regulars in this restaurant, and between the 4 of us spent about $875.  We were not drinking too much and were not rowdy or being a problem at all.
Michaels needs to understand we have tons of other really nice restaurants to choose from and we will not rest until our friend gets a formal apology from the owner and staff.  We've talked to some other restaurant owners we know and they have never heard of anything like this happening.  We will never be back!",PoRM49BtS-OoPJqVYOir9w,8,0,1,1W8lgBlP-ZLOOiEdc4-Alg

4278601,2013-01-22,4,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"My advice, go to a nice restaurant on the Strip and you'll have a better and more fun experience, pay much less and get the same quality of food.

Let's start at the beginning....

My husband and I had both heard such great things about Michael's, so we thought we'd try out. From the moment we walked in it was awkwardly silent and not welcoming at all. People literally looked at us like we were crazy (and apparently we were for going there.)

After we waited at the bar for about 20 minutes, we were finally seated and then sat for another 15 minutes before anyone even came to say hi or take our order. Finally when the server arrived, he dropped off a platter of vegetables (yes, a giant platter) and two baskets of hard bread.

Once we received the menu (another 20 minutes later), the waiter didn't go over it with us or tell us what the experience would be like. So we just order our entrées and hoped for the best (by the way the prices were twice as much as the best steak houses on the Strip). The entrées came out about 20 minutes after we ordered and by that time we were completely full from the platter of veggies. The food was definitely great, but you can go to some of the best restaurants on the Strip (twice) for the price you pay at Michael's and get the same quality of food, if not better. 

After dinner, they asked us if we wanted dessert. Although we declined because we were so incredibly full and had to pack-up half of our entrées to go, they still insisted that we had to see the dessert cart. So we caved in and ordered a dessert. By this time, we were literally about to explode and then I kid you not, they brought an entire fruit basket (not fruit bowl or platter, a basket) AND a platter full of chocolate covered fruit. Don't you think the waiter would have mentioned that they bring out an entire fruit basket and chocolate cover fruit platter at the end of dinner when we said we did not want to order dessert because we were too full? Who can eat that much???

So in an effort to try to make our meal worth the price, we did our best to eat the fruit, but it was impossible. So concluding our dinner, we left uncomfortably full and with complete and utter buyer's remorse once we received our far too expensive bill. Meh.",HmnK4tXgx2rpXOdZP8-D6Q,6,0,2,TyZ0mlDbQyKeLbLN1qit8A
4283384,2015-03-02,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"The food is fabulous, but there are a few things you need to know. First, this is a very expensive resturant, even when you compare it to other high end steak houses on the strip (which is why I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5 stars). Dinnner for 2 will cost at least around $300, and that does not include if you order drinks (it also does not include the tip, so your final bill could actually be around $400 to $500). The decor and atmosphere is very elegant.....but it is also dated....it looks like how a high end steak house looked in the 1950's and 1960's (with all the dark red colors, dark wood, and chandeliers)....however, I know many people really like this nostalgic look, so I can't really fault them for the decor. As I stated before, the food is great and the portions are tremendous (so much so, we were able to make 2 more meals out of the leftovers we brought home). They also do some additional niceties that very few places do, such as bringing out a complimentary big vegitable platter and a big bowl of fruit. But, because of the enormous portions of the main meal, my suggestion would be to skip these items. One final suggestion, I have eaten here a few times, and the desert cart looks great....but I was always too full to order anything....but if you still want something sweet with your after dinner coffee, then they do give you a great complimentary dessert chocolate covered fruit platter.... This will also save you a little money by not having to order dessert.",jylt6aurOs--IviJliM70w,0,0,4,CEaMfMp3G814VnH1EGth1g

This really is how Vegas fine dining used to be, right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed.  If you want cutting-edge cuisine with a celebrity chef's name over the door, go elsewhere.  However, if you want an authentic trip to Vegas past, this is the place to go.

It was coated with a light crust, not of bread crumbs but of something gentler. The slice of fish itself was at least 2.5 inches thick...I have never had  seabass cut to this  perfection. It was lightly cooked(baked perhaps)then sauteed.  Alongside it there were some small sweet green onions served on the plate that were to Die for..I don't even eat onions on a regular basis. Also came with a baked tomatoe encased with breading of some sort. I was so engrossed in the seabass, I never touched the tomato. On several other plates was their filet. The cut was impeccable, perfect size, flavor & consistancy. This restaurant knows  it's steaks & fish
After dinner we each got a miniature champagne glass of lemon meringue with dom perignon on top. Apparently to clean the pallet of flavors. It too was a perfectly timed addition. 
The dessert tower is the size of a luggage cart..Im not joking. 9inch high cakes to indulge the sweet tooth. Their chocolate strawberries are a big hit & the strawberry shortcake melts in your mouth. 
This is a  high end dining experience. I feel blessed to have gone. The service is impeccable..Come dressed nicely & this isn't a place to come if you have to look at prices. The staff is very nice, not pretentious in the least. Sometimes with fine dining restaurants people don't feel at ease. Don't let the surroundings fool you., that is not the case here. They are there to make sure you will want to return.:-)",mvS2UIMT_UhnzrfcDDo6uA,4,1,5,SvTH9qLVOdNcimCdsrJrCw

4685730,2011-07-29,1,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"If you're looking for the ULTIME Vegas dining experience, Michael's is the place to be.

First of all, the restaurant is named after Michael Gaughan, the owner of the Coast Casinos (South Point, Sun Coast, etc.)  It is meant to model old school Las Vegas culture and dining, and the place is decorated with precisely this in mind.  All of the tables have giant chairs, the booths are enormous, it is very dimly lit, and everything is red velvet.

When we arrived, we were seated by our ""captain"" (the title of the head server as we had many throughout the night) and immediately served complementary bottled water, crackers, and a crudite of assorted pickled vegetables including cauliflower, beets, pickles, olives, onions, cucumbers, and quail eggs with a soft herbed cheese.

Once that was served, we were brought our menus.  In old school style, all of the females in our party were served menus without prices, and males were served menus with the prices.  Though this is slightly chauvinistic in my opinion, I understand this old school approach to the dining experience.

To start,  got the famous Caesar Salad prepared table-side which was very rich and creamy.  They rub the wooden bowl they toss the salad in with garlic to ensure the flavor penetrates.  After, to cleans our palates we were served lemon sorbet with Dom Perignon, which was by far my favorite part of the meal.  The fizzy bubbliness with the tart, cold texture of the sorbet was the perfect rev-up for our main course.

For our sides, we ordered sauteed fresh mushrooms à la crème, creamed spinach, and broccoli with a side of hollandaise.  Though extremely heavy, all sauces matched the vegetables to perfection.

As entrees, two us ordered filet mignons which was served with a tomato stuffed with cheese and breadcrumbs, and a mushroom.  The steak was rich and seared wonderfully, with a perfectly pink center.  The other two ordered the sea bass with melted leeks and dill.  The fish was just flakey enough with a succulent, buttery texture.  Both dishes, in my eyes were award winning.  Between the four of us, each of us brought home more than half of our meal, it was that rich.

For dessert, though none of us were anything remotely close to hungry, we naturally made space for the desert pocket.  When they brought out the pastry cart we were entirely overwhelmed by the options, but decided on the famous banana's foster and strawberry creme cake (from Fried's deli) to share.  Both were magnificent and entirely too sinful, but I must that that banana's foster stole the show.  The banana's were cooked in a melty buttery/brown sugar concoction and caramelized in the perfect blend of spices, (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) then flambéed with a mix of various flavored rums, all served over vanilla ice cream.  Additionally, as if we did not have enough, we were brought a giant basket of fruit (apples, oranges, pears, grapes, cherries, etc.) and an assortment of mik, white, and dark chocolate covered fresh and candied fruit. 

We ended up sitting at the restaurant for more than three hours in our food-drunken splendor after eating by no exaggeration, the most decadent meal of our lives.

Though this place is extremely pricey, if you are looking for a night to splurge, this place is absolutely the place to do it big.  At Michael's it is all about the experience, and though you will have to cough up the dough for it, it is quite worth it.",Ci4HqTd370VSTa4DbF5Yvw,4,0,5,Y04n6CYo9jQFr4TCmFOvzA

After seeing some friends perform at the South Point showroom last evening, we hit Michaels.  With its 15 tables it is normally impossible to get in but we roll in at 9:30 2 of us and we are only ones there.  

Seated and presented wine list and Relish Bowl and breads.. You realize you're not in Kansas anymore Toto... Holy Crap... we settle on two house wines $20.00 and 22.00 only options respectfully. 

Menu mix of Italian & Steak... but having steak night before we go with 

Shrimp Fra Diablo Appetizer $30.00 for 5 large shrimp in a balanced not spicy tomato sauce.  Fresh yes, tasty yes, and worth the price... thumbs down. 

French Onion Soup.. $22.00 large Touraine with covered cheese which is your standard Onion soup.  For this price point you would expect the greatest onion soup ever delivered..  Ummm hot yes, tasty yes soup at this price fails. 

Lemon Sorbet now while he pours Dom Perignon over it nice touch. 

Two Veal Dishes served table side with stuffed Tomato..

Veal Francais $76.00  Veal  Saltambocca $76.00

Both Excellent no doubt on that but the price points simply don't justify the meal. 

Complimentary fruit plate piled high to the sky with various chocolate covered fruits also complimentary was excellent. 

Service outstanding and Russ   and waiter were complete Gentlemen and excellent host. 

I know persons will pound me and say if you can't afford to eat there don't knock it for price etc...  Well I can afford it, and I simply don't see how paying $76.00 for a simply prepared dish of Veal is validated.  

Excellent experience, good top quality food, service, ambiance untouchable. But I personally can't get around the price tag of
1 Soup 1 Shrimp Appetizer Dish - two dishes of Veal, two sides and two glasses of wine with tax & Tip $360.00  Donald Trump I'm not... you want to pay these prices be my guest, I've experienced it once but simply can't justify the value.",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,17,2,3,PC6zw0HLM7jUWhRTJjEG4g

4886485,2017-06-06,0,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"I think the 'good' reviews are more difficult to write then the bad ones. What can I say about Michael's other than you really have to experience it! If you're looking for a hipster/yuppie modern scene, Look elsewhere. If you're looking for a solid, old-school, high-end dining EXPERIENCE, Michael's is your place!   The first 'course' was a relish tray with everything from pickled beets to quail eggs and cucumber with a yummy chive spread.  The bread was fun cheese type pumpernickel crackers.  We had the Cesar salad which was assembled at our table.  All veggies and ingredients were fresh and made from scratch (NO bottled dressing here)!

Between courses we got a small serving of lemon sherbet with Dom Perignon champagne to 'cleanse' our palates (I'm not quite sure what made them believe our palates were dirty, but the thought was nice). 

We ordered the Chateaubriand for two which was nothing short of awesome! It was cooked perfectly & assembled at the table with perfect presentation (some of the veggies were even housed in a woven ""nest"" of shoestring potatoes). 

Dessert was displayed on a huge rolling cart full of delights - some flown in from across the country!  We couldn't rationalize ordering one more thing, so we declined.  They still brought us a tray of petit fours & fruit covered in Belgian chocolate AND a whole bowl of fresh fruit (apples, 2 kinds of grapes, pears, etc.) ""compliments"" of the restaurant!  The tea service was even spectacular! 

Although a team of six or more people took part in waiting on us, the whole production was impressively seamless -- running like a well oiled machine. The salad alone involved at least four separate individuals (one to set up the table side cart, the waiter prepared, another served, and still another cleaned up)!

It is a very small, intimate venue (50 seats total?). The seating is also brilliantly set up to maximize privacy (e.g., tables are in the round with very high back chairs). 

The prices are mind bogglingly high, so bring your platinum card or go only for a special occasion.  It is definitely worth what you pay, though!",zdd3a5Qb4RZ5FGB_HXY3Mg,1,0,5,iqp1zkYLDOMLcLWdDh1VyA

I already have my concerns with a sirloin because it's  the cheapest piece of meat on a cow and said to him that I was apprehensive in ordering in the first place. he said it was their best steak on the menu. At $92 I don't feel I should have eaten only half of it because it was so tough. he said he would mention it to the chef but he did not offer to do anything about it.  this is a one time experience at this restaurant I will continue to go to Vic and Anthony's were the steak is half the price and ten times better.,H5jfhT2AVhH83dmGz3RchQ,2,0,3,Eopn1Tnx4EhneEXVcgDOoQ

When I learned more about it my interests were immediately piqued.  After an afternoon at the movies and being horribly underdressed I popped in expecting to just see the menu and return when dressed more appropriately.  The staff was so gracious and encouraged and welcomed so in so we could feel comfortable in our jeans and comfy movie sweaters (ugh I know!)  We decided to stay for dinner and our experience began. This is slow-paced eating,  meant to be savored so don't stop in if you're in a rush. You can however come in starving since the first thing they do after taking your drink order is bring you a huge plate of crudités and pickled delicacies including hard boiled quail eggs and jicama slices along with pumpernickel and crackers and other little goodies.  I had the escargot (served en croute)  which was amazing. It reminded me of Cafe Nicole ages ago with all the garlic butter and tender snails - yum!  Then I opted for the filet and so did my guest, sharing the asparagus and glazed carrots.  I make better carrots at home but the asparagus was pretty special and as a self-proclaimed (but completely accurate!) bernaise connoisseur  it is the best in town lol. They even compliment the meal with a sorbet/palate cleanser which you rarely see outside of 5+ course pre-fixes anymore.   After dinner came the giant fruit bowl and Belgian chocolates since we skipped dessert, then after dinner mints to boot! My favorite part of the place is that it's quiet but not stuffy in the least, the staff is courteous but doesn't take themselves too seriously.  It seems like the kind of place where you can have a memorable meal but not feel too badly if you ended up drinking too much and stumbling out lol -- that  kind of old school money vibe.  It's not trendy and judging by presentation it's not trying to be, the food is top quality and straightforward.  Speaking of top quality, as usual, Mr. Mina doesn't mess around with many of his items flown in specifically for the day.  Examples include NY cheesecake from Carnegie Hall, Key Lime pie from Florida, clams from so and so.... get the drift?  There are some amazing steakhouses here in town but this place has an easy elegance about it and certain attention to detail that's tough to beat. Don't come on a budget but  I'd rather have one incredible, memorable cuisine than a week's worth of forgettable and/or mundane food.",SDTOsJVoDKsP5O-VDJTL4g,2,0,5,hNcPksEZfDD3Y4PSXcB5rg

We have lived here for almost 13 years and can't believe it took us this long to find this AMAZING place!!!  

It has an old school feel and only the head of the table (usually the man) will get a menu with prices...and that may be a good thing because I suspect some people would pass out at this point.  The restaurant only seats 50 people and is intimate with Red Velvet everywhere.   The service is unmatched and this is an EXPERIENCE where from start to finish, you are treated like Royalty.  I would definitely sit back and enjoy the evening and savor every bite....this is not a restaurant where you come to ""just have dinner"".

To start.....We ordered our drinks....they do not have a drink menu but the server will assist you in choosing the best wine, beer or cocktail.  Then the server brings a complimentary Bread Basket and a Crudite of beets, carrots, cucumbers and assorted pickles which were good.

They have been to a lot of the places on the strip and off, and they brought us here for their last meal before moving back east.  As most other reviews have mentioned this place is pricey, I glanced over at my husband's menu to check out the prices and they were heft, saw that the filet mignon was around $80. Yes the martinis were $25, pomegranate was amazing, but they give you a big martini glass and essentially you get a 2nd one because they give you what is left in the mini shaker, so not that outrageous. That said, you are paying for more than the food, it is an experience unrivaled really anywhere these days where flashy places want to turn tables over quickly. We were there for 3.5 hours and I enjoyed every second.
We had a waitstaff of 4 for the 4 of us.  I never had a crumb that lasted more than 5 seconds on the tablecloth before getting cleaned off.  Our water was always filled, napkins folded if we left the table, etc. Since it was our friends last meal in Vegas we went all out and got way too much food. Would suggest going there and getting the Caesar salad ( best I've ever had) and then splitting an entree (we had the halibut which was enough to share, filet is also a great option to split), and then getting the bananas foster (so sinfully delicious). We were ogling over the dessert cart but had decided to just get the bananas but because the waiter saw how torn we were about not trying the NY cheesecake flown in from NY that he brought us a slice of the cheesecake as a courtesy.  We had fun talking with our head waiter who had been working there for 18 years and he was the baby of the staff.

This was a great meal for my Vegas trip.  Located in the Southpoint Casino and off the beaten path, traditional vacationers may have a hard time finding this place.  I was staying at the Aria, so it was about a 30 dollar cab ride, but it was worth every penny to eat here.  And, don't be thrown off by the location if you are staying on the strip.  When my party first rolled up, I thought, ""Oh crap, this is just going to be a cruddy steakhouse!"", but boy was  I wrong.

When you open the doors to this place, it is like going back in time.  Rich red velvet wall coverings, high red chairs, dimly lit chandilers and the tables are huge.  When you are first seated, a full cold plate with vegetables and a creamy cheese dish is set before you alone with rye chips and crackers.  The wine list is the best of the best too --- I was very impressed and was equally happy when the footer of the bill ordered a 2007 bottle of Caymus.

The Ceaser salad is great --- done tableside and they can make it how big or small you would like.  The stone crab appetizer special was amazing.  The claws were huge and sweet.  The sweet mustard horseraddish sauce was tasty too.  An intermezzo of frozen lemon sorbet was brought out with a splash of Dom Perigon (so fancy).  Then, here is where we made the mistake --- WE ORDERD WAY TO MUCH FOOD!  The Chateaubriand was more like a meal for four!  It was so good though!  The Denver Sole was light and buttery, cooked so well.  We were so full after this, we did not have room for the dessert cart, or any of the tableside desserts.

They took everything from the wallpaper to the furniture to the glass door when they moved. They even brought back all of the old staff.

I love this place. Had my second date with the BF 10 years ago here. I love how the menus for the woman do not have prices, so old school. When you are seated they bring a HUGE plate if veggies and peppers and meats. You could get full eating this alone.

For apps, try to go when the Stone Crab is in season. These are the best, nice big juicy stone crab claws. If not in season I would recommend the Baked Escargot. 

Salads and Soups: William J's Salad and French Onion Soup are my favorites.

For Entrees I would recommend sharing something, because the portions in this place are huge. The Dover Sole or the Chateaubriand, Bouquetierre are awesome.

They do have really great desserts here. I hate to not recommend them but they are going to bring you a huge fruit basket with a full size pineapple, apples, strawberries etc. They are also going to bring you a plate of chocolate covered fruit that is on the house. You will not be able to eat all of this food. I promise.",nixQjPlfVhMEhrNkmp5FDw,3,2,5,ttcAUCopUfOx5LKS5UlZyQ

Otherwise i would not justify the cost of $400 for two people that does not include tip.

the first time i went there i had lobster, its a very nice restaurant with great service. The lobster was huge must have been 5 pounds at least.
 the second time i went i had the Chateaubriand which was very good.

I recommend Michaels only for very special occasions unless you have deep pockets. But its worth the experience",ewtoMdU18BDfoEnRsQ8QiA,0,0,4,lY-BRIuNCX8svAdYmLVIeA

However what was very disconcerting is that this restaurant is promoted as ""one of the last classy rooms"" in vegas which is supposed to have a ""dress code"", in Actually does not. There were people in jeans all around us and for a restaurant with such supposed high standards, this was disappointing. Service was very good give it a B+ for attentiveness and help. The food well, those who say on Yelp that this is the "" best restaurant"" they have ever been too, I fortunately for them have not been to many restaurants on Vegas let alone anywhere! I can name three right off my head : Mesa Grill, Spago, Giada, that blow this place away. My dinner companions started with a Cesar salad made table side , however the preparation was pedestrian with little flare and apparently with out raw egg or anchovies. It was, at best fair to middling. I had the renowned onion soup that ya actually made with Veal stock that was tasty but really nothing to rave about. Dinner was Filet For my companions and a veal chop for me. All decent but way over rated. Potatoes Au gratin was fine but who goes to a restaurant for potatoes. Overall I'd give Michael's a C+ for the service and food. I have never judged a restaurant by price. However, this restaurant is stick in the 20th century with its option of itself and its prices. There's isn't a steak I have ever had in vegas with a $90.00 price tag. Or a veal chop at $85.00! If either was outta this world sure, price is worth it. But when you spend $600.00 for three, you better get sensation not above average. In conclusion although pretty w/decent food, the old Vegas charm doesn't work anymore and the food was unfortunately over-rated!",RoBvy9WidAzXGIDHGRwpqA,0,0,3,M73728VcaNjNmBmG6s8aZg

Every single thing from the impeccable service, to the table side meal preparations, to the actual dishes is just wonderful. I really feel like I am being treated when I come here, it is the perfect place for a special occasion. If you have a group or a super special event definitely reserve the private room. Some dishes that I love here are the Crab Cake, Sea Bass, and Bananas Foster. The William J's Salad may just be my favorite salad ever, it literally melts in your mouth. The steaks are delicious as well. The cocktails are also huge, more like doubles.

5401143,2015-08-07,1,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"Michael's is located inside South Point casino and is an absolutely beautiful and opulent restaurant, making you forget where you are and taking you into the most lavish of environments. The service is impeccable. So why 3 stars?

...The prices are exorbitant as the quality of the food is average, not even close to fabulous. We ordered the salmon at $68.00 per plate: it was well done which is an absolute no no as per top chefs and tasted ok, far from the better salmon I have had at many restaurants on the Las Vegas strip at half the price. It came with a tomato on the plate and the salmon was about 6 oz. We ordered potato gratin as a side and it was good. What is likely part of this price is the large crackers and toasted bread along with butter and cruditees that are automatically brought before the meal ('complimentary') and the large basket of fruit and 'amuse bouche' that you get after the main course, regardless of whether you order dessert or not. The cruditees were nice and the 'amuse bouche' consisted mainly of chocolate covered fruit ( delicious). We did order a slice of black forest cake and a slice of strawberry short cake off the dessert cart and they were really good, more than can be said for the entree. We also ordered a couple of glasses of Pinot noir, $20.00 each. In the end, with tax and tip, the meal came out to about $150.00 per person (we did not order an appetizer and it's good we did not as we were really full). 

I am very okay with expensive restaurants as long as the food makes a statement by being phenomenal! This was not the case. What I believe I payed for is a beautiful ambiance and complimentary cruditees and fresh fruit and chocolate covered fruit. 

Maybe other entrees are better, yet the prices are very high so hopefully other choices are way better. I am a foodie, so I know great food, and this is not a restaurant that will offer the best in town... which is disappointing for the prices they charge.",leY7FqJ3NKPzpM5awAQ2-Q,4,1,3,ClAxqdPcw0gHo8bjl8d0sA
5454291,2012-10-11,3,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"Loved this place!  South Point you shocked me!

First of all, the decor reminds me of TrueBlood or more specifically Fangtasia which I love love love.  It's ALL RED inside with dark wood.  All the chairs have high backs and are covered in red crushed velvet.  I was surprised at how high end it was for being in the South Point Casino.  Waiters were numerous and attentive, dressed to the nines.  Place is extremely intimate and quiet, definite great date place.  Some of the men, but not all, were wearing jackets. The waiters all had jackets on.

We ordered a bottle of wine and my dining partner ordered a dirty martini which came in the most amazing glass! [see pix] They also brought an assortment of veggies, beets, eggs [which we actually thought were small mozzarella balls-surprised us!], and bread to start off your meal. It was delightful.  We didn't order a starter or appies because we knew what we wanted. The other amusing point was that the female's menu has no prices on it, while the male's menu did!  [see pix]  This got a chuckle out of my accomplice. 

I ordered the Veal Saltimbocca and he got a 9 oz filet.  Mine was amazing*and*  his was amazing!!!! One of the better steaks I have had in this city, and I've been to a bunch. We also ordered a side of string beans, they were just OK in my book, the only thing I would not ordered again when I go back, b/c I'm definitely going back.

At the end of the meal, the bring this large dessert tray over that has like 9 different cakes/pies/table side flambe!  We were so full we declined and then they surprised us yet again with an assortment of chocolates, chocolate covered strawberries, and all sorts of yummie chocolate covered fruits.",8QKrhvVqhEkD8xo4E4s0GQ,6,5,5,Vvv_C1570hrDJywWmxIsPg

My business partner and I brought a very important client to Michael's Gourmet Room last night for dinner. Some of what we experienced is what I had expected and some was a bit of a disappointment. I expected and received excellent service, very elegant Decor, and an upscale ambience. I also expected a very high price menu and that it was. it definitely has some 5 star attributes. 

I was disappointed and did not expect the food to have such a lack of flavor. I was not impressed with the fillet mignon I've had much better.

I did not expect that it would be located in a casino that is far from ""up-scale"". The Southpoint Casino really should consider some sort of dress code. It does spoil the mood when you walk in. 

There are many places that are much better in Las Vegas.

5568390,2018-01-08,1,296PZdxSrtH08EUwCsOKMw,"My mom and I decided to splurge for Christmas Eve dinner and made a reservation here.  This place is like stepping into another world.  This is totally old school.  Waiters and staff in tuxes.  Tableside food preparation.  Drinks refilled constantly.  Bringing you a new napkin when you step away to the restroom.  

While you are deciding on food, they bring you a crudité platter with all of kinds of pickles, picked veggies and other veggies with a nice aioli type sauce.  And two kinds of bread.  Loved the dark bread with the cheese melted on it.  

I started with the William J's Salad - Avocado, Peeled Tomatoes and Hearts of Palm.  They made this tableside.  Its fun to watch.  The dressing was like a Caesar dressing.  Lots of parmesan cheese.  Loved all of the bits of avocado and hearts of palm in the salad.  Mom had her go-to onion soup.  She really liked.  Good flavor, lots of cheese and bread on top.

For entrees, I had a Petite Filet Mignon.  The steak was nicely cooked but lacked flavor.  That is the only reason I am not giving them 5 stars.  the Béarnaise sauce helped with the meat flavor.  The steak was tender and cooked properly.  It just was bland for a steak.  

Mom had the Veal Francaise - sautéed in egg batter and wine.  She really liked this and took half home as the portion was large.  It had a good flavor and she liked the sauce.  We also did a side of the Michael's Creamed Corn.  This was creamy and tasty. Fresh corn.  

For dessert, they bring around the cart so you can see everything.  I had a coconut and pineapple white cake.  It was very tasty.  Only could take a few bites as I was so full. Mom had a fruit filled cake with chocolate ganache.  She really liked it too.  They also bring you a plate of chocolate covered fruit and a big fruit bowl.  We took the chocolate covered fruit home.  

The staff is wonderful.  Very attentive.  Good food.  They need to work on their steak but overall a delicious, wonderful meal.",VdkAX9khigCjpMGuMNWYMQ,4,1,4,yC5c8RkVIWXbEwFFgA8H3A

The restaurant is actually hidden and makes you feel totally ""cool"" walking through the doors. Once inside you're automatically greeted by the maitre'd Joe and seated right away. 

Tables are set very close to the booth so the waiter will come and assist and pull out the table for you and push it back in. If you sit at the table with the tall chairs the waiter will also assist you with pulling out the chairs. Once seated the waiters will hand you a napkin to place across your lap. You will be given a wine list and the dinner menu and they will serve you bottled water along with a bread/cracker and veggie bowl while waiting for your order. Everything is prepared table side as much as they can, drinks, salad and even your entree. My parents both ordered 2 martinis and both were poured table side into their glass and they were left with the remaining drink to enjoy later. 

The service is absolutely outstanding. It is ONE OF A KIND. My water glass is never half full it is always full, they are extremely attentive. Crumbs that are left on the plate are delicatley and discreetly cleaned up, utensils that are dirty that were used for a previous dish are replaced. I have had the filet, sea bass and dover sole, my mom loves the lamb chops and my dad is in love with the filet. Everything here is AMAZING!!

When we said we were interested in a table one of the serves told us to take a look at the menu to see if this was really where we wanted to eat. This seemed odd, and we immediately said we were fine and would wait for the table. 

Moments later the host informed us that there was a dress code and we needed to leave. 

We were not dressed up by any means, however we were certainly not under dressed compared to the old folks and cowboys that were already dinning.
