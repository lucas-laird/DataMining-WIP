The flavor was a let down and the sauce was very watered down. It's also spicy, but the menu didn't say spicy. 

And the worst part was that it only had one chunk of chicken! I asked the guy why it only had one piece and he said, he would give me ""extra chicken"" and gave me two more chunks.  Would not go back or recommend.",XriyqXsM_MDkRDzcYCYOYQ,0,0,2,0lxa7gQaCpnljxWdYpPJfA

It made for a perfect hot meal on a rare cold day in Las Vegas.  The only downside was there wasn't anywhere warm to sit and eat nearby!",hNjvSiHLX4SoCmR-d-N8ew,0,0,5,lCveCn6IbH_i-OKVsjVwzQ
2336708,2017-02-03,0,EIH5pDc75v4haOcww-SEJg,"When I first walked up to the glorified food cart that is Urban Turban the worker was on a smoke break - not the best impression! I almost walked away but the smells coming from the food itself were so good I couldn't bring myself to leave. The employee washed their hands before serving me which was good enough for me. The food isn't being made right then anyway - it's being spooned from a heating apparatus into your plate. 

This description makes it sounds like a two star review, not a four. However despite these characteristics of Urban Turban I have a very favorable overall opinion of this place. I had a tiki masala curry plate. It was expensive compared to what you get at a sit down place off the strip but I expected that. It wasn't ridiculously priced - I paid $15 dollars for my bowl and a mango lassi. It was delicious! Perfectly spicy and well made. 

The only real suggestion I have is that they sell samosas. At Pikes Place years ago I had the best samosa of my life from a little cart and they were doing really well. I think that given all the people walking around here - many of them would be perfectly happy to get a snack but aren't in the mood for a whole meal.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,5,4,4,lue3nQHzekxgJng2g2vnLg
2431972,2016-11-13,0,EIH5pDc75v4haOcww-SEJg,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick bite that didn't break the bank. This food stand was a nice surprise! The menu was limited but considering that the location is on the Strip and it was unique made it worth trying. We love a good butter chicken and Tikka Masala and I think this place delivered. For about 7 or 8 dollars we got a normal paper plate sized tin of bazmati rice topped with sauced chicken. We enjoyed that the sauce was slightly tomatoey and had a kick, but definitely would recommend a bottle of water next to you if you're  sensitive to heat. The portion and price was great for the Strip and was good quality. I wish our plate got more chicken, but the sauce was so good with the rice that we didn't mind that much. I would definitely go back!",sLWQj-gJBAYMeslvVArOOw,1,0,5,FF3kL6rMdgg44SsGpFRtyA

Curry was watered down and the rice didn't have any flavor. Three peaces of chicken and less than a cup of rice is all I got for $10.80
Very upsetting",rW3GRkundb0MmhS9ugEfng,1,0,2,AlUQHDqQZXWYqmI54TI2tw

When I got back to my room I saw the gave me something I did not order. The vegetarian rice was not good, I could not eat it so I threew it away and the chicken in the tika was grose.",xxRwBDJmKPXMqMRz-fEElg,0,0,1,3NfJEvkJXho3R5iIWir3uw

5278330,2016-10-10,10,EIH5pDc75v4haOcww-SEJg,"During the interlude of a concert at Brooklyn Bowl, my husband and I walked out into the LINQ promenade to grab a bite to eat at the conveniently located Urban Turban Express. It's a small set up with a limited menu with around 4 items to choose from, but I love the idea of having Indian fast food available at the LINQ. 

We ended up sharing the mushroom curry bowl with rice ($9.99). I was expecting it be loaded with mushrooms, but it was more of a vegetable medley. The spice level was packing some serious heat! All the food is pre-made, so adjusting the spice level isn't possible. You've been warned. 

This is a great to-go option and my husband and I were both fans of our vegetarian curry bowl.
