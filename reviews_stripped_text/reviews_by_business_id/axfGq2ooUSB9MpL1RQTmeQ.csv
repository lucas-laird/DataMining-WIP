53381,2012-12-11,0,axfGq2ooUSB9MpL1RQTmeQ,"I'm a fan of Panda Express so for that alone they always get three stars, this location gains a star for the hot fresh food, clean restrooms and clean table and chairs that I sat on.  They lose that last star for my experience here with the amount of food they gave me.  

I was finished shopping at the outlet mall and got a notification that my plane was an hour delayed, I needed to pass more time and I was so over gambling. I was hungry and I didn't want to spend a ton of money on airport food. I saw the Panda Express sign and thought that it would be a perfect place to repack my bags and spend my new found hour before I needed to drop off my rental car.  I'm sure I'm not the only person who ever bought so much stuff that they had to buy a cheap duffel bag right?  

Anyways, I get there and park, change my top, repack my (now plural) bags and go inside.  I normally order a two entree plate and save some of it for the next day, since I didn't have that option I opted to get a rice bowl.  The menu states it is one serving of an entree and your choice of chow mien/fried or steamed rice.  I order the sweet fire chicken, steamed rice and a drink, it comes to almost seven dollars but whatever, I was looking really forward to my food.  Then I look down at the food, yes it is hot and fresh but I have about five pieces of chicken, huge clumps of onions, one chunk of pineapple and a ton of steamed rice.  Disappointment!  I'm not even sure if I got a half scoop of the chicken dish.  Since I was eating there I guess I could have complained but honestly I was tired, hungry and knew my day was only half over.  The food was really good but I wish there had been more of it and less of the empty carbs.",QGOHT0w-UTFsjW4sYdcv1w,0,0,4,PL-pJ1Pf21DI6_MtlRbefg

I asked for my food to be replaced AND my money to be refunded. They said they can't do that. So I got my money back and wrote this review.

2101403,2018-04-21,0,axfGq2ooUSB9MpL1RQTmeQ,"Stopped in tonight after a 14 hour shift at work as I sometimes do when I just want a quick, easy meal.  Have been to several locations over the years, and previously was treated well at this one. 

Tonight, however, the person putting together the to-go boxes of food seemed to purposely skimp on my food...    the person right in front of me ordered almost the exact same thing I did, except with noodles instead of rice.  They got heaping portions of noodles, and heaping portions of their 2 meat dishes.    When my turn came, I was very polite and ordered my food.   I got a small serving of rice, and the smallest portions of meat dishes that I've ever had at a Panda Express.  The person immediately behind me then ordered and I watched as she also got heaping portions of everything she ordered.   When I casually and politely mentioned something to the server, I got a dirty look, and a ""we give everyone the same"", and he walked away.  

Panda Express isn't gourmet food, I understand that.  It's reasonably cheap, pretty consistent and it's everywhere in Las Vegas.  Next time I'll be sure to visit a different location, or better yet, head over to Spring Mountain for something more authentic, and better service.",4E-Z9_lleJU0jLnKNjNQnw,0,0,2,fPtkSGV8mJ4i44_eh27BSw

I ask for brown rice every time and they say everytime they don't have any. So are they always out or dont carry everything on the menu? I got rice and mixed veggies with kung pow and teriyaki chicken with a side of rangoons. I waited 10 minutes for the mixed veggies. Mind you I'm on my lunch break. Then I had to wait an additional 10 minutes because they forgot about my rangoons. I listened to the manager yell at the girl who was working in front of customers. Seriously that needs to be done in the back not in the front.

The employees were very nice here- smiles, welcome greetings, and offered samples, too. (I tried a different type of shrimp, but opted for the one I originally wanted.) They were hard-working. They were cleaning tables vacated as the restaurant was getting busy with the lunch rush. There was also lots of cooking as well, since the line was getting longer and longer after we were seated.  

Our picky son loves the beef and broccoli dish- it is one of his favorites! He doesn't even want to try other things on the menu here. We noticed that his meal was mostly broccoli, so my husband went to the manager and the problem was corrected. Kudos for not giving us a problem with it. I had the bowl with honey walnut shrimp (I'm pretty sure that I'll get that one again, next time) and hubby had a two item plate with chow mein. Everything was very good.

I also always do the surveys (within 7 days) in order to cash in on their promo- this is an ongoing thing.) I should also mention that this is one of my husband's favorite chain places for fast chinese food. 

There are sooooooo many restaurant choices in the immediate area, so there is lots of competition, since it is across from an outlet mall (yes, there are more yummy choices inside the mall as well). It's nice to know that this is a pretty dependable place.

Panda Express is located right in the same complex of the South Outlets on Las Vegas Blvd. The inside is surprisingly spacious, open, and clean. I walked in craving noodles and chicken and ordered just that. I was lucky to catch the cook making a fresh batch of Chow Mein and tried a few chicken pieces to figure out which chicken I wanted. I went with the grilled Teriyaki Chicken which was pretty decent!

I was pleased by the friendly workers - a male who helped get my to-go bowl together and a female who assisted me at the register. They were both welcoming and engaging.

The food tasted OK - met my expectations for Panda Express. I added a few extra ingredients when I got home to give it a bit more flavor (soy sauce, black pepper, topped off with Sriracha).

Made me wait 15 min to place and order just to get it wrong- I called for a manager , I was then hung up on. Trying at no avail, phone rang 1200x with nobody picking up now!!! Absolutely the worst!!!!!!!!!!",6U9982jt6P-hz53J4xT4Rw,0,0,1,ZvqgL7fr95TyXUaZTc3xbQ
4886041,2018-04-03,0,axfGq2ooUSB9MpL1RQTmeQ,Good food but then I was grossed out when I saw the lady clean the men's room. She cleaned it which is ideal but then she mopped it too and THEN she proceeded to mop the rest of the entire restaurant with the urine saturated mop from the restroom. Just gross. Don't forget your order of operations.,JO7B20x5wLdd1wwMglallg,0,0,1,mYRyCidvueS8bQYQIHhj_Q

The food was cold and overcooked. I'll never be back. A waste of 7 hard earned dollars.  Should have asked for my money back. 

Stay away",6uhynaumj088CoQrIFxBoQ,0,0,2,-HShY99g7sB2Z9m1oG3DZw

I wouldn't make this my first choice (a lot of other places to pick from near by) but I wouldn't tell anyone to avoid it..",m8Zh2alAkYTRxLvK_w8kkA,1,1,3,D-ZAavgOgGC4o_8A4eLQ9w

The Chowmain  was dry - we got home we realize nothing was in the bag that we ordered and then we called to complain and she said what am I supposed to do as my response was probably make your customers happy and she said Ha !!

Although I really enjoy this location, as it is usually pretty busy so the food turnover is quick, meaning the food always seems to be pretty freshly prepared. 

I really enjoy the honey walnut shrimp, with steamed rice and the spring rolls. My absolute favorite part of coming to Panda Express is their fortune cookies!",6NYDXzkyYW3O2zYjzPRMsg,0,0,3,Yxf26bq8mNAk1n5v-erVdg

When I'm on my lunch hour and I need to get a quick bite on the go after shopping at the outlets or if I'm just in the area and want to get something fast. 

The service is standard and If you order the right menu items, you can actually make a relatively healthy lunch choice here.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,3,3,9_XrzAYURRaOW_cOZcTHzA
