My son is allergic to wheat, dairy, soy, and eggs. He's never had a birthday cake since we've always celebrated his birthdays in the Bay. This year, we stayed home in Vegas and I was able to order from Ala Mode. Ordering online was easy and I got great customer service through email. I wanted blue ombre waves to resemble water for my son's shark-themed party and they delivered. And when I cut into the cake and saw the fluffy texture, I was truly impressed. That first slice of cake disappeared pretty fast! Ala Mode is a godsend!",SqtkeZ-1iLavRblE1bivhw,1,0,5,CzwCQH14YlCTmUGWDDtl7w

I am vegan and have family members with gluten and dairy intolerance so it is nearly impossible to find something we are all okay to enjoy.  I have loved their vegan cupcakes and ice cream since they are Atomic # 7, and I can not wait for them to have a storefront I can swing by for a yummy treat whenever the mood strikes :-)",SVVmfF8e9VkrWYuVbzuY6w,2,1,5,yRnA9OvL6w5bv6xJyS__yg

I am from California and I was freaking with the idea that I would have to make my own (vegan) cake and transport it (from California) then decorate it along with all of the other wedding ""stuff"". I was elated when I found A la mode. Everyone I spoke with at A la mode was incredible . They paid attention to every thought and concern. I had some sample cupcakes overnighted to me and they were packaged perfectly and tasted super fresh and delicious. The wedding went off without a hitch, everything was perfect. When I arrived at the reception I saw the cake and it was beautiful. A la mode exceeded my expectations. The cake was delicious and everyone enjoyed it, non- vegans (everyone except me) could not tell the difference and loved it! THANK YOU A LA MODE!!!!",DwsiMOTyU93ne5oJgtt0hA,1,2,5,7eUkRK7zZdnd26qWUFhlQw

Thanks so much for the delivery of my Husband's birthday cake. It truly was delicious. I personally loved the flavor and how the icing was creamy and smooth but not sweet at all. Highly recommend your bakery. So happy we tried your goods out. I love that you are local. Thanks for providing the community a place to go for good ingredients and a better option for those who need alternative options.",8XE0YCvsMOHIr05zHFTm8Q,0,0,5,l6jAVYA0awn49NiKoRKEYQ

1236353,2014-10-12,1,9_P2oM43QIRze2VJpw_dHw,"I ordered cupcakes from A La Mode for a little party the Canadian and I threw in our suite at the Bellagio. I was a little worried about the hassle because the website notes that our hotel won't accept deliveries from A La Mode for us, but she's a great communicator and the delivery went flawlessly. The cupcakes themselves were delicious and exactly the right size for serving at a gathering like ours. The texture is also great -- I wondered a little bit if a gluten-free baked good without eggs would have the consistency of a sedimentary rock, but that is 100% NOT the case with these! My guests and I agree that the lemon in particular was amazing, but the flavors were all delicious. One of my guests, who is both gluten intolerant and allergic to eggs, practically bounced with joy when I told him ALL of the cupcakes were safe for him.",9iJg5RgBt51hifvDd_Xtkg,3,1,5,2dsOU5xl_XaKElKGCTSOMQ

1988867,2014-11-01,0,9_P2oM43QIRze2VJpw_dHw,Ordered the Lemon with lemon cream.  The cake was excellent and was above and beyond for a gluten free cake in terms of taste.   The yellow writing blended in the cake so that it was difficult to read.  It arrived on time and was great to have for the party for those who have allergies.  Would not hesitate to use again.,IDeEVoEObXIyZ7jMMEJH4w,2,0,5,TcQ3_BZvQC-YQIMJn8uKUw

They also dealt with my crazed nervous emails gracefully and quickly responding to assure me everything would be fine. And it was. Just amazing to have a bakery able to offer gluten free and dairy free deliciousness. I'm so glad you exist! Thank you!,h_2xNuWr2nIcy8lTt34AGA,0,0,5,69X-W8JkpIZHXAy5VqF9FA
2609005,2013-01-28,0,9_P2oM43QIRze2VJpw_dHw,"I got a box of their banana cupcakes. It was certainly a surprise when A La Mode called me on my cellphone. They said I had a special delivery and asked if I was available in the afternoon to receive them. I'm not vegan but I do indulge in vegan food once in a while. Not all vegan dishes and desserts are bland or taste processed. Anyway, the cupcakes were fantastic. They were not dry and were a delight for my tastebuds. I have a couple vegan coworkers and I would highly recommend them to try A La Mode out.",2rLsSQ9kMiQUmosk4vcuWQ,5,3,5,JQo9sgXp1j49B4zqeu4FoQ
3093205,2013-09-04,2,9_P2oM43QIRze2VJpw_dHw,"We were married at the Harley Davidson Chopper Chapel, on Sept 1.  My family has some pretty wacky allergies, so I had to find a bakery that could accommodate them AND would deliver.  A La Mode stepped up.  We ordered the vanilla cake with strawberry filling and chocolate frosting.  We specified gluten and dairy free, the top two allergies.  (Truth be told, I have 75 specific allergies and don't know how they would have made a cake with all of mine included).

There were 7 of us, and his parents are NOT gluten free fans.  So, this was going to be a challenge.  A La Mode stepped up to the plate flawlessly!!!  

The cake was easily something we would have ordered prior to our allergy days.  It was simply awesome.  

We ordered the cake that was supposed to feed 8.  After dinner, it could have fed 16.  When it first appeared it looked small, but it is dense and moist.  Not heavy, just spongy...  there was no grainy funky gluten free cake texture.  

They delivered on time, and even asked if they could deliver closer to our wedding time so it was the freshest possible product.

Would highly recommend!",9f6JDBTV4SBO8EZAnBq42Q,11,6,5,l82fInbzHn3nEEyrdaNG6g

4417617,2013-02-02,2,9_P2oM43QIRze2VJpw_dHw,"I am using A La Mode for my wedding cake. My wedding is more than two months away, and I was so blown away by their cake samples that I felt compelled to write a review now. 

If you are vegan, you already know it is hard to find cake that is light and flavorful. If you are gluten free, you already know it's hard to find cake that is moist and spongy and not grainy. I don't know what A La Mode is doing (maybe witch craft), but they seem to have solved all of the above! 

Their samples blew me away. The cake was so moist and even fluffy! The icing selections were all smooth and the flavors not overpowering. The berry compotes were out of this world. You could really taste the natural flavor of the berries (unlike others that are loaded with sugars, syrups, and oils). I was literally licking the box to get all of it out!

I seriously do not know why Whole Foods hasn't jumped on this already and started carrying their product because it blows Red Velvet out of the water. 

I used to think Atlas in NYC had the best baked vegan goods but A La Mode has taken the cake (har har!). And they are considerably more healthy being gluten free AND organic.",tnSVm_tdM5zthKgmGF5d1A,15,6,5,geh2Xz-EN0AV-A-e1FZe4g

The icing was light and just the right amount of sweetness, I do not normally eat icing from cakes, but this was too good to take off. The actual cake itself was moist and flavorful. Vegan or not, you will enjoy this cake regardless. I'll definitely buy more from them. Also the service is very friendly and the owner was very helpful. Every penny spent on this cake is worth it.",oUU9e6vGe7r_sgDcw1YC6A,4,0,5,kv5nZR3-EoNzYXx1Yk8Xcw

I sent in my request with a photo, and they gave me detailed feedback as to how the cake would look. They delivered the cake, matched my colors perfectly, and the cake was honestly the best cake I have ever tasted, vegan or non-vegan! For reference, I got the chocolate cake, with german chocolate filling, and almond icing. For the second layer I got the lemon cake with vanilla frosting. Both were equally amazing, I kept sneaking off of the dance floor to eat more! No one knew it was Vegan gluten free, and everything commented on how delicious it was. I will order cupcakes from them for our one year anniversary, even though I'll have to pay to have them shipped. It was that good!",bFHyZF8LryVblI4eQOBRdg,2,1,5,IUTTQbFRSuU1N8aJSVwTMg
