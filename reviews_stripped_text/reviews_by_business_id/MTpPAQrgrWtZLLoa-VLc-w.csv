I had the pork chops, potato salad, pinto beans and yams, very delicious. My Mom loved her chicken, my Sister got the catfish dinner they gave her 4 large pieces, my Hubby had the chicken wings they were great. Everything was seasoned well, and very fresh and cooked perfect. The service was great. We will be back. our bill was less than $40 for 4 people. We will be back.",TV-LGURdzeUH9k0ET22Kmw,1,1,5,xdHlycEXERzXSw3Omha7-A

The restaurant is located near the intersection of Rancho & Rainbow, just across the street from the Sante Fe Casino. They are two doors down from Dimas Tacos, inside the lot where the old movie theater used to be . The interior is kind of basic but has a nice homey, welcoming feel and they keep it very clean. There's a good amount of seating, but they offer to-go orders as well.

We were seated by one of the owners, Yvonne, who was kind enough to answer questions about the restaurant and the food. She explained that there used to be another restaurant in this location called Dirty South, which I had never heard of either. When they took over about 7 months ago, they revamped everything and changed the name. They still offer classic soul food dishes, but after investing in a new $7k smoker, smoke complaints from neighbors down the street forced them to put their BBQ efforts on hold. Apart from that setback, they still have a decent amount of items on the menu including oxtail, chitins and even an AYCE option. 

I ended up ordering the fried catfish dinner. For $12.99, you get 4 decent sized pieces of fish, 2 sides and a dinner roll. The catfish appeared to be very fresh and was cooked well with a nice tender, flaky interior. My only complaint is they were a bit heavy handed on the coating/breading, so it was slightly overpowering. The flavor was decent and not overly salty, but I think they went to light with the pepper and spices, so it lacked that slightly spicy kick I prefer in fried fish. I was also able to sample the fried chicken and even though it wasn't as crispy as I think fried chicken should be, the batter was really good and had a nice, subtle heat in it. If they do the same for the fish, it's winner, winner catfish dinner! Screw the chicken!

Ultimately, the sides are what really stood out for me here though. They have quite a few to choose from and it tastes like they put just as much love into the sides, as they do into the main dish. We ended up trying the collard greens, fried cabbage, mac 'n cheese and the potato salad. Both the greens and mac 'n cheese were some of the best versions I've had as a side at any restaurant. They do a sweet potato salad so I wasn't a huge fan of that but the fried cabbage was absolutely incredible. It's perfectly cooked with sweet, salty and spicy flavors but they throw in fresh peppers, giving it an amazing texture too.

If you're in the mood for desserts, they have a handful of homemade offerings. Unfortunately, the lady who makes peach cobbler was out of town so we didn't get to try that, but we did order some banana pudding. I could tell it was made earlier as the bananas were starting to brown and the wafers were slightly soggy, but the flavor was still very good and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again.

I'm not sure how this place has gone 7 months without making it's way on to Yelp but I sure hope they stick around. Not only do we need good spots to eat in the NW, but Yvonne and company are great. I don't drink sweet tea and even though we were the only ones in the restaurant at the time, she offered to brew unsweetened for me. Above and beyond service like that is hard to find and its much appreciated. Legends Café will certainly be seeing me again!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,14,11,4,NNkihJdMSDYZSRL8hZAn2Q

4157860,2014-05-28,5,MTpPAQrgrWtZLLoa-VLc-w,"The boo found this spot! I am always excited when it comes to BBQ or soul food. (Do I say that alot? I get excited about a lot of things... lol) So we decided to give it shot. I was relieved to find out it was fairly close to us. Located in the shopping center across from the Santa Fe Station Casino where a movie theater used to be. That is now replaced by a church. The Santa Fe Mining Company is in that same shopping center, just go all the way to the back. Honestly we would have never found this place just driving by. 

 Once we got in, we found ourselves to be the only ones there. I don't know why, but that always makes me nervous. Our server, who we came to find out is one of the owners, sat us wherever we wanted. It was actually quite nice being the only ones, meant VIP service ;). So after chatting a bit we found out that there was no BBQ due to complaints regarding the smoke from the smoker. So that left fried foods. I wasn't complaining, I never turn down an opportunity to try fried chicken. (not talking KFC here either) The fried chicken dinner - I opted for white meat which came with a boneless breast and 3 chicken wings. Not the traditional way, but I was going to give it a fair shot. It also came with two sides - I chose mac n cheese and potato salad. The chicken was pretty good. I do enjoy ripping it off the bone, but I found this easy and less time consuming. The breading on the chicken was golden, crispy and delicious! Now as for the sides it was 50/50. The mac n cheese was soooo good. Cheesy, gooey and flavorful. The potato salad was good, but not my cup of tea. I am one for a mustard potato salad and this was a very sweet potato salad. I had 3 or 4 bites and set it off to the side, while I picked up the side of mac and stuck my tongue down the inside of the cup to get the last bit of cheese out. It's so very hard to find good mac n cheese, so hold on to one that you find. I am very much used to getting a corn bread muffin or some type of biscuit with my meal, but this one came with a garlic ciabatta roll. Not bad. I liked the change up. So the ultimate kicker here for me is the desserts. I am probably the biggest peach cobbler fan EVER! I have yet to find that one that will leaving me with late night cravings, so I continue on the hunt. Lucky for me they have it as an option. Sadly not available when we were there. So of course I will be back to try it! We did get the opportunity to enjoy the banana pudding. It was delish. 

I left so full, my pants almost busted. I can't wait to go back and try something else, but I do hope that the complainers in this world will let us have some BBQ soon! BBQ! BBQ! BBQ!",7S2wwOSVSRn4CEZdtQKG_Q,6,3,3,I8R-olLl_mKEgZVNzQfqyg

I got the Catfish meal with Collard Greens and Red Beans. Omg, it was amazing! Then the lady working suggested that I get their Kool-Aid which wasn't just regular Kool-Aid it had Fruit Punch and I think something else  in it and it was one of the best drinks I ever had. Definitely try this place.",ZYJRd-2j-QcQYvSXu5F2ig,0,0,5,aSUrvEGW4b_PYkF4N7Oi8Q

But, over at Legends cafe I was welcomed with friendly attitudes and great food. The ribs were extra tender just what I was looking for. The beans were not my favorite but all in all I will definitely be back. Thank you Yvonne for your help and a nice lunch!",lezrRiKYN5UiCKeHFOY4oA,0,0,5,hMsAPsAc8Z7gQVKYIlrKWA
