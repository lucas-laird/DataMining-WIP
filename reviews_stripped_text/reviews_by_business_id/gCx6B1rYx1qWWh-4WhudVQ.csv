The Sliders were not plain bread and meat but topped with all things burger-licious. Steak fries from scratch and goldenly crispy while our salad was equally fresh and crispy cold. Condiments were fresh and high quality. Having lived in our neighborhood for almost 20 years, we are thrilled to have such an appetizing, affordable alternative to boring pizza and Chinese food. Mac's has extended hours and a good variety of items, including a breakfast menu that we eagerly look forward to trying. Although we ordered on-line, we got a nice phone call informing us that they had run out of an item we'd selected and confirming directions to our house. Even with the call, our food arrived hot and in less time than expected, in spite of being some distance away. Do yourself a BIG favor and ignore the ""hater"" reviews - both, I suspect, written by the same sweet person... Lol",YMTv6GBZXq97G8RHRBLVtw,1,0,5,0upZcKbFelEaBPbncKF3Xw

I ordered for delivery through grub hub and they were 45mins late and gave me no silverware. Good was tepid and unappealing. They thought a soda would be compensation for them being late and I don't even drink soda. Oh and they asked me at the time that they were supposed to already be here if I wanted something other than what I ordered because it was still cooking. Mind you I'm 7 months pregnant and I feel royally screwed. WORST PLACE EVER. Not to mention delivery driver was drunk or high maybe both and looked like a bum.",cwG2zFymTZQI6nmsDxQTrQ,0,0,1,jKtSOAJe1HKU0CYFHWaA8Q

I ordered some chicken wings and they came a little bloody as well as soggy (I had ordered them well done) I told the restuarant and they decided to bring me more wings. The new wings got there and were also soggy. I took them back out to the driver before he left and he tried to explain to me these are as cooked as they can be. I then explained how that is impossible with a fryer at 350 degrees considering if you wanted, you could burn the wings. The driver then got upset and did a burn out in front of the house we had the food delivered to and told me to go ""***"" myself. Mac's Kitchen is a hole in the wall that will burn itself to the ground with their crappy service, lack of skill to fry frozen food, and a staff with bad attitudes. Stay away unless you want food poisoning! The day after I didnt feel too good.",8bAM0gNl1wc0iAHTtmkLmg,1,0,1,O1vidkReID0Be-xuOJU5nw
