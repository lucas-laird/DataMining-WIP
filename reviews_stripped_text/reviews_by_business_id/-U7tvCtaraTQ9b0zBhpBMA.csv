15874,2015-07-24,0,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"Very satisfactory, I don't know why people are so harsh.  

I was actually convinced not to try the buffet dinner last night because the reviews were so negative but decided to try it for lunch today just to see for myself. 

I don't know what people are expecting but I thought it was very satisfactory; some people have compared it to Hometown buffet and that's kind of what I expect for a buffet and actually I thought the food was significantly a little better than Hometown buffet.

On a weekday for lunch it was only about $22 and I thought the meat from the carving station was better than expected. I thought the mashed potatoes and gravy were good and the service was generally good. The pizza and potstickers were the disappointments.

I wished it had a little more variety but I guess the full buffet isn't in effect for a weekday lunch and I didn't even try the desserts and i have read the desert are usually the best part.

I would repeat going if I were in the mood for a buffet. I don't know how much it costs on the weekends but I thought the weekday lunch was reasonable and repeatable. 

I noticed the lines get long if you arrive late. I imagine it could be disappinting if you waited a long time and paid much more on a weekend, but I've noticed many places have long lines at 7pm, even McDonalds.",I4si7UXXAmf4Cqbzi8PU_A,1,0,3,EIrrzP-4ui4womXAuO1j2Q

This is one the latest trends in Las Vegas these days, to entice you to stay around, and perhaps, play some more games in the Casino.  How crafty of them.  I, however, did not play any games, but I did eat, and eat, and eat, all I could eat, 3 times.  My stomach was a bit stretched from that day, I suspect.  Anyway, the food: Not everything was a hit, but most items were good if not very good.     
You just have to keep on eating, and waste the food you don't like.  This is the one place where I don't care about wasting.  It's sin city, built on over indulgence and waste.  What a glutton I was.

Pork with corn pudding - 5 stars
Crab legs - 4  stars

- 4 stars
Chicken Caccitore - 1 star, overcooked, bad sauce

24049,2011-08-19,0,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"When it comes to Las Vegas, one of the attractions is a gluttonous dinner at a casino buffet. Las Vegas is famously known for its buffets. When I was in Vegas years ago, I remember the glorious Caesar's Palace buffet that my family and I ate at, so I was kind of excited to find out that we got a free buffet at the MGM Grand. Sadly, the only saving grace to this buffet was that it came with our hotel room. To any visitors looking for a buffet experience, I HIGHLY recommend that you avoid this place at all cost. I would recommend eating dropped table scraps from the MGM food court before eating at this place... yes it is that bad!

The service was pretty standard when it comes to service at any buffet. Waiter comes in and takes your drink order then you go to town on the food selection. I ended up eating some crab legs, and roast beef at my MGM buffet experience. The crab legs were very tasteless... almost like these legs were thawed from a frozen pack of pre-cooked crab legs that one can buy at their local super market. The texture of the legs was very dry and stringy. One would expect food of this quality at dormitory cafeteria buffet at any University on Tuesday nights, let alone, at Las Vegas. Not tasty at all. The roast beef was so-so. The slices were pretty small, and that beef itself was way overcooked, which lead to the meat being tough. It was a step above dormitory cafeteria food, but also a several steps below an average Golden Corral.

The desserts were better. Its like the typical desserts that you will find at any buffet, such as the self serve ice cream, premade cakes, cookies and such. But then you would expect desserts of this quality at a generic buffet, not at a Las Vegas resort and casino. If you are staying at the MGM Grand and received a free MGM buffet voucher, then by all means, eat the free food. If the only buffet experience that you have ever had was at your undergrad dorm cafeteria, a hospital buffet or at a friend's dumpster eating 3 week old Thanksgiving left overs, then this might be your place to eat, however you will get more bang for your buck at the McDonalds food court on the other side of the building. Otherwise, stay away!!!!!!!",HaMuaI7qxB2bqS9z3z4uGA,2,1,1,hL3yy3sNTnCRNcXw8Vxn1Q

Asian cuisine came out of a frozen foods aisle and sushi looked like it was bought from a shity grocery store. I've been here on two occasions and each time was a huge disappointment. For desserts, I made myself an apple crips with some vanilla ice-cream. The apple crisp tasted like an empty mush with a hint of cinnamon. If it wasn't for the dash of vanilla ice-cream (only a dash because the machine was empty) I probably would have let the whole thing go to waste.

According to my husband, no one can mess up cooking crab legs. I beg to differ. People at my table had prime rib and said it was overcooked. Their sushi section had an okay selection. Stay away from their philly role, teriyaki roll was plain, and tuna roll was great. Their Chinese food section could have been better. I did enjoy their egg rolls though. My husband complimented on their pizza in the Italian section. I enjoyed their dessert a lot right up until I had the pistachio pudding (super plain). I love their red velvet cake. 

Customer service was definitely a miss. Waitress was not great to us and stayed the same throughout the night. The only thing she got right was our drinks and even got milk when we requested it. Other than that, she wasn't that friendly and appeared as if we were taking a lot of her time.

127889,2011-06-08,0,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"We thought the buffet was very pricey. Dinner was $30.00 and we had to wait to long in line.  It was 5:00 and people were coming in for dinner and they did not have enough people working to sit people.  There were open tables and people were getting mad.  My husband is a sushi man and he said that is was very very dry.  He even tried it when they had bought more out and still said it was dry.  The watermelon was not sweet it was tasteless.  I don't think they had a good variety of food or deserts. However, I did like the small portions of the way they did the deserts.  They were small portions so not wasteful if you did not eat it all. They just did not have a variety to pick from.  They did not have any kind of pies or cakes.

I did however, think the way they cut the crab open was great. It looks like they slice it open.  You would think that the MGM and the Rio would be one of the best buffets in Las Vegas but this time that we were here we were disappointed in both of them.  Our favorite was the flamingo.  They have the BEST buffet in Las Vegas and we give them a 5 star for their bufett. 

Would we go there again . Mosty likely NOT to pricey and not the best.

The food you can find is OK, but the selection is minimal.  Noticeably absent is any Asian food.  Looking for fried rice, and maybe some orange chicken?  Not there. You'll notice that their plates are very small compared to other Vegas buffets.  There are two possible explanations for this: either because they want you to consume less food, or to make you feel less ripped off when you look at your plate after traversing the whole buffet and find only 1 or 2 items that were worth putting on your plate.

As far as the service, it was non-existent.  I did not receive a single refill for my drink in the entire time I was there.  My waiter simply vanished, and the other waiters wouldn't help - they just kept telling me that my waiter would be right back.

Unless you want to feel ripped off and have a bad feeling about Vegas, don't go here.  The high prices in Vegas these days usually at least come with a good experience.

Like other LV buffets, MGM Grand Buffet has a wide variety of food to offer: crab legs, prime rib, turkey, ribs, shrimp, pasta, pizza, sushi, so on and so forth.  The prime rib was pretty good but, unfortunately, none of the remaining offerings were particularly special at Grand Buffet.  The crab legs are not as good as Bellagio's or Wynn's.  in fact, I'm not sure if this is a  sign of quality or what, but the crab legs at MGM didn't  pull cleanly out of the shells as they do at the aforementioned Bellagio or Wynn buffets.   I found myself spending too much time trying to pull the meat out of the shells, despite the fact that they are already split cleanly in half. The remainder of what I tried was ok, but nothing special at all.

I go to a LV buffet intent on eating back any money I've gambled away, so I have higher expectations than this.  Like some other casinos, MGM Grand Buffet currently offers a buffet all day long.

My friend and I enjoyed this buffet so much that we went for the brunch a few times and dinner buffet once, during the week of NYE.

The prime rib was juicy and tender and flavorful, and they had the BEST tortilla chips and pico de gallo with just enough of a spicy kick to it. I could have that particular bar placed in my house and be extremely content. They had pretty much everything you could possibly want and I was happy with the quality. (Sushi was only available during dinner buffets which was a bit of a bummer, but if you want sushi, see my review for Sushi House Goyemon.) I will agree their country fried chicken is very tasty and tender, and chicken is not something I normally want when I eat out. Desserts were generally okay. I'm not much of a dessert person but I must say, they had this little triangular chocolate pecan tart which was so good that I smuggled extras in my bag for later :-O Try one, and have a second for me!

Even though there were only 3 people ahead of us in line at the cashier, it took forever because the cashiers were so slow.

I have to give an extra props to the bus staff though because we never had a build up of old plates because they would be there to take them

The food was decent, but nothing super special other than the new York strip steak and the prime rib. They were the only things worthy in my opinion at the buffet. The prime rib was very tender and moist and tasted great. The new York was very well seasoned, and cooked a perfect medium and was very flavorful. Everything else was pretty bland, especially the desserts. Most of them had very little flavor which upset me because the Oreo cheesecake just tasted like mush, and the key lime tart was also very plain tasting.

I found the food to be monotonous and bland.   The exception is the Prime Rib and the fresh crab legs.  Everything else was below average.  I did not pay for the food, and I was STILL disappointed.  With taxes included, dinner for two would run you about $55.  The food is definitely not worth the price.

Service:
I found the service to be mediocre as well.  They line you by party size in one of 5 lines.  From far off, it is reminiscent of a cattle-line.  Apart from this, all the other patrons are hungry as hell and rude; due in part to the size of the lines and long wait times.  Cursing, cutting, and bumping seemed to be commonplace here.

Whomever cooked it, does not know how to cook Asian food. The flavor, ingredients, and ""cutting style"" we're all way off. The really should try to get this right considering all the Asian gaming money at the baccarat tables. The fried rice looked and tasted more like rice-a-roni.

The American style food, ie chicken, mashed potatoes, etc, we're so so and lacked taste. They do have a decent salad selection but I didn't partake. They had some excellent taco ingredients and I made a very good taco but it was the few highlights of the buffet.

The omelette station was awesome. Tell the man what you want on it and he hooks it up. He had six individual pans going at once! Yummy...

Desert is lacking. Where are the pies? I tried two types of their cake that I thought would be good-I was wrong. The carrot cake and the red velvet cake were so so at best. How do you make a tasteless carrot cake?

The food:
I love love love all kinds of melons, and their watermelons and honey melons (or whatever you Americans calls them) were fresh so I had a bunch of them

Their veggie pizza was really yummy, I only wish I had more space in my belly to eat more than one slice (I discovered them after already eating like five plates)

Their sushi station was not impressive; they had three kinds of sushi that all tasted like something I could have bought at Ralphs... veggie springs rolls were a much better choice. 

The vegetarian station was lame. I am not a vegetarian, but I love the food, and I can just imagine the disappointment for someone who actually is vegan or vegetarian. My heart goes out to you girls and boys. They had steamed veggies, and some Indian curry salad, etc, but I did not try it. The hummus was actually pretty good!

Their salads were ok, I really liked their salad with ceasar dressing on it...

The best part of the buffet was their desserts! Small selections of a variety of sweets!

There is really not much I can say negative. I kind of wish the desert section would have had a larger variety, but the red velvet cake was delicious and moist.

923655,2013-01-13,0,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"Having missed out on the traditional, cliched activities expected of travelers to Las Vegas - excessive booze, collecting the entire set of rent-a-floozy trading cards from the Hispanic worthies stationed along the Las Vegas Strip, watching a Celine Dion show and waking up with an embarrassing tattoo, I attempted the one activity that is actually available to those on a ridiculously small per diem: a Las Vegas buffet.

A friend who used to live in Vegas spoke glowingly about the MGM Grand Buffet, so based on his recommendation, a healthy dose of morbid curiosity, and the fact that it was a few dozen feet from the elevator, I chose to check it out.

Things got off to an ominous start when there was a 15-minute wait for a half-full restaurant. Apparently, $32.45 is the price for a meal during the ""slow"" time of week - a little after 8 on a Thursday night. As a reference, the GSA's recommended per diem for meals and incidentals for Las Vegas is $71/day.

I tried to eat things that I don't normally get and that meant mostly protein while avoiding the pizza and carbs. Since the pasta looked singularly unimpressive and the pizza - while having other varieties beyond the usual cheese and pepperoni varieties - they all looked like they'd been under the heat lamp longer than John Boehner in a spray tan booth.

I started with the crab legs and shrimp. The former clearly thawed, but had been cut while frozen in a manner which left the inedible internal tissue firmly wedged within the meat requiring extra effort to separate even with the plastic specialty fork they helpfully provide. The shrimp were deveined and beheaded, but that's it. Even when you think you have all the shell off the bug, there's always a piece left to wedge between your teeth. Not really anything new, they leave the shells on to save money and slow you down so you don't pig out on these, but these were unusually difficult to shell for some reason. At least they were fresh.

Undaunted, I went for the roast beast - blood rare, and just above body temperature - just the way I like it. Mostly tender, but not the most flavorful piece and the graded horseradish did a very thorough job of clearing sinuses that I didn't know I had. This more than made up for the flavorless creamed variety.

After that, it was downhill. The Italian Bread Salad was lacking something, the marinated mushrooms were well oiled, but someone skimped on the other ingredients. The sliced pork in mustard sauce was dry and the sauce watery - both components needing more flavor.

All was not completely lost, the waiter was on his toes clearing plates and refreshing drinks. I tipped him 25% because he was friendly and did his job well. The miniature pastries at the dessert bar were certainly ornamental and clearly that department had the right idea about presentation. What appeared to be freshly-made chocolate and pistachio ice creams were very rich and delicious. However, none of this was enough to make this worth the money.

I could've bought one of the numerous homeless persons distributed across the pedestrian walkways a nice dinner at McDonalds and taken myself to a HomeTown Buffet and come out with a similar gastronomic result and come out about $10 ahead.",4P2tmtkEf2D38qXO0jw0Tg,0,0,2,nSnkRTrYrsxKefbolRn0yg

Stay away from the Asian foods. The hybrid sushi is interesting, but it is too dry to down. The fried rice was only so-so. The hybrid dumplings (which had steak in them) were the only memorable parts of the otherwise ordinary looking Asian foods. Avoid the miso soup(?). (It was a Japanese soup.)

I go to Vegas every Christmas and I've become a seasoned expert on Las Vegas buffets for the past seven years. 

Come here for dinner, avoid breakfast and lunch. As buffets go, most in Vegas are similar and the interior makes a big difference in meal choice. I've been here for Christmas feasts where the price skyrockets to $35 a person, and I've been here for normal dinners. 

There's a great variety of food here. If you know how to eat at buffets, you know the quality of a buffet is largely based on how expensive the food they offer is. Most people are neophytes and don't know this, and they'll go to a buffet to enjoy a plate of fried rice for $20. I enjoy rare prime rib here, and a few years back they had excellent sushi. For some reason about 4 years ago every single buffet in Vegas changed their sushi.

The wait is typically long. Go and look at the lions while having someone in your family wait in line. 

I like the atmosphere here. It's large, spacious, well lit, tables and booths are clean. Buffet tables look nice and food is appealing. Definitely a very grand feel to it. I enjoy it immensely. Service is as good as other Vegas buffets offer. 

5 stars. My favorite dinner buffet in Vegas, but Wynn may be the one exception. Unfortunately, I have not been able to go to Wynn yet due to the dinner line starting at 4:15ish.",dJh6gcvrZR2UqM645CNthw,0,0,5,dKuSJr0TeKX98BTMzUmffg

First off, there is a sign right in front of the Buffet that says some prices in very large writing, so when you walk by the sign you think that is the 'real' prices (i think it says 17.99 during the week and 21.99 for the weekend).  But you have to look at the small print and see that it is on for 'to go' orders.  That threw us off right off the bat.  The real price is $31.00.  So they suckered us in with that sign and i wasn't happy about that.  

Second, the food was blahhh.  Pretty much what you can get at a $9.99 buffet anywhere.  Some of the better things they had were all gone and when i asked how long it would take to cook them and for them to be available they told me 5 minutes.  15 minutes later they still weren't ready.

Exception: the lamb was good as was some of the desserts, namely cheesecake. 

The seafood that they offered, snow crab legs and tiny shell-on shrimp. C'mon, like I feel bad that people actually think snow crab is that tasteless!!

MGM Grand is an amazing but the buffet is the worst buffet I have EVER been to. I've been to many buffets in Las Vegas this is by far the ABSOLUTE WORST BUFFET in history. The mussels were tough, the roast was tough , only thing that was decent was the sushi. The staff is very friendly the price is only $20.99 which is great.

OKAY so not the biggest of buffets and not the biggest selection of foods but what they had was pretty good. Six of us with two kids. Kids instantly went to the sushi rolls, as did a couple of the adults! They were pretty good for a buffet, nice selection of Italian foods and pizzas looked great, grandson said they were thumbs up as he got one slice of each and ate them all. Selection of sausage and prime rib was good, prime rib pretty on the rare side. They had several choices of chicken. Some fish. Crabs legs galore and shrimp. Personally I never made it passed the grilled veggies, beautiful assortment of expertly grilled - braised veggies. Carrots were amazing. Squashes cooked perfectly, several potatoes selections . Green beans the right amount of crunch to softness. So with a big party we lived it. Oh the selection on the desert bar was pretty good, with a nice selection of 2-3 bite pieces. I have to tell you with the veggies, even though I made it to the desert bar and selected 4 pieces I could not finish one film bite. The tiramisu bites awesome! These citrus cup mousse , let's just say OHMY don't pass them up. Lemon drops are amazing! Key lime tarts were super fab with a lining of white chocolate between the pastry and key lime quite the surprise. Never made it back to the bread pudding and it looked amazing,  The coffee don't pass it up, I am a white chocolate mocha gal and I drank this coffee black it was so good!  All in all it was good food, well done and the place was clean. We were here on a Wednesday night, so not Friday or Saturday but we were impressed and the table cleaner ( can't call them server - because they done bring anything except keep the table clean and she absolutely did that).

On that night, they had their standard items, and many stations actually were closed which was disappointing.  They have your usual: carving station, salad bar, seafood, cold dishes, Asian, Italian, Mexican etc.  The carving station had prime rib, roasted turkey, and Polish sausage, which wasn't bad since all were done fairly well.  The gravy and the au jus needed a bit more work since they were somewhat bland.  

As for the seafood selection, crab legs were there and cracked in half for you so that's always a plus.  Few fish items prepared Indian and Italian.  It was good but I wish they had a legit sushi selection rather than just... California roll.

My favorite thing ended up being the pot stickers they had since they were done fairly well.  As for all their other hot foods, everything was... average.  Fried chicken's seasoning was whatever, and the taco station had ground beef that looked like it came from Taco Bell.  Salad bar was lacking as well.  

The funniest thing was that they had hummus but no pita bread or pita chips to eat it with.  I know some people like hummus by itself but if they truly spent the time in preparing the buffet, they would've at least thought of that!

The buffet with tax ended up being $28 exactly which is a bit pricey for the offerings.  Thank goodness I didn't have to pay weekend price for this place or else I would've bumped off another star!

What can I say? It's your typical buffet with the  typical offerings: sushi, seafood, Chinese, pizza, nachos, carving station and desserts. Beverage choices include fountain drinks, beer, wine and $10 more can get you mixed drinks. 

Nothing stood out here that would make me return. I had the Chinese offerings, ratatouille (probably the best dish here), crab (warm), shrimp(prepared for you warm) long wait, 20 mins!

We hit the buffet for dinner, and were very happy with what we saw and tasted.

I made about three trips to the hot crab leg station, and encountered fresh and delicious crab legs every time. 

The craving station had prime rib, turkey, and sausages with an assortment of toppings for the meat.

I also tried the mexican station, featuring chicken faijitas.   The beans looked a little stale, but as I was spooning out the chicken, a fresh batch was promptly put in.

The one time I went by the Italian station, the pastas looked a little tired, but I imagine, like everything else, that they were changed out and constantly freshened up.

The service is very good, and the desserts are amazing.

The dessert bar earns an extra star for the assortments of desserts, along with the numerous toppings for the self serve ice cream.

For $40 each, my friends and I hit up this spot for a quick bite before hitting the town. Needless to say, we were all very unimpressed by the selection of food here. It is very diverse, but also was unappealing and in my honest opinion not very tasty. I like to destroy several plates at a buffet, but here... I only did 1 dish. I wasn't motivated to seek or eat more. Very unfortunate, because the service was decent here. But that doesn't make up for the meal.

I had the assorted seafood, sushi, mixed veggies and some steak. The crab legs were opened which was cool, but very small in proportion. You'd need several to feel like you're eating something. The sushi, as expected, was fishy and the rice was hard from coldness and sitting around. The steak was chewy (I didn't expect it to be filet or anything), and also not flavorful. Everything made my stomach... apathetic, to say?

Nothing here is specifically awful, but for a place as exquisite as the MGM, I would have expected much better out of them. Next time I'm in town I'll play it safe and come for lunch if things seem different.

At $18 per person this was a MAGNIFICENT place to enjoy for lunch.

I am always wary of buffets. I don't eat meat and I am never sure I'm going to be able to get my money's worth.

I am going to make a point to eat here every time I visit Las Vegas. The mushroom ravioli especially was, hands down, THE very best ravioli I'd ever eaten, and I've eaten $50 a plate ravioli from an upscale restaurant. The Grand Buffet blew that out of the water.

The desserts were amazing. Raspberry tiramisu, key lime pie, creme brulee, all in adorable single size servings. Next time I go I'm not going to eat for a week beforehand.

Also, $20 for a bucket of ice cold beer was pretty reasonable.",R4kzxO9q31DmW1Ib63Jsnw,0,0,5,e5tjv6JrqL7kOxuu1ST6UQ

I honestly found myself filling my stomach with plates full of mac and cheese. The quality of food was okay but the crab legs and seafood just wasn't what I expected. 

The one thing that saved this fiasco of a dinner buffet was the dessert section. This section, yet small and secluded, offered some tasty pastries and desserts that I actually enjoyed. Now this wasn't amazing, but it did help me feel better about spending money on this buffet.

I must say that one good thing about this buffet is that it was kept clean and was well maintained. The staff was also fast at giving us refills and clearing our tables of plates and silverware. So overall, my experience with the service was good, but the ambiance and atmosphere was filled with noises from the casino.

We decided to partake of the all-day buffet price of $30 during the week since we were staying at the MGM. It was a good option for us because we wanted to stay at the pool that day. However, it seems hard to fit three meals into the day unless you get up before 9 AM. The breakfast closes at 11 and lunch closes at 2:30, I think. 

We wanted to have some breakfast since we'd been skipping it all week we were in town. The crepe lines were long and people were fairly pushy. It made you question the whole buffet thing. I mean people, there is enough to go around! 

In general, I would say that the food here is edible if you choose carefully, but there is nothing with perhaps the exception of dessert which is truly good. It's all bland and doing the all-day buffet makes you feel a bit queasy by the end of the day. 

The best bits were the fresh melon, the mini-desserts at the dinner buffet which were tasty and even artistic with white chocolate shavings and other details. They were stingy with the crab and shrimp which was annoying. You have to ask and it is given reluctantly.

Best things I had:

1) mini carrot cake complete with cream cheese frosting, it was nicely spice and how carrot cake is supposed to be.

2) peel and eat cold shrimp and snow crab legs. The crab was sweet, the shrimp were nicely flavored. They both tasted fresh and not fishy.

3) fresh fruit the melon, strawberries and pineapple were all juicy and flavorful.

Mediocre things:
1) steamed veggies....they were a little on the soggy side.

2) tiramisu cup, there was hardly any lady finger in it :( that's the best part!

3) cappuccino mouse, very rich....but a lot of clear brownish fluid was in a pocket in it....not sure if it just wasn't mixed good or what?

4) black beans, they're kind of hard to screw up :)

Could have been okay but.....

1) Chili Relleno. The cheese filling was good, but there was wayyyyy too much breading on it which did nothing but retain too much grease....if there would have been less breading and not as greasy this would have fallen in the category above.

2)peanut butter cream puff. Dry, kind of defeats a ""cream"" puff.

Yuck:

1) crab salad....I don't know if it was imitation crab meat, or old crab... but this was fish and gross...the crab was also rubbery.

2) California roll, ewww gross. I actually spit this out into my napkin. It was so fishy it made me gag a little before I spit it out!

3) mac n cheese pretty bland and gooey....I think maybe they made it with generic velveta?

So, that's the run down of what I ate, about all I could fit in my tummy. So, in my opinion stick to the peel and eat shrimp and crab :) Not sure about the other meats because I don't eat it.....my hubby said they were okay, not the best, not the worst.

$40 Dinner Buffet on Tuesday Night.

My family and I were staying at the MGM Hotel so it was easy for us to come here for an early dinner before our flight back home. There was no wait and we were seated very quickly by the dessert section. I have eaten here twice now, but forgot that I had tried it before until I roamed the different food stations.

From what I can remember, starting from the left side of the buffet, there is a:
Taco station where you can build your own fajita/soft taco, 
Italian station with things like lasagna, ravioli, chicken parm. (which I really liked)
Fruit Station: cantaloupe, watermelon, pineapple
Seafood: Crab Legs, mussels, smoked salmon, shrimp
Chinese: Egg rolls, etc.
Salad: Make your own salad
American: fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mac & cheese, corn
Sushi: Few different variety
Mexican: Enchilada, Tostado, Chimichanga
Meat Carving station
Dessert Station

What was interesting was that I think there were at least 2 or 3 different areas where you could grab tortilla chips (with nacho cheese, guac, salsa, etc) - that must be a hit with diners.

In the middle sections, there were a variety of side dishes. My personal favorites were the mac and cheese (very cheesy and so much better than any other buffet mac and cheese that I've ever tasted) and roasted potatoes. 

The salad bar was small for a buffet but I guess paying the higher prices, you'd want to fill up on other things anyway. 

My friends all gushed about the dessert bar but seeing as my sweet tooth is barely existent, it didn't entice me. There were quite a few choices for those that do like desserts though.

He was first sent back to the table because you can't bring the mimosa glasses back to the bar for refills, you have to leave them on your table and get new ones each time. Then, he couldn't get two at a time, because they have a one drink per person policy. That was understandable, so I went up and asked for another mimosa, and the guys carded me! I hadn't been carded the first time, and my husband didn't get carded (and neither did anyone else I saw go up, so that was a little annoying). I didn't have my ID with me, so my husband had to go up a fourth time to get me the mimosa! It was a little ridiculous, since I had already been served one.

We ate here on a Saturday night, but for some reason several of the food stations were closed and they were running short staffed. It took forever to get a soda - which wasn't included in the price. At the salad station the only plates available were steaming hot from the dishwasher. It felt like no one in management cared about the guest's experience.

Not to mention the cake was DELICIOUS!!!! I also didnt realize this until the Best Lady said something after dinner but I reserved for an area and they literally closed that whole area off for us, it was really nice of them!

The food itself wasnt what I remembered. They only served chilled crab legs (last time I went was for Easter a few years back, maybe that's why they had more that day) which were good but I wanted warm crab legs too! Their Chicken Parm was DELICIOUS. I also heard the tacos were delicious. I didnt get a chance to try much food but the things I did have were really really good.

We decided to try the hotel's buffet for breakfast on our second morning since we were staying at the MGM Grand while on vacation in Las Vegas. We had breakfast at MGM Grand's Buffet twice during our weeklong vacation because it was delicious.

The setting was comfortable, not overcrowded, and the decor was up-to-date and clean. The friendly, professional servers attended to the tables continually checking to see if you needed anything and removing empty plates.

A wide variety of breakfast foods, cold salads, sushi, and pastries was available. Stations with chefs were present to create fresh waffles and omelets to your taste. There were many different styles of eggs, including delicious eggs benedict, bagels and lox, several varieties of sausages, Mexican dishes, oatmeal, cream of wheat, french toast, breakfast meats,  and more. Juices, coffee, teas, soda, milk, and carbonated-flavored waters were available, too.

The price ranges from $11.00 to $30.00. I don't know where the $11.00 comes in, but we paid $30.00 for breakfast. It was worth it as you can tell from the pictures. The only other buffet that I recommend is Studio B Buffet at the M Resort in Henderson, but I didn't have their breakfast buffet, just their lunch buffet. Thirty-dollars is reasonable considering the cost of other buffets along the Strip.

I would recommend MGM Grand Buffet for breakfast, hence, my 4-star rating.",1TDWijIdzLvyTGSsi_4CTw,0,0,4,wZ1kkEiV0HDWpH5OcLrBtg

The highs:
-Prime Rib was on point! I enjoyed mine at a beautiful medium-rare but if you like it more done (like my girlfriend) they will be happy to sear it off on the flat top to your liking.
-Nachos! This buffet has a bubbly, gooey vat of nacho cheese sauce near a larger tray of chips by their Mexican station where you can customize it with fresh salsas and guacamole.
-Orange chicken was really great! Sometimes fried food in sauce can get soggy when left out but this offering was very crispy and held its integrity while still being smothered in tasty sauce.
-The peel 'n eat shrimp was fresh and tasty. Add a squeeze of lemon and a cup of cocktail sauce and you're set!

The lows:
Unfortunately there were a few things we didn't enjoy (not everything can be perfect)
-The cheese enchiladas should be avoided. The sauce was reminiscent of taco bell mild sauce, which is not something that goes smothered over limp enchiladas.
-The desert was lackluster. I did like the apple cobbler but that's all that was good. The sorbet was overly sweet and the pastries were lacking in flavor and on the dry side.

I know what MGM Resorts is capable of and I know they can improve their offerings. Overall in would highly recommend this buffet on the abundance of the great offerings and value for the money. I will definitely be coming back on my next visit.",xYSo81VK4lmgHws1enyBVA,0,0,5,OrUmx4H03W25WpnPEJo5Tg

The crab legs were great.  He takes them right out of the boiling pot and onto a plate.  The beef was dry but I took the last couple of end pieces since I was too lazy to wait for the new stuff to come out.

Their Italian section really sets them apart.  They have cheese stuffed pasta, fresh (not flat) pizza, chicken parm, and a few other things.  The American section has the usual friend chicken, mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, etc., but they just had a fresher look to them than what you typically see at a buffet.  The Asian section felt about the same, and the desserts had a good selection without being obnoxious, cheap sugar.

TIP:  I received a $150 food credit with my reservation at Monte Carlo.  Since Monte Carlo is owned by the MGM Grand, I was able to use the credit to pay for the meal.

TIP II:  You can walk up the exit at any buffet in Vegas and ask them if you can have a look around before buying.  The quality varies widely between casinos and some are worth a few dollars more.

The price included unlimited champagne/mimosas, which for me, made the pricing more than fair.  They did not have fried shrimp, which I love, but had plenty of other options to make up for it.

Their brunch/lunch menu included prime rib, pizza, fried rice, thai chicken, tilapia, sushi, eggs, bacon, and various other breakfast/lunch items.  They also had a dessert bar that looked good, but I personally did not try.

I read some complaints about their service, but we did not run into any issues.  Our mimosa/water glasses were refilled promptly, and often without even needing to ask.  Our empty dishes were cleared by the time we returned from seconds/thirds/fourths, and the entire place in general seemed clean and well kept.

The line was long, but I can't really fault them for being crowded.  We didn't wait any longer than we had to, and with buffets, waiting in line is cancelled out by not having to wait for your food to be cooked/served.  Overall, I probably would have given this place 4 stars if they had fried shrimp.  3 or 3.5 stars since they did not.  I would return/recommend.",TXtbnji8gip70yu1-tPm_w,3,1,3,IHowes2nz_FLQjygF_Garw

- pastries section with toaster to toast your ish (muffins, scones, bagels, etc)
- small selection of sushi
- mexican-style food section
- omelettes made on-order

With the consolidation of most hotels to pretty much four main companies in the strip, buffets no longer have a uniqueness to them. 

I remember being amazed as a child but as an adult and after visited other buffets in Vegas, I was sad to see that this place has lost a bit of its luster. 

I will add though that the service has always been great! 

If you're in the MGM and have a huge appetite, then you've come to the right place. 

If you play slots or tables, you'll want to join their players card and earn a free meal as well as discounts to their rooms. What's good is you can earn comps at any of the MGM properties and redeem at their other spots.

There are (dungeness) crab legs and prime rib every night, and a reasonable variety of cuisines (Asian, Italian etc.) to choose from. The dessert station includes a soft serve machine and sundae bar.

I can't understand people who say the buffet is overpriced. What are you comparing it to - some local all you can eat buffet in Alabama? Compared to the other Vegas strip hotel buffets MGM is on the cheaper side. For example they're asking $36 for dinner, while Wicked Spoon (Cosmopolitan) charges $50 and Bacchanal (Caesar's) charges $60 for dinner. That's a huge difference when you're a party of 4 or more.

The great thing about MGM is that there's no long wait. For example Bacchanal had a 5 hour waiting list on the 24th and shortest line this week that we saw was about 1,5 hours. I'm really not prepared to wait that long in line to eat, no matter how good the food is. The same long line story goes for most of the buffets on the strip. In MGM the longest we waited was for 15 minutes and that's a great perk when you're hungry!

The service is really uneven. The first time we got this great waiter who kept bringing us champagne until we were quite tipsy before 12 pm. But usually the staff had so much to do and run around that we really didn't get good service. It seems they're understaffed.

All in all if you're hungry on the Strip, don't want to wait for a long time, don't want to pay too much and you're not far away then this place satisfies your needs.",ZqyhDb4SSK1gaK8PGKd_jQ,0,0,3,nc4WrCnmqa6PSEoUrxN_XQ

Dinner was a hit for me - crab legs were fat and meaty, prime rib nicely medium rare.  Lots of selections - asian, mexican, continental.  Fabulous dessert bar with really really good ice cream and beautiful little desserts.  
Our server was quick to refill drinks and clear plates

Breakfast, less impressive, they need to have more than one person preparing eggs/omellettes to order.  Corned beef hash was disappointingly dry.  Fruit selection mediocre.  Biggest hit for me was the yogurt with fat bluegerries/raspberries.  Again, server was very good.

Intro: got in quick (buffet-no lines) and got seated by a nice waitress. Got drinks quick

Selection: Lots more then something like Ryan's or Golden Corral that's for sure. it had asian, american, italian, desserts, etc. 

Taste: Most of the items I got tasted good. I did not like the penne pasta though the saue was way too high pitched. I like my pastas to have a low pitch and my pizzas to have a high pitch. This place got both in reverse. The Swai fish was my fav item there. Tasted really good. I had a lot of it. I also liked the ""tit ravioli"" it really looked like tits. LOL. but it was good. I also liked the turkey and I normally hate turkey. 

Service: My sister has Celiac disease. She can not have gluten and the chef there was really professional and he was able to show her exactly what she can eat and since he made it he knows how it was made. Very nice. Buffets are next to impossible for her and this was awesome for her to be able to partake in a buffet. 

Overall: Highly recommended and very good. pricey though.

Overall this place is probably better than most buffets in our hometown. They always have fresh food because they have a steady flow of people coming in and out. There's also a wide selection of food. 

Don't come here expecting the best buffet ever, but if you are hungry and want a wide selection of food or cant decide on where to eat, this is not a bad place.

Everything seems kind of dreary compared to the top  buffets.  When it comes to food, taste is everything of course, however a good portion of that is going to depend on how well the food is presented to you.  The presentation of the food here is pretty sad.  Salads looked like they've been stagnant and out for a while, the prime rib and turkey looked dry at the carving stations, the desserts looked like something you'd get from Denny's. etc.

the only unique thing that the buffet offers was a mashed potato bar.  Pretty good and something I've never seen before.  They basically take an ice-cream scoopful of mashed potatoes and fry them up w/ all your fixings that you'd  normally have in a baked potato (bacon, chives, cheese, mushrooms, etc.).

I made a few mistakes prior to coming tonight admittedly. Mistake number one, check Yelp! Two, check Yelp! Had I done this prior I would have saved myself $35. Yes another mistake made... I chose to put the tip on my credit card prior to service! FYI folks- probably best not to do this, especially here. Why you ask? Well you serve your own drinks. Your plates pile on the table until someone bothers to come by and take them after passing 20 times. So, you deserve your tip. You get your food and drinks and basically wait on yourself. 

Now if you have ever gone to a buffet before that's not extremely busy you know the food sits there forever!!! Not here... I watched them change out almost full trays of food. They got a star for that. Even though the food I ate didn't taste great. Especially some being so bad I had to spit it out. Example: Red potato pieces so cooked they were black!!! Not just toasted but charred to the point of being inedible. 
The other star I gave them was for the food being labeled vegetarian or gluten free. That is a extremely nice touch most places don't think of going to for people like myself who are vegetarian. I really appreciated that aspect. 
Being an ex pastry chef I alway am drawn to Vegas buffet dessert sections. This one let out the looser horn ... BIG TIME!!!! For being MGM Grand there was nothing Grand about this buffet or dessert section!!! It was awful!!! It can be compared to something you would find at a nursing home. By far the worst I have seen here in Vegas.

fake scrambled eggs with onions and bell peppers...COME ON!

I paid the about $25 for my meal, I had come in just as brunch ended. I had brought a few things to keep me company, as I was dining alone because the rest of my party was at the photography conference. I figured the buffet was a safer place than roaming around the casino. 

I was seated in a corner booth away from most of my fellow buffet-ers and was greeted warmly and asked my beverage selection. She refilled my soda and water once. And that was the end of that. I vaguely remember her telling another table that her shift was over but she never let me know. 

The buffet at MGM is about half the cost of the Baccanal Buffet, with about 1/3 of the selection. I did the walk around, to see what they had and found it to be lacking. There was an entire section they were not using. They had a few Mexican dishes, a few Asian dishes, a salad bar, a few kinds of sushi, what looked like leftover breakfast rolls, a few pastas, the usual chicken, and other sides... And this weird deli sandwich area thing... Which I've never seen at a buffet, not even hometown. They had a roast guy with... I think it was prime rib and some sausage, but both were ""meh.""

I ended up needing to use the restroom during my meal and learned that there wasn't one inside the buffet. I asked if I could return after and a busser said I could. I was a little nervous they would clear my table, so I left my book and notebook there with a ""will be back, please don't clear this stuff."" I returned easily, but came back to find the table cleared and my books gone!

I got a plate of fruit (which wasn't very ripe) and waited in hopes that the servers would come by the now deserted section so that I could flag them down. But alas, no. I lost my appetite and decided to leave, upset that the MGM Grand didn't have a Grand Vegas Style buffet.

2779048,2010-04-01,3,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"It boggles my mind that MGM Grand can have such a rip off of a buffet and get away with it.  I guess having a giant casino and a lot of hungry clients walking out of Ka or just lots of gambling will do it.

It's not that the food is terrible; it's actually fairly decent, and there is a very large selection.  My concern here is why I'm spending $33 for corn dogs, fried chicken, and a do-it-yourself burrito section with dry beef and greasy beans.  You could get those items in a $10 lunch buffet these days.

That being said, it's not like they're completely devoid of decent food.  The day I went, there was a section where a chef will cut you a new york steak or a prime rib.  There was another section for king crab.  The issue here is that those items aren't anything special these days; The Mirage offers those as well for around $25.  Even worse is that the chefs were quite stingy with their meat, cutting me a small piece and telling me to come back later (presumably after stuffing myself with microwavable corn dog bites).

It seems to me that compared to more economical but quality buffets like the one at The Mirage, you're paying about $10 more for a larger selection at MGM Grand Buffet.  But the ""selection"" we're talking about here is crap you could get from Hometown Buffet... hardly something I'd want to waste my time waiting in line for in Las Vegas.

Bottomline: If you're going to spend over thirty bucks for a buffet, go to the Bellagio or Wynn instead.  If you really must eat in MGM, go to one of their restaurants or even their food court with McDonald's.  Avoid the buffet.",1GgldkdtUkRfl3_84w3-Aw,6,2,2,bOlBfmqFNPIMqHK4hrYFRQ

2802299,2014-07-24,0,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"BREAKFAST ONLY REVIEW:

If I were rating the breakfast service at the MGM buffet based solely on the 3 items I filled up on, I would rate it 5 stars. The buffet serves a grand variety of breakfast foods though, so actually rating the buffet with 5 stars would be biased and unfair. 

My experience at the buffet started on a sour note because we arrived hungry at 7:20 a.m. but could not dine yet because we needed to redeem our Vegas Slots ""2 for 1"" buffet reward first. This wouldn't have been a problem if the Mlife area where you redeem the coupons didn't open until 8 a.m. After a night of drinking, waiting 40 minutes on an empty stomach---while watching happy diners cheerily stuff their smiling faces at the buffet---was miserable. I was grouchy. If the buffet opens at 7 a.m. and the only place that people can redeem their rewards to eat is at the Mlife station, shouldn't Mlife open at 7 a.m.? 

Once my dining partner and I stepped into the buffet, I breathed a sigh of relief. The fruit selection was lovely and every choice was sweet, succulent, and refreshing. MGM surprised me with how fresh their fruit was. One giant plate of honeydew, watermelon, and pineapple slices later, I was ready for the heartier side of breakfast. 

I'm not a fan of savory breakfasts so I steered clear from the bacon, eggs, and Mexican offerings. I snagged a bite of my mom's omelette from the made-to-order omelette station, and the two of us agreed that it sucked. It was under-seasoned and just ""blech.""

I served a big plate of cottage cheese topped with plenty of strawberry compote. The pancakes and waffles looked pretty good and there was a variety of sweet toppings to choose from for your breakfast goods! The cottage cheese and strawberry compote combination was surprisingly excellent. The cottage cheese tasted great with the very fresh, not-too-sweet compote! I ate the same cottage cheese and strawberry compote combination at the Mirage's Cravings buffet the previous day and I'm not sure which buffet served a better compote! I truly enjoyed both. 

I also ate a mini apple pastry that was flaky, buttery, fresh, and good enough for seconds and thirds. Perhaps sticking to the sweeter breakfast options is the way to go at the MGM Grand buffet.",Yl49udA0AG_bkw0AbDL5vA,5,0,3,ceg1zIx1eGvlkYDKdZ_l4A

           Being my first ever Las Vegas buffet, I had no idea what to expect. We showed up right at 3 when they start their Dinner Buffer with a Group of 12. My wife and I had a BOGO offer which made everything that much more worth it. Our group was seated fast and we were off to the races. Most of us started with their Complimentary Beer/Wine selection. They offered two domestic draft beers and 3 low end wines. They also offer a bigger selection but at a price. 
               On to the carving station, no wait! CRAB LEGS! I almost made a crucial mistake. Luckily I was able to correct it before it happened. One massive plate of crab legs please! more.... more.... OK! Thanks! I was told once that crab legs is how you get your money's worth. So I made sure to do so. NOW on to the carving station! Prime Rib or Brisket? both please. The man at the carving station was so friendly and offered advice to which sauces were his favorite. I get back to my table and proceed to continue this amazing and glutinous meal! 
                Round three....? I hadn't really gone around the buffet to see what they actually had to offer as i came in knowing the two things i had to get. So as i was just walking around seeing all of the delicious foods i was too full to try, one of their employees walked about asking if i had any questions. I asked him, what his favorite foods were that i should try. He sort of side smiled and asked me to follow him. He introduced me to a chef standing near a huge seafood stand. Telling me he is one of the best chefs the MGM has to offer. The Chef asked me ""do you like everything?"" in which i replied ""of course"". He gave me an acknowledgment of sorts and i knew i was in for a treat. He was like a mad Scientist adding all sorts of seafood, and sauces, and spices. 15 minutes later, my dish is ready. It was massive! Full of swordfish, crab legs, crawfish, shrimp, clams, mussels all of which was sitting in the most amazing creamy broth. I shared the plate with my table and everyone loved it. If i were to return i would probably start with that! 
             In closing, the buffet food itself was good. None of their food that didn't have someone tending to it directly was anything special. The kicker was the stuff that was being tended to by their incredibly friendly, welcoming staff. They made the experience that much more pleasant.

They did have food from American, Asian, Mexican, and dessert. 

All I ate there was:
- California Sushi Rolls
- Fried Chicken
- Orange Chicken
- Slices of turkey with gravy
- Swirl Ice Cream

The food here was alright. They didn't have that much good food for me to eat. Also seems the food was not fresh at all. Some of the hot  food was dry. Very disappointed. This buffet has the self serve drinks of Coka Cola Freestyle soda machine, coffee, and hot teas.

As for the staff here, they were not happy to work there. Some of them didn't have a welcoming happy face. They did however did their jobs. The server for our table just takes our finished dishes out of our table.

I recommend to eat somewhere else. On our dinner night, each person is about $43 each person. Not worth it. Eat somewhere else that is much fancier, nicer staff, and better food.",fTt_rcnc-nNpjWaDrbvEow,1,0,3,_vUMY677mHTx1-Qfl2Irxw

I read wrong,  it's $22.69 for a Friday lunch and if you want endless cocktails is an extra $12.99. I missed breakfast due to an early work meeting so was hoping to get some here (i love eggs,  so breakfast is my favorite meal). I noticed that at 12:15pm  the sections looked like they would have breakfast were already closed and empty except for an omelet bar and a variety of breakfast rolls. I got one but it seemed like the omelet chef was just closing up so the choices were very limited. His child area at this point was a complete mess and the chef seemed out of it. The omelet itself was packed with cheese and a bit overcooked. Second round was Chinese with sushi.  Now I've eaten lots of Chinese food but never had orange chicken where the chicken pieces were as big as good balls, very deep fried and not very tasty.  I also got some potstickers (over cooked and bland), teriyaki beef (big juicy and rather tasty pieces), two variety of eggrolls (nothing special) and a variety of sushi (sushi section is very limited and is just California rolls types, not good at all). The Chinese food here makes Panda Express look like a five star restaurant. Next some tri tip(decent,  a bit dry and salty) buttered cooked carrots (undercooked), kiobasa sausage (very juicy and flavorful) and fried chicken (thick fried oily breading,  chicken itself was moist but KFC and/Popeyes makes better grief chicken). And lastly a variety of deserts from cookies,  a variety of rice Krispy treats,  cheesecake bites,  tarts and lots more. They have some gelatto and soft serve.  I tried about 8 different things,  to many to want to describe all of them and they all seemed like they weren't sey enough or as flavorful add they should have been.  Overall what i liked the most was the omelet and found the rest mediocre at best. They have lots of other items that i didn't try just because it didn't look appealing to me and i can only way so much.

On our first morning in the MGM Grand Hotel, we opted to go for the buffet breakfast, and it was incredible! The buffet costs $17.99 per position (excluding tax), but if you are smart travellers like us, then you should take advantage of the hotel's MLife loyalty scheme, which entails playing the MyVegas Slots and MyVegas BlackJack apps on Facebook or iPad. These apps enable you to obtain loyalty points, which can be redeemed for rewards such as: free buffet breakfasts or dinners, monorail tickets, 2 for 1 drinks, room discounts, etc, etc. The rewards can be for most participating hotels on The Strip, so you are not just restricted to the hotel you are staying in. For anyone visiting Vegas, then I wholeheartedly recommend using these apps to make the most of your visit. There are some T&Cs to consider, like you can only redeem three rewards within a 30 day period, but using them for 2 for 1 show or buffet tickets would be my advice, and totally worth it!

Anyway, back to the breakfast buffet! It was fantastic! We redeemed our first reward, which was free buffet breakfasts for two. The buffet had a massive selection of pastries, cold meats, rolls & bagels, cereals, fruit, bacon, sausages, scrambled egg, omelettes, waffles and pancakes, and a bunch of delights from all other cuisines. If you wanted, you could even have pizza for breakfast!

The buffet has basic service, which means you are shown to your seat, drinks order taken and plates cleared away. Therefore a normal service too is sufficient. The buffet also included complimentary soft drinks and coffee. However for an additional cost of $12.99 you can get unlimited drinks (within 2 hours), which includes champagne, beer, wine, other alcoholic beverages. I think this is applicable for the dinner buffet, but there is nothing stopping you adding this to your breakfast order. It is Vegas after all!

When offered a buffet, I like to enjoy a heart meal set me up for the whole day. Therefore, with a coffee, I had bacon, scrambled egg, pork sausages, corned beef hash and chorizo with potatoes. I am a big fan of bacon, and it was nice thin rashers cooked to a crispy goodness. Heaven! I seldom eat pork sausages as I am a Bratwurst kinda guy, but these were really nice and a good quality. The whole combination was a good mix and the quality was a very high standard. The chorizo hash was a little spicy for me in the morning, but still tasty! I also sampled a breaded mozzarella ball, and I had a portion of waffles and pancakes with blueberries and syrup, which was a really nice, sweet and fluffy breakfast. During my second visit, I sample a vanilla cheesecake; that was awesome! I love cheesecake, and I have pretty high standards when it comes to cheesecake. If they serves this in the evening then I would come for the dinner buffet.

The only thing we had that was not good was the Miso Soup, it was simply bland foggy water with a few pieces of seaweed, no tofu & no seasoning. 

Overall, it is a lot better than the Palace Station Buffet, but not worth what the MGM  charges. I still prefer the Circus Circus Buffet, greater selection for half the price.  The Paris Buffet is better than the MGM, for about the same price.",vxz482abBAYkSrjkoyXkXQ,1,0,3,YWD8Lqd48Rc_KKP9FW9AZw

The staff was friendly and the wait wasn't long. 

Once seated, I went to explore the food fare!

The breakfast buffet had an omelette bar, carving table with Portuguese sausage and ham. There was a bagels and lox bar, waffles, pancakes, cold cuts, grits, crepes with assorted fruit, cereal oatmeal, soft serve ice cream, and many assorted mini desserts, muffins, and I ordered the all I can drink menu, so beer to go with all my food seemed good to me!

Now, I didn't get to try all of the food items but I did like the food I did eat.

I'll be honest, this buffet didn't really have a lot of offerings than other places I've been too, but I feel like this place is a ""less is more"" menu selection so one doesn't feel to overwhelmed walking about trying to decide what to eat.

I like the simple choices and the waitstaff were friendly and fast.

Arrived at the counter, no line, and redeemed my reward, however, was told that Breakfast IS Brunch at the time; the time was 8:41am. The giant poster on the wall says Breakfast from 7am-9am. I was charged $1.32, for what, I don't know, and $31.67 for Brunch, plus tax. Still, $35.71 for two people is not bad, but that's not the point. I wanted to redeem my reward for breakfast, which is less, and was told I couldn't. It was, simply, not an option at the time. I reminded the cashier that it was before 9am and the reward clearly states breakfast OR brunch. I did ask for a manager, and one never showed after we sat.

The food is hit and miss. The eggs were runny, assuming because they were powdered eggs and too much water was added. Best bet is a freshly made omelet. The seafood is abundant, but I stayed away from it; too early for me and did not look too appetizing. The fried Twinkies was different, not too bad. The biscuits and gravy, always good. The corn beef hash looked good, but ended up being a bit dry; go ahead and add some hot sauce or even gravy ;)

Some bread based items were extra dry or hard; croissant, french toast, the mini Belgian waffles.

The people are typical of a cruise ship buffet; many coughing, especially children who don't cover their mouths. People that pile on food as if it's going away. Pace yourself, there's plenty. 

Overall, not the worst, but not the best. If you're staying within MGM, Cravings is a bit better. If you want higher end, Wynn, which is where we'll stay next time, again.",hZ4UPfevTepGokqSudBNcw,7,0,2,MQLgOQ9ef-dqshd2dFKWkw

If you are a local there is a locals discount during the week which is about $30.00 a person . The good news about going during the week is they still serve crab legs during dinner and it isn't as crowded as the weekend. 

I liked the fact that during dinner you not only get the crab legs but they can make you Pan Roast (seafood cooked in a red broth served with rice) to order. They only sprinkle a little rice in it but you can add more white rice it is near the Pho. Yes there is also Pho (Vietnamese soup) for those who love soup like I do especially in this chilly weather. The Pan Roast had a nice kick to it and it was super tasty but I think it could do without this pink and white seafood block they put in it though.  They also have a Cajun type of stew with corn ,sausage , shrimp that is pretty good too. Dinner and brunch both have creative salads to choose from.

I thought $30 was fair for the variety of food and the overall quality. The line can get pretty long around brunch time. I tried going around 9am for brunch and the line to pay and to get seated was way too long. If you go at an odd hour, say 7am for brunch you'll probably get in quick. 

Service was nice. They do a good job at picking up your plates when you leave the table. That always seems to be a problem at buffets, but not here. 

On to the food! The brunch food was pretty disappointing in comparison to dinner. The bacon was soggy and the powdery scrambled eggs were just... not eggs. I noticed they had an omelette station but I'm not the biggest fan of omelettes. I probably should have just gotten made to order eggs, which I suggest you do if you want ""real eggs."" I didn't really try any of the lunch items but they had a decent assortment of salads, pastas, potatoes, and meats. My brunch experience was pretty meh and I would highly recommend just coming for dinner.

Dinner was great! It might have been because it was my first night in Vegas and the excitement was just oozing out of me but the dinner was awesome. They have such a huge selection during the dinner time from sushi, to grilled fish, SEAFOOD!!!, prime rib, pastas, roasted potatoes, veggies, and the list goes on and on. The seafood was probably my favorite part. Their fresh shrimp and mussels was actually good! You can definitely judge a buffet place by their seafood and MGM's seafood was good. They have an area where you can get your seafood cooked. I got some steamed crab legs and this was delicious. You can even add a garlic butter sauce to your cooked seafood.

The offerings on the buffet are fairly dull. Not a lot of flavor to any of the dishes. The only items worth checking out are shrimp & crab legs.

Service was crap.  The food was alright - as a vegetarian I had some novel options but wasn't really excited about anything.

One interesting item they had was the curry empanada, but it was just a bunch of the outer shell and a tiny bit of curry. If you had the option to do so, I'd pick either Wicked Spoon, Bellagio, or Bacchanal buffet since they have some interesting selections of food and their quality (and price) is higher.

Overall I'd recommend this place if you are nearby and too lazy to walk to the other buffets. It isn't the worse, but it isn't the best either.

$30 for the brunch PLUS another $8 for the dranks. Tax, tip, almost 50 bucks per person for this buffet, and being married multiplies that to 100 bucks. I was stuck because we were with a group so I decided to just enjoy myself. 

Fat chance. Food was bland and gross. Not a single bite made me OMG. I hate to waste food but took one bite and passed on several things. ""Indian"" food? I think not, and I was kicking myself for not knowing better.

Long lines and waits Thanksgiving evening and $40 a head to get a meal.  The food was okay but nothing I would ever pay that amount for again.  Food lines are hectic and people are so rude and can't wait their turn to access the food (not the buffet's fault) but it makes getting your meal like a foot race to fill your plate before someone else grabs that last chicken leg in the pan.  Staff there really do nothing for you, as a diner, except remove your plate but it seems like tipping is expected...for what?   
Brunch was okay and lots of choices but once again, don't expect a great breakfast or lunch and then you won't be disappointed.  Vegas isn't a great value when it comes to food and because new customers come in every day and don't likely return to the same restaurant, there's no real real reason to change things up for the better.  We have casinos outside of Denver that offer great buffets including endless prime rib and crab legs for $25.  How do they offer better fare for less money?  Because Coloradans will stop patronizing them if the food isn't that great and they rely on repeat customers.  And the casinos there are smoke free...gotta love it!

We still love coming to Vegas and visit regularly....we just continue to learn where to eat a great meal for a reasonable price and this buffet won't be on our repeat list....sorry MGM.

For a buffet that cost $43-45 per head I would have expected more. The brisket was dried out and tough. The shrimp were okay but one a few pieces felt warm to the touch to I decided not to eat anymore. It was bottomless mimosas, but it tasted like the orange juice had been sitting out or something because it had a very bitter taste to it. So bottomless meant a couple of sips. The eggs Benedict on waffle was bad because the waffle was soggy and the sauce had no flavor and since it's on a buffet line the eggs is not poached and runny but rather a hard boiled egg. 

I usually am very happy to leave a good tip at a buffet because the waiters usually come around and clear plates and provide us with drinks.

We all know that Vegas buffets are hit-and-miss at best depending on what you like.  I tend to lean towards healthy alternatives so I look at a salad bar and the items in includes with a pretty critical eye.  When a salad bar essentially has lettuce, carrots, croutons, cheese and some diced lunch meat, that's unimpressive to me.  They had one soup which was some weird vegetable slop.  The shrimp were about half the size of the shrimp at Mirage.  The sushi is low budget.    

About 90% of it was cheap breakfast items and low budget lunch choices.  I guess if I loved to fill up on lukewarm egg rolls, greasy meat or waffles then it would be more towards my liking but when the hummus doesn't even have anything to dip in it, you know you are in the wrong place.

I tell our server who gets the manager and he apologizes and comps both our meals. Normally I would have just left but hunger wins out and I give them the benefit of the doubt.

(Lately its been almost every month) We like coming earlier in the day in time for breakfast. Theres a pretty good variety of food. In the morning there is an omelette bar that my bf likes to go to. Theres lots of stuff like pancakes, waffles, sushi, fried chicken, mashed potatoes, mexican food, fruit, salads, pastries, meats, oatmeal, cereal, yogurt, mac and cheese and lots more. So we like to start with breakfast as our first round and have lunch our second round haha we like to eat! We've gone later in the day, I'm not sure if it was lunch but i think it was and it was changing over to dinner, there wasn't much of a variety in our opinion so we definitely prefer the morning.
One of the reasons we like to come here is because the first time we came we talked to one of the ladies that works there, Minnie. She's super funny and friendly so one of the many reasons we go back is to see her. Plus the food is pretty good and we always get great service.

It wasn't that great at all. I am glad i didn't spend $86 of my own money. This buffet needs more kid friendly food. My daughter had fried chicken, slice of pizza, vegetables, salad. 

As I walked around the buffet, I noticed they had minimal selections of food. The woman working the carving station in charge of the prime beef, turkey, and sausage seemed brand new! I watched her cut slices of prime rib, they would splash onto the cutting board & the juice from the meat splattered over 2 customers onto their clothes. The prime rib was under cooked, the turkey slices were cut too thick, & were dry. 

I ventured over to where the crab legs & shrimp were located. The crab legs looked decent, but I didn't have any. The shrimp .... Oh my goodness ... I can't believe this hotel served this fishy, smelly, old shrimp to their patrons. The shrimp was brown, smelled really horrible, & had white dots on it ... (Please see the picture of the old shrimp I uploaded) ! I know what OLD shrimp looks like & they had a whole big tray full of it ... People were grabbing them by the spoonfuls ... Ick I was getting ill ! 

The desserts were decent. They have a delicious Oreo cheesecake, chocolate cupcake, and carrot cake. The servers wait staff was pleasant, but didn't attend to us very much.

The BF and I went here for dinner before seeing David Copperfield.  We caught it at the right time and had virtually no wait.  A quick survey of the food revealed a pretty standard spread in Vegas--carving station, crab legs, sushi, potatoes done every which way, salads, and different little international dishes here and there.  They even had a kids' section of the buffet.  On the one hand if I had kids, I would appreciate it.  On the other hand, I don't believe in brining your kids to Vegas, no matter how much they've tried to clean it up and make it a family friendly place.  (Tangent Alert: I'm sorry, but the stumbling drunk chicks in f-me heels and flicking of the cards on every street corner tells me that this indeed NOT a great place for your family vacation.  Get a sitter.  Send them to Grandma.  Wait for 21.)

I decided to ignore the time-wasting carbs and get down to business, which was the prime rib and steamed Alaskan crab legs. Both were great.  I really don't remember eating much else.  The dessert selection was also pretty standard, and nothing truly stood out to me besides the bread pudding and the chocolate creme brulee.

I like to try new things all the time, so when faced with a choice I'd probably pick somewhere else in Vegas to do a dinner buffet next time, but if I had no alternative, the MGM Grand Buffet is just fine.",3FjdHwnoz-vfw6hBBtckqg,1,0,3,EphSrFgGOThmUfrM4EMkQA
3855639,2009-09-12,0,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"My last memories of the MGM Buffet was maybe 2 or 3 years ago before they started doing this ""all-day buffet"" thing. I love the concept of paying a flat rate of $33.60 (more on the weekends) and getting 3 turns at the buffet from Breakfast, Lunch to Dinner. They hand you this card where they will punch a hole in everytime you eat. Kind of like your high school lunch card. 

I came here for breakfast, and there was nothing breakfast wise that really impressed me. I would say the best item during breakfast was having roast beef with au jus which is really a lunch or dinner item. 

Lunch time, they expanded the trays a bit. I remember them used to have some type of fish or salmon.  They had shrimp in the open bar, but nothing spectacular. The high light item was the desert plate of tiramasu. Still this is not as good as the buffet at the Paris. 

Lastly at dinner, the gf found the california rolls to be a high light and I m not much of a sushi fan. So I got stuck with roast beef au jux again for dinner. 

Overall I wasn't impressed and I notice that the quality has degraded since the old days of MGM. If you want great buffet food go elsewhere. If you want a good bang for your buck, then come here. If you are getting a special with MGM where you get 2 for 1 buffet, then definitely take advantage of it.

After reading reviews, we were glad the tickets to the buffet were complimentary for my birthday. Our waiter was a much, much older gentlemen who seemed quiet and shy. He was attentive and our water glasses stayed full. He took plates away in a timely manner, so I really have no complaints about the service here.

The food is decent. You aren't going to get bells and whistles and foie gras, but for what it is, we liked it. The more traditional ""American"" foods were great. From the mashed potatoes, mac and cheese, and steak, it was all quite good. The rolls and bread choices are delicious.The salad bar gets a thumbs up, and almost all of the meats were good if you aren't too picky. For the seasoned foodie, this might be the pits for decent food. But when you come in with very little expectation, you might leave a bit surprised. The price tag is a bit much for the quality of the food, but when in Vegas, what do you really expect? Where this buffet falls flat is the lack of any ""make your own"" areas for food. Usually for the price of the ticket, you'll expect a nice fajita, Hibachi, or some sort of freshly prepared food station for those who are into that kind of thing. It isn't here, unfortunately. The veggies are excellent. There's corn on the cob, broccoli, cauliflower, and an array to choose from. They're cooked well, and some of it is paired with BBQ/cookout foods. My girlfriend particularly loved the different types of sausage to choose from. My favorite was the fried chicken, and her's was the lamb. During dinner hours, there are King Crab legs and other seafoods, and they were decent enough. The sushi left something to be desired, but buffet sushi is generally a difficult task.

The MGM soars sky high when it comes to the dessert area. It may not be as big as Bacchanal, but the quality is there. We tried them all. There was cheesecake, cupcakes, tiramisu, fudge brownies, chocolate covered strawberries, cakes in cups, banana pudding, and they were all spectacular. We engorged our tummies on these the most. We even went back for seconds, and we would definitely visit again for this section. Every single one we tried had something good about it. I definitely recommend the key lime pie and custard. All of the desserts are decorated cutely with polka dots or bits of decorative chocolate on top. 

Overall, is this the best buffet to choose? Absolutely not. The Wynn or Bellagio are worth their price in gold as far as quality and quantity are concerned. However, if you're staying at the MGM hotel and don't want to walk down the strip for dinner, it's not the worst place you could have dinner, either. We asked at check in if we could have a trip to the buffet complimentary for my birthday. The clerk obliged, so we weren't left feeling dissatisfied with an overpriced meal. Even so, had we paid, I can't say we would have been completely disappointed. It's a lot better than some other choice buffets on the strip.",jkfYfwtJBUamD-j5-QOvEQ,2,0,3,tnPihCB-yGT3PpVhO-O8KQ

The pancakes and waffles were obviously frozen.  They were doable, but tasted like the eggos I pull out of the freezer through the week before going to work.  The other downside was that the syrup wasn't in an area that kept it warm.  Each table had a cold bottle of Log Cabin on the table.  Cheap.

My father was able to slightly rectify the situation by making an egg salad sandwich from scratch. At least that wasn't dry! It's pretty sad when you have to prepare your own food in order to have something you like at a buffet! There's a carving station but they only had turkey and some saugages (you guessed it - dry too).  I was told they were out of Tri-tip. I made myself a sandwich, something I never do at buffets.

The layout is different since they renovated some years ago.  I checked everything out first.  After looking around, I got a New York steak piece (not really NY steak) but it was OK and there was still a small amount of pink.  There were also creole shrimp and they were very good, very spicy!  I added a chicken cordon bleu which was not the best of my first selections.  The fried wonton were not good at all and should be avoided.  Rounding out the first plate was some pasta Bolognese which had a surprising amount of heat from ground red pepper.  It was pretty good for a buffet.  Someone wasn't afraid to spice things up a bit.

For the second plate, I got some sushi roll slices which was standard buffet type.  I got two pieces of spicy Portuguese sausage which was quite good, and I went back for more of the pasta.  I loved the pepper heat of it.

I had some carrot cake and a chocolate pudding for dessert.  These were standard buffet type desserts.  Nothing special but not bad.

The staff was a little slow with bringing my first iced tea but when she did bring it, she brought two glasses at once which was nice.

Almost everything containing meat is dried out, overcooked, and over seasoned.  We had a $50 dining credit to use at MGM so I wasn't too upset that the buffet sucked since we didn't pay full price.

The fruit selection wasn't even very good, so our kiddo ended up eating cheese slices for dinner.

I vowed never to come back to the MGM Grand Buffet after getting sick a few years ago. But this time I found myself with a comp dinner buffet and no one to have dinner with. I easily got my voucher at the mLife desk and walked over to the buffet. I flashed my Pearl card and was able to by pass the lines. Then came the sad part (1)...I stood in the VIP line next to the group of 6+ or whatever, so everyone could see me alone. The hostess asked me how many people, and I raised one finger. She looked at me confused and then whispered into her microphone. A nice gentlemen came by and took me to my table for four, as the music over the stereo sang, ""all by myself....don't want to be...all by myself...anymore"" haha. Great comedic timing. Anyway I felt bad taking up a table for four when there were all these other people in line but I trekked on to the buffet line anyway.

There's a ton of salad options and hot foods from BBQ themed to Asian cuisine. None of it was outstanding, a bit bland or over cooked from sitting out too long. There were crab legs in the ice bar section but the steamed ones next to the carving station was better. The rib roast was pretty good. And sadly my favorite was the nachos...I don't know why, nachos just make me happy.

Sad part (2), as I'm walking back from the second lap at the buffet table, I was confused that a family of four was sitting at my spot. I walked around thinking, maybe I got the location wrong, but I wasn't. I finally found my server and he said he thought I was done because I had A plate. I begin questioning myself if I've had too much food already haha, but he finally found me another table after I stood in the center of the dinning room being starred at by multiple families.

To wrap up this story, the desserts weren't very good BUT the three gelato they had were AMAZING. I asked the lady for small scoops of each but she decided to make me a sundae. Oh well...it was all good. No stomach sickness after this trip, but if I were to pay full price for this meal, I would've been pretty disappointed.

Because there's no zero rating. 

Truly an awful buffet. 

The geniuses at MGM have taken to squeezing money out of every orifice without regard to customer satisfaction. Rising resort fees. Parking fees. 

You can see this Nickle and dime mentality at this buffet. First, it's $40. That's not a cheap meal. 

However the brain trust at MGM does everything they can to make certain they maximize profit. Paper napkins. Plastic cups. Except for clearing plates there's no table service whatsoever. Everything including drinks is self service. 

The food is mediocre at best. Turkey roll not real turkey. Much of it looks like it's just reheated Costco fair. There's only one fresh station, a Japanese stir fry. That was decent. Everything else was forgettable. When the best item at the dessert station is soft serve ice cream you know the bean counters have been working on cost control. 

If you want a cheaper buffet save yourself $$$ and go to harrahs. Food isn't great but it's also $10 cheaper. 

For $10 more the buffet at caesars is worth the walk.

Even though I've been going to Las Vegas annually at least once for the past 9 years or so, this was the first time that I was eating at the MGM Grand Buffet (but I have eaten at other Las Vegas MGM Resort owned buffets before including the buffets at Excalibur, Monte Carlo, Bellagio, and the Mirage).

In the past, when in that area of the Strip, I would normally eat at Monte Carlo's buffet but now with the renovations and Monte Carlo being ""dismantled"" and changing the name to Park, Monte Carlo's buffet was closed. I ate a few times at Excalibur's buffet but for some reason, I preferred Monte Carlo's buffet.

On the day that I went, there wasn't much of a line to get in. After going thru the cash, the lady handling the seating asked me if it was the first time I was here. I mentioned that it was. As she led me to my table, she pointed to where the self service soda drink machines were and mentioned that I could help myself.

The buffet is somewhat similar to what Monte Carlo's buffet used to have but MGM's buffet has a bit more variety. The self serve soda machine is also better at the MGM Buffet (similar to the self serve soda machines offered at the Mirage's Craving Buffet) than it was at Monte Carlo's buffet. While not as much variety and/or the quality was not the same as such places as Caesars Palace Bacchanal Buffet (variety and quality), Bally's Sterling Brunch buffet (quality), or Bellagio's buffet (variety and quality), I still enjoyed MGM's buffet (and I do like it over Excalibur's buffet). From my recollection based on the last time I was at the Mirage's Craving Buffet, I think that MGM's buffet is somewhat on par with it (at least for brunch).

There is free WiFi in the buffet area for restaurant guests. I had data on my smartphone so I didn't use it that much but it did seem reliable. The only thing is that you need to sign in with an e-mail address.

If I wasn't comped for the buffet and I wanted to have a buffet in that area of the Strip, I would return, now that Monte Carlo's buffet is closed and I'm not too crazy about the buffet at Excalibur for some reason.

We arrived a little before 11 AM on Saturday morning and didn't have to wait all that long to get in - after getting through the first line (for the register) and the second line (waiting to get seated), we probably were all seated within 10 minutes. Since you serve yourself, there's not much to discuss in that arena, although the waitresses are very keen on refilling your champagne glasses without even asking if you want more...I would imagine it's quite easy to get yourself quite loaded before the morning is even out.

As for the food - most of it is standard brunch fare, but a great deal of it isn't all that fresh. The bacon was all over the map -  some pieces were too chewy, other pieces were overly crisp. Scrambled eggs were okay, if not terribly fluffy given how long they were sitting there. While I liked the flavor of the corned beef hash, it was way too dry. The tiny biscuits were good, but again - some were too dried out from sitting under hot lights for who knows how long. The spicy Polish sausage was probably the best thing I ate here, but that's not saying much - I've had better (and fresher) sausage elsewhere.

If you get your meal comped, you may as well show up. Otherwise, I'd probably stick with seeing what a traditional breakfast joint in Vegas would be like.

Buffet price was $29.99/adult, and $14.99/kid. Total with tax came to $86.49 for the three of us.

This would be the first time that Ian understood the concept of a buffet at Vegas. So, we spent a lot of time showing him the different kind of foods, and the tour did pique his curiosity. 

Pros:
Service was on point. Plates were being removed as soon as we set them aside. Napkins etc. were being stocked as well. We did stay here a little over 2 Hours. (+1)
Fountain drink station and options were good. Mimosa's kept flowing :)
Tri-Tip had flavor. Shrimp scramble was different. Stuffed Bellpepper was delicious. Meatloaf was also very tasty. (+1)

Cons:
Not much variety in desserts. (-1)
Not much variety in seafood like Crab Legs, Sushi, etc.

We visit Las Vegas yearly for our anniversary. For our 17th we returned to MGM Grand (where we spent our honeymoon). We have stayed at MGM Grand 15-20 times and various MGM Grand properties perhaps 40 times. Fabulous trip other than morose clerk & buffet.

We have been to this buffet dozens and dozens of times and LOVED it, but this time the food was not fresh.  I'm a picky eater but my husband is not.  He and I both tried several different dishes and putting them aside after a bite, even the desserts were substandard.  It was later in the evening but nowhere near closing time.  

I had an Italian dish, Manicotti, did not taste fresh at all, the shells were rubbery like it had been sitting out under the lights on the buffet for to long and the slightly sweet, mild, creamy ricotta was runny, almost like clabbered milk so one bite and I  pushed it away and tried something else.  Made a spinach salad with blue cheese sprinkles and blue cheese dressing, it had a tangy, gross, taste,  did not taste fresh at all, pushed that away and tried their pizza, which, when all else fails is usually a descent standby. The pizza crust was worse than the cheapest frozen pizza,  did not taste fresh at all, almost rubbery,  so pushed that away and got a few tiny desserts.  Took a bite of each and they were not horrible but not good either.  The quality was far beneath that of a grocery bakery.  Very disappointing.  In the past 16 years I've never had a problem or complaint with MGM Grand's buffet.  Many times we would eat breakfast and dinner there a few days in a row.  This time the food was so bad we did not return the entire trip.

Additionally, it's totally serve yourself now, which isn't a big deal but you are paying an enormous amount for a buffet to begin with and wine is extra.  I believe it is included on the weekends with an even higher priced buffet.  Your money would be better spent at one of medium priced restaurants on the MGM property at this point.

The buffet used to be a fun, inviting place to have a meal.  Now, it feels like you are on a conveyor belt and there is virtually no service other than the ladies who ring you up before you go in and the host/hostess who take you to your table and scramble away.  The prices have gone way up over the years while the quality of food and service have gone down, way down.  

I hope this is a trend that ends.  It would be nice to have a reasonably priced buffet, with fresh food, home made desserts, and service in the hotel where you staying instead of making the trip to the Mirage buffet. `

Tip:  Apparently they add 18% tip to large parties, however, there is no service, it's serve yourself food and drinks, hummmm",VY4czvfBX2VPB3OsrW_9SA,3,0,1,lTx4lcwGQXwx9v2VGzaE3A

The drinks are a serve yourself thing from the machines. You have the option to add different flavors to personalize your drink so it's pretty cool. The food itself wasn't too shabby, there just wasn't that many options to choose from. Also, some of the serving tongs were very hot especially for the churros. It would be a better idea to not have the serving spoons resting inside the serving pans and possibly outside. Even when the tong is resting the the pan it tens to burn your hands.

MGM Grand mercifully serves ""Brunch"" until 4:00 PM on Weekends, just in case you slept in. Which you probably did.

Their brunch consists of a pretty nice selection of acceptable breakfast items, including eggs, bacon, sausage, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, cereal, waffles, omlette station, etc. It's all ok, but none of it is amazing. 

They also offer a lot of their regular dinner stuff too. Slices of turkey breast at the carving station, pasta, salad, Mexican food, desert bar, and quite a bit more. Again, none of the food was amazing, but none of it offensive either. 

I had a brilliant idea too late to utilize it: breakfast tacos! They had taco shells and a bunch of stuff to make normal tacos with, BUT you could combine that with the breakfast stuff (bacon, eggs, hash browns, etc) and make breakfast tacos!

This place deserves 5 stars period for lunch. I was looking for a cheap place to indulge prior to hitting to a more ""expensive"" buffet for dinner if you will, and this place hit the spot.

Food on the strip is expensive, period. For example, a slice of NY pizza is about 10 bucks. For 19.99, you have an all you can eat experience, which makes sense.

About twenty bucks gets you prime rib, sausages, turkey and other meats from the carving station. You also get a great variety of vegetables at the salad bar. 

There's an area for pizza and delicious pasta. If You don't like Italian there's common foods you'll find like mashed potatoes, Brussels sprouts, fried chicken and many common items you will find at a buffet.

The sushi section was pretty weak with California rolls and old salmon. I wasn't coming in knowing I paid 20 bucks for good sushi, I'm not a retard. 

Overall, great service, refills and a wide assortment of desserts. A great bang for your buck, if your planning on dining for an expensive spot for dinner.",XYeOlhJz4BBS5gglIw5uJw,1,0,5,PplNhPP_mfhfQJ51fOA9ow

My childhood encounters with Ryan's, Golden Corral and Ponderosa became a thing of the past when my penny-pinching father started to loosen his wallet for the likes of Texas Roadhouse (eat as many rolls and peanuts as you can pre-ordering/meal). Yet, on my first visit to Vegas, it only seemed appropriate that we experience a classic casino buffet.  Penny-pinching papa deemed MGM's ""to be one of the best"" (code language for: ""it's the only one I remember from my last Vegas visit). We humored him and played along - $35 per person...for a buffet. All I could think to myself was...hmm... what does a $35 booffet include? Personal filets? A to-die-for cheese board with international cheeses like Manchego and the finest Gruyere? (fully aware that I'm sounding snobby right now, just play along). 

The buffet lacked the experience I had hoped for - it felt like more of a cruise ship feeding trough than a sit down and enjoy the meal atmosphere.  Maybe it was the lighting? Or the floorplan and style of cheap tables and chairs?

So I come to Vegas about 20 times a year. 
To relax at times but mostly for work. 
The MGM  Grand Buffet is a decent Buffet. 
It's not Bellagio, Caesar's or the Wynn. 
But for $30-plus they do have a decent prime rib, peeled jumbo shrimp and cut Alaskan king crab legs. Now if you can pack it down like I can. You are sure to get your money's worth with just these few dishes. Although I believe at this price the deserts need to be upgraded. 

As far as customer service. We got Smiles all around, and Sara made sure that we had all the important condiments on our table, as well as keeping our table clear of dishes for more plates to replace them.

Well one of the answers for me is the MGM buffet.  I have heard the Bellagio, Aladdin, and Rio are the best, but you will be paying more there.  I have been to several other buffets on the strip and the MGM has been my favorite because of the value.  Our waiter was a little slow to clear our plates and refill our drinks, but he was very friendly and it was extremely busy.  They have some of everything, which I guess would be expected at any decent buffet, but these guys seem to have it all.  Best chile relleno I've ever had in my life, really good cr√®me brulee, and many types of cheesecakes among an incredible dessert selection.  For breakfast they do made-to-order omelettes, and at night cooked-to-order steak.  For dinner they Alaskan King Crab Legs, and the list could go on forever of course, but I sure did feel like I was at Disneyland when I noticed the stack of Cracker Jacks!  That made it really special for me.  Check their website listed here for the hours of lunch and dinner, and a highlight of the menu.

Tip 1: Using a duffel bag as seen in the movie Vegas Vacation  is not permitted at this buffet.
Tip 2: Make it for lunch (until 2:30) and it's $10 cheaper ($20 for lunch, $30 for dinner)",Sbi2JAndStC8ND8X09_B6Q,0,1,4,OadM7lGgvuyO0dmQodfn1g

4508768,2007-07-06,0,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"Well, this is my first review on a string of reviews for my recent trip to Vegas. I ate at the Grand Buffet for dinner on June 28, 2007. Got there around 7:00 PM and there was no line. Got to the table within 3 minutes after paying. To me, the price for dinner was too high. I think it was $25 per person? But my dad did have a $25 dining credit, so it was 1 free, so we gave this place a shot. I loaded up on prime rib, hot and cold split Alaskan king crab legs, and peel and eat shrimp. The prime rib was good, but a little too dry. The shrimp was good and the crab was good, although on my 3rd plate, the crab meat was dry (a disadvantage when it comes to split legs). And this buffet has a memorable mashed potato cake bar where they take a mashed potato cake and add sundried tomatoes, green onions, mushrooms, cheese, broccoli, and/or bacon to it. It was so great, I had 3 of those. I regrettably avoided most of their other foods because I knew that $25 had to be put to good use and the crab legs and the shrimp and prime rib did the job. The dessert bar was small, although had a good selection. I had chocolate mousse that was great, an Oreo cheesecake that was creamy, and vanilla ice cream (Yes, that was too much sugar). 

Our waiter was always there to refill our drinks and gave us extra mints in the end. We tipped him well.

Overall, the food was good, BUT I would think it's worth it to spend an extra buck or two at the Bellagio dinner buffet, although the Bellagio doesn't have that great mashed potato cake, but hey, what can you do?",nOqdDgKp5Plq6Mp-2p1-cg,1,1,4,szk7S_hXALAX49nMKqlg5w

Should have known when I saw the reviews but we got this for pretty much free from The Signature and it was cold and rainy so we stuck to indoors.

Could not even touch the hot dishes.  They looked THAT bad.
Couldn't look up from my dish either -- the drab surroundings are terrible.

But I'll spare you the negatives and give you the positives if you are thrifty like me or also lost all your money in Vegas and decide to take the hotel up on their free (or almost free) buffet.

The best (totally edible) items there are:  the hummus - you guys were right.
Some of the veggies at the salad bar- you can make a decent, healthy salad.
I stuck to this rather than trying the only hot dish that looked sorta good -- the overly creamy mac and cheese.  Eggplant and squash dish with melted cheese was also okay.  The chicken stir fry with peppers for the fajitas/tacos was okay.  Had this with tortilla chips instead of the stale taco shells.  Filled up with guacamole, black beans, and a very fresh tomato salsa was actually very good.

Yeah, that's about it.  Stay away from the scary looking sushi.

That is one thing Portland does not do, and if they do do buffets they are horrid little places.  I guess Las Vegas is the opposite because this place had some pretty decent food and the price was fantastic for the location as well.

We only ate there when we got out of bed for two mornings so I can only talk breakfast. However, there was lunch out there as well.  Tons of food, all tasted fresh, and they always had it full and plenty hot enough.  My inlaws back in the day, used to make us go with them to a Portland buffet and they would have the nastiest food in those big square containers with the boiled water underneath. The food would be crusty around the sides and be overcooked and pretty much canned. The desserts would be things like puddings that had a layer of hardened pudding on the top and you would have cool whip to put over it. There would be the fruit cocktail with the cherries on top and the dried up pizza.. Like I said, Portland does not do buffets.

I digress, but I was making a point, sort of a contrast from what I saw here. First, none of those square containers with the boiled water below like a cafeteria was anywhere to be seen. 
Their presentation was appetizing instead, and the items were things like:
smoked salmon, smoked trout, homemade crepes made on the spot with any fruit you wanted them to make for you, root veggies, apricot, prune, mango fruit salad, all kinds of olives, lots of egg choices, and even homemade grits. 

The servers were friendly and helpful as well.

The price for breakfast all you can eat was a good deal, especially since we just did not eat lunch after that meal anyway!  And Las Vegas charges so much for meals!

I think Portland could learn a thing or two from the buffet here. There's a niche in this market that's waiting to happen. I mean it's kind of like a brunch and we do that quite well.",lKVrn4Jdh2Joc7WzpPBhdA,14,11,4,F5zLUBVIIFeAlZKo1rLW3Q

Other than that the food was very bland; mussels were not very good, shrimp ceviche was sub-par, NY strip had no flavor, prime rib was cooked to medium well (way too done for prime rib), sushi rolls were not even worth eating, even the grilled vegetable tasted like they had no salt or pepper use.

Pretty nice size, not the biggest but what they do have is okay. I hit the crab legs first, got a plate full of cold crab legs which were tasty. My gf said, "" oh on the other side in the corner there might be hot ones"". So my second plate of crabs were hot. But it was the bottom of the tray and was steamed too long. A lot of it was dry and tasteless. Yeah I preferred the cold legs.

The prime rib was blah, not seasoned enough. They had some kind of a braised beef dish, the sauce was good but the meat was a little dry.

4621001,2010-02-04,1,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"I remember this buffet from 4 years ago, when it was excellent.  In a pinch, we took some friends to the MGM buffet, WITHOUT CHECKING YELP FIRST -- dumb dumb dumb dumb.

I was embarrassed at what we found at the $27/person MGM Friday dinner buffet.  The ""sushi"" on offer consisted of one old-looking platter of krab-salad rolls and one platter of old-looking krab-california rolls.  Their use of krab (pollock) product in these rolls was puzzling because right next door was a huge tray of cold crab legs.  (these legs were fine).

One entire row (of 4) consisted of salad and fruit (yay for healthy choices, but this can all be obtained from a grocery store and was clearly offered as a ""space filler"").  

I walked in HUNGRY but the buffet was so visually unappealing that I only half-filled a plate with this and that and was disappointed to find the taste matched the lackluster appearance of each offering.  I'm sure the fruit was great, but that's more of a snack item for me.

After 3 unsuccessful sorties of trying this and that (potato halves with little pasta balls, a fish dish, a beef rib with over-salty gravy, some rock hard rolls, noodles) (none recommended), I resorted to eating some old-looking (and old-tasting) potstickers and some nasty orange-glazed chicken.  My request of the server for some chili sauce?  Denied: ""we only have the 4 sauces you see on your table.""  (had to catch her in the bussing station to bother her with this request since she was generally not seen during our visit)

Oh, and while we're on service, it matched the overall experience.  Perhaps we just got a bad attendant, but really, her only job is to keep drinks full and plates cleared.  No-Can-Do & No-Can-Do.

My low opinion of the food was verified by my buddy.  Though he politely pretended the food was fine, I could see that he was not finishing many of the items he chose for his plate.  This coming from a guy who is known to eat PLAIN, COLD, PASTA for lunch.  The man has no taste buds and he wouldn't even eat this crap.

Dessert: not good, most selections went unfinished at our table.  The COFFEE, however deserves mention: excellent.

Last rant: who are these other people eating here?  Looks like some free coupons were given out so MGM would have a lower trash bill from tossing all this food into a dumpster.  Think trying-to-be-classy www.peopleofwalmart.com meets strip buffet.  

Total and unmitigated thumbs down.  Good lesson to always check yelp.com first, because all these other reviews say basically the same thing.",G9Se6o-Zerj5zdbjCJh85Q,5,3,1,lIgYizy7xSoyjn49ihMr_w

Odds are there will be a line.   So do it earlier than later so you don't miss your meal or have too little time to enjoy the buffet. 

Now we're at the breakfast buffet, if you're at the cuff between breakfast and lunch time you're lucky and get some lunch items! The selection is decent, you got your bacon, eggs, omelets, sausages oh andddd plentiful desserts! Drinks are self serve in the morning.

Not only are unlimited Mimosa's and champaign included in the price (at least on weekends anyway), but there is a very nice, vast spread of options and if you're with other people there is generally something for everyone here.  I eat completely different than my husband and we both found several good options here and not just processed food line junk either.  I will say we got in early this time for the breakfast/brunch (8am roughly) and most people were still sleeping or whatnot so it wasn't messy or picked over and the noise level was pretty quiet.  Everything was fresh, hot, looked and even tasted better than what I was expecting when we ended up here. 
I would definitely consider going here again. We've been in the past and either hadn't noticed or they didn't include any alcohol in the $30-$60 price range depending if you're hitting brunch or dinner.  We never eat that much in one sitting so the (alcohol) drinks included definitely makes sense.

MGM mix it up, keep it fresh and have smaller sizes to make sure your food is always great.

4746233,2016-11-24,2,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"I generally don't like making reviews so soon after going some place; I prefer to stew around, ask others in the party what they thought, and try to make a well rounded review ... you know, be all pretentious about it.  But, after having dinner here last night and having an extra hour or so while the rest of the family goes off to gamble, I had to vent my disgust with the Grand Buffet here at the MGM Grand.

First off, dinner on a weeknight costs upwards of $39.99 a person, which makes the buffet here one of the pricier ones on the strip.  For comparison, the Wynn and Cosmopolitan charge a buck less on weeknights ($38.99), the Bellagio charges $36.99, and, just to throw it in there, one of my preferred Vegas buffets at the Rio is a scant $32.99 per adult.  So, the MGM charges more than the newer and swankier places in Vegas.  And what do you get for that extra cost?

The short answer is nothing to make it worth it.  When I come to buffets, I don't expect anything more than a lot of average fare.  Typically, you can hope to find most things be not too disgusting, with one or two items that jump above the line, and an equal number than dive well below it.  Here, everything feels dried out from too much time under the heat lamps, meats are under seasoned or overcooked, breads are stale or oddly chewy, and then a couple of high points.

Starting with the carving station, the steaks are flavorless, with no char from the grill, no salty melt to the beef, and most everything we had filled with gristle.  The ribs were overcooked, the fatty trim burned to dry coarseness that was akin to bad chicharrones.   The Prime Rib was overcooked, no pink, close to over seasoned (why couldn't they sprinkle some of that on everything else?), and sharing those ribbons of gristle that ruined the steaks before them.  And, finally, those kielbasas ... well, they were just bad.

The Mexican / Latin station had a bad rendition of Carnitas, which were overly laden with unnecessary vegetables instead of flavoring them with just whatever acid they broke down the protein with and the simmer from cooking it down in its own salty fat.

And the pizza ... my toddler son who normally loves such things, wouldn't even touch it.

On the average end of the scale, the Brussel Sprouts were alright, a bit tough as they didn't seem to be steamed to soften up before roasting, but were also coated in the strong, acrid taste of fennel.  

The sushi station was on point for a typical buffet, though not for a $40 a plate one.  They had Octopus Nigiri, an atypical selection, and had a good chew to it along with a fair flavor that didn't have an overly fishy taste.  Salmon rolls had jalape√±o slivers with nice heat.  But, on the flip side, no California Rolls or any normal sushi fare you would expect to enjoy.

Macaroni Cheese was fair, tasting fresher than out of the box, and good enough for parents to bite and enjoy while kids feasted on it.

And over at the Asian station, the Egg Rolls were average, if not common / everyday.  Pot stickers are poorly made, none of them cooked down long enough for the skins to become gummy and firm like they should have been, but they still were pretty good, even if they readily fell apart.  And Fried Rice is almost always good.

On the high end, the Shrimp Diablo was fantastic, a good cut to the shellfish, perfectly cooked, and served in a wine sauce with fair heat that was really outstanding.

And the Pear and Gorgonzola Ravioli were a nice blend of sweet and salty, well cooked, and sauced in, what I remember being, a butter cream that made it my favorite dish of the night.

Oh, and their dessert is pretty standard, not quite worth the price tag, but still a good representation of what you should see at a higher end Vegas buffet on the strip.  Plus, they have Ghirardelli sauces!

So, in the end, more disappointments than readily edible food.  Nothing was horrendous, but none of it truly stood out in amazement that came anywhere near warranting the $40 price tag.  I think the greatest mark against this place is all of the poor Yelp reviews that have been tagged by MGM management with their thanks and promise of review ... yet, none of these slights seemed to have been improved in any way whatsoever!

Anyway, if you dropped the cost down to $25 on a weeknight, it might be a solid three stars.  As of right now, it's a very weak two stars in my eyes.",lN7NysaTcbI2VCRub7kYOw,8,2,2,GaDTQWbo2U3-JK0RhZ1K5w

4753489,2014-07-11,2,-U7tvCtaraTQ9b0zBhpBMA,"Decided to have dinner here around 8:00. My general rule is that I like to try the buffet at the hotels I stay at in Vegas. The line is ridiculous. First you wait forever to pay in one line. Then  after you pay you get shuffled into another line to actually get into the buffet. There are two lines; one for groups with 1-4 people and the other for groups of 5 or more. there does not seem be any real method of deciding who gets seated next. Once I moved a little up the line bit by bit I could see inside the dining room and I was pissed when I saw a ton of empty tables some cleared off and some not yet here we stand in this line and nobody is being seated. For the length of both lines they needed to clear off those dirty tables much quicker. As far as the ones that were ready is concerned I don't know why people weren't being in them faster. I have eaten at my share of Vegas buffets and I have never experienced such a ridiculous system and wait. 

I prayed that the food was worth the wait here. I needed something to justify it and unfortunately it was not worth it at all. The caramel cheesecake they had for dessert was the only thing really worth it. Some of the other desserts were good too but that was the best. They had basic buffet foods and none of it was that great. The bread was hard and the pastas were not great. The pizza and salad looked unappetizing. The meat at the carving station was disappointing. The crab legs were gross. The crab meat had a funny taste and it was tough. 

Another thing that annoyed me was you don't get your own drinks. A server brings them. When I was finally seated after that wait I was out of patience and starving. They told me someone named Miguel would serve me my drink and then I can get my food so I sit and wait. Nobody shows up. Then I see him and he is essentially ignoring me. Then another server came and finally took my drink order and then she disappeared. No drink. After waiting I say screw it and go get my first plate of food. I come back and still no drink. The Miguel finally shows up and takes my drink order. I gave him my order because I assumed that lady forgot me. When he finally got to me he was quick and brought my drink right away. When I was working on my second she finally brings my drink and has the nerve to look stunned that I had another drink?! She didn't really think I would wait that long for a drink did she? Honestly after the long line to get in I did not have the patience to wait forever for a damn drink. Other buffets I have gone that don;t have self serve drinks They take the order right away and bring it to you right after. Personally though I think since a buffet you serve yourself food you should with drinks as well. One plus was they cleared your finished plates quickly. No issues with that dirty plates piling up on the table. I guess they just took a while to get tables ready after the fact but during was not a problem. 

So the summation: long line to pay, another long line to get in, poor selection, poor food, long wait for drinks, good desserts, and quick clean-up. So one star for the desserts and one for the quick cleanup. The bad outweighs the good for sure and I won't be back.",upQW7sPfOfh0brmyq2byEg,0,0,2,COo_5woy3ONcYZHjoD4SAA

Also, the line is insanely long to get in, they have some machines you can use your credit card at (which we did) which did at least help speed things along, but the hostesses who were seating people were some cranky old b*tches that really shouldn't be working in the public.

For the breakfast buffet, there wasn't an insane amount of choice, standard breakfast items (pancakes, eggs, sausage, thin/gross bacon, cereal), but their fruit was really good, and everything did seem really fresh so I don't fully regret it. We had a meal credit at the MGM so figured we'd be all-right, didn't know it would wind up costing that much though, would be even higher if they were more reasonably priced. If you plan on going here, make sure you have a coupon or something, not worth the full price, but might be worth it at about half the cost.

Beer and wine is already included in the regular buffet price. The cocktails are good, and not to weak, so it's a good deal. These are the cocktails that are on the list:

Strawberry margarita (good, came with salt around the rims)
Bloody Mary
Whiskey Sour (I got this and it was way to strong for me)
Peach Bellini
Tequila sunrise
I think there are a few more, but I don't recall what they were. 

You get a wristband if you get the cocktails. You can only get one cocktail at a time, but that excludes beer and wine, so you can order two drinks at once if one of them is beer or wine-:) lol. 

I got my husband wine a few times. The line was a little long for the drinks sometime, so go there when no one is around even if you already have a drink. There was only one guy there making the drinks. 

As for the food, they had made to order steaks and steamed crab legs. My husband has no shame. He got there before the the crowd formed and told the chef to just give him three steaks now as he'll just be back for more later, lol. The chef laughed. He gave me a piece of it and it was good. I got the crab legs but they weren't that good. They had shrimp there too. There is a carving stations there for sausages and other meats, but I didn't try that. I should've.

They also have a lot of Asian food there. The chow mein and fried rice ran out fast. The orange chicken was good too. I also liked the garlic bread. There is a large selection of drinks there. You serve yourself at this place. The desserts are good. I tried the frozen yogurt, the strawberry cheesecake, and the chocolate pecan bar. 

I'm surprised that I didn't even get that buzzed after three or four drinks . Maybe I ate to much for the alcohol to affect me, idk. I ate to much good food there and now I gained a few pounds, ugh! I'm eating healthy again. so I can loose some weight. They don't have that much selection at the salad bar, but when you're at a buffet, are you really even going to eat much salad? lol. Salad is everyday food, not vacation food IMHO, lol.

Then, Monday late morning, when we wanted to grab a bite, we found ourselves here. Our first try was the main cafe, but the line and wait was ridiculous. A quick call over to the buffet and found the price per person would be similar to the price per person at the cafe. But we'd have more choices and, more importantly, there was little to no wait. And who wants to spend valuable vacation time on a line?!

I wasn't expecting much, to be honest, and was pleasantly surprised. The place was clean, most items were refilled regularly, and the plates were removed from our tables (and that service was better than one of the fancier Strip buffets). 

Beverages are self-serve, which always is a perk for the kids. They had a Coke machine, which lets you customize your soda. Milk, chocolate milk, flavored waters, coffee, tea, and juices. 

Some of the food was surprisingly very good - the pizza was NY style and delish. There was a great broccolini dish, and the chicken fajitas had fresh tasting veggies and tender/moist chicken. The Asian assortment was mostly mediocre, some of it tasted like frozen appetizers (like the egg rolls), although the dumplings were pretty good as was a chicken dish. Salad bar was decent with fresh veggies. There was an excellent pecan-crusted fish dish, fried chicken, pasta, and of course the dessert bar (which was hit or miss). Didn't try the sushi - even the best buffets tend to put our poor sushi. Lots of options, and a bunch of pretty good items to fill you up.

For the price (especially in comparison of prices for anything on the Strip), it was a very pleasant brunch experience. Nothing fancy, but pretty good food.

The breakfast weekend mimosas are worth the price of admission alone. They keep the glass full and even give you a to go cup. The food is what you'd expect at most buffets, an assortment of fruits, chicken, fish and other proteins and vegetables and while they are nothing special, they are all cooked well and fresh.

For a buffet, the MGM more than met my expectations and since they normally give all guest at least one free meal at the Grand Buffet, I think it is well worth a visit.",JkyZ_0wVGoyYka5Pbw6Z6w,2,1,3,QCNjFczLctnYYmkdkNaOcQ

After my initial first round, I didn't find anything that I particularly wanted to go back to get seconds.  I would highly suggest avoiding the sushi as the rolls were most likely previously frozen and not fresh.  They have a station where you can customize your seafood dish and I didn't like the fact that they served swordfish because 1) They're not very good and 2) It's not good for the ecosystem.  I found that most people end up getting swordfish because the only other fish that he can cook is tilapia and that's a cheap & dirty fish.  

Overall, a very disappointing experience.  I don't remember MGM Grand Buffet being this bad but it looks like since no one goes to this buffet anymore (i.e. little to no line), they've also downgraded on the quality of what they serve.",UGMNixisDJ5DJ8XC2HlGgg,0,0,2,486pHV6Ow34V-Sbxhk--NA

Okay, so I was at the Dead and Company concert at the Grand Arena last Saturday night
(May 27/17) and ate here in the afternoon. The buffet was $42.99 which is expensive in my opinion, however, it did include unlimited beer and wine. The house wine was pretty good and the unlimited beer included only Budlight and Stella. There were three other beers also but that was not included and you had to pay extra. IF there is unlimited beer, please make all the beers unlimited. Management should consider this.

If you like seafood, this buffet is worth it and you will get your moneys worth. They had crab legs, salmon, lobster?, shrimp, etc..They ask you if you want it steamed, fried, or whatever. The only seafood I like really is shrimp and I had enough. The rest of the buffet was OK in my opinion. The prime rib, brisket, fried chicken, were all fine. I had no problems with the food, however, the corn on the cob tasted ""old"" and the chinese rice and spanish rice were not the best. The salads were delicious. The dessert bar was really bad. No flan and no cheesecake. Really? Most other places have these two items, but this dessert bar did not and was really small. As far as the beverages, you have to get up and get it yourself. The only thing the servers do is pick up your plate for another round of food.

Honestly, I think the price for the weekend buffet is expensive. The servers were OK. I don't blame the servers if things are not right. You have to put the blame on management and they need to make things better so everything can run efficiently and smoothly. Like I said before, make all beers free with the buffet price and improve the desserts. 

I still recommend this buffet if you dont have time to walk down the long Vegas blocks to search for another buffet. There will never be a perfect buffett, so just try this one way, and write down your opinion. Peace to all.",WX6anDjipDGBcxA6vCtSmQ,0,0,3,JCRevaytR4xD9fUHg0Usqg

The problem I had with the Grand Buffet was that I didn't find anything too exciting the first two rounds. The omelet line was way too long for a buffet. I'm not going to fill up on salad bar that wasn't even that exciting. 

The sushi - you can pass. No brainer that it's made beforehand since it's on platters. 

Salads and salad bar - nothing too exciting there. 

Meat - the Chili BBQ chicken was good, mainly drumsticks and wings. The fried shrimp was good, the cooked shrimp was a little on the small side and slimy. 

Dessert - I liked that most were in tiny little cups so I took a fair sampling. Had a bite or two of each but didn't find any that I wanted to devour. The chocolate dipped Rice Krispie Treats were a nice surprise but the chocolate was waaaayy too sweet. And you'll rarely hear my disparaging chocolate. 

It also costs $2.50 extra per person for the bottomless mimosas. They are premixed. The iced tea is not brewed, it's fountain. Yuck.

Wife and I went here for Saturday brunch last month.  We arrived about 11am.  Paid $60 for unlimited mimosa and brunch.  All I wanted was bagels and lox, ham and an omelette.  

The buffet was at the halfway mark meaning it wasn't going to close for another 4 hours.  They were out of bagels.  One of the stockers went to look for more bagels and she said they were out for the day.  I said to her ""You mean there are no bagels in this entire casino and hotel?""  She said yes.

Went to the meat station, they were out of ham.  No more ham for the rest of the day.

Got an omelette and it was over cooked.  

Bottom line, I would have asked for my $60 bucks back but we were so hungry.  The only reason this place got 2 stars is the mimosa service.

The food was very hit or miss. I did like their scrambled eggs (although, it's hard to mess up powdered scrambled eggs), the breakfast potatoes (which were moist and nicely seasoned), the California roll sushi, and the cheesy polenta. But perhaps the best thing that I got was the fresh fruit -- namely the pineapple slices. I'm glad the fruit was all fresh.

On the flip side, the gnocchi tasted it like it'd been sitting out for several hours, the blueberry blintzes were doughy and tasted uncooked, the fried shrimp was mostly just batter and the batter was very bland, the creme brulee/custard tart thing was even blander, and the rice krispie treat with dried fruit and icing was okay but extremely soggy and not crispy at all.

The waitress who was serving beverages was incredibly creepy. We asked for two coffees, and when she only brought us one (empty) coffee cup and a large container of hot coffee, we pointed out we wanted two. 

She glared at us, reluctantly looked down at her pad, and went, ""Oh, you're right, you asked for two."" (You're not allowed to get snippy when you wrote down the order and screwed it up.) Then when she brought the second cup, she'd filled it with coffee and glared at us again when she put it down. And then every time she walked by us, she'd look at us funny.

No joke, my friend ended up pouring the coffee out into a bowl because she was afraid the waitress had spit in it or something.

There are abundant amount of desserts, but it's located at the far end of the buffet.

It's best to go at 3:30 and pay the lunch price and get dinner food once it strikes 4pm.

Currently, the food here is good to above average for breakfast. For breakfast, they have fresh blueberries, salmon lox, different bread, omelet station, carved station (only sausage and one other meat) and your usual offerings including cereal.

However, I did find something new here, Deep Fried Twinkies and these Mango Puffs. The mango puffs were not good, not crispy. However the fried twinkies were pretty awesome. They were pretty popular and of course, were always out but I got a few and worth trying. 

What I don't like here is that they now have self serve juice/coffee/tea/milk station. It started late last year and the waitresses have to do more work.  You might think they are just there to clear dishes but they actually laid off a lot of folks as a result. 

If you are a heavy drinker, add the $16 AYCD wrist band for the bar there. Lots of frat boys were there having a great time, 5 fiving each other. Well, I guess if I was younger and was about the hit the pool, I would've done this too. 

$18 for breakfast. Kids are $12.  What's a pain here is if you have M Life, you have to go to the desk and they don't open before 8am. Kids are not welcomed there and the buffet is way in the back by the sports book.

I read a lot about how buffets in Vegas are totally different from what they used to be, long gone are the days of mediocre food but apparently MGM Grand Buffet didn't get that memo. Not good at all. Service was fine and staff were friendly enough (although it's self serve). The decor was very much an highly overpriced version of Old Country buffet . The food was just bad. We ate breakfast here and the options were very limited and of very poor quality. Most of the food looked as if it had been sitting there for a long time all of it very dry, nothing was fresh. It all tasted cheap and terrible. It reminded me of those crappy complimentary breakfast spreads that low cost motels put out.

I was wondering why so many people were showing up to eat there and after reading the reviews I realize why- they were probably all eating for free. Unfortunately, we not only paid for this subpar experience but paid dearly for it- around $50 with tip and that was the early bird special!

For $35, I seriously expected much more. To be fair, if you can calculate the cost of crab legs and eat $35 worth of that, you're set but if you consider the general quality and assortment of other items, then for $35, I've definitely had better, both at buffets and non-buffets. Quite frankly, I think we should have just spent our $35/person and eaten at a finer establishment. 

Aside from the ubiquitous crab legs and peel-and-eat shrimp (very puny and limp looking), there were:
- Smoked salmon, with capers, lemon, and onions
- Assortment of cold cuts (e.g. salami) with olives and cheese
- Taco bar 
- Prime rib
- Ham
- Turkey breast (I think)
- Rolls (lots!)
- Pizza (pepperoni, combo, cheese, veggie - overall very bready)
- Small salad bar 
- Minestrone soup
- Miso soup
- Black bean soup
- Some kind of pressed flat steak, grilled to order
- Dim sum (the wrappers on these didn't look right/firm)
- Beer-battered fish (big pieces, though the batter looked very dark and thick)
- Tempura shrimp (more like battered shrimp than traditional tempura shrimp)
- Chinese food (e.g. broccoli beef or something like that)
- Mac and cheese
- Fried chicken
- Four types of sushi (e.g. faux crab meat California rolls)
- Fruit
- Assorted desserts (cupcakes, beignets, etc. - generally speaking, it was either overly sweet or bland)
- Ice cream/soft serve

Honestly, for $35, the MGM buffet is only appropriate for those of you that emphasize quantity over quality. I know I shouldn't expect much from a buffet, but the selection of food (aside from the shrimp and crab legs) is like Sizzlers or Home Town Buffet and both of those charge way less. If this wasn't the MGM, I probably could understand the general lack of quality, but I seriously expected more from the MGM. For those of you that want a buffet in Vegas and didn't care much about the quality, then I would just pick one of the cheaper buffets on the Strip that also includes crab legs and shrimp and call it a day.

I bought a comp buffet pass from playing MyVegas and decided to give it a try since I'm always eating in the pricey buffets. The Buffet is located right on the left side of the casino by the strip entrance and across from Rain Forest Cafe.

My buffet pass was only good for lunch and I made it a mission to make it all the way from the Cosmopolitan on time before they switched to dinner. =D

The food they serve here is typical in any other Vegas Buffet, like: Italian, Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Meat Station, Middle Eastern, and Japanese.

I don't know where to start with this place. I've eaten here on numerous occasions expecting a different outcome and haven't gotten it. It's only gone downhill. I only wish I could have the experience of other high-star reviewers, but alas...maybe I'm picky. First off, in my previous experience...I've told others to just eat at a restaurant instead of this buffet. This time around, I didn't follow my own advice because buffets are fun to experiment with and I was hungry that day, had time to kill and a food/bev credit on my account. Well...I experimented with EVERYTHING and it was all trash (for lack of better words). I tried the spinach/cheese shells and threw them out. It's my favorite food! I still can't fathom how one manages to mess that up, it's fairly simple. I tried the sausage, the tacos, the pizza sticks, fried Twinkie...YOU NAME IT. Even the cupcakes were garbage. Listen, I'm not a wasteful person and I felt bad giving the waiter an entire plate of food on at least 3 occasions in one sitting, but I couldn't consume it. What's the point? In the end, I was still hungry so I decided to get some nutrients and eat a salad. You can't really mess that up can you?

One more thing, I'm not sure if it was only during this time, but they increased the lunch and dinner prices significantly...over 50%. So for two people, it costs $84 (includes taxes) to sub-par food. No thank you. You just expect better in Vegas. Please take my advice, eat at an actual restaurant to get higher quality food -- and most likely for less.

""Grand"" disappointment is more like it. We went for brunch on President's day.We had 3 more days of free buffets here.We are not wealthy by any means, and we both vowed never to eat here again free or not. That is how bad it is.

The line to get in went quickly, and first thing we were greeted by was a screen after you pay asking how much we wanted to tip in advance. What craziness is this, you are supposed to tip for good service afterward, not before! what if the service stinks? 

Well at the MGM Grand, you wont have to worry about service too much because the ""servers"" do not serve anything. You want a drink? Self Service Coke machines line one of the walls, get it yourself.

They were offering mimosas which were included. Want to get one for your SO, to save them a trip? Nope, you have to get it yourself, and it's one per trip, I can understand a limit but one? Again what am I tipping for? I guess to take the plates away, which they did a good job of I suppose.

To be honest I like the self serve soft drink policy, but I hated the tipping in advance for nothing part. On to the food.

The food was bleh. That is the first word that popped into by head. You are in Vegas, you can do so much better than...bleh.

Its President's Day and I didn't see any prime rib...? Then what did you charge extra for?(I know prime rib is usually reserved for dinner but if you make us pay the extra $$$ then pony up for the better meat MGM!) They had ham, turkey and brisket. The turkey was good, the brisket tasted good, but was drier and rougher than a dead cat's tongue. The ham was pedestrian. They also had some kielbasa which was OK. The carver did cut the meats extra thick I suppose.

Their salad (OK who goes to these things for salad, but still) was...bleh. less then 20 choices, not a lot a variety, and for some reason they sliced the vegetables really thick including radishes.

They had other things like ravioli, (not terrible) a Asian section (I tried the dumplings, they were the precooked frozen ones), breakfast items like waffles (didn't try) bacon that was looked and tasted like it was cooked on the surface of the sun, sausage patties that looked and tasted like they had done duty as Olympic hockey pucks, and so on. Nothing was great or really good, the best I got was ""edible"".

They do have it all though. Some fresh crab and cold seafood options, comfort foods, Mexican, Asian, cuts of meat...it was all pretty OK, fairly average. Fried chicken was a touch dry, mashed potatoes could have used more flavoring. Sushi I would avoid. Lots of tasty items though like the cajun fried fish, prime rib, etc.

The good:
We had fantastic service at this buffet! Our waiter was really attentive, and kept the mimosas flowing! He even sent us each home with a ""coffee"" cup to go filled to the brim with the good stuff :)

The bad: 
Long line to get in. Bonus was that we played the $.05 slots and turned $5 into $20 -  enough to cover just over 1/2 of 1 person's breakfast (yes, you read that correctly). Once you pay at the front, you are put into a second line that is divided by table size (1-4pax, 5-9 pax, etc). We were only a group of 3, and the 1-4 line moved fairly quickly. Still took about 20 minutes from arrival to sitting down, despite lots of tables being open inside.

The ugly: 
The price for quality of food. You almost can't find a brunch buffet for less than $35, and MGM definitely came in just shy of that. Still ridiculously expensive, but everything is on the strip! The quality of the food, however, was really poor and definitely not worth the money. Powdered eggs, microwaved bacon, soggy sushi, guacamole from a pouch....I could go on but I think you get the idea. While there is a huge variety of food to choose from, none of it was very good.

We decided on the MGM Grand Buffet. We were kind of iffy about it because of the reviews but we didn't want the credit to go to waste. 

We went on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. We were informed about the unlimited mimosas which were very tasty. We were seated right away.

We thought the buffet was very clean compared to other buffets we've visited including the ones in our hometown. The person we got to pick up our plates was very friendly! He made sure everything was okay every time he stopped or passed by our table.


The food was really good as well. They had all the breakfast food and some pasta, seafood! You name it ! The staff we interacted with were friendly. The only thing was that we were told one mimosa at a time per guest but saw they allowed other people take up to three at a time. We constantly had to get up for one. Still good though

The first star was for the selection and variety of food, from Sea Food to Mexican food to yummy deserts. The second star was for the service. Our waiter was very attentive and helpful. Here is why I don't particularly care for this buffet: This place was WAY overpriced. $30 per person for dinner. That price would be acceptable had the food been fresh, warm, tasty, and cooked well. The coffee was awful. It tasted like mildew. 
The Only good food item I ate was the caramel cheesecake. The Cesar salad was tasteless and nearly dry. The lasagna was dry as well. It tasted like a freezer burn lasagna that you pull out to eat for dinner as a last resort. 
The mashed potatoes were good, but how hard is it to make good mashed potatoes?? The shrimp was pretty fresh and clean as well. One of the biggest upsets was the fried chicken; just gross.

Everything looked good at first.  I was surprised to find a whole vegetarian section, and there was a nice assortment of Indian vegetable dishes, along with pappadum and mint sauce.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I love veggies, and Indian food is my absolute favorite.  But if cruise ships can do it well, MGM Grand ought to be able to, also.  HIRE AN INDIAN CHEF!!!  Everything I tried from that section was bland and tasteless, with not a hint of spice, or any kind of flavoring at all.  In fact, everything I tasted was woefully forgettable.  

At first glance, the buffet looks big, but there aren't many selections in each category.  Three different kinds of cheese, three or four types of cold cuts.  The Mexican station had pre-made chicken fajita meat with some toppings, but didn't have the assortment of prepared dishes that even the lower-level Feast Buffets offer.  There were a couple of Chinese dishes, a couple of Italian pasta dishes (the lobster ravioli filling tasted like mashed potatoes.  I think the chef made a wrong turn and ended up in Idaho instead of the Pacific).

The desserts were just as bad.  A few sliced cakes, some of which looked like they'd been there since the flood (Noah's, not Australia's).  The cutesy desserts in the tiny decorative cups looked good, but weren't (What the hell WAS that thing they named ""Strawberry Tiramisu?"")  The soft-serve ""ice cream"" was cold soup, and the vanilla was a really peculiar yellow color.  Oh, but they had real ice cream!, the server behind the counter said.  How bad can mint chocolate chip be?  That, too, was devoid of any flavor, but aahh, the texture:  like chalk.  Or left out and refrozen.

MGM is too big to put their name on this poor excuse for a buffet.  I'm glad we didn't have to pay for it - it was offered spontaneously when I put in my two cents' at the Player's Club about the new M Life program, which is screwing us loyal but low-roller gamblers which, of course, is not revealed in their huge advertising campaign.

But if you've got the buy one get one free great.  But let me just tell you the prime rib and I'm a prime rib lover was horrible! It was not marbled it might as well just been roast beef it was really tough. I got my girlfriend an end cut she likes and tried asked cook it medium because it looked a little thick in a little bit on the dryer side. I love it medium rare.  My piece was second in from the end. Started off looked juicy and within a few minutes of being on my plate it was dried up and pretty much almost impossible to eat. The outer part that was my favorite where the seasonings are at, you know what I'm talking about if your prime rib lover was good , way under seasoned. Maybe a little bit pepper maybe just a little bit of salt but no shallots,rosemary, garlic.  They were making shrimp to order and any of the many different concoctions of shellfish if you're into it or crab claws. I thought they would be doing the thinner crab legs that they had shown online with that were already cracked and unfortunately they had crab claws and legs but not the longer legs that were all the associated with when you think of crab legs probably frozen, they were dry inside shell, some were brown. Regardless Omar who was the chef behind that area was very lively and attentive making special sauces with garlic, wine , red chili pepper and butter and just really whooped it up.  I appreciated him for that and gave him a $5 tip. Bbq babyback ribs,  were way dry, probably from night before, just overly sauced. One dishmade me drool. It was lamb ribs that was just very tender yummy in an ossobuco sauce. I could have eaten plates and plates of that.  I really enjoyed the grilled brussels sprouts with bacon and onion. But not enough high end unless youre a seafood person. Sushi looked ok, but im not into buffet sushi. Now the desserts they were not really good. My girlfriend's a baker loves desserts they were just average at best.  You have to get your own beverage which sucks.  Get in seafood line start there get your shrimps on and then walk over and get your meats. I would suggest the New York or top sirloin that they were grilling to order looked a little more appealing than the prime rib. Unfortunately they also had brisket it was really overly cooked very dry. They also had sausages up there but didn't want to get filled up on sausage. I wanted to love it, but was sad when leaving. Our server kept coming by and picking your plate and leaving napkins, and i still left her a $5, & not sure why, really no service per say.

My brother-in-law took us to Vegas this past week.  We had never been before, so b-in-law went ahead and planned out an itenerary for us.  We ate at the MGM Grand Buffet on the first night of the trip Monday b/c it was the most convenient (we stayed at MGM Grand Hotel).

Short wait in line (5-10 min).  Cost was upwards of $120 for 2 adults and 2 kids :(

Nice sized selection including American, Mexican, Asian, Italian, and Indian. I liked that they had whole asian pears

Food was very hit or miss.  I would have expected much better quality for the price.  Steamed dim sum dumplings were cold and dried out. Miso soup was devoid of tofu and sooo salty.  Chinese 'rice balls' were awfully dried out and sitting in a thick sauce that was so salty that I could not eat it.  I am the sort of person who has 3-4 different types of specialty salt at home and sometimes even carries my sea salt grinder in my purse, so it is really bad if something is that salty to me! Fried tofu balls were better, lighter and fluffier than any fried tofu that I have previously had elsewhere.  Sesame balls were hot enough for the sesame seeds to be all hot and toasty - yum :)

Desserts selection was pretty decent.  All of the desserts (fruit tarts, custards, etc) that I tried were delicious, though still not quite worth the price...

My favorite part was the asian pear.  My husband does not remember eating anything impressive, but is still grumping about the cost.  My oldest son loved the mints that he got as we were leaving.

All in all, not worth the $$.  For a few bucks less you can get a far superior buffet experience at Wicked Spoon (our fave meal of the trip).",cHr4S_PSpAWpLi8CWtLzrA,0,0,2,0YDjvEPXlOIVCLPYltTWnA

We were there first night in Vegas, before our show of KA there.  Starving/Tired to death after a long flight, we decided to try this one despite the reviews we saw.  It's $35 for dinner per person, we should've jumped right off the boat when seeing no one was lining up at this buffet (check out all other better reviewed buffets and see how long the lines are especially for a dinner), but it was an honest rookie mistake.

So we paid and entered and I was astonished to find out that about 1/5-1/6 of the food countertops were covered with no food existence.  I thought it was the timing initially since we entered around 5pm, but after about 1 hour, I finally realized that was it.  It's a ""Grand buffet"" with much less food selections than everybody else who dares to charge such a premium for admission.

Not only did they lack food choices, but also hands.  Our waiter only came to the table to refill the drink literally 3 times for the 1 hour session we had in this place, as he needed to run around a lot of different tables.

Only three highlights:  Prime rib (tender and full flavored), snow crab legs (they cracked the legs open for you already, so no effort from your side); and a great selections of desserts.

However, as I said in the very first, for $35 you should go to Wynn (we did and it was awesome) and Bellagio (saw the LONG line everyday and dared not join the competition).  Definitely not worth the price!",GhsTRjo0RrraCMJq7IW1Sw,1,0,2,9tW5kT9OczS4RUl8jFb7gw

The meal was complimentary- and yet I would never come back here again even if someone paid me to go.  I tried pretty much everything they had to offer and ended up pissed off that I wasted an hour and half of my time filling up on crappy food.  I should have went to the McDonald's at the food court instead.

Prime rib- tasted like beef jerky.  Crab legs- too salty as if they were trying to cover up something.  All the meat dishes tasted like rubber and the sauces tasted like plastic.  They had a taco bar.  Make your own tacos and it still tasted like crap.  The meat looked even worse than Taco Bell.  Who comes to a buffet to eat PIZZA?  Well I don't, but I decided to make an exception, figuring that no one could possibly fail at pizza.  Boy was I wrong... the crust was stale and none of the flavors tasted right.  Their lasagna tasted like Chef Boyardee.  I could keep going but then I'd never be able to finish this review...

The only part of the meal that was OK was the dessert bar.  Oh yea and my Coke and black tea tasted great too.

It befuddles me how they went so wrong.  I can't believe people pay for this place- I think dinner is about $25/person but then again I didn't pay attention since my meal was free.  Never again!
