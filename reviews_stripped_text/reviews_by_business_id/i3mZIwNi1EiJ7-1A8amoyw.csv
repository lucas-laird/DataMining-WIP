Their pita is fluffy & delicious, like soft little pillows.  Falafel are bright green, flavorful, and the perfect size.  You order at the counter and when it's ready, you come up and chose what veggies you want inside.  They also have a good homemade hot sauce on the tables, and a great selection of bakery items including a really great baklava.  Best falafel in pita I've had in Vegas.  I wish I'd tried this place sooner... the creepy Trader Joe's strip mall/dive-y location was throwing me off.  I should have trusted Misty's review because I've been missing out!  And like she said- they sell their pita bread!!",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,1,3,5,JquBPoTv8E9B0PImoxX72Q

Their Schwarma was lame.  I don't even think they used a spick for it.  It just tasted/felt like pan fried steak.  Very little flavor.

I would not go back there again.   

The workers are very nice, but the food was just too bland for me.  

I want to warn that I may be a bit biased: I've been to Israel and I've had awesome Filafel & Schwarma in Europe & Turkey, and this does not even come close to the stuff you buy in the streets over there.

Oddly enough, the best Filafel I ever had was in Paris.  So don't let me ruin your experience there.  However, all I can recommend is their Filafel; and it's not a 'glowing' recommendation, but it was okay.",7o_eSQM79lbX5pTL5mWavQ,0,0,3,aOnuHDlNe60RnEmm5AOsqw

I haven't had anything Mediterranean since I left Detroit about 2 years ago, mostly because there truly wasn't anywhere to get it in the places I've lived since then. I walked into Amena with high hopes because of good Yelp reviews and I was NOT disappointed. 

I had a chicken shawarma plate, falafel, lentil soup, and a couple of pastries (baklava and another that I really have no idea what it was, but it was delicious). Everything about it was perfect and just as I had remembered it should taste, and the falafel and baklava might have been the best I've ever tasted. The lentil soup was also exceptional!

My husband and I dropped in here on our way out of Vegas wanting some light and quick eats. In short, the food was not very authentic and I can say that because I am of Middle Eastern decent. I know this place is rated pretty high on yelp and that is why we dropped in... Maybe we caught the cooks on a down day?

The chicken and ""shawarma"" meat were kinda cold. Shawarma in quotes because it wasn't shawarma; just pieces of meat sautéed on a grill with no spice at all. The chicken had I think sumac on it. Whatever spice it was, it definitely wasn't the spices used on shawarma.  The salad was not fresh at all and the hummus bland.

Overall, this place is a bit pricey for the quality and setting.

The positives: service was great, the girls that worked there were very nice and attentive. Oh and the falafel was very fresh. So get a falafel sandwich from there.",NhXjAcNieaqrTzlG37wy0Q,3,1,3,Fo3jyTzncb5d_LT9VAPzyQ

But we told them we would go ahead and take the extra one which they gave us at a discount so that was nice. The hummus was probably the creamiest I ever had, maybe due to extra tahini, which means extra calories but well worth it. And the pitas were home made and like little pita pillows, so soft and tasty. I bought extra to take home. Also, the gave us as many pitas as we wanted without charge while we were eating! The portion size of the combo plate is pretty big and two people could share it.

I ordered the schnitzel and my husband had the shwarma (sp?). I thought the schnitzel was pretty good. It tastes like a country fried steak but not as crispy on the outside. My husband enjoyed his sandwich as well. Overall, the food was prob a 4/5.

I ordered a glass of water and it was horrible! The last put a lemon in it and it still could not mask whatever was in the glass. I had my husband tried it and he agreed. I usually drink my water with lemon in it and heck, I even drink water from the sink from time to time and that water did not taste right. I told the lady about it and she just dismissed me and said oh well maybe you're not used to the lemon. Uh, no. I'm not used to shitty water. She claims she uses a filter... Well, I guess it's time to change it! I tried to keep my voice as quietly as possible so the other customers wouldn't hear but she kept yelling.

I couldn't decide what to try, so I got the combo plate with sherwema chicken and beef, hummus, salad and falafel.  

I've had falafel a few times in the past but never really knew what the hype was about......until I tried these.  Seriously perfectly flavored with a bit of crunch with every bite.  

I have a little love for another little locally greek cafe in the northwest, but I must say, this place kills their falafels and pitas.  Freshly baked pitas are wonderous.  Both the chicken and beef were tender and seasoning was also perfect.   The hummus was good.

The salad was a nice crunchy mixture of chopped lettuce and veggies, but the dressing wasn't my favorite, but then again I've only really liked one greek salad dressing and that was from the little greek gem in the northwest.  Overall, it was cold, crisp and refreshing.

The service was great, the owner was there and very helpful and gave me dessert on the house, baklava.  I'm not sure if I've ever finished a whole piece of baklava because of the sweetness, but this one went all in.  Perfect balance of sweetness and crisp texture.

Being veggie they always make sure they clarify vegan and I really love it. No fuss, no hassle, they always double check.

The owner is from Nazareth and Jerusalem.
They carry those fun Osem snacks and they even carry the organic tahini containers that my father in law insists on me buying. 

Falafel: It's not the super yellow Israeli small balls, but it's not the super green (parsley filled) cheap way either. They are perfect. Slight crisp on the outside, no grit no fluff inside. They melt in your mouth somehow. Sooo yummy and filling! 

From eggplant dishes, Turkish coffee, to baklava, to fries they have all the goodies. And it's all at a great price. 

Baklava is very hard to find vegan (most of the time made with honey) so it's nice if you get the craving!

Since living in Vegas for the past 18 years I have been sorely disappointed in what some places consider to be a good falafel. 

I have managed to find what I thought was impossible here at Amena.  A beautiful crispy outside, wonderful soft GREEN inside (green is good.... Really good when talking falafel) and amazing flavor falafel ball.  

It is very similar in flavor to the ones I grew up with in San Jose at Falafels Drive In: http://www.yelp.com/biz/falafels-drive-in-san-jose

I ordered the Falafel plate.  It came with 7 large falafel balls, salad, hummus, a small thing of pickles, 1 pita and the necessary 2 sauces: A deliciously spicy pickled pepper chunky delicious concoction.  It also came with the delicious creamy white sauce you can put it on anything.

It was a wonderful lunch.  It really was perfect, save one thing:  It needed more than 1 pita.  The 1 pita provided was enough for either the hummus OR the falafel but not both.  However it was not enough of an issue to give less than 5 stars.

We were looking for a salad or sandwich place but when the best recommendations we got were for Olive Garden or TGI Fridays, we decided to turn to Yelp.  Turns out, Amena was in the very same mini mall.  Awesome!

From the moment we walked in, we were in love.  So many delicious options!  We almost made the mistake of each ordering the veggie combo.  Luckily, the lady behind the counter stopped us.  The veggie combo is more than enough to share so we got the grape leaves and the mahi mahi as well.

I'm pretty sure the staff at Amena thinks we're big freaks.  I don't think we stopped talking about how great everything was the entire time we were in the place.  We loved that they brought out olives and pickled veggies to start, then the warm pita bread, then the veggie combo...you get the idea.  Everything was wonderful and so fresh.  You know when you can just taste the difference between something that was pre packaged and something hand made?  It's like that.  You can tell that everything is homemade with love.

After almost cleaning our plates, we were told that the mahi mahi would be out in a few minutes.  We were stuffed already but couldn't stop eating.  I'm so glad that we didn't stop there.  The fish was buttery, hot and perfectly cooked.  And it came with more hummus and pita bread.  We polished that off too.

Not only is the food wonderful, the people who work there are so gracious and genuine.  They took excellent care of us, which was unexpected for a deli.  The prices were also very reasonable.  The three of us could have easily split the veggie combo and the grape leaves and been perfectly happy.  I'm so glad we didn't miss out on that fish, though.

Pricing was a little on the high side: got the chicken shwarma plate with two pitas and sides of cucumber salad and hummus ($12) plus a beef kibbeh ($2), bringing my with-tip total to around $15 for one for take out. A bit steep, but food was quality.

Came home to enjoy, and it was still piping hot, which was a good sign.
Chicken was well seasoned and moist, pita was soft and warm and didn't harden as at other places. Hummus had a good consistency and texture and was not chalky but was somewhat bland. Cucumber salad was standard. Would consider getting it again.
The kibbeh was a small fried ball of beef and onion for $2- probably a decent price for it but not worth getting, IMO. Didn't have much flavor and just didn't stand out at all.

Service while in store was good- they friendly and polite. They have a deli counter with various salads, a pastry case with desserts, and a few random grocery items scattered about without prices.

While you're at it, you can visit Amber Unicorn Used books next door. It makes a great lunch stop. Books and Mediterranean food are a great combination.",TgW-w80-ketnwdUsjsAaNw,3,2,4,fKFo7IA-fDi5U2dfIrth5A

The service was a bit disorganized...only 3 tables of people eating when we were there, but the person serving the food got every order wrong. If you are patient though, you will get some great mideastern yumminess. The schwerma plates had enough for two meals. The standouts for us were the hummus...the creamiest I've ever had! The fresh lemonade with mint. (Drank 4 glasses!) Amena makes pita bread to die for. We also took home very large flatbreads that were like lavosh only moister. On another trip there I got some of their pastries and liked those too, though they weren't the best I've ever had (not enough filling). When I'm craving schwerma, hummus, or fresh pita in Las Vegas though, this is the place to go.

2225472,2013-12-16,0,i3mZIwNi1EiJ7-1A8amoyw,"after months of hearing how great this place is, we finally made it here.
they close a bit early and we are typically late eaters so we never managed to get here early enough to try it out.
we really should've made more of an effort though because amena is the real deal.

falafel, tabbouleh, hummus and pita are some of my most favorite foods.
the falafel here is one of the best i've ever had.
it was a little bit darker than i would normally prefer but i believe it was more of an oil issue than the falafel itself, which had great flavor and consistency.
the tabbouleh was nice and refreshing with a tartness that i find lacking in most tabbouleh these days.
the hummus was so smooth and delicious with a strong tahini flavor.
the freshly made pita was soft, warm and chewy.

the star of the meal for me, though, was the lentil soup.
i am a lover of soup and this lentil soup was absolutely fantastic!
it was smooth and flavorful with a few chunky, hearty bites of lentil.
the portion was enormous and it was served piping hot which was fantastic on a cold winter night.

the restaurant itself is sparse and deli-like.
you order at the counter but pay after you eat.
our server was a very kind young lady who checked up on us frequently and thanked us after each visit to our table.
it's rare to find a dining establishment that appreciates your business to such a degree.

we really enjoyed our meal and it was very apparent when the hubby exclaimed ""why has it taken us so long to eat here?  this place is great!""",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,5,4,4,QT1pXMr9Ba_A286zzEYniQ

The combo plate is superb, which is a healthy amount of food for $16, and includes hummos, pita, salad, chicken, beef and falafel.  I love the great mix of flavors and the large portion.  Probably some of the best falafel and grape leaves I have ever had, and the other stuff is very good also.

Food:
Veggie Platter- it came with falafels, hummus, baba ganoush and veggie salad stuff (forgot what they call it).. amazing! their hummus is so good with chick peas on the side. It came with fresh, warm pita and you can eat it however you want. I put the falafel and the toppings inside the pita to eat and it's sooo fresh, healthy and delicious! 

Grape leaves- The grape leaves and rice came out warm and fresh! it was good.. tasted like every grape leaves rice dish.

Grilled chicken hummus platter- the grilled chicken was so juicy!!! I love how they grilled it and the flavors they put with it. It came with rice and hummus on the side.

Carrot juice- so refreshing!!!

The platter sizes are pretty reasonable. It's more than enough to get you full for the rest of the day! However, it is a bit pricey. Everything is between $10-25 per item.

It's times like these when I question the credibility of Yelp. I came here with a craving for a gyro and with the ""great"" reviews my hopes were high.  

The short....I ordered a $14 gyro plate and got 2 large pitas with tasteless prepackaged gyro meat.  Prepackaged due to the uncanny symmetry of every piece of meat and the fact I didn't see a vertical roaster in the kitchen.

Come one yelpers....5 stars for a Greek place that doesn't even have a gyro roaster!!!

They use halal meat, which is important to some. (As I've Yelped halal in Vegas and haven't got any hits, I figured it should be noted.) On my next trip, I will check out the sandwiches, but this time around I had the combo plate and kibbeh balls.  Both were outstanding.  What I really loved was the hot sauce.  So tasty!  It reminds me of the flavor from Mamoun's in NYC but not quite as spicy.  It was love at first taste.  

The Turkish coffee was good but not the same as I've had in Jersey.  It didn't really have the grounds in the bottom, and I was given sugar on the side instead of it being sweetened during preparation.  I kind of found that to be strange, but I'm no expert on Turkish coffee.  The baklava and fig cookies were outstanding.

2865925,2017-04-17,10,i3mZIwNi1EiJ7-1A8amoyw,"This is my #1 Favorite Restaurant in Las Vegas.  This place has the best falafel and the best pita I have ever had.

I've been a customer here for seven years. Even though I only visit Las Vegas four times a year, they always remember me and they treat me like a prince.  I don't even have to ask for the little bowl of pickled veggies.  They know how I roll.

The falafel sandwich here puts all others to shame.  It's absolutely perfect.  I do not believe there is, or maybe even could be, a better one.  It's the Platonic ideal of a falafel sandwich.

The falafel patties are unfailingly fresh, always fried to order. Perfectly crisp and packed with flavor.  I've never counted how many are in a sandwich, but there must be four or five.  There's falafel in every bite.  

The pita bread here is pillowy soft, yet strong enough to hold a bunch of falafel and toppings.  Best pita I have ever had, no doubt about it.  

I love how they construct the sandwich.  The split the pita and fill it with the falafel instead of using it like a taco shell.  The sandwich comes with lots of falafel and everything else you want, cucumbers, tomato, pickles, cabbage, tahini, hot sauce, and probably more.  It's loaded. It never fails to fill me up.

I savor each and every bite.  I notice as I get towards the end of the sandwich I start taking progressively smaller bites, because I don't want the sandwich to be over.  When I finish the sandwich I as happy as Mikey C gets.  Total satisfaction, every time.

After I'm finished eating they always ask me how I liked the sandwich.  They smile when I tell them how good everything was.  They chuckle just a bit when I insist that theirs is the best falafel and the best pita  in the whole damn world, because I go on an on about it.  They know I am one of their biggest fans.  Plus, they know what I'm saying is 100% true!

They have a lot of other stuff on the menu, and it all looks great.  There's just no way I will ever get a chance to try it because I'm all about the falafel.

We rolled into town from Moab, Utah today and headed to Trader Joe's. for some groceries.  A couple of doors down, we found Amena.

We arrived around 3 pm for dinner. Amer, the owner, was extraordinarily nice. He offered us suggestions and even some free tastes. We ordered hummus, baba ganush, tabuli, and falafel plates, chips (french fries),  and a separate chicken shwarma sandwich. Everything was freshly made - I mean really just made for us. This was some of the best middle east food I've eaten in the US.

The pita was incredibly soft and moist - it was just baked earlier in the morning. The baba was smoky with some chunks of eggplant and garnished with mint. The hummus was smooth and creamy with 4 falafel added on top (we didn't know the plate came with these). The falafel was very crispy, but not over fried. The interior of it was very green, indicating Amer used lots of parsley and cilantro. 

For desert, Amer suggested his homemade Kunaffe - filo, honey, sweet goat cheese topped with pistachios. Wow!

You come here obviously for the food, not the table settings. Most of the food came on ceramic plates, but a few dishes came on paper plates. Silverware was not plastic. Basically, you order at the counter, sit and the food is brought to you. That was just fine by us.

At first the prices seemed a big high, but once we had a chance to eat the food, the quality far surpassed anything that would be priced less. Here you clearly get tremendous value for what you are paying for. Especially, since all the food was freshly prepared for us - nothing was prepped waiting to be added to our dishes. 

Amer is an outstanding value. If you are looking for incredible middle eastern food, this is the place to go.",3OuBa8cJO67Hj_5h9F2c-w,0,0,5,IVefzZsGTRGQGRtS-L9Jpw

We ordered a plate that showed it had sunny side up eggs in it. so i asked can you be sure the eggs are in fact sunny side up and soft and she said sure. When i got the plate the eggs were scrambled and mixed in with the rest of the stuff on the plate when I complained she gave me an attitude and even at first said we have no money back policy??? but then she refunded us for that plate.  But that's not it... before they used to use fresh lemon juice for their tabouleh sauce so it tasted really good, they use something bottled now so it tastes acidic and really not good anymore, i ordered a Turkish coffee and everyone knows Turkish coffee is served very much the size of an espresso. They brought it in a beer glass and i am looking at it in disbelief thinking these people don't know what Turkish coffee is, anyone drinking that much of a strong coffee will get a heart attack!

At first, the word 'Deli' had me excited for a sammie, but as I got closer I saw other signs for 'Shawarma' & 'Falafel'. Holy excitement. The place itself isn't much with just a few tables strewn about. One side has freshly made pitas lined up on a table and a case serving baked goods. The other side was the 'deli' section serving all sorts of Mediterranean delights. Beef, chicken, lamb shawarma, falafel, lentil soup, homemade hummus, etc..  

I scooped up a chicken shawarma plate ($11.99) which came with sides of hummus, a small salad and two pitas. There was certainly a good amount of food for the price and I walked away full. The salad was OK, typical Israeli style with lots of cukes. The chicken was moist, sliced nicely and had that wonderful  shawarma spice to it. The only knock is that it was wayyyyy over salted. Highlight of the dish was the hummus. . Shawarma, earmuffs!.... I knocked back two fantastic pitas in that hummus. So good.

She will go above and beyond to make your experience very satisfying. 
    Now for the food! I tend to get the combo plates so I can taste more of a variety. The meat combo plate has chicken, beef (can add lamb for an added expense), falafel, hummus (any kind you want to try) and a side salad. The veggie combo comes with hummus, baba ghanoush, tabbuleh ( not sure what's in it, but it's delicious) and falafel. Their meats are so perfectly seasoned, their hummus is flawless in my eyes and their falafel are so moist. I think it would be very hard for this restaurant to disappoint. I also love to order their homemade mint lemonade. The freshest I've had in a while! When I was done, the waitress brought out more and told me there was some left over that she didn't want to throw out.

This place is immaculate. 
A lovely young lady helped me pick a few things to go. I also ordered two Turkish coffees, which were amazing. I am a cream lover all the way, but this coffee is so smooth and rich you don't even care that there isn't any cream for miles. 
I ordered a small tabbouleh, stuffed grape leaves, and when I saw the bags of freshly baked pita, oh yeah. It is so soft and has the best little chew to it. Then my hubby arrives and we ordered a gyro to go, and all the way! It came loaded with veggies and was easily the best one I have ever eaten. And have I eaten a few in my time. 
She gave me a few little containers of sauce. One was tahini, and was smooth and buttery. I dipped my pita in there and savoured every bite with my tabbouleh. 
The other was this gorgeous dark red hot sauce. It was thick and chunky and sent the gyro over the moon. 
My hubby was in hog heaven. He vowed we will never eat anywhere else in Vegas. This whole meal with two Turkish coffees was about $30. A steal for the amazingness and high quality of food you get.

Being a loyal customer since day one and recommending Amena to both family and friends I thought my business meant something to the owner. I, at the very least, thought that my loyalty would buy me honesty. I was wrong. 

A couple of hours ago I went into Amena to get some tabbouleh. Rosie prepared it. When I got home and tasted it, it was FANTASTIC!!! It was so good that I decided to go back and get another batch. 

The owner was there and when I told him how good that Rosie made it, he told me that everyone makes it exactly the same. I replied that it was not exactly true. I've had it many times when it had way to much lemon, to little of this or to much of that. However, Rosie's was perfect and I asked him to please let her make it for me. He agreed. I went around the corner to see it being made and to my disappointment and surprise, he was making it. I told him that I wanted to try it before I paid $12.00 for a large. Sure enough it was loaded with lemon and I told him so. He said he'd retry. Second attempt; just as bad. 

He justified his lie by saying that Rosie was preparing another customer's dinner. I informed him that since I made a special trip to get more of Rosie's tabbouleh I would have been more than happy to wait for her to finish with her customers. 

Let's break this down. Over arrogance and dishonesty the owner lost a loyal customer that has been patronizing and recommending Amena to many, many people since literally day one. That's the definition of stupidity. I'm also posting this on Yelp and any other review sites that I can.

I was given some samples to nom on:
* Amazing coconut covered chocolate ball - not too sweet and a great texture. Addictive. They should be called crack balls.
* Baklava - one of the best I've had.
* Homemade lemonade - minty and refreshing, and not too sweet. Delicious.

I took home a chicken shawarma plate, gyro plate, lentil rice, lentil soup, homemade pita, and a lemonade.

The plates came with a little side salad and hummus. The salad was fresh and had what tasted like an italian dressing on it. The hummus was good but there was something missing - it could use more cumin and/or garlic.

I was a bit underwhelmed by the shawarma plate because the seasonings didn't stand out to me and the chicken was a bit dry. The gyro plate made up for it though, since that beast was very flavorful.

The lentil soup was tasty and nicely seasoned (salty soups are the bane of my existence) but the texture was off for me - it was as if the soup was made of lentil powder and was ""scratchy"". My fiancé loved it, however. Go figure.

The lentil rice was delicious. I love lentils and I love rice, so when you throw them together, it can't help but be delicious.

They day I went, they'd only been open for 4 days and they were a little discombobulated. Serving spoons were nowhere to be found, so the folks working there were trying to use tiny plastic spoons to fill big heaping containers. Their cash register was broken too.

But from my first taste of baklava, nothing else mattered but the food. The baklava is luscious. It's some of the best I've ever had. It's not gloopy and not cloyingly sweet. The taste of nuts and honey and flakey pastry all come through.

Then I tried their veggie soup. It was nothing fancy, but somehow heart-warming soul food in soup form. 

The Manoshet White Cheese pita/pizza like thing (fiteer for those who know the language) was outstanding. The pitas are fresh baked every day using organic flour. I could eat the Manoshet 3x/day and it would be a long time before I'd tire of it.

The Nazarene Salad was a standout. Cabbage, carrots, sesame seeds and bell pepper in a tasty homemade dressing. 

I do want to suggest they add a combo plate of salads but as friendly as these folks are, I bet they'd make one just for you even if it isn't on the menu.

I would definitely recommend if you are looking for a vegan meal.  Maybe a spot of hummus to get you through the day.  

Be mindful that this is a very casual deli. Great for lunch. A good place to drop in if you are driving in the neighborhood.

Sadly, I did not try any of the baked goods.  After gorging myself on hummus, I didn't have any room left for dessert.",IJL--65w5S4Pj-iSY3njJw,0,0,3,TnIZO9kKYWZal3XBQt3QIg

We had been s l o g g i n g our way down the strip just fantasizing about something good to eat, something real and comforting and delicious.  We were calling places, dipping into and out of casino parking lots, on and off the freeway.  It was misery.  We pulled off Decatur - into this big and mostly vacant parking lot.  And there it was.  AMENA!
When we walked in it was quiet.  We were exhausted, hungry, basically two depleted humans in need of sustenance, and not just food.  Somehow I knew the food would be delicious.  I know Greek.  I know Lebanese, Persian, and the like.  I love Mediterranean food.  We ordered falafel, gyro, grape leaves, some hummus...a bunch of little things arrived.  We were TAKEN CARE OF by our waitress/hostess/server who was so kind and generous and informative.  We were TAKEN CARE OF by Amer, the owner, who shared his passion for food and even a couple desserts on the house.  I was humbled, honestly, at the beauty of the food and the warmth of the proprietors.  Everything was fresh, everything warm and bright and deeply satisfying and nuanced and delicious.  This place is NOT TO BE MISSED if you're in Vegas for even one day.  AMENA is to be at the TOP OF YOUR LIST if you need catering.  I believe Amer, the owner, said he is from Nazareth.  THAT is cool.  All the food, without question, comes redolent with history and tradition - I know that much.  This place is SO BEAUTIFUL!  It's a nice little deli in a kind-of strange location, but easy to get to and worth returning to frequently.  It's that good.  Bring people.  Tell people.  Eat and enjoy life at Amena.  That's what we did.    #supersatisfying",60WdweLq5a55hFbpnpiqQw,0,0,5,6Kt4tcvnw3RampDSZLDAKg

The cashier at Trader Joe's recommended this place so we dropped in. At first glance, it appeared to be your typical falafel joint. But as we perished the menu, we were impressed with some of the options, like shakshuka, the dinner plate specials, and their vegetarian/vegan/and gluten free options. The cashier was more than accommodating, friendly, and helped to make sure we got things that would make us happy. My friends had the chicken shawarma, which they both said they loved. One of them substituted her pita for veggies, and they were kind enough to give her those plus extra salad. I ordered the open face stuffed eggplant, which is grilled and skinned and then topped with abundant fresh vegetables and spicy tzakiki sauce. Wow. It was simply, simply fabulous. They even gave me extra humans and pita for protein. Their pitas were soft and felt homemade, and their hummus was so, so smooth and tasted great. If not homemade, at least it was infinitely better than your standard hummus fare. They also started us with house pickled vegetables and olives (you'll be happy if you like that stuff), and gave us complimentary bites of balaclava for dessert. I highly recommend checking this place out. If I lived here this would go in my regular rotation. 100% happy.

We also shared the Shnetzel Plate which came with fries and a side salad

We definitely enjoyed the Falafel, Pita, Hummus, and salad, but the Beef and Chicken Shawerma were kinda dry and not like other shawerma I've enjoyed before. Unfortunately for the Shnetzel.....dry too. Their sweets were pretty good and we bought more pita and falafel mix to cook up at home.

It is rich and creamy, so you will eat less and feel more satisfied. Amena's Labneh is less bitter than Greek yogurt available in grocery stores. So I pick up a tub of it along with fresh hummus or tabouli or baba ghanoush as part of my regular shopping routine after leaving Trader Joe's. 

Amena also serves a delicious and abundant Falafel plate that would feed me for two to three days--the plate is a healthy, fulfilling lunch or dinner. 

The date pasties are handmade by mom. And so even though I don't like dates (or pastries, really), I had to try them and thought, ""Oh, these were the inspiration for the Fig Newton."" They're worth trying.

I picked up six almond cookies and two triangles of baklava. This was strictly for the bakery, and not for the actual restaurant. 

Walking in, the environment is very quaint and the shelves are stocked with visually attractive ingredients and spices. The whole place is very cute, and the service was wonderful. The woman was very nice while extremely quick to greet us and assist on what we needed. The displays were admittedly somewhat bare in the bakery portion, but the cookies were in massive quantities, beckoning me to wonder how old they were. Still, everything did actually look decently fresh. The smell was also there. 

The almond cookies were good. The filling was very tasty, and the exterior was crunchy enough. I was hoping for something a little more buttery, but they did taste authentic (old memories of a very good friend with a talent meant for the kitchen). However, one of my co-workers bit into one and complained that it tasted like lotion. I asked if it was the almond extract she may have been tasting, but she insisted it was scented moisturizer. A second tried it and confirmed, but these things do tend to happen and we often are unable to keep track of everything. Better than a hair or bug, if you ask me.

The baklava was good. It was pleasantly flaky, but a little too sweet; somewhat overwhelmingly. The interior consisted of nuts and honey, which is almost always a delectable combination. If eaten in smaller portions, they work out great. I definitely liked it. 

Overall this place was good. Again, this is a rating meant only for the bakery section. I do intend to return and try their actual meals out, plus their deli. The prices are a little high. The baklava was anticipated, but it was over a dollar for each cookie (a somewhat small and round cookie). Still, I wouldn't know how the food is yet.

I had the Amena Salad $7.49 which had Mixed lettuce, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Red onions, Feta Cheese, Walnuts and black olives with what i think was a herb vinaigrette. It hit the spot and was nicely balanced but kinda hard to eat with everything being small diced. 
Since i was hard torn between the salad and Falafel sandwich the cashier/ server/ busboy/ possible owner gave me three falafels and a pita bread for free.
The pita bread as Misti Y. sayes is AYUMYUMYUMYUM. taste like it was made minutes before it was brought out. and the falafel was very good. Crispy on the out side and soft on the inside with a great balance of herbs and spices.

So this Easter Sunday, when I realized I'd not ordered items for a party the next day, I remembered reading the review and headed over -- they were open -- Habib's wasn't.  

I explained my situation to Amir -- what a great guy.  He and his niece were thoughtful and caring -- beyond generous.  I think they offered me samples of everything in the place.  And even offered to make items I needed that were not on their menu.   I arranged for pick up the next day at 2:00 (meat, cheese and spinach pies, stuffed grape leaves, falafel, tahini, pita bread, baklava, these round phyllo cookies that were crispy, sticky, sweet and cinnamony and just incredible, as well as little chocolate ""quickers"").   

My staff had made lots of the items we served at the Persian-themed party, but there were some things that were just too hard for them to pull off -- hence the outsourcing.  I've not had tremendous luck finding good reliable sources since we've come to Vegas -- but these folks are the real deal.  

And sure enough, yesterday at 2:00 sharp -- they were ready, and proud -- even found Persian music for me to use at the party!  Everything was delicious -- truly spectacular and reasonably priced.

Bless the Chef's heart -- he looked exhausted, too.  I know my order was a tall one.  

I did learn one thing that I thought was interesting that Poly hadn't mentioned -- the family is from Nazareth.  Amir used to be a local bank branch manager.  

Anyone looking for a great lunch -- terrific falafel sandwiches, kebobs, etc -- like Poly said -- on freshly baked pita is in for a treat.  It's also a great spot for a dessert -- or to use them for takeout -- but probably best to get to know them and order in advance.   

The shelves do seem a bit bare -- but trust me, engage the owner or the girls in a conversation -- ask him what he likes -- their food couldn't be fresher, or their hearts any bigger -- and when I see a family working this hard in this business with such passion, I can't help but want to spread the word...",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,11,6,5,ZXMjT8DgxmFRdU9Fn8ekYg

First of all, the home baked pita is very authentic, not your run of the mill dried out sandwich pocket. It is light, airy and moist.  Worth checking this place out just for the pita. It will re-define what you thought Pita Bread is.

When it comes to Middle Eastern food, I have 3 items the tell me if we are in for an authentic experience or not. Baba Ghanoush... it should have the taste of the fire roasted skin of the eggplant.  Bingo!  Houmous, a delicate back drop of tahina and lemon on the tongue. Bingo!  And finally, the Harissa, it should be fiery but you can taste the flavor of the pimento as well.  Bingo!!!  

The owner's neice, Shada was a very comely and sweet young lady that took care of us.  The owner's family are Palestinians that grew up in the Israeli town of Nazareth. So there is a mixing of the two cultures in a world peace sort of way.  We had found this balance when we traveled to Israel and spoke with Palestinians who lived inside Israel.  Not to get off on a rant, but it shows that there could be peace if folks would just sit down and start eating together. 

If someone's ear isn't accustomed to differences between Arabic and Hebrew they could easily mistake this place for an Israeli owned cafe.  They both kosher and Halall meats.  

This place is about 2 to 3 miles west of the strip.  But worth the drive to get away from the maddening noise of the casinos and sit down to a home cooked ethnic meal.  And as long as you made the drive out to the westside of town, they share a parking lot with Trader Joes.  And who doesn't need snacks in their hotel room.

Before I forget, their pastries were delicious, my favorite was the baklava.",5cLMtgDsJDIeTVupFmFweQ,1,0,5,TtinE44tMAAA-PNWkxBABw

So, we ordered the regular food, and tehy made the desert while we were having our lunch which was heavenly, everything is so fresh, and delicious. the owners are soooo concerned about the customers satisfaction, when I bought few items from the bakery to take home after the meal, I asked if they had whole wheat pita bread, and because they had the whole wheat pitas baked the day before, and not the day of the sale, they refused to charge me for the pitas, which by the way turned out to be heavenly, I wouldn't have known it was baked the day before if they didn't tell me.

The pita it comes in is fresh, fluffy, and they'll add a delicious dollop of hummus upon request. I also really like their gyro sandwich with lebneh. Both sandwiches come with your choice of tasty toppings like onions, tomatoes, two kinds of cabbage, pickles, hot sauce, cucumbers, etc. Their tahini and hot sauce can be added or served on the side in a bottle - I do both. Another favorite, even in the summer, is their lentil soup. It is velvety and flavorful, we always share a bowl and fight over it, haha. Sometimes we get a piece or two of their baklava - again, the best I've had in Vegas. I really like the baklava cigars, they're rolled up and yummy. Note: Last time we went we ordered two sandwiches and some soup. The owner came to over to apologize after we paid because he hadn't realized the soup was almost out and he didn't want to give us the bottom of the pot.

Such a hidden gem in the Trader Joes plaza center on Decatur, very near the cross street of Sahara near the used book store. If it wasn't for Yelp and the amazing reviews I wouldn't have known about this place. 

I had come to get my nails done at a location right next to this place and afterwards I was feeling hungry. I walked over and was greeted by a lovely waitress. 

I had the Gyro sandwich and I have to say everything was DE-LISH! The food was fresh, the meat tasty. The staff was incredibly friendly.

I noticed tons of people coming in and ordering their breads to go! The pita bread is made in their bakery in house which is a real rarity and were so good you could eat them alone and be satisfied.

I sat in front of the pastry display, so I was ""forced"" to stare at all of those flaky little pillows of deliciousness. I literally couldn't leave without having a light little dessert. Wonderful place for a quick and hearty meal.

Make sure and save room for the baklava...SO good and it's dripped with honey and full of pistachios - delicious!

I have to mention that the A Rating was also a pleasure to see! Make sure you check this place out, you won't regret it! They also cater!

I had long been craving sabich (ch pronounced like a hard hhhhhh, other transliterations use sabikh with a K) since the Israeli joint on Fort Apache and Sahara closed down over 3 years ago.  A little birdie told me Amena had sabich, so on a trek from UNLV to Centennial Hills, I stopped here for lunch.

Fresh-made pita daily, this place smells good and has a wide variety of menu items including sandwiches with schawarma, falafel, lamb to veggie pies, hummus, lebneh, etc.  I stood in line and looked frantically for sabich on the menu, but it was not there.  However, the staff resassured me that it is available, ""off-the-menu.""

Sabich is essentially a pita stuffed with eggplant, hard boiled egg, and amba (a sour mango spread).  Amena serves it with hummus instead of amba, and then allows you to stuff it with all of the healthy fixins': red cabbage, green cabbage, diced onions with a tomato paste similar to harissa with a hint of spice, cucumber, sliced onions, and pickles.  It was a MOUTHFUL!  The staff set s'chug (hot pepper paste) and tahini bottles on the table.  I also got a Mexican coke to drink.  

The sandwich was overfull of deliciousness, endless flavors, crunchy fresh veggies, soft pillowly fresh pita, a variety of beautiful colors, hot and soft eggplant and eggs....drool!

Earlier that day I had a coworker bring me lentil soup from this restaurant which was the best I have tried so I decided that I would actually go there for lunch. Upon entering the establishment I did notice there were a handful of people enjoying lunch so I kind of instantly thought it was going to be a great experience and since it was so close to work, I would probably make this a frequent place to eat. That actually would be the farthest thing from the truth!

I walked up to the counter and was not acknowledged for several minutes even though the women working behind the counter made eye contact with me several times. I reviewed the menu and decided on the lamb gyro platter and was going to be also getting a side of hummus to go for the girls at work. After a few more minutes a middle eastern couple came in and instantly the lady behind the counter said to them ""Hello"" and they replied hello back, still nothing was said to me, they started to talk in a language that I did not understand which was no big deal and they all looked at me, so the worker comes up and said ""yes what would you like"" I placed my order and also added an iced tea and went to have a seat. The couple ordered their food and sat down. 2 other middle eastern guys came in, immediately placed their order, the lady came from behind the counter gave them a hug, seemed friendly here. A white couple came in stood at the counter for exactly 8 minutes, I timed it and was never greeted and then they left without ordering anything. 

The 2 gentlemen that came in long after me were served their food first, then the couple immediately behind me received their food next which did include stuff that looked to have been cooked longer than lamb gyro meat. It was about 40 minutes after I sat down that I finally received my gyro that was not put together at all, I guess you have to build your own here.  I asked for my drink and she was all ""Oh I forgot"" then after she dropped it off I asked if there was any way she could bring me silverware and the hummus I ordered?  She laughed came back and literally dropped it on my table!  Nothing to go with the hummus either so I ended up having to go to Trader Joes after I finished my Gyro so that we had something to eat the hummus with.  

A few other people came in that were not caucasian and were promptly greeted and served faster than I was.  

Although I look caucasian, I am mixed but feel this is the first time someone discriminated against me for being part white! I know that sounds ridiculous but also witnessing the caucasian couple not be acknowledged at all makes me believe that these people really do not want anyone in here that cannot speak their language.

As i was leaving I did see the lady behind the counter and say ""Thank you, have a nice day"" and she just looked away.",r0rbHEB7kWJKhzweCOeyeQ,11,0,1,UOVH6jGbuSLs_K_Ux9SQVA

The gyro plate could have made 2 sandwiches easily and the combo plate would have been good for 2 people.

While the meats were just fine, I can't help but think the quality of the meat and technique is below a place like Khoury's.  Still, it is a bit more affordable.  The hummus nice and flavorful.

The pita was fine though if they were made in house I'm not sure it was much better than store bought.  Perhaps they need to be eaten closer to when they were made than I was able to.  All in all I was very happy with my meal.  Also like that they gave you bottles with tahini and hot sauce.  Put as much or as little as you like.",-Ox7QPz0G56GOzT0ex-f5Q,2,2,4,GqYu5Ux-eyrsylcIdmd1hw

I love that it's a stuffed pocket and not just folded up like a taco and the bread is fresh made. This was how shawarma places I frequented as a kid did it. It's also awesome how you can pick your toppings! I like that they give you a bottle of tahini for the table since I loveeee tahini and pepper paste. 

The falafel itself was crispy, but still fluffy inside and had good flavor. We are coming back for this for sure. We also tried a shawarma and this was good, but it's not quite the shawarma I'm looking for. Good spices, but the meat didn't come from a spit, but pan. 

We also grabbed some pastries. Two baklava, a flowery ""macaroon"" of sorts, a date cookie. The baklava is money. It was syrupy in a good way. When you bite in it's moist with syrup, but it's not overly sweet. Definitely will be getting. The other two were just okay, I don't think I'd get again. 

Prices were reasonable. Two sandwiches (I think they were $6.50 each), two drinks, 4 pastries was $26.

5156369,2012-01-19,1,i3mZIwNi1EiJ7-1A8amoyw,"As much as I love it, I was scared from Mediterranean food after a previously bad experience. My brother, though at another time and place, was in the same position as myself - mine regarding falafel, his over tabbouleh. But we braved it to Amena after a time to the Korean spa to regain both hope and nourishment. Amena threw out of my inhibitions - evident through the empty places and pleas for dessert that soon followed.

My brother and I ordered based off our usual technique: divide and conquer. This meant ordering both the vegetarian plate ($9.99) and the Combo plate ($13.99). Soon after ordering at the counter, our food was brought out, and the Mediterranean bloodbath shortly followed. The vegetarian plate soon became both of our favorites - with hummus, babaganoush, falafel, potatoes, a savory Greek yogurt, salad, and tabbouleh. The babaganoush was so fresh and undiluted in its eggplant essence. The falafel was fresh out of the fryer, and absolutely blew my mind in its simplicity - who knew chickpeas could taste so good? The yogurt was literally thrown on everything, and made everything that was delicious infinitely better.

The Combo plate included beef and chicken shawarma, more hummus, falafel, potatos and another salad. The meat was really good, but honestly, we were more enamored with the veggie plate as we're not big meat eaters (also, we're suckers for babaganoush). Regardless, we finished off two plates within ten minutes or so. But I didn't even mention the pita! Fluffy, freshly baked, and housemade? My brother and I devoured the pita just as fast as we devoured the plates of food in front of us - rip, rip, meat! Rip, rip, falafel! Though we were offered more, our waistlines could not handle the carb overload.

Then there was dessert. Initially, we had wanted to order fried dough stuffed with cheese topped with honey. But somethings are just not meant to be - evident through my inability to pronounce the dish and the fact they ran out of the dough. The proprietors then suggested the kanafeh with cheese (around $7 for a small) as an alternative. Neither of us had a clue what I just got ourselves into, but a few minutes later, I ate my way out of oblivion. Reading my brother's review, the kanafeh is comprised of phyllo dough so thin it resembles vermicelli noodles. Throw that onto of cheese and drizzle honey and pistachios on top - that's a kanafeh. Seeing as we devoured two combination plates and pita upon pita, we failed to finish the kanafeh (much to our waistline's dismay). But it was the perfect marriage of savory to sweet, crunchy to melty. 

To be honest, the food was only have of the experience. The service was above and beyond graciousness. Within two minutes of entering the restaurant, both of us were offered free dolmades - the grape leaves tender and fresh with the lightest rice filling I've ever had. The owners were always so sweet - always asking the two of us if we were doing alright, how the food was, constantly offering more pita. Suggesting this dish or that dish, their upselling would normally be off-putting, but when the food is as delicious as Amena's or the people as nice as they were, I don't mind one bit.

For months, I had bookmarked Amena. It was only until every other establishment as an option fell through that I was finally able to cross it off. Luckily enough, the gods were in our favor that day. The hospitality and the sheer deliciousness make the summer, when I come back to Vegas, seem so far away now.",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,3,1,5,pTjpWXEGGnucUYudyL6NjA

The first time I went to Amena it was for their freshly baked pitas. AYUMYUMYUMYUM: that is me devouring a bag of delicious Amena pitas. They are like little clouds of joy in your mouth. I have never had a softer pita, and they stay soft in your cupboard for a long time.  Plus, they are a good deal. I can't remember how much exactly, but you are going to be pleased. Do not settle for grocery store pitas when you can get these for the same price or cheaper. 

Moving on to the falafels, as you may know I think the best falafels in town are at Mad Pita; however, these are a strong second, and depending on my falafel mood, I might choose Amena over Mad Pita. They aren't as crispy and fried as I might enjoy, but they do taste scrumptious. Plus, the pita execution is solid. Have you already forgotten about the pitas? Well, let me remind you: AYUMYUMYUMYUM! At Amena, they do a pocket style delivery, so it is an easy handheld meal. No folding here. No fork and knife required. Plus, they have the little salad bar where you choose what you want in your pita, and are you ready for this, I am not sure if you are, but here you go: pickles. That's right. They have precious pickles for your pita. I love pickles, so when you add those to falafel, you are talking about a potentially habit-forming taste combo.

I am warning you: don't get addicted, but if you do, I'll be there to take your falafels away from you and eat them myself. Yes, I would do that for you.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,16,10,4,Fipmk0dd1UUnCfunm7vT_w

Tucked away in a shopping plaza on South Decatur Boulevard, Amena Mediterranean Café & Bakery focuses on Mediterranean Food ""cooked with love,"" and although the restaurant, bakery and specialty goods store may not appear to be much from the outside those venturing through the doors are in for something quite special served by a team that really does seem to pour a lot of passion into what they do.

Owned and operated by Amer Hamed, the native Nazarene originally looking to fill a niche based on the foods of his homeland and a focus on Halal Meats and dietary traditions, entrance to Amena Café is much like many other similar styled eateries with a counter to the right and tables spread leftward, patrons eyes diverted to a pictorial menu board hanging overhead without prices while both laminated and carryout menus tell the full story with costs very affordable.

Just under a quarter filled during the early lunch hour, many of those present speaking in Hebrew clearly regulars, it was with warm greetings from one of two women that patrons were greeted and after a quick perusal of the options the decision to invest in the ""Veggie Combo"" and Gyro proved a great way to take a wide look at the options with six styles of Mezze plus the Sandwich and warm Pita making for a fairly substantial meal.

Offering take-out and catering, in addition to table service, it was with the kitchen slightly backed up by a few large orders that perhaps a dozen minutes passed listening to the ethnic music above, and although the warm water with Lemon had a slightly 'off' taste in desperate need of softening the food itself showed no signs of compromise, first bites of the Chickpea Croquettes showing a golden shell give way to pillowy insides nicely tinged with Salt, the tiny Dolmades amongst the very best of the genre without overwhelming bitterness from the Grape Leaf while Salads were merely decent, though Tabbuleh has admittedly never been a dish that I've enjoyed much.

Spreading both the creamy Hummus and smoky Eggplant puree on warm Pita and briefly pondering whether better versions of either can be found in Sin City, first bites of the Gyro showed signs of a kitchen willing to let the richness of Lamb shine despite the addition of Cucumbers, Tomatoes and tangy Yogurt dressing, the $8.99 pocket probably big enough to be shared by most diners, though it also holds up well for leftovers to be enjoyed later.

A bit more spendy on sweets than savories, cookies and baklava ranging $2.00-3.50 each with all pleasant enough, though none prone to wow when compared to others in the city, a better investment is found in the $9.99 Kunaffe with Cheese, a Honey soaked take on Palestinian Kanafah with soft white Cheese cooked stretchy beneath crumbled Pistachios and Semolina threads that is as rich as it is delicious and also still great when reheated.  

Obviously investing a lot of time and effort into the concept while carving out a niche that has been widely embraced by descendants of Israel and other nearby lands, Amena Mediterranean Café & Bakery is a great place for lunch where one can eat as healthy or heavily as they choose to, some items better than others but all-in-all certainly a good choice for the genre and area.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,6,4,WVMdI5KoZMlgcgqyVu_-Jg

5373433,2012-01-03,1,i3mZIwNi1EiJ7-1A8amoyw,"For a long time I was stuck in a rut and went to only one Mediterranean restaurant since it was close to university. Thanks to Yelp and other Yelpers I am trying all these new places now. Amena is by far one of the best I have tried yet. My sister and I came here after a day at the Korean Spa. We had sweated out all the alcohol from the night before and came here for healthy food. 

The restaurant is set up so that you order at the counter and then they bring the food out to your table. As we were looking over the menu, the owner came out and offered us a sample of their dolmades. These are probably one of the best I have ever had. The leaves are tender and the rice filling gave it a nice contrasting texture. Served at room temperature, it was hard not ordering some. We ended up getting the vegetarian plate ($9.99) which consisted of hummus, babaganoush, 4 falafels, tabbouleh, potatoes, Greek yogurt, and a salad. After the last encounter with tabbouleh, I never expected to eat it ever again. The previous restaurant made it entirely out of parsley and had me thinking I was eating grass. Not at Amena, theirs was a good mix of cucumbers, tomatoes, wheat, mint, parsley, and lemon juice. The babaganoush was magnificent. Light and no one flavor was over powering. Like an ensemble cast, there was not one star, they all gave stand out performances. Like everyone mentioned, the falafels and pita are noteworthy. Moving on to the next plate, the Combo ($13.99) had beef and chicken shawarma, hummus, falafels, potatoes, and a salad. Ripping pieces of the pita and using my hands was my only thought. Utensils only slow down the eating process. Squirt some tahini and homemade hot sauce for perfection. Good thing they place a bottle of each on the table. I could not get enough of anything. Before we knew it, both plates were empty and all the pita was gone. 

It is crucial to save room for desserts. Being a bakery, we wanted a cheese stuffed dough dish tossed in a honey sauce, but they were out. Instead, the owner recommended the cheese kanafeh. When it came, we were in awe. My sister guessed that it was phyllo dough, I thought it was vermicelli noodles. Looking it up, we were both right in a way. It is phyllo dough shredded up to vermicelli like strands that has a light spread of cheese, browned in butter, soaked in a simple syrup, and covered with crushed pistachios. 

I had got a Turkish coffee as well. This was my least favorite item. It was too loose. I am used to it being thick foam and almost sludge like near the end. I also appreciate it when it is sweetened for me. I ended up not getting any sugar added to mine because usually it is sweet enough, but not this time.

With the friendliness of the staff and the quality of food, I can't wait to go back.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,5,4,5,XW0OtYG8Eqs8hpn_Zr6ckw

5390450,2012-08-02,1,i3mZIwNi1EiJ7-1A8amoyw,"Visited Amena for the 2nd time today.   First time I tried a falafel plate with an order of lentil soup and was actually quite disappointed in most of the items I had with the exception of the falafel which I found to be a very tasty version.   The lentil soup tasted medicinal to me and in all brutal honesty was the worst version I've had and for $4.95 I quite simply have no desire to ever order it again, though I would definitely give it another go if it came as a side to something else I ordered, but I don't see that as an option on their menu.  This is a little frustrating for me because I love ordering lentil soup from EVERY Mediterranean restaurant I go to and don't really want to spend $20 each time to do it.  AND IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.  

This time I decided to flip the script and go with the combo plate which came with several of the aforementioned delicious falafel, a healthy serving of hummus, some Beef and Chicken Shawarma, a side salad, and one piece of pita for $13.99.   Frustration point #2.  REALLY?  One piece of Pita?  With the huge amount of hummus they provided with the combo plate I really expected several.   For a comparison of my favorite Mediterranean choice, Hedary's provides 3-4 pieces of Pita for each and every lunch special ordered (and a choice of soup or salad to boot!)    Mmmmm, hedary's lentil soup.....  Okay sorry, back on track.   For what it's worth, that one piece of Pita was fantastic.  Fluffy, delicious, and perfect when dipped into the hummus (which I found to be a good version) or when used as a pocket for stuffing falafel and/or beef/chicken in it.  I REALLY could have used a few more, particularly for $13.99.   The beef and chicken shawarma had a really nice flavor from whatever marinade they are soaked in, though the meat did seem a little dry/overcooked.  The side salad was neglected by me like a red-headed stepchild which is the norm and nothing against Amena.  

Lastly I also ordered some of the homemade lemonade which I just saw Nelson mention is blended with mint.   I actually would have liked something to mention this fact on either the menu board or when I ordered it because I think I would have much preferred it plain.   It was decent even with it, but I'm not a big mint in drink guy.  

On pure taste of the food I had today, I'd give it 4 stars as the Pita, Falafel, Hummus and Shawarma all hit the spot.  Docking it down to a 3 based on the previous Lentil soup experience and for not being an overall good value in my opinion with the skimping of pita and pricey lentil soup.

The sign isn't very noticeable, but it caught my eye because it listed some foods that they had. I am really glad that my boyfriend and I decided to check it out because we were not disappointed.

I have tried Baklava before, but I didn't care for it that much before. This place makes it just right. Not too sweet, which is how I like most of my pastries. 

My boyfriend was raving about the Shawarma, so we ordered the lamb Shawarma. It was wrapped in pita with veggies and yummy sauces. If you like spicy, definitely get the spicy sauce in your Shawarma! It is just the right amount of spice and tasty. 

I want to come back and try their Turkish coffee with Baklava of course!

As we are not very familiar with the city of Las Vegas it took us a while to locate it.  It turned out to be a good idea to explore small local restaurants outside of the Strip. The price was good and the food was excellent. We had ordered a vegetarian plate and kunaffe to go. It was plenty for two of us. My husband went to get the order and he said that the lady who helped him was really friendly and welcoming.

I wasn't disappointed...it was pretty damn tasty. There were a few other people in the cafe eating when we arrived and we decided to eat in as well. The proprietors were super friendly and asked if it was our first time there. They totally made us feel right at home, as opposed to a couple other places we have tried recently where we felt like total outsiders/intruders since we weren't regulars.  

We ordered a falafel sandwich and a hummus plate with falafel. That plus a couple bottles of water was under $20. The bf had the falafel sandwich which was stuffed with a variety of toppings (I had to have a few bites and it was delicious). The hummus came with 4 falafel balls and a stack of super fresh, pillowy pita (and way more than I could eat so I took half home--Mmmm midnight snack!). Soooooo good. I could basically eat nothing but hummus and pita  everyday and this is some of the best I've had--I'm definitely going to be frequenting Amena for takeout hummus and pita in the future...looking forward to trying the babaganoush next time too!

First thing I noticed: there were empty tables full of food. 3 tables were being occupied at the time but the rest of the tables were unusable because they were ALL full of left over food. I have no idea how long they were actually sitting there for...it was disgusting...but I really wanted to try their mint lemonade. There was one person ahead of me in line waiting to place their order. We were the only ppl there that had not been helped yet, other customers were already sitting and eating. It is now my turn to order. I place my order and ask how long it'll be. The cashier replies 5-10 minutes. I raise an eyebrow and say ok...wondering why it would even take more than 2 minutes if there is no one else waiting for a drink... I walk around for 5 minutes then sit down at one of the dirty tables that no one has even made a move to clean this whole time...12 minutes later...the customer ahead of me has gotten their meal and the cashier is just joking around with the cooks in the back. I approach her and ask how much longer will it be for the lemonade I ordered. She laughs and says ""omg I forgot you were here!"" Uhm? I say nothing and just look at her. She runs off and brings me back the lemonade she made 2 minutes later. Let me repeat that again. 2 minutes. AND let me also point out she was the one who made it. Not the cooks, which is who I assumed was to make it since it was taking so long. She hands to me still laughing. I take it and turn to walk out and she shouts behind me: GOD BLESS YOU!!!! This whole experience was enough to to make me never return and stopped my office from trying this place. The level of professionalism was beyond negative and the attitude of the workers was just appalling. The fact that this cashier instead of taking initiative to clear the tables for customers to sit or make my drink while the cook made someone else's order decided to just fool around is disappointing. I hope management does a better job of managing their staff and teaching them proper work ethics.

Very friendly staff that gave us a couple of extra pieces of pita for our sampler and the salad was very good with a nice variety of stuff.  Came out to about $16 for two.  

I still don't get how restaurants in Vegas can get away with calling their meat ""shawarma"" when its cooked in a pan.  It should be on a skewer or spit or something like that.

They're pillowy and light and taste how pitas should, not like from the grocery store. They also have what I think is a homemade hot sauce and it's actually spicier than anything I've had at other restaurants. The tzaziki sauce is also really good. And they gave me and my sister these amazing dessert samples while we waited for our take-out order!

Not a huge fan of their hummus or talziki sauce but the falafels and pita bread are amazing enough to make me want to come back soon!

If you love pita bread... stop by Amena's for their daily fresh baked pitas which comes in minis and regular size. I got a bag of minis to go :))

After lunch here today with my gf... I'm a big fan of Amena's falafels and pita bread! We both enjoyed Amena's!

I was at the hospital and literally yelped ""healthy food"" and searched the surrounding area and settled on this place due to high reviews.  It was easy enough to find; it's in the same plaza as Trader Joes.

There was only one person working in the front, but I did show up 30 minutes before closing time.  I ordered the lamb gyro.  She was nice enough to ask if it was okay to include all the ingredients, because that reminded me to ask for no onions.  I also ordered a chicken gyro, but unfortunately they were all out of chicken.  I asked for a recommendation, and she started explaining the falafel sandwich.  I was sold.

I took both to go.  It took about 5 mins for my food, just enough time to run to Trader Joe's and buy a bottle of wine.  Both items came out to ~$16.

I had the falafel sandwich.  It was really delicious, clean, and surprising light.  I wasn't ridiculously full afterwards.  I did feel like ALL the ingredients were really strong though.  The falafel were falafelly spiced by themselves, the hummus was very strong, and even the dressed greens were super strong in flavor alone.  All together, everything created a party in my mouth, and my mouth was happy.  I would highly recommend a strong mint afterwards though if you're eating in the restaurant (especially if you come here on date night).

I can't wait to go back and try more items off their menu.  Despite their strong flavors, the food was really delicious, light, flavorful, and really reasonably priced.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,4,1,4,Xk0h6XFTcyfzETStPxHypw
