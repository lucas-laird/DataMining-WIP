Summer 2016

I wanted to take my parents to a different restaurant, but they just  wanted to hang out at Circus Circus. Sigh. 

The chicken noodle soup was surprisingly delicious! The tasty broth was comforting, the egg noodles made me feel real good, and the fresh vegetables added the homey, classic flavors in the soup. 

The soup of the day was very good, too . It was beef..uhhh..I don't remember the name. It was a little salty, but I liked it and so did my parents.

For our dessert, we shared a Cinnamon Roll. It scratched the itch I didn't know I had. It was sweet and cinnamon-y good! I like how they heated it up, what a nice touch! 

Customer service was quick and courteous! I can't think of any reasons to give it less than 5, so 5 stars it is!

I was served undercooked breakfast sausage at Westside Deli two mornings ago and I will never forget the experience. A friend and I went to the Westside Deli for breakfast before a daytime concert that morning. The line moved along quickly and all seemed well. When she and I arrived to the cashier, the woman that was taking our order was mumbling rude comments about another co-worker that hadn't completed an order. No big deal, but she kept interrupting my friend and I as we were trying to order. Finally, we waited for our turn to speak and ordered our breakfasts. The food came out fairly quickly (that should have been the first signal), but I was too hungry to care. The portion was big, but I was hungry so I ate just about everything on my plate. The breakfast sausage was the only thing that felt ""off"". Later in the day, I could feel signs of indigestion and then felt the nausea hit me like a bus. My friend and I had to cut our concert day short because I couldn't walk 10 feet without wanting to vomit. Eventually, I made it home and the end was not pleasant.

Out of all the casual food offered in the Circus Circus, I think Westside Deli is one of the more decent places to go.  If you can find this place through the poof of smoke that engulfs this entire casino, give it a try.  It's not authentic AUTHENTIC deli, but it will do in a hunger pinch.  Plus, you ever been to Circus Circus on a weekend?  So damn busy!  For me Westside Deli had the shortest line.  Sometimes that can be seen as a bad thing, but thankfully for me it worked out OK.

Westside Deli offers deli sandwiches on its main roster, but does have other mostly American fare.  Seems like a decent enough place for a quick breakfast or a speedy lunch to-go.  They do nachos & chili, foot-long hot dogs, soups & salads, and even tacos.

I focused on my go-to when I visit a new sandwich place - for here it is the Clubhouse ($8.99).  It is a triple-decker sandwich on toasted bread of your choice (got sourdough), with roast turkey, crispy bacon, lettuce & tomato.  The sandwich comes dry if you request to-go because there are mustard/mayo packets available on the side for you to take along with you.  Nice touch, because no one likes a soggy sandwich.  If you choose to eat there they will ask if you want mustard/mayo on your sandwich.  Sandwiches also come with your choice of chips, coleslaw, or potato salad, and a pickle spear.  I went with the potato salad.

Verdict!  Not that shabby!  Sandwich is actually HUGE, barely fit in the take out container!  Lots of sliced turkey, and the bacon was actually crispy.  Lettuce & tomato were fresh and bright.  I liked that you could add the mustard or mayo separately because you can add as much or as little as you like.  Pile on that creamy mayo, baby!  They also had packets of salt & pepper available, so adding that to my fresh tomato gave it some flavor.  Plus, what is potato salad without pepper!  Love my potato salad with a ton of pepper for some reason, always have.  Overall this was a good sandwich with some pretty good (store bought) potato salad.  The portion was large for the money, I ended up taking half of it home for a snack later.  Good lunch fare.

I would be back here again for this sandwich, and maybe try something else on the menu.  Only problem is that I'm hardly ever in the Circus Circus, and I'd be hard pressed to drive here just for the Westside Deli.  If you're staying at the hotel it's a good option, for a more authentic deli experience you should go somewhere else.  But I was pleasantly surprised.",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,0,0,3,1DL1F8uGGja-cRL50D2llg

- The California Sandwich has bacon, ham, swiss cheese, lettuce and tomato on wheat bread. The portion of this sandwich is enough for two! 
- The ""Sunwich"" is cheese, ham and egg on an English muffin with a side of their seasoned chunky potatoes and bell peppers.

Not your best choice by far.",p85Lq9SorEmHjhLZg3l0cw,1,0,1,jYG5qJuDyG7ByuuscAKQ8g
5717452,2018-04-27,0,hAHa78Q1os9Gvuq6Uti-0A,10/10 for this little deli! It's a hidden gem. The BLT was amazing. So much bacon it was unreal! My friend got the turkey & bacon melt & she said it was delicious. 100% would come back into this hotel just for the sandwiches here.,9MDC77o2jzPln3vfjYf-QA,0,0,5,99YgYcH7cKuIrRB8aeCXrw

The food is always fantastic, French dip is my favorite, and the girls behind the counter are always nice and smiling. The boys in the kitchen always know what I want, as I come here so often, and usually have it ready before I even finish paying for my sandwich.

Prices have gone up, WAY UP, so I don't come as often as I used to.",VpbLmKPXyHA1pqEREliW-Q,1,1,4,yorHkQAs3DjFwNaN9Nm_WQ

Reasonable prices, good portion sizes. Had a Roast Beef Sandwich with side of coleslaw all for $8. Grabbed their Meaty ""Sun""wich on checkout day, and it was awesome. Staff was quite friendly and welcoming.",DrcmOMLc1Qeo9mYsmrnvLg,0,0,4,BQkr7PdKjMvmC17wmTRsEg
