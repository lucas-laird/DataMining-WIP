A bit hard to find, but something good doesn't always come easy right!? Is what we were thinking. From entering we noticed a lot of sugar skulls and day of the dead art and figures in the restaurant which I thought was pretty neat, and different. After looking over the menu, my boyfriend and I decided to just get  chicken, and carne asada tortas. By our surprise, each one was deliciously seasoned/marinated and full of flavor. My boyfriend said, that had to have been the best carne asada he's ever had. After finishing our plates, we thought, if the chicken and asada tortas were delicious, we could only imagine the rest of their dishes. After speaking with the owner and the chef... They have so much passion for what they have created and that is why it shows through their dishes. Will definitely be back, with friends!!",wJW66z3hToX8Yi-9AD1BGg,2,0,5,x8FMLdgYk6mDyCLhp_aANw

Loaded with shrimp, perfect sauce-- just amazing!! Chicken, carne asada, and adobada tacos were pretty disappointing, but they are cheap. Would be 5 stars if the tacos were better than Tacos el gordo, but they arent. Wish I tried a burrito instead. Owner is very nice.

This location is horrible in terms of getting to. I'm glad they're moving nearby me on 215 & Rainbow. They should really update their hours and news like people said.

It is on Paradise leading into the airport in a business plaza that looks like homeless people live there. Don't let the exterior fool you.  The inside is clean and nice.  

Now on to the food. I agree with many of the other 5 star reviews.  I lived in San Diego for 18 years and in Las Vegas now for 14 years.  It took a long time for me to find Mexican food that tasted as good as what I used to get in San Diego.  I am working my way the menu. So far everything is great, tacos, burritos, tortas, and chilaquiles.  I also like that they care enough to use non-GMO meats.

2013680,2016-09-16,0,l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A,"After seeing this place on Yelp with its impressive 5 full stars and seeing it mentioned in a couple articles about must try restaurants, we had to check it out. My husband and I are always in search of great Mexican food. We haven't found anything even close to the  places we frequented in our hometown of San Diego. And we've been here for 15 years! We've found Mexican food here that's good but nothing that screams authenticity. El Fresco's is drowning in authenticity. 
Let's start with the fresh made chips & incredible salsa verde that is brought to your table. We've noticed, recently, that free chips & salsa has disappeared at newer Mexican restaurants. Which breaks our hearts. Chips & salsa is like the ultimate precursor to a great Mexican meal. It's like telling your mouth & tastebuds, get ready! We're having a fiesta! 
I opted for an al pastor taco & the much written  about shrimp taco. There aren't enough words in all the languages in the entire world that can describe how fresh, flavorful and delicious that shrimp taco is. Literally bursting with juicy, delectable shrimp. Drizzled with a chipotle mayonnaise that packs a punch. The shrimp & the mayo were made for each other.  And the al pastor? I could have eaten those all night long. Cooked to perfection, the flavor was out of this world! 
My husband went for the super max burrito with asada. This isn't just a burrito, it's an experience. It's huge. Rice, beans, cheese, pico, asada, guacamole & sour cream served on the side and covered in an enchilada sauce that brings it all together. First of all you would never find this burrito at any Las Vegas Mexican eatery. And if you did, it'd be at least $15-$19. My husband let me try a generous portion of his burrito and I immediately starting hoping he'd be too full to finish it. The asada was mouth watering tender and everything inside complimented each other perfectly. It was easily the best burrito. Ever. Epic. 
Service was excellent. The chef who is also the owner was super nice, gracious and modest. Our waitress recommended the perfect items and was very attentive. 
We can't wait to go back. We will have to wait as we only have Sunday's off together and El Fesco's is closed on Sunday's. But the first chance we get, we will be there!",qiA5QI85-A2WB5lKRlyCIQ,2,6,5,WouSFKadXBf1fGnRsINRXQ

In the words of my 4-year old ""This is the best quesadilla I've had in my entire life."" Same goes for the pastor taco salad. Fish tacos were good, but not as outstanding as everything else. And the service was attentive without being annoying.

One thing to note before you go, they don't serve free water. So be prepared to pay a couple dollars for a Smart Water, buy a coke instead, or just go without. But it was a minor inconvenience I'm certainly willing to overlook.

I LOVE that they use Non-GMO fed beef and chicken and one of the owners, John, is very passionate about keeping it that way!

The place is located in the most unassuming of locations. I pulled up and really didn't think I was at the right place. It's nothing fancy on the outside.

2205277,2016-09-22,0,l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A,"It was kismet.  A few weeks before heading out to Vegas for a conference, BuzzFeed ran a piece on best or most visited taco joints in each state.  El Frescos was listed for Nevada so I book marked it in Yelp for my upcoming trip.  

After tiring of the strip I hailed an Uber with my sights set on El Frescos.  Like all the other reviews state, it's not easy to find but well worth the search.  It's located in what appears to be a car processing center for the airport rental services.  There are 3 parallel, nondescript, two story strip buildings perpendicular to Paradise Rd.  El Frescos is on the first floor of the second building. You could easily drive in and out and miss it.

Someone wrote that it has a ""hole-in-the-wall"" feel.  It is though, truly, a hole in the wall.  Seating consists of perhaps 6 tables and a couple of hi-tops on the sidewalk outside.  The kitchen is easily visible and appears immaculate.  It is family-run, giving it a completely relaxed, homey feel.  It's table service so I picked a seat and was quickly provided a basket of chips and salsa verde.  Both good but nothing to write home about.  

I had read about the shrimp tacos so I was bummed to not see it on their menu.  Fortunately, it, along with fish, seem to be regular specials of the day.  I opted for the fish tacos on the recommendation on the hostess and the fact that they use Mahi for the fish.  Amazing.  Absolutely top notch.  I saw the fish being prepared and was blown away by the portion.  What arrived were two stuffed fish tacos.  On a base of cheesy corn tortillas, they piled the most tender and richly flavorful nuggets of heaven I've had.  You would think they were poached in butter.  They were topped with a slaw and creamy sauce as well as a slice of avocado.  The plate was complimented by equally tasty rice and refried beans.  I couldn't finish the entire thing and took home a taco and some beans and rice for another meal.

I also opted for a side of guacamole for my chips.  This was solid.  I was a little surprised when they mentioned that they didn't have much guac left for the day considering I went at about 4pm and I believe they were open until 9.  I would worry about them killing a good thing if they start running out of basic food-stuffs before dinner.  That's the quickest way to lose customer loyalty.  


My entire meal, with a bottle of water came to ~$19, so this isn't cheap street fare.  But I would have no problem spending that again for the same meal and hospitality.

My first bite into one of these had me thinking out loud, ""Holy sh*t, that's good!""  Without a doubt, the best shrimp taco I've ever had.   The shrimp seasoned and cooked to perfection, the avocado and chipotle mayo on top, all of these contents lay atop  a flour tortilla with a side of chips.  My fellow Yelpers and I can't all be wrong with this... I'm coming back for the shrimp tacos alone!

I also ordered the three taco combination (chicken, pastor, and cochinita) and a chicken quesadilla to go while my daughter had the deep fried ice cream before we left.  The tacos were scrumptious and came with beans and delicious rice.  The quesadilla was large and we ate it over lunch and dinner.  My daughter very much so enjoyed her dessert.  The fried ice cream is essentially vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and a cherry over a bowl seemingly made out of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.   Yummy.

Locating this place can be difficult at first.  Driving towards the airport on Paradise road you'll want to turn left on the second left turn possible after passing the Best Western on your left side.  

My only irk about this place is their store hours.  Twice, I've come here at their listed opening time of 10 AM.  Both times, the restaurant was closed.  This second visit, a clock sign on the window states ""Be back at 11:00"".  Of course, I returned to the now open restaurant at 11 and when I asked the staff what their store hours were, they told me they normally open at 10:00. 

On the one hand, I would love to come here the moment it opens so I can get my hands on another one of their glorious shrimp tacos ($6 btw).  On the other hand, I'll probably wait an hour until 11 to make sure I don't arrive disappointed.  This is a very good spot to stop by at if you're heading to or through the airport.  You won't get any fine dining experience at this little hidden treasure but you'll get some seriously great authentic Mexican food.

2970951,2016-02-03,16,l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A,"Guys... seriously.

Located in the sketchy buildings right off Paradise and just before the airport exit, you'll find some of the best tacos to hit Vegas. El Frescoes keeps it simple with classic ""abuelita"" styled entrees and insanely fresh pickled veggies and soft tortillas. The menu, located on the wall is loaded with classics like tortas, burritos, tacos, and chilaquiles. I went with the tacos, three different ways, cochinitas, el pastor, and a shrimp taco. All of them, I mean all of them were delicious. 

The Cochinitas, were so tender it was a magical. Literally, the kind of tender pork where you start to wonder, bite after bite, if the pig that gave his life for this meal came from a, ""Swine Spa"" where he was massaged for hours on end and only fed the finest pig slop. 

The El Pastor. The other magical white meat was just as good, tender and crispy on the ends with a perfect amount of raw onions and cilantro. El Frescos pork game is strong and just note, but el pastor tacos should be eaten in pairs, just sayin'.

Shrimp Tacos, I salute thee. The shrimp used in these refreshing little pockets of heaven is actually a full sized shrimp that are seared and chopped up on a hot surface and placed in a flour tortilla, unlike the two porky predecessors that came in a corn tortilla. These shrimp tacos come covered in a cool zesty cilantro sauce with just a hint of heat. Who knew eating tacos could make you feel so good! 

EL Frescos also makes their own chips and salsas. The habanero is very good, but a total creeper. Eat this one slowly, you've been warned! 

For those of you who are used to the typical spacious Vegas chain restaurant seating you'll get a rude awaking here. This spot holds about fifteen maybe twenty people on a good day, but the tight seating stays inline with the, ""hole in the wall"" vibe. 

El Frescoes will soon be that hidden gem hot foodie spot. So get here before there's no else to sit!",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,31,25,5,tKBdg1LpY-OKJfz2AWIAFw

The tortilla chips that he brings to the table are fresh served (lightly salted) with mild spicy fresh green salsa. 

Best ceviche in town (we hunt for good ceviche). Fresh, clean sharp flavors and GOOD size pieces of shrimp and fresh fish not soupy like others we have tried in the past. Tortillas made fresh daily by a company down the street.

It's in an unexpected parking lot, but it's in a great location centrally in Vegas. Skipping class at UNLV? Tacos. Driving a cheap person who doesn't want to Uber to the airport? Tacos. Going to the strip to play tourist but don't want to eat on the strip? These tacos. 

Got to sample two of each of their street tacos. The asada, pastor, chicken, and carnitas. All of them had a bold flavors and were perfectly seasoned. I'm not a fan of salsa but can tell you it was petty spicy from ""pinky testing"" it. I wanted to try other things, but was full after inhaling 5 tacos. My second stomach reserved for dessert didn't let me down, and their deep fried ice cream coated in Cinnamon Toast Crunch was fantastic.

I am super impressed!  As a Chicago native, I've been exposed to some pretty delicious authentic food, and these boys just nailed it!

As we approached the address, we slowed down so that we would not miss the driveway. There was a sign, so we knew we had finally found it. As we pulled in we noticed a lot of rental cars. These cars were of various makes and years, all parked around the entire lot. There were people in the back part of the lot working on even more cars. It was a bit unsettling, but we parked in front of the restaurant so that we could see our own car.

The restaurant is fairly small, but very clean. You are able to see the kitchen, and watch the food being prepared. We were given the opportunity to choose our own canned or bottled beverage that was in a cooler, and chips with green salsa were brought to our table. The chips and salsa were very good. Fresh and flavorful. 

We ordered the Shrimp Taco plate that came with rice and beans, along with tacos al pastor. We could hear the food sizzling as they placed it on the grill, so that was really nice. We also ordered guacamole, which came out right after we placed our order. It was fresh, bright green and tasted wonderful. It had red onion, and a nice lime flavor. Large chucks of avocado really made this a treat. 

The tacos pastor was our favorite, besides the guacamole. These were so flavorful with tender meat seasoned just right. We were super excited about the shrimp tacos, but were disappointed. The colors and presentation were really nice. Big pieces of shrimp, and a slice of avocado made these look wonderful. But the sauce was so salty I almost could not eat it. My husband likes salt on pretty much everything, but it was a bit much for him as well. The beans were really good as well, and the rice was a nice addition.

Guacamole 5
Beans/Rice 4.5

My daughter and I came here after riding the New York New York rollercoaster and it is safe to say that is my new favorite restaurant! The manager was so polite and catered to our requests! My daughter ordered the quesadilla and I had 4 carne Asada tacos with sour cream and cheese! BEST TACOS I HAVE EVER HAD! A couple weeks later I came back with my sister and was definitely not disappointed! Food was absolutely delicious! If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out!

They seemed surprised to see us announcing our arrival to the staff on a Friday night. But great service, clean, and the food was amazing! BEST SHRIMP TACOS we have ever had. And we are from San Diego! The guacamole, salsa and fresh warm chips started off a delicious dinner. One problem was that they don't have a liquor license yet. Not even for beer and wine. They've only been open for 7 months. This will be our new go to place off the strip for Mexican. Just wish we could've had a corona or Margarita with our awesome food.",lROOmGGQ_ojXgq5kGHOBtA,4,4,5,wdPPe2rQDRj1OBa3XO-SrA

We started with the shrimp tacos, which are absolutely the most incredible that I have ever had.  We then enjoyed the Al Pastor tacos, followed by the carne asada plate.  This meat...I mean, I don't understand how it can have such amazing flavor.  So I ask John and David, the owners (and lifelong friends, it turns out), and they tell me that they are obsessed with finding the best beef, and that the carne asada is so amazing because it came from a cow that had been raised on a farm in Cali, grass fed only, and butchered within a few days of me having it served to me.  Unbelievable.  Seriously!

The crazy part is, I hadn't even tasted the most delicious thing on the menu, the Cochinita Plate. Braised pork covered in red onions.  When I got it, I started removing what I perceived to be too many onions.  John, the owner, watches me do this and politely says, ""You're going to want to eat ALL OF THOSE"".  Haha...I thought wow, he thinks he knows me...and I tell him that I like onions okay, but not that much...and then I tasted them.  Holy Moses!!!!  Probably the best thing I have ever eaten in my entire life!!!  As I'm piling the onions back on, he just smiles...and I realize that he's just happy to share some of his favorites with others.

I asked for 2 more plates to go...knowing I would start craving it later, and left perfectly satisfied.  I happened to be in Vegas with my brother again yesterday, and so if course I had to take him...and he, of course, is now addicted as well.  Nice job, gentleman...you free me away from the buffets on the strip, and I may never go back.  Thank you!!!",a3cAWtrxBYUB_SKwEe3ixQ,1,0,5,JxH3qDRoUiIP-Mcb3UsB3A
5719113,2016-06-20,0,l1GJnB9TJgGgEeI4at1M0A,Mexican food in the southwest is like trying to find a McDonald's. They are on every street corner. El Fresco's is about as authentic as it gets Eland not your run of the mill Tex Mex. Short of the UEFA Euro being in English it felt like the restaurant I ate at in Mexico a few months back. The carne asada plate was ridiculously good and I left thoughtfully satisfied. I am not a fan of salsa verde normally. The salsa verde they give you with the chips was so good it has changed my opinion. Only drawback is you have to keep your eyes open once on Paradise. If you miss it you will be taking the airport return to try to get into their parking lot on the 2nd go round. I will easily go back there.,kvVqwxloc5kcRI0893wqNQ,0,0,5,5MTK71Sy0S7qzSiYOQEcLw

I've been there quite a few time already having tried their fresco torta both asada and al pastor both pretty damm good. ive had the super max burrito and let me say if you can finish that beast your a true champ. i could barley eat half the burrito and let me say that burrito was one damm good burrito. its very convenient place to stop by and grab food right before i head into work as i work at the airport i give them a call and they have it ready for me when i get there. great customer service and of course great delicious food so if you have some time to spare whether you work near the airport or at the airport trying to catch a flight this place always hits the spot. definitely a hole in the wall no doubt about that.,jbqTVD_gqm996hvN9op3_g,1,1,5,IkCZdQOdzh92B4E4opCYFQ
