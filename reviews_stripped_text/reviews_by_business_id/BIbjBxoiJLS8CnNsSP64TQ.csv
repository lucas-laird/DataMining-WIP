I knew food would not be served on my flight and I didn't have time for breakfast before heading to the airport.  Once I got to my gate, I didn't see any other close options and I like burritos so I went for it.

Yuck, yuck, yuck!  The chicken burrito I ordered had rice, beans, and no flavor.  Even adding their salsas to the burrito could not save it.  I have no idea what process they use to remove flavor from food, but they should stop it.

I paid $12 for this thing plus a drink, which isn't a bad price considering I was trapped in an airport, but I felt ripped off after tasting it.  I ended up throwing the burrito away.  At least my Diet Coke was good.

Maybe Chipotle, Freebirds, Mission Burrito and any other restaurant that sells a burrito has spoiled me.  Maybe the quality is better at locations not in the airport.  Maybe they should all be shut down.  I don't know.  I just know I will never eat at any 360 Gourmet Burrito again.

We actually didn't eat here. We checked out the menu through the window and it seemed great. Different, fresh, healthy! However while observing the kitchen and employees, we saw how unorganized and unsanitary it was!!!! It was horrible! In the 5 minutes we stood there...the female cook (with tattoo on neck and red glasses) although did have gloves on, kept touching her face to straighten up her glasses. Then continued to wrap burritos. Then she went to the corner (next to door that leads to storage room, it seemed) and munched on some food. Then went straight back into the kitchen, while still chewing and grabbed some tortillas to put on the grill!!!! Disgusting!!! All of this in front of tons of customers!

They were getting ready to close (who closes at 6:30?), so maybe that had something to do with it.  The burrito had some kind of off peanut buttery taste to it, and despite the fact that I was starving, I managed to only eat a couple bites before giving up.

- Prices are not terribly expensive for airport food
- Don't expect great service. Remember, it's airport fast food
- Chicken based burritos are awful here. 
- Tofu veggie burrito and shrimp burrito are better, get those
- Small. Chipotle has spoiled us all. This is a ""normal"" sized burrito which is about 70% of the size of a Chipotle one
- Pre ready and packed salsas are nice to grab quickly. But, there is a catch: they all are terrible. 

Remember also that this airport has so few decent food options that relative to others, so I cannot say ""avoid, go elsewhere"" since the going elsewhere is actually pretty hard to do.

360 Gourmet Burrito would seem to be modeled as a low-class Chipotle.  Obviously minimal investment in quality and presentation.  I ordered a grilled chicken burrito.  I threw it away after four bites, but that was half-a-burrito too late!  I already had my worst indigestion decades -- It lasted about one hour per bite.

I'd suggest that you try one of the other places, but the best choice is to bring your own sandwich.  Or take advantage of the situation to start a half-day dietary fast.

The chicken was cooked well, e.g. not raw nor overly cooked.  The peanut sauce was slightly present inside the burrito. It definitely could have used more sauce or even a separate container of sauce to dip the burrito.

The Thai wrap was enjoyable to eat and fulfilled the job to hold me from starving during a 4.5 hour flight.

Saying that the dining options there are limited is an understatement. I had a layover in Vegas on a flight from Chicago to SF and was actually excited that my flight was taking off through the B Concourse, having previously exhausted all of the choices at the C Concourse. That excitement turned to disappointment when I found that there were only really two places to eat at the B end. I opted for 360 Gourmet, a burrito place that seemed to have limitless custom options.

I was pretty hungry, so I ordered the burrito bowl with sautéed shrimp. Feeling particularly daring, I opted to ""Jazz it up"" Thai style, which cost more but promised carrots, jasmine rice, and peanut dressing. That should be good, right? I also ordered chips and salsa. No drink. It was close to $17.

I was impressed that the food is actually prepared fresh right there on a series of burners. I was cautiously optimistic. But when I got my food things changed. First of all, the bowl was very small. Now I recognize that as a culture we tend to overindulge when in comes to cheap food by consuming oversized portions of food, but this was ridiculous, especially considering the cost. I took the bowl back to my ledge (they don't have tables or chairs) then realized that I had not yet received my chips, so I went back to the counter.

""Can I please get my chips?"" The woman at the counter looked at my quizzically.

""Oh,"" she replied. ""I didn't know you wanted chips. I didn't hear you, so I didn't charge you.""

I went back to my ledge and came back with the receipt that clearly showed that she had both ordered and charged me for chips. Without saying a word, she went to the back and dumped a handful of chips in a paper bag.

Ok, now on to the shrimp bowl. It was bland and tasteless. But wait, what about the peanut sauce? And the carrots? I looked the bowl over closely and went back to the counter.

""Is this Thai style?"" I asked.

""Yes.""

""Where's the peanut sauce? And the carrots?""

""It's in there."" Well she could've told me that she also threw in some lobster because there was as much lobster in my bowl as there was peanut sauce. So either she lied, she didn't know any better, or their food is so bad that the sauce is entirely unrecognizable.

Either way, I couldn't finish the bowl, despite its small size. It just wasn't worth eating.

This review may seem a bit on the harsh side, but seriously - if you find yourself at the B gates, then walk over to the C gates. The food options aren't great but they are miles ahead of this slop they try to pass of at 360 Gourmet. If you don't have time then go to the Einsteins across the way and buy a prepackaged chicken wrap. You'll be happy you did...

Needless to say, I will not be back. I'm half guessing that this place will be out of business within the year anyway.",vWLHqiJu5Z2tRghSH8ammw,4,0,1,wHnuO4C7t_N74KRVo5WC2w

I usually have really high standards for service and hospitality, but, in this case, I say give them a f*ckin break.

Why am I giving them this many stars?  Well, their food was really good.  I expected to pay quite a bit because it's in an airport, and yet, the taste of their burrito actually exceeded my expectations.

I ordered a Garlic Lime burrito with prawns, with a bottle of water.  The burrito had a perfect balance of tangy lime and a bit of heat, with Spanish (tomato based ) rice and grilled prawns, all wrapped up, piping hot.  

Honestly, I would pay a few extra bucks to eat their burrito over other typical airport food any day.

The only thing I wish they had, were more fresh/healthy side selections.  I would have loved to tack on a little side salad or a fruit bowl to my order but I didn't see any.

Tofu breakfast Tacos....yes....not on the menu but ask for it. With a greasy ranchero sauce and a flour burrito wrapped around the grilled soft tofu this was uplifting in the morning. I had cheese on mine (oh my) but you could easily veganize this without. 

I thought that was as lucky as I could have gotten...and then I tried their Medium Red Salsa (note: they have a pretty decent salsa bar). Heaven on earth. The combination of the tofu taco and the salsa set the tone for my gastronomical adventure on the trip to come. I also needed a pack of gum right after.

Their menu of tacos/burritos/bowls is extensive and there are many veggie options that include tofu. The people working here were very sweet and helpful. Note that the taco I had was rather greasy and I didn't necessarily like that part of it. 

Considering the airport generally sucks for any meal option for the vegetarian/vegan, 360 definitely helps even out the equilibrium. In relation to other airport establishments I'd give 360 a 5 star review. But in relation to other restaurants, 360 would have to get a 3.

I was crunched for time at the airport, hungry and 360 Gourmet Burrito was literally next to my gate.  I originally wanted the rice, bean & cheese burrito, but was told they were out of beans. Hmmm, really? A burrito place that's out of beans pretty early in the afternoon? Ok.  So, I decided to be adventurous and try the Thai Burrito.  It was carrots, jasmine rice & spicy peanut sauce with my choice of protein (I opted for tofu).  It also had grilled peppers and onions.

After paying $12 for a burrito and a drink, I was optimistic that it would be a nice taste-bud deviation from the standard burrito.  After one bite, I was HUGELY disappointed! The entire burrito was completely overwhelmed with the sauce, which didn't taste a thing like peanuts, but a lot like crushed red pepper. You couldn't appreciate any of the flavors of the other ingredients.  Truly a let down.  I managed 3 bites because I was really trying to like it, but it didn't happen.  It ended up in the garbage and I got on my plane still hungry.

 In my experience, anytime the word ""gourmet"" is used in a restaurant name or to describe a food item, run fast and run hard! I just want food.  Food that is tasty and food that satisfies.

Unfortunately, the B9-B15 gate area has only two options, this and Einstein Bagels, and neither has anywhere to sit and eat. 360 has some uncomfortable standing positions only.  

I ordered a quesadilla with cheese, guacamole,  and steak. What was served to me was a grilled, nearly-burnt tortilla with cheese and a little steak folded into it. No seasonings (the quesadilla is supposed to have tomato, oregano, cilantro, red onion, diced garlic & jalapenos, but all had been omitted. As was the guacamole, for which I had paid extra, and the salsa. And weirdly, it was served in a bowl.  

I took it away to try to find somewhere to eat, and only then realized what I had received. Took it back, was given a tiny condiment cup of guacamole and one of salsa.

So imagine my surprise when I discovered a 360 Gourmet Burrito shop during a recent 2 hour layover at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, Nevada.  I'd actually eaten at a 360 Gourmet Burrito restaurant in San Ramon, California (Near San Francisco) and really enjoyed to food there, so I entered this restaurant with high hopes  in spite of their two star Yelp rating with over 60 reviews which would normally have caused me to steer clear.

I decided to switch it up and try one of their bowls, and chose the curry bowl with steak that comes sauteed with veggies over rice.  I can't say that it was the best curry bowl I've ever had, but it was still far better than a lot of airport food I've endured.  The steak was not overcooked, the rice was fresh, not starting to dry as if it had been sitting around, and the quantity given was decent.  It was far better than fast food would have been, yet not quite up to my memory of the other 360 Gourmet Burrito location I visited.  

All in all, I don't regret having eaten here and would probably do it again if stuck on another layover here.  Better than your average fast airport food.

One of the worst things in the world about traveling is the lack of decent, healthy food in airports. There is nothing worse than getting off an ugly early morning flight covered with that airport funk feeling, and having to choose between McDonald's and Chili's Express for lunch. 

Luckily, in Vegas you have options. At least in the C gates (I think).

The menu is very unique and has lots of options - asian, curry, mexican, meat, really the combinations are endless. The staff was refreshingly (for an airport) friendly, and helpful. When I tried to order a curry veggie wrap, the guy actually said he wouldn't recommend it because it would be soggy - go with the burrito instead. 

I listened to his advice and was glad - the wrap was amazing, and I was stuffed, ready to take a nap on my second flight.

This is where airport food comes into play.........

Gang, when you deal with airport food.......you know very well you will be rolling the dice! 

First hand...........the food will be expensive, and usually it's lousy! But hey, you have the option of not buying it.........it's either expensive lousy food, or you can eat air! 

For me, I like expensive lousy airport food when you're hungry. In fact, I've eaten my share of airport food though the years...........as my job had taken me all over the U.S., so I've sort of gotten accustomed to expensive lousy airport food.

While I was waiting to catch my flight to San Jose the other day, I spotted a joint called - ""360 Gourmet Burrito"".

What can I say, two words which caught my eye.........

1. Gourmet - Bing, Bing, Bing, Bing! Gourmet leads me to believe it's gourmet food (but who am I kidding!)

2. Burrito - I love Mexican food, so burrito.........especially a breakfast burrito sounded good to me.

And what did I get gang?

I got an EXPENSIVE LOUSY burrito! Lol! 

All kidding aside..........it was maybe a 1/2 star above a lousy burrito! Good for at least a 3 1/2 star rating.
At best, the food was just average.........but this place was a lot better than the other airport dumps I've been to in Las Vegas like - Auntie Anne's, or Baja Fresh!

For $15.00 bucks, I got a burrito, & two cups of coffee. 

I must say.........the coffee was really good,..........only because this place did not make coffee. They sell you the cup, and you go across the way to another business called Einstein's Bros. Bagel to get your coffee.
