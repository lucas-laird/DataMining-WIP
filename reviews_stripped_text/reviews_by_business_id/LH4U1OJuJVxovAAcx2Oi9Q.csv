How hard is it in the pizza delivery business to deliver to a big pyramid one mile down the street?

The interior design of the restaurant portrays a montage of New York's historical photos of people, the busy city, and its brilliant landscape. It is a cozy space and the aroma of freshly baked pizza makes the place so warm and inviting. 

They serve big slice of New York Style pizza. You can choose from their Specialty Pizza Menu or you can Build Your Own Pizza. Their menu include appetizers like Fried Ravioli, Garlic Knots, Jumbo Chicken Wings, and they make Stromboli fresh daily, as well as pasta like Lasagna, Baked Ziti and Fettuccine Alfredo. Also they offer chicken and veal entrees, Eggplant Parmigiana, hot and cold sandwich, salad, and dessert like Cheesecake, Homemade Cannoli, Tiramisu, Italian Cookies, and Italian Ice.

I went for the Eggplant, Roasted Peppers, Smoked Mozzarella Stromboli ($8.99). Egg wash is applied on the dough and after it has bake, the Stromboli comes out nice and golden. I really like how they make the Stromboli taste so crispy, and the filling is full of delicious flavor. There are layers of eggplant cooked with egg, the roasted peppers are soft, the smoked mozzarella taste yummy, and I like dipping a piece of the Stromboli in marinara sauce. Since the food taste this good, I will most likely be a regular. And if you are a local, they do offer local discounts.",dpvR4LYXr0CYHtHf8BeCKg,4,1,5,MRyDWf8cP9BiwjrMtWRbgw

 I ordered delivery since it was on a Friday and it is chaotic here due to the high volume of locals and Californians for their weekly vacation. So the orders came in an hour later.

 The man that delivered the pizza got confused because I said veer on the phone but he thought he had to go to vdara, lol. The delayed wait was like a minute so it didn't really matter. Overall, he was a champ and was nice about it as was I.

 In the end, the food was extremely well made and the pizza was delicious. I won't say the best because I had better but definitely one to look out for. The prices are cheap and no hassle at all.

It was one of the nicest gestures I've seen in a long time and it reminded me that the concept of great food and great service isn't dead. 

The cold sandwiches, the hot sandwiches, the wings, the fingers, the desserts, the salads; ALL top notch. I dunno if they ship the water in from New York for the dough for the pizzas and the sandwiches, but it's amazing how these taste of the foods and the look of the place itself, reminds me of New York.

4438886,2018-05-13,0,LH4U1OJuJVxovAAcx2Oi9Q,"The service at this counter-service location puts some sit-down restaurants to shame. The staff was super-friendly and super-helpful. We were surprised that two of the staff were not owners. They treated us like they owned the restaurant. On the second occasion, they comped zeppoles and garlic twists. 

The first day, we had sandwiches, pasta and pizza. I had ""Da Bronx"" which was ham, salami, capicola, provolone, lettuce, tomatoes, oil and vinegar for $8.99.  The sandwich was listed as seven inches, but it seemed longer. Generous amounts of meat (though ham predominated) on an above-average roll.  By ingredients, I wished I had the Staten Island, which had prosciutto, ham, salami, capicola, mozzarella and toppings. Very filling, you might want to share to eat a larger variety of food.

The pizza is sold by the slice, as well as by the pie.  On the first day, I pointed to a very good slice, but I cannot tell you which one it was. On the second day, I had ""Da White,"" olive oil, ricotta & mozzarella with no red sauce. That was excellent. The thin, thin crust was very crunchy, and the pizza was top-rate, if not up to New York City standards. 

The zeppoles were good hot, and there were cold free samples as well.  I had a few bites of tiramisu which was good too. 

The fountain drinks had Coke products and crushed ice. Typical quality for a non-chain fountain machine. 

Definitely recommended.  Very close to five stars.",oU0DXZINZpr7BpHp9Bi0mA,0,0,4,VxIbADK_5XrylTIvaHR4Pw

First time, I ordered a large pizza with sausage, peppers and pepperoni, a side of cucumbers, onion and tomatoes in oil and vinegar, a hot chicken cutlet sandwich and an order of wings.

Yea, I know, a lot. But that's what I do when I check out a new place. Makes for good variety and great leftovers. 

Pizza was on point. Foldable and flavorful. Cucumber mix perfect. Cutlet sandwich was instant happiness. The wings were great and I'm from where they began so I consider myself a bit of a connoisseur. In Buffalo, they are served with carrots and celery AND BLUE CHEESE. I was offered ranch. Ranch. What are we in Oklahoma? For the love of God and all things holy please...it's blue cheese. It's always been blue cheese. 

You wouldn't eat a peanut butter and mayonnaise sandwich would you? That's because it's peanut butter and jelly. 

It's wings with blue cheese.

Now if some weirdo's want ranch, let them have ranch or mayo or whatever. But for those of us who know how wings are to be served, please I beg you.

I met the owner Dennis, cousin of Rocco. Solid guy and a good sport. He patiently heard me out about my blue cheese groanings. He remained unmovable even though clearly I haven't been the only one begging. 

He's a good sport. I like him. A lot. But I'm bringing my own blue cheese next time!! Blue cheese exasperation aside, 5 stars all the way. And say hi to Kim. She's from Buffalo. She also knows it's supposed to be blue cheese!",MxFNcMUjU5FXG2uqFYiP_g,1,1,5,ecv56r0sqrTf9e01YJOnxg
