What I didn't like is that I went up and ordered with no line (sounds great if your flight is going to board soon right?) thinking it would be quick... Only to find out their were 6 orders waiting before mine! That's a little extensive for what should be quick turnaround considering you're serving people who are getting on flights. Okay, maybe I was being impatient? I don't think so, their were 3 employees and it seemed like only one was actually peeping the food which is why it was taking so long. One lady that had been waiting had to ask about her order and the gentleman apologized and said he would make it right away, as if they had forgotten or lost her order. 

Not to mention, a lot of their stuff is over priced like crazy... Almost $6 before tax for a medium or large chai latte?!?! No way I'm spending that much when even Starbucks doesn't charge that much for the same thing!

I ordered an everything bagel with plain cream cheese and tomato. I moved over to wait and watched as everyone that ordered before me and just after me received their orders. I went to the barista to get my order filled. She was very kind and walked to the bagel line to tell them what she needed. But she whispered something. Didn't sit well. First flag. When she gave it to me, she rolled up the bag though she hadn't done that for any of the other orders. Again, flag.

As I walked away I had the feeling that I should look in the bag, but didn't know where I was going and thought I should focus. Well, when I made it to my connecting gate, I was sorely disappointed to see that I had nearly NO cream cheese.

I ordered a toasted blueberry bagel with salmon shmear. They didn't toast my bagel. My brother ordered a toasted bagel without cream cheese. They did not toast his bagel plus they added a bagel with cream cheese that they charged him for. When I poured my dark roast coffee another customer brought it to their attention that they gave her the wrong bagel. We were about to board a plane for Chicago and didn't sweat over the small stuff.

  Obviously the Terminal B Einstein Brothers Bagels is not sweating over the small stuff such as their bagels. It leaves a poor impression on the business when they are out of sesame and poppy seed bagels at 6 in the morning. But they sweat over the big stuff: making a profit. The bagel with salmon smear and coffee that costs me $5 and a few pennies at a local Einstein Brothers Bagels costed about $6.50 here. 

  Two things save this location from my pending ""Mad Check-ins: 1 Star places that Annoy Me"" list. Although the employees need to be trained to comprehend what the customer is ordering and to learn to toast a bagel they made the wrong orders fast and with a smile.

My hummus veggie something bagel sandwich was fine - but definitely nothing to write home about - and to reiterate, it took them a LONG time and it costs about the same as a burrito - so, unless you're really dying for a bagel and just need something to eat - I'd recommend going the other way to burritos.",R2vRgTl5TXVRHWE8a8TFyA,0,0,2,UTdn-5PkteH8xj9R0Gow4g
5649393,2016-03-13,0,GPVnzRcvlhEK0-c6PImyoA,"It's an Einstein's so you can't expect too much. My usual quality assessment of Einstein's centers on two things since the food is largely consistent across locations. The two things are: (1) quality of service and (2) timeliness, which is especially important since this location is in the airport.

1.) Service: The service at this location is average. One employee, who was preparing food, completely ignored us when we walked up. The lady who was at the register was very nice though; I enjoyed interacting with her. Our order was fairly simple, but we did ask to change the cheese on one sandwich. Unfortunately, this instruction was lost in translation and the final product didn't have the correct ingredients. I also asked for my bagel to be toasted and if it was, I couldn't tell. 

2.) The timelessness was good for an airport. They probably saved time *not* toasting my bagel. We were also the only customers in line so there wasn't a lot happening. 

It was an average experience at an average chain. You pretty much get what you'd expect.",bAK3Fl4aHEuCBfD_kMa7XQ,1,0,3,wNNMOpjgKrXTDBJtSLdmkQ

May I suggest a strong cup of dark roasted coffee from Einstein Bros. Bagels! Ummmmmmmm, what a right way to start your day! Yay!

I was waiting at catch a flight out to San Jose when I decided to get something to eat from a burrito joint within the McCarran airport. 
The burrito joint sold food & coffee, but the funny thing about the burrito joint, they don't make coffee (I'm glad). They sold me the cup for coffee, and told me I had to go across the way to a place called Einstein Bros. Bagel to get my coffee.

Lucky for me.........I think the burrito joint did me a big favor, as I've never had Einstein Bros. coffee before. 
I must say the coffee was rich & flavorful! I enjoyed it so much I managed tank down 3 cups of this coffee before I jumped on my flight out to San Jose! I wished we had Einstein Bros. in Hawaii......",-9da1xk7zgnnfO1uTVYGkA,8,8,5,-XvBms9DUTDLonMMBcz7sw

He asked what I wanted, and I said what I'd really like was an Einstein's bagel and schmear but that I would take almost anything. Lo and behold - an Einstein's RIGHT in front of our gate!

So Einstein's are all pretty much same, unless they're horrible.  This one was fine - the line was long, but it was 7:00 am in an airport, so what do you expect? The food was actually really fast to come out!",h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg,0,0,3,iqeVOdjQ55HIRd8n2WjRAw
