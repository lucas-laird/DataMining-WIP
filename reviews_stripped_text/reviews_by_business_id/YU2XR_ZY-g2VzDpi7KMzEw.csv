I've never had an avocado drink before, but this avocado slush with boba was delicious! The avocado slush had a rich, nutty flavor. The boba was a very nice consistency (chewy throughout) and tasted like it was boiled in brown sugar (yum!). Came back a second time to order it again because it was THAT good.

I also tried the Rose Green Milk Tea and it was quite fragrant! I have tried rose milk teas at other boba shops, but this place has the best tasting one. You can really taste the rose flavor in the tea, but the green tea flavor was overpowering, so I'd probably just order the Rose Milk Tea next time. 

Avocado Slush with boba - $5.45 ($4.95 without boba)
Rose Green Milk Tea with boba - $4.75 ($4.25 without boba)

Service was pretty quick and the girl who helped us was friendly. Visited on a Sunday afternoon and a Tuesday evening.",l6Vb0ItAJnOA0cIDCAv9fw,0,0,4,VisLlv4BIhp0Q6w03lp2cw

My husband found this place through Yelp; and found the similiar dessert posted...so we figured we give it a try.  Sad to say it was not the same one.  It looked very similar but did not taste the same.  I forgot exactly what I ordere but it was strawberry ice cream topped w/ mango.  It probably wasn't ice cream because the texture was a lot different.  It was just okay.  My husband got the peanut butter toast which was a fat piece of bread w/ peanut butter spread.

Their crispy pork with rice came in a bento, accompanied with corn, a soy sauce-marinated egg, and veggies with some noodles. The pork itself was like a Taiwanese-style seasoned tonkatsu, and balanced well with the veggies and corn. It was awkward trying to eat out of that container with a fork and a knife, but I managed well enough to finish my food.

Ordered a large yogurt green tea with boba, which was a mixture of green tea and those Yakult-like yogurt drinks you can get at the Asian market. It was both tart and a tad bitter, but got better as the melted ice diluted the drink. I really like the consistency of their honey boba, since it was cooked properly and tasted lightly sweet.

Spent about $8 for the meal and $4.50 for the drink. Well worth my money since I'm still full and content as I type this review about seven hours later.",EHvPZx_EY_s4r_5K6fL6tg,3,2,4,Msu90tasVR7Hsvipd_TfKw

Since we only came for boba, we had great service. The server was nice, and the order was quick. The boba-- delicious! 

Boo got a honey milk green tea, very flavorful and not overly sweet. Share your suggestions if I'm wrong, but I got a caramel milk tea, something I have not yet found at other boba spots! It was also delicious, with a pudding addition. 

I can see how during peak hours, the smokers around the front can be deterring but on the off-peak, seems like a good place.

This is a good place to go and hang out and talk with some friends over bubble tea. For the price, the drinks aren't that bad, and they will add less sugar if you ask for it half sweetened. My go-to drink here is the Strawberry Slush Smoothie, which is the perfect blend of sweet, tart, and all strawberry.
Since it's close by, convenient, and open late, I like to go here with my friends to catch up. Although the staff isn't super attentive, they give us the basics, and don't tell us to leave even when we stay for long periods of time (that's a huge plus in my book!).
The food itself is satisfactory as well. I used to work around the area, so I would go from time to time on my lunch break. It was filling, and I felt that I got my money's worth. (The crispy chicken is super yummy here, btw. Get the meal version, and it's pretty bomb. Get the regular version to share with your friends, which is pretty good, too.)
As for the negative side of my experiences there, the biggest thing for me is the smell. There is a strong sewage smell that seems to permeate the place, and people are forever smoking RIGHT OUTSIDE THE DOOR, which is open half the time.  If you're seated close to the entrance, it smells like cigarette and sewage. If you're fortunate to be seated towards the back, you just get the sewage smell. Sometimes it gets quite crowded and noisy, but that seems to come with the territory of that plaza. Parking isn't always easy to find, either, especially if you're going on a more popular night.
All in all, not a bad place. I'll probably go there more often then not when it comes to hanging out with friends on this side of town.",kEaU0-HR_Foo0XogpUhVAQ,0,0,4,WSgYPYN4I4mOwWvcMBFErg

Whenever I go at night, it's always super busy. During the day, it's a lot slower and much quieter. They have a ton of options for their food which includes lots of appetizers such as crispy chicken, crispy squid or french fries. In my opinion, the french fries are way overpriced.  

Their juicy steak is pretty good. I usually get half pepper and half mushrooms. It is a huge steak, and they will put noodles on top which is delicious! 

I usually come here to chat with friends and just play cards or hang out. 

The service is usually horrible as most of the workers do not speak English well. It's better just to point at things. Don't expect great service because they won't give it to you. The food is so so.

The last time I went, I ordered a milk tea. My friend ordered a Jasmine Milk Tea with boba. The price was higher than I thought, and I assumed with a new menu meant that prices went up. However, the girl charged for boba. She already made the drink, and I didn't want to create a huge fuss and demand a new drink.

The first time I heard about this place was when my friend told me that Icy Juicy makes drinks comparable to those at Tea Station, but at a cheaper price. Being the boba lover that I am, I wanted to try this place out for myself. The first time I went , I was on my way home from work so I wanted to place an order for take-out. When I went in, the waitress handed me the menu and was literally tapping her foot while I perused the menu as if to say ""Hurry up, you're wasting my time!"" And mind you, it took me less than 2 minutes to decide what I wanted. Then when I reached in my wallet to pay with my debit card, she said, ""We can't use card for purchases under $10 (it could've been $15, I forgot)."" Nowhere at the cash register was there a sign telling me that they didn't accept cards for orders under such and such. Luckily I did have cash with me that day or otherwise it would've been game over. 

Their peppermint milk tea is almost the same as the one at Tea Station, I'll give them that. The boba is a bit too soft for me, almost as if it's been sitting in the pot for too long. Prices are decent, about $2-$4 for a drink. They do have cooked dishes and snack options, but I have not tried any so far. Icy Juicy is open late so I suppose it is an alternative to Tea Station, but I honestly don't see what the big deal is about.

The service is good and the owner is nice, will ask for feedback and seems to appreciate your patronage.

I'm not going to lie. It is a little FOB-y with the Chinese-to-English translations like ""top sales"" instead of ""best sellers"" or ""sala"" instead of ""salad"" but you tend to overlook these things because the snow ice (which comes in green tea, taro, mango or milk flavors) are so good.

It was too difficult to eat and not enjoyable since every bite had to be taken with caution; I was waiting to break a tooth.

It was good, but not what I ordered. Not sure I'll ever go back, mainly because I went on a whim, but I'm still disappointed. I also asked for soy sauce, which I'm not sure they carry, and was told by the staff member helping me that I wouldn't need any.

This time, my family and I came in because we all wanted something different from ice cream to milk tea to smoothies. My cousin asked for a mango smoothie but got a mango slush. We told the waitress but she said it's the same thing. It's not, but we got over it. I got the Chocolate Hazelnut toast and it was overwhelming to say the least. The toast was strictly a huge piece of bread with one side of Nutella and ice cream was extra. I asked for extra Nutella, but first the waitress brought sprinkles. I asked again and she proceeded to have an attitude. Honestly, she didn't want to serve us, she was more into sitting down and chatting with her friend. By all means, you can do that, but not when your job is serving people. She did not need to be rude. I think I will be going to other places from now on.",8oWOj-ORs5g9a6wpik3tFw,0,0,2,gjqSTuhl0cn-OIeJ_vVMAg

I haven't tried the food, so I can't review on that, but they have a huge menu.

The service is just down right horrible. I don't know if it's their accents, and I'm sorry if it is, but they always speak to me like they hate me. One time they brought out the wrong drink on accident and I kindly asked if they could fix it; I got the death glare the rest of the night.

Employee recommended the rose milk tea, I added boba- was really surprised by the quality, as rose drinks tend to be a bit too strong for my liking and/or obviously fake with overly-syrupy sweetness. Not the case here! Boba was also fresh, soft, and warm, with the perfect texture and a very generous amount.

Its packed here at night (which makes parking slightly difficult at times), but during the day its completely empty.

 I think the weakest aspect of this place is the service! The gals here can be nice, but they can be very inattentive and more interested in their phones. But what draws me back here is their jelly slush boba tea and hit sizzling plates which I really enjoy.

The place is remodeled to a more modern theme playing hip C-POP and K-POP over the speakers. The menu to me would have to mirror Tea Planet. The drinks are just as good or even better than Tea Planet. I got the tapioca milk green tea, milk tea, and passion fruit green tea. The drinks had just the right amount of tea flavor and syrup to achieve the perfect balance. The boba is also cooked to the right consistency, chewy yet still keeps its shape. I know how a lot of boba places butcher their bobas. The food/snacks they have are also similar to Tea Planet. 

However, the one thing that is a MUST TRY is their SNOW ICE. It's not those chunky pieces of ice but SHHAAAVVEEED. The ice is so fluffy like snow and you can't even tell its chunks of ice. I ordered the passion fruit & pineapple snow ice and it came in a decent size shareable for 2-3 people.

The drinks and food served here are decent but inconsistent.  One day you can create your own drink concoction and the next time
you just get a firm ""No can't do that"".  

The menu is extensive as they do offer a couple of pages of hot teas, cold and slushy drinks, with or without boba.   The prices are reasonable
with the exception of their Monster Toast which does not justify the $12 in my opinion.  

We have only tried the food once and thought it was pretty good but again inconsistent.  On one occasion we ordered sweet potato fries and a 
server brought us a plum powder to dip them in which made these unique and delicious, however upon our
return we tried to order the same thing and after a long stare and a trip back to the kitchen the answer was ""No can't do that""

SERVICE SUCKS! 
No one greeted or acknowledged us at the door, only 2 two-seater tables were taken, was not busy at all - so no excuse.

Took another 10 mins to place an order.

Series of ""hands in the air, like we just don't care"" to get her attention throughout the whole time. I just don't find it necessary to wait that long to be seated, to get our order taken, to ask for water, and to get our check.

We ordered a few boba drinks, the hazelnut toast, potstickers, and red bean with green tea snow ice.

Boba - wasn't impressive.

Hazelnut Toast - poorly executed, nothing special and it was JUST hazelnut spread on toast.

Potstickers - comes with about 8 pieces, pan-fried, wasn't a fan of the open sides ; little one liked it, so must be ""ok"".

Red Bean with Green Tea Snow Ice - the green tea shaved ice was really good, green tea flavor definitely stood out. I found the whole thing to be TOO sweet, especially after 4-5 bites because the ice was sweet, the red bean was sweet, then they top it off with condensed milk. Good but talk about DIABETES!

Maybe it's because I'm a sucker when I see fresh ingredients being used, but I feel like the world should be that way! Anyways, the boba tea is decent nothing spectacular. I have yet to order a fruit smoothie, I'd assume they use real fruit and not bs you like most boba places with syrup. However, my awesome experience for this place comes from the Taiwanese snow. This is so far the best place in Vegas to get Taiwanese snow. Although the menu is confusing to read, they actually have a wide and diverse selection on flavors of snow! They also top your snow with mochi and condensed milk without asking for it (this may be bad for others but mochi and condensed milk are a must for me!). The fruits in my snow were sweet and perfectly ripened. The snow and condensed milk worked together and had a nice gooey and flakey consistency. All in all, the snow was perfect!

I don't dig the crowd here too much. Maybe its just me, but I get a little uncomfortable being surrounded by fobs. Most the employees look fobby too... lol. However, these fobs have good customer service. I came in twice so far and was instantly greeted every time and served with a smile.

next, came the soup and salad.  this ""soup"" was half strainings of creamed corn and half water.  what do i mean by strainings? i mean the water that comes with your can of creamed corn that normal people throw away.  double gross!  the salad was a few pieces of lettuce and cheap hidden valley ranch.  needless to say, these two were barely touched for the rest of the meal.

next was the takoyaki.  i don't eat seafood but according to my friends, the black sauce that they pour on top tastes like chinese medicine.  it must be really bad for them to make that kind of analogy..

then our iron pan noodles (this is a direct translation of the chinese name) with black pepper sauce came.  the noodles were SPAGHETTI noodles.  anyone who spends enough time in a mall food court knows that these are the type of noodles that cheapy chinese places use.  the sauce that they slathered the noodles with was not exactly spicy.. but it made your mouth and throat burn.  either way, it wasn't appetizing and neither was their dried up piece of egg that they cracked onto the hot pan.

last to come was our strawberry flavored snow ice with strawberry and mango.  this was actually better than the milk flavored snow ice that i ordered in my previous review.  read that review to find out more details about the snow ice here!

finally, i came to icy juicy because i thought that it would be a good place to impress my friends with on our casual meal.  at the end of the meal, i ended up apologizing to them for forcing them to eat such crappy food.  the bill came out to 21 dollars.. which is actually pretty cheap for all that food.. but it is the type of food that i wouldn't eat even if it was free.. the service this time was a little below average.  we had to chase the waitress down for our bill and extra utensils (for some reason, they felt that a fork and a pair of chopsticks was enough for 4 people).  i have no reason to come here anymore unless all i want to order is a drink.",Iqm6Ig0NcKXkwPsT2RyRwQ,1,0,1,rjqBxalbRsyoMBSD4Ry8dw

Talk about small location. It located next too Cafe Moda in this little shopping plaza. Unfortunately not lot of parking depending when you go. I ended up parking across the street walked acorss. So hopefully able too find spot because its really hidden gem comes too dessert. Not many seats inside but back up always order your stuff too go. The menu is pretty diverse not just Boba more Boba and really highlight is the Snow Ice. Interesting. They put the hot food in back of the menu so if not look at it never know serve real food too. We did not partake in the food food. Sure there will be another time that try some of their food. 

The things I did try back-back nights was the BOBA. I love Tapioca Balls!!! The Tapioca Balls are awesome! They not skimp on them AT ALL. It Tapioca heaven ever spit till the very end. BOBA no expert but feel like not overly sweet but just the right balance. The first night I tried the kiwi-strawberry flavor Boba. Solid. Honest the second night the Mango Flavor was da bomb! So many more different fruit flavor too try sure just might find another one better. The Snow Ice thank Thanks too Terri for sharing truly the star dish at Icy Juicy. Being from Hawaii love my Shave Ice with mochi balls/ice cream. So hard too find any substitute like real kine Shave Ice. Snow Ice pretty darn close too legit. It different texture lot more smoother flakes of ice, comes with beautiful fresh cuts of fruits (kiwi, strawberry, etc), condense milk extra touch of sweetness over the top of the ice cream (you get choose different flavor ice creams), and love the presentation with the valentine shape bowl. Sure one that next trip going get my snow ice in!! 

One thing mention about the service is our server not talk english all that well. It came for asking for recommendations she not much of help. It comes too the check better off flagging them down or takes forever. Overall service if fine.

The best things they have going for them are being open until 2 am and getting orders out very quickly. My biggest gripe is that parking is absolutely horrendous and we usually spend a while circling around the parking lot trying to find an available spot. There's just too many businesses packed into this plaza!

Although their tea prices are kind of steep and rival Starbucks prices ($4.95 for a large!), I am happy they allow you to adjust the amount of sugar in your drink. I usually go with a large coffee milk tea, no sweeter and no boba. For food, stick with the appetizer type foods such as crispy chicken which is basically Taiwanese popcorn chicken. Their food prices are the opposite of the drinks and you usually get a really good portion for the price, especially the crispy chicken! The entree and noodle dishes aren't very good and I wouldn't recommend them.

Overall a good late night snack or chill spot if you can find parking!",zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,1,2,3,tGM3QfZd-NLUk_rHCjK03A

2300409,2014-01-21,0,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"This is my go-to place for boba. Their drinks are good but their service is hit or miss. They aren't very attentive but it's probably because the customer service demand is pretty low maintenance. Most people will come here and get a drink and sit for at least an hour to hang out with friends. Sometimes they run out of boba and the wait is at least 30 minutes. How does a boba shop run out of boba?! That always baffled me.

The food is great! My favorite has to be the crispy chicken and the sizzling steak with spaghetti. My mouth is literally watering as I am typing this! The crispy chicken is a great treat to share with friends. It's a pretty decent portion for how cheap it is! And the sizzling steak... omg! That is amazing. If you haven't had it before, please try it! It comes with a salad first then the steak comes out on a stone plate with spaghetti, an egg and the steak on top drenched in either mushroom or black pepper sauce. My favorite is the black pepper. The steak is always a little undercooked but I like it that way because I  can always just move the noodles out of the way and put the steak on the stone plate. It's much better than getting an over cooked steak IMO.

Anyways, another reason my friends and I come here is because they are open late and can seat a bunch of us... sometimes 15 in one area! Icy Juicy is located in a very busy shopping center. It's pretty hard to find a parking spot and sometimes, I have to park in the shopping center next door or across the street! It's pretty inconvenient but there isn't another place I have found that is open late and can seat all of us so we're not really left with much option.

Oh! Also, if you aren't a fan of cigarette smoke, try not to sit near the entrance. There are always people smoking outside and sometimes they leave the door open so you will be breathing in their smoke!",3r9BVzKJ7jA4SCDgjhBzZQ,1,0,3,CgVjZqzNrwyAtXUMJzTdPw
2393102,2014-05-02,1,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"Oh boy where do I even start..

I suppose the goods first: The drinks are very tasty, their boba isn't too chewy or hard like most places I have been. The atmosphere is also a pretty good spot to just sit, relax, play cards and chat with friends as you will find out. They have a really nice and large selection of drink orders and the extra usual's like egg pudding and grass jelly you can add. The food is mediocre at best, but this place is known for their delicious drinks rather than their food. Although I do enjoy their ""cripy chicken.""

On the other hand, their service is absolutely horrible. I am a huge regular there, and I keep going back because their drinks are good, but they lack severely in their service. Today I went in and sat for 1 hour with not a single hostess greeting me or giving me a menu. Instead they made eye contact a few times at me and sat at the counter talking and people watching. I would understand if it was busy but the place had about 9 people at the time total inside. Finally I asked for the menu at which they obliged by tossing it on the table and immediately turning away rather than handing it to my open hand reaching out for it. My drink came out delicious as I expected and I was satisfied at my little treat but when it came for paying. As soon as our server came back with the tab, she simply stood at my side and looked blankly at our table of 4 hesitantly not knowing who to give the check to. She was completely dumbstruck.. I reached out to grab my check and with my fingers on the tab she then moved it away from me and gave it to the person furthest away at our table who didn't even order anything.. Again disregarding my clearly open hand reaching for the bill. It was like this was her first time serving. The girls working here are completely ignorant and rude!

If you want decent drinks come here and go in  and out quickly, and get it to go. If you want service though, I suggest elsewhere. Kung fu boba is way better",oJV6f25IK_UeghoFmalPvA,2,0,2,8_so5kYrTtt5qVV82Suu9Q

WHO: boba-cravers, dessert-lovers, hungry people... Generally, everyone can find 
something to love.

WHERE: In the small plaza on Spring Mountain & Jones. If it helps, it's in the same vicinity as Cafe Moda & Cravin' Cajun.

WHEN: Conveniently; Monday through Sunday from 11am-2am. 

WHAT: Honestly, the way I heard about this place was one of my friends' instagram post of that beautifully-made MONSTER HONEY TOAST GOODNESS. That picture definitely caught my eye. Lol.

I met with one of my friends to eat lunch, and as we were brainstorming, this place came to mind. My friend had got there before me so she ordered a plate of food. As soon as I got there, I ordered boba (their boba was perfectly made, TO MY LIKING). I wasn't looking to eat a full-on meal, but was looking forward to dessert instead, so I just had the sald/pepper chicken. My friend was in somewhat of a rush, so we decided to order that monstrous honey toast in advance... 20 minutes later, it still hasn't come. I was wondering how I got my chicken wings in 10 minutes, but the toast was not yet in front of me...

We finally ask the server, and they kept it in the back all along (it was already made). Ok, I get it... they were waiting for us to finish our food, but c'mon... I WANT DESSERT. Another service downfall was that we had to keep asking for water refills, napkins, and the check... in conclusion, we had to call and ask them for everything, yet we were the only customers in there... NO BUENO on the customer service, but that TOAST is what keeps me coming back and forgetting about the service...",udpfGxriuoBdWRBdplJl-w,12,12,3,hPUCnT2RToea0x47Z-7u2A

Pros:
-- I like the fact that its open late so this has become my go to place no matter what time of day i'm craving boba. 
-- They make the most delicious cappuccino slush I've ever had, which is by far the only think i order. A must try! 
-- They give me a generous serving of crispy chicken and rice
-- Enough tables to accommodate a large group. They even seem to have a separate section towards the back for an even larger group and a couch area towards the front counter if you're looking for a seat thats more comfortable.
-- Food comes out hot & fresh and in a timely manner. 
-- Extensive beverage and food choices

Cons:
-- Service is kinda slow. There's probably only two people working and the person in front seems to be doing everything
-- There's a table outside, i guess for people who smoke, but they keep the door open so the smell goes inside

& the parking outside is limited which is obviously not their fault but something to keep in mind if you intend to go there during their busy hours.",OS-XAEbboJ_CiPFBU8yKVw,2,1,4,LzD-VsMx8rGXLlv3dgazcg

Thier drink selection is huge and rather daunting. I asked the waitress her recommendation between the two I was debating between and she quickly told me that the iced green milk tea was her favorite. 

Done, that's what I ended up ordering with boba. I enjoyed the iced green milk tea, but I also felt that it was very sweet. It left a film of sugar on my taste buds. I waited until the ice melted a little bit more in order to drink it, but by then my taste buds were toast- or shall I say sugar bombed. 

My boyfriend ordered the iced coconut milk tea with boba. His drink had a thick powdery consistency and the coconut flavor had an annoying artificial aftertaste. We both preferred my drink over the two. 

The boba was the best part. It was cooked perfectly and had the right amount of firmness and softness. It was also pleasantly sweet. I'm glad they at least got one thing right. I've been to boba places where thier boba tastes like dishwasher. 

We checked in on Facebook and also received 10% off on our order. The total for two drinks and the discount was about $10. I suppose this isn't our #1 spot for boba, but it will do for now until we find the best one in Vegas!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,2,3,3,1kMvl3GJJh7ud6nj8Fpriw

Pinenuts Milk Tea: pinenuts were not really my thing, but the milk tea was great. It's not the traditional Taiwanese milk tea. It's made with either English Breakfast or some other kind of black tea that I couldn't completely identify, not with red tea. So if you're expecting red tea, don't. 

Today, I went in to try some other drinks and their food. I got their house special. It's the 6th page in their menu. You can choose from Juicy Steak, Chicken Steak Cutlet, Fish Fillet Steak, or Sizzling Noodle. All of them come on a sizzling platter, which has a cool feeling when it comes out of the kitchen to your table in this chic ambience, light gray-blue walls, with glass art, print art, and tea sets decorating different cities' names in their bar area. 

In Chinese, it says you can choose either mushroom sauce or black pepper sauce on the right side, next to the prices of House Special. This is for you non-Chinese reading people. Below that, you see ""Soup/Sala/French Fries/Toast"" and ""Sala"" is NOT a typo. That's what it says. I'm sure you can figure out what word that is. Anyway, I chose the

Chicken Steak Cutlet with Mushroom Sauce: Chicken was so tender, mushroom sauce was an on-the-sweeter-side tomato sauce with canned mushrooms, and the pasta that came on top swirled into the sauce was al dente. It was a great meal for a cheap price.

Salad: iceberg, came with a package of ranch on the side

Fries: one of the BEST order of fries I have ever had, so crispy and came with a garlic sauce

They're also having a promotion right now until the 7th. If you check in on Facebook, you receive 50% off. I did that yesterday and today. :) Yummy food at half off... service is the typical Chinatown service you would get at most places, so I can't complain too much there. They try to take things away a little earlier than you'd like, but that's the eager beaver in them, right? 

I would say their drinks are a bit better than Miss, definitely five stars. Their ambience is five stars. Their food is not bad. 4.5... overall. I will be back, even after their sale.",qb-8RrNbVj-3WkXYuxpi3w,7,7,5,q8W2dAvqEhC6Cx-xImul2A

1. This place is open until 2 AM. A group of friends and I came in for some sweet goodness at 11 PM. They tell us they're out of boba. What? How can a boba shop be out of boba? It's like going to an Italian restaurant and saying that they're out of pasta or going to a nail salon and saying they're out of polish. They didn't offer to make anymore boba balls which confused me because there were other customers walking in while we were there. 

2. So this place offers different sweetness levels on their drinks. Unsweetened, lightly sweetened, regularly sweetened or super sweetened. We were excited to learn about this since we're trying to watch our figures and limit sugar intake. All drinks were ordered as ""lightly sweetened"" and all but one drink came out regular or super sweet. What happened here?

3. Customer service is terrible. TERRIBLE with all caps. The girl that was serving us had a real nasty attitude and was real pushy with our orders. I wonder if she ate all the boba before we showed up and had a bad stomach ache or something because girlfriend was cranky. My boyfriend and his family came in and I asked our server to put their drinks on my check. She shot me a dirty looked and looked absolutely confused. All I wanted to do was pay for their drinks. Hmm. Ultimately, she got things figured out but I had to go over mountains and cross oceans to do so.

This joint has a really good flavored lavender boba tea.  I hate to demote the other boba place at the opposite end of this strip mall... but Icy Juicy has definitely better flavored lavender boba.

Plus, they have decent priced rice plates served in bento boxes.  They're open late.  Your order is delivered to your table in an average time frame.  

Just make sure when you request a to go box, have them figure out the container size.  For them to ask small or large without seeing the box doesn't make sense.  For them to look at your leftovers and determine the box size makes better sense.

I ordered the large peach green tea with boba which came out to be $5.00 flat (excluding tax).

You can never go wrong with peach green tea, and I was right! The drink wasn't too sweet or too bland. Although the mint green tea wasn't as good as Le Arbre's, it was still tasty.

They have a pretty large selection of drinks, with plenty of toppings to choose from. I like their hot milk teas during the colder seasons. Their coconut mango is also really good. Food is also pretty good and the portions are generous. The crispy chicken basket is a good snack to share with friends, and their rice and noodle combos are very generous; I'm always stuffed after one of them. Their sizzling noodle platter is OK, not for everyone.

They're also open late, and their location is very convenient. Its always a good place to start your day or end your night with friends.

Now for the service. Service has always been inconsistent here, ranging from attentive and polite to frustrating and exasperating. I think it largely depends on who is working there when you go. It is also owned by Chinese folks, and a large portion of their customers are Chinese, so communication may be rough if you don't speak Cantonese or Mandarin. They are usually pretty quick to seat you and take your order, but I find that trying to get the check sometimes can be a hassle. For some reason they are almost ALWAYS facing the other way when I'm trying to grab the check. Its a pretty laid back atmosphere so sometimes the waitresses are chatting but they have a tendency to not check up on you usually. I also believe there is a minimum for credit card, which is $15 I believe.

All in all a good place to hang out with friends, grab a bite to eat, or to study for a bit, but some may find the service an aversion.",ipCYKKlk1hVjKykB7uxaow,0,0,3,Yl6YdgYZfhhp1e-F_xoo0A

Their boba is always at the right consistency. Its soft and chewy and the right amount of texture that I like. They're always very generous on the amount of boba in your tea too. 

I can say that the quality of the milk tea isn't very consistent though. Whenever the boss is there i'm always in an extremely good mood. Only because I know when i ask for my milk tea it will be one of the best I can find in town. 

Whenever the owner isn't there, the drinks often get iffy. They're not as good and I get disappointed sometimes. But the boba is always consistently good, no complaints there. The boss def remembers me because I used to always go to tea station when it was Tea Planet as a 14 year old.

Honestly, my two cents about the service, i'm not here for their service because when i'm at a boba shop, i'm usually with friends and want a quiet time with them. I don't want to be bothered while i'm having a conversation or simply playing card games. So yes, if you're there for the service, its not great.

Learned about it years ago, never tried it, and finally gave in. Upon entering, my posse and I trudged face first into an iron curtain of stench. I'm talking about a smell so bad that it was difficult to describe... but I'll give it a shot. Imagine wet dog fur set on fire. With that in mind we swiftly ordered our boba drinks (mine was strawberry-kiwi) and high tailed it out of there. After regaining our senses of smell we each partook in the frozen slush delicacy and were quite impressed. I was a tad reluctant to intake the solid tapioca(?) balls whilst taking in a liquid, but learned to find a nice equilibrium and balance out what I was getting out of my straw.

Aside from that god awful smell and for around $6.00 this was not a bad sweet treat and I would highly recommend it. It also helped that I didn't have to pay for mine... Thanks Chad S.!",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,2,0,2,17JOGgVAS-j-Ho9HrT2-mg

3839350,2015-08-29,7,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"I always find myself wanting boba at weird hours of the night. Usually, it's because I have so many things to do during the day, that it's hard to stop by a boba place since the good ones are mostly all in Chinatown... Anyway, Icy Juicy is one of those late night boba places that offers a wide selection of different flavored drinks and food. I came here with a friend after having a long day, and both of us were craving boba. 

They have a few tables inside if you plan on sitting down to enjoy your snacks and drinks, as well as limited seating outside. It can get crowded, especially at night because of the other establishments around it that are open late as well (karaoke joints, bars, etc.) 

We looked at the menu after being sat, and decided to get appetizers with our drinks. We ordered their garlic mussels (comes with 6 pieces) and crispy chicken for our snacks. For drinks, I ordered the peppermint milk green tea and the banana milk tea all with boba because I couldn't decide between the two (I hate being indecisive sometimes lol). 

It was a surprise to me that they offered mussels as a snack option here. I thought ""why not?"" and was actually glad I ordered them. These mussels tasted so good and they practically melted in your mouth. The garlic on top didn't overpower the actual taste of the mussels, so they're great in my book!

The crispy chicken is their take on Taiwanese popcorn chicken, which is normally what I would order as an appetizer when enjoying some boba. These bite-sized pieces tasted so good, they're actually quite addicting. They're like potato chips -- you can't eat just one!

The drinks, however, were not as good.

The peppermint milk green tea had the initial taste of mouthwash. While shocking to your tastebuds at first, the taste mellowed out and didn't taste as mouthwash-y. This drink has a very strong mint flavor for sure. 

The banana milk tea tasted like bananas, but it was a little subtle. I didn't really like this one because it ended up having a weird after taste and the color of the milk tea was not appealing whatsoever. 

I didn't completely finish either of them, but at least the boba in these drinks were perfect and not hard or mushy at all!

I think the food is better than the drinks here, but that's just me. It's a great place to go to for your late night boba cravings, but I don't know if I'll go out of my way to get boba from here again. With good food and okay drinks, this place is just average.",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,8,8,3,ndvgDBortTPWv9N5-mzVqw

There were two other customers when I walked in, one was already seated with his food. All I wanted was a drink, so I walked right up to the cashier to order. It took 3 people to ring up my order, apparently there was some confusion on how to properly charge me for boba in my honeydew milk tea. Or maybe there was a language barrier. I don't know, but the ordering process certainly could have been smoother. 

Total came to $5.68. The waitress didn't say anything to me after I paid... so I stood there for a few minutes, feeling awkward and in the way. After a couple minutes I decided to sit down, wondering what the deal was.

A full ten minutes later my drink was ready. It tasted gritty, likely due to the instant creamer used. The cup had a normal lid, not the fancy seal I have come to expect from boba tea shops. 

Overall, I am pretty unimpressed. There are just far too many places in the area where I can get better tasting drinks at the same price or less, with better service then I received at Icy Juicy. On to the next one...",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,3,0,2,X_2EPNg7SZwBD-2Gat1hiA

I've had this place bookmarked for one reason...BOBA!!!  I just wasn't going to drive out of my way to get it.

One issue though, everything that looked really good had fruit in it and I can't eat fruit.  So, plan B (i.e. Plan Boba) was in effect.  

We were too lazy to use the crosswalk or get in our cars, so we played a little Frogger by jaywalking and dodging a few cars.  We got to Icy Juicy in one piece.  Even better, I'm considering this my cardio for the night.  

Icy Juicy is a small restaurant that serves a plethora of treats from snow ice, boba, yogurts and a bunch of fruit creations that is best described through pictures.  Everything looked and sounded good.  I opted for the Cappuccino Slush w/Double Boba. My drink was delicious and cold like it's suppose to be.  My favorite part was the warm boba with each slurp.  

Looking forward to taking the family here when they're in town.  Next time I'm here, I'm trying their Monster Toast minus the fruits.

So a few months ago, my friends and I went to Icy Juicy. It wasn't our first time as I've tried this place a few times before our last unfortunate visit in May. The service is just fine and the food was pretty good. I've especially enjoyed the popcorn chicken and milk teas with boba... and then while my friend was pleasantly sucking up the tapioca pearls in her boba, she happened to see legs protruding out of out of the black pearls. Looking closer and separating that ""interesting"" piece of boba, we came to a realization that it was a COCKROACH. 

My friend went back to the counter to ask for a refund, and they did refund her, which was nice. A few of us also expressed our desire to also get refunds (which they denied, because they reasoned we drank most of our drink anyway), and as I'm sure her boba came from the same container as ours did and I don't want to drink something where I know there was a way for cockroaches to sneak in the tapioca pearl container. Cockroaches are attracted to sugar water, which is what they probably soak the tapioca pearls in to make it sweet. 

Now I wish we had taken a picture and sent it to the health department, but we didn't think about it at the time. I originally wasn't going to post this, but I think that everyone has a RIGHT TO KNOW about our experience there.

Shaved ice: a bit different..Had Taro flavored shaved ice, with fresh fruits and mochi bites.  The serving was a bit smaller ...two people could share but that's stretching it a bit.  Lots of fruits and mochi.  It was pretty refreshing.  

I also had their chicken wings...it could have been better as it was a little on the salty side.  I couldn't finish it.  The skin was not consistent...it was crunchy in some places...and burnt in others...The bf ended up eating it all so none went to waste. :)

4814660,2012-10-20,0,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"Came here just for the Juicy Steak (taiwanese style) ! Been looking in Las Vegas for another place that had Taiwanese-style pepper steak and finally found one! Saw on the newspaper awhile back about it, but never came until today.

The Taiwanese-style pepper steak is 12.95 that comes with a soup, salad, and in the dish itself an egg and noodles as well. There are two options of whether you want the mushroom sauce or the black pepper sauce. I opted for the black pepper sauce. The server also ask the type of sauce and degree of wellness on the steak.

The dish comes out on a hot plate making it sizzle and the aroma spreading in the air quickly. The portion is really filling, I even took half of it home with me. I loved the black pepper sauce! I have had various black pepper sauces from California to Las Vegas,  and this was one definitely in my top 5 better tasting black pepper sauces. May wonder what may be difference since it is black pepper, but the technique can either make it turn super spicy, mild, or no flavor/bland. In this case it was just right. A mild black pepper sauce. The steak was cooked correctly as I had ordered it. 

Since it is a boba place, must get a drink! I ordered the large tapioca milk tea and they give a lot of boba in your drink for its worth! They have honey boba which makes it have a nice after taste in your mouth. The texture was a little chewier than what I prefer, but it is more of a preference thing. The portion is decent and worth the money of 4 dollars.

Also tried the snow ice here! The snow ice came in a heart-shaped bowl that was decorated with mango, kiwi, and strawberries making it quite appealing to the eye. The snow ice had a nice mango taste to it.

The place is small, but good enough for a boba place. There is Chinese music playing in the background and it is a good place to hang out and chill with friends.

4848176,2012-06-07,1,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"IMO, I think this place has the best shaved ice in Vegas, and here is why:

- Shave ice at this place comes in 4 flavors: green tea, condensed milk, mango, and either taro or red bean (not sure about the last flavor).
- Unlike most other places I tried, I think this place mixed the flavor into the water before freezing it. Thus when they shave the ice, the flavor is already evenly distributed into the shaved ice. I think this is also what give the shaved ice nice silky texture.
- They are very generous with fruit topping. I recommend go with the mango and stay away from the red bean. The sweetness of red bean make the whole thing too sweet.

Now here why I give the place on three stars instead of five: Except the rose tea boba, I think their other boba drinks are just average. Their shaved ice is also a little more expensive than other place and they don't have the lid for the shaved ice cup if you need it to go.",Xr63tSoQeUWpgdzSIQnFYA,2,0,3,lioMHbFcYktrAk05-3G5_Q

They have a lot of items on their menu (Japanese, Taiwanese and Korean) that seemed interesting but I was already full so all I could afford to ingest was a green tea milk tea with boba.  It was good though they coul've put more ice in it.

My cousin raves about this place - I'm just not sure if it's because of the high school girls that come here or he really likes the food and boba tea!  They have honey toast just like the ones I've had in Tokyo...with fruits, chocolate syrup and whipped cream - they beat Ichiza in that aspect.

5320620,2012-07-18,1,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"I practically live at the pool hall next door therefore I've seen this place transition everyday from when it was called Quickly's until they remodeled it into Icy Juicy. I admit, the only reason why I went here in the beginning was because it was conveniently located right next to where I always hang out, but over time, I found myself constantly coming back for more.

To sum it up, Icy Juicy's drinks are comparable to the ever so popular Tea Station[Planet].  The drinks are delicious, atmosphere very relaxed, perfect for big group meet ups. However,  keep in mind for those who are not used to going to these types of Asian owned establishments in the China Town area...it is extremely Asian! (Chinese waiters, Chinese music, Chinese writing on menus and mostly Chinese/Asian regulars). If you're expecting diversity, not a cultural experience, then go elsewhere. 

Icy Juicy serves not only milk teas (approx. $3-$5), but also has the typical snow ice/shaved ice (approx. $5-$6), slushies (approx. $5), and flavored teas (approx.$4-$5).  All of their milk teas are very flavorful, dark yet equally milky. My favorite to order of all time is their royal milk tea (has a ginger taste to it), milk tea (rich and heavy with the perfect combo of creme), and their green milk tea (a light  refreshing drink, more tea than creme). Their boba is also very good, always soft and because of their popularity, always made regularly and fresh. If you're not a fan of boba, try their lychee/ coffee jelly instead. It is guaranteed to renew your taste buds. 
They also have finger snacks such as spicy chicken (approx.. $5), and a variety of other fried finger foods coming in at second best (approx. $4-$6), and entrees coming in last (approx. $8-$12). My favorite snack of all time is their spicy chicken, and their crispy squid. Both are very deliciously, and have flavorful batter that tastes like garlic and chili spices, rather than just meat dipped in flour that was deep fried. If you're here to drink tea and eat snacks, it's a perfect combination. But if you're here expecting to get a quality meal, my suggestion is to save your money and go eat elsewhere, then come for drinks/ desserts afterwards. They claim to have ""Taiwanese"" food, yet a lot of it is not authentic and poorly executed. If you have to eat there, my suggestion is to try the pork chop rice ($8---2 large pieces of pork chop, eggs & cabbage, ground pork, rice), and their specialty sizzling noodle ($12). Those are the only 2 that I think is worth it. IMO, their soups are the worse (flavorless and taste like water). 

So if I have many good things to say about this place, why did I give it only 3 stars? Don't get me wrong, their drinks are delicious, and when it comes down to a boba shop, taste is really all that matters. However, the main reason why this place was set back a star on my list is because of it's often lacking service. To be fair, there are certain waitresses here (all Asian and most cannot speak English fluently) are very sweet.. yet there are a few who work during the late night shifts that I hate to deal with whenever I come in. They are 2 girls in particular who are very inattentive, distant and seem almost unwilling to help just because I do not speak Chinese to make it easier for them. On top of that, when this place gets busy and I mean they often get full house/ full lobby during late nights and weekend, it's often very hard to get any service, especially if you are not part of a big group they  trying to serve first. This place could use more staff in my opinion and tables (even though I don't think that's possible just  because it's not a very big place.. they would have to do some major reconstruction)..Overall, aside from those minor flaws,  I definitely recommend Icy Juicy for anyone interested in making pit stops and trying out the Asian boba culture for the first time.

I had some time to kill after getting my haircut and before I had to pick up my sister. Vetoing the gym for a day of relaxation, little did I know I would fall so far off the bandwagon. I started by ordering a large Grapefruit Green Tea with Aloe Vera ($5.00) thinking it would be a 24oz serving, but it came out in a mug that puts Hofbrauhaus to shame. The tea is bold and not bitter at all. The grapefruit flavor is light and not too sweet. The aloe vera were large chunks and came in a generous portion. Then the next step was where I went horribly wrong. I ordered a Rose Yogurt ($3.75). Little did I know it was another drink. I thought it was going to be frozen yogurt since the bottom of the page were lined with pictures of this creamy treat. When the employees asked me if I wanted to wait for it, I was a little thrown off, but it should have been a clue. The Rose Yogurt reminded me of those little bottles of yogurt drink  I use to get from the Asian supermarkets. It was ok. I would totally stick to the teas. 

The best part, my folly was not that bad since they are running a special. Until December 7th, tomorrow, they are doing half off drinks if you check in on Facebook and like them. So both of my drinks came out to be five dollars and some change. 

The staff is nice, but there is a language barrier. I don't speak Chinese, but the barista kept talking to me in Chinese. The waitress roughly translated, so I got the gist of it.

Parking is extremely tight. I have no idea what greedy developer / landlord thought they'd have a zillion full-sized restaurants and multiple karaoke bars in 1 strip mall and have only a handful of parking spots per business. 

Apart from the parking, the main issue at this place is that it's starting to smell. Please, shampoo the couches. They smell so bad (the place hasn't changed at all in the past 5 years I've gone here.) We actually took out of town guests here for some after dinner drinks and the smell of the seating was so bad it was embarrassing. Upholstery needs cleaned!

Okay so you're probably wondering about the foods - stick to high turn over items. Fried foods and drinks are high turn over items while soup... Not so much. I've had wonton soup here that was inedible as it tasted a bit rancid. 

My husband likes coming here because he says the seasoning on the popcorn chicken tastes like it does back in Taiwan, where his family is from. The drinks are powdered, but they're also not full off ice and a fair price. 

Something that I like is that I've noticed that this cafe is upfront about pre-sweetened powdered drinks. Unlike other cafes which say they'll accommodate an order of ""no sweetener/ no sugar / unsweetened"" only for me to take a sip and taste sugar, the waitress will let you know if unsweetened drinks are an option for that particular drink, if you ask. Others seem to erroneously believe that not adding in simple syrup to pre-sweetened drink powders means that they've accommodated your request for an unsweetened drink.

If you don't want fried foods, the bento boxes here are a good deal for a quick meal and I was pleasantly surprised at how good their tea eggs, tomato and egg and curry chicken is. I would highly recommend it!

I can't give 4 stars to a place that has served me something has tasted rancid, ever, but I hope that that doesn't happen to anyone ever again. I'd also like them to clean their upholstery. Other than that, I've been here enough times to know that this is a solid 3 star place that I'll still go back to because of their hours, prices and chicken.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,8,5,3,hn01g09yp-5FgybQ33TY7A

It's different from the shaved ice I've had in Cali (Class 302, for example). It's sticky and the Cali ones aren't like this. Either way, this is probably the best you'll get in Vegas. The shaved ice in Cali are amazing. But this is snow ice so I'm not sure if that difference matters.. yet. 

The 3 dishes I've managed to get here (deep fried squid, Taiwanese sausage, and fried tempura) are all pretty good. I'm surprised. I was also really cold on my second visit and decided to get this hot drink - coconut milk tea (I usually get the cold version) and it was VERY yummy. I love it. Coconut isn't most people's thing so get the flavor you want. But I loved it. It was so yummy. I'll definitely be getting it again and again. If you get drinks a lot here, get a stamp card. The prices add up.

The service has been friendly. It's easy to call them over - just let them know you need something. It's probably cause they're a new place so their service isn't crappy (at least none that I've had). I'm going to end up trying all the food on the menu. They've also got different flavors of toast! If it's your thing, give it a try.

Definitely give this place a chance. There's some grand opening specials right now. One of them is a 10% off to-go drinks. There is also a $15 credit card limit. Bring cash.",7weuSPSSqYLUFga6IYP4pg,4,1,4,oTy_HFNkbifprF-urvOz8A

5775058,2015-07-24,0,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"I come here a lot just for their super mango snow ice. It's the best snow ice I've had in Vegas so far. The heart bowl that they serve the snow ice in is so cute!!! I'm a sucker for anything pretty and cute! 

I decided to try one of their food items. I got the Japanese eel & rice (unagi) and it was ok. I would give it a 5/10. The side dishes were cabbage that was drowning in oil (gross), egg and tomatoes, and a hard boiled egg that was overly hard. Now let's move on to the unagi. The eel itself was tough and dry. It was lacking flavor & it was it was more on the fatty side. They give a small amount of the eel and it was laid on top of a salad with no dressing (bummer, I love salad :( ) 

Overall, I recommend this place only for their desserts. Especially their snow ice! Its literally so soft and fluffy and melts in your mouth!!! I also love this place because it's open late!!! You can't go wrong with late night food joints!",RxZ3zWKqSBUHmBKdDAloiw,1,0,3,xZRBuLLK8lDCSIQc2__2Tg
5778476,2012-09-18,0,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"I went here a couple months back and I've got to say they really need to improve their customer service.

Me and my boyfriend wanted to grab a quick bite before heading out with our friends. I really was craving some shaved iced so Icy Juicy it was. Upon entering the restaurant, there wasn't enough tables. We stood waiting for about 10 minutes or so and when we finally got seated they didn't have enough menus. The waitress told us we would have to wait since a bigger party came in and took all the menus. After the huge party was done ordering, the waitress gathered the menus and didn't even remember to give us one. I had to remind her! Afterwards, we placed our order. We waited what seemed like 20-30 minutes. When we finally got our order (we ordered an actual dish as well), the waitress and waiter were confused. They couldn't remember WHO ordered that dish. I watched across the restaurant as the waiter questioned the waitress. I waited about 3 minutes to finally confirm that the mystery-ordered dish was mine and my boyfriend's. 

Overall the wait for this place is horrible! They really need someone who speaks English.",VhkjxxBz-A4M-mMncpn1ZA,0,0,2,jlW1C41cnuRZC1v-rjddXw

I got the Mango slush with boba the mango was delish however I do think they added to extra (some kind of sweetner) so it made both drinks extremely sweet.  So I have definitey had better but it's not a bad place.

Then while I'm there I see that they are open until 2am. SCORE!!!!!! I always want my drink after 10pm and I used to have to buy it early in the day and try to keep it cold without ruining the boba. Now I didn't need to. The drink wasn't all that great but boy did they get it just right about a year later. Now let me tell you how much I love this place before I drop the stars from 5 to 1. I love them so much that one night I ordered my tea and when I got there it was white like just cream and boba. I said where is the tea I wanted almond milk tea not almond milk. They seriously tried so hard to convince me it was tea but I knew better and I see the guy putting the tea pots away obviously they ran out by the time I got there. That's all they had to say. Guess what? They still charged me and I said screw it I'll make my own tea and add it to the boba. I actually paid Full price and didn't complain. That's how much I love this place. Now why am I dropping my stars? Because after almost 4 years and being a regular there, to my surprise I drive all the way down there at about 12 to get my drink. Get pulled over in the way there already pissed and see that they are closed on a Wednesday night. I said hmmmmmm something must have happened. I went home craving my drink :( so I go there the next day at about 9-10 or so and I said hey you were closed for the first time ever is everything ok? Oh yeah it's fine we close early during he week. I said since when I've come here for years after 10 pm. He said oh yeah only on weekends now. But let me say this is why I dropped my stars.....hello some kind of warning or sign or something....anything. The last time I was there they could have said something knowing how late I come and how far I drive to get there. This is absolutely the one and only reason they get a single star. How are you gonna change your hours after so long of being open til 2am. That's not thinking like a business owner. What about your late night customers?? I could understand if you got  jacked or something but damn a notice would have been nice so thanks a lot for no heads up I will be taking my business elsewhere I have no choice. I would never do that to my customers. Just plain rude!!!!!!",RF_I0QSMNnlHFr3vozV9sA,0,0,2,6rkTJggmlW_GP0_35rADgg

Papaya coconut milk: Fresh/frozen papaya which is nice instead of the syrup. It tasted quite good, though the papaya taste was a bit faint. Good idea though.

Milk tea: Normal, but it was actually quite delicious. Your average, light, milk tea.

Green tea no sugar with pudding and grass jelly: Green tea was normal green tea...no floral scents/jasmine in it. It was pretty average and nothing special. Grass jelly didn't have much flavor, but my real complaint was the PUDDING. I honestly felt like they mixed up the sugar with CHALK. The consistency was chalky/gritty and it was barely sweet! It also was even a bit SALTY! It was so bad that I had to ask them to make me another drink without the pudding! DO NOT GET THE PUDDING.

Anyway, overall I'd still rather go to tea station. The tea is much better and so are the toppings.",0uEqdNTVj-I7zM83bbcgsg,0,0,2,SKh21r9tUJK_1VuAfWPVwA

The only thing I really eat here is the crispy chicken.  It's a good portion, enough to share with 4 people or if you are sitting a chatting it can probably feed more. It's very tasty and this is the only place that you can get it. It's definitely something to try.

On my last visit here I ordered the lavender milk tea hot and my boyfriend ordered the iced royal milk tea.  The royal milk tea tasted good, so lucky for my boyfriend ! As for me, my lavender milk tea lacked any lavender flavor. Although lavender is a very mild flavor, it is highly distinguishable. Sadly, I did not taste it in there. On the upside, the appetizer baskets were cute and the mug with the ladle was even cuter.

I give the service two stars.  There was too many misunderstandings with our orders and we were not too difficult.  The waitress never ever checked up on us again. We were waiting for our check for a long time. 

I'll be back again mostly because of the location,  but hopefully the drinks taste like they're suppose to and the servers give better service next time.",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,6,3,3,Iq_050FISpb2v2tCmdlLmQ
5987079,2013-05-29,0,YU2XR_ZY-g2VzDpi7KMzEw,"WARNING THIS REVIEW IS GOING TO BE BRUTALLY HONEST: but if you ask me this world needs more truth. I once wrote a good review for this place but my last experience was so not enjoyable and I left pissed off that I wish I could give 0 stars. I just read someone else's review saying they give 10% off discount for people who show them there yelp account. I wish I knew that before hand. Either way, I think they should treat ever customer like they matter, or like they are important, customer service is a very big thing in my opinion, when I worked for my mothers restaurant in Austin TX. I treated every customer like they where important, and was always professional even when a customer got pissed off and cursed @ me, I always kept cool and stayed professional cause thats what your suppose to do. I think sometimes the customers got even more mad (the ones who where cursing) cause they couldn't piss me off, but in all reality cursing @ the one who is trying to help you is not going to fix the problem, say if a order was wrong, or late, cursing @ the customer is not going to fix anything, N I thought if I stayed cool maybe they could cool down so we could fix the problem, get a discount, next order free etc. Anyway, I went the Icy Juicy to meet up with my webmaster, cause I was coming out with my personal website for my modeling/acting business, and was trying to find a credit card server for my website.  I did not get anything done this meeting with my webmaster, why? Cause the music was to loud and I could not hear anything, I asked them to turn the volume down, maybe it was the TV or the music, either way, the volume did not go down, I was on the phone with someone, and could not even really hear what that person I was speaking to on the phone with was saying, I kept plugging my other ear so I could hear them better when I was inside the store, that should have given the hint to the waitress that the volume was still way to loud, but I guess they are stupid and cant figure it out. I will never come back here, especially not for business. Maybe come here if your not doing anything important to you, or if your not trying to read something important, I don't see why places like this have internet if they are going to have the music/TV so loud you can not focus on whatever your doing. If you ask me music should be low and pleasant in the back ground, not pounding loud & annoying in your ears. I felt like my head was pounding off, and the waitress not turning it down even tho I requested that pissed me off even more. This may have been my last meeting with my webmaster for a while now, cause I am moving to LA June 1st, and today is May 29th now, I went in there May 28th. N MY webmaster comes to La every month but it still may be a month before my next meeting with my webmaster. The only reason I left a tip was cause the webmaster I was with wanted to leave a tip but if it was up to me, I would not have left a tip. The waitress told me good bye when I walked out the door, but I was going to walk out the door and not say anything to them, to let them know I was pissed. N trust me when I say I was not just a little pissed. I was totally pissed off. 101% or more. They do have big drinks there but I didn't come there for the drinks, I came there to do business and I got nothing done, cause I couldn't read and focus, or soak in what I was reading or what the person I was speaking on the phone to was saying. N it was hard to pay attention to what the webmaster was saying with all that loudness going on. Goodbye Icy Juice I will not miss your loud music, or your bad customer service ignoring my request when I asked you to turn the volume down. I'm a business minded person and almost never come out unless it's for business, n since I could not do business here there is no reason for me to come back. I don't know if anyone else has felt this way before but it's not the 1st time I have felt this way. It was one of those moments where I thought to myself OMG do I have to spend the rest of my life with these inconsiderate stupid asshole humans?

Compared to the newer boba spots in Vegas though, this place probably isn't amongst the highest in ranks. 

Atmosphere is a bit lackluster. There is no energy in the cafe. There are several tables here and free WiFi. They also provide cards and some board games. Most of the time I asked for playing cards, the deck did not equal 82 cards.... but I ended up using it anyway! Not sure what board games are available though.

If you haven't been here before, you aren't missing much. There are other places in the Valley that offer good quality boba tea and also have a nice atmosphere in the cafe. It is open late though, until 2AM, so if you have a late night boba craving, this is would be the place to go to!",lqrfzgZUKl0dXt6HAim2kQ,0,0,3,5wJlU_2oH5gdCboVquxykg
