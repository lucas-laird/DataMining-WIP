The wings were great but could have done with maybe 6. 

The pork belly was fantastic. Deviled eggs were tasty and a $.50 a pop they were good value.

The duck pizza was tasty too.

There are one or two kinks but this place has only been open a couple of weeks. Will definitely be back.

The service was extremely friendly on both occasions.

The booths for NFL Sunday will be great.

Although there is not a no smoking area I didn't find the bar smokey. We had our daughter with us so would have bailed if it was smokey and it wasn't at all.

I am not sure where all the negativity is coming from but what I will say is, the lovers of the Outside Inn were obviously not going enough because it went out of business right?",9sWSDP0lL8DEXcCPK3HFeQ,1,0,5,VSWDiSXgwZUSMwbkY68XVQ

But just getting a drink with some cheap food..not so much....
Thanks for the reply scooter. I think you have to best most friendly bartenders in Vegas and I don't think the food is bad at all it's all very good. The beer selection is awesome I've tried many food items and all were good. I still bring friends here because your bar is looks amazing and has I very local feel. Instead of selling shitty food for super cheap you sell really good food for a little bit more.

I do. c'mon yelp. I was there. not impressed. menu is way too ambitious for a sports bar. some people may like that. I don't. overpriced and off the wall menu. maybe that's why they won't post it on their website. owners need to make up their minds. do they want to be a neighborhood sports bar like they claim, or do they want to be an upscale, overpriced, overrated bistro gastro pub in a neighborhood location. if I want to get ripped off I can go to the strip. i'm looking for a true neighborhood pub. hope they go in that direction.",-ELBgtqnuDHoARN3g1n8hQ,3,1,2,N5HSXId_RLAp8Y-0TJOfug

The chef is supposedly from Bouchon in the Venetian but it doesn't show. Gnocchi was gummy and bland. The garlic shrimp were muddy, over cooked on the outside and partially raw on the inside. The pig ears were a step away from jerky treats from petsmart and the manager staff was drinking at the bar during service hours. The chef has a big head and needs to be knocked down a bit or replaced. Gotta say tho, the pork rinds were the best thing we had...beside the beer. The beer Mac and cheese wasn't bad either. This place still needs a lot of work and prices need to be kicked down. I recommend eating somewhere else before coming here to catch the game. Unless the kitchen gets their stuff together and realize that this place is a sports bar in a residential area...it's not going to last 4 months. Not to mention there are only two girls behind the bar that actually give a damn, the rest are useless. The pregnant blonde and the tall skinny brunette are awesome though.

It was dry and lacking flavor other than salt and a heaping mass of goat cheese to mask their poor excuse of a fancy gourmet salad. The bartender and waitress although friendly were unattentive.

There are two rows of big tvs that go around the bar, unfortunately if you're sitting at the bar you have to strain your neck to see the top row of tvs. They should have angled the top row down so you can actually view them.

It's my neighborhood bar and I wanted so badly to love everything about this place, but sadly that wasn't the case. To start the service was awful! Ashley was our ""bartender"" and she seemed to be way too occupied with her conversations with other guests to make my requests a priority. I would ask for some napkins, and she would literally take 5 minutes to bring me back paper napkins. I would be chewing on the ice of my empty drink and she would ask ""refill"" and I would kindly say ""yes"". She would then go finish her conversation with another group before taking the 20 seconds to fill my drink. 

Next up on the list was the food. I ordered green chili pork nachos. The entire top layer of the nachos were cold and the bottom were steaming hot. That concerned me considering it was PORK. It had so much flavor, but just couldn't get over it being cold and I refuse to send items back. 

My final issue, and honestly the most bothersome part of this place (and the reason I probably won't be back), is the fact they don't comp food for slot players. Excuse me? Bars main source of revenue is from gaming!!!! How do you get gaming customers??? COMP MEALS!!!! There are hundreds of bars in this town offering FREE meals to slot players. If you expect me to be loyal to your bar, I expect a free meal when I feed the machine hundreds. Very poor decision by ownership/management. 

I do want to shout out Neil. After our meal and after I lost $500 in the machine, I played some darts. Neil was quick to bring us drinks and very personable.

It's a lot of fun with a limited but very good food menu, unique draft line for those down to try new things and a very clean bar!

Only downside I have is that the tvs are position really awkwardly and if your sitting on any end of the bar you will be forgotten about. Bartenders don't tend to walk that far and service is a complete lag. 

Besides that, I would definitely come back to grub and have a beer after a hard day at work, but I'll pass when it comes to football. It just doesn't quite have it down yet.",aat7AAw1PVLaM2AhHd9MAQ,1,0,3,zp-4YEi0o_mBytE4KDtumA

But Sporting Life surpasses a lot of expectations. We were able to find a table easily, and the staff were welcoming and friendly, food was on par with a gastropub and prices were on par with the quality.

DEVILED EGGS: Simple but delicious, at an old-school price of fifty cents each!
PRETZEL BITES WTIH CHEESE ($5 game day deal): tasty pretzels, soft and not too salty, with a tasty cheese sauce. First order, the cheese was too thin (like water), table later purchased an additional order and the cheese was the right consistency.
MARINATED SKIRT STEAK ($10): great char and flavor, cooked just right and only a touch tough, served over some crazy-tasty potatoes
GERMAN BRAT & FRIES ($5 Game Day Deal): such crispy fries! Snagged a few of my friend's before just ordering a plate of my own. Sausage wasn't quite as flavorful as back home (nor was the 'kraut), but both were solid on their own. The mustard it's served with is wicked good though, ask for extra!
SHORTRIB FLATBREAD ($13): So friggin' good. Almost didn't order a flatbread due to the very mixed reviews, but opted for this one based on the server's recommendation and was blown away by the ample portion of meat, light but great bleu cheese, with accents of onion and mushroom. Would get this again!
WINGS (4 whole, $11): Almost didn't try these (partly due to the price) but my guy has a thing for whole wings. Opted for the hot sauce on the side, which was super spicy and a weird consistency. The wings themselves were perfect as-is: lightly fried, super crispy, just a sprinkle of salt for flavor, some of the best I've had.

Service from servers, food runners, and bartenders was solid throughout the night, and the owner Scooter even came out and introduced himself- he's a 49ers fan, so that automatically made him a new friend.

So I started $100 in a machine and ordered my drink. Lost the $100 and moved to another machine before finishing my first drink then another machine . I had put $100 in 5 machines when I got to the 6th machine I put another $100 and decided to order some food. At this time I took $200 out of the ATM. Here's where it got messed up. At this time I decided to order food the chicken sandwich and wings to go. 
Like I said I don't expect anything but to be treated as a local like every where else. We decide to spend money at certain establishments and spend our hard earned money anywhere and with the amount of local bars we have in Vegas what are local bars gonna offer for me to come back? 
So when I asked how much I owed for the food; the Asian bartender she presented me with a check??? After I had dropped $500 in the machines. So I paid and didn't say anything. Later on when she was off I asked the Asian male who came in at 11p if they comped food for players? He said they did. So I told him I had put $500 into the machines and the $400 I had won into the machines and that she charged me for the food. If anything if I were to ever come back to this establishment it would be cause of him. 
It sad that I WOULD NEVER come back to this establishment especially since it's so close to home. 
Once again by all means am I a whaler but the money I work hard for I would rather give it to another bar. So if you decide to come to this bar to gamble or to be treated as a local, your better off going somewhere else to spend your money.

Fries were dry/unseasoned... asked for ranch dip, bland AF. Probably the crappiest fries I've had ever.

Beer battered mushrooms... 90% batter and oil. Gross.
Biggest pet peeve: when they give you the check, and then disappear for 10 minutes and all you're trying to do is GTFO, so you have to track them down to pay. Hate that so much, and of course it happened here.

Chicken sandwich was good and warmed spinach salad was good. Pork belly was good, but the polenta underneath was meh. Definitely not enough for me to go back. Will take my money elsewhere. UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.",i2MEQsuOpDa-PHr2owinig,1,0,2,k3ZujYAPJp3XgVwcpCzHeg

Food: The pork belly over pilenta was surprisingly delicious but portion was a bit small for a ~$10 dish. The $5 bites are a good deal but a bit bland. Will come mostly for the drinks!",OCZAp9xpuIzX8VKvpS-Zvg,0,0,4,jbLxew4F3CfHr8KEQzLVfA

Wings are the best wings I've ever had in this city. We got all the different styles of sauces on the side and loved them all.  If you're looking for an Asian infused type, then get those for the wings other than that any way you get them, they're tasty and served to perfection.  For entrees we ordered the Portobello Mushroom Sandwich which was huge compared to what I imagined it. Full of flavor and the pesto sauce that comes on it is delicious. We also got the chicken sandwich and that is amazing. It was served with a sunny side up egg and once you bite into it, the yolk pops and gets soaked but by that wonderful homemade brioche bun. Tasty and so yummy. We got French fries and house field greens salad as our sides and got the best homemade French fries, non that you can get anywhere. Plus the house field greens and homemade vinaigrette goes so well with that portobello mushroom sandwich. 

This ain't no typical sports bar and lounge type of food, it's in a caliber like no other. You will never find a place like this here in Vegas. It's clean, great atmosphere, friendly wait staff, great bar and great management team.  I got to meet one of the owners there Scooter and he was absolutely friendly and personable with us as we had dinner.  He checked in and see how things were going and we let him know!! Troy was an awesome server and local boy from Hawaii.  He loves serving his guest and has passion behind that. He definitely shared with us the ""aloha"" spirit.  Thank you gentlemen for making our first visit there a memorable one.  Highly recommend and let me tell you don't listen to those people who are so anal about certain places and try to compare them to others.  It's unique, different and something's people can't take.  Change is great and this place really changes your aspect and outlook on your so called ""sports bar.""

The menu looked great and there were tons of things on there I'm definitely going to try. This isn't your typical bar menu. We had the peanuts and pork rinds dish as well as pork belly with grits. Being from the South I'm pretty picky on my grits and those were spot on. Well done all the way around.

The place is laid out well and clean. It's not that super dark or conversely super bright bar. The atmosphere is great. While it's sports themed, there aren't six thousand different sports posters all over the walls. The decorations are tasteful and retro.

2196209,2014-09-16,2,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"i discovered this place when i was online looking for establishments that have steel tip dart boards.  my friends and i have recently become very avid dart enthusiasts.  i somehow stumbled across sporting life bar so one day we decided to check it out.  little did i know that it was located in the same plaza as tonkatsu kyoshi, one of our favorite spots.  i was slightly hesitant at first because of the less-than-enthusiastic ratings on yelp.  but as soon as i walked through their front door, i was immediately impressed.  the place is large and open, airy and clean, and the dart boards are brand new with cork board tiled along the walls and located on an elevated platform with extremely good lighting.  it's difficult to find a place that cares enough to make sure that the darting area is above average.  there's a beautiful reclaimed wooden bar area to place your belongings and/or food and drinks on.  there's also an enormous reclaimed wooden picnic table that can seat a large party which came in handy when we had 20 people there for the hubby's birthday celebration.

now onto the food.  the food is not your typical bar food although there are some bar food items on the menu like nachos and tacos.  as i said, however, their versions are atypical for a bar.  the executive chef hails from bouchon so he puts his special spin on all of their offerings.  i've had many dishes and some of my favorites are the gnocchi (which is potato free, btw), the flowering kale salad, the polenta, the special veggie dish of the day, the tomato bread, the deviled eggs and the nachos.  many of my friends have enjoyed other dishes like the burger, the korean style bbq ribs, the pork belly, and the pig ears and skins.  i've had the bread pudding twice.  it was so delicious the first time.  it was gooey and custardy with the perfect consistency.  then the 2nd time i tried it, it was really dry and disappointing.  i think consistency is important and, for the most part, i find everything to be pretty consistently good.  sure, there are things that need ironing out but, overall, i've been very happy with everything i've had here.  if they could just get that bread pudding to be the same every time, i'll be a very happy camper.

they also offer a lot of fun things at slb.  tuesdays at 7pm is pub quiz night which we've attended a few times now and have had a lot of fun.  wednesdays at 7 and 12, they have dart tournaments.  we've not attended one yet but plan to soon.  they offer happy hour deals but i can't remember what days and/or times at the moment.  now that it's football season, they're even doing food and drink specials during the games.  

although i live a good 20 minutes away, i absolutely love coming here and spending time eating good food, pub quizzing, and throwing darts with friends.  it's our ""cheers"" i suppose.  troy, marie and gemma are always so kind and helpful and never give us a hard time no matter how long we stay there and bug them.  scooter, the owner, is also a pretty awesome dude.  slb is our new goto hangout spot and i'm happy to drive the distance.  but i gotta say, i hope scooter considers opening one on my side of town someday.  =)",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,5,4,4,cJzn9U8qcpi7jqQipXzi6g

2212716,2014-04-20,0,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"I have to give it three stars because while my food was amazing, my girlfriend's food was awful.

The decor of the place is pretty cool and from our vantage point sitting in one of I think 5 booths, I could see at least 7 TVs, all playing different sports channels.  We sat down and the waitress came over and brought us menus and asked what we wanted to drink.  Now even though it was a holiday, Easter, we decided not to be day drinking at 11 am.  So we both got orange juice.

Looking over the menu, the choices are not very extensive, but from viewpoint, as long as the food is good, who cares how many selections they have?  I decided on the French toast which they described as being done bread pudding style.  I didn't know what that meant, but since I know I like bread pudding, it sounded like I would enjoy it.  My girlfriend ordered the breakfast sandwich with sausage.

For being a Sunday morning and we were one of 8 or 9 customers, the food took a little longer than expected.  When it arrived, I was pleased with how mine looked and smelled and after the first bite, I was very impressed.  Definitely try the French toast if you go.

My girlfriend's sandwich and the hash browns that accompanied it were definitely not as appealing.  The bun for the sandwich was either very old, or the toasting process made it stale.  Either way, it was terrible.  The hash browns also were very flat.  And by very, I mean they may have stood 1/2 inch off the plate.

So overall, I'd return, but my girlfriend may not.  Might as well try something new and see how you like it!",pmWrP89IllBRkGf7ZUeCcw,1,1,3,M8E6-B1Goxzr5_7HPahg5Q

Stopped in for lunch for the first time and it was a little different. Not as loud that's for sure and experienced a more chill time. 

Enjoyed a few appetizer plates. Bacon wrapped dates, fried mushrooms and the pork belly. All three were really good but my favorite was the dates. The pork belly was soft and really tasty. 

We were recommended the crepe with nutella and fresh strawberries with whip cream and drizzled with chocolate. Sounds yummy right?! So I was a Lil disappointed when we ordered it and it came out without whip cream and chocolate, the crepe was a Lil dry and kind of didn't taste all the way cooked.

Sporting Life Bar is not a Gastro Pub, it is a non-ashamed Sports Bar with big screens, game-time specials, video gaming and a well-lit area for darts.

Food items that stand out include:
Pork Belly - braised pork belly served over creamy 
Portabello Mushroom Sandwich
Short Rib Philly
Short Rib Flatbread - Their flatbreads are actual flatbreads though, not an oblong shaped pizza that you would get at most places these days.  Expect the thin flatbread to be thin and crispy...in the cracker vein. 

SLB has many standard sports bar items like nachos, burgers and sandwiches as well.  Also try a Deviled Egg for $.50--nothing to come in specifically for, but certainly better than the ones that came to your last potluck. 

Draft selections are not the best around, but are certainly sufficient with Firestone Walker Union Jack IPA, Green Flash Hop Head, Brooklyn Lager, Weihenstephaner Hefe, Deschutes Black Butte Porter, Joseph James Hop Box, and Teneya Creek Nut Brown on the list.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,8,8,4,zX8jXLBUyCUxGRDa_Bc4bQ

2527425,2015-10-16,0,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"Holy shit this place is awesome!  

On a recent trip to Vegas with the boys we wanted to get off the strip and enjoy the sanity of a local sports bar...so we laid down our NFL bets at the sports book, checked my Yelp app and hopped in a cab to enjoy some local flavor.  So glad we did.  We thought we were walking into  just another sports bar, but Sporting Life Bar is more like a high end restaurant with TV's everywhere.  Days later I'm still amazed at the quality of the food at this place.  Never have I been to a sports bar (or any bar really) with food I continue to rave about to all my friends.  We had the wings, nachos with carne asada, beer battered mushrooms, marinated skirt steak small plate and  Reuben's.  We would have kept eating but we were getting drunk and needed to make more bets....yes I said needed...get off my back.  Anyway, wings....holy balls.....they are cured in salt and spices/herbs for a while and then cooked in duck confit for like 6 hours and then fried to order in peanut oil.  They are the whole wing as well...and absolutely fantastic.  Fall off the bone and still tender and juicy, not dried out at all.  The nachos are gourmet...not the chips out of the bag sprinkled with shredded cheddar bullshit you get at most bars...ya know, where you pick up one nacho and the whole pile wants to come with that one chip?  Not here.  Thick tortilla chips are fried to order and a melted cheese mixture (REAL cheese) is poured over the entire order along with any additional toppings and meat you get.  We chose the carne asada and I wouldn't even bother ever getting anything else.  The only reason we didn't order another bowl is because I was so intrigued with other menu items.  Next came the fried mushrooms...they come with  garlic aioli slathered on the plate and a chili sauce sprinkled over top.  Just outstanding....nothing frozen...fresh mushrooms, awesome batter....perfection.  Jesus...I'm running out of words for the skirt steak.  It's so simple, but so delicious.  I have no idea what it's marinated in but I'm pretty sure a shot of whatever the hell it is would instantly make any meal better.  The steak was melt in your mouth delicious and cooked perfectly.  We ended with Reuben's...pastrami cured in hose I'm told by our absolutely fantastic server Denise.  It was everything you could ever want from a reuben....just another thing the Sporting Life is good at....making pastrami.  What really got me on the Reuben was the side dish.   They don't stick you with just the option for fries, we were offered the vegetable of the day or a salad and having stuffed our faces with enough fried food already, I went for the veggie.   What came out with my reuben could have been served at any of the finest steakhouses in town.  Today it was this mushroom and garlic medley in some ridiculously awesome brown sauce.  Again, not sure what it was but I wanted to bathe in it....my god....just bring me a whole bowl of that next time so I can dunk my entire face in it and I'll be satisfied.  

Whew.....been a while since I have been so satisfied with an establishment.  I didn't even mention the real dart boards (truly appreciate this being a darter), the 20 some TV's mounted to this awesome steel frame custom fit to the bar, the 15 video poker machines, the skybox room upstairs or the truly fitting Michigan trash can in the mens bathroom.  Really....that was just the icing on an already satisfied cake.  F michigan....hooray for the sporting Life!  Definitely stopping by again when I'm back out getting my gambling fix.  Our server Denise did an outstanding job keeping us lubed up with drinks and explaining the food to us, she possessed a true understanding of the menu and how each dish is prepared.  This, sadly, is such a rarity these days its rather depressing.  

Well done all around!!  The fact that I'm not bitching about anything is a true accomplishment.",mqs2LJvOirvSgpR-fpxOaA,1,0,5,fJR5AqHdzwV1YIBMTnzRdA

2736220,2014-04-28,5,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"Local friends brought my wife and me here for dinner tonight, and we enjoyed ourselves very much. I felt moved to write a review, but first I was curious to see what other people had written. 

I think it's hysterical that a few days ago, some guy who has absolutely no identifying information on his profile besides a generic first name posted a two-star review that says nothing about whether he's ever eaten the food at Sporting Life, only that he believes all recent good reviews must be coming from the owner's friends. The funniest part (to me, anyway)? It's the only two-star review he's ever given. All five others are one star. Apparently he likes Sporting Life twice as much as anywhere else he's ever been. :-)

Anyway, to my review (and I assure you, ""Brian,"" I'd never heard of the place OR the owner before tonight):

It was nice to see a pretty good variety on the beer list, and I had a couple of pints of Czechvar. 

The duck confit pizza really is more of a flatbread, but semantics aside, it was outstanding. Generous helping of savory duck, sweet dates, and goat cheese to balance the extremes. Before that, we enjoyed some great deviled eggs - not your grandmother's mayo and pickle juice deviled eggs, but a step beyond and worth taking the leap (and absurdly inexpensive).

Fried pickle chips were in a crisp batter, not greasy, and surprisingly not too salty. We also got to try a pork belly over polenta that the chef was trying out, and it was outrageously good; I hope he adds it to the permanent menu. I also got to try someone's tomato bread - not quite bruschetta, but something very close, and deliciously subtle with an ideal amount of garlic.

We wrapped things up with bread pudding, easily one of the best I've had (though it was a little odd to see it arrive shaped like a brick), and accompanied by salt caramel ice cream.

Listen, I appreciate that people have a pretty fixed idea in their heads what a sports bar ought to look like and serve, but there are burgers, wings, steak sandwiches, and plenty of middle-of-the-road beers on the menu for people who aren't terribly adventurous. If that's what you want to eat, eat it - why should you care what else they serve, or be threatened by what their other customers are eating? If you want a place that ONLY offers The Six Foods Every Sports Bar Serves¬ô, I'm pretty sure there's a Hooters not far away. In the meantime, they've got a good array of TVs and a wide variety of sports on the screens in addition to good food and drink, so it works for me. 

In addition to one or two poker trips every year with my wife, my new job will be bringing me back to Vegas once or twice a year as well. Whether I'm/we're staying on the Strip or not, Sporting Life is going to be a standard stop for us as long as they continue to serve creative, quality food. And for gosh sakes, I might even have ""just"" a burger one of those times. I'll bet they're pretty good.",M14xD6Ijy9vatMOjU4ej6A,6,2,5,YToSxqPE_hoV58Wzcvptqg

Service from the staff is exemplary. They anticipate your needs and are always friendly and attentive. The food is 5 star quality, it is made with care and attention to detail you don't find in other sports bars.

Chris, the Ohio State organizer, was outstanding. As a first time he made me feel like a welcome part of the family! He ran several events throughout the game and kept peoples' spirits up, despite the depressing score.

I was mortified after inviting friends for a nosh after reading a stellar, mouth-watering review of Sporting Life in Desert Companion. What an awful tasting we had. I kept ordering hoping something would redeem the previous gastronomical atrocities. I believe the writer to blame is Jim Begley for misleading, wholly off-base review. Never ever ever will I go back to this establishment. The food was inedible. The steamed clams reeked to the point we had to put them at the far edge of the booth until our server could take them away. The Skin and balls were starchy chokes. The tuna poke was meh, probably the only thing digestible other than the drinks. Thankfully they had czechvar on draft to make our trek across town not totally pointless.  The deviled eggs had no taste, so ok, those could go down. But by god! Why?? What in the name possessed the reviewer in Desert Companion to give this awful assault on palates such a high recommendation? Perhaps the owner or chef is great friends with the critic. That seems to be the only logical explanation in my mind other than a hefty bribe. Don't waste your time unless you're just going to get a drink!! I never write yelp reviews but felt I needed to help offset the well publicized misinformation. Perhaps Saturday afternoon/evening is not the time to go. Perhaps they have some severe deviation in quality at that time. But by god, how does anyone screw up bar food?? Somehow the Sporting Life could screw it up. Don't be fooled. Don't go.

The food here is a bit of a hit or miss. At one end is the special menu short ribs with kimchee and rice which is absolutely delicious and a full meal. At the other end is an average at best chicken sandwich. Again on the plus side, they have some good fries and a large variety of appetizers, some of which are better than others. Skins and balls, despite the somewhat crude name, is a must-try. The pork belly can vary in quality, while the steak is a salty but tasty treat.

My main wish here is that they'd have some more extensive happy hours. They have a late night midnight-2am happy hour on a random selection on food, such as the skirt steak appetizer which is 5 instead of the normal 10 dollars.

As for the drinks, they have an excellent selection of draft beers, though we have on multiple occasions been informed that they had run out of this or that. Prices are reasonable, but not as cheap as a lot of dive bars. My friends have unfortunately not really enjoyed their mixed drinks as much.

Another plus is they have a nice dart board area which is far nicer than most establishments. They even have some real weighted darts to throw, though they're worn and the flights are often iffy at best. Still, if you have your own darts, it's a nice place to play.

Last but not least, the trivia night here is not as strong as other locations, but is a nice little fun activity anyways. Some of the questions are a little too out there, and it'd be better to have a handful more easy ones to go along with the difficult ones.

Other places in the valley have tried to imitate it and don't come close.  Sporting Life's version is an absolute winner.

It's absolutely THE place in Las Vegas (and maybe anywhere outside of The Great State of Ohio) to watch the Buckeyes.   

It's the Best Damn Bar in the Land.",TFfFBvt2GM7uj3LmLie_7w,0,0,5,qYnGc10ZPUkmRZQbAX0kMg

After I enjoyed them I was informed they are salt brined and then confied in duck fat before they're fried.  Let's just put it this way, I had to stop myself from eating the bones.  They where amazingly juicy and literally would pull right apart from the bone like it was cotton candy. The ranch which I used for the celery and carrots was delicious, you could tell that it was made in house and not store bought. I still haven't had the steamers, I'm dying to try them but I think I might have ruined that chance by trying the wings first. Not sure I'll ever order anything else.

Several dart boards, 
Pinball, 
Excellent food,
A ton of T.V.s,
And a ticker during game day!
Thanks to Troy's suggestion the chicken sandwich I tried is amazing. 
The Ruben is great only I do no sauerkraut (personal preference) and sub coleslaw on the sandwich.
Fish and chips are ridiculously good and a large portion at that. 
They have a $5 dollar wing special on Saturday nights and their wings are no joke.
Four fully intact wings with drum, flat, and the tiny little extra wing tip that just adds to the fact their a real full wing. Beware their mild is a medium,  anything above in their house made sauce has serious kick.

We got a table next to the bar and waited patently for our server, about 15 minutes later a waitress  slowly came over and handed us menu's. She was very nice and polite and pointed out their draft beers which we ordered 2 pitchers. We had one friend that wasn't drinking and he was promptly brought water. The beers on the other hand, took about 8-10 minutes. When we got the pitcher it was half foam, we were pretty disappointed. So we poured our drinks and waited for our server to come back. We asked about the foam and she said we were going to get (1) free beer.. Which was brought also extremely foamy. 

We ordered, and everything was extremely over priced. (In my opinion) and they weren't serving desert at 10. I enjoyed my steak sandwich, but my buddies didn't enjoy what they ordered. They only offer wings in increments of 4. The wings were pretty good.

The atmosphere was nice. Great music and all the local sports on the TV. After we ate; we played darts, which was fun.

Fried Pickles: Good batter, but lacking in seasoning. Pickles were stuck together. 

Beer Mac & Cheese: The worst. First of all, that's not macaroni, it's pappardelle. Horrible sauce and what is all this bread crumb business? It's not helping the dish, it's making it much worse. 

Burger: Its a burger. I'm surprised that they didn't screw it up due to screwing up Mac & cheese. It was fine. 

Steak Sandwich: Good. Cooked perfectly. Could have been warmer.

Drinks come, and they're fine. 

Our first appetizer comes (fried pickles), and I'm a little shocked by the meager portion.  They taste alright, but the pickles are all stuck together and under seasoned. Not a great beginning.  

The second appetizer comes out, beer Mac and cheese. A disgrace.  First, the chef should read the definition of macaroni.  It doesn't just mean pasta (this Mac and cheese uses a flat noodle). I'd gladly forgive this transgression, but the flavor was just awful.  Pointless, overpriced, and not fit for human consumption.  

Ok, so we're very concerned at this point and have lowered our expectations greatly. The entrees arrive (after a while, but we were primed for this) and the burger was actually good. In spite of my burned bun. The steak  sandwich we ordered tasted alright, but was cold, and chewy.

4721787,2015-12-03,0,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"One of my favorite local spots in the area.  One the surface it's a typical local gaming sports bar, but it's actually an unassuming culinary wonder.  Ok, well culinary wonder is a bit much, but it sure sounds better than awesome place to eat; which it is. 

You wouldn't think a bar like this would have such a unique menu, but you're in for a surprise.  The trend in local Las Vegas seems to be more gourmet/gastro-pubish food in gaming bars, and they certainly are setting a standard.  

My favorite items:
-Pork Belly and Polenta
-Deviled Eggs
-Chicago Style Hot Dogs
-Beer Mac'n'cheese
-Tacos; they are awesome!
-Killer Beer list

Plus it's a nice place with a good darts area.  With a grouping of cozy booths, it's actually a decent place to bring your significant other.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,0,0,5,v6CFsZM99bU56BWPglo_zg
4744319,2014-07-07,9,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"Most sports bars offer chicken wings and sliders, bar top gaming, and the ubiquitous Golden Tee machine.  But how many of them offer braised pork belly served on top of house made polenta, or a braised beef short rib Philly sandwich?  Sporting Life Bar has taken a sort of casual gastropub approach, where both the food and beer selection is of much higher quality than your typical neighborhood bar, but the pricing sits far below your typical menu at self proclaimed gastropubs.

I was admittedly hesitant to eat here based on some previous reviews, but either I have wildly different taste in food, or maybe the kitchen has gone through some recent changes for the better.  Deviled Eggs were basic, but at only $0.50 per egg, it makes for a cheap snack that comes out fast.  The Braised Pork Belly with Polenta was a winner, nice and tender with a sweet glaze that had me wondering if I should get another order.  I also tried a daily special, Korean style short ribs served with house made kimchi.  The ribs had a good kalbi flavor, and they were quite tender.  Trying to take one bite meant having all of the meat fall of the bone effortlessly.

Beer selection here is good, with Brooklyn Lager, Ballast Point, Ommegang and Green flash being offered on draft.  Drafts I've had ranged from $4-$6; not too bad.  Bottle selection is decent too, including Deschutes, Kona, Dogfish Head, Duvel and Stone.  You can also get a flight of three beers for $10.  How many sports bars do that?

Outside of food and drink, they also have a Tuesday night pub quiz that starts at 7:00pm.  On Wednesday nights they have two rounds of darts tournaments, at 7:30pm and 12:30am.  I haven't been to either event, but the main reason I first came here was to play darts, and they are serious about it.  An entire wall lined with cork holds four steel tip dart boards, and the throwing line is built into the floor; it's not just a strip of tape on the ground.  House darts are of better quality than at other bars, but it seems that most people who come here to play bring their own dart sets; again, people are serious about it here, and it's a cool spot that caters to it.

While not located in my neighborhood, the combination of good food, good beer, and good darts has easily made this a locals bar that is worth driving to.  Not only is this a sports bar that the southwest deserves, it's one that it needs.  Proof that a bar does not need to be a generic, cookie cutter chain that starts with a P and end with a T.",lsZlV02ZdqEzR-qILdT7Cw,16,13,4,7dHaUFz7rk9IRgZ4b17ABA

I recently met up with a few friends at this bar to watch some basketball. I cringed when they told me this was the place we were meeting. My first visit to this bar a few months back was beyond dismal. My buddy wanted to give it a second chance because the concept behind the bar sounds like a great place to kick it and watch sports. I was hangry and recalled them having some pretty decent food, so I decided to give it a second chance as well. Little did I know of the ridiculousness that would ensue... I almost reached my breaking point sitting in a booth for close to 10 minutes, waiting on a server to order myself a drink. She came along just as I was getting up to go to the bar to order. After finally receiving my drink, I took a sip and a deep breath. Ahhhhh, I finally had a drink, I'm chillin', things are good. Then, out of nowhere, i see a couple dogs in the bar. I look closer to see if they were assistance dogs because I have no problem with a professionally trained dog being in an establishment. But nope, just you average, rowdy dogs; one being held back because it was trying to jump up on people and the other small enough for the owner to allow it to walk on one of the back tables for people to walk up and pet the pup. Were we in Sporting Life Kennel?? I was confused. Still, I was fine with the dogs because it wasn't affecting us...that is until we decided to order food. The waitress finally made her way back around to us and asked us if we would like to order food. Looking at me first, I started telling her my order. I was looking down at the menu while ordering so I didn't realize that, mid order, she bent over and started playing with one of the dogs. MID ORDER. We all look at each other like is this really happening?! Finally she stands back up and asks for my order again. No apology or anything. I politely told her I didn't want to order food anymore and to move on to the rest of the group. Her response killed me. ""What? Don't worry, I'm gonna wash my hands."" Really, woman? That's what you think I'm upset about? Rude. Finally, the game we went there for was about to start only to look up and see 3 black screens and Fox News on another. No game. We tried to tell them what channel it was on but they did not listen. Or maybe they couldn't hear us over the extremely loud trivia game being played throughout the bar. At that point we all had had enough of Kennel Trivia Life Bar and decided to all head home to watch the rest of the game. The game they claimed was not on TV.

They had four really nice looking booths, but they were already occupied, the rest of the tables were in the bar and were mismatched and didn't look very comfortable. We sat and waited and waited and waited. We saw two servers talk and discuss who was going to take our table and yet no one came over or even acknowledged us with a smile or anything. Another couple came in and sat down and they got menus at least from a less than friendly server. After waiting almost 8 minutes w/no acknowledgement, we got up and left. With this kind of service, I don't know why they even bothered opening. There are too many good restaurants in Las Vegas to waste our time and money to be ignored. This was a disappointment since we have been looking forward to this place re-opening since we live just up the road and we used to go there a lot when it was the Outside Inn :(",5XzSyThRGGPp_NjPPF8i2g,2,1,1,GWrJU9ElFRA9FwS-H4sWTQ
4851238,2015-04-15,0,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"I had read some solid reviews for Sporting Life and decided to check it out. This place is a sports bar, 100% geared toward adults who are looking for a place to drink, smoke, maybe play some video poker and watch the game, so leave the kids at home! I liked the dart boards along the wall, and there is a loft upstairs, which I assume is for private parties, since I didn't venture up there. I had a few draft beers and a Cuban sandwich, which was a non-menu special; here is the rundown...

PROS: For a Vegas sports bar, this place has an incredible menu! I have read great things about the food, and from looking around, the menu items I observed others eating looked great. As I mentioned I had a Cuban sandwich, which was tasty and filling. The fries were piping hot, and the appetizer deviled eggs I had easily could rival my Grand Ma's! They were simply excellent.

The service was spot on. The guy behind the bar gave me a sample of a beer, and was cool when I ordered something different. Very friendly and attentive. I liked the layout of the bar, and there was plenty of room without the place feeling big with wasted space.

The beer (Tenaya Creek Brown Ale) was ice cold and crisp. I was tempted to order a ""Dark & Stormy"" (Rum with ginger beer) for only $5! Finally, the price was very reasonable. 2 beers, small appetizer and a sandwich for about $23 minus the tip.

CONS: My main complaint was the wait time. I ordered a few deviled eggs and a sandwich with fries. It took about 15 minutes for the appetizer and another 15 minutes for the sandwich. The sandwich was good, but wasn't as hot as I'd of liked it to be. It seemed they grilled the bread to fast, so that the outside was was a little over cooked, but the inside was lukewarm. Still, the sandwich tasted great, with thick slices of ham, cheese, pickles and mustard. And the skinny fries were very hot. The bar wasn't super packed and the wait time was a little unreasonable. I usually don't mind waiting for great food, but sandwich should of been a little hotter. 

For the price, and being a locals bar, I really like the food. Next time I'm going for some of the other menu items I've read about, as it looked great from what I saw. Definitely going back to Sporting Life... You should check them out!",2cuoUfAC3rhRS3nj9cf0Cg,4,3,4,0aOGrpQFS_h9_mU9TV0gqw

It's a neighborhood bar in location and feel, but it's the little details that make it. 

It's one of the few places with multiple dart boards. I also don't like those plastic divet kinds with the safety tips and prefer cork board and metal tips. Theres also a pinball machine and golden tee if darts aint your thing. 

The food is more comfort food, with a twist. More gastropub style than average bar with offerings like duck confit on the menu...it was not what I expected to see. I only took bites of friends orders, but the food seemed decent. There were some hits and some misses discussed among the group, but I didn't follow as I was swimming in food from having dinner prior to coming.

There seems to be sweet specials. At this time there were drink and $5 meal specials for football. There is also a happy hour 4-6 Mon- Fri and lunch specials before 2pm.

One star for atmosphere, one star for friendly server... when we saw her anyways...

What a mess...
I really wanted to love this place. The exterior is adorbs and the interior is cool... that's where it's appeal ends. When we entered at 1:30pm on football Sunday we took a moment to find a table facing our game. Easy enough considering most tables were occupied. And then we waited... and waited... and waited...
10 minutes later I approached the bar. ""Do we order here or are there waitresses?"" I was informed there were waitresses and that one should be over soon to take orders for drinks. I ordered our beers and a soda anyways. Ten minutes later our beers arrived... no soda. Another ten minutes... soda arrived. I was starting to sense a trend. Twenty minutes later we ordered. The server (possibly a manager?) apologized and made excuses for the wait. The food was abysmal. I mean, really. The best thing we had was the deviled eggs which came on a bed of oil. Interesting... The mac & cheese bites were bland, the hot dog bun was soggy, the queso dip was SOUP (I sent it back) the pretzel bites weren't horrible, the hummus was so thick and CHUNKY that it resembled pulled pork... gross! 
The empty plates sat on the table for over an hour even though the server came over to check on us three times.  Shameful.

In conclusion: I don't know what is going on in the kitchen, but it ain't good  I'm guessing that the service issues are due to under-staffing. This place could be GREAT... but it's just plain sad. The only thing that saved us was the bucket ""0"" beer.

Located on South Jones and long on my radar as a place to watch The Buckeyes it was finally for Saturday NFL action that I stopped in to The Sporting Life, and setting aside an early service gaff that left me entirely ignored for nearly ten minutes the subsequent hundred minutes and four plates passed during the course of a Panthers victory over Atlanta was a mix of the expected, impressive, and truly surprising.

Open 24/7 with packages for all the major sports allowing them to cater to all varieties of interests, it was just after 3pm that I entered the windowless tavern and with Christmas decorations still lit juxtaposing a central bar plus a few rounded booths and several tables it was suggested I seat myself - a hightop in the back with views of NBA, NHL, and playoff football action in full display as servers dressed in Scarlet and Grey and Cleveland Browns polos made me feel right at home - the lack of an annoying bar-tunes soundtrack an added bonus, though I'm told it plays on other nights when trivia or darts crowds fill the room.

Treated to complimentary WiFi while sticking to water as my drink of choice it was to a wide ranging menu of bar-food staples and intriguing upscale options that I focused my attention and opting to sample a little of each a four part order was crafted, the kitchen expedient while service improved dramatically after bonding over Ohio State's New Years Day win.

Starting with competent $5 Happy Hour Pretzel bites paired with hoppy melted cheese served alongside a Cracker Jack-riffing composition of pork-rinds and peanuts that tasted every bit as ludicrous and decadent as it sounds it was at a deliberately slow pace that savored each bite and eventually finding the tilted bowl empty the second part of the order was sent out, a crisp flatbread somewhat uninspired in its lightly charred crust but exponentially upgraded by toppings that walked a fine line between sweet and savory, the confit surprisingly moist while well-chopped dates and poignant goat cheese each found a willing dance partner in acid forward moustarda far more nuanced than one would ever expect in a 'bar.'

Admittedly biased in my love of desserts it was still to the server that I deferred when asking which sweet ending he thought was best and although it would have been ordered anyway his strong support of the bread pudding should not go without notice, the half-melted-on-arrival ice cream a bit of a turn off, but the texture and flavor of the amalgam of butter, caramel, and flan-soft brioche truly transcendent and on par with that at Truffles n' Bacon for the best of this style served in the valley.

With 24/7 bars featuring video poker, cheap drinks, smoking, and weekday party games as much a staple of Las Vegas culture as the 24/7 diner is to that of The Big Apple it is more than a little impressive to see a place like Sporting Life willing to take chances with the menu and although not everything here is perfect, particularly the smell of smoke in the air, one would be hard pressed to name another place turning out a duck confit pizza at 6am - no less a top notch bread pudding available at all hours of the day.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,3,2,4,7WOm4YPpDxjlO_8LQw7HSw

The return visit: A  Generated a love for $14-$20 pitchers of beers, a menu that draws from French to Asian cuisines, and a friendly staff. Yes, they still have the classic bar items, yet some have a new face. The grilled portobello mushroom burger is my go to meal. The large and tender cap is big enough for the perfect bite each time. With a generous amount of their pesto spread and the substitution of avocado instead of mozzarella makes for my perfect sandwich. Especially since they make their own breads and buns. This one comes on a soft pretzel bun. The pig ears and pork rinds are my guilty pleasure. I can pretend to eat healthy. I'll grab the flowering kale salad or my preferred burger, but somehow my drunk self always goes back to this crispy, salty snack. 

The downside: I am not the biggest fan of their liquor selections and I want a shuffleboard table.

I love how clean this place is. Example, the runner who took away my food was wearing gloves; he asked our server to bring me a fresh cup as I requested a refill due to sanitary concern.  The runner courteously explained that their policy say the runner who takes food away don't serve food to customers to avoid cross contamination.

They have a ton of really nice flat screen tvs.  The decor is clean and inviting.  Yes - A bit bright.  I'm sure that can be fixed.  I thought having a live betting odds board was a cool touch.  I enjoy sports gambling and knowing the latest information while I watch the games is cool...especially for not being in a casino.   I love football and can't wait to see what the place does for the games.

Personally I think the food is a breath of fresh air!  I think the menu has classic ""bar"" food everyone knows and loves.  Create your own burger, nachos, potato skins, wings, french fries, (which you can get loaded) and two types of steak sandwiches.  They offer things you don't see on traditional bar food menus as well.  Hello Pork Belly? .50 cent deviled eggs?  Personally I like duck and glad to see you can get 2 duck tacos for $4

The wings are super delicious.  You get 4 WHOLE wings.  Which for those that may not understand 1 ""Wing"" includes a wing, drum, and flapper.  I was told the wings are confit in duck fat then fried crispy.  The meat literally falls off the bone and the skin was crisp!  

I used to live on the east coast (Jersey) and I saw they are making Scrapple.  That is something I've not seen in years.  I can't wait to try the Scrapple when I go for breakfast.  

I guess if you want the boring everyday pub food you eat at PTs there is one on every corner right?   I'm giving the place 4 our of 5 stars. Mostly because yes, it was a bit bright for a video poker bar. The AC was blasting and it was a bit cold and the men's room smelled ""perfumy"" which I guess is better than the alternative.  

The bar service was outstanding.  There was a bald guy behind the bar who was attentive and had a sense of humor.   The other bartender was super nice and had a great smile.  They both seemed down to earth and friendly.  We didn't sit at a table or interact with the other servers.  I for sure will go back again.",tuzWTI-1psOsSsyFJLuthg,4,0,4,-hSNWRLYktMeIxCPzhtriA

5778692,2014-04-17,1,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"I had so hoped this bar would be awesome because it's less than a mile from my house, and I've been looking forward to making it my go to neighborhood bar. After months and months of waiting for them to finally finish renovating, both the food and service were a disappointment - and I didn't even walk in expecting much. 

There was no online menu, but since all the other reviews commented on how the food really didn't match a sports bar, I thought it could be really good.  An overly ambitious sous chef who came from Bouchon sounded promising as hell.  I was impressed when we walked in and saw that the daily taco was duck confit with chorizo, and only $4 for 2!  Unfortunately, execution on everything we ordered was kind of a fail. 

Duck confit is almost always good, but I wouldn't have known that was chorizo if it hadn't said so on the board - assuming it's house made, and the spices weren't there at all. There was also so much creme fraiche that it overwhelmed everything else. I would maybe order it again, but more because it's so cheap than for flavor.

Potato skins are pretty standard bar food, but they tried to fancy it up with fried croquettes, that I assumed would be potato, but ended up containing liquid cheese with fatty bits of bacon in it. The potato skins were burnt and the portion was ridiculous - it really was 1 potato skin (1/2 a potato) cut into 3 strips. It was a typical potato skin, nothing special and for $7 I wouldn't suggest ordering it. I also have no idea why it's called potato ""skins"" on the menu - because it's actually a singular skin, not plural? 

Duck confit pizza (which actually should be ""pizza"") was in reality a flat bread - they could argue that it was an extremely thin crust pizza, but that would be a bs. There's a fair amount of duck, lots of goat cheese, chopped dates, a really sweet mostardo (like fruit chutney) and a couple things that weren't mentioned - huge dried apricots and dried whole chilis. This was an ok dish. The chilis and savory balanced out the sweetness somewhat, but not enough. I like heat, but it really also needs to be mentioned in the description that the whole chilis are on there. We were told that ""everybody loves"" this dish, but I wouldn't order it again. 

Deviled eggs were good, but can you even screw that up? Maybe with too much salt. But that was very good and only 50cents each. 

Service was friendly from 1 girl, but I think the pregnant bartender just looked like she wanted to go home, which she did later as she just left without closing out our bill, or bothering to say anything. We were at the bar but ignored the majority of the time. After trying to flag down someone to pay the bill for 10 minutes, we had to get up and give it to them at the other end of the bar. 

They refilled my friend's water constantly, and my drink was cheap only $6 and pretty strong. Those were probably the only positives of the night. And they have lots of big TV's, so this bar will be good for games. But since I don't watch sports I likely won't be coming back.",dsaj_eA71FvpUh49zzKcGA,7,3,2,z1J0Z4UzVAsRNHPy1KvYDw

Had the chicken nachos and a frosty beverage whole enjoying some sports on the tube. It's really a place to enjoy football if you're from out of town as they have all the games on the TVs that surround the whole place. Not too rowdy on game day re is a lot of passion in the room.

We were 6 Irish guys who wanted to do the full vegas experience but top of our list was somewhere to hold our dart tournament. Now we didn't just want somewhere with dart boards we wanted somewhere to spend the day, eat great food and drink good beer. We were looking for a gastro dart pub. Impossible we thought until we found this gem
We had looked on yelp and found sporting life. I contacted the bar and scooter emailed me back to say they would be delighted to have us. He gave us directions and we hopped in a cab from the luxor. It was about 25 bucks so happy days. When we got there and walked through the door there was an audible gasp from the guys, it was like they had built this bar just for us. 4 brand new dart boards all together.  This however would have been for nought if the food and beer weren't up to scratch. We were delicate from the night before but our waitress helped us through their menu. I had the most delicious Reuben sandwich. Bread was crispy , pastrami plentiful and full of flavour. Scooter himself was there and he helped us pick the best beers to try. We're a diverse lot and we he helped pick a perfect one for each of us. The czechvar was particularly good. He even joined us in a few games of darts . To have a bar owner give you this level of attention was great to see. 
We played darts for the day and never had to once look for service. Our waitress was polite attentive and funny , what more could you ask for. Having enjoyed our first meal so much we decided to go again which we would never normally do. This time we went with a range of food for us all to share, the nachos nearly caused a riot between us they were so good. 
We can not heap enough praise on scooter and his staff. When shifts changed the new waiter that came on was to the same high level and organised taxis back to our hotel. We spent 8 hours there and loved every minute. Every Irish person we know going to vegas will be sent to this great bar",xggqB8uCEWaI-FxxXvX65Q,0,0,5,gTZ3bHPfzKy1T8Yg9nHHig
5923692,2016-10-06,0,8wt-saX_qXaqVCXQHc5qXw,"I'm rating this in terms of a sports bar.  

Food was good.  Not the normal fare of a typical sports bar.  I had the pork belly, wings, potato skins, and the cheese filled potato balls.

Pork belly was good, the sauce will stick to your teeth sometimes and you may hit a salty spot here and there.  But over all nice flavor and tender.

The Wings were fall apart tender.  Good flavor, but again hit some salty spots.  I wish I try some of the other sauces.

The potato skins were a bit under cooked for my taste.  Call me old fashion but some sour cream would have gone well with them.

Cheese filled balls.  I wish the cheese used in the balls was more chewy and less watery.  If it was not a liquid when you ate them it would have been about 100 times better.

Inside of this place was very roomy, but we ended up right next to some smokers.  It is strange to be eating food that's pretty good, and yet have people smoking around you.  I guess I'm just not used to that any more.  That's what Vegas was like when I first moved here years ago.",aj2pS6AFVlzKDDUrisIRaA,0,0,4,J_e6cJHYlRnrTm_juao44A

My friend and I decided to order and share a few items from the menu. We got the duck confit tacos, which were a daily special, deviled eggs, duck confit pizza and potato skins with croquettes.

None of the food we ordered was amazing but I did enjoy aspects of each dish. The duck in the pizza and tacos was really good, but the other items in each dish left a lot to be desired. The tacos needed a little more flavor. The tortillas were a little dry and the tomato and creme fraiche were bland. The pizza, which was more of a flatbread, was good but overly sweet. My dining companion came across lots of chiles on her slices but none of mine had any of that. The goat cheese added a nice savory flavor, but the fruit definitely overpowered this dish.  The deviled eggs were good, but very basic. I would recommend these at 50 cents each. The potato skins, which was basically half a potato cut into there measly slices served with three sad little cheese croquettes. These were the least appetizing of everything we ordered. Drippy and watery cheese inside a fried ball. I would not recommend this dish in the least. 

Service was ok at first but once it was time to settle our bill, it took forever for someone to pay any attention to us at all. It was even more annoying given the fact that we were sitting at the bar. 

The menu is ambitious, but lacks in execution. This would be a great bar to enjoy watching a game or fight, but I don't think I would have much reason to return.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,6,2,SWuQjlF0RLZOKxJ46IK_DA
