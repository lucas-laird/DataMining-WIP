All 3 times they only have 1 employee running around with no clue how to make sandwiches , meaning pressing the bread down and cutting it wrong , Hardly putting lettuce on down to burning the bread, besides all of this I've noticed I've never been able to order anything here. I wait in line they ask me to sit down it may be a while if they speak English . I wait 15-20 mins and still usually never get to the front of a 4 person line. They have to take the order make the food take the gloves if receive payment then wash hands and tend to next customer. Whoever runs this place is atrocious and puts their 1 employee through hell. Don't recommend this place at all",a3no_-n6KcHSG0gOlBK1-Q,1,1,1,1R2EM5YvCCCFcJxaUt1Crg

And before we finished paying, he had his phone on one hand and the other was on the computer. I'm only giving this one star due to poor customer service.",-rHsYosN1p0wrMLjS_7FIQ,0,0,1,CbSvN-aVO6mbIoJxkP7oEg

No restrooms. $3.00 breakfast which is a coffee or soda drink and a six inch egg and meat sub. I keep coming back for quick breakfast.,Y8_yCJ7N7LyqqJ-rSxd4iQ,1,0,3,nugyAhP9P7DfdkOb4wDcXA
