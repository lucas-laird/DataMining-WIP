Until recently, there haven't been a lot of food options besides fast food and even then, pickings were slim: all that was available was mostly burger chains. Carl's Jr is one of them. I've been a regular on and off throughout the years. I guess I'm one of the lucky ones, too, considering all the bad reviews. 

I've always received stellar service at this location, whether dining in or using the drive thru. My food comes out quick and there's never any hiccups. They even offered a treat for my dog when I pulled up to the window with her once.

I prefer Carl's over other burger chains in the area because the company has got their formula for a great burger down! Tastes like it came from the grill, just the way I like it. I'll always be a repeat customer.",l--K3xQWVqs93iFhAoEYag,2,2,4,PhH0N3Ipyw8-aCZGC80uXg

When I went inside I told the young guy behind the counter he had just given me my meals and that he didn't give me a receipt either and that my meals were still incorrect. He kept telling me ""just wait"" and so I did. About five minute later he walked over to me and said ""oh yea, well you have to wait"" so I continued waiting. He looked over at me walked back over and yelled ""I don't know you"". When I explained to him I had just left the drive thru and retold him my whole order and when told him I was the person he almost forgotten to give back the debit card to he got more upset and yelled again ""I don't know you, you could be anyone without a receipt"". Well as I said he didn't give me one. So he walked away back to the drive thru window laughing at me and staring, so I walked out accepting defeat. Well my sister who was with me didn't give up as easily she went back in with everything including the card used and explained were missing items. He turned and looked at her with a mean smirk and laughed at her as well but with her he pushed the missing items into her hand and said ""here!"" and walked away from her rudely. All this happened within a few minutes so I have no clue why we were treated like criminals trying to scam when he had just seen us and spoke to us moments before. I understand mistakes, we all make them, however I am swearing off RUDE businesses. I never went back and never will.",d-r2DiqbY3cR-GI2F13vAw,0,0,1,Aiorb67jnL-UWlPKHDqaYg

We also asked if we can order more and she replied with a ""what do you want"" in a rude way that made us not want anything else. They also got our order wrong we got tater tot's instead of the onion rings we ordered.  The time was 10:40am",rDwmkt6wb78fuaTKDGUGdg,0,0,1,WrwOpg3xhwUi5_YvDx9Vvg

Staff was quick to take care of the situation at hand. But from the look of it he had been there for quite awhile. The food was delivered promptly and was as expected. Just be aware of your surroundings around this area of town, and don't be surprised of the treasures you can find.",C6ymMVakuj-L2ZxTuplOWQ,0,0,2,CXUMNhnjVdLGaauI5aNXyg
2640153,2015-12-26,1,EAyy8Z0V5zfO_LXxSqkD-A,"This Carl's Jr. Was horrible! The cashier didn't even acknowledge that there were people in line! I know the drive through was a bit busy but at least she could have said ""one moment"" or something! Instead she ignores 3 families in line and then when she ran us up said ""what do you want?"" 

Not the way I would hope to be treated at any place of service. Food was okay but it felt like they didn't want people in the restaurant to begin with and that they hated their jobs",rqb5abV146wcU-Z7JxfEIQ,1,1,1,QqaaDGLqfd91_gBqzjXkNA

The smell was so horrible it reminded me of the way public bathrooms in parks or beaches smell. If I didn't have to go so bad I would've just walked right out! The toilet bowl was dirty, and the sink was so DISGUSTING I don't know how you were supposed to get your hands clean in it. Who is the manager? How can they let this go on, because this was the kind of dirty that doesn't just happen over night!",FpU8Ztk-h9zwH-Z3asBAig,0,0,2,y7Q98RLkldJUiVs3W9S-ow

The tomatoes tasted spoiled! I can't believe they put that in there. It was really soggy and I had to wait until 10:30 so that they could give it to me I got their at 10. Very disappointed, most likely will not go again.",xVNVMQSNNX3MLRaV_KsbEA,0,0,1,vsAwsZMPzs94C8-N5MPx0A

Carl's Jr is Las Vegas just seems to be not worth it over all, this isn't the only location with shady practices and less than okay food.",sfWkPu16Tz1RVCXBjCM58g,0,0,1,HngqCwTauyAqqWKOVzj7pQ

Food is burnt and dry (burgers & fries). Came by once at 9:15pm and they had closed early (supposed to be open inside til 10pm) went around through the drive thru and the person working DT is hanging out the window smoking a cigarette and they were rude also when they actually has to work. Complained to their corporate management to no avail. Wont be back.",e8Y8NIX1fTmM9kAan859Kw,3,0,1,o2GHEoEtYdkBpQj5QE3MHQ
