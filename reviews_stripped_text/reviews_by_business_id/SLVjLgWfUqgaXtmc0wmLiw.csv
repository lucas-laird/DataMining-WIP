On top of that, the cooks are great. Overall a very friendly staff. And ALWAYS a great time. I wish I could give more than 5 stars!! Hands down. Best bar staff ever.",m9KhtY5lzbcQxXJQHBTCAQ,0,0,5,dlS7IPfGrETkhLePihvC6g

But did refuse to serve him anymore because he was drunk. He's an accident waiting to happen. And a local there. I want be ordering my chicken wings from here anymore, or taking friends in there..",UlYYmCBz4x_VtEv3NpEFeA,0,0,1,bQ_k9KcYgO92bhE1Xf9pBw

It smells like ""stale"" cigarette smoke the bartenders are like off in their own little world...the food blows like they just microwave all their shit..& the best part (not) is that their drinks are RIDICULOUSLY expensive!! $6.95 for a shot?(not even a real shot half a shot is more like it) when I can go down the road and get an actual shot for 3 bucks? INSANITY!!!they're always out of shit too...like seriously somebody has a real inventory and stocking problem...how the hell can you be out of domestic beer? That's just simply retarded to put it mildly...won't be going back to this PT's as a matter of fact I probably won't be visiting anymore PT's period! 2 thumbs down",wtnLOataYL7kT3xaz9yccA,0,0,1,me2iuzfP40c4qbsmpaNIIw

1443162,2016-08-25,0,SLVjLgWfUqgaXtmc0wmLiw,First thing before anything. This place is the cleanest PT's in town. Looks small from outside but huge inside. I only came across it because I decided to take the bus instead of driving. I was waiting for the bus on Desert Inn and took a look around while I waited. I live two blocks away and will definitely be back. Pretty awesome spot. I just need to migrate my coworkers to this Spot because the PT's on Sahara and Paradise went down since the new bartender. This spot would do way better if they had a actual PT's post on Desert Inn. Can't wait to bring my friends here,KmmW2FZjC0nVbW09DZzNpQ,0,0,5,TTfuOcvnmrIPJvSDzZ2gmg

The bartenders are all awesome, to the extent that even if I come in here alone I'll have a good time. Adam always makes me feel welcome, and Eddie makes me a new unique drink whenever my normal orders are getting stale. I would 100% call this my favorite bar I've drank at in town. I wish I could give this place higher than a 5/5.",tsl0MmTMPluzthoq7-4ntA,1,0,5,us1JZf0C5L_Foj7PE76bWA

I'm not sure what it was. bartender wasn't too attentive but nice. then we finally order. we got one pizza and chilli fries. we had to wait a while. then bartender says the pizza didn't come out right. so we wait for the next one no problem. eventually 45 minutes have passed. and my friend never received her chilli fries. and the 2nd pizza stuck to the oven. at that point we gave up.",RvyPXz5lNPvrQd7rbYGy0g,0,0,1,Z7OAptEPr6zaMsl_3T6i0g
3087722,2018-01-08,3,SLVjLgWfUqgaXtmc0wmLiw,"It's a PT's. It's definitely not the worst PT's in the city like some have suggested. It is surprisingly large and inviting inside, but it had a funky smell the day we went in. The bartender also told us that about 75% of the beers were pouring foam so we had to have bottled beer. There are lots of TVs and video poker machines as well as plenty of seating for non-gamers. The food was on par with other PT's, though my bikini wrap had the faintest hint of spearmint and I can't figure out why. The Philly Cheese Steak was surprisingly good. Get the tots every time. There seems to be a lot of regulars here and the staff was very accommodating. I was definitely expecting a much older and small PT's but this was a surprise. Now I won't be afraid to come here and I will be back.",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,2,3,3,zOtaHuT4DZXTZmVAlFQ34g

There's golden tee, a pool table, and a juke box. What else could you want? Yes it might be the most neglected PT'S in the chain but if you're just looking for a neighborhood bar you won't be disappointed.",OLR4DvqFxCKLOEHqfAxpqQ,0,0,5,Wy8nWOMiUSpC8-wJ4vPRuQ
4265871,2017-11-23,0,SLVjLgWfUqgaXtmc0wmLiw,I love this location but my bartender kept swearing a complaining about how the company treats her like crap.  Not what I want to hear when I'm putting money into your company.  Plus I felt like I was a bother when asking for a drink even though I've spent hundreds of dollars.  I'm disappointed.  I would love to have a happy bartender.  I've spent well over $500 tonight and my bartender is chatting with the kitchen staff not asking if I need anything.  She's on her phone not helping me. I'm not happy as a regular patron.  It's time for someone who cares.  And the profanity coming out of her mouth makes me sick.,QmafXsaMi-Mx_JVris_izQ,3,0,1,kamm1q1l0NAIjv3fag1ZRQ

5529521,2014-12-03,91,SLVjLgWfUqgaXtmc0wmLiw,"Yes!!  I found it.  The shittiest PT's in Las Vegas!  The search is finally over.  What a relief.  

I come here a few Sundays a year because for some ridiculous reason, there are no New England Patriots bars in town and a bunch of fans congregate here for the games.  Those people make it fun, but I'd definitely go more often if the venue were better.    

You might say ""I've been to several shitty PT's.  How bad could it be?""

First, they're regularly out of most beers.  I'm not talking Sam Adams seasonal; I'm talkin Miller fuckin Lite.  

Here's a typical conversation:

Me: I'll have a Guinness.

Bartender:  We're out.

Me:   Stella?

Bartender:  Out.

Me: Horse urine?

Bartender:  Coors Light is all we have on tap right now.

Me: OK.  Give me the large.

How does the biggest chain of bars in Clark County forget to stock basic things like domestic beer?  Does the delivery person accidentally bypass this specific location??  I wouldn't blame them.  It has been open for well over a year, yet they still sport red and white vinyl signage.  I could imagine the corporate meeting regarding this bar: ""If it becomes profitable, we should put a white van in the parking lot and have it say 'BAR' with an arrow pointing left to increase exposure.""

Then there's the food.  Pizza is 50% off during happy hour.  After ordering, the bartender (on her own free will) said ""It's pretty good unless you're snooty about pizza or from the east coast.""  Well, gollygeekickmeinthenutswhiz, how could I not be pumped up now??  Upon first bite, safe to say it was pizza like none I'd had before.  It was a disgrace.  When the cook gets an order for this barely edible disc, the recipe card probably says:

1. Get cardboard 
2. Add ""canned red sauce"", ""pepperoni product"" and ""cheese product""
3. No need to heat
4. Serve

If that weren't enough, people can smoke to their dying heart's content here.  I've seen patrons leave the bar by halftime since it got so goddamn smoky.  Not sure why this is allowed.  Marge Simpson's sisters would give this place 5 stars.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,51,37,1,qmLObjrlFi7pP8Q9Wp9q7Q
5686007,2016-07-05,0,SLVjLgWfUqgaXtmc0wmLiw,"Ok place to watch football games. They get a small crowd of Patriots fans every game, and they some times can be a lively bunch. If you are close by this is a place to watch them play. Bartenders are always friendly and attentive. Not a very big crowd.",Z3ikG3lE6TaKtw9i1EMq_g,1,0,3,ZARtWYazFTnpZs6ZYH2nxA
5988112,2018-05-24,0,SLVjLgWfUqgaXtmc0wmLiw,My husband and I went to this location and was very unhappy with our experience. As a bartender myself I don't understand what this woman was doing and she had personal friends in there that were on drugs  it was all around a bad experience. So much for trying different locations we will still with our normal location or staying at the local bar around the corner,MSdgCfez_Bqcs7N5IdIc7w,0,0,1,n-1LNYo6A1nyLy01MrdQGQ
