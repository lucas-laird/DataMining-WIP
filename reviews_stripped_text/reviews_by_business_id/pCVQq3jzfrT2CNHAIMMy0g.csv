Anyway, I just demolished this burger and it was absolutely delicious. Far superior to a double double and you don't have to wait all day for the food to come. As for cleanliness, while I was there the manager (I assume) had an employee cleaning the inside of the window tracks and the rest of the restaurant was pretty spotless too.",dnp-e7SBVygsGo0TQXGTWQ,2,2,5,mNxLScAor6LcU8QpWCov_w

I ordered a kids meal which clearly said ""choice of burger, chicken fingers, or hot dog $7.59"". I ordered the burger with cheese and the cashier said without tax it would be $9 something so I opted out on the cheese. I pull up to the window (I was in drive thru) and the receipt still said $9.57 for a kids meal! I asked her again to explain why it was that much so she went and got a manager. After talking in circles saying that the burger was higher priced then the fingers,  she finally said it was because ""they charge extra tax"". On the receipt I had already been charged for tax so I asked why are we charged twice for tax??? She tells me to call corporate! 

Then to top it off the food was horrible. The burger was smashed and just thrown together. I used to love Fatburger and this location will make me second guess going to any other location again!",Jx4fTTZqsPyInvjo7ZQGIw,1,1,1,LugxrLxdaydrKNcBfVpc0A

The ladies working the counter and grill are friendly and efficient. There is usually plenty of seating for solos, couples and small groups. It's not a new location, so don't expect glamour, but it's usually tidy. 

We order the meal deal, with a drink and fat steak fries (or skinny fries).  It's not cheap fast food--one medium burger meal and one large burger meal will cost more than $20.

This was by far the worst of all the instances, though. I went through the drive-thru and a lady, Marisol (name on receipt), on the speaker asked if she could take my order. I had but a second to think when she rudely and quickly said, ""Just let me know when you're ready to order."" I said that I was ready to order & she did not respond. I said ""hello, can you hear me?"" Still no response. She finally came back on and said ""let me know when you're you ready to order"" I said yes, I have been  ready and started to place my order.  She cut-off me off and told me to hold numerous times while putting in my order. I get up to the window and ask if there was something wrong with the head set because it seemed like any time I started to talk I would get cut off. This lady immediately started to get aggressive with me and tell me, ""Well I told you to let me know when you're ready. I'm too busy here for you to decide what you want.""

There was no one behind me). I asked her if there something was wrong with the headset because I tried numerous tine to get her attention at the intercom. She became very unpleasant,  hostile, & very unprofessional. She  said she was too busy. After arguing with her and telling her she was cutting me off even when I tried to order and her denying this I finally just paid and waited for my food. When I asked for a manager she claimed she was a manager. This surprised me because I cannot believe anybody in their right mind would allow this awful woman to be a manager of anything. She is absolutely horrible with people (again, this isn't my first time dealing with this lady). I asked for her name and her manager's number. She said her name was on the receipt.

It's disgusting especially if Marisol makes your burger. She under cooks it the patty & never wears gloves. She touches everything with her bare hands & she never washes her hands. She will blow her nose & put the toppings on your burger directly after with her bare hands. Her customer service skills are non existent. She has A LOT of complaints with corporate, complaints with the owner (Peter), & to the main shift leader Ashley. Why does she still works there is beyond me. She has made many customers loose their appetite & walk out. She also take chunks of meat off of your burger & will eat it, & I mean shove the whole thing in her mouth & chew with her mouth open & stuff just falls out of it. She has worked there for 13-14 years & still is horrible at what she does. She is constantly touching her hair, boobs, face, nose & mouth. The burger might look & taste fine but trust me. It's gross. Jose & Raul are great. They will make your burger like they are making it for themselves. & their customer service skills are phenomenal. They clean as much as they possibly can between taking orders, cooking orders, & bringing customers their food. Ashley the shift manager is the best, she trained me & taught me everything I needed to know. She's great with customers, cleaning, & cooking.

I ordered the xxl cheeseburger, chili cheese fries,  and a coke. I think the tab came to around $15, give or take a few.  Yep, it's a tad spendy,  but in my opinion you do generally have to pay for quality,  and for fair wages for the grill staff. I don't  mind, my understanding is  (  and maybe I'm  wrong,  but I don't think so ) they pay the workers better than most Fast Food burger stands.

Anyway,  the burger and chili fries were AMAZING. I'll  be honest,  the sheer size and majesty of that xxl cheeseburger scared me a little  ( that doesn't happen often ) I wondered if id be able to ""kill the beast "" !   Huge. Juicy. Flavorful. Unique. A classic monster built burger. Did I mention Flavor ?  Abundantly flavorful.

The chili cheese fries are also amazing - because they are prescisely  what chili cheese fries are supposed to be, in my opinion. Thick tasty fries, smothered in flavorful chili with cheese. No beans. No fake cheese. No greasy limp fries. They were wonderful.

Like I mentioned at the top,  I hadn't  been a customer for years. The last Fatburger I ate at was in Redondo Beach,  So Cal.  Then moved to Idaho,  then here to beautiful Vegas !   So happy to see Fatburger has a presence here  :-)

First, get familiar with the size of the burgers here because they can get B-I-G! They have combo meals or you can easily just get a burger to satisfy your hunger.  
Here are burger sizes:
Small - 2.5oz
Medium - 5.3oz
Large - 8oz
XXL - 16oz
XXXL - 24oz

As you can see they have a size for any stomach. There are also a nice variety of toppings you can add to your burger.

They have a variety of crispy and grilled sandwich options. 
If you prefer turkey or veggie burgers they have them too!
You can also choose from chicken strips, hot dogs, and salads.
They have ""fat"" and ""skinny"" fries.
Grilled onions, jalapenos, and peppers are available upon request.

The shakes are ALL very good! Try one *if* you have room after your meal :)

If you like breakfast check them out for that sometime they have a pretty good bacon and egg sandwich.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,10,7,4,2XYJ4djPgfh7pJ8FKNWXqA

FOOD - 4 Stars
I was prepared to give this place a 4 Star rating.  I noticed a new menu since my last visit to a Fatburger and ordered a XXL with all of the toppings & added Bacon & Cheese.  For a side, I ordered the Skinny Fries.

After a 15 minute wait, I received my food.  To my surprise, the Burger was HUGE!  I should have paid more attention to the menu because this monster was more than I expected.....I guess I should have ordered a XL.

I attacked the Burger and the Fatburger taste that I grew up with was still there.  The sharp flavor from the Mustard Relish and the Onions generated an explosion on my taste buds.  The Bacon was a nice addition and the Cheese was gooey and made it just right.  The Skinny Fries were just ok.

Overall, the meal was awesome.....now, this is where it went from 4 Stars to 1 Star.....I went to the restroom to wash up since the Burger was pretty messy.  When I got to the restroom I was appalled at how disgusting it was.  It was worse than a Gas Station Bathroom.  The kicker was when I saw that the paper towels to wipe your hands were on top of the toilet.....what's the point of washing your hands when you're about to wipe it on towels that are contaminated from the toilet?!!!  

See the pics I uploaded for details....you'll notice the brown paper towels sitting on top of the toilet tank and that the spot on the wall where the dispenser is suppose to be mounted has spots where plaster was used to cover up the holes...the hand towels are almost touching the toilet seat!!!  ....someone must have pulled it off the wall....but they're not going to replace it?

I like that you can watch your burger being made. It is like the ultimate in quality assurance watching everything the cook does. I like that the burgers are made fresh. There is a certain quality that you can taste in the freshness.  They do make a good burger. I admit that. My main issue with Fatburger is the price. In what world does it make sense to charge $10.99 for a burger, fries and a Coke at a fast food chain restaurant. I can get more food for the same price at a place like Red Robbin. A crazy price like $10.99 steered me away from the combo so I ended up with just a burger for over $6.00.   I guess I shouldn't complain too much though.

My husband and I came here for a bite and as soon as we walked in we were met with the most unfriendliest, unprofessional hostile cashier ever. The cashier was visibly annoyed and being rude to the customer at the drive thru and then she rang us up with her personality of a door knob self.

She was loud and disrupting the other workers on the grill, which makes sense why my food tasted like crap. I've always received great service at all the Fat-burgers I've been too but this was a disaster. I'd like to know who in the heck hired this crazy person.

The food was sloppy, warm and lacked in taste. It looks like the cook forgot to add salt to the patties. All together this was by far the very worst I've come across at FB and I don't ever want t o come here again. Yikes!!!",5I6-yegWr4p1mtUMwNkVtg,3,0,1,ppOMgGS0T-vl7kW4kkzf7g

There was grease and grime all over the salt and pepper shakers, and the whole place was generally grimy.

The staff is friendly and I think they do their best to try to get your order out as soon as possible. I usually get a Fatburger with mayo, onions, and cheese. The meat is well seasoned and juicy. If you do get the chili cheese fries, you have the option with going for fat fries ( thicker cut fries ) or skinny fries ( thinner cut fries ). I personally like it with the skinny fries because more chilli cheese goodness gets in between the nook and crannies. Not giving it four stars because sometimes the food takes a long time to be ready, so it doesn't make it a good quick lunch/dinner spot if you are short on time.

Nuff said. 

I know a lot of people like In N Out, but I'm going to say it that I have a special spot for Fatburger as the late night choice. I mean a double double animal style is good, but sometimes I just want other options and I like the fries a lot more here. My favorite is the turkey burger  with all toppings or try it with some egg. A plus that burgers come in sizes, sometimes that late I just want a baby burger. 

I didn't know there was even one near me until I drove to Big Dog Draft House. Yay! Looks like we have another late night dinner pick up in the NW, we have very few options past 11pm when we have our night owl schedule.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,5,5,4,xwy9brO-F8eKv7X5PP-B8A

5280986,2016-11-22,2,pCVQq3jzfrT2CNHAIMMy0g,"Perhaps the people at the drive-thru window are not the most engaging at this Fatburger location. Who cares? All their energy and efforts go into making a flavorful, juicy, fat burger. The fat content in this burger is superb -although I don't know the actual percentage of fat. Just know that the burger juice will run down your arm. 

The burgers are dressed with lettuce, tomatoes, onions (ask for grilled), pickles, relish, and mustard. For an additional cost, you can add-on eggs, cheese, bacon, onion rings, or chili. While most fast-food establishments only offer beef burgers, Fatburger has always had turkey burgers on the menu too. They've even included vegetarian patties and glutten-free buns.

The burger sizes range from small to XXXL. For some reason, the small fat is no longer on the drive-thru menu - but it's still available. 

The sides range from onion rings to skinny fries to fat fries and even chili cheese fries. I personally think it's silly for anyone to come to FATburger and get SKINNY fries. My go-to are the fat fries or the onion rings. There's also hand-scooped shakes, but they are not my favorites. Plus, the burger and fries alone will keep you pretty satisfied.

Note: If there is no one else ahead of you, then it will take them approximately 10 minutes to prepare your order.",_pMzR6yoPbU98t-NH8TZ3w,6,4,4,8k0yQDHcojRl8EQfI5Epmg

But my friends' mom sure did, and demanded another patty be made. 
I didn't go back for many years, until after high school, when I decided to try their veggie burger. Which turned out to be nothing but a Boca burger. For basically the same price as a regular one. It is fine that they offer it at all, but do not kid yourself into thinking that makes it ok to act like it is takes just as much time and effort as the meat patties, and therefore should be priced like them.
