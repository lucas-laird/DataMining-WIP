I got the ribs plate which was $9.00 the ribs are excellent & it comes with a side & I ordered the mac n cheese I was really dissapointed with the mac n chz it taste bland & flavor less  & it comes with 1 roll. 
Overall food was good my boyfriend & I both ate for under $20.00 but I like my food really hot & it was slightly warm I don't like that.
Good food
Decent price",hMWX2HUTPcP7a-aFBbv-bg,0,0,3,QMeCVKBobmBLCNfB4Lq_1Q

Not a legit restaurant, about 10-tables, like the Container park location. Perfect for take-out. Staff were friendly and helpful, cook came out to greet us and ask how the food was. Negatives: corn muffins were small (about quarter-sized), rolls were dry, and no lemons for sweet tea.",6Idx4fbm1ZLx4sYFltVwxQ,5,2,4,Yn5Mdz1rcpsYPaNmTCriuA
