9678,2013-10-10,0,eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow,"EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED!!! After being a customer of Rosati's for the past 3 years I've lived in Las Vegas I could not believe the attitude that was received when my roommate and I tried to order delivery this evening (because my roommate is very pregnant she had ordered and gotten delivery to our home last night) upon calling and then getting shot down we tried the other location an we're told that the Cheyenne location would deliver to us. After trying to call again the manager, who seemed to be completely inept, told us that the person who took our order shouldn't have done that.

 I do not believe the improper training of employees by management should be taken out on the customer. Coming from a house that is filled with people who work in the food industry, and know what it is the give a little extra for loyal customers, especially when it was your fault..we were pretty upset. 

The order we had was no small one either..they have lost us as customers and we will no longer refer our friends and family to these restaurants!",o1q2UIh1mCh2btDQ1APovg,5,1,1,CF5oEMDIXE2cqhaqcAZfIg
43527,2014-07-13,0,eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow,Hi I would just like to let everyone know that this pizza place has the worst customer service I have ever had the pleasure if experiencing. So I ordered over 100 dollars of food and was told that it would be to my house (which is 0.25 miles away I might add ) in 45 minutes to 1 hour. Ok that's cool it's a lot of food. So after 2 hours went by I called them and asked them what was going on they said sorry and the good was on it way. So another 30 minutes went by and still no food. Mind you I live a quarter mile away. So I called again and told them to cancel the order and the manager told me to just keep the food no charge. So I tipped the driver twenty bucks and started to feed my family. So I got a call back twenty minutes later that they changed there mind they wanted thee food back. So they sent the driver back to our house took the food and kept my twenty dollars I tipped him. So I had ate a few pieces of pizza and my family did too as anyone would being told to just keep the food no charge.  So they sent the driver back again and demanded money for the food and did not wAnt to give me the old food back. So all and all they wanted me to pay them for food that took almost three hours to get to my home a quarter mile away and after they had told me to keep it and without givin me anything back in return they demanded money from me and called the cops and were told they were in the wrong and now I called tonight and that told me they would not take my order and to never call back they will not serve me. So BEWARE of this place they will try to get you and they keep track of your number and in my opinion would bet that they tamper with your food if you have ever stiffed them on a tip or anything else. That is strictly my opinion and I have no factual prof that that ever happens. Strictly my opinion. So again BEWARE.  if you have read this far thank u for listing and sorry it was so long just wanted people to know what they are getting. Thanks,IltX8x24PPUwcf4dnvjnrQ,0,0,1,ORCFe7FP_9E2dUyYBnl_Rg

When I called to inform them that the order was incorrect they told me all they could do is remake the pizza and that I would have to bring the pizza ( that had already had a slice removed) back and wait 30 min for them to make another. The girl behind the register told me that they can't give me a discount or any type if reimbursement for my troubles. This coming from a chain that has coupons attached to every pizza.  I waited for half an hour in there restaurant and they didn't offer me a soda and they were content that they might loose a good customer . Word to the wise they charged me .90 to put onions on half of the pizza that came with onions. I'm not sure what happened to the quality and service at this location but it sucks.  I am no longer spending money here. Ordered a classic combo and got a cheese pizza with half onions only.,DxaBxzE4KNdKIoxu6g9wEA,3,1,1,vIeQv6pz_NFmVlsvpnjQBA
291898,2013-08-26,1,eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow,"I am from Cali originally and never really had Chicago Style Pizza until this year. A good friend of mine is from Chicago and when he moved here we started trying different places. And I discovered Chicago-Style Food! 

Now typically, I love thin crust pizza, not big on even eating the crust unless its stuffed with cheese...however I was craving a ridic amount of cheese and marinara... So a friend and I decided to call in and place an order for Carry-Out...

We got a large Chicago-Style with Pepperoni, beef, and green peppers. We also ordered the combo platter appetizer. And who can forget the Cannoli!! 

When we brought the food home, it smelt delish! The pizza was huge and really delicious! It could have been a little hotter, they told us 35 for pick up and maybe we waited 45? Either way, it was really good! 

The app was great also, stuffed mushrooms and onion rings, mozzarella strips, jalape√±o poppers, and their ranch is very good! My faves were the onion rings and stuffed mushrooms, so good!

Another new thing for me? Cannoli! But since my first Cannoli a few months back, I've been trying them everywhere! This one was VERY good! Little bits of pistachios in the filling, yum!

I am pleased with the order we made, their timeliness.. And the food was great! I would definitely go back!


For those that state the wait is too long when visiting, read the menu thoroughly! Things are made to order and it clearly states ""please expect another 15 min for cooking"" or something along those lines!

674261,2013-07-08,0,eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow,"Needed pizza/wanted pizza!!

We ordered a full order of chicken strips, medium heat with ranch dressing on the side and a pizza.  When we got home the pizza was perfect, but the chicken strips had no seasoning at all and the ranch dressing was missing.  Too far to go back, so we just dealt with it.  We should not have to just deal with it.  

This location is extremely small (approximately 6-8 tables) and there were only two couples in the restaurant at the time, so busy would not be a possible excuse.  I saw five uniformed employees and one individual with an outfit that would suggest he was a manager.  So, there was more than enough staff to remember something as simple as ranch dressing and seasoning on chicken strips.

Don't get me wrong I do like Rosati's A LOT - however, it is so frustrating when you do not receive what you ordered and you didn't check before leaving the restaurant because you assume seasoning and ranch dressing isn't so difficult to remember.  

We have never got takeout at Rosati's, we typically go to the one up North off of Durango.  So, next time we want pizza, we'll have to go and eat at the restaurant as it seems the West Cheyenne location can't manage to fully and/or correctly prepare a takeout order.",cb3Kw-8qicrTInl_cyAaNw,0,0,2,1W_0wc575_kWdcztX36OJw

1488737,2011-04-06,0,eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow,"Rosati's pizza is the business as far as pizza and wings are concerned! I know quite a few people have left negative reviews regarding Rosati's, but I would be hard pressed to take the nay-sayer's word for it for a few reasons: One, some one commented that they waited 20 minutes just for drinks- Well, if you did, that would be because the drink fountains outsmarted you.. O_O Here is the low on how Rosati's works- It's like a combination between ""serve yourself"" and ""full service"". The drink fountain is right next to where you grab straws, forks, napkins, etc.  So, you take your cup, fill, enjoy, rinse and repeat. It would be the equivalent of waiting 20 minutes for drinks at Panda Express. (On a side note, I'm not intentionally being rude, there may be extenuating circumstances that preventeed the drink pourage, just putting a realistic timeline out there showing it's not the norm to wait for anything while there.) Most of the kids working there are just that: Kids.  You don't go to Pizza Hut expecting 5 star service, just as you wouldn't go there expecting a host in a tux to seat you. With that said, let's move on to the current review!! =)

Food: The portions are GINORMOUS! For the lunch Slice special, you get what amounts to a quarter of an entire pizza and drink for $3! The crust is made fresh there, and my personal favorite is the Cheese slice with all the herbs and garlic sprinkled in and on. Also on Tuesdays they have 50 cent wings, but not those dinky little wings you get from most places. These are CHICKEN WINGS! lol, about twice the size of a normal wing. I would be afraid to be in a dark alley with the chicken these wings came from; He apparently hit the gym often. And the sauces are DELICIOUS! My fave sauces are the mild and the honey bbq. And the homemade Spumoni ice cream is a MUST!

Service: I usually only go during lunch since my office is nearby, so I only know 2 of the girls there and they have always been completely awesome to me. I am a friendly person by nature and I have been known to become ""BFF"" with random people buying Ketchup (long story), so I am inclined to think every one is a sweetheart. That being said, my coworkers are a different story, but they also agree that the girls there are so accommodating and nice! A good example of that would be from today. My coworker wanted to try their 50 cent wings, but didn't know which of the 6 flavors she would like, so she actually ordered ONE OF EACH FLAVOR! lol, Yes, you read right, she ordered one chicken wing in each of the 6 flavors. While also ordering some ""custom"" fries. (We didn't care for the Cheese fries with the cheese sauce on them, so she asked for Pizza Fries- fries with the pizza sauce and mozzarella baked on. She's also had them take fries and put mozzarella and cheddar and bake them too.) The thing is, they never complained, never said ""We can't do that"", or anything! They have always humored all of her crazy whims and ideas, and made whatever she wanted with a smile! They are always so friendly and sweet, always happy to be of service and go the extra mile! The girl with the piercings is especially nice!  There have been times where i have seen people ask what something tastes like, and rather than just explain an abstract, she has been known to give them freebies to try, even to the point of giving an entire dessert free for some one to try. Try doing that some where else and see if they will give you a free cheesecake to sample, or accept making 6 wings each in a different sauce. Customer service like that unfortunately just doesn't happen every day, especially at a ""fast food"" joint.

Prices: The prices can vary. Like I said, you can get an entire quarter of a pizza and drink for $3, or you can buy a 15lb pizza (I swear they really do weigh that much!) for anywhere between $12-$20. Some of the pizzas can be expensive depending on the toppings and crust, but they are SOOOOO filling! My son can eat his weight in pizza (Read: he can eat half a large pizza from Pizza Hut in one setting) yet he was STUFFED after just one slice of a Rosati's pizza, so the price more than justifies itself. Plus, once you get to know them, they will go out of their way to find coupons and discounts for you. =)

Overall, in my opinion, Rosati's is the only chain pizza joint I'll eat at any more; on a scale of 1 to 5, they definitely get 5 Nomnoms from me!",wPvp7ok3vK43HRE4Y930LA,3,1,5,GbXfYTDMuvDILiuFmcJAqA
1512328,2009-03-10,4,eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow,"Okay, Let me just say....I'm not sure if it was food poisoning, or I coincidentally came down with a stomach bug 4 hours after eating their pizza.....but after my 36 hour adventure with my toilet and the bathroom floor, I can't say I'm willing to give this place another shot....not to mention the pizza really wasn't even worth my misery.

So, the pizza itself. I got the spinach trio (comes with spinach, tomato and feta cheese). It was a thin crust pizza, and there was waaaaaayyyyyyy too much mozzarella on this thing. The cheese was at least 1/4 inch think. This wouldn't be a problem it it was on an appropriate thickness crust. The poor thin crust just couldn't hold up all that cheese and was floppy and soggy. The was also a strange smokey flavor to the pizza, which I just don't get. Plus, there was hardly any spinach at all on the pizza.

After checking on the web for their phone number - supposedly the only Rosati's in Nevada - I ended up calling the wrong location. Apparently, there is Rosatis.com and MyRosatis.com.  I don't know what the distinction is, the logo is the same - maybe franchises vs. company owned?  At any rate - for any location other than D.I. and Hualapai, you need to use MyRosatis.com.  It doesn't help that the location I was looking for was at Cheyenne and Hualapai - soooo confusing.

OK - I admit, I'm not from Chicago - so maybe I just don't ""get"" Chicago style pizza, but what is up with square-cutting a round thin crust? This way, the center pieces don't have a crunchy crust to cheesy-dough ratio that makes pizza enjoyable to me. If it were a square pan or deep-dish it would make sense. The pizza tasted OK - I found the crust a bit flavorless.  I dunno - it's fine I suppose, but for the price (18.00 for a 14"" veggie) I'd rather go elsewhere.

They had several lunch specials, one was a slice of pizza and a drink, for a little more you get two slices with the drink, I think it was $7.40 with tax (that included a up sale of 50 cents per slice to add pepperoni) . So I got my drink and sat down. Soon the girl from the counter came with two plates, I assumed one was for someone else, but no they were both for me. Apparently the special meant large slices, so it's actually two normal slices per slice, so I have 4 slices of pizza. The single slice, which would have been two slices, would have been plenty, I try not to eat a large meal during the hot weather, it makes me sleepy after lunch.

The pizza was good.
The crust, crisp on the outside, chewy inside and a good taste to it.
The sauce, lite on the sauce, which I like, nice taste, not bland or over powering.
The cheese, a good grade of mozzarella and a good portion of it.
The pepperoni. good and it was between layers of the cheese. Layer of cheese, pepperoni, another layer of cheese. You don't have the little pepperoni cups of oil on top and not a noticeable amount of oil trapped between the cheese layers.

As a new Las Vegas resident, it's been my task to find decent pizza and Rosati's brings the flavor and quality of those small Chicagoland pizzarias to the Las Vegas area.  Delivery service usually takes an hour, but the hour is well worth it as pizzas are delivered hot and well-made.  The buffalo wings are delicious and mozzarella sticks are good.  

Rosati's thin-crust pizza is delicious and exactly as it's made in Chicago.  The cheese is delicious and the italian sausage is flavorful and slightly spicy.  

Rosati's deep-dish is great with chunks of tomato in the sauce.

Their pan pizza is very similar to Chicago-style pans.  My only complaint is that the crust could use some additional flavor, maybe a more buttery consistency. 

Overall, I've used this Rosati's for delivery 32 times since I discovered it in March 2011.  Excellent food quality and fair delivery times.",r6Ldqx2K7H973hRjhhR3NA,1,1,5,7T6jrP2wLqaydbmJZdCR6w

Good thing we got there when we did or else  our pizza would have been sitting for another 5  minutes. The pizza itself looked like a drunk person made it. It was cut into huge squares instead of the neatly cut smaller squares that is normally is. That I could live with, however the crust was covered in what seemed like one gallon of pizza sauce making it unbearably soggy because the pizza didn't cook all the way through in the middle. My fiance noticed that they had changed the quality of their sausage from the old good quality authentic, to some new gross bad quality meat.

3773618,2011-05-19,2,eRjcli4nDHRwhByViUz9Ow,"I'm not a Las Vegas local, and on my trip there last night, a well-meaning acquaintance sent me out to Summerlin to find an old bookshop manned by geezers.  I couldn't find the place (erroneous address, incomplete directions), and I ended up somewhat lost, a little cold, and very, very hungry.  So I fired up the heater in the rental car, Yelped nearby businesses with my smartphone, and ended up deciding to hit Rosati's pizza.  After all, the rating was a solid 4 stars.

 Rosati's is located on what seems to be a major road through Summerlin, and its clientele are pleasingly non-threatening family types of a few different colors who have the air of regulars.  The girl behind the counter was friendly, nice, & helpful.  The restaurant is clean, and even the cooks had pretty immaculate aprons.  I wasn't scared that I was risking any sort of injury or illness or cockroach sightings by being there (which is more than I can say for my sojourn @ the Excalibur Hotel on the Strip, but I digress).  Further, it seems to have won a reader's poll for Best Pizza in Las Vegas Weekly.  So, I ordered pizza, right?  Nope.  I ordered a calzone, which is basically a pizza folded in half with toppings as stuffings.   

 And when I write ""a pizza folded in half with toppings as stuffings,"" that's exactly what I mean.  After ordering a Spinach Calzone and only finishing a little less than half of it, I the counter girl told me that at Rosati's their calzones are made with a MEDIUM-SIZED PIZZA DOUGH and stuffed accordingly.  I write this not to criticize, but to warn you that you're not going to be getting what I expected, which was a sanely-portioned calzone that would satisfy one person who wasn't entering an eating competition.  It arrived huger than my plate, with pizza sauce on the side as a garnish, and was probably stuffed with at least three pounds of cheese.  I am not joking.  I really do think it was three pounds of cheese.

 As far as taste, I'd have to rate the calzone as way too salty to be truly enjoyable.  My favorite part of it was the closure part of the dough, which was the only part that didn't go from salty crust into salty cheese and (how the heck did this happen?) salty spinach.  I'm a huge fan of doughy things, which most calzones supply very well, but this one only featured in the cute, braided-looking closure.  

 But did that stop me from eating half of the monstrously-sized calzone?  No, it did not.  Yes, I ate a pound and a half of cheese, some dough, and some saline spinach.  And I enjoyed the cheese and the dough--the spinach threw me with its brackishness.  The aggressively salted dough plus the (salty) cheese needed a some sort of plain foil to neutralize their pungency.  The pizza sauce didn't help matters.  Though a little sweet, of course it was also salty too, and, rather unfortunately reminded me of something from a jar from before grocery stores offered pasta & pizza sauces that were actually something  you'd want on your pizza or pasta.

 If I'm making this sound awful, it really wasn't.  I wouldn't have eaten so much, plus taken the rest home and eaten a large part of the remnants for breakfast.  Plus, somehow I remain convinced that, if I'd gotten this combo on a pizza, and not in a calzone, it would have tasted better.  For one thing, much less surface of the dough looking like it needs seasoning, since most of a pizza crust is covered in sauce and toppings.  I almost wonder if the cooks thought ""Well, it looks so bare.  What do we have?  Salt!  That tastes good with everything!""

 [And I came home today and got what I thought would be a taco but turned out to be a glorified quesadilla from a local Mexican place that I'll also be giving a definite 2 stars.  Oy.  I don't know if I ever want to eat cheese again!]

 I wish I could give this place 3 stars for the friendly service and nice ambiance, but the saline spinach knocked it down at least a half point.  And there're no 2 1/2-star ratings on Yelp.  But, if I'm ever lost & hungry in Summerlin again, I might go there, and try the pizza, just to see if I'm right about my hunch, and if I agree with the palates of the readers of Las Vegas Weekly.",uX-B3JGMuc8B4pdqvq8zWg,0,0,2,GuEuTGu-69S_lqQfIYkVAw

Came in on a Sunday (very slow)  with my Groupon. First off, the gal helping us must have not liked us, because it was showing.  

Ordered the Chicago deep dish, which is the only reason we came here. Having been to Rosati's in Encinitas we expected good pizza from here.  We weren't expecting Echo Park's Masa, but Rosati's status....

The sauce was good flavor and good amount of tomatoes.  The quality of the cheese and pepperonis was also good.  The bad was there was hardly any cheese and pepperoni on this pizza.  I mean at least say ""hey if you want normal amount, we have to charge you extra.""  I would have paid more.  That doesn't matter anyway I guess because the pizza crust bottom, and sides was disgusting.  I say disgusting, I mean hard, thin, crunchy, gross.  I felt like I had the $1.00 pizza from the freezer aisle.  We knew we would never come back.  

We also had the boneless wings and side salad.  It was whatever.  This place had no problem serving us a skimpy, gross pizza and charging us for 2 additional sides of ranch.  The iced tea (unsweetened) is also not good, it tastes dirty. 

Less than a car ride to the house, my son and I became very ill.  We had to stop and purchase alka seltzer and water.  I have never become sick from a food place, and I am not someone that calls out food poisoning ever on my YELP reviews, but this is the closest thing I have to call it.  We narrowed it down to the wings or ranch.  There were 4 of us in the party and 2 became sick.  One of the people in our group didn't eat any ranch, or wings.  

I wouldn't come back even if I didn't leave feeling like I had to barf, because the pizza sucks.  

I did find that there is a Chicago deep dish pizza at Giordanna's on the strip.  The strip is not my first choice for a pizza place, but I would take that over illness any day.

We got the Chicago style 14 inch and it was cooked perfectly! Not too much sauce. Perfect amount of cheese. Crust was a little more cooked than normal, but I think that was to ensure it could sustain the sauces on top of the crust. Left a happy customer!",D24ACBBOSw2j4u9-9Mtshw,0,0,5,xkyVPkFhLjZt9DgliFKmxw

The pizza was piping hot and came with a generous amount of toppings, although I think the prep table applied too much cheese and less sauce to the center of the pie.  The sauce was savory with the right balance of spices.

In light of Michelle W's previous review, I'm inclined to give this location 4 stars instead of 5.  My rating may change if the consistency and quality continues to be above board with future orders.",BJi8obH6QLPlHWFIvbCG5g,0,0,4,RGLHw6WO-zepxBtTzVJHQw

This time we dined in for happy hour and I was very disappointed. I had received a flyer about their happy 10"" pizza for $6. The server didn't know about that special and apparently the manager didn't either because he made her show him the flyer I brought with me. We ordered onion rings, a fried dough appetizer served with marinara, and the pizza. The onion rings were great. The fried dough appetizer was terrible.  We were expecting something similar to garlic knots. That's how they were described on the menu. We each ate only one and they had given us a huge serving. When it came time to leave we asked for a box for the pizza. The server asked if we wanted to take the dough things and I told her we didn't like them at all. I'm pretty sure she tried to get the manager to take them off the check. They weren't and we paid for them. I won't be back. And being in the restaurant business myself I can tell you a $4.50 item on the check is not worth losing someone as a customer. It looks like a lot of people feel the same way because we only saw one other person in the restaurant while we were there. Also the restaurant was freezing and smelled strongly of cleaning chemicals. Not a good dining experience and I don't recommend their pizza.",seJ0TkpmtiGjOtImh5zQZg,1,0,2,wZs_1v8GkrZSp9qplswJwA

We got both the Chicago Style deep and the thin crust.

The sauce is a bit sweet, but overall very good.  The Deep dish has a good ratio of ingredients and is quite good.  The crust has a nice buttery taste from the pan.  

The thin crust is nice and crisp - a bit thin for me, but it was well liked.  

The fried Mushrooms are great - have them with the ranch dressing.  MMMMM good.

The beer was cold and the selection was good.  Several  TVs to watch sports on and they don't mind changing the channel.

Garlicky, yet not greasy, small, almost french fry size but light and crispy.  We got an antipaasti salad which wasn't very creative but was delicious.  I should have stopped there.  Salad and breadsticks would have filled me up but we came for the deep dish.  My wife mistakenly ordered the medium deep dish.  Having had Chicago Pizza at its birthplace in Chicago (Gino's or Giordanos??? another time.), I was certain a medium would be about the size of a normal plate and deep.  Instead it was about the size of a large flat crust pizza except deep!  The crust was perfectly crisp and the dough light.There was a lot of flavor and not a lot of grease which is good for a deep dish.  The dining area is small but the Pizza worth the wait.

Ok, we aren't done yet, my daughter wanted pasta so we got her Penne (knock knock Penne, Knock Knock Penne).  Another truck arrived at our table and delivered a trough full of delicious pasta.  They will alter the dish as my daughter wanted melted mozzerella on top. They happily obliged.

So, we carted home 1/2 a salad, 6/8 of a pizza and 2/3 of the pasta for lunch and dinner for the rest of the week.   Did I mention that with drinks the whole meal for three cost $49.00. 

Why not five stars?  Well the atmosphere is not the greatest, the place is small and they don't have as many topping choices as I would like.  But if you are craving good pizza and pasta that won't break the wallet, this is the place to go.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,2,4,4,fCu1XkUjJltlvSYwHPzXVg

The pizza itself was decent. I remembered the Centennial deep dish to be bigger and deeper though. The pizza was drowned in their tomato sauce. It cancels out the cheesiness and the toppings. I think it drowns the rest of the taste actually. I still ate it because I thought it was alright.

The buttery flaky crust and the gooey mozzarella cheese are delicious!  However, I am a carnivore and need more to satisfy my deep dish cravings, such as pepperoni and sausage.  And that is what I ordered, along with mushrooms to top this delectable dish.  But, I was a bit disappointed with the amount of toppings.  When using my fork and knife to dig in to my deep dish, I like every single bite to include some meat toppings to accompany the chunky pomodora tomatoes and delicious cheese, and that was not happening with this order because the pepperoni and sausage were a bit scarce to my liking.  

I placed a ""carry out"" order so can't say much for the service, but the 2 girls at the counter were friendly, and the quaint restaurant was filled with families.  So, until I find a deep dish comparable to Chicago's Uno's, I will be back, especially for their freshly made ranch dressing, which you can buy by the jar!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,1,1,3,xPpKpHITUChLclm8R7CA3Q
