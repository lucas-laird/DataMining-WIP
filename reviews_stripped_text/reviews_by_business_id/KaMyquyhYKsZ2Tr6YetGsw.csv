1008137,2018-01-01,0,KaMyquyhYKsZ2Tr6YetGsw,I literally downloaded the yelp app to make this review. I see all these 1 star reviews and got to speak up myself. I'm a pilot out of Mcarren airport down the street and I'm always getting off work after everything else is closed (even other Taco Bell locations) but not this one. I often roll up at 1-2am after a long day and starving. Although they only have one person running the store this late the service is always fast and my food has always been hot and fresh tasting. Not only that but the employees have always been exceptionally happy for that late at night. Been going here weekly for the last 3 years and i have not had a bad experience yet. And I'm sure il be back in the middle of the night in the future.,nHDkKspizMnAzmVfumJEmw,0,0,5,9cYAkTjyXRXMMPHXDMmljg

The young guy at the window seemed stressed.  Perhaps he was new, overly anxious, and/or under trained.  Management at any meaningful level was completely absent that evening.  They really should have closed early that evening.  

A lot of homeless people hang out here if their presence bothers you for whatever reason.

It's older, it's grungier, the drive-thru takes longer, etc. But they serve the same food as all other TBs. So yeah, it's a perfectly fine TB and will certainly satisfy your late night drunken cravings for some cheap tacos.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,0,1,3,2Bu3hrgELwMs2Ot_ptdP4g

She was such a sweetheart and it's hard finding that now a days. Coming across people that can stay in a bubbly mood at 2am even after a long shift definitely says something about that person's character. Such a genuine person and if you have the opportunity to be served by her, consider yourself lucky!",GE6Amb4sSvxvjxvv_vvKPg,2,3,5,Op-ClHjSiM50CBqqTg4RbA
2778868,2014-04-12,6,KaMyquyhYKsZ2Tr6YetGsw,"Doing this review based on their new breakfast item, the ""Waffle Taco"".

Saw the commercial for it so I decided to try it the next morning at the drive thru. It's a waffle shaped like a taco with scrambled eggs and your choice of sausage or bacon. I chose bacon.

I should of chose hunger. If you refer to my pic, it actually looks decent but looks can be deceiving. Dont expect the waffle to be crispy like they just actually toasted it or made fresh from scratch. It is obviously microwaved because it is already soggy when you get it. They give you a tiny container of syrup. You know, the kind of container you would dip nuggets in if you were at McDonalds. I guess you are supposed to either dip your ""Taco"" in it or just pour it on top. Mind you I actually parked in theTB parking lot so I dont make a mess. You definitely dont wanna be driving while eating this thing. So I pour the syrup into my taco. It had the consistency of watered down cough syrup. The taste? Ha, Robitussin tasted way better and I hate that stuff! This syrup tasted like actual tree sap. As for the bacon bits, you know how you can get imitation bacon bits at the supermarket? Well, they imitated an imitation. So what it tastes like is comparable to those knock off perfume and cologne bottles that random people sell in random parking lots. The ones that kind of smell like the real thing but only lasts like 2 minutes. The bacon bits on these things were basically red construction paper dipped in bacon grease and shredded.

I only ate half of it and was surprised I even ate that much. I guess I didnt want to face the fact that I lost good hard earned money for it? I kid you not, I coudnt wait til lunch came around so I can dump a lot of hot sauce in whatever I will eat in order to kill any remnants of that garbage I just ate. Makes me wonder if they test these things on animals. Good God, I just realized that we are the animals! 

This is not the first time I fell for their marketing gimmicks. Lets see, there was the Cantina Bowl, XL Steak Nachos, and the XXXL Steak Flatbread thing. All these were total fails. I guess the only person I can blame is myself because I keep thinking that maybe they will make a mistake somewhere along the line and use actual ingredients. Then they will be scratching their heads why all of a sudden people are lining up by the truckloads.

So in closing, I gave two stars because the only thing that I will ever have hope for is the Mexican Pizza. That has never let me down before and even if it does, the percentage of it making me sick is very low. Maybe because my stomach has grown tolerant of it? Gahh, that sounds scary. Notice I never mentioned the service. Fyi, I have yet to find one worthy of mentioning and this location is no different. Memo to TB corporate, stop smoking that weed and try real ingredients. At least put some of that weed in your product so we think its good when we are just actually hallucinating. Plus you get the munchies when you are high which in turn will help sell you more tacos. And no, I dont do weed. Well not voluntarily anyway. Sometimes you smell secondhand weed smoke and you get the munchies as well. I gotta go now for I think the DEA is knocking at my door.

So I stand  at the counter with the cup waiting. It was quite awkward and frustrating to watch all the employees dancing around in front of me (literally) and looking at me while as I  waited to ask to get a drink. So I went behind the guy ordering and waited in line again to get someone's attention. They realized that both machines weren't working for Dr. Pepper. After 5 minutes, they handed me a large drink and it was a combination of Fanta, Coke and maybe some Dr.Pepper. It was gross and of course the Fritos in my burrito were stale.
