It was by far the most memorable meal of our Vegas adventure. I lived in Japan for three years and make curry rice at home quite often.  This was the real deal; spicy, flavorful Japanese-style curry with several interesting additions.  I tried the tacoyaki appetizer and it was great.
Highly recommended, especially if you've never had Japanese curry before.",XmAjt20HjQD8_CuV0eE4YA,0,0,5,r60uO4YOLw1-6CvA6l_TXQ

They have different spice levels for the curry as well. I got level 5 spice and it was a bearable medium spiciness. If you like eating flaming hot cheetos (my reference for tolerable spiciness level lol), you could probably go a little spicier.

Get cheese in your curry and you won't regret it! They even have some tsukemono, all you have to do is ask for some!",qrTVWMqSafe5X8FJYE1eqg,0,0,5,PYjJ9Ip7R5UF2HVpXluq-g

202358,2014-02-21,1,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"I did not know Japanese Curry existed. Here's what happened: about 150 years ago the British started bringing Indian spices into Japan, Japan liked his they tasted and local families started making their own recipes. So what happens at Zen is that you get a family recipe. It's a unique blend of healthy spices (listed on a small menu - together with their benefits).

Ok so here's how it works: what you see on the illustrated menu is exactly what you get.- with the added value of taste buds awesomeness. No frills, no fancy decoration. Rice is white, curry is brown. Flavor is insane.

I tried a handful of ""hotness"" options and have to say that the hottest is totally bearable. They use different varieties of chili to obtain heat throughout the scale and a nice amount of Habanero in their hottest sauces (hence the redder coloration). Perfect blend and amount. Never too much - always enough to feel it and love it.

Now - I'm not the type who goes out for dinner seeking an ambience, I don't care. I want my joints to be clean and mainly I want them to provide a fantastic food experience. Zen is pretty straight forward: don't pick this place if you're trying to impress a date with fancy stuff, maybe try Chinese at the Bellagio's Jasmine. 

Lights are bright at Zen, bill is super reasonable, staff is awesome, chef is great and food tastes better than a wish.

Since mouthful #1 I would have kept going, going, going....

Loved it!

208524,2015-08-10,0,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"Addicting. Consistent every time. Delicious.

I have been to this place no less than thirty times. It's odd that curry-gravy could have such an effect on me, but this place stays on my mind. 

It's so simple: choice of meat, white or brown rice, and curry sauce. And yet, it's so much more. 

The breading on the Chicken Tender is crispy and perfect every time. I've had the Katsu and grilled chicken as well, also great. The rice is standard, though I am impressed that their brown rice is just as soft and easy to eat as the regular white rice. Not all restaurants have the capability or knowledge to do this, and its evident that brown rice is often the more ""challenging"" of the two. Not here.

The curry sauce is to die for. It's as mild or spicy as you choose, and I love that I can choose. It is more of a gravy consistency, which is very different from the thinner Indian or Thai curries. The taste isn't for everyone though. I happen to be half Middle Eastern and grew up on my grandmother's afterschool curry, so I welcome the heat and the spices. Also, I'm not a fan of dark-meat chicken, so the Chicken Tender option was made for me.

The toppings are fun too. There are little jars on the tables with things like pickled radish (red), pearl onions (white), sliced almonds, and raisins. I was a little hesitant to throw these on my curry at first, but the flavors are so mild and add a brightness and a fresh element to the rich curry. Still won't do the raisins, but everything else is a must for me.

The service is standard for a Japanese restaurant. Every employee greets you when you come in, and thanks you when you leave. My favorite server is Misaki, as she remembers me every time, always has a great attitude, and is the most personable of all.

I will be back in the foreseeable future, like probably twice this week.",xAGAy6XHcRjkDz_dQKkguA,1,0,5,mmxsPx1Sjepe64zjEizdMg

The curry tasted as if it were home made and I suspect it is, unlike other places in town which openly state that they use a curry base that I could easily buy at the store and make myself (i.e. the curry place in the food court adjacent to Clark County community college). There was a lot of curry sauce which I like to sop up with my rice. You can get different levels of heat 1-10, everything about a 5 though there is a surcharge for. I asked for level 5 and it was a little hotter than I would have preferred but that's what i get for asking for a 5. I assumed that as Japanese food is generally not known for heat a level 5 would be about a level 2 in a thai food place but I was wrong. It was still really good and whew... my sinuses are cleared at the moment. I also liked that they give you condiments, I love condiments, they provided pickled radish which was not too heavy on the vinegar and had a really good flavor, onions that had a little beat of heat, almonds, and raisins. Also, tonkatsu sauce and extra hot chili powder. Taking another yelpers suggestion I tried the almonds which added a nice crunchiness and texture to the dish. 

That is what I like to see a restaurant that has a relatively simple menu but does it well. If anyone has seen Jiro Dreams of Sushi, then they would understand you do one thing and you do it well and you always strive to do better - and if you haven't seen it definitely a must see. 

The dining room was small but modern and clean. Upbeat vibe. I would recommend for anyone who is up for some curry. In fact with so many great places to choose in the shopping center where Japanese Curry Zen is located there is no way to go wrong!",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,2,0,5,x3kNqCdQs9ECXMy1oPuizw
647906,2016-01-14,0,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"The biggest thing I miss about living in Japan is access to really good curry rice, and Zen's is by far the best I've found this side of the Pacific. The other things on the menu are okay, but the reason to come here is a big plate of curry rice.

Some tips if you're new to Japanese curry rice:
- Don't use chopsticks. In Japan it's always eaten with a spoon. Plus it's impossible to get enough of the delicious rich curry sauce with chopsticks.
- Get a topping. Tonkatsu (pork cutlet) is traditional, but I love the chicken katsu. Try to get a bit of rice, curry sauce, and topping in every spoonful.
- Add a spicy level. The base sauce is complex and tasty, but even a level 1-2 spicy (out of ten) adds more depth without much heat. (If it helps to calibrate, it takes a level 5 spicy to get my nose running.) 

It's super busy right at the lunch and dinner hour, but has immediate seating the rest of the time. (If you have to wait, stop by Kung Fu Tea next door.)

923842,2015-01-07,0,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"I have a new favorite curry place and this is it!  The Curry House restaurants in Orange County and Torrance had been my previous favorites, but this place just kicks it up a notch. While getting a foot massage next door I looked on yelp to find something good for dinner, and the reviews convinced me to try it. 

After going back and forth about what to try, I saw the food delivered to the table next to me and just had to ask for exactly the same thing. The gentleman said it was double chicken katsu curry with sausage and corn, and I'll be damned if it wasn't every bit as awesome as he said, but more on that later. To get started we had the edamame which was perfectly steamed and topped with the large sea salt crystals that were a great flavor addition without being too salty. We also had the gyoza which were good, but not particularly remarkable in any way. In hind sight I should not have ordered the appetizers because I would soon be stuffed beyond capacity and feeling like an overfilled water balloon! 

When the meal came the chicken was super moist and tender, with super flakey and crispy breading that blew away my expectations. The rice was perfectly done and sticky like it should be, mixing nicely with the curry. The corn was served beside the rice in a little pile, just begging to be mixed in, and the sausage looked like hotdogs but certainly didn't taste that way- more like a Polska Kielbasa with great flavor. The guy next to me sliced everything up and mixed it together, so when in Rome...well you know. Anyway, to make a long review even longer, I will add that the curry had excellent flavor and really brought the whole thing together nicely.  It was so good I think the only thing that could have made it better was getting it for free- actually, I am in town on business so I guess that means it was free after-all!  Guess I should go buy a lottery ticket now, cause I feel like I hit the jackpot with Curry House Zen tonight!",v4rcYE7PnWch56zrGlmWYw,1,0,5,TIhJ4unHshIVk0-GGM7DNw
953841,2014-03-12,2,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"I went with a group of 10 so I called the restaurant to make reservations. When I called Zen answered and said his restaurant only holds 18 people at a time. My answer? 8 more than we needed :)

At first menu glance all we see is deep fried. Unfortunate.  Low and behold we see a beef and sausage dish and after speaking to the server found out they made a grilled chicken too. Recommended. 

Funny note. Picture of beef showed 4 pieces. We asked the server if the picture was accurate and he said there was actually 6 pieces. We were server 5.  Um ya. The server came back later with two more pieces.  

The chicken katsu was good. Lots of rice with each dish. Don't order a side of corn as its about 2 tablespoons at most really? Give me the whole damn can! Lol 

My favorite was the spinach. Go figure. Perfectly cooked. Right tenderness and not soggy. The mix it right in the curry. 

The confusing part was the spice level. Regular was 1-5. Then they had a blazing option at 6-10.  I was told medium was between 1-5 so I ordered a 2.5 to be funny but the server wasn't amused. But smiled  :). Other friends had a 5 and I could barely tell the difference. We didn't order any 'blazing's so I could compare. 

The owner came out again to greet us all after we finished and was very sweet. Tried to explain the difference in spice levels but I was already in a rice/ food coma. 

The extra star to make it a 4 was their spice mix they leave on the table. I sprinkled it on my wrist prior to ordering and was in love. I added this to all my 'shared' plates.

This place is a bit small so if you if plan on coming with a group of 3+ there might be a bit of a wait during rush hour times. The bar is better suited to single eaters or 2-people groups. Still a fun, casual dining experience.

If you're doing curry, this place is a delicious choice! I ordered the base curry pork katsu ($9.45), with sausage ($2.50), corn ($0.50), and a spicyness level ($0.20). The pork katsu was perfectly crisp without being dry meat on the inside. Sausage was flavorful. Curry itself had depth and didn't taste like it came out of a box. Along with curry bread ($2), we couldn't get enough! Curry bread tastes like crack, but with curry and whatever magic is in there to make me salivate. Think pastry without the sugar and all savory goodness.

Prices are okay. You can see how it runs up pretty quickly per person. They charge quite a bit for toppings. $2.50 for three tiny sausages? Base curry is just rice with sauce and a little bit of meat all for $8-$10ish and you're still expected to get toppings? It'd be a pretty plain curry otherwise. Not as cheap as pho, but it's still pretty savory and a nice change of pace. After all the add-ons between my boyfriend and I, the bill came out to be $35ish.

Not exactly cheap for what you get, but hits the spot! Good place for a casual date night or hang-out with friends! We both left feeling pleasantly satisfied. You know food is wonderful and delectable when it stays with you on the ride home. (Well, obviously, because you just ate it.)

I was skeptical of all the positive reviews--after all, curry is curry, and I've had my fair share of it. However, I'm pleased to say this place really hits the spot. Small, cramped, cozy, and warm, Japanese Curry Zen instantly impresses with soft sticky rice, a generous portion of addicting curry sauce, and a huge selection of meats.

First off, the curry is spicy! Level 3 was already more than I could handle, and it goes up to level 10. I tried pork katsu, pork tenderloin, grilled chicken, and kurobata sausage. 

The pork katsu and tenderloin taste the same yet one costs more than the other. So if I were you, I'd choose the cheaper one. You really can't tell the difference once they cut it up and fry it. 

The grilled chicken was disappointing. Dry and unmarinated. Yes, you're supposed to lather it with sauce but it doesn't change the fact that it comes dry and unmarinated.

The kurobata sausage impressed me the most. Perhaps because I've never had it before, but I was honestly expecting some kind of hot dog and ended up being pleasantly surprised. It has a nice flavor to it.

Portion size is quite generous and service is great.",dJh6gcvrZR2UqM645CNthw,0,0,4,dKs5LmQMbHo4qiulYo96LA

This is a great curry spot in an overall cool area.  The food is great, with various levels of spice in the curry, great cutlets and with the choice of white or brown rice.  The staff is really friendly and answered each question I had.  I went twice and had a pork and a chicken katsu plate.  Each was great.  I got one at the regular, zero spice which was quite good.  I got a two a second time, and it was nicely spicy but not overpowering.  There was a great selection of drinks including sodas, canned iced teas (green and oolong) and beer and wine.  The beer is affordable with domestics being real cheap and Japanese beers being about a buck more each.  This place is a great deal and fantastic for locals or tourists.  It is close enough to the strip that you can drive over really easily.  This is a bargain compared to the usual tourist place.

Trust me...anything that stacks up to cheese buttons and klub is pretty freaking good.

They are very friendly here and greet you as soon as you come in and when you leave. The food also arrives quickly. 

Since I always start with the tofu salad, I'll start my review with it: LOVE. I love it. I am not a fan of salads at all, but I will eat this.. I think it's because of the sesame based dressing... MMMMMMmmm.

My personal favorite here is the spinach & egg curry -- occasionally I will add corn or cheese if I'm feeling a little hungry. There just isn't much I can really say about how amazing this curry is ... you just have to try it and see for yourself! It's not anything like Indian curry.. I would say the consistency is more like gravy. It really does sounds boring and even looks kind of weird, but I assure you the flavor is anything but that. My boyfriend and I joke about how cheap a dish of curry here is, but since he loves to add all the extra options (pork katsu, chicken katsu, sausage, etc), the entree can easily become pricey (but it's okay because it's still delicious).

I love spicy foods, but for some reason I prefer the curry here non-spicy. My boyfriend on the other hand always orders at least an 8/10. I have ordered the 5/10 before and I would say that is VERY spicy (and I can handle spicy...). A little weird tidbit-- they charge you an extra 80 cents if you order more than a 5 on the spiciness scale (1-10). So if you want a spicy level of 6/10.. just go for the 5 .. or make it worth it and get a 8 or 9.. or 10! 

I am super happy that they took over the location next door and expanded the place. It used to be tiny and really wasn't big enough for more than 20 people at once.. which was common!",eLxR9WkbmMfRKLOKDabr_w,4,5,5,BnfpkAs7qjU-VUoNmc-g-w

1) Ambiance:  The place is quiet when we got there and only has 2 other tables occupied. The place is clean and quite cozy.

2) Service:  It was great and food came fast.

3) Price:  I think it is quite pricey after putting the toppings that you want unless you only want the combinations they have on the menu. That's where the deduction of star came from.

4) Food:  Overall, the food was great! We ordered the following items:
 *  Chicken Katsu + Sausage - Hubby ordered it and loved it. He got it at Level 2 spiciness and felt that's all he could go for as the spiciness lingers in your mouth according to him.

* Pork Katsu w/ Egg (Lvl 2 spiciness) - My sister ordered it and she felt that it was quite good and conparable to Curry House in Cali that she and her husband's family frequently go to get their Jap curry fix.

* Original Curry + Spam + Fried Oyster w/ corn - I ordered this with level 1 spiciness (can't handle too much heat).  I found my food very delicious specially the fried oysters. The burst of flavor when I had my first bite of the oyster with the curry sauce & rice. The best description on my food that I can come up with at that moment was ""It was orgasmic!"" Lol! I love to cook and have pretty good palate and the flavor of this was amazing. Even spam with the curry sauce was pretty good. I had leftover food that I brought home to my 16 y/o son and he enjoyed it as much as I did. He did agree that the fried oyster with the curry sauce was to die for.

 I happened to be at this place on the opening day. I was actually planing to eat at Big Wong when I looked across the parking lot and saw the new place with a grand opening sign so I decided to try it. The place was packed! All the tables were taken,(all 2 of them) yes is a small place and you may have to wait outside for your table, so I sat at the bar which I didn't mind because you can see everything that's going on on the kitchen. (Cooks making curry)
I ordered the shrimp curry, And even though I'm not a real fan of any curry since the strong taste/flavors seem to revisit me all through the day, like a meal that keeps on giving, but the flavors of this curry weren't too overpowering, just enough to create that indescribable and addictive flavor. The curry is made with more than ten ingredients that the menu claims that every spice or condiment used for this curry contains some holistic health benefit. (Almost as good as snake oil) So you know that every bite is good for your health on top of being good for your taste buds which is actually what counts at the end.  
   I also had the small salad  which it was crisp and flavorful and at the end of the meal the coffee jello dessert which it was good, again, not too sweet but sweet enough to call it dessert. Can't wait to try the one other dessert.
 I left that place feeling good and healthy.
Service was great and place was spotless, I guess it had to do with being the grand opening, but I'm pretty sure service will continue to be that way, the place is too small to miss you, you can literally grab your waiter from where you're sitting anytime you need something.
 So if you happen to be in the area close to this shopping center that's quickly becoming little Japan, stop and visit this new member of the family, after all we all need a little zen in our lives.

They custom created one of the appetizer specials (deep fried oysters) as a curry for me [Chef behind the counter heard me ordering, and said ""no problem, we can do that""]. 

It is so delicious!

Service was lightning fast, foods were served in under 5 minutes.

Seems a little small for how busy it is, feels crowded, they could have easily filled 3 or 4 more tables if they expanded into bigger space.

The serving sizes were just right, I cleared my plate, but wasn't hungry afterwards.

I really like that they offer a wide range of curry spiciness, on a scale of like 1 to 10 I believe. Perfectly accommodating everyone in a family or a group. They also have genuine vegetarian options, again accommodating everyone in the family.

This is my first time at a fusion Japanese curry restaurant. I will definitely be bringing my family here.",ffxJtLOxDomnZIJo-GgHcA,1,2,5,XphiZQrk67t4t5EB-8vAFw

Over the years, I haven't been much of a japanese curry lover but I will still eat it periodically. This place is small but is managed by a very friendly, welcoming staff. 

Very small, defined menu highlighting their main focus, curry. Plain curry, chicken katsu curry, or pork katsu curry. Of course there are other things on the menu or add ons but in this review, i will not get into it. On the back of their menu, they list every, or almost every spice they use in the curry, as well as a brief description of each of what it does to help you (health wise) 

On the table, there are 7 different bottles. Of course the normal salt and pepper, but they have 3 others. The normal 15 spice blend they use in the curry that gives a mild spiciness. As well as a medium and a hot blend of spices. The final 2 bottles are the usual red pickled ginger you see normally in japanese restaurants and i believe was pickled baby onions? not sure. What i had found out which was a nice touch was that they do NOT put the ginger on the side of the curry, where most restaurants do. I thought it was a nice touch because i am not much of a fan of ginger, overall. 

This first, and only visit I have made (so far), i had ordered chicken katsu curry. Presented in a normal fashion. Round plate. 1/2 white rice. 1/2 katsu covered in the curry sauce. 

Of course, first thing i would taste is the curry sauce. Nice brown color. Very smooth upon taste. Very flavorful. Can taste a lot of the spices but with a small kick from i believe either paprika or cayenne (i dont remember the list of spices they had listed). This place makes their curry sauce well. 

Besides the curry sauce, of course they had the katsu. Wasn't too amazed by this though. It was cooked thoroughly, but maybe a little too long. Meat was dry and the thickness varied greatly on the piece of katsu. The breading was a bit stuff, and not ""loose"". Not sure how to describe it. What i believe to be a perfectly made katsu is an even thickness cut of meat either cut or pounded thin, breaded with panko bread crumbs and fried to a golden brown, long enough to be cooked but fast enough to still be juicy, as well as have a flaky crust. 

Price pretty reasonable. $4.95 for the plain curry. Then additional $3 for chicken katsu, $3.50 for a pork katsu, and they had other things. 

But aside from the katsu, maybe they are still correcting themselves on the timing, ill give them another chance in the future, the curry is great. probably the closest to genuine japanese curry you will find in Vegas for now. Good place to visit but remember, space is limited, to maybe.. 20ish seats total.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,1,2,4,oz28T2cu6pPG-ign8UjvSQ

They do have a fast turnover rate at this place, and table free up rather quick for the times we visited them.

First time I was there was in a hurry, the curry was rather plain here, and their explanation was because their curry is so good that they do not need anything else beside the sauce... a bit too proud?  The flavor was just ok from all the curry I had eaten around the world.  Another time I avoid the curry, and got Katsudon instead, and it was actually much better choice, and they made the right way too.

Other starters we tried were Deep Fried Shumai and Takoyaki.  Shumai was just ""meh"", a bit too dried, and bland.  The takoyaki was just ok as well, a bit too floury on the inside.

I guess my expectation was a bit high being in Vegas and all, but Curry Zen would not be a first choice for me if I had a craving for Japanese cooked dish.  The staffs seemed like they have an attitude problem too.",B2F7f8NdlBUESv8cskE-jw,0,1,3,u4YLXGsp_he7VpemDmJS3g

As unfortunate as it was, I moved to Vegas and the months grew to years; my taste bud fell short, unsatisfied by the curry palettes offered in Vegas. Almost everything was a hit or miss! It was either the curry sucked and the meat was perfect, or the other way around. Booo!

Any ways, long story short, I found this place off of yelp and it was a romantic story between my dish and I. Love at first sight. I couldn't keep myself away! Is it bad that I COULD EAT IT EVERYDAY!? NO PUN INTENDED. LOL. 
Meat ever so tender, various side options to satisfy the texture cravings, and curry spices to what ever heat you wish! Simply amazing.

It's just an average place all around in my opinion.

The curry is decent in flavor but the price seems a bit much. The menu is set up so that you pick your curry base and then from there you add on whatever you want to dip in your curry. So far I've gotten the chicken katsu and kushi options. The food is good. It's why I've come here a few times, but in all honesty it just feels average. Nothing really stands out to me. It doesn't leave me wanting more. It's just average.

They do earn some brownie points for having a rating system on the spiciness of their curry that is actually accurate and wonderful presentation on the plate.

Both of us ordered the same meal - Tofu Cutlet Curry with brown rice, and added corn and added vegetables. 

The presentation of this is quite nice (although it's hard to make curry look appealing) and the taste was out of this world! Just the right amount of spice and it seems so rich but still with a light feel. The tofu cutlets were definitely the stars of the show and I hope they keep it on the menu because they were fabulous - lightly breaded and fried and just crazy delicious. The amount of corn (add on 50 cents for about 1/3 cup) was decent, however for a $2 add on of vegetables there was maybe half a cup in there and it was drowned in the curry sauce.

I usually get scared when they put a lot of fat into my pork(where they basically rip you off cause it's so much fat) but that didn't happen. Croquette was okay too. Really, the spotlight was the curry + pork katsu cause it really tasted great.

The katsu itself was delicious and had the perfect crunch. The curry was flavorful and warmed by body and the radish added a nice crunch. The meal overall just felt like comfort food. Even though I know it's part of the aesthetic, my only complaint is that I wish the curry wasn't layered over part of the katsu.

First of all, the chicken katsu is the dish to get, hands down. I tried both pork and chicken, and the chicken was breaded and fried to such a perfection that I almost had misty eyes. The chicken is perfectly seasoned and fried with such an amazing crispy layer without requiring extra calories just to bite through the protein. The pork, unfortunately, did not get the memo, as the meat was much tougher and less flavored than its other white meat cousin. Since this was my first and possibly the last visit, I had tried a series of appetizers. However, the takoyaki was gone and we showed up literally 15 minutes after the store opened. The fried oyster exceeded my expectation as it was juicy and marinating in its own sauces when I bit through the crispy exterior. The tofu salad was good (although I've never been a fan of iceberg lettuce) and we also tried the edamame (overly salted and many were shriveled), the chicken skewers (protein on a stick, forgettable). As for the main course, my friend and I got he brown rice with curry and the respective meats. I tried a spicy level 8 and it was sizzling, but not cathostrophic. The curry, in my opinion was just a little bit too salty for my taste, but made more bearable when eaten with the curry. Oh yeah, we also ordered the peach jelly champagne, which was an interesting experience, but not sure if it was worth $7.5.

Overall, this is definitely a popular spot amongst the locals, as the place filled up pretty quickly by 12:30pm, so I recommend coming early and preparing your dining experiences.

Simply put, the best Japanese-style curry house in Vegas. Period.

There's Kaba Curry nearby, which is also good, but Zen is better on all fronts.

Zen also offers Curry Pan! It is a Japanese comfort food, crispy fried bread with curry inside. You cannot imagine what it is like until you actually eat it, but believe me, it's a popular food category in Japan.

My favorite is veggie curry with pork sausages. The pork sausage is a beloved ""schau-essen,"" if you know what I mean.

And yes, they offer brown rice too! Now you won't get sleepy even when you have a full belly.",ldqh2aWLTW6D2RHDCj_2TA,3,2,5,M3dll64MEm7k88M-rpBP2g

Definitely take a look at their board for their daily specials. The curry is very tasty and reading the long list of its spices and health properties makes you feel good eating the curry too. They also have a condiment tray  with raisins, pickled onions, and radish which adds great taste and texture. 

The restaurant is really small with maybe 5 tables as well as a counter with stools therefore you may encounter a bit of a wait at times, but it is so worth the wait.   The coziness of this place is especially welcomed during the winter months.

We were disappointed with multiple strip meals and decided to try something out here.  A couple minutes later we had narrowed our choice down to Japanese Curry Zen, pulled in the parking lot, and were quickly seated.

The menu is decent sized, full of chicken, pork, beef, sausage, shrimp, and all sorts of other curry.  I went with the pork katsu, my girlfriend did the chicken.  We had some fried gyoza to snack on before the meal as well.  The fried gyoza was great.  Crispy, tasty, and a good price.  The curry came out pretty quickly as well and we were in heaven.  Tasty curry, good meat, and great rice.  For under $10 this was way better than anything we had on the strip for $25+ a plate.  

Service was good, drinks were always topped off and everything was prompt.  We were in and out in under 45 minutes, paid around $30 with tip, and were on our way.

The menu indicates a 1-10 based spice level, but trust me, you can go beyond that. They charge extra on 5 range increment. So if you're thinking of going for an 11, it'll cost you the same to get a 15.

I started out by ordering Ashi ($2.95/small glass). I ordered Toko-yaki (~$4) and fried shu-mai ($3.75). Toko-yaki was batter was good, but the octopus was bit too chewy. Fried shu-mai are really small, but they have good flavor and frying anything makes it great. 

My main course meal was the chicken katsu with level 10 spicy curry. This might be the first restaurant to charge money to make things spicy (like I won't be paying a price next morning). When I the plate the curry sauce looked red hot (not sure if you can see it in the pic), but upon eating it I was bit disappointed with the spice level. However, I became a fan of this meal.

The price is also perfect $9 for the whole meal. 

I will definitely be back for more. The only negatives I can say is that the TVs are tiny, and I wish the bathrooms didn't smell like someone had a curry explosion. The service is good and the servers take their time to explain the menu item if you are new.

Food: A fine example of how keeping things simple and focusing on a specialty delivers a reliable, quality experience. I think they've recently expanded their menu a bit but I have always been thoroughly impressed with their Japanese curry. The curry itself is standard for their dishes. You pick your meat or veggie option, pick your level of spice and they add rice and voila...you have an awesome dish. They also have a list of add-ons that you would typical see at other places like ramen spots.

Facilities: They've recently expanded (that's a good sign). And now they're double the size that they were when they opened. There might be a wait....but given how fast they get their food ready...wait times shouldn't be a problem. but as a guest, please keep to the same manners as you would with Monta next door...don't hand around...get in...eat your food...and dip.

The chicken katsu/tenders and beef is soooo good. As we say in hawaii: onolicious brah! The flavor is much more authentic compared to other places I've tried. The katsu tofu and veggies are a good add on as well. The portions are generous so I usually have some leftovers to take home for my next meal ^_^

2032435,2016-12-07,5,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"Japanese Cutlet Curry is one of my favorite foods on this entire planet earth ever since I could even utter the words ?????????? (I want Curry!) out of my mouth. I require this stuff just to survive. When I first moved to Vegas a few years ago, I was going through some serious withdrawals, and then I found this place. I was relieved to find that this place does the job. 
There are basically two types of curry that are standard in Japanese cooking. First, there is the roux (or however you spell that) over rice with some meat bits in it. Then there is the cutlet curry which is a big slice of whatever protein you chose on top of rice, covered with the roux. I always get some sort of cutlet curry because I don't see the point otherwise. 
Now if you have one of those big ""American"" appetites, the standard serving isn't going to cut it for you. But fear not! There are plenty of add-ons you can choose as well as some good appetizers. Also, like any good curry place, there is a scale of spiciness from 0-10 I believe. 0 is pretty much non-existent. I usually go with 3 or 4 and my Korean friends think I'm weak. You start paying extra after 6. I think 10 would be suitable for someone like my mom who likes to take a big chunk of wasabi and eat it straight up before her meal just to cleanse her palate. If this is your first time, take it easy with the spice.
There are also two rice types you can choose. The standard white rice, and the purple rice with beans. The purple rice is very healthy for you and it doesn't taste like shit so give it a try.
Another cool trend that has been going on in Japan that this place also does is that they provide Tonkatsu sauce at your table for you to add on to your roux. It adds a very good flavor. I don't know why I always see people getting scared to try this. It's good. Just try it. Don't be vanilla. 
Finally, the service is very good. Most of the workers actually speak Japanese and they know how to treat the customers well. That always makes me want to leave my money there.
This joint isn't huge, and as everyone knows, this plaza can get mad crowded so do expect a wait during peak hours.",mmUsLiQDb--7BBAxA6wKrA,7,6,4,K2DkAyDMXZjTpbdqvxURmQ

We were with friends from out of town and said, with pride, that there is a great curry place to check out. The other staff was great, the food was great, but the quality of service was the lowest by far.

The male server greeted us by saying, ""Just so you know, we can only split the check in four ways."" I thought that was an odd version of ""Welcome to Japanese Zen Curry. What can I get you?"" He was very short with our friends when they were trying to decide what to order, did not offer suggestions, and spoke very monotone and had the facial expression like he was contemplating throwing himself out of the window of a moving vehicle. While I was ordering, I was looking over the side dishes to add to my curry plate. As I often do, I speak while I think and the server mistook it as me ordering and said, ""Can you speak up? I can't hear you."" I told him I wasn't telling my order and he exhaled like he was in hurry.

We received our food (only reason for the 2-star rating) and it was great as usual. Another server offered to print out individual receipts so we can group the payment in three instead of four per request of Mr. Sunshine to help clarify the order. Before we knew it, he comes to our table scolding us saying, ""I TOLD YOU WE CAN ONLY SPLIT IN FOUR."" I had enough at this point and responded, ""You have three cards in your hands. We only want it three ways."" When I offered to tell him that we can group it for him, his response was, ""I don't know what you ordered!"" I can see the awkward looks on our friends' faces so I stood up and had to spell out for him how to charge us.

After signing our bills, he comes over and asks, ""Do you need anything else?"" I laughed. And i said, ""Nope."" And he walks away. I don't know if he was forced to work or a family member died, but he does not belong there. I hope the owner or the friendlier staff members speak about his rudeness.

2204463,2014-04-21,1,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"Atmosphere: Very clean, modern, and bright inside.

Food: I love how simple their menu is and there's no fluff. I've tried both chicken and pork katsu curries but I prefer the chicken curry (don't get me wrong both are great). I only wish they had katsu fish (only because fish is my ultimate protein source)! 

Specials: Although it cost $0.20 extra for spicy levels 6-10, it's definitely worth getting some fire on the curry. I've tried spicy levels 7 and 8, and 8 is definitely hotter (my lips were burning and my stomach a little bit churning). Level 7 spicy is perfect for me with just enough heat! Almonds! Add thinly sliced almonds inside the curry for crunchy texture and because the almonds are so thinly sliced they do not contribute or detract from the curry flavor.

Service: The service is excellent. I believe all the house staff are native Japanese but we didn't really have a language barrier and ordering was really easy. They are quick on their feet and make sure our waters are always refilled and they check in on you often. The food comes out quickly so I definitely recommend this spot for quick eats.

2206304,2016-06-02,5,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"The Skinny: the curry is okay but nothing special(3) service is slow during their busy hours and the seating area is small although better than when they first opened (3), value: given the prices they charge, they should give you more curry (3).

My husband likes this place but quite frankly I could take it or leave it. In terms of flavor, the curry is not bad... but it doesn't taste like anything that special either. (Kinda like the Japanese curry you can make with House brand instant roux)

My beef is the portion size of curry relative to the amount of rice and toppings. When we first started coming, there as barely enough curry for the rice. Now, the amount of curry provided is even less than before.  So I end up leaving half of the rice behind because eating white rice at a curry joint is no fun . And I refuse to pay more for extra curry. I am not a big eater by any means but I normally need to hit Snowflake shavery next door to feel satisfied.

I normally get the spinach curry and I must say...it would be nice to get a bit more spinach in a dish that costs $9. The vegetable curry is also super skimpy on the veggies.

The katsu is okay - the coating is a bit too heavy for my taste.

Even worse, you have to ask for fukujinzuke or rakko. (Normally there is a little canister of these pickles that you can help yourself with or they put it a little on your plate when it is served.) And when they do get some for you, it's a tiny little dish of it. That is if they remember to get it for you.

Overall, this place is okay but provides Jenny Craig portion control. Service is easily overwhelmed and the seating areas are minimal (this place does a lot of takeout... which really is no fun if you order katsu).3 star review",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,4,2,3,qCfUdzJTL_GrmGdhLwyYqg

hooray!!!
i love japanese curry so i'm totally ecstatic!

the flavor of the curry is super tasty but doesn't come in spiciness levels and i would say that it's a little too mild for me.
it also doesn't contain any veggies such as carrots or potatoes which i'm sure makes no difference to most people but i must admit that i'd prefer if there was a little bit of chunkiness/thickness about the sauce.

my friend had regular white rice with his curry and, unfortunately, it was very soggy.
i believe the water to rice ratio was off.
it was only their 2nd day of business so i'd chalk it up as a noob mistake.
i'm sure it'll be better the next time we go.
i had the brown rice and it was cooked perfectly.
i love the brown rice option at no additional charge.

all in all, it was satisfying and i'll most certainly be back for more.

Chicken Katsu was not dry at all and you could tell that curry was made from scratch.
The only reasons why I gave 4 stars were the fact that you can't pick how spicy you want the curry to be... 
I understand that there are different kinds of spices on the side of the table so you can add your own spice to your own curry, but still... after all it is just powder you are adding to your curry, it's not the same... A lot of curry house in Japan, you can pick how spicy!

2261976,2012-12-08,6,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"Curry!  OMG do I love Curry... Indian Curry, Thai Curry, Japanese Curry-it's all good.. The amalgamation of spices, creating that distinct, deep, rich, umber slurry, with heavenly wafts filling my nostrils; you literally taste it through your olfactory senses like an emotion or a memory (Curry is my Pavlov's dog)..

Curry is a favorite from my childhood; just before spending the Summer vacation in Japan, My Mom would make batches of Curry and hundreds of Fried Dumplings for my Dad to eat while we were gone.  I loved hanging out in the kitchen, helping her cook these dishes, and it is distinctly home cooking.

Curry Zen is located in the same Commercial Center as Monta, Raku and Trattoria Nakamuraya, making it's own 'Little Tokyo' deep in the heart of Chinatown.  It's a small venue with only a couple of tables and a counter, so you can imagine there's a prime, rush hour wait - makes sense to time carefully with this restaurant.  But it's clearly a family run business with Husband and Wife manning the kitchen, which is endearing.  

The Curry is a simple gravy, made entirely from Spices and Vegetables.  It has the consistency somewhere between a sauce and stew, with deep but clean flavors that highlight each Spice in a way I've never tasted.  Almost a science, a brief explanation is on a placard on each table (in Japanese) describing the ingredients and methodology- one thing that I find about Japanese culture is the cult like devotion to the culinary process.

On the table, you find various condiments that I find unusual, but welcoming: Almond and Raisins for one, then as the Curry is spicy but not hot, there's a bevy of dry spices to ramp up the heat.  I enjoyed working with a sprinkling of Mild, then incrementally moving towards Hot Chili Peppers.

Along with the Curry, there's a selection of toppings and fried accompaniments: such a Chicken or Pork Tonkatsu, Croquettes, Fried Shrimp and Vegetables. I really enjoy the fact that I can customize my Curry, and I immediately wanted to 'load up' on the fried goodies:  I ordered the Pork Tonkatsu and Fried Shrimp.  Now given the price point, the Tonkatsu was amazing; not your tough, thin piece of stringy meat, Curry Zen presented a really good piece of Pork that was fried perfectly and for an extra $3.50, it's a steal!  The breaded Shrimp was properly cooked and a great mini addition to counter the Tonkastu, you can never have enough fried meat on your plate is my philosophy!

I enjoyed the service, both the Husband and Wife repeatedly asked me how my dish tasted and I appreciated their attentiveness.  And I know I will be coming back, not only for the food, but I want to support the smaller businesses in Vegas and these are good people!

Japanese Curry Zen is actually a really nice/cozy place. It's small, so I suggest you go there during 'off' hours to avoid potential waits. The ordering process was fairly easy. A simple menu and a selection of additional meats to add on without putting a hole in your wallet =] The wait time for the food was normal, and the portions were decent. My friend ordered the pork cutlet and I ordered the chicken cutlet with a side of sausages. The sausages and the chicken cutlet was REALLY yummy. My friend's pork was slightly overcooked, and therefore was a bit harder to chew. The curry itself blended in really well, and I believe it was one of the best tasting Japanese curry I've tried =]

On each of the tables were two types of seasoning, some pickled ginger (i think it was ginger), and some PICKLED GARLIC... I haven't seen a place that served pickled garlic on the side in AGES!

Traveled down to Las Vegas for a quick trip with friends and decided on eating curry before the trek back to LA. Searched curry and this placed popped up with 4.5 stars. We arrived, wait was no more than 5-10 minutes and sat down.

We were all in the mood to eat some curry as it was freezing cold at night and some warm curry would do the trick. Between the table, we ordered a curry chicken katsu and I ordered the pork katsu. I added level 2 spicy to my order for a little extra kick. Also order a plate of takoyaki for the table.

The first plate arrive, the chicken katsu. Portions were nice and food looks delicious. When my plate arrive, I noticed i received significantly less curry. Was it because they added a level 2 spicy so they didn't portion it correctly? The pork katsu looks crispy on the outside but after taking the first bite, the meat was dry as jerky and none to pleasant. I powered through the katsu to get to the delicious part, the curry, The spice level was just right with the right amount of kick up sadly, I had to portion control my curry to rice ration to make sure I had enough curry. The takoyaki was a little disappointing as well. Mostly all dough with very little filling.

The menu is simple you order what kind of curry you want (original, vegetable, or spinach), what level of spiciness (1-5 is free and 6-10 is $0.20 extra), what rice (plain or brown), and what fried stuff you want included (pork/chicken/tofu katsu, pork/chicken tender, shrimp, sausage, and a few others). I've always ordered the original curry with levels ranging from 5-10 depending on the mood, it is good, has the flavors I like but I can never get it too hot to my liking even with the additional spices on the table, sure I'll sweat but I want to breath fire. Maybe it's not suppose to be too hot!? And I'll get the plain rice. The plates are pretty much half rice and half curry. I like the kurobuta sausages but the fried stuff is standard. I could easily eat one plate and be still hungry but drink plenty of water if you're a big eater like me. Adding additional items is an option but it also means adding to the price, which could turn pricey.

The interior is nice and clean. It does get busy occasionally so you might have to wait for a seat or even maneuver around while walking through the establishment. I've never had a problem with service, food comes out in a reasonable amount of time and staff is usually friendly, refill drinks, and handles checks. 

Ask for a smaller spoon or a fork cause the spoon they usually give you is huge.

It's a few minutes from the strip. When we walked in, it smelled like curry heaven. The host/waiter greeted us right away with a Japanese greeting and seated us. The restaurant was about half full. They had a booster highchair for our toddler. 

The menu isn't too complex which was nice. I ordered the vegetable curry with no mushrooms and my husband got the chicken katsu curry. We both got 3 for the spicy level. It was $0.20 per meal to add a level 3 spice. The spicier you add, the more it costs but the max spicy level was still under $1. The waiter mentioned that the 3 would probably be too spicy for our toddler, and I told him he'd probably just eat the rice anyway. I thought that was very considerate of him to mention that. 

The food came out in an expected amount of time. We both took one bite of our meals and were so pleased with how our curry tasted. It was pretty spicy at first but then not too bad. My mouth was burning though. I'd probably get a 2 next time. Good thing we had ice water nearby (which was a little slow to be refilled but that's ok - my husband said that's how it is in Japan haha). 

I tried my husband's meal and LOVED the crunchy, breaded outside and tender, moist inside of the chicken. I wish they would do a chicken and vegetable curry dish. That would be perfect. The meal portions were huge! We were very full afterwards and I couldn't finish mine.

I can easily get down with the fried quail eggs in the Kushi Curry.  If you're into a little heat JCZ offers 10 blaZEN levels.  I highly recommend turning up the heat to about 80% of what you can handle...the heat adds a delightful dimension!  In fact, they are so good in these areas that it's a little frustrating every time you take a bite of sub-par Pork Katsu or Chicken Tenders.  The Vegetable Curry has some potential as well.

I came with a party of 9, and everything seemed to go smoothly. Most of us ordered then those who came about 10 minutes later ordered after. Cool, we're waiting and plates begin to come slowly. But my sister and I noticed that the two curry udons that we ordered weren't coming out, but we waited patiently. EVERYONE else got their plates and the waiter & waitress mentioned nothing about the udon. So I asked them about it and they just said ""oh,"" so the two udon bowls come out and they're watery? Apparently my sister likes that but everytime I've gone to the other location, it was nice THICK curry. In addition, I ordered a spicy level 6 and it was not spicy AT ALL. Maybe they forgot about it and rushed it? Who knows.. But whatever, we were just hungry and wanted to eat then go home. So we ask for the bill, and mind you, we previously mentioned that we were going to pay separately.. We wait about 10 minutes for her to bring the check, then she tells us to write numbers so that we can tell her how we split it. So I did and I handed it back. We wait 20 more minutes for the bill to come out and she separated it by entree saying that she has no time to split it the way I wrote it and said to just combine the paper checks and she'll ring it up like that. So she brings back the cards about 5 minutes later and my card is no where to be found then mentions that there is a $8 minimum AFTER the fact that most of our party paid. Luckily my sister, whose bill was only around $12, was able to combine their checks because there was a complication. So I bring their check back to the register area because the waiter & waitress didn't bother to check on us. I ask for my card and our server, Yuki, told us that she didn't know where my card was. So whatever, it stacked at the bottom of the trays. She told me to sit at my table because she didn't have time to ring me up right there. We waited longer. So she brought my check back along with my sister's.. My bill was fine but as for my sister's, she was charged for more than what she was supposed to pay for. Her bill was only supposed to be around $18, but they charged her almost double that amount. Wtf? I was fed up with this place. Yuki told me that I was supposed to say we were splitting it, which I did, and that they're too busy so she couldn't take care of us and we must wait. So another person comes in later on, named Yuta, and he clarifies and resolves the issue. But apparently we still had unpaid entrees on our check so what did she change the other people? We put the exact checks with our form on payment in separate trays so she couldn't get mixed up? The other waiter didn't even bother to help us. Should've eaten at Hwaro or Monta Ramen instead.

All in all, WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Would not recommend this location. Go to the one of Rainbow if you want to be charged the right amount and want good service.",5u_m4AfSmkKW1pdt9hV2Hw,4,0,1,OwcYAZ445uvKcv3C97DwfQ

This place definitely delighted my taste buds! Their curry was traditional, very rich and thick, with a hint of sweetness.

However, the chicken katsu and the pork tonkatsu were both breaded very lightly and expertly fried to a crispy golden brown. They were extremely addicting.

They came out piping hot and about 2 pieces of tender octopus inside of each ball. The dough was more on the soggy end and also a tad bit bland. Maybe they could of been cooked a little longer. 

I would pass on the curry pan next time. Even though the bread was lightly crispy on the outside, I felt that the overall dough was very dense and lacked curry filling. It was mostly air once I took a bite. (Curry House in CA will continue to hold the crown in curry pan). 

We added: 
- Potato croquette - My favorite! It was lightly sweet and breaded perfectly. 
- Corn - simple canned sweet corn. I still loved it with the curry meal!
- Kushi Katsu (5 skewers of kushiage): lightly breaded and fried and quail egg, zucchini, shiitaki mushroom, chicken tender - Everything was fried perfectly and the chicken tender was very moist and juicy, but I would pass on ordering these next time. They were too boring for me. 

They have many different toppings to add to your curry: kurobuta sausage, potato croquette, corn, kushi katsu (3 or 5 sticks), vegetable, spam, tofu, tofu katsu, spinach, cheese, chicken tender.

Also their spice levels are no joke! 
- Spicy 1-5 is free.
- Spicy 6-10 is 20 cents extra.

We tried spicy #6 which had nice heat. Trust me, they don't mess around. It's not at all unbearable since we're avid spice lovers, but we could of actually went up a couple more notches as well, and loved it! I'm sure spicy 10 would be crazy spicy! 

My favorite part had to be their unique table condiments! I loved adjusting the texture, sweetness, and spiciness of my curry dish at my own discretion. All of these go perfect with curry!
- Fukujnzuke - Japanese sweet pickled radish
- Rakkyo - Japanese style pickled pearl onions. 
- Sliced Almonds - adds great crunchy texture to curry
- Raisins - adds a nice sweetness to the curry and rice 
- Curry powder - adds another level and dimension of curry flavor 
- Spicy chili powder - adds spiciness",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,8,7,5,1NA9XYoRyeCrT9XBOM6DWg

For staters we like their fried gyoza (5 pieces $4.50). Tako yaki (5 pieces $4.50). 

My favorite curry is the chicken katsu curry level 3 ($9.95). Nice juicy tender chicken katsu and their famous curry is the winner. Do you want beef?  Then try the beef curry which also nice and tender beef chunks ($11.20). 

Only thing I have to warn you about is that you ask who is the cook. I say this as you can choose your spice level from level one to ten. But if it's a Thai cook, it will be really hot. Yes people that I know who really do like hot said oh my. So you might want to ask who the cook is and choose your level of spice from there. My friend got a negative two. I had to laugh but he can't handle spicy at all but he loves the taste as everyone that i brought here does.

When you first come here, you cant help but notice the little flyer that is encased in lexan plastic on the table and it is also on the back of the menu. What's on there is all the spices they use and what they are all about. I just sat down and just this info alone I am better for it because I just found out more info on the usual everyday spices I use on my food.

Their menu is pretty simple. Pick your meat whether its Pork, Chicken, Beef, Sausage, etc. You receive your picked meat covered with their special curry they make from scratch along with white rice. I  couldn't make up mind so I chose the Beef but added Pork Cutlet and a Croquette. 

I shared this wonderful creation with my wifey and we were both impressed. The Pork was juicy and not dry at all. The Beef was soft and tender. As for the Croqette, I have never had it before so I don't really know how to describe it. It's basically a mashed potato cake with some vegetables in it. 

Service was spot on with everything from our order being correctly taken to refills to receiving our check and payment promptly being handled. This was one tip I didn't mind adding extra with the standard. 

Overall, just about everything was perfect except for the size of their place. It is pretty small and on really busy nights, you just might have to wait a bit.

9? No challenge.

Unfortunately, it tasted like garbage. Instead of a deliciously smooth and flavorful curry, it tasted like chalk. Moral of the story, even if you can handle a 50, don't get it!

Curry was smooth yet spicy, creamy, tangy. Rice was cooked perfectly, not all smushy and stickly, had enough bite yet soft. 
I had Kurobuta Sausage curry, ""blaZEN"" level 4. I love spicy food and it was just the right heat for me. Not too hot like I had to take a break, but made my nose run (best sinus reliever!).
Kitchen was sparkly clean, and the entire restaurant was neatly kept. Waiters are attentive. Very cozy atmosphere.

The curry dishes are super ala carte and only come with rice and your choice of meat or veggie.  But, the plus side is you can order a small portion of rice and order a bunch of add-ins, like croquette, veggies, egg, etc.  The flavor of the curry was rich and flavorful.  One each table, you can choose the level of spiciness you want, mild, hot, and extra hot by sprinking their custom peppers.  Go with the extra HOT!

As a side note, the restaurant is really small, with only a handful of tables and a counter with 6 or so seats.

If I have a plate of Zen's curry and rice in front of me, you would have better luck having a conversation with Stephen Hawkins without his computer.   Yeah, it's that kind of place for me because it's that good at Japanese Curry Zen.

The first time, I walked into Japanese Curry Zen was a few months ago, and they won me over on the first spoonful of their Tonkatsu curry and rice.    It was a orchestra of flavors, and the unique herbal blend created Beethoven 5th symphony on my taste buds; it was bold, smooth, and complex.   It wasn't too spicy, but Japanese curry Zen has a  number of condiments on every table to satisfied the more picky eaters.   I'm proud to say, I didn't need any extra raisins or extra spices, because the flavors stood on it's own.     One advice to the owners, Please make a sumo sized plate for those overeating Hawaiians :) because I could go off like the Yellow Gorenger from Himitsu Sentai Gorenger series in this place.   If you never seen that series, the renger headquarters was located below a Japanese Curry cafe like Zen, and that Renger would be pounding out 5 to 6 curry plates each episode.     

Zen doesn't have a large dining area, but I don't need a lot of time to eat here because I will clean out a plate within five to ten minutes.  The owners and majority of the staff are very genuine Japanese, and have that entire business spic and span clean.    Ouch!  Sorry Monta on that comment. 

Everyone raves about Monta, which is located a stone throwaway from Zen, but I believe Zen is leaps and bounds better of the two Japanese restaurant in this shopping complex.

The great thing about this place is that your meal can can be as gargantuan as you'd like if you add extra toppings, though the typical serving of rice, curry, and one meat is enough.

The service was very attentive as well, which I'm sure will continue as people discover this gem.

Before, their restaurant was very small but ever since they expanded, it has been very spacious and there is always a seat for you right away unless you are a very large party.

Their service is still amazing as always and nothing says the best customer service than the owner coming out to check on his own customers and asking how everything is. The servers themselves are always very kind and attentive.

They recently also expanded their menu and have more appetizers and desserts now. They also got new toppings to go with their curry. For all you spicy lovers out there, there is a higher level than spicy 10. Me and my friends all tried spicy 100 and it is the spiciest curry you will ever taste. It costs $5 more for spicy 100, however, if you cannot handle it and am unable to finish your food, the owner is nice enough to replace the curry for you for something that you can handle :p Therefore, only try spicy 100 if you're prepared to die!

My favorite toppings to get are sausage, tofu katsu, or vegetables. They also have spam katsu which my boyfriend loves! They also have the best thai tea you will ever taste :D",4aRespr3mEIxRRoW9tio2A,0,0,5,lbxfrzMPkTYkvHfYteSUMg

2956078,2017-07-24,2,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"I like Curry Zen but there's a few things about it that concerns me. First off there are too many dishes on their menu that should be improved or at least evaluated. The sausage curry should not belong on the menu. I'm sorry but it doesn't look like something that should be served at a 4-5 star restaurant. It's literally pieces of cut sausage covered in their curry sauce. Usually less is more, and this is a prime example!

Next, the katsudon is advertised as their prime dish, even stating it as the house dish on their menu if I remember correctly. For something that is their house dish, it was nothing special. In fact, I recommend their standard chicken curry instead. I feel like newcomers to the restaurant or even newbies to curry-eaters in general may not enjoy the katsudon. It's a little soggy and on the bland side.

I like their chicken curry especially with the cheese and corn toppings. The curry, rice and chicken were all on point. I have to say the curry is very flavorful, go to a 7 or 8 if you're around that number with thai food.

I was so surprised at my first bite of curry...SO GOOD!

Our family ordered Curry Pan and Fired Oysters to start things off. Curry Pan is like a giant fried dumpling with curry flavored vegetables inside. The oysters were crispy outside but still fresh ocean flavor with fresh oyster texture inside. 

Next, we ordered the Curry Udon with side of a fried egg (spicy level 7), Vegetable Curry with Chicken Katsu and Brown Rice, and a side fried egg (spicy level 7), Chicken Katsu Curry with a side of Croquette on white rice (spicy level 1). They rate spicy level from 1 to 10, and they have curry powder and red pepper powder on every table to spice up yours if you like and they also have Sriracha Sauce available for the asking. 

We shared all our dishes and loved every bite. Katsus was cooked crispy and tender inside and croquette was such a hit that we almost ordered another one but decided to save room for dessert.

Japanese Curry Zen has a very casual setting with prompt service...we were in and out in about 40 minutes.

My boyfriend and I went in for a late lunch and although it wasn't very busy at first, it filled up completely as we ate. We both had the $3 Kirin draft (can you even eat Japanese food without draft beer?) and an order of fried shumai to start. I usually like all dumpling foods to be steamed and not fried but these ended up being pretty good. They're small, but filled with meat and delicious with Chinese mustard. My boyfriend ordered the chicken katsu curry with corn and cheese and I had the beef curry spicy level 10. I'm pretty traditional with my curry... I haven't quite mastered all these add ons and it seems weird to put cheese on curry especially. Cheese isn't really a staple in Asian food. But of course cheese makes everything better. I had a bite of the chicken katsu curry and the corn and cheese did add some more texture to the dish. My boyfriend said it reminded him of the KFC Famous Bowl which is hilarious. The beef curry was awesome all by itself though. I did have to ask for some pickled radish and onion and I stirred those in, not sure why those don't come with the dish already. I was surprised at how spicy it really was since I've read they can actually get even higher than the level 10. There were about six chunks of beef in the dish, but I shredded them up and they went further. My only complaint about both dishes was that the temperature of the curry itself could have been a bit warmer. I noticed this especially with the cheese in the katsu curry, I think it would help it melt more. Anyways, great meal at Curry Zen and it's always enough food to bring home so I'll be eating it later as well!",rYPjqZO89ABei1fsZBSUbA,0,0,4,nbPCrBs537yVZ8yhzR_Z0g

Like most others diners, I ordered the curry katsu which runs about $10. Each add-on (corn, egg, carrots, etc) is an $1 extra so it can get pricey if you prefer toppings in the curry. The katsu which is perfectly golden and crispy is the main selling point here. The curry on the other hand is just basic. Its simply a water downed brown sauce which explains why they charge for the toppings on the side. They also charge extra if you want spice up the curry but I did notice that their level 3 is probably a level 7 or 8 at most other places. There isn't a whole lot that sets this place apart from the other Japanese curry spots in the area. Thankfully they do serve beer and wine which is always a plus. 

The restaurant itself is a small eatery located across the from Sweets Raku in the heart of Chinatown. The plaza gets busy so finding parking can be a pain. Service wasn't an issue, though its pretty obvious that English isn't anyone's first language here.

Husby got a 1 and said after so many bites, the heat builds up and couldn't finish it. My 6 year old finished it for him.  So if you can't handle any bit of heat, stick with the mild flavor.
My daughter ate the curry udon in the mild flavor. It came with onions, green onions and bits of chicken. She loved it but couldn't finish it since polishing off her dad's plate.
The mild taste a bit sweet with ZERO spice and is very tasty. 
The fried shumai also comes with a spicy mustard sauce, like the hot mustard from Chinese restaurants. I personally love shumai fried now.  
We all enjoyed our meal.  Our service was polite even w/ the limited English our waiter spoke.

Not much vegetable to this meal.  I had the pork katsu with spicy 10 curry with spinach and corn additions.  The corn was like 20 kernels and the spinach was devoured in the curry so not much green to it.  It had a little kick but nothing crazy.  The pork was your basic breaded meat.  I enjoyed the meal but it definitely hits you later in the day and gives you the bloated feeling.    I paid $13.95 total for my meal so it's definitely not that cheap either.  I'd rather eat at many of the other options in China Town or the shopping plaza alone.  But if you're into katsu then it's a good rendition.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,0,3,TTZruvsxLuTMFVt-FMOKHw

Our spicy levels were extra charges and it gets more expensive the spicier you get! I think  spice level 8 is 35 cents extra. Which reminds me, they switched our spice levels and I was almost crying trying to eat my curry while his had almost no spice...we were in no mood to voice our concern as we were just hungry. The takoyaki felt a bit under done, the 'meatloaf' is more like a soft burger patty and cheese and corn cost 75 cents extra, each.... not worth the extra price (the corn was COLD).

I've been meaning to come here as I've heard good things from friends and others and finally was able to come. 

The overall atmosphere is very friendly with a welcoming staff. I liked the atmosphere a lot. There is a bar with maybe 10 or so seats and four tables I believe that seat four each. 

I'm very particular about my Japanese Curry as I am with a lot of Japanese foods, but I try to keep an open mind. 

They have many condiments on the table, three of them are different levels of spicy curry powder (mild, regular, spicy), ginger, almonds, raisins, and salt & pepper. The curry powder is their recipe with many blended spices that they make. 

The prices are pretty reasonable, $4.95 for the plain curry and then depending on the topping you add additional costs. You can mix and match whatever you want on their menu ranging from chicken katsu to corn and other items you would ""normally"" find in curry. 

I got the croquette (+$2) and corn (+$1) in my plain curry. I thought for the price the croquette would be slightly larger than what it came out as, so I was a little disappointed. They brought it out on a plate with the rice on one side and curry on the other, the croquette and corn in the middle, with an overlap of curry (Japanese don't like to ""mix"" the curry and rice traditionally). The croquette however was good and I believe they make it as well. It was nicely browned to the correct color and breaded perfectly. 

The curry itself was mediocre, maybe I was expecting more, but I have to come back and try it again to make a real comparison. The spices were good, but it felt like something was lacking, maybe it was an unlucky batch that I got. I'll definitely come back to give it another try before making a final opinion on it. 

It has an authentic taste to it, maybe the most authentic out of all the curry I've tried in Las Vegas, but like I said I would have to give this another try along with some others. Will update in the near future on the taste of the curry again. =]

Oh they didn't put the ginger on the plate (thankfully, as I don't like ginger). 

I would definitely recommend at least giving it a try.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,3,2,3,O_2oHHXIse7z1bWewTR6Qg

We also received our meals 5 mins apart which is super awkward. My friend got his plate... 5 mins later I got mine... 5 mins later my BF got his...

Unlike other curry places in town, like Kaba Curry:  They serve my favorite, deep fried oysters.  The tables have condiments for you to personalize your curry with, like raisins, almonds, katsu sauce, hot spice shaker, rakkyo, and especially fukujinsuke (pickled radish).  The way a Japanese curry restaurant should be.  The menu is simple, but you can play it up however you like.  Zen doesn't need a fancy menu to have superior food or fancy decor, unlike other curry places.  The owner himself is very nice and seems to always be hard at work in the back.

We arrived in the evening when they were pretty busy but there were two empty seats at the counter. The waiter who sat us asked US if anyone was before us in line for a table- um, how should we know? There were two guys hanging around outside but they could have been waiting for take-out or something else, and it's not my job to keep track of your customers for you. Also I just got here?

So anyway, he sat us and took our drink order... and then suddenly remembered that there WERE other customers in line for a table and made us get up and leave. I was completely appalled at how unprofessional and absurd this behavior was. We were seated and had our order taken!

The sauce was flavorful and the katsu was piping hot! 

As good as the curry rice dishes were, the curry udon unanimously was our favorite. Broth and noodles were on point! 

You can pick the spicy level on all of the curry dishes. I don't normally do too spicy, just a mild kick and level 3 was perfect for me. The waitress said most people go with a 5 or 6, but it goes all the way to 10!",xulAEj3baAkFj0tgPnkFyA,0,0,4,01IXr_yF9ESKgzCh6DQVuA

I ordered the chicken katsu curry and the curry pan. The chicken katsu was crispy and they used the white meat portion which was pretty good. I didn't have to worry about the meat being too dry since I had the curry for moisture. The curry itself was just okay. There wasn't much of a strong flavor to it compared to places like Curry House and Coco Ichibanya. It was pretty hard to taste the spices in there, but at least it didn't look watery lol. The curry pan has a nice crispy shell and the inside was a thick curry paste which more flavor than the curry from my other dish. The only critique was that it was given to me lukewarm and not warm and toasty which makes me think if they just reheated it or used a microwave or something. I didn't request for them to reheat it because it was still edible and I generally don't like to cause problems for the staff unless it was something major. 

Either way if you are in the area feel free to check this place out. It isn't the greatest, especially if you've been to other curry dishes from other restaurants, but it does fulfill the curry cravings. Be sure to ask for the red pickles because they sometimes forget to give it to you along with your dishes. They also give you onions here which is pretty neat. They aren't strongly flavored so you don't have to worry about it overpowering your dish.

This is my favorite place to eat at in Las Vegas, not only because of my almost unhealthy obsession with Japanese curry and the conveniently central location in Chinatown, but also because of the people who work here. The servers are unbelievably courteous, efficient, and always have a smile on their face. Every customer is greeted with an enthusiastic ""Welcome!"" and is seated almost immediately. The servers are also quick to let customers know if the wait time for a specific dish is projected to be longer than usual, so there are never any unpleasant surprises regarding that. 

Although the menu isn't extensive, people who'd rather not have curry do have some other options, such as Takoyaki, Gyoza, and rice bowls, which are all pretty good. The food is prepared fast and timed just right, so orders for the same table come out at around the same time. It's definitely a perk when I go out with friends to eat and talk.

The portions are big considering the low price - just perfect for hungry broke college students. There is not all that much meat on the Beef Curry, but I usually get the Grilled Chicken Curry, which has a good meat-to-rice ratio and tastes fabulous.

The Food (3 out of 5): 
Okay, I've been here a couple of times now, and both times I have had the Tonkatsu (pork) curry rice which is good and tasty. Now, curry rice is a staple in most Japanese households, and I am really used to not only having the white rice with pork cutlet & curry sauce over it, but also with other vegetables in the curry sauce as well (i.e. potatoes, carrots and sometimes celery). So, I was disappointed by the fact that you could not add any of these kinds of additional veggies. Also, they really should offer Tabasco sauce in the restaurant as well as another kind of ginger (their ginger is kind of sweet). 

The Service (3 out of 5): 
Service has been good here but not great. On the last time here we had to wait a little bit to get refills on our waters and to get more ginger. Yes, they were busy at the time, but then again, it's not like you can pack a lot of people in the restaurant. I didn't like the fact that our table for 2 was really close to the table for 4 next to us, it was kind of like we were there with that other party. 

OVERALL:
If you have a hankering for Japanese curry (or if you don't want to wait too long at Monta a few doors down), then this is a decent place to go. However, I do think that I can cook a much better curry rice myself though!",JDXcf0qEwoeo8fx9TlPMeA,0,0,3,ZpW_7FmKKQ-ENTU4FLGbXw

I have visited a few times now since they've opened and noticed each time the curry increases in spice slightly as well as the amount of condiments on the counter. Now they have raisins, sliced almonds, 3 different mixed spices (mild, medium, and hot of course), fukujinzuke (mixed pickled vegetables), and pickled scallions. 

The menu is small ranging from chicken katsu, pork katsu, kurobata sausages, potato croquette, shrimp, a curry hot dog, and a couple of jello desserts Maybe its not their style, but if somewhere down the line they decide to add vegetables as toppings I would be all for it!

The best things about Curry Zen is the portions are good versus price (yay for college budgets), FREE brown rice option (paging brown rice warlord Misti Y), service is friendly, and I suppose that its an option for my vegetation eating friends as you can opt for the curry and a croquette. 

Lastly the only con I can think of now is... where am I going to park? With  all these thriving businesses in this plaza it makes parking a chore. 

A side note of the most nanoscopic size possible, I did see someone wheel in a few boxes with labels saying Java Curry. I'm not suggesting that it is not homemade, but I do wonder if they use their roux some parts of their curry? Just some thoughts from a noobs.

It's such comforting soul food and i'm OBSESSED!! I'm constantly craving zen curry and i could eat here for a week straight which i did before lol. This is located down spring mountain in a really jammed packed location because of other popular restaurants and desert cafes so parking is a butt, but it's so worth it when you taste the curry!! You get a big plate and basically you build your own curry! What so love about this place is that they have healthy options if you're a vegetarian or watching what you eat! What I love to get here is the Chicken Katsu (so delicious and juicy) with level 3 spice and the 5 piece Kushi (quail eggs, chicken, mushroom, shrimp, and zucchini?) or i get it with cheese and corn with just the chicken katsu & curry! Remember to get the red radish as well (i can't eat it w.o this). These dishes here has so many different kind things you can add on, the spam and croquette is delicious as well. My mouth is watering just typing this and I can't wait to be back. 

The service here is AMAZING ALL THE TIME! Their staffs are super knowledgeable about their menu and are so kind. There's this one employee guy that's so so sweet (i didn't catch his name) but we left him a $20 tip and he literally went out of the restaurant to look for us and kept bowing his head saying he can't accept such a big tip and we said he deserved it, like this made me so teary and melt my heart because he's so genuine and kind. Thank you zen curry for excellent services and staffs!

I love Curry and have eaten many curry dishes even lived in Honolulu, Hawaii where CoCos was on top of my list, but compare to the service and taste.  I got a new favorite Curry House. Also I can't stopped thinking about this curry, considering it was my first time trying Japanese Curry Zen, 3 days ago. yes 3 days of thinking about it every time eat my home cooked meals(and I love what i make at home)

So I went with my roommate Elizabeth L. (check out her review 5/13/13) to eat @ Monta Ramen(which was close by and is also pretty good) and after that we went to Japanese Curry Zen to order ""To Go"" for dinner because we were working that night and had no time to cook but once we got home we wanted to have a little nibble just to try and ended up eating it all. even though we were full from Monta Ramen. The staff and cooks are so nice and smiley.

That was certainly enough to fill me up. The curry flavor was so full of flavor. I didn't add extra spice to it, and thankfully the curry wasn't spicy in the mouth at all. However, you can very well taste the herbs and spice in it. The croquette is certainly a recommendation. It has potato with vegetables inside, and it's fried.  Super yum. It has that nice outter crunch on the outside and a nice soft potato inside. I got to talk to the chef for a bit who was really friendly and helpful. He also recommended that I try mixing raisins and almonds in my rice. Apparently it's good for the digestive system. It's pretty good! However, I recommend you mix it with white rice. It doesn't taste as good with brown rice. The chicken was also very tender.

The curry is good, but I usually get a level 1 dish. The spicy levels seems like they differ. Sometimes a level 1 will feel like level 1, but sometimes feels like level 3 or 4. Portions are filling as well.

Service is good, minus a couple bad experiences. One time I asked for a croquette as a side like always (I never had japanese curry without a croquette. EVER.) And the waiter asked ""croquette? Coke?"" I replied ""no, croquette"" and pointed at the croquette on the menu we then extended the whole croquette/ coke thing for 30 seconds more and reached an agreement of croquette. He then came back with a coke. I sent it back and got my croquette. Another time some waiter was being extremely cool and hip with it. He got my order wrong a few times, but im sure he was just having an unlucky time with me since the other people there didnt have any problems it seemed.

Environment is puny and if its full, youre probably gonna have to wait outside until one is available. It also gets loud easily with such dense seating.

Pros: good place to grab curry, carry (or curry lmao im killin myself here) out is available, nice portions.

Cons: seating is limited, gets loud easily, and inconsistent spicy levels

Advice: if seating is limited, you can get carry out. Top this place off with Kung Fu Tea, its perfect. Get croquettes as a side.",xS4eeHlnIyGdyo2qnI9d4Q,1,0,4,QQ8e3F39UgxHByJX2elhBw

My group saw this plaza nearby and decided to check it out.  Checking Yelp, Japanese Curry Zen had very high ratings (highest in the plaza) so it must be good and decided to check it out.

When I first went in, a larger group was eating inside and noticed the only seating spots available were at the counter.  I was greeted with the ""irashaimasae!"" (welcome in Japanese) and was very pleasant to hear.

I ordered the tender pork katsu with a spice rating of 3 which was medium spice.  My wife ordered 5 and it was a little on the spicy side.  Generally if you are novices to curry, I would recommend a 2.

The tender pork was indeed tender and cooked very well.  The curry had a thickness to it and wasn't watered down like some places... it had a good spice kick to it and hands down was one of the best curry I ever had.

Their prices were reasonable and the owner is very friendly and was very humble.

He did mention that they are expanding the restaurant to the now vacant spot next door, so come January/February they will have more seating capacity.

I ordered the vegetable curry, spice level 7, and added chicken katsu. As a big fan of spice, I'll vouch that you'll get the level you asked for! It has always annoyed me when you're expecting a certain spice level and it's either either too spicy or not spicy enough. If you want to stay on the cautious side and order low, you can always add some extra chili flakes they have on the table. The curry itself was delicious and very flavorful. The veggies were cooked tender enough to cut with just your spoon. Although the chicken katsu was small, it was yummy and all white meat! I also ordered the takoyaki and I was happily surprised. The outside was crispy and the inside still tender but not undercooked, with large pieces of octopus.

Everything that I love about a restaurant is here and aligns perfectly like a balance of the universe. I swear, the stars align when I visit this place!

- I love how the place is so small and cozy; the capacity is only 18 people. 
- The prices are very affordable with the base price starting at $4.95.
- The menu is simple and easy to breeze through
- You can customize your curry: toppings? spiciness? brown rice? They got it!
- The food is delicious, fresh and doesn't weigh a person down. It's pretty healthy too, so that feeling of ""I ate pretty good,"" resonates through my head instead of, "" I can't believe I ate _that_. I think I'll go hibernate now.""

Finally, the owner and his staff are some of the nicest most appreciative people that I have met. I have been here 4 times now and the gentleman behind the counter (I believe he's the owner) always takes the time to greet guests entering the restaurant as well as thanking them as they exit. If you're up at the bar eating, he'll most likely ask you personally how everything was. The rest of the staff are warm and attentive too. This really hits it home for me because it shows that the owner really cares about his restaurant and the customers.

Curry Zen gets 5 stars from me because I honestly can't get enough of it. Whether it's the next day, whether I'm on the other side of town, or whether it's four in the morning, it always sounds good. My boyfriend is also a big fan and jokes that they must put crack in it ;)

Beware, their curry truly is HOT. I can only tolerate a 3-4 out of 10 and I'm no wimp. The heat builds the more that you eat so that by the end of the dish, you have to take a few gulps of water after every bite. The pickled vegetables on the side help with the heat, as does added cheese and corn, but nothing will help you if you order a level 10 heat. Nothing... Your insides will be your outsides and I pity the fool that plays like that!

Anyway, if you're a pro with hot curries, I would go with a level 6 or 7 and work from there. They have shakers on the side with curry powder and chile powder to add. 

I personally recommend their croquette as it is so fluffy and crispy and delightful, no regrets. If you are a vegetarian or avoid meat, their tofu katsu is perfectly crisp and tastes great with the dark sauce in the squeeze bottles at the table. 

I always get the 16 grain curry because I really love the varying texture of the rice. My boyfriend is a fan of the plain white rice with his curry. He normally gets the pork katsu but has tried the Japanese meatloaf before. He wasn't the hugest fan of it but he did like it, just not as much as the pork! ^_^

Overall, you could go to Curry Zen every day of the week and try something new, with amazing service each time to boot!

Immediately as we walk in we notice how small the dinning area is, probably only capable of seating 15 dinners or less. I swear I think the it was the size of my bedroom, haha! However, there were only a few other patrons since it was a Monday night. I wasn't too hungry so I ordered the croquet with corn while my friend had the chicken katsu, corn with cheese. We both enjoyed our meals very much so and particularly liked that there was a slight hint of spice in the curry. The croquet was pretty standard so I couldn't complain there. The prices are pretty cheap too, most menu meals were under $10. So if you are on a budget I definitely recommend this place. I liked my first visit so much I had been craving this place days after so I came back a week later with a different friend.

A major downer is that everything is FRIED, except the beef curry stew. The menu is definitely minimal and they should consider expanding and adding options like omelet or loco moco.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,3,0,4,CTNom7WxK2BKjqob26Vzsg

I got a small chicken katsu curry and added a croquet. In all honesty, the small was plenty enough. I do recommend adding some other stuff since a small is about 3.50, it's forsure worth it. 

My friend added some cheese, which was also pretty good.

I thought it was kind of weird that you have to pay extra to make it spicier.

Takoyaki -- 6 deliciously crispy balls filled with firm octopus. The batter was perfectly crispy with just the right amount of tenkasu filling. There were tons of bonito shavings on top to give it that extra seafood flavor.

Pork Katsu -- Dark brown curry, mild in taste with just a hint of sweetness. They have custom spice levels 1-10 and to be safe per the waiter's suggestion, I stuck with level 5. Their pork cuts are thin and tender, with a satisfyingly thin layer of crust.

Next time I'll get 8.  

The servers enter your order on a tablet so the order is sent to the kitchen from your table.  I was brought a glass of water which was refilled once.  It took about 5 minutes and the curry was brought to the table.  Besides the basic curry, chicken, and rice, I added the topping of cheese and a fried egg.

Mixing the curry, cheese, and egg into the meat and the rice was my first step in enjoying this meal.  Once that was done, I took my spoon and started to enjoy the dish.  The spice level was OK.  It had a nice tang to it but it could have been spicier.  The chicken is breaded with just the right amount and cooked so that no knife is needed.  The spoon broke the chicken pieces quite nicely.

A couple of things:  this is a small restaurant so you may have a wait.  There is a sign in sheet at the door when you enter.  This plaza is filled with Asian restaurants and parking can be a pain.  Luckily, I found an empty spot.

SERVICE
Every worker I have encountered have been polite and attentive. Quick to refill water, get your order and checks. Customer service here is on point everytime. 

FOOD
I grew up eating curry. Back when I was living in Japan, I remember I always looked forward to my school lunch every Friday because it was curry rice. I looked forward to it so bad I couldn't even pay attention in class. 1+1=curry? Makes sense.  

Keep in mind, curry is one of those things where everyone makes it differently and each household has different style of curry. Japanese curry has evolved in many ways because people are constantly trying to figure out ways to make it taste better- adding chocolate or coffee in curry is typical in many Japanese households. 

All of that somewhat irrelevant information aside, it's difficult to rate a curry for me because I am accustomed to my family's homemade curry. I do have to say the curry here is good in its own way. I know Mr. Zenbayashi takes pride in his curry and I enjoy the curry here, with spicy level 0 because I can't handle any spicyness. I also like mine with chicken katsu and cheese. Don't go too crazy on the spicy level as some find level 2 to be pretty spicy. There's also extra charge if you go past 6 on the spice scale. 

I appreciate that they offer many options. You can get your curry with brown rice, white rice or udon. They also offer chicken katsu, pork katsu, meat loaf, kurobuta sausage, cheese, corn, croquette, fried shrimp etc. (Anywhere from $.50 to $3.00 to add-on). Customize your way!

CONCLUSION
The portion is somewhat small but for the price range of $10-12, their rich and thick curry with crispy and perfectly fried katsu is well worth it.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,6,6,4,AlppS9e35sXgKL1onw-2fg

I've only tried one other curry house in Las Vegas and they have my favorite sauce here. Saying this curry is like the store boat curry would be like saying the ramen you buy at a grocery store is like Monta.

They serve white and brown rice with many different proteins to go with your curry & rice like katsu'd pork/chicken, spam, sausage, meat loaf, croquettes, beef, and grilled chicken. Some other add ons are cheese, corn, and veggies. They also have some sides like fried oysters, gyoza, and curry puffs.

I got the chicken katsu curry and added veggies, corn, and cheese. I'm a sucker for a Japanese meat patty so I got one of those on the side too. Be careful because all of the sides can add up! My dinner wound up being about $18 with a water lol.

The food was delicious! Both proteins I got were cooked very well. The katsu chicken was moist on the inside & the Japanese meatloaf was flavorful and delicious. The cheese  I got added a creaminess that made the dish for me. I've never had cheese on my curry but will probably always get it that way in the future.

My one gripe would be my assumption that a 5 on their spice level would be medium. It was HOT. I would have enjoyed my dinner more had I got a lower spice level. I did try my friends 1 spice and it was a bit sweet for me so I'm sure a 3 would be solid.

The service was good. It was sweet of them to happily split our bill even though it was super busy.

However, on this trip I had my car and I wanted to eat where the locals eat.  Japanese Curry Zen is on Spring Mountain Rd, in the Seoul Plaza strip mall West of the 15.

They specialize in authentic Japanese curry here, that is hand stirred and silky smooth.  Curry and rice is $5.95 and you can add chicken or pork cutlet ($3.50), kushi (chicken; quail eggs (3); & zucchni - $3.50), and a variety of other toppings for an additonal charge.

We ordered the tempura oyster app ($3.60 for 3), tonkatsu ($9.45), and the foregoing w/ kushi ($12.95 - not pictured).  A can of soda was $1.

The oysters were excellent.  The tempura was cooked very well, and the oysters were fresh.  I have had overcooked, not so fresh oysters and they disintegrate when you bite into them.  These were nothing like the foregoing:  5 Stars.

Likewise, the curry was excellent.  You could see and hear the chef constantly stirring the curry sauce to perfection.  Secondarily, the color was perfect.  In addition, the pork cutlet was cooked properly.  It was not dry like other places I have experienced.  Lastly, the portion was a bargain for the price.  BTW, I ordered 3 out of 10 for spiciness, and I was SMAO:  5 Stars.

The service from our waitress was also excellent.  She was super nice, described how the menu worked, and really attentive:  5 Stars.  The ambiance is very basic, but it works for this small place.  Although the place is small, there were separate, clean restrooms:  4 Stars.

If you have a car, forget the overpriced, Americanized Azn food on the strip, and head to Spring Mountain Rd (I would compare to Garden Grove Blvd in OC).  In addition to Japanese, there is Vietnamese, Chinese and Korean.

My friend on the other hand is a Japanese curry fanatic and would eat it every day if he could which is why we ended up here. We stopped by this place as we were leaving Las Vegas as just a quick meal before a long drive home. It was relatively empty since we got there not long after they opened. Since there were 4 of us, we decided to each try something different. We started off with 2 appetizers: takoyaki (4/5) and shu mai (1/5). For mains, I got the kushi curry with a croquette (3/5). My friends got the chicken katsu curry (2/5), karage curry (2/5), and pork medallion curry (2/5). You pay a base price for the curry + the meat, but if you want it spicier you add money on depending on the spice level you choose. Considering their prices were already relatively high, I wasn't so keen on the idea of adding more money just for a spicier dish. The takoyaki was very fresh and probably the best thing I had over lunch. The shu mai on the other hand was sad and over fried and definitely not worth the price. All the meat in the curries were super dry and tough. My friend who ordered the pork medallions was surprised at how dried out his pork was considering he ordered medallions in hopes that they would be much more juicy and tender than just a regular pork katsu. Even the karage and chicken were dry. The best curry was by far the kushi, since it came with a variety of things (my personal favorite being the quail eggs), but it definitely was not worth the price in my opinion. Not only did I get less portion wise, but the kushi curry was $2 more than the katsu curries. Definitely would not return here next time around. 

Pros: 
- Takoyaki was very fresh 
- Offer a generous amount of curry sauce
- Large interior with a good number of tables

Cons:
- Hard to find parking
- Meats were all dried out (especially sad considering they are fried)

You can't really go wrong with any of the items. I normally go with either chicken katsu or beef with spinach and croquette. You can't really go wrong with any of the proteins, they're all so good! Croquette is very tasty, it is pretty much a fried, breadcrumbed mashed potato with some vegetables. Make sure to also ask for some Daikon/pickled radish as it sort of refreshes your palette.  

Adding spinach makes the curry a lot thicker so if you would rather have a runnier curry that makes the ratio equal.. I would either recommend getting extra curry or omit the spinach.

As for appetizers, make sure to get the Takoyaki! It is a must-have every time I visit Curry Zen. Can never go wrong with it.",1-icjsOsrv-zxIvWr2VW0g,2,2,5,9znxW7zyzn2Y-hedSFZ9nw

I find myself coming here whenever I can't decide where to eat. It's because it's quick (the parking is another story), convenient, and their menu is right to the point. 
I've been coming here since the beginning, when they only had a couple of items on their menu, and it was perfect. Since then, they have expanded their menu but for the better! There are now more options for vegetarians - fried tofu or veggie curry are usually what I order.

Tips: 
-The spicy levels on their curry do run a bit hotter than most places so if you want a mild, a 2-3 is perfect. Anything past 4 is like death to my papillae. 
- The parking is also insane! If you want a guaranteed spot, try parking on the side streets next to the center. Many people do it and so far it hasn't caused me any trouble.",2yPRCQMd2u0ka7r5IdITBQ,2,1,4,TggDgJGUP4dOaLWF_g21Dw

I've been a handful of times and the curry is always consistent and has great flavor.

-You basically build y our own curry plate. You can either start with a plain plate and add on items, or just order one of their set plates.
-You can change the spicy level, but you pay for anything above spice level 5
-They have Curry Udon now!!!  
-Chicken Katsu is a thick cut,  not dry and fried well.
-Jasmine Tea is good

4107204,2014-07-21,1,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"Finally made visit #2 after months and months. Regretted waiting so long.

When I popped into Japanese Curry Zen tonight, I almost didn't recognize where I was. They've definitely expanded their dining room at some point in the last several months. This is a great thing for what I'm sure is still a popular dining destination.

For a change of pace, I decided to order the kurobuta sausage curry ($8.45). Kurobuta is synonymous with Berkshire, which apparently is a tasty and pricey type of pork. Google it or something. The sausage is really tasty and tender, somewhat sweet, and definitely on the small side (that's what she said). However, the flavor is more than enough to enjoy rice, curry, and kurobuta evenly for the whole meal.

Other than the choice of meat, the curry is the same for everyone. Good white rice (whoops, forgot that I had good brown rice last time) plus a savory, high temperature curry with their special blend of spices. I tried both the sweet pickled radish and the onion thingamabobs that they bring out to accompany the curry, and I went mostly with the sweet stuff to augment the flavor profile.

A note on the spice level: think a hot Thai place, or possibly worse. I went with a ""3"" again and ate fairly slowly, recalling how I rushed it last time and was punished for not waiting for it to cool. My advice: order conservatively and be aware that there are additional spice condiments available if you need them.

This is a must-try restaurant for anybody who eats any sort of food, and it makes the plaza that it inhabits even more special.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,3,1,5,Np01yeM5-ZUQvsaywbtChA

Something that might help people deciding on spicy level: I am okay with spicy, and realized that 5 was my hot spice level. 5 already got my face sweating, but it didn't bother me.

The decor is modern, warm and clean the service was extremely polite and fast and the chef was behind the counter to be watched while plating his food.  

This is a bit like a fast food but comfort food but way better, let me explain why.  They have a 15 spice blend with a guide on the back of the menu explaining the benefits of adding these spices to your food.  I have been to a couple of curry places in town and basically I could have bought the same mixture from a box and added water and had the same thing.  This place is different you can tell it is freshly made daily.  The flavors  of the curry is a strong but very mild flavor at the same time (I know that doesn't make sense but if you eat it you will understand).  You have quite a few options for the meat portion of the meal from chicken, fried pork chop  and a few more.  The rice is plentiful and good you also have a brown rice option for a healthier carb addition to your meal.

My order the pork cutlet curry. My dish arrived promptly and the curry sauce was flavorful but I added medium spicy seasoning for additional spiciness. I thought the pork was on the tough side and was a little difficult to even cut.

I loved the Rokkyo (pickled baby onion bulbs) and if you want your curry hot there were many condiments to do just that. There even were raisins and almonds -yucky to me but hey if it works for you.....

The Potato Croquette was near perfect - the texture,breading,the mashed potato - yeah it was all good.... the tonkatsu was fried well also. The curry sauce was good enough to me. I only enjoy Japanese and certain Thai curries so this place did hit the spot. 
I did suggest to the waitress that other curry options should be offered like - curry cooked with veggies (carrots & potatoes), or curry with beef cooked in it (cause the beef becomes melt in your mouth soft) or even offer more add-ins like corn,green onions,ect....

I was seated right away in one of the few open tables. Its a small restaurant and it was pretty crowded. Not as bad as Monta Ramen across the parking lot but still a busy place.

I ordered the chicken katsu curry which is apparently their best seller. I can understand why. Tender, crispy fried chicken, a big scoop of rice and a plate full of Japanese curry. Its hard to beat.

I ordered my curry with a spice level of 3. It was perfect for me. I could maybe go as high as 4 but more spice than that might be too much. This was just right. It made my sinuses open up just enough. And it wasnt so spicy that I lost the taste of the actual curry. Japanese curry, to me, has a certain nuttiness that cuts through the pungent spice. Its not as sweet as say Thai red curry or panang curry. This is more savory. The thickness and color is reminiscent of Grandma's gravy on Thankgiving. It warms the soul.

I would give Japanese Curry Zen another go in the future. I like curries of all varieties but Japanese curry stands out in my mind.

One thing I would comment on is that the curry was a little bit on the saltier side. Maybe it's just me since I'm more sensitive to salt. If it was just a bit less salty, then it would have been perfect.

It's good tasting, and a good value, but it's nowhere near the taste or quality I experienced in Japan.

My son, whom was stationed in the Navy in Japan, did like it, and my other son, who accompanied me to Japan, said it was okay, but agreed with me that it was nowhere as good as what we ate in Japan.

Place is decent, help is very friendly, and as I said before, food is decent and certainly a very fair price. 

My only complaint was; it's a busy center and parking is at a premium.

What I always get is the Katsu-Don, with the egg cooked well done. Usually, the egg in the dish is served undercooked or runny. Because of food allergies, I'm only able to eat cooked egg so I really appreciate the staff being able to make the egg adjustment for me so I can eat here with my friends. In the past, I've ordered the Chicken Katsu with rice, no curry, and that was good as well.

I went with the chicken cutlet and the croquette. The taste was ok, but it definitely could've used some vegetables. Yes, they have corn, but something green would've been nice. It would've lent the dish some freshness too, I think. What with the rice, the croquette, the breaded chicken and the brown sauce, it just seemed kind of monotonous to me.

I normally order a Scrambled Egg & Spinach Curry with a Croquette, but last time I went, I ordered a Croquette Curry with Scrambled Eggs and Cheese. Tomato comes with the Scrambled Eggs.

I drowsily shuffled myself into the brightly lit and chipper restaurant. I was hungry! The menu was very simple. It focuses on the homemade curry sauce and the katsu. For the small amount of food on the plate, the prices were kind of high. We ordered the pork katsu and curry and added a side of veggies to make the plate more substantial. Bummer that there isn't a veggie and meat combo curry because adding the veggie side really bumped up the price of our dish. I'm used to Chinatown prices where you can get a substantial meal for $12.

I was very impressed. The curry dishes were spot on. But before I get there, because it was late and we were hungry, we ordered some appetizers. Ordered Gyozas and deep fried Siu Mai dumplings. I've never had a fried Siu Mai before. Both were good but not spectacular. They were on the smaller side (if you've been to a Chinese restaurant with good dim sum then you know good Siu Mai and Gyozas (potstickers) are pretty good sized where six to eight can make for a hearty portion). The skins were of course fried and crispy. The pork filling was good but not all that flavorful. The fact that we were hungry probably made them taste better than they were. 

Now on to the entrees. I got the pork katsu cutlet and added curry with beef to my entree. The katsu was perfectly cooked. Tender, not too much salt, and crispy breading without a large presence of grease. The beef-based curry was rich, spicy (you can pick your spiciness poison) and flavorful. It had a medium thickness so that it was slightly runny but blended  well with the rice and cutlets. The beef cubes in the curry sauce were tender and flavorful as well. I threw on some of the pickled radishes that are semi sweet and salty and it was down home comfort food awesomeness. And I'm not even from Japan. I have always liked Japanese curry and it is hard finding places that do it outside of large coast cities like LA and the Bay Area (never looked for it on the east coast). This really hit the spot. 

My son got the pork katsu donburi (rice bowl). It was excellent as well. Tender pork katsu cutlet covered with steamed egg and cooked and caramelized onions over rice with a light but flavorful teriyaki sauce. My son ate it all and I was happy to help him out with a few bites. I added some radish as a condiment. 

My bro in law got the pork katsu with a side of sausage (never seen that before) with curry. Because this place lets you customize with add one, he added corn and shredded cheese (never seen that one either). I tried some and have to say although it was not something I would have ordered it was pretty darn good. The sausage was almost like a small smoked kielbasa with a crisp snap when you bite into it. 

All in all, this place is worth a visit if you are in the Vegas Chinatown area and looking for something good and filling (not a light meal by any means).",JclJ55AFxV8X4bQFusDAnw,1,0,4,IlyPGu1Ek8_5TaYpicN_HQ

My first visit: I wasn't too impressed by their curry, in fact I thought it was a bit salty (but maybe that might have been the katsu). What I did like was that the curry already had some heat without needing to add any more spice. I enjoy piling my plate with tons of fukujinzuke and a little bit of rakkyo. The topping that I chose was chicken katsu and it was a big serving of the meat. I've experienced in places where they skimp on the size of katsu and the rest of the serving is just all curry. Overall, first visit was a 3 stars.

Second visit: Was a lot better, in my opinion. I ordered korokke with fried ebi as toppings this time. If I order the croquette all by itself it might not satisfy my hunger, but since I also added fried shrimp (which comes in three) it definitely satiated the monster living inside my belly. The curry this time tasted freakin' fantastic. Their curry is definitely for those who like 'em a little on the spicy side. Plus, you have the choice of adding more heat with the three different ""powders"" available on each table.

I was craving some Japanese Curry and thought I've give this place a try. The joint is super small, but it's as authentic Japanese Curry house as you can get. The place does get busy, so plan your meals accordingly. I went with their Chicken Katsu curry and added vegetables ($2.00) and corn ($0.50). Not that I like vegetables, but it'd give my curry an appetizing color and consistency. The super nice Japanese server asked me how spicy I wanted it and I went for the hottest, free, spicy level (anything above level 5 spicy costs extra.) Unlike other Japanese curry houses I've been to, their spicy, is effin' spicy. I could barely eat 2 bites without downing a glass of water. I ended up eating 1/3 of my curry, since I drank 3 gallons of water. My whitey counterpart co-workers struggled with level 2 spicy. Overall the food was fantastic, service was great, and the timing couldn't have been any quicker. I would definitely come back here for my Japanese curry fix. 

My street creds:
I first got into cooking & food when I was in college. After being rejected by numerous girls and getting zero action, I decided it was time for a change. I needed a new makeover to boost my geeky image. I applied for a cooking position at a Mediterranean-Italian Restaurant near my home and learned to cook all sorts of dishes.

The depth of flavor the curry base has is phenomenal! It has the perfect consistency, it's not too thick or runny.

I've been cutting carbs out lately so I avoid rice when I can, but this is one of the places that is the exception. I can't stop eating, it's just too good! 

Ordering is simple. You get to pick your rice/size, choice of meat, and toppings (I like to add cheese).  They also offer additional spices, pickled onions, radish, almonds, and raisins. I add in the hot powder, pickled onions, and radish to give it that extra kick. It sends my taste buds over the top!

I was able to indulge in the Pork Katsu Original Curry with extra Kurubota Sausage with spice level 4 and the Curry-Don which was a relatively new item on the menu. The meat in the Curry-Don was thin sliced pork and seemed to have a pretty good kick at spice level 3. 

We came a little later for lunch so didn't have to wait too long for our larger group, but service was excellent. Expect to pay $10-11 for some top-notch curry.

Pros: Solid curry, tasty, mom & pop feel

Cons: Very small venue, seats 15 people total maybe

This is a quaint place, very small though so if you aren't lucky enough to get here when its empty, then you'll expect to wait a while. The menu is very simple, easy to decide among a few dishes. They do curry and just curry and it's done well. Not amazing but very tasty. If you get a level 5 spice, that's just above comfortable for some of us who love spicy. Just a warning.

But there are essentially two tables for groups of 8, and a long ""curry bar"" that will seat another 8. So keep this in mind.

Accompanied by the curry is a wide selection of meats and vegetables including tonkatsu, kurobuta sausage, deep fried shrimp, and fried tofu. I personally order the curry with either chicken katsu or grilled chicken, occasionally with spinach. You can't go wrong with any combination, really.

The chicken katsu is made really well. When you cut or bite into it, the breading doesn't just fall apart. That separates great katsu from badly breaded chicken.

Japanese curry with Chicken Katsu is one of my all-time favorite dishes. This one was a little disappointing. I had the Chicken Katsu Curry w/ Brown Rice ($8.95). I was really pleased that brown rice was an option with no additional cost. The katsu was decent. The curry itself is what I wasn't really feeling.  The consistency and everything else about this dish was great, but the flavor wasn't what I like (or expect) in Japanese curry. It wasn't bad, but not what I want.

Also, I was really peeved that Fukujinzuke or any type of Japanese pickled vegetables were NOT set on the table or offered with your meal. I had to ask two servers because the first one seemed to have forgotten and we waited for some time. When we finally received it, they had only brought one dish for two of us.

The restaurant is fairly small though so don't plan on bringing a big group here. Perfect if you're by yourself cause you can pull up to the bar and put down some rice and curry.

The cool, soothing rice alongside the lively and warm ocean of flavor creates a dish of emotion. One can feel the love put into these edible works of art.
I ordered a vegetable curry and rice with an addition of fried tofu. A surprisingly short time later, the friendly servers brought it. Holy seacow. Instead of only a couple small pieces of fried tofu, they placed four huge ones right on the dish! Whoo-hoo! The mushrooms in the veggies deepened the curry's flavor even more. Mmmmmm!

Came here after a horrible massage next door. I ordered Katsu-Don and Katsu-Curry. I must admit, Katsu-Don has always been a favorite of mine since at a young age in Japan. It tasted just like how I remember it. Not too sweet and just perfect. The Curry, it was a bit too salty for me. But it was good. 

The Katsu was fried to perfection. Wasn't greasy or soggy. In fact it was crunchy even after the Curry was on top and Katsu Don Sauce was over it.

My friend saw this place when we all went to get a foot massage a few days prior and wanted to try them out. There were people waiting outside to dine there so that was what struck his interest. I love curry so I was down to give them a shot. Usually busy restaurants have good food and in this case, it was true. 

When we arrived, the place was busy with their lunch rush. Something we accounted for before coming because my friend had to go straight to the airport to catch his flight after lunch. It didn't take long to get seated. We had a chance to look at the menu while waiting so we knew what to order. 

I ordered the Chicken Katsu Curry with Cheese and Spinach Level 10. Portions were good but the curry wasn't spicy at all. I really enjoyed my meal even though the spice was disappointing. We washed down our meals with a couple of beers. What an awesome meal to send him off on.

I think a must topping to have with curry is cheese, almonds, and raisins.  Traditional and non traditional toppings but still makes it delicious.

There's a lot of homemade and wholesome qualities about the place and food, and it doesn't taste like the curry is oversaturated with monosodium glutamate, which is great! In fact, the curry is quite smooth - not as thick of a consistency as I am used to, but also does not have chunks of anything included. The rice is very fluffy and sticky. Their main downfall is that portion sizes are unimpressive - I can find a similar sized katsu curry dish in an Asian supermarket food court for a few dollars cheaper. Eating a full dish did satisfy me, however, but I got hungry a few hours later, and it seems like you need to include add-ons or appetizers to really complete the meal. Looking through the pricing, I did not find any add-ons or appetizers worth it.

I've tried the chicken katsu and pork katsu - chicken seemed to taste just a little better in some way - maybe it was the more varied texture and grooves of the breading. I've tried having the cheese for a topping, and it was pretty cool - it did partially melt and provided melty goodness, but it also would have more or less tasted the same without. I've tasted the curry with no spice added, and with a spice level of 4 (""blaZEN"" levels range from 1-10 and cost between 20 to 45 cents extra). Level 4 adds a good kick to it, but nothing really spicy on the tongue.

I also did not like that you have to ask for fukujinzuke for it to be included. The menu pictures show them included, and I wouldn't have even known that they had to be requested, had I not overheard someone.

I do have to make it clear to some who may not be familiar with ""Japanese Curry"" that it is NOT like Indian or Thai curry, as much as Japanese ""Ramen"" is unlike Chinese noodle bowls and such from where it originated from.  Japanese culture has a tendency to import certain things, modify them and make them their own after much time.  Curry is very commonly cooked in Japanese households, and it is almost like hamburger is to the American diet.  

The menu is simple and self explanatory on their website, so I'm not going in to details.  

As for the curry, it was was good, somewhat safe, and not overly unique, but as the only curry house in Vegas (I guess I shouldn't say that now that Kaba is not just in a truck anymore?)  I think it's better to make it not too out of the ordinary.  As for spiciness, it was mild-moderate, definitely a LOT less spicy than that at Cafe de Japon, and I am not certain whether you can ask to make it spicier or not.  

I would say that the portions are quite BIG.  Regular size with pork cutlet to make a katsu curry for example will get you quite full.  I think half size and katsu is almost enough to feed most people.  Even plain curry ($4.50, cheap!) is plenty large.

The service was quick and friendly, and for an opening day (besides from running out of desserts), they seem to be moving quite efficiently.

It is possible that all trillion of them deserve a try.  The menu is pretty focused here.  For appetizer we ordered the tako yaki, which are fried balls of mixed squid pieces, tempura bitsies and vegetables.  There is a mayo-like sauce on top.  I was not a big fan, but my husband liked it very much.  It is a very traditional Japanese street food.  
Then I ordered the spinach curry, my husband ordered the vegetable curry, and we split tofu katsu, which are panko crusted blocks of tofu.  Everything was extremely extremely delicious.

We only waited a few minutes for the table.  Other people with bigger parties were waiting longer.  There was no one really hosting guests, and there is no space inside to wait, so we all stood around for a while, until finally we started writing our names on the pad and waiting outside.

You can request the spice level you want from 1 to 10.  I ordered a 2, and it was medium spicy.  I told the waiter a 6, and he said, ""6 is not medium.  2 is medium.""  And he was right. The entrees were about $10 apiece.",3sO8B1d0NjK_3djy0Fs0lg,0,0,4,DjoGt23fHR4E1S-IhC1dYA

My boyfriend and I used to go to a Japapnese curry place in Manhattan a lot during the few months that we lived there called Go-Go Curry. They perhaps had the best Japanese curry I had ever tasted, so when we left NY, that was one of the few restaurants we thought would be hard to replace, until we found Zen Curry.

Now, the flavor is pretty spot on to our favorite curry joint in NY, only suggestion for Zen curry would be to add a little shredded cabbage to the plate. You'd be amazed what that added texture will do for the overall experience.

For the curry with chicken, I thought the plate was large in my opinion and surely should be enough to satisfy your hunger. I thought the curry was flavoured well and the chicken was tender. The chicken katsu don was also a big portion with plenty of egg and rice. I felt so bad I couldn't finish it but there was a good amount of food in that bowl. The katsu don tasted great and reminded me of homestyle cooking. 

The fried oysters came in 3 pieces and was decently priced. I absolutely love takoyaki! It was not too sweet or salty and that dish alone had a good amount of it. Takoyaki is a fun plate to share with a group of friends.

I was a little surprised you don't get the veggies in the curry that I'm used to.  Also, didn't see an option for some sort of veggie in the curry.  Guess you have to order a salad.

The parking lot is crazy too because that complex has so many good things in it. This is my first Japanese curry place in vegas and it didn't disappoint. I just wish that they have more creative combinations like curry house in la. This is very traditional, with chicken Katsu, pork Katsu, hamburger steak, and of course the add ons you want like spinach, corn, egg (not soft boiled. Hard boiled) etc. I got the chicken Katsu and it was very moist and flavorful.  My friends got the pork Katsu and hamburger steak and they both enjoyed it. Personally I think the chicken is juicer than the pork. I also had the Takoyaki balls and they were really good. It's like a friend mash potato balls with pieces of octopus in it. Sounds really weird I know but give it a try. 

If you cant eat spicy beware of even ordering a 2. It definitely has a kick to it. The scale is 1 through 10 but a 5 is super super spicy according to the waiter. The one thing I don't like about this place is that they don't automatically give you the pickled radish. If you ask they gave you a small portion of it. I had to ask 3 times cause I love that stuff.

Chicken Katsu Curry, spicy level 3, with one order of quail egg kushi, and one extra scoop of rice.

The food is spot on and delicious! Not only is the food good, the customer service is awesome. The cooks, servers, etc are all very polite and sincere, and all of them being able to greet and farewell in the Japanese tongue adds just that bit more of authenticity.

The BF and I split our meat toppings of a pork katsu and a tofu cutlet. Pork katsu was crisp and still juicy (which a lot of pork katsus are not). Tofu cutlet was crisp, but still light and was of the silky/soft tofu variety which I much prefer over firm kinds. Curry itself was pretty decent though standard. It's solid for here, but not the best I've had though. I like all the garnishes they set on your table which some curry houses do not do...At least for me, I've never noticed raisins and almonds at other places. Not their fault, but I wish they had my favorite curry topping : an egg. It would really make me a fan. Something about curry rice and egg is perfect. 

We had the coffee jello which was nice, and refreshing to the palette after curry. Halfway eating the waitress asked if we would like more cream for the jello which was a small, but very considerate touch. Really, she was kind and attentive throughout.

After trying curry at maybe 2 or 3 spots, I decided to check out Zen Curry.  Not gonna lie, I was slightly disappointed.

I was surprised they didn't serve gyoza and didn't have the meat combinations set up together but you can just add it on if you want. If you haven't had curry it's like spiced gravy but thicker. Very delicious and comforting. You can also choose white or brown rice which is a nice option.

So we walked over and browsed the menu, checked Yelp! and went on in. We were lucky that it wasn't too busy. We were seated promptly by Jason Kim and were served our beverages immediately. The quaintness of the curry shop was GREAT. My friends and I are always looking for comfortable restaurants with welcoming atmospheres. The chef and owner came and greeted us personally which I felt was rare in most restaurants. 

I ordered the pork cutlet curry with potato croquette, and Di had the chicken cutlet with potato croquette. The curry was delicious and they had everything you needed to customize to your preference! They had their own mild blend of spices, the medium, the spicy, raisins, and almonds. The service was very prompt and since the restaurant is small, it felt very personal. The prices are awesome too, I think we paid about $10 for each plate.

Since I had seen on Yelp! that someone else recommended trying their specials... I came back several days later to try the Spinach Curry. I LOVED that they were consistent with the flavor and texture of the curry. I also tried their Curry Pan.. which is a fried pastry with a bit of their curry. IT IS AWESOME!

My Hawai'i friends were in town and this is their fave place for Japanese Curry in Vegas! It was my first time here, I'm not usually a fan of curry (had a bad experience) but when I tried Curry Zen it was onoliscious and I surprisingly, cleaned my plate! 

I got the curry with spinach and scrambled eggs and brown rice. It comes with a few slices of tomato as well. The curry for this plate is a darker color than the usual brown that's served with the other curry plates. I'm keeping it healthy these days, so I'm glad I saw this vegetarian option on the menu! I enjoyed it and like I said I cleaned off all the curry on my plate. It was flavorful. The brown rice was cooked well too and went well with the spinach and curry. 

I also appreciated the health benefits of spices in their curry, listed on their menu.  And they use a vegetable broth for their curry. I wish I had seen the mixed multi grain rice, I would've ordered that instead of the brown rice. 

Had the fried gyoza as well, and it was just okay. I've had better, but nothing bad about this one.

I have to say, if one were to compare them to Thai, Indian, or other curries I've had in the past, Japanese curry seemed more bland and thick, almost like a gravy.

They had plenty of seasoning shakers on the table though, so a few sprinkles of extra hot woke up the dish, and it was very enjoyable!

We tried a little bit of everything here, with Cathy ordering the Pork cutlet, Chicken Cutlet, Kurobuta Sausage and Croquette for us to try. It was cooked well, with lots of juicy meat and great flavor in the breading.

I really enjoyed my Chicken Katsu Curry with spicy level 2 since I cant really eat spicy food. Anyway, it was perfect to my liking and the katsu was large and the meat was very tender. Curry was very simple but had the taste of curry and it wasnt missing anything though it just looks BROWN.

Upon arriving I came in with a group of seven, we were placed right in the middle of the restaurant. We waited for about ten to fifteen minutes before ordering and I ordered the Chicken Katsu with an addition of sausage. I did not get any spicy level because it being my first time I wanted to taste the curry itself. We waited for another fifteen minutes until our food came and we still didn't have our napkins/ eating utensils. So when we asked for that and the pickled ginger we didn't touch our food probably until eight minutes after it came out. Service was a bit slow in the beginning but our server was very nice. 

The food is a 3/5. Like I have mentioned before, I go out to eat especially to new places to determine if their food is worthy of being unique, meaning I wouldn't be able to replicate back at home. However, this curry was something that I knew I or my family could make at home. Of course it was good but there wasn't anything that stood out to me. Their chicken katsu was the same as well as their sausages. I paid about $3 extra for three pieces of sausages. Towards the end I didn't finish eating my curry because the rice/ curry ratio was completely off. There were more curry and meat itself than rice so that was frustrating. I pushed the curry to the side to see where the rice line ended and it didn't cover at least half the plate, it was about 1/4 of it. The food was overall okay, I just wished my rice ratio and sausage portion was bigger and the curry stood out opposed to thinking about ""I could make this at home"" type of thought. Calculating my bill without tip it came out to about $16. The plate is big but with the actually quality in the curry plates it does not break even to the amount you pay vs. what you get. Waiting for our checks and paying alone took longer than us eating, which we were confused about.

My bro-in-law got the chicken cutlet with white rice, cheese and corn which he annihilated in a few minutes!  The curry was spicier than what I'm used to (I'm a wimp when it comes to spicy food) but I didn't mind.

Food
-katsu curry- yum, the curry goes great with katsu and rice. I like how the katsu isn't breaded too thickly. The only drawback is they don't give you that much katsu, and there are no vegetables. 
-katsu don- good flavor with a decent amount of food. Meat was a little dry though 
-tako yaki- yum

Service- service is usually good, friendly waiters who do their best to accommodate you. I like how they split the bill for you. 

Environment- nice and clean, fair amount of tables. Parking lot is small and crowded though.

It is a blessing and a curse that I hate the parking situation of the plaza it's in or else I would be eating here far too often. The parking lot has the potential of being a pain based on the hour of the day; however, the food here is definitely worth.

It's a cozy, small restaurant. There have been times when there's a wait; however, the maximum time that I've waited was fifteen minutes and a majority of the time, we were seated immediately. Please note that every time that I've been here, it was for lunch. The service is always super friendly and fast!

I can't lie and say that I've tried and loved everything on the menu simply because I order the same thing every single time - chicken katsu curry with the spice level at three. The portion is fair and fills me up about halfway through the meal. The chicken is crispy and goes so, so well with the curry sauce and rice. You can pick and choose your toppings with their popular ones being corn and cheese, but I love a fried egg on top!

One of the waitresses goes up to the couples and seats them completely ignoring me.  At this point I'm furious for having to drive across town to just be ignored. After seating them, they continue to ignore me until I finally go up to one of them and ask to speak to a manager. This waitress completely disregards my question and simply says ""How can I help you?""  I tell her I called earlier about my order being incomplete and she walks away to get my order. Finally the server comes back with my meal but I ask her that I think it would be fair if they give me a sort of credit for all the trouble they had put me through, she struggles to understand what I'm saying (there may have been a language barrier) and says no. She then calls another server to help (I'm assuming the manager). The next server is quite nice and provides me with an extra order for all the trouble, I then thank her and leave. I finally get home and when eating my curry I come to find out that it is extremely spicy though I had ordered no spice (level 3). So I end up having to throw my meal away because I tend to get sick from eating food that is too spicy. I feel as if they purposely did this for asking for some sort of compensation, which I think is ridiculous after everything they put me through.

The portions are more than reasonable and often filling. The flavor is the main reason why I keep coming back. For someone who boldly states his dislike for any dish, I will continue to try it until someone proves me wrong. Maybe I just had bad versions in the past. That is not the case here.

Holy Buddha is this curry legit!  The broth contains more spices than Snoop Lion's tour bus, and each has health benefits if you're to believe the back of the menu and table displays.   I believe! The first time I went with what Tetsuro P proclaimed to be the best item there which was the pork cutlet.  I also added spinach and requested brown rice.  Each and every piece of pork was perfectly cooked, juicy and flavorful.   The spinach sopped up lots of the broth and the combination of all the components on the plate was a revelation.  Even better, they provide several additional fixings at no cost including raisins, almonds, and some japanese pickled veggies.   I tried incorporating each and every one in different ways and I'm not exaggerating when I say every single bite was delicious.  You couldnt mess this broth up if you TRIED.  Next time I'm bringing some durian and gummy bears and dropping them in and seeing what happens.   Odds are it'll still be delicious.   On the 2nd visit I tried the Beef, and it was as good as I expected even if I preferred the pork cutlet overall.   

As an added bonus the service is incredible.   Greeted warmly when I enter, making sure no drink or side is ever empty, and a gracious goodbye upon exiting.   It doesn't get any better

This was my first experience with Japanese curry and it didn't disappoint.

Parking in this area isn't the greatest. There's a large quantity of restaurants in the area and we had to search out a spot. Once inside, it took maybe five minutes for a table to open up, which was better than expected. It's a smaller restaurant so I could see them being pretty busy at times. 

The food was great. I got the curry udon and tried some of my friends katsudon. The curry udon had a great flavor. I would definitely get that again but I'd probably get a side of rice to go with it to mix up the flavors and textures a little next time. The Katsudon was delicious. It was cooked perfectly and had this kind of sweet but not normal sweet taste to it that I loved. Also something I would definitely get again.

I wanted to try some of the appetizers as well, but figured the portions would be a good size. One appetizer to 3-4 people would probably make more sense unless you are local or are in a hotel where you can take leftovers with you.",2KquSGfWJt9g0_CoQ1X82A,0,0,5,qasW7eG2zmpDj3LuAIC7jw

They offer an array of meat to accompany your curry, or you can opt for a simple curry sauce and rice. Zen is located in the same complex where Monta Ramen is. If you don't know about Monta...yelp. 

There is a base price of 5.95 and price goes up depending what and how many items you add into your curry. The great thing about this place is that they do have vegeterian selections, and they also offer side dishes/appetizers such as takoyaki, deep fried oysters, shumai, edamame, and much more but my photographic memory failed me.

Today, we ordered 2 of the chicken katsu curry, deep fried shumai, and a spam curry. My son loves spam so of course he had to order it. The spam slices came out really thick, think he only had three slices of it, but again...they were pretty thick of a cut. I shared my katsu plate with my 6 year old so we ordered an extra scoop of rice. I love curry; I just don't enjoy the heavy feeling. Sharing with my son was the perfect portion for both of us. The chicken katsu itself was delightful. It was perfectly crisped, the meat didn't look ""dead"" inside (you know...that dry old chicken look),  and the fact that it isn't seasoned at all or heavily season is also a plus to me, because it'll be chillin on top of curry sauce anyway. As well all know...curry has enough depth, the extra sodium on a breaded chicken would be unnecessary. 1 thing I did wish is that my curry sauce came out a little bit more hot temperature wise. It was more like lukewarm. I'm just one of those people who love seeing steam come from my plate. It's confirmation to me my food is coming out fresh. Hell, it could've been microwaved for all I know if there were steam, but I wouldn't know--I just know I want it to look like it came fresh out the pot.

It was busy when we arrived, but we did not have to wait at all. We came in on a Tuesday afternoon, but twas Veteran's day so perhaps twas the reason for a full house? The facility was very clean. The waitresses were attentive. We did have to ask for our waters to get refilled at the end of our meal, but two refills prior to that they came without question. Tables kinda sit close to each other as the facility isn't big. So no nasty talk unless you want the people next to you joining in. Lol. I don't recommend bringing a stroller in there as well. I didn't have mine, but when I walked in I thought thank goodness I didn't bring it in. Kinda figured considering we are on Spring Mountain and such eateries along it don't offer plenty of stroller room anyway. 

For my family of 6 our bill came out into a whopping 32bucks, that's with tax. Can't say the same for others because I still have kids that are in the sharing zone. Good deal to us.

Every time, their sauce has been hearty, savory, with that bit of sweetness that makes Japanese curry different from the rest. 

There's just one thing that gripes me about this place and it's most likely due to their recent wild success. When I used to come back in the day in their tiny little hole-in-the-wall type of restaurant, my chicken always came consistently. However these days, it seems as though my chicken comes somewhat dry. It's not largely noticeable, nor is it huge enough to complain loudly about, but coming from one of my favorite curry houses ever, it's something I wish would always stay the same. 

My favorite curry house of all-time will always be CoCo ICHIBANYA, a popular curry house from Japan that landed its way to some parts in the states. I particularly like their sauce just a bit more and I love that they have naan bread to dip in the sauce. 

I request that Curry Zen brings in the naan bread and I will come running every time.",9E_LCRdvbhUAEgXa8VpGYg,7,7,4,G4YrZM4dS5JFzk3v8wiaZQ
5519414,2016-08-28,0,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"I would consider myself a regular here, coming here mostly during lunch breaks. My usual go-to order is a chicken katsu curry with spinach. The spinach adds an additional different flavor to the curry itself, and with its texture mixed with that of the chicken and rice together makes a great combo. The food usually comes out pretty quick, and the services is often very good. I've only had one bad experience with the service recently. I had ordered my usual, chicken katsu with spinach. However, the order that came out was only a plate of rice with spinach, no chicken. So I had let them know, and they apologized and brought out a separate plate of chicken katsu. But that process even took much longer than it should have. It might have been the service herself who made the mistake, because at times I would see new faces taking orders. This experience doesn't hinder me from going back, because it's a great place for Japanese curry, probably the best in town. Love it here, would go back for more lunches to come.",Sl8weP49PZG2VeWqU2yf-g,2,1,5,_9MTg9I7CT8iaCEIOWuETQ

Apparently that's also the case for many Japanese in town including the owner of Cafe de Japon who we bumped into and had the pleasure of dining with.  He got natto with his curry.  I didn't know that was something Japanese did?  I think natto is super gross but I guess drowning it in rich curry sauce would be the most acceptable way for me to scarf it down.  

Most of the meat options are breaded and fried with the exception of the kurobuta sausage.  I got the pork katsu with cheese and my wife went with chicken katsu and cheese.  Both were excellent and terrific portions.  I also liked how they offered almonds, raisins, sweet onions and pickles on the side.  I'd never put almonds on my curry before but it made for great texture.  I ate a ton of onions since that went really well with the crunch and juiciness of the pork.    

I would like to see a few more options for curry including a straight up beef option and maybe an unfried chicken too but that's not a big thing.

5543391,2014-10-18,3,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"PLEASE EAT HERE! ????????????
Ok so I rarely give 5 stars and especially rarely give it for a Japanese restaurant in the US.... That's mainly because my wife is Japanese (from japan) and I of course lived there for 7 yrs... We've actually only been back in the US for about 2 weeks ... So Japanese food (real) is still fresh on our pallets. 
So those of you that know me, know that CoCoIchibanya is my absolute #1-2-3-4-5 favorite restaurant of allllllll time. ???????????????????????
So when we found this spot on Yelp, Sakino recommend we try it as she knows I'm missing curry, specifically CoCos.. When in Hawaii, I drag her there. When in LA, I drag her there. When at our home in Okinawa... Well that's home so I can't drag her anywhere lol, but she lets me go like once a week! 
So of course I'm feeling a little standoffish about this place... Most of our American Japanese dining experiences thus far have been ehhhh.... So in we go.
Right off the bat, they have that CoCoIchi yellowish colored menu...  Ok. Then I notice something, everyone in this place (staff) is actually Japanese, and speaking Japanese! This please my wife and I a lot... Sounds silly I know but it's kinda rare to have actual Japanese people that speak Japanese in a Japanese restaurant in America. And they were legit, when my wife conversed with them they didn't skip a beat or look lost. Plus 1 pt for these guys! ???????so then I order.. Old faithful. Chicken katsu curry with cheese level 2. Exactly as I would a CoCos... Sakino ordered the same only level 3. 
So, what I will tell you is this: if you know and love CoCos, this place WILL DO JUST FINE! Is it better? No. Is it pretty much equal? Ehhhh yea sure. Point is for Vegas, this place is basically CoCos, which earns it a 5 star for me... The food is great, the service is great and authentic... Point in case, we come in and Sakino (my wife) sees a young Japanese waitress... She keeps staring and telling me hey hey doesn't she look so familiar? I'm like yea I guess. Sakino was like you know when I was an exchange student at University of Hawaii, I swear that waitress was also a student there on exchange from mainland Japan! I'm like sure I guess but I don't remember babe... So my wife is like ok, after we eat I'll ask her... Well before that even happens, the young girl walks over and is like omg hey remember me from Hawaii etc etc... Turns out it IS Misakichan and she is HERE going to school now... And not only that, today was her first day at this job! What a crazy coincidence that a girl from Okinawa, a girl from mainland Japan, both exchange student to Hawaii, 2yrs later bump into each other at a curry house in Las Vegas? Wtf?! Point is, the people here are great. They are authentic as it gets, and the food is ON POINT! Large for me small for her, 2 drinks, plus tip.. $25 total... Which by the way, is exactly what I'd pay at CoCoIchi.... These guys here at Zen Curry in Vegas are onto something... If the local Air Force guys here that have been stationed at Kadena AFB ever find out.. This place will be packed! 
Please please please ... Check this place out! So worth it

SERVICE & LOCATION
Quick and friendly service, as with any respectable Japanese curry place. I would be annoyed if they were fancy and asked me about my day! Just tryin' to shovel some spice level 5 in without small talk. The venue itself is pretty plain and unassuming, and a tad bit cramped.

FOOD
Ahh, the star of the show is of course their curry. Fragrant, filling, and can be made to an obnoxiously spicy level. (They charge you above level 2, I think). You can customize it with toppings or choose from premade sets. I personally like vegetable curry with potato croquette! (I heard you liked carbs, so we took carbs, wrapped it in carbs... deep fried!)

Chicken kushiage is kind of dry but the zucchini is delicious. Oh, and the side salad is somehow super addicting.

The place is kinda small and the ""waiting list"" is just a sheet of paper you have to write your own name on and they'll call you when there's a table ready.  
It's just west of Decatur on Spring Mountain. It's in the same shopping center as Monta Ramen, Kung Fu Tea, and Raku. 

I'd never had japanese curry before.  I got the chicken katsu+curry spicy level 2+corn+cheese. I left a $4 tip and the total was $15.52.  I can see why this is crave-worthy.  The only thing I can compare it to is curry-wurst in Germany.  It's like a thick brown gravy with curry in it.  The chicken was fried perfectly in a panko coating but was incredibly bland.  Maybe it's supposed to be like that to balance the strong curry.  The rice was wonderfully sticky and the cheese made the whole dish feel comforting.  

Level 2 spicy was just enough...my white girl palette can only handle so much.  It would be really good with french fries I bet.  I liked it and I'd eat it again.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,4,2,4,yzi9t21Cm7q9hQFo1qy_2A

I can't wait to take my husband because I know he will love it, too!

Their curry  reminds me of  a famous Japanese curry chain called CoCo Ichiban, which is my favorite curry restaurant in Japan.

I had chicken katsu (chicken cutlet) curry, which was always my favorite at CoCo.  Their secret curry sauce is prepared from scratch, and I was so impressed that theirs was as good as CoCo's! I had been missing this so much!

Along with basic curry,  you can add toppings of your choice from chicken cutlet, pork cutlet, deep fried shrimp, croquette, yakiniku beef, sausage and more. I always like chicken katsu on my curry, but other people were saying pork katsu was good, too. I think the spice level is about 4 out of 10, not too spicy, not too mild, but you can add more spice if you like.

The price was reasonable. Curry with 1 or 2 toppings(which I think is enough), is less than $10. Sometimes Japanese portions are too small, but theirs was big enough and I felt very satisfied after the meal.

I could spend days explaining the taste of this place, and it would not compare to the experience at all. This place is simply magnificent. The quality, the presentation and the flavor are out of this world and to top that the service , courtesy and warmth of the servers and chefs make this one of my new favorite spots.

5752752,2014-08-21,1,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"So apparently this little strip mall called Seoul Plaza is the Asian Food mecca of Las Vegas...  There are no less than 5 outstanding restaurants in this mall according to Yelp - the already famous Raku; Kabuto which some claim is the best sushi in town; the unique-in-Vegas Trattoria Nakamura-Ya; Monta Ramen which had lines waiting to be seated; Big Wong's representing Asian street food culture, and the little gem that is Japanese Curry Zen.  I guess jury is still out on Chung Gi Wa, a Korean restaurant that translates to Blue Roof, since I can't find a Yelp review on it.

We were really looking for a donkatsu place (can anyone suggest a good one in Vegas?), and found this place around the corner from where we were.  Not exactly a katsu joint, but we like curry so decided to give it a try.  4.5 stars on 270+ reviews can't be wrong, right?  Well, the only thing I'm wondering at this point is - what happened to the other .5 star?  Because honestly this is the best curry I've ever had.  I am quickly realizing that Vegas has L.A. beat when it comes to Japanese food not named sushi.  Only if Udon West (NYC joint with the absolute greatest gyu don ever)  came to the West...

Anyway, upon walk-in you are greeted by practically everyone working there - including the older gentleman behind the counter who appears to be the owner-chef.  The all-male crew is super friendly, attentive, and speedy.  The décor is simple clean.  Domestic beer is $2.50.  Off to a good start.  We order a curry pan, a katsu curry and a shrimp curry.  Curry pan comes in literally 2 minutes, and it's piping hot (on a side note, I realized then that ""pan"" is Japanese for bread - which I should have guessed because ""ppang"" is Korean for bread...).  And this thing is AMAZING good.  Koreans call this croquette, but none that I've had in a Korean bakery comes anywhere close to this little piece of addiction.  I should have gotten 3 more of these and called it a day.  But then, I would have missed out on their equally amazing curry.

The curry dishes come 5 minutes later, and I'm initially a bit disappointed.  3 smallish pieces of fried shrimp with a lot of rice and curry sauce.  A smallish piece of donkatsu with a lot of rice and curry sauce.  No side dishes, veggies, nothing.  At $9.50 per, I was expecting Wako size I guess.  I force myself to recall that Curry House was $15, and this is not a bad deal.  A bite of the shrimp with rice on curry sauce and I'm convinced this is a good deal.  Perfectly fried shrimp and pork with perfectly cooked rice smothered in the BEST curry sauce ever.  And 20 minutes after I've completely forgotten how small the meats were, I am full and fully satisfied.  One word of warning:  they have spicy scale of 1-10, and they recommend a 3 for those who like spicy food.  I would heed those recommendations!

So after a beer, bottle of water, appetizer and two main dishes, we get a bill for under $27.  Okay, this is a great deal.  We're coming back here over and over.  But in between, we'll have to resist the temptation and also try Raku, Kabuto, Monta, Nakamura-Ya, and Big Wong's.  Maybe Chung Gi Wa too.

Table-for-1 Factor:  There is a bar with half-dozen or so seats, behind which is where the cooking happens.  I think it's perfect for eating solo.",52Oq0fCJWaHpQtuKqTkN4g,6,5,5,LlvYSztgrluptEge45GPDA

They had the standard Japanese curry menu with a decent amount of curry selections. I ordered the pork katsu curry, which was fairly priced at around $10, although I was tempted to order the tenderloin pork katsu. The pork katsu was really good, though nothing that exceptional and well breaded.  The curry was flavorful and sweet, though not overly.  You are able to order various levels of curry which range from .20+ depending on the level of spiciness on a scale of 1-10.  I ordered 5, which is actually pretty spicy and cost 40cents more.  If you're looking for a well rounded med spicy level, go with 3 or 4 instead.

1, Proteins (chicken/beef/shrimp/kurobata sausage/etc) or some awesome combination using everything. (That's what I would do if I came back - have a Japanese curry plate sampler!) 
2. Spice level (1-10) 
3. Free tableside condiments (red pickles, raisins, pickled onions, ginger, curry and spice powders) Customize to your liking. 

I ordered the PORK KATSU CURRY LEVEL 5 ($9.5) and the flavor was on point. CRAVE WORTHY. Rich and complex with out being too soupy or sweet. Perfect spice level for me. (Kaba curry is more on the sweeter side). The katsu was flavorful and crisp. They just cooked it a minute longer which made it a little dry. Same with the chicken katsu, but still very good.

Notes
-The place is small with like 4 tables (of 4) and a counter top so I could imagine this place easily getting busy. Not really good for groups larger than 4. 
-Came on a Saturday for lunch right when they opened at 11:30am and we were the 3rd group there. 
-Have your curry topped with cheese. So good. 

Would definitely have this on rotation if I lived closer.

I could have made a better one at home with a pre-made curry base. Even my mother in law from Japan stated that it tasted like they used pre-made powder to make the curry. The dish was not presentable either. The dish looked really plain. They didn't serve any side salad like Curry House, which they serve a small side salad and corn soup along with the curry. The service was not great either. When we arrived, we waited for over 30 minutes for a table of 3 even though there was a table of 2 open, which I didn't think we would be seated there anywase because it would not fit all three of us. When a table opened up, they split the table to serve the 3 of us and a group of 4 people that came much later. They seated us on a table that was originally for only 2 people while the group behind us sat at a bigger table that seated for 4. My husband mentioned that they could have just seated us at the other small table of 2 that was open the whole time we waited the 30 minutes rather than wait 30 minutes to be seated at a different small table of 2. We asked why we couldn't have the bigger table for 4 even though we had 3 people and they responded that they wanted to seat the bigger group at the same time as us. We waited over 30 minutes for our seats while this other group that literally came through the door waited no more than 5 minutes. I also didn't like how the waiters had to squeeze past my seat to get to the other tables because I was seated on the side of the small tiny table that was really only for table of 2. I had to squeeze myself as close to the table as possible for the waiters to have some space to pass me. I really tried my best even though I was pregnant. We had a difficult time eating at this small table with our big plates. I'm pretty clumsy so I'm glad that I didn't drop my dish or water.

I've has the tofu katsu, pork katsu, and chicken katsu here. My favorite out of the 3 is the tofu katsu!. The curry is very flavorful. It's savory and packs a lot of heat! You can also get a non spicy curry.

There aren't many specialty restaurants in Vegas that have Japanese curry as their selling point and that's why I think Curry Zen is good for Vegas. It is unique and it is different from what we already have here. If you've never tried Japanese curry before, I say go here for your first time. The curry sauce is creamy and very tasteful and the way they cook their meat is perfection. This is definitely authentic Japanese curry. I've been to Japan a few times before and when I eat curry there, it reminds me of Curry Zen and makes me miss the restaurant. They have a bigger selection of Japanese curry now (as compared to when they started when they only have about 10-15 dishes) so you'll definitely find something that you like. The customer service here is as good as it gets as well. Sure, it gets busy from time to time and they forget to refill your water but you can see genuine smiles from the server that never seem to disappear. The owners also walk around to see how you are doing, which I think makes it such a personal and inviting restaurant. 

They have a nice selection of desserts and non-curry food as well, so if you're not into Japanese curry, you can always try other selections that they have.

All in all, Curry Zen is definitely worth a shot. If you've never been here before, try it. I'm sure you'll be a regular like me before you know it.",gvs53lmnU-rwlwjOGstMFw,1,1,5,hQ732Juj1mVX07vWi_KrOQ

I always do a happy dance inside when I encounter this..

Just like in Japan, most restaurants the menu's are small and specialize in one type of dish; in this case curry. 

Food Breakdown:
I ordered tonkatsu curry. 
The curry sauce itself is legit Japanese curry and was mild in spice and flavor. 
They did offer pepper and other spices if you wanted to give it more oomph. This was different from the typical Nihon Curry-ya where they would ask you your spice (pain) tolerance level and add oomph accordingly. Boo on that :( 
The curry had no sustenance; just sauce. A little carrots, onions or meat in the sauce would've gone a long way in my book. 

I don't mind paying good money for good food however at a pricepoint of $9 for katsu curry it fell short and I left hungry.

I went with their dish that did not have curry. I can't recall the name right now but it was a pork katsu bowl with rice, eggs, seaweed and ginger. I loved the ginger in the bowl. Barely any seaweed. And the scrambled egg, was somewhere in between cooked and not cooked. No complaints from me though, I thought at first I can dig this. 

Then I had to dig out a piece of a hair that was embedded in my pork katsu. It was mixed in with the batter surrounding the pork and it never seemed to end. I didn't complain. I just pushed my bowl to the side and ate no more.

Overall, I left feeling disgusted and sad. Even with the hair experience, me and my coworker said we would return but only to try to the Curry. I am not just not sure how fast that is going to happen for me.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,16,10,2,Ycble95QCdiwStZ8OtjFHw

5939233,2012-12-05,16,ZAuAwz1ijuydn5yL3q3rzA,"I believe you need a lot of sophistication to enjoy Japanese Curry. It's just these small little differences with the spices that separates  a J-Curry place from being ""good"" and ""great"". And, I believe that JAPANESE CURRY ZENBAYASHI has achieved Greatness. 

This is a rare Japanese restaurant where they pay attention to the smallest details. For example, today the Rakkyo was perfectly cut in a distinct geometric style, which made every single piece look identical in size and shape. At first, I thought I was seeing things but eventually after watching Mr. Zenbayashi working so carefully in the kitchen, I came the conclusion that they spend hours before the store opens preparing everything to look beautiful and artistic.

Unlike similar restaurants, JCZ will refrigerate the condiments such as Tonkatsu Sauce, Rakkyo, and Fukujinzuke. They wait till a customer arrives and then they bring them out with new clean serving spoons. Other places around town will merely keep the condiments sitting out on the table all day long with the same serving spoons which had been touched by many dirty hands. But, you won't find that problem here. This is the most spotless and clean restaurant I have seen in Las Vegas.  Even the bathroom looked like no one had ever used it. 

Just like INABA, this place prides itself on having a dish that not only tastes great, but has tons of health benefits. They have a homemade Gram Masala which is a combination of about 15 spices such as Turmeric, Coriander, Black Pepper, Cumin, Cardamom, Fennel, Japanese Chili Pepper, Ginger, Garlic, Paprika, and many more. Unlike Indian Curry, J-Curry is lower in calories and fat content. It also has anti-oxidents, digestive benefits, blood cleansing, and even anti-aging benefits. 

I actually came here by accident today, I spent most of the day loitering at Jen G's place of work.  After about 3 hours of bugging her, she told me to ""BUY SOMETHING OR GET OUT!"", so I went straight to JCZ! ...Just kidding. Actually, the true story does involve me loitering at Jen G's place of employment, but we had a conversation about Kabuto, and both of us agreed we should go there and give it another try. I actually didn't like my last visit to Kabuto on account of being spoiled by Urusawa in LA. But, I ended up going over there anyway  to make a reservation. While I was in the parking lot, I noticed the JCZ sign.  David Y had recommended the place to me earlier, and he told me that it was exactly what he used to get in Japan, so I gave it a try. And Dave was right, it was the best. I don't know why people would rather eat at overrated Monta when JAPANESE CURRY ZEN is only a 15 second walk. And the best part of JCZ is that it doesn't have a 2 hour waiting list, uncomfortable seating, overflowing toilet, hipsters and emos reciting poetry, and non-japanese cooks who cook the eggs in the back alley(read my review on Monta to understand that better). And that's another thing that makes JCZ great, it's 100% Japanese staffed. Sure, I actually know Chinese and Filipino Sushi Chefs who make some Japanese ones look like amateurs, but the point is that it's always so unique to find a J-restaurant that is 100% Japanese staffed.

The best thing on the menu is the Pork Tenderloin Curry. Do not confuse this with the normal Pork Cutlet. The Pork Tenderloin Curry will not be on the main menu. You have to ask for it specifically. Today, the cook put so much attention into making sure the cutlet was fried perfectly. The color was beautifully golden brown, and the texture of the meat was so juicy and soft that I ended up eating it all in less than 5 minutes. 

This was the best service I have ever had as a 1st timer. Sure, there are some Japanese owned restaurants that treat me better, but that's because I've spent a lot of money there. For example, when I walk into ""Sushi on Rainbow"", it's like that scene in ""Goodfellas"" when Robert De Niro walks into the club and everyone knows his name, they open the door for him, save him  his usual seat, and everyone gets whatever he wants before he even has to ask. That's how good some places treat me because I show up regularly, I treat older Japanese workers with a lot of respect,  and because I'm f*cking rich I tend to leave giant tips. But, even though this was my first time at JAPANESE CURRY ZEN, they already were treating me like I had spent over $1000 here. And of course, even though I only spent like $10.00 on curry I left a $20 tip. And the server earned every penny of that because it really was the best service I've had in years. 

JAPANESE ZEN CURRY is a small independent business, not a million dollar bankrolled J-restaurant. Even though there is a rumor that this place is owned by the Mon-group, the server told me that it's just not true. This is a small business that needs the support of the Japanese-American community here in Las Vegas. So, I encourage all LV Japanese residents to come try this place out and support them.",JM0GL6Dx4EuZ1mprLk5Gyg,29,26,5,5YNnpSoOlcLoC0s9hgi34w

The photos of white rice and brown curry on plain white plates did not stimulate my appetite (slightly unappetizing looking), however, those 150 Yelpers before me could not all be wrong. For our late lunch, we shared a regular-size order of rice and curry (spice level 0) with the 5 piece Kushi Curry option. I'm not sure of the ""right"" way to eat curry, so I mixed together the rice and curry slurry and dug in. Mmm. Wow, it's really very yummy, a fantastic combination of spices. The skewers of fried goodies were all pretty good too. I really liked the potato croquette. It was something like mashed potatoes rolled in an egg mixture and coated with panko, then lovingly lowered it into the deep fryer. The panko-coated fried quail eggs were slightly rubbery and had a green-grey tinge around the yolk, but no biggie. Most people boil the heck out of eggs. 

Yelp did me right. Thank you!
