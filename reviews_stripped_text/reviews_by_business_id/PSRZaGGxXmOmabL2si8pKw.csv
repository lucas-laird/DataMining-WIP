The service is great, the food is fantastic, and perfect place for dates or big crowds or just because. As for the prices (ranging from $10 to $20) it is really reasonable because the serving is good for two people. They have signature dishes if you do not know which one you want to try. But surely enough if you like this place as much as I do you will definitely come back for more. 

I highly recommend trying the Chicken Bryan, Pollo Rosa Maria, Pasta Weesie, Lobster Ravioli, Linguine Pescatore, all are delicious and will satisfy your stomach. Every meal comes with soup or salad, the soup's are all delicious, especially with the cheese they put. The bread they serve before the meal is delicious because it's fresh and warm.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,0,5,DNfonfdl9yfnvkiyYN6tqQ

My boyfriend and I decided to do the special Monday menu that included an app/dessert, soup or salad then our choice of entree. We started with the calamari which was good. Then had our salads which came with an awesome house cream parm dressing which was amazing (beware, lots of garlic!) !!! To follow, my boyfriend LOVED his lasagna & I had a great shrimp + scallop dish with a side of pasta in their vodka tomato cream sauce. Everything was delicious and we even ended with a strawberry cheesecake that was divine!

426043,2007-12-07,0,PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw,"This place is recommended fairly highly mostly for how the meal starts out.

They bring out oil and warm bread but they sprinkle spices on a small plate before pouring the oil.  It is a simple but the best olive oil and bread combination I have had at any Italain restaurant.

They have 2 outstanding appetizers:  the Scotty Thompson and calamari with red sauce.  They have another sauce but it's not good.  The Scotty Thompson is off-menu and not always available.  It is a simple bruschetta with cheese and red sauce that is surprisingly good.

Their soups are good to outstanding.  My favorite is the spicy sausage and lentil but it's not always available.  Their soups are better than their salads.  The house is bland and the Ceasar's not much better.

When it comes to entrees they drop off a bit.  B&B and Circo are better but their steak and double pork chop marsalas are pretty good.  

For 2 people who share an appetizer and don't get wine, you can keep it under $60 including the tip.  We have never gotten to dessert because we are stuffed by then.  As a value, it is definitely recommended.",DBzVCu2k2z-l5nl0rbVqmg,1,1,4,F_dZTLsvWqFuHuSgp1AQvQ

Good house salad with parm dressing that I've had with a grilled chicken breast as an entree and yummy warm bread dipped in marinara sauce upon request.  Fried calamari is always a winner.  Go on Wednesdays where you get $10 off on pitchers of wine.  Get gift cards at Smith's for twice the Smith's bonus points.  Sign up for Amici Club and they will send you coupons for dollars off.

The Mediterranean Salad (lunch menu) is the best salmon salad in town. The owner, Lindsay, actually cares about training her staff properly to provide a level of great customer service that is really rare among most restaurants in town. Her manager, JT went the extra mile last night, no questions asked. 
Our server was new. It was obvious. He was very nice but he screwed up one entree on our order. They took it back and proceeded to make it right. However, when it came out, it still wasn't right (6 oz. steak instead of 9 oz.) Not a big deal but wrong. JT came to the rescue. Not only did he comp my meal, he prepared a second one that had the right size steak, comped that one too, and also comped my wife's dinner, which had no problems. They value their customers and it shows.
We have eaten there hundreds of times. We have had big parties there. I can count the not up to par issues on one hand. Every time, they make it right (or better than right). While I sympathize with the negative reviewers, I think their problems are isolated incidents. No one is perfect. The key is to take care of the guests when little problems arise. Had these reviewers brought it to the attention of management, their issues would have been resolved. 
We ALWAYS get spectacular customer care, and the food is ALWAYS at least a 98% - usually 100%. ALWAYS fresh, not frozen, not processed.

I ordered baked ravioli with lemon butter sauce (yummmmm) my problem is that didn't give enough sauce at all. Barley covered the ravioli. 

I also asked for a side of Alfredo... I was charged $5.41 for barley 2oz of Alfredo sauce. I knew it would cost I believe I was told $2-$3 by the waitress but not $5 for 2oz I mean the least they could've done is given 5oz $1 per oz......OUTRAGEOUS!!!! Take your business to Maggiano's they will not charge a penny for extra sauce. My fiancé and I always order extra sauces with our food there. He likes mixing red & white.

Also my to go order for my fiancé, I had asked for a salad without tomatoes and olives well they somehow managed to get a tomato in there. Smh. I wish I hadn't tipped as generously. Highly disappointed...

No offense, but anyone who gives this place a 5 stars is on something.  Not onto something... on something.  Whatever you wanna call it, meth, speed, crank, ice, rock.  Must be some good ish. Or you've never had italian food before in which this will do.

This place sucks on so many levels I cant even write a full review without getting turrets. ""Ahh F' u suck Carrabba's! ahh"" 

OK I'll try...

My first nightmare at the Henderson Carrabba's was terrible.  Cold food, bad service. I didn't leave a tip.  Terrible experience.

But my GF wanted to try it one day, so the second nightmare began when I went to eat at this ""restaurant"" and my date and I decided to eat outdoors.  This was obviously a problem cause we got NO SERVICE AT ALL. I had to walk in and remind them that we were there. WOW. OK so besides this, it's all about the food, right? I order the lasagna and about an hour later when we finally get our food after three or four bread baskets, the lasagna comes out... I begin to eat, biting into the lasagna.  This ish was hard as a rock.  Burnt to a crisp.  Crazy right? After all that time you'd think they'd try to get it right.  They comped the meal, but of course they should have.

I have tried other things on occasion which were good, but this is my fave dish by far. Mmmm I am getting hungry thinking about it, lol.

 This is a couple steps above olive garden. The food just taste better and is of higher quality, and is really about the same price range. A waiter once clued me in on a little secret, and said they use the same exact meat products from the same supplier as Flemings located right next door. Well, Flemings is ""fine dining"" and will cost you a pretty penny for the same steak. The staff is always very friendly and attentive.

I reached someone who put me on hold after which I was connected to the take-out person who was very nice and professional. The food is terrible. Even my spaghetti was terrible. I tried the gluten free which may have contributed to the problem. There was very little sauce. How does one screw up spaghetti?  We also ordered sausage which was terribly over cooked and dry.

We complained and were told they would fix it and when she returned she just said they are all going to be like this, do you want something else?

Food is edible. Service is accomodating, and all in all...it's not bad.

I popped in here with my folks for a little Father's Day dinner. The host promptly seated us, and gave us a nice spot.

I ordered the 8 Vegetable Lasagna. I figure after all this sobriety, the least I can do is treat myself to a nice filling meal.
It was delicious. I'm usually not a fan of tomato based sauces, mostly because of the acidity, but this was nicely balanced.

Again, I'm not being too harsh, because over the years, my standards for chain spots have gone down. 

Bathrooms are clean. Parking is plentiful.

One thing I would like to point out. They are only open till 9PM on Sundays...but you dont have to feel weird about coming in just before they close. The staff is still warm and friendly, and they don't rush you. In fact, the restaurant was still quite busy when we left (10PM or so).

The staff is really what makes this one of my favorite places -- they are en pointe in every way!!! They really make the experience special, even though it's not an expensive place. They run their customer service show like a well-oiled machine, and it's actually a thrill to just sit and watch how everything moves like clockwork -- from the hostesses who will actually open the door for you, to the servers, to the kitchen staff and the manager conducting the whole symphony. It's all handled in a very professional manner.

The food is also great! It is always fresh and delicious. Everything from the bread, to the pasta, the salad, soups, desserts. It's definitely a place you want to come back to. Oh, and your food always has perfect timing -- you never sit feeling hungry and neglected, yet they don't rush you through your meal, either. 

At this Carraba's you really feel you're in a fancy place, but at a fraction of the cost -- it's about the same price as The Olive Garden -- but so much tastier and welcoming -- feels like a mom and pop kind of place.

Hot bread with olive oil and spices was brought to the table. I ate wayyy too much of this. If oil isn't your thing ask for some butter. 

For my dinner I ordered chicken Bryan which is grilled chicken with goat cheese, sun dried tomatoes and basil topped with a delicious lemon sauce. I order the same thing every time I come here because it's so good I can't bring myself to order anything else. The tang of the cheese, the saltiness of the tomatoes and the acid from the sauce all pair together so well. I will say the portion is quite small for the price but you do get a salad or soup with the meal as well as a side. Choices are veggies, mashed potatoes or fettuccine alfredo. I got with the house salad which comes with a garlic parm dressing, and the fettuccine alfredo for my side. The salad had romaine, tons of sliced carrots, radishes and banana peppers. Quite an odd mix for an Italian house salad. It was underdressed and the dressing wasn't super flavorful but it was very garlicky. I would ask for dressing on the side next time. My meal with a drink was $26 which is a little pricey for dinner for one.

I have been to this Carraba's location twice before, but it's been a solid 4 years since I've been back to visit. Not by choice, it's just a ways away from me. We all took part in their Amore Monday Menu special. The menu includes a choice of either appetizer or desert, soup or salad, and then an entree. The hubby and I decided to split our apps and dessert, so we each chosen one. The prices start at $12.99 and reach upwards of $18.99. Hubby got a $12.99 lasagne and I got an $18.99 shrimp and scallop dish (I forgot the name). For our other items, we got calamari, 2 orders of sausage and lentil soup, and a brûléed cheesecake. My sis and mom's finance each got shrimp fettuccine alfredo sautéed with mushrooms. While my mom got lasagne. I don't quite remember their apps, though. We were all very impressed with how quick their service was, how delicious all the food was, and our server was completely attentive and fun. I wish I remembered his name! My moms finance asked where he was from and our server said Boston. At the end, we requested our order of brûléed cheesecake and my mom put in for an order of Limoncello bread pudding and we were warned that the bread pudding would take a while. We didn't mind, we were all just hanging out, anyways. Our server and another gentleman came by on two separate occasions to tell us they were still working on the bread pudding. I appreciated that, a lot. Our server came by again and told us our dessert was gonna be on the house and to include another cheesecake due to the extremely long wait! We couldn't believe it! It must have been a while, but it didn't phase us too much. That was so very professional of them and when the dessert did get to us, it was worth the wait, anyways! Will deff be back sooner!

However, I did end up going back and I tried their Chicken Bryan which is so good, I couldn't even stop thinking about it. Then again, I love goat cheese and this is basically chicken covered in goat cheese. Now I go back! The zucchini fries are delicious. Their blackberry sangria is awesome. This place is good, but it isn't my every night option because of the price point. Definitely better than any Olive Garden I have ever been to.",JB4_tH5U_oN7Xl3MA4aeHw,1,1,4,xB_kEWsEmeMbtZKLmm0PIw

I get together with family we always get some appetizers start our dinner. We had the calamari and zucchini fries. The calamari thing enjoy or stood out unlike other chain italian restaurants each piece was nicely coated with breaded and no clumps of calamari. The marinara sauce was ok. Just preference like marinara with calamari not so chunky. The zucchini fries cut just like regular fries was fabulous and the dipping sauce was awesome. 

Entree apparently there running seasonal specials menu now. Pastas second section on the menu. You get two bowls of pasta for one price. I tried the bolognese. I enjoyed! It was nice meaty tomato sauce. Pasta was cooked nice al dente. Scoop of ricotta cheese on top. The portion sizes at Carrabba's is very generous. Definitely getting money worth comes too food. The bread is really good. End up getting two of three portions every time. I like the fact the bread comes with nice olive oil and herbs instead of butter. 

The service always been great. Our waiter was wonderful he took care of us. Never had empty glass, constantly checking up making sure things were great. He never minded fact we hoarding loaf after loaf of bread. We ordered food too go for my sister-in-law and he timed it out perfectly he brought our check food all packed ready too go. If never been too Carrabba's its not whole lot different then Olive Garden (I am fan) prices about the same, lot of food, and great for family night out. Carrabba's different vibe inside and sure the bread take over Olive Garden. It place that will be coming back again with family.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,2,1,4,qdBuTO-unRkT_8kgxrA6tA

Then he came to the table and told us he was being relieved.  The new waitress came and was very pleasant.  He must not have mentioned the occasion, as she was totally unaware.   Now mind you the restaurant was NOT crowded and it took forever to get our food - appetizer were even slow arriving.  Over an hour later we were finally eating.  My husband's steak was honestly not edible.  My fish was overcooked and dry.  The lasagna was decent - and my daughter's chicken was just okay.  We only chose this place for the variety of menu choices. The mgr took the steak off the bill - offered to make him something else but at that point it was almost 2 hours into the meal.

Then, the next step, the delicious house salad with house dressing is always tasty and has a taste of anchovy and olives in in it -- very tasty.  The soup option, the minnestrone, our choice with the cabbage and fresh vegetables. The entrees are amazing.  I've been hooked on the balsamic tiliapia with fresh basil and grilled cherry tomotoes and request a side of angel hair with pomodoro sauce (red veggie).

I am usually way beyond full by the time we leave.

The 'host' that seated us said our waitress Jennifer would be right with us. 3-4 mins. later the host came by to get our drink orders. No Jennifer as yet. We looked over the menu and the host again brought us bread & a small plate with herbs. Still no Jennifer.

A good 5 more mins. & Jennifer appeared. She noticed we had drinks. I asked her about the herbs. She said she would bring oil, & offered balsamic vinegar & butter that she returned with. Now we're there a good 15-20 mins and Jennifer finally came by to take our food orders. She only had a couple of tables and it was not busy at all on a Saturday afternoon, but one table seemed very demanding, I'll give her that. 

Now we waited!! - we were near the service station & ended up getting more olive oil & refilling our water glasses ourselves - NO Jennifer to check on us. We did see her around the other side of the dining area but she never came past our table once to check on us at all!

Standard American-Italian fare, is what you'll enjoy here, with lots of bread and large portions, which were quite welcome to our table of hungry hikers and climbers.  The tomato-basil soup was divine and the chicken marsala with mashed potatoes was A-ok.  My friend had some sort of lobster pasta that she was still swooning over the next day.  

Service was energetic and pleasant.  Prices are higher than what you'll pay at other places on this ""strip,"" but the food is noticeably better.  This is no destination restaurant, but if I found myself driving up and down Charleston again, I'd happily eat here again.

Please, see photo. I am utterly shocked that this meal cost me $28. Look at my sorry spread. Look.at.it. 

This is by far the SMALLEST portion of spaghetti I have ever seen come out of an Italian restaurant kitchen. Are you kidding? Also, had I not asked for extra meat sauce I would have gotten semi dry spaghetti with a sprinkle of sauce, in a pool of water. Water, you ask? Yes, water, because the sauce it was not cooked long enough -- a rookie move. If the ""chef"" needs a cooking lesson, I can stop by and show him how to make a real meat sauce he can actually be proud of. 
This mess was $15. If I were a cat I'd HISS right in his face. 

I was DYING for a minestrone soup tonight. This one had a very lovely abundance of veggies, especially napa cabbage, which I love, but it had very little flavor. $8 for a soup that I had to finish at home with more seasoning and spice. I ordered OUT because I didn't want to cook or modify anything or drive more than 4 minutes. 

I feel like this was a robbery of my craving. Absolutely tasteless. ALTHOUGH, the Caesar dressing was very good. This I loved. 

This meal left me dissatisfied and wishing that I would find $28 on the street somewhere tomorrow so that I at least would get something out of this.

Oh, I don't know if they still do this for the kids, but they used to hand out dough for the kids to mold and shape (and I think bake for them) which was fun for our kids.  That was kind of a neat twist to keep the kids entertained.

We sat outside and enjoyed a mild Vegas night.  We showed up about an hour before they closed but felt very welcome.  It was a Monday night and they had a very good deal for a 3 course meal for $12-$16 that includes an app, entre and soup or desert.  We had a ton of good food and drinks for under $40!  

During the dinner the obvious debate ensued of Carrabba's Versus Olive Garden.  I prefer the atmosphere of Carrabba's because it feels a bit more classy and updated.  My girlfriend is more ""stuck in her ways"" with OG.

The food is a bit of a toss up and needs to be broken down to the two things that matter in an Italian Restaurant.

Bread:
Carrabba's has a warm loaf of hard-crust with soft-inside bread sliced and fresh from the oven, with olive oil and herbs to dip.  The breadsticks at Olive Garden are world famous, but I tire of them.  My gf prefers the OG breadsticks but I pointed out to her that night that she sucked down the Carrabba bread like Kobyashi on the Fourth of July.

Sauce:
The last few times at OG I felt like the sauce was more underwhelming than I remembered.  Like it was more watered down and bland.  Carrabba's sauce seems a little thicker and sweeter, a little less mass produced and a little more home-made than OG.

I asked the waiters at both OG and Carrabba's if the pasta is made fresh in store.  OG replied no, but Carrabba's does make two of it's pasta's fresh in-store.

Either place is okay in my book.  But I think I lean towards Carrabba's",bWJWcQyDKtFSvsTW2tR3hw,1,1,4,AaT3WaTkSISyC4IZUTuf2A

Unfortunately, it was a worse experience than the first time we had gone.
They basically charge high-end prices for Olive Garden-like food (and the portions are way smaller than those of the Olive Garden.)
I am in no way pushing the Olive Garden - I'm just trying to find a restaurant with equivalent food to compare this place to.
I give them a star for atmosphere, and a star for presentation, but their ""taste vs. cost"" is a little insulting.
Sorry.

Our waitress was awesome. Let me sample a couple of their sangria flavors before ordering one. The Blackberry Sangria was good. Peach would be perfect in the summer.
So I love the bread. I ate way too much bread. Our waitress recommended the Parmesan Salad, I didn't think it was great (OG's salad is better). Doug got the Pasta Sostanza with Chicken, the tagliarini pasta was perfect, it was so light. But the rest of the food in the dish I didn't care for, but Doug liked it, so that's what counts. I got the Chicken Parmesan with cavatappi amatriciana. The chicken had good flavor but was a bit dry, and the cavatappi was cooked perfect but the sauce was tasteless.

I have to say I got ""chain restaurant"" feel from the decor, as it it were a cookie-cutter design, but it wasn't an unpleasant environment. 

I was sad that no eggplant parmigiana appeared on the menu, so after I shared an appetizer whose name I cannot recall, I chose the spaghetti with meatballs.   

The appetizer had crab, cheese and spinach in it, among other things. It had a nice flavor, but I got the impression it was whipped, which gave it an airy texture that I do not like. It comes with toasted bread triangles that are crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

My spaghetti was fine.

So...  I have no real complaints and would certainly come again if friends wanted to, but if I were asked to recommend an Italian restaurant, this one wouldn't be the first on my list only because it's pretty average.",6w6pXL1N1q9RkmG6b4Su6g,1,1,3,FfGzJvU1eCn8QL3PPDNiGw
5521103,2017-03-18,0,PSRZaGGxXmOmabL2si8pKw,"Carrabba's has been a common casual dining spot for my mother and I since I was young. We have been going to the chain restaurant for almost nine years now, and about seven years at this location which is six miles away from where we live. However, we have always enjoyed the food and service enough to continuously return. In particular, there is a host - an Asian gentleman with glasses - who has consistently welcomed us and provided impeccable service.

This was the first time my mother and I had arrived a little after three o'clock in the afternoon for a late lunch, we usually either come in during the early lunch or dinner hour. The host that usually greets us (mentioned above) was occupied, but we noticed there was a change in a handful of waitresses. We were served by Brianna (on the receipt: Brianna P) who was quite friendly but displayed the worst service that I have ever experienced at Carrabba's and maybe at any restaurant, ever.

Of course, realizing that there were new servers my mother and I attempted to be patient but found that the poor service only continued to escalate our frustration. We ordered calamari as an appetizer, the soup and salad combo, along with the prosciutto wrapped pork tenderloins. The food was delicious, and we had absolutely no complaints about the food. Though, we found the fact that we were served our salads before the appetizer was already strange (typically, the appetizer comes first). Not a big deal though, until the dirty dishes began piling up on our table. Brianna had crossed multiple times and I realized that she also had not picked up any of the dishes on the OTHER tables. There were empty glasses, dirty plates, and left over utensils taking up room on all tables that she was serving. It was NOT busy at all in the restaurant. 

After our food was all served, Brianna - while walking - had asked if we were doing okay while she was attempting to serve another table. Although we were entirely fine, I found that this was not the proper manners of a Carrabba's waiter, let alone ANY waiter. Brianna was at the table beside us, cleaning up the dirty plates after a party of about five or six had left. We had to shout ""excuse me"" multiple times before we caught her attention and managed to let her know that our water glasses were completely empty and had been the entire time she was wandering around the restaurant.

There was a bit of leftover food and we were looking to have it packed so we requested a box and the check. Brianna volunteered to pack the leftovers and I sincerely wish she hadn't since when she packed the food, she put it in the bag sideways. I have never been to a restaurant where the waiter would pack the food and put the container on its side where the food was not only laying along the opening, but also having the contents dripping onto the bag. It's entirely unappetizing, honestly.

The bill ended up totaling to $39.55 and we put down $50 and immediately handed our bill back, being asked if we wanted change for the leftover. I suppose there were no coins in the register and our server decided to round up, but she returned a ten dollar bill and a one dollar bill. Mind you, my mother and I have both work in the service industry and understand that MOST of us live off tips. But a ten dollar tip for a forty dollar bill, where the service was subpar? That is absolutely out of the question. At this point, my mother and I were absolutely speechless. And of course, she was nowhere to be found when we wanted to break the bill down. 

Honestly, we should have left only the dollar she returned because this was the worst service we have ever experienced here at Carrabba's during all nine years that we have been coming here. I'm not sure if we will be coming back.",zn1klNeNLrk0XE1vF_l00A,4,0,1,N4n9ceVoNiIVCUUQJ_4sew

They don't take reservations, but they have this call ahead system, so once you arrive you don't have to wait long.  I definitely recommend doing this, as it seemed like the wait could take a while.  We waited about 10 minutes to be seated.

Our server was fantastic and very attentive.  I always had a new diet coke before my other one was empty.  My mama's water glass was always topped off.  The server also brought out a complimentary dessert with a candle and sang happy birthday with me!

The food was just okay to me.  It wasn't stellar, but wasn't bad.  The bread came out hot and fresh and the dipping spices with EVOO was great.  I ordered a pizza from their wood-fired oven and while the crust was great, the middle of the pizza was kind of soggy.  It wasn't bad, just not great.  I would definitely try something different in the future.  My mom ordered the chicken parmigiana.  It comes with a side and my mom chose mashed potatoes.  We both expected that the chicken would sit atop a bed of noodles, but apparently that has to be your side for it to be so?  I'm not sure, but it just looked silly on the plate like that.  I tried a bite and the chicken was really good.

What really stood out, though, was the dessert.  The complimentary dessert we received was two scoops of vanilla Bluebell ice cream (which our server claims you can only find in Texas and Carrabba's restaurants, but I think I've seen it in grocery stores before..) with candied pecans and a caramel-y kind of sauce.  It was outstanding!  Perfect for my mom too, since she loves pecans.

Overall, I'd rate the service a 5, dessert a 5, and the food a 3.  There's definitely better Italian food at non-chains, but it's still not a terrible option.",QE-aL9xrz1pc6MOY_rky6g,3,3,4,43tuSQdnmatP5Jj8hgov7Q
