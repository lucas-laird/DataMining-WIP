Cleanliness & Staff: It's a brand new restaurant so it's nice & clean. I especially like that you can actually see the kitchen! The tables are always wiped down as soon as customers leave & I like that you are greeted immediately when you come in!

1634464,2016-11-05,5,BndplCo6DSSIUSP5wOEF0w,"When I saw the signage go up for LULU's, I could not wait for them to open.  As I was recently searching the yelp app, I noticed it was up and running.  I ended up there Friday night ready to make my order.

Located in an already insane parking lot due to other business's, you would do well to just park out in the north forty and walk in.  There is ample seating inside but not really for a Friday night.  I was on a mission to order and hoped that it would travel well enough to the house to be devoured.  

There was a lull in the action when I walked in shortly after 6:00PM.  I scanned the multiple menus posted about and experienced my normal pre-order vertigo followed up with indecision.  This was quickly cured when I spotted a handheld menu.

I ordered for the GF a mini Loco Moco.  For myself, I ordered up a regular Chicken Katsu and a Spam Musubi.  The staff was friendly and I sat down to wait.  The next swell of hungry humans came in and it got busy quick.  I sat back and watched to see how this new location handled the pressure.  Everyone was all smiles and remained just as friendly as when I arrived.

My order was up in quick fashion and out the door I went.  Out I went back to my sled watching the insane parking lot do it's thing.

When I arrived at the casa, I quickly tore into the bag and set the table.  There was some condensation (anyone figure out a cure for this and you'll be a millionaire!) but not enough  to ruin the delicious crunch of my Katsu. The regular size was awesome and served with a two huge helping of rice and da mac on the side.  The mac had a wonderful flavor to it.  I will order extra next time. I was so engaged with my meal that sadly I did not try any of Loco.  The musubi, as I had previously observed was made to order and was also delicious.

LULU, I am thrilled you are in the area and I look forward to visiting you again....even if my waist size isn't.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,8,5,4,O3vN-kTPhXNgnG4zTBC_iA

A few tips for the owner: you can tell when food has been marinated & I would marinate a bit longer or make your marinade a bit more concentrated. It lacked flavor by just a little (BBQ chicken, teriyaki beef, BBQ short ribs). Typically, hawaiian bbq also has a char on the food, so I would sear the BBQ short ribs a bit longer / turn up the heat because it ALWAYS tastes better when it has char! :)",WprLWLMfdlbstGuCQvUHJQ,3,0,4,UP6C-asHbnPjQ7DG59nFwg

Ordered at the inside and the girl working talked barely louder than a whisper. Place was clean and new. Spam masubi, you can't mess this up. I also ordered the crab ragoon, and the sauce was WAY too fishy. It left a disgusting aftertast, idk if they make it in house but they need to tone down the fish sauce. I Also ordered delivery. It took about 30 min from calling in. Food was still hot when delivered. I ordered the chicken katsu this time. Sauce was similar to L&L. The chicken was juicy and thick, but I do wish it was a little crisper as it got soggy near the end. The rice is not like L&L because it is more moist vs. The drier rice, either one isn't bad, but just a difference. Now I love L&L macaroni salad but this place.... the mac salad had way too much mayo. The Flavor Was good. But they should tone down the mayo as it was just grossly dressed.

I had some of the garlic shrimp as well, but it had very little if any garlic taste. The tempura was good and the shrimp were tender. The macaroni salad was bland.

4014537,2017-04-11,1,BndplCo6DSSIUSP5wOEF0w,"Solid 3 1/2 stars!

Besides L&L in the NW part of town, now we have another option...LULU Hawaiian BBQ!  Food fairly similar between all Hawaiian BBQs...but to be honest, none of them compare to back home in Hawaii!  This LULU, while a step in the right direction, is just OK.

Décor is almost the same as Ohana Hawaiian BBQ, the huge lit up menu boards too!  Like all of them, the Hawaiian menu is basically 95% the same as the other Hawaiian BBQ restaurants here too.  Funny, same employees too....pretty much all Chinese!  No offense to y'all...but where is the locals atmosphere, eh?  Not one local Hawaii worker in sight!  No pidgin English!  No IZ or Kapena or Pati or 3 Plus playing on the stereo!!  Ack, for me this almost automatically takes a star away!  It's a part of the ambiance!  The locals make it like home!

Back to the food though, which is very much on par with all the other non-Hawaiian owned Hawaiian BBQ places in all of Las Vegas.  Cooked efficiently, tastes really (really) just A-OK.  There is something missing for me, I don't know.  Is it the love?  Something is lacking.  The food will feed you for sure with its large portions, and while pretty tasty - I just don't feel NOURISHED.  Perhaps it's a soul thing?  Anyway, the family and I partook in:

-Fried Fish Combo Plate
-Hawaiian BBQ Mix Plate (BBQ Chicken, Beef & Kalbi)
-Chicken Katsu Curry Combo Plate

Each combo plate comes with 2 scoops of rice & 1 scoop of macaroni salad.  If you're going low carb, get the mini plate!  2 scoops of rice is massive!  But yummy with extra shoyu.  Macaroni salad for me is delicious with a dose of black pepper & Tabasco.  LULU's macaroni salad was a tad runny for me though and could have used more salt.

Entrees itself were average, nothing fancy to write home about.  Fried fish seemed like more batter than fish.  Chicken katsu was ehhhhh...the chicken was pounded way too thin in certain sections so you got a lot more panko than meat.  The curry on the chicken katsu was for sure from a can/bag too...artificial tasting.  If you're gonna do that at least use a GOOD brand!  I normally don't like the katsu sauce served in any of these restaurants too, usually a cheap mix of ketchup & Worcestershire sauce.  If I know ahead of time I'm visiting a Hawaiian BBQ here, I bring my own!!  Bulldog or Kikkoman Katsu Sauce does the trick just fine!

Best thing we ate was probably the Hawaiian BBQ mix plate.  The chicken, beef & kalbi were grilled very well on the flat top - good sear with those tasty caramelized edges.  Great with hot white rice.  I would order this the next time if we come back.  Generous serving - except that we got only 1 piece of kalbi.  More kalbi ribs, less BBQ chicken!  I insist!

Not a bad experience overall at LULU Hawaiian BBQ.  We may be back again the next time a local food craving kicks in.  Maybe then I'll see a local Hawaiian working behind the counter!!

4015827,2017-01-06,1,BndplCo6DSSIUSP5wOEF0w,"I stopped in here on a whim today during my lunch hour. I was looking for something quick and wanted to switch up from my normal splurge of Greek food in the same shopping center. Enter LuLu Hawaiian BBQ 2. I already sort of knew what I wanted when I got up to the counter because I had browsed the menu in the past and it seems a lot like L&L(which I`m very familiar with). I ordered the BBQ chicken mini plate to go.

First impressions while waiting? The store was clean, the employees were friendly, and it was a nice warm temp in there(It is cold outside right now). I felt comfortable waiting, plus it smelled delicious in there. I waited about 8 minutes and one of the employees brought my to go bag to the table I was sitting at, which was nice.

When I got home, I ripped open the bag and popped the lid on that super familiar to go container and I was impressed by the amount of chicken I got. Plus, they separated out the cold macaroni so it didn`t get all gross in the styrofoam container with the hot chicken and rice. They also included napkins, cutlery, and a side of sweet soy sauce. Sweet. Now to taste.

Now this is where the experience falls apart for me(for ME. Everyone has their own taste standards). The rice was rice. It was fluffy and tasty with a little soy sauce. The macaroni, I`m sorry to say, while creamy...was incredibly bland. I kept digging, expecting the flavor to be released. I finished it, but I was definitely not impressed. In fact, I was a little sad after having had L&L macaroni in the past. I`m still slightly sad right now as I write this. I wanted to love that macaroni. Annnnnddddd ...the chicken. It was OK. There was rubbery skin on the underside, which was easy to peel away, but made for a less than desirable eating experience. I thought the flavor was fine, but lacking. I don`t know. The entire meal needed salt and a punch of something more. It was fine. Would I go back? Probably not unless someone really wanted to go and then I would say ""okay, dude"". 

Like I said, the employees were SO nice when I visited and I think the concept is good and we need more options up here in the NW, but the execution fell short.",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,5,1,2,KTA0UBQlwSEEKMN6Zyz1fg

4228342,2016-11-24,0,BndplCo6DSSIUSP5wOEF0w,"I LOVE Hawaiian BBQ food. I saw the signage for this place quite a while ago and couldn't wait for it to open (I monitored the progress on a weekly basis!!). I was so excited there was going to be a kahlua pig place closer than the L&L over on Centennial. 

I'm sure I was probably one of their first customers. The dine-in area seemed clean and there are menus on the walls which are easy to use. The menu itself is extensive and I was boggled by all the choices. Not only do they have Hawaiian choices but also all the traditional Chinese food fare. 

I ordered what I had waited so long for, the kahlua pig. It comes in two sizes and both sizes include white rice and macaroni salad, which is the way it is traditionally served in other places. 

The kahlua pig had a nice flavor. Subtly smoky and not too salty. The meat was a tad dry which is somewhat common for this dish. I have only been to a handful of places where they kept their pork moist.   The scoops of rice were nice and fluffy, not the traditional sticky rice that usually comes with it and I liked the texture. The mac salad was the standard Hawaiian variety, which is normally over-dressed with mayonnaise and this was no different. I liked it better than some since it wasn't sweet as some mac salad is. The portions were ample and I usually order extra rice and extra mac salad and get three meals out of the pork serving. 

The only other thing I've tried so far was the egg rolls which were slightly greasy but tasted light and were pleasantly crunchy on the outside and moist and plump inside. 

All in all, I was satisfied. Love the location and I plan on taking away at least once a week. I'll be one of their regular customers.",izWbFJZWlagRHrFjqX2DIg,0,1,4,3iYU3VhEwDhZOWSZvPRvng
