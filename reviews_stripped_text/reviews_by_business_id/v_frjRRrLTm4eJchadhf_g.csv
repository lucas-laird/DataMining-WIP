I did notice a line for this place both times, and the aroma was good.  Later in CA, I check Yelp for reviews and they were not stellar for a place that always seemed packed.   Finally, I got enough time to try their food and I have to agree with the lower grade tone of the reviews. It's not as good as it smelled or looked.   I was never served chips and salsa during my whole visit. The fajitas was salty like it was cooked in sea water.  It's sad to say that places like Chili's, Friday's or Applebee's got better fajitas than this place when every from the waitress's and the cooks were immigrant Hispanic.  Only three lousy tortillas came with the order and the steak was tough on the molars.  To make matters worse there was a hair in the salsa.  The whole experience made me wander why this place even had a line of customers the first two times I seen this place because the food was disappointing.  I guess being one of the first restaurants as you entered the airport help create the allure, furthered along by having their open grill aroma seep into the airport walkways.  Not many airport establishments can boast of having an open grill that lets their aroma go into the walkways.   Generally, mall foodcourt quality comes to mind when considering airport eateries.  Skip this place, don't let the aroma or lines of gringo's fool you.  Try the Jose Cuervo Taquilera instead.  They got more refreshing food than this place.  I am deducting another star for having a hair in my salsa, not being served any chips.",TXLFR5jwkaPUr9nJFZV1fQ,2,0,1,R4XMHu6wF2rG_hOYXPmrSA

This was the worst restaurant we have ever eaten at.  The fish and chips consisted of greasy breading that enclosed very small pieces of fish that were overcooked.  Chips were not even French fries much less English chips but potato chips and these were half wet and half stale.  I assume all of them were very stale and that somebody with very wet hands put them on the plate.  It was all inedible.  My wife had a stale tuna croissant.  She also received stale potato chips with half of them wet.  This is a restaurant that can't even serve stale potato chips without making them worse.  Total waste of money and inedible.

I was wrong those ladies work very hard to please their customers. The food is average but acceptable for the price.
I have to comment on the hostess though, she looked so lost and out of place that for the moment i gave it a second taught.

With all the advancements in aviation technology, I have even more faith, that statement is true.  But is by some strange cosmic roll of the dice, I was to dine at DATG, get on a plane, then impact Terra Firma traveling at 600 knots, I would absolutely, positively not want this to be may last meal.  Hell, I would rather take a Chex mix packet over this slop.

I take a certain pride in living in Las Vegas.  I am actually proud of your ability to get millions of visitors in and out of Sin City to have fun and contribute to our local economy.  It is with a heavy heart, I find that we offer those coming to and going away in the unsecured portion of McCarran International Airport this pig slop.  

If I just arrived from parts unknown and have by passed what the individual terminals have to offer and am met with Don's as a dining alternative, this is a sad, sad, reflection of what our city has to offer.  

If I am dining with a loved one prior to them punching out somewhere else in the country or world, it is absolutely vulgar this could be our last meal together.

Behind the facade of what appears to be a Tex Mex or Mexican style restaurant lays the cafeteria hell.  After perusing the menu anything off the Latino menu was out of the question.  Wanting to be safe, The GF (who was heading out of town) and I decided to share chicken finger and fries.  Water was fluid to wash it down because charging over $3 for a fountain drink is just plain ole price gauging.

The chicken fingers took over 15 minutes to be served and when they did show up the fries were barely warm.

While waiting for the our ""meal"" I watched as the servers conducted themselves in a manner befitting the federal government.  Imagine the attitude one would receive while standing in line at the Social Security office.  Better yet.....Imagine if the TSA was serving your food!  Rude, condescending, I watched one.. the order taker talked to a non english speaking traveller with ZERO compassion or empathy, while the traveler attempted to understand the establishment's menu.

Back to our order, the fingers where surrounded in a breading similar to that of the Carbonate Han Solo was encased in.  As previously mentioned, the fries sucked. After watching other patrons plucking who knows what off their meals while making funny faces, I told the GF to stop eating because I did not want her married to a toilet while she made her trip across the country.

Dear McCarran International Airport and Clark County Department of Aviation,

We can do better this.  Don Alejandro's Texan Grill is an embarrassment to our community.  The location is prime and surely could do better to represent our town while they are either coming or going.  Ditch the small town cafeteria fell for something sparkly and that won't turn your guts inside out.  You will probably make even more money with a business who gives a damn about what they serve, including the manner in which they provide it.  

In the end I earned a ""Maverick"" yelp badge.  Though cool, it was my bad for not consorting yelp before entering.  The ""Mav"" is earned by going against the grain and going someplace despite it's POOR RATING!

Sincerely,

Paul W.",HJj82f-csBI7jjgenwqhvw,12,6,1,1bivA-oN7KuGaZDn_uzncA

2229571,2009-10-30,0,v_frjRRrLTm4eJchadhf_g,"Hello, Yelp! I am posting from the McCarran Airport, courtesy of their free wi-fi. My friend's flight got delayed, so after getting my luggage from baggage claim, I wandered upstairs to see what food choices I had. Unfortunately, the food choices are dismal since I can't visit other parts of the airport without going through the security checkpoints. So if you are here, your choices are Starbucks, Big Al's Chicago Deli, and Track Bar and Grill (which had Budweiser emblazoned all over it and has a NASCAR theme going on). I stepped into Don Alejandro's because initially I thought it was a sit down area for the Chicago Deli. However, at that point I had just flown in from BWI and I didn't eat since 11am and it was now 3pm (6pm EST). The restaurant wasn't busy when I arrived, and the place looked clean. There is an issue with their ventilation, as there is a charred (not the good smelling grilled smell but the bad burnt kind) smell that permeated into the dining area during my hour there. 

Staff is quick to greet and seat patrons. They have a limited faux pas Tex-Mex menu. There's taco salad, tacos, enchiladas, etc but there is also burgers, fish 'n chips, caesar salad, and croissant tuna salad. I was fearful of getting the shits from eating the Tex Mex food, so I ordered their Lone Star Burger, which is just a hamburger served with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, and your choice of french fries or cole slaw. This is priced at $8.99. It costs extra for cheese. I also ordered iced tea, which was $2.99. The burger comes out in a basket, and the fixings are separate so if you don't like tomatoes you don't have to pick it out of your burger. It comes with a side of mayo and there's mustard and ketchup at the table. For a well-done burger, it wasn't bad. The fries were really good, too. They're the shoestring fries like McDonald's but fried a bit crispier. My server was very nice and didn't intrude too much. Given the food choices here, it wasn't a bad experience. Not great but not horrible, either.

With tax it came to $12.95 and the receipt has a tip suggestion at the bottom at 15/18/20%. Keep in mind that if you are a party of 8 or greater, an automatic 20% gratuity will be applied to the bill.",LQ2ScOFYw4-9ssIeedVQdQ,2,1,3,cHGGQgH6rVh24lOqmcofMg

Its usually the one with the most people during rush hour and hard to miss with its Texan / Southwest rustic exterior.

Service is usually quick to greet and seat, even though there may be a small wait time of 5-10 minutes.  Seating is vast but the one to two person tables far outweigh the group sized ones, understandably because its a stop for most travelers on the go.

When considering that most airport food is typically bland and overpriced, at least the food here is relatively edible, if not good on a hungry day.  A lot of Tex-Mex goodies are here from enchiladas, flautas, various burritos, quesadilla appetizers and a sauced up juevos rancheros.  Unfortunately, that's about as deep as the menu goes and variety doesn't seem to be their strong point.  Prices can get a little steep when considering a small order of taquitos can run one as much as $9.
