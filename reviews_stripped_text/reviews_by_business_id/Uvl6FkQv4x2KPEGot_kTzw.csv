I walked in and was greeted by a friendly staff the place was packed. I sat at the bar for a bite to eat before I knew it a few hours had past lol!!! The food was great and the cocktails even better, the owner Stephan was very cool and took great care of me.",EYzBNnfzikX366mBNOBvgw,1,0,5,NuoU8IYGxp_NO96cokHySA

Make sure you reserve a table though.. It's better seated with a great view of the performances or DJ.,3EKyCSrhaJ10_qX8OREpBQ,0,1,5,Xwv2ihIChmOlspUzOguJmw
