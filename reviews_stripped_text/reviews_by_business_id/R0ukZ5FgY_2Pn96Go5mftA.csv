This one was so disappointing.

I have never had staff members make me feel awkward until we ate here.  From the strange hostess to our extremely awkward/rude server, the vibes were just uncomfortable.  

I ordered the smoke house single burger with the barbecue ranch on the side and cheese fries.  My boyfriend ordered the Houston burger with an egg and grilled onions, also with cheese fries.

My burger was served with regular fries and no sauce. We told the person that brought our food that we both ordered cheese fries, so she fixed that.  Later when our server came by we asked her for the sauce I had ordered on the side.  She was like ""oh you still want that?"" Lol yes I ordered it on the side"".. After that she dropped our check and never came back.  Even when we were completely come eating we could not find her.  We tried to flag down another waitress but that failed.  We got ahold of the hostess and asked to pay.  She said our server had to cash us out, so we told her we haven't seen her in at least 10 minutes.  Finally she came out from hiding with an attitude and cashed us out and put the check back on the table.  ""Thanks.""  Yeah, pretty rude and unprofessional.  It was one of the rare moments where I considered not leaving a tip, but being in this industry doesn't allow you to do that without a guilty conscious. 

Aside from the terrible service the food was decent.  The sourdough onion rings on my burger were different, in a good way.  Even with cheese, the fries were bland.  But dipping them in the barbecue ranch made them edible.  We were too full to try a milkshake.  I won't be returning to this location but hopefully we can try a shake at another location sometime.

Food is pretty pricey, $30 for two burgers.  They come with fries ($1 more for cheese fries).  Good thing we had a groupon.",FWYjGKHmbjxrkXROctTGYA,1,1,2,HpouHmeI4qoVen4kMyVG4w

The food LOOKS like it'll be good but then you taste it and it's just bland and soggy. The burgers just DON'T TASTE GOOD AT ALL!!! wtf??! To put this into perspective, I'd rather eat a Mcdonald's mcChicken.

The worst part is: they charge $10 for a SHITTY burger lol. I got the ROUTE 66. Doesn't the description look like it'd taste amazing???!

""This favorite is named after the iconic, carefree, American Highway. Swiss cheese, grilled mushrooms, grilled onions & mayonnaise.""

NOPE. Tasted really bland. It's just bad. The meat was bad, the cheese was bad...it was just a bad experience.

Then we got this apple pie a la mode. You can't mess this up right? 

WRONG AGAIN. Got the dessert half melted. Apple pie tasted like cardboard and it wasn't even warm. Ice cream tasted like fat-free milk in half-solidified form.

I just can't. Never again.....

Service was good and our server was apologetic when our shakes came out late because they didn't have any whipped cream. No big deal. However, you can tell that the server was either new or nervous. Didn't flow very well, but I don't mind it. 

I have to say that I really do enjoy their sweet potato fries, but their burgers are just way too oily for my liking. You take a couple bites and oil is just dripping onto your plate.

It was pretty good, but I wasn't impressed with the fries or onion rings. Fries were soggy and onion rings were the kind when you bite into it the onion easily comes out.  Not impressed. 

One co-worker ordered a bacon cheese burger and cheese fries. She had ordered the cheese fries before and it had originally had cheese sauce over the fries. This time it just had melted cheddar over the top and they were definitely not as good. Consistency is very important as if she had known it was just going to be melted cheddar she wouldn't have ordered them.  Her burger was pretty good and it was very big.  

The next co-worker ordered a chicken Philly sandwich and it was terrible. All bread and grilled onions. The chicken had no flavor and did not look like all white meat. She cut each bread slice in half and had enough bread/onions to make a complete other sandwich. She was really disappointed that it was so terrible. She took a few bites but she couldn't even finish it. 
Another co-worker ordered the BLT and fries.  The BLT was good but the fries were too soggy again.

All in all this place is ok for burgers/patty melts/BLT but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here. Becuase you can find a better burger for cheaper at a wide variety of other places.

When I first went to a Johnny Rockets, it was about twenty years ago, at Pentagon City Mall in Arlington Virginia. I now live in Las Vegas, Nevada and have for the last ten years.  

""Heeyyy !! ""

When I first went to Johnny Rockets, service was great, food was very satifying. The jukeboxes, one per table, one for every two seats at the bar, they all worked.

It's like I had ""Found my thrill on Blueberry Hill"".

Several weeks ago my family, close friends, and myself went to the Flamingo casino and ate at the Johnny Rockets there. 

I left feeling like Al Delvecchio from Happy Days: ""Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.""

Just a few short days ago, my wife and two daughters went to the Johnny Rocket's at Fashion Show Mall here in Las Vegas, Nevada, the time was around 6:00-6:30pm. The place was maybe a quarter full.

Our server never introduced himself. No name tag. Kids wanted to, so we sat at the bar. One sat down and discovered that there were over a dozen ketchup bottle in front of her. Looked like the ketchup bottles were there to be refilled.

When we sat down, we were told that the jukeboxes won't work, they're just for decoration. When did this happen?

We ordered food and drinks at the same time. It took over five minutes to deliver the drinks. Mind you the drink fountain was a mere 10 to 15 feet from when I sat.

It's an open kitchen at Johnny Rockets, you can easily watch your food being prepared. You can easily watch your being placed in a prep area where it can be picked up by the server.

""Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.""

You will also wait another five good minutes to be served your food. MY 7 YEAR OLD COULD HAVE SERVED IT QUICKER !

The bacon on my hamburger was burnt. My 9 year old daughter, had bacon on her burger as well. When asked, she said hers was burnt too.

Just like the television show Happy Days, what once was a great place lost its charm. Somehow I feel like someone just stopped caring. Somewhere, sadly, Johnny Rockets has jumped the shark.",S156HzsEW-BjCfzu0xLe9A,2,0,1,dW_bLQ58eMEffISRavbsGw

This establishment is so atrocious, one wonders whether it would better to simply toss remaining Groupon®s in the white-coloured Waste Management recycle bin. One wonders how it even stays in business.

This place is subpar even by fast food standards; the audacity that they possess to charge what the burgers would go for at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is offensive. 

14.49$ for an original and a drink. No, not an alcoholic drink -- although it would have taken quite a few of those to make this shitshow remotely tolerable -- but a regular five cent concoction of syrup with water.

So what exactly am I complaining about? Mainly, the fucking burgers suck. They suck. Lower quality than Burger King®. Lowest quality and most charred burger I have ever paid for; worse than eating at the DFAC/Chow Hall in the military. Worse than eating at the fucking public school cafeteria. Just marginally better than literally starving of hunger (I would have to give it some further thought). 

So how the hell do they manage staying in business? Beats the fuck out of me. 

Come here if you wish for your meal to be more expensive, shittier, and be prepared slower -- and, possibly receive the wrong order (50% of the time, they have screwed up my order here) -- than if you just go to another burger restaurant, which is just several hundred meters away on the North East side of Fashion Show. 

Do yourself a favour: go to Stripburger®. They know what they are doing there and are much faster than here anyway. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,2,0,2,ZsPJ9PG2oY8gfsHz1jhRYw

We asked if they would take the Entertainment Book Coupon and they accepted it, even though the location was not specified on the back (that's why it never hurts to ask). This was nice. 

Nice staff greeting- this is a 50's type place, with the staff wearing the hats, and complete outfits which match the overall theme of the restaurant- and they do a dance every once in a while, too. We didn't wait for a table. We got the corner one facing the mall, so it was prime people- watching property ('course they all stare at us when we're eating our food, too, haha). BTW, these restaurants are popping up in other malls in the city, like the Meadows.     

I usually get a chicken sandwich, but I opted for the Chicken Philly, with mushrooms, peppers, and onions and choice of cheese- I chose swiss, @ $10.99, this time. My husband got his favorite, a bbq sauce style burger. The crispy golden fries come with the sandwich here (not at the Paradise location- we've been there, many times). My sandwich was pretty big and the fries were too much for me to eat (only had a portion). My husband's burger was different, but better, and he couldn't place it; what made it better this time. I told him, maybe it was the place. I would definitely get the Chicken Philly again- it was really very good, the bread was soft, the veggies made it more filling too, and the seasoning used on the chicken was really good- didn't need anything else.

We stood at the ""wait to be seated"" area for a few minutes until we were finally noticed by the cook. The cook  noticed us first and was trying to get the hosts attention but she was busy talking (socializing) with a man (which could easily have been a customer but seemed like it was someone she knew personally) at the bar/kitchen area and didnt hear the cook trying to get her attention.  She finally glanced over at us and came our way. We were a party of 6 and a high chair and so we asked if we can sit in the ""outside section."" This would be more convenient for us since we had shopping bags and a stroller. She said a part of that section had been closed down already and so we could only sit on the other half side of that section.  The front entrance is very narrow and so we had to take the stroller through the outside part of it and around into the small gate. The stroller still wouldnt fit through the tables there and the host asked if we could leave it next to a table right by the entrance of the small gate. (fine whatever we could still see it where we were sitting not a big deal) We waited for the host/waitress or whomever  to come over with a high chair or atleast offer us one since they just saw us come in with a stroller that had to be left at the entrance. We waited a few minutes until I had to ask for a high chair and thats when she brought it. One of the chairs at the table was dirty (bread crumbs and onions on the chair). We asked for napkins and specifically mentioned it was for a dirty chair. The waitress laid them on the table and didnt bother to clean the chair herself (fine no big deal, I guess).  We sat down and got our menus and she took our drink orders (3 fountain drinks, 3 shakes). After our drink order was taken, 2 other tables 2 people each were seated and since our stroller was ""in the way"" we were asked if we can actually move it on the outside  part of the gate next to our table. I jokingly said to them, we'll move it outside but if someone passes by and takes our stroller youre jumping over the gate to chase them down and we kind of laughed it off but I was actually annoyed at the whole stroller situation and just the way things started out. It was obviously too early for you to close off half of the section of tables being that it is the Holiday Season and so you are prone to have more customers at that time.
Ok...so from there, the 2 tables that came in after us got their drinks AND food before us eventhough she took our order befire them!!! I understand the food part, I guess, since they were only 2 people per table (4people) and we were 6 people, BUT C'MON atleast bring our drinks!!!! At that point I was ready to leave but we  were all so hungry and I was sooo thirsty so I thought I would finally say something. I flagged down our waitress and told her to atleast bring our drinks because we were thirsty and the other tables were already served with both food and drinks. She said ok I'll bring them right now. And she did...so why couldnt she do that before?? Im not sure if she was just annoyed at the fact that we were a ""big"" party and had children with us or what.  So we finally got our food also and everything was perfect from there. The food was awesome and she kept checking in on us.  We still tipped her although it would have been more if the overall experience would have been better. Its unfortunate to see bad customer service in a place where the food is actually good! We will not be coming back to this location being that they obviously prefer smaller parties with no kids and definitely NO strollers.",6zEbGL9v4ot1yR-P8cShTg,0,0,2,MoIfeN2y0BYGoQm57L23yg

4654917,2013-04-03,1,R0ukZ5FgY_2Pn96Go5mftA,"At Johnny Rockets my taste buds do not take off. The selection and taste of their food is average.

 Johnny Rockets is a sit-down 60's diner-themed restaurant that is located deep in the Fashion Show Mall near Dillard's. The wait staff dress as 1960's diner servers. They stick to the role so well that on top of the hour they will stand in front of the patrons while dancing to an oldies tune. Keeping with the 1960's diner theme, every table features a juke box. It was so enjoyable listening to the oldies (I think I was born in the wrong era.)

  In my opinion the oldies playing on the juke box is beats the food. I rate the oldies songs from 4 to 5 stars, where I rate Johnny Rockets 3 stars.

  Johnny Rocket's menu focuses on burgers. The starting price of a burger that includes fries is $9.95. Individual toppings cost $1 extra. The toppings include chili, fried egg, grilled bell peppers, grilled onions, and jalapeno slices. If you want bacon or onion rings as a topping it is $2 extra. Each cheese topping is $2 extra. They are American, cheddar, and pepper jack. Johnny Rockets also offer protein options for $2 extra. They include a turky patty, soy boca burgers, and chicken breasts. In addition to burgers, the menu also features Rocket melts, Philly cheese steaks, hot dogs, onion rings, fries, BLTs, and shakes.

  What brought me to walk from Bellagio to Fashion Show Mall was Johnny Rockets delicious egg salad sandwich. However, in similar fashion to my Interstate 515 business listing, it is gone. Boo! Tired of burgers, I ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich with fries. I felt that the Philly cheese steak fell short of meat. The fries were average. It was a three stars okay.

  At Johnny Rockets my taste buds do not take off and remain down to earth. Then again I am a down to earth Yelper that is giving Johnny Rockets a 3 star rating.

Greet time was slow as well as service: staff definitely could improve on their people skills and smiling because then, wait time wouldn't seem like such a drag. In all honesty, when you go out to eat you don't simply pay for food but you also pay for the experience. Not that Johnny Rockets is a high-end place or anything but that could just be my personal expectations because of my serving background. 


Overall it wasn't such a bad experience. The food came out hot and I do prefer to come to this location over the Mandalay Bay location because the food options at Fashion Show are more extensive.",2Ll2lZlyXQCr3NBusJy0vQ,2,0,3,AHGTTBEn7EK6QaaFsBhaLQ

The manager on duty gave me a free hamburger and milkshake to use for next day. So I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. Came back on Sunday 4/17 @130pm. Use the coupon and also purchased another burger and fries. I was told it would take  10 to 15 minutes. However it took a half an hour. And yet the order was not correct or HOT. Vanilla milkshake magically turned into a strawberry one. The hamburger and cheeseburger were ICE COLD. Never got the fries. Needless to say I was a little hot under the collar. I had to walk back from my hotel across the street into the mall to talk to the manager. I got a refund. And now waiting to see IF THIS ORDER IS CORRECT AND HOT.  Once again food wasn't coerct. Plain single hamburger with ketchup turned out to be a cheeseburger  with onions, tomatoes, mayonnaise on it.  So the bun fell apart. And the food is lukewarm again. I will never come to this locate.  Either you guys need to hire more help or train them better. And yes I called the general manager and left him a nice message.

Took a bite out of my burger and I could feel the grease exploding in my mouth. Set my burger down and when I picked it up my burger was soaked in grease, bun was so soggy, I couldn't set it down on my plate anymore. I ate the burger as grease continuously dripped from the bottom side. The taste was not good at all since I was eating so much grease. Sever was not attentive.

The food is ok, mediocre burgers and fries but my major problem with this location is the service. They continuously mess up orders and substitutions.

 My other problem is that they seem to ignore their customers. You call ahead they don't pick up, you are standing right in front of the hostess' stand and the person just ignores you. Wouldn't you think they would want to try and help you out right away? I guess not. 

Since this is the first official review for this location I will share a review meant for this location posted on a different JR:
       ""Here's a suggestion, if your restaurant is dead and there's        someone waiting to place a to go order, how about u tell the staff to tend to them instead of performing their unenthused dance routine for nobody.  Poor prioritizing!!"".

The food was satisfying. I was done for the whole day. The meat I've found it could use some seasoning to it like garlic or pepper, it doesn't matter it had no taste to it. Very minimal like it was only there to be there and that was all. The rest was very nicely made. The service in pace was average. Not too slow, not too fast either.

When I got the check it was $24.78 which also is very fair. But then I noticed the other servers looking to our table like they wanted us out. Which by the way we weren't taking long. 

I'd be back only for take out. As long as I don't see those other workers there again I don't have to come in and eat there, so force fully.",Jne7UiKCp_VsSsvh-utyQw,0,0,3,4DZVGE5NYEX3uRheh9Emvw

With a fairly plain but very good side salad with tomato pieces, fresh lettuce, Cheddar Cheese shavings, and Honey Mustard Dressing, it was a really good sandwich.  The medium well beef patty was hot and featured grilled onions and melted Cheddar Cheese on the buttered and grilled rye  And, I learned that a Vanilla Pepsi tastes almost as good as a Vanilla Coke--but not quite.  And there are free refills on Pepsi.  This was the best substantive food I have had here to date.  Only a shake (and in the past they have been very good) was missing.

On the negative side, a fly zipped around the open counter, and one cook and one shake maker were attired in filthy aprons.  When I tried to settle my bill and pay a server standing near the cash register, I was told to pay my server directly instead.  But she was engaged in other tasks, and I needed to leave right away.
