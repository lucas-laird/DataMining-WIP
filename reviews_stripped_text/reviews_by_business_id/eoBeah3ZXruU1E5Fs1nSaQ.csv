We also had a lemon, coffee, and chocolate macaron.  They were good, but not the best that I've had.  They were also on the small side.  The service was quick and friendly.

Beautiful interior and a nice escape from the 100+ degree summer heat of Vegas.  It also has a motorized gelato wheel that made me feel a little bit like I was in Willy Wonka's factory.   I tried the avocado (surprisingly good!), caramel, strawberry (very flavorful), and the red velvet gelato.  If I were to come back a second time, I would get the avocado and strawberry gelato.",YTdE26NYZdIABe5ykRwJjA,0,0,4,1YUwEFAXCEiWtvsx4tcC3A

Yong (the young man who worked there) greeted me and asked me if I want to try their wonderful gelato. Their gelato is easily one of the best I had in a long time and they have so many great flavors to choose from! I ended up ordering mango and pistachio gelati (yeah, I have to order two flavors because they are that good) and a tasty/eloquent walnut cake, then I sat down and started writing postcards for friends and family. I had a wonderful time as the decor is so gorgeous and Yong stopped by a few times to ask me if he can assist me with anything. I guess after reading other Yelpers' reviews, I will definitely have to buy their macaroons next time!",3wAG34DtH2-n16jz5gN6jQ,0,0,5,UZW1Mh13qc9Qr_UqQvBJqQ

When you first walk into Amore, definitely check out the displays.  They had this awesome chessboard cake that went for a cool $1,150.  Too high-roller for me, but it definitely looked nice.

As usual, I ended up sharing a dessert with the gf.  She tried a bunch of different gelato flavors (peanut butter, some mystery flavor) and she enjoyed them all.  She finally settled on Rum Raisin.  At $5 for a small cup, Thrifty's ice cream this is not, but in the end, it had good flavor.  The cone looked even better, but sets you back even more.

On a side note, I've discovered that I like the Rum Raisin flavor, but no the raisins.  Something disconcerting about those yellow raisins, perhaps?",_iwEegZrea12vujkjp06Mw,0,0,4,niDmKcezI33UVY0gg-8xmA

The shop was cute and in style. All the pastries were wonderfully decorated. I really wanted to try their special made chocolates but $5 a pop is quite a bit so after debating with my husband, I choose the Carrot cake cupcake w/ cream cheese frosting and candied walnut sprinkled on to the cream cheese frosting. The Walnuts and cream cheese frosting was very good and the box and bag it came in was very pretty. When i got to the cupcake though, it was dry and wasn't very tasty. I ate most of it and threw away the rest, for the money I paid for the cupcake, I expected it to be great. not epic, but great. 
I do hope to come back here again for the sugar dome custard donut.",mGYX6VAZp7O4HmGYtA0vPw,2,0,3,i8P6hPH1jnCwszQMEdxqgA

I can't stop raving about the service of the Mandarin Oriental. Now, I can rave about their desserts too. I asked the girl what she liked and she started off naming one by one and eventually named all of them =P One of my choices was the chocolate cake.  Seems simple enough but Amore makes it so wonderfully. 16 layers of chocolatey goodness, not too sweet and not too rich, just perfect.  Another pick, the Caramel Temple, just melted in my mouth. They've also got many flavors of gelato, mini macaroons, truffles, and more. I got a sample of the watermelon gelato and it was so refreshing. I definitely must get a gelato as well next time. On the side, they also have many beautiful cakes. The creativity and attention to detail is very impressive.

There are so many deserts to choose from, but I decided to try the yogurt mixed with fresh strawberries to counter the 100+ degree Vegas heat. OMFG best yogurt with fresh strawberries! The cashier even recommended the flavor, calling it the best Amore Patisserie had to offer, and he was so right. I did try a few other chocolate flavors, which were good, but I agree the yogurt is the best. It is on the pricey side, compared to that of Golden Spoon or Yogurtland, BUT they serve you enough yogurt/gelato to satisfy three people.",V5PVB2YZ2pMohAcqu4D0zw,1,1,5,QzlsNuaAyTSy7nYYxuq_Qw
3108652,2010-02-23,0,eoBeah3ZXruU1E5Fs1nSaQ,"Simply awesome!  I know red velvet cupcakes are simple and easy to make but Amore does it perfectly.  The cream cheese is what sets apart a good red velvet from a spectacular one.  And Amore's is spectacular.  More over, they don't just top it with the cream cheese filling, they insert it into the cupcake to ensure that the wonderful flavor continues on throughout.  

I'm just sad I only discovered this place on my last evening in Vegas.  That meant I had to make one last visit at 10am before my flight home!  

Aside from the fabulous cupcakes the gelato was superb as well!  Fresh, rich, creamy, yet light.  I could live on this stuff.  

And although I didn't get to try everything I wanted to, I'm sure it all tastes as good as it looks.  The candied confections shaped as purses, cigars, Chinese new year symbols, etc were incredible to look at and I bet even more incredible to eat.  Sin City indeed!

I have a picture but will have to upload it at another time since I don't have my camera cable on me at the moment. In addtion to your gelato, you also get fan-shaped wafers to complete the look.

a couple of months ago it was one of the best pastry places ive been to! I was so disappointed when i went back last week.

They have half of the Pastries they had last time, they were replaces by bottled beers...and no more cupcakes!...They still had their gelato, strawberry cheesecake...they gave me a lot for $5, not bad right? it was too much and felt like it had way too much fat!...it left my mouth and lips super slippery and weird...ehh.

I was very dissappointed, they need to get rid of that beer and have more pastries and cupcakes!!!",31OJfBoBXGDfK1LK72q_Qg,1,1,3,6aUzzOc3mHtQ2o2q4x63dw
3571727,2010-08-07,0,eoBeah3ZXruU1E5Fs1nSaQ,"On my macaron hunt in Las Vegas... I found them at Amore Patisserie... maybe I am not use to Vegas time but the bakery didn't not open until 12pm.. so I was very sad when I first went at 10:30 hoping to indulge.

When I finally made my way inside, I was impressed with their gelato selection, presented in a wheel form so that the flavours can be turned to scoop out flavours (space saver!). This little bakery is on the street side of the Mandarin hotel with lovely decor on the inside, including cakes that looked like pillows, and the delicately detailed Eiffel tower.

Searching for the macarons inside their store, I noticed several flavours and inquired about them. The pastry chef had decided to make the following flavors for the day - lemon, raspberry, apricot, pistachio, chocolate, and bacon cream cheese (apparently it tastes good!). I was very tempted to get this irregular choice, but I was told it really tasted like bacon and the cream cheese is not overly strong and I was completely turned off. On the other hand, these bacon macarons had no ""feet"" to them and looked cracked and undercooked.

I opted to get the apricot (never tried before), and the pistachio (never fail)......... the apricot seemed to be filled with jam, and the flavours were not too too sweet, and the filling gave it just the right amount of sweetness. I was surprised to say that I was actually not impressed with the pistachio. Usually, the flavors are very prominent but I felt this one was more on the bland side... oh well.

Packaged in little chinese take out containers, I thought it was cute. I'm not sure if I can say that their macarons are their specialty.",uHZr3XbjKvRTwdXLXrFuvg,0,0,3,uVAI8at1QApXX7XCB93csg

They use a high quality melted white chocolate liquid in your cocoa.  Loved it.  Since it was Valentines Day, we also bought a slice of chocolate cake, and two heart truffles for later tonight.

The decor of the artistic cakes and pastries may seem snooty at first but this place is anything but! 

Hubby and I came here for some treats after our dinner. We couldn't decide on the gelato, so we tried about 8 flavors before deciding on 2. The cosmopolitan gelato was delicious! Hubby ended up getting lemon and ""Samantha's forbidden apple"" for his gelato. I got the strawberry shortcake since it was dipped in grand marnier! WOW! We also got 2 small pineapple mojito alcoholic smoothie and strawberry lemonade vodka! The samples didn't taste so strong, but once we got them in our cups, we got to see how much alcohol was really in our smoothies, we got drunk off it!
