We opted for a plethora of small plates and boy did we make some good selections!  If we did this well with just apps, imagine what the meal would have been like if we ordered the full on?!  Shrimp and chips w/ mango, dungeness crab agnolotti with artichokes and lemon emulsion (could have EASILY ordered another order!), baby beet salad with warm goat cheese, and the jalapeno glazed carrots (which tasted like they were dipped in maple syrup-yum!).  The dining room was beautiful and had great energy, as it is next to XS and overlook the gorgeous pool.

38993,2012-02-06,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Botero, was wonderful. The food was delicious, the decor was sumptuous, the service was gracious.

To start, we had the ricotta gnocchi, the beet salad with goat cheese, and the short rib ravioli (special for the day). Each one was delicious. The presentation was, as you would expect, thoughtful and elegant. I had the kobe short rib as the entree. It was one of those fall-off-the-bone type meats, tender and tasty. The wine list was comprehensive. We had the chocolate torte and the doughnuts with marshmallows for dessert. Both were good, though the doughnuts were the winner of the night in our opinion. 

I would have given this dinner five stars, for sure. Except one of my friends had to run to the bathroom immediately afterwards. To be exact, he jumped out of the cab while we were on the Las Vegas Strip, telling us that he needed to find a bathroom, ASAP. Made the driver chuckle. Maybe this could have been a Bridesmaids moment? For his sake, I couldn't give Botero five stars.",WWgOC-JDMRa8FOY1zRjEaQ,1,0,4,ShwjfHJapHJrimi0GS1lYQ

So we headed to Botero and got seated at the patio immediately and instead of ordering their tasting menu for $115, we (5) made up our own tasting menu of little bites and 1 20 oz ribeye!  

The fois grois was amazing as well as the bone marrow.  Rib eye came out perfect!!!

We had a show to attend so we had to flag down the staff every so often but that doesn't bother me.

2 other tables however did get up and leave because we overheard them complain about the lack of service.  Whatever, they missed out on an unbelievable good menu.",EiSdTjwv9RwFyhC08nMcgQ,0,0,4,W27VkwBKcaI5RciKbBvECg
48550,2015-02-21,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"I had heard horror stories about another restaurant in the Wynn but decided to keep my reservation at Botero and give it a shot - I am so glad I did! It was the best dining experience I had in a five day trip to Vegas. Although not a steak eater, I'd chosen this restaurant due to the variety of other options and was very pleased. The service was also very good.

I dined there with a friend on a Monday evening in early February before a show. We had a reservation and were promptly greeted by an extremely friendly assistant GM and hostess and taken to a table with a nice pool view.

They have a decent cocktail menu, which I appreciate. For my meal, I started with the grilled octopus at our server's suggestion, and it was fantastic.The octopus was prepared perfectly - not at all chewy - and the romesco sauce was tasty but didn't overpower the other flavors. I could have eaten my whole meal off of the appetizer list there were so many tempting options of all kinds - beet salads, ahi tuna, crudo tastings, soups...My friend had the half East / half West oysters and thought they were fresh and prepared well.

For my entree, I had a seasonal fish dish that was fantastic. The fish was flaky but moist and fresh. If you like steaks, there are probably tons of options to tantalize you with lots of cuts, four different preparation options, and five or six add-ons, plus a great selection of sides. There are also menu options for Vegans that are actually desirable.

The dessert we shared tempted me with peanut butter promises, but there wasn't much peanut butter flavor. The little pieces of caramel corn were tasty, and some sort of chocolate chunk on the side (which I think was supposed to comprise a brownie element?) was the best part but small. I think they could stand to have a different pastry chef, but it wasn't bad. 

Overall, very friendly and prompt but not pushy service and really fantastic food. I will definitely eat here again on my next trip to Vegas.",0c-F2TWIcP8ejWoc5MWajQ,1,0,5,eDekNwN58ZXE0UpDs0Wvfw

Went relatively early on a Sunday night (7 PM), had a reservation, and was hoping to sit on the patio.  Unfortunately it was closed - because of wind possibly.

Wish I would have tried the crab cake, but got the special - Lobster ravioli - as appetizer instead.  Was delicious.  Entree was braised short rib for me, Bone in filet pepper style for my partner in crime.  The jalapeno hollandaise sauce was amazing!

184675,2010-03-30,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"The choices in Vegas made it quite daunting but we decided to eat my birthday dinner at Botero before seeing Cirque du Soleil Love.  Our waitress was great, helpful and present but not overbearing.  

First out of the kitchen was a trio of breads: cranberry, olive, and plain.  Mmm the cranberry was delish with a little of their herb/olive oil butter.  The olive was also tasty even though I'm not an olive fan.

My date had the rack of lamb which we both thought wasn't all the fantastic.  The meat had a mushy texture quite unlike anything I had every tasted.  His sides were verts (standard) and white beans (he liked these).  I decided on a pepper cooked filet that came with 3 dipping sauces: a jalapeno sauce, peppercorn sauce, and tomato-y sauce.  The first two were great and I alternated between them, the third not so much for my taste.  I also ordered a side of loaded potato gratin.  best decision!  I love me some scalloped potatoes (as anyone who's been to a superbowl party at our house knows) and these were just like the waitress said, each bite had a flavor of everything you put on a loaded potato, sour cream, chives, butter, and even some extras like cheese and onions.  mmm mmm good.  

Then came dessert, we had told them that it was my birthday but I wasn't even thinking about them giving me a birthday dessert when I saw ice cream cupcakes on the menu and was intrigued.  They did bring out a plate with Happy Birthday written in chocolate and a very small piece of one of their desserts but I was glad I ordered my own because they were a skimpy with the free dessert!  My date got the brownie with iced mint milk (simply mint ice cream).  He was very satisfied, I did not even try it because I had enough on my plate with the cupcakes.  The menu said ""childhood favorites"" for the flavors so I was expecting vanilla, chocolate, strawberry but in fact I received 5, or was it 6 different cupcakes each cake a different flavor with small wedges of flavored ice cream, a dollop of some sort of whipped topping.  They were quite filling and I would recommend sharing them and wish the waitress had suggested it.  The flavors seemed to be banana, strawberry, lemon, orange, spearmint/chocolate.  I was excited for the one that looked like mint/chocolate flavor but was quite disappointed when it tasted like doublemint gum.  It just wasn't what I wanted and was overpowering.  I appreciate the pastry chef was trying to be different but it didn't work for me like a classic mint would have.  
Minus a star for the poor rack of lamb texture and the flavor of the spearmint cupcake.  I would not go back here with so many other places to try and choose from in Vegas but overall a nice meal and I left quite stuffed and happy",bYORUQAc1QraGhI62dNeRg,0,0,4,gnWbu22ledM8SKInRGs_Eg
199407,2015-09-20,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Made reservations for our anniversary dinner. I had read wonderful reviews about Botero and we were not disappointed. The decor is absolutely stunning. White leather chairs inside with plush carpets. Two beautiful patios by the XS pool. 

We were sat as soon as we arrived and greeted by our server (Tonya,  I believe) She was friendly and knowledgeable. We felt very welcomed.

To start we had the prawns. Amazing! The sauce is excellent. I ordered the small filet (medium, chimichuri style ), which came with a watercress salad. My husband ordered the filet (medium, peppercorn style) which came with three dipping sauces that were amazing! We ordered half an order of Botero fries and half an order of the whipped potatoes. 

The steak literally melts in your mouth. It was so delicious. There was literally nothing wrong with our food. Everything was perfection. We had no room for desert, so we will have to come back. 

The only hiccup we had was when our server had to leave and turned us over to another server (Monya?? Mona?) who never even came to check on us. We had a table next to us ordering more ""high price"" items (wine bottles) so she completely ignored us. We could have walked out and she wouldn't have noticed. Finally we got her attention and we paid.

Aspargus salad--very good but not as good as the beet and goat cheese

Lamb chops--flavorful and tender--I'm not a lamb person but I really liked it

Braised short rib--my least favorite dish- it was good but compared to everything else it was flavorless and boring)

After having been subject to the disaster that is Switch, also located inside Encore, I was thrilled and ever so pleased with the impeccable service and tasty food that Botero provided.

As a classy establishment, Botero was the natural answer as where to have dinner in Las Vegas. Firstly, my guest and I were seated promptly when we arrived (as anyone should be who has a reservation). 
Next, our waitstaff came amply prepared with menus and an exquisite wine list (likewise).

The Botero artwork that adorned seemingly every corner of the main dining room (it's actually a circle.. and a lame joke) was quirky, but fun nonetheless. I ordered the filet mignon with chimichurri and it was heavenly. The wine was served at the perfect temperature and complimented our food well (Duckhorn Merlot).

The desserts only added to an excellent evening and our ever growing waistlines. I would tell anyone that Botero is a great place to dine and has a flair that can only be found in Vegas. Heed my advice and have a wonderful time. Just try to get some exercise in afterward.

437414,2011-05-04,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"This place was suggested to us by our lovely concierge, Amber, at the Encore hotel. There were 4 of us in total and we were starving but we also had booked Le Reve at 9:30pm on a Friday night. It was already 8pm and every place Amber called was booked solid or was full with a one hour wait. She discovered that Botero had 4 spaces open at the bar at Botero which also served the full menu. By the time we walked over the bar was full. We proceeded to talk to the host and told them our situation and they were able to squeeze us in immediately and notified our waiter that we were on a time crunch in order to make it to our show on time. 

Amber had told us that Botero was ""casual"", when we walked in we were surprised at how hip and awesome this place was. The decor was very modern and they played music we could bop along and sing along to. As we looked through the menu there was a good variety of all different meats. I was tempted to go with the salmon, but my eyes were drawn to the 40 ounce porterhouse steak for two. I originally laughed at how ridiculous that sounded and ask the waiter if they were serious. He told us that it's his favourite dish on the menu and that he highly recommended it. I then figured if it was a porterhouse steak then there would be a big bone which comes with the serving and is what would make up a good portion of the 40 ounce weight. I talked my friend into sharing it with me as I was curious to know why it was so good. After all, it's only a piece of meat.  I ordered it with chimichurri marinade and medium rare, and I also ordered a side of broccoli with sun-dried tomatoes (gotta have your veggies!). When the steak came out it was served on a hot plate and it was pre-sliced. I'm glad it did because it would have been daunting to have to pick through a huge piece of meat. The waiter explained to us that on one side of the bone, it was actually a filet mignon cut and on the other side it was where the New York strip would normally be taken from. I was quite thrilled to be able to try two different steaks in one go.

The steak was phenomenal! I had never had such an awesome steak in my life. My mouth is watering just thinking about it right now. I'm not a big steak eater too and I would normally feel ill halfway through having a steak, but this steak was made to such perfection. It melted in your mouth. The red wine we ordered also complemented the steak beautifully and the broccoli side was delicious!  We thoroughly enjoyed the steak and felt just right when we finished and not overstuffed. I also wanted to mention the bread they served while we were waiting for our order was amazing. There were two varieties, one with cranberries in it and the other was plain white rolls...for something so simple, it was truly delectable! 

I highly recommend this place and give two big thumbs up!! Definitely try this place if you are looking to have a nice dinner in Vegas. I'll definitely go back and can't wait!",jHjga32HW9Sg82n4JuwxWg,1,1,5,J6-ri5__QSj6ZDUAl3L-3g

Like everything on The Strip prices are astronomical - I will never forgive a restaurant that charges $125 for a bottle of wine I can get for $25.

The hostesses seated everyone close together so it became very noisy even though the restaurant was half-empty.  No place charging these prices should make such mistakes.

Unfortunately, an extremely loud group was seated ever so closely next to us. Close enough to where their chairs hit mine and the non stop yelling and drunkenness started to take a toll. 

Did I mention that our meal took over an hour to get to us?  First of all, they got one of our drink orders wrong (we only ordered 3).  Second, they told us about their amazing house made cheese and bread which took about 30-45 minutes to receive.

651611,2011-03-28,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"My husband and I chose Botero after reviewing other restaurants in the Wynn/Encore complex. We were staying at Encore and seeing Garth Brooks at the Wynn, so we wanted to stay close while eating. I chose Botero because of the menu and also the description of the atmosphere as lounge-like, something a bit different than other restaurants.

I definitely chose well! We had eaten an early lunch at Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill (another great eat) and wondered how Botero could compete at dinner. Botero not only competed but is a place we would eat again for fine dining. The atmosphere wasn't exactly lounge-like to me, but definitely hip with the tables arranged in radiating circles around a large statue, and the weather was too cool to have any outside experience.

But to the food - oh, the food! I had the Crudo Tasting appetizer and it was very light with amazing taste. A great way to start the meal so that you don't fill up too quickly. My husband had the Caesar wedge and he enjoyed that. He chose to stick with the meat options and ordered the Kobe short rib - it was melt in your mouth deliciousness. I ordered the Duet of Pacific Fish and really enjoyed the salmon. I was getting so full that I couldn't even get into the artic char. We had asked our waiter what the better sides were, since they all sounded divine. When he said the tater tots were very popular we were surprised, but compelled to try them after he described them. Wonderful, with a nice surprise of a cheese bit inside. Our other side was the lightly battered asparagus with a great dipping sauce. Neither of these are on the online menu, so they must change up the sides. I'm guessing that any one you chose would be fine.

And now to the dessert. In the reviews I had read before our trip it was emphasized that you must try the S'mores Brioche Doughnuts. We did and were not disappointed. Four battered and lightly fried marshmallows rolled in crushed graham crackers. Served with a warm chocolate ganache and a cool vanilla creme. Oh my! What a wonderful ending to a wonderful meal.

The service was good. We had two different waiters taking care of us and even the staff that comes around to fill glasses were friendly and readily agreed to take our picture. This is an atmosphere that could go towards the romantic or to a larger group of fun. We saw both there. The couple next to us was celebrating their anniversary and were brought a plate with Happy Anniversary written in chocolate and some sort of dessert ""popsicles"" (not ice cream) on the side.

I don't believe you would be disappointed if you eat here. Enjoy!",6UzxsqN8Fe4mny1Y9U_pSA,1,0,5,RuQmQboXurbtPiRJPhY8kA

Mr. Wynn has not only created a fantastic environment with his resorts which elevates high end hospitality well beyond the traditional beige + gold = 'fancy' equation, but he has opened his property up to near exclusivity with Vegans and Vegetarians. I end up at the Wynn or Encore every single time I am in Vegas because of this. We always have a mixed group of carnivores and vegans, and we know that we can go to ANY establishment in the Wynn and everyone will be thrilled with their food and Botero was no exception. The vegan menu is not just a compromise of what the chef can do, but a full menu with several choices for each course. None of this ""vegetable stack"" or ""we can do marinara with no meatballs"" stuff either, but well thought out and beautifully executed dishes. I had the potato risotto to start [the sauce was divine], the Vegan Chicken Pot Pie [Amazing!] and the penultimate, Vegan Churros for dessert. I can never have another vegan donut, fritter or churro again, because these things were so immensely good that I am now going to be forced to come here every time I am in Vegas, and all other attempts pale in comparison.

We made reservations for dinner at 8:30pm, arrived 10 minutes early, and still found ourselves having to wait almost 40 minutes to be seated (and 10 more minutes once we sat down). The decorations and feel of the restaurant are quite impressive...it is unfortunate the food and service are not up to par. We spent almost 400$ between five of us, and the experience was no better than eating at a nice restaurant for less than 100$. I ordered the Australian grass-fed New York Steak, medium I may add...and it was totally overcooked. Though the center was still pink, the outside was almost even a little burnt. The quality of the meat also was not impressive. I have had 25$ steaks before that were much much better than this one. We also had the octopus plate, which was okay, as well as one of their soups. My sisters had vegetarian options (these were the highlight from what we ordered). For sides, I had one of their potato dishes, which was average, and the grilled broccolini. This broccolini was absolutely amazing and if you do go here you need to get it. In addition, we ordered a ~120$ bottle of wine, which we have bought before for ~20$. To note we saw a bottle of Catena reserve 2010 on the wine list that cost ~310 that we have previously also bought for much less (~25-30$). Not only was everything grossly overpriced, but you'd expect for the money you're paying you'd get fantastic service. Unfortunately this was also not the case. The service was quite slow. Overall, definitely not a place I would ever recommend to anyone, unless $$ and time are not an issue.

819964,2009-12-30,3,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"I loved Botero steakhouse in the Encore. I ate there with my parents the day after Christmas before seeing Le Reve in the Wynn. First of all, the ambiance is so beautiful. When you enter Botero look at the bar to your right, in the back on the wall and covering part of the ceiling are different sized clear bottles with different colors in each making an awesome piece of art you wouldn't expect. The restaurant seating area is one large circular room with windows all around overlooking the outdoor pool area of the hotel. It's one of the most functional restaurants I've ever seen. With all the lush tableclothes, big quilted looking pillars, funky artwork, and comfy white chairs with hints of black, the decor is still polished and romantic. 
The hostesses were very welcoming and nice when we arrived. The lady who took us to our table was also very courteous, using our last name and pulled out our chairs for us.
Our waitress was super sweet and very knowledgable on all items of the menu. The busser was also very attentive to our needs and was on top of everything from clearing plates to never letting our glasses go empty, etc. 
On to the food..well they first bring you a basket filled with bread. At most restaurants I feel like the bread they serve beforehand isn't worth the calories, but this was delicious bread. There was white rolls, rolls with olives, and my favorite rolls with cranberries-sooo great. I shared a caprese salad next which they split onto two plates and it was the perfect size to keep me from filling up too much before my actual dinner came out. Then for my entree I had the dayboat scallops with wild mushrooms and polenta tortellini. The scallops were slightly breaded and cooked to perfection with a wonderful, wonderful brown sauce all around. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!

The bay scallops were phenomenal and accompanied by flavorful chanterelle mushrooms and oxtail ravioli.  I was scraping the plate it was so good.  The truffle mac and cheese was also good but didn't live up to my heightened expectations.  I'd heard it was life changing. Lies, I tell you, lies.

The s'mores brioche doughnuts were also a disappointment.  Everyone at my table was hyperventilating over them but they were kind of blah to me.

Also, the service was the kind you dread at ""fancy"" restaurants.  None of the waitstaff smiled and the managerial crew stalked around the restaurant looking grumpy.  It took forever (30 minutes) to get our drinks and the waitress seemed in a hurry to get away from us.  Tipping her was really painful.

931366,2015-07-22,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Ambiance, yeah it's got lots of that to make up for the mediocre steaks.  My wife and I went with two other couples expecting a 4-5 star restaurant quality steak.  My friend was especially exited on trying their wagyu beef, which he has had before at other steak restaurants.  Overall I believe everyone was a bit disappointed in the quality of the steak.  We had a late reservation, 9:30 PM, so we could dine after a show.  I ordered the bone in rib-eye which is my go-to steak of choice at any fine steakhouse.  I ordered it medium-rare with the Pepper-Style dipping sauces...because they sounded interesting (not that a steak should ever need sauce); the steak arrived about 1/2"" thick and cooked all the way through...I would say medium-well.  No one came by to see if our steaks were prepared correctly, the lighting was dark and there was no offering of a small flashlight to see...so I used my phone to double check an it was cooked all the way through for sure...no pink.  This was unacceptable so I told the waiter.  The waiter then brought the manager over, she was very unapologetic and said that that is how medium-rare should look.  This was funny to me...there was no sear on the steak, it looked like it was baked in the oven or something (everyone at the table said I should send it back because of the lack of sear).  Anyhow, she finally agrees to get me another steak...I promptly say to make sure that it's seared on the outside like everyone else's.  She actually agrees with me.  A few minutes later she arrives very sorry to say that this is the last rib-eye they have.  At this point everyone is almost done and I didn't want to bother as it took way to long to get the steaks to the table in the first place.  

I believe that steak was the last one for a reason...it was tough and thin and had a bunch of connective tissue running through it...not like any prime steak I have ever had.  My wife had the filet mignon, she liked it with the Chimichurri preparation...I tried some and agreed it was a good filet and the prep had a good flavor, another person had the filet prepared ""Simply Grilled"" and they said it was only OK.  Both filets were prepared as asked.  My buddy ordered the Snake River Farms Gold Grade Special Cut, which was advertised as an ""American Wagyu Beef"", now my friend has had the real thing from Japan and it's quite rich, and has had, and actually preferred, an Austrailan Wagyu to the Japaneses style that he had had in the past...It came out and was jsut ok like the other steaks...nothing special at all.

The best thing we had was the Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Wild Salmon Ceviche...both of these starters were fantastic.  The sides that came with the main course were lame, the mushrooms had no flavor and the Tater Tots were uninteresting...Everyone like the Twice Baked Potato...I did not try it.

Overall the service was 2 stars, the Ambiance was 4 stars, the food was 2.5 stars.

Sadly, even though they were slow we ordered two oyster appetizers (as only comes w/ 6 each) and the crab agnolotti and it took them almost 30 minutes.  They did give us some home made bread and pretzels which were yummy.

Although known for their steaks, we were in the fish mood especially when one of the specials was fresh flown in today dover sole but for the incredible price of $72.  I choose the halibut over the mediterranean sea bass based on the server's recommendation that the SB is with the skin and heavier and mixed with vegetables versus the halibut is flakier and his favorite fish.  We also ordered a side of the artichokes.

The dover sole, although flown in today was a bit chewy - if you can imagine.  The seasoning used was perfect and no additional sauce (that was on the side) was needed.  The halibut was perfectly cooked and delicious and so was the atichokes.  

Overall the food was pretty good but for 2 apps, dinner and two nothing fancy drinks - and no dessert - it was almost $300 WITHOUT tip!

First off, when did Pretzel bread go gourmet?  Yes, please give me mushy bread with bleached flour.  Secondly, when did stuffed zucchini flowers turn into tasteless deep fried eggrolls?  (They even had carrot strips - yikes).  The stuffed meatballs were ok but really nothing special, and I have produced better steaks off of my grill than the 20 oz ribeye we were served.  

I get more consistent steaks at Mon Ami Gabi than this place.  Save your coin and try the much more consistent Charlie Palmer at the Four Seasons.",J3un_p-xjbaJTWrZz8C9rg,1,0,2,wpCEoPmyPhU3OXUdUcMuTQ

However, when I requested Colombian coffee he was quick to answer that they did not offer it because ""Italian coffee is better"". Well, I had told him about my connection to Colombia and about the reasons why we had chosen the restaurant. However, he did not apologize for his poor comment.

The decor of a massive Botero statue in the middle of the restaurant and paintings were interesting but the view of the pool from the interrior was great. Would have been even better on the patio but the weather isn't ready for that yet in Vegas!

Started the meal with the server's recommendation to get the raviolis. Don't remember if they were a special or on the menu but they were a delight. Highly recommended. 

We each ordered the filet and I got it in their Chimichuri style. It was surprisingly not overwhelming as I thought it might be. The filet was cooked just as requested. We also ordered the asparagus and scalloped potatoes as sides. Wasn't too impressed with the asparagus but the potatoes were flavorful and cooked perfectly.

The dessert menu was a shining moment. We shared the mini cupcakes and chocolate soufflet. They were both excellent but the soufflet was served extremely hot, without warning.

The wine list was interesting but we ordered a bottle of our usual Cakebread.

Overall it was a pleasent dining experience but hopefully the service improves. For the restaurant being only about half full, our server dissappered after delivering the main course and didn't come back to the table for about a half hour. Not really 'upscale' dining as the restaurant does not have a dress code required. You could be eating next to a table with people in mumus.",foOEcAgwGKBWbWGSrdLgyg,0,1,3,oE5ckkdcS2eB6fgBZkQIOg

It was a rather intimate setting that faced either XS or Surrender which is a nice view.  Since we had dinner late around 9:30-10:00PM we could hear them cranking a lot of dance music which I was okay with but I definitely witnessed some couples get pretty irritated about that.

We shared starters to begin with, the carpaccio and a curry crabcake. Both were excellent the sizes were very appropriate for sharing. The waiter saw that we were sharing and brought over extra plates immediately. 

At this point I should note that the waiter also suggested that we move tables as well (Before the starter actually) because a light was broken ahich would have better illuminated our table. We moved and the next table was in fact illuminated perfectly and provided that nice privacy while being part of a dining experience.

For our entree we went with a bone in Ribeye which we shared. The waiter had it split for us and at Medium Rare it was perfect. We ordered it prepared chimichurri style and it was nice. I would probably go with something else next time, but it was flavorful. We split the truffle maccaroni and the pickled onions and marrow jelly (amazing if you are a marrow fan!)

We will definitely go back on our next visit to the Wynn. Make reservations even it it is the same day and just a few hours before you desire them. I probably do not have to mention it, but the art is superb as well. My wife loved her cocktail as well.

I was excited that they had remembered it was my mom's bday (told them at reservation time) and they brought out a beautiful plate with a small ice cream cupcake and ""Happy birthday"" written out. Nice! But not spectacular.

We went there because we were seeing Garth Brooks, so the evening was already starting off on a high note!!  The bread was ok at best, and then I got to the cranberry bread which broke my tooth!  Literally bitting into this piece of BREAD broke my tooth.  Fortunately it didn't hurt and there was nothing that was going to keep me from that concert, so we kept pushing.  The Tuna Tartar came out and it was so spicy, myy tongue was now burnt for the rest of the meal.  My husband said his salad was good, but I know him and if it was good, the plate would have been wiped clean and there was a lot left.

As for the main dish, I ordered the Black Bass, given fish is my favorite thing and bass is at the top of the list... It had NO taste!  I could have continued eating it, it was edible, but what was the point when there was no taste!  As a side I ordered the pistachio crusted asparagus which was different and the only thing that peaked my interest enough to eat.  My husband ordered the filet, he said his was ""not bad"" but next time he would get it ""without all the salt around it"".  He also got the mac & cheese, which I tried and was good, but for the price of this meal, I was REALLY GOOD!!

To top the meal off I had chosen the s'mores donuts... 2 of my favorite things in the world, what could possibly be wrong with these???  Bleh!  Again, no taste and while the concept is great, they failed on delivery!

My husband and I love a good steakhouse and do not mind spending the money when we walk away satisfiied...  If it were up to me I would eat at Mastro's Ocean Club every night, but with all the options in this town, it can't hurt to branch out....

I guess she was still irritated that I didn't order the $212 Kobe (she seriously sneered at us...on a $500 meal where we still left more than 20%, my own fault because she didn't deserve it).  Do NOT waste your money.  Marc LoRusso should be ashamed because I know Michal Mina trained him better than this.  This place is garbage.  Vegas has a million awesome steakhouses, and you are better off at any of those.  I was there on Friday, May 21st, and, five days later, I cannot stop ranting to everyone I know about how bad this place is.  

And just as a general FYI on the other food: it was all average.  Same bread as every other steakhouse.  Tuna Tartare was decent.  Asparagus and burrata salad was mediocre and the asparagus was overcooked.  The mac & cheese was average.  The artichokes (Roman style) were horrifying...no salt, no flavor, tasted like tree bark.

Meaty bunch got the Foie Gras followed by Steak - eye rolls all around from the deliciousness & plates were all but licked clean....& I think they would have totally licked if no one had been looking

The Foie Gras was an extremely large serving & was very tender & chocked full of flavor.  They were surprised to see it paired like an apple pie - the apple tart & ice cream pairings were unique & surprising & they actually ended up liking the pairing

Entrees for both meaty party-goers included steak & each was perfectly cooked, very tender & delish.  Buddy #1 got the regular mashed potatoes & Buddy #2 got the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  Again - huge eye rolls over the lobster & Buddy #1 secretly wished she had ordered these

Veggie crew got the Pumpkin Soup followed by Crispy Tofu & Quinoa Pasta

Pumpkin Soup was very savory & no hint of cream.  This soup reminded me of a pumpkin soup we had in Napa a while back & while it was pumpkinny, it was not the usual pumpkin soup you'd expect to find - nice change from the norm

The Crispy Tofu tasted like a big plate of fish sticks w/ a heap of spinach - not my taste at all & I was SO glad I hadn't ordered it but those that did each liked their dishes okay.

The Quinoa Pasta was like short pieces of spaghetti in a ton of sauce (less sauce might have been better) w/ lots of porcini mushrooms.  The shrooms were tender & flavorful - the sauce had a lemonny kick in the beginning bite & I thought this was going to ruin the dish for me as I do not like citrus in my food but the taste went away as the bite mellowed & there was no lemonny aftertaste so I ended up liking the dish

Sis chose the Mocha Pot de Creme for dessert & said it was thick, rich & creamy.  BF & I got the Pumpkin Martini & OMG you *have* to get this drink!  It was like a slice of pumpkin pie in a glass!  Everyone was totally jealous they had chosen other drinkys instead of this martini & rightly so!

Random people in costume walking around the restaurant - like an Angel who would extinguish your candle, make a little speech about lighting a candle for a wish, then lighting your candle again; a Devil walking around, promoting their ""Firewater"" cocktail; 2 people walking around w/ a big frame & an instant camera to take your picture.....made for an interesting experience

Couldn't make it because we were stuck gambling at the tables (not a winner either)

So it was Vday Encore gave us recommendations because Yelp wasnt working right in Vegas when I tried to look up steakhouses. Was totally weird because before vegas everything pulled up but in Vegas there was only 3 okay steakhouses that are not 4 stars but 3 stars. 

Had reservations at 6pm and came there around 5:50 and couldn't be seated by 6pm. 

When you walk in you feel like your stepping into another world. 

Great feeling.

Service: Wow the greatest by far. There are sections and there is always someone there to take your plate, another person to fill up your water. Not one for the entire restaurant but section.

okay now to the food.....................

ordered the seafood tower for 70 bucks:

Came with 1 lobster tail, 3 shrimps, 2 crab legs, I believe there was 4 oysters, 2 mussels and 2 clams. The oysters so yummy......well everything on there was yummy but i dont know if I would order again for that price.

ordered the 20 ounze bone ribeye.... so good and flavorful

Sides were 12 bucks each and we ordered the salad- eh its salad to go with the meal nothing great. We ordered the cream spinach which is really good and went along with our mashed potatoes.

I wanted to try the desserts but honestly with this meal and two glasses of wine I didn't have any room left. 

We just ordered too much for two people. 

I would definetely be back but wouldn't order so much.

I started off with the recommended ahi tuna.  They somewhat marinate it in something but it was so fresh and cold with bits of avocado and mango.  It melted in your mouth with great explosions of sweet and salty bits (that's what she said).  

My divas and I had either the New york Strip or Filet Mignon.  The NY Strip had no fat, they removed it for you and still completed at 8oz!  I had the Filet Mignon with Chimichurri sauce.  WOW!  Cooked at Medium rare, juicy and the not so overpowering sauce complemented the peppered steak.  

For sides, we had the broccoli which was tender and buttery along with the loaded potato gratin.  Let me tell you, it was like a layered lasagna but with thin slices of potatoes.  I would recommend this side.

Then to end it all we asked our server, who was right with everything and we tried the frozen chocolate candy bar.  Literally, a candy bar filled with layers of caramel, delicate wafer, chocolate ice cream, peanut butter then hugged with dark chocolate.  

What a way to end the night!",N__MW1fmn0yhMeNgaqeX5g,0,1,5,GTXv8mbL8r92JhGMahrzXg

We started off with soup tasting for two-- a perfect comfort food starter.  

As my entree, I had the filet mignon with chimichurri. The filet was juicy and cooked perfectly. The chimichurri was rubbed into the top of the steak and gave it some character. My husband had the salmon which was good, but we both agreed the steak was the showstopper of the evening. 

We ordered two sides: whipped potatoes and whipped sweet potato topped with marshmallow and infused with vanilla flavor. We treated the latter as dessert. Soooo gooood.

I'm sure botero has to mean large, or fat lol. Going into what I knew would be a heavily carnivorous meal, I needed some shellfish to lighten it up a bit. The oysters were great but the knock out were the prawns,  in Bloody Mary marinade and cilantro! Yummy!  As my salad I went for the arugula burrata salad.  Some may question spending this much on a salad that consists mostly of a tomato but in today's world, tomatoes taste nothing like they once did or supposed to taste. This tomato on the other hand was pure perfection. It reminded me of eating my grandparents tomatoes they would bring back from Florida in the early 90's.  They were red, juicy and non acidic, almost sweet!  If I could recommend anything here it would be the domestic lamb. It was cooked so perfectly, medium rare, exactly as ordered and was by far the most succulent lamb I've eaten in a while. The side of beans were memorable as well. The duck would have been better if that was cooked further than rare,( we ordered medium) but the sauce was also tangier and overpowering than I prefer, but I still devoured it.

Everything was excellent!  

We had the Kobe and it tasted like no other however for $175 you could get an awesome steak by going for the dry aged ny steak $55. 
The chimichurri rub is great, peppery and spicy. Don't forget to add the foie gras!

For desert, be sure to try the cupcakes which comes in a set of 5 different flavors with ice cream pairings. The blood orange sorbet is delicious as well. 

Great atmosphere, excellent service, food was out of control (in a good way).

For entrees, I decided after three meals of meat, I went with the salmon done two ways.

Firstly, I have to say that our waiter and the sommelier did an excellent job at mediating the situation. They're the only reason I'm giving this restaurant two stars instead of one.   

I'll get right to the point; after the starters, 4 out of 6 of us ordered steak, we returned 2 of the steaks because they were overcooked, one of them was dry. The steaks they brought out afterwards were undercooked. A thick cut filet, ordered medium rare, was fridge cold in the center, and the rib-eye, ordered medium, was just seared. We asked for our waiter but instead we were greeted by an arrogant manager named Josh. He was really rude to us and insisted that the steaks were cooked properly, but when asked, he offered no explanation in regards to proper cooking of the steak! All he repeated, in an borderline insulting tone, was that the steaks were cooked correctly. Needless to say, his attitude was really upsetting and two of our party still didn't have their entrees. 

One of our party was so upset that he lost his appetite and didn't want his steak back. The manager's answer to this was ""don't worry I won't make you pay for it"" in a really rude and arrogant tone.  At this point all we wanted to do was pay the check and leave. Our sommelier offered us complimentary deserts so we would stay but nobody accepted them. 

We were there to have a nice family dinner at one of our preferred restaurants in Vegas, but it was ruined by this character along with our high opinion of this restaurant. The only thing salvageable from this otherwise horrible experience was the poise and attitude from our waiter and sommelier, and we appreciate their invitation to come back so they can make amends. 

I sent a link to this review to the hotel manager so that he might know what we went through. Needles to say, we will not be dining at Botero again anytime soon.",8X2IQ4Fw-FpDmVx_HDVrnQ,5,0,2,fKty2XcOPfcgKyg8_vwHfQ

Which also gets me to the question of why did our waiter keep asking if we were ordering a vegetable side.  To appease him, we ordered the Brussel sprouts.  They were barely touched.

I felt like they weren't that happy to accommodate my food allergies but then again they weren't rude about it either. However, I could feel that when the chef came out to discuss the allergies, he def wasn't too happy. I told him that my food allergies aren't that severe and that as long as the food is not made with the allergens that it's fine. And they did try to work around it but it was not 100% - the tuna tartare definitely had chili peppers which I'm allergic to and they accidentally served me broccoli even though we had swapped it out for asparagus.

My friends and I decided to give Botero's a try during a recent Vegas trip and I still can't get the flavorful tastes of the rib eye off my mind.  So delish!  It pairs really well w/ the truffled mac & cheese which was beyond amazing!  Both are the best i've ever had!!  And for those non-meat eaters, the Branzino isn't a bad option either.  Also the cauliflower soup is a perfect starter!!  

So why the 4 stars??  One of my friends ordered the quinoa pasta and sadly this was disappointing.  Also I tried the wild mushroom tart and it wasn't all that.  

All in all I was impressed with Botero's.  The food was amazing and the ambiance so beautiful.  I'd definitely come back.",SQutoJk68PLrW1Kyq3qENA,0,0,4,5ubHdvPVMFiZjhOnKZSWzQ
1991267,2009-08-14,2,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"I almost missed out on Botero because of the mixed Yelp reviews.  Goes to show that it pays to dine outside the box from time to time.

Service was swell and the atmosphere excellent, trendy but not obnoxiously so, with lovely Boteros hanging all over the walls.  There's a special kind of welcome in those paintings, an invitation to eat that can only be extended by adorable toonish fat people.  Perhaps this explains why I stuffed myself to miserable excess.

It started with the bread tray, which came with three types of bread.  I didn't try the sourdough, but the olive was great and the cranberry was absolutely fantastic.  The bar was set, and it was high.

I came with a party of seven consisting of my very best friends who I've shared germs with since middle school, so this dinner was about as close to family style as you can get at a nice restaurant.  I had a fork in every pot, and there were many, many pots.  Everything was washed down with swills of a mellow pinot noir.

A shellfish tower kicked us off with fresh bites of select oysters, gulf prawns, Maine lobster, crab, and raw scallops in tangy sauce.  I found the lobster to be the least enjoyable tier of that particular tower.  The oysters and scallops were excellent.

For my meal, I ordered the olive oil poached halibut with haricot verts, fingerling potatoes, and warm balsamic vinaigrette.  This was a lovely piece of fish.  We split a variety of sides, which were great.  The asparagus and mushrooms were solid, and the truffled mac and cheese was a knock-out, smooth, rich, and aromatic.  The bone marrow with onion jam was a treat in that I'd never had bone marrow before, but I found it a little disappointing, with less flavor than I'd hoped for.

Bites from the buffet that is my friends' plates revealed a whole range of yumminess.  My favorite of the bunch was the ""pinwheel of wild salmon,"" which was salmon prepared two ways, both delicious.  One involved a butternut squash and apple risotto, and the other a roasted cauliflower puree and lemon caper emulsion.  The salmon was nicely cooked and the accompanying flavors were a good interesting mix of sweet, salty, and yum.  Ahi tuna tartare with mango, avocado, and crispy ginger was also a notable dish.  The organic roasted chicken and the prime rib were good, but not particularly moving.  Ditto for the potato gnocchi with roasted tomato and parmesan - decent gnocchi but mildly boring.

Dessert was excellent.  By the time the menus came around most of our party felt too stuffed to order and we ended up splitting two desserts (that's me eating 70%, the other six people eating 30%, as I am not a normal, socially acceptable human being).  The warm banana bread pudding with homemade banana ice cream was just dazzling.  The mini ice cream sandwiches (chocolate with vanilla, chocolate with mint, strawberry cheesecake, and rocky road) came in an adorable rack and tasted great, my favorite being the rocky road.

All in all, this was a fabulous meal in a pleasant environment.  I was very happy that I had chosen to wear a rather billowy dress to dinner, because underneath those skirts, my belly was straight out of a Botero.",WWnhqRnWWjutMqh-2SzEuQ,2,2,4,ZXe-rFPaVS7-YAiJI63wkA

We took a bottle of Opus One 2005 (bought it for $130 in LA; the restaurant charges $430 for the bottle or $50 corkage fee per bottle). We ordered a steak (filet w/ chimichurri sauce) with sauteed mushrooms and mac n cheese sides, along with a few appetizers including the steak tartare and foie gras.  The appetizers were GREAT but the main was just OK.  It was my first time eating steak with chimichurri sauce, and I didn't like it too much.  But, I still give Botero a 5.

We actually dined here twice during out stay in Vegas, and cannot wait to go back. My husband had the Rib Eye steak w/chimichurri and it was absolute perfection! Cooked and seasoned properly, it was melt in your mouth from the first bite to the last. Easily the best I have ever sampled. I tried the Filet on our second visit and, again, cooked to perfection and full of flavor. Sides we ordered were the Broccoli w/sun dried tomatoes and garlic & potato gratin, swiss chard, gruyere cheese. Both were fabulous w/the gratin being a stand out for sure. For a potato dish, this was light and delicate but packed with flavor. A must have when we return. Appetizers were the Dungeness Crab Agnolotti and Kobe Sort Rib Ravioli. The agnolotti was fabulous (we had on both trips), and the ravioli just got better as you ate it. 

Food beautifully prepared without being pretentious. Service was spot on, not to fussy with just the right personalities. Wish we could find a place like this at home:) 4 stars only because the wine by the glass list can stand more options.

I am a people watcher and was entertained by how the club went from empty to packed!  

Food:  Mediocre.  Friends had the steak and it was not mouthwatering.  I had the halibut and it was subpar.

Steaks Chops:
New York Steak prepared with the peppers and chilis- (Salty)
Bone in New York Steak prepared salt and pepper - (Salty)
Bone in Rib Eye prepared Chimichurri - (Salty)
Lamb Chops - (bitter, weird sauce with the chop, not appetizing)

Sides:
Mac and Cheese - (Tasty, cheesy, and buttery, can't go wrong with this)
Bone Marrow - (Very generous portion of marrow, delicious)
Brocollini - (2nd saltiest side there was)
Sauteed mushrooms - (saltiest thing of the night)
Tater Tots - (Pretty good!)

Deserts:
Creme Brulee with Blueberry - (Mediocre at best)
I forgot the name, but it's a Cronut with caramel ice cream and caramelized bananas - (Really great flavor, probably best dish of the night which is not saying much)  

Service:
Service was terrible, considering this was a $500 meal.. you would think we would receive at least some decent service.. but no.. we had to waive down our waiter several times for drinks and service.  We were given desert without utensils.  Not once did our server approach us to see how we were doing.  We still tipped because we aren't barbarians.. but something needs to be done about this.

Conclusion:
If you want something salty.. save yourself some money and buy a salt lick.  If you want to waste your money on an overrated steak joint.. then you've found the right place.",WVxn61AvjNS7aK6BkEGCSA,1,0,1,7DQZpBI4GvoBkdYiJTIEGw

Next, we ordered the crudo tasting which was delicious (especially the hamachi).  Would recommend.  We split the 28-day aged NY strip steak which was a beautiful cut, seasoned and cooked to perfection.  Yums!  We then finished it all off with the signature dessert - milk chocolate bon bon lollipops!  A cute, delicious, whimsical way to end the meal.  NOM!  Will come back for the food and the memories!

The quality was definitely not worth the 200~ dollars we spent. I understand why these steaks come with 3 different sauces. The meat was just to dry and rough. No juices flow after cutting and I really had the dip the sucker for taste, but I did like the middle spicy sauce. The king crab meat was probably the best thing there but for 25~ dollars extra, you only get maybe 3-4 strips.

2144251,2015-04-16,4,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Lately I've been choosing Botero when I get to Vegas. However before coming to Vegas I usually have a list of places I want to conquer but somehow....I end up here and what's great about  Botero is that it does not disappoint and I don't regret not going to the other places!! 

Botero is located in the Wynn, in between Wynn and Encore. 

Upon entering the restaurant, you are greeted by the hosts and their bar. The bar itself is small with a traditional bar setting and a few tables with oversized chairs to sit in while sipping your favorite drink before they call to seat you. 

The restaurant is set to a sexy low dim light level with the help of a fountain in the middle. You can see the nightclub Surrender from almost every angle when sitting down. 

I am always greeted promptly and served with their selection of amazing breads. On the last few occasions that I've gone, their selection of bread were always different. It is served with a lemon infused ricotta cheese spread and it is flavorful. I don't think I ever want butter on my bread ever again. It is light with a hint of lemon taste to it. 

For starters, we've ordered the crudo tasting and although small, it is one of my favorite. You get to sample a little bit of everything. The fish are sliced perfectly. Delicate yet still deliver big on flavor. It is fresh and melt in your mouth. The selection of fish on the plate are easy on the palate for a starter. 

On one other occasion, the special of the night was a tomahawk steak. Not only was this beefy awesome to goodness amazing but it was huge. All of our mouth dropped open when we saw the size of it. Two guys gobbled down on it and there was still meat left. The tomahawk was the highlight of their meal. It was cooked to perfection. Perfectly pink in the center and tender. The flavor of the meat was marinated perfectly. No condiments were required. 

On my most recent trip, I ordered the brioche crusted salmon. I thought it was weird at first but after the first bite, I was sold. The buttery flavor from the brioche crust on the salmon played very well into the flavor of the salmon. The salmon was cooked to a perfect medium rare. I ate it happily and finished it without stopping. 

Feeling already bad....we ordered the truffle Mac and cheese to add more onto our mouth. Yes, it is creamy, cheesy, dense, and rich. You get a good taste of the cheese and then the truffle plays in the background without overwhelming anything else. I can honestly sit and eat the entire Mac and cheese. 

The desserts here fills me with delight!! There is something about simple desserts that satisfy the soul after having a fulfilling meal. The selections are seasonal and I always feel like it compliments the entire experience. Some desserts are very rich (dark chocolate) and some are light (seasonal sorbets). 

The service is pretty attentive and the waiters and waitress ensure that our fluids are topped off and clean plates are always there.

There was only a single time when service lacked attention and the food took longer than their usual wait time but other than that one misfortune, service and quality of our meals have been great.",Ynce0QDq4bdnXFxhhnL6wQ,7,6,4,vOwX2oCoGpJddqX72drBvA

They had just closed, but the nice bartenders asked the chef if it was too late. He agreed to help us out, but asked that we place our orders quickly. Super cool move, and one that won't be forgotten.

The restaurant is fancy and pricy. But also had a badass decor, and is in a great location along the pool and botanical gardens at the Encore. 

We ate light because it was late and we didn't want to bust the kind chefs balls. So we went with two appetizers - the Dungeness Crab Ravioli with Artichoke Hearts and with the Scallops over Risotto.  Both were out of this world delicious!

Then came the dessert, and with it a HUGE claim... The best dessert I've ever had. The S'mores Brioche Doughnuts were the shit! Little marshmallow filled crumb donuts, with hot fudge and hot cream sauce on the side. Jesus, amazing!  We also had the Caramel Apple Bread Pudding with Cinnamon Ice Cream - it was also incredible.  But the donuts stole the show! 

All in all, a GREAT place for Vegas dinner. I will be back for the main course. And the desserts are screamin! FIVE STARS!",4ULkSSMp3-JH8HegrlfgzQ,2,0,5,6WEBsFMRT1yplnApp0K7JQ

Why is your Encore Resort and Casino DEAD EMPTY on a Friday Night, during an awesome spring day and evening towards the end of April???  Furthermore, why is everything so freakin RED!?!?!?!?

Didnt stay there...but i did gamble....some new game called Blackjack Switch......either im gettin too old, or these new games are too advanced.  Anyhow, on to BOTERO!

Not as stuffy as Mastros.  Not as obscene as CUT.  Not as BUTTERY as Ruth's Chris.  Not so boring as Nick & Stefs.  Not as avg. as AJ's at the Hard Rock.  Top 5 of all time...a very strong candidate!

Friday's Menu:

Kettle One & Tonics and Rounds of Apple Martini
Hamachi Tartare on Crispy Rice
Ahi Tuna Tartare w/ Mango, Avocado, Crispy Tuna on Flatbread
Duet of Salmon
Rib Eye w/ Chimichuri
Asparagus wrapped w/ Prociutto
Truffle Mac n Cheese
Burnt Smores (Deconstructed with a ROCKIN Vanilla En Glaze)

Hamachi-Almost Perfect.  The crispy rice got a little chewy, and lost its crispyness...BUT A FIRST RATE APP!

Tuna was avg.  Very fresh, but missing some heat and a bit of Citrus... Also FLAT BREAD doesnt go well....too bland and the black sesame seeds run all over.

Salmon Duet- One of the most PERFECTLY COOKED salmon ever... med-rare, seasoned perfectly, moist and juicy, and oh so fresh.  Nice job of searing at a steakhouse!

Rib Eye-  Very nice....a tad below Mastros, but chimmichuri was outta this world....great RUB!

Asparagus- Couldve eating another 1/2 dozen....grubbin.

Tuffle Mac N Cheese-  ALMOST PERFECT!  Truffle was not overpowering, and seasoned perfectly....only issue is....for a high end steakhouse.....i cant believe you cant find something other than ELBOW MAC to serve such a luxurious side!!?!?!!!?!!!
Burnt Smores Deconstructed.... This was fun.  Vanilla en Glaze and a nice dark roast coffee was perfectly balanced....

Service first rate!  Jane or Jani...if you have her, in the center of the room, PLEASE LISTEN to her.  She was on point with every suggestion, and always made sure her or her runners were checking on us.

We came here by chance due to a mix-up in reservations at another steakhouse and they were able to accomodate our large group (although they did have to put us outside - it was a warm summer night and we had to deal with some of the noise from the XS nightclub). 

Overall, I was impressed with the steaks, service and overall quality of Botero. I hadn't heard too much about Botero, but was glad that we had a chance to try the place. Since there was a mix-up at the other restaurant, we did get a few freebies courtesy of the other manager and my host.

Steaks and sides - had the bone-in rib eye which was done very well and everyone else that ordered different steaks were happy with what they ordered.

I had the vegan tasting menu - and I can honestly say from the staff to the food was probably the best dining experience I've ever had. 

Starting with a breadbasket filled with yummy rolls and breads - my favorite being the soft pretzel roll served with vegan butter.  Next up was a gorgeous, lush and creamy Cauliflower soup made with soymilk and almonds - just stellar.  

The Panzenella Salad, microgreens with  tiny slivers of pear and apple served on a wood plank and perfectly dressed with a vinaigrette, was pretty great.  The pear and apple slivers were like tiny flavor explosions in my mouth.  Nice and balanced against the creaminess of the soup.

Quinoa Pasta with cashew cream was delish as well, although maybe not as memorable now that I'm writing this review 2 months after we dined.  I'm not a huge eater and was already getting fairly full at this point - but I took a deep breath and plowed onward.  

Next up Roasted Acorn Squash with toasted tofu - topped with toasted pepitas which added some crunch.  Now, to be honest, I kind of think that roasted squash is kind of a vegan cop-out in a way, fairly obvious and not too out of the box.  That said it was really well done with clear squash flavors that bordered on buttery.  

I'm not much of a sweets person, but the Pear Crumble for dessert was quite good.  The staff recognized our anniversary with a couple of complimentary grape sorbet canels to split which were a perfect pick-me-up after having so much stellar food. 

The service was friendly and welcoming, something I personally enjoy in a high-end restaurant. 

Expensive? YES!  But worth it!",KFWOn7x19RmrO6kzTJYmrQ,5,2,5,B6XrOrloJ2Ft3Kn0uoY5Qg

We were seated at a large round table in the front of the restaurant, which was perfect for our group.  Service was slower than I expected from an establishment of this caliber, but they kept telling us it was the ""busiest night of the year"" so we let it slide.  Our group started off with different appetizers, none of which I tried because I was saving myself for the steak.  But the appetizers all looked good: oysters, caesar salad, soup, tuna tartare.

For the steaks, they offer 3 different methods of preparation.  Chimichurri sauce, peppercorn and traditional.  Not sure why anyone would go to a steakhouse and ruin their wonderful steak with sauce, but I guess to each his own.  Of course, I got my petite filet traditional style.  My fiance had the rib eye, aalso traditional style.  Both cuts of meat were cooked PEREFECTLY, very tender, and  flavorful.   We also shared the garlic brocolli, which was very good.  You can add lobster to your steak for just $20, which most people at our table did, and it looked very delicious.  I was here for the steak and the steak only, and that's why I didn't really bother with much else (except a few Grey Goose martinis).     

Overall, I give the steak 5 stars.  The service, 4 stars.",r3efcEywbG9WPorAtNx2Ug,0,0,5,IeHboPj0BI522Z-WxI4vIw

Not everyone has money to splurge on dinners like this so if you're one of those people that would consider here for a ""special dinner""- I'd recommend one of the MANY other steakhouses in Vegas.  (Del Friscos being my suggestion.)

I got the 16 oz New York strip.  I typically get filet mignon when I'm out but when I cook, New York strips are my favorite cut. I made a mistake because the strip was so bad.  I just searched reviews on here and it looks like other people had good experiences with the cut.  In fact people keep mentioning something that simply did not hold true for me- there was so much fat on it.  There was a full, thick row of fat on the side of meat and it was the first thing I bit into.  It was also burnt.  I get my steak medium-rare and I appreciate having a crispy exterior with a soft inside but this was not the case.  What's odd is the pink inside was on par with medium-rare but the texture was so dry and tough.  If I had paid 66$ (pre-tax!) for that steak I would have sent it back and been pissed.  

I tried a lot of the sides and I think the mac-and-cheese was the best.  The mashed potatoes were really standard, as well as all the veggies (creamed spinach/asparagus/mushrooms).  I have had side dishes stand out before at steakhouses but they were very run of the mill here.

Aside from the entree, everything else was great.  The service was very professional, helpful, and prompt.  We had quite a few seafood appetizers and they were very good.  The dessert... the doughnut one with peanut butter... was super good.  That was my favorite dish haha.

There are too many steakhouses in Vegas for me to ever recommend this one.  The quality of the steak just isn't what I'm used to at steakhouses of this caliber.",TsEE8dZYoAa-Tzzem3yjRw,1,1,3,j-IErUbsILn0NAmpP7vlmg

the beet salad was good.  the soups were ok.  the mushroom and onion was like any french onion soup.  the duck and squash reminded me a bit of the trader joes butternut squash soup that comes in a box.  there were bits of something in it though ... maybe squash.  i had the hamachi tartare as my main and i think it might be because i ate it after i ate some bites of steak but it was fishy.  and there was a bone in it.  and the fried tater tots were hard and not edible at all.

my bf got the bone in something, i forget which.  and it was really good.  he got the chimichurri one and it was well flavored and moist.

oh and the mac and cheese that people rave about?  not the best ive had at all.  in fact it was nowhere near the top.  they serve it in little skillets making you think its hot, but its not.  it was barely warm.  we also had the spinach side with egg.  the egg was fried almost like a scottish egg but it was yucky.",NpU44ANnUUNQWY4U0eUGvA,0,0,3,zGU1qTAFaze-08SyWNpg1Q

Walking up to the entrance you will likely see three or more girls at the hostess station, it won't be clear what they're all doing, but one will likely acknowledge and call yet another girl over to seat you. Try and ignore the huge Fernando Botero statue in the middle of the dining room. It's difficult, but you'll enjoy your meal more if you're not distracted. This is made easier because the dining room is ""upscale dark"". However, the views of the pool outside are nice, it looks like the patio might be really nice as well. 

I have only had the Chateaubriand here along with various sides. It's fantastic. The whipped potaoes, asparagus, and other sides are good. The brussels sprouts (if they have them)  are pretty much worth it all by themselves. One interesting thing about the food is that the ""pepper steak"" preparation listed on the menu isn't a black pepper rub. They cut jalapeno peppers with the steak and leave serve them on the plate.

2442767,2012-09-03,10,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"(Best read with the accompaniment of film noir music and a crisp city inflection)

It was hot.  muggy like a coffee holder hot.  I had picked a bad week to quit the smokes but business had dried up and I hadn't seen a case since an advertisement for lunch boxes slipped out of my copy for the evening times.  

I shouldn't have been surprised when she walked into my room, looking like sex and trouble, hell, she was staying with me for crying out loud, but the lady was a specimen in short hemlines and legs that needed their own mile-markers.  

She had told me she had a proposition for me and no sooner had the words escaped past her lipstick I had flung my two button blazer over my shoulder and offered her the suddenly lonely inner crook of my elbow.  

The lady had needs, and unfortunately for me they all revolved around food.  Thankfully I always keep running reservations at two or three spots around town for just such a need so we strolled out of the room towards sustenance.  

I kept my roscoe in my other coat because something told me this night would have more to do with fending off the looks of local roustabouts than plugging some unlucky sucker between the eyeballs, and if it came down to it, I'd gladly come to fisticuffs with some palooka in order to get things back on the straight and easy.  

We moseyed into Botero around a half after six less than twelve and I told the Dolls at the desk that the Dame I was with needed to have her rump sat at a table that'd fit the bill, and then to make my case I slipped them each a sawbuck and winked like a one-eyed man.  

They looked out at the empty restaurant and then asked me why I was talking like that and I told them lip would only get them an overbite so they took the bait and led us to what I no doubt believe was the best seat in the joint.  

This Botero fellow was a Columbian and my last run-in with them had left me two-slugs light and a pocket full of spinach, but I decided to curb that story and pulled out the Roundheels' chair.  We were seated at the center of attention, the best spot in the house, right behind the eight foot ass crack of the centerpiece statue.  

The stool-pigeon at the table next to us recommended the Ahi Tuna Tartare so we called for that with some of the Graacher Himmelreich because hey, the wars been over for a couple of years and I'm not the only GI who's gone too long without having a good German wine.  It smelled like bubblegum and tasted like the sweetness she was dishing me with eyelashes that looked more like tiny come-hither fingers.  Problem is, my name's not Hither.  

The sommelier was a real flash in the pan if you ask me, nice guy with all the right answers, for the questions I asked.  But was I asking the right questions?  We split the Caprese salad because everything Italian has moxie and the burrata cheese forced me to look this prize horse in the mouth, we considered each other for a couple of seconds before continuing on.  For dinner she fileted the Mignon petitely and I scalloped from day boats with the chef gerrymandering my dish and turning it into a real tomato.  

The man with the vino smarts spun a tale on meritage and the lady went French and we ate like Helen Keller sang...with our hands.  

It's a good thing the vitis vinifera worked cuz if it hadn't I might've had to squirt some metal (always keep the midget in my sock).  

Overall this dump is a real snazzy joint and I'm glad this Jasper Botero chose to open it from the grave.  Don't indulge on too much hooch over near the bar, whoever designed it ran of room and decided to get all hanky panky with the ceiling, which would be fine, if ceiling was a misspelling of Celine, some cocktail doll with too much time on her hands, but unfortunately that ain't the case.  

We sauntered out on our getaway sticks trying not to appear hinky.  She was a looker and I was a gumshoe and we were in the thick of our food comas, thoroughly satiated. 

We took it on the heel and toe, but not before she kissed me like her tongue had a message from a snitch.

Ahhh yes, I know your kind!

This was our cheaper dinner. Wait until my next review to see where we REALLY splurged because this is so not the place to do it.

We had a Friday night restaurant, sitting by the window, facing Encore Beach Club's European pool (nope, didn't see any boobies). The menu focuses on steaks and seafood. We were going to get the shellfish tower $65.00 but when our server said it was simply 2 of each (oysters, clams, lobster tails, etc), we passed, thinking it was too much food along with the appetizers we were going to get. Sooo not worth the price either.

Instead we ordered frog legs, hamachi tartare and crab agnolotti for our appetizers and steak tartare and dayboat scallops for our entrees. We also ordered a half bottle of sancerre to start.

While we waited, servers came by and placed cocktail and tartar sauce on our table. I thought, wait, did we ordered the shellfish tower? And then I saw it coming to our table: that damn shellfish tower!

There seemed to be some miscommunication but after they took the tower away, I thought, wait. He thought we ordered 3 appetizers and a shellfish tower. He should have spoke up and mentioned it might have been a bit too much food. Mistake #1.

Our appetizers came out and all were good but nothing great.

- Frog legs: I didn't really like the frog legs and not because they were frog legs but because it just had no flavor. Came with a bubbly buttery garlic sauce but I passed. BF ended up adding salt to this dish. The side salad was good though.

- Hamachi Tartare: Good but overrated. NOT your typical tartare. They placed them on top of crispy (stale tasting) rice. Why?! It was too sweet for my taste too.

- Crab Agnolotti: Very, very, very good. Creamy and plenty of crab! Yummy artichokes too :)

- Scallops: 4 big scallops with a sweet sauce. Not something my bf anticipated and he got sick of this dish quick. I would say it was not something we would order again. BF ended up adding salt to this dish.

- Steak tartare: I was going to get this as an appetizer but none of the entrees impressed me so I got this. Pretty good. Not the tastiest I've ever had. Egg yolk (quail) was small. Needed some dijon mustard on the side and maybe some more salt. Actually, my bf finished this dish for me and added salt.

- Birthday dessert: I only ate the top portion since the bottom was caramel (grossss).

The wine was good but they brought out the wrong one (mistake #2). We were comped a bottle though, that was awesome (and necessary).

Our bill was about $210, minus tip. I shivered not because it was expensive but because I felt like the food was not worth it. But what in Vegas isn't expensive?!

Oh yea, our bill had the shellfish tower on it still (mistake #3) so you might want to carefully check it.",BI_PXSF5M61S8O9bqR7VVA,8,7,3,u33cI2mV48wt4KhkhyoIqQ

With that out of the way everything was perfect, really.  The service and food was fantastic.  We ordered the Vegan tasting menu which we loved. Out of 5 dishes, 4 were perfect and one was too salty.  When the server saw we didn't finish the salty dish he insisted on bringing us out another one which was great (I wouldn't of sent it back - if its my personal taste I don't bother, only if there is something they screwed up).  Vegan bread and butter was great. Also for the extra sensitive vegans out there I would say there is little risk of them mistakenly giving you something not vegan because they were smart and set up protocols so all the servers know you are vegan. For example they bring the vegan butter out in a bowl (but regular butter on a plate) so even the bussers that you didn't talk to know to replace with vegan butter even without talking to you or your server.

There are two outdoor patios overlooking the Encore pool which comes to life at night when XS opens. The real masterpiece is the giant golden woman in the center of the dining room. No expense was spared, from the iPads at the bar listing out the drink menu in addition to providing background on the wines available and the art on display, to the lights above each table operated by remote controls so each diner can have lighting dimmed or brightened to their request. 

My friend (who actually used to manage here) and I stopped in to say hi to their new chef, chat, and get a bite before Botero closes its doors soon to become Society Cafe in the interim, before becoming an entirely new concept! I don't know if it was the wine we had at the Eastside Lounge, or the fact that I'm leaving Vegas and feel the need to eat the whole city before I go, but we decided to throw caution to the wind, and order the caviar with some champagne. Well, it was obviously delicious- it was Osetra, and quite reasonably priced for 15g at $105. Other restaurants on the strip serve the exact same thing for twice the price! The real standout star was the Poblano Chile and Corn Creme Brulee. I don't want to be inappropriate here.. But it was like sex served up hot in a cast iron skillet. 100% on my list of top 5 best things I've ever eaten.  

We had some tastings of the heirloom tomato salad which was elevated with the addition of a kalamata olive, and the beet salad was great as well. If you have a chance to go in before it closes- ask for Mora as your server!",bkcWR-bVxx4wjRkjZdUfNQ,4,3,5,lSP2CVdFGf4NbGQ8zx27SA

Upon arrival, we were seated at a beautiful table in the outdoor patio area -great for people watching because it's located right outside of XS Nightclub (so you get quite a bit of foot traffic) yet it still feels very intimate & romantic at the same time. 
We started out with the Shellfish Tower Appetizer which was an absolute delight. The presentation was incredible, from the Chilled Prawns to the Maine Lobster, King Crab Legs & Oysters...Eyerything was fresh & delicious, served with delicious dipping sauces. What an incredible way to start the evening! Next we tried the Kobe Short Rib Ravioli...WOW...SO Delicious! The savory richness of the kobe beef paired with the freshly rolled pasta & shaved parmesan cheese was outstanding & really hit the spot. We also shared the Brussel Sprout Salad with Crispy pork belly, marcona almonds & parmesan cheese. Everything we ordered was SO YUMMY!!!
Instead of a main course we decided to save room for dessert, and opted for the ""Baked Alaska"" with Lemon Semifreddo, Madeline Cake, Orange Marmalade and Grapefruit Foam.

2841449,2009-11-18,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Second night of our Honeymoon we decided to try Botero after some drinks at the lobby bar which is on the Encore side of the property.  After a quick 3 minute walk we were on the Esplanade entering Botero.  We got there around 10pm and were seated immediately.  
     
     The service here was impeccable.  I can't go into the details, because there were too many of them, but one thing that really stuck out was when the sommelier came over and asked for our first drink selection.  Having already had cocktails at the Lobby bar, we were ready for some champagne.  At this point I was a little flustered.  I hadn't yet opened the menu to order the appetizers, and I didn't really know what champagne to order, or whether or not I wanted a half or a whole bottle.  Half heartedly, I ordered a small bottle for around $65, and then proceeded to look at the food menu.  Our waiter Mike came and we placed our order of the hamachi tartare, the kobe beef tartare,  and the bone in 12 oz filet with a half lobster tail.  After that another sommelier, Blair, came to our table with two sparkling glasses of Rose' champagne.  ""We understand that you are on your honeymoon.""

""Why yes, yes we are.""

     ""Well we want this dinner to be special for you, so these two glasses are on us.  When you are ready to choose a red for your entree, we'll come back to help you with your selection.""  Like I said, impeccable.

     The rest of the evening consisted of talking with our waiter Mike, and finding out that he is a Thai, and that he has 3 kids, and when they vacation they like to go to Hawaii to get away.     We also got more in-depth with our Sommelier Blair, who recommended a great Flying Goat Pinot, and told us a story about how the wine got its name, something to do with goats jumping over a fence to graze on grapes.  He's 28 and has been working at the restaurant since it opened.  It was interesting that in such a high end establishment, everyone showed such a human and friendly side.  And oh yeah, the food...or should I say porn... the Hamachi tartare was served on a bite sized  bed of fried rice cake and had a teriyaki inspired flavor.  The kobe beef tartare was finely minced and ruby red served with micro greens and crostini.   Another little detail was when we ran out of crostini; Blair brought us another couple to finish off the appetizer. SERVICE!  

     The steak and lobster combo was so good I chewed the bone, risking the embarrassment of being looked at like a heathen by the staff, and getting steak juice all over my new Michael Kors suit.  To end the evening, they brought us out a mini ice cream candy bar and two glasses of Sheri that had nuances of orange peel, honey, and grape.  That on the house  as well... a little good luck send off, and thanks for dining with them on our honeymoon.  If you watch the in room Wynn Television, the song playing when they highlight Bottero is ""Be Our Guest"" a fitting song from a Disney fairy tale.

Sides: I'm a mac-n-cheese connoisseur, and Botero's white truffle Mac was among the best I've had. Though it was simple, it had a rich, distinctive flavor. I find myself craving this dish often.

We relayed this information to our server who went back to the chef to see if our dishes would be out in time.  They were.

On this visit, my dining partner and I ordered the same dish - the petite fillet mignon.  I ordered the scallop pairing with my dish.  Now, like I've said before, its hard to mess up quality meat.  But, what made this dish extraordinary, which many steak places seemed to be swaying away from is the sauces.  Our steaks came with three very different yet all equally delicious sauces.  In all honesty this was the key to an amazing steak dinner.  But, not only did those sauces pair wonderfully with the meat, they paired great with the seafood.

In LV rarely do you go back to a place to eat, there is just so much to discover.  But, I think this is a place I will definitely go back to visit.

Booked a large group for a birthday party last November.  It was one of very few restaurants that could book 12 without going to a private room.  The ambiance of a lot of Vegas Restaurants I think still relies on the dining room and the atmosphere.  

With a lot of different tastes sitting at the table, a lot of diverse items were explored.  A few had the Tasting of soup to start.  All of they felt that one of them was way too salty, almost too salty to eat. I believe it was the mushroom and proscuitto.  

I started with the Tasting of Ham and Cheese.  Title sounded funny, but was awesome. Iberico ham is fantastic and if cured meats is your thing, try it when it's available.  The serving size was almost too big though as I was starting to feel full when I finished.

Most people had steak and they do it very well. They offer 3 choices for preparation.  Peppersteak, Chimichurri, and traditional.  If you love a great steak, stick with traditional.  If you like exploring new flavors, chimichurri is my favorite.  

We were all so full, only one had dessert.  I'm glad she was sitting next to me, as I got to try her pick.

We made our way to the main dining room and were presented with such an extensive list of wine and cocktails, it took us some time to decide. 

I enjoyed a glass of French white wine which paired beautifully with the crudo tasting appetizer which I ate as my main meal. The side of spicy chili and garlic broccoli rabe served in a small black cast iron skillet was a real star that night. Others enjoyed the truffle Mac and cheese, filet steaks, olive oil poached halibut and some raw bar items. To top it off, we shared the bone marrow which was so gigantic and rich that it nearly sedated our group! I didn't partake but the guys in our group seemed to enjoy. Portions here are ample and while it isn't inexpensive, you definitely feel satiated after dining here. We skipped dessert in favor of some additional cocktails. 

The vibe here is sophisticated but cool. The space is large, modern and looks out on the large Encore pool. Service was friendly and attentive. Perhaps the best part of Botero is the variety on the menu.

We had no desire to order any entrees after that, especially since the waiter seemed to loose the track of time from time to time.

The sides were yummy, esp the yams with marshmellow. The desserts were so so. The souffle was easily forgettable and i've had better cupcakes at bakeries in san francisco. My biggest complaints though, which dropped this place from 3 to 2 stars for me - They charged us for an extra bottle of wine and it was a pain to have it dealt with, esp. with room charges and credits. We were never offered coffee/expresso at the end of the meal which again is a big no no in my book if you are going to a nice restaurant.

3146640,2011-04-05,2,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Looking for a steakhouse without the pretentious and stuffy vibes? Go to Botero, located in the Esplanade (fancy word for walking area) at the Encore. With modern decor- black and white details, sleek furniture, cushioned pillars and a giant black Botero statue sitting atop a fountain in the middle of the circular dining room- Botero is a feast for the eyes as well as for one's stomach. 

We got a table perfect for two right next to the giant Botero statue. And while my dining partner got a lovely view of the statue's derriere, I got a fantastic view of the pool area outside. 

Anyways, on to the food- the best part about Botero. 

The bread basket came with two types of bread- mini cranberry baguettes and a fun-shaped plain french roll- and a yummy cube of herb butter. The bread was warm, but the butter was cold (I assume to keep it's perfect cube shape), which made it difficult to scrape without worrying about it flying off the plate. 

I ordered the Organic Roasted Chicken- quartered pieces of moist chicken (bone-in) roasted to perfection swimming in natural jus and topped off with a light frisee salad that had sweet roasted onions and shavings of roasted red tomatoes (or peppers) in it. Each component of the dish worked well together, balancing perfectly with one another to create a flavorful, savory & satisfying entree. 

We also ordered a side of Broccoli with very small pieces of sun dried tomatoes and lots of garlic. The broccoli was fresh and green, and cooked well with still a bite to it. The sauce the broccoli was in was light and garlicky. Overall, a good choice.

I also tried a few pieces of the Bone-In Rib Eye 20 oz Chimichurri-style cooked medium plus (between medium and medium-well apparently). The Chimichurri crust was a bit too salty, but the meat itself was tender and flavorful. 

Normally at fancy restaurants with high prices, you don't expect large portions. Well, expect large portions here. We were both surprised at the portion sizes, especially the chicken dish (20 oz steak is ""to be expected"" a lot of food). Needless to say, we were both full.

The service wonderful, the food delicious and the design playful and beautiful- What's not to like?",PspDTd6CrF1aUtdC_k73-w,3,2,5,kOFmQE7d4For5GPQGe2ycw

I was here last night with about 20 other girls in our group for a promotional dinner thing that they called a Princess Party for Very Important Princesses. Lol. It was really cute because we all had tiaras waiting for us as we sat at our table. I was just there for the food because the whole princess thing is so not me, but I thought it was fun nonetheless.

The promotional dinner included a whole list of appetizers and a huge fish bowl of this delicious drink for all ten of us to share. It wasn't a very potent drink but it was really good. I have to find out what they put in it and try to make my own version at home.

The appetizers we tried included some sushi rolls, meatball and Kobe sliders, salad, fries and a few other things. The food was not bad, it was just okay. My favorite were the Kobe sliders, cooked perfectly with a pink center topped with cheese and caramelized onion on a sweet roll.

The service was excellent, they did a great job of making us ladies feel special and we all received a rose at the end of our dinner. It was kind of like one big bachelorette party. The whole restaurant was filled with ladies all decked out in their clubbing attire. I guess they do this on Wednesday nights and they take the girls to Surrender nightclub for some after dinner drinking and dancing. I'm not sure how they make money from these things but hey, I get to enjoy it so I don't think about it too much. Maybe its because of the fact that guys will show up anywhere theres a lot of hot young women.

All in all, everybody had a wonderful time. The restaurant is very beautiful and elegant with a lot of Botero's artwork throughout. To be honest with you, I didn't know anything about the namesake of the restaurant until I Yelped about it. Turns out I took a picture in front of a Botero piece once before, at the FS Hotel in Miami. I thought the sculpture in the middle of this restaurant looked familiar.

3359440,2010-07-12,3,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"So...

I just got back from a weekend in Vegas, which finished off with Le Reve and dinner at Botero. My boyfriend and I were celebrating our one-year anniversary, which I had noted in the reservation, and I had originally wanted to go to Alex, which seems to be THE place at the Encore, but they were closed for two weeks for the yearly deep cleaning or something. Since we had show tickets right there in the Wynn I didn't want to have to try to fight the ridiculous Vegas foot traffic (or the HEAT!) so  Botero it was. Part of me wishes it wasn't...

AMBIENCE:
The restaurant is beautiful. See other reviews for descriptions, including the fat-woman theme which somehow works for them (I think all the art is by the artist the restaurant is named after). It's a very romantic place, but not necessarily spectacular.

SERVICE:
Our server was adequate and unobtrusive, but bland as can be. He blandly wished us a happy anniversary (maybe he was just really uncomfortable with the fact that it was two men *GASP!*), blandly told us about some options, and blandly went through all the motions of a fine-dining server. But the motions were there nonetheless, so gotta give him credit for that. Plus he did recommend a half-bottle of possibly the best Pinot Noir I've ever had (although he blandly described it too!). It was a 2006 Flying Goat Pinot and was so smooth and yummy. Along with dessert (see below) it probably saved the night. Worth the $50 for the half bottle.

There were maybe up to 5 people bringing food, wine, etc. during the meal, and all were very professional and prompt.

FOOD:
Ultimately food is the reason your at a friggin restaurant so it HAS to be amazing to earn 5 stars. But it got 3. Probably only 2 for the halibut, and 3.5 for the rack of lamb. I don't have enough money to eat fine dining very often, so when I do I expect it to be amazing, but I've had better lamb for $25 at Il Postino in San Diego and it's next door to me (seriously if you are ever in North Park TRY IT!!). The cut was excellent, and it was cooked very well but the flavors were just lacking. The fig goat cheese and eggplant lasagna that came with it sounded like it would be phenomenal--but it just wasn't. It was interesting and tasty but nothing I dreamed about later (hey, it's happened!).

The BF got halibut, which I wish I'd remembered what these reviews said about it because it really was NOT great at all. Edible at most. And the veggies that it came with were really garlicky (emphasis on the, um, icky).

We had the risotto-stuffed fried zuccini blossoms for an appetizer but they basically just tasted like fried batter with cream sauce. Blah.

I was planning to have steak but after two days in the sun and two nights of drinking it just wasn't appetizing. I know, I know, it's a steak restaurant and neither of us had STEAK, but it just wasn't the night.

We did eat enough to be get full but on a one-year anniversary you GOTTA have dessert! So we ordered the creme brulee. Best decision of the night. It has an amazing vanilla flavor with real vanilla beans in it and came with a mascarpone cream with fruit on the side. Both were so smooth and tasty and went really well with the wine that we'd managed to resist gulping down already. They also brought out a cute plate with 'Happy Anniversary' in chocolate sauce and two ice cream lollipops that were good. I had absolutely no room for one but somehow it still found a little cranny in my stomach... So the wine and dessert really saved an otherwise gastronomical disappointment. 

SHEESH! What a long review. We had a great time, which is hard not to do with such an amazing guy, but I really doubt we'll ever go back. Well maybe for dessert...",UH2C1mN3honHG-mamwVI7g,1,1,3,poPvhoC9KBF6VxowfntBww

for sides, the wild mushrooms were fine...and the mozzarella/whipped potato side is nothing to write home about.  don't get either...try some of the more adventurous sides (marrow, piquillo peppers).

It was the kind of first bite where you close your eyes and go straight to a food orgasm. We also split a bottle of red wine and had a post dinner dessert wine. I took a picture of the receipt because it was the most (and probably will remain the most) money I spent on a meal, around $550 once tip was included. To be fair, about $100-$150 of it was on a bottle of wine and the single dessert wines. You can look at their pricing online, so it won't be some huge surprise. 

If you're looking to splurge on an amazing steak, this is the place to go. We move around a lot due to my husband's job, so we've already agreed that Botero will be our last meal in Vegas when that time comes. Although, when you have one of the best meals ever, maybe it's best just to do a one and done.",zJM2JPFDafXxBRj90r1Klg,1,0,5,TPdGEPcNrwVoWKZO5T32dA

One BIG problem was, I order fish and they didn't debone it completely so a bone got stuck in my throat!!! I was NOT happy and the hostess, who seemed like a newbie didn't know quite what to do. But, our wonderful waiter was very concerned, took the fish back and the chef asked if I wanted something else. Since my throat was in some pain from the bone (the bone dislodged but it had scratched my throat) I declined another entree.So, the chef sent out different types of sorbets to numb and ease the pain, plus other desserts. My fab waiter took almost EVERYTHING off our bill. We got our 4 glasses of cocktails taken off, our bottle of wine, my entree and the 6 different desserts were free. All in all, bill should have been close to $300, but we only paid $100, for my husband's entree, 2 appetizers and tax. The food isn't the best but they have really good service and seem to genuinely care about their customers. We would definitely go back just for the service.

My parents retired to Henderson and were excited about treating us for thanksgiving. We travelled from Miami , San Francisco, and NJ.  For the 6 of us, the meal bill was $700.  We paid the wine separately.  The experience was not worth it.  It started with the inability to find our reservation, a dirty coffee cup, and debris floating in a water glass.  The waiter was not graceful.  The appetizers were good, but the turkey entree was dry and tasteless.  There was a small piece of white meat on top of shredded dark meat surrounded by dry stuffing and vegetables.  It needed to be smothered in gravy.  The apple dessert was delicious.  The pumpkin dessert was not.   
So as not to ruin the night, my parents expressed their disappointment to the general manager Chris Jurchenko the following week and were offered, if they pay $100 for 2 additional entrees, free appetizers, drinks, and dessert.  This was supposed to be a thankful occasion, but was far from it.  If Botero were not in the Wynn Hotel, it would not last.",LoCAOP8P9PSuDbCTntLpdA,3,1,1,9duL2twAlNK4OhXgGl-Caw
3562037,2009-03-02,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"We dined at Botero on January 26. I made reservations a few weeks before hand, shortly after I had booked Encore. I mentioned it was my friends birthday hoping they would do something and they did. 
We arrived at 7:30 and they were ready to seat us, but at a round larger table, there were 4 of us and I believe it was a 6 top. We opted to wait a few minutes and had drinks at the bar. The Lychee Martini was yummy to say the least. Friend had the Sangria which was great, her hubby had a Grape Crush thing that tasted just like grape soda, it was very good. Hubby had Knob Creek. I should mention that there was nothing wrong with the first table the hostess wanted to seat us at, we just wanted a smaller table which was available moments after we ordered our drinks. We went to the hostess stand when we were ready and she carried our drinks to the table for us. 
Service was very good throughout the meal. We started with two apps, the Crudo Tasting and the Gnochhi. Both were very good, the Gnocchi were probably the best I have ever tasted. Definately made in house and fluffy as can be. The sauce was perfect on them. I would go back and order just those. We split the large portion for Gnocchi between three of us, I could have eaten the whole thing myself but then there would be no room for steak.
For steaks, I had the petite filet, Linda had a ribeye, the guys both had the bone in strip. My steak was overcooked, I ordered it medium but felt it was closer to medium well. Hubby's steak was overcooked on half of it, the thickness was not the same throughout his and that is where the problem came in. Linda and her hubby's steaks were done perfectly. Which is where they loose a star, not getting our steaks right is a biggie in a steak restaurant. For sides we split the whipped potatoes and the potatoe gratin? I can't remember what the guys had. We could have ordered one more side but the two we had were fine. 
Dessert came they brought Linda a plate with Happy Birthday on it and I think they sang. I notice other plates going out like this that had mini cupcakes on it, so not sure if that is the norm or not, hers didn't but we ordered the mini cupcakes as a dessert so possibly they didn't put one her plate due to that. The cupcakes were great. 5 different flavors with a little tiny patty of ice cream on it. The strawberry was my favorite and I tried 3 of them!! 
I would go back to Botero but honestly it would be for the Gnocchi and cupcakes. I wouldn't need a steak if I ordered the large portion of the pasta. I still dream about it! Like I said service was fantastic, not intrusive but they were always there when you needed them. Water glasses were kept full and they seemed to know what you needed at all times. Very impressive. Everyone in the restaurant from the hostess to the bartender to the servers to the Managers were on top of things. I was very impressed considering they were only open a little over a month when we went. The timing between courses was absolutely perfect, the only time we had a problem was when we were missing the spoons for our sides which as soon as I looked around our waiter appeared with some!!  Our total Bill was $413 plus tip so $500 total for 4. That included the steaks, the sides, apps, atleast 6 drinks, and dessert. I realize we didn't order as much food as many do at steakhouses but we left very full and happy.",_XyQp6T_K07EQdRWMVMU_A,0,0,4,5I0hAED9XePFVmSzVth26Q

Other than that, nothing really stood out. Everything was good, but expensive (Vegas prices). Nothing really stood out, except the shrimp... And maybe the ambiance... The white, and loungey and artsy decor was different...

Solid is solid.  I'm not complaining. But it does take a something more than a properly cooked, well seasoned steak, accompanied by great service to stand out to me.",awQhT121Pe0R33sukfTyuA,0,0,3,GGrYBue2BgYEESTjCOruwQ

My honey brought me here for my birthday dinner. She chose Botero since they were the only restaurant in The Wynn, well Encore actually, that advertised a Vegan tasting menu. The elegant, yet hip vibe coming from the gorgeous, dimly lit interior didn't hurt the mood either. 

Everything here is so well thought out with a sense of purposeful intention. From the entance all the way to the bathroom, nothing has been forgotten. Yeah, I'll admit I may have snagged a few extra of those oh so plush napkins from the men's room. Who knows when I may be at home and the mood strikes to have that feeling of luxury while dropping a doozer. Who needs Charmin when you can have the elegance of Botero?

At $65 for a 5 course tasting menu, it wasn't too bad of a deal. Since we like trying new things together, we ordered the Curried Carrot Stuffed Squash and the Gardein Chicken entrees instead of getting another tasting menu of the same thing.

I don't think we've ever done a full on tasting menu. I was under the ASSumption that the portions for each course would be tiny. Boy, was certainly mistaken! The dishes that comprised the tasting menu could easily have fed us both. Add the squash and chicken, you can easily see how I ended up having to be rolled outta here.

The food was fantastic as I have come to expect from all of the fine restaurants in Uncle Steve's collection. I loved the stuffed squash, even though it was a relatively simple dish. Often times these restaunts fall back on using Gardein all too much. However, you can easily see why since their chefs are able to craft amazing food utilizing it.

One note, don't stuff yourself so silly that you don't have room for dessert. I wanted to order all of their tantalizing desserts, yet there was no more room as my dessert stomach was being overfilled from my main tank. Order everything if you must, just be prepared to take a doggie bag back to your hotel.

The Vegan menu must be quite popular as a gentleman to our left was enjoying his own tasting menu as well as half of the couple further over. Seems the word is out that The Wynn is the place to be in Vegas if you're Vegan and have a little bit (make that a lot!) of extra cash to spend.

The tasting menu will change seasonally yet one constant will remain. The excellent service. It's a bit off putting to me to be waited on hand and foot. Chair pulled out, napkin unfolded for me, silverware and plates constantly getting replaced, etc. However, you quickly get used to this life and never want to go back to casual dining again.",Y61y11_nYsbc2UWjDh8ZEA,10,10,5,EJhFzTqOiyt8GiCZ--_jzQ

Their menus is 2/3 what you'd expect to find at a steakhouse and 1/3 vegan.  Interesting dichotomy, and maybe a great compromise for couples split on where to go for dinner.

We went to Encore this weekend for my friend's 30th birthday party. They called the hotel and were told that Botero was the BEST restaurant at the hotel, so they booked us dinner there. We arrived at 8:15 for our 8:30 reservation and were told by the 4 hostesses that our table would not be ready until 8:30. As we looked around, there had to be 5 tables open that would have seated the 8 of us. At 8:30, they finally sat us at our table. We were put at the table and nobody came to greet us with menus for at least 5 minutes. Finally our waiter came to bring us a menu and ask for drink orders. We then waited at least 20 minutes for him to show up with drinks and offer us the specials. We finally placed our order and I could not wait to eat. I ordered the Short Rib with Potato puree. My husband ordered the Petite Fillet and Truffle Mac and Cheese. We also ordered the Botero Fries. I ordered a glass of wine with dinner. When dinner arrived 30 minutes later, the waiter never came back to check on us. I was waiting for someone to check on us and we were passed up by the manager at least 4 times and he ignored us and sped on by to the kitchen. Needless to say, my wine NEVER arrived. Finally we flagged down a manager who really did not seem very interested in getting me anything at all. We all were pretty much wanting to move on to XS at this point so we asked for the check. Did I tell you we TOLD them it was our friend's 30th Birthday? No birthday dessert. I saw many other tables get this mini ice cream cone desert, but apparently they forgot ours? I guess he was glad the 20% was added to our bill automatically or he probably would not have been given a tip. We will never return here.",ZGIrJdDIgIkBSCAEb6A0kQ,2,0,1,3pmtE86rfueB8hmt5MmsdA

the steak was absolutely juicy, tasty, tender & pure amazing. Had 3 different sauces to choose from, but the traditional is great! i liked it better than the chimichuri! 

the halibut was...alright. a bit bland and i got really sick of it. the scallop with tomato sauce wasn't too bad..nothing special in my opinion. the mash potatoes that came with it was yummy!!! the texture & flavor was just right for my taste buds!

Someone had recommended Botero because of the atomosphere and the quality steaks.  I decided to go on a whim and to my delight it was pretty good.  

Their decor is very cosmopolitan and it's poolside.  Great location for a great meeting, shower, or just plain old dinner.  Service is great and the staff will be more than happy to tell you what their favorites are on the menu.  

To start I ordered the Seafood Tower and for my main course I ordered the bone in Filet.  Now there's also a bone in Rib Eye but for 10 bucks more I wanted the melt in your mouth cut.  LOL.  It was perfectly carmelized on the outside seared to perfection.  I got it Chimmychurri style.  I HIGHLY recommend it.  The flavors were robust and not overwhelming either.  We paired it up with Truffle Mac and Cheese and also a side of their almond crusted asparagus.  Here's what I loved and didn't love about our meal.  

*The Seafood Tower was not impressive.  Considering I had great seafood towers at Maestro in Costa Mesa this one didn't compare.  

*Bone in Filet was ABSOLUTELY POSITIVELY DELISH.  As mentioned before perfectly marbeled and carmelized.  Lick your plate good!

*Truffle Mac and Cheese was great, it isn't the kraft mac and cheese creamy that I normally like but this gourmet mac and cheese is a must have if you love cheese!

*Almond crusted asparagus is not my favorite.  I rather had mine with plain olive oil with salt and pepper but if you like your asparagus deep fried go for it.  

*Banana Foster Creme Brule was good.  I think I like classic creme brule.  This one was good but again I'm a traditionalist when it comes to my creme brule.  

*Donut holes were awesome, I would highly recommend this with a side of ice cream.

Overall it was worth EVERY PENNY.  It's a tad on the expensive side but jus remember, their portions are large enough to share.  Their side dishes can definitely feed about 2-3 people easily.

Yes, I know, we're in Vegas, but c'mon! $50 for a petit filet that doesn't even come with a side? But it was delicious and they do have a really tasty bread basket while you wait. 

We made reservations but when we got there, they were running behind. No big deal, we sat at the bar to grab a drink. The drink menu's are really cool... tablets! So you can either scroll through the entire thing or search if you have a specific drink in mind. Pictures and a description are there for each drink.

Like I said before, the dining room is really nice. Tables have candles, the decor is absolutely stunning and the service is top notch. It does get loud, so know that before going, but we didn't mind. It was almost 10 o'clock on a Saturday night in Vegas, what do you expect?

Botero has a great elegant South American steakhouse feel to it.  The decor is very trendy (many Botero replica statues everywhere...thus the name.  If you don't know who Fernando Botero was, he was a Colombian sculptor who did those statues of fat women you have probably seen somewhere).  

Anyway, food, drinks, and service were just PHENOMENAL.  I can't say enough.

The design of the restaurant is very cool with copies of paintings and sculptures by Botero.  There is a massive Botero statue in the center of the restaurant.

When I first looked at the menu I was ecstatic to find that they served Fat Tire beer.  This shouldn't give Botero extra points since most places in Vegas have it, but since they do not distribute to Florida I was psyched to have an opportunity to have one, or four.

The meal was terrific.  We started with a delicious raw salmon and tuna platter. For dinner my dad and I shared a chateau briand steak.  It was one of the best, most flavorful steaks that I have ever tried.  Every bite was a treat.",T9o8bfbA7tzgm9lGFwSv3Q,1,1,5,h7WjVXUudoVqk3P8-mLBzg

The interior is very classy and glam, and their wait staff is amazing. We all had the filet mignon with various sides, and everyone's meat was cooked well. Note that if you ask for your steak to be cooked medium well, this restaurant in particular will butterfly your meat, so keep that in mind.

We informed the waitstaff beforehand that our dinner was for a bachelorette party, and when they brought out the dessert, they had presented it beautifully with candles (which we provided in advance) spelling out the bride-to-be's name. They were super accommodating about this.

I would warn that if you plan on going with a group that has the tendency to get a bit loud (and who wouldn't after a few drinks when you're in Vegas!?), you may want to take your party elsewhere. We unfortunately were told to keep our volume down because someone had complained, and that put a bit of a damper on our celebratory mood.

Botero creates a wonderful atmosphere.  We sat outside, with a beautiful view of the lush foliage and the pool.  There was beautiful lighting, and really just a sense of romanticism and relaxation.  

For those that could care less about the ambience and care more about the food....the food was amazing too!  I ordered the Halibut, and I have to say it was some of the best fish I've ever had in my life.  We also had the gnocchi appetizer, and that was great as well.  The caesar salad was good and the drinks are fabulous.  The food is phenomenal, plain and simple.  

Our service was such a breath of fresh air....after the disappointment with Switch it was just nice to have a server that cared to talk to his tables.  Our servers were fun, and kind, and did not rush us through the dinner.

There are way too many other places in Vegas to choose from.

 So much negative to say here:

We had reservations but they made us sit outside even though there were empty tables inside. Food was average to below average and we paid over $360 for it.

Best thing we had were the tater tots!

It was Thanksgiving so we had the traditional Turkey Dinner- big mistake!  turkey white meat was over cooked and dry, stuffing had too much of a sugary taste. The dark meat had been shredded (?) and so it dried out! I left all of it on the plate and ate the 300 dollar tater tots.

The tuna tartar was chewy and we sent that back. After that the female server hovered around us like she was shielding us from the other patrons/staff.
The busboy wanted to pull the plates quickly so no one could see that we had a problem with the food.

 Didn't even have drinks, we stuck with ice water.

The only reason we did not leave was another couple had invited us and this was their idea.

4012132,2013-11-07,14,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"This review was suppose to start out something like this...For the art aficionado you will appreciate the three original works of art from one of my favorite painters Fernando Botero, who also has a massive original sculpture in the center of this gorgeous restaurant located inside the Encore.  For the foodie aficionado you'll be pleased at the ""surf and turf"" offerings that the menu will delight and tempt you with.

But now, and forever I will have a ridiculous memory of my dinner at Botero. 

My client was in town for the big Air-Show and he invited me to dinner.  Since I work mainly on the phone, years passed since I'd seen him. In this case ten years went by, so this dinner was a big deal, especially since he's the CEO and made time for me in his busy schedule.  I was looking forward to hearing about his prestigious award that was presented to him by John Travolta!

I valet parked and greeted him at the entrance of the Wynn and we had settled on having cocktails in the lobby bar.  As I walk up to greet him my gorgeous leopard strappy shoe busts!  Seriously? Unbelievable! Talk about a deflating moment. Here I was only 30 seconds into welcoming him to Las Vegas and I already look like a clown.

So trying to not feel humiliated, I changed our plans and mentioned there was a bar at Botero and we should have drink there instead.  Well, talk about feeling like you were in a Laverne and Shirley episode.  Here I was all dressed up in a little black dress with high heels and this mile-long shoe strap dangling like a serpent off my foot as I walked through the gorgeous lobby!  It was worse since there were so many people and I could see women staring at my foot.  OMG please ground open up and swallow me now!  This is when I wish I would have bought those red soled shoes!  

So when we arrived at Botero there was a bar and a few cocktail tables.  And you know by this time I was ready for a double vodka martini.  We sat and waited and no service:( and no bartender to be seen:(   No bueno!  So again, I look like a fool assuming we would get bar service at the ""lounge"".  Botero, you let me down.

Our reservations were at 7 p.m. and we decided to grab the table early.  The hostess was very friendly and prior to getting seated I asked a waiter passing by if he had scissors. He quickly found some and I was able to snip of my dangling shoe strap. So that was a life saving moment.

Our waiter was fabulous.  Polite, friendly not overly stuffy.  I ordered a cocktail called the ""Dream"" which was ironic since I was actually in a nightmare. I'm not sure of the ingredients but I saw the pretty picture on the menu and pointed to it.  PIctures on menus are a good idea especially when you're head is in a spiral and you can't think or talk straight.  It had champagne and a hibiscus flower and it was just what I needed (in addition to a double of something really strong).

Next came out a tower of breads...wonderful!  I'm sure they were but I needed to cut back on carbs remember I just busted out of a shoe.  The squash soup was very good but presentation-wise fell a bit short. A dollop of cream and some chives or pomagranite seeds, or pumpkin seeds, shredded apple...some garnish would have been a nice touch.

I ordered the salmon and asked for it to be a bit well done-the waiter did warn me that it can come out looking a bit undercooked so I ordered it probably too overly done and it was a bit dry but the rest of the vegetables that were served with it were heavenly.

The beautiful restaurant was buzzing with lots of the conference attendees.  One of which who happened to be my client's customer none other than Eugene Cernan-Yes, the famous astronaut who was the last man to walk on the moon!  I was very excited to meet him and after my disastrous evening it came to a delightful ending.

I would love to come back and appreciate the paintings and more offerings. The menu looked incredible with so many choices.  I just wish the service at the bar was in existance because I really needed that Tini!",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,15,17,4,2qHcfDhDO1rdmikDwURZiA
4027667,2009-10-08,3,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"I went here with four of my groomsmen for a little bachelor party dinner and was one of the highlights of the weekend... I'm not going to yelp about the other highlights, so I'll concentrate on Botero. 

We made late reservations for 9pm (I suggest you make reservations well before you arrive to Vegas) and got seated after ten minutes or so. The decor was nice and everyone around seemed to be pretty baller. We sat next to the huge Buddha with a view of the pool and young ladies with older men. 

I shared the Chateaubriand for two with my friend (for $110) and he got an extra Maine lobster tail
My other friend got the Petit Filet for $44
My two other friends got the Japanese Kobe 7oz for $175 each. My jaw dropped when I heard them order, but I'll get to that later.
We also ordered some foie gras, whipped potatoes and wild mushrooms.

My Chateaubriand was huge and even though it was for two, we couldn't completely finish it. The wine reduction gave it some excellent flavor as well.

My friends who got the Japanese Kobe also ordered lobster tails and they wanted me to try it out (since I probably would never order a $175 steak). I did and it was the best I've put in my mouth (fighting. urge. to. say. ""that's. what. she....."") okay. best thing ever. You could see all the marbling, it melted in your mouth and there was a party in my mouth of tastes. The only thing was it was a bit too salty and both of them got tired of it before they finished (and it's only 7oz). Those two bites were good enough for me though - it's nice to just know what real Japanese Kobe tastes like (those kobe burgers or sliders or whatever they have at chain restaurants? yeah, no....not even close to being in the same family as this steak). 

Since we had a late dinner, we finished at almost 11pm and we had a good view of the club XS. We walked on by because bottle service there is even more ridiculous than the price of Japanese Kobe. All in all a great experience - just four stars because of the ridiculous price, but what do you expect from Vegas?",L7QmuervWX8nYzFYbZsD-A,5,3,4,V-gOU7hHtlxMUQxFrUgxPQ

The giant sculpture in the center kind of made me feel glutinous and I actually did not order an appetizer or dessert because it made me feel bad.

4129531,2008-12-30,18,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Ah, Vegas. The life of excess. And, holy shit, did Encore do it right. Everything about this casino is amazing, from the smell pumped in through the vents, even to the cocktail napkins - which are by far the best cocktail napkins I've ever seen at a casino. That's why it's so fitting that their steakhouse is named after Botero, an artist whose signature is very, very rotund people in his paintings and sculptures.

Yes - I gave the shrimp cocktail place in Vegas five stars, I even gave the OC Fair five stars. So why only four at Botero? Well, because I also gave five stars to Del Frisco's in Vegas, and the steak and experience here just didn't match it.

I must say though, the decor of the restaurant is pretty damn cool though. With all the tables set up around one of Botero's largest sculptures or one of the largest ladies. We ended up seated right next to her ass, which made me feel better about myself with every bite of my calorie overloaded steak. Even the silverware is custom made to have that plump, Botero-esque feel.

Now, let's get down to the food and drinks. I had the ribeye with chimichurri on it, which was...pretty good. But you know what, I really should have gone without the chimichurri it didn't add anything good to the steak. What was absolutely delicious though was the mac n' cheese. I'm going to go out on a limb and say this was the absolute best mac n' cheese I've ever had in my life. I doubt this is the sort of establishment where you could just go in and order the mac n' cheese, but if you could....this would be on my list of stops in Vegas every time.

The desserts all seemed to focus on presentation more than taste. But it's actually kind of fun eating a bon bon lollipop after a schmancy dinner. (Just don't remind yourself that you paid $22 for a few bon bons.)

Worth the $300 pricetag for a dinner for two? Sure, you're in Vegas. You're damn right it's worth it.

Thumbs Up:
-Fab art from Botero as far as the eye can see.
-Your self esteem will skyrocket if you're seated next to the fat lady sculpture.
-Mac N' Cheese. Holy mother of god. Amazing.
-Of course, amazing service. You're at a Wynn property. Duh.

Thumbs Down:
-You know, it's really not bad, just as far as Vegas steakhouses go - it's not as good as Del Frisco's.",1vXJWH7L0IMEz5-8aU3SOA,20,17,4,bQpvjIl8Q22NAD_Jm43Xvg

This place is all about presentation which made for a great experience!

We had reservations and were quickly seated, the sommelier immediately came up to our table and recommended 2 fabulous bottles of wine.  Our waiter, Anthony, had a great personality and made the entire experience fun, not stuffy.  We ordered a half dozen apps which were all fantastic - my favorite was the Hamatchi Tartar, which featured cooked rice cake with the small service tool baked into it.  We also had the potato gnocchi (ok) and the kobe steak tartar (I can die happy!).   Everyone ordered steak as their entrees and were incredibly happy with them... but.... I had to be a girl and order fish.  At a steakhouse.  Results?  A bit disappointing.  I ordered the Sea Bass and hardly ate any of it.  It wasn't very exciting and just tasted heavy.  Lots of sauce and potatoes.  For sides we had the truffle mac & cheese (the truffle flavor was a bit overwhelming for me), broccoli, potato gratin, and roasted bone marrow.  

Desert had the dishes with the most whimsy (yes, we ordered desert...by the time we left we felt like the subject of a Botero painting)  We ordered the cupcakes and ice cream sandwiches.

4201905,2015-06-17,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Botero never disappoints!  Using elements of the artist, Botero, to decorate the restaurant, the ambiance is elegant and classy.  The staff becomes an extension of this feeling with their pleasant and welcoming attitude.  Then comes the food!

For starters, I always go with the Australian Waygu Beef Steak Tartare!  It's a MUST!  It's four jalapeno hollandaise crostini with a decent sized portion of steak tartare with Parmesan.  One crostini is good for one person to eat for an appetizer, but you'll want it all to yourself!  Another great starter dish is the Hudson Valley Foie Gras!  It's the perfect blend of savory and sweet served with a blueberry waffle with lemon butter!  This is definitely a shareable portion. So no matter what you decided to order for the rest of your meal, rest assure those are key starters you won't want to miss out on.

For my main course, I have gotten many different things in the past that are delicious, but on this last trip, I got a dish that definitely deserves recognition.  I ordered the special, which was a 16 oz. Gold Grade NY Strip from Snake River Farms!  Extremely tender and FULL of flavor!  The marbling of this steak kept it so juicy and it was cooked to perfection.  Mouthwatering!  I usually like my steaks prepared there Chimichurri style, but with this steak I had it prepared simply grilled with sea salt and cracked pepper.  I got the Chimichurri on the side, just in case, and I didn't need it at all. 

As for my sides, like we typically do, we all ordered a few sides that peeks our interest to share with the table.  My personal favorites are the Tater Tots with Aged Cheddar in the middle and the Truffle Mac and Cheese!!!

To finish, we were comped desserts and were served about 5 different desserts, which we ALL amazing.  I loved the mixed basket of Beignets and Cronuts.  WOW were those amazing!

All in all, you can't go wrong here.  Between the staff, the ambiance, and the food, it's no wonder it's hard to get a reservation here on busy weekends. Book your reservation early!",lBqik5Ao9-feMJMnZRA6Nw,1,1,5,MBGMOkjnRXE6Pqbn8JG5jA

I cannot stress enough how good this restaurant is, and despite the high price point (expect to pay atleast 100 / person leaving, with no drinks!) it is sooo worth it.  The best value and taste are the scallops.  I swear these scallops were the size of my fist (though i have small hands), and the broth was amazing!!  The extras that go with the dishes are quite delectable as well.  My crave-worthy must try recommendations: The polenta cake and mushroom, truffle macaroni and cheese (though i couldn't have more than a bite due to my dairy allergies), the Bone Marrow and the french fries.  Although it's a steakhouse, this restaurant packs so many tasty goodies, in fact I think it's the one restaurant I would fly back to Vegas just to eat at.

Recommendations (See photos):

BONE-IN RIB EYE = PERFECTION!  
The crisp surface and marbled fattiness of this meat was EXQUISITE.  It melts in your mouth and reminded me of the Kobe beef I had in Kobe, Japan.  The size of this slab of meat is humongous considering I don't eat a lot in one sitting.  This is definitely a plate to share to get a taste of perfection.

CRUDO TASTING
If you like sashimi, you'll enjoy this 9-piece appetizer.  Expect 3 slices of tuna, and 2 slices of all the other varieties each garnished with sauces.

DUNGENESS CRAB AGNOLOTTI
If you love crab, order it!  There are two crab cakes in this appetizer.

Now on to recommendations for sides (LARGE portions to share):

TRUFFLE MACARONI & CHEESE
Although I'm not big on cheese, everyone else in our party loved this side.

WILD MUSHROOMS
LOVED these wild mushrooms!  I could eat this as an entree for myself.

DUNGENESS CRAB GARLIC KNOTS
Again, if you love crab and garlic, order it!  They looked more like ravioli to me.

BOTERO, I LOVE YOU.  Given the quality of food, your prices are reasonable.  I love the way you make me feel with the ambiance and views of this restaurant.  I'll be back again!",aB1L8HsC0KNeAVNF8DVGwg,1,2,5,_OrhLx0Ly_VI8THzHRxPtQ
4231991,2010-06-07,2,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"So for our bachelor party trip we had done everything except for a nice dinner together.  Since we had fallen in love with everything ENCORE.  We decided to eat at the nice restaurant inside of this hotel. 

We were gambling at the tables and the pit boss was able to call in our reservation for a group of 14 with a table on the patio.  Great service to start!

When we arrived, we were greeted by the hostess, which was probably the hottest girl we met on the whole trip.  Our table was laid out perfectly with a nice view of the pool that is part of club XS.

The pool had some nice eye candy to watch during dinner.  As we were dining, they were wrapping up the pool and setting up for the club, it was cool seeing what all went into setting up the club we were just at the night before. 

On to the food.  I started out with the soup sampler.  It came with 2 soups, one was some artichoke soup which was average and the other was a mushroom soup which was amazing.

On to the steak.  I had the ribeye under the recommendation of the server.  I had it served ""pepper steak"" style which came with 3 dipping sauces.  My steak was a bit overcooked.  I ordered medium and it was more medium well, others who ordered medium rare it came medium, so I would recommend just under ordering your steak.  Out of the three sauces the brown sauce was the best. 

We had a bunch of people so we had a wide variety of sides.  My favorite was the creamed spinach with fried egg.  The mac and cheese was hyped but did not live up to it.  I only got to try one spear of the fried aspargus and it was after it had cooled down but that was still excellent.  My friend didn't finish his filet so I had a few bites out of that.  The filet was much better than the prime rib.

Overall, this place was elegant and the food was good.  Honestly, if you pick the right things this place could be a 5 star joint.  I just did not like the recommendations by the waiter. 

So here goes my recommendations:
Get the filet, order it 1 level less cooked than you actually want it, get it pepper steak style, get the creamed spinach, and sit on the patio by the pool.",CQUDh80m48xnzUkx-X5NAw,4,2,4,tplMZxYtZpdu1X2xC9hiPQ

I am a Botero fan, having been to his museum in Bogata and really appreciating his take on human size.

We shared one appetizer, one salad,one entree and two sides. 

The stuffed calamari, which was poached (I think), and was tasty and well done.  The salad was probably the freshest I have had,.the wedges were super crispy, and the blue cheese and pork belly were a great addition.

The new York strip was huge, and perfectly cooked.
The Mac and cheese and broccoli sides were ok, nothing fabulous.

The bread was unique, with a basket of cranberry bread, pretzles and mini baguettes.

The Sangria drink we started with was great. They have a great Vegan menu, so we've tried the Vegan mushroom starter which was excellent and so did the sides we ordered as starters: the truffle mac and cheese, the pistachio asparagus and the broccolini. 

My husband got a steak (ordered Medium-Well and got his pretty well done, which would be my only criticism). My dish was the Vegan tofu which was great too. 

And then! Like all of this wasn't enough! We got the popcorn custard dessert... YUM!

The inside is trendy and there are obviously a number of artworks by Botero. The reception desk was less then welcoming and friendly but that was the only hitch. Once seated (we opted for the outside as the temperature was perfect). From that point on the service was impeccable. A visit from the sommelier proved helpful. They have a very large and nicely chosen wine list with a couple of hidden gems in the more modest price ranges (sub $120). Thank you. 

We tried the Iberian pork appetizer which was amazing. Served with cold asparagus, toast, grilled red peppers and a cheese flan. A wonderful item to share. For dinner I chose the crusted fish with truffle dumplings and white asparagus. This was nicely executed and tasted great...but didn't wow me. My dining cohort, on the other hand, had a foodgasam with her choice of lamb chops. I managed to get a taste and can vouch that this was a strong choice. Also, need to mention the breadbasket...very nice assortment of breads and they were prepared with love. Definitely not an afterthought.

Only thing I found a bit odd was their music choice..I believe it was European club techno pop or if that's not a real category you get the idea. Seems like a demographic mismatch from who their clientele appeared to be.

We had reservations at 8:30 but we weren't seated till after 9. We never saw our server between taking our order and dropping the check. Also,  you think they'd get the positions right when placing the entrees. And lastly it would be nice if they'd tell you what the different appetizers or entrees are with a little explanation.

Seriously, Encore and Wynn host the BEST restaurants in all of Sin City, and as I have eaten at all of them, I can honestly say Botero stands alone.

The ambience is beautiful, and gives a great vibe to the space, lighting is superb, and allows an intimate feeling in a room where there are plenty of things to feast your gaze upon.

However once your food arrives, good luck looking up from the table.  Steak was prepared to perfection... sides were delectable, and desserts were both original and delicious, giving you a sample of something a little different than what you come to expect from the Vegas steakhouse.

You can tell chef Mark LoRusso has the ability to balance standard favorites with new age flare to create a memorable meal.

4386923,2011-04-15,2,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Soo, hello again.  As you may recognize from previous reviews, I like to Vegas... a lot.  Vegas may be a borderline addiction for me ( I do go through Vegas withdrawals).  So on many visits to Vegas, I do go to XS at Encore to club and what not, and while in line, I always see Botero.  I was always curious and asked around and only one person I knew had eaten there and really recommended it (picky ass foodie/cook cousin of mine).

So, after many many visits, I happened to be in Vegas with my little brother celebrating a birthday at the same time my parents decided to go to a convention and they wanted to meet up for one meal when we were sober (which didn't really happen much that trip).  They asked me, who is the semi-resident, for a spot and I suggested Botero since they offered to pay.  So, with a reservation in hand, we went.

So the ambiance of Botero is very anti-Vegas because it is subdued, quiet and very tranquil.  The hosts and waiters are awesome and attentive, and it is a very relaxing atmosphere to unwind and breathe.

Okay.. so on to the food!  When I eat with my family, we all order what we want but end up eating family style so everyone gets a bite.  What we ordered: Broccoli cheddar soup, onion portobello soup, ricotta ravioli, chateaubriand, arctic char, truffle mac n' cheese, roasted bone marrow, S'mores brioche donuts, and the frozen chocolate candy bar.

I can not begin to rant and rave about this place.  Everything we tasted was amazing.  The soups were both savory and delicious.  The ricotta ravioli was melt in your mouth good.  The chateaubriand was medium rare perfection.  The desserts.... oh my god the desserts were rich, dense, amazing and orgasmic.  Lastly, were the sides.  The truffle mac n' cheese disappeared... FAST.  We could not get enough of it.  

And my personal favorite dish of the night was the bone marrow with onion jam.  This is not for the faint of heart (or those with high blood pressure).  The bone marrow was melt-in-your-mouth texture with rich, beefy flavor.  Combined with the onion jam and the toast points.. DROOLLLL.  An amazing ethereal experience.

The cocktail menu is on a tablet, and it seems that you can order drinks from there..HOWEVER, the waiter who took our order says the ipads do not transmit orders....then why have that option showing? It's just confusing the customer.

Anyway, a friend and I shared the Porterhouse for 2 with the pepper-style sauce/topping on the side. The porterhouse was cooked a beautiful medium rare. The only gripe is that the portion of strip to filet mignon wasn't as great as I expected...only had like 3 uneven cuts of filet mignon...However the steak was cooked beautifully and it tasted great. The sauces were not necessary.

We ordered wine all night and ran up a huge bill, including a steak for two (as I remember, it was the special, some sort of a bone in ribeye with special seasoning and crab? -- this was a year ago) that I shared with my friend.  First of all, the food took forever to come out.  Like over an hour, during which time we could have been at the club.  Got there about 8, ate around 10.  When it did come out, the steak was well done (ordered medium rare).  The thing was like 120 bucks.  It tasted like something you could cook in your oven for 15 bucks from Ralph's.  Just awful.  Sending the thing back was not an option because the group was going to the club and was already into their meals.  We ate a few bites, and asked them to comp it.  The waiter said they would.  Check comes out (keep in mind this check was well over 1000 dollars) and they didn't comp.  Complained to the manager, he said that they wouldn't comp it but that they could make another one (once the whole group was done eating and it was obvious this wasn't an option for us).  Flat out refused to comp or even discount the steak, and didn't provide free desert, or anything else.  Worse, when the first manager was explaining the situation, another douchebag came out and started yelling ""what's the problem here"" embarrasing us in front of the entire group. Obviously this place thrives on one time visitors - tourists - and doesn't care if you come back or not.  Total scam - stay far away from this place.",qsMpT4rxOWoCI1dSbtS9WA,0,0,1,Yz12GHRlIssqaaqd1t6eXA

4651026,2009-06-17,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"A friend and I hit Botero on a Friday night in May and found it to be quite solid overall, with some outstanding elements. The bar up front is great fun and the staff seems to enjoy coming up with customized cocktails. Tell them what you like and they'll create something for you. [Mine turned out to be a Martini with pear vodka and elderflower liqueur, which was terrific.] The room is basically circular with a tremendous black Botero statue at the center, counterpointed by lighter-color floors and furniture. It overlooks the European pool and has outdoor seating. It was slam-full the night we were there and quite loud, so just know before you go that this is a high-energy night out, not a quiet, relaxing dinner. 

The food was the strongest element for us. Each dish we had was sensational, with the appetizers being creative, tasty, and served in pretty substantial portions. The duo of crab and the salmon with Meyer lemon [!] were standouts. The bone-in New York Strip was really something special--juicy and flavorful but with an absolute minimum of fat. It was a nice thick cut and perfectly, simply seasoned plus cooked exactly to order. It's hard for me to imagine a steak ever being actually worth $52, but this one came as close as anything. The sides seem to be sort of the trademark of the restaurant. They came in little skillets and were big enough to share. We had the creamed spinach, grilled asparagus, and truffled corn pudding. All were sensational, but I'm still dreaming about that truffled corn pudding. The desserts weren't quite up to the standard of the first two courses for me--they're more whimsical than anything. Things like childhood-flavors cupcakes and a sort of be-your-own-Coldstone-Creamery where they bring a scoop of ice cream on a palette with various mix-ins along the edge. If you're looking for more traditional desserts, you won't find them here. 

As I wrote earlier, it was absolutely packed. That did not affect the quality of the food at all, but the service was a touch slow. Courses came out of the kitchen quickly once ordered, but there was a bit of a delay to place the order, to get the dessert menus, and to get the check at the end.

We sampled most every restaurant at the Encore [except Switch] during our stay and this was the overall favorite. It's certainly not cheap, but nothing at Encore is. It's also a distinctive-enough experience to be memorable. If you're wanting a more low-key bar stop and dinner, you might try Sinatra.",G87zEbu0oPpYzmn4LUMC3g,0,0,4,3NzCPOrpPzXpt7HucDoQNQ

It wasn't mind blowing, but it wasn't disappointing either. The grilled octopus was fantastic. This was my first time having octopus, and it was pretty damn tasty. It was rich and had a full flavor. For the steak, we had the bone-in ribeye. Now, comparing it to Delmonico, I think Delmonico had the better steak, but to take anything away from Botero's steak would be wrong.

I was disappointed that we did not get to sit outside for our dinner.  the hostess said they ""are not opening the patio tonight"".  I wish i had known that in advance so I could have made other arrangements for a different restaurant.  I had made our outdoor reservations a month in advance.  Sitting outside meant everything to the ambiance of our evening event and although I tried, the hostess wasn't budging.  

However, they made up for it by giving us VIP seating.  Our table is where Steve Wynn sits every other week.  It is his table which made us feel special.  Of course we told the server, if Mr. Wynn should come in to have him sit with us and we would treat him to a wonderful meal.  =)

The food of course was magnificent.  Steaks tender and family style sides complement the meal very well.  I would expect no less than a fabulous place from the Encore.  The cocktails were so-so, but they did not have B&B.  The staff actually went out to get B&B for one of the members in our party.  now THAT is good customer service.

My baby sister had the pleasure of enjoying a dinner here the week before I went. She couldn't stop raving about it so I decided to have my birthday dinner here with my 2 best girlfriends before dancing off the calories at XS! (Right next door, btw)

Ambience: Interesting & unique! At the bar, there is a shelf full of bottles on the ceiling & a swanky bar top.  My Jameson & Ginger went down particularly smoothly! While we were getting escorted to our table, a statue of a voluptuous lady rested in the middle of the restaurant. The lighting is dim and the tables are generously spread apart for an intimate meal with your date or guests.

Meal: To start off our dinner, we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare for the table. It was surprisingly good. Then we all shared a bowl of Truffle Macaroni & Cheese. Personally, it was probably the best Mac&Cheese I've ever had. (My guilty pleasure) And for our entree, we all got the Petite Filets. My girlfriends really like it, but I wasn't too impressed. I asked for medium rare, but it was closer to medium.. medium well. So it was a little dry for my taste. It was good but maybe I should've gone in with less of an expectation! I asked for steak sauce and they brought over an array of them. It definitely helped!

Service: This is where Botero lost a star! I wish our server was more attentive. We even had to flag her down to order. (Our menus were closed and sitting in front of us for quite some time) We had more interaction and assistance from the food runners and bussers. Maybe our server was a little shy and soft spoken by nature? I understand she had other tables too, but I expected a little more from a fabulous restaurant like Botero. But all in all, she was very nice and pretty. (:

I ordered mine medium rare along with the Pepper dipping sauces. 

The steak was a total disappointment:

It wasn't seasoned...

It wasn't cooked properly (not charred and dry on the inside)...

It wasn't Prime as advertised (grizzly and dry)...

It looked/tasted like they had cooked it on a flat top that wasn't really hot without any salt and pepper!

With the exception of the jalapeno aioli,  the Pepper sauces weren't memorable either.

Finally, i ordered the $12 side of Brussel Sprouts and it too disappointed. Based on the description ((Brussels Sprouts charred jalapenos, crispy pork belly), one would expect something spicy, seasoned, and varying texture. It was none of the above. It basically tasted like sauteed Brussels Sprouts without any seasoning.

I gave it two stars because the service was very good and my guests seemed to like their filets and mashed potatoes. For $600 (party of 4), I expect better,

I'll keep it simple as its be reviewed a bunch so lets deal with the nuts and bolts.

Wine List So over priced you can't even begin to or no where to start. Only 1 cabernet on the menu by the glass $25.00 and it was Ahh nothing to write home about. Had a bottle that is about $20.00 retail marked up to 92.00 but better than 25. 00 per glass

3 Appetizers. Fried shrimp quite good best of the bunc Also Mushroom tart that was pure garbage - and a ricotta mini ravioli with farva beans and mushrooms. Sauce was non descript and absolutely nothing special about it.

3 People with 1 bottle of wine and two drinks 3 appetizers and 3 steaks with tax and Tip $456.00 WASTE OF $$$$$$

Steaks
1 bone in Filet 
1 Bone in Rib Eye
1 NY Strip
Strip was best of the bunch but all mean was certainly not tender and the filet ordered Med  / Well came out bleeding and had to be sent back.  1 Order of scallop potoates $11.00 bland and added nothing to the mix.

Bottom line OK but certainly NOTHING to write home about and at these prices I was very much disappointed as I had heard so much about this place. really disappointing and much better places to choose to eat in Vegas than this overpriced production.",ic3Lw9nuyESd5wFRH7TFpw,0,0,2,2AiPHh6-U64LMOOy0vwBlg

Today was my 3rd time eating there so here are a few highlights that are must haves:

Appetizers:
~Short Rib Ravioli- My oh my so rich and flavorful where you don't want to share. Drool worthy but be aware that there is only 3 pieces 
~ Crudo tasting- if you love sashimi and or raw fish prepared different ways then this is amazing. Loved experiencing the different preparations 
~Ahi tuna tartare- I could eat a whole vat of this if I could. Fresh fish + mango+ avocado= heaven in my mouth.  

Entree: 
~Can go wrong with any steak here but they prepare it 3 different ways. I recommended the pepper ways first cause it also has a variety of sauces and then  chimichurri second. 
~Short rib- fall off the bone kind of meat sitting on a bed of amazing potato purée with the oh so delightful red wine sauce. 

Sides:
~Tater Tots- no seriously....they are a whole new level of tater tots. (Cheese in the middle- you're welcome) 

I honestly could go on and on about this place. Modern decor and received its name because it showcases work from artist, Fernando Botero. Overlooks poolside view and if you want to go clubbing afterwards it is next to the popular club, XS. 

Highly recommend if you're looking for good food and good vibes. The service was impeccable and staff was extremely friendly. You will definitely spend a little because it's is fine dining but you will enjoy the experience.",QPbXBYWCSmw6-NhVWteaWA,4,5,5,NNBPAAgh0rAsSBFULZCadg

Veal chop is an excellent perfectly cooked dish.  The side of bone marrow is generously proportioned and extremely decadent.
The crispy skin Tai snapper was overcooked (hence the 4 star rating) but the sauce was tasty.

Botero has a very nice setting and it was nice because it was one of the only ""nice"" restaurant/steak place that could accommodate party of 6. We made reservations online and did not have to wait that long for a table.  Prices are just like any other steakhouse. I shared the bone in ribeye with my boyfriend. That was enough for both of us. we did share sides too witht he rest of the table. We tried the truffle mac and cheese,whipped potatoes, Botero fries, and the bone marrow. We ate the bone marrow with our ribeye and it definitely did enhance the flavor. THe whipped potatoes were excellent as well.  

An excellent bonus we got...while we were waiting for our food, the Wynn's resident magician Shimshi actually showed up and performed his magic tricks for us.  It was truly a great experience, especially since we were celebrating a friend's birthday.

While it is a bit awkwardly located in a walkway connecting the Encore shops next to XS to the Wynn, once you enter through their revolving doors you are immediately immersed in a classy space with beautiful artwork surrounding you.

Seated immediately upon arriving for our reservation. Our server was thoughtful enough to ask if we had any time constraints- which we did, 9:30pm Le Reve show tickets- he planned our course presentation accordingly.

It was just the 2 of us. And our eyes were bigger than our stomachs. We ordered 4 apps: the beet salad, crab agnolotti, mushroom tart, a 3 soup tasting. And a shared entree: the short ribs with an added brussel sprout & pork belly side.

The beet salad was tasty, but something easily duplicated at home. The Crab Agnolotti (i.e. ravioli), however, we both agreed, was excellent- an app that is worth considering ordering as an entree. I could eat those little bad boys all night long. The mushroom tart was just OK, not something I would ever crave again. I didn't try the soup tasting as I was getting full & the entree hadn't event come out yet (DAMN BREAD!!!). The short ribs were good, but unremarkable. The combo of brussel sprouts and crispy pork-belly was unique & delicious and likely something I would return & have again.

I ordered a Bone-In ribeye medium rare, when it came out it was wayyyy too rare (less than 1 mm from the outside of the steak turned blood red), when I asked them to cook it for a little longer it took them 15 minutes for them to bring it back to me. We also had a friend that ordered a petite filet, it had a side of keish which when we looked at it had a bug larger than a lady bug on it (I dont know what kind of bug it was), the wawitress took it away and proceeded to get the manager, he toldd her ""there was some lettuce there that wasn't washed properly"", I smell BS. He then told her that they would correct the ordeal yet when we received the bill, they ONLY took off 50% of her portion of the bill which her part of the bill then came out to $58 (an average amount a person pays here is between $80-110 per person if you purchase an appetizer, salad, and main course).

The sides: tater tots, Mac and cheese, sprouts, all top notch.

As for the steak, for the price you pay, it's mediocre in terms of tenderness!  Although the porterhouse was cooked to perfection, it still lacked a bit of flavor and sophistication for a $130 piece of meat.  Each bite would start in a magical place, then turn dry and chewy as you prepare to swallow.  Very strange actually, even the fattier parts were no match for the Vegas desert!

Sure the dishes looked stunning and totally appetizing, but as all things in Vegas, looks can be deceiving. It was probably the worst steak dining experience I'd had in awhile. The crudo sampler was not fresh, and instead had an unpleasant fishiness. The creamed spinach was overpoweringly creamy. The scallops and prime ribeye tasted like something that was cooked at home by amateurs. It was the first time I took two bites of a huge steak and left the rest for the dogs. 

The only reason I'm giving them two stars instead of one is the impeccable service. This experience could have been so much worse if it wasn't for the helpful and apologetic staff. Professionalism definitely goes a long way, and I am very appreciative.

With that said, I hope that Botero will step up their game. They're located inside a five-star resort and the quality needs to match the hotel's. Very disappointing.",F2xMRSyGEjW6U_Ks66gwEg,2,0,2,soov0JPic4PvOTt4OZY2cg

Appetizers:
*Kobe tartare - I've eaten too much damn kobe tartare in this city so I'm jaded. It was good, but not exciting.
*Lobster ravioli (a special that day) - best lobster ravioli I've ever had the pleasure of trying. HUGE chunks of lobster claw meat in side. No minced ground up garbage. 
*Foie gras - it's no secret I'm a foie gras freak, and this didn't disappoint. A nice sized portion and perfectly prepared. 

Main:
*Filet (12 ounce to share), chimichurri style, Maine lobster and King crab added on - The steak was great, I really enjoyed the chimichurri rub ! I've had a lot of great steaks here in Vegas so I wouldn't say this is ""best steak of my life"" material, but it certainly didn't disappoint. Cut and Carnevino are both better from a meat perspective, but I still enjoyed the steak here very much. The lobster add on was just so-so, but the king crab was fabulous!!

Desserts: 
*Chocolate souflee - delicious, but nothing special or unique
*Bananas Foster creme brulee - freaking awesome!!! 
*Mini cupcakes with ice cream - so freaking cute and came in 5 flavors (Red velvet, birthday cake, lemon, carrot, and german chocolate). delicious and really fun. 
*Smores donuts - definitely the highlight! Don't eat here and not get these. A homemade donut, coated in graham cracker with gooey marshmallow inside with dark chocolate dipping sauce. YUM

1st course:
Baby Beet Salad (my favorite of this lot, very close to the Crudo tasting...I love goat cheese and it complemented the beets really well)
Crudo Tasting (the fish was fresh and had tasty sauces that went well with each type)
Ahi Tuna Tartare 
Dungeness Crab Agnolotti (this was interesting, the ravioli-like pasta was filled with crab! not skimpy at all)

Main course:
Bone-in Ribeye with Chimichurri rub (very tender steak, I loved how they cut it all up for us to share)
Olive Oil Poached Atlantic Cod (this is prob the freshest cooked fish I've had in a very long time...was overly impressed at how it was de-boned and had a light texture that went well with everything else on the plate)
Dayboat Scallops (This was my friend's favorite who's a pescatarian, the mushrooms & tortellini really went well with the scallops; very nice presentation)

Sides: 
Truffle mac n' cheese - my favorite out of the sides...I just love the truffle oil and this was well done!
Manchego stuffed piquillo peppers
Carmelized brussel sprouts

Botero Ice Cream Cupcakes - really interesting and very cute...

I had incredibly moist roast chicken and I loved the broccolini side.  The Botero fries I found just OK, but I am not much of a fry girl so take that with a grain of salt.  For dessert, they brought out a beautifully plated dessert buffet with a huge assortment of ice cream pops, cake pops, coconut marshmallows, and churros.  They also took the time to write a congratulatory message to the bride-to-be on the plate in chocolate script, none of which I had expected and all of which I got mad props for as the organiser!! :)  Thanks Botero for making this bachelorette night out memorable and making me look like a top notch bridesmaid/party planner!",Q-KLPqHFsYhiG5SWkRVC4w,0,0,5,QWfzOgmPN7RfmVNwRaje3w

Food wise we ordered for appetizers the crab ravioli, the octopus, broccolini, tater tots and the tuna tartar. We thought all of it was delicious (even the tots). For dinner my husband had the Halibut and I had the Waygu Short Rib. Both were very flavorful and filling. This place also has a vegan menu that sounds incredible too.

We got a bunch of sides including the tater tots and the creme brûlée corn which was my favorite part of the entire meal. 

My lamb came out extremely under seasoned and bland. I asked for sauces but it just didn't do justice when the lamb had no flavor marinating into it.

Appetizers:  mushroom pastry and the buffalo mozzarella w/ sundried tomatoes.  Both were excellent and very flavorful.  I can still taste those tomatoes.

Sides:  We all thought the sides were pretty damn creative here.  The creamed spinach w/ a deep fried, breaded poached egg in the middle is pure genius!!  Watch out for yolk splatter when the server breaks it :P  

French onion potato gratin was really good too!  I thought the mac and cheese was just ok..a little too watery for me but still good.

Ambiance: Beautiful, as can be expected with a Wynn restaurant. There is a large statue of a curvy woman in the center, and the room itself has a good use of curves. Floors are intricate mosaic. They have an outdoor patio which overlooks the Encore adult pool, which is where we sat. 

Service: SO slow. This is the main reason I docked a couple stars. It took forever just to get our water, and a very long time to get our lunch. Not as up to par as the other Wynn restaurants. 

Food: Get the chips and guacamole/ salsa! The chips are crispy without being too greasy, and the guacamole is flavorful and the perfect consistency. Perfect. 5/5 stars. I ordered the crab rolls, which were pretty good. The rolls they came in were excellent. The crab was fresh but too much mayo, and could have used a bit more flavor.

5571248,2010-03-30,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Okay, if you are reading this review.... you've gotta take it with a grain of salt.  This place is a steak house.  I am an ""i dont eat beef, chicken, pork"" vegetarian.  I do eat fish every so often, but you know....

So i came here for dinner with some girlfriends before a show.  Their bread was good...it was olive bread and i LOVE olive bread.  I ordered the two soups (french onion and some veggie one).  The french onion was amazing.  I did order it without cheese, so i was able to savour the flavors without having to deal with cheese.  The veggie soup (too bad i forgot which one) was good too....but i didn't finish it.  Do i regret not finishing it?  Not so much.  I then ordered the potato gnocchi.  It was in a tomato basil sauce.  I asked for no cheese on this too.  It was good, but i'm not really a gnocchi fan.  It was really POTATOEY.  I had like 3 or 4 gnocchi's and I was done.  I did try my cousin's macaroni and cheese (side) and it was DIVINE.  The macaroni and cheese alone gave this place an extra star!!!

I'm a really good sport about steakhouses even though i dont eat meat.  It was a good ambiance my only quirk was: 

*** we had a 9pm reservation.... they were very slow with getting us seated.  it was almost 920-930 when we actually sat down.  They did send us a little crab cake bite to hold us over...but it was right before we were seated.

5650428,2012-06-20,1,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Oh, where to begin with this spectacular fine dining establishment within Encore? I have now been privileged enough to dine here four times in the past 15 months or so. I remember our first experience being underwhelming... but the last three? 5 stars in every facet of each experience. These last three times: January, March, & June-- just this past weekend. 

TIP: Call days ahead for reservations to secure a decent time for your party. They can get rather busy and it's no fun to be stuck with a 10:00 pm reservation time.

The restaurant itself is quite intriguingly designed. Everything is ""plus-sized"" (to be at the very least euphemistic)-- the chairs, pictures, pillars, windows, etc. It can be very dark inside but this complements the upscale and classy atmosphere. The tables, however, are perfectly lit; details on your dining mates' faces are crystal clear (but wait until the Mango Fuego hits you). They play an EDM/electronic mix in the background and it had fantastic song selection. 


Speaking of Mango Fuego, they have some semi-inspiring house cocktails. My favorite, if you couldn't already tell, is the Mango Fuego; it is essentially a habanero & mango infused margarita. Just the right amount of spicy-sweet ratio makes this a true winner. At $15 a piece, though, be careful on ordering more than one of these delights. 

Our last three experiences have offered spectacular service from the wait staff. Water glasses always full, the table always tidied up, and frequent visits from your main waiter equate to a more pleasant meal and a rising price tag for the tip. 

I guess I should get started on the food...it's kind of important, no? 

--Mushroom Tart ($16): Made with several different mushrooms and gruyère cheese, this is one of my favorite appetizers in all of Vegas. It is rather small, however-- so, I suggest that no more than two people split it. 

--Heirloom Tomato Caprese Salad ($18): Let me preface my review for this item with the fact that my family and I are suckers for a good Caprese. This is one of the best we can remember. Although this last time they were out of burrata cheese and used mozzarella, it was still a winner. Ask for more of the balsamic reduction! 

--Truffle Mac & Cheese ($12): The last decade has shown Las Vegas' infatuation with serving macaroni & cheese-- a rather simple dish in and of itself-- in every opportunity possible. Botero nails theirs. Extremely rich, but I kept reaching for more to further enhance my main meal.

MAIN DISHES

--Kobe Short Rib ($40): If you're looking for something richer than Bill Gates himself, then this dish will be sure to satisfy your palette. Served with potato puree, it can be too much for a single guest. That didn't stop my sister's boyfriend from devouring the whole thing in 2.5 seconds, though. I had a bite and it was scrumptious, per the usual.

--Black Bass: I'm typically not a fish fan, but I will order it every once in a while. My mom loves fish and ordered this dish, just to give it a trial. (Oh, count me in on rhyming during this review, too).  It had thin circles of shaved potato crusted on (view my picture I uploaded). It also came garnished with a few mini pieces of pork belly. Now, I had never tried this as anything with the name ""belly"" should never be consumed at a restaurant like this. Buuuut, wait. This was like intense bacon. I wanted more as I am kind of a bacon fanatic. I'll stop rambling about my bacon obsession for now.

--Brioche Crusted Rack of Colorado Lamb ($49): This has forever cemented itself in my mind as the best lamb I could possibly have. I typically don't order lamb, as I think it's sad (just imagine their 'baaaaaahhhhh'ing in the back of your mind)...but this was downright phenomenal. I'll definitely be back even if I just get this dish. 
It came garnished with a house made fettuccine tossed with some lamb shoulder and caramelized carrots (big plus, this was amazing). 

--Strawberry Shortcake: My family loved this. I wasn't a fan, and I could eat strawberries and cream every day of my life. I just didn't like the actual shortbread, perhaps. 

Oh, Botero. You're quickly climbing the ranks as my favorite Vegas restaurant. You may just eclipse my beloved SW Steakhouse next time around!",qT4Tnxde6kNokU5G4Fhv4A,3,5,5,P7dpnm9O1szm_3ibCQzhvw

We started with a lobster stuffed twice baked potato, which was very rich and creamy. For my entree I had the roasted branzino with nicoise vegetables and a side of the polenta with chrentrelle mushrooms.

Next time I would just ask to get a dinner size portion of that because it was incredible.

I ended up have two of them and wished I could eat the whole entire rack. All the other seafood on the tower were also so fresh and the cocktail sauce was so good. For the entree, I had the bone in filet (16 oz.) with the Chimichurri sauce on top. It was good, but it was way too much taste for one girl to handle. The whole table shared sides of truffle macaroni & cheese, mild mushrooms, and creamed spinach. OMG... all of us were having food coma. To end our dinner, we had mini ice cream sandwiches.

As far as the bar goes the drinks are amazing and the bartender is very attentive I forget his name but he works hard. The hostess and servers do not have the snob attitude you might find at many Vegas restaurants. 

The food is on point and delicious. We had the truffle Mac n cheese at the bar for an appetizer and it was so bomb the next day we had it for out dinner appetizer. One order is more than enough for 2 people and its probably hands down the best Mac n cheese in Vegas. We also had the twice baked lobster bake potato which was good as well. 

Dinner we shared was soooooo good. The table bread comes with a lemon zest ricotta instead of butter which was some bomb food network type ish serving ricotta instead of butter.  We shared a ribeye steak that was on point and the quality was top notch.  The chef also added different sauce for flavor which we preferred on the side. The downside I guess was the tables was a bit close and the server seem to try hard but was not able to tend to us as some other top notch steakhouse servers have in comparison.

Didn't speak anything of it when we arrived but at the end of dinner, they brought him a plate of brownies with happy birthday written across it and a candle. We ordered the hamachi tartare (delicious! And I'm usually not a fan of hamachi) also not too fishy tasting for people who aren't keen on raw fish.

I ordered the petite filet (8 oz) and bf ordered the 12 oz filet both in traditional and medium rare. The meat was cooked more like medium but was still very tender and juicy. It was also thick and at least 2 inches high. It came with a fig cookie which I thought was a very nice touch to add to the flavor of the meal. 

We also ordered the truffle Mac and cheese. This was the best part of the meal. Not overwhelming in cheesiness and had a crispy layer on top. It came in a flat claypot type of dish.

For dessert, we got the ice cream cupcakes, and to be honest, we weren't expecting so many cupcakes. There were 6 total, all diff flavors. The cake part was a bit dry but I suspect it's because they were refrigerated to keep the ice cream from melting. 

We were happy with our meal except for our drinks. Bf's glass of syrah was too dry for his liking and my grape crush tasted more like plastic and grape medicine :(",hYrd3Ozj5WLXn3yIi3BZgg,0,0,4,WE46OBNCXfZFv7VuqNBefg

Here's what we went for:
Warm Beet Salad -- delicious! The goat cheese on the side is to die for!
Mushroom Tart -- great. It looked like a mini pizza, but was extremely well done. The flavors blended so nicely.
Hamachi tartare on crispy rice -- My boyfriend HATES sushi, but this he LOVED!!! You get 4 mini round crispy cakes topped with the hamachi tartare. Its unbelievable.
Crudo tasting -- You get salmon, tuna, hamachi, and scallops, or in my case, more salmon. It's citrusy and garlicy and all sorts of yummy deliciousness!
Dover Sole special -- buttery with just the right amount of crispiness
Truffle Mac and Cheese -- you'll NEVER go back to Kraft!!!
Chocolate souffle -- I thought it was ok, but the BF LOVED it!
Dirty Belvedere Martini -- YUM!!! Not strong at all -- I could have drunk this all night long!

We started off great.  The oysters on the halfshell were amazing, and the kobe beed tartare was awesome.  Step One, 5 stars!

I had the bone in ribeye, which was good, but not cooked perfectly.  Don't they have a thermometer or something?  Oh well.  But the meat was good and the rub was perfectly salty.  They also have different rubs, which seemed interesting: pepper steak and chumichuri (sp?), for those that may be interested.  Step 2, 4 stars!

The sides were where I was sore disappointed.  I had the french onion potato gratin and creamed spinach, with fried egg.  Both were really not good.  I had a couple bites of both and decided not to waste my stomach space for it.  I should have tried their tator tots or something.  I don't know.  Sides, 1 star.

Other than the food, the decor is really cool.  The patio seating also seems nice because it's outside, and near a little lake?  And, the Encore is a beautiful hotel!  Stayed in the tower suites, and had a great stay.

+Nice that you've got options on how you take your steak beyond just the basic salt and pepper.  
+Attentive service without feeling overly snooty.

-Dont waste your time with the seasoning options beyond salt and pepper.  The rosemary can get really overpowering.

I usually order seafood for my entrée, last  time I got the Halibut, this time I skipped the entrée all together. My boyfriends cardinal rule is ""I judge fine dining restaurants by the filet"", so he ordered his rare, as usual. I decided the times I've come before that I fill up and enjoy the sides more than ordering a single entrée. We went nuts ordering sides, I highly recommend all of these: truffle mac and cheese, tater tots, wild mushrooms, creamed spinach with fried egg, whipped potatoes, and Botero fries... YES, we ordered every single one of these in one sitting... belt busters but so good.",tnCmBWkkAxYgXLYqy0KgQQ,2,2,4,BbfQvzSQJvYHrB-Oa_7zZA
5826612,2012-03-19,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Went here last week during the SHOT show.  Stayed in the Encore so we walk past Botero when we go almost anywhere outside our room.  Always wondered what was up.  After reading about it we took the plunge and WOW it was worth it.  Spendy for us but a few times a year a $350 dinner is fun and this one was yummy.  

We had great soups to start then a good wedge salad then some of the best steak and seafood.  We got excellent service because we went in there late.  I like to eat late in Vegas because the places are not so crazy and we can hear ourselves talk.  The inside of this place is really pretty cozy and not Vegas gaudy.  A great dark fountain in the inside and the pool outside XS for patio dining.  The night we ate there XS was closed so we could not hear the boom boom boom.  Great place try it.",UIFDbiTr1Ls24BaZ7wkzgg,0,0,4,4njMkqtXnjO7rySEQzAkbQ
5836199,2014-11-05,1,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"In five star vegas hotels, you expect everything to be marked up. However, Botero is not as overpriced as one might expect. I came for a nice steak dinner on a Friday night - - it was halloween night. I anticipated a crowd, but the restaurant was very large, spacious and dark, so the atmosphere was great for a nice date. Here is a list of items I ordered:

Ribeye Steak: I am a sucker for ribeye steaks, and Botero really hit the spot. As a steak-lover, that ultimate sear on a steak that I cannot do at home is what i pay the extra cost for (and the higher quality meat). The steak was juicy, tender, medium-rare, flavorful (it was fatter than expected, which contributed to the nice flavor), and beautifully seared. Even at slightly above the cost of a ribeye steak in nice LA restaurants, the money was well-worth it.

Seafood Platter: I had a mix of oysters, alaskan crab legs, and prawns. Other than the Alaskan crab legs, which I don't eat as often, the oysters and prawns were average. Seafood is generally expensive, so don't expect otherwise.

Bone Marrow: I have had bone marrow at many many places, and this is comparable to CUT. Because bone marrow has a fat and oily texture, the crispy bread and sweet caramelized onion really complements and reduces the fatness. This was very well done, and was delicious. 

Mac n Cheese: it is very difficult to make a bad mac n cheese, but it is also hard to make an amazing mac n cheese. This one was serviceable when I ate at Botero, but for whatever reason as leftovers, this was amazing.

Milk bonbon Lollipops: My girlfriend really wanted a picture of the lollipops, so we ordered 2. At 3.50 a pop, it was not too expensive, and was actually quite good. After a full meal, the popsicle was a nice finishing touch and was not overwhelming because each popsicle does not come with much ice cream.",Erf1Jb6H6hsQHiLtn3G_-g,1,1,4,HqhleMEYiSeKfR3XgXFIzA
5878016,2011-03-13,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"We went threw Las Vegas in Sept of 2010 and we where walking down the strip and stopped at the Encore to look around and had thought we'd eat at Botero. The line was so long and they were so full we couldn't get a table. Since that date we were sad about not going so when we made our trip back in March 2011 we made it a point to make a reservation and go. It was totally worth the wait.

We started out with the short rib ravioli and creaser salad. Both were amazing and pretty good sized portions. The steak tartar was good so I'm told (I didn't want to eat the raw meat and I don't like eggs let alone quail eggs but it was scarfed down). It was served with the most amazing french fries I've EVER had - perfectly crispy outside and soft inside and some baguette bread. I got the 8oz steak  which came with an interesting shortbread sandwich cookie that had blue cheese and fig inside it which was amazing! We also got two of their side dishes, we got the ""fondue"" mashed potatoes which had mozzarella cheese infused into them somehow they were fantastic we also got the truffle mac and cheese which had panko type bread crumbs on top - it was just amazing there are not words to say how good it was.  

We were pretty full as the food was quite plentiful on each plate but we'd seen the reviews and saw that they had a s'more dessert. Small donuts covered in graham cracker crumbs you could dip in chocolate or vanilla sauce and was served with marshmallows which was amazing the reviews were right they tasted amazing and rounded out this amazing dinner.

The price tag was HEFTY but for a once in a while thing it was totally worth it!",ybWtay2XciMV1lBFJgBxSw,0,0,5,v6UorCEwNPJKSki1S7CRGg
5908561,2013-04-20,0,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"I spend a lot of time at the Wynn so I dont pay for meals there. So this review is completely non-biased based on a free meal. I took my wife out for our anniversary and decided to try something other than my favorite at SW. Botero disappointed badly. We had the filet and the lobster. 

I asked for a bone-in fillet. I got a bone-in rib eye. Not a big deal, but the waiter made the situation awkward by showing me his notes and telling me i was wrong. Ok, maybe.  I apologized and said if its not a big hassle could I get the fillet.  

It came 15 min later and it was completely raw, and i mean it was beyond rare. I asked the waiter to see in his notes if i asked for rare or med-rare, and he said med-rare. I asked him to take a look at our steaks. He looked at it and said, ""is it too much or not enough?""  I looked at him in disbelief and said would you mind cooking this a little more?

Later, the manager came over and asked us if everything was taken care of.  He had heard about what had happened.  I explained to him that i wasnt upset about human error, but that snappy comment from the waiter was uncalled for. He said he saw the cut and agreed it was very rare. He offered to give us dessert but i had lost my appetite and declined. After a bit he came back and said he took the steak off our check. I thanked him for his generosity, said the meal was comped anyways.  He was very nice, and for that i added a star.  

Truthfully, there are a million better places to spend $250 for 2 than Botero. Even free, i would prob not return.

Oh, and the chimichurri is not really a classic chimichurri.  It's olive oil and herbs.  And the ceasars that i read about below how great it was. It was better at the buffet. The ahi tartare was decent.",zyMB50UtmEuQf-1VUKxZxQ,0,0,2,8-aOrmt4uPUVIw7RTenLEQ

5940525,2012-08-16,2,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"Back when the husband was just a boyfriend, we came to Vegas because the ""boyfriend"" Vegas drought was for two years.  I felt so bad for him so I planned a little weekend getaway.  Boy, did we take advantage of Vegas because we maxed out two credit cards!

However, one dinner check was definitely worth maxing out the credit card.  Why?  Because their steak is to die for!!!  When it was time to go back to Vegas as a final summer hoorah for my brother-in-law, the first restaurant we thought of was Botero, which was convenient since we were staying at Encore.

For our appetizer, I ordered the Tuna Tartare.  I have a thing about ordering Tuna Tartare at every restaurant that offers it.  So far, Wolfgang Puck at MGM Grand is my favorite.  However, Botero's Tuna Tartare comes in a very close second.

The steak was just as delicious as I remembered it to be from a year ago.  I ordered the bone-in ribeye to be split with a friend, covered in chimichurri sauce.  The bone-in ribeye taste like any other bone-in, however, it's the chimichurri sauce that makes the steak taste so fantastic!!  The husband ordered the NY Steak and the brother-in-law ordered the Filet Mignon.  Both got the chimichurri sauce.  

I've been to many steakhouses in Vegas and this is probably one of my favorite places to go.  I would definitely come back.",Y8JkV2a4tlDwWLkVCL_LNg,3,2,5,tx1oCLd5Mn9vbmWtO7WQCg

5959914,2013-02-06,8,ubz4CaZXagQuGv2N9gFAdw,"This is my 700th review and I'm so glad I get to celebrate it with a five star review!

My fella and I planned a stay-cation at Encore this past Sunday and were very excited to try Botero while we were there. We arrived on Superbowl Sunday just around the end of the game so the place was still pretty empty. We were greeted warmly and shown to our seats. They gave us the option of sitting on the patio but we chose to sit inside instead.

Once seated, our waiter quickly took our water orders and let us peruse the menu for a little bit before returning for our drink and food order. I had been doing my homework so knew exactly what I wanted already. We started with the dungeness crab agnolotti and grilled octopus. The server mentioned that these were two of his favorite dishes, so I already knew we were on the right track. My fella went with the bone-in ribeye with rosemary prawns and I ordered the bone-in filet with foie gras. I just couldn't resist. To round our our order we decided on the brussel sprouts with pork belly and truffle mac n cheese for our sides. I was already worried we ordered too much, but we forged ahead. 

Our appetizers came out quickly and they smelled heavenly. My favorite was the dungeness crab, but the octopus was prepared well as well. I enjoyed the gnocchi, they were like heavenly little pillows. Just as we finished our appetizers our steaks and sides were delivered. They were enormous and smelled fantastic. I couldn't wait to take the first bite. Both steaks were perfectly cooked and we were so happy with our choices. The truffle mac n cheese and brussel sprouts were good. Not the best brussel sprouts I've ever had, but they were still delicious. I probably would have preferred them without the pork belly, crazy I know. 

We savored every bite but still couldn't finish everything, so we had quite a bit to take home for a midnight snack later. Despite not finishing all our food, we couldn't resist trying their famous smore beignets. I'll admit I wasn't blown away by these, but that's mostly because I'm not a huge fan of smores or any combination of these flavors. The dessert was amazing nevertheless, but I would be more interested in the key lime dessert next time around. 

This is a great location for large parties, they have quite a number of tables that can accommodate large groups before heading to the nearby clubs and they have an eclectic variety of music playing in the restaurant to get everyone pumped up. Overall, we had an amazing date night experience and I look forward to returning again!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,23,20,5,i3ycrksRlevEsxJ0SHZbJQ

We have eaten at several places there, but I singled out Botero, because it has the more unusual veggie fare of the bunch. We bought a bunch of smaller items and did a lot of sharing and everything was wonderful.

And for the locals, don't forget about the Wynn Resorts for your special ocassions... It's such a relief to find a veggie friendly place where you can show up in dressy attire and have candlelight and romance.",-rW_Q9pknwudToXWfRNZsg,3,0,4,ggdsLy-mDBnRSo60iR_sTQ

I had a reservation, so the hostess promptly escorted me to my table next to the window looking out at the pool.  I chose to sit indoors, but I was offered my choice of either.

My server quickly came over and I asked for the vegan menu.  He went over the options with me and pointed out some of his favorites.  Per his suggestion, I decided to go for the vegan tasting menu.  

Vegan bread and butter was brought out for me and it was delicious.  I ate the whole basket even though I had four courses AND dessert still to come!

Every single course was fantastic (photos included in my review).  I will tell you a little about each course:

Artichoke soup with vegan ricotta: delicious and presented very well.  Ricotta and cashews in the bowl and the server poured the broth on top

Roasted hearts of palm ""bone marrow"": This sounds weird for someone who doesn't eat animal products, but it was amazing!!!  The grilled country bread and onion jam with it were perfect.

Ancient grains penne and morel mushrooms:  This was delicious!!  One of my favorite courses.  It was tossed in fava bean pesto and was seriously paradise for my tastebuds.

Portobello steaks and kale polenta: I was so full by the time this came along, but it was fantastic.  I was severely impressed and pleased by this dish.  Cooked perfectly, presented perfectly.

Strawberry rhubarb pie:  Usually the tasting menu comes with a chocolate dessert, but I don't like chocolate.  I asked for this one instead.  It was delicious!!  Strawberry almond ice cream and almond brittle on top of the delicious pie.  

The food was delicious and the service was impeccable.  The timing of the courses was right on as well.  Just so you know, I am 5'6"" and 110 pounds and I ate ALL of this food, every last bite.  It was that amazing!  Well done Botero, well done.",5jZCm98_09LCqJL7WULqgg,0,0,5,7HX-G8rDc7BtOk6KVCp5Kw

The restaurant decor is trendy and fashionable.  I was optimistic about the food, but it just did not deliver.  This may be because we were ordering off the Supper Club menu, but it just wan't very good.  We dined tapas style with french fries and homemade ketchup, pork belly sliders, kobe beef sliders, and other forgettable dishes.  None of the dishes were bad, but then again none of them were really good either.

I wouldn't do it again.  It was a comped dinner and I still wouldn't do it again.  I can't speak for a full dinning experience here, but the Botero Supper Club is a sad experience and I would discourage someone from doing it.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,2,1,2,E3R43yAp_eXyj3IxsaM4_g

Really liked my food..Had the Hudson Valley Foie Gras w/ a pineapple financier. The pineapple financier was weak and forgettable but I love foie gras and it was seared beautifully. 
The bone in rib eye w/ chimichurri was very tender and tasty..
My dayboat scallops were also delicious but the potato cake underneath just tasted like a tiny hash brown.
