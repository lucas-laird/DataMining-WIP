Take it from me - the chicken tacos with chips and guac will knock your socks off!",hyBENyHJ43GH8OsTRiT6kw,2,0,5,28vaxHuu5k3IzgVkwYjejA

The meat was really good, I was even able to find rings that I haven't seen in years. Things that one can only find in their native country. They even had chamomile roots there. The checkout was quick and the girl who rang me up was very sweet and kind. Thank god for this place!!!!",aYQJXDv2cgbQyzkjoZj7Qw,0,0,5,Z7JaG4myIPT_VBneYgyHaQ

2296250,2013-10-01,3,pUX9gzo1Tf4vRv7hX0eP1g,"Holy, burrito moly, best carne asada burritos hands down in town. 

The meat is the most flavorful, tender meat ever. This is the only place we buy our meat for cookouts, I swear by it. It's affordable and delicious, get your butt down there now. It's a large burrito with fresh refried beans, tasty rice, sour cream, Mexican creamy cheese, and the carne asada meat. Only 5 bucks and worth every penny, 

When I was pregnant this was my go to place to grub and get my addiction, aka craving. Yes, hardly anyone speaks English and men look at women like they're meat, but I can handle all of that for the award tasting food, lol

 Writing this review reminds me that I need to go there sometime this weekend for one :)",WaAOt_eG0_-yLpG3fI--3g,9,5,5,3_zz_qnI1yp7wSl7G9ng8w

3444543,2017-05-31,0,pUX9gzo1Tf4vRv7hX0eP1g,"I wasn't real thrilled with our order. We ordered through grub hub so it was delivered to our door. I ordered a chimichanga with rice and beans. The only thing good was the beans. The chimi was covered in a gross cheese sauce ( never seen chimichangas with sauce before?)  I tried to wipe it off and eat it but couldn't ignore the nasty sauce taste. The rice looked and tasted a couple days old. It wasn't soft, but a little crunchy. Like stale. 
I ordered 2 carne asada tacos for my fiance and i, they were disgusting. The tortillas were burnt & the meat was chewy and tough. 
I dont eat Roberto's, but I'd eat there before I'd ever eat here again.",bPT6Y8t1IV9U078i6ZAIXQ,1,0,2,nknmtuyTJH8UHcX8KGHD5w

I bought the pre-seasoned and marinated meat for a recent BBQ at Los Compadres. The proteins purchased were pork chops ($2.49/lb), chicken breasts ($2.99/lb), and carne asada ($5.99/lb). The quality was great, all were easy to cook, chop up and serve in tortillas with all the toppings.

If your Spanish is no bueno, don't worry. They've got employees at this little Mexican market who speak English. The quality of their produce looked good, although prices were about the same (sometimes even more expensive) than what you would find at big chains like Albertsons or Smiths. I thought I'd save plenty of money by shopping here instead of those places, but I really didn't. I'll come back, though, to get my taco meat fix.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,2,4,fZgRncCt8UUqXPD0KEigqw

We actually have done almost 100% of our meat shopping here for the last 3 months. Their breaded chicken (Pollo) is perfect, pounded very thin with a nice breading is perfect for a quick meal after a long day at work. They have a good selection of made on premises sausages - we particularly like the Longaniza - which is similar to its Portuguese counterpart. I've been making my own al Pastore for years but since I've rediscovered La Herradero, Its no longer a 3-day process for special occasions for my family. Get at least 2 pounds weekly to make quick tacos. 
We recently started getting premade food from their small but efficient kitchen. Their carnitas are divine.  We also like the carne asada, chili verde and their delicious pastries.  

It's clean, most of the people speak English, they are kind and helpful. More than the surly folks at big box grocery stores.",Y9kqjPcj-QCsH48PWATQ3g,1,0,5,rmWo6XtgJaUct-_sVQPF9Q
