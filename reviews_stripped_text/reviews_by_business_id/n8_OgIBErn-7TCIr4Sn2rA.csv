1208547,2017-03-05,1,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"I Was excited to learn the former owner of Glutton, Bradley Manchester, is the executive chef here. The menu consists of typical oyster bar items along with new additions that make the menu stand out from other oyster bars. Was left a little disappointed. 

Service was a joke. The waitress was lost. Only 16 or so seats & the chefs were cleaning the table area. Not the 2 waitresses on staff. Very limited service from them. A chef shouldn't have to clean when he has a second when he's cooking for everyone. They give you complimentary chips with your meal that we noticed other people enjoying. We had to ask for them.. Along with water & it took forever. Plus we had to ask to have the previous diners dirty dishes taken away. She kept thinking it was ours. Nice girl but with only 16 seats or so I can't understand the bad service. WTF!!!!!!!

Tuna tacos wonderful, 5/5. Shrimp and grits to die for 5/5. Linguine and clams thumbs down. Worst I've ever had. For starters it's not even linguine but fettuccini noodles.  Weird pieces of what they call ""clams"" were red chunks of rubbery ??????? Some of the shelled clams were a little gritty. The sauce was not that bad but I wouldn't order it again. Could be a gem. 
Needs work....maybe they were having an off day.",8Ox2EA8A7FVSzVEM3TRn7Q,4,1,3,O3razUdSBRiPDU7Wcw1V6w

1241407,2017-07-18,1,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"What an amazing restaurant. From beginning to end, every thing was delicious. Our lunch started off with complimentary house made potato chips, that were lightly seasoned with spices. My friends and I ordered a dozen oysters, and they were very fresh. The oysters were shucked right in front of us and it was an amazing site to see. My friend had the Pan Roasted Mussels, which were absolutely delicious. She was given a bowl of many mussels that were soaked in a beer based sauce. Even though it was beer based, the sauce was still very light and tasty. It had hints of cheese and had a slight smokiness to it, where the smokiness came from the bits of bacon that were put in the sauce. The dish was accompanied by two thick slices of bread, which soaked up the sauce very well. My other friend and I shared the Classic Crab Pan Roast, which was absolutely delicious. We were surprised by the giant chunks of crab that spread throughout the pan roast, and the amount of chunks were not stingy. it was in a thick. tomato based sauce that did not overpower the natural sweetness of the crab. The slight saltiness in the sauce accentuated the sweetness of the crab.

This place was absolutely wonderful. A great place to take all seafood lovers.",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,2,1,5,J_RTkBjXT6F6eS_lNsRcgw

It's bar-seating only in this cozy joint which only makes the meal more intimate. You get a prime view of your meal getting made and get to interact with the chefs. The folks that work here are all just absolutely lovely. The food though is where it's at. I had the popular ""all-in"" classic pan roast and it was a rich dish chocked full of lovely, fresh seafood like shrimp, fish, crab, and lobster served with white rice. With every bite you're gonna get a nice serving of seafood. Bringing all the seafood together was an incredibly indulgent pan sauce with all the yummy seafood flavor plus cream and cognac. I was so satisfied by the end of the meal. 

The folks here are really accommodating and they can make a seafood steamer on request (not on the menu but think that's what I'll try the next time I'm back). So glad I found a new favorite place to eat at the Hard Rock.",DvcAC_nlKaTDsHcA8Slagw,0,2,5,KV8q1TtaC8CVSlnTtd3hvA

1881689,2017-07-24,1,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"We came for dinner on a Wednesday right before 7pm and there was seating for us despite the bar looking quite full. Server greeted us promptly and served our drinks along with complimentary chips right away. 

You'll notice the rack of condiments filled with an assortment of hot sauces on the bar table as you wait. 

We decided on the All In pan roast, lobster roll and corn chowder.

The food arrived at our table in this order: pan roast first, lobster roll next and the chowder last. It should have been the other way around lol.. It's the exact order we ordered it but we just found it weird how the order of what 'should' come first to last was reversed. 

As for the food, the pan roast was not piping hot. It came with rice on the side that tasted somewhat dry. The amount of rice didn't seem adequate enough for the serving of pan roast; it's like an ice cream soup sized serving. There was plenty of crab meat dispersed in the tomato based cream, two pieces of colosso shrimp and clumps of shelled lobster meat. The lobster meat was SO overcooked, it was rubbery, literally. We didn't finish this dish but we didn't feel it was worth taking the leftovers home.

The lobster roll was quite good. Note that it is COLD lobster salad on top which was refreshing. We've always had warm or hot lobster filling in the past and being made cold was something different that we actually preferred it made this way. There wasn't too much mayo dressing either. The lobster was just a tad over cooked but not to the point of being rubbery. The bread itself was grilled outside nicely and soft inside. It came with a side of steak fries. This was the highlight of our meal.

The cup of corn chowder was a little off putting for my bf from the extra virgin olive oil drizzled on the top but I was just okay with it. It had chunks of potatoes, wasn't too salty and was very thick and creamy. It was definitely heavy towards the end of our meal.

We may be back to try other items and get the lobster roll again. The pan roast was just alright to us that we wouldn't crave it again. The wait is better than other oyster bars for sure.",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,1,1,3,t6NFpgvvZYfCIZAPfdX2gQ

1. The look and design of the layout is clean and welcoming with a TV right in the middle so you can watch whatever game catches your fancy.

2. The server Jade was FANTASTIC! She was hustling and had all the seats under her belt with no unhappy customers. She's also very personable which is sometimes hard to find. 

3. The chips that they give you when you sit down were a bit salty but I think that's probably because I don't drink. I'm sure if I did the chips would be the perfect amount of salty. 

The old man ordered the Crab Cakes and the Po Boy and he said they were delicious. They must have been because they were gone in a heartbeat. 

I ordered a dozen Kumamoto oysters (my favorite) and they were SUPER fresh and ultra delicious! Yum! I could sit there all day and eat oysters. Even writing about it now makes me want to go back downstairs and have another dozen.

I also ordered the corn chowder but it wasn't my absolute favorite. Maybe it just didn't compare to the oysters or I had too much brininess from the oysters to really appreciate the flavors.

Pan roast was good, however not as thick as the palace station (Sorry for comparing but PS set the bar high). Even though viscosity was a little too thin for my taste, flavor was still on point. Spice level 3 out of 5 had a good kick without being overpowering. I'll probably get a 4 next time.  No bread came with it, only rice. 

We got a half dozen oysters as well. They were smallish in size but still very good. Very fresh and not fishy. 

My primary gripe would be that they have no draft beer here. Just cans and bottles which is not the same.

My friend and I shared the All-In Pan Roast ($24) with level 3 spice and found it to be a very tolerable amount of spiciness, just a low heat that wasn't too overwhelming with consecutive bites. The pan roast itself was creamy and had so many flavor dimensions in each bite that we finished the whole thing! 

Service was attentive, and they even offered to refill our sides of rice multiple times. As a result, I walked out feeling stuffed and inadequate to hit the club a mere 3 hours later - alas, life goes on (and I still made it to the club, woooo)

Here's a quick tip to help you out: 
Pan roast - milky
Gumbo - clear, includes okra

And seriously, everything seems pretty good, and the portion sizes of all the soups are huge.

Less positively, I'm not sure the fish & chips are on the menu anymore. As for the raw clams, you can't get them at the moment - Hurricane Harvey destroyed that option for the time being. Sadness.

Now for the bad: the oysters, which they are known for, aren't that great. The quality isn't that fresh, and they don't include the little forks a proper oyster bar should. The forks thing is a minor quibble.

GOOD: all the soup-based foods, larger portion sizes
OKAY: long wait, though good things come to those who wait

Other than that I would of gave it 5 stars but I got my gumbo with shrimp and was told it was the same price as the pan roast with shrimp $19 only a dollar more than the usual gumbo but was then shocked at the end to see I was charged a little more than told and no one had the courtesy to tell me until I got the bill not a big deal but I would of liked to atleast be told so I could decide if it was worth the extra $ or not.

3561698,2017-04-26,0,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"I wanted to eat the pan roast from Palace Station but couldn't wait in line for two hours since I was already starving. I saw this new opening on yelp and that they served pan roast so decided to give it a try and it was inside Hard Rock Hotel which was closer to me.

Came in a little after opening time, the bf and I were the first customers. Seatings are at the bar, maybe about 15 seats. They had two tv screens so we were able to watch the basketball game as well. Complementary homemade potato chips which were awesome. It tastes like sour cream and onion but not 100% sure what the flavor is. Either way, they were delicious.

Fried pickles and oysters ($13): they were so good! The breading wasn't overly battered or soggy but very crunchy, both pickles and oysters. Oysters tasted fresh as well. Comes with a buttermilk caper aioli which was a perfect paring.

Lobster roll ($23): I was surprised of the size, definitely bigger than most places I've tried. The lobster meat was plenty and juicy on top of a bed of lettuce in a grilled buttered roll. The roll was delicious itself. Comes with a side of steak cut fries which weren't too bad either.

All In Pan Roast ($24): I was most excited to try this since it was the main reason why I wanted to come here. Decided for the ""All in"" which had 2 giant shrimps, lobster meat (I think it was just the tail), crab meat, and some fish. Comes with a side of rice. You can pick level of spiciness from 1-5, 5 being the hottest. Opted for level 1 since bf doesn't like too much spicy foods. Even at a level 1 it was pretty spicy. I like spicy and that level was a good amount for me, bf on the other hand couldn't take the heat, poor boy. I even double checked with the waitress if it's a level 1 and she said that's actually just the base since level 1 they don't add any spices. So beware if you're not into spicy since it can be quite hot. Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the pan roast since I was hoping it would taste like the one from Palace Station but it didn't. Still good but not the flavor I was looking for.

Overall, I was pleased with this place, great food and awesome service. Waitress and the chefs were attentive. Bonus points since no wait! Probably since it was early; it did start filling up as we were finishing our meal. I would love to try their other dishes the next time I'm back.",y0XpxUt1G5AjsXdBcTOyEw,1,0,4,7NFuuT8cpVldIgZU1d_9wA

I especially appreciate that they have a very nice wine by the glass program. Many restaurants deprive their guests of decent wine when they order by the glass. The bar manager usually does not understand what the wine drinker wants and so buys some very cheap off-brand and marks the price way up.  I am happy to report that the Oyster Bar has pretty good wine by the glass at reasonable prices.

4535936,2017-10-14,0,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"My wife and I visited the Hard Rock Casino Oyster bar on two occasions.  In Sept 2017, we ordered the Classic Pan Roast for $24 and couple drinks. The food was very good and we left very satisfied. One week later, we went back and all turned 180 degrees.  I ordered the classic pan roast and it was more watery than the week before. My wife ordered the gumbo and she was not very pleased with how it was prepared by the chef.  The bill was around $50. I added a $7.50 tip.  A few days later, I discovered an increase on my credit card. The $7.50 tip was turned into a $75.00 tip. My receipt copy clearly showed that I wrote all figures correctly to include total amount with smaller numbers underscored.  My wife and I were the only two customers eating at the Oyster bar so how this mistake was made, I don't understand. 
I called the Hard Rock accounting and they were very responsive to fix this mistake.  Per our emails with the accounting department, I would be reimbursed $75.00. I felt that this was justified and I went along with this belief.  A few days later, $67.50 was put back on my credit card, so the tip was taken and given to the server.  Again I was caught by surprise by the Hard Rock Casino; they stipulated in the email that $75.00 would be returned back to my credit card. If I had not discovered this error, the server would have gotten away with a $75.00 tip. I do not feel a tip is warranted.  A mistake like this should never be done to any customer.
I emailed back to the HR accounting and voiced my dissatisfaction with the outcome. It's been ten days now and no response back.",3A0A027RUE7AZ1oH2UiYNQ,4,0,1,gRqEEAiGVRkbWWzE45ErJQ
4547528,2018-05-02,1,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"Living up to its name, it is actual bar seating with oysters.  Imagine a bar, but with no continuous drone of voices, much better lighting, great food instead of alcohol (although they do serve beer and wine, I believe), and guests feeling much different from the consumption.

This is one of several locations scattered around Las Vegas. We decided to visit this one at the Hard Rock Hotel since it was located near the day spa where we had appointments.  This happened to be in the early afternoon on a Sunday.  This particular area seemed to be the most happening part of the casino at that time.

The staff consisted of 3 front-of-house members (one server, one head chef, one assistant) who all assisted each other in duties, and there were 2 or 3 back-of-house members who prepared other items on the menu as well as tending to other things like dishware and ice. Overall, they did a great job, as the constant flow of customers keeps them moving.

Your meal starts with house-made chips, which are a lot more delicious than I anticipated.  We ended up getting at least a second helping of those!

We ordered some oysters before our entrees (had to!)  Amazingly fresh, and freshly shucked.  I'm not an oyster connoisseur, but they were absolutely fine by me.

I had the gumbo, which consisted of sausage, free-range chicken, fried okra, and a side of steamed rice. It was hearty. The temperature and the spice both have the potential to clear sinuses.  I love every aspect of it.  I highly recommend this item over the others on the menu, honestly.

Service was great.  Everything was kept up on schedule, and the staff did a good job schmoozing with the clientele in the process.

The only downside is that they only seat up to 18 people at a time. When we got there, a group of 9 were already and were split among the available space out of necessity.  They also have a sort of honor system where they just simply have to remember and recognize whoever is next to be seated.  So, anybody who walks up has almost no idea who is queued up.

Parking:  Free in the structure.

FYI:

- If you see nobody in line, that DOES NOT necessarily mean you're at the front next to be seated.  The wait can be as long as about a half hour, and that's a long time to stand.  So, if someone suddenly gets seated before you out of nowhere, it's because they got there before you did.

The shrimp and Grits 5/5- were a must get! , the grits were creamy, cheesy and had lots of flavor topped with 4-5 jumbo shrimp in a smoky light bbq sauce,  yummm so far best shrimp and grits in Vegas that I've tried. ..and I've been searching!

""All In"" Pan Roast 4/5- deep rich thick and creamy tomato base with bursting cajun flavors!  This had lobster (whole lobster tail), shrimp (4-5)and lots of BIG lump crab pieces and a side of rice on the side.  The only reason I gave a 4 was because the lobster n shrimp were a bit overcooked,  but it was still VERY good!

Atmosphere- it's located in the newer part of Hard Rock so kind of quiet right now, maybe because it's kind of hidden located right off the garage next to Harmon. 20 or so Bar seating with a restaurant like feel.

Although I haven't been to similar concept oyster places found at Harrah's, Palace Station, and multiple other properties around town, I can only imagine that they have very similar menus and price points to Oyster Bar in the Hard Rock.  I had a dozen raw oysters ($29) made up of what I'm assuming is a frequently, if not daily, changing selection of East and West Coast oysters (Malpeque, Chincoteague, Kumamoto, and one other West Coast whose name I can't recall).  I also had the ""All in"" pan roast ($24) made with a surprisingly generous amount of shrimp, crab, and lobster meat, which came with a side of white rice.  I washed it down with a can of Joseph James Citra Rye American Pale Ale ($8).  The oysters were exceedingly fresh and tasted of the ocean.  The pan roast was rich and satisfying.  My beer was pleasantly crisp and hoppy and one of the best tasting beers I've had in recent memory.  Oyster Bar was simple in concept, but delivered the goods.

5150796,2018-06-02,0,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"Wow, one of our worst dining experiences. First, the customer service. There was a sign to wait to be seated. There was one couple at the bar and four employees. They were so involved with talking to one another that they didn't even bother to tell us to sit where we wanted until four to five minutes later. The entire time we were dining, the workers were more interested in talking to one another than to tending to their patrons. We live in Vegas where the city prides itself on customer service and hospitality. For being a strip/off-strip establishment, this restaurant was a shame. We sit and the waitress takes our drink orders.  She brings water and then goes to the sink to pick basil or some herb. We sit there waiting for her to come back to take our food order- about ten minutes. We decided to start with the seafood platter for 2. We got one tray from one of the waiters. We ask why we only got one lobster tail and the other waiter had to emphasize to him that we ordered for 2. On each platter were rotten clams. My fiancé spit them both out because he immediately recognized they were no good. My platter also had clams with the poop sac still intact. They weren't cleaned properly. So we decided, since it was one of the worst seafood experiences we ever had- as well as costing over $50 to start, we wanted our bill. We asked the waiter for the check and the waitress that was originally taking care of us didn't even bother to ask how the food was. She just said, ""Oh, that was so quick. That's all?""

5204194,2018-06-23,2,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"My boyfriend really wanted to come to hard rock to check out the memorabilia and such. We figured we'd gable and drink (the usual in Vegas) we didn't think too much on the food.

I checked yelp (duh) and saw some really well rated spots, but this one stood out because we love oysters! 

Food and drink;

Oysters (5 stars) - amazing and the waiters were so well informed! I told them we liked Kumamotos and they gave us some similar ones that I forgot the name of which were fantastic. 

Pan roast (5 stars) - I don't like fish I don't like seafood in soups and I don't like tomato based soups lol. All signs point to my boyfriend picked this out for us to share and I went with it. Good thing! This stuff is awesome! Definitely more than enough for two of you get rice with it. 

Complimentary salt and vinegar chips (5 stars) - If they'd bag these id eat them everyday. They were a thing of perfection.

Fried fish (5 stars) - a little compliment from the chef after we talked with him and my bf explained how he hates heavily battered fried fish. He proved to us his was excellent and not over battered at all! Super flavorful, and flaky. Can't say enough good things about this stuff. 

Moscow mule (5 stars) - I had 3. Not because I needed 3 but because they were the best damn mules ever! 

This should be a Vegas must try for anyone who likes seafood because the selections here are superb and the chefs know their sh*t!",NOq2SPYWZ35EvzxzwVt-kw,3,3,5,dWQrzSNCek0IBBCxRyrMAQ

Promptly shuttering his critically praised Glutton just a few months back, the lack of DTLV foot traffic and support claiming yet another business as nothing but bars, Eat. and Carson Kitchen can seem to survive the lack of nearby residents and a tourist population that is there only for the neon canopy and 'cheap' booze, it was not long before Bradley Manchester landed a job heading up the rejuvenation of Hard Rock Hotel & Casino, the rumors of its pending acquisition by Frank Fertitta and the Station Casinos Group seeming all the more likely as one of the first things to debut was the Oyster Bar just off the gaming floor.

Originally concepted by Marcus O'Brien and Derek Litzinger, their relocation to a local country club likely to also yield some great food in the near future, Oyster Bar at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino features the same circumferential design as those at Palace Station and elsewhere, but elongated and with more polish, the team led by Manchester and two Sous plus a busy Cocktail Waitress working in plain sight from a menu that includes all the Raw Bar Standards and Pan Roasts, plus several twists on Seafood based classics.

Greeted by Chef Manchester on arrival, his mood upbeat and description of things to come - including the nearby Steakhouse concept from Morton's - explained with great excitement, those who have not been to the casino on Paradise recently may want to stop by soon in order to witness a more open floorplan that the Chef expects to evolve further in the coming weeks and months, the former Fuel Coffee Bar now a neon-lit Dunkin Donuts soon to be joined by a Mediterranean restaurant where 35 Steaks + Martini's resides while Pink Taco is also soon due for a menu reboot and exterior facelift.  

Proudly discussing the resources available at such a large property for sourcing, the vast majority of Oyster Bar's Seafood flown in daily, it was after a bit more chat that Manchester sprung to work with what was essentially carte blanche, the complimentary fresh-fried Salt and Vinegar Chips thin and nicely seasoned while Calamari ""Fries"" featured the Cephalopod sliced into strips and gently battered beneath thickened Soy and ground Peanuts, the light application of Sriracha adding a bit of heat that made the whole dish seem like something inspired by Thai cooking.

Offering six Belon Oysters on ice next, the meaty Bivalves described as ""The Rolls-Royce of Oysters"" living up to their billing with a coppery edge that dissipates with a bit of sweetness, Oyster Bar's Lobster Roll passes up on all the Mayonnaise nonsense to put nearly a pound of Butter-poached Crustacean on a housemade Roll with handcut Fries plus a variety of Vinegars and Hot Sauces, the $22 choice a better value than many found during peak season in the Northeast and easily the best tasted to date in Las Vegas.

At this point a local legend thanks to tourists up-all-night at Palace Station, it only seemed appropriate to next give the Hard Rock's Pan Roast a taste, Manchester and his team holding nothing back with an ""All In"" version featuring filleted Loup de Mer, a full Lobster, several White Shrimp plus Blue Crab in a piquant orange broth that, like the Shrimp and Cheesy Andouille Grits to follow, was not only flavorful and cooked perfectly, but more than enough to share.

Requesting a cup of the Poblano Corn Chowder based on personal taste, the use of lightly charred Kernels amidst the creamy base fortified by Potatoes and brightened by Garlic Oil, those looking for something a little more fancy would do well to request an order of Manchester's classic Linguini with Clams, the fresh noodles made on-site in the pastry shop cooked with a nice tooth amidst so much sliced Garlic and White wine that Vampires and significant others may be warded off, but well worth it thanks to both the just-cooked Clams on top and the copious amount of Bellies and Adductor Muscles found in the Sauce.  

****1/2 Located near the doors and proper ventilation, the gaming floor's smoke imperceptible from any of the high-backed, comfortable seats, Oyster Bar at Hard Rock Hotel & Casino sees one of Sin City's most well-liked Chef back in the spotlight with a smile on his face and big plans for the future while cooking up classics plus a few inspired additions at a price that is not only affordable, but essentially a bargain considering the portions and ingredient quality.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,13,9,5,eFDXvesz16qdORbj5Ms5xA
5384870,2018-04-04,0,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"The Oyster Bar at Hard Rock is awesome! A friend and I were meeting for happy hour and he suggested we come here. I honestly didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. The only seating is at the bar, but it's a decent sized bar so we only waited a couple of minutes for a spot to open up. Once seated we ordered some Michelob Ultras and checked out the menu. I have to say, the menu had so many more options than I expected. Seeing that it's called the ""Oyster Bar"" I figured it wouldn't be much more than a raw bar (which I love), but there was so much more to choose from! From salads, to sandwiches, to gumbo, there were plenty of options to satisfy any seafood lover's palate. We started with an order of calamari fries because my friend had gotten them before and loved them. Wow, they were awesome! They came out with spicy mayo and I believe eel sauce drizzled on them just like a sushi roll! They were great. We also ordered oysters (obviously), and then a seafood platter. It all tasted fresh and delicious. One slight disappointment was that our beers were served in cans rather than bottles. Not a huge deal, but still, I prefer my Michelob Ultras out of a bottle, especially when dining out. Overall though I would definitely come back here, and if you do, do yourself a favor and order the calamari fries!",BrKoAfW32omNcaFqW9pKsA,0,0,4,EeQsFbeyjOTLeP9bzVQJQg

Staff was pretty cool, only the girl who sat us and took our drink order seemed to disappear and drinks were slow to arrive. Ended up giving our food order to another person who wasn't servicing our area. So she gets 2 stars, and the rest of the staff 5.

Lots of patrons eating the gumbo, with one guy proclaiming its the best gumbo in town! Will have to try it next time. I had a lobster roll, and my friend had shrimp and grits. Both were pretty good, the lobster roll was lacking something or maybe too much bread from the panini style roll. 

Overall, I'd eat here again and try the gumbo. Shrimp and grits was delicious too.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,10,5,4,cO575dyFsvZpB9vXz-PAFw

We tried the raw oysters and pan roast at level 3. The oysters were good. Although on the smaller end, the oysters tasted sweet and not too gooey. The pan roast was just ok. Although the flavor profile was good with nice hints of seafood, tomato, and garlic, the consistency was watery. 

Service was somewhat attentive while we did have to flag down the server a few times. The place is small. If you happen to be at the Hard Rock, check it out.",LniV8mGWGuWLoJ96dhNVIw,8,3,3,b9F7q6VqBSgXmzMsr9mgdQ
5876233,2017-10-30,11,n8_OgIBErn-7TCIr4Sn2rA,"Two words. Fish & Chips. Or is that three words?

The set-up of the venue is wide open, first come first served, and it's a ton of fun. Interactive from start to finish, you get to watch all of your food being prepared and it's oh-so-delicious. Questions? Ask the chef. They are right there. You can't miss them.

My new favorite is the Fish & Chips. Thick cut fries with freshly battered fish hugs.

Highly recommend you pop in early to Hard Rock if you're going to see a show and grab some drinks and grub. Eventually I might need a season's pass for Magic Mike and this is a perfect stop for some nourishment before the show.",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,21,15,5,TcG56By-506_G4P_Xgnimg

As a resident of down town Las Vegas i was super saddened when Glutton closed but a friend told me that the old owner of Glutton was the guy who put the oyster bar together & like his restaurant downtown the Oyster Bar did not disappoint.

We had 1 dz of the blonde oysters (best oyster I have ever had), calamari fries and the shrimp & grits . Everything was spot on with flavors & freshness I would recommend this place in a heart beat to anyone wanting the best seafood. We will for sure be back very soon.",BPRMzqVa2JVhAI0kxKycGQ,0,0,5,eHbLoD5yE_HAI1cO5U3ezw
