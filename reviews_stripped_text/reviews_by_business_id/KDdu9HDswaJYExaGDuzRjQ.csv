Arrived at the menu was told they were backed up so I needed to wait a moment to place my order. No problem! About 10 minutes goes by and 3 cars lined up behind me. I proceeded to remind the lady I was waiting and just too make sure she didn't forget about me. She then says we're really busy right now and again refuses to take my order. I had a conversation with the lady behind me and they couldn't believe the situation either. I decided to just drive through as I was becoming hangry at this point. No other cars had been waiting at the window so thankfully I was able to drive right out. They could have been swamped inside for all I know but this situation just seems very unprofessional.

1078616,2017-10-21,0,KDdu9HDswaJYExaGDuzRjQ,"I am giving them 3 stars because they finally opened a Vegan restaurant in Centennial Hills! My happiness is tempered with caution, because I'm just not sure how long they will stay in business. They need to compete with other restaurants, and be so good that meat lovers (Carnists) will be willing to go there too. 

Sadly, I am the only Vegan in my family, and I was finally able to convince my Carnist Husband and son to go to Vegeway. They were out of more than one item on the menu, but we placed our order for ""fish"" tacos, veggie burgers, ""milkshake"", and fries, then sat down at a table to wait. It was a big disappointment to me that they do not have a soda machine or a refillable drink station, as that is something I enjoy when I go out to eat. We waited quite some time for the food, and when it came, only my tacos and fries showed up. My husband and son's food was nowhere to be seen. Somehow they had lost that part of our order. We showed them our receipt to verify that we had indeed ordered all of those things, then had to wait just as long as the first time to get the rest of our food. We didn't even get an apology, or offer of something to compensate. Even a free cookie for my starving son would have made an impression. I loved the fish tacos, and hubby loved the vegan milkshake, but the poor service made it so that my hubby won't take me there again.

Going out to eat as a Vegan is hardly ever an easy task, and it is so refreshing to go to a restaurant and know that anything you order is Vegan. I'm so disappointed in this place. I can get a Vegan veggie burger at quite a few places, so I would love to see more of those items that you miss as a vegan, but usually don't take the time to make for yourself. My ideas off the top of my head: vegan mac-n-cheese, brown gravy for fries, ""beef"" tacos. BBQ ""beef""sandwiches, etc. If the menu was a little more varied, I'd go every week and leave the hubby at home.",Zv_hsh1yBefL7bB6-8yxIg,3,0,3,1iXlrr8zDT81HvVv6PF1PQ
1125462,2017-05-04,0,KDdu9HDswaJYExaGDuzRjQ,"I am so happy that a vegan drive-through exists! After a lifetime of vegetarianism and several years of veganism, this was my fist time at a veggie drive through. I made a special detour to the Jones location on my way to the strip. 

However, I didn't enjoy anything about the experience or the food. I noticed that the prices and the wait time parked at the pick-up window were several times more than at a traditional fast food place, which would have been fine if the service and the food were amazing. I ordered a chicken wrap, popcorn chicken and a chocolate shake. Several minutes after pulling up to the pickup window and after I'd already paid, I was told that they were out of chocolate shakes so I eventually got a cash refund. 

When my food finally came out, I was excited to eat but I noticed later that there were zero napkins and zero condiments in the bag which made it a bit difficult. The popcorn chicken was extremely greasy and flavorless and I only ate a couple of pieces, even after I went inside for condiments. The chicken wrap was also very flavorless, and there were sun-dried tomatoes (?) that were so chewy that I couldn't get through them and had to spit them out. I usually love anything with guacamole in it, but I was wishing I would have just stopped at a Chipotle instead where I would have gotten more food with flavor for less money and less wait time. In Southern California there is a vegan comfort food chain called Veggie Grill, and while it does't have a drive-through, it puts this place to shame.

I waited 27 minutes for one cheeseburger in a short drive thru line. How does that even happen? 
They don't even give you one napkin with your order. This happened last time too and I thought it was a fluke, but apparently they're the only my place that doesn't provide one napkin for your messy burger on the go? 
I really like this place but drive thru and walk in times are crazy for what they market as ""fast food."" Are the workers trying to sabotage this place on purpose?

We are VERY excited about this vegan fast food restaurant with options such as soy free and gluten free. We were also told that the produce used is organic. The servers were friendly and knowledgeable about options such as gluten free that were not listed on the menu.

My girlfriend and I went there fairly regularly and then, for no particular reason, took a break. I returned last month only to find the place looking shabby. The sauce and condiments area was not maintained. There were empty spaces on the walls where posters of their food and additional locations used to be. The menu had been reduced or changed. Yesterday I went back with my girlfriend only to find it had further declined. Someone has purchased 1980's video games and is storing them in the restaurant. One is jammed into a space by the cash register. These machines are not operational. They're just stashed in awkward places. The restrooms were closed. The sandwiches seemed smaller. We had to ask for sauce since it wasn't provided. I am pretty sure we will never return. We are not picky people, but it felt like we walked into someone's attic and asked them to make us a sandwich.

I see you doing better and doing more on social media and in surprised to find the dinning area dingy. This other couple finished their meals before their fries ever showed up?! Bummer. So we ordered a combo and after the fact we asked for our drink options and find that you could have a coke, root beer or Diet Coke... or an option of iced teas. I'd imagine you can refill your tea if you chose but their soda is not coming from a fountain but from a case. So I doubt you can refill your soda. Our order was just called out to us instead of the previous ""we'll bring it out to you"" and now my partner is standing by for our fries as well. So not sure what's go by on back there.

I have tried and tried to like this food but its seriously one star for me. Thinking about it even gives me a ""film"" coating in my mouth. 

The third time I came here (today) I got the chkn wrap and seriously it weighted ten pounds. I was scared to even try it. Full of Veggie House brown rice, gooey chkn, tons of sundried tomatoes, wilty lettuce....just not good.


The burger patty is ok, but todays was dry like a hockey puck. The first time I tried one it had a melted plastic taste because of the Daiya, two more times I minus the cheese and onion and realize it just does not taste like a burger, why? no pickles. This place does not believe in pickles.

The fysh taco is good but wow its soggy and just a mess.  
The first time I tried, it had a great taste, guess I was super hungry.

Chkn bites are super gross and doughy and the ""ranch"" tastes like oily old dill.

Milkshakes are bomb but hey the ice cream is from Perfect Scoop.

The burger did not live up to my memories- bun was dry, cheese was cold, whole thing was barely room temperature. It seemed like it had been sitting out, very disappointing.
I tried the popcorn ""chicken"" and curly fries- texture was okay but neither had much flavor. I like that they have a dipping sauce available at the drink station. Would like to see them offer ""chicken strips"" as an option in the future, and/or more dipping sauces.

2318584,2017-03-13,0,KDdu9HDswaJYExaGDuzRjQ,"PREFACE: I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I'm just an average, run of the mill omnivore, and that's the perspective from which I'm reviewing this place. I decided to check out this place because I live nearby, I like to support local businesses, and I felt like eating healthy this particular lunch. 

First impressions : The service was a bit lacking, but I only saw 3 people working. So they may have just been understaffed. One thing that really caught me off guard is just how basic their menu is. I didn't realize before I came in that this place was basically a vegan take on a fast food burger joint. Literally the menu is: Burger, vegan burger, vegan fish sandwich, vegan chicken sandwich, vegan fish tacos, vegan beef sandwich, vegan chicken wrap, and then a few sides and one salad (this was the biggest surprise to me. A vegan restaurant with only one salad? Very interesting). They also don't appear to have any particularly creative or ""signature"" dishes.

Because of this, I went with the burger. Not knowing what exactly to expect, the burger was pretty average by meat-eater standards, but the blend of spices was reminiscent of Mediterranean food or even something middle-eastern. It wasn't bad, but I also wouldn't say that it made the burger amazing. The curly fries were good by any standards. 

Overall, I'm giving it four stars because my instinct was 3, but I also went in with incorrect expectations of the menu. So I gave them an extra star for leeway. I'll try it again sometime and update with how I feel after going in with intent.",fFGs67RhFZEsSPEXT_5wpQ,2,0,4,1YoOcBGlDnN8qKYz70xt_g

He did all this in a British accent.  Later it disappeared but not before ten minutes of listening to him talk about whatever came to his mind.  At least he didn't swear. 

The burger was very good. The problem I had with it was there was nothing on it as far as condiments go.  I understand that mayonaise would be a ""no no"" but what about mustard and ketchup on the burger?!  Yes, there were big vats of ketchup on the counter but some of us like those condiments to seep into the burger and mingle with the other tastes going on there.

I would much rather make a Gardein or Beast Burger at home.

The patties are pretty good. But the bread, cheese, etc...it just tastes like the absolute worst, not fresh quality.

As a veg, I like fresh & high quality veggies. No excuse for pink, flavorless tomatoes.

The cheese is like ""cheese product"" orange #4 flavor. It sticks to the roof of your mouth.

The popcorn chicken didn't even taste chickeny & there are a few dozen good chxn analogs at Smith's freezer aisle right now, so there's no excuse.

Zucchini were ok, kinda greasy soggy.

The ranch didn't really taste as accurately ""ranch"" as say, Daiya or Annie's (I think) vegan ranch dressings, but it is actually really good as a dipping sauce anyhow. The herbs are yummy. But I would take it home & make the fries at home, because the ones they have are so meh, soggy, nothing to write home about.

Milkshake was TOO fudgey chocolatey & icy & not milky creamy enough. It took like an hr to be meltable enough to go through the straw right. This was both times at two different locations. It didn't fit the taste of a traditional choc milkshake which is pretty easy to veganize.

The mango was just like, vitamin flavor creamsicle. Not good.

After waiting for 10 minutes, the cashier/cook told me that they ran out of bread (after I paid for my meal - $16 for a sandwich + fries) and asked if I would like to have a wrap instead or get my money back. I didn't want my money back since I already waited for 10 minutes! She wasn't apologetic for the inconvenience. Annoyed would be more of an accurate description.

While I waited, a customer from the drive-thru stormed into the restaurant and demanded to know why it was taking so long. She even told an incoming customer to not bother ordering because she was waiting for 15 min+ in the drive thru.

The wrap was okay, not terrible. The tortilla was flaky and it looked like it was old. I bit into it and it made a mess. Not worth it.

I ordered a cheeseburger, sweet potato fries, and a strawberry milk shake. The cheeseburger was OK and the meat texture, aroma and taste was pretty close to ground beef. I would give it an 8 out of 10. The fries were OK but a little dry and somewhat lacking in taste. The milkshake taste as if it was clearly made from non dairy products and missed the creamy taste that you normally get with a milkshake. You can see as depicted in the picture the milkshake has a vanilla colored appearance even though it was a strawberry shake. 

The restaurant staff was nice but appear to learning the job as they go along. I ordered my meal as an eat in, yet the clerk bagged it as a to go order. The meal is a bit on the pricey side as my bill was $12.32. Interestingly they also sell the ""raw""burger patties for those who want to cook there own at home.

This experience however was the worst experience had thus far. We wanted to try the new ""curry bowl"" if you can even call it that! I literally ate the curry portion of the bowl in 3 bites that's how small it was. There was like 3 pieces of onion and maybe a piece of bell pepper. The curry was also cold,not Luke warm, but cold. The rice was hard. I took one bite of it and was done. Vegeway had recently stated on Instagram that the fries would no longer be soggy. I can assure you that they were the furthest thing from crispy that you could have in a fry. I find it pretty upsetting that they can charge 16$ for two curry bowls and a side of fries and you actually have to have more food at home because part of the meal was so small and the other part was inedible. Honestly, if the quality of the food gets any worse I don't see myself coming back, which truly is a shame because as a vegan who works really long days, sometimes it's nice to be able to swing by a drive thru and get something to eat for my boyfriend and I on the way home.

As a result, it was quite busy and waited as expected because of the event on a Saturday evening.  Since it was my first time here, I went with the recommendations from the knowledgeable employee such as the chicken wrap for my mum, a fish taco, and a strawberry shake(made with almond milk).  

During the wait, I enjoyed the ambiance of beautiful photographs especially of exotic marine life decorating the walls.  Furthermore, I satisfied my thirst via the complimentary infused water while listening to the angelic singing voice.  

Afterwards, we enjoyed the food in the comfort of home.  Hence, my mum wants to go back again because she loved the chicken wrap.  Next time, we will minus the Cajun sauce because it was a bit too spicy for her taste buds.  However, I plan to order the fish taco again because it was very tasty.  Plus, the shake was excellent and plan to try a different flavor on my next visit.

Absolutely not what I wanted. Unfortunately I had went through the drive and so by the time I realized this I was home and couldn't do anything about it. Had I known, I would not have even wasted the time and money getting it. I then called the restaurant (multiple times before they answered) and asked them if they had changed the recipe. This girl simply said yes. I asked her if the original beef sandwich was still an option, she said yes but that they had run out of cilantro. I then asked her if this was just a temporary ""replacement sandwich"" until they received more cilantro to which she also replied yes and they would be getting it in some time next week. Why wouldn't you tell customers that when they ordered instead of throwing together random ingredients?! No compensation or apology was offered even though I did not receive what I actually ordered.

3666032,2017-08-28,1,KDdu9HDswaJYExaGDuzRjQ,"New update. I'm a regular here. I splurge on the vegan junk food once a week or maybe once every 2 weeks. I also bring friends and family to check it out. UPDATE I went today after hearing they have a new owner. And boy can you tell ""they have a new owner"". My big pull here was the fried zucchini. Now with the new owner and new cooks! The zucchini came out a slimy over cooked pile of mush! All the breading fell off or bunt!!. I don't want to totally demolish this establishment because if new management! I really want to see this vegan place succeed. Here's the problem. They don't have any of the old cooks that I saw anyway! When I came in at about 630 p.m today they informed me that they are out of EVERYTHING on the right side of the menu. So as I order they are behind me saying ""we don't have that"". The cashier was awesome and said she felt bad. But whoever was along side her seemed to be in ""charge"" she was not apologetic at all. They were out of French fries and vegan cheese and the entire right side menu. They decided to stop selling fountain drinks and replace it with some unknown homemade tea!! Guys please! I am not really a soda drinker but you can't have options of tea or water. If you want to go healthy then offer juices and smoothies. Bring the sods back asap. Learn to batter your tempura zucchini correctly and don't over cook it. Don't be out of HALF YOUR MENU. And then tell customers that you had a hard time. I do hAve a heart and care , but this is a business with a menu and people go out of their way to order food from you. They had no vegan chicken patty or even the ingredients for the monster fries. They are changing the entire decor inside as well (new owners) the frog on the wall is really unappetizing to me in a vegan establishment. There's a dirty running lava lamp sloppily place near the tea. Lots of clutter and just all and all I'm really sad to see such an amazing place go sour like this. Why change a good thing. Keep it simple and don't change the menu from what people originally loved there!!. Train your cooks!! The lady in charge asked me how I liked it and for that I will give 3 stars. I gave her simple advice on what wasn't good! I squeezed my zucchini fry and showed her there was no batter left on it and it was cooked to mush. She thanked me and listened but never did the next level of customer service and invite me back for a better cooked one next time. She was nice and I appreciate her listening . But I don't think they really get it yet. I will go back one more time in weeks from now to see how they settle in. As of now I won't waste my time going for an unorganized management with a staff that really does not know how to cook the food properly anymore ...I mean who really wants to waste their time and money driving all the way there for a nice vegan meal and not getting what you expect. I'm hoping in a few months it will improve. And guys get with it!! You have a menu! Whether you're new management or not or you just took it over that doesn't matter to people who are looking at your menu ordering while you say you don't have half your menu!! you make sure that you get up early and prep!

Today I felt like I needed to go through the drive thru and get my veggie burger on. I will say that I am not a vegan but I do enjoy a good veggie burger every now and then. So, what do you do when you're craving fries and don't want to drive too far? You get in your car, in your pajamas, and drive to this place. 

It's in a small parking lot with a bunch of other business so look out for cars parking and backing up. They have a little sign pointing to the drive thru(go that way) and they have the standard menu/speaker set up. As soon as I pulled up the lovey voice at the other end told me to look at the menu and let her know when I was ready. Well, I'm a prepared mofo(usually only when it comes to food), so I already knew what I wanted. #1 with curly fries and a Dr. Pepper, please. 

""Bad news"", the voice at the other end says. My first thought is literally ridiculous and that's that they've run out of food. It's worse: they don't do curly fries anymore. I tell the voice at the other end that this is my first time here and I am crying inside(let the dramatics begin). I may be crying inside, but I'm also reasonable, so I say regular fries are fine. Then she informs me that they've stopped selling sodas and they only have bottled Coke left. No, I don't want Coke. I start to question my life decisions at this point. I agree to their mango iced tea. 

I pull up to the window to pay and inquire about dipping sauces(dipping sauces are the cornerstone of any good fast food meal). I ask for their Cajun sauce(which is vegan too, if you care). The lady at the window is nice and my drink gets to me quickly and my food shortly after(like 3 minutes) and is brought to me by another employee. *shrug*. I drive off and take a sip of my mango tea. Continue reading if you care about the actual food because this is why this place only gets 3 stars. 

I got my single burger with ""cheese"" and first of all, I've never had faux cheese before and it was ok. It was a weird consistency. It made the inside of the top bun a weird mushy, stick to the roof of your mouth texture. The overall taste of the burger was fine and I actually liked it. They put some sauce on the burger similar to an In-N-out style sauce. Overall an okay veggie burger that I would eat again sans the cheese. Temperature was fine and seasoning good. The fries were a huge let down. I wanted to cry when I saw them because they just looked sad AF. Like greasy, limp sad potatoes. Some were undercooked and some were sort of crunchy, but the majority were just unimpressive and underwhelming. The only redeeming part was the Cajun sauce I got and you best believe I dipped every fry bite in that sauce to stop the sadness from taking over. Sauce was really good and really spicy. Yum! Mango tea was too sweet but enjoyable once watered down. 

I want to return but only to try their shakes. Other than that, I think this place is a pass in the future for me if I'm looking for a satisfying food experience. My total was almost $11. Kind of pricey for the letdown.",hqr0F0tU7CFCISxfEpuk1Q,6,2,3,-V-7cdd5NdGObsyoxXPtDw

The bad,  under high expectations- the vegan burger patty. I didn't expect for it to taste like meat but I feel like the whole burger was soggy and just not for me ( or my husband).ok Vegan or not, a patty in a burger should be solid and hold up well with the rest of the burger. I've been to Veggie House and was beyond pleased with both food and service. I expected the same here because chef Kenny initially opened this location.

To begin with, the dining room leaves a lot to be desired. You've got your standard tables and chairs that leaves a certain air of sadness. Along with that, you've got hateful posters looking down at people who eat meat. Not really a way to win over a non-vegan crowd. 

The food was subpar at best. I ordered their Hawaiian burger and let me tell you, it tasted mostly like sauce and pineapples. I couldn't taste anything else. Not even the tasteless patty. 

Their strawberry milkshake wasn't terrible, but it's not something I would order again, but their curly fries were good. I doubt they make them in-house. If they do, at least they got at least one thing going for them.

Food is good but overpriced. Came here a few times when they first opened and then again today. Location decor has changed and does look a lot nicer than before. Apparently Chief Kenny does not own this location anymore, his partner took over.

His partner changed the menu and today they had no chicken anything. Cheese use to come on the burger now there is a charge for it and sides of sauce.

4676307,2017-03-18,1,KDdu9HDswaJYExaGDuzRjQ,"I have been wanting to try it since I read about the first one opening and really wanted to love this place.  In general I don't go for ""fast food"" because I prefer a more healthy lifestyle without a lot of fried and processed foods.  The misnomer is that this was going to be a healthy alternative and the vegan alternative to fast food.

We ordered a Cajun chicken, fish sandwich, popcorn chicken, and potato fries.  All of the items were extremely greasy like they were cooked from a tempered state, so much so that I had that greasy taste in my mouth and needed to get something after to eat after to cover it.

The chicken patty was really just a regular processed chicken patty and nothing special.  The fish sandwich was interesting with guacamole instead of tarter sauce, and the fish flavor was not bad, but was hard to eat without making a huge mess.  Everything is served on white buns - which I would have expected multi grain or wheat.  Fries and popcorn chicken were both very very greasy, although the chicken flavor was ok. 

Thankfully I asked about the shakes before ordering as they are made from almond milk (which was not noted) which would not have ended well had I ordered one.  

While service was friendly the place lacked finishing.  They used bulk ketchup which was almost empty and no plastic cups to dispense into.  Items in the beverage machine were already out of order and were definitely very basic selections. I did like the crushed ice, though!  The whole condiment / beverage station just lacked organization, completeness, and cohesiveness.

Overall, I felt embarrassed to have brought my carnivore friend thinking this would be a healthy alternative and fun new place to try.  I really wanted to say give me a carrot stick or broccoli floret in tempura at least so I could feel redeemed.  Even big fast food is trying to be more healthy and offer different options

Maybe it was an off night for them but unfortunately I would not return or suggest my vegan/vegetarian friends try it.",MH9WjTAwXbd3S89fivtoDA,2,1,2,AxOBxiYlFx0qIIRydabLRQ

Ugh.. it's become a hit or miss place. 
I'm currently eating a chicken wrap with extremely crunchy rice, the only avo spread is at one end (figured they forgot it again) and they didn't put those really yummy red sweet/spicy pepper things which is literally my favorite thing about the wrap 

Why am I paying almost ten bucks for one wrap that's completely half as.ed ?? 

The last time my wrap was made with the same lack of care and I figured whoever made it was having a bad day, but now again  


As someone else stated, I to have spent over 15 minutes in the drive thru with one lady in front of me. Apparently they gave her food to the wrong customer and instead of being able to handle the situation (how about you say sorry, have her Park, and bring her food out to her when it's ready.. what a concept?) No. we sat there for 15 minutes, my boyfriend got out walked across the street and got food somewhere else, came back, still stuck, I waited five more minutes and got out to see what was going on and why I wasn't being let out. 

I literally told the employee at the window that she should probably consider compensating the customer, having her pull up, and let the rest of us go, seeing that there shouldn't be a problem with our orders.. right ?? No we still sat there for ten more minutes. Absolutely ridiculous 

I'm the GM at one of the greens and protiens and I would never let a situation like this happen. Management really needs to step it up. What's the time you guys are aiming for? 5-10mins? How's the quality supposed to stay consistent? Check the training of your employees.

I arrived around 4pm on a Sunday and stood at the counter for a few minutes before a young man came out to greet me. As I started asking questions he interrupted me by listing off ALL the things they were out of. Burgers, ""chicken"" and pretty much everything I was interested in trying. He then told me their other location on Jones would have a better selection... seriously?!
I settled on a southwest burrito. While I waited I heard the female cook yell, ""No! Why did you do that?!"" Not a good sign in my book.
It was $9 and I took four or five bites. It was mushy and didn't taste fresh at all. So much for that! I won't be back to this location. I'll have to think about trying the other one.",WwoM6hQbgPnzcX3taqK-xQ,1,0,1,Jew3BxQ5it9q1wQMcJqxVw
5278280,2017-01-19,7,KDdu9HDswaJYExaGDuzRjQ,"Chef Kenny, responsible for operating Veggie House, has opened a second Vegeway location in northwest Vegas, and I couldn't be happier. Vegeway has been called the vegan equivalent of In-N-Out, and I'd have to agree with this description. Equipped with a drive-thru and offering vegan burgers, fries, and 'milk' shakes, it's a vegan fat girl's heaven. I went to Vegeway on opening day because I couldn't wait to try Chef Kenny's take on American fast food. 

VEGAN BURGER ($4.69): Comes with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and thousand island dressing. The burger is really good. I've no idea what the burger is made of or how they get it to look like a 'real' hamburger patty. It's something you have to see and try for yourself! 4/5

POPCORN CHICKEN ($4.69): I only had a few bites because I was too full to eat any more, but these were quite good, especially when dipped in the vegan ranch! 4/5

FRIES ($2.59): I ordered the curly fries and sweet potato fries, favoring the former. Generous portions. 3.5/5

SERVICE: I went through the drive-thru and waited about 10 minutes for my order. No one expects opening day to be perfect, so I was cool about it when the cashier got my order right on the third try. 

I'm excited to have a vegan restaurant close to home and will definitely be back for more.

How it went wrong today: when the guy opened the drive through window I heard a loud sneeze and saw the chef wipe his nose on his hand. He grabbed I assume a veggie patty from underneath with his bare hands ( NO GLOVES) and put it on the grill. Also wearing no gloves while putting on the toppings. I open the box in the car as I pulled away, the bun was not grilled or toasted like it was last time, very sloppily put together, the lettuce changed to some dark green wilted stuff, the onion smelt bad and looked old, and where was the cheese?? I felt like I was eating food for a dog. This was disgusting and it's really unfortunate because it was excellent the first couple of times.",G5aqrt4Mt-xqQXOwA0Uyxg,1,0,1,ytwnDfvlQeRhDzima2gPdA

As mentioned in other reviews, their menu does not have that many choices, but I personally like that it is simple. As a person that is just starting to eat more vegan food, I like that I am not overwhelmed by so many different options. Their prices are reasonable and I didn't have to wait long for my food to come out. Restaurant is fairly clean and organized, and their employees are friendly. 

I ordered the vegan beef sandwich and my sister ordered a chicken ranch burger. The vegan beef sandwich was a little bit too spicy for me, there is some kind of chili sauce and jalapeños in the sandwich - I'll probably ask for no jalapeños next time. But overall, their foods are flavorful and the portions are just right. Will definitely be back soon!",didQq47ggh7iAxd5_wkuQQ,1,0,4,cwFNWM-vQgCCXxnKkXm3Tw

If I didn't already have expectations from the last location I probably wouldn't have had anything to complain about but I was just a bit disappointed to see how different it was.

5728772,2017-09-21,0,KDdu9HDswaJYExaGDuzRjQ,"Seriously this spot used to be good and the last two times I've gone it's been miserable.  The first horrible time they didn't have like 80% of the menu and I had only found out after I paid and ordered because the cashier was ill informed on inventory. And then they took away 2 of the better things they offered (curly fries and popcorn chicken), although replacing the popcorn chicken with seitan nuggets.  I literally cannot tell you the last time I returned something at a restaurant, and these were just that gross that I had to.  They looked nothing like the picture they advertised and tasted like burnt flour in dirty fryer oil.  And while I returned them I had waited at least 5 minutes before the employees had finished gossiping to notice me standing at the counter to help me out.  Granted they were nice and let me get something else.  Ugh get it together.  On top of that, two big dead bugs just chillin in the bathroom that had no toilet paper... not the greatest experience.  And there was horrible loud music playin.. simple plan? My chemical romance? Some emo stuff playing just too loud to hear your thoughts, or someone standing in front of the register for 5 minutes for that matter ;)

The drive thru takes a little bit, but for freshly made plant based food, I'll wait. They have anything that you can imagine from a fast food place without worrying about animal products or dairy being used. 

Their burgers taste like a real burger to me and are yummy!  

One thing, they use daiya cheese. I'm not a fan of it but sometimes I get the cheese there. That's just me, I can't stand daiya, I'm all for Follow Your Heart cheese products. 

Best things on the menu I've had are the zuchinni fries/sticks and their sweet potatoes fries, yes please!

I am not the only person who has complained about this location always being out of food items on the menu.  They never have much of anything, the Jones location said they aren't even technically vege way anymore.  It's a let down because some of the food items I used to love there are no longer the same in taste.  The only thing consistent about this Restuarant is it's inconsistency .  I am no longer amused and will take my vegan business elsewhere.  It's a shame because there aren't that many choices for vegan food up in the centinial area.
