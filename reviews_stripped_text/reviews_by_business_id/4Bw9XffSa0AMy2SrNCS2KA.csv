1054,2010-06-02,0,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"Sababa has moved up to five star status- strictly based on their falafel.  Let me be perfectly clear, I have never had anything else here.  However, this is the best falafel in Vegas- and I have tried many.  The falafel and hummus comes in a pita pocket filled with tahini, tomatoes, pickles, cabbage, cucumbers, and lettuce.  They have an incredible green parsley hot sauce (crazy hot!) and their falafel is moist all the way through (not dry in the center like many others).  The falafels are fried to order and the sandwich is made in front of you.  Still wish they had fresh brewed iced tea, but I usually get takeout anyway.  This place is Israeli owned and about as authentic as it gets.",dEgO4_n8thLMbG1dKfFMHg,2,1,5,VQR9u5gWigPQqttg12zo-A

ETA: I think there has been a change in ownership or management. Went back not too long ago and was seriously disappointed. Prices are higher and food does not taste as good.",IMp6bc7PwIeU0X2lTMRAgA,0,0,4,K_eHhd22YhaEC86APudTTQ
192682,2014-06-09,0,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"I stumbled on this out of the way place on my way to Red Rock Canyon.  What a delight. Without a doubt the best falafel sandwich I have had in years. And I am a native New Yorker who knows good falafel.  The pita pockets are unique -- spongy, fluffy and light -- and seem to just melt into the sandwich.  The falafel is fresh and just the right consistency -- not too crispy or dry.  And they will stuff the sandwich with your choice of fresh condiments.  All for $6.99, drink included.  Friendly and helpful staff just add to the fine experience. My advice is to make the effort to get to Sababa.  You won't be disappointed.",8N3Oq9AJYHsrEO9AHdmTxQ,0,0,5,c-eQKzqKZHEWpkBwxbEZ2Q
197213,2011-01-02,0,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"For the past several times that I've been coming to Vegas and to the Vons Shopping Center (not certain of the name) I've noticed Sababa. Actually, I never knew it was called Sababa since what really jumped out at me was the Falafel + Pita + Soda deal for $6.95. I've always had a penchant for Middle Eastern food and kept hoping we'd stop by one day since we always go to Easy Life, which is located in the same plaza.

So during this past trip, I really had a hankering for something Middle Eastern and kept hounding my sister about it. We were supposed to go to Zaytoon, a Persian eatery/market but the name and location eluded me at the moment so we came here instead. I had entered the restaurant with the aforementioned deal on my mind but once I was inside and glanced upwards at the menu I had no idea what I wanted. The owner who is Israeli and definitely loud and proud about his restaurant immediately asked if we've been here before and we told him ""no"". He then gave my sister and me a falafel ball topped with a dollop of houmos to try out exclaiming that it was the best in the world. I've never particularly liked falafel since it's a vegetarian item and I need my meat but I'll admit it helped whet my appetite! 

We ended up ordering the Sababa Special, which the establishment touts as the ""Ultimate Pu Pu Platter."" For $17.95, it came with falafel, houmos, kababs, pita bread, shawarma, and salad. It was alright and the portion seemed small at first, but I got full off it even though I had to share with my sister. We also ordered a four piece appetizer thing that came with some bourekas and other stuff. I would have liked the houmos to have been less salty and the shawarma to have been beef (they don't have lamb here) rather than chicken. 

The service was also pretty good since the workers were pretty attentive. This place is like a hybrid of sorts since it's not entirely fast food but it's also not exactly a sit-down establishment either. You need to order at the counter but you have the option of paying upfront or after you finish eating and must pay at the counter regardless. They bring the food to you and they come to you to ask if you need drink refills but there are no designated servers.",e7YqL66GjjTnKH3r0Na9IA,0,0,3,Ns71E5oqxVqCRjQiI8XzPg
203070,2013-11-20,0,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"Sababa has pretty much beaten out all the other Kosher eateries out there in Vegas. And theres's a reason why...the food is fresh and delicious! It is a clean eatery, with the salad bar protected by a panel of glass and the schwarma grill on display so you know exactly what your food will look like and how it's handled. 

The portions are good for the price you pay and the service is accommodating. It is worth the 20 mile drive my husband and I make out once in a while when we know we want a good Israeli dish. My personal favorite: Beef steak plate  ($22)....very juicy and well marinated in my opinion!! 

The reason I give it 4 stars is because the food and beverages are very pricey.",YiArof1zbk6Urh4Nv6jEGQ,1,1,4,dRHEpZQ_IiyhTxZghUeP-Q
208522,2014-03-07,2,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"When my girlfriend and I first walked in, there was nobody behind the counter, but three people were sitting at tables. One was (I assume) a customer, though he had no food. The other two people were employees. After about 20 seconds of wondering what to do and a few weird looks from them, one of them stood up and went behind the counter to help us.

As we decided on our selections, the guy behind the counter gave us two pieces of falafel to try with the hummus. It was delicious! It was also the only positive thing about this experience.

We decided to try the falafel sandwich meal that is advertised on the outside of the building. The man behind the counter grabs two pitas and slices them with a blade. He then tucks it in nicely to make a pocket for the ingredients, all of this with his BARE HANDS. My girlfriend and I looked at each other with the same realization: he never washed them from sitting at the table in the lobby on his cell phone. When I asked for hummus in my sandwich, he rudely stated that it came with it. Okay, not a great first impression. But maybe he was having a bad day, I thought. He proceeded to add ingredients to my sandwich that I did not want, and he did not ask me, though he did ask my girlfriend. Weird. He then literally threw our sandwiches in a bag, slammed the bag on the counter in front of us, gave us two drinks, and gave me the total. About $17. 

While hesitant at the thought of his unwashed hands making our sandwiches, I asked if he took American Express because it wasn't on the list of accepted cards near the register. He gave me a loud, rude ""yes"" right in my face that actually took me aback. He then flicked my card on the counter and threw the pen for me to sign. I don't know what was going on, but it was very weird, angry, unwelcoming vibes coming from that place. Never again.",xAGAy6XHcRjkDz_dQKkguA,2,0,1,Tj1DGt588r1Pngks4j0PAw

When I went in, an employee greeted me and suggested I try the falafel/salad plate.  Fine, I thought - I love them both!  However, when he rang up my order, it was $11.00!!!  For lunch - 5 small falafel balls sitting in hummus, and some salad --- for lunch, no less!  I was expecting to pay around $7-8 for a lunch plate.   So, it was very over-priced for the quantity of food.  If falafel is this expensive, then how much would their meat dishes be????  Anyway, when I got back home, I ate the food.  The falafel was very salty, and tasted like it was fried in old oil.  The hummus was just ok.  The salad was very good - but overall, the place is WAY overpriced for the quantity and quality of food.

Recently however, I finally convinced my family to come along with me to try their amazing food. The sign on their door shows business hours until 3pm on Friday. We stopped by at 2:45pm and found the door locked. Someone let us in and there were quite a few people inside. My wife and her mother spent a few minutes looking at the menu (because they've never been there) and when we asked if we could order, the employee behind the register told us ""That's why I'm standing here. The sooner, the better"". I was a little surprised at the poor attitude, but determined to have a nice lunch. Then we're told there were no more falafels, and there wouldn't be any fries for my toddler's kid's meal because the fryer was already off. With the limited menu and the poor attitude, we decided to leave and go somewhere else since it was obvious they didn't want our business. As we drove away I told my wife it was too bad because the food is great there. My wife told me too bad because she will never go back there.

The place is clean, the lighting is good, and the overall ambiance is nice - a lot of restaurants have annoying music playing in the background, but I like the music that they play at Sababa, and it's always quiet enough that it never disturbs my meal.

Polite and efficient waitstaff. They have forgotten bits of my orders before (like a side or my friend's hot tea order), but they're always quick and courteous about correcting it as soon as I mention the mistake.

I have lots of praise and no complaints whatsoever about the food. I LOVE their beef plate and always get that rich, creamy hummus with their delicate little fries (which are fun to dip in the hummus) for my two sides. Very satisfying.

Since I'm not going to take hours to put together something so yummy at home, I don't mind paying a bit extra when I feel like a special yet casual lunch.",Uw-v0UN_g_oFvldC7HWXMg,1,1,4,5DxjWM2vzwjZo14UyCwCtg

It is a Kosher Mediterrannean restaurant.  They are observant, hence the seperate sinks for washing your hands before you eat.  It is not required, but one should be courteous.  Nuff said.

The food.  I was impressed.  The falafel was pretty good.  (Nothing will top Mamouns in NYC in my opinion, but this ran a very close second).  The schwarma was deleicious.  Warm, juicy, and fresh.  Just go ahead and get it with all the toppings.  You won't regret it.

Bourekas were ok, again, not the greatest, but I think that was because I was set on having the mushroom ones and all they had left was sesame (it was about 8:30 on a saturday, I believe they close at 9).  

All and all, it was good.  I would definitely go back.  I'm glad to see food like this showing up in the Valley.  Definitely makes me a little less homesick, for sure.",LPl-y9MbUhi5oI274wzjSg,2,0,4,5RRwdRa4ZXiVM5PfhzmvFw

Ordered takeout, staff was friendly, chatty, and quick.
Shwarma combo plate with salad, hommos, and falafel ($15) was two meals, and priced well when you consider that adding on the falafel is only a dollar more for 5 pieces- a la carte pricing is 2/$1. Falafel plate with hommos and salad ($10) is also an ample portion, and each plate comes with their own fresh, warm pita.

Shwarma is turkey, per the menu notes, but sliced and grilled fresh with good flavor. Falafel is crisp, hommos is creamy and topped with olive oil and parsley, and the salad is legit: fresh lettuce and cabbage, topped with tiny-chopped tomato, onion, and cucumber, and doused with a good amount of tahini dressing.There's no feta, but that probably carries over from the kosher dishes. I added some myself at home for extra oomph!

They also have burekas- small square pastries stuffed with potato, spinach, or mushroom; the latter is my favorite, highly recommend.

Side tangent: Not sure why this place hypes up falafel as healthy. As others have said, although it's vegetarian, it IS fried so calling it healthy is a bit of a stretch.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,2,3,xeTAXAFLvih0RAf6FkxH-Q

I decided to order a chicken kabab which came in a very delicious soft pita, filled with moist chicken, houmos, tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbage and tahini sauce. It was fresh and very filling.

I was in Vegas for my fiance's 25th birthday with a couple of her friends, and we stopped at this place on our way back to Phoenix.  They gave us a couple of samples of falafel for free; i usually do not like falafel but these were small and crispy with a tender inside - best falafel i have had in the states.

For entree, I had the Shwarma - salad- hummus plate, which came with a pita ($15).  The portion size was pretty damn big and the price was reasonable considering that its Kosher and a  big portion.  The Schwarma was good, the hummus was great, the salad was nice since I got to choose what ingredients I wanted.  I really enjoyed my meal.

However, what my fiance ordered is really what makes this spot 5*.  She got the beef ""kabob"" with fries and salad ($22).  While it sounds expensive, this ""kabob"" was kosher rib eye steak (the best kosher steak, period) marinated and grilled to perfection.  The owner asked me how the steak was and when I said it was great, he noted that ""those kabobs are how I made my business.""  I see why.   My grandpa is a kosher butcher in Detroit and I have had many many kosher steaks in my life, but this one had the best flavor of all.  Again, a large portion - if I had to guess, id say it was around 12-14 oz of meat.  The fries were also delicious.    I strongly suggest that you order this if you come to this place.  While 22$ seems like a lot, remember that kosher rib eye sells for about 18$/pound at a supermarket.

For dessert, they brought my fiance a piece of baklava with a candle in it for free (i told them when i ordered that it was her bday), which was a nice surprise.",mHfwu2pMsckH7385nvlKmg,2,0,5,YGlcH_JFDBDeDaalgLm6Rw

1)Falafel plate: 9.99- Large side of hummus, and babaganoush 
-BABAganoush was creamy and amazing. The falafel was not crispy and was quite squishy on the inside (not what im used to)- good flavor but still not crispy (idk why people are raving about it), Hummus was very thick (i prefer more creamy with more tahini) 
2)Chicken rotti shawarma- 14.99$- Large portion of chicken and rice with side of french fries
- A LOT OF chicken and rice- according to my husband who ate it (i dont eat chicken)- he said the chicken wasnt flavorful and was quite dry)- hefty portion of french fries
Boreka 1.99- Potato pastry (bland and kinda tasteless) 

They were out of: Moroccan cigars, Kubbeh meat, and ground beef kabobs (which is all the things I wanted to try)

They definitely need to change many things, and don't ask for extra anything aka pita bread because they already give you one when you get a plate.

2848679,2015-11-11,1,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"Best Falafel in Las Vegas.

Sababa changed owners about the time that we arrived in Vegas direct from Jerusalem. In case you didn't know, btw, Jerusalem is THE ONLY place to have falafel the way it should be. Actually, not just anywhere in Jerusalem, but a select few places. More like 3 places in the Old City (Muslim Quarter) and 1 place in the Mahane Yehuda Shuk. Nowhere else. But I digress ...

So, Sababa's new owner, Chef Effie, is a native Jerusalemite (we call that Yerushalmi back Home). His falafel is the only falafel that I've eaten in this country (between San Francisco/Bay Area, Los Angeles/area, and New York City/area) that comes even close to being done right. And my picky 2 year old half-Israeli, half-Palestinian son will eat it nowhere else in the entire US of A. 

The hummus is also decent and it's fantastic to see it with ground beef (hummus ma lahmay in Arabic) and other Jerusalemite toppings. 

He has real laffa (laffa is originally Iraqi but now essentially a Jerusalem thing as far as anyone is concerned - it's like a pillowy lavosh) and pita from Angel Bakery. Now, I would've chosen  to collaborate with a local bakery rather than ship it in frozen, but hey, it's kosher and that's probably the main downfall in all of this for me ... although the new mashgiah  (kashrut/kosher supervisor) is super nice. 

Sababa also has pargit! Yay me! That is pretty much a chicken kabob type of thing that you put in a pita or laffa. 

There's chicken shnitzel to please the Ashkenazi palate, and malawach (like a paratha bread) and jahnun (malawach rolled up essentially - both are Yemenite specialties) on Sundays. 

There's a new kids menu, too, that'll even please American kids. Not mine, though. He can't get enough falafel (did I mention he loves the falafel, enough?).

Btw, special mention to the fact that there's Sprite Zero in the fountain drink selection! 

The two downfalls for me here are this: 1) I keep on losing the punch cards. I probably have 10-20 of them between my whole household that are hiding in some black hole somewhere. Maybe this could be done digitally by either phone number or email? Freebie from my consulting gig right there. Woops. 2) Train the staff on what the food needs to taste like and how to be slightly friendlier. They don't know how to quality check and the chef/owner can't be everywhere at once. 3) (Yeah, I said two, but oh well) It's kosher. Which means prices go up to pay the mafia - er, Kashrut certification agency, and it's closed on Saturdays. 

Still gets 5 stars in my book .. because, well, FALAFEL. Got it?",CbLusGsbKTaiJrKygkRAtg,3,1,5,yNS6ZY5pkafpv-9pWDBhoQ

Once we walked in, we were greeted by a booming voice and a friendly smile from the guy behind the counter, and a wave from a little man, furiously wiping the table of a foursome just leaving.  The behind-the-counter dude looked at us, instantly knowing we had never been to his resto before.  ""I have the best falafals in the city, my friend"" he told my man, as he handed him the perfect piece of falafal -- crunchy on the outside, but a moist inside with the perfect blend of spices.  Sababa's hummus is also a treat -- nice consistency, and not too tangy.  Yum. Sababa was a great find (once you get passed the yellow flags) on a side of town I don't frequent often.

If I had to guess, he's probably Israeli, and these people have an abrupt way about them -fine, no prob.
I eventually just told them what I was looking for, and they suggested some sort of chicken plate.  I also had a snapple, and given this is basically a falafel stand, I was pretty surprised to be charged $22 for what I had ordered.   Given the food was mediocre AT BEST, and given it was served in a foam container in a fast food enviroment, I was dissapointed on the value front.  I've had WAY better middle eastern food at a fraction of the cost whether it be Lebanese, Persion or Afgan..
Anyway, the part that really ruined the meal for me what fact that the other very kind (non-middle eastern) gentlemen who served me actually handled my pita with his bare hands, and he had two old, worn dirty band-aids on each of his thumbs which certainly came in contact wtih my food.  Absolutely disgusting, and totally lacking in any sort of basic food-service hygene.  
The original guy was so annoying I didn't even bother bringing up the issue, I just tossed the pita bread in the trash when I got home and wondered how much food this guy touches with his dirty band-aid hands.

Seriously though, the food was delicious. I rocked the shawarma houmos salad plate, which is pretty self-explanatory. The shawarma was spiced, moist and had that crust that I love. Note: it's turkey meat. The houmos was also excellent. The kind of 'mos that you end up dipping everything in. 

The place itself has about a dozen tables and looks like every other take out joint in town. There's a TV on the wall if you are rolling solo.

I have only one critique, but it is a notable one.

When you come into the restaurant, unless money is no object, order directly from the menu.

If you come in with 4 or more people, a lot of times the (very nice) staff will offer to just make you a dinner for 4 with a little of everything. They are so nice, and it sounds like a good way to decide what to eat.

The problem is two-fold. One, you many times are still a little hungry and there isn't much to take home. And two, when they give you the bill for your little ""dinner for 4"" you will pass out from the price.

Unfortunately we had this happen 3 times with parties of 4 to 9 people before we learned our lesson. And they tend to get a little hostile when you object.

The food is extremely fresh and wonderfully flavorful. Rami is a gracious host and clearly has a passion for his food. I had a family style lunch with 4 people in which Rami brought a salad, falafel, hummus, pita, chicken, steak and 2 sodas. 

Lunch was beyond good...so much so I tried to eat the plate. Now I will say the meal was pricey $23/person but the fact that Sababa is Glatt Kosher (glatt technically means the lungs of the kosher and kosher-slaughtered animal were smooth) which might account for the higher than average cost.

One thing I will say the food is nothing in the range of average it is absolutely divine :) I highly recommend eating here.",gDy6k3AqlkcN4cEIkWnx_A,5,3,5,oFoADda7p3m8T73dmzeZrw
3969034,2015-07-12,1,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"I'm actually still upset.

When I first got to Las Vegas, I found this restaurant & was happily shocked as to how authentic the food was on my first visit. I know good Israeli food, plus I'm a foodie.

The second visit it wasn't as good, so I didn't go back, plus it is really expensive.

Fast forward to last Thursday & I decided to treat myself & hope that the third time was going to be as great as the first time. I also decided to take a friend there who isn't Jewish & has never had Israeli food.

At first I was like, ""oh no"" when I saw they were under New Management, but I held out hope.

I was SHOCKED at how bad the food was. I ordered a split plate of the eggplant & Matbucha salad. The eggplant had no flavor & while the Matbucha was slightly better, it was just spicy, it had no real flavor. I've had Matbucha numerous times in my life, so this isn't a first for me.

Their Moroccan cigars also didn't have that cigar taste I love & all I tasted was spice.

Their humous wasn't as good as the other owner's & I REALLY loved their humous, & my chicken pita sandwich was bland & the chicken didn't look to be cooked thoroughly.

The free pita chips were so hard & tasteless I took one bite & put it down.

Even the second visit when the old owner was there was better than this experience.

I didn't pay attention to the subpar customer service because the food was more important to me & Israelis aren't known for their customer service.

The restaurant was empty except for one other person. We came at around 2 pm, but still, if the food is fabulous, it should be fairly busy at 2 pm.

I guess I won't be going there ever again :  (",0LHevpOrufWaU8pBiTc4gQ,2,0,1,_Xz6UMhU5sM_ecuyLaNnBw

Its Kosher, so no milk products of any kind, but some cool Israeli soda drinks available and the made-to-order falafel is awesome, hummus heavenly and pita is really, really light and delish!!

It is a Kosher restaurant so the hours are not what we are used to in our normal daily Vegas, however the food is worth the wait and the drive.  Kosher is a BIG meaning and covers a lot of knowledge. I will not begin to explain but a bit of reading on the subject wouldn't hurt.

The food here is amazing, I remember asking my Man if we could drive the 30 minutes to go get the ""Shawarma"" no go.  So when we moved in this direction and I found it again it has kinda become my cheat day, not that is is bad for you but OH So Good!  I believe the Shawarma combo is the best for me I love the long roasted meat shaved into your sandwich.  I also really love the falafels buy a couple for 50cent a piece with a bit of Tahini, amazing fried goodness!  

The service is not really quick everything takes a bit to cook (because it is Kosher) and the prices are bit high, but most really great places like this are and there is a reason.  The reasons are prep, time, seasons and accountability.  I feel the safest place to eat in the world is here because they take it so serious.  

So the portions are huge that makes up for the price, the price isn't bad I thought... The meat is moist and delicious and plenty of sauce and veggies to make it all rhyme.  ask for the hot sauce but if you are weary about it ask for it on the side I ask for it lightly and I like heat if that says anything!

The staff was friendly and downright jovial, and the facilities were clean and pleasant.

4484607,2015-06-02,2,4Bw9XffSa0AMy2SrNCS2KA,"We were hosting some family from Israel who were taking us out for dinner, but it had to be Kosher.  I chose Sababa after reading some Yelp reviews, and it looked like it would fit the bill.

The positives:  Good service, along with a bit of sarcastic New York Jewish Waiter-style joking from one of the waiters, who was neither from NY nor old enough to be one or even remember what they were like.  

Also positive:  Good food.  The two husbands ordered the Sababa Special platter, which included 5 small falafel, some beef kebab, chicken, rice, and a side salad.  I claimed one of Herb's falafel as my own, and thought it was close the best I've ever had. We wifeys had the Chicken Shawarma plate.  I'm used to shawarma being turkey, but it's chicken here, and it was very tasty.  We got less salad, served on the plate.

The negatives:  There is no atmosphere whatsoever.  It's set up the same way as a deli, with a long, high counter on one side, behind which the food is prepared, tables on the other side, and 4"" tiles on the walls.

No wine or beer, though I suppose you can BYO.  But the bright lights aren't conducive to a wine-fueled romantic dinner.  Fountain drinks are included with the platters.  I never drink soda, but I did here.

It's pricey, but that's the downside of eating at a Kosher restaurant, and was to be expected.  My chicken platter was, I think, 14.99.  While not outrageous, for that amount I can have dinner at the Kebab House and take home enough food for a whole 'nother dinner.  

If you have to go Kosher, Sababa fits the bill.  If you don't, food that's as good or better - with much nicer atmosphere, might be a wiser choice.  Unless YOU think you look good under fluorescent light.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,6,2,3,3cibOHu5KpPWhCnnBXcMww

A friend and I visited this place in hopes of trying some good food we've never had before.  We're open to try just about anything.  Unfortunately during our visit, we were never really given the chance to try their food.  Upon entering we see a menu with lots of food items that we had never been introduced to at that time.  We let people go ahead of us in line to give ourselves a chance to scan the menu for things we wanted to try.  After a making our decisions we stepped forward and placed our orders.  

At least, we think we did.  We looked at one of the workers in the eyes and told him what we wanted, and he acknowledged us; maybe not the food we ordered, but he acknowledged the fact that we were talking to him.  My friend and I shrug and continue moving forward in the line and get ready to pay.  Now for some reason, we became completely invisible to the employees.  We tried to see how much our meal was, tell them what we ordered, etc.  We were flat out ignored while the people in front of and behind us continued with their business, ordering food and then paying for it.  The two of us stood around confused and tried to get someone's attention to confirm that our order had been placed.  No such luck.  

After getting frustrated with the customer service, a customer comes up to my friend and asks if his drink contains milk (we had stopped by It's A Grind and he had a frozen coffee drink).  We confirmed that milk was an ingredient, and the customer asked us to leave and finish the drink outside due to the restaurant being a kosher establishment.

Having spent the time waiting in line, ordering, waiting to pay, being completely ignored and then being asked to leave by another customer, my friend and I left out of frustration.

There was one woman eating on a table and there was just one guy running the place (at least that was visible) and he was in front of the counter.

He was a nice guy and gave us each a sample falafel to try.  It was good and we ordered our food.  The food was mediocre and I was really surprised to see that my part of the bill was $17!

I found the place to be overpriced and a little on the bland side.  It made me a little nervous that there was only one guy there and he was taking orders, preparing the food AND handling cash.  I just got a weird vibe from the place in general.",uWXAiy960wdZY7ED7NU3Cw,4,1,2,eD6vvgpfhO3ktzelEmYiPw

Despite the forecasted price tag, we went, and on our first trip, he encouraged us to share a sampler platter. Well, actually he wanted us to get 2 platters, and 2 came to our table even though we only wanted 1. The whole ordeal was a little uncomfortable and overshadowed the food. Honestly, we left feeling like we had simply eaten the most expensive falafel in the world, and we didn't return for quite some time.

However, they have recently been advertising a $6.99 falafel pita and soda special, and being a a falafal fanatic, I was open for a return visit. The assertive owner was still there, but he was more concerned with another table of guests. He is simply a very proud man, I think, which seems to result in quality offerings, but I could see where he might overpower timid peeps. Chat with him about the food, though, and you will see he is passionate.

On to the food: pickles for your pita!! I always celebrate this little delight, as I think that pickles and falafel are as smart a combo as Wonder Woman and her invisible plane. They have a plentiful topping bar and some hot sauce that will kick your tASStesbuds. Seriously, it's hot. Those accoutrement earn bonus stars, as does the fluffy, soft pita. Additional bonus for the million falafel they stuff into that pita! Okay, so maybe it is not a million, but it was at least 6, which is generous in the land of pockets.

The falafel themselves taste good, but I was surprised that there were no visible spices. I am used to seeing bright green parsley or other spices, but these were a uniform golden color throughout. They were still tasty, and with the pita special running, they are no longer the most expensive falafel in the world. They are now a must try in Vegas! It is all about the special.

Hummus with Shawarma - Chicken Rotti, Parsley and Tahini with Pita and Pickles
Falafel Pita - Chickpea Fritters, Pickles, Tahini, Hummus, Mediterranean Salad

Located within walking distance of home it was largely a matter of conflicting schedules that had prevented a visit to Sababa Mediterranean Grill in the past, ownership's observance of Shabbat seeing the space on the corner of Durango and Desert Inn closed from Friday at 3pm until Sunday at eleven o'clock, a relatively light schedule on this particular Friday creating an opportunity to visit a space that has apparently changed ownership several times over the course of its ten year existence.

Presumably a family run space not dissimilar to the likes of Amena and other Mediterranean spots in town, the strong smell of disinfectant prevalent on entry just past 11:30am with no other patrons present and a man who spoke to colleagues in his native tongue seated watching television, it was with curt ""hello, what can I get you"" that he stood and returned to the counter when a digital menu paraded options slowly, a laminated card with several items crossed off in Sharpie later provided to help better clarify the choices.

Said to be a 100% Kosher space, a warning on the window about bringing in outside food and beverages stressing this while the man in charge also abruptly asked ""why you take pictures?"" like such a thing were not commonplace or as  if he had something to hide, it was with culturally appropriate music playing and Roku idle screens on television that a three part order was placed, the Pita taken from a Styrofoam cooler and briefly warmed before being placed in foil and presented to the table alongside Babaganoush that was thin yet fragrant with Garlic and Herbs plus plenty of Lemon Juice.

Not particularly in love with the Pita Bread, no evidence of it being homemade in terms of the presentation or fluffiness, it was with another round presented similar to the last that the man brought forth an enormous plate of Hummus topped in marinated Chicken cooked for several minutes on the flattop and drizzled with Tahini, the Bird itself juicy and lean with the plenty of Cumin and Garlic flavor while the Hummus was thick and creamy with enough there to share amongst a party of two or more.

Enjoying two plates of Pickles with the Shawarma, though an unexpected segment of Lemon amidst Carrots and Cabbage was a bit assaulting in one bite, it was with the tab paid and a Sandwich taken for later that the man softened his comment on photographs stating he saw someone else doing it the day prior and wondered why, the sloppy presentation of a Falafel Pita perhaps one reason he may not want people Instagramming his food though the Chickpea Fritters were quite flavorful and relatively low in heft compared to most which prevented them from overwhelming the Lettuce, Tomatoes, Pickles, Dressing and Cucumbers.

THREE STARS:  Although hospitality could use a little work and cleaning of windows should probably be relegated to the hours between closing on Friday and sundown, Sababa provides good value on the dollar in an ever competitive Mediterranean market, the fact that the restaurant keeps 100% Kosher likely of relevance to many as well.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,3,COYGZ-PMC0PonAKokpJSbA
