I've been here 4 times in 2 weeks. And each time it's been fantastic!

Crabs are cooked then tossed in a dry spice. Perfect!

Service is very friendly, and they always take time to explain how to eat the crabs. They also use iphones to take orders, so it's not like they are ignoring you. 

I like the casual vibe of the place. Brown paper is put on the table, wooden mallets are handed around, a plastic bucket plonked next. 

When crabs are ready, they are piled steaming hot right onto the middle of the table. 

Remember to ask for a paper bib before you start!

Melted butter is good with the crabs. Also a green chili + vinegar sauce. 

For the two weeks I was around:

Mondays. All You Can It Medium Size Crabs for $35
Tuesdays. $2 small crab and $2 domestic beers
Wednesdays. $20 lobsters
Thursdays. $3 medium crab and $3 beers
Sundays. $1 oysters

Definitely will return and have recommended to everyone I meet.",Xs4wlPwWUCdQSqqFDG1b_A,4,2,5,rHL_ch3yAPVmXdN38fqiXQ

When we arrived there was only one table taken, I was shocked that it wasn't packed but glad since we didn't have to wait to be seated. My family and I ordered the hush puppies, calamari, Boardwalk fries, crawfish, and a dozen blue crab. The hush puppies were delicious one of the best hush puppies I have tried. My niece and daughter loved the crawfish so much that we had to order them another pound. The blue crab was as fresh as can be since they do get it shipped from Maryland. They have vinegar to dip your crab in, yes I said vinegar! It's pretty hard to find any seafood places that carry vinegar around here.",jEBySjq6tgL-_R3P7LHq0w,2,2,4,WUiSC_mCOQGrTerUodKWgQ

The only other things we didn't like is when we call to put our order in they are already out of large females and its pricey.

264729,2011-01-28,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"I've read all the reviews, so I guess I was there on an off night.  We went on a Thursday night, around 6:00 PM.  It wasn't crowded, but there were quite a few people there, and one vastly overworked server.  While there were empty tables, we still had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated (another couple waited longer), and another 15 minutes to place our order (the same other couple still waited longer).  My sister-in-law lived in Maryland for a long time, and loves crab.  I've been to Maryland several times and was looking forward to this.  We had gone before on a Friday night and when we learned the wait was over 30 minutes, went elsewhere, so we had our hopes up.  Mistake.  My wife and sister-in-law ordered the crabcakes.  One had french fries and one had sweet potato fires.  I had the soft shell crab and onion rings, with coleslaw.  We received our order about 20 minutes after placing it.  A beer would have made the wait a bit more pleasant, but they won't have a license until February.  My sister-in-law's comment about the crabcakes was that she had had worse (she's kind), while I thought my wife's were a bit mealy.  My soft shell crab came hot, but relatively tasteless; the onion rings might have come from the supermarket freezer, and the coleslaw was soggy (I love coleslaw) and flat.  The tartar sauce had an odd flavor, so we left it alone.  The fries, both varieties, were ok.   All in all, for the above order, plus soft drinks, $60+ wasn't too bad, if it had been good, but with the wait, the taste (or lack thereof), we won't be back.",Ger_Ldj0G5sUwXc9-AVB3g,3,0,2,Q97yQS4ZZYIDLUsRcrMQvw

female blue crabs - i order female because i love the orange stuff. organs. whatever it is. LOVE IT. couldn't really taste the seasoning because it's all on the outside which is fine, i like my crab with lime, salt & pepper anyway

spiced peel & eat shrimp -  half the size of the shrimp i got at hot and juicy on 2/14 and overcooked. decent flavor.. prob won't order again

fried oysters with corn and potato salad - i actually ordered corn and sweet potato fries but the server mixed up my friend and i's order. sides just ok, the oysters were nice, big n crunchy in a tempura like batter (not bread crumb)

5oz crabcake platter - my friend ordered this and she said it was just ok, not filling at $15.95 but it was mostly crabmeat not too much filler so maybe i'll try next time

we were still hungry (three girls) so we ordered 1 pound crawfish ""louisiana"" style. i'm from texas so i expected more garlic.. onion.. seasoning.. this was buttery and had some spice but definately needed more flavor.

I consider myself an expert in this area as I grew up around the Baltimore, MD area - home of the Blue Crab if you ask anyone who knows anything about how to get it done.

I told one of the owners, John, that wouldn't it just figure that 3 weeks before I am leaving Las Vegas....I would find Blue Crabs after 20 years. I actually reconsidered my plan to move after eating here. I am not even kidding - but then John offered to ship the crabs to D.I.A. for me and I decided to stick to my plan to move to Denver.

But I digress (as usual)....this place is LEGIT. TOO LEGIT TO QUIT if you ask me. I went with my dad, who is in town from the MD area, I knew that he would be the one to experience Crab Corner with me. We already knew that we were set on splitting an order of #2 males. But what else to get....BOARDWALK FRIES? Stop it right now. As I bit into the fry, I was immediately taken back to Ocean City, MD. And then the crabs came that were SO fresh and prepared perfectly with Old Bay sprinkled all over their bodies. 

H-E-A-V-E-N.

And then I just read below that Utz Potato Chips are on the way. All I can say about that is !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I had a date with this one guy who offered to take me for  the best lobster in town. we pulled into this strip mall next to a Red Lobster, i started to laugh. Red Lobster is a ""high end"" fast food joint, far from BEST anything. then he pointed to the opposite corner of the mall, to this little hole in the wall. 

As i'm a foodie, and am a great seafood lover, i will ALWAYS try a new restaurant (especially if someone else is paying). as we walk in, and i see this place, little more than a school cafeteria in decoration, rolls of paper towels on the table, plastic table cloths over wooden picnic tables, i was wondering what kind of place did this guy bring me to? but i now realize the kitsch of the decoration, is part of the charm of this place, decorating (or lack there of) is a way to make EVERYONE feel at home, and not to detract from the taste of the food. 

We ordered the king crab legs and the lobster (what can i tell you, i have expensive tastes) however, the pricing was fairly reasonable. this was my first time having king crab, and even though i had a difficult time cracking those suckers, it was worth every minute. the lobster was the most tender i have ever had. being from Canada (Ontario, NOT the maritimes) i had never had hush-puppies, and personally probably won't have them again, they were OK, but a little too bland for my taste, reminded me a bit of falafel which i'm also not a fan of. 

Several months later when my mother was in town visiting me for my birthday, i brought her here, the look of skepticism on her face probably mimicked mine when i first came here, but she trusted me, because she knows how i am when it comes to food, if i recommend a place there's a reason for it. we ordered the lobster dip appetizer (AMAZING!) and again the lobster and king crab. unfortunately they were short on crackers, so we had to share one, not happy about this (they need to restock and have a surplus of these things, only downside of this place that i've seen so far), but the lobster and crab was even better than i remembered, my mother who has traveled the world over, has had lobster in Maine, Newfoundland, and other states and provinces in the east, and she was ready to order a second lobster (which we actually did). this time for the sides i ordered the sweet potato tots (i even ordered some to go after the second lobster, because they were so good), all in all, the 2 lobsters, an order of king crab legs and lobster appetizer came to $86, that is a DAMN good price. the next day, when my mother was back in Toronto, she called me up asking if she could fly in once a month just for the day, just to eat at the Crab Corner, and considering my mother doesn't like ANYTHING, that is one hell of an endorsement.",i3fzFrfaq5v5p4OEiJzNHQ,0,0,4,nudkIOaRnCbsc8hjuzCpYg

First off.  These are the real deal.  They are cooked on old bay seasoning ( which every crab lover knows is the ONLY way to cook crabs. The place reminded me of a crab house on the water back in Maryland.  Complete with brown paper on the table. and rolling rock beer.  Yum yum 

Only have two knocks on the place. 

1.  Dropped 200 bucks here.  Two couples eating crabs and beer.  That's pretty steep. 

2.  Guys get some friggin metal butter knives so the people from the east coast that really know how to eat crabs can eat without pounding the shit out of the crabs with those damn hammers.

We ordered the boardwalk style fries, bowl of lobster bisque, 1/3 lb. crab cake sandwich and a fried oyster sandwich. I didn't love the fries and thought it was okay. Only after we left and I looked at the menu again did I realize that you are supposed to season them with crab spice and vinegar. Oh well...I will definitely try the crab spice seasoning next time but I'm no fan of malt vinegar so I don't know if that'll make a difference. We shared a bowl of lobster bisque which was very tasty but I thought it would be better if I found actual pieces of lobster in the lobster bisque. Afterall, the bowl wasn't cheap at $8 a bowl. My husband devoured his fried oyster sandwich which he claims was very good. It was served on a bun with lettuce, tomato and cocktail sauce. The crab cake sandwich also came on a bun with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce. The crab cake was delicious and full of crab meat and little filler if any.

I rated it a 4 star because based on what we ate, we are a fan and plan on coming back to try the rest of the menu and more specifically the blue crab. Although the food is a bit pricey, you do get what you pay for. The staff was pleasant and observed them helping out new diners crack open some crab.

I asked the server what kind of oysters did he have and he told me he had no clue and did not even try to go see what kind. I got the shrimp and I could tell they were not fresh. I say this because I asked the guy if they were and he said they were. The oysters were the huge pacific oysters and those are not ideal for frying in my book. 

lobster bisque: had a good taste but I took it back into the restaurant because I expected chunks of lobster and simply got nothing but little shredded pieces. After I finished it I could have sworn I tasted crab. 

potato salad: I think I tasted celery. I took one bit and did not finished. Lacked salt. Very bland.

corn: average, had a bit of seasoning on it.

shrimp: average tasting, but I could have went to a fast food restaurant for the quality AND taste.

oysters: I HATE pacific oysters, but I decided to give them a chance anyway in fairness. I ate one and threw away the rest.

832268,2012-01-17,3,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"You need to know right now that my Wife grew up on the Atlantic Ocean very near the Chesapeake Bay. Her family were all Watermen. They fished and raked both clams and oysters. Just what do you think she ate every day of her life? Right, seafood. Ok, me too.

Crab Corner food is what I remember from my Maryland and Virginia peninsula days. It is absolutely authentically prepared each day with 'flown in overnight"" fresh seafood.

Our meal last night (Monday) :

Appetizer  -  Calamari.     Fresh tentacles and tube rounds in a light coating. This offering is cooked quickly. The crispy coating is light, brown and in place. The squid inside is hot, tender and clean tasting. Remember, if you cook squid over a minute you get rubber, These folks know how to do it.

Soup:   -   Cream of Crab.     Hot, creamy succulent, and filled with blue crab meat. This is something Libby's Grandma would make.

Entree   -   Crab Cake Platter.     Let's start with the fact that these huge cakes are nothing but blue crab. There are NO FILLERS. They use a very light bit of coating and then broil them. Nothing but taste here. Excellent menu item. Comes with two cakes and two sides.

Entree   -   Soft - Shell Crab Platter.     The best you can get. They have a number of sizes. the three we had were called Chesapeake Bay, MD ""Prime Size"". Crunchy, sweet and juicy. Very ""home style Maryland"".

Sides   -   Don't bother to fool with the regular old frozen fried. Pay the extra $1.00 for the wonderful Boardwalk Fries. These are hand cut and fried in peanut oil with a hint of crab spices. Then you make them swim in some great malt vinegar. Just like on the Boardwalk in Ocean City Maryland. I can almost smell the salt are as I eat them.
Mimi's Potato Salad is the home made style that is uses by Mom's and Grandma's all around the Chesapeake Bay. Seriously flavorful, rich, and creamy. The Cole slaw is creamy and filled with that course slaw you want. The texture and flavor is right there.

Drinks   -   Iced Tea was fresh made, cold, and clean tasting. A fine thirst quencher.

We had no room for desert. I think for my next trip in I will start my meal with a Baltimore Shaved Ice ""Snowball"" with about a dozen flavors to choose from. My Wife did manage to get out the door with two packs of Tasty Cakes. (that's a comfort food from MD)

The menu is extensive. It is going to take us a while to try everything. You see above what we had on this first trip in. Go on line (CrabornerLV.com) and take a look at their menu. It is extensive. 

Their claim to fame is the ""flown in daily"" Maryland Blue Crabs. They are steamed with Crab Blend Seasoning and the dumped on your table. You just use your mallet and pick to bring that sweet crab meat right on to your taste buds.

My next meal is going to be fresh single fried oysters and a bunch of steamed hard shell blue crabs.

For the quality, quantity, cooking, and freshness of what you get at the Crab Corner the cost is very reasonable.

so i started going to the new west side location, but went back to this one tonight because i was on the east side of town.  bad idea - should have trusted my instincts. the waiter recognized me as a regular this time, so things seemed promising.  i asked for soy sauce when i sat down, as i *always* do, and not until he brought my order out did he tell me that they didn't have any.  fine, i will eat some of the crabs (because i was starving) and take the rest home and eat them the way i enjoy eating them - with soy sauce.  nope!  can't take leftovers home.  i said i always take my leftovers home, and he points to a sign that says that you can't.  i said i've been coming here for 3 years and always take the leftovers home - he goes ""then you should know the policy"".  um, no, i didn't know your *new* policy.  then he has the nerve to say to me snarkily ""so the reason you didn't eat them was because you didn't have soy sauce...right.""  sorry, i don't need to explain to you why i didn't eat them, but yes, that's why.  then i tried to use my groupon which i have been able to do even on their specials in the past, but i guess this exclusion is a ""new policy"" as well.  then, the guy goes, ""next time, i'm only letting you order six at a time.""  cool, nice way to treat your regulars.  sorry, there won't be a next time.  the worst part was the way he talked to me - i understand that there is now a new posted policy, fine, but he treated me like i was a criminal trying to steal from his business and talked to me like a parent scolding their child (the guy is the asian guy with the shaved head).  it's a shame, because i really liked this place - coming from philly, it was cool to have a place to get seafood that reminded me of home.  and the owners were great guys - they were always there in the past and greeted me warmly when i came.  the old asian waiter was also great - he would bring me soy sauce, my dozen crabs, and my drink without me saying a word to him but ""thank you"".  haven't seen the owners there since the new place opened, nor the old waitstaff who actually understood customer service.",Kdm-5JbEhAjPv-xuGrsHLg,7,0,1,MF9x0yjosl4G2fWjeXBydQ

The seafood tasted exceptionally fresh, was steamed when ordered, and nicely seasoned with a homemade old bay.

It didn't quite make 5 stars because the ice water tasted like it came fresh from the Chesapeake (Not a plus), and the paper towels offered weren't sufficient for hand cleaning.  Bathrooms are available, but I' wished there were moist towelettes.

1352477,2012-11-19,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"I've actually had two experiences by the time of this review

1st experience was on a Tuesday, when they had their $2 female blue crab special. Service was great and the waiters were nice. +1 right off the bat, they keep your water filled ! XD Restaurant was maybe 1/2 full? maybe a little less (around 5ish pm). not bad. 

I had ordered 5 crabs while my other friends ordered 3 more. As one of my pictures (and many other peoples pictures) show, they pour it on the table. The crabs come out on a tray the waiter carries over, and dumps it on top of a large brown butcher paper they place on the table beforehand. They give you a hammer and a knife, and just let u go at it. I've been eating crabs all my life and have prepared them so i pretty much know how to open and eat them pretty easily (granted blue crabs are smaller and require more work). Seasoning was yummy. The texture of the meat was good. and each shell had a decent amount of ""yummy stuff"" that probably only asian's eat. XD The only complaint i have of this experience is it had a slight, very slight taste that seemed it may have not been as fresh? as i had hoped (well this was my first experience so had nothing to compare). aside from that, it was great. it was a very slight taste so it didnt bother me too much. I also had ordered a side of sweet potato fries which were fried wonderfully. great color. crispy but still soft on the inside. 

2nd experience was much better. We were served by David. (Don't let looks intimidate you). Very nice guy ! This time was on a Saturday late afternoon (4:30 - 5pm). Got the opportunity to try this place again, started with a few appetizers. First off was the mini crab cakes.. small 1 oz crab cakes, maybe the size of a silver dollar. Nice golden brown color, served with lemons and tartar sauce. Very fresh taste, sweetness from the crab meat. Delicious. 2nd appetizer was the Annapolis Crab Dip. I actually had forgotten to read the description but sounded yummy. It came, already on sliced baguette, but loaded. The baguette was a little on the soft side, had a little trouble picking it up (could have been toasted a little more). The ""dip"" was very creamy and rich, and of course, lots of crab meat. Very heavy but delicious nonetheless. 

As for the entrees, my friend had ordered the Alaskan Cod and fries (she's not a shellfish eater so she opt'ed for the fish). She liked it. She said it reminded her of the fish from Crown & Anchor ! surprising ! +1 for crab corner. The seasoning they used with the fries, was delicious. I'd probably assume its the same seasoning they use for everything else, which makes it addicting ! ! Last but not least, the big entree. Came in a semi large pan. 3 male blue crabs, 4 pieces of corn, probably a handful of shrimp, and lots of clams and mussels on the bottom swimming in probably the water it was cooked it, topped with their very own special Maryland seasoning. I actually put the crabs off to the side and dug into the smaller things first. Shrimp was wonderfully cooked, perfectly seasoned. Cooked to perfection. Easy to peel shells. Mussels and clams were cooked nicely. Of course there's a few in there that had sand but there's nothing really the chef can due, in terms of those types of shellfish. The sand is inside the meat, and the shell is closed, so there is only so much you can do prior to cooking. The corn was nicely cooked, seasoned with their seasoning, once again. Was yummy, ate them all but didnt eat it, uhm, nicely like i usually do with corn, where i can get almost each kernal completely out cleanly. These corn, i just went at it and just mowed it down. yummy ! now the blue crabs. These were actually male blue crabs (can tell by lookin on the bottom. females have a rounded flap whereas males have a point at the end). Meat texture was great. seasoning was great. good amounts of ""yummy stuff"" i had mentioned earlier in the review. NO ""unfreshness"" taste at all this time. Cleaned the meat out of the crab. YUMMY ! so much work, but YUMMY ! 

All in all, the 2nd visit had pretty much made me re-consider this place, and maybe possibly putting it up there in one of my more favorite restaurants now. Everything is fresh. Prices are pretty good for the quality of food you get. Can't really find this elsewhere in the city. Heard they are opening another location on the west side (YES!!! MY SIDE!!!) near Tropicana and Fort Apache. Looking forward to that. But i'll definitely recommend people who like seafood to check this place out.

I am a seafood fanatic and this place doesn't disappoint... for the price on a Tuesday. I have had better, but those places can be very pricey. Of course there are some that would complain about the ""quality"" of the crabs... but everyone has to keep in mind... lots of seafood is based on the season.  The owners are very very knowledgeable too about the crabs, such as if the female crabs are fertile and will have eggs in them. 

The blue crabs were very good, and the seasoning they use is amazing. I also had their sweet potato tots... and if you have read a few of my reviews, you know I am a sweet potato lover. These tots are very good. We also ordered the crawfish, and that was really good too... and messy!

Soft shell crab sandwich- so good. Honestly I just ate the soft shell crab, not a big sandwich person.

It is a little hard to find in the strip mall, but as soon as we got close I was thrilled to see the gentleman outside sporting a Ravens hat in the actual shape of the mascot (akin to the Green Bay cheese hat), a Suggs jersey, and purple and black Mardi Gras beads. GO RAVENS!!!! 

The bright yellow and red walls are a salute to the Maryland Flag. Much of the wall space is adorned with flags, decals, and posters for the Ravens, the Orioles, and the University of Maryland Terrapins. Apparently, this place flies their blue crabs in daily, although they had just run out of males before we walked in. They have beer and crab specials during the game, so my husband was able to enjoy a few crabs (although they weren't very impressive and were on the small side, even for females). 

The cream of crab soup was pretty mediocre, and I kept crunching on tiny bits of crab shells. Other reviewers claimed that there were large chunks of crab, but I didn't see anything like that in my particular cup of soup. Still, we were really happy to be there for the camaraderie. It was great to cheer along with other Ravens fans, and we talked to several people who were either visiting or had moved to the Las Vegas area from Maryland and were looking for a slice of home.

Sadly, on Monday, I got out at 11AM for an hour lunch, only to find this place closed. Looked it up later and they don't open til 11:30AM for lunch. Too bad for them, because I planned ahead to hit them today and while waiting in their parking lot from 11:15-11:30, no less than six people walked up and decided against waiting for them to open. Highly suggest they open a smidge earlier, they're losing out on business.

In any case, I managed to make it in and service was polite- placed a to go order for a crab cake sandwich, had a little bit of sticker shock at the $13 price tag that didn't even include fries or an add-on option for a discounted soup (as other menu items do). Order took a reasonable 15 minutes, server brought me cold water while I waited, which was appreciated. When my order was brought out, the box was opened to show me the food and I was given extra lemons and tartar sauce without even asking, which was great.

Crab cake sandwich itself was tasty- the cake is a good size and surprisingly delicate with a light flavor. Good amount of crab and not too much breading was used, but felt the seasoning was almost a bit too light. Tartar sauce is made in house and it's evident in the taste: light, fresh, spot-on flavor! Only issue I took with my order was that the sandwich was stuffed with three lettuce leaves and two thick slices of tomato, almost as if to make the sandwich look bigger- but the extra toppings made the sandwich messy so half had to be removed. Filling portion, though.

Would come back for some fresh seafood or other menu items.

Fried oysters were good. Came with about 10 pieces and 2 sides. 
Fried shrimp were small.

I ordered the 1/3 pound crab cake platter. The crab cake platter came with two sides...I ordered the sweet potato fries and the hush puppies. The crab cake was just okay. It didn't really taste like crab. Ive had better crab from Walmart to be honest. The fries were very soggy and limp. The only thing I really liked was the hush puppies. They were as another reviewer stated ""legit"". My wife ordered the garlic blue crab plate. After about ten minutes of waiting for her food one of the staff came over and told my wife and our friend that the crab they ordered wasn't good and they'd need to order something else. We were very happy that they at least told us the crab was bad but then it really made us think about if we want to ever eat here again. We got our answer not once but twice! My wife decided on getting the peel and eat shrimp. It was bland and had a funky sauce that came with it. Then what put me over the top was when we got our bill. They charged us an 18% gratuity! For me my wife and two kids they charged us. They also charged our friend 18% gratuity and it was just her and her daughter. WTF!!! Right then and their I knew I was done with this place. I'll bet they charge everyone the gratuity and most people don't even look at their bill. It's sad because I always tip but I don't want to be forced to tip.

But my buddy promised that this will change my mind since they have the freshest crab in Las Vegas. Crab Corner is a small restaurant in the corner of a strip mall. Very unimpressive from the outside. Inside, it is very informal. The wait staff was super friendly. Before they bring out the food, they bring a fresh piece of brown paper to cover the table. You eat your crabs directly on the paper tablecloth. No plates for eating the crab. They to provide a small wooden mallet and a plastic knife to assist in opening the crabs and extracting the meat. We started by ordering 8 small crab cakes followed by 2 large crabs for our lunch. Crab cakes were all crab with little or no filler. It was served with a very tasty tartar sauce. Very nice. Next came the crabs. Our server was incredibly helpful showing me how to open the crab properly. However, when all is said and done, this didn't change my mind about eating crab. It was way too much work for way too little return. And, I felt it was a little pricey ($22) for an informal lunch in a small unpretentious restaurant in a strip mall. Despite five star service, I still can only give it a 3 star rating. If you are dying to try really fresh crab in a very informal setting, Crab Corner is probably worth a try for you.

Although it was DELICIOUS - it was only six baguettes with crab dip on top of them for $10.99.  Unacceptable.  I and two others ordered the Lobster Roll.  It was all bread.  Although the bread was delicious - I was not there to eat bread.  The fries were cold and tasted old.  When another party brought that to the attention of the waiter, within minutes he brought out steaming hot fries ...... still tasting 'old.'  Another party got hush puppies and one of which was not fully cooked.  This same person ordered Cod which was not fully cooked in the middle.  Overall a disappointing experience, especially since they added the tip to the bill and nowhere was it noted that they would be doing this.   I MIGHT try it again for the crab.

I've been to a couple crab places in Maryland and was never that impressed. But it had been awhile and I had the gift certificate - so why not give it a shot and visit the East Coast from Vegas.

It's a small and unassuming restaurant. It has a dive-y feel, but is cutely decorated with crab and Maryland items (ex. Orioles items). You seat yourself. Menus are brought to you. Market prices are posted on the chalkboard behind the counter / cash register.

We were greeted immediately, had the menu explained to us, and our drink order was taken right then. Very friendly and attentive service. Very knowledgeable too - our server had some great recommendations.

The menu is rather extensive and includes non-seafood items too. But, of course, when at Crab Corner, you should get crab - or at least some seafood. They have a small beer and wine list too.

After ordering, paper for table, utensils, bucket, etc. were brought to us. (No bibs, though.)

We opted for the Maryland crab soup, boardwalk fries topped with crab dip (it's called crabby-style), 1 large blue crab (they have ""regular"" up to ""jumbo""), and 1 lb of littleneck clams. The blue crab took the longest and items were brought out to us as they were ready.

The soup was unique and tasty. Tomato based with basically shredded crab and veggies. The fries were seriously yum. On their own, they were good fries and perfectly done. But topped with the crab dip just elevated it to a whole other level. Seriously tasty! The clams were yum too. Perfectly cooked in a beer, butter, parsley, etc. broth. And the bread that it came with was great too. And then came the blue crab. Thankfully, we sat ourselves at the table next to the instructions on how to dig into one. And wow, I was blown away. Perfectly done and delicious. WAY better and FAR superior to that famous blue crab restaurant I went to in Annapolis, Maryland. Succulent and so tasty! I was so close to ordering another crab or two (but alas, I had filled up on the goodness of soup, fries, and clams).

We will most definitely be back! Fabulous food and fabulous service. Everything was super fresh and perfectly cooked. Who knew I actually like blue crab?",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,9,5,5,94KaRF_RUM721-NiAnDKTg
1999750,2011-05-22,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"After reading all the great reviews on here, my husband and I decided to try it out. We ordered takeout. We got the mini crab cakes for both of us, I ordered the clam strip platter with boardwalk fries and hushpuppies, and he got the soft shell crab platter with sweet potato tots and applesauce.  The only thing of his I tried was the sweet potato tots--crisp and yummy! He said the soft shell crab was great also, but I'm sure he'll elaborate in his own review.

The mini crab cakes were awesome! Big chunks of sweet crab meat with hardly any filler--just the way crab cakes should be. The clam strips were some of the best I've had. It's quite rare to get fried clam strips that are freshly prepared instead of pre-frozen, especially out here in the desert. They survived the journey home really well along with the hush puppies, which were nice and crisp on the outside and well seasoned. The boardwalk fries were soggy, but that may have been because of the combination of vinegar and a car ride home in styrofoam. I'll probably get the sweet potato tots like my husband next time we get takeout, but I'd still like to try the boardwalk fries in restaurant to see if they come out crisper because the flavor was good. I also ordered an ice cream cookie sandwich, which they waited to make until we arrived to pick up the food. That kept it from completely melting all over the place, which was considerate of them.  We also got a fresh brewed iced tea, but it tasted kind of funny to me. Not terrible, but I'll be cautious getting it again because I love good iced tea. 

All in all I'd say our experience was a great one--the food traveled well and didn't get soggy except for the fries, and the person I talked to on the phone as well as the one who took our money were both very friendly and helpful.

Anyways, the negative part of the review comes from the sandwich and the bisque. The bisque was probably a few days old or perhaps just a bad batch but it was horrid and what little lobster flavor it did have was rancid and made me glad there was no actual lobster meat (which by the way their grub hub pay says has plenty of). 

The ShipWreck Po'Boy is properly named but that is only because it truly was a shipwreck for me. Again, the oysters were rancid and cold, the catfish tasted as though it was caught a few months ago, frozen, and then sat around for a week before being fried. Shrimp were decent and the baguette was fine which saved the place from being a total shipwreck. 

As of this writing, it will be hard for me to ever order from this place again given the litany of options in Las Vegas which I travel to and too often for work and play.",isar3uiSyB5p9IUIvePFcw,0,1,2,1hVA0diUjqAtkpsP1mIEVA

He tried to make it up by bringing us a small order of fried oysters.  The flavor was okay but it was another basket of overly fried seafood.   I wanted to suggest some places he could visit to see what calamari should look and taste like.   2 ice tea's  $4.98 thank goodness the hubby drank water.   My son had fried oysters, hush puppies and onion rings.   More overly fried food but he liked it  $14.99.  Pasta Alfredo  $14.99 for the hubby and this tasted pretty good with lots of shrimp but not worth the price.   I had the crab cake just 1 $16.99.  There wasn't a lot of filler in it but it just didn't taste like the price.   I was expecting succulent juicy crab and it was pretty dry and blah. Hubby got a side of onion rings  $2.99.  Our bill was over  $91.00 before the  $25.oo Groupon.   For this kind of money we could have eaten at a really nice restaurant with delicious food.   I recommend if you have this kind of money to spend go somewhere else.   We will definitely not go back.

Be prepared to work for your food and get a little messy!  Have fun! Walk in and the place is simply furnished But cushioned seats. Sports plays on the tvs. Some tables are shared between 2 parties. Paper covers the table so you can eat right off of it. Our server Bryce was very friendly, attentive, and really great overall.  My man drank beers and I had soda. They offered $1 oysters so we ordered 6.  I didn't care for these as they were larger than I prefer. My favorite starter is the creamy lobster bisque. Always has good bits of lobster in the thick and tasty soup.  I don't want any other kind of crab but blue crab when I come here. The bigger the better.  They have a great deal $2 blue crab on Tuesdays. Although I have never taken advantage of it.  It is enough work for me to get the meat out so I prefer as much meat as possible.  The females are great when it is the season for eggs.  I like the eggs and fat mixed in my rice.  Everyone does it different. I flip it to its under side.  Pull off all of the legs. Flip open the shell of the abdomen and remove it.  Stick the knife in the opening you've just made to separate the body from the big shell. Then using my knife I scrape off all of the gills and guts to toss away.  Then break the body in half to get the good stuff!   I save my wooden mallet for the claws.  I take a folded paper towel and place it over the claw before I hammer at it, to prevent flying shells. Sprinkle the old bay seasoning in my melted butter for dipping. Then to balance all the salt I enjoy my crab with steamed rice.  We shared a half dozen of large females today.  I felt they were a bit small for my appetite so we also ordered the little neck clams.   I love them smaller.  The flavor for me tends to be better.  So yumm!  They give you bread for dipping in it's seasoned garlic butter sauce.  Smells good too!  The nice thing about this crab spot is that the smell of seafood and seasonings doesn't linger on you in comparison to the Cajun style restaurants.  Our total for 2 people came out to around $78.

The rest had ""mushy"" meat in the body and legs. Inedible in my book. Not to mention this condition of crab meat will likely give you hives.

Depending on the season, I can buy a live 2 lb. dungeness crab from the Asian grocery store for anywhere between $8-$20. Suffering a pricey $$$ Crab Corner lunch tab on a non-special day will never happen again at this location.

At $8-$10 per Crab Corner blue crab, one would think you'd expect perfection. Yes, we worked it out so we only had to pay for our crab cakes (fishy tasting - probably leftover day-old crab) and oysters (not good either - read below) and 5 crabs... but because so many crabs were bad and the kitchen fixes the crabs to order, this lunch ended up being over 2.5 hours long. A total waste of our afternoon.

Oysters were on special ($1 each) but were ridiculously small. The owner-manager (AJ) described them as being ""Skipjack"" oysters. I'd never heard of a ""Skipjack"" oyster before in my life, and I've eaten thousands of oysters. A skipjack is an oyster boat, right? Whatever they actually were, they were tiny, not even good, and therefore not worth it. And they were shucked poorly as well - little bits of teeth-chipping shell were in almost half of the dozen I got.

My wife and I went here with a friend after church. Its located in a small mall plaza right after the zia record store on eastern. When we went inside, the setting was simple with a few tables, chairs, and decorations reflecting all things Maryland. The crab cakes were pretty good. It was a little on the salty side but the tartar sauce really helped calm that salty flavor down. Was it worth almost $20.00? Yes but only if you're craving fresh crab cakes as 20 bucks can go a long way here in Vegas. The steamed sampler contained cleaned blue crabs, corn, sausage, clams, and shrimp in a garlic, butter sauce. I wouldn't order the this again for 2 reasons. First, the sauce was on the watery side and thus gave the seafood no taste at all. And secondly, the crabs and shrimp did not come with the heads so pretty much the best parts of the seafood were missing.

Right then I expected the worst and that came to be....we ordered 1 dozen large females and 1/2 dozen jumbo females...the jumbos where exactly the same size as the large females when I say large and jumbo I am talking about crab corners sizing which are really small and medium if ordering in Baltimore or other areas of MD....I am ok with that, I know what to expect with crab corners' sizing. But for the Jumbo price I do expect at least extra large crabs. 

The crabs did taste great and were full as in the past visits. We have been getting crabs here since they first opened...The past few times the service has been just shy of horrific ...that night the waiter did not come back after dropping off the crabs to see how things were or to  refill our sodas...my granddaughter refilled ours as needed.

One other thing I need to mention, we ordered one bowl of soup and boardwalk fries for starters .....the soup never came and the fries arrived the same time as the crabs.

I have met the owners when they first opened and they were very attenitive to their business and taking care of the customers. I am only writing this that they may wake up and smell the coffee before their hired help runs them out of business.

They specialize in blue crab but were out the day we stopped by. So we decided to split a soft shell crab platter, crab dip, and fried calamari.

The soft shell crab was good but maybe a tad overcooked. For our sides we got hush puppies and corn on the cob. The hush puppies were pretty good but the corn was cold in the center. Since it's winter the corn had likely been frozen. It could have used a few more minutes in the boiling water.

The crab dip was pretty good. It had nice big chunks of crab and was served on slices of baguette. The owner told us it was his grandma's recipe.

We both enjoyed the fried calamari which was served with a good marinara dipping sauce.

We got free sodas with our Yelp check-in. Free is always good.

The owner came over while we were eating to see if we were enjoying our meal. He was very friendly and down to earth. He told us he's been crabbing since he was 15. For the last several years he's been the main crab supplier to local seafood markets and recently decided to open up a restaurant with his brother.

When we asked about the blue crab, he explained that the water is too cold right now so the crabs are all staying in the mud, but he's been watching the weather reports and anticipated he'd have more blue crab in a few days. He definitely seemed to be knowledgeable and passionate about crabs.

I would give the food 3 stars. I'm giving an extra star for the fact that this is a locally owned place with an owner who seems very committed to serving quality food.

We found the Crab Corner based on another internet review and, seeing the number of positive reviews posted, decided to go ourselves.  We expected to find a fancy restaurant and had actually called to make reservations (I have to laugh at that now!).  Instead we found this unassuming little place on the corner of a strip mall.  Nothing fancy at all.  In fact, it looked a bit seedy from the outside, but we decided to dive in  and go ""local.""  As soon as we walked in we were greeted by a young waiter in a ""I GOT CRABS IN LAS VEGAS"" T-shirt.  He was very friendly and gave us a corner seat.  The tables were totally plain with a set of condiments for each.  He took our order for drinks and another waiter came and took our order for food.  On his iPhone.  This was in itself awesome--the order was wired to the cooks before the waiter even left the table!  The waiter was funny and helpful, and even photobombed a pic I shortly took of my wife and me at the restaurant!  I posted it to FB right away :-)  We got the crab cakes which, as other reviewers wrote, were some of the best I've ever had--all crab.  The clam strips were fantastic and actually had real clam strips within instead of the usual nothing-but-fried-stuff with a clam residue.  The fried fish was excellent and my wife, a Texan, couldn't help but repeatedly comment how she could taste the beer in the batter.  The portions were not monstrous--they would be normal--and I ordered another plate of clam strips simply because I'd never had any so good.  We were so happy with the experience that I bought a T-shirt from the place then and there. We are sworn repeat customers.  

PS: I was momentarily afraid after we left because I had stuffed myself on fried food, a massive ""no-no"" for dinner time as I then suffer bad indigestion all night long.  Call it coincidence or call it some sort of ""quality"" frying, but I did not have any problems sleeping with a belly full of fried Crab Corner food :-)

Check this place out and really enjoy the small cafe atmosphere.  You will not regret it!

I visited the Crab Corner for the first time today and was elated to find all my favorite dishes just as good as I remember them from when I lived in Maryland. It was like going back in time for me.

The crab soup was delicious, but it came with a 1/2 of a small crab in the shell in the cup which takes up too much space and I think is something they do in Baltimore for the tourists. I asked for the soup without the shelled crab and it was perfect! My only gripe is that it came in a Styrofoam cup. I would have much preferred a real bowl and a real soup spoon instead of the regular size plastic spoon and plastic cup that they provided.

The crab cake was delicious and perfectly broiled. It was full of Jumbo Lump crab meat with very little filler. They served it on a hamburger roll with lettuce and tomato. In Baltimore I used to get my crab cakes served with saltines. I prefer them that way. Many people prefer deep fried crab cakes, but I wasn't offered an option. It didn't matter to me since I prefer them broiled. I do wish they offered a larger crab cake. They serve a 1/3rd lb. which is kind of small. Several places in Baltimore used to serve ""baseball sized"" 1 lb. crab cakes. They were the best!

I forgot how good ""Ocean City"" fries were. I guess I just took them for granted until I moved away and now all french fries that I get seem pretty bland. I think the main difference is that they are fried in peanut oil. Anyway, It was great to taste genuine Ocean City fries again.

They also offer steamed hard shell crabs which I haven't seen anywhere since I left Maryland. I used to enjoy them, but they are real messy and require a lot of effort to pick them properly, especially the small ones. They are also not cheap! 

My bill for a small crab cake, a bowl of crab soup and a medium serving of fries was $26 which is kind of high for a lunch at a very casual restaurant in a strip mall far from the strip. Even though it was pricy, I'll be going back as often as possible. I know how good authentic Maryland seafood is and I've really missed it!",MQcMuIWh8vHBYm9i7Z4Vvw,4,0,5,2tln9hHFckmHOJh1t7Rurg

But Serving seafood simply isn't enough for them, so on Tuesdays & Thursday's they have the seafood special where whole crabs are just $2 each on Tuesdays and $3 on Thursdays. They also serve chilled beers for $2 as well. What a steal for the price!! That's not all, they have delicious complementary side dishes like chunky potato salad, sweet potato tater totes. But the two popular dishes that I couldn't get enough of was the lightly fried and well seasoned calamari and the crab dip. 

Imagine being temporarily transported from the hot Vegas sun to the cool waterfront of Maryland with the smell of old bay seasoning lingering in the air. Sounds delightful and although it's not decorated to my liking as a sports fan (this place is covered in Ravens memorabilia). The staff and fun make up for it.

So get there early because this place fills up fast and can become a long wait. Ask them to go light on the old bay because it can be to much at times. But once you get settled this place is fun and entertaining with huge TV screens located on the wall. But more importantly full from endless seafood.",YxG7Pg1vifo7qCjg42smew,0,0,4,dJhOJqE4QgTe5ovQgyymsg

The atmosphere, food and genuine people that work there is second to none.

Crab Corner is that kind of place. I spent the first thirty-plus years living in both Virginia and Maryland, where it was routine to buy bushels of crabs on the weekends or go boating and crabbing with my father. 

Being the lazy person that I am, I opted for the crab cake platter instead of the steamed blue crabs. The platter ($25.95 for 2 crab cakes) came with two sides. I upgraded to a cup of Maryland crab soup (an additional $1.50). It's served with half of an in-shell crab. The second side dish was an order of hush puppies -- some of the tastiest ones you'll find in town.

The crab cakes were excellent. They had all the marks of a good crab cake -- very little filler and loosely formed with plenty of lump and jumbo lump meat that falls apart with little effort; enough seasoning to enhance the flavor but not too much as to mask the sweetness of the meat. They're the best crab cakes I've had in Vegas, by far.

They do have a kid's menu that consists of chicken tenders ($5.95) or popcorn shrimp ($6.95). Both come with fries and a drink.

The place is owned by two brothers from Maryland who also own and operate Nevada Seafood Wholesalers, which supplies much of this town's seafood for restaurants and markets like Seafood City.

We were a bit scared when we pulled up and the place was packed but once we went inside we were happy to find out why.  It was all you can eat Maryland crab (they were all about the medium size) The prices change with season but it worked out to be about the same for a dozen for medium size but you get 2 sides per person with it.  So we felt we defiantly got our bang for the buck!

The decor was all Sea Fairing and Maryland themed very fun and very clean!  The bathrooms were especially clean.  You may sit at a family style table if its busy and you are a small party but I felt ok with it because the condiments made for a nice divider.  The staff was AWESOME!  All of them greeted us when we walked in but it wasn't the fake cheer you sometimes get, it was a really nice happy to have you here kinda greeting.  We felt welcome and looked forward to our meal in a nice cheery environment. 

So as I said we did go with the all you can eat, but beware if you do not eat what you order you will be charged so do so according to your eating abilities!  We also opted to order the crab cakes upon recommendation from our waiter.  They are as he said pretty much all crab and ohh so good!  Highly recommend them...  The crabs are seasoned while and after they are boiled with an amazing seasoning that goes inside during boiling and get all over your fingers and the meat of the crab while cracking 

I luckily have been to a Maryland crab place in Maryland so I have had a tutorial in crab cracking but if you have not the guys that work there will help you out and they also have a diagram/tutorial to help you crack them!

We ordered the lobster bisque which is really good! But I think a cup would've do us fine. Comes in second place after Mortons! 

Oysters were the worst! Never tasted or seen any oysters like theirs it was small and weird I wished I taken some pictures but we got 1/2 dozen and my fiancé doesn't like when I complain so I drown my oysters in salt and Tabasco. 

Second came out clams! Yummmmmy in my tummy these clams were so good and buttery with lots of garlic the best dish tonight! And it came with plain bread to dip with. I would just add some of their Maryland seasoning on there and you're good to go!

Last came my fiancé king crab claws and my blue crabs.

King crab claws were on the fishy side but I'm not sure if that's normal since I never really liked them. My blue crabs on the other hands were so nice and sweet and tasty BUUUUTTTTT like the other yelper mentioned it was so darn mushy!

2955566,2012-07-11,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"Quick tip: Try to order 1 dozen at a time because although served hot, they will go cold within a few minutes. The order takes only about 5-10 to come out anyways, so I recommend order as your go.

Great quality blue crab, served extremely hot and flavored with spicy cajun seasoning! For the first ten minutes, the inside juices of the crab is hot to the touch, so be careful. Make good use of the mallet+knife and the meal will be less messy and laborious. Sometimes blue crab is a pain to eat, but there's a few techniques that really makes it easier than just bashing at it. The friendly staff will teach you if you need guidance.

I am more of a dungeness crab eater because the meat is more easily accessible and come in bigger chunks. However, the blue crab here is really easy to crack open once you get the hang of it, and there's plenty of crab to go around so portions doesn't become an issue. I ate about 5 and I felt pretty full. 

The venue is pretty small but cozy. The crab will be ready within ten minutes of ordering (I love fast service!).

A few points I wanna make: The venue is tiny, so there might be a waiting time. The tables are so small it's hard to eat. We sat in the corner and I had a hard time stretching my arms and using the tools. 

Also, I don't know if the cajun seasoning is a winner. I liked it in the beginning, but I really think they should serve it plain. It gets a little bland and tastes repetitive after a while. You can always ask for it later if you want it.

Overall, great place and I would categorize it as experiential eating. It feels awkward not using chopsticks or a spoon but the mallet becomes fun to use after a while.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,4,1,4,QePI_h9P9JxSLn1TAOBgdg

I wish they had some fast-casual place like this in Chicago. Everything is either a fried greasepit or something pretty expensive.  There is some righteous blue crab action happening here.

I tried the soft-shell crab platter and it was tasty. The crabs weren't too greasy despite being fried and breaded.   My parents, being veterans of this joint, knew right away to get a dozen female blue crabs and then do some work on them.  They'll lay the crabs out on your plastic covered table and give you tools to crack and destroy each one.  Each crab is spiced with some spice that is a Maryland specialty (the name escapes me).  It's definitely messy and not very romantic, but as long as your partner is ok with you looking like a fool with crab all over, go ahead and visit.  

FYI - crabs are market price and flown in from Maryland when in season.  You can order males or females.

The hushpuppies were hearty and delicious.  Fries were ok, but definitely go with hushpuppies for your side.  I also tasted the crab cake sandwich which held its own, but the stars are the cute little blue crabs.

(That is a much nicer story than coming to the realization too late that apparently old folks homes don't want to see Rex's erotic version of Winnie the Poo...especially the poo part...and that it took 4 arrests and 5 stints in county before he realized this absolute truth...yes...olympics is nicer.) 

In between...um...workouts for the Olympics...Rex aways would crave seafood. Let's just say where Rex was...um...working out...they didn't have access to the freshest seafood...damn jail...Rex means London...whatever.

The powerful pull of amazing seafood is one that Rex is often subject to...but in Las Vegas Nevada there is a very low...VERY LOW chance of being able to find that great seafood. Even at the classiest restaurants their dumpsters are filled with leftover subpar seafood. Also, in these recessionary times Rex...like all of us...is ever conscious about finances...when he makes his own roofies...he uses immitation Mentos...that is how broke Rexy is right now...but that is another story.  So, where does a budget conscious foodie who is desperate to get that sweet meat from the sea...(ironically Sea Sweet Meat was Rex's nickname in the Navy)...well...Rex has found the best possible place. A place that isn't just good for Vegas...which many places could be labeled...no...this is GREAT for anywhere. Where is it...Crab Corner. Even the words are great...Crab (not crabS...that isn't good)...and Corner...which we can all agree is better than a square. 

First and foremost before we get to the menu...which is all brilliant...one thing must be said...ALL OF THE SEAFOOD IS FLOWN IN FRESH EVERY DAY!!!!! Really read that and understand what it means. FRESH EVERY DAY!!  Not this frozen crap that is sold in stores...that isn't seafood...that is a waste of money. Since Rex has spent his time in the east coast...he knows great seafood...and you CANNOT FREEZE SEAFOOD AND THINK IT IS GOOD!! The fact that these two brothers (great guys, they don't even mind when Rex licks their dumpster) would go to this extent to provide great ingredients is a testament to their commitment. At this point it would be almost impossible to screw up and they dont.

Let's start with the greatest dish they have and the FINEST bowl of soup in town...the lobster bisque. Proof in one bowl there is a God. There are no fillers, it isn't some cream filled monstrosity with some frozen crab thrown in it. NO!  This is the real deal. The depth of flavor they get is just out of this world. No life can be complete and NOT eat a bowl of this soup. Rex wants his ashes to be thrown in the soup and then served to unsuspecting customers...that is how good the soup is and how bad Rex is.

The rest...is all great. The crabs are obviously amazing. Absolutely perfectly cooked and seasoned. The jewel of Rex's heart is the FRESH, hand battered oysters. Salty, briney, sweet, perfectly battered. Just amazing. Rex could go on and on but there is nothing bad.  If there is one minor complaint, to nitpick, their cole slaw is uninspired, the sweet potato fries are sometimes too soggy and one of Rex's lobster tail was extremely overcooked to the point of rubbery. Sometimes the attention to detail in the more delicate culinary pursuits are just not done as well as they should be. Still, on the whole this is the BEST seafood restaurant in town and it won't break your bank.

As the great Rex Marvin says...""does it smell like fish....then give her to Rex!""  Enjoy!",jmyunODJvYT7n7LCgotAyQ,14,11,5,qNF15Z71pLRIQb6vSkMVtA

My beau and I walked in around 12:30pm and there was no wait staff to be found. Stood around a bit until one walked out from the back of the house and we were told, rather apathetically, to sit wherever.

There were two other couples in the restaurant. One was in the process of sending the blue crab back because it had a weird texture and the other had to get up and ask for food that had been sitting and waiting to be delivered to the table for like 5 minutes.

We should have run... But we didn't.

We ordered snow crab (didn't want to chance getting funky blue crab), head-on shrimp, and crawfish.

The snow crab sucked. It was really dry. I sent it back.  The shrimp were hard to peel but that could have been due to a number of reasons. The crawfish were really good, though!

The wait staff was very nonchalant and apathetic about serving. One dude ran around with a fly zapper that looked like a tennis racquet and zapped the things while we were eating... Made a zapping sound every time he got one. Bugs are gross in a restaurant... I'm not sure zapping them while we're eating is any better though.

But, we met in Vegas 10 years ago, and I am no blue crab afficionado. After reading instructions on the wall about a 437 step process that requires removing a devil, I thought, ""Hell, I'm no exorsist"", so I ordered lobster. While my husband drowled at the crabs, I screamed like a little girl, ""Take it away, take it away!"" I know, I'm dumb, but the guy, the lobster, probably known as ""Legs"" to his friends, was looking right at me. To my astonishment, the waiter... I should have remembered his name, and the name of the gracious cook... pulled his buddy away from my screams, and explained to Legs that he was going to have to be de-shelled by another before fulfilling his life's mission of giving pleasure. The cook was so kind as to remove every bit of meat and then serve it to me. That was amazing. Of course, I tipped him... Don't forget that when you are in Vegas, please. Sorry, I digress. Crab Corner is a great place and we're taking his brother tomorrow. BTW, we're pigs, but for 3 people, because we brought my Dad a doggie back...

Originally from Maryland, so I know my blue crabs/crab cakes... This place is as good as it gets for a taste of the Chesapeake Bay! I'm so glad we stopped in for lunch before our flight back and even ordered an extra crab cake sandwich to take with me since I can't get blue crab cakes (yes it matters what kind of crab it is) in SoCal. AJ greeted us immediately upon entry. He was super friendly and knew we were in a hurry so helped us out with suggestions, even though I knew what I was getting. My gf and I split a crab pretzel... SO GOOD! I almost didn't have room for my crab cake after.. but I managed to power through. Even the fresh made potato chips seasoned with crab spice were on point. I would have loved to had time to pick a few steamed blue crabs, but just wasn't able to. Prices were a little steep but where else can you get fresh East Coast seafood? It was worth every penny. The decor was totally Maryland which I loved. I knocked a star off because they support the Ravens (Boooo.. GO REDSKINS!) and because they had a South Carolina seasoning on the tables instead of Old Bay (bad form Crab Corner). But AJ did provide me with a can of the OB upon request, so not a total bust. This will definitely be getting a return visit whenever I'm back in Vegas. Nice little taste of home before Xmas to remind me of my family. Thanks AJ and Crab Corner!! Go Terps! HTTR! Go O's!

The oyster sandwich was different and tasty. And best of all, the food is served quickly and HOT! 

We enjoyed the availability of cold beer and wine with our meals.

We were greeted promptly and our server, AJ, was very  informative! In fact, he was a model employee. They appeared to be short handed and AJ was doing it all. Meeting and sitting customers, setting the table, getting the food and drinks, cleaning up the tables! I mean he was all over the place and still remained friendly and accommodating!

3418334,2012-12-01,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"The first time I came here wasn't sure what to expect as I don't usually go to a crab place, as I'm not much of a shelled fish eater, but I brought a friend who was. 

David is a character and one of the coolest guys out there! (don't let his looks intimidate you, he's super cool) I believe he is the manager, and I was able to meet the owner, Mark, who was also very friendly! All the staff seemed very friendly. OH if you're a Raven fan, it's your place to hang out! 

We had some appetizers to start off, mini crab cakes with tartar sauce and lemons, I loved them, they were moist and pretty big for a 1oz size (or I'm really bad at judging size based on weight), and they were all cooked to a golden brown. I'm not a big crab person, but I really did enjoy them though. The next appetizer was the Annapolis Crab Dip, which contained cream cheese and crab meat served on a toasted baguette. This was also delicious! It was hot when it came to our table so we waited a bit before chomping down on this and loved every bite, there were six that came out with the order. Oh the crab dip was a bit greasy too, if you're not into that, then be careful about ordering. 

So because I'm not a big shelled fish person I ordered the Alaskan Cod and fries. Which came out in a basket with a paper, no surprise there, I wasn't expecting anything fancy. I had fries and a corn on the cob as my sides. So I tried the cod and it reminded me of Crown & Anchors fish&chips which I have to say is the BEST in town, so Crab corner can compete with them on that! The fries on the other hand had their special ""Maryland"" seasoning, which I fell in love with! The corn also had the seasoning too, though on the corn it was a bit stronger than the fries, but it was still all delicious to me! 

My friend on the other hand got this large pan, I believe it's one of their specials not sure what it's called though, but it looked like it had 3 crabs, several large shrimp, mussels and clams, and on top of that had 4 pieces of half cut corn on the cob, all topped with their Maryland seasoning. I tried a piece of the shrimp and it was cooked with perfect seasoning and I really enjoyed it, it was very fresh, I could still taste the ocean in it as I don't with prepackaged stuff you'd find in your frozen seafood section at the grocery. I believe my friend enjoyed all the clams, mussel, shrimp, and crabs. 

All the seafood is fresh and they have a Tuesday $2 special on the blue crabs and if you're a Raven fan, they have specials during the game such as every touchdown the Raven's get you get a crab on the house, and if you come in with Raven colors you get a discount on the bill and such. 

It's overall a good place to go to and I would definitely recommend it to my friends and family who love seafood especially shelled fish!",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,2,1,4,80M9JaxyX3u_imy_bmZMEw

The service was friendly and prompt. The facility was clean, and the bathrooms looked and smelled good. The toilet actually had a shell in place of the usual flusher, which I thought was pretty cute. The only thing I can bitch about is the fact that this place is in Vegas, and I live in Minneapolis. I will definitely be back the next time in Vegas, and I can't wait to try out some of the other seafood, as well. Why the hell can't we have a place like this in Minneapolis? We can't even get fresh jumbo lump crab meat here; I can only find it in canned form, which isn't worth the trouble or the money.

1.  They brought the bisque out and literally ONE minute later, brought out the crab legs!
HELLO! I haven't even had 2 bites of my bisque!!!
Either my bisque will get cold (EEEWWW), and it wasn't served piping hot to begin with, or my crab legs will! I ordered the bisque TO START! That's usually how it works, lol.
2.  The crab legs definitely didn't seem like 1.25 lbs. I buy crab legs constantly and know what a lb is. This was about .75, definitely not 1.25 and for $19.99, they should give you exactly what they advertise.
The bisque TASTED delicious, although there was NO lobster. Not one chunk of lobster at all. Bummer, as I asked the waiter specifically if there were chunks in there. The crab was good, but certainly started getting cold by the time I was done with my bisque. So, I wasn't LOVING either as I felt so rushed to eat both.

5lbs of Crawfish-Too heavy on the oil and butter.  One of us, who loves crawfish and can eat 5 lbs by himself easily, ate 3lbs and had to stop because it was too heavy for him.

Boardwalk fries-It sounded good when the server described it to us...but it tasted like any other fries that we have eaten.  Not so impressive.

3560934,2012-02-01,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"This was my first time eating blue crabs, and I absolutely loved it. The restaurant wasn't anything formal by any means and has the appearance of sort of a sports bar. We were promptly seated and were informed of the Tuesday $2 blue crab special. The service from then on out was a little slow and scattered, but it was completely understandable - one waiter was running the entire restaurant (~10 tables). What I did like, is for those that didn't know how to eat blue crabs, the waiter would stop by and explain the different parts of the crab and how to get to the good stuff.

Crab soup: Disappointed. All the of crab meat was shredded and the flavor was completely overwhelmed by the broth. The soup wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't anything special. 

Beer battered cod: The fish was still tender and the batter wasn't anything overwhelming. Great.

Fried Oysters: Delicious! The breading was a little heavier than I would've liked, but the oyster was incredible fresh and juicy on the inside.

Hush Puppies: Absolutely amazing. These were seriously the best hush puppies I've had.

Crab cakes: Loaded with meet. I could barely find any filler at all. They had incredibly delicious flavor. Because they're loaded with meat, the price is somewhat steep: $16 for 1 cake/$25 for 2. However, getting 1/3lb of crab meat per cake makes it worth it.

Blue crabs: Wonderful flavor. I actually like the flavor of blue crab more so than king/snow/dungeness, but the work:meat ratio is MUCH higher with blue crab. Expect to work a lot harder for your food with these crabs. It's totally worth it, but if you don't have the patience, just order the crab cakes and you'll be set.

Mussels: Great garlic broth they were cooked in, but in my opinion, they were somewhat overcooked. I just ate at Hot N Juicy the day prior and the mussels were much more tender over there. The flavors were great though.

Overall, I'd definitely go back, but I'd likely stick to the crab cake platter with hush puppies.",au9LBf5kXSD6Slfe7AzBrw,1,0,5,4AI_eM3l24gOYfdm0ud-hQ

Well, mom is here and we went to get crabs. As we walked in, i noticed a sign on the door that said Primo Beer $2 pints. We sat, waiter brought us menus and took our drink orders. I ordered a Primo and he said ""we don't carry it anymore and we haven't for awhile"" to which i said ""why is the sign on the door"" He told he that he told management to take it down, but they ignored him. OK fine, no biggie. We ordered drinks, got then drinks and then waited to order...
....and waited....and waited....and waited. There were only 7 other tables and we watched our waiter go from table to table, refilling drinks, bringing food, cleaning off tables, brining checks, bringing back change and not only did he never come back to our table, he never once even looked our way. After 10 minutes of being ignored, we stood up and began to leave. 
As we got to  the door, the manager (I think) approached us and said ""I thought you had been taken care of"". We told him the waiter never came back to which he replied ""You should have spoke up"", said with an attitude.  WHAT?!??!?! We should have spoke up? Since when is it the patrons job to make sure the waiter or manager takes care of the diners in the restaurant . We would've easily spent over $100 tonight and i am certainly not begging anyone to take our money.

They also have other specials (dine-in) during the remainder of the week: Mondays - 1.25 lb snow crab legs $14, 1 lb shrimp $14, 1 lb crawfish $5

Wednesdays & Thursdays - 1.25 lb fresh whole steamed lobster & 2 sides for $20.  

Even though I've been to some other seafood restaurants in the area, I really like this place. While there's plenty of parking, the restaurant itself is pretty small, so you'll definitely need to come early to reserve a spot.  I've arrived at anytime from 5:30pm - 6:30pm, and let me just say that the best time that I've been there is at about 5:30pm or just around 6pm.  Afterwards, it gets really busy and you'll be waiting for awhile.  Another catch is that the place closes at 9pm...I've actually been sitting and eating after 9pm, but they turn away people at 9pm.  Yes, I'm a slow eater...especially when it comes to blue crab.  

I've had the shrimp and the crab and definitely think they're both pretty tasty.  Growing up on the east coast, I remember making many trips just to get some blue crab in Virginia Beach and Maryland.  While it's not the same, I'll admit that it is a good substitute.  Hands down, their Baltimore-style seasoning is on par when comparing it with the ""real thing"".  For the price, you definitely can't beat this deal.

While they do offer sweet potato tots, which I've heard are really good, they now offer white rice, which is something that I do like to eat with seafood--especially with this particular spice.  I also make sure that I have some vinegar on hand too, just for the blue crab though.  

Hands down, this place does not disappoint...when it comes to $2 Blue Crab Tuesdays here.  As for the rest of the week and the other deals, I'm still waiting to check those out.",QiDtS54JwTGeH81c-a84WQ,6,1,4,AmgIUMEKfd0nx4wmHhT6hg

Prior to going, there was a lot of hype.  I had heard how delicious, how awesome.  As I lived in MD for six years, I was really looking forward to a great MD fresh seafood taste.

We went in on Monday and the place was pretty full at 5:45.  There was only one table at that moment that would fit all six of us.  My mother-in-law and I both had the crab cake, which came with two sides.  My husband had snow crab legs, my father in law had a combination plate, and both kids had the popcorn shrimp.

Everyone thought their food was fantastic.  The question really becomes is it worth the price that they charge?  I don't know.  The average cost per meal was $16.

I had a living social coupon, which took off $20.  Because there was 6 of us, they charged 18% tip automatically.  I paid before we got our food (so it won't be an issue with my inlaws playing the ""no, I AM paying"" game).  Later while we were still there, I thought about the tip amount and it seemed under what it should have been.  The guy charged me tip on the amount AFTER he took the $20 off, but then he charged me for two kids drinks when they were supposed to be free with the kids meal.  Hence, $5 that would have been the extra tip I was about to leave, was paid to the house for his error.  Oh well.

I am not sure if I will return.  There are a lot of great places in Vegas and I am not sure that I was bowled over by it.",kWj6AdUtkvbzhdsqRifwLQ,2,1,3,c38v3Gy3Ca9OmLAlELbS2A

Came here after working out at the gym and since I've always drove past it on Eastern I figure this was the best time to try it.  I came here solo and in my gym gear (so I was ready to get messy) and got 2 large crabs and a lb of shrimp.  The shrimp was good and the crabs were too!  I've broken crab before so I had my own method of doing things but the people that worked there showed me how they normally do it.

Crab pro tip:  Take a leg or claw out and flip the crab over.  With the tip of the leg/claw flip the tail or bottom shell up and rip it out.  Then separate the shell from the body from behind!  Eat everything but the gills and shell!  And the hammer or mallot thing they give you is for cracking the claw!

Anyways, I found out that this will be the Baltimore Ravens bar on NFL Sundays.  How awesome for them.  Crab ""is greater than"" Crawfish, ahem.  But the shrimp was just a filler.

I brought my Dad here and we loved it. One of the staff members seemed to be new because he almost placed another table's food in front of us. He was also unsure about some items on the menu. We had the hot crab dip appetizer, I had blue crabs, and my Dad got a fried food platter. The app was amazing and cheesy and I had to not think about the amount of calories I was shoving in my mouth. I personally feel that breading and frying any seafood is a travesty so I didn't bother to sample anything on my Dad's plate. I had a great time whacking away on the blue crabs. 

The other diners were super sweet and everyone interacted with each other. Some were regulars and some were new because of the deal. It added to the appeal to have your tables very close together.

They also have a pick two combo. I ordered chicken tenders and Alaskan cod with sweet potater tots and cold slaw. Both the cod and chicken tenders had little meat inside and I ended up picking off lost of the batter. Slaw was average and the only thing I found to be appetizing were the tots. 

I definitely give the employee props. It was Sunday and he was working alone but was still able to tend to everyone.

We usually get the garlic steamer sampler and it is worth the money. I should say that if you go with someone from Maryland, be prepared to not eat most of the food, because they're absolute wizards at cracking open the most difficult of crab parts.

Its pretty similar setting to other ""Crawfish"" joints.  I guess when I thought of crab I was thinking Dungeness Crabs versus Blue Crab.  BUT on that note, the blue crab you get a choice of choosing Female or Male crab.  We chose a dozen all female and there were 4 of us digging in, and we still had left over.  Blue crab is a little bit more work, but let me say these blue crabs are pretty big and full of eggs if you eat eggs.  I do, with rice and dip the crab in vinegar sauce (which you have to ask for)...so Asian of me, LOL. 

He threw in an extra blue crab and glad I had that deal from living social.  Oh, I forgot to mention, the crab cakes are a must.  It really is made of crab pieces, and the only way I would eat crab cakes.  Its a bit expensive, but definitely worth trying and devouring!  

We got the manager's info handy in case we ever want to order from his Point of Contact for Crawfish, crabs, etc.  We like to have crawfish parties in the convenience of home every now and then!

The crabs were heavily seasoned but luckily not crazy-garlic-ish like hot n juicy's seasoning blend.  Eric R. was less than thrilled about working for his meal, so he was whiny the whole time and lamented that he did not order the crab cake platter for his meal.  The crab cakes we tried were all crab, no filler, so that was positive.

There was a sign on the wall next to me that told us how to open the crab for maximum eating pleasure.  I got this down easily and malleted my way into the legs, making perfect cuts each time.  I really dug the sweet potato tots too because they were basically little mounds of sweet potato fried in batter, rather than shredded and made into tots.

After that, Mike bought a Tastykake so Eric R. then bought one too and he ate his for dessert inside the restaurant.  When we got home, we realized we had a 10% off coupon...woops!

After the first night, all I could think about was going back and smashing more blue crabs.
My order was simply a shit load of female blue crabs and some corn.
When they brought the crabs to my table, it was like love at first sight.  
I knew from that moment, my taste for this crab would be obsessive and that's all I would think about until I get it again.  They were loaded with seasoning and served with garlic butter.  Simple yet amazing.

The next day approached, Vegas was a sweltering 109 degrees.  First thought in my head, ""Today is a good day to smash some crabs.  Again.""

This time around, the lust and infatuation had passed and I was able to think with a clearer head.  While still being delicious, these blue crabs are a pain in the ass to open up and eat.  It will take almost $50 of crabs to feel remotely full.  While as tasty as it is, don't expect to get a full belly off these critters unless you don't mind working for it.

Upon arrival, the place looked to be straight off of the Maryland Boardwalk.
 The smell of old Bay let me know I was in the right spot for my craving.

We ordered the bacon-wrapped scallops. With the apricot chutney and a squeeze of lemon, it was the best part of our meal. 

For our main entrees, I had the crab cake platter with hush puppies and beer-battered onion rings. The beau ordered the 2-item combo with beer-battered shrimp and Alaskan cod with a house salad and French fries. It is Tuesday so we took advantage of the Day Special $2 Blue Crabs.

Crab Corner is a small restaurant and when we got there on a Friday night, it was already crowded and had to wait about 15-20 minutes.  There was a large party that was just being seated.  I think they accept reservations, so I would recommend making one before you go.  There was no sign up sheet, but the owners and crew knew the order and offered us seats, while we waited.

The customer service was excellent and with that alone, they would get 5 stars.  My wife said they get 10 in her book.  They were very attentive and helped us with the menu, since it was our first time there.  When the crab came, they showed us how to open the crab up and tricks to get the meat.  We already knew how to do it, but wanted to see if they had special tricks of their own.  =)  The place was busy, but it wasn't just the waiter that came by and asked us how we were doing, but practically every worker came by and talked to us.  You can tell they were genuinely good folks.

We ordered their boardwalk fries, crab cake appetizers, and 6 large male blue crabs.  The fries and the crab cakes came out first.  The boardwalk fries were tasty and splashing malt vinegar on it made it even better.  Yum.  The crab cakes were a little small, but the menu did say each were 1 oz.  Other places compensate and add other stuff like bread stuffing and other fillings, but the good thing about Crab Corner's crab cakes were that it was practically all meat.  It wasn't earth shattering tasty goodness like this one restaurant in Baltimore, but it was still good.  The sauce that came with the crab cakes was a perfect complement and was a good start for the dinner.

Then our large crabs came.  They were out of the jumbo size.  The large size was smaller than expected, but again these are blue crabs, not dungenous crabs.  The meat was very sweet, soft and moist.  The seasoning was good and I liked licking it off my fingers while eating the crab meat.  heheh.  They also had extra seasoning on the side as well.  My wife and I didn't talk for a while, since we were all focusing on the food.  haha.  But again, the waiters and owners came by regularly to check up on us.  If you have little toddlers that get restless, you might want to get a babysitter, since you can be there for a while and your hands get messy.  There were other families there with kids, but I'm glad my sister-in-law babysat our little one that night. 

I wanted to check out this restaurant based on the Yelp reviews and was definitely happy with this place.  However, if you are in the mood for other shellfish and not just crab, you might want to go to other places like Hot and Juicy Crawfish, though this place offers other shellfish as well.  Note, I didn't try other shellfish like crawfish and shrimp here yet, but this is my gut feeling.  I paid the same amount in Crab Corner as in Hot and Juicy, but felt more ""stuffed"" at the latter.  However, Crab Corner definitely satisfied my crab craving and would come back here again.  I definitely want to try their other entrees and appetizers and of course, have some of the blue crab again (maybe jumbo next time).",2Na5lgDJwN1dPyvLmKmWgg,3,2,4,2Z5FwVyU4hklI2gU1oVuHw

It was JUST like being at home! The only thing missing was the river side picnic tables and the humidity. This place gets it right! The hush puppies were delish, the peel and eat shrimp were served hot just like they should be and the dozen crabs were a god send! 
I also sampled the Maryland Crab Vegetable soup and was pleased. It could be made a bit better by adding just a little more spice to it, but otherwise it was great.

To all east coasters that are transplanted anywhere within a few hours drive of Vegas this is a must go! The location is miles away from the strip, and easy to find. 

My only issue is the lack of any lacrosse sticks hanging on the walls and no Naval Academy Blue and Gold anywhere. Perhaps this Annapolis girl should send some gifts their way.

The prices are reasonable and about the same as to what I am used to spending on crabs even at home in Maryland. I know some reviewers mentioned price but I would have paid triple what they charged and still been happy!

By the way the owners are super nice and friendly and it was fun to hear an authentic Maryland accent from someone that was not a character on The Wire or a member of my family!

Based on a previous review I decided to stop in at the crab corner and order what had been highly rated in a previous review, Clam strips, hush puppies and catfish with sweet potato fries. When my plate came out it looked pleasantly full- crispy burnished brown, with a fresh homemade-looking cocktail sauce and tartar sauce. Sadly, the flavor did not live up to the first impression looks. The clams had a crisp exterior which yeilded an unpleasantly mushy and dare I say slimy? Interior. Some of the crispy bits had clam, some were more clam- flavored batter, I'd say half the total order. I'm completely perplexed as to how the previous reviewer had ""ordered another of clam strips as they were the best he'd ever had"". The catfish still had that silver skin on underneath the batter and tasted pretty muddy. I never understood people complaining about ""catfish tasting dirty"" till now. Brrrr. The pieces were small and pretty thin, too (anyone looking for amazing crispy fresh catfish, try Cravin' Cajun on Jones which will still be my go-to). The sweet potato fries were greasy and limp within 5 minutes of their arrival. I ate 3 hush puppies which seemed to be the only rightly flavorful and ""decent"" part of the plate. 

To top it all off.. I ordered a fountain drink (root beer) and the first thing I noticed upon a sip was the strong tap water aftertaste. What the heck!!!

The only thing I think worth stars in this whole meal was the service, with only 2 young guys manning the front and I swear they checked on me at least twice through my meal (both of them).

Read the reviews, and decided this would be a good place to try them out!

$3 Thursdays....the crabs as well as all the beers they sell for $3.  Can't go wrong price wise!  So how does the food fare?

The crabs were very good.  A bit of work to get to the goods, but worth it IMO.  I tried the brains/stomach, and it didn't do anything for me....gave them to my friend.  But I did enjoy the leg joints and claw meat.  And for $3 each, solid choice!

Also, the jumbo shrimp/prawns (head on) are very very good!  First of all, their ""pound"" seems a lot more generous than other quick seafood places I have tried.  Obviously it should be the same, but maybe it is because they are larger and you get more meat than shells.  The seasoning is the winner here...very very good and not super salty and overly done like some places in comparison!  You have to try them!  

The crab dip and crab cakes were also good, but I felt like they were a little spendy for what I got.  Although they were good, I will probably put that money towards more shrimp and blue crabs truthfully.

Tip, the blue crabs are cooked to order, so if you plan on ordering a few at a time, plan it out so you aren't sitting without in between sessions.  I think they took appx 15min between orders, so plan accordingly!

My fault for not asking if they were deep fried or pan-fried, which is my preferred method and the way most strip restaurants I frequent prepare it. So since I was pretty hungry, I also ordered the lobster bisque, which came out quickly and was piping hot. The first spoonful were quite good, with the deep and distinct flavor of sherry. But by the end of the bowl and with the cooling of temperature, it no longer was as tasty. None of this was the fault of our waiter who was quite informative and on point with his service.

5199018,2010-12-15,16,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"I am not 100% qualified to write this review, so let me start with my disclaimers: I am not a crab picker. I am not a seafood lover. However, I am married to one, so my thoughts are based partially on his reaction to his meal, my personal meal and a recitation of the facts.

Facts can be important, especially in the seafood business where product quality is of particular importance, so let's start there. Crab Corner is owned by two brothers who previous to the restaurant only owned a seafood wholesaler specializing primarily in... you guessed it, crabs! They supply a good deal of Spring Mountain Road grocery stores with their live crabs, and now, they are running their wholesale business from this location. So, I'd say the product is as fresh as can be found! They carry Maryland crabs when they are in season, but when they are not, they come from elsewhere. Right now, they are serving up Texas crabs.

As for the crabs, they are sold based on the number you want of a particular size: 1, 2, or 3, with 1 being the biggest crab. They bring 'em out on tray, and then slide them onto your plastic covered table for your crackin' pleasure. Each crab is steamed and covered with J.O. Spice, which is apparently THE spice for Maryland crabs. My hub is still talking about the #1 crab, and we ate this meal a couple of days ago. He approved of both the meat quality and the value.  

I had a crab cake platter: one crab cake, two sides for $15.95. I think this is a little expensive, but of course, I am not an expert on crab pricing! As for the crab cake, if you appreciate crab more than cake, I think you'll approve as it definitely has a strong crab flavor. Although the menu said jumbo lump blue crab meat, the meat wasn't particularly lumpy. Personally, I think I like a little lumpier crab cake.

For sides, we sampled the onion rings, sweet potato tots and potato salad. Onion rings were good, but probably not hand-battered. What's not to love about sweet potato tots? And, I think the potato salad is a real contender! I bet it's based on somebody's mama's recipe, as it tasted like it were made with love. Lots of egg. The only thing I might add is some sweet pickles and a dash of mustard, but then again, who am I to question Mom? 

Lastly, the service is great. Here is another family owned business that deserves some love. These brothers are passionate about their product and their home! You can be sure they will be showing all the Ravens' games, and don't worry, their liquor license is coming soon.  

If you are a crab lover who loves to pick, this should be on your list to try.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,40,22,4,NvMnypASX5VPWo7-VKg0-Q

The location was clean, and the guys working were pleasant.

Now for the fun!

Maryland Crab Soup:  I was SO surprised to find a half of a crab in my soup!  In addition to just the shredded crab meat, they put a half a blue crab in it!  It was delicious, although being served a soup in a styrophoam bowl was a little...interesting.  Not what I expected.

We did the ""Pick two combo Entree"" and ordered:

Sea Clams: Breaded well and delicious.  
Catfish nuggets: OMG so tasty!  
Hushpuppies:  So good, they didn't need any sauce. 

The coctail sauces and tartar sauce they served with the dish was really good too.

We also did a pound of the Garlic Hard Shell Blue crab halves.
I'd never had blue crab, and I'm usually not a fan of the claw meat.  (I know, I'm weird...)

I have had it book marked for nearly a year now, so I was thrilled to have an excuse to try it with friends! I can honestly say it lived up to my expectations in every way - if you are a blue crab lover, you must try it!

My husband's family has a house on the water near Chesapeake Bay in Maryland. My husband grew up eating crabs from Maryland, and I got to experience to go crabbing with their property last summer. Watching the little crabs squirm around while being steamed to death isn't really a fond memory, but the taste of those fresh crabs is something I will never forget!!

Eating at Crab Corner really replicated the Maryland crab-eating experience for me. The crabs were very fresh, and they were prepared the same way as they are in Maryland. I really love that they used an Old-Bay-like seasoning, and didn't go the douse everything in freaking HEAT route that way too many places seem to go. I love tasting the seafood so it kills me when places like Hot and Juicy ruin a perfectly good crustacean with mouth burning spice! The other awesome thing? When you leave here your clothes, hair, and skin won't REEK of garlic for days! I didn't need to take a bath after eating here, so that really rocked! 

The special price of $35 for a dozen was more than fair, and the beer prices were reasonable as well. There were several enticing sides priced at $1.95 as well! MMMM sweet potato tots....

TRUST ME, don't spend your money here, it isn't worth it. Also, Yelp is supposed to be HONEST feedback and by the message the owner sent to me, it sounded as though he didn't want ANY negative feedback.

We got one crab cake sandwich, one soft-shell crab sandwich and a pound of crawfish. I had the crab cake sandwich and it was bland.. it tasted like something that came out of a box, nothing special AT ALL and nothing like the waiter described. It came with a simple tartar sauce that gave it SOME flavor.. it sucked

The crawfish were small, and FLAVORLESS.. well there was some flavor, and it was all butter and grease with a hint of ""spices"" they put on there.. it was WAAAAAAAY OVERCOOKED and the tails were the smallest I've ever seen.

The soft-shell crab sandwich had no meat. It was all shell and hot grease. When you bit into it all you tasted was crunchy oil. It sucked.

It was the worst dinner ever and I will NEVER EVER go back.. I wish I could throw up all of the food we just ate; it is THAT BAD.

We got seated at a table in the middle of the room - no biggie - except that the waiter mentioned that it is much warmer in this area. The restaurant was absolutely freezing! I had a sweater on but my friend had a light sweater and was miserable cold the whole time we were there. 

The waiter was attentive except he had his cell phone out and was checking it in between talking to us which was very annoying. He was very informative and went into detail about the menu along with the specials. Both waiters were running non-stop but did check in with tables. We did not get a refill of our drinks which was disappointing.

We were served soup in Styrofoam bowls - REALLY! The soup was very good but we had to eat it quickly as it cooled off fast. The crab cakes we ordered were excellent with 1/3 pound of crab and was served on fun red plates. The homemade coleslaw was very good and definitely a great side.

We were greeted by one of the Brother/onwers, he suggested the lobster bisque and I am a fan, so we said yes right way. We also tried the crab dip on bruchetta. Both of these were specials for the day and both were very satisfying. Big chunks of crab and flavored well.  The bisque was very creamy and needed just a bit for lobster, but we found out later, that was about the last of it for the day!

We then got a dozen large Maryland crabs steamed with not your Old bay seasoning, but JO Spice, which the owner tells us,  it's Maryland's version. The brown paper came out to cover our table, we were given our hammers and a quick demonstration on how to open them up and away we went. It was a bit of work but the big pieces of crab just melted in my mouth!  

You should know that there is a bit of ""goo"" that's not very pleasing to the eye, and doesn't taste very good, at least to me, so you really have to clean that stuff away, and it's a little messy but worth it to dig out the meat!

5516388,2013-04-07,2,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"Awwww, Crab Corner! We were so excited, based on the reviews we read.  The first surprise was the cheap storefront appearance, as we were expecting a real restaurant experience. The paper towels and plasticware didn't help, but I figured they put their money into their food. 

Amongst the three of us we tried the fried catfish, fried clams, hushpuppies, pulled pork sandwich, fries, crab cakes and- of course- the snow crab legs. 

The hushpuppies were fried too hard, but would have been great otherwise. The catfish was also fried way too hard, but the fish inside was melt-in-your-mouth good. The clams weren't as over-fried. 

The pulled-pork sandwich wasn't a big hit (and wasn't especially attractive) but the little container of barbecue sauce went over well, if that says anything. It was way overpriced for being just a sandwich -it should've been half the price. The Boardwalk fries were all right but the special seasoning just tasted like salt to us. We didn't like the crab cakes at all, but appreciated that they appear to be made with real crab. 

Finally, the service was off. A couple of orders were forgotten, one order was incorrect, and the two servers, who were both friendly, seemed overwhelmed with being responsible for everything from  taking orders to clearing tables to cashiering. I'd hate to see what would happen if the place was more than half-full.  

The crab wasn't anything special. I guess there's not much you can do with crab except ruin it, which they didn't do.  It was $19.00 for just the crab legs and no sides, which didn't impress my S.O., the crab eater of our group.

We had a deal from one of the local coupon sites and it sounded great.
We arrived and were a bit surprised it was in a strip mall and had a decor similar to several other hole in the wall establishments.  This in itself is neither good nor bad as some of the best and worst places are in similar locations.

We sat down and were informed the blue crab was on special for $3.00 each.  We ordered King Crab legs, 4 blue crab, and a place of fried shrimp and clams and a cup of maryland crab chowder. For the sides we had boardwalk Fries and potato salad. (Starches yum)

The waiter brought us our drinks and we watched others fill bowls with crab meat.

The food arrived quickly ( a positive)
But the waiter almost threw the crab on the table as if he was in a hurry to get away. (a negative)

Other people had bowls and butter (a positive) but we were offered neither of these. Ultimately we asked for and were given very small containers of butter. (a negative.)

We were provided with a Mallet and regular forks to use for our food.  The Blue Crab were small.  We were offered no instruction on how to crack them open even though the waiter was aware it was our first visit. (a negative) The meat we could get out of them was very tasty and well cooked. (a positive.)

The King Crab Legs were steamed and pre split (a positive) and tasty especially with the butter.  

The soup was excellent with plenty of crab flakes and a strong hint of crab flavor.

The side of potato salad is one of the best potato salads I have tried. (a positive) but the boardwalk fries were a disappointment, arriving soggy and flavorless. ( a negative) The crab seasoning kicked them up a bit though. (a positive). 

The fried shrimp and clams were good.  You could taste the difference between the clams here and the fast food ones you might get elsewhere.  (POSITIVE).  However, the portion was rather small for the price. (negative)  We didn't even get wet naps after to help clean up.(negative)

In fact, overall, while the food itself is good, it certainly wasn't worth what our bill resulted in.  The prices charged were along the lines of the nice strip casino located restaurants but the food portions, quality, locations and atmosphere do not support the price point.

I will say the manager or owner was very friendly with all the customers, the bathrooms appeared clean and even had a sign to talk to the manager if there was a problem, and everyone did enjoy themselves.

With a great concept, this might have gotten 4 stars with a better price and service but if you like the Maryland crab concept, don't mind getting messy and have a few bucks to burn, you should enjoy this restaurant.",wnO99pBbGqwqOoTQM25iCw,5,0,3,d6vOymVGrrFnvjO9Fh7mSQ

We were feeling a bit crabby so we went on Thursday 12-31-15 at about 6pm for dinner.  We were the only patrons and the two gentlemen there treated us like royalty...they were incredibly attentive and friendly.  

This restaurant is located on Eastern & Flamingo.  Their website says ""fine dining seafood restaurant"" but the ambiance there is very casual...some of the tables are picnic tables, they have rolls of paper towels on the tables, and bottled beers.  

$45.35 got us crab pretzel appetizer, a cup of crab soup, a fried shrimp dinner, a baked tilapia dinner, two iced teas, and a side of fruit for the boy. 

Crab Pretzel ($10.99)is a Bavarian style pretzel covered with their famous crab dip and cheddar cheese.  The pretzel was soft and and the crab dip was creamy and wonderful.  Not too fishy and not too salty....I could eat a whole crockpot full of that dip! 

Maryland Crab Soup, according to their menu,  has ""lots of blue crab meat, tomatoes, lima beans, carrots, corn and onion, flavored with crab spice and served with an in-shell crab half"". Mine did not have half a crab in it...Maybe it's because I ordered a cup instead of a bowl?  I dunno...but I loved every bite of this soup.  I had the flu and it was freezing outside and today I feel 75% better and the soup may or may not have been a magical potion that cured me.  

Fried shrimp dinner ($13.99) came with about 20 lager-battered shrimp and two sides.  I chose the sweet potato fries and a side salad.  The shrimp were so delicious...lightly fried and perfectly seasoned...I wish I could eat these every day.  Their side salad was spring mix with onions, croutons, tomatoes, and cucumbers.  Their ranch is definitely hidden valley and I would pick a different dressing next time.

Let's get service out of the way first. It was pretty simple and what's typically expected. We got checked on about twice but what I noticed was that I was too busy eating and it was nice not to be bothered so much. But if you had needed anything, all you had to do was just let them know with eye contact or a wave of your hand. My sister brought up how she didn't like to be checked up on too much so that's when I noticed that we weren't bothered too much. There was a fairly good amount of people when we were there (around 5:45-6:30pm on a Tuesday night).

I grew up eating crabs so don't hurt yourself, people! I ordered 8 crabs with my sister for $2 each and we also got corn on the cob and hush puppies for our side orders. Those are nothing special. Hush puppies weren't too bad but you can skip out on the corn.

The crabs didn't have THAT much meat (not what I'm accustomed to, at least) so it's just whatever. The experience was nice and I would actually come back.

Ordered oysters on the half shell, a bowl of lobster bisque, sweet potato fries, and 8 regular blue crabs at $2 each. Oysters were small according to my friend. Lobster bisque was ok, nothing special but at $4.99 a bowl fair price. 

Then the crabs came out. Fairly small with a pile of seasoning on top. No butter, no lemon, no sauce of any kind. We ate a couple then decided we would rather have butter, lemon...and my friend wanted her special thai sauce so we had them provide a to go box. Well, getting them to go created them going back to full price. Fine, whatever. Doesn't make any sense to me but its only an extra $12 for 6 crabs. 

The crabs weren't of the the highest quality. I've eaten crab in a lot of places, including Baltimore. I was not a fan of these. Almost felt like fast food crab.

The place looked dirty, looks like the place has not been cleaned in a while. It was a place U see on Kitchen Nightmare. My daughter had to use the rest room and could not even make it back there due to a horrible smell that was coming from the rest room. My wife had the clams and oysters and was so disappointed because they use more breading the clams or oysters. I had the wings and they tasted like they were cooked in old dirty oil. Seems to be a theme here DIRTY. The price for a PBR was 4 bucks.... Really it's PPR. For as dirty as the establishment is there is no way in hell they should be charging these prices and claiming they get fresh seafood on a daily basis. The lobster tank had 1 old run down lobster in it. To top this all off their supply of beer is just stacked in the restaurant. The same beer they charge an arm and a leg for. This place needs a major makeover and clean up. The sign on how to eat a crab looked 15 yrs old and was dirty. No one has taken a sponge, some cleaner and hot water to this place in a very long time... We were not impressed.

5802179,2014-07-26,1,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"If you want to get crabby in Las Vegas this is probably one of the best places to do it. We narrowed in on Crab Corner after trying to find some friggin crab-cakes in this town...not an easy task. 

So Crab Corner has a ton of variety: steamers of different crabs, shrimp, clams, mussels, raw oysters....all the things you'd hope to expect they have. Prices are pretty steep...but I guess we are in the middle of the desert so all that sea-life had a fun plane ride to get to you. 

We did end up getting the crab cakes and they were pretty good - very meaty without much filler. I actually think they could add a wee bit of filler and a few veggie bits to increase the flavor as they were actually kind of bland. They came with tartar sauce which I think is kind of a foul to put on crab but I eventually did anyway since I got kind of bored with it. 

I highly recommend the oysters. They're usually $1.75 except on Sunday's when they are $1 each. I believe they are a type from Virginia somewhere...they are the variety with the smaller but deep shell so they're more meaty. Great flavor and freshness.

The service is awesome! The people there are nice, helpful and friendly!",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,3,1,4,EyX9EZNDGpkaFkdP7fTlGw

The Sweet Potato Fries were disappointing and very bland. The reason I'm giving 3 stars was the service. We were promptly seated and had our order taken... BUT then never got drink refills.

5876865,2012-09-16,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"First off I must apologize to Mark & John Smolen; I frequent your shop once or twice a month for the past year and a half and not only have I only checked into Yelp twice I've yet to write a review for your fine establishment.  That just goes to show you when I show up all I can think about is seafood so well done! 

If you are from the east coast specifically the  DC area you will love their store! It has a ton of MD items and is only slightly nautical theme, most of it is football etc;  on entering the store you will be overwhelmed with the intoxicating elixir of the nautical gods Old Bay; I love the stuff and knew my search for a local seafood restaurant was done. 

I judge a restaurant on its menu; is it full of items or does it keep to the basics with only a few main dishes that they specialize in? their menu is simple seafood and more seafood. If you want whole crabs or legs these are the guys to patronize; If you want the best darn peel and eat Shrimp this is the place to go. 
The oysters are huge but be prepared, the last order wasn't cleaned thoroughly and stomach contents from the oyster came shooting out as you bit into it and or cut into them;  if the rest of the meal wasn't perfect that would have ruined the meal but my group laughed it off and moved onto the next course.  Just be prepared if you order them they aren't the chain restaurant oysters. 

If you like crab but aren't comfortable with shucking and eating whole crabs don't be scared; the owners and their staff will be happy to sit down and walk you through it just let them know you will need assistance; their idea is that they want you to get the most out of your meal and have a good time so you will tell your friends and return with them the next time. 

Prices for the crabs can fluctuate depending on the season and availability but don't let that deter you either. They are very competitive and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  Anytime this guy gets homesick or is craving Seafood he heads over to the Crab Corner!",Yg08tRMxm0eaL-rXyNIAHw,1,0,5,CsDWHXSc-3vaxW90-itGaw
5894688,2011-11-15,2,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"My first experience in a Maryland style seafood house, and a grand experience it was.  

Visited on a Monday Night during Monday Night Football.  The special at that time is half off appetizers.  We got down on an 8 piece mini crab cake plate and crab dip on baguette.  The crab cakes were probably 80% meat, and were delicious.  I can't wait to try the large size one. The crab dip on baguette was rich and creamy, quite delicious as well.  Again, lots of crab, not a lot of filler.

Next was Maryland Crab Soup and Lobster Bisque.  The soup had big chunks of crab with Lima beans, tomato, and half a crab sticking out of the cup.  Very tasty, served up hot.  I am partial to bisque and have had it many places, but the only one I have had that was better than this I paid $12 for.  This was $3 (when bought as an add on to dinner plate).  It was thick and creamy, with little bits of lobster floating around in it.  Excellent! 

Next was the peel and eat shrimp, swimming in lemon and old bay.  I wouldn't know, but my girl told me it was about as authentic east coast as you could get.  She deftly peeled and ate, while I mangled most those I touched.  Food tastes better when you earn it.

Finally, we had three deep fried soft shell crabs.  Well seasoned, and very satisfying to eat.  As she put it, ""You aren't really at the top of the food chain until you eat an animal whole"".  

Give this place a shot!  If you don't like it, walk yourself over to Red Lobster and cry into your cheese biscuit.",NL6rlmujYtlcBJ55nlIs0Q,1,1,5,kYUXSQVxptu_9_O1mhuM6Q
5897873,2012-12-29,1,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,Not too impressed.  Ordered a half dozen of the large and there was barely any meat.  Not worth price.  But the fries with their crab mix on top was good,P1pv4IKC8MTGvH3H--xgtA,1,1,2,Sqzkbpk8xTPywCENSpZfOg

just a great restaurant! The crab is awesome. Tried all their crab... Blue Crab was excellent and very authentic Maryland style. The king crab was juicy and sweet. Add seasoning and butter and it's probably the best king crab I've ever had. 

I usually don't care for snow crab but Crab Corner nailed it perfect. Sweet and juicy. 

Definitely ask for a bib because it will get messy. 

Crab Corner is a different style vs Hot n Juicy, so it's not quite fair to compare.",ai2doAx0P1nob55-7n_Wng,0,0,5,A_L1DRBMG22Qi_P693oGpg

I got an order of Blue Crab, halved and cleaned, in garlic butter.  $11.99/lb....eeeee owww.  Served with rice.  Awesome.

It was gorged in butter, parsley, and Old Bay - it was delicious.  The problem is that with all the necessary work, the food turns cold after bite #3.

The service, gents, were very nice and gregarious.  The ambiance turns a corner of a mini-mall into a pretty good Maryland-ish vibe.

All in all, save yourself the work.  Go for crabcakes or a crab salad sandwich, and call it a day.",ZIOCmdFaMIF56FR-nWr_2A,12,10,4,lVRytYJet8Bnkdp5sEbjUA
5930712,2012-04-26,0,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"This place is definitely an OKAY spot to go to in Vegas. 
After driving by it from work everyday my mother and I finally decided to come inside. The service is outstanding. Best down to earth servers ever. The wait wasn't too long, but that's probably because there were only four people in the restaurant.
I ordered simple crab legs while my mother got the crab cakes, which she enjoyed- although she wished the portion was a little bigger. ""The bread shouldn't be bigger then the inside,"" I believe were her words.
The crab legs I ordered were very delicious and juicy and perfect. But they were the only thing on the menu I actually wanted to order. Most things seemed like a waste to order at a crab specialty place, so my only real option was to just order crab legs.
If this place had all-you-can-eat crab legs, I would probably spend every pay day here. That would just be fantastic.
My only real issue with this place is the menu and the taste. Both are just okay. Nothing that really wow-d me, but I would definitely go back again. Just not because I love it or hate it, but because I crave seafood all the time in short.",8R9VwgFnj3f2JveLAQnCJg,0,1,4,QLyk8PQfG0IZLuy21BgzVA

The waiter arrived with my food and immediately apologized for the small fish portion. Not a good sign. 

Green beans perfectly cooked, hot fresh and great garlic flavor. Sprouts crispy on outside and tasty on the inside. Very nice. The fish...not so good. Great seasoning but very, very dry and tough. Tasted like it had been frozen, thawed, frozen again, then cooked. No moisture at all. Like eating an old steak.

My main order was a fried platter of fried oysters, fried shrimp, hush puppies and sweet potato tots.  The only thing that disappointed were the fried shrimp.  After the meal, I felt like I overpaid for the quality of food I got but it satisfied my craving for fried seafood.

5973511,2011-09-02,1,bQ_wtZvMb__OhprY5bF9aQ,"I love to get my crab on at the Crab Corner. 
Sometimes, I'm in the mood for good ol' basic crab.  No garlic, no crazy spicy sauces... just good ol' tasty steamed fresh Maryland blue crab. 

I have been here twice now, for the $2 special on Tuesday and Thursday, and plan on coming back often.  Not only are the crabs deeee-licious, but the artery clogging goodies:  hush puppies, fried oysters, and fried calamari are tasty too.  Wash it down with a refreshing $2 beer- and life is good.  

They also have other seafood items such as crawfish and lobster which I plan to try on my next visit.  I have tried the steamed shrimp and personally, it wasn't my favorite.

It is family owned and the staff is awesome. The fountain drinks are self serve, but when it isn't that busy, the staff will come by and refill them for you, and they always make sure that you have everything you need to enjoy the crab picking experience: hammer, bucket, plenty of napkins, lemons, etc. They are some of the friendliest bunch I have ever met.   

They definitely know their crab, heck, they have been doing it for years as a seafood wholesaler to the local Las Vegas restaurants and recently opened their own restaurant, fall of last year.  And I am so glad that they did- because I love to get my crab on!!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,1,4,OK2yruYEzx23vHwXgjOFQA

They also serve beer and have tons of specials; all you have to do is ask what's the special that day.  They're also a great place to watch games.  The owners are from Maryland so the whole place is decked out in MD gear.

When I went here, I had eaten crabs before but never whole crabs and I never had to de-shell one before.  Our waiter was nice enough to dedicate some time to showing me how it was done, what parts were what, and all that jazz.  

The boardwalk fries are delicious.  The same seasoning also goes on the crab if you ask and by itself the seasoning is tasty.

The tables are covered with brown paper if you order the crabs so you can be as messy as you want.  Don't forget to use lemons on your hand when you're done eating though so your hands don't smell all day!

This is a great place to go with friends, family, or date night.  I just wouldn't recommend a first date if you're going to get hands on with the crabs.
