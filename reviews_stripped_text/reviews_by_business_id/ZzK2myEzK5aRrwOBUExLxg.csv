So disappointing. I came here during lunch time and I thought I would never pay this amount of money for this quality of food.

1286910,2017-12-23,1,ZzK2myEzK5aRrwOBUExLxg,"Ate here for lunch and dinner recently and had both meals comped since i was vip there.  Even with comps, I feel like this buffet is very overpriced with limited items. Out of weekday dinner ($32) and lunch ($27), lunch was definitely the better option of the two.

I flew to vegas late and was hungry but i didn't want to wait for food so decided to try their dinner buffet. Place was pretty dead with maybe 3 tables and I noticed they had a guy with prime rib carving area. Salad station was decent but no fruits other than whole oranges, apples and banana. Who the hell wants to eat whole fruits at a buffet? Would prefer if they had sliced melons or some sort of fruit salad.

They have a huge baked potato area and I am not filling up on baked potato, i prefer mashed potatoes so i can control the portions.  I love mac and cheese but their mac and cheese is very bland and it seems like they try to go fancy by adding fancy white cheese to make it more bland.  They also have way too many variations of quarter of a chicken dish over a bed of rice. They didn't have much of an asian station that night.

I think their saving grace is the freshly made pasta and pizza station.  The chef will either bake you a pizza or cook pasta in front of you of your liking.  I told the cook to make me a chicken / shrimp alfredo pasta and he did a very good at it. Unfortunately, the portion size is a bit large but I finished it but was pretty full afterwards.  I know there are probably a lot of other people out there that eats less than half and the rest is thrown away.

To better utilize that station, they should just convert it to have pre-cooked pizza slices and pasta station.  Smaller slices of popular pizza toppings and tubs of pasta dishes. The dessert section was quite limited and a bit disappointing.  They need to add something that looks fresh like bread pudding.

Lunch was much better with seafood paella, tuna, salmon, sweet and sour pork, etc.  Everything tasted more fresh but I went when they first opened.   

Overall, I think this buffet will improve over time as they tinker with the menu.  I would hope to see more asian dishes and possibly some sushi in the future.",WM4a1M41dxM-BFZT5GPDxA,7,0,3,sm-L186ikAh1kqtx0BbbyA

They had items such as fried rice, stuffed red peppers with meat and rice. I enjoyed what I got but not too much selection. I even got salad with ranch, corn on the cob and potstickers. After the food, I had vanilla ice cream and a small tiramisu. Good but not too much to choose from in the dessert section. 

The soda fountain was Pepsi products which is another negative to me. I ended up getting strawberry iced tea.

We started at the pasta station since we figured at least that would be fresh. It was and it was decent. Nothing a little butter and a spoonful of garlic can't fix. The cook added both to the pan before adding the sauce and the noodles. 

Dessert was a huge let down. I mean, if my 2 year old doesn't want to eat his dessert, then there really must be something wrong with it.

2761565,2018-03-09,0,ZzK2myEzK5aRrwOBUExLxg,"Hello Trisha,

Thank you for taking the time to post a comment from my Yelp review.  As you requested a reply from me, I am following up with you. 

As I mentioned in the review, our experience during dinner was not good at all regarding the quality of the  food in relation to the cost. 

Specifically, the overall choices of selection is small compared to other hotel buffets in the area with similar pricing. The hot meat section of this buffet was dried out indicating that it has been sitting there for a long time and the overall taste of the hot food section was bland.  The pizza crust was soggy and so was the pasta (over cooked).  Both myself and my wife had a stomach ache right after dinner.

We compared this to the national chains like Hometown Buffet or Golden Corral and even then at around $12-$14, they had more selections and better tasting food that has not been sitting out for an extended period of time.  The price for 2 for dinner including tax is $64 at your location and we felt that the price was too high in relation to what was offered. 

The people working there provided great service though so we appreciated that.  

We have been to the Spice Buffet, Le Village Buffet, and Flavors the Buffet and for a similar price, they are not in comparison at all to this buffet in which they offer many times the selection and better taste when compared with Savor the Buffet. 

I don't know if you have had the opportunity to visit one of the above locations but it may be a good idea to see what the competitors' buffets are like in terms of the vast fresh selections at the same price point as Savor the Buffet.",03EoH3GPSQTLPYoyjBIQaw,0,0,1,sw1SAsKNGsCAeXxq2cZ60Q
2776079,2017-12-09,0,ZzK2myEzK5aRrwOBUExLxg,"So disappointed in this buffet.  I am a local so I am no stranger to buffets, I also frequent the Tropicana at lease once a week.  This buffet has been in the making for 4 months, I was hopeful but unfortunately it was everything I thought it would be.
It is extremely overpriced $21-$34 depending on lunch or dinner.

The best thing I ate was the pizza, otherwise the selection of food is extremely limited.  There was only prime rib being carved, wheres the turkey, wheres the ham?? I have never been to a buffet that did not have a Mexican food station...the asian station offered 2 or 3 things, and I have also never been to a buffet where there was no chicken; fried or otherwise.  The salad bar (if you want to call it that) was also limited.
There may have been about 5 desserts for you to choose from (are you hearing me), this is not okay. 

I am giving 2 stars because the staff was very nice, I felt bad for them. Since your drinks are ""self service"", and you likely won't be back for another plate, why are you tipping them.  Otherwise, as a local, as a foodie, and a person who eats for free; I would suggest you not go here.

  Tropicana could have and should have done better, or just left the Beach Cafe alone,  just keep open for 24 hours.  Whom ever the food Director is needs to be fired! Don't go here, catch the free shuttle to the M you will get more for the same money and complimentary beer & wine.",0U-SpnLiJrGA3WfpMTlmzA,2,0,2,DgROITQO_yGscBIp-Ecw6Q
2892348,2017-12-02,1,ZzK2myEzK5aRrwOBUExLxg,"Savor the Buffett is the Tropicana's newest remodeled buffet. While it is new, it is still not comparable to the bigger and better hot-shots on the strip such as Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon. That being said, Savor more than holds it own with its limited-but-good buffet selection. 

I had comped meals for both the breakfast and dinner buffet, but I much preferred the breakfast menu ($21.95) over the dinner ($31.95 for weekday). The staff are very friendly, and the bussers clean up your dirty plates very quickly.  

I came away very impressed with the breakfast buffet. I noticed they had used real eggs for their scrambled eggs, instead of that normal spray-can eggs. I really loved the loaded hash browns that were served as well. Their breakfast selection also include bacon, sausage, biscuits & gravy and fruit among its selection. As I said before, there isn't a lot of variety in their buffet, but everything tasted good and fresh. 

The dinner selection was a bit disappointing. There wasn't much seafood available such as crab legs or sushi. The carving station consisted of pork loin and turkey. I enjoyed the create-your-own pasta station, as I created a pesto pasta dish with shrimp even though the pesto wasn't advertised on the menu. The dessert station was absolutely lacking, only a few choices of mini-cakes.

Savor the Buffett is brand new, and still a work-in-progress. The employees here made my experience better, as I enjoyed talking to the omelette & pasta station chefs.

The staff are nice and Took the plates away in a very timely manner. The restaurant itself is kept clean and it has a nice white simple layout to it. The food is extremely high-quality it does not have that 200+ options at some of the other breakfast buffets in Vegas I'm sure you do but what they do have is extremely good. Your fruit selection is very fresh and you can taste each piece and they are delicious. As far as the pacer go so you can tell somebody took their time with them and they are fresh. They also have an omelette bar which I did not use but they do have smoked salmon which is good but just on the salty side. The  price goes it's a little up there it's $47.58 per couple. We did not have to pay due to our two tier statues so it was a win-win for us if we did have to pay I would say once would have been enough especially since we are not the biggest eaters.

1.  WAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the small amount of choices they serve
2.  No ambiance
3.  Small staff.  It was a Saturday night, and they had 2 guys (yes, 2) behind the counter.
4.  They DON'T GRILL YOUR MEAT at the carving station.  WHY?  Because there's no fucking grill.  The meat was RED, and when I asked if he could grill it, he politely apologized, and said they don't do that.  WTF???  How do you NOT grill meat at a buffet that charges you like $30!!!!???!!!  Bad.

Omelette- if you like overcooked eggs with undercooked veggies and under-melted cheese, then this is the place for you!

Pancakes- tasted like bisquick with frozen blue berries. Only one side of the pancake is stale and tough. 

Bacon- soggy, thin, and stringy. I think fast food burger joints use higher quality bacon

Sausage - crispy on the outside, mushy on the inside. Not my cup of tea

""Cherry Bread Pudding French Toast"" - good grief- JUST DO FRENCH TOAST!  This was terrible. My 11 year-old makes perfectly edible French toast. Message me and I'll have him do an instructional video for you. 

Crepes- These were OK. Almost as good as What you'd get as a $4.99 special at a chain restaurant. 

Fruit- not ripe. 

Pastries- Stale and devoid of flavor

Biscuits and gravy - dry biscuits. Gravy had good consistency, but poor flavor. I've had better at budget hotels that offered free continental breakfast. 

Beverages - Apple Juice and Orange Juice were pretty good. The Pepsi machine (no coke products) was nasty. 

Simply put- I would not pay 1/4 of the price to go back here. They executed NOTHING well. Even their salt and pepper shakers were a disaster (take the tops off before you put them on the table, folks.  Otherwise nothing comes out.).",safvbegLNxEN_WT7TSvUWg,1,0,1,9sWc56PaEbyWtvcsvO7Ekw

If you need an affordable way to be able to fill up and skip lunch, this is the way to go :)",7TJarbmD2UfHP2GBDRSN2g,0,0,5,xjZ0pi7poKn3FMKEPV0_xA

5612450,2018-01-21,0,ZzK2myEzK5aRrwOBUExLxg,"For $35 for dinner I expected a far better selection of food. The biggest selection was some Mexican casserole and elote. They had over cooked and flavorless fish. And the dessert bar was nothing to write home about. I'm from Phoenix and the buffets in the casinos back home are far cheaper and have so much more of a selection. On a positive note, the wait staff was super friendly and helpful.",ZCjYWF8gBZZLwrrMAcEmkw,2,0,1,52G5sqUcj3lRe_11VPGQ1Q

Typical dried out items, French toast, fried potatoes, egg dishes, toast, fruit, pastry, juice, coffee. The oj is totally watered down so much it doesn't even taste like oj. Overpriced. $50 for 2 people. The sweet cream filled crepes were good. Go somewhere else if you can.",oVYJtZbKEV_SEuqP-y9pzg,0,0,2,_k7pCyY6PJbBR5JRARL7bA

The waitstaff was very friendly, although it was odd that you couldn't use your card for a tip for the people cleaning up.  I will say it was VERY pricey though.  For a bit over $32, I would expect a bit more in terms of quality and variety.  I'm not sure if I will be back, and the only reason would be the price.",S-oatbN-h7SKiWwkTWw5QA,0,0,3,BaYLpKCwCQEAM_7cCa64_Q
