Side note, they don't serve the fries with the burger.  I get that they are trying to be fancy with the fries, but if the fries are regular fries then who cares?   Also skimpy on the fry sauce.  The onion rings looked great.",y9Uxq2spsnOaF65UTxD00w,0,0,4,4BQiv4Dxhrx37t3UjJ9Cpg

This sums it up - asked the waiter if he could ""Hold the home fries with my quiche"", and he responded, ""I'll have to ask the chef.""  I guess the chef was in a bad mood because I got the home fries with my quiche!  Doesn't stop there ... was never offered more coffee (one cup of their crap was enough ... how you ruin Pete's is beyond me).  I literally had to get up and walk some around to find someone to bring me coffee. 

Don't go there!  Stand in line and wait for Mon Ami Gabi or ANYWHERE ELSE!",z0YOzAhLJZpOCD7OQAI5hQ,0,0,1,F60f_zAr7lQFRnGjiyF_hQ

My Saveur Lamb Burger was very good & my husband enjoyed his NY strip steak as well; but the main thing that our meal so great was our server Nicolette! She told me she's been working at this place for 10 yrs, but once you meet her, you'd think she was a brand new enthusiastic employee! So kudos to Le Burger Brasserie and especially Nicolette - I think she's their reason for 5 star success!",qCeDYgeMx7Yab6hxnHaYLA,0,0,5,Quff2xoXJhGmSHBGzEQQkA

By the time I got my burger it was cold, and completely wrong! They even forgot the bring French fries which was another thing I had to wait for. Aside from when we got there, our waitress never came around and asked us if we wanted drinks or if we needed anything else, she just dropped the check off and went away. I would never go back here!!",A_GRA9tTdZWj_SIraZU8tQ,0,0,2,ruHH3nHhBpZ06VokkEjUog

The stop at the Paris Brasserie didn't have what we wanted but had so many options!   We ordered the Fondue and 3 other desserts. The service, the presentation and the view were exceptional!

It was the perfect spot to chat and linger with everyone, and surprisingly a nice, quiet ""island"" in the busy Paris Casino. The only thing all of us noticed was that drink prices were quite overflated - but heck this is Las Vegas, it's to be expected.  Either way a great time was had :)",WberFMA-8T7Id0ttNUumVw,0,0,4,jGG_Lx0C4Bv8TxH8tBmU0Q

4048291,2017-03-21,0,X8lqAVOWrTih72sEEIEPSw,"Our table had mixed reviews of this place but overall I think everyone thought it was decent. My boyfriend and I got an American and Paris burger and they were both good! The fries were a bit soft, almost soggy-ish but I am not picky with fries. My other friend got the Caesar salad which was drenched in dressing, she actually got sick that night (might or might bot have been from the salad, she does not drink, so no, alcohol was not the issue lol). 

And the service was pretty terrible, we saw our waitress like, twice. The restaurant was pretty empty too so that was disappointing.

At the end of the day, I would not return, there are better burger places in Vegas.",TJNkg75ODHabE5GBfV5wRQ,0,0,3,Dve7wCMxQBaqab82gNFG0Q
4179957,2013-02-04,0,X8lqAVOWrTih72sEEIEPSw,"I hear this place rocked, on par with Mandalay's Burger Bar - but different! So I had to give it a try, because Burger Bar is awesome!

They have a Burger, Fries and Drink combo - Sweet!

Note: If you show your players card, you get  $1 off , WOW a whole dollar. I love how the entire menu has a special blue column for ""Players card"" pricing and everything is just $1 less then the original price. They should just put a note at the bottom of the menu instead of repeating every price. 

Burger: I opted for the Lamb Burger. Cooked perfectly, it was delicious. I ony made it through half, it was so big. I wish it tasted like lamb instead of beef. The lamb flavor was so distinct, it was easy to miss.

Sweet Potato Fries: PERFECT!

Milkshake: Banana, Mmm! Best ever! It looks small but this sucker's huge!

I would definitely return but this place would not be the first place I visit. More of a I have extra time and already went to all my fav's, now what? Place.",ukJIYNNYujvZa5bO4ONvPQ,0,0,3,5BnrTavCXV3QVR1S5Ydzww
4440246,2017-07-17,0,X8lqAVOWrTih72sEEIEPSw,"We had a $25 comped food voucher. Decided to use it here since it was one of the places on the list. We ordered 2 items Togo. 

So the phone number listed on yelp doesn't go to a direct person. Then we called front desk to transfer us, but the phone just kept ringing. So you basically had to walk downstairs to order your food and then sit there and wait. (This is where you lost your first star)

Prime Rib sliders: I loved them. It was cooked to my perfection. We asked for a side of au ju and horseradish which of course is everything you need with prime rib. 

Hot Dog sliders: this is why you lost your 2nd stars. What kind of hot dog was this? It was soooooooo rubbery. I've never had a rubbery hot dog Ever! How do you even get it like that? The crispy onions on top were bomb. The only thing in that dish that was edible was the bread and crispy onions. 

Will I give this place another chance... probably! Maybe we just ordered on an off day, but please figure out a way to answer your phone for take out orders. You'd make more $$$",MpgUFpNlrs1-WhPMJgoadQ,0,0,3,ihywwEOUrdiLB0Dj80NbMA

The girlfriend and I shared the BLT salad and the deviled eggs for lunch.

The salad was great.  The dressing was good.  Just enough for two people with an appetizer added in.

The deviled eggs were ok...some of them were deep fried??? I had never had that, and it did not really add to the taste, but it was interesting.

The service was quick and good - no complaints.",P7XjEZPnJEKdSTMm8LNnhQ,1,0,4,7GvgNQ7gBNE_bCDmAuihrw

I was in town for a business convention and about 10 people went there for lunch. The problem wasn't with the food, but with our waiter. His name was either Ethan or Elliot, but he was an absolute nightmare. He was extremely rude and strung out because of the number of people. He completely flipped out when we (God forbid), asked for separate checks. It has changed my opinion of this restaurant, which is unfortunate.",n09HPrPjgYwDpUSvYEtSRw,1,0,2,pnFthYQGYPfQXVWzp6sN4g

The ambiance isn't great but it's a burger place so you're not going to a fine restaurant. The waitresses were dressed somewhat provocatively but again, burger place. They were very nice and sat us right away. The burger options seemed good and we got le Paris sliders, l'italian, waffle fries and two beers. The sliders were tiny and delicious. The Brie and onions elevated the burger. Best Brie based burger I have had in a long time. The Italian was very good too. The mozzarella was thick and tasty. The pancetta was subtle and not overpowering. And the best part, none of the food was greasy. Just good flavor. Waffle fries were very good too. 

Overall, very good. And at $12/burger, you can't beat it. Great taste and great value.",L_oRjqASIcMJ4cLYHxUxNg,0,0,5,d7zWlrKxZ2OJ7fxetskDFg
