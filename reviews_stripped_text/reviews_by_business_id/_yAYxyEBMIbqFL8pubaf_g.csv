The Spicy Potato Soft taco barely had any potatoes, the spicy chicken quesadilla was sloppy, and the Crunchy Frito Burrito didn't have any Fritos and tasted like cardboard. Taco Bell you did me wrong tonight.",8wqaMe8KTh9HZEAvlX9qdA,0,0,1,KkUNPI-PYmk_kpfJwtAXFw

1632440,2018-06-25,0,_yAYxyEBMIbqFL8pubaf_g,"The best Taco Bell in Las Vegas, maybe the best ever. Every item is always filled to the max, this place never skimps on ingredients. Most Taco Bells will give you a burrito the size of your big toe, but not this place. I also tend to special order some items and they've never messed up my order. The employees have been incredibly friendly every time I've stopped here. Easy to get in and out of the place as well, very convenient after a stop at Apothecarium. The only downside is that they're not open late. The drive thru can get a little busy around lunch time, typical of almost every restaurant.",wWcYYnieCe_UGomeMlWkgA,0,0,5,pXLdtJYfZUsAfJsVUDJXVg

Nice people make your eating experience and mood change completely!!! I would give this location 5 stars if they didn't close earlier than normal Taco Bells.

2295598,2013-09-11,0,_yAYxyEBMIbqFL8pubaf_g,Taco Bell is known for its fast service and this location is no exception. Food comes fresh minutes after you order it and I have never seen this one get too busy. You must get the Dorito's Locos taco as well if you're a Dorito's fan,zBi_JWB5uUdVuz3JLoAxGQ,0,0,4,hy5pmNjeNxPHhIP14VMxCQ

We ordered for a family of four, and although it was a little bit of a wait, everything tasted really fresh and good. If I'm craving Taco Bell anytime I'm near this one, I won't hesitate to visit again for the good food, nice atmosphere and friendly employees!",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,1,1,4,my7N4Qk2q9AUJuMuVENYuA

He wasn't overjoyed with his burrito, but, realistically, he doesn't appreciate when spices are involved.",d19dJ2Dp4sy2p55ppgQaCQ,0,0,4,wyFWkpghPQkd9LdvxZHepw
5000552,2016-04-20,3,_yAYxyEBMIbqFL8pubaf_g,"It's been awhile since I've had Taco Bell so I bundled myself up and drove over.
We've all been new to the job at some point, but this poor older lady could barely walk, and had no idea where the keys were to ring it up.
 Luckily I had a sweatshirt brief around my waist, mostly because I need to lose weight, as the a/C was set at 12 degrees. Multiple people mentioned it while I was there.
 A Spicy Tostado is $.99, less a regular one so I tried it. It has a Chipotle Sauce. The sauce is gross. It tasted like it had gone bad.
 Luckily I had gotten Nachos Supreme, too. They were cold, covered in meat with barely any cheese or sour cream. Liberally sprinkled with tomatoes.
 In the twenty minutes it took me to eat three people tried to bus  my tray. I was using it. I finally gave and took everything off of it so they could have it.
 I'll go back to Roberto's, thanks. This was just gross.",4PFwh5zbgyPhTGRtxkSZZA,3,2,3,vd3R_CJ4noutcRBG1gEC0w
