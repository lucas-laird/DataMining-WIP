DRINK: Free Thai Tea or Coffee when you check-in. Their drinks are deliciously prepared, the Thai Tea is my favorite!

FOOD: Try their lunch specials! $8.95 comes with salad, potsticker, fried egg and one of their selected entrees. I wish that their lunch special came with a choice of soup or salad because their salad is bland. I'm not too crazy about fried egg with my food but I think it's a great option for the customers. I got the Pad Thai, it came with rice and I thought that was weird because a noodle dishes doesn't usually come with rice. The Chicken Pad Thai was very delicious, I highly recommend! Their Yellow Curry is very delicious but they made it with chicken and did not give me an option to get a different meat, I would prefer pork. Their Tom Yum Noodle Soup is really good and comes in either a small or large portion. For dessert, try their coconut ice cream:)

ATMOSPHERE: The workers are friendly in service, but a bit aggressive when they talk. They gave us complementary rice chips. Kitchen took a long time for our meals to be prepared. Their lunch special menu is difficult to understand because it's different from what they actually provide. Also the lunch menu was handwritten and difficult to read with a lot of misspelled words. I think they could use a little extra help with the marketing of the restaurant.

The service was also really amazing! 5/5 Our server was really nice and very attentive to our needs. Didn't rush us out the door when it was near closing and I really appreciate that. 
Their tom yum was the perfect amount of spicy and sour I loved it, and they gave more shrimp than krung does. I also ordered the yellow curry and the portions are big enough to fill you up! Their Thai tea is also really delicious by the way. They do grub hub so you can also order online if you don't feel like going out.

Yelp app made it easy, Googled for an Eat24 discount code to offset the delivery fee. Order was delivered within an hour, food was decent enough that I'm keeping them in mind for a dine-in visit with hopes of rounding review up higher.

DUCK SALAD: Get it, this was our best dish. I'm hoping the dine-in version is a bit larger, but the protein portion was large. I'd dump this over a plate of spinach to make it go a bit further though. Dressing was delicious, a bit on the spicy side but great.
CRAB FRIED RICE: BF's go-to takeout order. This was priced pretty fairly at $13, and there was visible crab but it didn't really have too much of a crab flavor. Portion was slightly smaller than similarly-priced takeout orders from other places.
TOM KHA SOUP: Ordered this with tofu and there was tons, like the whole package. There were also tons of mushrooms. Unfortunately, the broth didn't have a developed flavor. Found tons of lemongrass and ginger in the bottom, so it wasn't for lack of seasoning, but it tasted plain.

Delivery gal was friendly. Order was correct, complete with extra requested hot sauce. They have lunch specials under $10, might have to check those out if I can't resist the duck salad again.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,15,9,3,cjGw0BZokjeKwVjcNi8b0Q

When you look at the place from the outside & because of the location you think ""ummm.... I'm kinda iffy about the place"" BUT it's like those places where you should NOT judge a book by its cover. The inside is very simple w/ some AWESOME chalkboard art work. They also decorated it like what I ASSUME is what Thailand restaurants would look like. 

The staff is SUPER NICE like you are going over to your friend's house & the mom wants to take care of you feeling. I never got our waitress's name even after going 3x but she always wears the authentic thai outfit & she makes you feel at home & well taken care of.

CHICKEN SATE $6.95 - grilled DERICIOUS tender chicken skewers that come 4 to an order. Served w/ creamy peanut sauce & cucumber sauce.

THAI BUFFALO WINGS $7.95 - This was an awesome dish because it was served in a BOWL made out of RICE/ WONTON paper that was deep fried! The marinated flavors were so FREAKEN addicting.

STEAMED THAI DUMPLINGS $5.95 - these were STEAMING HOT Freshly stuffed w/ shrimp, mushrooms, chicken, & water chestnuts. Spicy soy sauce for full on.

SHRIMP TOM YUM SOUP $11.95 - I got a level 8 SPICE & it was soooo sweat dripping good!!!  Just how I remembered it when my friend's mom would make it at home.

SHRIMP PAD THAI $12.95 - OFFICIALLY found my FAVORITE ULTIMATE FAVORITE pad Thai noodle spot. The flavors are just all there!! 

BEEF PAD SEE EIW $10.95 - This dish is simple & just hits the spot w/ the perfect amount of flavor & crunch w/ the Chinese broccoli that is in the dish.

THAI ICED TEA $3.00 - a little on the sweet side but I love it.
COCONUT JUICE $5.95 - kind of expensive but DAMN!!! It is big & sweet & soft meat!!! 
SWEET STICKY RICE MANGO $6.95 - I absolutely LOVE how they put deep fried sesame seeds that are still warm & just crunch in your mouth! 

I will definitely KEEP COMING BACK it's like my goto when I can't think of anything to eat, or if I crave a real flavorful SPICE craving in my mouth!",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,3,4,5,cGT0HNUfxDThOHx6aM7gxA

Thanks to Yelp reviews I wanted to check this place out since people mentioned the owners are from Thailand and having been to Thailand,Thai Town in LA, and married a Thai man myself, I expect nothing but authentic complex flavors. This place is new and opened just 3 months ago so not too many people know about it yet so I'm doing my civic duty of spreading the word and not hoarding this place to myself. This place will be crazy busy in the near future and I wanted to be one of the first few to tell you that I predicted it. :) I ordered the crab rangoon,  Yen-Ta-Fo, and shrimp salad which were bursting with savory flavors and heat. Not overwhelming but just right. Definitely up to par with Thai Town in Hollywood. Give this place a whirl you won't be disappointed. The lady owner is so sweet and if you don't see something on the menu that you want she will make it for you. Now that's someone who believes in their skill and takes up the challenge for their customers. Awesome.",7AZwH142qByRsLlai-2OBw,1,1,5,jthpy5ph8JUgN6QL9q990g

When we arrived, there were no customers in the restaurant, and no staff in the front.  I had to yell out ""hello"" twice to have someone come out, and greet and seat us.  When we sat down, we had another staff come and take our order.  The lady that served us was a little pushy.  She kept trying to recommend a lot of stuff so we would order more.  We ordered tom yum noodle soup, shrimp pad thai, penang curry, pad see ew, and a steamed chicken dish that was similar to hainan chicken.  

The menu had an error so it erked me that they mislead customers.  There was a section about that street food specials and noodles, and it said 9am-4am.  Apparently, it was 9am-4pm.  The food was good, but portions was small compared to all the Thai restaurants I've been to.  Service was slow too because we received our Thai Iced tea after we received two of our dishes.  The penang curry took a long time to come out too.

Will not be coming back.",H-Wxh4IIhDKwJvb1oTzrHQ,0,0,2,toy-UDnboCEQtIv7wY4r9g

5095014,2017-07-01,21,q4i-GbjeSp6ucBDXGE9DqA,"""Dude, this beef noodle soup taste off and the last piece of meat I had almost tasted like liver"" whispers Midwest poker bud leaning across the table.

""Because it was liver and the soup is made of blood"" my matter of fact reply.

""WTF?  Oh come on!"" his exasperated reply.  In my defense, I did say we were gonna have authentic BOAT, not beef noodles he said ""sounds good"".

Pardon the restaurant name, the boat noodles are excellent and the most authentic I've found in Vegas.  Beef or pork blood (depending on which you've ordered) being the key ingredient that both thickens the broth and adds a metallic finish that is oddly ties the dish together.  

The pork, rice noodles topped with tender slices, fresh cilantro, spring onions,  mung bean sprouts and chilies, crispy pork skin cracklings, and a spicy pork and fermented fish sauce broth.  A squeeze of lime for acidic zing.  Excellent.  The beef, sub beef (mystery cut), tendon, and slices of liver for the pork. 
Also great eats.  

Also impressive, the tom yum soup (chicken, pork, fish, shrimp).  Prominent flavor of lemongrass, ginger and galangal leaves, fish sauce complexity, tart and citrusy lime, fiery chili heat, all tempered by the right addition of evaporated milk and cilantro.  While somewhat skimpy on the protein, the flavor is solid.  

Note:  Dishes sampled are from the ""Street Food"" menu.  Dine in only, 09:30 - 04:00). 

Open very late (a huge plus).  Asian service.

Sure the menu has the seen it, done it, pad thai, pad see ew, pineapple fried rice and curries but come on, the adventure awaits.",oeAhRa8yFa9jtrhaHnOyxQ,26,23,4,kDS38l7XhHooBsSUTJ2kew

However this is customary for Thailand as when you eat there they do not bring food at the same time . One of us had the BBQ pork wonton soup .It was good . Another had Thai noodle and it was very good . I had the ground pork basil and it was just like my wife's who is Thai.We also shared a drunken noodles and it was tasty as well.
