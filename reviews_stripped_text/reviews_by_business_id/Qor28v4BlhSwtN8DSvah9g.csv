Visiting NV for some Vegas thing and never discover this place even thou this was not our first time until we met up with some local NV residents.  Now I'm a fan and from now on this place will be the first place to pig out the minute we set foot in NV.  Their food are fresh and full of flavors with each bite.  We had carnitas, carne asada, lengua, cabeza taco and their deep fried tilapia.  Their portion size for taco are so much more compare to taco place in Dallas.  They were all delicious and now making my mouth water just thinking about it.  My only wish is for someone to open Pepe's Taco in Dallas.",6l08zxgmYEDCYU4rqvXDIg,2,0,4,ATNQ92QMrpNrMS4gcxOcWw

$15 for 5 tacos and a bottle of coke?!

First, the tacos are pricey for how tiny they are and with how little flavor.  Literally didn't taste like anything!  I honestly just felt like I was putting stuff in my mouth.

Second, they charge a 50 cent credit/debit card fee. Not sure why they need to do this as their entire menu is already over priced.

Third, there was literally a sign in every direction telling me how to live my life. There was a sign for the extra charge, a sign insisting on cash, a sign telling you to watch how much salsa you take, etc. literally a sign for a bunch of unnecessary stuff, I didn't feel welcome!

I ended up actually liking tacos and the horchata and the burritos, but for some reason we just stopped going here.

There were flies everywhere that kept following my food, which made me sad..since I had to move around the whole restaurant to try to avoid them. Mostly in the afternoon lol.

I have a relatively high tolerance rate, but it pushed me to the edge when we visited the restaurant at 2 am in the morning.. the woman was a bitchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh tho!

The Chili rellenos are yummy as well. The burritos are huge! 
The best part of this joint to me is that it does offer a selection that hasn't been adapted to the American view of how Mexican food should be. Also this is a far south flavor of Ecuador more than that of Mexico. 

The tables are picnic style and the benches wiggle around and most of the signs are in Spanish. So if like me you are limited to asking for a couple beers in Spanish be prepared to enjoy a meal of immersion.  The juke box pours out lively music, I love this place!

My husband and I only tried one menu item this time, sharing the super nachos with carne asada.  The meat had a good flavor and was plentiful, but I was bummed by the liquid nacho cheese topping.  That was the main thing I didn't like in our experience.

We were there around 8pm on a Sunday night and the place was busy with families and couples.  Everyone was just digging into their food - we liked the atmosphere a lot.  There was a jukebox playing upbeat Spanish music.  

Finally some maybe useful info:  they're open 24/7, they serve breakfast (going back to try that some day), you can pay with debit/credit, and in addition to the usual carne asada, carnitas and tongue they offer goat, chicharron, pig and beef stomach meat options if that's your thing.

Today I came for breakfast, so it was one chorizo and egg burrito and two carne asda tacos, which I took home to split with my husband.

As usual, the food was delish, but the only reason I can't give it 5 stars is because the burrito was so dang greasy. Yeah, I know chorizo is greasy, but this was WAY too greasy ... like the tortilla was completely soaked through.

I do love their chile relleno burrito, which is one of the best burritos I've ever had. And their goat tacos are fantastic. So maybe next time I'll skip the chorizo and stick with the chile relleno. You can't go wrong with any of their tacos, which are served street-style in small corn tortillas. And while I've never tried them, the carne asada fries seem to be popular.

Now Mexican food is a challenge in Vegas. While you might assume it's a town loaded with good places, it took us a couple years to find this place. Being a Californian and growing up around authentic places in Santa Ana, CA, I know good carnitas when I taste it. If you're Californian you would understand this as CA is surrounded by the best Mexican food in the US. 

So if you're in Vegas, this is one of the most AUTHENTIC places for carnitas tacos. I mean mouth watering carnitas that make you dream about them in the middle of the night tacos. The meat is soft, tender and marinated perfectly and loaded with tasty lip smacking flavor enveloped in a warm tortilla. In addition, I love the delicious salsa bar and the Horchata drink section as you can drink as much as you want. Big plus.

Pepe's isn't fancy, spotless no matter what time of the day or night you go and it's legit so if you want the best Mexican in Vegas, this is it.

One more thing, if you're going late at night it could be considered a little sketchy area because of the dimly lit parking lot but we never found this to be an issue as everyone from staff to customers has always been incredibly friendly.",hazFjLv3rVO_9V9wSQ55Gw,1,0,5,YgV31GJzzf1dzUeyF_w-8g

You should be ashamed of yourself.
I went here based on fairly good yelp reviews.  
Maybe they had a really off day today?

It was not good and made me very sad. :(
I'm talking worse than Taco Bell not good.
I love Mexican food, I love Americanized Mexican food and authentic stuff.  
I'm from SoCal I can appreciate del taco any day but this was embarrassing.

I was excited walking in because it had the feel of an authentic Mexican walk up.  
I saw some food coming out and I got a bit nervous so we ordered cautiously.  We figured nachos are hard to screw up and the special was soft tacos so we got those too. 
It was not busy but the food took forever!  We finally got our super nachos & tacos and everything was cold.  
They use canned nacho cheese sauce on their nachos.  No joke.  The super nachos had sour cream, bland guacamole, beans and cold meat.  That's it.  We tried steak, chicken & carnitas tacos they were all a bit dry and had no seasoning at all on the meat.  Did i mention all the meat was cold?  
Their salsa bar with a few selections, it was clean but their salsa was not tasty.
Service was average.

Menu items of note:

Machaca plate - the shredded beef was just OK, pretty plain tasting

Chips and Salsa - a rip-off, chips were a bit stale, and of course they don't mention that the 'salsa' that they give you is the same stuff that is free at the bar.  Didn't even have pico de gallo to give me instead.

Service:
Hard to gauge, cause I went there at 6:30 in the morning and was the only customer.

Pollo, Carnitas, Carne Asada, Al Pastor, marinated and grilled meat options that are simple but loaded with flavor. Maybe some cilantro and onion, a simple salsa, or a slice of avocado and lime. Nothing fancy but a nice three to four bite, well crafted, handful of perfection. So when I say Authentic, this is what I refer to. Pepe's is a good sized, strip mall, dive taco joint. You walk up and order. Wait for your number to be called and then get salsa from the salsa bar, some Horchata and sit down to enjoy. I must say also that the Lengua is the best I have EVER had EVER, even in TJ. I literally cryed tears of joy when I ate here.

I have worked in restaurants for over a decade and I've worked in places just like this. I can almost guarantee that the prep cooks here over prep and so there's too much product.

Their salsa bar was a nice touch with the grilled jalapeños - they were spicy, sweet and the star of the entire meal. They also had a red and green salsa, but I only (slightly) enjoyed the green salsa - both salsas weren't anywhere near spicy or flavorful. 

Here's what we ordered:
- Carne Asada Taco - The carne asada tasted average, but I couldn't get past the mouth workout I did in order to chew it. It was way too dried out, burnt? and tough for me to remotely enjoy. 2/5

- Al Pastor Taco - I preferred the flavor of the al pastor the most out of all of the tacos we ordered, but alas the meat wasn't tender as I would prefer it to be. 3/5

- Lengua Taco - chewy with average flavor. 2/5

- Chicharrones Taco - I wasn't a fan. Slimy and texturally challenging. 1/5

- Carne Asada Sopes - is it supposed to be this dry with no toppings? dense and hard to swallow. Sits in your belly like a rock. 2/5

- Chips - stale and soggy. (??) They were disgustingly moist and flimsy. 0/5

- Guacamole - how do you screw this up? (Oh yeah, when you want to cut corners) Served in the tiniest cup and was watered down and soupy. 1/5

- Beans - good flavor. 3/5 

- Agua Frescas: Horchata, Agua de piña, Tamarindo - I suppose they could be refreshing on a hot day, but they were also all exceptionally watered down. 2/5

A foodie friend suggested that we should order the ""famous"" carne asada fries, but we decided there were way too many upsetting fails to even consider returning. I'm not a fan.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,9,4,1,mFaF7xCXN_XJtJ20a8r3og

Their tortas, tacos, burritos are great. Meat-wise, the carne asada, pollo, carnitas, lengua are all average. The al pastor is the best outside of mexico.

Unlike california, where the health-code over-regulation makes it illegal to leave meat out unrefridgerated.........here in vegas they can do it just like the lebanese immigrants to mexico did when they invented al pastor. it's right in front of you on a spit with a pineapple on top dripping juices down marinating it while it cooks

so i dont want to hear any more how much better the taqueria's are in california.  i'm from there. only food trucks are open past 2:30AM

The restaurant is spacious with lots of seating but yes, a little run down and dingy. Everything was neat and clean though. 

We were the only ones in there when we walked in around 3a, but a few others came in after us.

They have a pretty big menu with lots of options. I ordered 3 beef hard shell tacos and my boyfriend ordered the regular tacos, 3 with beef and 2 with chicken. We also ordered chips and salsa to share.

It's an order at the counter and pick your food up at the counter when it's done place. Also, dump your own trays. 

The beef hard shell tacos were really good!! And they were huge! I ordered 3 but didn't even touch the 3rd one. They packed it with lots of well-seasoned and tender beef and topped it with a good amount of lettuce and tomatoes. They have the salsas and onions out for you to put on top of your tacos by yourself. I preferred the green salsa because the red one was extremely way too salty. The shells were good and crispy. 

I don't like soft shell tacos so I didn't try them but my boyfriend did like them!! They also give you a bean dip with chips if you dine in. I've never liked bean dip before but this stuff was actually sooo yummy!! 

For the chips and salsa, they just gave us a box of chips and a big cup to fill with which ever one of the salsas we wanted.... I was hoping for a chunkier, different salsa. Not the same salsa we topped our tacos with but oh well. 

The prices were very fair and the service/kitchen was fast! I don't think the lady at the cashier spoke much English though because I tried to ask her for a freshly squeezed orange juice but she didn't know what I was asking for even though there was a huge cardboard sign about them...

In their establishment they have a sign that reads best carne asada nachos in town. They aren't wrong. They have great food for a great price. I came here for some late night ratchetness and brought along a friend to fatten him up. First thing I notice when I walk in is all the seating. Usually places only have a couple seat for you to wait or a couple tables on the side for people dining in. This location had seats on either side and some cool benches. On Yelp it says they close at 2, but they are actually open 24 hours which I was thankful for. Who knew you could sit and talk in a taco shop for almost 2 hours. I of course had to be fat and order the nachos. My friend ordered some pork tacos. We sat down and waited for our food. I see them all the time and it makes me laugh but they have the posted signs for no refills or there will be an additional charge. I think we refilled our drink like 5 times and nothing was said.. I know they are trying to watch their costs and whatnot but it's like cents per cup. They also have a jukebox that randomly plays music and stares the pee out of you. After getting my food I hit the salsa bar and grab green salsa, my favorite, and some limes. I know it was late but everything seemed kind of empty. I think grabbed the last limes.. oh well. They i opened my box and went in on my nachos. They had everything a little separated which I liked.

I know that is pretty strong praise given the number of Mexican food establishments in town, but when compared to the food I get in Mexico, Pepe's is closest.   

   My personal favorite item on the menu is the Carne Asada. The asada is always perfectly seasoned, quite tender and juicy.  Whether it's on their super nachos in a super burrito or their tacos, it is the best in town. The carnitas is also a great choice on the tacos or burritos as is the birria (goat). On Tuesday thru Thursday Pepe's has a lunch special that is worth checking out. Four double wrapped tacos and a soda for $5.99. It's one of my regular haunts at lunchtime for sure.

Off the suggestion of the wifey who's office is less than a 10 minute drive away from Pepe's Tacos, we ended up going because her officemates eat here quite frequently.  Who knew this little unassuming eatery had a 'Best of Las Vegas' vote!  I was a bit suspect from the outside of things.  But once you go inside, it's a different story.  Place was surprisingly tidy!  Far from the shizzhole I was half-expecting to walk into.  You got me there, Pepe.

Get inside and you're hit with a flash of neon and the shine of aluminum siding.  Menus are smack dab in the middle of the restaurant, and wow does Pepe and crew love yellow & red!  Menus are all done up in this color scheme.  Does kinda make you get hungry!  

Looked over the menu and noticed that it's very similar to other Mexican eats around town.  More on the authentic side of things, less of the Taco Bell/Del Taco/Chipotle sort.  Which I don't mind at all.  If you see a bunch of Latinos eating here, then the place must have SOME sort of street cred.  All good in the hood I say, all good.

I really had it out for one of their 'Super' burritos, so I got one with carne asada.  Wifey was jonesin' for fish so she got the fried tilapia plate.  Kid was in the mood for fries so she got an order of carne asada fries, with guacamole on the side (kid hates guac ever since her incident at El Pollo Loco, but that's another story).  Is it me, or is it kinda rude to tell patrons they can't share a drink cup, and if folks are seen sharing it's an extra charge??  Yes, there is a sign for that.  I thought it strange but we bought TWO cups for drinks where I would normally just buy one so we can all share.  Save some money, right?  I shared a drink with my wife and for once my kid got her own drink.  Oh no, I shared!  Call the Care Bear police!  But really, it's my drink I can do what I want to.  I shared, and I didn't get charged extra.  But I did get a dirty look or two.  Gotta say though, mix equal parts of their pineapple drink with their hibiscus drink...refreshing!  Their horchata isn't bad either.

Food arrives after around 10 minutes which is OK in my book, so I know it's not fast food.  Helped myself to the salsa bar, and loaded up on pickled jalapenos & carrots, sliced radishes, and limes & cilantro as well.  I like color when I eat!

My carne asada 'Super' burrito was alright.  It included steak, beans, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and sour cream.  It was pretty good, but I found it somewhat lacking in heft like I'm used to.  Could have used more carne asada.  I should have opted for the combination burrito instead, which comes with meat, beans, rice, onions, cilantro, and salsa.  Would have saved me $1 too over the 'Super' burrito.  

Wifey said her fried tilapia plate was tasty.  Came with a nice sized full fried tilapia, rice, beans, lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and a side of flour or corn tortilla.  Fish was fried just right, not oily and not overcooked, very juicy.  Beans and rice were nothing out of the ordinary, but their fresh made tortillas were delicious.

Kid was happy with here HEAPING mound of carne asada over some fat French fries.  Fries were cooked well, not soggy, and covered with copious amounts of nacho cheese (oh yeah definitely from a can), steak, sour cream, and guacamole (on the side of course).  She liked them a lot, but got full after about half an order.  Leftovers!  Nothing like congealed blobs of meat & cheese over cold potatoes later.  #drunkeats

I wasn't overly impressed with Pepe's Tacos but I did enjoy the taste of their food.  For us, it was cooked fresh & right.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come here for a burrito, but if I was in the neighborhood (oh man that would be rare) I would stop in for a bite to eat.  Or maybe a drink.  That I will share.

4499997,2011-07-10,0,Qor28v4BlhSwtN8DSvah9g,"I have been having a tragic time trying to find SoCal style Mexican food here in Vegas.  There are Roberto's, but not only was the Roberto's franchise not my first choice in San Diego (there are so many better taco shops), it's hit and miss here in Vegas -- each one is a little different and all are just slightly different than the ones in San Diego.

In my quest to find something like I'm used to, I read that Pepe's was much like SoCal -- and it sort of is.  It's not the same, but I think nothing will be the same as actually being there, so I just need to judge based on what I got.

I ordered the carnitas and I have to say, I was super unimpressed. The meat was bland and fatty and didn't have that salty crispness that carnitas have.  The tortillas were good, though, as were the rice and beans.

My boyfriend got the enchiladas and he's super picky about food, especially enchilada sauce, but he really loved them, so that bumps it up from 2 stars to 3 for me. Finally, enchiladas he likes.  He wasn't wild about the chorizo burrito he got another time, though.

The service was fine, albeit a little chilly in the ""never been before/what a gringo"" department, but adequate.

I will never understand why Nevada taco shops don't offer chips and salsa. People look at us like we're crazy whenever we ask for chips and salsa to go.  No place I've been here even HAS salsa, just hot sauce. I find it so strange.  They did offer chips, though.

I'd go back, but I'd likely just order tacos or a simple bean burrito. It didn't wow me.  But then, I'm just a gringo who grew up a stone's throw from the border, so what do I know? ;)",eH5cPO1SV9hTVktzenjYgw,0,0,3,42rghGh_1DFu4VpJF8V6bw

I was just at Pepe's the other day (late June 2011) with some work people. They have increased their prices on the entire menu. They have a little paper notifying you of that near the cashier that says it is due to the economic climate that we're in. 

Before, a big reason for their appeal was their value. It was a great deal, specially when compared to Los Tacos on Sahara or Charleston. That is still the case now, but less so. 

In regards to their food? It's still pretty good. It's not going to wow you, but you should be pretty full off a super burrito with carne asada (my fav).

Overall you can order anything with the carne asada and it will be great. The carne asada is finely chopped and has very minimal fat. They season their meat very well, not to salty nor to bland. The add a side of beans and tortilla chips.

Yesterday I went to find my ""local"" post office to pick up a package during my lunch break. In doing so I discovered a great little Mexican joint called Pepe's on Decanter. 

They have great big signs that caught my eye. I figured, I'm hungry, tacos sound good, let's try it out! When I opened the door I read they were voted the best in Las Vegas 2015 so I was getting pretty optimistic on this find. I ordered the 2 hard shell pulled beef taco and soda lunch special for $5.10. I also picked up some chips and salsa since their salsa bar looked so yummy (see below). My order was to go since I was short on time. 

When I arrived back to work I broke into the tacos almost immediately. The one shell was cracked but the flavor was exceptional so it was the least of my concerns. I trickled some of the smokey, spicy, homemade salsa I had for my chips on the tacos. It made my taste buds do the happy dance! They were SO good! If anyone is looking for some quick, authentic Mexican cuisine, stop by Pepe's. They have 4 locations around town.

I'm a native and I took some other locals there for the first time, and I was embarrassed to have taken them there after we sort of ate the crap that was bundled up in a tortilla. 

I had the carnitas, and my friends has the carne asada.  Both were loaded with unedible cartiledge, and my carnitas had bone fragments in it.  The rice was nearly raw throughout both burritos which was mixed in with some other over cooked rice.  This probably means that they are mixing old product in with new product.  NO BUENO!  Maybe the Clark County Health Department needs to do an inspection of the facilities to ensure proper use of cooked food.  Its obvious that there is a lack of training on behalf of the owner/management if they are even around to oversee at all.

The first thing that impressed me was how hot everyone's food was.  Usually when you get takeout and you get it home it's all cold and soggy but everything was still piping hot. 

I got the double cheeseburger with fries and a medium drink ($5.99). 

I gotta tell ya...their fries are bomb.  They are the thick-cut kind and they fry them up real crispy and then toss them in salt and seasoning.  Absolutely wonderful.  

The burger was actually pretty good, too.  It had two patties, lettuce, ""special sauce"" (like thousand island), cheese, and tomato.  It was hot and gooey and really great.  I know what you're thinking...why the heck did you get a burger at a mexican place?? Well, I am la guera. 

Minus one star cuz' both of my co-workers ordered chicken burritos and one of them was given chicken and the other got carne asada.  She couldn't eat it and would have went hungry if it weren't for my other co-worker who very kindly switched with her.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,0,0,3,lX3qeMhrVqX1Fc4Yw5a0KA

Only a promoter or someone who doesn't know better would rate it above movie theater food type quality.  
 After close examination of all the ingredients...
-Meat was poor quality and skimpy.
-Smothered in Super cheap nacho cheese
-Guacamole mostly filler
-Sour Cream ok
-Fries ok
And thats it... nothing else on it! 
Charging $10.50 and claim it to be the best.",4FIN5i-xk8d5GoF8ikjAKg,0,0,1,7pRRjTPDTsPy6L4wN4F08w

They also have these french fries with beef and cheddar cheese, man those are enough to fill you up! They are also reasonably priced also. I recommend them to anyone wanting to try authentic Mexican local food!",KCD6daAp293FoOUoTjT_YA,1,0,5,k60uBCMHVEWGD0xjpeADBQ

This food is so perfect! The price, the quantity and well..... Locations could be better but I get it.... It's a demographic thing. 
Carne asada tacos are super.

5848461,2012-03-18,5,Qor28v4BlhSwtN8DSvah9g,"OK so this is really a fun review I am excited to add to my Yelp collection!

At approximately 2am in the morning my Yelp buddy Jon calls and invites me for a bite out. Yes, even though I was already in bed relaxing watching tv, I accepted his invite as I am very spontaneous and always ready to stuff my mouth! OK so I got dressed, he was at my house in 15 or so minutes and we were on our way headed to Pepe's!

I had eaten here once before pre-yelp days. This time was most definitely Yelp worthy, we were craving tacos so tacos we had!

First off they are open 24/7 to satisfy our late night and early morning munch cravings!

The tacos were good, I ordered a chicken and asada soft taco plate which came with rice and beans. My pal ordered birria soft tacos which were delicious, I have never had marinated goat meat, he gave me a taste of his and those were yummy as well.

Reminds me of the street and truck tacos you can get in town, definitely better than the other more commercial Mexican food joints around. 

We had fun sitting, chatting and grubbing! Although the food was great I still have many other taco joints to check out!

Mmmm until the next mouth stuffing rendezvous I am out :) Peace!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,8,7,3,qXK9L0O3_Gq6tfCMfDINqg
