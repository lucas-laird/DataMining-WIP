Today the Lil short dude with orange hair was messing it up then the taller dude finished and messed up and tried to charge me wrong. Why is there two people that don't know how subway work even on the schedule at the same time. Also these tables are dirty as hell and it's 630pm on a Wednesday so being busy isn't an excuse since there's nobody else in the restaurant.",LAcxLXhZcm2lQulLGs3hyA,0,0,1,NjUiy5svyDPoJTCQsTiT4Q

Thought I would try a breakfast sandwich and a donut.  As it turns out, this is a Winchell's/Subway combo, so this Winchell's didn't carry breakfast sandwiches, just the donuts, I guess because Subway already has their gross breakfast sandwiches.  Boo Subway, so I just got an apple donut (which was decent) before having to go elsewhere for more breakfast.",RFczbCw_rRF2etK-nUpW2w,0,0,2,uoxPctr5_SVD-iijbmsH_Q

I will say, they shouldn't advertise for avacados when they really just have some pre-made guacamole'...and an attitude when you ask for it.",uZ4z-4ftg7LbGR_blmZTow,0,0,4,3VvU9bMlii6Gc_XBgfbkaQ

I'm hoping he's not by himself and hoping someone was on break or something because we waited in line for awhile for a older lady with 2 kids that was picking out donuts which took FOREVER!!

3785900,2014-12-30,0,YPCbxsAPYOo3kRMbhfxFzw,"Set the scene: We were the only guests in the restaurant, it was Christmas Eve about 10:30 am. Employees were slow and acted irritated that we came in. 
My daughter has the same thing every-time we go which does not entail a lot in the way of toppings. Turkey, shredded cheese, tomatoes and mustard. The Subway rep was extremely skimpy on these toppings despite my telling him twice that is all she will get on the sandwich. He begrudgingly put a little more cheese on her sandwich. The location we typically goes to will give her more as they know that is all she will have on the sandwich. The employees (there were 2 plus the manager sitting in the dining area doing the books) were extremely slow in making the 3 sandwiches.  The one employee making our sandwiches was irritated when I asked for olives. The olive container was empty and he put 3 olives from the container on my footlong sandwich and asked if I wanted more.... Yeah! DUH! I want more. It took them 20 mins to make 3 sandwiches. I also wanted a Dunkin Donut and coffee and he said he would have to make that a separate transaction, so another 10 mins passed before I got that. RIDICULOUS!  Terrible service.",__O_vpFaO1E3Ham_pnB0VA,0,0,2,pXxLUuloIQzZXK4-uN6D5w

Will I return?  You bet I will.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,2,2,4,Bl5TK3VXcC0DfW30cSYZyA

The outdoor patio is perfect for a Sunday morning breakfast. The food is as it is in any other Subway so not much to report there. This Subway has a Winchells Donuts attached to so it has the best of both worlds. The customer service is what you would expect from Subway. Not sure if that's good or bad.
