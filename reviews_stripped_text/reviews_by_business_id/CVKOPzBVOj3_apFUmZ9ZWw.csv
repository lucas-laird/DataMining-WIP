My husband and I were there on a Saturday night, so it was busy, seating was limited and people were hovering over others for seating/tables. I finally found a table on the patio and the weather was perfect. Our food took a while, but it's understandable since it was a Saturday evening. The fish was amazing - very light, crisp, and delicious - 5 stars for the fish. The chips, not so much, my chips tasted like they were old and stale.  I just couldn't eat it, had about 3 fries, and ended up tossing the rest. Overall, overpriced for ok food.",f4leP16tfSE_WkxhV834KQ,0,0,3,YY3fg41wF6f5pKX3J3AmLA
25813,2016-10-26,2,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"So being huge fans of Gordon Ramsey and most of his shows, we decided to check this place out. So where to start ...... 
1. If your thinking your going to sit and eat, WRONG! there's like 3 little tables and a bar against the wall with maybe 5 stools.
2. The fish was good, but very greasy. Fries were nice.

All in all I thought (with Ramsey being as meticulous  as he shows he is on TV) this place would be a lot more than it was. I know it's in Vegas, bet where else to display yourself. I left satisfied that I ate, but disappointed in the execution.  Gordon Ramsey, you can do better. 5 restaurants in Las Vegas and you couldn't spring for room for your customers?

My boyfriend and I weren't all the hungry but wanted to try the fish &a chips, so we shared an order. $20.00 for a fish & chips combo, including one drink, and an extra drink. They have a cool Pepsi machine, similar to the Coke Freestyle machines, but unlike the Coke one you are able to add up to three different flavors. I stuck with just abnormal Diet Pepsi, I know boring. Once we got out order I was even more excited, until I took a bite. The fish looked amazing fried to a golden brown, but the bottom side of he fish was soaked in grease! YUCK! I could hear Gordon Ramsay's angered voice and I took a bite. I could barley finish the one piece. It seemed as if they didn't even give the fish time to drip off the excess grease. I stuck to the chips and my soda. Safe to say I left only semi-satisfied and disappointed.",R_BKOYf9ZBykeDXoWw0gAQ,0,0,3,S9jE7Zwrr0F6tpxdWJrW5A

If you saw Gordon FB Live the grand opening he was right: this is NOT a sit down restaurant. It's a take away fish shop. Very limited seating. The line to order was out the door at 7pm but it went quickly and I ordered in no time. Beers on offer are written on a greased board at the register. They serve Pepsi products only and two lemonade flavors. I chose Orange Vanilla. It was light & refreshing but after awhile it was just too sweet for me. My order arrived quickly. It's a very simple menu so wait times are short. 

Fish was good & flakey. Breading was just right. A bit bland but that is where the dipping sauces come in. You get two. Fries are fresh and good. No complaints. But with any fried food it gets heavy fast.

Honestly ridiculous ! 
You may like it of course but English it is not ! And that is stupidly disappointing for someone that has high hopes from a well known English cook. 

What a waste of time ! 
Fish was ok but not battered in traditional English style either and three small pieces instead of one decent size is also typically un English, so representative of real fish and chips this is not and again I invite mr Ramsey to point to where he has had over cooked crispy fried chips from an English chippy ?

830405,2017-12-26,0,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"As an ex-pat living in Colorado I am constantly on the lookout for some decent fish and chips. They are extremely rare in the US. Sadly, Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips is no different from any other poseur fish and chip restaurant, with the exception of being rather expensive and over-priced. The chips were average, but needed that something extra that true British fish and chips provides. I think it is that GR's restaurant, like most other places in the US use inferior potatoes, potatoes that do not fry well. To date the only place that has come close to real British chips is The Codmother in San Francisco and they use Kennebec potatoes, maybe you should use those too, Gordon? Unlike most people who have frequented GR's fish and chip shop I did not have the fish but instead plumped for the sausage, hoping for a British style sausage. Again, sadly disappointed. First, the sausage was battered, which personally I cannot abide and think it totally unnecessary, secondly, the sausage supplied was not, to me anyway, a British style sausage, but some hybrid with the texture of a British sausage, but the flavour of some poncy high-fallutin' lump of sausage meat, which had been messed about with and no doubt someone, somewhere, thought that their recipe had improved the sausage but in fact had made it sweetly flavoured, which as anyone in the know of British sausages knows, is not right. And also, just to add insult to injury, the two sausages were about two inches long and served impaled on wooden sticks. Although this is twee, it is not how a proper sausage should be served.
To sum up then, not British fish and chips, not British sausages, hugely overpriced, not worth it, generally. Would not bother going there again.

The chips were terrible, they had a metallic taste to them. I am not sure what type of potatoes they used but it was bad. 

I was born in the US with parents from Birmingham England. I do not call myself an expert but have been to England a couple dozen times. Besides Balti my first thing I get is usually doner meat and chips so I do know chips. If Gordon served these chips in England he would be out of business in no time.  I am a big fan of Gordon Ramsay expected much more. I will stick with my local chippy in Alhambra CA.  I think it is the best in the states.",8OHVLVwO4fefc005rd3clQ,0,0,2,eVL8w4UG7OkrOV3xCCCGKw

920618,2016-11-27,0,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"I visited here on Monday 11-21-2016 and I have to say I was highly disappointed. After eating at burgr at planet Hollywood and Gordon Ramsey Steak at the Paris hotel which both of these experiences were excellent, this was not anywhere near Gordon's standards. I ordered the fish and chips. Fair price for the food you get. The batter tasted good but the fish itself had no flavor!! Very bland. The ""chips"" were your average French fry, i expected a more authentic ""chip"".
I also got sick from the fish, not sure why but I had a stomach ache and bloating for a day after eating here and that was not pleasant to be sick while on vacation.

 I always eat fish and I'm not allergic to it so I'm not sure if it was a fluke or I actually got food poisoning from the fish.
They also forgot my order. I was number 371 and all of a sudden they are calling 372...373... etc. finally I went to ask the seemingly annoyed order filler and he tried to tell me to wait but I had to speak up and say you missed my order.
The cashier was nice and helpful. The people filling the orders and cooking, they all looked pissed off. Yeah they were busy but them all looking mad didn't help the ambience and the guy handing out the orders seemed annoyed to say the least. 
This place is not up to Gordon Ramsey's standards or has he just finally sold out?
I will never go back here I am sad to say. Sorry Gordon but I am sending you to your room because this place should not have your name on it,  bloody hell man it's more the level of a Long John Silvers.",S_BHNa0zqgUT-ZPmVK9UqA,1,0,3,1ctli3CWoZf5v9Fw_mKBKA

SETTING: Located at the Linq Promenade, Gordon Ramsey has opened another restaurant in Vegas. This place is a small shack next to the Flamingo Casino entrance. The restaurant only has about 15 seats so don't expect to have a seat if you eat here. It's more of a grab and go restaurant. I love the decor of this place. The British theme fire hydrant, the telephone door entrance/exit, and the red and blue everything! The staff is super funny and friendly. Best part is they are super organized. No matter how busy and long the line is, you get your order in less than 10 minutes.

FOOD: Yes, their chips are fries;) Their fish n' chips combo is their most popular. It comes with fish, chips, and a drink. For fries, you have three options of dirty fries if you don't want them plain. You can chose between two pieces or three pieces of fish if you chose to get fish. One of favorites from this restaurant is the fried shrimp. The shrimp is really big and great in texture. They also offer the Fishwich. The Fishwich is a pida bead with arugula, tomatoes, and a fried fish. Lastly, your order comes with your choice of two sauces. All sauces are made to perfection, but my favorites are the Ramsey Tartar Sauce and the Sriracha Mayo.

DRINK: Get one of their lemonades! It's worth it! You can choose between the Orange n' Vanilla Lemonade or the Peach n' Ginger Lemonade. Both are great.

OVERALL: This place is a great grab and go restaurant. I don't recommend coming with a large group because you won't have seating. Food is simple, nothing too special. Love the atmosphere, the boxes of food, and the organized staff. Great place to have a quick meal.",LTCxnnAQGaGZPHZx4KbvGA,6,8,4,68-J-FGtvrUOHV3P4vOM_w

They had a small menu but lots of varieties within it. I went with just the fish without the chips. One order of fish came with 3 pieces and I could choose two sauces to go with them. The sauce that drew my attention was the curry & mango. I thought it was a very interesting combination so I got this one along with the original tartar sauce. Since there were no one waiting, our food were ready in an instant. The lady who handed us our food offered to put them in a bag. She said it was dangerous to walk outside with the food out as she had seen people just run by and steal the food. I thought it was really nice of her to do that. 

The 3 pieces of fish were on the smaller side as compared to the ones I had in other restaurants. I personally thought they were too burnt. The actual meat of the fish was better. It was juicy and flaky but there wasn't much flavour. I had to rely on the sauce to add flavour overall. The mango & curry sauce was very tasty though, both elements were present and they worked well together. The tartar sauce was standard, nothing too spectacular I thought.

First of all, the decor is great. It's well-designed. It's a small, fast casual place, but they make good use of the space. 

The service is very friendly. They seem to have a good sized staff, so no one gets too frustrated waiting. 

I ordered the chicken combo with dirty #1 fries. The chicken originally came out a bit raw, but the expediter caught it before she gave it to me. They refried the chicken, which took longer, but I was appreciative that I didn't bite into raw chicken. 

I have never been a big fan of beer batter, but this is really well done. It is so crispy and not at all soggy. The chicken must be brined, which I enjoyed. It does seem to be a combination of white and dark meat. I would prefer straight white meat.

The dirty fries #1 were good. I enjoyed them, but I do wish they had a bit more spice. I was expecting more of a kick, since they have jalapeños. I also did not expect onions, but I just ate around those.

My dining companion had the fish and chips. He really enjoyed the fish, but he felt the fries were too salty (I liked them, but I like salty).

Overall, it's a good place. It's expensive, but you're on the strip and at a restaurant attached to a well known name. I expected the higher price.

My boyfriend and I both ordered fish and truffle fries with the tarter sauce; he also got the sriracha aioli and I ordered the southwest ranch.

The portions initially appeared small, but filled us both up upon finishing. The total for the two of us was $36 with the truffle fry upgrades, which was entirely worth it.

The batter around the chicken is not too thick, not overpowering the chicken meat itself. I have tried their Curry & Mango, Southwest Ranch, and Gordon's Tartar sauces. The Curry & Mango, my personal favorite, has a light smokiness to it from the curry flavors; their is also a hint of sweetness in the sauce that is only noticeable when you really pay attention to the sauce. The Southwest Ranch has the flavors of your favorite ranch, but it is up-scaled with a kick of cayenne pepper, giving it a smokey and slightly spicy flavor. Gordon's Tartar sauce is a classic and the acidity from the lemon juice gives it a light flavor that has a good contrast with the chicken. 

For the fries, I have tried the regular and the Truffle, Parmesan, Chives fries. They are both delicious in their respective manners. The fries are able to keep their crispiness even at the end of the meal when you have finished your chicken and fish and their are only a few fries left to eat. They go well with the sauces as well but are great on their own; no ketchup needed! For the TPC fries, the slight earthiness from the truffles is evident in each bit of fries. The sharp and nutty flavor of the parmesan flavors the the fries well and offsets the earthiness of the truffle flavor. 

Once I even took some Chicken and Chips home (about a 30 minute car ride) and though the food was room temperature at this point, they were both still very crispy! I highly recommend everyone to try this place out if you are at The Linq. Even if you are full but you are with some friends, split a 3 piece box of Fish or Chicken and Chips and taste what real English Pub food should taste like.",FQbVI3UyKlL-HfQGcRF8aA,2,2,5,gfGH1ABXZ5j7Vl04UCjgiQ

I am going to be brutally honest, I expected so much more & my mother, who has no appetite due to chemotherapy, craved fish 'n chips.  Tides & Tommy Bahama at GVR has way better.  

I ordered two Fish 'n Chips, both w/ the Tarter Sauce, one Mango Sauce & SW Ranch.  Truffle Parm Fries & regular Sea Salt.  Two Merlots, a Chardonnay, peach ginger lemonade, regular lemonade, $66.   I am not trying to waste time, money or calories, but I feel I did both for a special occasion.  Also, as we waited for our number to be called, we started to smell something fishy.  The Truffle Parm Fries gave my mouth a bad taste & I wished that I  had a toothbrush to brush it off.  The inside of the fried fish was nice & flaky, but there was zero flavor.  I needed vinegar, hot sauce or seasoning to fix the flavor problem.  

I am truly disappointed & rate him as my number ONE chef's because of his outstanding restaurants here.  I love them so that this one experience has no impact on my opinion of him or his other restaurants.  I will not be back to this one.

1383710,2016-12-30,2,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"After trying the fish and chips at the Pub & Grill in Caesar's, I was so disappointed. So imagine my excitement when I saw this shop dedicated to ONLY fish and chips pop up in the LINQ promenade. I was ready to give Chef Gordon a second chance.

The decor of the shop awesomely UK-themed. You know how there are some places that are just oozing with American flag decor everywhere? You won't miss this place as you walk down the alley -- just look for the British flag, telephone booths, and British flag-painted fire hydants. 

When we walked in, we were greeted nicely and the workers helped guide us through the menu. The fish and chips can be ordered on its own or as a combo (which means it comes with a drink). We decided to get the combo with sriracha aioli and southwestern ranch (recommended by the worker) and a sticky toffee pudding shake (which was an additional $5 -- discounted by a couple of dollars because of the combo).

We got our shake first. Every Gordon Ramsay restaurant in Vegas has its own rendition of the classic English dessert, but this was definitely not a winner. (Pub & Grill in Caesar's is still my favorite.) It was a bit too sweet for our liking, but definitely thick like a shake should be.

Then, the glorious fish and chips were ready. We got three hearty pieces of deep-fried fish fillet sitting atop a bed of perfectly fried chips. Each piece of fish was piping hot, crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside, and absolutely what I imagine the best fish and chips to be. The fries were also crispy and golden. Having a variety of sauces in addition to the traditional tartar sauce also makes this place stand out, especially since I'm not a huge fan of tartar sauce.

Totally worth it if you're looking for a quick but filling bite! (And definitely worth it if you're a GR fangirl like me.)",Ok4JzVqlcGmQ0ZzoIld8aA,4,3,5,LFn6sQsWRgdJSTNhiujoAg

1464511,2017-11-29,4,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"Pros:

Fish: The Alaskan cod fillets was moist but the batter really made it a good battered fried fish. The batter is slightly seasoned and fried to nice a crisp and it does not overtake the fish. My boyfriend is from Australia and easily gave this place 4 star for taste and so far it's been his favorite spot for fish and chips in the US. But in his hometown of Brisbane, this place was an average 3 stars, so if you're from abroad with a plethora of fish and chips joints, then you're better off eating elsewhere. 

Sauces: I was happy that they offered sauces other than tarter since I hate the taste of tarter sauce. I was pleased with the mango curry which has a little bit of heat from the curry spices. 

Price: It's more a fast food type of restaurant with cheap pricing IMO considering everything else on the strip is pricey. I got the combo which comes with fries and a drink and upgraded my fries which is well worth an upgrade for extra flavorful fries and upgraded my soft drink to their house made lemonade which I would skip on.

Cons

Lemonade: I upgraded to their peach and ginger lemonade which basically tasted exactly like their lemonade from their soda fountain. They have an option to spike their lemonades with grey goose for double the price but you're better off getting a tastier cocktail elsewhere.",-pzlhxN6-DtuvpX4blnTxw,6,9,4,Wu4EYNEfCa4iMRFcCZ-FcQ

It will be hard to miss it because of the nice ambiance in and out of the restaurant. 

Went here with 5 more people just us excited to try this place but not highly recommended for big groups because they have less than 20 chairs inside the restaurant. Yes, this place is tiny. There were about 6 chairs outside to eat but this place is new and crowded.

Menu is small and kinda confusing at first but Alex was kind and friendly enough to help us and he explained it well to us. Service here was so fast. 

So far this place is: small, could get crowded, confusing menu but not only just service that was great also THE FOOD!!!!

It came with 5 jumpo huge deep fried delicious juicy shrimps, ""too thick for me"" well-seasoned fries, 2 great sauces of you choice: the tartar sauce was good, mayo was alright but i tried someone's mango curry sauce and it was to die for, and for my drink i got peach and ginger lemonade which was so refreshing, the other was vanilla orange lemonade which i tried a small taste.. also good but i could only pick one.

I tried their fish also and it was WOW! battered and deep fried perfectly, great taste, fish was fresh and melts in the mouth.

this place is best for quick bites and to go to take to your hotel if the restaurant is already packed.

The fish itself is perfectly cooked, tender on the inside with the lightest batter I have ever eaten.  I usually pull this stuff off, but it was crisp and brown and complimented the texture of the fish.  The chips are so-so.

Walked in here and was excited to have fish & chips. Their menu is pretty confusing as in that the first part of the menu shows their ""fries/chips"" for 5.99 or something and i was like wow pretty good price for their fish and chips but really it was their $5.99 fries. In the middle of the page, it shows their fish and chips or shrimp/sausage/fishwich/chicken. Their price varies from 13.99 to 15.99 depending on what protein you want. 

I got the 14.99 fish and chips + extra $ for changing their regular chips to truffle fries/chips. Really none of it was worth it at all. The fish was way too oily and the fish itself lack a lot of seasoning. I suppose you are suppose to use their sauces but their sauces was pretty underwhelming as well. The Gordon's tartar sauce just taste like any other tartar sauce. The curry mango was okay...I'm not sure if it really match the fish and chips. I kinda end up using ketchup to dip my fish at some point or like I would switch upon the 3 and kinda prefer using the ketchup...

The truffle chips/fries wasn't anything great either. As I mentioned before, the fish was oily and if the fish was layered on top of it, the oil just kinda made the chips/fries soggy. No bueno. this is more of a personal thing but I much rather have the small fries/chips than their med size fries/chips. 

At the end of the day, I just thought it was overpriced for how much they gave you but everything about it was just lackluster in terms of taste and quantity. I will not be back.",SqjP1cV8JwDdN0K9QULzog,5,2,2,am5XSfQwE-3YzoKPjNM1mw

Though every article announcing the opening emphasizes that this is a small grab-and-go style spot, it wasn't too tiny and I was able to snag seating at the outdoor bar area. The repurposed phone booth entrance is a fun touch, and service was friendly. 

The fish and chips (3 piece, $12) was a large portion with two dipping sauces- the sriracha aioli was good but GR's Tartar sauce was great, wish I'd tried the curry mango sauce, too. Chips were saltier than I expected but the fish was in large, flaky pieces. 

I got my guy the fish-wich, which was surprisingly served in a pita. This didn't really work, with breaded fish wrapped in thick dough, but I guess the flavors were okay if you're into carbs on carbs on carbs. The shishito pepper was unexpected and didn't really work, either. We took a few bites and tossed it.

I liked all 3! The fish is juicy, and the batter is not too oily. The fried cod is not salty on its own, so the sauces are important. The fries are nothing spectacular.

The gf and I were visiting Vegas so we thought we'd check this place out. Got the fish and chips, with the truffle fries.
Fries: Felt overcooked. I don't know if that's how they're supposed to be (hence the name ""chips"") but I would have wished for just a little less crunch. Also bland. If it wasn't for the truffles, this would have tasted like nothing.
Fish: Bland. The quality of the fish seemed decent. The batter was good. But why is it so bland? It really could have used salt and pepper. I don't think they used any at all. Coming from a restaurant with Gordon Ramsay's name on it, this is disappointing to say the least.
Price: Way overpriced. 3 pieces of fish and some fries for $15... Never again

The shrimp was nicely done as well as the chips(fries) I also ordered the Peach & Ginger Lemonade which was very good the only downside to this meal was the price, but I guess because of the novelty of the Gordon Ramsay name and the fact that it's on the Las Vegas strip made it more expensive then it would normally be.

This review is only for the fries. I ordered the truffle, Parmesan, and chives fries, which comes with your choice of 2 dipping sauces. I went with the sriracha aioli and curry mango. The sauces are exotic for sure and may not be for everyone, but they grew on me. The fries were crispy but they didn't have much else going for them. They lacked flavor and the toppings were not evenly distributed (e.g., there was a huge chunk of chives in one corner of the box and most of the fries were left more or less bare). I felt like they definitely could've executed better, considering it was almost $8 for a small serving of fries, and this is a Gordon Ramsey restaurant, but hey. 

I did enjoy the British vibe all around; it almost reminded me of being back in Europe. I don't think I would go back just for the fries again but they were definitely better than the fries I had at in n out the night before.

It's located in the Promenade at the Linq somewhat in the middle of the shops. I wasn't sure what to expect. Would it be a full on sit down restaurant with waiters? Would it be a little takeaway chippy shop like you would find in England? Turns out to be a combination of both. You can stand in line, place your order then wait for it at the end of the counter and hope you can find a seat at a table or outside on the railing counter.

The prices weren't too bad considering it's Vegas and a Chef Ramsay joint.  A fish combo with a basic drink can be had for $14.99. I obvi decided to upgrade my drink to an import beer (which was a short pour btw) for $5 more.  Eating and drinking anywhere for $20 in Vegas is not a bad deal really. I am used to getting nickel and dimed for the most part so getting a bit of a value put me in a non horrible mood.

I was expecting to get a large piece of fish but instead was served up 3 smaller almost fish stick sized pieces. Also, wasn't sure what to expect for the fries but they came out nice and crispy and very tasty. They reminded me of fries I would get in a Canadian fish and chip shop. Definitely not similar to an authentic fish and chip shops in England but that's fine with me, I'm not in England after all ffs.

All in all I was very satisfied with the whole thing. How can you really screw up a meal where everything is deep fried though? Load that shit up with Malt vinegar and ketchup and we're good to go!

The ordering and picking up is a bit of a clusterfuck and could have been thought out better I think. Would I go back? Maybe. Maybe not. There are so many choices in Vegas I am not sure. I am just glad it was tasty and I have been to all Ramsay places in Vegas as I am a yuge fan.

To make it more English authentic they need to offer gravy and charge 20p for a packet of ketchup. Yes can you believe that shit? Fish and chip shops in England hose you for a bloody ketchup packet!!! UGHHHH!! Also, it was very clean. If you want that true Brit chippy shop feel everything should be coated in grease and dirt.

We had to get original Fish and Chips on mind to try.  The fish had a nice light breading and wonderful flavor.   You have several options as far as dipping sauces to accompany the seafood.  The fries (chips) had several options for toppings.  In the interest of science we wanted to see what they were like plain.  Well...  that was probably a mistake on our part.

The shrimp is placed on top of a large amount of fries. I've gotten the truffle and parmesan before and it was too heavy for me but it was really good!! This time I got the bacon bacon cheddar fries (yes, bacon is said twice), and I was impressed! It has real cheddar on the fries and chunks of bacon. Crazy!! My husband got the spicy fries and he loves them! 

So..then the magical moment arrives..when I can bite into a beer battered fried shrimp! Yeah!! I put it on my fork dipped it into the southwestern ranch sauce, put that beauty in my mouth and I didn't want the moment to stop. Mmmm...just simple, fresh, and good quality. Gordon Ramsey always has fresh meat so I can guarantee that the shrimp was never frozen. The batter gave a nice crunch and the shrimp had a bite that said it was cooked but not over cooked. 

The southwestern ranch sauce is my fav. It had a smoothness that calmed down the oil of the batter. My husband loves the curry mango sauce. I do have to admit, that sauce taste just like curry. So awesome! 

Come here with your camera ready, take pics with your food or just of your food...and enjoy the experience.",Y7LNldoENmAignc9S37t6g,6,3,5,EpY_oRUN6fTBLLJZGBYvVQ

The big England fish at the entrance is very cool. Then the menu is very easy to read and it has very simple choices. I got the fish and chips with Gordon's Tarter Sauce. The service was excellent. About 2 min after I ordered it was set and ready to go. I was very impressed because everything is cooked to order. The food itself was outstanding. The fish was totally fresh, because you can taste when fish is fresh. Got me that is a big part because I hate when restaurants have frozen fish because it doesn't taste as well. The fries were hand cut as well. After tasting many fries you could tell the freshness of the fries by the taste and the presentation of them. Gordon's tatter sauce was stellar. I normally don't like it but the way that all the flavors mixed was just amazing. It also wasn't to overwhelming where that's all you tasted.

1656748,2016-11-10,1,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"Gordon Ramsay is one of my favorite chefs, but man, oh, man.  This is how I'd rate his restaurants in Vegas starting from the best to the worse:  

1.  Steak
2.  BurGR
3.  Fish & Chips
4.  Pub & Grill

Fish & Chip was honestly not all that impressive.  I don't know if maybe the place is so new that not everything has been straightened out yet?

Fish & Chips is located in the Linq Promenade.  It is not hard to find because the doors are red and look like English phone booths.  There is also a fire hydrant with the British flag painted on it.  Fish & Chips is a super tiny fast food type of joint where you line up, order & pay at the register and wait for your number to be called indicating that your food is ready.  There are tables and seats on the outside as well as the inside, but not enough for the number of customers that this place brings in.

The line was pretty long when we were there, but it moved fairly fast.  There is a large menu behind the registers so as you're waiting, you can see what is available to order so when you get to the front, you already know what you want.  Also, while you are waiting, you can watch the cooks preparing the food in the open kitchen to the right.

The menu is very small and simple which made ordering a little bit easier.  My bf ordered the Fish & Chips Combo which came with chips and 3 pieces of deep fried fish covered in batter for $14.99.  However, we paid extra to upgrade our chips to dirty #1 on the menu which is chips covered with chipotle, jalapeno, and crisp chorizo.  I ordered the Fish & Chips Combo and replaced the fish with sausage and upgraded the fries to dirty #2 which is chips with truffle, parmesan, and chives.  With each combo comes two sauces so we were able to choose 4 sauces altogether.  We chose curry mango, srircha aioli, southwest ranch, and Gordon's tartar sauce.  Not to sound like fatties, but we also decided to try out his Peach & Ginger Lemonade and Orange & Vanilla Lemonade which was $4.99 each.

As we were waiting for our food to be ready, I was looking around on the inside and outside of the eatery for a place to sit down and eat.  All of the tables were occupied!  There were maybe three tables and some counter space on the inside and maybe two tables outside of the whole place.  To be fair, Gordon did say that this place is not meant to be a dine in place, but how inconvenient is that when you're dealing with greasy foods?  I'm not going to take my greasy food and attempt to find a place to eat it elsewhere.  After scanning for tables like a hawk, this couple finally got up and I quickly took over their table.  The table was of course greasy and with crumbs all over the top because it looked like no one was there to wipe down the tables or anything.  It's basically a place where you sit and eat then you clean up after yourself.

As for the food, I really enjoyed the dirty #1 chips with the chorizo.  I thought that was different and it surprisingly went well with the chips.  I'm not a big fries person so that says a lot if I enjoyed it.  As for the fish, the bread was really thin and was falling off of the fish.  I have never had authentic English fish & chips before so I don't know if that is typical for the bread to fall off of the fish?  Anyway, it was kind of annoying trying to dip the fish into the sauce and then only being able to eat the fish since the batter had fallen off into the sauce.  The sausage and the truffle chips were okay as well.  It didn't blow me away.  As for the sauces, my favorite was the sriracha aioli.  The rest of the sauces tasted exactly how you would imagine they would just by their names.  Gordon's tartar sauce honestly tasted just like regular tartar sauce.  I liked the Peach & Ginger Lemonade way more than the Orange & Vanilla Lemonade, but they were both very sweet and I'm not a sweet fan.

Trust me, I'm no cheap skate when it comes to food as you can tell from my Yelp reviews, but I thought this place was overpriced for 3 pieces of fish and 2 sausages.  Out of all of Ramsay's restaurants in Vegas, I would rather go back to Steak and BurGR.",2Hs4XM3ENjn5WTNfjM86-A,1,1,3,Iivna57O0B8oOYmClAWWoQ

If you read the board in front of the registers you'll see their beer list, etc. as well as ""ask about our secret menu."" We did and it was a super good deal on shrimp, fish and chicken with fries and a drink all together. I loved the sauces so much, we got the sriracha aioli and English mayo which is basically lemon aioli. Everything was so fresh and absolutely delectable! The staff was really nice and super helpful. They have the cool pop machine where you can make all kinds of crazy pop flavors. The decor is really neat and so fitting of the English/ Gordon Ramsey theme. The reason why I rated it low was because of seating. The limited seating and the crowd was so off. It makes for such a bad combo when you have hangry people who fight over seats, this one couple today is so lucky my boyfriend values his job over the seats they took from us or we'd have had a brawl. It's also annoying that people will save seats while their other person ordered because when the line is this long you shouldn't be allowed to save seats: the people in line ahead of you have time to get their food and eat and leave those seats by the time you order and get your food so saving seats is truly unnecessary and annoying as fuck.. #ihatepeople",QHWEZV4RvMVpU-EuG74FjQ,0,0,2,Fsr58-t-XgORz5dpt-DpGg

You get three pieces with a bunch of fries and a drink for approx $14 USD a box, from a price point it's a great deal but the fish lacked seasoning. You have the option to choose 3 different sauces, I was a little curious to find out how Gordon Ramsey's tartar sauce would Taste and I wasn't really impressed with the tartar since it was bland and I mean zero taste... the mango curried sauce was pretty good (probably because I make the exact same sauce at home) but it pairs better with chicken rather than fish. They need to come up with a better sauce selection for the fried fish, a blackened sauce would be nice or just a zestier tartar sauce could save the day... think outside the box! Make your sauces more interesting and alive.

 While waiting for our food, we found a seat for just us two. Our food came in no time, yet, unfortunately they got our order wrong.

 don't order ketchup as one of two sauces you can select with your fish n chips. Ketchup is free and self serve.

The drink machine is one of those cool ones that you can customize (eg, add lemon flavor to your Coke). The fries are cooked well.

Second time, I ordered the Dirty #3 on the chips side. The chorizo, jalapenos, and red onions are a plentiful. Flavors of the Chipotle sauce are noted through the entire box/dish.

The interior also smelled like sour milk because of all the tartar sauce in the trash. Food-wise, it pains me to say this, but the little fish and chips place by my house makes better fish AND chips. The batter was flavorless and only mildly crispy, the 4 sauces we tried were bland, and the fries were 75% soggy.

+VALUE: For a combo that includes fish, chips & sauces, you can't beat the price. 2 meals and 1 drink nets my boyfriend and I about 24$. It's a great deal for the Strip!

+DECOR: It's always clean and the decorations are really slick and have character. There's a photobooth thing that you can use while waiting in line.

+LOCATION: It's right on the strip in the Linq, and there is some seating (not much) inside in case it's super hot. (Side-note: we went this past weekend and I felt like the 'alleyway' the shop is in is cooler than other parts of the strip)

+SERVICE: You don't have too much interaction with the staff, but they are always happy to provide you with more sauce, bags, etc. if needed

+TASTE: I'm a bigger chicken person than a fish person, so I get the chicken chip combo. The breading on the chicken is different than the fish and I personally enjoy it more! The chicken breading has some good seasoning and chives embedded into it, something I hadn't seen before. It made for a great taste!",0Y87ZjxctwwN6QKElBP2Vw,0,0,5,o5bwN8zv6-KtN6mhghRLqA

Overall this restaurant was good, not amazing, not the best I've ever had, but definitely good food! Being on the strip in Las Vegas it is not cheap. When my husband and I went recently it was nearly $50 for two entrees, and two beers (both domestic). 

Speaking of food, the menu is as expected consisting mostly of fries and fried entrees, which included: fish, shrimp, and chicken. I personally had the fish and it was cooked perfectly with a lovely, crispy breading. My husband had the chicken. The breading for the chicken was also very good, with herbs/seasoning mixed right into the batter. It was certainly tasty! However the chicken itself was only decent. Nothing too special. We both enjoy the plain, natural cut fries which were also very tasty. For each entree you also receive two dipping sauces. We tried the house tarter (which was good), the sriracha aioli (it was meh), and the southwest ranch (this was also good). I really enjoyed having a nice variety, but was disappointed that I only really liked the tarter sauce option.

You'd think a celebrity chef like him would not have time to pay attention to all the minute details of his restaurant empire, but he is one super chef that has managed to do it all.

I'm a huge fish and chips fan, so my expectations were pretty high. This is probably the best fish and chips that I've had in the US (gotta give my top to London).

Right when you get in door, you instantly smell fried goodness.  The line was long but moved relatively fast. This is a fast food type restaurant where you order at the cashier and pick up at the counter, but totally gourmet food.  There are different combos that you can get, and you can upgrade the fries and drink. 

Fish and chips: Very crispy battered fish, straight out of the fryer and piping hot. Tastes great with the tartar sauce or the curry sauce, and there's malt vinegar too if you'd like. The fish wasn't as moist as I would like, but still very fresh. Must try

Fried shrimp: not your average fried shrimp. Huge shrimp with perfect seasoning and deep fried. Very expensive and not too filling, but worth the splurge

Fry combo #1: Seasoned well and not too spicy unless you eat all the jalapeños. We upgraded our meal and it was soo good

There was no line when I got there.  There were only a few options, but that means they can focus on preparing and making their best food.  It turns out to be true.
The combo was a bit pricey, I think, especially for just fish and chips.  Those turn out to be really good.  The fried fish was hot and fresh.  The fries were one of the best I have had - favorable.  One can add money to get their special sauce, but I got the standard sauce, and it is just as good.
They do not have a lot of tables and chairs, which is a minus.  There weren't a lot of people when I got there, and I had to wait a while for a table.  When I left, there was a long line for ordering food, and people had nowhere to sit down.  This is a minus.
When we were there, there were a crew of photographers outside taking pictures of the food.  That is fine except they occupied one of the already few tables at the restaurant.  They should have been more considerate of other customers.
All in all, it is a good experience.  It is a bit overpriced I think for just fish and chips, and the quality of food makes up for it.  The restaurant should be able to use some more tables and chairs for its customers.",n0OnBQC1uChnrgcKPGYytA,0,0,4,DMhMA3SyXln1kTxh0p-Hhw

Normally that means I'm in for a let down , but must say , This place delivered.

So the location is right in the center of the Linq promenade. You can also come out of the flamingo and exit to the promenade and it's to the left.

From the time you first see the outside it's very cute and represents Gordon's roots very well. The fire hydrant, huge sign, red doors, you can't miss it. It's very small , and would probably be extremely busy on the weekend.

We came on a Wednesday and there were already no tables , so plan to have someone scoping out a spot to sit while someone else orders.

They have a simple menu while also offering a variety . The sauce choices here are amazing. I am not a fan of tartar sauce yet the ""Gordon Ramsey tartar sauce"" was absolutely amazing.

The fish and chips is 5 stars and I've had fish and chips from Maine. 

Love the presentation as well. The newspaper box lining, sauce containers, very nice. Prices are very reasonable as well. Very nice to be able to eat at a Gordon Ramsey place at a reasonable price and still get the 5 star tasting food.

Didn't think so. A British classic off the strip in the little walkway towards the Flamingo Hotel. The storefront is everything you'd imagine a fish and chips place to be, the familiar solid red, white and blue with the front doors replicating phone booths. But with the Ramsay named attached I'm sure it's one to be spotted rather than stumbled upon. Not a lot of seating on the inside but there are a few tables outside shared between the other eateries as well so it's easy to get nab a place after getting your food to go. 

Fish and Chips ($11.99) Sauces chosen:: Southwest Ranch, Ramsay's Tartar. Tartar sauce is the way to go.

We definitely hunt for good fish, and usually wouldn't come to the Strip just to pick up food but they were worth it.

The menu does not give you an option to get the fish by itself. So you always have to get the fish AND chips together. Next time if I decide to go back there again, I am going to ask if I could just get the fish by itself only.

Yes, the menu is a bit confusing but long story short you can have fish, shrimp, chicken or sausage and fries aka chips. For an up charge you can upgrade the fries and it comes with 2 sauces (you'll have about 5 options).

Yes, just like the other reviews say, the food is oily but it's FRESH out of the deep fryer. I'm no rocket scientist but I patted it down with a few napkins and it was fine. We ordered fish n chips and shrimp n chips, we upgraded to some spicy fries and had one beer. We had tartar sauce, Siracha Mayo and cocktail sauce even though it's not on the board. Everything was great. The only fish n chips that I've had that are comparable would be (of all places) the Cheesecake Factory. 

Dinner was almost $50 including tip. After we paid there was a short wait followed by the struggle to find a place to sit. It's a small place with few tables so we just sat outside on some tall bar stools. 

The complaints would have to include:
*Portion-MORE SHRIMP PLEASE (at 5'5 130lbs I easily could have eaten twice as much)
*The nearly frozen cocktail sauce-tasty but it was thick and literally nearly frozen
*The lack of seating-the name Gordon Ramsey alone was going to bring folks in, they could easily fill a large pub with customers and to fit us into such a small space with little seating makes no sense
*Ketchup-if you give me fries, give me ketchup, it shouldn't be an option on the menu, it's a given!

We were so disappointed!  The choice of fancy dips didn't make up for the lousy, overpriced food. I eat my fish and chips with malt vinegar anyway!! I remember walking out of there shaking my head thinking what a disgrace to the Union Jack box it was served in.",v-Pi3ptHiwq8-huQx-fvFg,0,0,2,_DY4fnk3OoGGuJL-bRBauA

Line was almost to the door, but it took us about 10-15 minutes to reach the front. We ordered the standard fish & chips ($15.99), which comes with a soda. DH wanted a ginger peach lemonade and he was able to upgrade for another $1 or so. We got a cup for water which was only 49 cents...a steal by Vegas standards. Seating is very limited. I was able to snag a table by the door.

They seem to be quite efficient. Gordon would be proud (and he wouldn't need to cuss the staff out). Food was ready quickly. Everything was hot and crispy. The batter on the fish was incredibly light and crunchy. There were 3 pieces of fish - more than sufficient for a meal. Fish seemed to be cod, fresh with a firm texture. The fries were just like classic ""chips"" - crunchy on the outside, hearty potato on the inside. Lots of options for sauces, but we picked the chipole aioli (really good, but more garlicky than spicy) and tartare sauce (classic). They also have ketchup and malt vinegar with the utensils.

We weren't that hungry and split one order. So full and we couldn't finish the fries. The couple next to us ordered one combo per person and they couldn't finish their orders. This stuff is quite dense!

DH says, ""I think the best part was the fish batter, that was light and not overly greasy. The fish itself was not overcooked. It was technically well executed."" DH thought the lemonade was way too sweet. The flavor combo did have potential. Not a good value for $5 since it's just a regular size drink.

Would we go back? Probably, but we do want to try other restaurants first.",CXl9uMlh4PTold4MxVku2g,1,1,5,eghBE7HJZohgxIxyRv-Unw

- Fish & Chips with natural salt fries (Gordon Tartar and Sriracha Aioli)
- Peach and Ginger lemonade 

What started out promising ended in an epic fail. 
I had hopes Gordon would nail a dish like fish and chips. 

I was wrong. So wrong. The fish was crispy and the cod was absolutely fresh. However a heavy hand of salt made my plate of food unpleasant. 

To be fair only the fries were oversalted. To the extent each fry was laced with crystals of salt. Way too seasoned for my taste. 

I did like the Tartar sauce as I could taste the fresh fennel and it paired well with the fish. The Sriracha Aioli lacked heat and was slightly sweet. 

The let down to continues with the Peach and Ginger lemonade. It tasted neither of peach or ginger all my pallate could discern was lemon and sugar.

My Chips/Fries were done to perfection not to crispy but just right we all know me I love crispy fries. Not to sure what the seasoning was on them or how they we're made, but they we're dam good. 

I also ordered some kind of dessert that was like peanut brittle, but it was chocolate with I think hazzle nut's not really sure what it was but I can tell you this I didn't share it.... for it was pure heaven.

We ordered fish and chips combo ($14.99) with sticky toffee pudding shake (+$5 w/combo) and an order of shrimp ($12.99 for 5pcs).  Fish and shrimp were battered perfectly, light and not greasy.  The fish was a little salty, probably from the chips.  Our shrimp that didn't come with chips weren't salty and had the same batter.  Sticky toffee pudding shake was rich and delicious.  If you like sticky toffee pudding you have to get it.  For sauces we chose Gordon's Tartar Sauce, European Style Mayonnaise, Curry & Mango and Sriracha Aioli.  I loved the sauces.  They also have a southwest ranch and artisanal ketchup I didn't try.  

Seating is very limited.  This is a takeaway spot so if it is busy and you don't want to walk and eat (their packaging is designed for this) just ask and they will bag it up for you.

It's in the Linq so if you're about to go on the High Roller but you're hungry, I recommend coming here. The place is very limited on tables so if you come with someone, have one of you wait for food and the other find a place to sit! It's cool because you can watch your food being made. We were greeted by Taylor. She was the cashier and she was very nice and knew what to recommend. She offered to have us try a sample of the different shakes so we can decide on that as well. No matter which of Ramsay's restaurants you go to, ALWAYS get a shake. They're my absolute favorite. 

So you can pick from fish, shrimp, sausage, and chicken here. We both wanted to try fish so we both got the fish meals. For $1 more, you can upgrade your fries from standard fries to ones that have certain seasonings. I got the cacciatore and basil fries while my boyfriend got the chipotle, jalapeno, and chorizo fries. There's a lot of cool dipping sauces to choose from.  You can pick from sriracha aioli to curry and mango. I love that you have multiple options because most of the time you just see ketchup and tartar sauce! Now for the shakes, we tried the biscoff shake and the toffees and brittles shake. It was probably the hardest choice of my life, but we ended up getting the biscoff one. It tasted just like a gingerbread cookie so it was a little hard to resist. The fish was amazing. It's perfectly fried, great flavor, and you can tell that it's actually real fish. The fries I got were great, just had a lot of basil. I honestly preferred the chorizo ones that Chris got. It wasn't spicy at all which was what I was worried about. I can't handle spicy foods at all so the fact that you can actually taste the jalapeno without it being spicy made it better to me. The shake was just amazing. If I was at the Linq and wanted a shake, I'd come here of all places! 

For the two meals and one shake was about $42. That includes the upgraded fries as well. It's not too bad but not the cheapest thing ever. Also keep in mind that this place has all Pepsi products, it's okay though because you can just get beer if you don't like it! All bottled beers are about $5-6 so they're fairly prices.

As HUGE Gordon Ramsay fans we had the goal of visiting all 4 of the Gordon Ramsay Vegas restaurants (Steak, Pub, Burgr, and Fish and Chips). Saturday night around 9:45pm we decided to give Fish and Chips a try! After visiting both the Pub and Steak I had high expectations when it came to service at anything with the Gordon Ramsay name on it. Upon arriving we were immediately greeted and able to order. I had explained to the guy behind the counter that we were visiting all the restaurants and after having the sticky toffee at both pub and steak, I couldn't wait to try the shake version here. He went on to tell me how great it was and how it is his favorite. I ordered the fish and chips (you can't beat a classic) and told the young lady taking the order that I would like the toffee shake as well. She then proceeds to tell me how they already closed down the shake machine for the night. Its 945pm on a Saturday in Las Vegas and they chose to start packing up shop? I understand the want to begin closing with only an hour left in your day, but to take the only dessert option you have completely off the menu for anyone to order because you decided to close it down early.... REALLY?!?! .... and to do this on a Saturday a prime day on the strip after I walked all the way there from my hotel specifically for that shake was very disappointing.The part that was worse, is after I order it and am informed that shakes are no longer available, there was no sympathy or care.

The sticky toffee milkshake was awesome, just probably not the best in combination (I suggest something more refreshing to avoid an overload of creamy and fatty)

You walk in and get in line, the line was short for us today which was great. There is a video machine on the wall that you can play with while you wait, it was so fun as you can see the video you made and then you click [send] and enter an email and off it goes. That in itself made the trip almost worth it LOL I love that little video machine we made three videos and it was our turn to order. My friend and I both ordered Fish and Chips and that was $16 each. It was fun going down the assembly line watching the guys make the food and the little setup it comes out in is the perfect little box of goodies. The fish is white and light and was tasty. The batter on the outside sort of tasted a tad sweet to me, kind of like a pancake batter. It came with three pieces of fish and fries. They have three kinds of ""dirty"" fries you can choose from, I chose the cacciatore spice w/fresh basil fries. They were tasty. My friend ordered fries with sea salt they were your basic fries. The food was good, one bummer was as busy as they were, they should know they need someone in the diner at all times cleaning up stuff. I am sorry to say the visitors that were leaving while we were there were not cleaning up after themselves. Is there some country where you just get up and leave your garbage on the table and walk out? Because wherever that is, that is where these visitors were from. I was shocked that the guy next to us took the box and threw it away but left his empty drink and napkins on the table - I was like deer in headlights as he just walked out the door. So it was a bummer when we found a spot at a barstool type bar facing the wall that there was trash askew that we had to clean up in order to sit down with our food. That was a bummer. Half way through my meal I had to get up and go let the manager know, the gal behind the register told me the manager was the chef - so he came over and I let him know there was trash on the floor, trash on the tables, trash next to me where I am eating because some I had to push away rather than handle it and worse of all - the trash can itself was over flowing. Ugh right? I was trying to make it through my meal without complaining because the food was good, but I couldn't do it. So I told him and he acted so surprised! ""There is trash on the floor?!!!?!"" I was like .. uh yeah! So he and another gal came out and began wiping down tables, and cleaning up the diner. It lets me down when a place has great food and is dirty, all the hard work put into the food is kind of worthless if the dining room is a mess. I could just imagine Gordon walking into this place with his name on it and the trash visibly over flowing out of the can.  In this case, the great food outweighed the mess and I enjoyed my visit, and I hope those that work there learn, in a busy Vegas establishment you got to have someone working the dining room at all times.

Unfortunately, I was very hyped to try the sticky toffee pudding milkshake. The sticky toffee pudding at Steak was one of the most divine pieces of food I've had in my lifetime. I was expecting a milkshake with a big chunk of pudding blended in, but instead received a pre mixed shake straight out of a machine. This was disappointing as it had NO flavor of the dessert I so deeply love. It tasted purely of whipped cream, so that was disappointing. The fish was $15 for three rather small pieces.

The place is quite small with two 2-tops and one 4-top and some counter seats inside.  Additional counter seats are outside the restaurant.  

Small menu with five items: fish, shrimp, chicken, sausage, fishwich + chips.  Each combo comes with a drink and two sauces.  

There are five sauces to choose from: Gordon's tartar sauce, sriracha aioli, curry and mango, SW ranch and Dijon mayo.   

Ordered the fish and shrimp combos and upgraded one of the chips to dirty #2 (Truffle, Parmesan, chives).  I was expecting it to be good given Ramsay's name but didn't expect it to be this good! Freshly fried with crunchy batter and nice moist piping hot fish fillet inside.  Most importantly, it's not RAW! Shrimps were just as good.  Tried four different sauces of the five except the SW ranch.  I liked all of them but my faves were the Gordon's tartar and sriracha aioli.  

The only complain I have would be you only get 3 pieces of fish and size varied.  My box actually has about 2.5 pieces because the third piece was half the size of the other two.  I looked at my neighbors  and their three pieces were bigger than mine, bloody unfair!

I've been to a couple of his restaurants in London but both of these were way above my dining expertise. Found this place by accident on the way to the High Roller ferris wheel and it sounded like it was right up my alley. Which, by the way, is located in an alley.

Fish & chips. You can't get more simplistic than this although there are other things on the menu such as chicken and sausages.This is a stand up and order restaurant which I don't usually like but I endured it anyway because of the man's food.

The wife and I decided to tag team our meals so she ordered the chicken and I had the fish and chips. Every meal includes two sauces so I chose the mango-curry and the sriracha Aioli and the wife chose the Southwest ranch and Gordon's Tartar sauce.

Bloody Hell! The food was awesome. I've had fish and chips everywhere in England but never none as good as these. The whitefish alone was nice and flakey with the best breading I've ever had. Got to dip the fish in all the sauces, which, were all delicious, but tasted the best with the sriracha aioli......but that's just my opinion.

Tried a piece of the wife's chicken and the breading on that was amazing too. Oddly, the chicken tasted best with the tartar sauce. Never tried that before but I did now.

I saw some other things on the menu such as the Dirty Chips (Chorizo and Jalapeños) that I will definitely try next time I'm in Vegas.

OK. Pros and cons.

Cons: 
Long line, stand and order, limited seating.

Pros:
Awesome food. 

So quit bitchin' about the long line and seating. Get your food, find a spot on a curb or the fountain, and enjoy the best fish and chips as you people watch.",t4cRy5hYQKzYVnzbUmC58g,4,3,5,iqWXjkBziFqdj1prYX3Nhg

The fish and chips are pricey...like $14.99 pricey. If you want to upgrade your fries to gourmet fries it'll cost you another $2. Do I recommend you do that? Why yes I do. 

This isn't a standard fish and chips restaurant where they just slapped a famous person's name on it. The fish was great quality and the fries were so delicious (I got the truffle fries). There are also a variety of sauces which are pretty good to choose from. Are the sauces Chick-Fil-A sauce good? Not quite. But still good nonetheless. 

My friend had the shrimp which I didn't find as delicious as the fish, but it was still good as it wasn't over battered like other restaurants that I have had. 

The Lowdown: If you like fish and chips, give this place a shot. Keep in mind that this place closes at 11PM, which I find to be a travesty considering it is the strip in Las Vegas. The place is located in the Linq alley on the way to the big ferris wheel.

It's fish and chips, how could it go wrong, right? But here, they prove that it can get better. The batter is different, different varieties of dipping sauce, and house made lemonades.

I had fish and chips with tartar, Sriracha aioli, and orange vanilla lemonade on the side.

Visited there around 5:30pm on Saturday. Seats both indoor and outdoor was fully occupied. Line was long but moving quickly.

We placed order. The wait time wasn't bad ether, probably about 6 or 7 min.

We couldn't find any seating indoor and resorted to sit at outdoor table for an Italian gelato store (?i think) across the street (the table had sign designating the table for that gelato store, but they didn't seem to mind us sitting there as there were no one from their store needing seating at that moment).

They give you plenty of food. 3 good portioned fish and a lot of fries. I couldn't finish all the fries.
Batter, which my husband describe as ""like funnel cake"", was very light and fluffy, yet crispy and crunchy outside. Fish inside was cooked perfectly, very juicy and flakey.
The highlight of this place, I think, is dipping sauces. Tartar isn't your ordinary tartar. Sriracha aioli is good on fish or fries. My husband had mango curry and European style mayo for sauces. They were good too. My #1 was Tartar, #2 goes to Mango Curry.

To have the opportunity to actually try his food was beyond anything I could have dreamed unfortunately, upon trying it I was disappointed. We stopped in for dinner last week. When we walked in we were greeted by a very fishy smelling storefront, which I thought was fine. It's a fish joint. It should smell like fish. The girl at the counter turned out to be a fellow Missourian so we chatted for a bit as all Missourians do, about the weather. So far so good. The food was ready quickly, we both ordered the fish and chips with a few interesting dipping sauces. We sat down outside on the front porch and took our first bite into the infamous Gordon Ramsay's fish and chips. It tasted like nothing. No flavor to the somewhat mushy fish or to the oily and bland batter. The chips were okay. Not great. We didn't end up finishing our food. It was tasteless and greasy. Instead, we went next door and had a hotdog. I feel like this wasn't the best sampling of what Ramsay has to offer. Based off of everything I've seen, this wasn't up to his standards let alone mine. I wouldn't try the fish again but I would venture to one of his other restaurants and see what that's like.",W2DtBklLwXaFDUEj1NZfDg,0,0,2,vKzGGVf_eKaLkWV_I6kbSg
2936087,2017-03-28,9,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"First order of business while visiting Vegas this past St. Patties Day was to have lunch at Gordon's Ramsay's Fish & Chips however I ordered no fish. I had shrimp on the mind so Shrimp & Chips is more like it. 

The menu is straight forward with your choice of battered fish, shrimp, chicken or sausages. The fries can be ordered plain or can be prepared three types of ways which then they're considered dirty fries. The ""#1"" which included chipotle, jalapeno and chorizo caught my attention so I had my chips prepared that way. In addition to the shrimp & chips, I ordered sausages on the side.

I was given some nice sized shrimp. I enjoyed both the taste of the shrimp and the batter that was perfectly crispy. The flavor of the shrimp is enough to hold it's own without dipping into any sauces but you'll be missing out if you choose not to. I tried four sauces (mango & curry, sriracha aioli, European-style mayo, and Gordon's tartar sauce) and the sriracha aioli was the best adding a lot more flavor to the shrimp. 

The sausages were good but the sauce within the sausage takes away from the actual sausage flavor in my opinion. A thin beer cheese sauce is the best way I can describe it. They're good enough to try and possibly order again, however don't think sausage flavor and think of a flavor more along the lines of a cheese stuffed hot dog with the texture of a sausage if that makes any since. Last, the fries were decent. I'm glad I ordered them dirty. I tried a friend's fry which were plain and can say mines tasted a lot better. I couldn't tell what the chorizo was prepared with but it looked like little cheese crumbs. Not sure what it was but it tasted good. 

Fish is within it's title so I couldn't go without at least trying a piece of a friends fish. It tasted pretty good but do prefer shrimp. In general, shrimp over fish any day for me. I had a great lunch and it was a nice way to kick of St. Patties Day in Vegas. I'll be stopping in for more shrimp.

We Both went with the Fish & Chips because that is what you get here.

We got three pieces of battered Cod. The batter was done very light and was very crispy. The Cod inside seemed very fresh and was moist and meaty. The Chips was very good too and were moist but not soggy. You can pick up malt vinegar but you also get two dipping sauces with your platter. Between us we tried 4 of the sauces they offer. My favorite dipping sauce was the Gordon Ramsay Tarter Sauce. At the time I thought it was the best tarter sauce I've ever tried...
It had a great yummy creaminess to it with great flavors. 
I also thought the Mango Curry Sauce was MIGHTY Delicious but too aggressive with the fish and enjoyed some of the chips with it.
Sriracha Mayonaise was tasty.
Dijon Mayonnaise just tasted like aioli or maybe that gave me the wrong sauce?

This is the least expensive variation of Fish & Chips that Gordon Ramsay offers. (14.99)

We were looking for something quick to eat for lunch and stumbled across this great fish and chip shop. This was my first time experiencing a Gordon Ramsay establishment and I came away impressed. There was some confusion when we first entered because it was so packed. Everyone was huddled around the delivery station at the end of the assembly line. We finally made our way through the crowd to get into the line to order. The cashiers were clearly pretty frazzled with the sheer chaos that was going on around them. Because of this they weren't very friendly but just trying to get people taken care of. Next came the long confusing wait to get the food. Everyone was just standing around the entrance to the building. There were a lot of people that were angry that they had to stand around so long waiting for their food. A lot of orders were thrown away because people were complaining about cold fries. Once one person complained then four other people would do the same. A bit ridiculous. 

On to the food! We finally received our order, everything was hot and looked amazing. We found a place to sit (not an easy feat) and settled in. We had already sipped half of the lemonades we ordered. They were delicious! My favorite was the peach ginger. My brother preferred the orange vanilla. We dove into the fish right away. I ordered the tartar sauce and the ""English Style Mayonnaise."" The tartar sauce was awesome but the mayo didn't taste unique in any way. I wish I would have tried a different sauce. The fish was so tender it was falling apart. It was piping hot and tasted perfect. I have tried many a fish and chip around the world. This totally holds its own as maybe the best I have ever had. The fries were ordinary until I added the Dirty #2 for an extra $2. The cheese and truffles with chives made the fries awesome. Try them. You won't regret it.

Overall, I will be back to Gordon Ramsay's Fish & Chips. I hope next time I can come at a less busy time and have a friendlier experience. The quality of the food is what will bring me back.",uBKFHr0GCK4rY_hQlok05g,0,0,4,57r_XZwtUC2-7W_97prL6A

I was looking for a non super-sized lunch option in Vegas last weekend. It was a toss-up between this and Jaburritos right across the way, but we went with this since I have poke-style food quite a lot and I hardly ever have fish and chips.

I got the fish combo which consisted of cod fish pieces, chips (fries), and a soft drink. The fish was excellent; super flakey, not very greasy, and it had good flavor. The chips meanwhile were good but were definitely not real British-style chips. I would classify these more like steak fries since the peels are still left on them, and chips that I've had in London are thicker.

You get a choice of two dipping sauces with your combo and I went with Gordon Ramsay's Tartar Sauce (basically regular tartar sauce) and Sriracha Aioli. I really liked the latter since it had a smokey flavor and really enhanced the flavor of the food.

The storefront is really cute with a British phone booth motif for the doors. However the place is really small so good luck finding a place to sit inside or on the tiny outdoor patio.

Eat outside while facing the linq promenade crowd. Perfect for people watching. Great food and good view; can't get better than that.",DpT4ed85EGsNBOEZvdhfsw,1,1,5,boNon_M7N0vdynscbR3w6A

The bad: the chips have been on the line for awhile so they're not as hot and fresh as the fish. Seating is at an absolute premium. If the idea is you're supposed to walk around the Promenade eating your food, that's not well thought out, because you've got a box of fish in one hand and a drink in the other. If the weather is crappy, there are tables inside the Flamingo where the coffee shop used to be. 

They have fish & chips, shrimp & chips, chicken & chips, and sausage & chips. You can't necessarily mix your proteins, but there is a ""secret combo"" of fish, shrimp, chicken & chips. It's a good mix. Less successful are the ""dirty chips"" where cayenne & chorizo are mixed with the fries. Maybe if they weren't lukewarm before being tossed they'd be better. 

The combo wasn't bad, but since it's Vegas and it has Ramsay's name on the box, a secret combo and a beer will set you back about $24. I'd like what I got better for about $10 less.",VzlX5LJ7__pl6AaBWBiw9w,2,1,4,7M5gKD5pYQ8rISi-9Rfisw

3306192,2017-01-12,63,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"Located on the Linq Promenade, you'll want to set the expectation that this is mainly a takeout spot.  But who wants takeout this deep into the Strip?  It's not like you can park out front and walk in and out.  Unless you have somewhere close by to take it, it will be cold by the time you get there.  So that brings up the issue of eating on the spot.  Yes there are tables and counters inside and an outside patio.  

Here is where it gets tricky.  Because this place is located in such a pedestrian packed area, there is almost always a line to the door of customers.  Even if it isn't a long line, you'll notice a ritual when you walk in the London phone booth looking front door.

As you walk in, there are tables right there in front of you and to the sides.  There is also a counter to the left with high bar stools.  For the most part all of these will be occupied.  The ritual comes into play where you will notice people hovering like honey bees to a flower over other people as they eat or more so when it seems like someone is close to finishing.  The hovering bees are people who have already ordered and may or may not have picked up their food yet.  They are waiting for a place to open up so they can stake their claim and sit.  

The bees from different hives will eye each other and display slight signs of faux dominance over their potential flower while nonverbally communicating ""I claimed this spot first.""

There's usually a polite exchange between the people leaving and the people claiming to say ""I'm finished you can have this spot"" and ""thanks, now pick up your camera and tourist stuff and get to step'n!""

So, you were a good worker bee and now you have a place to call your own and enjoy your meal.  The fish & chips are nicely done.  The fish batter is light and crispy. Cod of course has none of that wild fishy taste so it's always a staple for this type of food.  The fries are tasty and they have seasoned fry choices if you like (but it will cost you).  They also have several options for dipping sauce if you like and this comes with the meal. 

The fish portion sizes are on the small side and might not be a good value to some for the price you end up paying. Expect your plate with fountain drink to be in the $15-16 range.  They have some flavored lemonades if you want to pay extra. Don't want the fish, you can try the shrimp. 

Overall the place is well done and would be a better experience in another less dense location.

In essence, your experience will be of eating something flavored like the dipping sauce that you chose, paired with the light crispiness of the crust and the soft delicate texture of the fish. Because the fish used was cod, there wasn't much flavor. The fish was very delicate and the crust was crispy and light at the same time. The flavors could have been brought out more by seasoning the fish before frying or even incorporating salt into the batter, but I think the way that it is done here is what is done traditionally in the U.K. We chose the sriracha aioli and the tartar sauce, and we definitely prefer the sriracha aioli. It had more flavor than the regular tartar sauce, but it wasn't as fiery as straight up sriracha.

I give it 4.5 stars for what it is, with half a star deduction because the fish needs to be seasoned a little better under the batter so the fish flavor is a bit more pronounced.

It had been a while since I visited the Promenade and wasn't sure what would be good for lunch. Again, thanks to the Yelpers, I was super stoked to see that Gordon Ramsay recently opened up a Fish & Chips restaurant. 

Luckily, it was a Wednesday and we got to Gordon Ramsay at 11:30 am. We took a few pictures in front of the restaurant before heading in. On the outside, the restaurant is aesthetically pleasing with it's UK theme, something I don't remember ever seeing in Vegas.  Pub chairs and counter-like seating is available outside (great for people watching).

Seating inside is limited, about 5-tables that seat four and maybe 12-counter seats.  As you walk in, there are two lines. However, on the day of our visit, only one line was open. Because we got there a little earlier, we were fourth in line.  And unlike Gordon Ramsey's other dining locations in Vegas, this is more a high-end fast food restaurant. So my brother-in-law gave me his order so that I could stay in line to order lunch while he grabbed a table.

The menu options are straight and to the point, fish and chips or at least protein and chips. Combo options included Shrimp, Chicken, Sausage and Fishwich. Protein and chips are between $13 - $15. Combos can include beer, sodas or lemonade for an additional $1 - $5. Chip upgrade options are also available for an additional $2.

My brother-in-law opted for shrimp and chips with Gordon's Tartar sauce and Euro Mayo, while I got the fish combo, upgraded my chips to Truffle/Parmesean/Chives, with Gordon's Tartar and Sriracha Aioli sauce. For my drink, I chose orange and vanilla lemonade.

The shrimp combo came with six very large shrimp while the fish combo comes with 3 strips. The breading was nice and light. Shrimp was good, but the fish, nice and flaky, so so good. Regular chips were good, but we could hardly stop ourselves from eating the ""dirty"" fries. Very addicting. And the chips aren't your soggy french fries, but very crunchy which is my all-time favorite.

Before I forget, once I got up to pick up our order, the lunch line was out the door. So like anywhere, you want to get here before or after the lunch and dinner rush.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,4,1,5,Ln57RmKn0D-zqbB0-9Emag

Upgraded my chips to dirty fries #2 (parm truffle), which was also very good flavor-wise. Flavor evenly distributed throughout all the chips/fries. A little too crispy for my taste though, but maybe that's how the British have their chips. Total with upgrade & drink was $16.99.

Simply not enough indoor tables and chairs. Lastly, stick with the following sauces: sriracha aioli, the tartar sauce and mango curry.",llPj_Ksaw-DsytUN7LNrlg,0,0,3,L-ef7xaKAzHC-J4-qMi-yw

Surprisingly, I enjoyed the shrimp more than the fish here.  Like really enjoyed it - I totally recommend the shrimp and chips!!  It's also fried, but it comes with 5 pieces.  The shrimp tastes marinated, and are plump.  The fish was cooked really well, but parts of the batter were a little soggy.  Chips in England are usually more chunky, but these still suffice and tastes especially great with the sauces.  The mango curry tasted amazing on everything, but on the chips - I swear I had a taste of London right there.  My next favorite is the siracha aioli.  It's kind of garlic-y, but it works!  The ranch is a nice complement to the batter and fries as well.

I like the take-out concept, though I think the Linq Promenade might need a few more benches around to accomodate.  Plan ahead about drinks if you think you'll be walking around with food- your hands will be full.",T1ECVGXE_vwCoCOY5s4esg,1,2,4,FIVDAv9N_QtcLmSiwzcJXQ

We love Gordon Ramsey, and fish and chips are top of the list of our favorite foods. I was a little skeptical since it was more fast food but we figured it was worth a shot. While I waited for what felt like forever, I watched the cooks stumble around and try to figure out what they were cooking. I should have known right there we were in for a bad meal.

My boyfriend and I each paid extra for the specialty fries and oh my word, they were terrible!! So overcooked I could have thrown them through the window. The fish was just blah, very little flavor. We spent almost $40 and I could have gotten better fish at a dive bar in my home town for 1/4 the price. Anytime I eat at an establishment with Gordon Ramsey's name on it I have high expectations, and I was very disappointed this time. I would never go back here or recommend it.

If you throw some fresh cod, some steak fries, very bold and proud English decor, limited seats, a Pepsi machine with some beer taps (of course it would be Innis & Gunn) then you'll have GR Fish & Chips. Behind it's crispy brown outer shell was a smaller piece of fresh flakey fish ready for you to dip into your various classic sauces or more trendier sauces (I'm talking to you Sriracha whatever). Mango curry was an interesting flavor and would recommend with a side of their malt vinegar. Wash down your non alcoholic thirst with their midnight fog (Vanilla Pepsi + raspberry flavoring). 

Although every corner of the restaurant is fully decorated or wrapped in some design, it is very compact in here. I would estimate around 20 available seats and terrible for groups. The service however is very quick and friendly that if you do decide to just grab it and go it looks like you'll be fine. 

The restaurant may have hooked this little fish with their namesake (and probably everyone who dines here) but I won't be visiting often. The classic fish and chip combo is $14.99 with a dollar upgrade to the ginger lemonade (too sweet) ended up costing $17.

My boyfriend and I split the fish and chips combo, which came with a choice of battered meat (fish, shrimp, chicken or sausage) as well as a chips with the option to upgrade to one of the flavored ""dirty"" options for $2 more. Of course, we went with the battered fish with the Dirty #2 fries (truffle, parmesan, chives) The combo also came with 2 different sauces for dipping and we decided to go with their classic tartar sauce and their curry mango sauce. The fish was battered perfectly, hot and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It was a bit oily and heavy so the portion size of 3 pieces is actually great for splitting with another person. The fries were thick-cut but not too thick--perfectly crispy. Loved the truffle parmesan flavor!

While tartar sauce is pretty much a must-have when it comes to fish and chips, I highly recommend the curry mango sauce!

We ordered just the standard box of three pieces of fish fried in their special batter, over a bed of their regular fries...and it was like nothing else. Comes with your choice of any two of their combination of sauces (all extremely delicious but i recommend the sriracha aioli and Gordon's tartar sauce) AND a refillable soft drink of your choosing (they have one of those pop fountains that I've only seen at the Coca cola factory in Atlanta). All that for $14.99 in a city where prices of food keep going up is quite a deal!

Choose the good ol classic fish and chip combo without anything extra on the chips - because anything else would take away from the true Gordon Ramsey experience.

On my last visit, the fish was perfect! So flavorful and tender. The fish comes fresh from the fryer so you can always ensure that piping hot!

The fries were a little dry this time and not soft and fluffy like they should be . The dipping sauces are fabulous!! I highly suggest the curry sauce, the southwestern ranch, and the tarter sauce. I couldn't stop dipping my lame fries in the southwestern ranch because it was just that good! And come on, fish and chips without tartar sauce is a sin. Seriously people! 

I have never been disappointed with the service here but I have never been impressed either. The staff is perfectly fine and they are there just doing their job.

Fish and chips: Crunchy outside batter and moist inside.  This is done right.  Sitting atop truffle fries makes it a perfect meal.  I only used the tartar sauce  but the selection is designed for a broad spectrum of tastes... Dijon mayo, southwestern ranch to name some.   See my photo.

Peach ginger lemonade:  It was OK.  Not as good as I thought. 

Price: $15  Not bad. 

Parking:  I have to mention this because it's the Strip.  We parked at Linq and it was free because it was under an hour I believe.   It was midday so it wasn't difficult  but night time may be different.  So your experience may differ. 

Seating: Not that big inside so it may get cramped or you may not get a seat at all depending on the crowd.  Go fish.....",4Jr81-Bon3cYrVBEWd1i8w,0,0,4,3mrj_MN1qAxAil5ufMY7JQ

I opted for the fish and chips 'box' which consisted of three ample sized pieces of cod (I think), perfectly crisped in batter. For referencing, each was about the size of a normal Mars bar + a boatload of fries and Gordon's tartar sauce (which contains dill, my preference and comes with more than enough - nice to see no skimping here for profit's sake). Along with a bottle of Guinness, tax, tip, out the door for less than $30, to me it represents pretty amazing quality and value mere steps off the strip. About the only thing I would have thought Ramsay would do differently is the fries - they were single fried rather than twice fried (blanched, rested to cool, then fried again for limp but golden crispy pub style).

Given the fact this place is owned by Gordon Ramsay. The few things I enjoyed about this place was the British ambience and the friendly staff. It would've been nice if there was more space because it felt very cramped and not so much seating. So be prepared to stand or take your order to-go. 

The whole concept is counter service with a numbering call system when your order is ready for pick up. I ended up getting their original Fish & Chips combo with an upgraded Sticky Toffee Shake.

Onto the food. I was pleased with everything being served hot and fresh. The actual Fish was tender and soft with a consistent breading. However, it was lacking spices. The 2 sauces that I got were ok. The Chips(fries) was ok with a bland taste to it. My favorite item was the Sticky Toffee Shake, this was really good and balanced with the Toffee flavoring and the texture of the shake was very consistent without being to runy or thick.

Overall, I wouldn't come back here but would stop by for a Sticky Toffee Shake if Im in the immediate area. A good addition to the Linq Promenande for a quick service restaraunt.

It is a tad pricey and it's not on the menu but if you're not super hungry ask for a small basket with two fish. I believe it was $11 but I could be mistaken. 

They have several dipping sauces to choose from but I chose the original tartar sauce and tried the Sriracha one to mix it up. Both delicious and went well with the fish and chips.

They fry the food in small batches, so it's hot and crispy when you get it. You can pick 2 sauces, and they also have self-serve ketchup and malt vinegar. I liked the mango curry sauce. We were charged $11.99 for just fish and chips (no soda), but were charged $0.46/cup for water.

Fish and chips - Fish was breaded well but way too oily and no seasoning; OTOH, fries were absolutely caked in salt, making them completely inedible. One of the workers had a huge attitude when we asked for replacement fries.

Shrimp - I really liked these and they were much better than the fish, but the cocktail sauce was half frozen...

The other problem is that the dining areas are tiny, so pretty much any time it's even remotely busy there will be no place to sit.

Didn't anticipate how SMALL the space would be!  Long line made it very crowded and there isn't nearly enough seating inside.  We just went with the basic fish n chips combo.  Were very pleased!  Generous serving of chips that were topped with herbs and a little cheese.  The fish was fresh, well cooked, flakey, and not greasy.  My hubby is from the UK and said it's better than what you get in England -- they serve it in newspaper because it's greasy.  For Vegas, a very reasonable lunch.  For Ramsay, a downright cheap lunch! lol Certainly wish there was more seating.  They should've expected it to be popular and everyone shouldn't be crammed in shoulder 2 shoulder.   We would've been disappointed if the fish wasn't good but they delivered.

Located on the Linq promenade is the small British looking pub facade that has a small outdoor seating area. Inside is simply a walk up counter to order your fish & chips and take it with you.  My experience with the product was spot on!  The fish was fabulous and well proportioned, the fries were sea salt and crispy enough on the exterior!  The accompanying tartar sauce and spicier sauce was extraordinary and made the meal just extraordinary! 

GR has this restaurant of his doing exactly what you'd see the celebrity chef expecting on one of his many shows.  Producing a excellent quality fish & chips served in a great ""people watching"" location just off the strip!",kjaUSiRWhR9bF9KxOMbVvg,1,0,4,cPSbBcmPVCe75SX5ez0Rfw

If this food was cooked by someone on one of his contestant shows, he'd be freaking out, throwing one of his temper tantrums, cussing up a storm & screaming at whoever cooked it.

The fish was almost entirely breading, which was completely bland.  It wasn't even cooked all the way through... the breading was soft & mushy.  The fries were cold... & not cold like they just weren't piping hot, but they were actually cold... like they'd been sitting there for 20/25 minutes before being served.  Last, & the most egregious, the beer was warm... the fries were colder than the beer, so you can't even wash this crap down after you eat it.  My wife & I took about 3-4 bites before tossing it in the trash... our 12 year old & his friend made it thru around 6 bites before tossing it.

However, after eating at this fish and chips place, I learned a lot about the dish.

I feel I learned that the fish's main purpose is to provide amazing texture flavored by salt and whatever spices the chef can add.  The fish isn't supposed to be overwhelmingly flavorful.  A lot of fish and chip places have fish that just crumbles or falls apart.  However, this place NAILS IT.

Having become my favorite fish and chips place, Gordon Ramsay's restaurant provides affordable, super tasty options!  We ordered the regular fish and chips with the curry sauce and house tartar sauce.  

THAT TARTAR SAUCE THO.  WOW. SOOO GOOD.

The combination of the fish's amazing composure and perfect amount of seasoning along with the tartar sauce's flavor created such a beautiful experience for us.

Simple concept, and definitely the cheaper Gordon Ramsay establishments in Vegas. You go in, get in line, order, and pick up your food after they call your number. Their fish n chips combo comes with a few pieces of awesome battered, lightly fried fish, and the fries, and it comes with a drink. That'll cost around $15 before tax. For extras such as alcoholic drinks or upgrade your fries (add flavor), it'll cost extra. The fish n chips come with 2 sauces- can choose between tartar, curry, ranch, sriracha aioli, etc. 

The fish has such a perfect crunch to it, though if it's not eaten right away, the batter falls off easily and the part not facing up can get a bit soggy. The fries/chips are a bit plain, but they are still good. I suppose its to be customized in regards to seasoning, such as their sauces or ketchup.

Fish and chips - seems like a simple food, but so hard to make perfect and leave it to Gordan 
Ramsay to do just that!

Ordered the regular 2 piece fish & chips. You get two sauces so I choose Gordan's Tarter Sauce and the Mango Curry. Both perfect compliments for either the fish or chips.  While you pay about $15 for simple fish and chips, let's remember that this is pretty normal for Vegas prices and the quality of the fish is totally worth it.

The tartar sauce was tasty too. I liked that malt vinegar was available as well.

I came here twice to have Gordon's Fish & Chips and experienced some difference in the quality of the fish I was served.

Both times I ordered the GR fish combo with peach and ginger lemonade with the sriracha aioli and Gordon's tartar sauce. My beer-battered fish were similar in shape (looks to be cut into a 3/4"" - 1"" cube strips) had a beautiful golden color and the fish was extremely moist. It was truly one of the best beer-battered fish I have ever eaten. The sriracha aioli also paired extremely well with the fish and the ginger lemonade was truly refreshing.

For my second visit I ordered the exact same thing and changed the dipping sauce to southwest ranch and sriracha aioli. To my dismay, Two out of the three pieces of my fish were over-fried and came out a dark brown charred-looking color. One of them was passable but the shape of each fish was also irregular.

Three fillets come to an order; these are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist/flaky on the inside.  So good.  You get your choice of two sauces - I tried Gordon's tartar and the sriracha mayo - some might ask why not malt vinegar but I have watched chef Ramsay cook fish and chips and he said he prefers tartar sauce.  The chips (fries) come in a variety of ways - I had truffle/Parmesan style - these were decent but could have used more truffle/Parmesan.

For those who march to a different drummer, there's also shrimp, sausage and chicken, and something called a fishwich.  A few desserts and some beer choices round out the menu.

The place is usually pretty crowded so be prepared to get in line!  The operation is pretty efficient so the line moves fairly quickly.",jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ,3,0,4,nvr39evtoU_9Xpzv1wivpQ

So I took my family who was visiting from out of town to try it out. I raved about his other places even though they were skeptical, we still gave it a go because it was so cute and I couldn't pass it up. 

The menu is a little confusing and when I stepped up to order, the counter worker did not walk us through the menu.  Located in a tourist spot I'm sure a lot of the people walking in are first timers so it would have been helpful for a quick run through of what the combos are. 
We ordered fish and chips not knowing any of the other items . 
The counter worker seemed frustrated with our order, but we didn't realize that they were about to close, so that makes sense.
When we got our food, I am sad to say it was mediocre at best. The fish was bland and the fries were dried out. No salt, no seasoning, just literally fish and fries. We probably should have opted for one of the more ""fancy"" fry options, but with no recommendations we didn't really know. The look on our faces said it all. Blah. For $16 and Gordon's name on the door, I would expect something worth while, or at least something I could eat rather then throwing our dinner in the trash.

The place is beyond cute! The open kitchen gives you the fresh food feeling. The service was ok. People came in while we were eating and the restaurant was closing and the line cooks just said "" oh we're closed.""  I think most people now a days have worked in some line of service and could agree that a warm welcoming or inviting guests to come back when they're open  literally can make a difference. 
To sum it up:
The restaurant has an awesome fresh feel.
The service needs some work.
The food was blah. I don't think this is what Gordon Had in mind. Needless to say we won't be back, and I will recommend his other restaurants instead.",uTez_kNa-TZ2i2MnZBtowQ,0,0,2,SdnTTk6K-Dxr_XEs7_19Yg

The only sauce that remotely sounded good to me was the curry mango, which unfortunately looked like mustard and had a slight scent of vinegar, which I don't like for anything other than cleaning windows.

Strolled in on a Saturday afternoon, managed to get a table for all 6 of our group. Seating is a little tight on the inside for big groups like ours, but if you're 2-4 people it shouldn't be a problem. They also have bar-style seating outside for small groups as well. 

The line and ordering is very straight forward. Bonus! While wait, you can see the chefs cook your fish and chips from the initial breading to the deep frying. I love to see an open kitchen concept. You also get two selections of sauces. Between all 6 of us, we managed to get one of every sauce to try. Top picks: Curry, Dijon Mayo, and Gordon's Tartar sauce. I personally got the Dijon Mayo (think mustard plus mayo!) and the tartar sauce, of course. Curry was a nice flavor without being overpowering. The others were meh in my book (in comparison to the top choices) - but don't get me wrong, all the sauces were all really tasty.

Fish & Chips - 5/5. So damn good.
Good fish and chips in my book need to be flakey, but hold it's shape when you bite & dip into the sauces. The batter should be light, but not over power the taste of the mild fish. Gordon Ramsey manages to accomplish both these things. Bite after bite, the fish flaked apart but didn't fall apart into the sauce. The batter was crisp and had so much flavor. Natural fries were a great compliment tossed simply with salt. Definitely grab a beer to go with this!

Shrimp & Chips - 4/5. Slightly too much batter, but still damn good.
My partner got the shrimp, which were HUGE. This combo came with 5 pieces of rather large shrimp battered the same as the fish. However, my partner thought the batter was a little much for the shrimp. Maybe a less thick batter would do better? I had no complaints though as the shrimp was plump, tasty, and the batter tastes amazing.

Fried food is done best when you bite into it and the insides don't just fall from the coating. Both the fish and shrimp held shape but remained so tender - a good sign of fried food done very well.

The chips (fries) could've been a bit more chip-like - thicker and more potato-y. Definitely season up your fries for $2 if you enjoy chili cheese fries. I wasn't too big of a fan of the chipotle seasoning. It tasted too meaty. 

Ooooo, the sauces tho! They have a wide selection from which you can choose from. Try the sriracha aoli, tastes like sriracha mayo with a kick of citrus. 

For the most part, this joint is decently priced and tasty for a Gordon Ramsay place in Vegas. The employees are also super sweet which makes the experience so much more enjoyable. It's a nice, treat-yourself meal since everything is fried.",pP3NerQXhhYVd1o58kbijQ,3,1,4,4uuRxaVjbA11ycaUSuloPw

The fish is cooked well and doesn't taste frozen(lol). The fries are great but not the best fries I had in my life; however, they are less greasy than most fries, which I really like. There's a varieties of sauces; however, none really captivated me. Some were pretty unique, but they weren't outstanding. Keep in mind the place is very busy. When I exited, they were already running out of a sauce and had to make a new batch after only being open for an hour. This could because of the poor management though.

Overall, I think this is a decent restaurant to have some fish and chips. Even if this wasn't by Gordon Ramsey, I would still visit again when I visit Vegas.",HxCkbQ4sE6PUDx2F366dfQ,0,0,4,gigiopiDZa2b16qLCQnj0w

I watch you continuously scream and lecture chefs on TV, so my expectations for your signature dish is pretty damn high, I've mentioned before that it's pretty hard to find quality fish & chips in America, since we Americans somehow always mess it up. But you, Gordan Ramsey, are British... so again my expectations were high.

Located in the LINQ Promenade, the space is pretty small with limited indoor and outdoor seating. Very casual setting compared to his other restaurants. We placed our order at the cashier and waited for the food to be freshly fried. The wait can get long but this gives you time to look for a seat. When we finally tried our food, I must say, in the words of Gordon himself, it was bloody delicious. Perfectly crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside. Comes with 2 dipping sauces of your choice, so I picked the tarter sauce and Dijon mayonnaise. They also have Curry & Mango (sounds interesting), Sriracha Aioli, and Southwest Ranch.

My friend and i ordered the fish n chip combo and upgraded the regular fries to the dirty chips. 
The combo comes with a 3 large pieces of the fish. The breading on the outside was thin, light and crispy and fish was moist and meaty on the inside. 
You also get to choose 2 sauces for each combo you order. We both ordered the tarter sauce and then had the curry mango and srirscha aioli. Curry mango was good. A little sweet with curry taste but not overwhelming. The best was the sriracha aioli. Had a bit of kick that made it perfect with the fish and chips.d

So the fries we ordered was:
Dirty #1 which has chipotle, jalapeno and chorizo. This had a spicy kick to it with a good amount of chorizo and onions and jalapeno on top. 
Dirty #2 was the truffle, parmesan garlic. This was my absolute favorite. I just love garlic and you have a kick of the garlic parmesan with every bite. Not overwhelming at all. Perfect with every bite. 
You can upgrade your combo from regular fires to the dirty fries for only $2 more. Which is pretty good deal.

Service was quick and all of the food was delicious. I recommend the fish with chorizo jalapeno dirty fries, coupled with the sriracha mayo and southwest ranch. Top it all off with an orange vanilla lemonade. 

The only downside is that the place is pretty cramped and seating is very limited. I stood outside at the raised bar for a few minutes before seats were brought out to accommodate. The Assistant Manager, Bronwyn, even stopped by our table to say hello and make sure everything was good with our meal and ask if we needed anything else, which says a lot for a restaurant as fast foodish as this one, especially when the restaurant was really crowded. But, if you're looking for a place to sit, I'd recommend taking your order to go. Keep in mind the combo prices all include a drink.

so at first glance, the location is right in the middle of a strip of restaurants and stores. this has the most unique exterior and interior design! definitely something great to be able to go and visit such an eye catching exterior.

once inside we got in line (where there is a tv/camera on the wall so while waiting in line you can snap a pic and share on social media) and after a short wait... i went ahead and got my order of the fish and chips combo for $14.99 with tartar sauce and sriracha aioli!

after ordering i was able to go to the super cool soda machine where you can choose from LOTS of different types of soda, though if i had known i didn't have to order the drink i would have just got a water and saved some money!

OVERALL: recommend if you're looking for a quick bite!

-fish was very fresh (however it wasn't MIND BLOWING which is why its not a 5 star review)
-sauces were delicious
-fell apart every time i tried to eat with a fork

Establishment is fun- phone booth style doors for the entry, fun Union Jack themed fire hydrant out front.
Staff were incredibly friendly.

Here's the ""bad""-
For how obviously popular this place is because of the name- there is little to no seating; maybe a dozen or so available ""spaces"" out front and maybe 18-25 MAX inside with elbows rubbing tightly.

The biggest disappointment however was the fish.  But first:
THE CHICKEN IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Seriously- I've never had chicken with such flavor and moisture- and it's not moisture you'd think of like ""dripping"" juicy-  it was like a natural tender moisture that was embedded in the meat-  uncanny flavor.  The batter as well was fabulous.  Crunchy, flaky but held together-  just phenomenal.
The Orange Vanilla Lemonade and the Peach Ginger Lemonade as well were fantastic.
The chips- I had the Parmesan Garlic truffle- very tasty.
The standard chips were lacking slightly- a touch of salt would've made them great.  But they were properly cooked through, right color and texture.

Now-  the disappointment-  you go to a world renowned chef from the UK which is famous for Fish and Chips- you'd expect seriously good fish and chips.......
While like the chicken, the batter was very tasty, I found the fish itself very VERY lacking.  It was lacking flavor, texture was off slightly, like somewhat dry...........but not ""dry"".  
I don't know if I had built up my expectations higher than what they should've been- but I was left wanting.

I will go back however- simply for the CHICKEN and Lemonade!!!!!",l6nCrx7263tb9Mvmc3yaFQ,0,0,3,BTr82nsxoe1KwXIsTXZ2Xg

Empty tables and barely a line at 9PM on Monday night. Order the toffee pudding shake and the fish n' chips.

I'm KNOWN for eating sweets on a daily basis. But this sticky toffee pudding (too long a name) shake was overbearingly sweet. I took a sip and felt my teeth chatter and my insides tightening up. What did you put in this? 2 pounds of sugar?! I highly urge sharing this drink between 3 people. It's too much sweetness for one person. 

Fish was dripping oil as were the fries. It was good at first but then the amount of oil began to creep and make me feel nauseous. Ugh

I ordered my dinner and the young guy behind the cash register was very friendly: so far, a good start. I ordered my fish and chips as well as my sauce and took a seat, and a few minutes later my food was up.

The fries almost tasted as if they were double-fried just to heat them up. They were honestly some of the worst fries I ever had so I only ate about three of them. The serving of fish was three small pieces with uninspired breading. It honestly tasted like it was frozen from a bag at Kroger's.

Tip: GET ONE OF THE LEMONADES! So refreshing. They come in the peach & ginger or vanilla & orange (my favorite of the two).

I came to Vegas this trip determine to have my Gordon Ramsay cherry popped. We didn't end up having time to a sit-down meal, and I didn't feel like burgers, so that left the Fish & Chips joint. It's a tiny place on the Linq Promenade, and it's definitely very popular. We had to wait for a while for a table to open up. 

I ordered the fish and chips, with tartar sauce and sriracha aioli. This also comes with a drink, which makes it a pretty good deal. The food was fantastic. The fish was crispy and flaky, while the fries were perfectly seasoned and satisfying to eat. Nothing tasted overly greasy or heavy. The batter also did a good job of clinging onto the fish, and it didn't fall apart when I dunked it into the sauce. 

The line moved quickly, and someone was cleaning tables pretty quickly, so it was fairly pleasant to eat here despite the crowded, cramped space. In all, this is probably the best fast food you can get around this part of the Strip, and I might come out of my way to eat here in the future.

5022905,2017-04-02,2,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"I love fish and chips.  As such, Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips was conceptually exactly my kind of place.  Located on the Linq Promenade, it was easy to find and doing a brisk lunch business on a Monday afternoon.  Surprisingly, there was little seating both inside and out for diners, which was a bit problematic given how GR F&C serves its fish and chips.  It definitely wasn't hand food like a sandwich or burrito.

The quality of the cod was very good.  It was nicely fried and perfectly crisp on the outside, moist, glistening and flaky on the inside.  For the price ($14.99), though, I would've liked a little bit more fish and a little bit less chips.  Falling prey to the upsell for the chips, I added cacciatore spice and fresh basil to my order, which added a dollar to its price, but added little to the chips except make them messier to eat.  The choice of two condiments that come standard with the fish and chips (I had the curry & mango and Sriracha aioli) were very tasty sauces in and of themselves making the upsell even more unnecessary for the chips.  Given my love for Gordan Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding with brown butter ice cream dessert at GR Steak, I had to try the Sticky Toffee Pudding Shake milkshake ($8.99).  Sadly, it, too, was a disappointment.  While brown butter ice cream may have been used in the shake, it tasted like plain vanilla lacking any discernible brown butter notes.  The sticky toffee pudding element of the shake was a very thick sauce possessing a granular sugar quality, which was squeezed into the shake, but never came close to melding its flavors into the shake mixture, which was overly thick by itself, making it a difficult proposition to suck through a straw.  While the milkshake certainly didn't taste bad, it didn't come close to living up to or even approximating Gordon Ramsay's sticky toffee pudding in milkshake form.

Gordon Ramsay Fish & Chips was the lone disappointing meal of my trip.  While nothing was bad, nothing was exemplary either.  It seemed a bit overpriced for what I got and it under delivered on what seemed like achievable objectives.  It will hold appeal for Gordon Ramsay fans, but for this fan of Gordon Ramsay and his food, I came, I saw, but I don't see a need to return.",le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,3,3,3,sqqDw03ecYIqYt1w2P0TFQ

They make dirty chips.  This is not a bad thing. I opted for  DIRTY #1 fries (Brits call me chips but they should not be confused with potato chips) mixed with Chipotle, jalapeño, and chorizo.   

Lines are long but it moves quickly.  In case you're bored there's an interactive video postcard machine to play with while you wait.  Seating can be an challenge with only a handful of tables and small bar (sitting not drinking) area.  Outside there are a few more stools and bar counter -- again no booze.  

I'd go again but I'd share it with a few people as it's very rich. Plus I'd be packing some antacids for the after burn.",LQJ7jEWxBBLYiaGVWdN5Dg,6,3,4,EeNqk7E2aYNcmbMJ2LVtCQ

Many visits to the UK  and a huge fan of this simple dish left me wondering why it was adulterated for the US?  I'll explain but first, the fish; fresh, air flown cod (to me better than haddock), salted and rested to firm up the texture then batter coated and fried.  Crisp on the outside, moist and flaky on the inside.  A little greasy but all good.  British style tartar sauce and ketchup check.  And then...

Chips - What happened to the thick cut, crisp, fluffy chips?  Why serve an thin cut, anemic American French fries?  They don't absorb the malt vinegar (which is also missing) or give that welcome texture against the crisp fish

I want more; pickles - pickled onions, pickled shallots, pickled quail eggs, heck, even mushy peas, something, anything with some acidity to reset the palate after bites of the oily meal.

Double carbs please; buttered bread.  There is none.  How am I supposed to make my chip butty?  Ahhh a pile of chips between two slices of buttered bread, dipped in ketchup between bites.  

Though the last two are not deal killers, the American style fries and silly sauces (options include a mango curry, ranch dressing, and a siracha aioli) destroys that which makes the dish so good.  Sutton & Sons, or Toff's it's not.

Note:  Want to try the dish right?  Check out Gordon Ramsay's Pub.  Just a few bucks more, a world of difference.

Fast food service.  Pricey for what you get.

I chose tartar sauce and Sriracha aioli as dipping sauces and both went well with the fish.  Their tartar sauce has a strong dill taste and the Sriracha aioli wasn't spicy if you're wondering.

But I have to keep it real.  I really do.  Anyone who knows me and reads my reviews knows that I am a HUGE fan of Gordon and his restaurants.  This was not a 5 star experience.  
It was close!  Damn close.  But not close enough.  
I hope that my comments here make it to management so that the next time we go, i can upgrade the review. 

I've been waiting to go to GR Fish and Chips since about a year before it opened, when I first heard about it.  Life being what it is, we weren't able to go until Friday night.  

GRFC is located at the far end of the Promenade, almost right across from Chayo, next to the Flamingo.  Its an adorable little chippy, and when I say little, I mean little.  Its small in here.  The idea was for people to get a box of fish and chips, and be able to walk around with it.  this is not a sit down restaurant.  there are seats inside, and there is seating outside, but its sparse.  

There's one queue, and two registers.  I can see it being quite crowded when its busy.  It was pretty busy already, being about 6:00pm on a Friday night when we got there, but the line moved pretty quickly, after one HUGE group ordered.  

Service was super polite.  

Of course, my husband and I had to try the fish and chips combo. We tried 4 different sauces between the two of us, and also ordered an extra piece of fish ""a la carte"" each.  (Pro tip:  Don't do that.  The 3 pieces of fish and the chips are more than enough food.  We ended up not eating most of our chips, we were so full.)  We also ordered a peach ginger lemonade, and a sticky toffee pudding milkshake. 

Lets talk about the food:  The fish was delicious.  The fish to breading ratio was perfect. 
 You know how some fish and chips spots will do a TON of breading for a tiny bit of fish?
  Not Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips.  Cooked to absolute perfection, it was piping hot, flaky, glistening...BUT.  It was greasy.  They didn't let the fish rest and drain long enough, probably because it was so busy, but that was disappointing.  The first piece was really really greasy. Some of my fries were too.  Gordon would have been appalled, to be honest. 

The chips...well, ok, they were fries.  They aren't traditional British chips, but they were still good.  We did the dirty #1: chipotle, jalapenos, and chorizo:  tasty, but difficult to eat without a fork, and the dirty #2: cacciatore spice and fresh basil:  really good.  Easier to eat without a fork, but in order to get all the yummy basil, I needed a fork.  Next time I'll likely try just the natural sea salt chips. 

We also tried out a bunch of awesome sauces (see what I did there? lol)
My favorites in order:
1. Gordon's tartar sauce
2. Curry mango
3. Sriracha aioli
4. Southwest ranch

They were good, and honestly, we probably didn't need the 2 extra that we got with our extra fish, but they're included, so why would we not try them? 

We had a peach ginger lemonade, which was perfection.  It went really well with the food, as it cut the richness and the grease.  It was a little small.  I'd like a slightly bigger drink. 

The pièce de résistance was the sticky toffee pudding SHAKE.  I've loved every incarnation of this dessert that I've tried so far, and the shake was absolute perfection.  Sweet.  Thick.  The most amazing toffee sauce on top...I'd go back JUST for one of these.  Seriously.  Amazing. 

Pretty close to a 5 star experience, but just not quite there.  

The greasy fish, I'm really sorry, is unforgivable.  Gordon Ramsay kicks people out of the kitchen for greasy fish...I know y'all are busy, but let the fish drain and rest.  

Also, there REALLY needs to be someone stationed in the dining area to wipe down and clean up as guests leave.  I understand that this is hard to do with such a quick turnaround time, but if a fast food joint can have clean tables and eating areas, so should a Gordon Ramsay property.  

There were pieces of fish and fries on the floor at my feet, and I unwittingly stuck my arm in crumbs as I sat down to eat.  Gross.  People should clean up after themselves, sure, but...most people are lazy and inconsiderate.  I made sure to wipe down our area at least with a napkin for the next people, but...an employee really needs to clean up the spots when people leave and as people are waiting for their food.  

Correct those two issues, and it will be a 5 star spot, no problem.  Its definitely one of the more affordable GR spots in town, and as much as I hate being on the Strip, I'd head down here again in a heartbeat.",renPzRDqMZpMaHiCD_e1_A,4,0,4,r4vKoCHI5SET_bPljnljeA

Any good chef knows that fries need to be cooked twice. First blanched, then fried hot for a crisp outside and fluffy inside. I'd never had a fry that tough. On top of that, it was difficult to get into the shop. I am handicapped and riding a mobility scooter.  One of the doors was broken but no one put a sign on the door saying that. Difficult to get in with such a small shop, plus the price was high for what we got. Very disappointed, I expected better from Gordon Ramsay.

5260621,2017-05-05,0,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"Considering this is Gordon Ramsey's Fish and Chips restaurant, I had very high hopes for it.

In the end, it was just mediocre.

We ordered a fish and chips and a shrimp and chips.

The batter for the shrimp had much more seasoning than the fish.  I couldn't even taste any salt in batter for the fish.  And considering cod used for fish and chips is typically pretty plain taste wise, it definitely could have used some salt.

The size of the shrimp was pretty impressive.  They could have easily gone with smaller shrimp but did not. However, the pieces of cod used for the fish and chips were quite small.  And the chips were fries... not chips. 

The organization of where the condiments were compared to where the soda machine was didn't seem very thought out.  For a pretty busy restaurant, there's only enough room for 1 person to sort out all their condiment and utensil needs before the next person can.  So if the person in front of you is trying to pour themselves 2/3 cups of ketchup but you just need a straw, you'll have to wait.

Overall, I would not visit this restaurant again even if I was in the area.

I would save my money for Slap Fish.",0fKCfLixNcnickTwCfwf0Q,0,0,3,8A3fp7h5-QSxyUrWCvN17A

This restaurant is freaking amazing.  I love fish and chips and honestly usually end up fairly disappointed because the batter just isn't right or the chips are soggy. THAT IS NOT THE CASE HERE!

We walked in with a party of 4 right after they opened at 11am.  There were a few people in line and a few people at tables.  There was one table of 4 available so we grabbed that and went to order.

We all ordered the fish and chips.  Along with the fish and chips, you get the choice of two sauces.  There are many choices.  I went for the tartar and the mango curry.  I am not a huge mango person but it sounded interesting so I went for it.

The chips were very good, thick cut, firm and crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  They were well salted and tasted great.  Now the fish, OMG, it was divine!  The fish tasted extremely fresh.  There was no overbearing fish taste, just nice and clean. The fish was cooked perfectly.  It was flaky, moist and glistening.  The batter was the best I have ever had.  The batter was thick but not too thick.  It was crispy, beautiful golden brown and light.  

The sauces are great!  You can tell these are not some bottled sauces sitting on a shelf for a long period of time.  They are fresh, the flavors pop and they add so much flavor to an already flavorful meal.  I personally loved the mango curry.  It was light, had a slight curry taste, mildly fruity and amazing, they need to bottle this because I would buy it!  The tartar was good and the ranch was also good but I will be dreaming of that mango curry on that wonderful fish.

The fish & chips here are DELICIOUS.  The batter is perfectly light and crispy, and the fish isn't ""fishy""... it's white and flaky and perfect.  Honestly some of the best fish I've ever had.  With a fish & chips combo, you get a tartar sauce and a choice of one other dipping sauce... which I really appreciate for the chips since I don't like ketchup.  I went with sriracha aioli and it was very good.  

The chips/fries are... okay.  Honestly there wasn't anything wrong with them, they just weren't anything to write home about.  I actually wish the menu offered a ""just fish"" option if you weren't feeling like fries (I know, I'm talking crazy...), but it would be nice to have that flexibility.

Okay, the soda machine.  So, during my visit I had an interesting experience with this thing.  It was around 2pm on a Monday, so not the typical ""rush hour"" for food.  The line wasn't particularly long for food but I noticed a crazy long line for the soda machine.  I didn't think much of it at the time... until I ordered a drink.  I ordered a lemonade and was directed to the machine... no problem.  It was a Pepsi version of those Coke machines that allow you to mix-and-match, choose your own, etc.  I just wanted a regular lemonade, but as I'm about to press it the guy behind me says ""I wouldn't do that if I were you.""  He explains that it seems to be out of ""soda"" and is just dispensing the syrup.  I pressed it and sure enough, he was right.  At his recommendation, I dispensed a little of the syrup in my cup and filled the rest with sparkling water and mixed.  Still WAY too syrupy and sweet.  Basically the line was full of people trying to fix their drink.  

I realize this was probably a one-time experience, but even when it works properly I worry that this machine would still cause issues.  I completely understand that it seems like it would be easier this way... the people behind the counter don't have to worry about spending time getting us drinks, etc... and besides, people like these machines.  But see, this restaurant is small.  And there's just one of these machines.  While I was there, in between people who were ""fixing"" their drinks were people who had never experienced this machine before... and we're taking a lot of time.  Or kids who were struggling or having too much fun with it.  I just feel like these machines are great, but it adds SO much craziness in this small restaurant.

We ordered Dirty #2 which is the truffle parmesan fries.  Yum.  The fish was light and flaky...it was easier to just pick it up with your fingers because by the time you dip it, it's so flaky and soft it either ends up in stuck in the sauce or it breaks apart.  We loved it.  We would definitely go back!",sYt4ov3Hjp44CG7kbHOobA,0,0,5,c5WbkphbfCy7O3j3xiEldw

N: I got the shrimp and chips and it was extremely delicious! I loved all the sauces (I got dijon mayo and southwest ranch). I agree that the fries were way below Ramsay's standards.

5503400,2018-06-12,4,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"My buddy Keith once went here 3 times in 2 days.  Said it was the best thing since sliced bread.  I knew I had to at least try it out.  We went here around 7pm on Sunday, June 10th.  Line wasn't too long, placed our order for a Fish N Chips and a Chicken N Chips.  $31.00 or so.  Not bad, especially for Vegas.   Here is what I liked and didn't like about my dining experience...................

Liked
-  Fish and Chips.  Bomb!  Some of the best fish and chips I have ever had.  The fish was hot, moist, flaky and tasted fantastic.  The chips were awesome, also.  Double fried, crispy on the outside, still soft in the middle.  Really good combo!
-  Price.  Around $16.00 and that comes with a fountain drink.
-  Service.  Lady at the register was very friendly and nice.

Didn't Like
-  The restaurant itself.  Small and cramped!  We grabbed a bar stool facing the wall, and I felt uncomfortable and rushed the whole time eating.  It was rather warm in the place, too.  Cramped, and hot combined are never good.  Meh!
-  The sauces.  I tried 3 of the sauces and didn't like any of them.  I am not a mayo based sauce fan, so right away, I knew I was in trouble.  I went with ranch and curry mango for my sauces.  The ranch tasted like a hot smelly armpit that had b/o, and the curry mango was all curry, and minimal mango.  I tried a little of my friends tartar sauce and this was the best of the 3, but even then, mayo based, I can't enjoy it.  I wound up just going with plain malt vinegar for my fish and it turned out well.  
-  The chicken.  It was a little overcooked, and the breading they use, doesn't work well with chicken.  It wasn't nasty or anything like that, my wife just didn't like it, and I had a few bites and it was just ok.  Skip the chicken and go with what they are known for, the fish.
-  Freestyle Pepsi Machine.  Never saw one of these before, they have always been Coke.  The Pepsi machine had way less choices and was a bit more confusing to use.  There were constant lines for soda while people tried to figure out what they wanted.  Meh.

Fish and Chips= 5 stars.  Other factors =3 stars.  As long as you focus on how good the fish and chips are, you can deal with the other stuff.  They DO make a mean basket of perfectly fried fish and chips.  I would definitely come back....and eat outside or somewhere other than in the cramped ass restaurant.",6jz_Yr6_AP2WWLbj9gGDpA,8,5,4,dycw6gkOgpqGF1ufDo_tGw

At $16 for the fish and chips combo, which includes 2 dipping sauces and a small drink, I'd rather a ""Farm Burger"" from his Planet Hollywood location.  Throw in the cramped dining area, the condiment section being jammed into a stupidly small section by the soda machine, and eating at Crown & Anchor off the strip while throwing back a few pints from actual glass sounds like a way better plan.  

The only highlight was fortunately the fish; three hot, delightfully crispy and lovingly breaded pieces with nice tender meat inside.  The fries were just fries, and I could have easily gone for a double serving of the sauces (tartar and curry mango) that were better portioned for a 4 piece Mcnugget meal.  I wanted all my fish covered in sauce and it was all but gone before the second piece was even finished.

And isn't it weird that the recipe for this same dish at his pub at Caesars Palace is totally different?  It's definitely better here and his pub should just replicate these ones.  As mentioned by a few other reviewers, the chips aren't authentically British, lacking thickness and shape, but who is really in the business of being ""authentic anything"" in a town where fake Paris, fake New York and fake Egypt are right down the street?  

Remove the famous name off the sign and call it something like ""Fred's Fried Fish"" and this place probably wouldn't last a year on the Linq promenade.

We ordered the three piece fish and chips with a side of artisanal ketchup, curry mango, and sriracha aioli. 

The fish...spectacular! Amazing batter, thin and crispy, golden brown perfectly fried! The fish was flaky, light, and not fishy at all!
The chips..oh man those chips! The crispiest, crunchiest fries I have had! Lightly salted, and amazing with the ketchup

The fish was lightly fried and super flakey. In combination with the sauces (in order of my favorites: curry mango, sriracha aioli, sw ranch, and tartar), it was exactly what I was looking for in a light-mid lunch.

The fish & chips were so delicious. The fish was perfectly breaded and we opted for the 2 ""dirty"" chips option: truffle/parmesan/cheese and bacon/cheddar. I really liked the truffle parmesan fries and they do give you a big handful of them! The bacon/cheddar was just as good but I felt it to be a bit too heavy for my taste because you got savory dips all around with the chips as well.

5675810,2018-01-15,8,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"Ello ello! Looks like it's time for some of the ol' fish and chips. That's about as British as I can get, but at Gordon Ramsay's Las Vegas spot you don't need to be from ""across the pond"" in order to enjoy some wonderfully fried fish. You don't even need to be from England because Ramsay sure isn't (Scottish). All you need is an appetite, and I had that on the final day of my September Vegas family trip. 

I wasn't the only one who wanted something aquatically fried as the line of hungry humans almost reached the door. It gave me a little time to check out the mildly British/fish & chip decor as well as deciding exactly what I wanted...not that it's complicated. Fish, chips (fries), a couple of desserts, and drinks make up most of the menu. You can also get sausage, shrimp, or chicken if you can't handle the usual helping. Though honestly, just get the fish. It's good. Really good.

Of course I did just that and went for a fish and chips combo. There are a few chip styles and so I optioned to get the truffle-parmesan-chive variation. Add on a few dipping sauces and a brew and we have a lunch that, though a little pricy, will blow up your tastebuds with flavor. 

The cooking and building of each basket of fish and chips is like an assembly line, and you can totally watch as you wait around til your number is shouted out. The place is small so seating can be a dilemma. Luckily, I scored a corner spot outside and was able to enjoy my meal even on an oddly windy Nevada day. 

Diving in (semi-pun?), I found the fish to be perfectly flaky and tender with a great breading around it. Sriracha aioli and the essential tartar were superb compliments to the flavor. As for the chips, they were wonderfully fried and had a nice taste to them, but I slowed down towards the end and found myself in a battle of flavor richness. Several fries found a home in the garbage instead of my stomach, but don't get me wrong, I'd order them again.

Overall, Gordon Ramsay knows how to fry up a piece of fish and it shows in each flaky bite. So the place is small and not the cheapest (what is in Vegas?), but it's worthy of curbing your appetite.

Toward the entrance of the Linq is Gordon Ramsay's Fish and Chips restaurant.  It's a tiny place with a handful of tables, and counter stools.  Considering the place is in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip, the prices aren't bad. 

For $14.99, I got the signature Fish and Chips basket, which came with 2 dipping sauces a drink. For $5 more, you can upgrade your soda for an imported beer.  Stephen chose to upgrade to the Innis & Gunn beer, which he gave a thumbs up.

The fish wasn't greasy, and we received 3 generous pieces that was mostly fish, not batter.  The fries were just ok.  I would have preferred them to be a little more crisp, and I think I got the leftover little pieces.

I wish I had taken time to research the place before taking my family and visiting father-in-law for lunch after a go-round on the high roller. I checked the yelp score, saw it said good for kids: yes... away we went. Upon arrival I realized this was not a restaurant but more of a fast food joint, I hesitated but my FIL loves seafood and my husband gave me his nod of approval so we went ahead and ordered. The food was amazing, probably among the best fried fish I've ever had. I had a fish combo with Dirty chips #2 (truffle, chives &parmesan.) Husband had shrimp and dirty chips #1 (chipotle, chorizo and jalapeno.) Kids and Pops had fish and plain fries. What was not great, there is almost no seating. 3-4 tables total and the rest is a small area of bar counters inside and out. It was cold and windy out, so we ended up sitting outside with our 2 kids (2 & 5) scarfing down our $65 of fish and cold fries. Napkins and plastic flatware blowing away in the wind. Also, they don't have trays, so try getting drinks and cartons of food for 5 people without trays ... it was a challenge. There's only one digital (Ie: very complicated) drink machine, extremely impractical with people lining up behind you while you're trying to get drinks for multiple people. So, to be fair - I feel like it's partly my fault for not properly vetting this place. Had the weather been nice, I don't think we'd have minded as much. But if the weather sucks, or if you're with a group and have small kids - this is basically a glorified food stand. Be advised.",H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw,0,0,4,TZebY_6IKLx75dSMYBS-Ew
5736838,2017-06-30,0,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"I've been enjoying excellent Fish & Chips since childhood...having been British educated and lived in Australia, I used to get them wrapped in newspaper.....the way it was done in the old days.....and I absolutely loved it! Then, trying to decide what to have fir lunch today, Gordon's Fish & Chips place popped up on yelp so I figured.....heck with my healthy eating, I'm in Vegas!....and proceeded to walk all the way here in the 106 degree dry heat to get a taste.

Located along the promenade next to The LINQ, it's very easy to spot as there aren't too many British flags and red telephone booth frontages in the whole of the USA, I would think. So in I popped and there was a line....very typical fast food concept....get in the line, decide what you want to order, watch the open kitchen cooks churning out the freshly fried chips (ok, fries in the US) and fish, etc. Then once you get to the order/cashier counter you place your order.....it may be a good idea to decide beforehand whether you want to upgrade the ""dirty"" flavors of your fries to one of the three choices on the board for an extra $2...otherwise you'll just get regular sea salt by default.....as well as choose 2 of the 5 available dipping sauces also on the board. If you don't know which ones you want beforehand the order/cashier lady may get a bit impatient and annoyed with you for holding up the line.....probably trained by Gordon himself.

Anyway, I ordered the Fish & Chip combo, added Dirty sauce #2 - Truffle, Parmesan, Chives to my chips.....and the Curry and Mango and Gordon's Tartar Sauce on the siide. The combos come with a fountain drink (actually, a touchscreen drinks machine)........condiments and plastic utensils located right next to the drinks machine. 

I will say that, based on my long time love of fish & chips, this is perhaps one of the best batter fried fish I have ever had. The batter was not too light and not too heavy....just perfect.... and the white fish so fresh, smooth, and flaky. What really tops it all off were the side sauces. As much as I would have liked to go old school traditional and had it with vinegar, ketchup, and tartar sauce. But the sides I chose were different and still yummy nonetheless.

Ok, now for the chips......not my fave. I don't remember English chips having such a thick and chewy outside. The old chips of London and Australia I'm used to had a very thin, light, and crisp on the outside and soft and fluffy potato on the inside.....there was hardly any soft and fluffy potato on the inside. I ate my chips hoping that it may have been just a few and things would get better, but I quit after having finished just a third of it since I really didn't enjoy them very much. Yea yea yea, if Gordon found out about what I just said, I'm sure he'd be sharing another ""F"" word with me.

There's very limited seating here....kind of like a nice hold in the wall fish & chip joint....mostly counter seating with some just outside. Service as can be expected with a fast food takeaway place.",miDc8Po6mLqWxyvXIQ4meg,1,1,4,D3RUQBvNTYOubCy9c2xPRg

Appearance: Pretty stereotypical ""British"" decor. A 12 year old could of designed it after watching an episode of Eastenders. A sure tourist magnet.

Fish: Not bad. When compared to the last spot where I had fish and chips...Codmothers in SF, I would give this the edge...you can actually taste the fish. It was not heavily battered (+) 

and

Chips: They were warm, lightly seasoned and tasty to dip in your fish sauce. 

So Gordon Ramsay's fish and chips is not exactly going for an award, but they appeal to the masses and serve up a decent portion of fish and chips.

Food: 4

Fish and Chips: Each order comes with 2 sauces. I chose the curry mango and tartar sauce. They make a great tartar sauce that has just the right amount of acidity, and the curry mango was interesting although not my particular cup of tea. The chips were well fried and seasoned. The fish was perfectly fried. It was flaky and moist on the inside and the crust was thick and crispy. My only complaint is that the fish was a tad oily.

5850624,2016-10-18,0,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"We had an out of town guest who said she loved fish and chips. As I had just seen Gordon Ramsay on the news at the ribbon cutting ceremony for his latest Las Vegas restaurant (this is #4 I believe) I thought we'd give it a try. As noted by others the wait is long. The menu is short but does offer a few choices even for those who don't care for cod fillets. The three of us shared one fish and chips combination and one shrimp and chops combination. The fish was excellent, crisp on the outside, not too much breading and tender and moist on the inside. I really liked the shrimp but my wife thought they were a little greasy and didn't care for them as much as my friend or I did. The chips were very good and the amount is really generous; the three of us didn't finish the two servings. As a Las Vegas local I can tell you that the prices are very reasonable, cheap in fact, for anything on The Strip. The only real negative is that there are few places to sit or even stand. Some customers ate outside using a trash can as a table, some sat at tables of other restaurants while we ate sitting on the curb. I would give it five stars if not for the inadequate seating. Regardless I think its great food for what it is at fair prices.",SAdmlwTOxA9p-1GLamEssw,0,0,4,A6YCamL_9vlPtGmBggyVrw

5863639,2018-04-18,11,CVKOPzBVOj3_apFUmZ9ZWw,"This is one of five restaurants on the Vegas Strip with Gordon Ramsay's name on it.  It's located at the LINQ Promenade, the area with various shops and restaurants that lead to the giant ferris wheel (aka High Roller).  It's a casual eatery with a pretty simple menu, although it's not just Fish & Chips. You can get chips with sausage, shrimp, chicken, or Fishwich (fish sandwich).  There's a small selection of desserts, decent selection of beer, and some wine & liquor.  

You can order just chips (without fish), but didn't see an option to just get fish by itself, which I thought was kind of odd.  Standard chips just come with sea salt, but you can order them ""Dirty"" for $2 more.  Dirty #1 comes with chipotle, jalapeño, and crisp chorizo; Dirty #2 comes with truffle, parmesan, and chives; and Dirty #3 comes with bacon and cheddar.  

Combo items come with your choice of two dipping sauces and a fountain drink.  You can upgrade the drink to a beer for $4 or $5 for import beer.  Dipping sauce choices include Curry & Mango, Gordon's Tartar Sauce, Sriracha Aioli, Southwest Ranch, and Dijon Mayonnaise.

My wife and I both thought the fish was excellent, but found the chips to be mediocre.  The fish was crispy on the outside, and very tender and flaky on the inside.  It had no fishy smell or taste.  The chips didn't taste stale but the texture was.  I don't know if that's the classic British style, but it wasn't crisp nor soft.  It was just hard and chewy on the outside.  Perhaps it was overcooked.  My wife wrote her review and said pretty much the same thing.   She asked for a replacement but the server was stingy with the fries, and initially didn't want to replace them.  He eventually did, but the replacement chips weren't any better. 

For dipping sauces we went with Curry & Mango and Gordon Ramsay's Tartar Sauce.  Curry & Mango sauce was good without being too sweet.  The tartar sauce was different than other ones I had in the past.  It was more creamy than sour/tart.  I noticed something similar with the malt vinegar too.  It had a rather subdued flavor and was less acidic than other malt vinegar.

In addition to the fountain drink that came with our meal, we also ordered Peach & Ginger Lemonade spiked with Grey Goose Vodka, which was pretty good.  I would've preferred it with a stronger ginger flavor, but it seems like most of the items here have more of a balanced flavor.  

If I come back here next time, I will ask if there's an option to get fish without chips.  As I mentioned previously, I didn't see that option on the menu, but maybe it's something I have to ask for.",LGa1GmTItb4bu6HI7KPKfA,13,11,4,MyKHYqefSEUKOBZzfF7_zA

Ordering is walk up style and the menu is pretty simple. I chose the fish & chips with regular ""chips"" ( or fries for us Americans) and upgraded my drink to the sticky toffee pudding shake. They do have a couple different flavor options for the fries and you are given two sauces for the fish or chips. I had the tartar sauce and ""artisan"" ketchup. Not sure what was artisan about it, it tasted just like the Heinz they had. 

The order was ready in about 5 minutes as everything is cooked to order. I was surprised I got 3 pieces of fish as I was only expecting 2. It was a decent amount of food for $15. The shake was a $5 up charge. I thought the fish was excellent, cooked crispy on the outside and very moist and flaky inside. The batter was very good in flavor as well. 

The fries were also good, well cooked and crispy. As far as the shake, it was just too sweet for me. Yes, I know its a shake but it was super sweet and just too rich. I much prefer Gordon's actual sticky toffee pudding from Burgr which is outstanding. 

It was a little pricey at $22 for lunch for you are center strip at a celebrity named restaurant so I was expecting it. I would definitely return when back at the Linq.",86RJ2VAQoUypqdf7ZEpEXg,4,2,4,E615OqTPPRy8LxbGphJjFA

The space is nicely themed, with British influences inside and the storefront. Their menu has fish and chips, and some other options in case you're interested in something else.

The last time I was here, my friend and I shared two combos, which include fries and a drink.
+FISH & CHIPS: The fish is so soft and flakey, with a perfectly crisp outside. 
*SHRIMP & CHIPS: The shrimp was not overcooked so it was a nice contrast to the fried batter. There's also herbs in this which is a nice addition. (I personally preferred the fish & chips but my friend said she liked this one better.)

The chips were crispy and goes well with the sauces you can choose. Each combo comes with two, and my preferences are the tartar sauce and the southwest ranch. The curry one seems popular but wasn't for me. Honestly, the combo is quite a lot of fried food and can feel heavy, but it definitely is delicious. For the drinks that come with the combo, they give you a cup and you can refill it with one of their soda machines (where you can choose varying flavors of sodas or teas). 

The space itself is a little weirdly designed. To order, you have to go all the way into the back of the restaurant, which seems to be designed more for takeaway. There is very little seating (which is at the front), and it gets crowded really quickly. People also tend to scout for seats so it can be awkward, especially since the spacing between the seating isn't great. While it's meant for takeout, there isn't much space to sit and eat outside the restaurant where it's located.
