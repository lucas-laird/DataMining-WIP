My co-worker and I normally order a pizza once a week or every couple weeks it depends on our mood. For our delivery yesterday it was as if the driver could care less about our order and just couldn't wait to get out of here. The pizza itself, was as if it was constructed from the pizza Gods and placed ever so gently in the box for our satisfaction. Garlic knots could use some work.

1846758,2018-02-10,0,lhsETIUHGR1aOx8b0M0hPQ,By far one of the worse dominos in Las Vegas. I've had multiple encounters with them messing my order up. The biggest problem I had with them was when I was on my way to the store and I seen a Pizza Hut  driver driving fast as hell in my neighborhood turning onto my block. I then turned around and let the lady know that the pizza was for me and that I needed to go in and grab the money. I paid the driver the pizza fee and turned back inside to go put the pizza down. As I opened the box to grab a slice for my walk to the store I realized how awful the pizza was presented. It was as if someone  just pulled slices apart and it had a piece of onion smacked middle of the pizza. I ran outside to catch the lady but she was already off of my block. I had no phone with service  to call back so I decided to use my app and just reorder the same pizza so I can get what I paid for and I can speak with a manager. The manager (Debbie) tried telling me to pay for the pizza and she will give me $20 credit which made zero sense. I explained to her that I was not paying for the pizza and that my first order was completely messed up. She then told me that I was  not Suppose to pay for the pizza because I had $30 credited towards my account due to an order that my girlfriend and her friend had placed  a few nights before which I had no clue of. I then told her that I felt that they were stealing from me so I needed my money back. I no longer have my $30 credit because of their fuck ups. Debbie lied and said my total was $15 and some change when that was also a lie. She literally argued me down letting me know that I was lying saying my meal was only $11.70 which means I still have $17.30 on credit that she stole from me once again. Just from talking on the phone I seen that Debbie could care less about customer being satisfied. I wouldn't refer the devil to that location after 3 of of 4 orders were wrong. Shoutout to Pizza Hut on nellis and Sahara they always had my order correct .,jQ4kf0_F-MDlfxwcN9i8AA,0,0,1,m9znQT4UsDvhRS1kXa4cRA

Why you may ask? Because I called and explained my dad had a flight to catch and that we needed the pizza to be ready upon arrival and that I wanted to dine in, the lady said oh ok no problem come on in and just ask for plates, it'll be 20 minutes. Well we showed up 25 minutes later and I'm told the pizza was just put into the oven, what? So we wait, fine. I ask for a plate, the lady at the register says I can't give you a plate you're not dining in, I say yes we are and I spoke to the person that took my order. She stares at me for a minute as though she can't figure out who would allow such a thing. She hands me two plates after more explanation, one of which is dirty - keep in mind these are paper plates. Then my dad orders a drink and I want water and she states there is no water, bottled water? No, no water. I'm absolutely mind blown.

The location was filthy, the employees have no regard for their job and quite frankly didn't want to work. I'm not sure why they're still open or even a fine in facility if they don't appreciate patrons.

My wife said something to the delivery driver about how it was over 40 minutes late. She just laughed and said that they are slow. What the heck is that about?

I then try to call the store to let them know I'm not happy about the wait! First call I was on the line 10 minutes and was hung up on. Second call I was on the line for thirty minutes and I finally gave up! Not before o took a screenshot of my wait ! Grrr!

The crust was breaking apart underneath the pizza. I called and they did compensate for the pizzas and the next time I went I didn't have to pay. Now this time I ordered online and 30 minutes after it said my order would be ready my husband was still waiting on the wings. So that means the pizza isn't going to be fresh.

I would like to discuss how poorly staffed and supplied your Pizza Hut chain is. First, the pasta I ordered wasn't available, ok fine I settled for the meaty marinera. Then I ask for plates, oh you don't have enough, that's ok I'll use a napkin. I ask for crushed pepper... Oh you don't have that either? well that's not too bad.... Could I have fork to eat my pasta, what no forks?!?! Are you kidding, how am I suppose to eat my pasta. You could have atleast warned me before I ordered pasta. 

Now, I like pizza hut, and your staff was actually pleasant. But they looked over worked and it's distasteful that your establishment doesn't have eating utensils. I get it, sometimes you will run out of supplies... But that encounter was ridiculous. It's not possible for all of that to run out at the same time. What it really means is, management hasn't ordered the essentials needed for employees to do their jobs. 

At this point, I might as well gone to Little Caesars. Their pizza cost less than half of pizza hut and they have forks, plates and crushed pepper. 

I'm sitting here, still trying to figure out, how I'm going to eat my pasta.
