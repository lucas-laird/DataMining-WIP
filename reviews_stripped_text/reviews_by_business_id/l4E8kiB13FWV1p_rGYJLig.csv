Both soups were just ok; soup was a little on the bland side and the duck tasted like it was cooked yesterday. Wonton soup was alright. 

Overall this local Asian will not be returning to eat here. It wasn't bad, just over priced....$3 for a 12 oz soda and $3 for a can of juice?! Our total for everything was $48.00 not including the tip. Again, portions (everything including drinks) were small.

Well technically it's food from Bao Now that is also the room service option at The Lucky Dragon Hotel. I must say being of Asian descent, it is kind of nice to have a change up on your typical type of room service Americana food. The prices for the food are quite exceptional for room service food and range on average about $9 per item and the portions are pretty good. The boyfriend and I decided to order the loco moco, kimchee fried rice, shrimp tempura, pork adobo, pot stickers, BBQ chicken and Lo Mein. I know it seems like a lot of food but we ordered both for breakfast and lunch. 
Loco Moco- I was impressed for room service food that this was a flavorful dish and done surprisingly well. 
Kimchee Fried Rice- This was average, a bit on the bland side for me and lacking the authentic kimchee flavor that I was looking for. 
Shrimp Tempura-This was average but the dipping sauce was pretty good. 
Pork Adobo-This had pretty good seasoning, a bit different from how I make pork adobo and I couldn't really taste the vinegar but definitely a good take on authentic adobo. 
Lo Mein- This was a bit dry but did have enough flavor without necessarily needing additional soy sauce. 
Pot Stickers- I enjoyed the pot stickers and each dumpling was filled quite well. The shrimp tempura dipping sauce worked well with this dish. 
Overall, for room service food this was definitely pretty good food. You can also have this at their restaurant and as mentioned for the price I'd definitely continue to wat at Bao Now. They also have pretty good hot noodle soup and my boyfriend loves their Bao. 
The customer service is excellent whether room service or at their restaurant and if you eat at the restaurant be sure to get your locals discount at any of The Lucky Dragons restaurant. Happy Eating!!!",PN4U68T2TPhfATDxiISdKA,0,0,4,rsXonY1-KEosCdFLnFF6Gw

Also, I didn't care much for kimchee in my short rib bao. The portion didn't consist of nice, big chunks either, which I'm used to when I get a bao. I tried their won ton soup based on the cashier's recommendation. It was so bland, even after a added the little sauces they gave you. I added some salt, but it wasn't enough. It included a lot of thin noodles that were kind of hard. Won ton soup usually doesn't have noodles, so I found this strange.",y5YNzZwQuYxgE-jSDcZLxA,0,0,2,SXqRzwYbGd78Bz8A51bL9w

The ginger fried chicken one was really good and I preferred it over the char siu bao. The noodle soup was fine and for a morning meal is good, but once other options open up then this would not be a go-to option for me.

Everything came out lukewarm even the noodle soup. The saddest was probably the Jap Chae. It's basically boiled noodles in salt water with 3 pieces of green onion, a piece of fish cake and some boiled mushrooms. Everything was so bland and plain that soy sauce and chili sauce couldn't help. 

The waitress was rude A/F. When she came to serve our food all she said was ""how many"", like WTF, how many what? Apparently she was trying to ask how many people we had. When I tried to complain about the food all she had to say was she didn't know, she didn't take the order. I told her the food had no flavor but she didn't care and walked away. 

I really don't know how anyone gave his place more than 1 star. If I could give it negative stars it would be - 5 stars. 

What we ordered:
Wonton noodle soup
Short rib and Kim Chee bao
Kim Chee fried rice 
""Jap Chae"" in quotes because it really wasn't Jap Chae

It took 30 minutes for this mess to come out. There was only 1 person who ordered ahead of us and 2 ""chefs"" in the kitchen (kitchen is viewable).

I have mixed reviews about this place after my 2nd visit here, but I'm rounding up since they're still new. I came here late around 11pm, and they ran out of about half of the menu items. 

Pork belly bao- drenched in grease all around, and the pork belly was more like saut√©ed pieces of bacon with hardly picked vegetables. And who puts mayonnaise in their baos? 

Braised beef bao- much better than the pork belly. The beef was tender and sandwiched between a warm bun. But still with the bad picked carrots/daikon and the mayonnaise. We covered it with hoisin and sriracha sauce 

Egg tarts-Portuguese style egg tarts, perfectly warm and toasted. My favorite part of this place and I'd come back just for this. It was very expensive for only 2 pieces, but it was bigger than your average egg tart

Hainan chicken rice- should hardly be called this. Very deceiving and disappointing. It's basically boiled chicken sitting on top of ginger flavored rice, topped with a few veggies and the same ""pickled"" veggies. No chili or ginger sauce here, which should be standard for Hainan chicken. 

I'd avoid getting the Bao dishes, despite the name of the restaurant. They use the same kitchen as dragons alley, so a lot of the food is similar. This would definitely be a great place for a late night drunken meal.",dY6GK465j-kLlrXalgdsNA,1,0,3,k78OFp8kKoQdskpoYrcSBw

We took a look at the menu & decided to order the braised beef baos, the roasted duck noodle soup w/ thick egg noodles, & the beef stew noodle soup also w/ thick egg noodles. 

I like that you can watch the cook through the glass so I didn't get too bored as we waited for them to make all of the food for the big group ahead of us. It's a pay at the counter & order your food at the counter type restaurant which I've become a fan of. They also have you pick up your own food at the counter when it's done but the nice lady walked all of our food to our table when it was done. 

I was a little nervous to go here because it's still brand new & the reviews are mixed! But I really was craving some bao! So why not try this place called ""Bao Now""?! The braised beef baos were very good. The insides were perfect but I wish the bao bun was just a liiiiittle bit sweeter! I loved loved LOVED my roasted duck egg noodle soup! The duck was cooked perfectly & was so delicious! The broth was flavorful & the noodles were good. The Chinese broccoli in it added a nice crunch. Yum! 

My boyfriend had the beef stew noodle soup & it was good! He added two little cups of hot sauce in it & it tasted quite similar to Pho, we liked it! But the next day, he was throwing up a lot of the food he ate here, all day. & feel like he has the stomach flu. We think it could have been because of something he ate here but are not positive!!! 

Anyways....
I'm glad I tried this place out because I loved the food & the service was wonderful. It's a little small w/ few tables & chairs & if it's busy, you may not have a place to sit down. It's not super over-priced either & it's in the new Lucky Dragon Casino so it's a good excuse to see the place!!",dDe8K-gvBXuqp2zXmUFotg,1,0,4,_pnlhwGzdyMLb0yHcPAeKA

My wife and I stopped in to try the food as we saw some good reviews.  We were disappointed when we got our orders. 
I had the wonton noodle w/shrimp, it had maybe 4 in it. The vegetable in it was long and had a hard time biting through it. It did have a good amount of noodles but the broth was a little bland. 
My wife is not big on this type of food so she got the teriyaki chicken, which was missing the teriyaki and it had 3 little pieces about 1 inch x 1 inch on each bun. ""Where's the chicken"". 
We also ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings which had no salt or pepper anywhere to be tasted. 
All in all we were not happy with the food or the cost, $30.88. Plus 2.50 each for a small bottle of coke. 
If anyone would like a good bowl or soup go to where I go and get their ""war wonton soup w/noodles"" at Great Wall on West Charleston.

Bao Now is actually quite decent for a brand new resto (this is review #5) in a brand new hotel/casino in Las Vegas. The casino floor was pretty empty and the area is small compared to other casinos. 

The cashier was friendly, although her explanation of the noodle soups got pretty confusing. When we asked for Beef Noodle Soup (expecting the typical Taiwanese style dish), she mentioned they ran out of beef balls, and would it be okay to replace them with fish balls? We definitely didn't want that. She recommended maybe doing a Pho style soup but with the egg noodles. We were even more perplexed why a Chinese resto was doing pho. That didn't sound good either. 

It turns out we made good choices that night. We'd already had the **Pork Belly Bao** in mind and it was excellent. Their take on the bao is very interesting with a flavorful bun and really good pork belly to accompany it. Since I really wanted a soup, we finally settled on the **Roast Duck Noodle Soup**. It was extremely hearty and rich in flavor, and really hit the spot.

Prices are pretty reasonable considering this is in a Las Vegas hotel/casino. It was under $20 for our 2 dishes. Don't expect actual Chinatown street food prices, people. That just doesn't make any sense. 

3.5 STARS rounding up since the food was good, hot, and came out fast. It's borderlining to a round-down due to confusion on the concept, but I'm adding in a little good faith they'll step up their game.

TIP: Odd hours seem to be the perfect time to visit. Hardly any wait at all!

TIP 2: Prepare to be a little confused when ordering.

The first time I came here, I was lured that they served boba special. But never got boba because it wasn't....normal milk tea. Their options where pre-flavored, like mango or strawberry milk teas. 

It's located in the Lucky Dragon Casino, which is very tailored to Chinese gamblers. Chinese (Cantonese/Mandarin) pop music plays in the background. It's generally a very small casino in relation to the others in Vegas. (Kinda next to Stratosphere) Small note: they can bring you fruit while you gamble (instead of cocktails)

The main reason this place is 3 stars, in my opinion, is it's seriously not very good. I guess after trying a few casino casual dining experiences, I should really lower my expectations that these establishments are definitely casino first, restaurant dead last. Bao Now promotes a stereotype by trying to add other popular Asian cuisines in their menu which doesn't work. There's pad Thai, Kim chi Fried Rice, Pancit all in the same menu --definitely trying to be a Jack of all trade, and master of none.

Here's a few notes I jotted down: 

My friends had the kimchi fried rice, which he thought was gross (flavorless). The wait was also very long (over 15 minutes)

The Spicy Korean Beef Noodle Soup is redeemable, if you didn't consider it Korean and just as a bowl of soup with lots of vegetables/noodles. 

Do not get the Spam Masubi. Ono Hawaiian just blows this place out of the water, and then spears it.

Just get the congee. It's $2.50, if you like it plain.

The staff...try. You can tell there's one or two staff that try to make this place work. Matthew (December 2017) looks like he knows what he is doing. But the 'supervisors' (Asian guys in suits) look like they freshly graduated from an MBA program in hospitality with no work experience. They don't really know how to use the cash register or don't know where the items are in the POS. In addition, I overheard a number of customers saying their Room Credits weren't applying correctly. I don't know what that's all about, but if there's smoke, there's definitely fire. Basically, eat here if you crave congee or are staying at the Lucky Dragon.

The roast duck noodle soup was delicious. The portions of duck was more than I expected and had excellent flavor, the veggies were very fresh and cooked perfectly, I would have liked just a tad bit more noodles since there was so much duck. It taste like something I would have been able to get back home in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of course the price would be much less, but this is Vegas, so I wouldn't call it unreasonable. This dish was $13.88. 

The egg tarts were not great, but I've had worse. I would skip the egg tarts. The custard was not smooth and creamy. A little on the grainy side. Definitely not like the famous Golden Gate Bakery in SF Chinatown. I guess it can do in a pinch if you really wanted some. The price of these were ridiculous though. $6.88 for two!!! Should be more like $4.99 or $5.99 at the very most. Or $6.88 for three would be decent for Vegas at a place like this. 

The Vietnamese iced coffee was probably the best deal. Nice size, taste great, and was only $3.88!

I'd come back, especially since they are open 24 hours!",epIaRiDgLhitB9CEw1OxIA,1,1,4,plLL9NmKTB4DGM3s9v7tnA

I liked the vegetable noodles.  Not a ton of veggie/Vegan options, but I was starving, so I wasn't too picky.  Only downside is really, $8 for a bottle of water?  Maybe that's typical for Vegas, but all I could think of was, ""I can get a case of water at Costco, for about 2.99.""",Xcc0K_MOu7ALwEu5Q0B7Dw,0,0,3,e4zhhYyRveEbHjdobiTVgw
