It leaked through the boxes, had to have newspaper under to protect our counter. It was so unbearable we had to set each slice on a paper towel so we didn't just eat grease. It didn't appear to be from the cheese or pepperoni, I have never seen such a greasy bottom of a pizza. Once the grease was soaked out, it was a delightful pizza. The Cin Stix were equally greasy though so I can't figure out what the deal was. Plan to give it another try, for the price, and vicinity to our home.",72nqZGaZIFUKNAIIMgtyXg,3,1,3,TqbaIov4nN0Uk0fezDg6KQ

I called 20 mins before I got here for a pickup order that was promised to me be ready in 20-25 mins, when I got here, the guy took my payment and said I 'll get it out to you as soon it's ready thinking that it is. I look back and to my surprise, he just started preparing my order and ended up waiting 20 additional minutes. I can see this pizza place from my backyard, but I think I'll go elsewhere from now on.

395427,2013-10-08,0,DiCfRiL3WX-vwkK85qrIjw,"I live here in Providence, and was actually online to see if anyone knew when the new Cafe was opening, as my husband is a brekfast person , and was SHOCKED to see some of the people writing awful reviews about Jims Pizza. I am not a YELPER like many of you are, as I have a busy schedule, being that my husband and I own ourselves 3 local business' in town, but I was so saddened to see what people were writing about this great place, I had to give my two cents.

To start, my family, especially my teenager and her friends have ordered Jims Pizza many times, and it is fantastic!  Always tastes fresh, crust is amazing, and it gets to our door of hungry teenagers fast.  Maybe the people complaining about Jims Pizza, are just use to eating junk food and the ""fast food craze"" and just got used to eating the cheap tasting pizza from places like Dominos and Pizza Hut, and their taste buds just cant realize what good pizza tastes like anymore, as Jims Pizza is great.  I always got great, friendly service as well.   I met the owner once, about 6 months ago, had a conversation with him, and he is a very nice man who works hard for his business.

Secondly, most of you probably never owned a business and while your review may just be a random sentence on the internet to you, but to a business owner its the ability to provide for his family and his loved ones. To us business owners, we put  our heart and sole into our business', its our dream.  Please don't give me the excuse ""the public has the right to know about   the service"" or ""maybe if we publicly give our input, they will change their recipe""  While many of you may not know this, your asking a man to risk his business, cost him money so that MAYBE it will appeal to your taste buds.  As I said my husband and I own 3 local business', well, there use to be a 4th one, it  was a very popular local place in town, that many of you would be familiar with, but for reasons I am listing, I am choosing not to list it, nor give my ""real name"" as well, as after reading and knowing how some of you, including members of Providence decided to write awful things about Jims Pizza, I don't need you writing any of our business bad reviews, just to be spiteful. Anyways, it wasn't till we owned that fourth one, that we realized how many bad, spiteful, and jealous people there are in Las Vegas.  I thought the world was a better place than this.  We helped out people by the day, gave them our sweat and blood, and got crap from those same people we helped, it got so bad that when a building disaster occurred, we took it as a blessing to get out of it, and closed it, which hurt us deeply, but was time to focus on our other business, and move on. We couldn't be more happier, as I don't have to deal with the general public at that level as I did then, and while we miss some of our wonderful regulars that we created awesome memories with, there was just too many awful ones and many freeloaders.  Just please remember that there are many aspects to a business that many of you who work a 9-5 job don't understand, and won't. While it may seem easy to ask a business to change to your liking, even just a simple request, are not that easy and expensive to any business owner. Also for you that complained about the $2.50 delivery charge, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT JIMS PIZZA OVERHEAD IS, AND IF THAT HELPS HIM KEEP HIS DOORS OPEN, THEN HE NEEDS TO DO THAT.  YOU YELPERS SEEM TO ASK ALOT FROM THESE PEOPLE.  ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE, I GUARENTEE THAT SOME OF THESE POSTS ARE WRITTEN FROM JIMS PIZZA COMPETITORS FRIENDS, FAMILY MEMBERS,REGULARS, AS IVE PERSONALLY HAD THAT HAPPEN TO ME.  COMPETITORS CAN BE CRUEL, SO FOR YOU THAT HAVEN'T TRIED JIMS PIZZA, PLEASE IGNORE THESE POSTS AS HALF OF THEM ARE PROBABLY WRITTEN FROM HIS COMPETITORS. AND TO YOU PEOPLE THAT ARE WRITING FALSE REVIEWS, ITS ONE THING TO SUPPORT YOUR FAVORITE PLACES, ITS ANOTHER THING TO BULLY HIS COMPETITOR AS YOUR DOING HERE. 

NEXT  FOR YOU THAT LIVE IN PROVIDENCE WRITING THESE REVIEWS I AM SHOCKED.  ALL OF US SHOULD BE GIVING THE LOCAL BUSINESS' IN PROVIDENCE OUR LOCAL SUPPORT AND GET BEHIND THEM! THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE LAS VEGAS BECAUSE WE HAVE NO CULTURE OR SENSE OF COMMUNITY, AND THEY ARE RIGHT!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE? IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THEIR PIZZA, MAYBE WRITE OR EMAIL THEM A LETTER, THERE IS NO REASON TO PUBLICALY HUMILATE A BUSINESS, AND IF THAT DOESN'T WORK, MOVE ON AND EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.  AFTER ALL, BEING A YELPER, IS NOT GOING TO GET YOU ANYWHERE, AS I NOTICED, THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF YOU, SO IF YOUR WANTING TO BE A FOOD CRITIC, GET A WEBSITE TO STAND OUT, OR A BLOG, AS YOUR NOT GOING TO STAND OUT HERE.  BEHIND THIS BUSINESS IS A PERSON, A FAMILY, SO PLEASE KEEP THAT IN MIND WHEN YOU POST.  REGARDLESS, MY FAMILY WILL CONTINUE TO EAT THEIR DELICOUS PIZZA, AND STAND BEHIND A LOCAL BUSINESS THAT IS HERE IN PROVIDENCE.  THANK YOU JIMS PIZZA FOR YOUR GOOD FOOD AND KIND SERVICE.  KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK",7pkHvgWceC4DOH6kSIsLtQ,0,0,5,_JqwDfsWFfqCh3-3yyOzyQ

I ordered what appeared to be a good pizza and initially noticed that the price seemed a little high for a medium pizza($12). I do have to give them credit for having the pizza ready in a short matter of minutes, but after taking a bite out of one slice I quickly regretted my decision to give this place a chance. The pizza lacked flavor and tasted like it had experienced freezer burn, which I found curious because the box advertises fresh dough as being their trademark. Bottom line, if you are thinking about trying Mr. Jim's pizza don't. Save your money and order Dominoes, Pizza Hut, or I would even recommend Little Caesar's.",gbpzw8hyvMbWWpY8Nehzlw,6,0,1,lbieyLbqdF4Q_iO2oh5Qog

We love that Mr. Jim's has something that everyone in my family loves.  With 6 people to please it can sometimes be hard.  The employee's are always very friendly and willing to create a pizza just about any way I want to order it!  

My favorite is something that is unique to Mr. Jim's and that is their nacho stixs.  The thin crust is so crunchy and perfect.  I always hate it when thin crust is floppy.  Not at Mr. Jim's!

We ate at Mr. Jim's one time while my parents were visiting from out of town and even my mom who is pretty picky when it comes to pizza declared it a place she needs to eat at every time she visits!

I also love that they always have a good special going on.  With the coupons you can get high quality pizza that is made fast and fresh for about the same cost as the other guys that have their pizza sitting in a heating box for hours.

We have moved out to North Las Vegas and still make the drive to get this pizza, probably our favorite pizza place in town.",iU9B-c8azHA_wLIuvgIP-Q,1,0,5,bAdnk7CY1SJwD0KXpLsRwA
731743,2015-01-10,2,DiCfRiL3WX-vwkK85qrIjw,"Extremely unprofessional! The employees were calling a customer who left a bitch in front of me, another customer and their manager. One male employee told the manager they were putting a note on the woman's account to not take orders from her anymore. The manager said no and the employee told her he was bc she was a bitch all bc she's illiterate and can't read a menu right. The manager said we aren't going to do that and walked off. A couple minutes later the employee announced to everyone that he put a note on her account to not take orders from her again. Then a few other employees joined in on bad mouthing the customer. The manager came back to the front and I told her that I didn't appreciate her employees talking poorly of other customers in front of customers. The manager said she agreed and I said, but you let him proceed on and talk poorly. You also said for him not to put a note on her account and he did it anyways and announced it. She said she didn't think he did and I said he did bc you left and walked to the back and he stayed on the computer and announced shortly after that he put a note in her account. She said she would check and remove it to make sure she can order. I said you are the manager and your employees don't respect you. They are cussing about customers in front of customers and blowing you off and doing what they want. She said she's had problems with their language and doesn't like how they cuss up front like that and will address it. I said you are the manager, you set the tone. I told her when they were cussing you should have cut it off right there. The whole staff is a bunch of punk teenagers, the manager is a meek teenager herself that all the employees know they can walk all over, which was quite evident to what I witnessed while waiting on my pizza. Where are the adults at this establishment!!?? Clearly, these feeble minded children have a lack of respect for the job they were hired to do, the authority put in place and for the paying customers. Then to top it off as I was walking out to my vehicle with my pizza, one of the employees returning from a delivery came speeding through the parking spaces, didn't even slow down when they saw me and sped past within 2 ft of me to park in front of the pizza place. I am 8 months pregnant! What kind of ill-mannered circus is this business running here?!? Absolutely no respect!

We ordered off a regular coupon we get $17.99-large pizza with 8 wings.  We ordered our pizza-light on the cheese, extra sauce, pepperoni and pineapple and wings hot.  This was the worst pizza we have ever had.  First off my ""extra sauce"" and ""light cheese"" ended up with a full jar of sauce poured on top of the pizza-you couldn't even see cheese.  The pizza was a red sauce mess minus the crust.  Soggy bottom crust was the same as I remember the last time.  Totally dough in the middle-and their crust is what they pride themselves on.  SMH.  You can't even hold a slice up without a limp tip. Lol. Wings....drum roll....were slimy.  They came 4 in a foil pouch and they were completely stuck to the foil.  My guess is they already had them packaged up and they throw them in an oven to reheat them?  The BF finished them off on the grill and they were ok after that.  

Best part to me was the $2.50 delivery charge!  For living in Providence and 2 secs away from the place really?  Shoot if the food was worth it....all day long for our laziness.  But no ...pure disappointment and bummer that this is the only spot right smack in our hood.  I am so sad to say that I gave this a second chance before my review and its a total bust.

Mr. Jim's has a thicker crust than most of the pizza places including the other pizza places in the area. Toppings and sauce are fresh. Mr. Jim's also tends to be one of the more generous places on toppings.  Just be aware when you are ordering there are two versions of pizza here: the Original and the D'Lish. The D'Lish is a thin crust version of their pie and has less fat. It has less cheese and less toppings, but remember its a thin crust pie.
They offer pizzas in four sizes, small to extra large.
I ordered the Sticky Fingers pizza with a small order of breadsticks. This has become a new favorite in my book. It is thick with a very tasty crust and a lot of toppings for the price. The breadsticks are basically the pizza dough with cheese on it, sounds plain but it is very delicious and quite filling.
I am originally from Northern NJ, probably one of the better places for pizza. So probably for me to say this, it means a lot. The one and only gripe is that the food is really greasy. Do not get me wrong, pizza grease is where the flavor comes from, but the grease was everywhere on the box.
Delivery is slightly above average. Time-wise was average, but I like the fact that the driver actually verifies the order you have. I know it sounds so minor, but it is something that makes them stick out from the other deliveries that I've gotten.
I recommend that you order online the first time to see the menu and get some pretty good coupons. Prices with the coupon tend to be lower than the other guys.
Ordering online is even better as a group because you can bill items separately. So if everyone just wants pizza but your foodie friend wants pizza, wings, bread, and dessert, you can mark what items are hers- and she can pay for those items separately.
So if you want some thick crust pizza with so many toppings that it collapses, this is your place.",4K4Hhmcd_KXgYI3RXT6lTw,1,0,4,8Nyobolu_bNBQA2XikI_GA

Also, the toppings were full and loaded, and the sauce was tangy and plenty. I never felt the pizza became dry, even after it started to cool down when I got to my last slice. You get your money's worth.

2705171,2015-04-27,2,DiCfRiL3WX-vwkK85qrIjw,"This is a really tough review to write because some things went right and others went really wrong.  

I ordered 10 pizza's to be delivered to a park for my daughter's 2nd birthday party.  I first called a few days ahead to see what there prices and specials might be for that type of order.  When speaking to the person on the phone they said we could do $6 cheese or pep, or 7.99 3 topping pizza's.  I asked him other questions like size, how many slices, crust options, etc.  and he handled all of those really well.  then I asked if they could deliver to a park and he said he would have to call me back in a few to ask his manager.  Odd, why was there no manager on duty or present at all times.  He did call me back in a few moments and said it would be no issue.  

I decided the best way to order the pizza was to drive down there and place the order and pay for it a day ahead.  This is where it gets interesting.  I am glad I went down there but also not because of what else was happening on a Friday afternoon at the store.  There was one other person waiting for an order on a bench.  So I approached the counter and started to speaking to Alex about what I needed.  He was quick to help me.  I started placing the order and telling him I need  pizza's delivered Saturday o a park.  He said no problem.  When I was giving him my order he was quoting 7.99 one topping and not the $6 pizza price or the 7.99 in store was listed as $8.50 for 3 topping.  He stated they gave me the school pricing? which I was not???  Anyway's I continued with my 10 pizza order and said call me when you get the pricing fixed up and I will be happy to pay for it with my debit card.  Alex did not have the access or maybe the training to apply the discount for the previous quoted pricing.  

That's not all this poor kid Alex was trying to deal with me while one other young women was in the back cooking and making pizza's.  The phone was ringing off the hook 2-3 times. The women who was waiting for her order began being impatient for waiting 40+ minutes for a pickup order that was waiting in the hot box for who know's how long.  She was pretty upset and I am not sure she will be back.  All Alex could do and did do to every guest on the phone is appologize.   ""I'm sorry were really busy"" ""i'm sorry I don't know why she didn't give you your pizza from the hot box"" ""I'm sorry I don't know why they gave you the wrong price"" .... and on and on.  This poor kid was working by himself with mind you on a Friday afternoon when people are ready to get dinner.  All of this confusion made me unsure if my order would arrive on time or at all for my daughter's birthday.  Oh yeah the manager called me about 9:45 pm to get my credit card info because ""they have had problems with people not being present before at park locations""...???

  Where on earth was the manager or owner for that matter.  How do they expect to operate a successful business with out being present.  I am sure they lost several hundred dollars that day because they did not have the restaurant staffed properly for a FRIDAY night pizza delivery business.  On top of that, all over the lobby were flyers stating that they will be closed for the Sabbath starting in May.  It's one thing to be proud of your beliefs and what you stand for but when you start promoting that throughout your business.  On your door, counters, and every pizza box top you have in the building.  I think it would be easier to just hire somebody to work that day for you and just take the day off Larry H.  Your weekend of Friday, Saturday and Sunday consists of probably 50% of your weekly revenue and to just eliminate an entire day seems absurd.  Unbelievable!  It would be interesting to read the Mr Jim's Franchise agreement to see if that is even allowed with out approval from  the corporate office. 

For the record we did get our order at the time requested of 12:30-12:45.  The Driver showed up right on time.  The food was fresh and hot and every pizza was made as ordered.  The ingredients were good and the cheese seemed to be of good quality.  D'lish crust was very tasty.  Everyone at the party thought the pizza was very tasty and were very impressed.  I only told them of the good things about the business and where it was located and you might have some new fans of MR. Jim's.

  Too bad you might have some operational issues to address with your scheduling and training.  I am willing to give you another try.  I would start by ensuring having a responsible manager on duty at all times.  These 20 year old kids are not gonna bring your business success.",8fsZcLADFrPTbGrFqMACpg,4,1,3,1WuG--4h0QfMshpODYfCXw

How rude!  I have spent a lot of money at this store, but it is obvious they are willing to lose a good customer over a misunderstanding.

I explained the situation and said that I didn't want the driver to come all the way back but could they just credit my account for the next time to which he replied ""It's only $.60..."" and just stopped talking.  My husband overheard this and grabbed the phone and said ""I just spent $40 of my hard earned money at your store and this is how you treat me?"" then Ben said ""if your going to talk to me that way I will hang up"".

4986832,2013-09-09,1,DiCfRiL3WX-vwkK85qrIjw,"I was hoping that I would not have to write a bad review.  I am a regular Mr. Jim's customer, I like their food, and I have never had a problem with their establishment.  Until today. Short version: Mr. Jim's messed up on an order, a bad review was posted, and an uncalled for response full of assumptions, untruths, and excuses was posted in response.  Long version: My friend placed an order for our group and my husband picked it up on his way home. The pizza's were handed to him and he left.  He didn't know that wings had been ordered as well.  My friend called to get his wings and Mr. Jim's could not fix the situation.  So I did. I picked up the wings and everything was fine.  Until I read the response that Mr. Jim's posted to John's review. Please feel free to look it up. 

TO MR JIM'S PIZZA: 
1) My husband's initials are not A.L. Neither are mine.  I do not know where you pulled that from or why that would even be necessary to include in your response. 2) It doesn't matter who picks up the order, you should always double check it even if it is not a ""regular order."" 3) In your response you say that John admitted he had been drinking...my friend had consumed two beers. You made it sound like he was a raging drunk. He's just responsible and didn't think that it appropriate to drive to fix your mistake. Again, relevant to your response why?! 4)Pick up order or not, if you messed it up you should have fixed it.  You later state that, ""You suppose you could have offered to deliver them."" You suppose?! Of course you could have.  Then this whole mess and second one star review could have been avoided.  A simple, ""I'm sorry sir, I'll make a fresh batch to send with the next available driver,"" and everyone would have been happy. We would have been willing to wait an hour if you would have been willing to fix what you messed up. We understand busy business. We do not understand bad customer service. 5) I was annoyed at the situation. NOT my friend.  You both should have handled it differently.  I did say that he might have had a bad day. I did say I had not heard him speak bluntly to someone like that.  Does that justify your bad customer service? NO.  Is that an excuse to claim extortion on a yelp review? NO. You were correct in stating that I left without saying anything to the MEN in my group. They would not have been agreeable to me fixing what you should have.  6) John is a UNLV graduate and employee.  I shared that information with you so that you would know that he was both educated and is surrounded by and works with people that are also educated as well as respectful.  Of course he most definitely is used to people being respectful because we surround ourselves with other educated and respectful people. I did not call him a ""big shot"" thank you very much sir. Nor was his position used as any kind of leverage. Yet again...what does this have to do with your lack of customer service?! 7) I appreciated the apology and the brownie was delicious.  I fixed your mess up, including your lack of customer service, and accepted your apology and the proffered brownie.  Why did you feel the need to go onto a public forum and belittle your regular customers?  You have several negative reviews. It's my firm opinion that if you spent half as much time developing customer service skills as you apparently spend defending why you have no customer service, your reviews would improve! 8) We actually do yelp positive reviews to businesses frequently... when a business offers outstanding customer service.  We enjoy your pizza but there has been nothing about the service that has gone above and beyond the normal expected level to warrant going on an writing a glowing review.  9) My final comment here...why in the world would you think that throwing out your education would make this situation any better?  You had a second chance to make this right and instead you have dug a deeper hole AND manage to turn away another regular customer.  I'm deeply saddened by your reactions, I expected more from a business that seemed to have so much more to offer in the early operating stages.  Thank you for your time.  I sincerely hope that you can turn things around for your business and start focusing on customer service, kindness and consideration, and on appropriately fixing your negative reviews instead of childishly lashing out at loyal customers.

My wife and I now enjoy their D'Luxe pizza with thicker crust and double toppings which is extra-specially good (and still reasonably priced) so we've continued to order on a near weekly basis.

We've also tried the Nacho Stix, Sticky Fingers pizza, and more! Everything is really, really good!
OH, then you have the service: Everyone we've encountered in the store has been extra friendly and helpful. Always a pleasant experience!

Months later, the kids are still loving Mr. Jim's. The prices are still reasonable. PLUS, they're located in Providence, so we don't have to travel far, deal with traffic, or otherwise. Win-Win for everyone!


One other thing: You can use an ""app"" called Level Up to pay, which gives you $2 off your order. A nice little treat for those with ""smart phones"". Of course, all the regular ways to pay (cash, credit card) still work.",viUJFHb9jIHJYpUv07MeVg,0,0,5,i65Jf_P4Wg_EGzt3F94oGw
