Luckily, noticed Gogo on Yelp and saw it was conveniently located right across the street at Fashion Show mall. Went up to the 3rd floor thinking it would be in the food court but it is actually on the first floor at K1850 near Macy's Men. 

First thing I noticed was the very friendly staff that greeted me. I will say that their fish didn't look as fresh as I typically would like to see and it didn't really feel chilled like I prefer it. Overall it was good, not great. 

I did find the vegetables to be more fresh looking and tasting. They had good sauces as well. 

Another thing is that I think it's a little more pricey than most Poke places. I got the large (3 scoops) plus 1 extra scoop ($1.99) and my total was around $16.50. 

I would definitely go back and probably will tomorrow because I know I can get a tasty meal that is macronutrient friendly for me.

The other fix ins were all tasty as well. The whole meal was quite light and fresh so my stomach felt good after finishing it!

With my mall discount it's just under $10, so it's a decent deal. (Pro tip: they don't ask for any type of proof you are a mall employee, but if you lie, God will know.)

I got the Gogo bowl, which comes with a choice of brown or white rice, salad, a mix of tuna and salmon cubes, wakame (seaweed salad), krab, corn, cucumber, and a few other veggies. The ginger sauce was nice and bright, and tossed with the salad greens and the fish. The tuna was bland though, and tasted very frozen/watery. The salmon was better; richer and better texture. I wish the rice was mixed with sushi vinegar but instead was served hot, with cold ingredients on top. I didn't care for that.

The portion size looked good at first. They aren't stingy with the amounts of fish/krab/seaweed, but still didn't keep this little Asian girl full for much longer than an hour. A plus though was if you order it to go, you get a lid on your reusable plastic bowl. A bowl I can use to pack my own lunch next time.",sELpZpITOy9abQB3YY2Ugg,3,3,3,pugyT2Dk8-eVHLjAZA6XrQ

Gogo poke is hidden in a quiet corner of fashion show mall between the escalators. The vegetables and salmon were fresh, however, the spicy salmon was not. I imagined the spicy salmon to be marinated whole pieces of salmon, but it was mashed up salmon which was not fresh, not spicy and weird tasting. Though it was refreshing to eat something with rice and vegetables after a few days of heavy food in Vegas, but this poke is average. Most of all, it was because they were stingy in the sauces, only marinating the salmons with the sauce, so the whole poke was pretty bland after mixing together.

First, the poke: the salmon is VERY good! Fresh, soft, good portion cuts, etc. However, the ahi (tuna) poke was chewy, muscular and tasted/felt like it was just thawed out. Also, $11-$12 poke bowl like this should come with much more poke! Which brings me to my next point...

Service: we had the larger of the two guys who working 11/25/2017 at approx. 7p. My wife speaks English as a second language and it's not easy for her to always communicate. Our guy who made our poke was not hospitable towards her effort at communicating (he would interject when she spoke, showed on his face he was exasperated trying to speak to her), AND gave her noticeably less poke than me! Working with him was all in all uncomfortable and made us feel unwelcome.

It's not a bad poke bowl, but it's not worth the price tag, the service can improve, and the ahi tuna could be improved. Go!ku in West Las Vegas had better raw fish IMO, but they are first and foremost a ramen place and off the strip, so take that into consideration if you're taxi'ing/ walking.",IJX-JC_Fc5WfVH61ClDOrw,1,0,3,Z6eg4Yw7EtrcZfRXBo_xiQ

5746645,2017-07-08,0,U4ncU-YfIipnTetJDZLGlw,I know there are tons of Poke places in Vegas. But this place hits the spot for being on the north end of the strip. The portions are generous and they allow you to put as many toppings as you want. Secondly this is located in the Fashion District Mall so while you shop this is a great and clean choice to fill up and refuel.,PmWj-kWHSefLthNYgIu_Ug,3,1,5,Fh3lqT1B91O3Pyzt8Cts1w

Its pretty easy to order and I had no issues. The staff was pretty friendly and I went during an off time so it was pretty empty and most importantly...it was cheap.

For a poke bowl on the strip, the price is relative. Any cheaper and you can expect food poisoning. Can't skimp on things like fresh fish. Maybe it's the sound of lots of people talking in the mall that prevents me from giving them 5 stars, but that's really not their fault. I've tried lots of different poke places in Vegas, California, Hawaii, and NY. The poke bowl here is just like any other place.

Food here is good, comparable to most poke bowl places I have been to. It is certainly not the best poke bowl you will have, but it was actually better than I expected consider it is a small place stuck in between two escalators. The scoops seem smaller than other places, which is understandable since this is a tourist area. Fish was fresh and topping varieties were acceptable. I will be back next time I am in the mall.",oK1v-yP9ygKWg6M19wWYIQ,1,0,5,Kpo-cK5FV8voDo5tonwgPw
5876237,2017-08-22,14,U4ncU-YfIipnTetJDZLGlw,"When you brave the mall on a Saturday, no matter what city you're in, you deserve a treat. When you brave the mall on a Saturday in Las Vegas, you deserve a poke bowl.

I was handling some returns and needed a snack. I had passed by Gogo Poke while I was purchasing said returns but wasn't hungry at the time. I'm a big fan of poke, because Hawaii has my heart, so I'm always on the hunt for a great spot. Gogo wins for many reasons, the biggest one is that it was in my face at the moment I needed it most.

The set-up is simple. You walk right up, or wait in line when there is one, and start with your base. I did half salad, half white rice. I was surprised to find they don't toss the greens so, note to self to ask for that next time. I went with salmon and tuna tossed with a ginger sauce and spicy mayo. This was recommended by the friendliest guy behind the glass, who was basically telling me all of his favorite mixes. The fish was tossed with a perfect amount of sauce and I topped it with some seaweed salad, green onion, and sesame seeds. My poke bowl was exactly the combo I needed at the time.

I'm not math wizard, but I think your options are endless. #science",NhgU7RhuYYFmpkb1jlYJ6Q,24,16,5,z0KCIFFXwX4coIn26b2DYg

It's definitely worth the wait being said that it's easily accessible in the mall. A very awesome spot to be. They produce excellent products where you get to forge your very own bowl, crafted to your liking. A very well-balanced team that cater to your needs. But most importantly, the freshness of what they serve. 

This place offers an adequate sitting area and their price range is very flexible. Very good for our ""price-sensitive"" consumers!

Ordered the large bowl with greens, 3 protein scoops (I did salmon, tuna, spicy tuna), added my add ons (avocado $1 but worth it). Went with Ponzilla sauce, which was awesome and decent heat.

they had drinks, but there is also an ABC store next door if you want something different.
