13107,2015-03-27,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"One of the better Thai places out here in Las Vegas. The food was fresh, hot and greatly flavorful. Their curries and noodle dishes are delicious. And they make a really good Pad Thai.
If you are vegan, they can proudly substitute any chicken/beef broths with a vegetable base in their soup/noodle dishes as well as tofu. My favorite dish to order is the Tom Kha Gai. Although not the greatest I've had here, it was not as favorable as some other Thai places. They forgot the Keffir leaves and lime! Overall, I will definitely pay a visit again! Their Panang curry was amazing!",8nAchwrSfEKafmFnAehCGg,0,0,4,rmiKw6dTbgLrbCrbK7YWuw
30802,2009-07-15,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"Since, I live very, very close to the strip, it's not always that easy to get food delivered to you.   We found Ping Pong on Google Maps, and decided to order from there one night.  We've since then ordered there for delivery numerous times.  Usually takes about 45 to get to us, but the food's always hot when we get it and delicious.  
Ask for the Pad Kee Mao, with chicken, it's not on the menu but it's pretty good.  Aka Drunken Noodles, though, the Drunken noodles they have listed on their menu, is not drunken noodles.  It's made with more of a spaghetti type noodle, meh.   The Curry Noodles, are also pretty good too.  The Red Curry itself is good, as is the Panang.  We ordered Thai Fried Rice last time, and it was mighty good.  Just a simple fried rice (almost like chinese) with pork.  The best item on the menu though, the dish that makes my boyfriend erect with delight, is the Beef salad, Nom Tok, NOT the regular spicy beef salad, but specifically the Nom Tok.  It's just beef, cilandro, red onions and sometimes they throw some lettuce on the side, which we diligently toss to the side of the container.  The sauce is tasty, limey, spicy, and I love the ground rice powder, gives it a nice texture.  I also like their Pad Prik King too (just spicy sauce, like a chili sauce/almost chili oil) with Beef.  All it is, is green beans, beef and sauce.  All in all, it's not the best Thai I've had (Sripraphai in Woodside, NY) but, its decent, and not terribly overpriced.",ubOe7kfaEnikCGvh1R2oBQ,0,0,4,UhOOf7bgrHvlMDyuCyi2IQ

I have a friend who likes the food so much he drives from Summerlin once a week to meet for lunch at Ping Pong. Yes, sometimes it is so crowded you may have to wait for a table during lunch, and since they try and serve all the food hot, everyone at the tables food may come out at different times.

218315,2010-09-24,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"Attempt number two-- the yellow curry lunch special.

I ordered it mildly-spicy this time and while it was definitely easier to eat than the medium-spicy (I don't like to sweat or cry while eating my lunch) it still lacked a lot of flavor.  The curry here is also rather thin, the vegetable consisted of mostly half cooked onion, some carrot slices and even less potato along with mediocre deep-fried cubes of tofu. 

The curry isn't bad, but its not great (maybe I am a curry snob). The chopsticks they gave me were just gross. I took a picture but won't post it here.  For all I know, she could have given them to me by accident.  

I really really really want to like this place, but I am disappointed again.

As a 'seasoned' Vegas local that luvs spicy dishes, I know to emphasize spice when ordering. Unfortunately here in the valley, restaurants are too often afraid to scare away the midwestern-ish tourists with spiciness, so you nearly have to talk them into it. Now they know what I prefer & I rarely have to even ask.
The thai iced tea is good, and the chicken satay, curry-coconut mussels on rice noodles, kim-chee, garlic lobster, grilled salmon are all to friggin' die for.",l-3u90M46tO9bqE_Dt9kAQ,0,0,4,DhHzlBxPhkgFVA9apRiVFg
446429,2011-01-30,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"Service was fine, ambiance is nice and the lunch special pricing is good.  So why the 2?

Well.. I really like spicy food, but spice with FLAVOR.... not the kind of spice that just rips your tongue off and leaves you with no taste buds whatsoever.  And unfortunately when I ordered the Panang Curry at what I thought was a pretty conservative spice level of 2 out of 4 (yes, they only give you a 1-4 range... lame), they gave me the kind of spice I HATE.   I couldn't even enjoy it.  About halfway through I had lost any sense of taste and I had tears coming out of my eyes.  For a level 2?!

And the strange thing is, my brother ordered his dish (I believe it was the Pad See Ew) at a spice level 2 and his wasn't nearly as hot as mine.  So that leads me to believe they don't really know what they're doing in the kitchen, and by reading some of the other reviews I don't think this was an isolated incident.

So that was a bummer.  Maybe if I gave them a second chance I'd have a better experience, but I don't see myself rushing back any time soon.",9JSCHAgXnzQnna1a3crJOA,0,0,2,eBl6r8OVsHbUBmioQECQ_Q

My comments about the soup are short, taste is OK but totally not worth the 9.95, probably more like 5 dollar. When I got the check the price of the soup was 10.95 instead of the 9.95, first thinking it was just a honest mistake, I went up to the counter and pointed out the mistake by showing her the price on the lunch menu. Amazingly she said I was wrong because the computer tells her its 10.95 although the lunch menu clearly says it's 9.95. I don't want to be arguing about a dollar so long story short: They charged me a random price which is nowhere to be found on the menu.

943409,2011-10-24,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"My boyfriend and I love Thai food.  In fact, when I first moved out here, the first restaurant I looked for was a Thai place.  I had asked locals and one of them recommended this place.  The restaurant is in a quiet plaza, and all the times I've gone there was around 9:00PM and there would be maybe two or three parties already seated and a couple more would stroll in as I waited.  I always ordered my food to-go, so I don't know exactly how their in-restaurant service is, but as far as to-go orders, the service is fast!  The food is pretty good, I usually order Pad Thai and Red Curry with chicken and it's delicious.  The only complaint I have is that there are only four levels of spicy.  I've always experienced a spice level either on a 1-10 scale or a 1-12 scale...with only four levels, I feel like it's either going to be too spicy or too bland.  There's nothing in-between for those who aren't sure what level to get.  The first time I went, I got a level 2, and it was okay (but, I do have a high tolerance for spicy food).  The next time I went, I tried the three and it was waaaay spicer.  The spiciness between the levels 2 and 3 was an extremely drastic jump.  I love spicy food so I didn't really mind, but if you're unsure, I suggest getting a level 2.  My food usually came out within 10 minutes of ordering it, and the servers always ask if I want water while I wait for my food, which I don't experience often while ordering to-go, so it was a nice touch.  The prices are pretty decent considering it is a sit-in restaurant and the portion sizes they give you.  I've lived here for three months, and I've already lost count of how many times I've ordered from here.  I'm a loyal customer (:

My husband ordered the Rama Noodle dish with duck and was under the impression it would be similar to low mein noodles but they were spaghetti noodles. He must have read the menu wrong, but either way, he enjoyed it. Our friend ordered Red Curry, spice level 3 and said the spice level was accurate.

We will definitely be going back to try other dishes. It was a low-key night but we were happy we picked it!",74sdrfg2SFhH3kAslZjjrg,0,1,4,hFFS_wr98En7M_5KzQrqQA

1661585,2011-06-03,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"Ok...so I can't hate on the place because it's the closest, more affordable Thai restaurants when I used to live in this area. BUT there's something missing about this place that I quite can't put my finger on...maybe it's missing the love in it's dishes...I'm not sure.

Anyway, here's my reason for the 3/5 stars overall. Whenever I dine in, service is inconsistent. Sometimes they'll be on point, other times I'll have to flag them for attention. And no, I'm not a needy guest so I don't see my comment as some cry for attention; I'm just sayin' that feeling neglected can suck! Plus, I get somewhat frustrated when the place isn't THAT busy and I don't get no love. 

As for the food. I've had almost all their curries. I don't think nor do I remember them offering any green curry, but that's not a biggie for me because I don't tend to order green curry anyway. I think all their curries are delicious; I am especially fond of their panang. All their curries have a great portion of the meats and veggies. (I typically ordered chicken or tofu in my curries and are both cooked well into the curry). In terms of flavor, their chicken satay isn't anything extraordinary but I believe their portions might be slightly bigger than most Thai food places. The Tom Kah soup is excellent; great balance of the coconut and citrus, broth and meat. Lastly, their noodle dishes. I'm not particularly a fan. They come out inconsistent--sometimes it will have the great balance of the flavor/sauce on the dish other times it's dry or overly saturated with sauce. 

I wouldn't mind coming back here again for a standard Thai cuisine and service. Not too shabby for the area.",j0vDYYFE2eNvjm5NXHFmbA,2,1,3,Cs-ypsj4L3p9cN5rDdUp3w

Interior looks like I was in Thai restaurant in a small town.

Pad Thai, the noodle was too sweet to us so we had to exchange others.

They do not want to change the flavor of the noodle because they do not want to lose their conventional taste.  Anyway, if you don't like sweet flavor, stay away from pad thai.

Crab meat fried rice is the number one we love  and this place provides one as good as it gets. 

The soup, Ttomyangkkung, was good but a little sweet. We love a little sour taste.

Dessert are really good and you can try anything on the menu. 

We will try this place again for lunch soon.

That being said - I wasn't impressed by the service at all. I understand when a restaurant is busy that I might not get the best service ever, but when the restaurant is completely empty - service should be pretty good. 

Being a party of eight, we didn't all arrive at the same time. When I got there, three of my friends were already seated and had their drinks. I sat down, and it was another 5 minutes until two more showed up. And another 5 minutes after that when the last person showed. About 10 minutes after that, we were all ready to order - and it was at that moment that I finally saw an employee for the first time. Really?! Twenty minutes of sitting there - and I had yet to see an employee? That's ridiculous. 

Food wise - it was decent. I've definitely had better Thai food in Vegas, but this wasn't the worst place I'd been to. I ordered the Pad Kee Mao which had good flavor and the spiciness [level 2] was just right. However, it was way too oily. I tried some of my friends Pad Thai - which was alright. Sweeter than most of the other ones I tried. I also had the pleasure of trying the Crab Fried Rice - which was definitely the best entree of the night. 

One other thing I'll say - is that they do not seem to be consistent with the way they spice everything. Four of us ordered our meals at level 2. And all four of our meals were definitely not the same level of spiciness. One friend ordered a level one, and his dish seemed to be spicier than all the level twos. 

All in all - probably wouldn't eat dinner here again. I'd maybe go back to try one of their lunch specials - but that's only if I'm really craving Thai food when I'm on that side of town.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,2,0,2,mymNz4x37OH7gPMC6wI_Qw

Ping Pong Thai is a great little place.  Their lunch specials are fair, delicious, and a fun place to retreat too when the craving for Thai strikes.

With that being said, I did try the ""Fresh Thai Spring Roll"" the other day and was less then impressed.  Maybe it was my fault for not realizing that it wasn't exactly the ""fresh spring roll"" that I am accustomed to, but the menu descriptors are almost word for word, so, i figured why not.

They were plain old nasty.  I tried so hard to enjoy them, or at least finish them, but I just didn't have enough sauce to mask the soggy and sad rolls burdens.  The fish they used in it was kind of brown and stinky, and they way they cut the rolls (thirds) cause each roll to explode upon first bite.

I am fairly confident everything else on the menu is pretty stellar, so I hope this review serves its purpose and gives you the confidence to try out this wonderful establishment, and the knowledge to just stay away from the Fresh Thai Spring Roll.

When we walked in we were immediately greeted and seated. It was 7pm on a Saturday night, guess business was slow. The first thing we noticed was that the restaurant was super dark and it was full of non-Asian people (i mean it is in Henderson, idk what I expected).
Menu was short and concise. The lady brought our waters and took our orders less than 1 min after bringing the menu. Talk about prompt!
We ordered the red curry level 1 and duck curry-level 2.
Their spice levels are rated 1-4. (TIP: food here is spicy- even a level 1 was spicy for a whimp like me) 
1) Duck curry was bomb!!- mixture of green and red peppers, Thai basil, pineapple and tender large chunks of duck with skin on. It was absolutely delicious! A must order!
2) red curry with extra bamboo shoots (1$ extra) and tofu 
3) portion sizes were huge!!!- 1 entree is def enough for 2 people
4) prices are comparable- $10-11 for red curry and $14-15 for the duck curry 
5)service was super quick and very friendly
6) at the end with ur check u get an assortment of hard candies

The service was super quick (less than 10min from Order to getting the food).
Also the curry was super flavorful and beyond delicious.
I just wish this place was closer to my house. But if I'm around n craving Thai I'll be back!!",kwS_MjOUs1Jd_4X7B5t2yQ,4,2,5,i5-SYfOXwL9Y8rceH9MVjw

That being said my Southwest tour of *******(removed for legal reasons)****has taken my down a long and winding path. So, I am getting ready to see the ****** again and before it was time to go to ***** my ****** said that we need to eat before the **** bargain was going to be announced.

I agreed under few conditions...it had to be Thai food and it had to be Thai food on a nice sounding street...AND the restaurant had to have a really stupid name.

...here comes Ping Pong on East Sunset.  Ping Pong...I did a lot of that while ****** in that horrible ****** and and dreamed about it when i spent 8 months in the hole.  Okay, I can do this. Let's go.  So we went in and I have to say, and it isn't because i have spent most of my life in ****** facilities...but the girls who work as waitresses are all very nice looking. Good beginning.

One of these sweet young things sits us down at a table, gives us menus and tells us she will be right back.  I think she will make a great wife number 7.  The lunch menu was complete with all of the standard favorites: pad thai, yellow curry, hot and sour soup, etc. With the pad thai, yellow curry and other dishes you can chose your own meat.

After ordering we get a complementary bowl of soup, which was very good. Great coconut milk flavor.  

A few minutes later the food came. Very good portion size, and the quality of the food wasn't exceptional but it was good.  For example, I picked the chicken as my meat with the yellow curry and I found two pieces of gristle that should have been cut away before cooking.

Another complaint is that I was asked how hot I wanted it, and I like my food spicy so I told her that. Not only was it not that spicy, but all they did was added red pepper flakes as far as I could tell. The broth of the curry was not spicy unless I directly ate a red pepper flake. So it appears to me they do what most places who serve the Anglo's do...they make it mild and they use a cheap way to make it hotter. I am Rex Marvin...I can TELL when you do that.

Which is a shame that their prep work was sloppy and their food made too pedestrian for the masses. The other techniques they used were great. The vegetables were cleaned and cut well, they had been properly marinated in the stews and soup, and they took on a great flavor. The hot chicks in great outfits were nice. The portions were good. The price was right.

Unfortunately this is the case of exotic cuisine being Americanized to a point of losing what makes it really special.

I tried explaining that to the chef, but I am not sure he could understand me with all the screaming and my **** pulling at me and sobbing about all his hard work down the drain. I like to think the chef understood...but all I saw was fear...all I heard was madness. Hope he was able to wash those friggin red pepper flakes out of his eyes by now.

From now on if I want Thai's I am either going to this great hooker I know who also does this bead trick that is out of this world...or maybe Archi's. Sure, I had to alley whip some punk last time i was there, and I am banned, but who is going to stop me?

I called and the lady said we would have to spend $50+ to get food delivered all the way to Mandalay Bay. Well we had 5 girls so it was perfect, we were bound to spend more than that. Anyway, the delivery guy came less than an hour straight to our hotel room! We got 4 chicken pad Thais and a crab fried rice. They were a pretty big size that could last each of us two different meals.

The only reason why I gave 4 out of 5 is because I've had better Pad Thai. Maybe it's because I usually have it fresh in a restaurant? I don't know but it was still good! I will definitely order from them again when I am in town and feeling lazy to go out to a restaurant.

3438259,2012-11-20,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"We were at a nearby coffee shop and needed to grab some lunch so I opted to pick something up from here. I think it's rather pleasant inside-- wood interior with lots of pretty decorations. The employees are friendly as well and of course that's a plus.

I ordered from the takeout menu and went with a beef and broccoli and the chicken pad thai. Yes I know beef and broccoli is not an authentic thai dish but that's what my girlfriend wanted so just shut it everyone. The food was ready fairly quickly and I peaced out.

The serving sizes are respectable. Better than some of the other small Thai places in town that I've reviewed. The quality was respectable as well. the beef was not too chewy and dry and the broccolis did not appear old or wilted. They served plenty of sticky rice with it as well. I was a bit dissappointed that we couldn't get soup to go but I guess that's policy. The salads were unremarkable-- typical iceberg contraptions with a bit of thai dressing.

I certainly enjoyed the pad thai. Plenty of nut crumbs and a decent amount of meat. It had the right amount of sweetness without being overpowering, and I was very full after finishing it. One complaint I do have is that it was a bit heavy-- I think they could stand to use a bit less cooking oil but hey I'm not the cook so what do I know.

Verdict: 3.5 stars. I think this place offers an excellent value for casual thai-- the sort of place you might go to for lunch if you are on your break or in the middle of a study run at a starbucks or something. They don't skimp on portions which makes them worthy of your business. I WILL be back here because they are so conveniently located next to Sunrise Coffee and I love thai. That being said, I just can't award them with a 4 star review because the competition for Thai out here is just so fierce. They don't do enough to stand out or really earn my business on a more serious level such as for a romantic dinner.",U4ERp63gvcIeOis8UdtxvA,0,0,3,GUIm0iAJY8nveCQadvgdrA

After I finished eating everything and part of this is due to the fact that I ate so fast but also I blame the food. My stomach hurt and my mouth felt like it had been coated with a film from the peanut sauce. We ordered the Chicken Satay, Papaya Salad, Pad Thai, and a dish called the Swimming Rama.  The chicken satay was okay, not bad not great.  It wasn't dry but it was slightly bland.  The papaya salad was very disappointing.   First off it came with 1/4 of green cabbage taking up half the box.  I ordered papaya salad not papaya salad and green raw cabbage! Second the salad arrived soggy.  Maybe it was because I didn't have it in the restaurant and it was delivery but it was not crunchy and fresh tasting like it should be.  Last thing about the Papaya salad and this could just be me but I personally like it when the peanuts are ground and put on top so I can mix them in and not whole and just thrown on top. (Even in the description of the salad it say's ""ground peanuts"".) Next up is the Pad Thai.  This is not even close to the ""the best Pad Thai"" I have ever had.  Like I had read in reviews.  Lastly the Swimming Rama, this dish is mixed steam vegetables ""swimming"" in peanut sauce.  I loved all the steamed vegetables.  Not a big fan of their peanut sauce and its pretty hard to mess up steamed vegetables.  Overall I think this place was good not great.

Service has always been fast and friendly at this family run Thai restaurant and the food has been served hot and fresh.  The spiciness scale here is 1-4, and I find that a 3 is hot enough for me.  I've tried a bunch of the lunch specials, but always come back to the my go-to's, which are Pad Thai, Basil Chicken, and Pad Kee Maw.

The lunch special comes with the soup of the day or salad and non-noodle dishes are accompanied by steamed rice.  You can substitute fried or brown rice for $1.00.  Coke products are $2.50.

Not surprisingly, I ordered the $6.95 Basil Chicken lunch special on my last visit, with steamed rice.  It was delicious, per usual.  The veggies were crunchy, the chicken spicy and flavorful, and the rice helped cool down the spice when I needed it.

My friend ordered the $6.95 Chicken Chow Mein lunch special and enjoyed it thoroughly.  She said she would definitely get it again.

I have been around the Las Vegas Thai restaurant block so I must say that this place is good enough to eat; but only for a quick lunch on your work lunch break.  This is not a restaurant to go brag about to your friends and make reservations for an awesome Thai food experience.

1 star = quick and courteous service 

2 stars = for the free soup they provide at the beginning of your meal after you take your order; it's actually a different kind on different days and so far the two I' ve tasted have been yummy (hot and sour, vegetable/pork)

3 stars and no more than that = for the food.  The food is good and tasy, but the the textures are not what I am used to.  I ordered the Panangy Curry beef, and my boyfriend ordered the Curry Soup w/ noodles and beef.  He was extremely displeased because his soup came w/ spaghetti noodles and not your regular asian egg noodle or chow fun noodle he was expecting.  He felt as if he were eating an american thai fusion curry soup.  It was tasty enough to finish, but he would not order it again.  He also was not fulfilled w/ the amount of food he ate and started eating off my plate.  He commented that my food was not very good either because of the soupy texture of my Panangy Curry.  This is the texture I'm talking about; I'm used to thick curry from other Thai restaurants.  It was still tasty to boot, and I liked that the entree had lots of vegetables and lots of meat in it's portion.  

This place is convenient to go for business lunch, but not an enjoyable weekend lunch or dinner.  Quality is only 3 stars.",ksYpOznbD-22wYpTiacHwA,0,0,3,6-CZQASW5-dsWUHk3F7qXg
4054955,2014-08-06,4,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"Here's my review of Ping Pong Thai.  

3 Stars for Service:
We were seated right away and the restaurant was clean.  My issue is the lack of service that we received once we placed our order and got our food.  My advice...order an extra glass of water or maybe two extra.  Once you get your food, you'll never hear from them again until your bill arrives.  

3 Stars for the Ambiance:
This place is small and since there are a lot of people that dine here for lunch, you also feel cramped.  It's loud and a decent conversation with friends while you're eating shouldn't be expected.  Come to think of it, I think it's my friends that were the loud ones.  Regardless, don't expect any QT with your party if you eat here. 

3 Stars for the Food:  I got their Beef/Broccoli w/Brown Rice and a side of their Satay Chicken. The beef and broccoli was a bit salty with the highlight being the broccoli.  As for the Satay chicken, this is not something that I would order again.  Lacked taste and the portions were small.   

4 Stars for Price: They got this part right.  Lunch for 3 costs about $30, which is a great price.  Portions, except their Satay Chicken, are huge.  

My friends are fans because they work in the area.  That also probably means that I will be back.  However, I'm not a fan.  The service and food is just A-Ok.  Note to self...stay away from their Satay Chicken.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,6,6,3,se069aWaa1XfR7mT3gpzeQ

Price there is pretty reasonable for lunch menu (around $7). Most of the dishes was between $5-7. Their thai tea was pretty sweet to me so I had to add extra water to water it down. Tom Yum Goong was good although doesn't seem like the same ingredients used at other thai restaurants.

I opt for the level 4 (spiciest) and it's pretty spicy but I have had spicier at other thai places. 
The lunch special comes with your choice of salad or soup, the soup is always the same and I feel like they water it down to keep it going thru the week.

The duck wraps and the spring rolls are great starters. Both are delicious. I've had Pad Thai with Chicken on both visits and here that isn't a boring choice. The Pad Thai is really good.

It is a quite place tucked away right next to Sunset Park, if you are not paying attention you may miss it.  Inside the atmosphere is amazing.  For a Thai place playing soft rock and roll, very cool.  The decor is very nice and welcoming.  

The staff is friendly, helpful and very attentive to your needs.  We got there about 6:30pm and there was only one booth that was occupied.  They have several booths and tables as well as delivery and people who call in and come pick the food up.

We started with the Thai Spring Rolls and they were AMAZING!!!!  We then had the Pad Thai, the Cashew Chicken and the Green Curry which was all EXCELLENT. 

We love Thai food and have tried several places in town and this one was way above the rest.  From the service, the ambiance, the size of the place and the FOOD.

Did I mention the food was AMAZING.  We really liked this place and I encourage you to give this place a try and share your experience.",kzRq4H_nSf4b3F_sdymWSw,7,7,5,Bh5Zy-lmY8j0fgIkqYecLw

Chum: Hey, I'm arriving here at one, dinner? drinks? both?
Me: Both

7 pm
Chum: Where the hell are you?
Me: Downtown
Chum: Meet us at Ping Pong on Sunset

Didn't get a chance to Yelp it, but Chum and his pals liked it so I met up with them.  The place was empty except for a couple.  It was strange...they sat us in the booth right next to them.  Trixie and Antonio come here often and love it.  They also commented that every time they are here, the place is empty.  I asked what about lunch, and they said it's the same.  So a red flag went up and I now wondered if it was any good.  But then again, Chum has dated an assortment of Asian girls so maybe he had better take on this place than I gave him credit for even if he's a vegetarian.

I ordered my standard Panang curry with chicken.  Here is where it was a little strange.  This was the first time, I've ordered Thai food with people who didn't opt to share everything.  So I couldn't try Trixie's Pad Thai, although I'm sure she would have if I asked, but I had just met them, so I felt kinda weird.  My dish was very good with just the right amount of heat...I ordered it spicy #2.  I also ordered a Singha beer as well.  Price wasn't so bad...$53 for the four of us.  The portions were generous too.

Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience.  We thought that maybe this was a cover for some money laundering thing.  And what's up with the name?  Is ping pong even Thai in origin?  The staff was very nice.  I thought it was funny that the rice took a while to come out.  So I'm not sure if my review is accurate based on one dish.  But it is my favorite and it was very tasty.  

I would definitely come back and try more the next time I'm in the area.  I'm in an internet cafe because the wifi is whack at my hotel.",rAAT39HF4khu-OdxBSr0jg,9,9,4,82sbe_lQmCXk_EJ-6cyM-g

In my neverending quest to keep trying new places, I finally decided to give them a go. To my delight, they have Panang Curry as one of their lunch specials. That's pretty much my go-to curry choice. I went with the basic choice of chicken, but you can also get veggie, tofu, beef, pork, or upgrade to shrimp or even salmon.

The curry tasted good. I'm realizing that I'm not that picky in general. My currrent favorite Panang is Archi's, so I have to compare to that. I give the edge to Archi's for overall flavor. Both feature string beans, but Archi's Panang has a slightly better cut and texure to the string bean. Sounds silly, but I really like what string beans bring to the mix.

I'm in between three and four stars. I'll leave it at a strong three. I'm definitely adding Ping Pong to my lunch destination rotation.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,5,3,3,cacajwYVA31KFM5CV5TL8w

We order 3 of 4 on the spice scale (the highest number usually signifies ""Thai Spice"" which is too spicy for most) but it wasn't spicy enough.  Several times before, 3 of 4 was pretty hot/spicy.  I didn't ding them for that this time but ping pong Thai...I think you guys need to standardize your spice scale.  Maybe create one so all the cooks know and goes by the same standards rather than their own opinion of what 3 of 4 spicy should be.  This way, when local people like me comes to visit, we could expect our food to taste the same or relatively the same each time.

My favorite dish here is the panang curry. They don't really make the food that spicy, so I order a ""4"" on their spice scale (1-4) for a more authentic taste. Served with your choice of brown or white rice.

The pad thai, another popular dish, is also good and comes in a good sized portion, I usually take leftovers home. I get everything with vegetables or tofu so I can't comment on how good the meat is here.

When we got in there was a huge dinner party of maybe 25-30 people. And other customers around. There were also 3 officers, I'm thinking having their lunch. We were escorted to the back near the restrooms, which I didn't mind but it was annoying to see that huge party of people go almost like every 5 minutes.... So when it came to waiting to order that was a 15 minute wait. Mind you me and my mom are Thai, so when they came to get our order we had a few questions as to how they cook things and flavor their food. Some regions in Thailand have different levels of spice. It seemed like the waitress was in a rush and kind of rushed our order and kept looking around not answering our questions. We ordered the Yen Ta Fo, beef noodle soup, papaya salad, and seafood tom yum. We asked to not have the food sweetened too much and if they used MSG to not use too much for us. She didn't answer us as to whether to use it or not. Well we ordered our drinks Thai tea and Thai iced coffee. It took about 15 minutes for our drinks to arrive and another 10 minutes for our tom yum to get there. All the while no one came to check on us in between. Or asked if we wanted water to drink. They went to the officers that were having lunch at least 5 times asking them if they were ok, if they wanted water, so on and so forth within the 15 minutes we waited for our drinks. I feel like customers should all be treated equally. because another party has badges and uniforms on they are treated as top priority, that to me isn't good customer service. That's just my opinion. Overall food was okay, I think the food was a little sweet to my liking and I think they might have used MSG.. I'm not too sure.

Also the duck curry was just as good.


The spring rolls are ok I didn't practical like it.

Tips this place give out deals on Groupon take them! 12 dollars for 20 is a steal so saving money is good thing while trying to budget your month bills and want to eat out this is great for you

I got there at 12:55 to meet my boyfriend for lunch. I knew what he wanted chicken Pad Sei ew 6.95 and Thai Iced tea 2.75 and i got shrimp pad thai 8.95. I ordered both dishes at 3 out of 4 spicyness which wasn't too spicy. I was thinking i should have ordered a 4/4. Both of the lunch specials came with a chicken cabbage soup which was really tasty! YUM!
The food came out minutes after i ordered it which was surprising, but then the other tables had already been served. My boyfriend didnt arrive until 1:20 so before he arrived i asked the friendly waitress if they could warm it up because i didnt realize he was going to be late and the food would come out so quickly.
I would defiantly come back again and my BF said he would come for lunch again.",1PHVlRRHZmGTQQt4_zEBAA,4,3,4,JRt3-IhW3AyGbNjhYFZgUQ

They not only serve very small portions is sort of expected at Thai restaurants however their food was exceedingly small. Moreover, try not to use a Groupon there because they will not only charge you the regular price but add restrictions. I bought a $40 Groupon there and was told that I needed to order an additional $30 in food... which I did. When I thought I would get out of there for around $50 it turned out to be nearly $80. Remember, the rules changed when I got in the door so BEWARE! Personally-speaking, I will not return there and I feel it was a BAIT and SWITCH. Again...

They tell me to sit anywhere and a second after I sit down I pick up a menu and the second after I do that a waitress who doesn't say Hello is aking me what I want. I explain that I literally just sat down, that I need a minute. She looks annoyed and says,  K. but we close soon. I said, I thought you closed at 10. And she said, Soon, please hurry. Then I have to flag her down, and I ask her a question, dismissive again. And then I order something and she marches off. No nothing. While I'm waiting the other tables leave and it's just me and they literally start cleaning around my feet and getting mops out, making me lose my appetite. No one seems to even see me. Finally, my dish is set down, and besides the fact that the waitress set it down and marched off in silence, the food was really pretty good. Thai basil with sliced beef is what I got. Anyway, the waitress didn't come back. I finished my water. Needed more. Needed to pay. Finally I flag her down and pay. My total was 12 bucks or so, and I wanted to leave no tip but I left $1. 

How horribly rude. To close at 10 and have a customer come in at 9:28 and feel rushed and cleaned around and ignored.",1QhKb0k-9oFUkiQj1x1wxQ,0,0,1,hNMTduPE6Xet02ZCNrut-w

We entered to a very welcoming restaurant that was very tastefully decorated. We were surprisingly impressed. The waitresses are also the hostess and they welcomed us as we entered. Once seated our waitress quickly returned to take our drink order and order if we were ready. They came by often to refresh drinks and they worked together to make sure customers were happy. Again we were surprisingly impressed. 

Now the food. We started with the spring rolls. They were veggie and not the best but good. I prefer meat ones but wanted to try something new. Our entrees were Swimming Rama with chicken and a side of fried rice it was very well seasoned with just the right amount of spice. Now the Crab Fried Rice is a must try!! They do not scrimp on the crab and they use a sticky rice that makes it all come together. We might ask for a lil more green onion since it just hit the spot i this meal.

Oh and I love that they add lime to the water!! If you haven't tried its so much tastier than lemon. 

Overall we were happy we came and we will be back. It's a great place to try for locals.",-go-R_jzvYLYngQbfKN4_A,1,1,4,Vngx55L2W37BlNwi4ZZfTA

5653444,2010-04-09,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"My family and I decided to come here while in Vegas and in desperate need of some lunch grubbin' after church. We were happy to see that there was a Thai restaurant; I've never actually had Thai food in Vegas before, really.

Anyways, the place is pretty spacious and the decorations are pretty nice. There weren't many people in the restaurant while we were there, but we noticed there were only about 2 waitresses doing EVERYTHING.

So we order the food: I get Pad See Ew, my sister gets Pad Thai, and my other sister gets this veggie curry with peanut sauce.

Everyone was served a salad and soup before their main dishes arrived, but the salads and soups here are a joke. Such a small portion!! I mean, I finished it in one bite (literally)!

The Pad See Ew was pretty good, but also really oily. I don't think it was the best I've had, but the flavors seemed to be really good just because there was so much oil! Granted, I was hungry, so I ate everything. The Pad Thai was also pretty good. I didn't have many complaints with it, although I really disliked the curry that my other sister got. It came with a really whack peanut sauce, that seemed to solidify or something. I don't remember what it was called, but it was just not good. Ick.

In terms of service, it was slow -- obviously because there were two waitresses serving everyone in a huge restaurant (which was an odd concept to me). There weren't even a lot of people, but the waitresses still took a long time to give us water, food, tea, and.. everything. They really need to hire more people during busier hours. Or were they not expecting a bigger turnout?

Anyways, the food's pretty good. I wouldn't mind coming here again, really, but they just need to amp up the service.",RPgHIlmwH0F-mlg6Ny42og,0,0,3,3UT-njmn-RlITyGrYLpOkQ
5658113,2017-01-10,0,9qcTpWYxrZrN13p1zAP6dA,"I like Ping Pong Thai. Seriously. As someone who frequents Thai places, this is one of the best that isn't downtown, on the strip, or overpriced. 

Lets cut to the chase - this place is in a strip mall on Sunset. It's unassuming. And you will drive right past it if you aren't paying attention. The place is clean and the staff are friendly and attentive - as long as you aren't there during their personal lunch breaks (come on now - everyone needs a break).

I have personally ordered the Thai Basil Chicken, Tom Kha Gai soup, Beef Jerky, Panang Curry Chicken, and Pad Thai. I absolutely LOVE the Thai Basil and Tom Kha Gai soup. The ingredients are fresh and the dishes are spicy (if that is how you like them). Be sure to check their spice levels! I have had one server state the levels were from 1-10, and another stated 0-5. One tip: They do not skimp on the spices, so if you do not like spicy, stick with a 0-1!

Because this place is a local's favorite, I would suggest a late lunch or early dinner (think between 2:30 - 5:30) to beat the rush. Sometimes the place is empty, and sometimes it is standing room only!
