Tonigjt however was a horrible surprise. It started off alright, ordered two seperate orders no problem. The issues started when it came time for us to receive our food. The woman manning the drive thru window (Olga) seemed to be in a rush to get us out of her sight. I understand that its the graveyard shift but customer service should still be applicable even during the late shift. Second issue was that our order was missing a few things that we payed extra for (garlic dipping sauce and extra ranch) and it was made worse that she seemed mad that we were asking for the sauce that we paid for. Same thing happened with my friend's shake, he got the wrong shake and she again seemed mad we cared enough to ask for the proper flavor. All this would be bad enough but yhe worst was when we got home. We had ordered a large number four and a medium number one. Our friends shake was also supposed to be large sized along with his fries. We noticed that the fries were all small sized and the shake was also a small. Checkers is fast food but it's not cheap like mcdonalds. If you are going to charge the prices you do, make sure your staff is competent and actually cares about the restaurant's reputation enough to actually try during his or her shift.

As soon as we got the food I asked if we got the right size fries. The large compares to a small at any other place, and the medium is TINY.  They were also awful. It tasted like the oil in the fryer hadn't been changed. The burger was drowned in roadhouse sauce. And the bacon?  I don't know what was up with that bacon. It was plastic.

I'm mindblown, closest to indoors I have ever seen was one with glass on long island so you didn't freeze your butt off in the winter.

The tables are spotless, the soda machine is clean, bathrooms included. I was beyond impressed. Anyways I ordered a bacon roadhouse (free coupon, hella yeah) with 2 apple pies for a dollar. First off, screw mcds apple pies, these PG quote myself ""poop"" on the mcds pies. Hot, steamy and filled with a crispy but light texture to them, always a good call plus is 2 for 1.

I'm not sure how big the chain Checker's is, but I know there are several around town. I went in with the boyfriend on a Thursday. He ordered a bacon cheeseburger, & I ordered a chicken sandwich with chili cheese fries. We both also had drinks, and our total was $16. That's pretty steep for fast food. Anywho, the menu board shows actual burgers, what we got was sandwiches with wonder bread. $6 for a piece of Wonder Bread, one piece of bacon, and a patty.... How does that add up? Maybe if the food was tasty I can overlook the Wonder Bread and the  steep prices, but this is nothing better the way I can make at home. Actually my burgers and sandwiches taste a lot better.

Coming home from my parents house around midnight and my fiancé was having pregnant cravings and while passing by the checkers told her the food was pretty good. Which in tun sparked up a craving for her, which led me to take a u-turn to get her food. We went through the drive thru and as soon as the lady at the speaker started talking we could immediately sense an attitude problem. Our order was taken very rushed and made as feel like we shouldn't be there, that our business was unwanted. 

We rolled up to the window and this woman with a mean-streak, looking like a cross between an imp and a lame dog chewing gum told us it was 8.55 with the most stern face, no customer service what so ever. After we handed her our cash she then said in the most obnoxious manner, "" can you do me a favor *chomp chomp* can you back up your vehicle?"" And stared at us like hurry up a**hole. So, confused I looked at my girl and was like wteff and reversed. Then as soon as we reached halfway from the window and the order speaker. She closed the window and we didn't make contact for another 20 min. 

At this point we were left wondering if this dog/imp was adding special sauce to our food. When the food was ready all we saw was a bag hanging out the window from the hairiest arm, so I pulled up and asked why did I need to reverse and this girl with the most putrid attitude replied, "" it's because we don't want you to wait long for fresh food."" And with a bat in the cave she struck up her chin didn't look at us twice and slammed the window. Again we were struck with a wteff?!?!?! moment.

As we drove away I had the urge to call the store to speak to the manager, because she ain't giving my fiancé and baby girl special sauce, and lo and behold the same voice answers. I asked for a manager and I was promptly answered between a squeak and a bark that she was the manager, "" ...an the names Elizabeth, ya see!"" I then asked if that was SOP for patrons/ness to reverse their vehicle from the window. And again I was reminded that it was for the reason that they don't want us waiting at the window long for fresh food. When I asked for her name again she said her name was Alyssa. I then said thank you and hung up. On the way home I was astounded by the rude service and the secret-agent man names, on my receipt the name on there is Amy, and vowed never to return to this sh*t hole ever again. I would sooner go on an epic adventure with frodo to mordor than come back to this horrible restaurant. 

I was inspired by her actions to call their corporate office, call again at their store to speak to another manager, and write this scathing review. I have never done that before now, but I've also never been treated like this before. All joking aside all the above accounts remain true up to the hairy arm and the booger in the cave.",u8FRdMI5btCDuh7GL41Gmg,1,1,1,HIPYm1cCiZCPJJlcqwmQFg

I've been passing by this Checker's for months waiting for it to be built so I could try it out.  I know we have one out there around Boulder Highway but I never seem to get out to that part of town often.  

Going to these fast food joints for a first time, I generally like to try the basics on the menu.  Chances are if you can handle the basics effectively, the rest of your menu should be OK.  With Checker's I was just passing through, so all I ordered was two All-American Cheeseburgers from their value menu for $1 each.  

It is their grand opening, and this Checker's was pretty packed.  There were folks filling the dining room and the drive thru was full.  There was noise everywhere behind the counter, fries being dropped, orders being mistaken.  Very likely for workers still trying to get the menu items down since it's all new, so I had no issues with errors this time around.  They just need some time to settle in.

My order was quick and easy to make, so I was in and out of Checker's in no time.  Service was friendly and quick, and the counter layout is very similar to those of other fast food joints like McDonald's, Burger King, and Carl's Jr.

What is the most different on Checker's menu and what makes them stand out is their wing menu.  Yep, orders of chicken wings!  I can see why the place is popular and has a bit of a cult status around these parts of town.  You can get a burger, and some wings all at the same place.  No other fast food giant can offer this currently with lots of success.  Not just plain ol' wings either, Checker's 'Crazy Good Wings' have flavor options:

-Buffalo
-Honey BBQ
-Asian Kick (hiya!)
-Angry Buffalo
-Garlic Parmesan

The orders I did see go out of the kitchen looked pretty appetizing.  I may have to try an order the next time I'm around.  Tasty.

Checker's menu is a cross between McDonald's, Burger King, and Sonic's.  You can get your cheeseburgers, bacon cheeseburgers, chicken sandwiches, and fish sandwiches.  But you can also get grilled hot dogs, cheese sticks (which Checker's calls 'Monsterella Stix', and chili cheese fries.  Their fries aren't of the regular tater either, looks like they are seasoned somehow but they do look good.  Another plus, Coca-Cola products!  If you can serve me Coke then you have a star in my book.

Back to my plain All-American Cheeseburgers?  Pretty basic, but they were pretty good.  Actually better than a McDonald's cheeseburger in my opinion.  I like the sesame seed bun, burger (which I think is flame broiled), cheese, pickle, mustard, and ketchup.  It was very similar to the Burger King cheeseburger which I like very much.  Only thing I would change would maybe be more pickle, add some mayo.  It looks like I will probably be back to try something else.

Checker's...now with TWO locations in town!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,4,1,3,bWSKMmdcYDsVYJzosDbN9w

Just passed the food out the window and walks away.  How rude.  You really need to train these people better.

On to the food.  The burgers are dry and overcooked, but dripping with butter.  Not especially appetizing.  At least it was quick.  My first visit at any Checkers - I won't be back.",Gab1_sLsjJLAJojoFd-d-g,6,0,1,9S2StxgrAxSWN99vXLZpiA
4147587,2014-02-07,0,fl-K_oLD_I5J6h-gLL7FkQ,"This Checkers location is new to the area having only been open a few weeks at the time of this review.  It did not take me long to get there to give it a try though I did allow for the few weeks to pass giving the staff a chance to work out any glitches to their processs.  On my first of what will likely be many visits over the foreseeable future I went with my co-workers.  My boss ordered a BLT and the Baconzilla Fries.  The fries did not last long as she went hog wild on the cheesey bacon topped goodness.  The BLT, however, is still waiting for her.  Not because it is bad but because the fries were so good and so filling.  A different co-worker ordered the heart attack special with a side of all around good badness.  She got the Bacon Roadhouse Burger hold the BBQ sauce, a small order of seasoned fries and the Monsterella Cheese Sticks (fried mozarella).  It all looked great and she gave me the two thumbs up sign when I asked how she enjoyed it all.  That is a definitive win from her.  As for me, I ordered the double fish sandwich.  Think about a double Filet-O-Fish from McDonalds and add shredded lettuce.  It was about like that but by the time I got back to the office the fish had gone soggy and lost its crispy integrity.  I'll take McDonalds for the win on this one.  Besides, not much beats the bun McDonalds uses for their fish sandwich.  Anyhow, I also ordered the Fully Loaded Fries.  They are topped with melty cheese, ranch dressing and bacon bits (real bacon).  I ate about half before getting interrupted with work stuff so I set them aside and finished them the next day.  I liked the fries but they were very salty from being seasoned fries topped with cheese and bacon.  It was a little much but to at least have tried them I am happy.  Next time I go I may try either a chicken sandwich of some sort or perhaps one of the many burgers Checkers has to offer.  I would also try the cheese sticks.  They looked amazing and when dipped in marinara they must taste as good as they look.  I would also like to try some of the dessert options in the future.  They have some unique ice cream treats that sound incredible.  This food may not be good for the body but fast food rarely is.  This is food good for the mind.  You can't help but be happy at a place that serves up as much bacon as Checkers does.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,0,4,4JHKIhBM14SnLz40FnqehQ

Myself, 3 drunk friends, and a stone cold sober driver rolled up on a Friday night (Saturday morning) our order was simple: 5 Big Buford's. Once we quieted the fools in the back seat, the man taking our order informed us they are not accepting Credit cards at his time. I figured it was because they were close to closing, no big deal we managed to find enough cash for he burgers. Now then, what truly makes my blood boil is the car DIRECTLY behind us, taking an order mere seconds after us happened to be the rest of our drunk party, and magically the credit card machine worked!

I get to the drive thru and I told him he never asked me what sauce I would like for my wings, and he got upset as if I was supposed to settle for plain. I paid for 2 sauces for one of the items in my order & he only gave me one... Once I told him he said ""I'm sure I gave you two"" as if I was lying for a 40 cent sauce and I literally had to empty my bag to show him I only had one sauce! It was my first time ordering the wings and I asked if I could have a ranch with them. His response was ""they ain't free."" As I was checking my bag he stared at me the entire time making me uncomfortable so I just pulled off and once I got home I realized he never gave me my fries I was charged for. Again, it was my first time ordering the wings so I automatically assumed they were in the wing box. My receipt even says I was charged for them.

I had the Checkerburger combo and was pleasantly surprised to see that they had sweet tea on tap. Burger was actually quite good, like a bargain Double from In & Out. The soda machine *appears* to be dispensing too much water with its mixes but it's just a visual issue, flavor was on point.

I have to say my last two visits to this location has sucked spiky balls, not soft and warm ones! So after a night out of party time with the ladies we stopped through to grab a bite. We placed our order and wanted two apple pies which are boldly advertised on their menu and signs. 

The cashier tells us they have none ready, so we ask can they be made or is it just not an option? The cashier informs they could be made and would take ten minutes to make. Ok so we passed on it and drive up to the window to pay for our order.

We sit at the drive thru after paying for 15 minutes waiting on our order. We ordered four items so I would hate to know how long the wait would have been for a large order. I told my friend had I known it would have taken 15 minutes for our order anyways then I would have ordered the Apple pies for us.

No apology for our wait, the cashier literally shoves my friend our bag of food and shuts the window. We wait and ask for ketchup and I swear this troll rolled her eyes at us and hands us the ketchup packets.

This was our last visit as our previous visit was a crappy experience with shitty service as well. I did see the Undercover boss episode for this chain and am disappointed that this store fails so bad.
