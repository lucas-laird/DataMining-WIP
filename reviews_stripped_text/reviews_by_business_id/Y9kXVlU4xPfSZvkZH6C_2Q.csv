When he finally did he got my beer and my husband asked for the beer menu. I finished my beer and we gambled $40 before he came back. The place had no more than 10 people which was slow for a Saturday night at 9pm. When the bartender started unloading the dishwasher and still didn't get my husband his first drink we walked out.

1531227,2017-05-03,9,Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q,"I've been by a couple of times and have mixed feelings about NCT. The pizza is definitely their forte, but what brought me in to this location specifically was their specialty dinner menu. This menu was difficult to find, for starters, as their social media only vaguely allude to the ""seafood"" content but no menu or pricing is available on their website. I invited a large group of friends for a dinner, hopeful that our experience would live up to the hype.

Started with two specialty fry options: poutine and the aptly-named suicide fries. The former had virtually no salt or wow factor, with even the cheese coming in fairly flavorless. This would be my last spot to suggest for this dish. The suicide fries lived up to the name with a tangy habanero sauce that left a long burn, plus jalapenos and pepperoncini. 

Sampled the ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" specialty menu with Short Rib Stroganoff and Lobster Pot Pie. These were great quality and cool takes on classic dishes, but also suffered from a lack of seasoning. The egg noodles in the stroganoff seemed overcooked but at least the sauce wasn't heavy-handed with truffle. The short rib wasn't really the star of this dish though. The lobster pot pie fared better, with a richly flavored filling and a crisp topping of puff pastry. Can't say I'd get this again though. Later on, we ended our meal with the Strawberry Shortcake, which was fairly hard for ""angel food cake"" but light on the sweetness like I prefer my desserts.

But like I said, their pizza is the best bet. I came in before and had pizza logs while watching a game, and the ample cheese, layers of pepperoni, and crispy egg roll exterior were awesome. I've had the Guinea Pie at other locations and this one was comparable. Opted this visit for slices of the Naked City Pie (sans olives) and liked it better than I thought I would, but felt the corner slices had a low sauce-to-crust ratio, with toppings heavily applied only to the middle of the pie. Maybe that's just their style though, with the thick sheet-style crusts. I'm a fan of thick crusts and this one was good, I also found their red sauce to be particularly flavorful.

The main issue with my most recent visit was the service. For a Friday night, even without our group, I can't figure out why they'd only staff with 1.5 servers. The lady who most helped us was rarely around and frequently forgot items (silverware, water refills, share plates), while another lady tended mostly to a poker group in the back room. Our server seemed overwhelmed and not particularly attuned to the basic needs of diners. Might return for the next season's specialty menu, but my future pizza orders might be at the bar where service was on point.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,17,13,3,DoBTNdITgpLOmCpNZoRhMg
1546659,2016-11-09,1,Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q,"Found out about this place on Instagram and saw that a special pizza was being brought back for a one day special by pre-order only, The Kracken. I was intrigued by the black pizza dough and put in my order. The toppings included white garlic sauce, crispy calamari, peppadew, manila clams, garden greens,  purple basil, mozzarella, and pecorino all on a squid ink laced dough.

Upon first bite, I was hooked on the crispy calamari and wished that I had made a separate order. The peppadew provided a sweet heat that complimented well with the purple basil and cheeses. I wish there was more of the white garlic sauce as its flavor was masked by the toppings and did not come through. Unfortunately after two bites of each slice I was left with a large squid ink bread stick topped with mozzarella. Toppings were not generous in this case. 

Overall, this pizza was a good experience. But to pay $17.25 for this 12"" pizza just doesn't have me thrilled to come back for another. The calamari is a completely different story.  

Only 20 are available for pre-order and can be picked up on Thursday's. Keep an eye out on their social media accounts to know when they release The Kracken once more!",XB3jLxGXzD7euz3cGKdkMw,1,1,3,LhrXGc8kYeEZXsoU4JSabw

The food here is top notch just like the other Naked City locations. The Buffalo, NY style pizza is incredibly delicious and the chicken wings & fingers are some of the best in Vegas. There is a special chef's menu here that has some very impressive offerings. Pretty cutting edge stuff.  If you want a damn good pizza, maybe the best you've ever had, then you are in the right place. 
But this is a tavern and it's been a tavern long before Naked City took over so it really smells like smoke. But if you love pizza, especially this pizza, like we do, it won't stop you from enjoying a great meal here. Big place with lots of TV, a few games, a killer juke box system and friendly staff.

They have Loganberry on tap and if you don't know what it is, you can thank me later when you order it. It's a cross between grape juice and fruit punch. Very good with vodka.

If you're not familiar with this area, it's on the same street as Wayne Newton's home. Now I understand you're thinking ""What? 5 stars for a bar?"" Now I will tell you it is ALL about the food. Especially the pizza! This is definitely the best pizza in this area (in my opinion, all of Vegas) and I've tried a bunch since Mr.Kitty is obsessed with pizza in general. I mean sure it's great that you can get some beer and drinks and watch the game here too (Buffalo sports bar) but do not leave with out getting some food! They are also on uber eats as well which is super convenient especially if you have a game on at your house.

My top 3 pizzas! -
Guinea Pie $14.95 - $37.95
Grandma's meatballs, spinach, ricotta cheese, white garlic sauce and mozzarella cheese. This flavor was even been featured on Triple D! For $14.95 you can get a 1/4 sheet which is about the size of a medium pizza at Domino's but square. This is probably the best white sauce pizza I've had. You can tell they use quality ingredients and they use a thick layer of cheese and they don't skimp on toppings at all. The meatballs are also sliced more like how a sausage is sliced so you get more meatball per bite!

Back Home Pizza $13.50 - $35.95
Red sauce and mozzarella cheese mixed together, roasted garlic crust, cup n char pepperoni, in-house hot Italian sausage and Parmesan cheese. This one is for all of the people that love a regular pepperoni and cheese pizza but with a lot more flavor.

Chicken Finger Pizza $14.95 - $37.95
Chicken fingers tossed in hot sauce, blue cheese dressing and mozzarella cheese. So I didn't really know what to expect when we ordered this one but I can say this is probably my favorite pizza currently. Basically anyone that even just likes the flavor of wings and buffalo sauce will fall in love with this pizza. I don't even normally crave wings at all and only get them if I'm going to Buffalo Wild Wings but this pizza has started an addiction. I crave this one all the time now and anytime I smell wings at any restaurant I immediately think of this pizza first.

Poutine Fries $5.50 - $7.50
Fresh mozzarella cheese and in-house beef gravy. The gravy is super flavorful and a perfect option for the people that usually like to get carne asada fries while drinking.

The Little Piggy Got Some Eggs $9.95
Brioche bun, farm egg, Naked City bacon, maple-sage sausage, sharp cheddar and a crispy red potato cake. Best breakfast burger ever! The maple-sage sausage is so tasty and you can tell there was a lot of thought into each of the ingredients when you take a bite. Everything just fits together. 

Chilaquiles $9.95
Avocado crema and a sunny side egg. I'm sad to say that this is the ONLY item I didn't care for out of everything I've tried here. The avocado crema kind of had a chalky consistency and when I think of chilaquiles, I think lime, citrus, and some spiciness but I didn't get any of that with this version.

Foieco $17.95
In-house Red Corn Tortilla, Duck Confit, Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Charred Hierloom Cherry Tomato, Cilantro, Pickled onion, Uni Crema. This is the ultimate foodie taco. I will say I got more Duck Confit than Foie but I'm not complaining, everything tasted very complex and the Uni gave it a unique flavor.

This place is probably my go-to spot to get food after a night of drinking now especially since it's so close to home. Also, sorry Domino's you've been replaced on game days! :)",Gjv3ERasrRJqtEPa7ZMUSw,9,13,5,uHqYCm8h6bK8T6_kJdeMZQ

There's been a lot of hype around the dishes served here, so I as well others at my table were eager to try some of the items on their ""Enchantment Under the Sea"" menu along with some pizza. Sadly the service fell flat and some of the dishes seriously lacked seasoning which surprised us all. Our waitress, Krysten, didn't check on us much and all of our drinks sat empty for a majority of the meal. Flagging her down was a real chore and I can't figure out why such a popular place would have only 2 servers working on a Friday night?!

Suicide Fries ($5.50 for small portion) - Hot pepper blend, habanero garlic sauce and plenty of jalepenos piled on a bed of fries. This was featured on Food Network's DDD. The small portion was very generous and well worth the price. I honestly only sniffed the plate as it was being passed down the table for everyone to try lol and my nostrils started burning, so I just kept that plate moving along and am glad I did as those who tried it said they had a burning sensation in their mouths. I think a dollop of sour cream could be useful on the top of these fries to help with the burn.  

Poutine ($5.50 for small portion) - Fresh mozzarella and in-house beef gravy over a good amount of fries. I was really excited to try this dish and was quickly let down after the first bite. This dish was lacking in the seasoning department. The gravy and mozzarella were both bland. Fantastic portion for the price, but seriously needing better flavor. 

Braised Short Rib Stroganoff ($14.95) - Short rib, mushrooms, sour cream, beef jus, porcini and truffle powders over egg noodles. Yet another dish that was majorly lacking seasoning. When we were able to finally flag our server down to ask for some salt, that seemed to help the dish some. I expected the short rib to stand out more and just wasn't impressed with this dish like I had hoped. 

Naked City (1/4 sheet $14.95) - Pepperoni, hot Italian sausage, roasted sweet peppers, white onion, green olives on top of red sauce and mozzarella. Ours had everything except for olives per one persons request. The 1/4 sheet comes with 6 square slices and all of the toppings tasted so good together. My hubby really liked this one and we'd both order it again. 

The Guinea (1/4 sheet $14.95) - Grandma's meatballs, spinach, ricotta, white garlic sauce and mozzarella. This was featured on Food Network's DDD. This was one cheesy pizza and was well liked by everyone. By far my favorite of the night. I like the think crust and would for sure order this again.

I'd return for pizza and most likely order it to-go. They also have a brunch menu that I wouldn't mind checking out in the future with hopes that service can be better than it was this last time.",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,54,48,3,bxHex_fRobehefkMbOCQCA

One of our chef series meals was at Naked City Pizza on Paradise where Chef Palmeri served the group some of the dishes he was tinkering with to serve at the now open Naked City Tavern, a 24 hour gaming bar and restaurant just south of Sunset Road on Pecos.

Five of us gathered for brunch to try the new menu items and to see the new Naked City Tavern.  There are three menus available depending on time of day.  One is the overnight one from 10 PM to 11 AM menu.  The second one is 11 AM to 11 PM.  The other menu is the normal Naked City Pizza menu which consists of pizza and the other items served at the two other Naked City locations.

Standouts were the Dutch Babies--a cast iron skillet pancake with berry topping and vanilla cream, the bacon risotto, Nutella French toast, the Hot Mama, the yellowtail crudo, and the foie gras-duck confit tacos.  In other words, almost everything served was an outstanding dish with lots of creativity.  This is a place where two can share a few items.  Be aware that the Hot Mama is superb but there is so much to it that it would easily fill one person.  The crudo was outstanding with such an interesting and flavorful item as pickled blueberries around the base of the fish.  The Rebel pizza was very good.

4107004,2017-04-29,1,Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q,"I wanted to believe the hype, but I was underwhelmed by meal's end.

Naked City Tavern is an outpost of local favorite (and Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives featured restaurant) Naked City Pizza. Some notable differences: this one is 24/7, and they provide more menu items than just the namesake pizza, which I hadn't tried before and was really looking forward to.

I met up with several Yelpers for dinner, which notably didn't include brunch items (perhaps refer to other reviews for more on those, or look for my eventual brunch visit). We were able to share multiple items from their standard menu as well as a separate ""Enchantment Under The Sea"" menu.

We started off with some of their specialty fries ($5.50 ""small"" size, $7.50 large). The TV-featured Suicide Fries destroyed my palate during the first and final bite, so I wrote that off. The Poutine Fries were disappointing in several ways, starting with the lack of sufficient salt, continuing with the overall blandness in the mozzarella, gravy, and ending in the relatively boring soft texture of the fried potato. I couldn't write this one off.

The Braised Short Rib Stroganoff ($14.95) was a large, shareable plate that also suffered from lack of salt. It got better after we located a salt shaker, but the initial impression was hard to shake. Even given proper seasoning, I disliked the recipe because the overly shredded/minced preparation does not give proper respect to the short rib that was purportedly used.

I was finally impressed by the Lobster Pot Pie ($18.95), which consisted of delicious puff pastry and creamy tomato filling, the essential solid chunks of lobster, and the hard-to-find-at-this-place proper level of seasoning. I also tried the Pizza Logs ($7.95) - think crispy egg roll-like pepperoni pizza with cold red sauce dip, and proper seasoning for a second consecutive menu item.

I was so excited to try their specialty pizzas ($14.95 for a 1/4 sheet, which has 6 solid rectangular pieces), and both pizzas which we divided were great. The Naked City (sans olive per one person's request) is akin to what would be a ""combination"" or ""supreme"" on takeout/delivery pizza menus, and the Guinea Pig (another TV-featured dish) is a white sauce pizza with slices of their huge meatballs. Toppings were all delicious, and crust style is a little thicker and hence less crispy, but I loved eating every bit of it anyway.

At the end, I was able to sample a bit of the Strawberry Short Cake ($7.95), which eats about the same as it sounds but feels fairly light in texture. It's not too sweet either. That said, it was a little boring and didn't seem to have enough punch to be a post-pizza dessert, so I likely wouldn't order it myself next time.

I really wanted to give them a higher rating on the strength of the pizzas, but the service was lacking. Our server seemed to be stretched on the busy floor, and we couldn't help but wonder when our pizzas were coming out, among other concerns. Perhaps bar seating would have resulted in better service than at our table? I would've given points for some of the music that was playing, and the sports-filled TVs around the room, but that's not exactly why I came here tonight.

As I alluded to earlier, I'll likely be back to Naked City Tavern for their pizza and for a look at their brunchy items, but I was let down tonight. Despite enjoying the pizza so much, I need a little bit more before I can feel comfortable with calling myself a fan of the offerings overall.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,4,3,Rh21Y7pbvpnA3x9-vq_Eqg

The Tavern offers a pizza experience that is close to the original location, however with a heftier price tag and a lack of competency of the original's cooking staff.

The service was the worst I've had in recent memory. Maybe something was going on personally with the waitress because she had an unjustified attitude and really didn't take good care of our table. My husband and I asked for silverware since she didn't bring enough and she brought one set for the two of us. I thought maybe we were on a hidden camera prank show.

Originally getting a glimpse of Christopher Palmeri's vision for Naked City Tavern over a year ago with plates exploring the boundaries of ""bar food"" at Naked City on Paradise, the full concept unfurled during a Chef Series event for over a dozen patrons several months later, it has been a pleasure to see the 24/7 spot on South Pecos continue to develop ever since its July 2016 opening, an invitation to be one of the first to experience the new Winter Chef's menu truly an honor this Monday evening.

Still one of the hardest working Chefs in Sin City, his Buffalo-roots ever apparent as the Holiday décor and sounds of the Ravens and Patriots on Monday Night Football did little to hide a Bills mural or T-shirts in Blue and Red, it was at a long table with six other guests that myself and a Naked City First-timer sat for a multi-course meal the likes of which I've not seen in such a setting since Carlo Mirarchi's early Roberta's days, Manager Robert Chaney proving a gracious host with the assistance of two young ladies.

Long ago garnering national attention for food far better than it needed to be at Naked City Pizza Shop at Moondoggies, a combination of talent and tenacity plus a little bit of luck going a long way to allow for expansion including Naked City Tavern and a recent agreement to be the official Pizza purveyor for Las Vegas Motor Speedway, it was with a Cocktail of bottled Autumn that the meal got started, a Charcuterie Board offering good bang for the buck with fragrant and snappy Sausage served alongside stuffed Cherry Peppers, House-cured Pickles plus a duo of Artisanal Foods imported Meats and Cheeses.

Proudly listing his purveyors on a chalkboard in the dining room, something surely not seen at other all-day-and-all-night joints in town, course two featured a creamy ball of Burrata showered with Black Truffles at the center of a pool of crushed Tomatoes and Pesto, the Crawfish 'Popcorn' as clever as it was tasty with lightly battered Tails topped in Butter Powder alongside housemade Hot Sauce certainly not for the faint of heart or stomach.

No doubt a hearty seasonal menu, the Halibut a lone exception as each flaky Filet is lightly coated in just enough Bread Crumbs to sop up a touch of the vibrant Citrus Sauce, Palmeri's Game Hen Cassoulet is only marred by the fact that the Garlic would have been better served roasted and smashed than as whole Cloves, the Shrimp and Grits, on the other hand, absolutely flawless with a smooth texture resulting from slow-cooking a perfect backdrop to tender Shrimp along with housemade Bacon and pan-seared Mushrooms.

Seeing other diners slowing down, even though the richest plates were yet to come, those favoring fork-tender Short Rib need look no further than Naked City Tavern's Wellington, the Wild Mushroom Duxelle a bit salty but well matched by Bay Spinach, Sea Beans and the Red Wine Demi while the Ragout of Goat Osso Bucco layered nicely with rolled pasta despite a few bones found amidst the Garden-fresh Red Sauce.

Rounding out the main course with three sides, Palmeri's time spent studying ""Chef of the Century"" Joel Robuchon clearly not wasted as evidenced by the creamy Potatoes topped in a knob of housemade Truffle Butter, another sophisticated bite is found in the soft Lentils served ""Cacio e Pepe"" style while the stuffed Shisitos were a Russian Roulette sort of dish with some blazing while others were quite mild.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,6,7,5,Wx1Arb_UWZ9DBpmZDVEyOg

It does not get better than this !  Gourmet without the pretense.   Midge, Bartender working this morning is a delight, the chef on duty today, Mark, is an artist with his food ! This is likely one of the best rooms in Las Vegas !   This is NOT bar food only, they have the best pizza and wings but this is much more !  
This is a gastropub on steroids !   
Just stop in, have the Tavern Breakfast or something off the chefs menu!   This is the real deal and you owe it to your tastebuds to try it !  
Just make sure you save a seat for me !",io_h4Qs4j_P-Cyi9jEQ9SA,0,0,5,NuSiGVUUFH16W2iJLS6New

We had Tyler as our server; he was super nice and just the right amount of attentive. He also was really knowledgable about their beer list as well as the menu.

We ordered a lot more food then we could have finished, but it was all amazing. The chicken wings with fries as delicious (I'd take a giant bowl of the fries alone because they were addictive), garlic buns (easily a meal in itself) that were actually garlicky, and we got the smallest size ""Back Home"" pizza (I think that's what it was called) which we took half home for leftovers.

Definitely recommend Naked City Tavern. It's nice to have a place to just relax with good beers and good food locally.",iXH1N0c3URs4_dvt9qN_iQ,0,0,5,Y_x7fXcRSFvwfN6GiRcoUg

5611391,2016-07-27,0,Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q,"To the Yelper who said this place was like Chuck E Cheese, I guess this place is like CEC in that it has pizza and a whopping three video game machines in a corner by the door? But really, I wanna know what CEC you've been to that has mason jar candles on the tables and you can order a rum and coke (or a nice selection of craft beers, if you're into that kind of thing.) We saw no giant mice or men dressed like giant mice, either. 

But for real. This place was great. If you'd been here while it was the Blind Tiger, you'll be really very excited to see that it is not the Blind Tiger anymore.

We split a chicken finger sub and a Rebel pizza. The sub was good, the seasoned french fries that come with it were on point. I think those with a nice fry sauce alone should be a menu option. Being from Pittsburgh, I put the fries on the sub and it was awesome. Generous portions, it was good that we split it, I think one whole sub would be too much for one person. 

The Rebel Pizza was incredible. Great combinations of toppings and everything was cooked perfectly - crispy, rendered pepperoni, just the right amount of spicy sausage, and roasted tomatoes. Really awesome.  

Service was great. Just seemed to be one bartender and one server on duty, but there were only a few other tables (they have JUST opened in this location) and the server was friendly and checked on us often, but not so much that it was too much. I asked him if he thought the place was divey (Yelp question) and we decided it wasn't divey-divey, but candle-lit divey. If candle-lit divey sounds good to you, then you'll be happy here. 

Although we liked the original TailSpin that was here, we're glad to have a nice place back in this space again and look forward to coming back.",IwzUGunOvSCtm0xfZwFR6g,1,2,5,1O3A7NbfaOLFmrjY1k95FQ
5626803,2016-08-10,1,Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q,"So my husband and I popped in here for a bite to eat while waiting for our dog we had to bring to emergency clinic nearby.  I actually bartended here for the last month Tailspins was open. The layout hadn't changed at all the decor was very plain, boring and cheap looking. 

We tried the back home pizza and garlic Parmesan fries. Both of us are not big fans of deep dish but was hoping this might change our minds but unfortunately wasn't to our liking. Also I am not a fan of the style of fries either. Very greasy. The only positive thing was I did have a delicious peach ale. And our server was great. 

Maybe other items on menu are better but this place isn't close enough to us to bring us back to try them.",nVaEKWMYWVGdJKsSx0Bb_Q,2,1,3,6SOfnbaGAlLA1ysRWIhtuw
5714916,2016-07-17,0,Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q,"So far so good!!! Opened yesterday and us locals on this side couldn't be happier!!! Your regular Naked City Pizza menu, with a few changes, at a nice little east side bar. Nice jukebox, great tunes, great girls behind the bar. Huge inside, ample parking and a small amount of arcade style games in the corner. No pool tables, but lots of machines to gamble at the counter. Pretty good beer selection! Jacqueline makes an amazing Raspberry Lemon Drop! 

Pizza by the slice!!! Had a slice of pepperoni and it was amazing easy coast curly pepperonis. The kind that curl into a little bowl of amazing juice. And the piece was huge!!! Non-traditional pouting... Garlicky. Harty. Cheesy. All the gal could ask for. A smidge salty, but for being open 24 hours... I applaud you!! 

Welcome to the neighborhood, Naked City!",UEeZ-eE63citRQIeqsQq1g,6,2,4,3TGuIEWvlGfq48pwJi47CA
5773691,2016-07-21,6,Y9kXVlU4xPfSZvkZH6C_2Q,"Decided to drop in to the new neighborhood local bar/tavern to check it out. To be honest I had no idea anything was here before even though I drove past it hundreds of times. But when Naked City put its name on it, and their pizza in it, it was worth investigating.

The door opens to one big room, with a huge U-ish shaped gaming bar to the right. This bar stretches from one end of the large room to the other, I'm guessing 40 places? One of the larger bars I've seen. On this Sunday night around 5pm, it was packed with all the people checking it out. The rest of the room has a variety of booths and open 4 top tables. I didn't really wander around too much to check out all the stuff. Its a bar, same as most any other bar.

Service was good and friendly. They have a nice variety of beers on tap, and wine and hard liquor. It almost seems as if the bar itself isn't finished, there is seemingly plenty of room for storage and displays but they aren't used effectively. This is not one of those flashy upscale places, its a neighborhood bar. They have a nice set of large screen TV's for viewing sports. 

Now for the pizza. You can order by the slice, or by the size. Pizza's are square in shape. I had just a slice with ham and pineapple and it came out to about $5 and the slice was huge. I mean Huuuuuge. I barely finished it. And it was really tasty, a thicker crust that was crunchy, and lots and lots of cheese. Really great slice of pizza!

Stop by, check it out. I will be back for the pizza. Caution, it does get a little smoky in there, especially at the bar.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,7,7,4,Yf7AMpKiPFk03cK9aO3Zvw

They offer many specials on a nightly basis and a great selection of beers on tap.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,10,11,5,l2axkwUpOxy2Rn5YXqt8qQ
