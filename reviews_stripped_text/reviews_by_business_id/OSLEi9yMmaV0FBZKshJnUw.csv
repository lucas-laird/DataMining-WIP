4076982,2017-08-30,0,OSLEi9yMmaV0FBZKshJnUw,This Subway location has never let me down. I do not understand the bad reviews. I've been coming here off and on at different times for year and I have always gotten the same friendly and attentive service. The sandwiches are standard but what more could you want for $5?,q_MAN02WzJ6RzpzfWCt20A,0,0,5,RPLIwHGZ2G3OOAyTFUa0lw
4739263,2013-09-02,3,OSLEi9yMmaV0FBZKshJnUw,"This subway location is brand new and it's open until 10pm. Its a small subway, with four tables inside and three outdoor seating tables. Eveything is very clean. The sandwich bar is really fresh, no nasty lettuce and old tomatoes! I checked out the bathroom too and it was clean. The staff is really nice and friendly.

This location is conveniently located right next to a Starbucks too. Right on the corner of Flamingo and Eastern. They did a nice job preparing my $4 lunch special black forest ham 6"" sub. I will definately be back :-)",XT06McUUgrEVvkJZyN26WQ,4,3,5,1tYmwOcOPD2W6T8imoEgRw
5001008,2014-12-09,0,OSLEi9yMmaV0FBZKshJnUw,"Small location with 3 tables inside. Couple small tables outside. Located next door to Starbucks. Location gets pretty busy between 12 and 1. They speak Spanish for all you Spanish speakers. Pretty fast and good service. Bathroom inside will be locked. Jus ask the clerk to open the door for you. Subway has sandwiches, chopped salads and flatizza. They also have chicken noodle and cheddar broccoli soup everyday.. And don't forget the cookies!",NsHeN5dKRmYfJTmTxMITmQ,0,0,4,J-cDrguCs8hMR1YTyDbKKQ
5198257,2017-09-03,0,OSLEi9yMmaV0FBZKshJnUw,This Subway location is the best! Dino & Jeronimo are real sandwich artist! They make your sandwich with love and just the way you love it! I've worked subway back in California and I know how much work it can be! It's crazy because there is a close subway to my house. Yet they are very rude and sloppy! I will drive the extra miles to get my fresh sandwich! If you want a Subway sandwich go here they do it right!!! Gracias Dino and Jeronimo buen Trabajo!!,tFLFrEjD9omSqs0gqSYxvA,1,1,5,GESXWU5CIOj0DVXntGrhfw
