If you're looking for something DIRT CHEAP... This is not the place to go, because frankly, for the price you get here, you can find better places closer to the strip, if that's what you're after.
Now, I actually got to stay there for free but I'm still going to nit-pick everything for your convenience. 

1. Site said they're pet friendly, so we brought our small dog. Pretty much the deciding factor why we chose it... When we arrived at about 5am to get our room, we unloaded into the room, and finally bring the dog in. 5 mins later, their little downs syndrome security guard on his bicycle came pounding on our door saying they saw the dog on camera and that we're not allowed to have dogs here... Ugh, wtf? Your site said animal friendly.. So fk you guys! We put the dog in the truck, and surprisingly enough. We were harassed for about 2 hours by their security talking about the dog. They sat in the room above us, and continually circled our truck looking inside? Who the fk do you think you are? Harassing your customers and making them feel like criminals over a damn dog.

2. The rooms are not what the site says. There are no kitchen areas, no fridges.

3. The shower and toilet had a disgusting black residue all over it. Do they even hire cleaning maids?

4. The beds are god awful as far as comfort. At one point I took a pillow and laid on the ground... To my disbelief, the ground smelled like feces... Could this place get any worse? YES IT CAN!

5. During almost every cigarette break I took outside, a hooker either walked by or drove by looking for the room she was called to... So yea, if you're looking to be around that kind of stuff, this is the place to go.

I would give this place 0 stars if possible... They're lucky to even get one... This place is the biggest joke I've ever seen in my life... Frankly, I'd rather stay in a Motel 6 than ever even thinking about this place... Avoid at all costs. Don't even consider. No matter how cheap their rooms are, remember, it's Vegas, there's a hundred places that are just as cheap and better quality.",dkBzbHN6kTzJ-dyZjPfUew,6,1,1,OWsFBz8o4a_e5Vf2qObhdA

Our comforter smelled so bad I had to put it in the closet and close the door.  I didn't like how the hotel building was separate from the casino/ restaurants.

We needed two rooms and the svelte lady, with short dark hair, at the front desk was so very kind to us! My adult daughter wanted her own room, and this sweet lady found a room right next door to us. This made it easier on our family to spend time together. It may seem like such a small thing , but I really appreciate her thoughtfulness & consideration. She went the ""extra mile"" for us which is so rare in today's "" me first world""! Keep up the good work!!  The housekeepers were also very nice & deserve to be tipped for their work, which I am careful to do on a daily basis. My room was very tidy & clean. They even took the time to set the alarm clock to the right time, something I didn't do before because I was too busy. I will admit, the room was basic, but that doesn't bother me. I didn't come there to LV to camp in my Hotel room!! It's Vegas, baby!!! I enjoyed the bars, discounted drinks, live music, buffets, and restaurants there. Everyone was very kind to us!

I'll just start with why I gave them 3 stars. 

This establishment gets 3 stars cause of there customer services. Someone made an error on our reservations and we got upgraded to a suite and for even a less price so Kudos for that! 

On to the ratchet mess my godson who's 8yrs old,  his mom and myself had to witness. As we first pull up I see women with literally just thigh high boots, panties and a see through top along with another working girl with basically nothing on. I can't believe Arizona Charlie's allow them to be around the front doors like that. Seriously, we were greeted by them. WTF?  But hey it was late I had drove for hours and I was tired.

The room we had was nice and clean. The building was clean but why have all that going on at the front entrance where people and their family enters. 

The next morning we get up and get ready to head to breakfast at the local Denny's down the street and when we get off the elevator it was a man SMOKING CRACK!

While waiting for our apartment to be ready, we chose this place because as everyone knows, its far better then any of the suites around here. After a long stressful day of dealing with finding our apartment, I pulled back the sheets to the bed in the bedroom, and there were 3 large fresh poo stains on the sheets!! I was horrified!! I then looked up...to look away...and on the ceiling was a fairly large blood stain!! on the ceiling!!! We immediately called the front desk and got the voice mail so we left a msg. After about 30mins with no response, we had to change out of our pj's and walk all the way back to the front desk. The kid at the desk was very nice, and just as horrified as we werr when I showed him the pictures.(which I would attatch if I knew how!) He moved us to a new room, but was a non smoking because they had no more smoking rooms available, and it was a lot farther away and on 3rd floor...and elevators out of order of course! He gave us buffet passes for 3 meals each because he said that was all he could do, but would let the mgr. know and see what she could do for us. We never heard from her, no apologies or anything. I gave 2 stars because the rest of the staff was great, and our second room was much better. But the lack of empathy from management, and lack of communication, really irks me. I dont know that I would ever stay there again, or recommend it. Just think people should know and be warned! Who knows whats on that bedding you CANT SEE!!

Check in was fast and friendly but upon check out a small problem arose with my deposit being returned. Alfter a couple of phone calls, this problem was fixed and I recieved my deposit. The woman handling this issue could have been a little more friendly in my opinion, after all it was their mistake. The room was big, comfy and clean with a seperate livingroom area. Nothing fancy by any means, a little outdated, but it was clean.The only thing I didn't like about the room was that the sink is right next to the bed. There is a 7-11 around the corner and I always saw security roaming around whenever we were coming and going which was nice to see.
The buffet was horrible. We ate there once for dinner and once for breakfast. The prime rib at dinner was decent, the made to order waffles at breakfast were cold and hard, as was most of the cafeteria style food they offered. The service was good and friendly.
The casino was nice in the fact that it wasn't overly crowded, had a good variety of machines and paid out decently. The beverage servers were non existent.

897686,2015-11-14,1,mRsb657hi4iQcb0r5_VlYw,"This is a disgusting hotel worst experience. They don't clean the rooms at all, based on the huge blood stain we found on the bed. Unfortunately we had kids with us that day and they had to be exposed to this filthy, unsanitary room.  

When the hotel personal was notified they just offer to switch our room and the room they had given us was a room that smelled like cigarette smoke.  After seeing that room and returning to our room, that I had not seen because I was out getting some food, we decided to go back to the front desk. We had taken our food back to the car a soon as my cousin mention the situation he had found in the room and before checking any of the rooms out (unfortunately we would end up eating cold food).

We had to wait over 20 minutes because the lady was on break and no one was there to attend the front desk. Not only did she refuse to give us back our money but didn't seem to believe us about the filthy room. She must have heard the conversation I was having with my cousins wife, about speaking to the corporate office if the lady didn't help us. My cousin was the one speaking to her and she had offer to give us back half the money and put us in the room she had given us, since they don't offer refunds.

She was saying that the room is cleaned and that there couldn't be any blood stain on the bed. That's when I stepped in and said it was dirty that we weren't making this up. That's when she said she was going to refund our money but first she had to send security to check it out make sure we weren't lying.

Waited another 20 mins security came to the room took pictures and left. My cousin came back up 10 mins later and said we had to be out of the room before we get our money back. Security was nice enough to approach us and assumed we had been told to leave the room because of sanitary reason. But unfortunately this wasn't the case, the only reason was to get a refund. That refund was only given because the lady knew I would contact corporate about this unsanitary hotel.  

I would give them a lower star if I could would never recommend this hotel to anyone even if it was the only one available. Which reminds me the lady also wished us luck finding another hotel because they were all booked and it was more of the way she said it like she was hoping we couldn't find another hotel. Not the kind of customer service anyone should experience.

I also took pictures and video of this unsanitary room.",xfoy5CMUKSGhyYaygzHs0w,4,0,1,U4CmafMOdbD084NRFbEFVQ

1173393,2014-07-01,0,mRsb657hi4iQcb0r5_VlYw,"Stayed here for EDC Friday night to Monday night. We got our hotel for a really cheap price for a decent hotel room. We got a room with a king bed that was separated from the other room with couches and a tv. Which was perfect 'cause it allowed the sleepy heads to be separate from the people who were awake. Downside was that the bathroom and sink was on the bedroom side, but we managed. The bathroom vent was really loud, so it may have woken up my friends a couple times.

The room wasn't massively huge or anything, but it was a decent size with a decent amount of floor space. The bed took up most of the room. The couch and the furniture in the other room could be moved to make more space for 4 or 5 people to all lie on the ground comfortably.

My friends thoroughly enjoyed the $5 steak and eggs. They would order two plates per person. I don't like steak so I got to enjoy the farmhouse special or something with was bacon and eggs for about $3 or $4. Also enjoyed their $1 mimosas!!! 

The service was ok but a bit slow. They seem to be understaffed, because there's only one person working the reception during non operating hours. Check in is around 3 pm, and check out is around 11 am, so I think around those times they will have 2. 

Whenever we wanted something we had to wait for awhile to get it. We wanted towels, but because we didn't want to wait, we went to get it from the pool instead. The pools is nice and modest, this hotel is nice and modest. We're not complaining for the price.

1570409,2018-06-25,0,mRsb657hi4iQcb0r5_VlYw,"My complaint is specifically about the restaurant, Sourdough Café.  I had stopped there at 10:50pm last night to order a cheeseburger and onion rings.  The restaurant was practically empty with only about 2-3 tables utilized.  Like I have done many times in the past, I asked if my food could be delivered to the bingo hall as I would there playing bingo.  The manager who took my order said sure that would not be a problem.  At the beginning of the final game of bingo, about an hour later, I returned to the restaurant to find out what happened to my order considering I have never known it to take an hour to cook a cheeseburger.  Turns out my order was just sitting there on the cashier counter getting cold.  When I asked the manager what happened she replied very nonchalantly ""We are short handed so no one was available to deliver.""  Couple of things: Number one, there were four people (counting the manager) standing at the cashier counter just talking when I walked up.  Number two, as I already stated the place was dead.

Then the following morning I woke up with multiple bug bites, then day after I woke up with more. I requested a room change and they switched us to another room but didn't follow through with their investigation as they promised till this day. (6/17/18)

HOTEL (REALLY A MOTEL): Rooms are very basic, comparable to budget chains like Motel 6 and Super 8. No resort fee, but also no WiFi -- 12 bucks a day extra if you want that. Needless to say no in-room coffee, fridge or micro either. But it was clean enough, and maybe I just got lucky but it was quiet enough, and on booking sites you can get weekends for around $40 after tax sometimes. I would imagine Aceplay members can also get discounts and comps relatively easily since the rooms are so basic. OK in a pinch just to save money, at least if you bring your own wifi or don't need it. 

CASINO: Looked like some OK pay tables, decent locals-focused place, honestly I didn't gamble here at all or poke around the machines much though. Points and tiers are shared between the other AZ Chuckles location and the Stratosphere. 

FOOD: This is where the place really shined, the little grill on the first floor of the casino and the Sourdough Cafe upstairs had all sorts of nice deals, customer service was great, food was very solid. 10% discount on the already good prices for the most basic level of Aceplay cards and apparently discounts go up with the tiers too",nNlRYWO00FvLVQx9Hp6_dw,3,2,3,UP_PEGSJlqiCdrAx4f6o-A

Location is off the strip on Boulder highway. I had a convention at Sam's town and this was a cheaper hotel. Location is within a mile of Sam's town, but the neighborhood was a little dicey. The back rooms are next to a trailer park and a 711 which makes the element not so great. In the hotels defense they did have security cameras and bike patrols in the area. Was last here in 2006 and was better then. Hotel rooms need a major renovation. Rooms were as clean as expected but so old you could only do so much. My non smoking room was only a suggestion I suppose and the 19"" tube tv was vintage to say the least.

My husband and I checked in about 2AM October 31, it was the beginning of our anniversary.  We live locally, but wanted our anniversary away from home and our kids, just to have our special day together.  We had just seen a great tribute concert and a small venue and headed to Arizona Charlie's to turn in for the night.  We already had a reservation for the following night, but asked the desk clerk if we could add this night on.  She checked, and yes our room was available, she made the adjustments and as she did, we chatted about this was our anniversary, we had just seen a fabulous concert, and how I had a bad headache because I wasn't used to the loudness I experienced.  She offered there was a 7-11 next door where I could get some Ibuprofen if I needed, but I said I just need to rest a bit in some quiet.
My husband went to go play a few slots while I went up to our room to lie down.  As soon as I entered the room, I was appalled.  Sure it was a smoking room, but it smelled like the room had been on fire or that the windows had never been opened.  I turned on lights and the carpets were stained and dirty, like not even vacuumed dirty, I could see things left behind on the carpet.  This was a small suite, so there was a ""living room""  with a couch, chair, and dining table.  The remote for the TV had NO batteries in it, so could not turn on the living room TV and had some unknown stuff all over it.  The curtains were torn and stained, the window sill had stains and wallpaper was peeling in places.
Enter the bedroom, the bedding looked clean and well made, more carpet stains and evidence of poor vacuuming.  The air vent cover was off and leaning against the TV stand, the remote for this one had batteries but no cover over them, and there's a little sign that says wifi is $11.99 per day.  The closet has more carpet stains and damage, the hangers are dirt, you can see old dirt and hair on them and dead bugs and dirt inside the light globe.  The bathroom looked clean with a couple clean towels, but the toilet had issues flushing.
I text my husband this room is gross but I need to lie down.  I talked to the manager first thing in the morning, explained and showed pictures and she was shocked.  We were refunded immediately with mountains of apologies and promises there will be a housekeeping overhaul and some remodeling of rooms in this condition.

I am a member of the players club, which covers both Arizona Charlie's locations as well as the Stratosphere, and responded to a direct offer I had received from them which gave me an upgraded suite for the price of a standard room.

Check-in was very rapid, and I was especially appreciative of the check-in clerk.  I was having a problem with my debit card at the moment - it turned out the company had put a temporary block on it for suspicion of identity theft!  Fortunately, I got it all straightened out, and the front desk clerk swiped that card about 10 different times over the course of an hour without even frowning. That takes alot of patience - you don't often see much of that in the customer service industry anymore. Thanks again!

The property differs slightly from the Decatur location, as all of the corridors and buildings are outside vs. being enclosed. The decor of the rooms is a little more Mediterranean vs. Southwestern, as the Decatur location is. The suite (I believe it was a Standard King Suite) was very spacious, two televisions, extra cold air conditioner, very good water pressure, and lots of closet space.  The bathroom was a bit small, but no complaints.  This property was originally built as a group of extended stay suites that wound up going bankrupt, which might be one of the reasons the rooms are so big, and come with a good value.

The pool and hot tub area was small, but more than adequate, and not crowded at all.

The casino was great as always - lots of the newer multiline penny machines, but unfortunately, almost no old-skool 3 reels.  The Sourdough Cafe was teriffic. Be sure to check out the Steak and Egg special, it's one of the best, and has won several awards in Las Vegas magazines.  

One thing to make note of is that this particular neighborhood is not the most glamourous - you'll see alot of drug dealing and prostitution from here to the Budget Suites a couple of blocks down the road.  However, I can't fault the hotel for this.

Overall, a teriffic stay and I'd recommend it to everyone. Remember, you won't get the glitz and glamour of the Strip in some of these off-strip casino hotels, but it's been proven that places like these are far superior in customer service and higher casino payouts.

Check in was pleasant.  Major improvement at the Registration Desk!  It was such a welcome change from my last several visits, it put an even bigger smile on my face.  

My King suite was a smoking room, so as soon as I sat my bags down I immediately started smoking.  I smoked and I smoked and I smoked.  It took a while, but soon I had a really good cloud going in the room.  I mean, it was so smoky it was difficult to see the big ass TV through the haze.  Clearly, there are few responsibilities as a hotel guest I take more seriously than my obligation to keep my smoking room smoky.

You smoke like that you gonna get hungry.  And that's exactly what happened.  But damn, by now I'm in NO condition to drive anywhere.  And I had a really good smoke going on.  I didn't want to be away from the room so long I'd lose the smoky momentum I had going.   As I always do in such cases, I lit a small fire in the wastebasket and then poured just enough water on it to put out the flames.  I sat the smoldering wastebasket in the bathtub and waited until the suite was completely filled with smoke.  That would buy me at least an hour or so.  

I needed a quick meal, so Arizona Charlie's coffee shop, the Sourdough Cafe, was out of the question.  They're not quick.  I decided to try the little deli tucked away in the back corner of the casino.  Turned out to be a good choice.  The cheesesteak I had was pretty dang good.  And it was ready quickly!  There was still plenty of smoke in the room when I got back.

I like to think that when I checked out three days later I had made some real progress on the smokiness of the suite.  There's a lot to do in Las Vegas and I ended up spending a lot of time outside of the room.  Still, I know I left Arizona Charlie's a little smokier than I found it.  I'm good with that.

Our hotel room was simple and clean. The large living/dining room was spacious with just enough furniture for two. The furniture was somewhat scratchy and outdated though but I wasn't expecting much. The bedroom was big enough for a queen sized bed and a TV, although the mattress did not fit the bed frame very well. Sheets were clean, no bed bugs. Bathroom/bathtub all clean, no mold or cracks. The entire time we kept the AC at a 60 because temps were around 120 the entire time we were there. Basic wifi is free for up to 3 devices. If you want faster internet, its about $10 per day per device.

Service was fine. Everyone we encountered was friendly. We ate at the restaurants located inside the casino. They're cheap but the food was good enough to satisfy your hunger. Plus there are great Mexican places nearby to eat at. Location wise, this worked pretty well because it was away from the strip (wanted to avoid it during this trip) but super close getting to the venue for EDC. Security patrols the entire lot for most of the day because the casino's open 24hrs.

It's not like many other places that entice you with the  low price in vegas, then in very fine print state a mandatory resort fee or internet fee must be paid upon arrival. (That is what happened during my last stay in vegas at one of the ""Station"" resorts, my resort fee was more than the actual room cost!)

The place is laid out somewhat weird, the hotel rooms are located behind the parking garage in what looks like a run down housing project. Don't let the exterior fool you, the inside was about as clean and maintained as a more expensive place. The notepad next to the phone (which came complete with some else's math equations) indicate that it may be owned or operated by the same people as the stratosphere.

If you are in Vegas for work, and not fun, it is a convenient place to stay, as you don't have to walk a mile to get to your vehicle. If you have a work truck of some sort, you can probably park close enough to see it from your room.

I booked the room with a single king bed, but was placed in a room with two full size beds....not a big deal for me...

The 2 star review just became a 1 star... like noted my first day was an absolute hell here and I've been nervous since and even had a nightmare. The first day I got here and kindly told the front desk lady that I had recently had ankle surgery and couldn't walk far. She said she understood and would get me one of the closest rooms. 

After getting my room number I went to go to my room, when I inserted my key it didn't work. I figured maybe I had a bad key so I tried both and neither worked. I called the front desk to contacted security and security told me that the front desk wrote down the wrong building and room number.

After finding the right room I went in and put my stuff on one of the beds and went to use the restroom since I had just been on the road for a couple hours. I went into the bathroom and after using the toilet I noticed blood on the ground under the toilet and right against the wall.. this absolutely freaked me out as blood can carry disease. I called the front desk and told them and they said they would send someone to meet me at my ""upgraded"" room.

One final update.. I went back to my orginal booking email and I had a double room with double beds.. why did they try to put me in a normal 1 room 2 bed room? 

They claimed I was upgraded when I got the room I was supposed to have in the first place?????

So after going to my upgraded room and standing outside for 15 minute an security guard showed up and said oh I thought you'd still be at the other room. After this he let me in and went our seperate ways. 

I once again put my stuff on the bed and went to Walmart when my friend as soon as he had gotten to my room. We went and enjoyed some in-n out and got some drinks and food at walmart, about 3 hours later we got back and I went to use the bathroom to only find the toilet clogged with used toilet paper and an handle that was ""loose""..

I've only been able speak to the front desk and never have been able to contact a manager. The front desk however said that the manager they've contacted at home would be happy to give me $10 off my total purchase.... Seriously? I seen blood and now even had nightmare about it.. not to mention someone else's toilet paper and a clogged toilet isn't what I paid for.

The last thing I want is a luxury-priced hotel that cuts into my thin bottom line.  I prefer budget accommodations.  So half a dozen years ago I went with this property located about 6 miles away from the Strip, on Boulder Highway, just a little north of Henderson.  But I always rent a car and don't like the long lines of the large strip hotels anyway.  So this property's somewhat distant location was not much a deficiency for me.
   The casino has a very nice restaurant, the Sourdough Cafe, with terrifically inexpensive specials , especially breakfast specials. The rooms themselves are well worn, acceptable in size if not spacious, and modestly appointed, with nothing extra -- no microwave or refrigerator (at least not in the standard rooms).  There is an outdoor pool on site but no gym.
   The location is a step above awful -- that doesn't bother me at all.  But if I were a woman staying alone or a family with children I might give it some pause.  There are ""working girls"" who clearly frequent the property and the sidewalks near it.  But to the property's advantage are three large full-service and budget-oriented casinos: Boulder Station, Sam's Town, and The Cannery East.  The Longhorn Casino, home to many very inexpensive breakfast and dinner specials is also within a nice stroll.
   The best reason to stay is the price -- among the very lowest in the Las Vegas area.  And, to top it off, THERE IS NO RESORT FEE!!!!!!!  All things considered, this is the best deal for an acceptably clean and functional casino hotel room.",Tmx3kZwNJLy8vqkG2s9PBw,0,0,4,yLtQFGkDroGK8zVtanjReA

4200365,2014-05-09,0,mRsb657hi4iQcb0r5_VlYw,"RV RESORT REVIEW My wife and I stayed her for three days in April 2014.   First off,  we called ahead and asked if our four Chihuahuas would be a problem.  They said if the dogs were well behaved it would not be a problem.  So first positive,  while they say they have a two dog limit,  if your dogs behave they will let you stay with more.   Do not lie to yourself about your dogs behavior,   do not screw it up for the rest of us,   if your dogs do not follow commands and behave,  do not push the limits.     The pads are concrete which is nice.  Level which helps level the unit.   We had a 27 foot travel trailer and this was the easiest leveling job we ever had.   That is the second plus.    The dog run was OK but small.   We had to wait until those with big dogs to leave before we could take our Chihuahuas in.

Right down the street from my son - so I've been here before but not to stay.
Customer service and ease of getting the suite on the first floor was great.
The suite area was very nice - lots of room.
I always bring my slippers because most rooms have that crappy rug and you know people keep their shoes on and bring (stuff) in from the outside, bathrooms, other not so clean...
Price:  great
Noise:  none

Bed:  great - hige
TV:  great

The Hubs and I had to print out tickets for a Game we were going to the 1st night we were there, we asked about the Business center only to find out there want one but had this mini little computer to print. We got charged $11.00 to print and use the computer for 3 min.s. 1st strike. 
When we got to the room, the card didn't work. Went back to the front and got new ones. From that point only 1 worked. When we finally got into the room it smelled like if someone had smoked Marijuana and if someone was in their 5 min.s before and had done the dirty. It was a bad smell. Strike 2.
For the 1st 2 Days we didn't have any Hot water. On the 2nd day I went to call the front desk only to not be able to call cause the Phone was broken. I had to walk all the way to the front from the back. I waited 20 .min.s in line to tell the front desk about what happened. They called maintenance and said someone was going to meet there. When he got there the guy told me that they had shut the water off cause they had a issue. WTF no one couldn't tell us that. We didn't have any water for 2 days and you couldn't tell us there was issues. Strike 3.
Than the topping on the cake the day we checked out we needed a few extra minutes to check out ( since it was 11am for check out). Someone came banging on our door ( we had slept in on accident after coming in late from the night before). I tried to call down stairs to the front and NO ONE answered the phone for 45 min.s . When I FINALLY got someone on the phone and woman name Rebecca answered with a nasty adittude and said that she will give us 5 min.s to check out and than hung up on me. I was done.. we packed up everything and went and checked out. I am Officially done with coming here. Never again.

4915776,2012-06-22,1,mRsb657hi4iQcb0r5_VlYw,"Avoid at all costs!!!
I would like to point out that I grew up in a family that worked in the service industry (I was even a busboy at the age of 12) so I am very sympathetic when things don't always go as planned when dealing with any service industry. But this time I have to come out ""Guns a Blazing"" to help you avoid this dump. 

1. Family Friendly: I would say NOT!!! We went as a group; 10 families for a softball tournament in Las Vegas. We were told we had to stay in this hotel otherwise we could not be in the tournament. (Letter of complaint to the ASA Las Vegas Tourney's on the way). This place is not kid friendly or even family friendly at all. The only location to go as a group to is the swimming pool. Even though you're as quiet as a ghost, security show's up to kick you out of the pool area promptly at 10:00pm. There is no other location for families (groups) to mingle unless you want to go to the smoke filled casino.

2. Room's: Bring your own cleaning supplies and leave the kids outside while you clean the room. The rooms were non-smoking and didn't have the dingy stale smoke smell many converted rooms had. We were in building #3 room 2312 and the floor (carpet) was filthy and in need of carpet replacement badly. The Bathroom needed a deep cleaning in all areas. The rooms in my building was actually two rooms a living area with twin size bed that sat 3 feet off the floor and the master room with a queen size bed right up against the sink....Yes I said ""sink"" that was in the master bedroom. It turns out that the bathroom is so small that they couldn't fit a sink in it, so they put the sink up against bed. So if your laying in the bed and it's time for someone to brush their teeth, your getting a shower. The windows in our room were so filthy you could barely see through it. The lighting in the room is very bad, so during the day you open the curtains for a little light and all you see is dried pigeon poop on the outside of the window. Not all the windows for all rooms were this bad...just mine, probably because it took a ladder to get to our second floor window and no one is that motivated. For some reason the TV in the living area was a tiny 22"" tube television and in the master bedroom the TV was bigger...don't ask me why???
The room air conditioner is seriously old school. There's a hole cut through the wall from the living area into the master bedroom with a pipe stuck through that comes out directly behind the TV in the Master Bedroom for ventilation. This thing is ""LOUD"" and rattles like a fright train. If it wasn't for 10 years of sleeping on an Aircraft Carrier, I would have gotten no sleep at all. Yes...I slept in the living area where the air conditioner is because my kids couldn't see the 22"" television or hear it because of the air conditioner. 

3. Exterior of building: They use natural earth tones to paint the building...but I can tell you it's been many, many years since they painted it. Every wall in every location has black scuff marks everywhere you look. It's like they had fifty 7 year old's pumped up on pop rocks and cola riding bicycles without training wheels for the first time. 

4. Pool: The pool is too small for the amount of people Arizona Charlie's can handle. I already told you they shut the pool down promptly without question (no one was even swimming in the pool). The first day we were there the pool needed a good skimming, but the second day when all the softball teams had arrived, they had to shut down the pool because the water became very cloudy. They drained half of it and then refilled it...it still look cloudy so we went to a friends hotel and used their pool. 

5. Casino: Your everyday locals smoke filled casino. Crowd was mostly over 65 and lived nearby. I did have one of our parents win $1,000 at the black jack table on a side bet...but it took her 30 minutes to collect her money because the pit boss didn't know how to make the payout. All the pit boss could say was: ""no one has ever won that side bet before.""

6. Restaurant: We ate one night at the restaurant (I don't remember the name). They were running a $15.00 dinner special we tried it and it was okay, nothing overly fancy and the food wasn't special at all. I will say that Tommy our server did an exceptional job and we really enjoyed his service. When my wife's seafood plate came out well overcooked like sole of boot when she asked for rare, he had no problem letting her switch to the beef dinner special. Tommy was great!!! the food was just okay. 
We didn't eat in the Buffet, even though I was looking forward to trying the breakfast there. Prices were fair $5.95 for breakfast buffet (with players club card) but one of the parents put a bad taste in my mouth when she said; ""Look how they clean our rooms, are you going to trust them to cook your food also?"" Needless to say we went to Denny's for breakfast and I never saw the buffet line the whole time we were there.",2KfwZsE1P1ihEcHgKxB8OA,2,0,1,RjsD-6qFPUeMSpH5POSpPQ

First of all for you young folks, no young, sexy people stay here. If you want that, you'll have to cough up some dough and book elsewhere. Its mostly older folks and families. Maybe its my own fault for hanging out with people who work part time menial jobs with low pay. The cheapest rooms are OLD. No other way to describe it! They are old with a 9 inch box TV. No exaggeration. The walls are very thin, you can hear everything the neighbors next to you and on top of you are doing. 

I did like that the room was at least clean, the shower and toilet worked properly, and the beds were comfortable. The rooms are separate from the casino, so if tobacco smoke bugs you that's a plus. The walk to you room from the parking is very close as well. The food is good, especially for the price ,it is a bargain. Get yourself a free rewards card and you'll get 10% off food. $3 Blackjack helps pass time as well.

The area is like any other part of Las Vegas off the strip. Weird people walking around, but not crowded.

The room was clearly not designed for their current furniture layout. There was an entire wall empty that left a big void in the room. The room was big enough for a bunch of people to hang out or if you're room sharing for an event. It was decided in two with a for between the bedroom and living room kind of space. The room is dark with the lights on and the windows closed, but fine if you keep the windows open. I prefer the windows closed when I'm changing and getting ready in the morning, however. 

The casino was typical, I guess. I'm not a gambler, but the thousands of slot machines looked the same as every other casino. I don't know if they have table games.  It smelled like smoke when you walk in. It's ok I guess. You get used to it.

The restaurants are ok. I bought one of their specials for $5 burger and fries from the cafe. I've had better for $5, but it's an ok price for a quick bite on a budget. The party was thin and the burger had no special flavor. The fries were very standard and typical too. They needed some salt.

5324310,2014-04-07,0,mRsb657hi4iQcb0r5_VlYw,"I prescheduled a post wedding dinner on April 6, 2014 for 24 guests at the Yukon Grille located within Arizona Charlie's Boulder Casino.  Some of the reviews suggested that it is located in an unsavory area of Las Vegas but our entire group found it quite acceptable.

A quick walk through the casino took us to the restaurant on the second floor.  I had read that you should not prejudge the Yukon but wait until you had experienced it for yourself.  Those reviews were ""spot on.""   It boasts an elegant, quiet, subdued atmosphere with an extremely competent and friendly staff.  Our visit was pre-coordinated with Debbi Lewis, their Food & Beverage Director.  She greeted us when we arrived and had two large tables waiting for us.  She kept close eye on us the whole evening to ensure that we were enjoying ourselves and that we received everything we ordered.  

Tom was our very knowledgeable and friendly waiter with assistance from a young lady.  (I was negligent and forgot to get her name).  The food was perfect and instead of delivering individual meals they used a two tier cart to deliver our soups, salads, and entrees to everyone at the same time.

I am a very picky person (my wife says ""an anal retentive perfectionist"") so I want everything to be right.  To go a step further, if I go to a restaurant and their restroom is not top notch, clean and well kept I usually do not go back.  I feel that this is an indication of how the restaurant management attends to detail and feels about their guests' total experience.  The Yukon restrooms were excellent to the point of being elegant.  Since I selected this restaurant for 11 of our family members and 13 of the bride's family (whom we had never met) I wanted this evening to go perfectly.  Debbi and Tom made sure of that.  

The thing I dreaded most, after setting this up, was the post meal plebeian ritual of everyone putting in 80% of what they think they owe and the sap who collects the monies (ME) gets to pay the shortage out if his own pocket.  To eliminate this hassle Debbi offered, and provided, separate checks.

Last but not least Debbi scheduled taxis for our return trip to our hotel.  Some of us were parties of five so Debbi had to make sure that the taxi dispatcher sent vans and not cars.

I know this has been a long review but when I am the recipient of an ""over the top"" experience I like to reward those who provided it.

If those who rated the Yukon anything less than 5 stars they should check the sign on the door because they were NOT at the Yukon.",A65Crn3U2ULpWcH6c4kLQA,1,0,5,nbFwS_ZcH8xVNcKpCQ67Tg

Will recommend all to stay here who dont want Strip prices but a great place to lay your head and eat. The pool was fun too.,A2N4y0VeZ-3TtmBVCSVVnQ,2,0,5,gwVCUWhXQUomz2EeODcxbw

They've since changed providers & it's worthless. This trip, when trying to sign on to WiFi, I kept getting wrong password message. Went to office to ask if this was correct password or if there was a different one. The lady stated I had the correct password & that too many people must be using the WiFi at the same time & password on the paper is correct. Maybe a little time should be spent looking into the WiFi to see if something is wrong or if hacked. So for a week & had to use my data plan that I used up so my provider charged me $15 more on my monthly plan. We pay $$ to stay here & to use the amenities. I'm tired of paying for things that I can't us. The dumpster aren't in the enclosures. The trash company dumps the trash, leaves trash on the ground & dumpsters in streets. You would think that AZ Charlie's would have a team that would go around & clean that up & put dumpster back in enclosures. Then said team should go around to make sure spaces a clean & ready for next guest. The RV Park office people used to be very nice. Now they're basically rude or just don't give a damn. 

The last year or so I'm not feeling very safe. In the adjoining neighborhoods every single night there's multiple gun shots (not RV parks fault of course) but I'm terrified a stray bullet could hit an RV in here & I don't want it to be mine. Not an exaggeration 

This WILL be my last time to EVER stay. I doubt anyone one from AZ Charlie's reads these reviews nor cares how people feel about paying for amenities they can't use but it makes me feel good to yelp & let others know how it truly is.",P36JEHiqp0yNflyHI7ApMA,0,0,1,K20vxP802IhuVcXv2Qi_sQ

And, I didn't want to stay at the Budget Motels... for obvious reasons.  So, I looked into hotels near my place and ended up choosing AZ CHUCK'S.  The hotel is not attached to the casino.  It has a small pool, which I didn't use.  The room I stayed in was actually pretty nice.  It was a one bedroom suite and it was quiet.  That is all that I was looking for when I ended up staying here for that time.  The Casino over the years has seen some renovation.  It is a nice little place with its' clientele being an older crowd spending their retirement money.  

They have a couple of restaurants upstairs, The Yukon Grill, Sourdough Cafe, and the Buffet.  Downstairs they have a couple of fast food places.  

My reason for checking into AZ Chuck's was to go to the Sourdough Cafe.  So, you can check out my review there if you like.",P9yweXls2Pg-EMipYr45XA,4,1,3,KjC4W7Mbc8GuYsxyNI_zrw

The casino is a decent size. Being a local and having a players club card you get specials mailed to you, 

When playing in the casino you do get free drinks, It is considered to be a locals casino because it is so far from the strip.

We have never stayed in the Hotel, I hear the rooms are pretty cheap if you need one. Remember you get what you pay for and if you want to be near the strip this is not close at all and it will take a bit with traffic to get there.",zH6racrZ7rUqqv_Qy6dZDQ,5,3,3,mykuHbHFw2I_z5HVc-JxXw

5843924,2015-04-01,1,mRsb657hi4iQcb0r5_VlYw,"Pros, Cons, then summary

Took my family to Las Vegas to watch the Monster Truck World Finals.  I was not in town this time to do the typical ""Vegas"" thing:  clubs, gambling, nice buffets, etc.  

PROS--Only a few miles from Sam Boyd Stadium.  Near some good fast food joints (ex: In-N-Out, Sonic, local joints, etc.).  The hotel was cheap, probably the only reason for two stars.  The shower had good pressure, and the toilet worked fine.  One huge pro was that the AC was a newer model and worked very well.  It kept the room at a constant cool temperature and was cold our entire stay.  Ice machine worked well too.  Because the neighborhood was a bit shady, they had bike security 24 hours, and they were nice and professional.  More importantly, the security was visible at all hours and seemed to take pride in their job.

CONS-- Very dirty rooms.  The floor was filthy.  We basically had to wear flip-flops in the room because wearing socks, or no socks, would turn the bottoms of our feet black.  The TV was state-of-the-art if it was 1991.  Old box TV.  Also, we had to call the front desk because it didn't have a remote.  (On the plus side, they did come in a few minutes)  The pool was rather small and dirty for a place this big.  I didn't do any gambling but did spend some time scouting the casino for future reference.  It was as others have described....old retirees, elders, and other odd people.  The neighborhood is shady.  Don't plan on walking anywhere after sunset (unless you have a CCW). There are numerous pimps and prostitutes up and down Boulder Hwy.   


Would I come back here?  Probably not, unless all other places were booked solid.  I'd trust a Motel 6 or Super 8 over Charlie's.  It's only redeeming value is if I ever plan to go to Sam Boyd stadium again.  Otherwise, if you're looking for the ""Vegas"" experience, this is not it.  Too far off the strip and no real nightlife.",bKNTJ6GNbi_Ry0AQRc5ZPQ,1,0,2,vu6cyNcMSTe6XWr6IdCqLg

The facility itself is really dirty on the outside and clunky. You almost feel like you're in the ghetto. As you leave the parking lot and come up to the registration desk it feels like an unsafe place. People at the front desk were were nice and helpful. The room was well just barely okay. The internet is 12 bucks per day per device. Not good for my taste. I slept well however I must say I sleep well everywhere. Yes, there were people outside yes they were talking loudly and yes it didn't bother me because I went to sleep. For those who sleep lighter this would have been very distressing. There's an acute lack of plugs for anything. I guess I'll say who cares I just checked in and went to sleep and got up and left. Off to find another hotel for the next night.
