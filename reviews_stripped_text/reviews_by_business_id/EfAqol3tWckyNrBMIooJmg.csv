I tried Nihari, Chicken Tikka, Biryani and Bihari Kabab, Chai (Tea) and Paan, everything was so good. Owner and staff were very friendly. On my four day trip to Vegas, I have already been there twice and will try one more time before to leave. Also one of their employee is future star, a wonderful singer :)

46755,2016-11-29,0,EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg,"Good food and outstanding honesty and integrity.  My cousin and I were in Vegas for the AWS conference. We are dinner at Kabob N More. I left the place around 730p and accidentally dropped my wallet around at the booth where we were sitting. No knowing, we left the place and headed back to our Venetian Hotel where we were staying. Right as I was getting out of Uber, I realized my wallet was missing. I immediately called the restaurant and the cashier looked at the counter then checked the booth where we sat but reported no sign of wallet. Meanwhile, I asked the Uber to take me back to the restaurant. Yes, I was terrified... Can you imagine the horror of losing IDs, money, CCs, etc while 2305 miles from home!?  Frightened at all the excruciatingly painful process I may have to go through to replace each and every CC, ID, Insurance and health card... I just stopped thinking about it and prayed for the best.  Before the Uber could pull into the parking lot after a short 6 mins ride the owner of the restaurant called and confirmed he had a wallet in his possession.  As soon as I walked-in, the owner, Fahim Akhtar, handed me my wallet and asked me to check the cash and IDs, which I did. Everything was in order, thank God! This was a fantastic find and save. Kudos to Kabob N More's entire staff. Oh yeah, Beef Seekh Kabab with Basmati rice, butter Naan, and Gyro were very good.",8-NYxeQ4MIYAzFG_cjDsCQ,0,0,5,ivhILFZU6EL8Qpu8KUwgRg

91609,2017-04-10,4,EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg,"This review is not on the food (because the food never came), but the costumer service: 
My boyfriend and I came here since the line at Tacos El Gordo was too long. Now we wish we have just stayed in the long line at Tacos el Gordo:

Cashier: ""What would you like to order?"" 
Us: ""Two chicken wraps; one with rice and the other with fries.""  
Cashier: ""Ok..fries? And the other with rice?
Us: Yes
Cashier: ""and to drink?""
Us: ""A cup of water and a sprite""

We sat down and waited 15 mins for our food. Only ONE chicken wrap and rice came to the table. My boyfriend asked the server if another wrap was on its way. The server stared at us as if he didn't understand English. He didn't say a word. Just stared. So I asked, ""We ordered two chicken wraps, one with a side of rice and the other with fries. Is the other wrap w/fries coming?"" Again the server stared, then decided to looked at our receipt and squeaked: ""One"" and quickly walked off. We were confused if that meant the cashier accidentally charged us just for one wrap. The bill as $19 something and didn't seem like one chicken wrap w/rice and a sprite (and tap water) would cost so much. But it's Vegas, so we wanted to make sure that was the case. So we went to the cashier:

Boyfriend: ""Hi, I just ordered two chicken wraps and a sprite from you. One with rice and the other with fries. Only one wrap came, is the other coming out soon? Or did you forget to charge us?""

Cashier: Mumbles incoherently (we didn't understand what he said so we asked again)  

This was when the manger/owner (?) came out yelling defensively from the back: 

Manger: ""ONE! ONE WRAP!""
Boyfriend: ""Hi, I ordered two-""
Manager: ""YOU WANT ANOTHER WRAP? GET IN LINE!""
(The cashier went hiding because he knew he messed up our order but was too scared to tell his boss)
Boyfriend: ""Look I was just asking- (gets cut off again)
Manager: ""Sir you want another wrap? There is the line. You buy one and I make you a wrap"" *said condescendingly 
Boyfriend: ""Fuck this. I don't need to take this from you"" Looks at me: ""lets go.""
Manager: ""No sir eat your food and I'll make you a wrap."" *again said condescendingly and tries to stop from leaving and direct us back to our table. 

We moves away from him and I told him to fuck off. We walked out without eating. I would suggest never eating here. There are better places in Las Vegas than to waste your money on overpriced food and be treated like a dog because you asked a question about your order.",KF68fNvc5W85VUwFJbVXjw,6,2,1,at1Fp3Hfo2TEsENhle6oOA

 Whoever in the world was working cashier the day (I think it was the owner) when I came in was complete incompetent, rude, and I'm going to go ahead and say slightly racist. I came in for a convention (asd) and when I came in, the cashier was like ""oh what do you want again?"". I was kind of shocked. Maybe the guy was talking through his bluetooth or something. No. This guy says that I go there like every day and some other comments were said which I don't remember. I guess all Mexicans look alike or something. This guy is completely crazy, so I didn't say anything. I still ordered and even tipped the place on their mediocre food.

Yeah. To top it off, this place has mediocre food. I'd forgive the rudeness, racism if atleast the food was great or even cheap. No. This place is overpriced and it's not worth it. There's not enough meat/substance and too much onion on their items. Nothing horrible, nothing special, just tolerable food.

 It tastes like how I would imagine prison food tastes like. I would never eat at this place ever again even if I was paid. If the owner is reading this, I sincerely hope your place goes out of business.

The first time wasn't all that horrendous. We were told to sit anywhere so we picked one corner of the restaurant to sit at. Not even 3 minutes into us sitting we get a wait staff come to us and tell us to move. They said they got a big party coming so they were going to move the tables together. Though I was not happy we got up and were moved to a table the staff told us to sit at. THEN.... 5 mins into us sitting there. They make us move AGAIN! And tell us to sit on the opposite side because they needed more room. My husband was really mad and was about to leave but we couldn't because we had already paid for our food and it was about to come. Little did we know this exact situation happened to an African American group of ppl. We got moved 3 times they unfortunately got moved 5 times and with that the staff was laughing at them. 
Our food came in. It was okay. We ate and left.
This second round comes in. I wasn't eager to go but we were passing by and saw this restaurant was completely empty. So we thought we would give it a shot. Little did we know again we would come across the same situation 
This time we had a big party of ppl with us. The wait staff tells us to pick a seat and sit there. We go pick the big table they have. We get comfortable and sit. 
He then comes back and says you can't sit here, and makes us get up and moves us to a much smaller table. He quoted by saying ""this is a reserved table."" 
I didn't see any reserved sign on the table plus he told us to pick anywhere to sit. 
Once that was done we go and sit where he told us to sit and ordered our food. Our food comes, that table gets a reserved sign on it AND GUESS WHO WE SEE SITTING AND EATING AT THAT TABLE? 
A gentleman came in alone and was sitting on a ""14 person table"" mind you we were 8. 
Never again am I making this mistake again. The food this time around was terrible. We didn't eat any of it. It was all left there. Rubber chicken. Looked like it was microwaved 10 times. The naan was thick and uncooked all the way.

Rice doesn't come with the meal (we ordered chicken tiki masala). It's $4 extra because it's superior Indian rice. ""We import our rice straight from India!"" Mayyybe........

We asked for water with our meal. ""You don't want to be drinking tap water in Vegas. You'll get sick. You want a drink? Pepsi?"" Says the guy serving tea out of a tea dispenser. 

Service was bad enough during ordering that it ruined our appetite. As we were leaving he offers free water. Could that not have happened the first time we asked for water? And trying to gyp us on the rice...

If you don't know how to cook Pakistani food then shut your business down and go back to Pakistan , I can't see to dis owner my country this bad !
I order goat Karahi , the thing I receive is not even close to goat curry , feel like the person just put water and meat together and mix with too much salt and spices and sent to me !
Sorry for my language but when you are hungry for whole day and get food like this ? 
Well just want to say , Pakistan is already in pretty bad image so don't let Pakistan down more and more , teach the cook how to cook ,
Whole USA know how Indian food is! But if they don't know they can google and find out and they are not that much dumb if you think they are !

1694604,2016-12-06,2,EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg,"Few things are more disappointing than arriving home with your takeout, only to realize the most expensive item you bought isn't in the bag. Let's call this place Kabob N Less. 

I wish I had read the reviews before and looked at the spread; it's an inverted bell curve, and that should tell you everything you need to know. Who writes all those inflated 5-stars? 

So, you go in, you chat it up about dal and naan and chicken tikka, pay $18, leave a nice tip, and realize once home that you have:

- a fine garlic naan
- 4 or 5 CUPS of rice. Who eats this much rice? 
- a container of dal

But, no chicken kabob. $18 essentially for RICE, and some lentils. I shouldn't write this while angry, but man, this was not a complicated order. I was the only one there! Three people were up front working, overseeing, and engaging with me. 4, if you count the cook in the back. At one point the owner/manager asked me in what in hindsight appeared to have been mocking disbelief, ""YOU know what DAL is??"" Yes. I dated a Pakistani woman, and I've worked in India. Did those fun facts throw everyone off their game?

4-stars for the taste of what I did receive, but a serious infraction for the negligent rip-off, the disproportionate amount of rice, all of which resulted in an over-priced meal of things not even present. Why is it so difficult to find a respectable South Asian fast-food joint in this town?

Only reason we decided to try this place was because my mom only eats Halal and likes her Pakistani food. And there's a serious lack of Pakistani food around the LV strip. So despite food being terrible, we went there a couple of times since it was across our hotel. In our experience at the restaurant, the only thing that was decent and worth ordering were the naans. The chicken boti dish was worth 12 something dollars for 5 pieces of chicken and plain white rice and was semi decent. The chicken karahi was immensely salty, and chicken tandoori was dry, old, reheated, and tasteless. They always claim to have recently ran out or their items on the menu, so the choices are limited to begin with. 

On our last visit to the restaurant, we placed an order and sat down to eat, we waited for 25 or so minutes only to be reminded by the girl working there that we need to place an order in the front before sitting down. We were famished and now furious to find out that they owner/ manager never took down our order and simply forgot because 'he is busy doing other work'. He was extremely rude, disrespectful to my bf and mom, extremely argumentative for an individual in a service industry, and outright outrageous. He simply kicked us out of the restaurant because while he claimed 'customers are always right', it wasn't his fault. What a nightmare! 

On top of that, place is extremely dirty and not a pleasant place to sit and eat at. 

On the up side, due to the owner's despicable behavior we happened to come across Urban Turban in the same neighborhood. They had impeccable sevice, delicious food, qaint and clean ambiance. I would recommend anyone looking for a delicious desi meal to spend an extra few dollars and try this place. We were all IMPRESSED!",WvBoJhe8P0at4ZoOe2PKZw,6,1,1,xZ7V3jX0F9kQjE77z5mJeQ

If you want to go a little more inexpensive they do have a gyro, fries and small drink special for $8 that isn't on the interior menus. It's on a board outside, but I didn't see it until after I ordered as it was facing the opposite direction that I walked up from.

3321938,2015-08-15,0,EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg,"The last thing I thought walking in here after a busy day of sight-seeing on the strip was that it would be phenomenal! And also, as fair warning, this is the first time I had a gyro so I may not be an expert on the matter. :) The reason we walked in here was because there was a sign advertising pizza outside, but when we walked in the choices were overwhelming! With my girlfriends on a bachelorette party we wanted something pretty filling before a night of clubbing in Vegas, and we each got their Gyro meal with fries and a drink.

First thing to note, their drinks do not come with free refills. The customer service from the owner was great though. Constantly came over to see if we needed anything else. And he initially declined to refill our drinks but then said if we left a review, he would give us all refills... (I would've left a review either way, so this part didn't bother me)

Second thing to note, remember when I said we originally walked in for pizza? Don't get the pizza or or ""american"" food here. Two of the girls we traveled with had the pizza, and hated it. For this Kabob n More loses a star, butitit was also the reason we walked in, so I guess it's a good thing they have it? Oh well, small catch 22.

Now, onto the gyro. It was AWESOME! The bread was great, which was surprising. Soft and fluffy, didn't taste stale or like it had been sitting out at all. The sauce, was incredible! Once again, my first gyro so it was surprising how good it was. The lamb/beef was cooked to perfection and not chewy but a perfect mix with the bread, sauce, lettuce and tomatoes. All the ingredients really meshed very well together.

Also, the fries! This is another reason I was surprised the pizza was terrible since the fries were fresh, thick, and delicious. Totally addicting since we were all eating them off each other's plates.

At the end of the day, a great CHEAP lunch or before dinner snack. Just remember, don't get the pizza. I only tried the gyro, but if I had time, I would've definitely done back to sample some other meals on their menu!",2hTp0sjO9ugflayPIUut3A,1,0,4,IB9hvNHjPwGMNv1NimxQCA

When they brought out our food to the table, we were surprised to see the paper plates and plastic utensils. Customer service was fine, but the food was mediocre at best. These types of dishes are not meant to be served fast food style and the quality and the taste of the food suffered greatly because of it. Haleem tasted like lentil soup, Chicken Tikka Masala tasted as if it was just reheated, and the Bihari Kabob (beef dish) wasn't cooked all the way through.

I admit I was a little hesitant and it didn't look to be in the greatest section of town, down on the strip Toward Circus Circus.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see the menu, literally something for everyone which was difficult with our party. They were for children ranging in age from 5 to 13, and for adults. The menu accommodated everyone with two of the kids getting standard American fare of a hamburger the other one got chicken fingers and french fries. Both of those meals were excellent by the way not cheap frozen nuggets, and the burger was made very nicely with condiments as well as lettuce and tomato, it was very juicy and my son loved it. I was so happy to see Indian food that I love, I got the paneer tikka  masala, along with a side of yogurt and garlic Nan bread. It was very good, not too spicy but plenty of flavor. Or friends each got Biryani rice dishes. My husband got a gyro, he loved it. It's a small place, you go in order your food, pay for it and then sit in the dining room and they will bring it to you when it's ready. The staff was excellent and very accommodating and patient with us and all of our questions. With all the options of places to eat in Vegas I would definitely make another trip to this restaurant because it was delicious, affordable and the choices were many. They also had everything from pizza, to Middle Eastern and Indian foods.

It was just an okay experience. I ordered the chicken seekh kabob dinner plate and the Mister ordered the beef seekh kabob plate. Both were made pretty much the same way and looked like crumbly meat sausages - I guess that's what they're supposed to look like? The beef seekh was good, but the chicken was kind of dry. The rice was flavorful and very loose, not stuck together like some other places. The salad had zero flavoring because there was no dressing, so I ate the cucumbers, but that was it. Stuffing the chicken seekh and rice in the naan bread and adding some of the green sauce made it taste much better, but spicier. I only finished most of one kabob, the second I took with us to go. The Mister also ordered hummus. Is Indian hummus that much different than Mediterranean hummus? The Mister usually LOVES hummus, but this one was very watery, almost like a thin sauce rather than a dip. He left the majority of it on the table, which is unheard of for him! Overall, glad we tried it, but don't think we'll be returning. It's unfortunate that we didn't like the food much because the staff was very friendly and inviting.

4217476,2013-09-22,0,EfAqol3tWckyNrBMIooJmg,"Kabob N More is a casual restaurant that serves fresh, made to order Indian and Pakastani food for reasonable prices (meals starting at $6.99). The meat is halal for those that have dietary restrictions.  One of the owners told me the restaurant has only been open 4mos.

I ordered a very tasty Chana ki Daal, which is a vegetarian curry stew made with garbanzo-like beans.  I ordered it with rice and naan and it also came with a small salad and raita (yogurt sauce).  The serving was huge and could've fed two people.  The salad didn't have much dressing or lemon juice so I just added the raita to it and that did the trick.

Overall, I was really happy to have found this place.  I was also happy to see they had a sink in the eating area to wash your hands.  It must seem weird to some but I often hate having to go to a dirty restroom to wash my hands, especially for food that is usually eaten with your hands.  And, just to be complete, here are a couple of downsides of this place:
1) there was a TV or stereo in each room that was playing it's own music, so that was a bit distracting
2) the interior looked a bit plain and unfinished in the decor but the place is still new so I imagine this is only temporary
3) the food is served on styrofoam, it would be nice if they used something more earth-friendly",sLiKsfe-DjwysQEIsvjKIQ,1,0,4,1Mh8RFhINCcjmxhCaqKQNg

Oh !! by the way, an Indian into Paki restaurant might not be politically correct :( but food wise there is hardly any difference :) .. the meat curries are the same as we do and the tandoor is lighted the same way as well :) ..

That day the need for having a curry with roti (bread) was at its peak, a friend asked me to neglect the likes of famed Indian places and rather move along with him to the far side of the strip where there was this old school restaurant which was serving some really good food.
Asked me to ignore the ambiance and sittings but focus just on the food.

So, we walked .. past venetian, wynn and reached at the place which surely was quite quiet but the owner was loud as a lady :) ..
Felt like home with the chaos in the kitchen and to see things going in a hurry .. restlessness and all.
Ordered a few things .. mutton (goat) biryani, chicken korma, naans and raita .. tea was complementary :) .. 

Let me describe the things right then -
the goat biryani was aromatic and the rice was separated nt mushy .. a bit more meat in there would have made it perfect but pairing it with the raita .. I did not have any complaints :)
the chicken korma - or in layman let us say chicken curry. It was rich and mildly spiced .. the naans were fabulous. They were soft and fluffy due to yeast in them (often called khamiri roti .. khamir = yeast)
And then the tea (chai) to end it all .. perfect way to finish the absolutely wonderful meal we had.

And the friends enjoyed it so much that not only did they recommend the restaurant but they also visited it the next day .. on repeat order .. :P .. crazy people.

All in all, given the likes of famous Indian joints .. this small Pakistani restaurant has got its own market and own share of fans .. and they are satisfied feeding them :) ..

Tacos El Gordo is practically right next door, but I would still be inclined to come back to this place to try some of their Pakistani food, which is what it seems like they specialize in.",JN-F23BIngBKd9MSaXoI8w,1,0,3,HXVNbhheZnrXlGBsDl6c7Q

If you are from India( owner is from Pakistan) then he will make sure he will talk more. He will ask where you born , once you tell your city name then  somehow he will make his connection to your city. He would tell you his uncle lives in that city and he knows many people there. Then he will start talking about the indian politics Modi, RSS etc.

The chatni was superb. The Orange one was a little sweet and had a melted buttery texture. The green chatni had the spice I was looking for. I practically drank it after I was done with my meal.

Worse decision made. I was tempted by the ""GYO"" sign and thought this was ran by Greek people but apparently its a Pakistani restaurant. 

I was the first to order my meal. I ordered the GYRO and Fries meal listed for $9.99 without tax and my girl friends ordered after me. They got a basmati rice meal. We sit down in a booth section they have and the lady hands my friends their food first and I am still waiting on my sandwich. They took SO long to deliver my food and the GYRO had burnt sections. So disappointing. The lady came out and told me she would give me a complimentary soda for the inconvenience. I'm over here thinking? A soda is not going to fix the HARD fries and burnt flat bread I am eating. She said she will bring out more fries which she did and they were BETTER. But the sandwich was not good. It was a WASTE of money coming here. I should have went to the Taco place that sold BOMB tacos for $2.25 a piece! I had one because my friend went there and it was AMAZING!

Management: thumbs down
Food: thumbs down

From reading all the reviews, it's apparent that mostly everyone has had terrible service from the rude owner/manager. Who carries themselves so unprofessionally when you're in the restaurant business? Oh well the reviews speak for themselves.

The cashier dude who was the manager or the owner was really impatient cause we were deciding what to eat. Jesus this is our first time in your restaurant and you're telling us to hurry up and order when there's no one inside LOL!

Rice was old! And the man didn't want to give us water because he said Vegas water would get us sick but I think he was just trying run up the tab on us with a measly 2 dollars! Lol talk about desperation! 

Meat is dry and not very tasty. 

Honestly I've had better.

Better off eating at the Denny's down the street",QgFILBDMif6NEFbf4Nx91A,3,0,1,iCgR-xsg6WW_iXh57jOcow

We ordered the chicken karahi, Chana Daal and Chicken boti kabab and it was delicious. We reached there around 1:30 am just before their closing time but the hospitality and food was top class. Would definitely  recommend this place. We came multiple times during our Vegas trip and everything we tried was delicious.",vCQ_xYoXTMxKD4UVhYQ9rA,0,0,5,3Uuh7AgmJggcS-tWQw2FPA

The spiciness was just right- not too hot. The food tasted real fresh and the beef was amazing. Would definitely recommend if you're in Las Vegas- best kebab joint in town!!!,mHLzE6Um7ykOV_rgsfihOQ,0,0,5,hap0zUjZRU9rUwUI0pizrg

Small but tasty food. Made to order.
You may want to have some less oil in the food.
Good service from Sanjana.
