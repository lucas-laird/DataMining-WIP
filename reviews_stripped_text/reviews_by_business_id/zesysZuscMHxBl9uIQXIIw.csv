Service: Terrible! We got there at 9pm and  their hours showed that they closed at 10pm. This didn't matter to the staff-who locked the doors at 9:07, put the salsa trays away and pretty much closed shop around us by 9:20. 

Food: Not that great. I love al pastor fries and will try them first at any taqueria. But these were  bottom of the barrel fries to say the least. Sour cream was slightly curdled, avocado tasted at least 1 day old, fries were drenched in grease and the meat was dry and somewhat crispy!

Overall: I'm pretty sure inside the restaurant was hotter than it was outside! (102F today)
I will never go back and I would advise anyone else the same!",ISu4R8dF6WjKVaz9TsI0iw,0,0,1,T-JoszEmKhmrI18AUCvW9Q

They put beans on top of the carne asada tacos which I'm not used to, but enjoyed. Salsa bar and pickled vegetables like Robertto's or any other taco shop.",5Q3J19sYxOMqXtQklNo50g,0,0,4,rztWOQyLN03rgav8kz0lEg

I first experienced their food at the new westside location in the Savers/99 Cent Store plaza at Cheyenne and Rancho, and I was impressed. If you get a chance to check them out today or tomorrow (September 28-29), you can score grand opening specials of $0.75 tacos (any meat) or $3 for four tacos and a fountain drink! You could pay almost $3 for a single taco at Tacos El Gordo or Los Tacos. If you're reading this after September 29, the tacos cost $1.25.

The interior of the restaurant looks nice and clean. I took my food to go, but dining in is a good option so you can make return trips to the salsa bar. There was a mountain of really tasty grilled onions and jalapenos, four salsas, and a few other options. The woman at the cash register was very friendly and spoke perfect English. I ordered super nachos without meat for myself and a $3 taco plate for my husband. Meat options include al pastor (roasting on a spit in the kitchen), barbacoa (a house specialty), carne asada, chicken, lengua, cabeza, and chorizo. They double up the very small corn tortillas, but they don't skimp on the meat portions. He really enjoyed his tacos, and my nachos were great. The tortilla chips came topped with shredded cheese, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and lots of pinto beans (refried also available). The pico and guacamole were lacking citrus flavor, but some lime wedges from the salsa bar could fix that. Cherry Fanta is a fountain drink option, which reminds me of drinking Shirley Temples. Best of all, our tab was only $8.36!

There's a lot more on the menu to try, so we'll be back for huaraches, crispy potato tacos, aguas frescas, and chile relleno burritos. El Tizon is open from 9am-9:30pm Monday-Thursday and 9am-10pm Friday-Sunday.",PSI7wvuqEhhV9Jh_fP2eZQ,5,4,4,tLdSVDam4YSotWue2vv5aw

3167899,2014-01-28,3,zesysZuscMHxBl9uIQXIIw,"We live up on the Northwest part of town and basically have no options for ""street"" style tacos. Even though Taqueria El Tizon isn't really NW, I wouldn't say driving here from any part of town would be worth it. Like others have mentioned, they do have good pricing but that's where the good stops. 

My son and I ordered 7 tacos to share, 5 of them were al pastor. This was easily the driest meat I've ever gotten at a taco shop. I could have dealt with the dryness if it at least had some flavor. It was lacking flavor completely and the fixings didn't help in any way. Neither the onion or cilanto were fresh and the pineapple was definitely sitting out for a long time.

For the other tacos, we went with carne asada which seemed to get okay reviews and that's exactly what they are...okay. The meat was nowhere near as dry as the al pastor but still basically flavorless. They also top them with beans, onions and cilantro. Just like the other tacos, the fixings were far from fresh and the beans were just about as dry as the meat. 

I was close to giving this two stars because of the carne asada but the service was terrible and this restaurant is friggin nasty. There's trash all over the floor, the salsa bar was a disaster and none of the tables were clean. Then to top it off, when the cashier/waitress brought out our food, she dropped a whole piece of my wifes quesadilla on the dirty table then just left it there. Accidents happen, no biggie. But to just leave it on the table is stupid and is exactly why the restaurant is so dirty. She just didn't care...and I don't care to ever come back!",QqRSNjWhfUFv1ZU0OnYKZQ,3,3,1,R4k4D7affrigDcJHzgcTVw
5140168,2013-09-30,1,zesysZuscMHxBl9uIQXIIw,"I know this is gonna sound a bit HARSH, especially considering the LOW prices here.

I only tried the tacos.  They have A LOT on their menu, so maybe they specialize in that OTHER stuff more than the tacos themselves...

First of all, the tacos and cheap.  Probably some of the cheapest in town at around a buck and a quarter.  They are very small street tacos style, double tortilla.  Just figure how many you usually eat, and add 50% more to get full.  But at the low prices, that's acceptable.

Started off with the Al Pastor....DRY and CRISPY...their rotisserie wasn't spinning, and it was OVERCOOKING the meat!!  I don't believe I've EVER had a dry Al Pastor...there is usually plenty of fat in the marinade, slowly cooking on the spit, and constantly dripping down those juices on the rest of the meat.  Not this one.

Yes, the tacos are small and inexpensive, but they are a little SKIMPY on the pineapple...ONE CHUNK??  Look at the pic to see what I am talking about....I had ONE small piece of pineapple on my entire taco.  At least mince my single tiny piece to make it look like there is more on my taco!

The Asada was better. I thought their Asada was good, but it was also DRY...they probably have it cooked already and let it sit on the stove to keep warm.

They forgot my Chorizo taco I ordered, and when I told the lady that brought out our food, I presumed she was going to bring me one.  Well she never did, so I had to go back up there and requested one.  I presumed I would be put in the front of the list considering I already paid, already had ALL the rest of my food, and I was standing there waiting for my SINGLE taco...but I waited for almost 5min before it came out.  Yeah, for a taco.

Too bad it wasn't worth the wait...the Chorizo was super dry, no fat/grease/oil at all...I don't even think my tortilla turned that beautiful orange hue I love in Chorizo.  Yes, THAT dry.

Why is all the meat dry??  You guys were BUSY today...grand opening weekend!  Shouldn't everything be FRESH right now??  What's it gonna be like 4 months from now, at 8pm and you're the only customer there??
