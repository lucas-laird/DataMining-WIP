Anyways I went for the simple chicken and biscuits, and it tasted just as such, chicken and biscuits, neither special, or terrible, just average, and given the prices, its not worth it at all. The Popeyes I went to regularly in Chicago makes this feel more like a dump then anything else. Customer service wasn't very good either.

For a tiny, tiny, side of watery gravey (seriously thicken it up cheap o's) I wouldn't mind paying Â¢25 even but $1.99 are you kidding me?! If I was told at the window that side of brown water would be that much I would of passed. The icing on the cake is I get back to work and no spoon, napkins, or dipping sauce.

I'm really surprised at most of the Yelp Reviews. I expected more stars, but maybe there's a tough crowd. 

I frequent this facility on Tuesdays due to our schedule and the specials. I purchase an 8-piece chicken mixed and 8 chicken strips. I usually get in the drive-thru line to expect a 15-20 min wait, so expect that. You would think that they're gonna constantly make chicken so it would be ready-to-go, so I decided to order inside to paint a picture on my head. 

So imagine waiting in the drive thru-there's 5 cars ahead of you. At the same time, there's a line of 8 waiting to order and several couples and singles standing around waiting for their order. There's like 7 employees working and busting their butt, but the amount of chicken is plentiful in the warmer, but it's only breast pieces. So for everyone ordering the mixed box which contains 1-2 breast pieces and chicken strips, and the variety between spicy vs. not, there's gonna be a wait. For me, I don't mind the wait, I would rather you fully cook the chicken. I don't want no salmonella poisoning. Ain't nobody got time for that! 

I had an issue once in terms of being incorrectly charged, the manager came over amidst the craziness and calmly resolved the issue and refunded me the difference. It was the best resolution I could have asked for in this situation. I'm also happy that like 4 people are ServSafe certified at the manager's level. This makes me feel safe eating there. 

There's always room for improvement so I give 4.5 stars, but I always round up :)",cQzo2WX1TyPEmS5jPzOUoA,2,1,5,xR_bbC1T2UNsjZhd5PgR5A
