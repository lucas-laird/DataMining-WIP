But I was also only craving vegetables and tofu. I had to ask about the tofu and pay extra for it, but it was well worth it in my opinion.

There are 2 distinct parts to this restaurant, the teppanyaki side and the restaurant side.  They really should warn you that if you want teppanyaki, you need to sit at the bar area.  And if you want to be able to hear the person next to you, you should sit as far away from the teppanyaki bar as you possibly can.  While I can appreciate coming and having a great time, the group at the teppanyaki bar was so loud and obnoxious, we couldn't even carry on a conversation with one another.

The food was okay, but for someone who has never been to china and is looking to try something new, the wait staff could not describe the food or how it was prepared (as bad as it sounds, it may have just been a language barrier. The wait staff was authentic and Asian, but we had some difficulty understanding what they were saying).  I ordered the Hong Kong Chow Mein.  In my personal taste, if this is what food tastes like in China, I don't ever want to go there.  The thick sauce was extremely salty, without much other flavor. It did have large pieces of white meat chicken and pork, which would have tasted great if the sauce wasn't so bad.

The price was average, but the food was below average. I am definitely willing to return and try the teppanyaki bar, as the energy and food produced on that side of the restaurant was definitely better than what I received.",dd-m2G6pB5neRXCyluXBXA,0,0,2,z6T_liWhZ3k_bwGOb4Iikw
532828,2012-01-07,0,1qTx9z8RMz7RIYKAfnpZ0A,"I had the pleasure of experiencing dining at Lillie's. My wife and I arrived for our reservation AT 5:30PM. We were seated at our teppanyaki table and promptly greeted by our wait person. He was at our side from the time we arrived to the time we departed. What wonderful service.

The dinner started with a bowl of hot mushroom soup. It was savory and had enough mushrooms to give it a wonderful texture. The next course was a simple salad with a very tasty ginger dressing. My wife said she would go back just to have the salad and dressing. Then the show began.

Our teppanyaki chef came to prepare our spectacular meal. My wife and I had a combination of Shrimp, Chicken, New York Strip Steak, and Fillet Mignon. Along with the main dishes came three delicious sauces as well as fresh grilled vegetables and steamed white rice. One sauce was a spicy mustard that went with the steak and chicken. Then was a seafood sauce and a spicy sauce that went with the red meat. All three sauces really awakened the taste buds. I really enjoyed the combination of the chicken and the spicy mustard sauce. What a taste treat. The taste was similar to Dijon mustard, but it did not assault the sinuses. My wife thought the combination of spicy sauce and white rice was enjoyable. Everything was prepared just as we asked for and the meats were oh so tender.

Our chef was a real joy. His jokes were very funny. His teppanyaki skills were well mastered. From the onion volcano to the flare in his knife skills my wife and I enjoyed the show. We have been to many teppanyaki restaurants through the years, but this has to be the best we have even been to.

The only reason my review does not get five stars is because of the price. The pricing is a bit high. Luckily we had a coupon when we went.",I8_iXLcpYHAb_xi2vShgOg,0,0,4,nhVbqzAmw_HPVex3BjI8WA

First of all it was actually spicy enough for me! I ordered it extra spicy and may have gotten in over my head...Even made me sweat a little. And every piece of chicken was cleaned well and cooked to perfection. No grizzle or battered dough messing it up.  The taste was wonderful.  The pad thai my wife ordered was excellent as well!

We stopped here for dinner before getting our alcohol beverages. The restaurant looked nice and seemed busy so we figured we give it a try. We ordered the following to share;

 appetizer: crab ragoon / crab wonton. -- definitely did not taste the best nor did it taste like crab ragoon / crab wonton... Panda express has better cream cheese ragoon. We barely touched it, so the manager took it off our tab.

Entree #1: Chicken Pad Thai - flavorless. It had no taste, plain. Seemed like they cooked their noodles, threw it into the wok and added some sauce to it. The sauce did not stick to the noodles, the sauce sat at the bottom of the bowl.

Entree #2: Pork fried Rice - it was decent, but flavorless as well. We picked at it. How do you screw up pork fried rice??

Entree #3: Honey Glazed Shrimp - I think its supposed to taste like Honey Walnut Shrimp... It was OK. Not the best, just OK.

Two chefs deal on food for customers against grills in such radiance where meat has gently been cooked until noise of steaming and perfection is heard throughout Lillie's Asian Cuisine.  Vegetables are combined from time to time when there's natural flavor between warm metal grills and echoes of the hissing mass either chef uses to impress witnesses of teppanyaki near counters under so much glow, presentation, and a healthy fusion of Chinese and Japanese influence at the little joint in the Golden Nugget where general exotic forms are pleasing to my favor on their cost and performance.  The door is shut after the stroke of twelve when it's important for the restaurant to leave its fortune on glowing red decorations and frames with an Asian style to defense and overall train of midnight across from the business desk close to Starbucks.  Meals are provided in style, complete detail, and good dishes which show true colors over beauty.  Spring and training are ahead for the creative kitchen with the promise of yearly fortune and privilege.  Human touch around the restaurant where drinkers of water and laughter gather by those glowing bars may serve as a reminder that the forms of things outside the joint and across from insiders get less static, less rigid because of the Asian kitchen's harmony or dramatic output of life.  I try to make sense of the environment before mileage leaves all casual mood in this soul of mine as high as LV's city lights (which are fantastic to the point of recognition).  Jellyfish noodles at Lillie's have been exaggerated on with my server in dinner talk yet make for an excellent, cold dessert before me and a couple of fellow tourists from our bus dig into a Cantonese noodle's foundation of egg, heat, and strings of texture.  Soy sauce drips if not pours in elegance over choice dishes through prominence we take near firm pictures hanging on the grey or black wall every one of us possess as eye candy although they're a great mythological influence for Fremont, 4th, and the Golden Nugget.  Wine shall be redeemed excellent under the lit and shadowy roof.  What's common for one patron in the restaurant might be a rare opportunity for some drifter around the corner ever after.  Chances are the perfect match among friends will remind such guys of ramen noodles with even more specialty involved while hotel guests sneak a peak through the hole in the wall to find marvelous food being enjoyed over wanderlust or actual spirits of demand.  On my radar, the restaurant's or kitchen's list is full of Asian wonders by all means through professional execution, busy crowds, lovely decorations, and dishes which take Lillie's risks of business to a whole new level of appetite- wine more costly than a noodle, brisk sips of water near teppanyaki at its cooking of a nice whiff.",XY8rBO1N8Fcc-ZI1tJwRNQ,0,0,5,XYUlhcw-3gRWrdffsgcGag

The food was overpriced (this is downtown, not the Strip).  This would have been fine with us, but the quality was not good.  The Hot N Sour soup had a syrupy taste to it.  I asked for my Cashew Chicken dish to be very spicy, and it had no spice at all.

For starters, I had their marinated jelly fish with sesame oil, chilis, and some thinly sliced pickled vegetables.  The sauce made with the oil and chilis gave the jelly fish a very good taste.  This was the first time I had jelly fish and I found it good.  Chewy and not too flavorful in itself.  It needs a good dressing, like pasta, to give it some flavor.

For the main course, I got the curry chicken clay pot.  The dish was listed as spicy and it was.  When brought to the table, my server cautioned me not to touch the bowl as it was very hot.  When he removed the lid of the pot, the dish was bubbling from the high temperature.  I let it cool for a minute or so.  The thing that caught my eye on the menu was the chicken was in a coconut curry sauce and it had pineapple as well as mushrooms and some normal vegetables in Chinese food.  The pieces of pineapple went well with the heat of the curry.  The portion was large enough it could be split by two.  I wasn't going home after dinner or I would have taken some home in a take out container.

My server suggested three items from the menu and I ended up with the lemon yuzu cake.  It was quite good and a nice finish to the meal.

Service was excellent.  Iced tea was refilled often and for each course the server and the manager came by to check and make sure everything was OK.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,10,9,4,_AyusXLPon0w7_IOAzKARg

Lillie's offers a Hibachi Grill and that was probably what we should've done, but none of us were incredibly hungry, so we instead opted for the regular menu.

We started with an order of the Spring Rolls (""Crisp Vegetable Spring Rolls, Plum Sauce""). These were quite edible and the plum sauce was good, although there was nothing about the dish that screamed out deliciousness (ie they tasted pretty generic).

My appetite was especially minimal, so I decided to forego the mains and instead ordered an appetizer as my meal. I went with the Beef Lettuce Wraps (""Romaine Lettuce Leaves, Minced Beef, Peanuts, Scallions, Crunchy Rice Noodles"").

I'll preface this by saying I misread the item and was expecting something closer to a salad roll, but that's on me. What I got was a decent yet completely unspectacular lettuce wrap. The filling was all perfectly fine although completely tasteless, with the Minced Beef seemingly cooked without any spices or even salt.

Unfortunately while Lillie's menu spans different Asian cuisine, it barely provides a sufficient representation of each.  For menu selection, two stars. After being deprived of ramen/saimin for over a week on a cruise ship, I was craving hot Asian noodle soup. The only offering on their menu was the Cantonese Won Ton Noodle Soup for $15. They also had  a large cup of Won Ton Soup for $8 and a large bowl of Wor Won Ton for $11 but neither of these selections were offered with noodles with is standard at most Chinese restaurants; hence the below average rating.

The addition to my noodle soup I ordered Crab Rangoon which was the worse I have ever eaten. Although I didn't care for the taste of the pork won tons, I thought the soup was tasty and noodles were good. For food taste, three stars.

In terms of value, I would consider the food over priced. Maybe the intent of the pricing is to reflect Lillie's as an upscaled Asian restaurant, but clearly that could not be the case with the cheap chopsticks they offer. In addition, you can get much better value for your money at other nearby Las Vegas establishments. So for value, one star.",mbl4wi6-RV2WOHpNDMQCPA,0,0,2,AiUid5FdXayHCiptt5yJ3A

The second thing you need to know is that they charge almost $4 for fried rice.  Not a huge dish of fried rice, a little bowl of fried rice.  Most other teppan yaki placed in town include it!  Well at least the good ones do.  The shrimp was not very good and the filet wasn't cooked well.  I ordered medium and it came out medium rare, and it wasn't really seared, more steamed.  You know how steamed steak tastes?  Well that was it.  The chicken was pretty good, but maybe on the dry side.  The ginger sauce was probably the best of all of the components.  Seriously, forego this place and try a local one instead.  For my money, Geisha on Sandhill and DI is far superior.  They give you fried rice as well as soup, salad, and an appetizer, I usually get the shrimp and vegetable tempura, and your choice of soda or small sake if you order the Geisha Special, and it's either $35.95 or 37.95.  The Geisha Special includes a shrimp appetizer, usually three pieces and then chicken, steak, and lobster.

At Lillie's, I got the special, can't remember the name, and it came with chicken, shrimp, and filet, it's a choose three situation, or you can get lobster and two others.  If you want really good teppan yaki and really want good value for your money, Geisha at DI and Sandhill is the way to go!

Come to think of it, the 2 stars here might be a bit generous.

The waitstaff was not that attentive, drinks ran empty a few times, they crowded us in at the table by maybe an extra person or two, they let people smoke e-digs, so for you, maybe that's a plus, but that shit stinks.

Went there on the Sunday of Memorial Day weekend. After walking around Fremont Street and the crowd at the Punk Rock Bowling festival, we decided to get a bite to eat at Lillies at the Nugget. Nothing special. My first job as a kid was at Benihana, and if you've seen one hibachi grill, you've seen them all. This one was no exception. A bit on the boring side. At least the food tasted fresh. We had the chicken and shrimp entree. Pretty standard - soup, salad, rice, grilled vegetables. At least the chef (King Kong), was entertaining enough, and had a bit of a personality. I felt sorry for the people who were sitting across from us. Their chef got in and out as fast as he could. I don't remember if he made an attempt to entertain the diners. Service was so-so. The waitress seemed a little tired. Perhaps, I'll give Lillies another shot sometime in the future, since their regular menu sounds somewhat interesting. 

Note to self: NO MORE HIBACHI!!!",4Zqh0-Db39qpGEHCIll9hw,1,1,3,8HSlWbi7Zy03mR8A1U2YoQ

I found the servers to be appropriately enthusiastic, something that is a staple at most teppanyaki joints.  Each time, I get a mixed dinner which contains some combination of steak, chicken, lobster, shrimp.  I find at Lillie's the chefs are more skilled at cooking the steak to the requested temperature.  Also, my shrimp/lobster has never been tough or overcooked.  

The service is quick, I never went wanting for another beer, but the service does not take away from the action.  You get quite a meal for the price, if you are downtown I highly recommend it if you are looking for a different dining experience.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,1,0,4,N4aOvwSdigNP545jABsQNQ

The service was mostly good, although I had to track down my waiter for a copy of my bill before I left. The food, however, was so-so. I had the chicken satay which was very boring. It was described as ""spicy."" I am a wimp when it comes to spice, and this was NOT spicy. It was served over a slice of honeydew melon. Hmmm....odd. The dessert was the best part. I ordered the chocolate macadamia nut torte. It was a very rich dessert, so I didn't finish it. But this was not because I didn't like it; it was just a lot ot eat and very richly flavored.

Overall, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you are looking for the ordinary and expected at an affordable price.",Y24cfzGWxrmSXvRdtCvEEw,0,0,2,lspihVwxZ6XrfJEYK2V7eQ

This is some pretty gross Asian cuisine and the cost is quite high for this type of quality. I'm not sure if people enjoy the hibachi - but this place was not tasty at all. I would compare it to most American Chinese fast food joints around town priced under $10 a plate.

We had -

Crab Special Roll - it was too sweet and I only ate one piece - so did the boyfriend. Pretty sure it was imitation crab.
Lillie's Special Stir Fry - Special my ass. It was so starchy, bland and just flat out disgusting. 
X.O. Prawns - the shrimp tasted like it was not fresh, tasted bagged and very very fishy tasting. Like it had been chillin in a tank of water after defrosting for a day or two. It was very chewy as well. 

I'm not sure what is going on in this place. It was $70+ without tip. The service was good and prompt. The restaurant itself was nice, but the main focus has got to be turned toward the food. We were so hungry, we ate it anyways. But no more. I'm gagging just thinking about how yucky it was.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,3,3,2,Dq4FnECMvhhUprT8upSEMQ

But the hostess said they were all reserved and the three of us would have to wait 40 mins. I am sorry but you are not even a three star restaurant so please don't be such a snob and turn your customers and hotel guests away, when half your restaurant is empty on a Sunday night. I'm sure half of those reservations won't even show up. And just by looking at your menu, I can tell it's not even decent chinese food.

I ordered the crab fried rice dinner and they gave me about 10lbs of fried rice with 2 really skinny and small crab strips that tasted like fake frozen crab.  We asked the waiter about this and he said that what the meal consisted of, yuck!  The decor is high class and looks like a very nice, fancy and expensive restaurant but the food does not step up to the plate.  To make matters worse they over charged us on our credit cards so we called back and they said they had taken money to tip themselves! As if!!! We actually did tip these guys since we figured the food preparation was not their fault!  In the end, the manager said he would refund us the tip that they had taken out in a few days!  I'd say skip this place and go to Panda Express!!!",xFTwjBMXHJwp8MSTUD-rlQ,3,0,1,dttNqyrkG_UkxMWSKlm8IQ

Congratulations Lillie's, you are the proud receiver of my first-ever one-star review.

On our way up to the room after hanging out by the pool all day, we made reservations for dinner at 7:30pm on a Saturday night. The lady explained that the only reservations they took were for the hibachi/tepan grills and not the dining room, which was find because we wanted the grills anyway. My brother asked, ""So can we get a reservation?"" To which the lady replies, ""Dining room or hibachi?"" Hello!!! What did you just say?!?! Idiot.

We catch a quick nap and shower before heading back for dinner. W arrive at 7:34pm. I tell the lady (different lady this time) my name and our reservation time. She then proceeds to tell me that she'd given our reservation away because they only hold reservations for five minutes. I pull out my cell phone and it says 7:35pm. I tell her this and she goes through her spiel again. I ask why they would give away a reservation after waiting a mere five minutes and she claims it's policy (it's bullshit is what it is, you should be ashamed). I then ask if we can get a seat at one of the remaining tables since there was an open spot and no one waiting. She says no and mumbles something about the dining room. I ask, ""Excuse me?"" and she tells me that there's nothing she can do. I then ask her, ""Nothing you can do or will do?"" As she stands there, stunned and searching for a reply, my friend walks up and lays into her. The lady says, ""Well I called your room like five times and no one picked up."" My friend replies, ""Either you called as we left the room to come down to dinner or you didn't call at all. Which room were you calling?"" She rattles off ""1011"", to which my friend replies, ""You were calling the wrong room. We're 10111, the hotel doesn't have a 1011."" If you work in a hotel, shouldn't you have a vague knowledge of the room numbers? My friend is now fed up, ""Fine. We're going some place else. Thank for nothing."" Not a reply from the lady.

This place is ridiculous! First you give away a reservation after five measly minutes of waiting for us and then you won't do a damn thing to remedy the situation? No apology at all? I've never been so appalled by customer service in my life. Never have I been treated so poorly. Never has a restaurant had such disregard for its customers or any form of customer service.",o_dPk6REa-SPz0RD4J04Zw,5,1,1,Cr4TS9FRrCGwVeOHGlGFvQ

We sat at a table with some other people who had no interest in talking to us so we just talked amongst ourselves and enjoyed our food.

The cocktail menu was limited but there is a nice selection of beer and wine. Next time we would like to try the sushi.",ae5oYsZ1rHiHt3ltnLwuXA,1,0,4,eu5OgQrTXDwjGU2nVr4IFQ

The third time I thought it was a fluke that it wasn't good so decided to try it one more time. Still bad so I won't be returning. The food had no flavor and the two waiters we had acted like we were inconvenicencing them. There are plenty of other restaurants in Vegas that taste better and the people are happy to serve you. Don't waste your time or money on this place!!!,eofvBh9CcIa502ObmFVrfg,0,0,1,FqRyQ4kGtJXZ6sSKRhvqDg
