The horchata is a little too sweet for me, but still drinkable. Service is speedy and you'll see a lot of customers hanging out. The neighborhood looks sketchy, but there are two police command stations within a half mile which keeps the order. The homeless along the boulevard do not disrupt the business.  Also, the taco stand is right off of the Cultural Corridor by the Cashman Center which means that you are close to everything (e.g. freeway, downtown, the Strip, Fremont Experience and North Las Vegas casinos).  I only wish they had somewhere to sit momentarily.",5GPJYhFS9h71eb2Ow7Gj5w,2,0,5,Gv_QchRRuHO2eLDJ4XeW3w

Came here with my brother to try the Al Pastor tacos he loves from them so much. We tried going to their food truck location but they were closed for an extended cleaning so we were directed here. Sadly, all they had available was pork... We both enjoy pork so we pulled the trigger. I enjoyed the service and feel of the place. I would like to try their other menu items.",snGMkVwMG6mq12R90qmqOg,1,0,4,eYJ5ciVZCHP981KMhSr6Mg

Oh by the way we went to the new location at 675 A Mall Ring Circle Henderson area by the galleria mall FYI.

We order torta and they are huge can't finish it and my husband got wet burrito my kids got burritos and chicken fingers they are good food.  4 star only because we have to drive back to get my torta they forgot it but rather than that everything is good.",7dwgGBhpJ8-qXeAfD24QnQ,0,0,4,mtHSGXCvpIxYkLMhtqCTJA

We headed out early from stop #2 because it smelled like natural gas - plus we wanted to get to stop #3 first. We show up and nobody from Yelp was there so we ordered. Lengua and cabeza for me, pastor for Justin. When I saw the menu, I thought it was going to be the exact same as the second stop, as the prices were the same. Meh! 

Fortunately, despite the prices, the food was hands down the best of the night - which is saying something. After eating 3 street tacos, I'd say having two more should have made me think ""ugh, just okay"" but these were noticibly tastier. I felt like I was going to explode because I was so full, but they were declicious. While there, I ended up buying a flower pen from a girl and her family that were trying to raise money. I figure it was a decent dollar well spent. 

Now, back to the UYE - nobody showed up. We were wondering if maybe everyone died in a natural gas explosion back at stop number 2. After being at this place for more than half an hour, we dipped and figured something must have changed. We decided to hit up a party downtown and while driving there, passed a stand full of cars - yep, the 3rd UYE stop. Oh well, our last stop was really good so it's okay.

While they weren't as wonderful as the tacos I've had ocean side in Mexico, these were pretty good for Las Vegas. If the price came down a tad, I'd be a fan.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,0,1,3,iL2sRWKbfEKO9nFPguCNLw
