They made the dough right then and there. They were so good. I would recommend this to everyone. It's a pretty casual place with great taste!

The reviews don't lie - this sandwich must weigh close to two pounds and I couldn't open up my mouth wide enough to take a full bite.  I've got to say it was very tasty, though.  I somehow ate half of the sandwich and immediately went home and napped up.

I asked the waitress if anyone had eaten an entire sandwich.  She said a tall, skinny man ate an entire Torta Cubana and a couple of enchiladas.  Color me skeptical.

A very nice man who I believe to be the owner came out to chat.  He suggested I come back and try some other items on the menu, many of which are Southern Mexican specialties.  Gonna take him up on that!

1559476,2017-02-04,17,2QznyHGF0PuiYkrl5RU66A,"Cue the meat sweats- this place has the biggest torta I've ever seen, stacked with five different meats! The Cubana Mexicana has pork leg, ham, egg, hotdog, breaded steak, Mexican sausage, and cheese. Along with lettuce, tomato, and I'm pretty sure I tasted some avocado in there. This thing literally feeds four, and I barely put a dent in my quarter.

But you probably came here for more typical Mexican eats!
The fish taco ($3.50) and shrimp taco ($4) are both good deals with a good amount of protein, but the batter was thicker than I'd like. Stick to the seafood tacos though, as the carne asada was pretty average.

The ceviches are alright- the price range is a bit different from other places I frequent and my usual $5-8 tostada mixta is $11 here so I have yet to shell out the scratch to see how it compares. The fish is fresh though and the portions are fairly standard.

Menu is huge, with burritos, fajitas, breakfast, and even soups that I haven't yet tried. Even the drink menu has a ridiculous number of options, including beer, wine, smoothies, juices, aguas frescas, and milkshakes. They should have a bingo card for diners to make their way through various sections of the menu, and a wall of fame/shame for anyone who can dominate that massive torta.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,20,4,o95QLR9VxuDx6Xij5tZ2pg

We ordered the largest seafood cocktail they had. $19!! It had 5 shrimp and a nice half of avocado on top but as my husband was fishing for all the stuff I won't eat (octopus and squid) he was greatly disappointed. I had to laugh at the teeny tiny piece of octopus he finally found in this large glass of cocktail. Next, I ordered the empanadas and he ordered the pambazo sandwich. My empanadas came and it was just one on a large plate and it's not what you have ever had before. Basically it was a large fried taco. They served it open and stuffed it full of lettuce. No sides come with it. Just this fried taco. The sandwich my husband ordered was more like a small breakfast sandwich missing an egg. The horchata was pretty delicious tho.

Food was really good! The complimentary salsa was delicious, has a little kick to it which I like, chips were fresh and crunchy. We got the soup which was HUGE, the three of us shared and still had left overs. The soup was so good, so flavorful but not too salty, I was full but kept eating more soup because I did not want to stop. The gigantic cubano was...a lot! Definitely recommend sharing, no one should ever eat that much meat in one sitting :) But flavor wise it was bomb! The combination of meats with the egg and veggies just worked.

So I came in, and chose a table near electricity outlet to charge my phone. Salsa and cheeps came out immediately. And they were the best I've had. Both homemade and super fresh. Then I ordered fish tacos - One breaded and one not (just grilled). People! I'm serious, I'm addicted now! A ate two of them, and I'm so full. I can hardly breathe. But they so worth it.

About the food it's nice homemade Mexican and takes the appropriate amount of time to be cooked to order. They have a huge juicer and make juice drinks fresh to order and they will mix  a variety for you if you ask.
I like to help places like this and give them a shot and my support.
The landlords will do anything to get these people to sign a lease in a dead rundown type center but once they are in they are on their own.

My daughter had the Posale enjoyed it as she said she was full, but kept eating.  I meat was falling off the bone just like it should. 5 stars

4 carne asada tacos for the two little ones.  3 stars

Wife ordered the pork skin Gordita. When it came out, it was not what my wife expected as she thought the skin would have been crunchy, but still tasted great. 4 stars.

A little out of our way, but a definite return for the posole and the Mojarra.  When we left the lady said next time ask for garlic butter to be spread on it.  WTH! Why didnt she mentioned that when I ordered.  Still a nice experience.",u2jYb3GGDT2LuQt08xA6TQ,4,3,4,136oHMGZcdw8U2twlS8SCg

I then called this morning for a to-go order.

I ordered their shredded beef Huaracha, which was one of the best thing I ate in a long time. The beef had a good Smoky taste to it. The Huaracha crispy and full of flavor. I also ordered their gordita with carne asada it was also really good. I ordered their Pambazo I ever had anything like it before. Their fish taco was good the fish was beer battered fried. My Wife had ordered the shrimp cocktail my daughter ordered the wet burrito with chicken she said that she would eat that every day if she could.

I spoke to the owner and chef Alberto he explained to me about his style comes from Mexico city and southern Mexico and it's more authentic with better flavor. 

I will be coming back to try their seafood.",WoVbfeVPVrJdPxQbI4HkXQ,3,2,5,oTE97PIZAUw51qKXQRJejQ

5278964,2017-05-13,4,2QznyHGF0PuiYkrl5RU66A,"Recently fortunate enough to have dined at many of Mexico City's best, a chance to visit the coastal noma residency passed up to instead explore restaurants both high-brow and literally 'hole in the wall' that have helped make the Mexican Capital a dining destination for everything from Tripe Tacos and Ant Larvae to Foie Gras and Wagyu Beef, it was with a bit of hesitancy that the decision was made to visit Playa Papagayos Restaurant on Friday afternoon, the experience thankfully proving to be a good one by any standard with gracious service and some truly delicious cuisine.

Open now since November in a shopping plaza at the corner of Decatur and Sahara, not exactly a culinary 'hot-spot' with the Fantastik Indoor Swapmeet only a few steps away, Playa Papagayo translates literally to Parrot Beach and although nothing about the sizable space tucked beside a Pizza parlor screams tropical, the restaurant is clean and well lit with a lot of seating, a petit Mexican woman greeting diners at the door and offering them a wide range of tables with padded chairs, many of them coated in clear plastic.

Playing traditional Latin American music overhead and Soccer on a pair of Televisions, the clientele sparse but consisting mostly of local businessmen and a few Mexican women who seemed to be doing work as they partook in Salads, large Sandwiches or Soups, it was with water in hand that the sizable menu from Chef Alberto Ocampo was perused, one at the table opting for a $2.50 Aguas Fresca that quickly saw the lone-server turn craftsman, a mix of fresh Fruit, Sugar and bottled Water placed in a Vitamix with the result a creamy concoction that was only slightly sweet and whole lot better than the typical lunchtime Iced Tea or Soda.

Ranging from typical Tacos and Burritos to more esoteric regional specialties from the state of Guerrero, the original home of Chef Ocampo before relocating and opening his first restaurant in Colton California, first-time diners at Playa Papagayo would be well-advised to approach the menu front-to-back with the first two pages focusing on lighter bites such as the Oysters, Shrimp, Fish and Octopus that put the original location on the map, the $6 Camaron Tostada featuring plump little Shrimp with plenty of Citrus amidst the flavor of chopped Onions and Cilantro, the portion quite large for the price-point, especially when accounting for the big slice of fresh Avocado.

Reportedly importing many of the Spices and Meats from the family's home town, a Chicken Mole and housemade Huaraches more than enough reason to return, it was after a short wait spent watching two Chefs work that three plates were brought forth along with two Salsas, one look at the Cubana Mexicana Torta enough to make even the hungriest diner question their capacity, the soft Roll stretched to its limits around five types of Meat, two styles of Cheese plus Vegetables and a light Sauce, the flavor of the Breaded Steak and Pork Sausage most prevalent amongst the mix with the wise only enjoying half, making for essentially two full meals for just eleven bucks.

Not particularly a 'diet-friendly' place, though healthful choices can certainly be made by way of Tuna or Shrimp Salad, Seafood Soup or the raw Shellfish noted above, those taking a more all-in approach are encouraged to next take a look at the regionally famous fork-and-knife Pambazo, a housemade Roll dipped in mild red Sauce and fried in a pan with Potatoes and Pork Sausage, the addition of sliced Lettuce and Fresh Cheese adding just enough levity to keep things fresh, as also was the case with the thick Cornmeal Gordita opened up and stuffed with crispy fried Pig Skin.
 
Unfortunately sold out of the Rice Pudding, but still offering three additional Desserts including a daily Gelatin plus a Fruit Parfait sold in two sizes, those looking for something truly unique would be wise to invest $2.95 in the Flan Napolitano, a small wedge of the Cheese Custard served more like a soft Cake than the traditional creamy pudding, a style not seen to this point and explained by the Chef as 'a family secret' when he later walked around the room asking diners how they had enjoyed their experience.

**** Perhaps even more varied than the numerous styles of cuisine found in China or India it would be difficult to name the perfect 'Mexican' restaurant, but in terms of dollar-for-dollar value in terms of taste, quality and execution one would be hard-pressed to name spot in Las Vegas outperforming Playa Papagayos in terms of its style, the majority of the food probably a little heavy for some but undoubtedly made fresh from good ingredients and with a lot of thought.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,7,7,4,9AbLknF0Ys5w5T80V6lK4w
