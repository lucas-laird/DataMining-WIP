Now - let me warn you - it has absolutely NO atmosphere. It looks like a renovated McDonalds. You go up to the counter and order and sit down at a McD's type table. ""Silverware"" is plastic. Food comes on a plastic tray on a paper plate or paper french fry type holder. 

You don't come here for the atmosphere - you come here for the food!!!! Yes, the location is quite seedy - but it's just one block north of the 95 off Eastern. Excellent prices!!! If you are from west Texas/southern NM it will take you back in a heartbeat!

Their El Paso flautas, which you can choose any kind of meat that they offer on their menu, I get shredded beef, and they soak in red chili sauce with cheese on top. It's by far the best food I've had!!

Next the hrs this place has is ridiculous first the place right on the building says closes at 9pm and thats not the case and second who in there right mind closes up shop on a Wednesday please....as to the staff i have been there a few times and in the visits that i have been i have seen almost all the times are very dirty and how they handle the food prep area makes me think twice and also sometimes as well give kind of a attitude when taking your order. I met the owners before when they just opened up on Durango can't say anything bad about them seem like nice people but unfortunately we always as shop owners have to be at the mercy of good help ..I KNOW THIS FIRST HAND. Just really wish they would change there schedule and get better help food can also use a bit more flavor maybe some salt (just saying).,tZZL7WLN3Db4riiYwkfI9g,0,0,2,LEEzsrR9LHiRkc5fpr8Ysg

The barbacoa, on either a burrito or a taco, will make you miss home. Throw on some cilantro and onions from the salsa bar before you take it to go and try not to cry as you eat: not only is it perfectly soft, it's also full of flavor, unlike other places.

Surprise menu hit: the turkey neck! Ordered it as a torta but my order was received wrong as a ""side"" in a taco, but the cut of meat is still perfectly flavorful and fatty and fried fresh.  Probably best as a torta, will have to order it again.

The people are friendly,  the city is safe, and the food is ridiculous! Chicos Tacos comes to mind when El Paso and food are mentioned. It is said to be one of if not the stop to make when in EP. I am one of this who loves Chicos Tacos so when I was told about this place it was a must try. I went and ordered two singles,  some fries, and an elote en vaso. Let's start off with the elotes, it was a little disappointing to be honest it was nothing like the elotes I've had in EP, it has mayonnaise which is totally different from what I've had and its not that appetizing, its also made with yellow corn. EP elotes has white corn, butter, Chile, and  cheese so I had high expectations and was let down in the elotes department. Although if you want some street corn this is more along that flavor profile and in that sence it is good, just not elotes good. Now on to the tacos, they were........GREAT! I mean you can tell that its not chicos but it is darn close, the spicy tomatoe sauce with the rolled tacos and some green chile sauce is amazing and will hold you over till you get back to EP for some chicos! They are piping hot and will crunch as you eat them and then have a great bite when soaked in the sauce! The fries are great and with ketchup and dipping them into the spicy tomatoe sauce really brings back memories of eating at Chicos. This place is called juarez-el paso border food, so in my opinion if your not from that area or have been there you will not understand the food as it can't be compared to anything else really. If your in the mood for some Mexican food and want something different I say definitely give this place a go next time!",i7K3PDFJzXJSebzCj8UYJw,1,0,5,DQVaifTpYhq-dWIaspoZQQ

Notice I didn't say the employees or the customer service. I had better expectations for border food thus I go to El Paso every year. And as far as I'm concerned the food doesn't get any better. I ordered my favorite barbacoa tacos and carne asada fries, they were not fresh. The barbacoa meat was smelly and dripping in grease. That is not healthy, and the carne asada fries were horrific. The avocado wasn't real, that hurt my feelings even more. And the carne inside the fries was old, the coloration and taste are what lead me to that. I do not look forward to returning, due to the food.

She asks what we want so we all order then my daughter asked for a torta with only beans and cheese.  Terror informs my daughter that they don't have bean and cheese tortas on the menu. I tell her that I know but can I just ordered a carne asada torta but with only beans and cheese.  
We spent about 5mins going back and forth about the torta. She advices us against ordering a bean and cheese torta because she will still have to charge us like $7.00 for it.  I said that's fine but it will make my daughter happy.  She finally said OK and I told her specifically no lettuce or any other items just beans, cheese and bread. Order comes with beans, cheese, bread,  and lettuce and butter.  
Honestly if not for her terrible service and that bad torta this place would be rated 5 stars as a fast food joint.

Being that I'm on vacation and was craving them she was reminded about this spot. Came with high expectations.... I was let down. I ordered a single, a quesadilla with chorizo, and a cup of corn. 

The tacos were reheated flautas, making the tortilla stale. The sauce a little too salty, but the salsa was on point. 

The quesadilla, well... When I ordered it the girl said she had to ask the cook because they've never made one before. She consulted the girl in the back for a few minutes then asked if I just wanted chorizo and cheese. Not exactly sure why it was such a complicated request. 

The corn in the cup was the absolute worst of this entire order. Now, usually corn in the cup is made with fresh corn on the cob, cut down and scooped into the cup. For some reason they decided to use plain canned corn. With only 3 other customers in here I'm sure they could have spent a little time on using fresh corn. Guess not. 

Probably wouldn't come back here. I'd rather just spend an evening making them myself at home. And not have to suffer the family with 4 kids running around our of control.",XanljSpa_18Mi-OjJcG3-A,0,0,3,tvsGwUytaXPkejms7vezNw

top and enjoy these beef flautas. You can order a single or double of them. You might need a fork by the time you get to the bottom but those ones are the best. They've been marinating in the red sauce. When you're done dunk your fries in there too. 
I also ordered the flautas Juarez while we were here. I chose the chicken ones. They were crunchy and cooked to perfection. Lettuce, cheese and a green sauce were on top of them. 
The elote comes in a cup off of the cob with all of the toppings. Way easier to eat it like that.

The carne asada was meaty with very little fat and inedible content... good quality meat. The cilantro and onion was generous and fresh.  Good amount of meat on both tacos.  The Colorado was a little bland to my taste. 

Perhaps Roberto's salsa bar had spoiled me but I was disappointed at the selection on the salsa bar and the to-go portion cups are tiny. There's chili Verde salsa (delicious, zingy, flavorful) and sliced, pickled jalepeno. That's it. 

The service was great and the facility was clean.  Sketchy part of town (as many great taco spots will be),  good freeway access at eastern and the 95.",0oCX_noDIESiIHKf7Sly1w,3,3,3,YHgHjH2J9tbJIR24hnGqfw

On our way home, one of his friends suggested eating here since he's from El Paso and he misses Chico's tacos. He ordered the El Paso flautas and it's similar to Chico's tacos but of course it's not the same.  Not too bad though tasty and fresh and it did scratch the itch considering El Paso is 800 miles away.

Maybe it is because the ambience lacked the typical festive energy of a Mexican restaurant but I didn't really enjoy this place. I walked in without anyone in line, and received no greeting whatsoever... A little bit of a downer. In fact, and despite my inability to make a choice at first, the cashier and those behind the counter never bothered to make a suggestion of a dish for me to try. 

 I decided to play it safe and ordered a steak burrito. Evidently their version of said typical dish only includes beans and a choice of meat. I was really disappointed to learn they do not have any rice or much of anything else to add to their dishes. The steak was somewhat crunchy (a bit old), the beans lacked taste and the meal was, overall, not remarkable at all. 

I must sadly say this is is not the place to visit for good food.",gn9jmujma9SyDirweX1c6g,2,1,2,PenDZQ5nn3ZGICAKBI8mnw

I have already been here a few times and coming from my hometown of El Paso, I can certainly say that this place is WAY BETTER than the original Chicos Tacos, the original restaurant this was based off of. Everything I have tried is delicious: the Flautas El Paso and Juarez (that should be a given), the Nachos, Burritos, (have gotten both with chile colorado, and it is one of the best I've had), the Menudo (only served on weekends, so that's a bummer), and of course, my favorite, Elote en Vaso! I get it every time. Paired with una coca, (a mexican coca-cola), and a meal from here is sure to please your palette.",LpvLLwebARJ02L8jgEhoVg,1,1,5,Ops0BqGiA_UnxODVWR7cNQ
5599538,2013-05-13,1,nl2nsBi9U3sW1R34nF0s0Q,"I was curious to see what this place was about.  I am not accustomed to Juarez style Mexican, let alone Mexican cuisine in general.  The restaurant is fairly new and decided to give it a shot.  

The outside and inside is conservatively decorated and efficient with its space.  There are some really cool pics inside, I am guessing is from the region.  It may be silly to say, but was intrigued to see if this place served dishes with cool cartel names as a theme.  But once I entered, realized that I was an idiot that needs his head checked.  It still would be cool to get a Jose Malverde combo or something.  I know it can be a sensitive subject and better quit before I get myself in trouble.

I ordered the Juarez Style Flautas and found it nerve wrecking since I was not familiar with the menu, but reluctant to ask questions since I don't speak the native tongue.  So I just pointed at the nearest picture of a combo meal and said, ""one of those pro favor (minus the por favor part).""  It wasn't half bad, but don't know what was special about it let alone the difference Juarez Style and any other style for that matter.  I washed it down with a horchata and spent a decent amount around $5.

This place is near the job and in a pretty location if you ask me if you are commuting on Eastern or exiting off US-95.  Although, I don't think that this place is getting much buzz and they may need to consult their marketing manager about that.  I haven't seen any reviews come in and I am probably the less experienced Hispanic food critic since I am not even sure on what to order unless I got help.

With that said, I have to rate this place a 3.  I usually rate the Roberto's next to my house a strong 3, well it is the cleanest Roberto's I have ever been in and that is saying something.  Which only means it would only be fair to give this place 2 by that standard.  Let's just say its a 2.5 that was rounded up.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,3,0,3,RpgSe6tuih3W1c37e4lLVw

Let's face it if your here it's because at some point you have had a great experience with food  in either Juarez and or El Paso, and you want to recreate that experience.

This place delivers is value taste and customer service. The food is legit, they are fast and friendly the restaurant is clean and inviting.
