Ordered the flat bread ham sandwich. 
The service was fast. The taste of sandwich was bland.  The place was clean. 
Would not order the sandwich again.",wiIDeJV0DOWVlKrKgG1NQg,0,0,3,F2-pkIKeAuznFlQUz8pQfw

This subway does have a drive through that's open till midnight, however each time I've ordered multiple sandwiches through it, they've always gotten them wrong.",U_xPSiusfTDi4QALaTr2uQ,1,0,3,BpmDK5dj2W1G9rVw5S5vdQ

4539892,2016-07-14,0,5mair616AhJMpRjbd5z94g,It's a subway.....my ham and egg white sandwich came out exactly as expected.....cheap and slightly squished. The one thing that stood out was the location: G H E T T O! Take a look at my photos. The drive thru lane was so slanted I thought my car was going to tip over.,ZudG3YIMP-6xda4yT0OeEQ,0,0,3,DvWT6h9yJSdlBCmYwNBTeA
4749924,2016-07-31,0,5mair616AhJMpRjbd5z94g,Amazing customer service every time I come here. They aren't stingy with veggies either! They had no problem making a meat substitution that *another* location had every issue with. I've been inside and through the drive thru and it's always perfect every time. Will always come back here! Drive thru needs a remodel though.,-YV1yESQXqR3vpIgBjKDsw,0,0,5,MWGltBBJsAEmXBzxQpFpxA

I probably wouldn't go back here because it wasn't even peak hours!",qRYwodYPMMkl7QKnpmc39Q,1,1,2,8YzGtglDwZEzEtA4VbhC1g
