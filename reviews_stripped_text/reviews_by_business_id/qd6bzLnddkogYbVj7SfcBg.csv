Also, the horchata is the best one I've had versus other mexican food places in Vegas, and I'm hispanic so I know what good horchata's like.

I kept seeing others in my area chowing down on these great looking burritos but never went because I have a short lunch break and I didn't want to risk a long wait. Well, never fear, they are QUICK and much better than fast food alternatives.

I had the chile rellano burrito even though most everyone else I know has the Super Burrito. It was great. It came with green and red sauce on the side, beans that were tender flor de mayo style or light pintos maybe, and a decent flavored rice plus the roasted chiles. I ate half of it without any sauce, the flavors of each ingredient were so distinct. I've eaten enough authentic Mexican food to know the various styles and, yes, this is gringo but it's good gringo. 

The food is very good and the fantastic service makes it a real pleasure to pop in to grab lunch. I'll be back.

asada fries were excellent. Fries were crispy topped w shredded cheese (glad for that because i dont like the nacho chz sauce)  guac tasted fresh and the meat itself was nice tender chunks.  Half star deducted becuase i would have liked more meat.

San Francisco burrito... Fries bacon chicken and salsa... This was good too. 

I loved the fact they served our meal with a small dish of shredded lettuce pico sour cream and a dollop of guac. That was a nice touch.

Half star for the wobbly table, that was on my nerves for reals.

The order nevertheless came out fast but if they get a rush there could be a problem.  I ordered the  chicken super burrito which was very tasty ..  Its only super because of what's added in it and not the size.  The size of the burrito is similar to Chipotle's.  Ordered a drink but had no refills.  The price was around $9 which is again similar to Chipotle.  The napkins provided on the table are the ones you have to use  dozen to do the job.  Restroom was out of hand soap.

Grabbed a breakfast burrito- meat option for ham, bacon, steak, or chorizo. The steak version was solid and they didn't skimp on ingredients. Eggs in burrito were over-well rather than scrambled as expected, and beans are whole into rather than refried.

While visiting in Vegas we were looking what to eat, we are not big fans of the big restaurants and fancy stuff!!! Plus who can afford that 3 times a day right??? Haha, right? Right? (Come one i cant be the only broke one here!) 
Anyways this place will do the job, the prices are somewhat reasonable. 
6 bucks for burritos
Carne asada fries about 8 bucks 
Food was good, a little to much on the American Mexican food, we got a burrito had sour cream, cheeses, beans, guacamole, pico de Gallo and the choice of meat, we got carnitas! Very good choice! Tender meat, the burrito was smaller than what one expects from a Mexican place but over all good taste! 
My kids got quesadillas with meat, now those were big!!!! 

But if anything the guest service was the best! The gentleman behind the counter Victor was pretty chill, genuinely nice and super nice to my kids!

Let's start from the time I walked in there were two people flirting with each other, I then started to ask about prices to which the female didn't know.  She began to take my order and then all of a sudden was interrupted by a  kiddie shoving match flirting session again while I stood there and waited  to complete my order. 
So I ended up paying $9.04 on top of the $0.45 debit card charge whatever no biggie. 
I was excited because when you go to Baja they give you a full plate. But when I look at my to-go plate which was not even a full size to go plate it was not even full it was a little over half full. I reached out to the cook and asked him is this all I get for over $9. He said yes.  I asked for a little more, he said ""no"". I informed him that this was disappointing and that I would not come back. He responded with ""that's fine"" in Spanish.  I was shocked at the response so I informed him I will now leave a review about this place. Again responding with ""that's fine"". 

At that time I requested my money back.  it usually takes a lot for me to write a negative review but this place was horrible unprofessional/ portions were small/ employees don't know their own product and they are too busy horsing around and flirting. I will never be back and will make sure I spread the word.",_Lh-pOke6f8p_lCu_hU-0Q,11,3,1,phF53gkYfVcVv6sOVgFMbg

Hopefully the other location on Eastern is still open.",zxmIKyEX89aY0QLC1JJksA,0,0,3,fnFLP3hFkIDahZ6Hc-axfQ
