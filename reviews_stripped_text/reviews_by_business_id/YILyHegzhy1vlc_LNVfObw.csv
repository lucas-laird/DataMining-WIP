The food is very good and we have tried several different entrees and appetizers and have loved most everything we have tried. It's a tad pricey but our overall experiences have been worth the price.

128117,2016-06-21,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Went there very recently, on a Friday night. We set inside, too hot for out. It was around dinner time, and very busy. Issues all over this place! I am having a hard time deciding where to start. 1. Reservations were completely screwed up. 2. Hostess (hostesses) are basically clueless. Gave 90% of the customers to 2 waiters, instead of dividing between 5 of them! Result: frustrated, overworked waiter and slow service. But he was friendly. Acoustics in the restaurant are terrible! Can't hear s**t anyone sitting close to you say. But you do hear constant loud noise from the rest of the diners. Sorta like a few dozen of parakeets screeching... On top of that, there's also a live music band, starts around 7:30 pm?  If you're there with anyone else, just eat, don't expect a conversation, unless you are monologueing, and not expecting an answer. Our waiter said he will lose his voice by the end of the night. Last, not least, the food. I started with their version of Caprese salad appetizer with Heirloom tomatoes and burrata cheese, at $14 it was the best dish there. Shrimp putanesca for main course. That was underwhelming. The sauce was very oily, pasta undercooked (not just al dente), and contained a small number of shrimp, which were overcooked & dried out. My friends were not impressed with any of their dishes either. I would consider giving them another try, just to be fair, but for sure, not on a Friday night!",zjM4aeGTr_LV6kPl9zrQ7g,2,0,2,-y4duGYGd8p6WsxkB9BqMg

Upon walking in we were promptly seated. our drinks arrived in a few minutes while our appetizer  was ready almost instantaneously.  The meatballs were soft, cheesy, and portioned to perfection. Brian made excellent recommendations  and was professional and enthusiastic guide through our Italian experience.

The hostesses were indifferent upon our arrival and didn't even acknowledge us let alone thank us for coming in and dropping $100 for 2 people as we departed. Only a couple glasses of wine at HH prices. HH appetizers were VERY small portions. 3 fishy oysters $6. $2 a piece for good oysters is on the high side at normal price. The sausage broccoli rabe was tasty and well prepared. Again a little $$$ for a pasta dish. We had to ask a few times to get some bread to go with it. The rest of the staff and our waitress were friendly and did a descent job. Lots of good Italian Restaurants in Henderson with good food and less expensive with friendly and appreciative staff.

1. The slovenly looking manager did nothing the entire time even though he was well aware that we were having problems with our server.
2. The server had no common sense and did NOTHING correctly.
     We waited almost 20 minutes to receive any service at all
     Nothing was done in the correct order.  Server did not ask for our drink order until we cut into the conversation to say that we wanted drinks
     Delays all through the meal - bread, drink refills (which means more $$ for the restaurant and a bigger tip overall)
     Soup (with no spoon) and salad brought WITH entrees.  Server said he timed this way deliberately or food 'would take forever'
     When I sent salad back because I already had entree the server was miffed
3. Sent feedback to Green Valley Ranch about experience and did not receive reply

838516,2017-05-10,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,Here is the scoop on this place. Walked in because I saw a sign for dollar oysters and I figured it must be my lucky day... well turns out it only got better! Warm welcome from the hostess I asked to sit at the bar since I was alone. Open seating perfect. Greeted quickly by a nice young lady named Tiffany she got me started with a drink and the oysters I wanted. Oysters came they were just as I expected very tasty. The other bartender Alissa now approached me to see how I was doing and if she could get me anything else. I wanted an entree she guided me through the menu and highlighted all the best dishes. Settled on the pork chop! Her favorite dish. It came out in a timely manner and I must say the presentation was flawless! Cooked perfect totally tender and juicy. Literally the perfect dish I was looking for. I destroyed all 16oz with ease because it was just too good to stop. But there is more I figured since I was on such a hot streak I would let Alissa select a dessert for me... bam she hit out of the park again. The tiramisu at bottiglia is one of the best I've ever had. Classic dish done right with a little twist! Overall this was a great meal. Wonderful service from both ladies. Great recommendations. Annnnnnd it wasn't over priced even though it was in a casino!!  I will probably be back in 2 weeks to try out some more dishes!,dN6NTQHvetdpAZV7ZULKRQ,1,0,5,__-tVOVjQAACFjWUfL49iA

Food was definitely overpriced for the small quantities provided. Caesar salad was nothing special and was drenched in dressing .It was ice cold and slightly wilted. In contrast, the short rib platter was a decent portion but was served barely warm. It was y=--underseasoned and could have used some salt or pepper. (not on table). One Caesar salad, one pasta dish, and one short rib platter - $65.00.  There is much better to be had in other restaurants.",WTRP80ksLRRZJGR_QxvJtg,0,0,2,khpQ-CW5Ds4NfOrDIOw0VA
844684,2016-09-19,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"I've wanted to try this place for over two months and finally went last night...... I'm so disappointed. Yes, the decor is amazing but that's where it stops. We waited almost 5 minutes to be greeted by the hostess. We were sat at a lovely table outside, so that made up for the wait...well, not really. We waited another 10 minutes for a server to come and take our drink order. We placed our entire order at once because the poor server was the only person servicing the entire patio - which is a lot for one person on a Saturday night. Appetizer came before our drink order, which is always suspect, meaning it was all prepped and simply microwaved once the order hit the kitchen. Nuked mealballs never works, period. The bread served was quite dry and stale. I had the wild mushroom risotto, which was more like cafeteria food, not a dining experience.  My husband ordered braised beef, it was ok but again, had a cafeteria ""buffet style"" to it. Tasted like it rolled off the Sysco truck into the microwave, plopped onto a plate and served with a hefty price tag. The wine was good, the wine got me through. It's a shame because the space is beautifully appointed but unfortunately the kitchen doesn't execute and the staff appear over worked and just try to keep up. I won't return.",6O-dn2g8REBlZ8w0solkig,1,0,1,6W_woNkWFBczz5poa4uANg
861412,2017-11-22,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Still questioning how I exactly felt about this place. Ate there last night w my boyfriend w high hopes! Made a reservation @ 7 PM. We got there at 6:50 and they said we couldn't get seated till 7. You'd think by making a reservation, that your table would be ready. We were waiting for awhile then more people began to wait after us. We were the last to be seated. That was the first flaw. We sat down and I had asked for a booth when making the reservation but got a normal table, that was still wet the moment I put my arms down onto it. Second flaw. Our sever was very nice, I noticed he was one of the older people working cause it is full of younger people so it was nice to have someone who seemed like they knew what they were doing rather than the hostess's who forgot we had a reservation. He told us the deals and we ordered ASAP since we were hungry. We both got the linguine clams. And the order of oysters for their Tuesday deal. The oysters came out first and were great. Next was the pasta, and keep in mind I was very excited to eat here for the 50% off and how they were posting their pastas! I must tell you, it is nothing compared to photos! It is so small! I would've got full off the oysters easier than the pasta. My boyfriend and I finished it way too fast and we were trying to make it last but we couldn't. We even ended up ordering more oysters cause we weren't full. I had such high hopes for this place but such an annoying chain of events. The hostess's were just rude. Food was good but false advertisement. My favorite thing probably was our nice server and the little candle on the table! Lol. I would go there again for the oysters.

874859,2016-05-26,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"This was a disaster.  It started at the hostess stand, where the hostess asked my first and last name and then proceeded to type into her computer for eleven minutes, then asking someone else to show us to our table.  (in an empty place) I was served an ice tea and water with an ice cube in each one; needless to say they were warm very quickly.  I ordered the pappardelle bolognese.  The server brought me a dish of cavatelli with meat sauce.  When I told him this wasn't what I ordered, he had to track down my waitress.  She said, ""Oh, you don't want this?""  I told her I wanted what I ordered, then she told me that yes, they were out of pappardelle.  I told her I didn't want this, to take it off the bill.  I asked for a bread plate, as one was not offered.  Restaurants like this annoy me.  You are in a locals casino, not the strip.  Charging $24 for chicken parm, with nary a strand of spaghetti or a salad does not make you a ""high-end"" place, it just makes you overpriced.

ATMOSPHERE: This restaurant is so cute! The lobby, bar, dining area, and patio all have really amazing decor. The hosts and waiters are all well trained and do an amazing job giving the customers an amazing experience.

DRINKS: Their bar has it all going on! They not only have all the normal drinks, but their specialty drinks are well executed with unique tastes and adorable presentation. If you're not into alcohol, the Pomegranate Basil Limeade is my favorite!

FOOD: Their appetizers and cheese plates are delicious and make a great shareable plates. They are best accompanied by a glass of wine. The salad served family style is the best deal on their menu because it is a large portion for the price. Everything else on the menu I feel is over-priced and not that good.

Started with some oysters. Served with cocktail sauce and a mignonette. I like my cocktail sauce spicier than what they serve, but the waiter brought some extra horseradish, so it was no problem. I like that you can order it in threes, and can mix and match east coast and west coast.
The wife and I weren't too hungry, so I just had the burger, which they made like a panini for me after asking about it. My wife had the gnocchi. I tasted that and was not at all disappointed in the spice. Both were great.
Neither of us were drinking so I didn't look at the wines list, but I saw the by the glass selection on the back of the brunch menu and they had a few of my favorites.

1223976,2018-05-14,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"I decided to take my significant other to this restaurant for a special occasion. We did not have a booking or reservation. So, I checked-in with the hostess. I have to say that this was my first really racist experience in las vegas. The hostess made it very obvious that we were not welcome in the restaurant. She pretended to add my name and phone number (so she can text me) to the waiting list. She said.. 15-20 mins wait. We stood there for 30 mins.. and I went back to check. This time there was a different hostess. She was surprised I was still waiting.. she expected me to just leave. She was struggling to tell me some ""fake"" reason... but then the original hostess quickly came.. and without any hesitation, simply said.. yes you have to wait. I finally said that I cannot wait.. so please cancel. Without batting an eyelid and not even looking at me.. she just shrugged her shoulders and said ""ok"".
While all this was going on... few other people came and were directed inside.
It was obvious our special occasion was ruined by this hostess and restaurant.
However, I refused to give up. We drove all the way to Red Rock and went to ""Masso"". I swear.. that experience at Masso was completely different.. absolutely wonderful. There too the hostess said it would be 15-20 mins wait. She took my name and phone number. Within 3 seconds I got a text message that my name is added to the wait list for a table of 2. I asked the hostess if I should hang around nearby... she simply smiled and said.. don't worry if you don't see our text message I will come and get you... how wonderful. After about 15 mins our table was ready.. I got a text message. We got a table on the patio (even though the restaurant was full)... the server was super awesome.

Long story short.. if you don't have the right skin color.. be prepared for a bad experience at Bottiglia. I would recommend go to Masso at Red Rock instead... it will be fabulous.",iZw2pTZwnuHG3-9FAM47fQ,0,0,1,JFk5BQgHEMOPIOVtCmQY8Q

We ordered the fried risotto, I've had this before and it was amazing, however this time it came out and was a little warmer than room temperature, so I wouldn't say it was as good as last time. I ordered a chicken Caesar salad. After the first bite i took, I pulled a somewhat large chicken bone from my mouth. I had the waitress come over and she took it to the back to show the cooks. She never came back to speak with me about it, never asked if she could get me anything else. The rest of our party was unimpressed by the food.

He explained to me that the sides and edges of the toast is supposed to be crunchy and extra toasted... Okay.... But I'm sure they're not supposed to be burnt..

Short ribs for dinner,COLD. My husband's chicken picatta was hot because you have to make it fresh. 
$10 for a side of Asparagus and it was like the redwood trees in San Francisco.  They were hot as well because they had to make it fresh. Spaghetti squash $9 dollars and cold.

No apologies or follow up by our server for the 35 min wait for our appetizers. It was our runner who actually apologized for the delay in our appetizers and after a few bites, had followed up with us. Still no server. Another 15 min go by and the adult entrees arrive. The kids food- $10 grilled cheese & tomato soup- still missing. How long does it take to make a grilled cheese? I'd rather the kids food be made before our entrees if that is the case. After 1 taste of the tomato soup, the kids complain- tastes ""burnt."" I tried it- definitely the soup tasted burnt. We flag down our server who takes our soup away, follows up with us that the tomato soup is meant to have a smoky taste to it since its ""made in a wood burning oven."" Soup made in an oven? Did they forget about it and burn it? It was not even a smoky tasting soup- it was a burnt soup. And kids menu did not specify smoked tomato soup, or they would have passed. Our server had offered to make another soup for the kids. No thanks. They have already waited an hour to get their first soup. Both kids declined and you would think our server would offer a treat or something on the house for disappointed hungry kids. Nothing. So I decided to order dessert- lemon poppy seed donuts (holes) based on a yummy looking yelp pic. Ummm- the yelper got more donuts holes than we did? They got 5-6 donuts. We got 3. 3 donut holes for $8. Had I known I would have gotten 2 orders so each of us could've eaten a donut.

My 3 star score is for the awful lobster pasta dish. It was not worth $42 dollars. It sounds much better than it tastes. The pasta wasn't cooked completely and the sauce served was tasty but minimal. It was also cold when it was served to me... not sure if it's supposed to be cold but the menu didn't specify that. I just expected to have the most amazing dish for that price. They should honestly take it off the menu because I wouldn't even want it if it was $20.

1643522,2017-01-10,1,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Birthday dinner with the folks and I wanted to try Bottiglia in GVR at the District. Pretty casual & bright atmosphere with televisions (great for those who don't want to miss the playoffs). Decent selection of cocktails and wine by the glass. I tried a Fresca Fizz - it was refreshing but a bit watered down with very little fizz. I think the Prosecco might have gotten a bit watered down by the ice or the Prosecco might've been open too long.

We started with a bit of salumi and cheese - the bresaola was really nice, as was the burrata and tasty toast. Don't forget to try the mustardo that's served with the meat & cheese - it's really good! The arancini were cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside with a warm creamy center.

We received a complimentary Caesar salad.  Our waiter Bryan said it was because he noticed there would be a lull in between courses (he got slammed with tables but it didn't deter from his very good service at all).

For my entree I chose the pappardelle bolognese - anything with pancetta has GOT to be good! Pasta was cooked nicely and not overdressed. 

Overall I would give the drinks and meal 3.5 stars and with Bryan's service bump it to 4 stars.

BTW, Chef Ben, formerly with Bachi Burger, recently started at Bottiglia (like two days before), so it might be worth it to go back again and see if he's done anything fun with the menu or preparation.",KdQq5g7AjZyCrB2gzwHsmQ,2,2,4,CIvgkgvBxelyEUHysFMZAA

The food, what we were able to order, was delicious, but our service was extremely subpar. Our server, Audree, took our drink order and delivered our drinks. After she brought us our drinks, she took our food orders and then WE NEVER SAW HER AT OUR TABLE AGAIN. Runners delivered our meals and refilled our waters. I sat with an empty wine glass and we all sat for at least a half hour after we were done eating our meals before we gave up on her coming back to our table to ask if everything was OK and flagged down a runner to get our check and have our leftovers boxed up. We would have loved to order more cocktails and desserts, but we were tired of waiting for her, so we paid our bill and left.

We got on the happy hour menu, the beef carpaccio, tomato soup with grilled cheese and prosciutto and a charcuterie board. The plates were smaller than I thought they would be and what the pictures show. The beef carpaccio was delicious and a little sour once you mix the lemon and arugula. Tomato soup was not bad a little on the cold side but the grilled cheese was different, the bread had a sweet taste to It. The cheese board was phenomenal I love prosciutto and salami, I also think they had truffle cheese and they all mixed well together. For the main dish I opted for a linguine with clam and king crab pasta. The dishes were smaller than a normal dinner size but they were hot and tasted as I thought they would. It wasn't spectacular but wasn't bad, I might come back for happy hour and their cheese board! They have also been advertising 1/2 off all pastas in November and have the same pasta on every billboard BUT they don't offer the pasta they are advertising.

1697985,2017-07-18,3,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Thanks to L.C. For a great impromptu birthday dinner! 

I enjoyed a lovely evening with friends in this beautiful restaurant.  The bright and open dining area has modern yet inviting decor.  We were seated promptly to start our experience.  

Happy hour was still open so we decided to share a few items for the table.  The HH cheese and salami board has such a cute presentation.  It's a great way to start our meal.  

The HH Meatballs were just ok but nothing to write home about.  The HH Caesar Salad topped off our starters which was perfect since 3 of us were sharing.   

Now for the highlight- my friend and I shared the Mushroom risotto and the Chicken Parmesan. Holy moly! Chicken Parmesan overly huge.  We actually divided it three ways and it was still a large serving.  The Wild Mushroom Risotto hit my taste buds with a bang.  I would recommend this masterpiece of a dish.  The mascarpone, truffle butter and chives combined beautifully.  

The service was attentive throughout the evening.  However, I wondered why the waiter suggested ordering more pasta on the side of the chicken when its such a large serving. I'm glad we only had the risotto with the chicken parm.   If you order the Parmesan dish, definitely share it.  

Of course since we were celebrating, we shared the dessert sampler of strawberry panacotta, tiramisu and lemon poppy seed donuts.  Fantastic.  Each little dessert is perfected.  The pannacotta is light and sweet complimented by the dense little donut with blueberry dipping sauce.  Their tiramisu has a strong nutty taste brought by the frangelico.  Little desserts make up this strong sampler.  

I was pleased with my first adventure here.  I hope there will be many more.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,12,8,4,8qmC45nt1j-0dlq_e8zl2g

1741589,2016-07-09,1,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"There are few times in my life that I become so disappointed with a restaurant because it doesn't match their potential.  Usually, I'm just disappointed due to a total lack of potential.

I was also conflicted with how to rate this restaurant.   If I were to rate the manager, or lack thereof, this restaurant would receive 1 star.  Thankfully the upbeat staff, sans direction from their leader have changed my mind to increase to 3 star.

I feel obligated to mention how disgusted I am of the manager.  A gentleman, let me correct, a man that focuses all of his attention, and feels that it is a priority to text in the middle of the dining room, chat and make out with who I assume is his girlfriend at the end of the bar.  More importantly he does this in the middle of service on a Friday night. Of the several times I have dined at this restaurant, I have witnessed at least one, if not all of these behaviors all three times. How does that beard even pass health code inspection? In such a beautiful restaurant, with such a welcoming atmosphere, why do we have bum wandering around pouring bottles of Krug (check your pour cost there boys!!) for a couple of 20-somethings that wouldn't know Krug from Cook's.",r54wxWohaQAav2kurfmwjg,2,1,3,djphUK2Nh9inkFj5lF9yBw

We ordered a couple cocktails, I got the ""endless summer"" which is amazing!

1781246,2017-10-19,12,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"I've been to Bottiglia twice and my most recent visit really impressed! Service from Zack was great, the patio is gorgeous for the weather we're having, and most of the food was delicious. Add in that they have a free glass of wine with Yelp check in, dollar oysters on Tuesday, and a decent HH menu, and I am down to return regularly!

First visit was for a networking happy hour event and the small bites didn't impress but the space was gorgeous. Yelp reviews were mixed, I had no urgency to return until I saw their National Pasta Day promo for half-off pasta dishes. Made reservations with two friends and spent a couple hours sipping and noshing.

The apps are solid, from the bread plate with a sweet honey butter to the gorgeous charcuterie plate we got (burrata with double bresaola and truffle honey FTW!). The oysters were super fresh, too. The meatballs from the HH menu were the only thing that underwhelmed, great texture but not as much flavor in the meat or sauce, but they have strong competition next door for this dish.

Moving on to the pastas! Don't sleep on the side of Carbonara Mac & Cheese, which was a hit at our table. The creamy cheese sauce sticks to the trumpet-shaped campanelle pasta well, and the guanciale-bacon combo packs a punch of flavor. If you choose to go with a meat/seafood main, this still lets you get your carb fix. As for the pasta entrees, the Shrimp Puttanesca was decent and meaty with a hearty sauce, a touch of heat, and tons of shrimp. Unfortunately, the veal ravioli was extremely bland and the sauce was broken. Per menu description, there was allegedly truffle cream involved and ricotta inside, but our trio detected none of those flavors. Zack helpfully asked to switch out this dish, but we declined.

Overall, I was pleased with this redeeming visit, but the various discounts and promotions surely helped. Looking forward to a revisit for the pappardelle bolognese and the octopus app.

TIP: If you missed out on National Pasta Day, they're running similar discounts in early November!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,28,22,4,rzL-exwSQXkr_tfW4QDnMA

All of my visits here have been five star worthy. This place has everything I wanted and needed close to home. 

Let's start with the atmosphere. Beautifully decorated, every object in this restaurant seems curated. You'll wish your home was decorated identically to Bottiglia. And don't even get me started on the patio. My goodness. It's like being in an extremely elegant backyard. There are potted plants galore (as an avid plant lover, I'm a bit biased here), misters, a fire pit, lounge seating... I can keep going. I could LIVE on that patio. 

I see some yelpers may have had bad service... I have been multiple times and service has never lacked. My first visit was in the first week of opening and things were a little slower, however, I wasn't in a rush. Dinner is meant to be enjoyed, and why would you want to rush out of a place as pleasant as this? Servers are happy to offer suggestions, rush to get your happy hour orders in, and are overall very friendly. The restaurant is managed very well, and everyone seems to deeply care for the restaurant and the experience each customer has. 

The food... THE FOOD. Now, this is NOT traditional Italian. If that is what you are expecting, do not get your hopes up. The food is based in Italian food, for sure, but it more modern, fancier, and has interesting non-traditional combinations than you would see in homemade classic Italian food. Very surprising, delicious, adventurous combinations, that if you get your head in the right place, you will enjoy immensely! 

My favorite things on the menu: 

Zucchini Flowers (IN LOVE)
Short Rib with dumplings
Carbonara Mac & Cheese
Arancini 

Give this place a shot, especially if you are a local. You never know, it could become a new favorite spot! It is for us!",HUX1p0y71x_j-5VWz4tB0w,34,31,5,uDILJg6C55RgY7P6xiyfsg

The decorations inside are very cute, it didn't even feel like we were in a casino. There were TVs all over the place, though, which killed the mood of the cute wine bar feel. It caused a weird clash and seemed like the focus was on sports instead of company. The table came with assorted breads. Nobody complained about them but nobody ate much. Everyone got drinks, wine or beer. My husband was not impressed by the beer but I had a red wine and it was pretty good. 
The menu was rather small. And the food was small, too! I ordered the beet salad and it turned out to be half of a beet cut up and garnished with lettuce. It tasted good, although for the price I would have expected 'great', but there was just so little of it that it was disappointing. Almost everyone else got steak or a pot roast and mashed potatoes. Their meal size was also pretty small. I could have very easily eaten 3 of those meals and I'm not even a giant eater. My family passed me pieces of their plates as they pitied my itty bitty salad. I tried almost everyone's meat and it tasted pretty yummy.

They have a fresh, modern interior with a comfortable, plush feel. It sets the stage for their classically inspired, yet modern Italian cuisine you are first introduced to with a unique and diverse bread plate for the table, but the highlight is definitely the crispy cheese frico! 

On their $7 Happy Hour menu, we sampled the meatballs, fried zucchini blossoms, and arancini. They were all delicious, arancini was extra creamy inside, meatballs were tender and flavorful, and their homemade Bolognese is true to the classic recipe; but my personal favorite was their vibrant interpretation of zucchini blossoms! The unbelievably creamy ricotta filling was infused with so much fresh lemon flavor, and the crispy exterior was more like a panko breadcrumb, giving so much texture and support for the two accompanying sauces; not to be outshone, the tender zucchini blossoms played their pivotal role with their fresh vegetal essence. By far the best bite of the night- Out of this world! 

For our pasta entrees we tried their king crab bucatini and the rigatoni sausage pasta. The rigatoni were super sized- almost the width of a manicotti! The ground sausage sauce was spiced with Calabrian chili, but the dish had plenty of cooling relief from large dollops of their ultra creamy ricotta. My king crab bucatini was loaded with unctuous, tender crab throughout with a light cream sauce, balanced with roasted tomatoes and zucchini strands. 

The serving expertise of their nearly all brunette male (eye candy) staff makes for a truly complete experience as all our dishes were perfectly timed and they are attentive but not overbearing or intrusive.

We got some nice bread and butter as soon as we sat down. Then it started to become a bit more complicated... we were there at 8 pm, since they warned us they were closing at 10 pm. It literally took our server over 30 minutes to take our orders... The first appetizers came out at 9 pm.
Food is nice. Not amazing, and pretty small portions for the price. I had the zucchini flowers as an appetizer, which were good but only had 3 mini-flowers for $13... and then the baked gnocchi arrabiata for $22. Slightly over cooked and not spicy at all, despite the server's warnings.
We had to wait for another 30 minutes to order some desserts, since our server completely disappeared then.
The thing is, for a restaurant with this kind of pricing, I am expecting a higher level of service and quality. Otherwise I'd rather cook and eat at home.",vrtwR7XZO6yq35zaxEZ6fA,3,0,3,va_L-1nU9tdtoa_SeNu17A

Arancini- my favorite. Deep fried risotto stuffed with cheese in a tomato sauce. We also dipped the bread into the sauce and cleaned the whole plate. Delicious

Caesar salad- nothing special. Chopped romaine tossed in Caesar dressing with shaved Parmesan and house made croutons 

Squash blossoms- was not hot when we got it, and not as crispy as I would want. Filling was creamy and tasty

Cheese and salami plate-only came with two small pieces of cheese. Good quality salami and procuitto. Nobody came to explain what kind of jam or cheese we were having until we asked 

Eggplant dip-a little too sweet for my taste and really creamy like a mousse.  Toast was perfectly crispy so we still ate it all

Meatballs- never made it to our table :(

They somehow misplaced our ticket halfway through our meal, so we sat through 2 hours of ""where's our food?"" and left without getting to try the meatballs that we ordered. We also had to ask for bread, which all the other tables had except us.  They were obviously down staffed that night and other customers around us were upset too.

2266592,2016-05-14,3,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"One word to describe Bottiliglia, disaster.

To start off the disastrous experience, we called and made a reservation. When we arrived, the three hostesses could not find our reservation. However, they were still able to seat us. After we were seated it took a while for our waitress to bring our menus, it took longer for our waters to be delivered, it took even longer for our orders to be taken, and it took an eternity for our food to be delivered. Also, I tried to use the Yelp check in offer for a free glass of wine but my waitress did not honor it. Conveniently some tables that were seated after us received their food before us. One table also finished their meal before we received our food. After our food was delivered, precisely 65 minutes after first sitting down, we asked for our check. Of course to cap off a bad experience we are brought another table's check. After we got the right check, it was the check used to charge hotel guests who charge to their rooms so again we had to request another check. Horrible multi flawed dinner.

My party had the spinach lasagna, the pappardelle bolognese, and the clam linguini. The food itself is decent. Nothing special nor worth writing home about. 

I will not be returning and cannot recommend dining here. If you do dine I suggest giving them several weeks to try working some of the many kinks out. 

The restaurant itself is nicely renovated.

Lot has changed since then because for the most part every one is new to me. Meet up with visitors and mutual friends that suggest check this place out. I was really happy they did because it solid italian food reasonable price not cheap or high end expensive. The Happy Hour is DA BOMB!! Not often do HH but the HH menu not that long but the things they do have are some of the popular items at half the price. I ended up getting the meatballs and the formaggi and salumi. The meatball only get two but expected since HH. The meatballs was cooked perfect, moist, the tomato sauce was tasty, and the cheese brought it all together.  It left me wanting more meatballs that for sure. The formaggi and salumi board had three different meats, diced feta cheese, nice crispy crostini, and apricot fresh jam on the side I think. I thought it was interesting they even had basically charcuterie board on HH menu. All the HH menu compare too full menu is half price. Really no item on the HH menu list that not winner.  For the price its steal of deal. Friend she ordered the caesar salad off HH menu nice side salad size. The HH drink menu not sure because I was not drinking that night but they do have few options. 

My entree went with the linguini vongole. It was solid dish. Nothing mind blowing but great traditional white wine butter sauce. Decent amount of fresh clams and nice size portion of pasta. Beverage went with the pomegranate basil limeade. It was refreshing. Nice summer time drink with the caffeine. The presentations of all the food was really good. I like the fact they used different plates or even cutting boards (the formaggi and saumi dish, the meatball was in oven baked dish on top of cutting board also same with friend ordered the lasagna). It definitely gave the food more upscale high end restaurant. It could also be said for the interior decor. The separate private dining rooms they offer, think might only be friday nights but have live band (two people) playing great relax cover music in the bar area, and bar really nice. I like fact got this summer outdoor feel in the tropics inside. We ended up sitting outside on the patio area. They were busy we had no reservation. The patio actually a spot on perfect weather would recommend. They have booths that more like kicking back on couch in one living room with lot of pillows. The view nothing much faces the parking lot. Still feel separate area all by itself for me. The great thing about patio is the band playing not as loud can still have conversations with chill/smoothing music in the background. 

The staff was fabulous. Our waitress did great job explaining everything since we were all first timers.

On a side note, Bottiglia is a very slow paced environment so this is not the best place for groups in a rush to eat or that come Bottiglia ravenous.

2369588,2016-06-27,5,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Let me start off by saying I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars solely for the aesthetics and two of the three plates we got. 

The decor is pleasing to the eye and definitely makes you feel at home. I was with a larger group so they sat us in a private area and drew a curtain for privacy. The waiter knew we had a movie to catch and he was very prompt about getting drinks ordered. 

A bread platter arrived shortly after we ordered appetizers. The butter is to die for! Sweet, creamy, and a slight lemon undertone, absolutely perfect. 

Slowly appetizers started to arrive but not all at once. Some got theirs and about ten minutes later another... Odd but okay, about 30 minutes later the waiters began clearing appetizer and bread plates to prepare for the main course. Unfortunately, I had not gotten my beet salad yet. I mentioned it to the waiter and a few minutes later, it arrived. This was worth the wait. The beets were sweet and tender, the goat cheese added a nice sharp contrast, and the sauce was creamy and wrapped the whole dish together beautifully. 

That was the last good thing that happened... The main course took an additional 40 minutes, and only one person's dish came out. Over the next 10 minutes, more dishes began flying out. I ordered the seared pork, which I am sad to say was not worth the wait. The flavors were mediocre at best but it was a large portion. I shared with my date so it filled us both pretty well. 

The movie was at 8:45, dinner was fully served by 7:40. Empty water cups by 8:00 and our waiter flitters in and tells us he's getting our checks ready, 8:20 and some of our cards were charged incorrectly. My date and I left a little early for another event around 8:40...

Granted, maybe our large group of 15 played a role in the less than superb service but I've never had such horrible service or only had one waiter. Perhaps he should've asked for help or had manager help delegate tasks. I won't be back.

Or was ) our favorite. She made us feel like royalty every single time we came in and we were so sad to find out she was no longer with you guys. I asked my husband if he still wanted to get dinner here and we were quickly cut off by a very rude woman ( looked like a manager but was seating guests at the hostess stand ) who informed us Christina was "" let go "" I asked Why?! She was our favorite and she said she had great servers who could help us.. Very uncomfortable and unprofessional.

I call the Stuffed Zucchini Flower, zucchini flower bomb! It's filled with some kind of cream cheese concoction, breaded and deep fried. The flavors and texture of this is just superb!

The Lobster Diavolo is my ultimate favorite item on the menu. You get large bite size chunks of lobster in the pasta dish, plus the head of the lobster which is very tasty. The burst of flavors from the lobster and perfectly al dente pasta is what will keep me coming back.

Wait, I take that back. The white sangria will also keep me coming back. Get a pitcher, because it is too delicious to have just one glass. It tastes as pretty as it smells. The floral scent in this sangria will keep you mesmerized.

Definitely a new fave spot in Henderson.

The entrees are al carte so an extra side of pasta, which other restaurants include free with entrees, are $8 more. Strike three ! Salads are expensive at $12. Better value Italian restaurants around town than this one. I would have given it a one star rating but our server, Kevin, was great. He deserved a 25%+ tip.

Within a 1/2 hour the restaurant was packed. We were a party of 3, wife, mum and myself. The waiter quickly brought us a wide variety of breads and some butter. We ordered some waters and I checked in for the free glass of white wine.

We looked at the happy hour menu and decided on a couple appetizers: the meat balls with gravy, garlic lemon bread crumbs and buretta, and then the bucatini which came with basil pesto, charred zucchini and pecorino Romano cheese. The two meatballs were very tender and covered with plenty of sauce, we actually used the leftover sauce to dip the bread into. The bucatini tasted refreshing and light, the thicker noodle combined with the pesto was a nice combination.

For the entree's we chose the pappardelle bolognese which came with san marzano, pancetta and a red wine sauce. The pappardelle noodle is house made fresh daily, is very thin and combined with the aforementioned sauce was superb. My mum ordered the wild mushroom risotto accompanied by mascarpone, truffle butter and chives and topped with spinach and a mix of vegetables. Delicious was her response.

Service was very good, they are very attentive and with a mention of my wife's birthday, they were quick to bring out a tiramisu topped with chocolate shavings and a candle with a couple of chocolate dipped cookies. Tim to the last spoonful. The perfect way to finish a great meal. We will be back again. Thank you Bottiglia!",WXDj6mmyrJi5q5nHKJ6H7w,6,4,5,pCUoQQrbeSaTIm8UoZ3OJg

  I love the décor very much in here. The restaurant has low table, high table, bar sitting as well as a private dining area. I had seen someone hold a private party at the dining room, so fascinating. On the outside, they also have a Italian countryside style bicycle, which is perfect for photoshoot.  
Wine and cocktail are so great at here. I ordered white sangria and endless summer.  The ice on the wine has flower in it, the server told me that the ice are not made from pure water, after the ice melted into the wine, the wine will have another flavor. As for the endless summer, it has a very fresh taste, great drink on the hot summer time. The coconut and pineapple fresh your mouth; the citrus gives the drink a little sour and bit taste. A great cocktail to start the meal.
Food is amazing. I would say it is the best Italian food in town, for me at least. Wood roasted tomato soup has the sour and salty flavor. The flavor is really impressive to me. Some people may think that it is a special, even wield taste, but I really like it. The bread serving before the meal is amazing. The bread includes parmesan crispy flake, French baguette, cheese bar and cranberry walnut bread. The flake is extra crispy and tastes fantastic with the butter. Butter is honey-lemon infused. The taste is fresh and great. The cranberry walnut one is my favorite. It is just fairly sweet. The main entrée I chose is the braised short rib. I chose medium for my rib. The meat tastes fresh and oily. It smells fragrant. The shape and decoration of my dish is attractive. I really enjoyed my entrée. The portion for the short rib is really big.

The Italian stallion is an awesome drink. Oysters were good. Lots of pieces of shell though, I understand they're only a dollar and the shucker is cranking em out but if every other oyster I'm picking out shell it gets to be a little much. GF and I also shared the octopus and beef carpaccio which were both delicious.

There were a few things about the bar service as for the reason I couldn't give this place 5 stars.

1. I had asked the bartender to put on a hockey game, she said she'd ask a manager, she never did, the bar wasn't busy and the tv was on sports center with no one else watching.
2. The bartender was a little too caught up in her phone. The pos system was right in front of us and she kept her cell phone to the side and she was constantly texting. My girlfriend and I are bartenders too so we get it, but she shouldn't do it standing right in front of guests.
3. I asked for a shot which she forgot till check time after I reminded her. It wasn't on the first bill she gave me, only after she ran my card. Idc that it was on there, but she didn't even mention that she added it and corrected the tab. Just charged me for it and dropped the check. You should always mention to the guest when adjusting totals.

All in all I was impressed with the food and will return for more oysters. The hiccups in service were just that and I know I'm nitpicking but when my GF and I are both bartenders on the strip we notice the little things and the little things matter to service industry folk sometimes.",PqTz1gaHSV_Z9PugxrZgwQ,2,0,4,HBH2hvK9w14eBNluKRuAmw

My family and I had our Thanksgiving dinner at Bottiglia and could not have had a better evening. 

It was convenient that some of the family was able to have a turkey dinner and the others could still order off the menu. 

I had the Thanksgiving tasting menu. It was started off with a choice of soup or salad. I had the butternut squash soup with turkey meatballs. Some of the best turkey meatballs I have ever had. My dad went with the fall pear salad. It had prosciutto and a whipped mascarpone. Nice presentation. 

Next course was the turkey dinner. Very flavorful dark meat underneath a few slices of white breast. Some type of cream truffle green beans that were so good and I do not care for truffle.. stuffing, mashed potatoes and a great cranberry sauce. Too filling. 

For dessert there was vanilla gelato with pumpkin panacotta. Great way to end the meal with something lighter. 

The meal was coursed perfectly and the staff was great. No one likes working on Thanksgiving but everyone had a smile and was friendly.

My favorites are hands down the grilled octopus appetizer with black garlic yogurt sauce. Has great flavor of the grill and the tender octopus with the crispy potatoes underneath and that amazing sauce is really something. Even non octopus lovers can't help but enjoy it. Then my next favorite is their tiramisu. I used to believe it wasn't possible to find top shelf tiramisu outside NYC but Bottiglia's might be better than any I've ever had even in New York. Just really unique, flavorful with great textural complexity that you don't typically find in a run of the mill tiramisu. 

Other favorites include their hangar steak. Delicious. The brunch menu has an amazing granola dish that is really tasty and enjoyable. Followed by their amazing corned beef hash with tomatillo sauce (incredibly good). Pair that with some of the best tasting coffee you will find in Las Vegas and you'll have a winner brunch. The staff is always great (although they've had a lot of turnover I've noticed in their first year). Jeremy has become the new guy at brunch on weekends and does a great job taking care of me. 

Lastly, I would be remiss if I didnt mention that it's one of the most beautifully appointed restaurants in all of Las Vegas. Off the strip, it has no real competition in that category. There is almost no where in Henderson that has outdoor seating in a classy upscale environment with top shelf food and service. It's a unique place and hopefully the first of many more like it in Henderson, where the culinary scene is badly lagging behind for a city that size.",f7Q14HePdG1vZpx28PpDRg,1,0,5,KS0dou2DlP4mQcww9VVKPg

I could've eaten only that and been absolutely in love. Entree: Braised Short Ribs - beautifully plated, fork tender. Not super flavorful,  but not bland either.

First and foremost they offer some of the best pasta in the Henderson area. By far some of the best values around for the price. Portions and pretty decent and the quality is here. Definitely not an Olive Garden style restaurant.

It's conveniently located on one of the side of the green valley ranch so you don't have to worry about having to walk through the casino to get to it.

They have great specials like half off pastas randomly through the year so always check. They also have dollar oyster specials. 

We highly recommend the spinach lasagna. Amazing layers of perfectly cooked pasta, cheese and spinach all surrounded in a rich savory tomato sauce. For sure a 5/5 at only $22.

They also offer the king crab bucatini which is the most popular dish. A pricy one at that as well at $32 a plate. Decent pasta with chunks of king crab with a Meyer lemon cream sauce. First time we had it it was phenomenal, second time sucked because there was a piece of shell that got lodged between my teeth cutting me pretty bad. The manager came right away and took it off the bill along with our drinks.

Give the zucchini flowers a try as well. It's pretty much friend zucchini stuffed with a ricotta filling. Pretty tasty for $15.

When I hear that there's a great restaurant inside of local casino I tend to call, ""bullshit,"" but Bottiglia Cucina is the real deal. The vibe of this place is bustling, fun and feels ""young"" not old and stuffy, which is where most local spots tend to falter. 

Bottigula offers a full open kitchen/dining room, a large outdoor patio, and decent sized bar and lounge area if you're just looking for a few drinks. We showed up early for our reservations stopped at the bar for a quick drink and light bite before the main meal event. The bar is great, and I could have easily eaten dinner here and been happy. We sampled the charred octopus, and a few martinis and both were perfect. The octopus was very tender and just a touch chewy. Once we sat down, we started with Meatballs and Carbonara Mac n Cheese and shared the Braised Short Rib. I don't have one bad thing to say about any of the food, everything came out fast and hot, which is great because they were busy on this night. 

Out of everything we ate, I highly recommend the Charred octopus and Braised Short Rib, order these, and you'll walk out a happy camper. I also keep hearing that this place has an excellent Sunday brunch. Time to brunch so hard.",i_DR3vdE73nVm2GlMbGpGA,35,35,5,7Y-fmvGFwPZsRKNp5GETVQ

The ambiance is awesome but is a little noisy.  It's a not a ""let's have an intimate, quiet dinner"" type of place.  The floor plan is open and airy.  They have a ""lounge"" area at the entrance which I assume is part of the bar.  I don't know since we had regular dinner seating both times.
They also have an area for if you want to do a ""private party"".  It's not totally private but it can be your own area of the restaurant.
They also have a nice patio area and as soon as the temps drop, I'm sure that will the place to sit and enjoy the evening.

We enjoyed Brian and Gerald's hospitality on the 2 occasions we've been.  Both are Excellent!  Friendly, Genuine, Sincere and Accommodating!

The first time I went I enjoyed the Mediterranean Branzino.  It's fabulous!  Tender and Filling!  They don't skimp... I think it was the whole fish!  And the side that comes with it is light and lovely..... quinoa and chick peas with a lemon vinaigrette. I would totally order this again.

The next time I went I had the Halibut.  It was also very good.  But truth be told.... I'd pick the Branzino over the Halibut.

We also started with the Chopped Salad.  I highly recommend sharing this salad.... or have it as your main meal.  It's quite large and can be filling if you eat the whole thing by yourself.  This is another one of those, ""I'm totally ordering this again"" type of dishes.

Three friends and I had dinner here tonight and have to say this is a winner with one exception. Friend number one had halibut and it was very dry and overdone. Halibut is a delicate fish and there's a fine line between perfect and overdone this one definitely crossed the line.
The rest of us had Veal Marsala which we all really liked.  Oddly enough they used enoki mushrooms instead of button or cremini mushrooms but the veal  was tender and the sauce was excellent. We ordered pasta side dishes, I ordered pappardelle with Bolognese sauce expecting to get a very small side order since everything is a la carte but side order was very generous. Sadly the Bolognese was not true Bolognese sauce which is made with the addition of milk-this one wasn't but was still a very good sauce.  Caesar salads  were very fresh and the dressing was excellent.
Olive bread and sourdough bread basket could have been heated but was served cold although it was very fresh. The addition  of lemon flavored butter was a real taste treat.

I wish I could remember the name of our server - he was a young black man who really knew his way around serving. Very personable, brought our orders out immediately and checked on us to make sure everything was OK. We're going to look for him again the next time we return.

The Decor is white and pastels-very pretty but the patio is a real knockout. If it weren't so hot we would have eaten out there for sure. Definitely next time because we will be back

For anyone with a gluten allergy, be careful. I had heard either from me calling the restaurant or one of my parents that they could accommodate gluten allergies, and also that they could do a number of items gluten free.

When talking to the bar tender about menu disclosures that wasn't the case. They only had three items listed as gluten free and they were all salads. I had asked if they could do the halibut gluten free and it is usually breaded he had said. They were able to accommodate me after all but I did feel sick the next day. I am probably extra sensitive though, mind you.

Most of the menu had items that you would assume would be gluten free especially some of the sides considering they were just vegetables. The ingredients weren't all listed on the menu even though it says what's in the salads, appetizers, and entrees. This happened with something else that said it didn't have dairy but contained milk, it may have been one of the soups or something. 

Not the biggest deal ever but definitely look out for it if you eat gluten free, and especially if you have to because of an allergy or intolerance. 

I would come here again for drinks hands down because the bar tender was quick with that and the drinks were good. Mine wasn't as strong as I am used to but really not by much. The atmosphere is very bright and summer + spring vibes. That is the whole reason I would come again because with the food the service was slow, but again I have heard it usually isn't that slow.

We decide to check it out for brunch with party of 6. 
We came few minutes late behind the original reservation, but surprisingly the place was almost empty at 12:30 on Sunday with great outdoor temp and few games going on on the tvs. 
We asked for a table outside, after 10 mins the hostess had the table ready. The venue has nice patio amenities ( shades, mists etc) but the hostess decided to seat us on a table where mostly wasn't under the sun. We had to move to the other side of the restaurant where we found ourself perfect solid shaded patio. 
Interior it's pretty impressive. Open concept, rustic design and very pretty pastel colors all over the venue ( my wife flower shoes were matching, she was excited) 
Getting on the menu! 
I didn't want to dig the menu before I get there I wanted to be surprised and wowed. Well I end up wowed with 6 brunch items. Noting impressive or mouth watering. Lox bagels, one Benedict option classic bacon with toast, yogurt and a cup of fruit! Yea cup of fruit as a main item on a brunch menu! Sad! Rest of the items were some pastas and dinner entrees. I saw end up getting carpaccio. It was ok, served with poached egg. 
We tried most of the drinks. Blood orange mimosa and both sangrias. I think I got diabetes afterwards. Soo sweet and plain. No twist at all.

She tacked on auto-gratuity which kind of explained why her service sucked so bad. So it was hard to really enjoy our food or even remember if it even tastes good because of horrible service - or lack of service. If anyone decides to dine here and you see that your server is Heidi and/or if you're a party of at least 6, don't expect her to go the extra mile or even show her face more than once or twice, since in her mind, she's already earned her tips.",Z3S7Y6ywAOrWUS-jevfu6Q,0,0,1,YNsMMREACnu00e9KnUqm-g

To start, the restaurant is  BEAUTIFUL and aesthetically appealing in every sense of the word. We showed up an hour before close (so sorry we were running late), like many restaurants do I was fearful we would be rushed out the door and a turn and burn table. Instead, we had top knotch service. We were greeted by the friendly Manager Javier & our server Kobee. They were kind and informative and it was obvious that they were going to make sure it was a memorable experience for us.

We ordered many appetizers (do yourself a favor and get the zucchini flowers), a bottle of wine (Kobee recommended the lovely and tasty antinori peppoli), full entrees and everything from presentation to the obvious team work culture, to the TASTE of everything we had we were blown away and it was so lovely.  On top of all of that, they sent out a sample of a dessert liquor and dessert, a sample appetizer, and some champagne on the house. I kid you not- we asked for an experience and they gave us one.

The dining room has baguette booths and tables. They also have tables on the outdoor patio. I recommend the baguette for comfort, and some privacy. The decor is bright with plenty of natural light from the large windows. Service was spot on from our server Kobe. He checked on us periodically and  promptly removed empty dishes.
Happy Hour is available throughout the restaurant which allowed us to order wine at a discount.
Complementary garlic bread with olive oil and balsamic started our dinner. Nice soft bread with embedded garlic cloves.
  
The following 3 courses were ordered from the Restaurant week menu.
Meatballs
Chicken Parm
Tiramisu

The Chicken Piccata entree was ordered from the regular menu.

The three meatballs were tender and served in a flavorful tomato sauce. The Chicken Parm was two large breasts served with fresh cheese and the same great sauce as the meatballs. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a nice crisp breading. Tiramisu is served is a mason type jar layered and topped with chocolate shavings. A great tasting dessert.

The Chicken Piccata was four pieces of breasts pounded thin and served in a lemon butter sauce which was perfectly balanced.

The portions of both entrees were large enough to provide some take home. 

I am awarding 4 instead of 5 stars due to the very loud music. It is not a conversation friendly environment. In addition, the dining room has large TV screens on most walls which takes away from the dining atmosphere.",ywEB0MB_2U11NIGPs35pew,0,0,4,2CZ2-rEa8PThDFaKZ-ob0A
3242467,2016-06-19,1,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"I have now been here twice and had similar experiences both times.  We sat at a table both times, not the bar.  I have a friend who dined at the bar two times and absolutely loved it.

The first time we had a server by the name of Raul serve us, last night we had Heidi.

The first time we ordered wine, for appetizers we shared the eggplant spread and caprese salad.  For our entrees I had the chicken parm and my company had the eggplant parm.  The server was overly attentive at first and then it went down hill.  We noticed other tables with a bread display on them so I asked after our appetizers were already almost done.  Raul said that was his mistake and he forgot.  How do you forget a major thing like that.  He brought it over shortly after.  The eggplant spread did not come with enough bread for the amount of spread we had.  The chicken parm was decent but a bit soggy.  

The food was decent but the service was the main issue.  The water service was very inconsistent.  They would bring iced water one round and then non-iced water the next.  Our server, Raul, went missing in the middle of the dinner and when we needed water, another glass of wine, a box, Raul was no where to be found. 

Another server came over and took our order of coffee and dessert and the boxes we requested.  Raul then was back and we told him how we already ordered through someone else and he brought us boxes after we already got the boxes.  There was no communication between servers.  We were very close to the server station and could overhear them having having a disagreement.  The staff overall seemed a bit nervous and all over the place.

Last night we gave this spot a 2nd chance.  We called earlier in the day to make a reservation and they told us there wasn't any availability.  We then called back at 5pm when the restaurant was open and they said they had plenty.  It's a good thing we called back or they could have lost business based on the earlier phone call.  

This time we had Heidi as our server.  Heidi was good at first however in the middle of our dining experience she kind of went missing too.  We ordered a glass of wine and a mule to start.  The wine came in a timely fashion however I had to ask again about my mule.  She went on to explain it was the bartenders 2nd day as he transferred from a sister property.  As someone in the industry I understand what this means but as someone dining at your establishment I frankly don't care, I just want my beverage.  We then ordered bruschetta.  We noticed on the menu it said it was supposed to have buffalo milk yogurt so after we received it we asked about it and we saw Heidi go up to the kitchen and ask but it was clear she didn't know her ingredients.  

After our appetizers Heidi offered to take away our utensils and bread plates however I didn't use my knife and fork and one person in my party didn't want new ones and Heidi seemed confused by this.

For entrees we had spinach lasagna, chicken parm, and a side of spaghetti squash.  The food took a little while to get out and Heidi said ""let me go see what's up with your food"".  Interesting verbiage.  She was great on the water service but she could definitely work on eloquent verbiage.

One observation we did make was that a bearded man who we assume was the GM was around talking to all of the servers and meeting with them when we were sitting there waiting on entrees and stuff. It seemed as though his time could have been spent doing something more beneficial to the guests.  He walked by us several times and noticed us looking around but never did a table touch.

I wouldn't recommend coming here for a meal sitting at a table but I would give it a shot at the bar probably one more time to see if I could have a better experience.",gwXobKRw1ihYiKPqwUE9xQ,3,0,2,I2clvMr2fWX44Q18A6w_Ew

The interior design is like out of a Better Homes and Garden magazine. Being able to watch the kitchen work while we enjoy the fruits of the labor is wonderful to watch as someone who is in the industry and loves being on the line. 

Kobee was absolutely fantastic! He even started us off with a free glass of Blood Orange Mimosa on top of a full carafe of it. He was a wonderful server! 

I ordered a shrimp cocktail to start and the shrimp was HUGE! It was so delicious and so worth it when the shrimp were so plump and moist. You can tell the cocktail sauce is made there in house and it was the best cocktail sauce I've ever had to accompany the shrimp. It was the perfect balance between sweet and tangy. 

Never before had I eaten Eggs Benedict but when I saw the prosciutto eggs Benedict I HAD to order it. I believe it will now set the standard for me. The potatoes on the side were delicious - not too salty, hard, or mushy. I loved them!

They have large entrees that are pretty reasonable for a nice Italian restaurant; on par with Vegas taste though a few dollars cheaper.  Most dishes were above $20 but not incredibly expensive.  Appetizers on the actual menu were about $13 on average.  Wines by the glass ranged from $10-14.  We had a few oysters, the spinach lasagna, the arancini, and some house bread.  Arancini was quite good but probably only worth it on Happy Hour as there's only 2 to a dish.  Lasagna was solid and pretty large though the spinach lasagna might have been a poor choice.  Oysters and bread were fine, though we explicitly had to ask for the bread.

The restaurant ambiance was great.  The outdoor area and a solid lounge/bar area as well while waiting or for a more casual meal. This would be perfect for a long brunch.  I hear they have bottomless so there's always a reason to come back.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,0,2,4,-G-9tPfKIzctF_Zv-fbvNg

I recently came to Bottiglia for a friend's birthday engagement. I was extremely impressed with the beer menu, fully understanding that most Italian restaurants throw an emphasis on their wine list. I was incredibly intrigued by the mythically named Dragon's Milk beer on their list (an American import), and promptly ordered it. This beer floored me. Not in the ""carry me out of GVR"" way, but in the ""wow! This is mighty tasty for 11% ABV!"". After sharing with the mostly non-beer drinking table, they agreed. This beverage was a true winner right from the start.

My girlfriend and I ordered the braised veal ravioli with sauce and peas, and as expected in a fine restaurant as such we were delivered a total of four medium sized raviolis. Keep in mind, this is a fine restaurant and you are paying for delicacies here, not for portion size. The ravioli themselves were tremendous and I highly recommend them. In keeping with posterity, we also ordered the side order of macaroni and cheese, which was thoroughly tasty and more filling than the ravioli (for those of you who are on a budget, as I always am).

All in all, with this Italian restaurant you pay for exactly what you receive. For myself personally, that's all that you could ask of a restaurant. So try out Bottiglia, eat, drink, and be merry.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,1,0,5,jCzasBoNHUOOV9wSCx_NsQ

Our server forgot to mention this, and so our group of five ordered far more food than any of us could possibly eat. The second time, all the portions were smaller. No idea why.

Our waitress brought us menus after we'd been seated for over 10 minutes. She explained everything and left without taking our drink order. She returned to fill water glasses and still didn't take our drink order. 13 minutes later we saw her point at us as if she totally forgot she was our waitress. We ordered drinks, apps, and entrees. We received the appetizers before we got our drinks, which we had to ask the server who brought the apps for because she clearly forgot. 

The crispy calamari sat on a bed of what looked like fryer scraps. Calamari is not supposed to be served like that. It also did not come with a lemon garnish. I've never been served calamari without lemon to squeeze on it. The Brussels Sprouts were yummy, although she said they came with pine nuts and ours did not.

I ordered the halibut. They were two very small pieces compared to the 3 photos in Yelp. It was by far the driest halibut I've ever had. The risotto it sat on was room temperature, not the slightest bit warm. The carrot and pea purée were tasty. 

We decided to have dessert elsewhere since our experience/food were not pleasant. 

Also, we found it a bit odd that the servers did not have more professional attire. Black slacks would look so much nicer than jeans. And the waitress with her phone hanging out of her back pocket was extremely distasteful. We will not be back!",7H3C9mzIG0IvICHw2IImfg,1,0,1,oqCM-RcZulWmybDPOy_c0Q

I shared the following dishes:
Arancini: Six risotto filled balls fried with w bolognese sauce with fontina cheese. Risotto was nice and creamy and the bolognese was a nice touch to the dish. 

Papparedelle Bolognese: Thick cut pasta with an overabundant amount of bolognese sauce. I like bolognese and theirs is tasty but the ratio was way off. I could have made more pasta at home to have another portion

Short Rib Cavatelli: another excellent dish with the same issue as above. Way too much sauce for the amount of cavatelli in the dish. I did enjoy the flavors but having pasta over sauced can ruin the dish. I would order this again and tell them lite on the sauce.

Service was excellent. Our server was at our table making sure we were content throughout the dinner. I will definitely be back here to try some of the other menu options. I even received a free dessert for it being my birthday.",L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,1,1,4,4yGFua4AyYyy115iZSsQHg

So when my friend sent me a picture of the menu and said we were going here for her birthday, I started to panic when I needed her to translate and already started planning places I could stop by afterwards to eat.

Michelle was my main server who was later helped by Doug as Michelle had a party inside the restaurant.  Michelle gave me some recommendations before I ordered.  I went with them halfway.  I chose the beet salad (not the appetizer she suggested).  For the main course, I chose the king crab bucatini.

The beet salad was excellent as was the bucatini.  For dessert, I chose unwisely by getting the lemon poppy seed doughnuts--not because they weren't good but because it was so much to eat.  The lemon flavor with the blueberry dipping sauce made a great combination.

My dinner at Bottiglia was nothing short of amazing and definitely one of those memorable experiences. What a gem in Las Vegas/Henderson for the locals and tourists alike.

I am such a huge fan of the station casinos. Green Valley Ranch is on another level though. I've been to the buffet here and to Hank's and never knew about Bottiglia until someone referred me.

I came during happy hour and just thought it was so modern and chic but welcoming and Lowkey at the same time. Their happy hour is a great deal to grab wine with friends and have a bite to eat.

My standout dishes were the mushroom pasta, the stuffed squash blossoms, and their calamari. We also had their octopus served with potatoes and it was the most tender octopus you'll ever try. The presentation of all the dishes is as good as anywhere and everything is done so well. 

Their bar is also amazing! They have a full bar and they give Hank's a run for their money in the martini game with their Classic Martini.

The thing that I was most impressed with was their service. We were helped by so many different staff members but their continuity of service was just spot on. Their management also check on tables multiple times during service.

I know I will be back here because I crave some of the dishes. The mushroom pasta, the stuffed squash blossoms, and the octopus dish are still being day dreamed about!

4107227,2017-10-18,7,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"I'll admit that it's easier to give five stars after experiencing a trifecta of special pricing, but I can't say that I've had better Italian food recently if ever.

Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca is an Italian restaurant that opened last year on the Paseo Verde side of Green Valley Ranch. Except for Sunday brunch, they're only open for dinner. Reservations are taken and seem to be necessary on special occasions, but we were able to get bar seating for 3 despite being told that it'd take over 2.5 hours to get a table.

Today was National Pasta Day, and they had a 50% off deal that surely drew crowds all night long. It also happened to be Oyster Tuesday, with fresh shucked oysters available for $1. They're (intentionally) on the smaller side, and a few pieces were quite miniscule, but they were sweet and went will with any of the accompaniments: the standard cocktail sauce, the alternative that somewhat resembled fish sauce, or just a small squeeze of lemon. Only fault was the presence of broken shell pieces in several bites.

Complimentary bread was enjoyable, especially the crispy cheese cracker. The crunchy thin ""breadstick"" was okay, and the two baguette end pieces were good. The real star was the honey butter, which had a hint of citrus and was so addictive that I almost completely forgot that the Italian take on this app usually comes with an olive oil and balsamic sauce. Oh well. I preferred the honey butter anyway.

It was also happy hour (5-7pm on weekdays), so I got the happy hour meatballs ($7 for 2 pc.). Assuming that Yelp photos of regular menu meatballs ($14 for 3 pc.) are correct, then I actually did get a decent discount, although my first thought was that these had better be the best meatballs that I've ever had for $3.50 a pop. Turns out that this was exactly the case, with a moist and soft yet thoroughly delicious ground meat playing well against the balanced tomato ""gravy.""

We each ordered a pasta to take advantage of the special. I settled on the Spinach Lasagna ($22 regular price), a simple preparation with ricotta, mozzarella, and a tomato sauce. It was surprisingly fantastic, and I wouldn't have longed for meat at all even if I'd not ordered the meatballs. Also, neither this nor the other pastas would be filling enough alone for a dinner.

I also tried two other entrees. The King Crab Bucatini ($32) is one of those dishes where I'd probably always long for more protein, but my one bite had al dente pasta, great cream sauce, a piece of delicious roasted tomato, and fresh crab. The Pappardelle Bolognese ($26) had a plentiful amount of yet another balanced sauce, as well as an al dente preparation of the only pasta on the menu that's actually made in-house. If I suddenly developed some sort of cheese allergy, then I could be happy with either of these.

We decided to split dessert, a sampler ($15) which included small portions of three treats made in-house (I think; check with Michael K. in case he paid more attention). The strawberry panna cotta was smooth and not too sweet. The tiramisu had that rum flavor which so many preparations lack, although maybe the espresso was lost in favor of the chocolate shavings. The lemon poppyseed donuts (3 pc.) were much closer to muffins in density, but are enjoyable regardless, whether alone, with a dollop of the mixed berry compote, or with a pour of the other, fruit-based sauce (guava and strawberry, perhaps).

Decor was bright with light colors, or at least we had plenty of lighting until they dimmed the lights at dusk. It still wasn't too dark at that point. TVs adorn each side of the bar and at least one of the other interior walls, and national broadcasts of both hockey and basketball were airing (although everything was reportedly switched to baseball playoffs later - sigh). The patio could be interesting, but I don't typically care for outdoor seating, and I was quite happy with the frequent and attentive bar seating service. Pacing and speed of food was great too.

Bottiglia does feel like a Strip-priced restaurant, but the quality of the food was commensurate. I certainly don't have the budget to visit often, but I'd return for a special occasion or if I wanted to be assured of having great pasta.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,13,14,5,Dx_-Bc_CIzTJJ10G8cdRBw

You can tell this is not a classic Italian joint for a few reasons (1) they have no fruit dessert (2) they will not provide oil and vinegar for the table (3) they will not provide a spoon for pasta. The bread they do serve is spectacular. The portions of meat are grand. However they offer no side salad option. As an Italian woman, I am not so impressed with this hipster Italian joint, despite its pottery barn flare.

Came here on a Tuesday, which was a double deal since they're oysters were only a dollar(which is every Tuesday btw). AND LET ME TELL YOU, one of the best oysters I've ever had! It didn't even need the extra sauces it came with on the side. Our group ordered a total of 26, and if we didn't have more food coming, I would've devoured another 26 all to myself! We also had the calamari, which was a little too salty, but I liked the crunchiness to the breading! And they also give you a platter of bread while you wait for your food, which i didn't care too much for since we had other, greater options, but I will say their butter is good! Very light and slightly melted, and a lemony taste. 

I had the king crab pasta and my boyfriend had the short rib with spaghetti pasta.  And yet another ""let me tell you moment"".. LET ME TELL YOU, their pasta is AMAZING - more especially the king crab one! Probably the best pasta I've had. Had the perfect texture, the perfect flavor (a light lemon flavor - which wasn't overpowering at all, and the perfect amount crab! The short rib was inferior out of the two, but still delicious. The short rib was very tender, and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but I didn't like the sauce all too much, which was tomato based. 

Service was good! Our waters were constantly filled, our server was friendly, the hostesses were friendly and took great photos of us when asked!

The only thing that knocked off a star was the wait? 
We were sat about 12 minutes after our reservation time, which isn't long but I promise you, it makes the wait worth it if you just be a little honest with not having the table ready on time.

I will definitely come back for their oysters!

Located within the walls of Green Valley Ranch resorts, its not so far from the entrance especially if you came from the movie theater front. Just hop on the escalators to the second floor casino and you'll see it on your left side past a few bustling restaurants and visual slot machines. Once you walk in, the hostess will happily greet you upon arrival. Don't hesitate to indulge or take a snap of the bright retro vespa near them though! 

Service was as convivial as they are generous. Informative to the max, they left no hidden details of their happy hour of $1 oysters (we were just in time for it) and the fact that we came in for National Pasta Day was a definite plus (half off all the pasta selection of the menu)!

I ordered their veal marsala as my friend suggested I try something new for once instead of eyeballing a salmon at a fine dining restaurant all the time and not fear the idea that deer meat can be ""stereotypically gamey"" when in reality it can be quite delicious (oops). Our sides consisted of wood roasted cauliflower, brussel sprouts, carbonara mac and cheese and there were ample servings of it placed in cute sky blue Tuscan chinaware on top of thick wooden placemats. You are also given a complimentary bread appetizer in the beginning as a starter. As for cocktails, we asked for the most citrusy and fruity on the menu, and the waiter suggested the Endless Summer and Fresca Frizz. Needless to say I found them both satisfactory but leaned more towards Endless Summer since it tasted light on the alcohol and an easy drink to down rather than the Fresca Frizz (you can taste more of the vodka here). 

My friends ordered the short rib and the halibut respectively. We all tried each others dishes and I was surprised on how juicy the veal was! I would definitely order this again whenever I have the chance to. Braised Short rib wasn't dry at all, but neither was it overpowering in seasoning so it was savory at best especially with the added spinach ricotta dumplings. The pan roasted halibut was buttery soft, and although the combination with the risotto was rather strange at first taste (perhaps it was the puree?) it worked out well in the end after a few more bites, even though my friend did not care for their peas, I didn't mind it.

We topped the best for last with desserts. The dessert sample was an assortment of the tiramisu, strawberry pannacotta, and lemon poppy seed donuts. Generously so, the waiter and chef was able to divide the desserts fit for three people! Neither of the sweets were high in the diabeetus level so that's always a plus. The sampler was surprisingly on the house thanks to their manager, since I mentioned prior to reservation that our dinner was a small birthday celebration for our friend. How nice of them to accommodate this confectionary for us! It definitely set the bar up for our birthday celebrant, candle lit desserts and all. I also ordered their pistachio cannoli but wished they had the cream inside of the cannoli as a pistachio ice cream instead of just powdered pistachio nuts on the side.

Would love to come back again for their daily happy hour menu!",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,3,3,5,h799uF-6fE0F2rOzBnNw7Q

The atmosphere definitely exceeded my expectations. It was almost like I was somewhere else than Vegas. Although I do wish their outside patio gave a better view than the GV Resort parking lot, the inside was more than pleasing to enjoy the dinner. We were greeted by the hostess right away and guided to our table. Our waitress came to us, and served us, but not too promptly, we had to wait for awhile. Instead, their busser served us water and the waitress asked if we wanted anything else to drink, and did not show up for another 10 minutes. When We got out PG and got some appetizers to start off.

-Beef carpaccio
Not the freshest selection of beef, but still pretty good. They did not have balsamic vinaigrette like most of the places do, and had a lighter sauce on it, which was pretty delish as well.

-Arancini
Loved the fried balls themselves, but the cheesy risotto underneath with their cheesy sauce was a little too much.  I think they could have balanced it more with some marinara. We asked for lemon, squeezed them on top, the dish was actually a lot more refreshing.

-Buccatini 
It gave me a feeling of eating spring pasta with buccatini. The dish was light which is the kind that I like, but nothing really special.

-Clam Linguini
A little dry, but yummy. Nothing special either though.


None of their desserts seemed appetizing to us, so we skipped dessert. The waitress extremely annoyed us until the end of the meal. She seemed like she was always on a rush, when the restaurant was half empty, and she only had two more tables to take care else than us. All the other servers seemed to be chill, and attentive to their customers, yet ours only seemed to tell the bussers what to do.

There are comfy couches to sit with in-laws, a classy bar to sit with your hot date, cozy circular tables to snuggle up or a fun patio to sit with your coworkers. Bottiglia is perfect for everyone. 
We started the night with the charcuterie board- 3 for $12 was almost too much for the two of us to split. The teahive from Utah had a sweet honey taste and I loved it. Meat, cheese, apricots, honey, chocolate bread on an adorable pig board. Yes, yes, YES. I can't wait to come back for happy hour ($6 wine?!?!?!) and order this again! 
Linguini Vongole: SO MANY CLAMS. They brought out the bowl for our shells before they brought the meal and I was confused as to why the bowl was so big..... And then I saw why. The portions at Bottiglia are great. The pasta was perfect. 
Veal Marsala: The meat was so tender and again, the portion was huge. Simple, but good. I have no objections on ordering it again, but I think I would try a different meat next time. 
Yelp check in for a free glass of house wine! Bottiglia brought us out a beautiful  slice of chocolate cake with chocolate mousse and a candle when they heard it was my partner's birthday. THANK YOU GUYS- You made the night perfect!

4352237,2017-06-25,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Bottiglia is a solid spot for brunch in Henderson. As for dinner, I don't remember it being as memorable. The food is done well, but what makes Bottiglia a place where I'd return again lies in the sauces/syrups. Where the food lacks in creating a truly novel experience, Bottiglia makes up in service and ambiance/atmosphere. The restaurant is generally good for both brunch and dinner, but it lacks something that would truly make it stand out and shine. So far, all I've come up with is that it's aesthetically pleasing and the sauces/syrup are great.

I've come here twice for brunch and the last/most recent time, we got the cinnamon bread pudding starter, pancakes with cinnamon butter and bourbon maple syrup, two eggs any style, and an everything bagel. 

The cinnamon bread pudding was pretty good. It's your run of the mill bread pudding with some decorative edible flowers on top. What makes it a thousand times better is the sauce. I honestly think the sauce really ties it all together and makes the bread pudding something I'd want to order again and again. For the price, it's okay. It's definitely something extra I'd order if I'm feeling particularly zesty that weekend. You know, channeling my inner 'treat yo self' a la Parks and Rec.

The pancakes were fluffy and done well. Again, what made it that much better was the bourbon maple syrup. It was so flavorful and rich, and it lent a nice helping hand in making the pancakes go from average to slightly above average.


Overall, I feel like Bottiglia knows how to cook/bake things well, but the true star of the food lies in the sauces. The sauces are were the small bit of creativity lives.",hX0-0jfbXUNUTzyGtg090g,0,0,4,RR048mtFNspsYdXPX4Tuxg

When first arriving there is an open waiting area furnished with low seating couches and chairs next to the bar. The overall feel of the resturant is modern upscale yet cozy and welcoming. 

For food I enjoyed a charcuterie board consisting of pecorino and teahive cheeses accompanied by prosciutto and picante meats along with the calamari as an appetizer. The meat and cheese is all freshly shaven and served with a side of truffle honey and when the honey is spooned onto the cheese it makes for a mouthful of sweet and savory flavor. The calamari was perfectly cooked and seasoned well. It had a slight kick of spice and the end of each bite which I quiet enjoyed.

For entrees I tried the chicken parm and the rigatoni sausage. The chicken parm was a huge portion and I definitely got my money's worth. The crispy outside was the perfect transition to the juicy center which always left you wanting another bite. The chicken parm was served with a San Marzano tomato sauce which was light and fresh as if it came direct from Italy. The rigatoni was cooked perfectly and paired well with the fresh sausage. I requested the dish spicy since I am a fan of spice and I was not let down. The heat from each bite lingered in my mouth but it was not overpowering rather it left you wanting more and more. 

For dessert I had the panna cotta with fresh strawberries and a berry sauce. The creaminess and sweetness of the panna cotta was balanced out by the tart yet sweet berry sauce.

4382557,2016-07-11,3,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Over the years I've wished that GVR would get more restaurants since the location is so convenient and finally it's happening. Bottiglia isn't just a restaurant, it's a great restaurant. 

Reservations seem to be a must. Our first attempt to come here was without a reservation and they were booked for the entire evening. This time I made a reservation on Open Table for a 6:00 dinner. The restaurant was pretty full this time as well.

The restaurant is bright and cheery. It's much more open than the last Italian restaurant that was in this spot. The restaurant is beautifully decorating and very inviting. Next to the hostess stand there are couches for lounge seating, a large bar, tables, booths, and two outdoor patios with seating. In the back there is a private room that can seat a large group. 

We were brought the bread board to start. The parmesan crisp and olive bread were my favorite. The lemon honey butter served with the bread was delicious. The presentation of the bread was nice. I ordered a Red Sangria which had a nice flavor and wasn't overly sweet. It was a measly portion for $12 so I'd pass on this next time. 

Before our meal we shared a Caesar Salad and Meatballs. The Caesar Salad dressing tasted homemade. The meatballs were good, but could have used some more seasoning and the marinara sauce was well flavored. I liked the fresh mozzarella with the meatballs. 

For dinner I ordered Chicken Parmesan and my husband ordered Short Rib Cavatelli. The Chicken Parmesan was delicious and tender enough to cut with a fork. The sauce was delicious and the cheese on top was the perfect amount. My husband's Short Rib Cavatelli was delicious as well. The sauce on it was great and the short rib was in large, tender pieces in the pasta. I loved the whipped lemon ricotta in the dish which sent it over the top. My husband and I ordered one pasta dish and one meat dish on purpose so that we could share with each other since the chicken doesn't come with any sides. Sides can be ordered a la carte, but given the size of entrees that would be an excessive amount of food.

Dessert is a must here. When I first looked at the dessert menu I was not that intrigued by any one item, but I'm not one to pass on dessert. The Dessert Sampler seemed like a good item for my husband and I to share so we went with that option. Everything on the sampler was amazing and it was a very good deal for the amount of dessert. The Tiramisu was one of best I've ever had with a lovely flavor. The Strawberry Limoncello Pannacotta was the best item with plenty of lemon zest, strawberries, and a to do for strawberry compote. The donuts were light and perfectly textured with a nice lemon curd. As if that wasn't enough there were two delicious chocolate dipped shortbread cookies. Everything on the plate was a great dessert.

The thing that most worried me about trying this restaurant was the service. We've had terrible experiences with service at Hank's and we were worried that it was a GVR curse. Not at all. Our waiter was attentive, water glasses were continuously filled, and all of our food came out in a well timed manner. Our waiter did get more tables as were wrapping up so it took a little time to get our check, but he apologized without us saying anything. So, based on our experience I don't have any concerns about the service.

There is only one thing that detracted from the experience for me and it will be a deal breaker if it wasn't a one-off. Nobody else has mentioned it so hopefully it was a one-off. When we first arrived the music was at a reasonable volume. About 30 minutes later they turned it up so loud that my husband and I were screaming to talk to each other. When the live musician arrived it didn't get any better. This restaurant just doesn't seem like the proper venue for music that loud.

Overall, I absolutely loved the food, service, and design of the restaurant.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,12,10,5,-tLNHNxYVj84GdB5KbjP8w

All ordered from the menu (menu seemed very limited) with no special orders.  Had to ask waitress for everything from bread to Parmesan cheese to drink refills.  Lengthy time for meals to arrive and no explanation for the delay or offering more bread to fill the void.  One meal arrived 20 minutes after the other 5 meals with no explanation provided for the delay until we had to find the waitress to determine the reason for the delay.  Both my meal (Chicken Picatta) and my host who ordered Veal Marsala arrived barely lukewarm and knowing the 6th meal had still not been delivered; returning our meals for reheating was not going to happen .  The Chicken Picatta was overly peppered so you couldn't taste the wine/lemon/capers and the chicken was rubbery which was strange considering the thinness of the chicken cutlet.  

No one in the party felt their meal was flavorful or plentiful to warrant the high cost, long delay (I mean it wasn't even 6 PM yet), and lack of service.  The manager had to get involved for the seriously delayed meal and lukewarm veal and chicken.  Though the manager discounted the meals there is no one in the party who felt they would ever return to Bottiglia (and we visit GVR several times a week).

And no one ever asked if we wanted fresh pepper on our salads, cheese on our pasta, or more bread so we had to ask. I think it's in the details that things are getting lost here.  I think the atmosphere is beautiful, minus the TVs. Convenient location too.

Update: We returned last night after being away for a few months. Service was great, still missed a few details, but the food was bland and unremarkable.

The Caesar salad was excellent, oysters only so-so, bread very good, beef carpaccio perfect, veal picatta very tender and tasty, tiramisu disappointing.  We ordered well drinks from the happy hour menu which were listed at $6.  We ordered them over ice and confirmed with our server that the brands we asked for were in fact part of their well drinks.

The service and speed of food delivery was very good.  The bill came and was over $100, which seemed high and when we reviewed it we saw each drink carried an additional $3 ""rock"" charge.  We asked our waiter, he said it was because we ordered just the liquor over ice.  Hence the ""rock"" charge.

When we went to pay we asked to speak with the manager.  We asked her about the $3 rock charge and were told, they charge that because they pour 50% more liquor if you don't order a mixed drink!???    To be honest, the drinks did not look at all like they were a drink and a half either.  Nowhere on their menu was their ""rock bump"" charge indicated or the alleged reasoning of a 50% greater pour, nor were we told that by the waiter at the time of order, nor when we asked about the additional charge. 

We pointed that out to the manager, and her response was,""I am sorry and will have to talk with the waiter.  Hope you give us another chance.""

Why would I give this restaurant another chance?  She did not offer to take the rock bump charge off, nor any other incentive to come back.  

This is a very deceptive pricing practice.  I caution anyone planning on eating here to be on the look out for other questionable practices by Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca.  We certainly will not be giving them another opportunity.",vV7PUam3caKHYlZBgPesQQ,7,1,2,3ezDzt7TF9tvvxYeOAOoWQ

I've been eyeing this spot for a while since they opened.  I went with a group of 5 and I ordered the calamari as an app for the group along with chicken parm and a side of pasta.  The pasta does not come with the dish and everything has to be ordered separately which I don't mind at all.  The chicken quality and taste was good.  The pasta and sauce was absolutely average at best.  This is the sad part to me.  I think the chicken itself was $25 plus the side of pasta being $6 I was expecting a lot more...especially from the pasta.  It was your basic spaghetti with marinara.  I also knocked it down a notch because our waiter made us wait over 15 minutes for bread and kept telling us they were ""making it""...so naturally I was thinking it was going to be fresh made (at least warm) bread.  It was cold and serviceable...nothing special at all...so when he said they were making it, he meant that someone had to throw the cold bread in a basket.  We were already done with our apps by the time the bread basket came out.

After taking our drink order, the waiter brought out bread. We proceeded to wait for about 10 minutes before catching one of the bussers and asking for butter, which they had forgotten to bring. 
We started out our meal with the beef carpaccio and a cheese & salami board.  Rather than asking, the waiter and brought us the happy hour versions of the dishes.  The appetizers were minuscule (even for a happy hour menu), and had different preparations than that which were listed on the dinner menu. They left a less than positive impression on our palates. 
Next, we had the Halibut and Bucatini with King Crab, which came highly recommended by our waiter.  My halibut was bland and the farro was overcooked. The flavors in the Bucatini were well balanced, but I needed a magnifying glass to find the king crab. For 32$, I would expect more than 1 table spoon of mediocre shredded crab meat lost in a pile of pasta. 
At this point, we weren't going to take chances on desert and asked for our check.

The servers really seem to enjoy what they do and it was much appreciated. I would recommend this to anyone wanting a nice dinner with a beautiful environment.

The room is beautiful and service was good, but that was the limit to the superlatives other than the fact that the meal was comped.  My wife and I settled on a shared Caesar salad which was pretty much tasteless and rather petite for $13. We also shared an order of wood roasted Brussel sprouts with hazelnuts, ricotta salata and pomegranate that was dried out from overcooking and served at almost room temperature.  We did not fare any better with our entrees of pan roasted halibut with farro risotto, carrot puree and peas.  I had specified on ordering that I wanted the fish medium rare, but just like on our previous visit, the fish was overdone.

From the moment you walk in, you are greeted right away and will notice the cool Vespa off to the side. The place is usually bustling with diners enjoying themselves with a glass of wine or cocktail with their meal.

 The space is very open and extremely well decorated. Think of modern country with a hint of Victorian elegance. This would be a great place for brunching or dates. Now, without knowing, I happen to go when certain pasta dishes are half off for that month. That being said, I ordered the King Crab bucatini and a slightly spicy tomato pasta dish I don't recall the name of, but both were the really good. The portion sizes are not giant and not tiny either. I think they are the correct serving size recommended by nutritionists. I ended up ordering a glass of their house wine and it was good too. The service was very professional and consistent. Although a little pricey if it weren't for the special they were  running, I would still come  back for the ambiance and food.

 First off, Bottiglia is beautifully designed, with a relaxing  decor yet as this fresh, hip vine. The staff is all gorgeous. The men and women. 

 We were lucky enough to be seated in the bar area, and had the most genuine & knowledge server named Kobee.  Kobee was not only completely knowable of the menu, but confident in giving his favorite recommendations which we ordered. And  very happy that we did. Thank you Kobee for being one of the highlights of this dining experience. You are a true asset. 

  Definitely order the tuna tartare, octopus, mushroom risotto, and the Mac-n-cheese! They're all delicious, flavors on point and worth the recognition. Hats of to Chef Brian Massie, who even took the time to come by the table, and chat. 
(Love the artwork on the arms Chef) 

  So if you like looking at beautiful people, in a chic setting, while enjoying delicious culinary art, Go try BOTTIGLIA. Make a reservation first.

4843244,2016-09-11,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"As soon as you walk through the casino's double doors, you are transported with delight to Bottiglia in South Hampton décor and will easily and momentarily forget you're at a local Station casino in Henderson, Nevada. 

Restaurant entrance is to the far east side of the Green Valley Ranch Casino. There's parking right outside or you can park in the garage. I recommend parking outside because you get direct access to the restaurant instead of having to walk through the casino. 

The restaurant décor is light and very South Hampton. It definitely appeals to the feminine taste. 

Twice I have been here and I enjoyed both times enormously. I seriously think everything on the menu may be excellent but I haven't tried everything so here's are a few items of note: 

Zucchini flowers - perfectly breaded and deep fried with soft cheese (not the plastic stringy kind) oozing out. Don't let the deep fried thing fool you because it was not heavy at all. 

Grilled octopus - with a squeeze of lemon and it's more tender than you think it's normal. That's actually exactly what my dining companion commented. So tender and not at all chewy; could it be tenderizer? (I don't even know if you can put tenderizer on octopus...) 

Short rub cavatelli - it's almost like a ragu but better! The short rib was shredded and cooked with the ragu and then tossed with perfectly al dente cavatelli. Then garnished with small dollops of cheese. It was the heaviest dish of the evening but so good! 

Pork chop - Perfectly cooked so it wasn't though. The sliced pork chop sat on top of a plate of green and tapioca-looking pasta. The pork chop was topped with diced fresh apples. You can never go wrong with pork chop and apples but this was beyond expectations and dining excellent. 

Tiramisu - my personal favorite! Served in a little Mason jar with shaved chocolate on top, I could just eat that for dinner! You can tell they use amaretto and it was so delicious. Not heavy at all and leaving your lips all greasy and slick. It was also served with two lemon shortbread cookies dipped in chocolate. Those didn't do much for me but maybe it's because I make better shortbread cookies than that so I may be biased. 

Service is good. You can tell they really try to make this a positive experience for you, so that's noteworthy. This may not be an issue to most people but it is important to note that the bathroom is right by the hostess stand with the door marked ""il bagno"". It's a unisex bathroom with private stalls and a common washing area. The first time I used it there was a gentleman washing his hands next to me and I kept thinking I went into the wrong restroom. Going to take some getting used to. 

I will definitely come here again and hopefully more often.",aQJtyvmZg3kCd-tfZ6PLeg,1,3,4,j856Tody6cWRZ_0jphLcVg

4949143,2017-03-12,2,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Went here last night with the whole family (6 ppl).  Arrived to a nearly empty restaurant at 6:30pm.

Ambience:
Based on the decor, it seems like they were thinking they were attempting to create a finer dining experience.  However, instead of Italian music, they played alternative pop - the best 'sing along songs' from the past 5 years.  Additionally, they had huge flat screen TVs in all corners, which gave it more of a pseudo-sports bar feel than a fine dining experience.

Service:
The server good - friendly and attentive.  No complaints here.  Kept waters filled throughout the night and checked on the table periodically.

Food:
Big disappointment.

It seems as though they were afraid to use seasoning in their dishes.

Usually, when trying a new restaurant, if we go around the table and ask everyone how their food was we get a few 'great' and 'really good' responses.  Tonight we had 'ok' and 'not terrible'.  Those aren't the responses I like to hear when spending $50/person.

As a note, we aren't a family that needs really bold flavors in our foods - just properly seasoned food that brings out and enhances the food's flavor.

I had the Prime NY steak.  Cooked properly (medium rare), but absolutely no flavor or seasoning - none.  First time in my life I had to add salt and pepper (and subsequently ask for some drawn butter) to try to add flavor to a Prime piece of meat.

Wife had the halibut.  Cooked properly, but again, no salt or other seasoning, so very lacking in flavor.

Daughter had short ribs - same result.  Lacked seasoning.

Two pasta dishes - one with sausage and one with short ribs.  Again, on the bland side.  Really lacked seasoning.

Side of macaroni and cheese had no flavor at all.

On the positive side, my son's caprese salad with burrata was good, and my daughter got spaghetti squash and she enjoyed that.

Normally, if we have a less than stellar experience we just finish the meal and move on - never to return to that location.  But last night was on the 'bad' side of neutral so we told the server at the end of the meal that it was ""really underwhelming"", with the purpose of just letting her know that the food had no seasoning.  She said that the chef got complaints in the past that the food was over-seasoned and ""maybe he just cut back too much"".

When she returned with the check, she said the manager removed a few items (two side items) for our discontent.  If the manager felt a discount was necessary, I would have expected a table visit to discuss.  Our main purpose of voicing the issues was so they could fix them, not to get 6% removed from our bill.

Overall, a really disappointing experience.",Wa5Sd_JuK4ws6CXNw_yDAg,2,0,3,z2s2uozXCQg3ti7PP6V3cQ

4958350,2017-05-16,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Really disappointed in my dinner at Bottiglia.  I think my expectations may have been a little unrealistic given the number of positive reviews, but this place just did not land for me.  Our party of three arrived around 6:45 on a Sunday and were seated immediately.  The space is nice, but there were TVs in virtually every section.  While I like to watch games as much as the next guy while I am eating, the TVs did not match the decor.

Service was okay at the beginning of the meal, then got progressively worse throughout the evening.  We were immediately served the gratis bread basket and our drinks.  Of the bread, the only one that was semi-memorable were the crisps with baked on cheese.  The remaining bread was average at best, but it was good at sopping up the sauce of the arancini.  This was a strong appetizer, probably the best dish of the evening.  Very cheesy and the sauce was seasoned well.  We did not let any of this dish go to waste.

The calamari was our second appetizer, and this one did not go as well.  To begin, it was either not fried at a hot enough temperature or was left in the grease too long.  The vast majority of the pieces were not crispy, some were downright soggy.  Additionally, the breading did not adher well to the pieces.  The red sauce served on the side was fine, and the cream-based sauce was very good.  But, the calamari was a miss completely.

It took an excessive amount of time for us to receive our entrees.  So much time the server apologized, which was appreciated.  

To eat, I went with the Caesar salad and the braised short rib.  That dish is served with ricotta spinach dumplings.  The short rib was good, but not nearly as tender as I expected given that this dish was braised.  I did not finish the entree.  I did, however, finish all of the dumplings.  These were pillowy soft and cheesy but had a very slight crust to them.  Very good, I should have ordered more on the side.

One in our party had the veal ravioli.  It came with 4 regular-sized ravioli for $26.  I am sure it was good, but that is too small for an appetizer.  I also know that the majority of Italian places have designed their menus so you order both a pasta and a main course.  So, I am not expecting a mountain of pasta in any dish.  But, when he only ordered the ravioli the server should have warned him how small the dish was.  

Finally, to cap off the evening, we waited more than a half hour before we received our check and were able to leave.  We just sat there with empty plates (or, more accurately, plates that were clearly finished because our silverware and/or napkins had been placed on the remaining food) for way too long.  

Perhaps we went on an off night, that can certainly happen.  Or, maybe I just don't get it given the number of Yelpers that really liked this joint.  But, this place simply did not land for me.  Also, I much preferred its predecessor, Terra Verde.  On future trips to Green Valley Ranch I do not think I will be returning.",JXHrhT72U6sZJQSkFfNzjw,9,0,2,JiEqRNzczv6Bz4392c36og

First off, they changed their bread as of last week.  It was awful.  If you are not a huge garlic fan, this bread is not for you.  I like garlic bread but this was something of an unspecified sort.  It had an odd, distinct taste. The only way I remotely knew it was garlic bread was the fact that there was a clove attached to the serving plate under the bread slices.  Regardless, it was bad.  Next came the entrees.  My friend asked for shrimp scampi for which they accommodated since it wasn't on the menu.  But, the portion was a joke in comparison to the FOUR SHRIMP it contained and the hefty price of $32.  The meat dishes such as chicken parm come a la carte. Everywhere else serves a side a pasta, at least. Not a huge stretch considering pasta is the cheapest thing! We asked for butter with our bread and the busser didn't understand English and totally blew us off. Finally caught a nice busser who took care of our request.  We ended the meal with cannoli. Big mistake.  The filling was runny and nothing like what my Italian family and I make from scratch.  The server was slow moving. We never had our glasses refilled until dessert.  All in all, not worth the visit.  The two stars are for accommodating the shrimp scampi request and for the service of two out of the three bussers.

For entrees, the King Crab Bucatini was great. The Meyer lemon cream made the dish and the pasta was a perfect al dente. There was a small amount of shell, somewhat expected given the crab is fresh but still you need to be careful. The Pan Roasted Halibut was perfectly cooked and the carrot purée complimented it nicely. The risotto was good. Only issue, there were a few bones in the fish.

The interior was super cute. It reminded me of a boho chic/ pier 1 aesthetic. The booths were ugly but the flower chairs were an absolute dream! Our service was great. Our server was extremely attentive, and helpful! I wish I got to try the other foods on the menu but nothing was less than $25.... I think this place should be ""$$$"" instead of 2 because theres no way anyone can afford to eat here on the regular.

I will be back for their oyster happy hour and to check out the patio area!",c2MQ_LPuvtiiKFR_-OY9pg,23,20,4,1s_PXNVQxEIi0sybsRuBdw

5109367,2016-09-13,5,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Such a pretty restaurant inside Green Valley! Bottiglia's light colors and soft lighting are a nice retreat from the low lit, garish decor of many a casino restaurant in Las Vegas. Beyond the airy decor at first glance, diners sit at shabby chic tables/couches/chairs, which gives the overall vibe that you're at a friend's beach house.

Just like the restaurant vibe, menu offerings aren't heavy or overbearing. Rustic Italian cuisine tends to be not to sauce heavy and there's plenty of easy breezy beverage options too. Whether you order the squash blossoms, burratta, or pasta dish, it'll be a nice sized portion but not gut busting or overdoing it. Might I also note that the branzino comes out deboned and without the questionable? It's all about the pretty aesthetics at Bottiglia.

Dinner for five with wine, appetizers, mains, and dessert came out to about $400 total. Had I taken advantage of the Yelp Check In offers, it would've been significantly less. Dang it, forgot to tell our server. But that just means I'll be going back when in Vegas again?",djxnI8Ux8ZYQJhiOQkrRhA,7,8,4,ngS8qRUCOcSv-xxwgapYzQ

I absolutely loved the interior decor and lounge area (not to mention there's also a killer patio) 

We sat in the lounge and ordered several items off the happy hour and regular menus. During happy hour they offer 6$ glasses of house red and white wines and they're actually pretty decent! Not your usual happy hour crap!

Appetizers we tried:
The Charcuterie plate, zucchini flowers, meatballs, heirloom tomato bruschetta and the arancini- they were all top notch. 

Based of off my servers recommendation, for my entree, I had the pappardelle with short rib bolognese. 
Pasta was extremely fresh and cooked perfectly. The bolognese sauce had large pieces of rich short rib wasn't too fatty or salty, it was perfect. 

The manager, Javier was very kind and you can tell he really cares about the restaurant and customers. All that to say, Bottiglia is still new but they've got their food, vibe and management dialed in! I will definitely be back",XnuuGtEl7E8syck0QhjO3w,9,8,5,ckFIGqa7okB046q00UNZig

The Guanciale (pork cheek) in the mac n'cheese is actually a little smokey, but pan seared and a little crunchy around the edges. It's tough to find pancetta that doesn't taste like packaged ham! They nailed it on this dish. The fontina Arancini are an awesome appetizer, and the grilled octopus is amazing but don't forget to squeeze the lemon! Server was friendly, attentive, and thorough.

The decor was beautiful, that's what my star is for.  The bartender was snooty, rude, and didn't seem to care about us since we first ordered water.  A big no no I suppose.  I started  (and stopped) with side pasta with marinara.  When she brought is out, it looked ok.  I tasted it, and that was the end.  It tasted like someone dumped sauce from chef boyardee over spaghetti.  I mean really.  No one came back to check forever.  When I told her I didn't like the sauce, she grabbed it away and didn't ask why, what she could get instead, offer to bring me a menu---nothing.  Rude rude rude. So needless to say I didn't even get my entree.  I can't begin to describe how pathetic their customer service was.  I would never recommend this place to anyone.

The Ambiance is one of the best in Las Vegas (top 3!) mostly locals would know because the restaurant is inside Green Valley Ranch Station Casino, away from the strip! Thank goodness. The feeling you get when you first walk in is so refreshing. It feels so welcoming, bright, happy, chic, and very classy! 

The food is phenomenal. Brunch items are great and not so overwhelming. It's fresh, it's trendy, it's relatable! The French Toast to die for, the hint of citrus makes it different than most. The omelet is delicious and you can create your own, the potatoes that came with it is crispy and taste great. I ordered the panini with fresh mozzarella and eggplant, very good mix and very Italian. Do order the White Sangria, it's on the sweet side if you like that (I do), and their Mimosa! If you have a big group, it is suggested to get the bottle and share it! Cost effective that way I think. The bread pudding is addicting, can't stop eating it. Love their Bagel Lox as well.

5181451,2016-08-02,1,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Hello and welcome to Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca. This excellent restaurant is nestled into Green Valley Ranch on the south side of the hotel next to the parking lot. This is a Brian Massie, Click Hospitality venture so we had high hopes. (not disappointed) It was quite busy and we were seated promptly. Seated back by the kitchen area we had a great view of the kitchen and the expedite pass. The head chef was at the pass the whole time and it was nice to see kitchen in action. They offer bar seating overlooking the kitchen and we were told that when you do this there is a special chef service. 
We arrived toward end of happy hour where beer and appetizers where discounted. I will say that service was prompt once seated and drink orders were taken. Appetizers we ordered the Wood Roasted Eggplant Spread and the Cheese and Salami Board. he spread had a sweat smoky taste and with the toasted garlic bread added extra zest to the overall bite. The cheese and salami spread was quite nice however at this moment I can't recall the names of the meat or cheeses, but they were good. 
Dinner, josie had the Pappardelle Bolognese. This was at suggestion of our waitress who was quite informed on the menu and taste profile of our dishes. The bolognese was very meaty and the Pappardelle is the only pasta that is hand made there at the restaurant. I had the Wood Roasted Pork Chop. Very tender and cooked perfectly medium as requested. Chop sat on a bed of Tuscan Kale with apples and pickled mustard seeds. We got a side of the Carbonara, Mac & Cheese. This Mac n Cheese was pretty amazing, and I am hard to please with Mac n Cheese. Peas, Parm and guanciale. Guancialle; an Italian cured meat taken from the pork jowl or cheek. This added so much to the profile of the Mac. Think using pancetta but better. Great dinner course and the whole time the wait staff was attentive.
Of coarse we had dessert. This jar of Tar Tiramisu layered in a jar topped with chocolate shavings. I had custard filled Doughnut holes with a red wine jam. Both were an excellent end to a delicious meal.
Thank you for dining at Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca. We will most definitely go here again. The staff was great food amazing. overall a great dining experience.

5253612,2016-08-10,0,YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"Well, I spoke too soon. Went for a return visit and it was about as lackluster as it gets. The meatballs had changed and weren't nearly as moist and flavorful. The salad tasted oddly dusty and when returned we witnessed the chefs taste it and offer up no explanation or apology for the poor product. Just strange expressions and a disposal of ingredients. 
The service was off putting and a bit rushed. 

Yes Bottiglia, yes.

I finally went with one of my girlfriends for dinner last Saturday evening after eyeing their photos numerous times. We were planning a night out and wanted to have a relaxed and comfortable environment to catch up in before we lost the ability to hear ourselves think. The interior of this place is stunning, it almost makes you rethink that you are in good ol' Las Vegas. Any restaurant that has comfortable seating at every table like Bottiglia's cushy floral patterned chairs gets a gold star of approval from me, take your all metal bar stools and hipster chic wooden benches elsewhere please. 

The food was good, not great (this time), but very good.  
The complimentary olive bread and honey butter were nice but the standard baguette was a bit on the dry side. We ordered the meatballs with burrata, the fried zucchini flowers and the carbonara mac and cheese to share. 
Meatballs $12- Fantastic, great flavor, tender and juicy but I found it odd to serve 3 small meatballs in a dish that isn't sized appropriately. It made it seem like someone snatched one from the dish and started snacking, I wouldn't blame them if they did. 
Zucchini Flowers $13- I loved the ricotta filling, the plating was simple but complimented the dish, my friend did mention and I have to agree.. there was an overwhelmingly strong lemon flavor. I love lemon and would order this again but for the non lemon enthusiast you might want to skip it. 
Carbonara Mac and Cheese $9- I wanted to love you. I really did. The guanciale in this ruined it for me, whoever prepped that component for the dish took it past crispy and into the not black but definitely charred bacon zone. When it no longer crumbles, instead it turns into a dark dust of bitter pork powder. We ended up picking all of the pieces out and ate the majority of it because why waste pasta?
   
We also had the Dessert Sampler $15?- 
Strawberry Pannacotta:, it was okay, the thyme was a tad overpowering.
Tiramisu: usually not my favorite but one of the better ones that I have tried.
Lemon Poppy Seed Donuts: best of the bunch and a nice way to finish a meal. 
Cookie: went straight into a bath of cappuccino, soak it up little buddy. 

All of the critiques aside, I have already told 15 people they have to try them out. Nothing felt rushed, everyone was attentive, not a single dish was bad and it was a beautiful environment to be in.

Went in two days ago, almost two weeks after they opened, for a late dinner.  Stepped in from the south entrance not the casino entrance and loved the patio seating.  They were not busy but it took a while for someone to acknowledge our presence until we flagged someone and finally we were sat in their patio.  

Bathroom: 
Beautiful inside the restaurant but you do share hand wash sinks with men so that caught me off guard but didn't bother me.  They do need a full body mirror in there. 

Food:
I was not to hungry so ordered light. 
We had to ask for bread.  
Once we got it - it was pretty good and the honey butter is wonderful touch. 


Roasted Tomato Soup:  
SUPER SALTY! Now, I love seasoning and am no stranger to savory salty dishes but I couldn't really eat it.  I had to water it down with water to make it a bit edible until I finally gave up on it.  It comes with a Panini grilled cheese and although ok in taste it hardens after a while.  Fail here.  

Spaghetti Squash:
This was ok as well. I would have preferred it with no tomato sauce as this softens the squash and then it seems more like a mashed spaghetti squash.  Flavor was okay but nothing amazing.  Also thought that for $9 the portion would be bigger.  Perhaps a call to your cousin chef Salute at Red Rock might help in learning how to improve this squash to perfection. 

I had also asked for red pepper flakes and it wasn't till I was finished with them that the young waiter came with them saying they couldn't find them yet they were sprinkled all over my boyfriend's clam linguini (which I tasted and also was too salty).  

I love the decor, food has potential but for the price, it surely needs to improve.  As a new Henderson resident, I prefer driving to Salute at Red Rock or around the corner to Ventano's for an Italian meal.  Hoping you improve it!",Xsr-K_8P-4D8-x_xeM4FdA,4,0,2,aSSvJsucSJHOAa7WEa2v-A

- the fried calamari appetizer was perfect. i dipped it once in the tomato compote then after with the cream sauce. omg crunchy, savory heaven. 
- my pasta dish was decent. i kinda wish my rigatoni was cooked more or was a fresh pasta but the sauce made up for what the pasta lacked. 

The bad:
- The live music was too loud for a classy restaurant. I'm not saying he was a bad singer, in fact we enjoyed him, however, he should've been playing at a lower decibel. It should be background music, not foreground. We switched our seating to outside so we can have an audible conversation with our company.
- no bread. they ran out of bread on a Saturday night. this was my biggest disappointment. I just don't get how you are an Italian restaurant and run out of bread. It's like having no rice in an Asian restaurant. bad bad bad.

Zucchini Flowers - Wasn't really feeling the lemon with the ricotta with the zucchini flower...ok dish app at best...

Arancini - Good....almost if not better than Nora's Arancini

Charcuterie - Is there really such a thing as a bad charcuterie plate?

Baked Gnocchi Arrabbiata - Sauce on this is fire with a little kick to it...the consistency of the Gnocchi may not be for everyone but basically it is similar to Japanese Mochi...fire

Sausage & Rapini - Spicy sausage over pasta which is fiarly good

Pan Roasted Halibut - This is a highly recommended dish...doesn't even taste like fish, seared well with a lot of flavor...excellente

NY Style Cheesecake - Done very well, big portion for sure

Donuts - Donut holes but far from the best ones I ever had...at this point in the meal it was too difficult to eat

Overall between the atmosphere and food this place is pretty good and a great addition to Green Valley's emerging roster as one of the best restaurant offerings in a local property.",aK_IdNCJUdk2haKC3GuM_Q,2,0,4,Q2z33momcXLXFEA49FiDzg

Our cousins asked us to join for dinner and we head no idea what to expect! Immediately upon walking in, we were impressed with the decor and overall feel of this new Italian restaurant. 

Food: being dairy free/ mostly plant based I'm always sketchy about Italian restaurants with lots of cheesy and meaty options. Luckily I was able to get their vegan Bologese which was delicious with chickpeas and almond ricotta. My husband has the veal Marsala which was good. It would've been nice to have a pasta side included with the veal, as it was only three small pieces of meat and mushrooms. The desert sampler was good; I did dive into the poppyseed donuts dairy or not. I could swim
in the strawberry purée sauce! 

Ambiance: the decor is very homey in the Bottiglia! It's super crisp and clean with beautiful accents. 

Service: the food runners were amazing and quick but our server wasn't the most amazing server I've ever had. She didn't find my little jokes funny at all and was just so-so.

We will probably be back to try a themed night or day since there are items I would like to try still!",ihTu74HkXnKGuY5v_Z8b0g,2,2,4,ZF5Mp4INhveEDeZ1YkEYqA

The décor and ambiance is a 5 star and the food is good (not great) but the service was really subpar. I had to ask for refill of iced tea, our bread plate was never brought out (finally asked for it) and no refill on coffee and at $4 a cup that was a real waste for the size of the cups. We noticed several tables that got more attention than we had so maybe since we are not locals or regulars we just didn't fit in? Even the hostess was a bit stand offish, not rude just not a warm greeting. Too bad as the place is really so pleasant to be in. If only the service was spot on it would have made the $150 bill more tolerable. Tonight was definitely not worth the money we paid.",kaPSLh_n3LRSJmuxWQNjPg,0,0,2,U-WmrkDhTp3nrZTwd8A3yQ

I started with a drink recommend by Heidi. It had a sorbet ice cream in it. Lovely, light and refreshing drink especially for a hot summer Vegas night. I finished with a chocolate and coffee drink which was just as tasty. 
We were full but managed to squeeze in a slice of their NY cheesecake. Wow, we finished it. Another great recommendation of Heidi's. So good and worth every calorie.

The biggest complaint I had was the bill!! I had a Dewars and it was $15. I normally pay $6 anywhere else. There were 4 choices of appetizers for happy hour, non of which I liked so ordered from the menu and payed $14 for caprese salad. Way too expensive and way too slow.

Fried calamari - this was a little greasy and they include fried onions and fried zucchini 
linguine with clams - this is good and I usually order this however, the linguine and clams at Bratalian is so much better.
tiramisu - served in a glass jar. I actually did not like this presentation very much and prefer the traditional version. Too much chocolate curls or something.
kids grilled cheese and tomato soup - my kid liked this

We've also been here for brunch and their menu is tiny. Not really my favorite for brunch due to the limited menu.

Ambiance: Really pretty, bright, white and pastel colors. Lovely outdoor seating option with flatscreen tv's. This is a nice place to take people visiting from out of town, in fact that is exactly what we have done on several occasions. I do feel that the ambiance is greater than the food. They need more food items and to punch up the flavor on the existing menu.

Service: We've always had great waiters here, very attentive and friendly.

Short rib cavatelli - this dish was excellent. It was recommend from our waiter. The ricotta on the sides made it even better.

 King crab bucatini - was very good. It is more lemons tasting so you don't have to much cream here in the sauce. Full pieces of crab inside the pasta.

Now All I have to say is What happened? The food was delicious and full of flavor, you could really tell the chef planned out the menu with delicious choices.  My absolute favorite main course dish was the Lobster pasta and The zucchini flowers was my absolute favorite appetizer.  Although I still strongly love the zucchini flowers I can't say much for the Lobster dish, maybe because last time I ordered it I was unimpressed. I attempted to devour the dish but couldn't enjoy it. It was so spicy that my taste buds were on fire- literally!  I was a bit disappointed that it was all spice and no flavor to follow.  I wanted to enjoy to enjoy it but sadly couldn't. I hope the next time I order this dish, they take it easy on the spice, there is alway a happy medium for spicy food and the dish was way off!  
I still have lots of love and hope for this place. It has a fun upbeat summery feel to it and the decor is absolutely beautiful, they also have a patio. The location is great it's at the Green Valley Casino. The service is great when they're not busy, which Pretty much all restaurants will fall into this category.

The line moved quickly when they opened and since HH is available in the entire restaurant we decided to sit in the dining area instead of the bar. 

I don't know who designed this place but its amazing. I can only describe it as a light & bright Italian country home. From the gorgeous floor to the tables and chairs its really beautiful and you will soon forget your at a casino. The open kitchen is also a nice feature. 

I ordered my free glass of wine with Yelp check in and it was delivered with a  nice selection of bread and homemade honey butter. Our waiter Raul was very knowledgable about the dishes and how they are prepared. 

We ordered the meat and cheese board, arancini and the meatballs. Like their neighbor Borracha all HH food and drinks are $6. 

The meat and cheese plate came out first with prosciutto, salami, a wonderful cheese (sorry forgot the name) and this incredible apricot spread that was served with crispy bread. Well worth the $6. Next was the arancini which was served on a marinara sauce. Filled with melted cheese they were good, but nothing spectacular. The meatballs came out next, again served with a marinara sauce and melted cheese. Like the arancini they were good but I much prefer the meatballs at pizza rock. 

Bottiglia has a desert menu with five selections. We chose the chocolate caprese cake. It was presently very nicely with a large dollop of hazelnut whipped cream and colorful flower petals. The cake itself was rich, dense and delicious. 

The service was casual and friendly with minimal time between courses. A definite add to my HH list!

I will try one more time as they are new and may be having growing pains",jJDEwznWHQIaT4Z0lIFl5A,16,8,3,4JN4KmLDd_KPMiKluUSocQ

We planned our day around it and arrived right on time.  My husband asked for a table.  The two hostesses sneered at him and said we'd have to sit outside--in 110-degree heat!  We declined, of course, but we were both just aghast.  If they don't want senior citizens in there, they shouldn't buy advertising aimed at us.",97qtFhyyK3-JWNRQXAG0Ag,1,0,1,x45Ed9q2zMp60liibDAL0w

At first sight the decor was beautiful , it was very bright and welcoming ! The place was calm and quiet the whole time we were there. Alicia was our server and she was very kind and friendly to us and the children in our group. She made sure we had everything we needed. The food, was amazing. I had a panini and I enjoyed it very much. It was very filling. I tried some of the hash browns as well, which were so good! Our whole table ordered them and let's just say that they were great! I had a wonderful overall time here and I would recommend it to anyone .",ieLepyNd4WMEnHdmEYleHw,0,0,5,2h7hG2OGZY4qEq0Bfq0yvA
