So we ordered cause someone had to be the first to say something. They skimp on meat but pile on everything else, there was a girl that extended her break by about 20 min I know this cause she went on break after taking my order and her co worker yelled across the room at her that she was late and that she was supposed to come back @6:10 it was 6:30. A line of people showed up at which every employee just walked by until.the manager had to be yelled at by his employee. Not to mention this girl touching/ ""cleaning"" with no gloves on!!

After scrolling through my Facebook newsfeed 17 times we get up to the window. We see a lady at the counter, I assumed her shift was ending because she had her purse on the counter where they take customer's orders and she was holding a banana...between her armpit. The guy came to take our money and hands us our food. We drive away, ready to feast! We get back to our place, I unwrap the cheesy goodne-oh what the hell! NO NACHO CHEESE....okkk....we eat them anyway. I pop one of the Cinabons into my mouth, bite down on the swee-oh god! Tasted like i was biting into a handful of sand. I take another bite-not sure why, but curious to give them a second chance. NOPE. Nope. nope. Now I've been sick for a few days *sniffle* so my tastebuds have been acting up.

So I realized they no longer call it the loaded potato griller, and that's why there's no longer bacon in it. No one told me this when we ordered. Was still too thin and flimsy to be justified. Also tried this place again and had another bad experience. When you order nacho cheese they skimp out big time and only fill it barely a quarter. Go to the one on west Charleston and town center. Way better, portions bigger, and nacho cheese was filled to the top!

We came here on Saturday and got a relatively small order. As we drove away, we noticed a couple items not in the bag. So we pulled over and went inside to avoid the drive thru line again. After pointing out the mistake, another 15-20 min later we get the items and leave. Please take a look at this flat sorry excuse of a ""loaded potato griller"". Nothing loaded about this. Its supposed to have bacon on it, but there's not. And there's only a few potato pieces, and cheese that's it. I usually come to this Taco Bell due to its location, but it's hit or miss.

1439930,2015-03-31,2,T00dMi_gQdyQkE9GKJFVSQ,"Dear Taco Bell, 

Tonight I really wanted a bean and cheese burrito with no onions. It's what I always order. I went through your drive thru and gave my order to the overly friendly cashier that you hired. He even repeated it back to me. Your nifty electronic screen had my order correct as well. 

Once I got home, I was very disappointed when I bit into my burrito only to taste what seemed like extra onions! 

Aside from being allergic to them, I cannot tell you how much I dislike onions. I instantly spit it out. I opened the burrito up and sure enough, they added extra onions. 

I would have went back, but my boyfriend quickly informed me that I shouldn't be mad at you nor should I have such high expectations for you. Personally I don't think excluding onions is a difficult task. It's not rocket science. 

On other occasions, I've ordered the 7 layer burrito from this location. It's never correct. It's as if you just throw all of the ingredients in a big pile on the tortilla and then fold it up. No bueno. 

You never used to be this way. Despite my dissatisfaction tonight, I'm giving you 3 stars because you once were good to me. Not sure what changed. 

In conclusion, I won't be seeing you again. I think your workers might be high... or something. I'm very disappointed. 

-Sincerely 
Sad Customer",IEQjRwcXUJQ4J-x4H6Nfsg,0,0,3,ubt4ZQFYukXpZKtnb05G1A

On this particular night when I visited this Taco Bell location there was a crazy line and that's expected especially on a late night weekend. I have to commend this location for the amount of time they were able to clear the cars out! There is nothing worse than sitting in your car stuck in between other cars hungry with no place to go. Not the case on this visit. Taco Bell is always running some kind of ad or have some deals and tonight was the $5 box. I think this has become pretty common across all fast food chains to offer these ""boxes"" for $5. Order was correct and no complaints!

Then I went for lunch today. The place was deserted except for one person who was waiting for his food. I had to wait for a while for the people in the back to tell the guy (the only one in the place who can use the cashier apparently) that there was someone waiting up front. The guy finally comes from around the corner and it looks like I woke him up or something.

Anyway, I order and get my food only to find out once I've sat down that they've forgotten my nachos. I go up to the counter again (prompting a 2-3 minute wait), and I tell them about the nachos. I point out to them that I can see the nachos sitting on the counter back there, but they insist on making a new one. Whatever. I sit down. The girls in the back were walking around with scowls.

The food was sub par, even for Taco Bell. They really skimped on the meat. 

There was an unfortunate couple there. They ordered just after I did, and after 15 minutes one of the girls from the back came out and said that they were out of ground beef. How in the hell is a Taco Bell out of ground beef? That also shows that even after 15 minutes, they STILL hadn't started his order. I was talking with him about the crappy service and he was getting increasingly more annoyed, saying that he'll never go to this location again. I can't blame him. 

Anyway, after about 20 minutes or so, I leave and that couple finally get their food. In that time, several groups of teenagers came in and while they were waiting for Lurch Addams to get to the counter to order, I told them that the food is taking forever and that they're out of ground beef. They left, and I felt like a hero for taking away from this location's business. 

To the owner: just because it's a Taco Bell, doesn't mean it's a good idea to get your labor from the local bus stop. Hire someone who cares and maybe your restaurant won't be a ghost town.",KQbr-p40xTdlwpkvgL-Kdg,0,0,1,nU-AaYpd7xG1vm3UZRdzqQ
