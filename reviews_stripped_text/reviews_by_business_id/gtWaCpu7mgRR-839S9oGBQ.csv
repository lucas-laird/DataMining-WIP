Of all the appetizers the hummus was the best but everything else was just bland. The service was ok when we actually saw our waiter. 

For a Hookah lounge I was expecting something a little more intimate and comfortable. I won't be going back to this place again.",4IOlM5-tYK1j_b_HcUclTA,0,0,2,Fs1X3d7e7qagX0YvxxT1SA

I think it's a cool place to hang out in the evenings; they have a DJ and have different events going on in the evening depending on the day.  (Last time we went, it was open mic night; some people are really good!)  I'm not a hookah person, so that may have some bearing on my experience.

I think they do reverse happy hour but haven't stuck around long enough to find out.  Last time, I had the Maxeki Margarita, some tequila concoction off their list.  It was ok, but tasted a bit like alka seltzer (thus bringing back horrible memories of Lolita's in Town Square).  I've also had the Falafel Pocket; the patties are good but the wrap was a little dry/hard.  The hummus is delicious and definitely worth trying.

All in all, it's a cool place to hang out, but the food isn't super great (or at least the times I've been there).  Also, once the night event start, it's impossible to have a conversation with anyone at your table, even if you're sitting in the restaurant section.  If you're there to eat with someone else and/or a group, it's probably best to go earlier in the day.",PMzMA8lz3TSQGnSSxbg3yA,0,0,3,AkaTel_nHhupFfucn3uphA

My wife and I visited the restaurant on a Friday night at 7 PM which is prime time for most restaurants, but a total fail for Laziza.  With all the cars in the parking lot (one shared with several other restaurants), I thought it might be crowded inside.  There only maybe ten tables in the dining room and only two were occupied.  There were a fair amount of people in the bar.  

I ordered a diet Coke.  Guess, what they were out of diet Coke.  So then I order an iced tea.  Ok, so then the waitress comes back and says they are out of iced tea, but delivers another diet Coke.  This one isn't right either (fountain not working correctly), so still not diet Coke.  So I asked for water, which I woudn't see for another 30-45 minutes, long after my entr√©e arrived.

The menu is supposed to be Middle Eastern, but contains Philly Cheese steak, Asian (Chinese) Chicken Salad,  Fried Chicken and Lasagna.   I'm no expert on Greek/middle eastern food, so I decided to try the samplers - the Mezza ((labneh, hummus, falafel, baba ghanouj, tabbouli, grape leaves and pita) and the Laziza Sampler (like middle eastern empanadas).  They were ok to me, but over priced for what you get.  

Service was slow (especially considering there were only two other occupied tables in the dining room), if you could find a server at all. To add to the ambiance,  there was an open mic night going on in the bar, and since the dining room opens into the bar, there was no sound barrier and was very loud, lots of bass and feedback. 

It was an overall unpleasant experience.  They never have to worry about seeing me again, but then again I don't expect them to be open much longer.",ltBVRx7tRA5SPRFFQCORCg,3,0,1,rWdbj852hIenR_1gSWlBcg

We ordered the Mezza appetizer (labneh, hummus, falafel, baba ghanouj,  Tabbouli & pita) The menu says it serves 4 and they are not kidding. LOTS of food!  A couple of beers and glasses of wine and our bill was only $22. Unbelievable!

1163618,2011-09-24,0,gtWaCpu7mgRR-839S9oGBQ,"I have been dying to try this place forever since I enjoy frequenting hookah lounges for the relaxing atmosphere and hookah. Finally my boyfriend and I came here for dinner last Wednesday.

When we came in we were seated right away in the bar area at a booth, you can choose no hookah and sit in nice booths like any other restaurant or I guess if you want hookah they sit you in the bar. There were 4 TVs blasting football and the bartender was sitting at the bar using his laptop. Given there was only 2 other small tables I don't blame him but maybe hide it a little? I am used to big cozy booths with dim lighting and a relaxing atmosphere, not a sports bar. Since I am not into sports at all this was a HUGE disappointment for me. But I took it as a new experience and thought I would give it a try. 

Their happy hour is pretty good, 50% off appetizers and drafts so that is a nice deal. We got very fast service and we ordered everything at once. They brought out our hookah and food at the same time, which is terribly inconvenient when you are trying to eat and enjoy your hookah before it burns out. The hookah tasted nice but they set it just on the end of your table so the hose gets in the way of your food on the small table.

The saving grace was the food! Yummy! I got the falafel pita & my boyfriend got the fillet minion kabobs. It was delicious! 5 stars for the food! Their hummus appetizer was average and I would get it again considering it was something like $4 during happy hour. 

They did have what looked like a hookah lounge in the back and had advertisements for 21+ nights with a DJ & such which looked fun but the chairs didn't look comfortable and it looked like an odd place to mingle.

I actually never came during restaurant hours, but I did come on several occasions after hours when the Hookah Lounge opened up for business. On Rebel Wednesdays, would be Reggae Night here, with performances by Members of Haleamano, Fortwentydaze, aboriginals, etc. It usually consisted of an all star band performing a reggae jam session all night! 

Drinks were nice and strong (in a good way), definitely worth your $10. They did continue to serve food in the lounge at night, a whole menu ranging from Tapas to sandwiches and salads. My favorite was the Baba Ganoush served with warm Pita bread and the Calamari. Occasionally I would reluctantly order the overprices french fries to help soak up the Alcohol. 

The hookah I believe ranged $15 for one Hookah, $25 Unlimited Hookah. I knocked a star off of this place because while its busy, flagging a waiter down to get a hookah could be a challenge. I've had to walk up to them and ask for the flavors list and request a hookah. However, throughout the night, (since we got the unlimited) they frequently will replace the coals and change the flavors upon request! 

All in all, this was a popular hang out for a while on Wednesday nights. I sad that I never got to actually try out their restaurant side, and sad that they are no longer in business!",CmPjoba7N2ZSa3goSsSN6Q,0,0,4,7xJlt12viqNXOyXOdwRc0Q

1714842,2011-04-03,0,gtWaCpu7mgRR-839S9oGBQ,"I get it.  It's a hookah lounge.  That serves alcohol, which is pretty rare nowadays in Vegas.  However I knew some friends who were throwing a party there and decided to go, mostly because they were boasting free alcohol for ladies for this private party.  

The place overall has nice decor when you walk in.  But then it gets confusing as you head to the back where the bar is.  There's an indoor ""patio"" and a huge room with nothing in it.  A few booths and a few tables, but it seemed really open and under-furnished.  

The bartender ladies were super nice and greeted me immediately, which is refreshing since most women bartenders ignore other similarly-attractive women.  The drinks (keep in mind they were free so I wasn't expecting amazingness) were really sugary and sweet.  I ordered a few jolly ranchers for me and my group of friends and although it tasted good, it left that sweet/sour taste in your mouth.  Plus after 10 of them, you start to feel a little sick from the sugar, and not buzzed enough.  

The music was some weird Reggae music.  Not good reggae, just weird pop-trans-throw-in-some-reggae-music. 

The hookah was good, and they changed the coals often, which was nice.  Overall my friends and I had a great, fun time.  Should go back one time to try the restaurant.",kK5G8Un_cGkm1Q6aXzdgUA,1,1,3,Zu1teF0Tz7dEgOHYKXgGMg

However, the hookah does not last long--maybe 30 minutes. It got really annoying to have to ask the bus boy to keep changing the coals. And even then sometimes it didn't pick up.  

I think either they're not using enough coals, not using good enough coals, or not making the water cold enough. It's an easy fix on their part--they've just got to do it. I'm used to the hookah hitting well for 1-2 hours with minimal coal changing. So, this issue is a big one for me.",AyLBaAJDdpJiQf11NTRe8A,0,0,3,9j0NH7DGbDzoU7_EQ5MUSg

3705433,2011-03-06,2,gtWaCpu7mgRR-839S9oGBQ,"I was very excited to go to Laziza after reading the Yelp reviews, but I left sorely disappointed. The ambiance seemed very inviting at first, until I realized I couldn't even read the menu it was so dark. It didn't help that the DJ had a terrible affinity for the Black Eyed Peas (no less than five songs by them in the two hours we were there) and other top-40 junk and the bass was jacked up so high, it was literally shaking my chair and my friends and I had to yell to have any chance at hearing each other.

I could have forgiven those shortcomings had the service and product been decent, but that's where Laziza really fell down. It took the waitress twenty minutes to get us our beers, and she didn't offer us water. We ordered the apple hookah and when we hadn't received it after forty five minutes, we approached the nearest waiter and asked what had happened. He responded that he would have to get the waitress. Twenty minutes later, she still hadn't shown up, so we had to track her down. She gave us a hurried excuse about forgetting it and eventually we got the hookah without enough mouthpieces for our group. It took us another twenty minutes to get her to come back, during which we noticed that the hookah tasted awful -- more like black licorice than apple. We pointed that out to the waitress, who assured us it was the correct flavor without bothering to double check. So we ordered another beer, which she forgot about, water, which she forgot about, and more mouthpieces, which she also forgot about. Meanwhile, we watched her spill a drink on a girl at the table next to us. Disaster.

Given our horrible experience with the service, my group did not want to leave a tip. However, because we had six people, she automatically added an 18% tip to our tab and we were sure if we asked her to take it off, we would've had to wait another half hour, so we just bit the bullet and left.

Once we arrived, to our disappointment, the groupon was not working! This was not the restaurant's fault but that was definitely a huge let-down. 

We ordered a handful of appetizers and a couple glasses of wine (half off during happy hour, great deal!) and they were definitely enjoyable; however, I've had phenomenal Mediterranean cuisine in Manhattan; therefore, I wasn't overly impressed. The entrees were disappointing :( Unfortunately, the kebab wraps did not have much meat in them and my friends didn't seem to enjoy them much. I had the plate of rice, salad, and beef (shawarma.. sp?) and the beef was a bit dry; plus, I asked for it as spicy as possible and it came out mild.

Service was fantastic. The waiter seemed busy but still managed to be attentive and provide thorough information on each of the dishes. He was definitely helpful when we couldn't decide what to order.

I don't smoke hookah, but I have been here a couple times to hang out with friends. It is a good location for me since I only live a couple miles away. The ambiance at Laziza is really cultural - a very nice place to hang out with friends. 

As other reviews said, they do have a live DJ. There is also a dancing area, but it is not crowded and packed like a club would be, so that is a plus for me. (For those of you who are shy about dancing and being seen, then it might not be something for you.) The DJ plays a mix of Arabic/Persian and American hip hop/R&B music. I personally think it is a nice mix. 

I also tried the filet mignon kabob, and it was delicious! The kabob also came with either a house salad or soup of the day. I tried the lentil soup, and that was also surprisingly good.

The table shared guava mango hookah ($15). Even though I lost my taste for hookah smoking a long time ago, I knew this wasn't premium tobacco and when I saw them lift up to replace to coals that there was quite syrupy stuff in there so it's probably a type of mu'assel, possibly even not tobacco based but herbal based but I would have to open the foil to really tell. It had a throat feel that I think I've grown to not find enjoyable. However, I don't deny the flavor tasted good.

Laziza is the epitomizes the all that a hookah lounge should be: dimly lit, DJ pumping out good music in the corner, a dance floor (which that night, was for vanity rather than for function), and a well-stocked bar with drink specials throughout the night. Our hookah had a mix of various tropical fruits (I believe mango and pineapple) and mint - boy was it smooth. I'm usually not a fan of hookah, but every time that hose came my way, I went to town. 

As for the drinks, so many stipulations to the drink specials. My coworker was disappointed he couldn't partake in two dollar vodka drinks since they were for the ladies - a stipulation he'd like to dispute! Also, in order to get all of these deals on drinks, you have to order at the bar - a detail overlooked by our waitress when we asked her and subsequently ordered from her. However, I'll overlook the fine details, for this is the only place where the bartenders and waitresses know what a White Boy is. Having never heard of it, my coworker ordered me one - a Blue Moon, mixed with some orange juice and a shot of Amaretto. One of my favorite drinks definitely - I've ordered it elsewhere, but the proportions are never perfected as they are at Laziza. As the night progressed, my crazy coworker ordered a round of Lemon Drop shots. What a perfect way to end the night - that is, after some dancing and a few embarrassing photos afterwards.

I now get the appeal of Laziza. Drink specials, dancing, and dim lighting leads to uninhibited actions, which in the case of my coworkers is both an excellent and dangerous thing.

The hookah here is not expensive at all. 15 bucks for 1 hour or 25 four the unlimited.,Rejpx97WKxJHT_t48jMA0Q,1,0,3,eWse_zcZTP6Kmx0H-4RzzA

The service was excellent, however apparently Friday night is open mic night, making it impossible to have a conversation without yelling over the music.
As for the important part, the hookah, it was subpar at best.  Having been smoking for years, it was really disappointing after all the awesome reviews.  Trying to get service to fix the harshness of the shisha was even harder with the loud music. I think I'll stick to making my own bowls to smoke at home.",sGKs7X_kbmdZzJ83NTtlww,1,1,1,kABzRK2Bx760sibP3JjEsw

The selection of appetizers are limited to the six that appear on the menu. The rest of the items are reasonably priced, if those do not satisfy. None of those small bites are over $10 during HH. There is hummus, baba ganoush, crab falafels, hot wings, and two mixed plates that are good for sharing. The baba ganoush was delicious and came with 8 pieces of pita to wipe up the goodness. The wings were standard, coming in an order of six. The hot sauce is made with the garlic chili sauce used in Chinese cooking. 

Beers and wine seem to be the way to go for their HH. My mojito would not be considered a well drink even if it used stock rum, and came out to full price. To get half off, the drinks need to be the simple well alcohol+mixer. Otherwise it treads on the line of a signature drink or specialty drink. The mojito was good nonetheless.

The service was mindful, with two different servers checking up on us often.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,0,3,V5f3rKu3l8Y-MzzW6wM4lQ

Walking in, the decor on the inside was very disappointing, we thought the place looked like a orange colored dinner. It was also empty, which should have been a tell that it was not that great a place. 
The waiter brought us the menu, The menu selection was pretty small for a Mediterranean place. I didn't really care as they seemed to have what we usually like. Well, they were out of two of the things we wanted... My falafels and my boyfreind's Kabob. How can a Mediterranean resto be out of those 2 items?
We ended up ordering a fattoush salad, the falafels-less mezza plate and some sandwich for my boyfriend. The salad and sandwich was not impressive. The mezza plate had a very good tabbouli, the  hummus was good but not the best in Las Vegas (as they claim) and I didn't care for the stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush at all.
The waiter was friendly, but overall the place was nothing special, had no ambiance, the menu options and food taste was pretty weak.  
I seriously doubt they will be in business very long. I don't think we will be going back. There are much better options for Mediterranean restaurants in the valley.",RyVLGD0OuQLbXmaACPN2jQ,3,1,2,Q2jRYRdHvTvSPs3OdL2XHQ

HORRIBLE service!

5550187,2010-12-07,1,gtWaCpu7mgRR-839S9oGBQ,"My husband has been hounding me nonstop since the Brazilian restaurant closed down and the sign for this place came up. I didn't really want to go, mainly because smoking anything doesn't appeal to me.  Finally, this week, I couldn't put it off anymore because we're moving in a few weeks to the SW side of town.

We decided to actually eat a a meal there and do the hookah thing.  I had a beef shawarma wrap.  It came with some nice garlic paste, which I have not had since I ate years ago at Zankou Chicken in Los Angeles.  The sandwich was pretty yummy, but it sadly didn't compare to Zankou.  If I were just to crave a pita, I would most likely go to Crazy Pita and not here.  This pita was griddled a little to get the wrap to form a slightly hard shell around the filling which was kind of cool.  The salad that came with it was fresh and light, but it went a little heavy on the red onion.  You can also get fries if a salad isn't your bag.  My husband had the shawarma plate, which was the same thing as my dish but decomposed, plus it comes it a nice plate of rice.  I'm not sure the flavors in the rice but it was pretty good.  The highlight of the meal was side of hummus I got to taste.  It was so full of garlic and very vinegary, that my hummus-hating husband actually really liked it.  

As for the hookah stuff itself, I had never done this before so I can't compare it to other similar places.  I wouldn't say I hated it but I didn't love it either.  We got the mixed fruit flavor which was tasty and it was very relaxing.  And it was happy hour so it was really cheap and worth it overall.

The service was good, the lounge area where everyone smokes the hookah is warm and nice.  If we were staying in this neighborhood, I would go here again.  They had Monday Night Football up on the flat screens, so this is a good place to watch the game and relax.  I""m not sure, however, if it is worth driving out of the way for.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,3,2,4,wkEfXZxKwD6ztd4mKHHHNA
5660010,2011-07-25,1,gtWaCpu7mgRR-839S9oGBQ,"After work last night (7/24/11) my friend Jerry J. mentioned that we should go grab some food. We both drove to our prospective homes and then he came to pick me up about 5 seconds later. Hmmm... where to go? He suggested Greek food because:
#1 he knows I like Greek food.
#2 he had never tried Mediterranean food (!!!)
#3 he's scoping the food out and if he didn't like it, our possible trip in December might not happen.

Let it be known, that just like the Mexican food scene in Vegas, with small exceptions, the Greek food scene in Vegas is limited to crap kai Kronos gyros. I wasn't sure where we could even get any sort of Mediterranean food at 11 PM. I remembered Laziza was close to our houses, so we might as well check it out. After he drove around the parking lot and down the street a few times (he wasn't sure whether he was going to try the food or not... he's VERY picky) he finally went for it and we went inside.

Umm... WTF?! WHY don't clubs in Vegas play music like this? They had the most FABULOUS hyphy/rap/hip-hop mix BLASTING when we walked inside. On a Sunday night, I dare say the music is better than even Vanity. Heaven. Pure Heaven. I walked up to a guy sitting in a little room off to the left and asked him if the place was open for dinner and he quickly jumped up,  and grabbed us menus and led us to a booth by the bar. 

It took a LONG time for a waiter to come over and take our order. Because I was asked to just pick whatever off the menu for both of us, I ordered the Mezze sampler for us to share ($20) and a gyro with fries ($9) for Jerry to try. It took a long time for the food to come out, the sampler coming out about 10 minutes after the gyro. Jerry, being like a fish out of water at this place asked me what everything was on the plate - ""that's shaved meat, that's pita bread, that's the cucumber sauce I was telling you about."" ""What's this sauce?"" ""Jerry... that's ketchup for your fries."" Hehehe. 

He said he really liked the gyro (thank God) but I can't comment on it as I didn't try it, but the falafel was the best I had ever had. Usually, falafel is dense and heavy, but these, when hot, were light and crispy. Yum! The tabouli was forgettable, the baba ghanoush, which is another dish I usually dislike, was very good. There were no dolmades, which were mentioned in the description, but rather two types of hummus, one being very smoky, and neither being that good. As well, the labnah is better at home and should have been served cold - it was too much like a runny dip in its warm form.  Everything on the plate, sans falafel and baba ghanoush is better tasting at home for sure. 

The atmosphere is great and if I could give this place 200 stars for the music, I would. I was dancing around in my seat and so was everybody else. Unfortunately, nobody was really on the dance floor, and I wasn't going to dance all by myself in a restaurant. I for sure want to come back with some friends just to grab a drink and dance. 

A mezze sampler that was missing the dolmades, a gyro, a diet coke, two waters + $7 tip came out to... $41. Ridiculous! The service was way too slow and should step up their game. The mezze needs to come down in price but I have to give 4 stars because I was going crazy with the great music and atmosphere. Definitely will be coming back.",OLn8EvPsu4hNug8V5PF2jA,1,1,4,6zn20W5cJNYcjvv6y5ESmQ

We didn't have any sugar, salt, pepper or ketchup on table so we had to ask for everything. They didn't have draft beers on tap even though the menu said they did. I will compliment them on their falafel which was tasty.",4arRGEGcg5vIAFCg7kbOgQ,1,0,2,4qn-wZgGp6uLbfyvnuE3ZA

As far as the little party appetizers went, I was a big fan of the hummus and pita bread served. 

Our function had a DJ so of course there was some mainstream music bumping, but besides that the ambience was dim and welcoming, a little cozy, and the hookahs featured were tasty. One of my drawbacks was that the bar was a little pricey, but then again it wasn't too bad given the atmosphere. Am definitely interested to come back to this place again for a 2nd and a more in-depth review!",5bT16QvBp6t33vIfqtJahg,1,1,4,BCGAS3Cmf5HQtLl-Q8kgxg
