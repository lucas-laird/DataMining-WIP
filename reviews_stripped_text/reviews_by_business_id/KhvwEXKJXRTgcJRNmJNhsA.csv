229899,2015-11-02,0,KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA,I liked the original crew that worked here when the place first opened.  The food is satisfactory but nothing compares to the chinese food joint I frequented in college.  The texture and taste of the beef is off.  I would go here again because of convenience but not my first choice since I found another place with better meat texture and taste.,C9QPC4Qs1tIhHUeeLYXfig,0,0,3,oNQ3QF5n1QO1bw7WEaeWSw

I am allergic to onions, especially green onions, and every time I order beef with broccoli by delivery they get it wrong. Just now I called and asked 2 separate people if I could get wonton soup with Dinner A. I am not feeling well and that is all I want, I don't care if I have to pay extra. Both people told me yes I could get it. I finalize my order and 40 min later I get a call telling me that wonton is not available with Dinner A unless I pay more. I explained to the guy that I asked that over the phone, was told it was OK, and was not charged extra. He told me I had pay the driver $2 extra..... I don't have cash on me. I told him to cancel my order and he told me NO you pay $2 to driver. 60 minutes after my call my food arrived and I had to give him $2 in pennies and nickels. 

Next time I want Chinese I will find a new place or just stick it up and go to Panda.",m7tbUTasCy9WS5b_BJ3tgg,0,0,1,1bQxW2TtFzRZGG25g3F7uw

The hot garlic chicken is also generic, the sauce is really watery nd that's what has the flavor and the chicken and vegetables and drenched into it .

FIRST TIME experience an hour ago today. Placed my order for pick-up via GrubHub at 5:19 PM, because their restaurant is available for services through this website, as well as Eat24 apparently.

My husband went to pick up the order at 5:50, since the time stated it would be ready by between 5:45 - 5:55 PM. The food was NOT ready, and they state they never received the order at all, and that this has happened many times in the past with other orders placed with GrubHub, and that he suggested he contact GrubHub at the time and just cancel it so that we can reorder everything at the restaurant and pay with cash. This is irritating, as much as it is an inconvenience. 

If this keeps happening before, FIX it! Had to go to the local Panda Express because we had no time to spend with each other for dinner before my husband leaves for work til 4am if we decided for them to cook our food, and being irritated with them does not help with us patronizing them.",rYaNXtg_5upyfjeDkK1yIg,0,0,1,-gGSSdOJAlLn27lZ6xpJIA

I truly was in love!! It was love at first taste!! It is one of the very best tasting chinese rice I've had in my life...I am eating some as I write this review...It is so good...Like one's body needs fresh air to breathe...Delicious is an understatement...I tried their chow mein but it was not my favorite...The real winner here is the combination rice and it is very affordable at about a lil over $7 and (can feed three to four people) I'm looking forward to trying their duck and other dishes and will update my review...In the meantime I say run don't walk!

The location is still fairly new, and you can see all the way to the back of the kitchen. Every time I have peeked, things always look clean and nice. Service is good, and if you dine in, they do check on you to make sure you are enjoying your meal.

The main thing I can tell you about Wan Wan is their product can be a little spotty. Hit-or-miss, if you will. For example, a few dishes like their Hot and Sour Soup, Pad Thai, Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings and Combination Chow Mein are great. Balanced flavors, fresh and filling. 

But then I will order something else and it won't be what I was expecting. Like, the Mu Shu Pork, Sesame Beef and the Shrimp with Lobster Sauce were all misses. Somewhat inconsistent.

Another inconsistency was the Boba Smoothies. I used to rave about them all the time, because short of driving all the way to Chinatown, these were a gem! They were actually close enough to me to not have to make that annoying trip. But the last time I visited, I ordered my usual fave, a Taro, and it was watered down to hell!

3896815,2014-09-20,0,KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA,"Note: I only give out 5 stars to surprisingly EXCEPTIONAL, best-in-class establishments.  

After driving about 5 hours from the LA area to my in-laws' home in Vegas, I placed a pick-up order since my wife & baby were tired from travel.  (I only say this because it might affect the taste/quality of the food since it took me time to get to the restaurant & about 15 mins. to drive back.)

We ordered the General Tso's Chicken, Salt & Pepper Pork Chops & an order of sauteed bok choy (at least, that's what I ordered).  I would have given this place 4 stars since the food was surprisingly good, but I have to subtract a star since I experienced something that annoys me about many Chinese restaurants: you don't get what you ordered.  When I placed the phone order, I had a convo with the order taker that led me to believe I was ordering sauteed bok choi--I received sauteed cabbage (NOT bok choi, more like napa).  Chinese cabbage can refer to both types, but bok choi is only one type of the two.  If you don't have bok choi, say so, and I'll order something else! 

Nonetheless, the food was surprisingly tasty, with a decent amount of spiciness and not too much sauce.  Despite the bok choi issue, I would order food from China Wan Wan again.

The restaurant is nice and clean, the service was good, and the menu is big enough to satisfy anyone's Chinese food craving. I should point out that this is an American Chinese restaurant in a strip mall on Boulder Highway in Hendertucky, those craving ""authentic"" should head into Chinatown. 

The food was prepared very well, came out very quick, not oily at all and I was happy that my 1 1/2 year old found somethings to enjoy :)

Ordered:
Cashew Chicken - I always order this extra spicy and they delivered as promised. Really enjoyed the flavor and the chicken/veggie ration was excellent. Could of use some more cashews.

Shrimp Mu Shu - If you like fried egg, then this Mu Shu will be right up your alley. Yes, there was plenty of shrimp, but instead of the rest being veggie filler there was a real good amount of stir fried egg.

Beef w/string beans - served in a black bean sauce which was nice and garlicky. Again, good meat/veggie ratio and this was one of the dished my little boy loved.

Hot & Sour soup: More flavor than some of the other places, the only way it could of been better is if it had a bit more seafood in it.

Egg rolls - A free bonus. They call them egg rolls, but if anything they were closer to spring rolls as they didn't seem to contain any meat. A little oily by nature, but they kept their crunch through the night, this was the other item my little boy really enjoyed.

We are definitely giving this place another shot, their half roast duck looks good and we really want to try their fried tofu dishes.",HAFTRawn2sz909EbdVt5wQ,0,0,4,3jMhMzgMx0oH0AEFNP7r3w

But hey I give the owner credit he let me know that the air conditioning was broken and he profusely apologized. 

Just because he did that I gained a lot of respect for him. It's kind of like EVERYONE see's the Pink Elephant in the room and nobody says anything about it!

So I ordered the Kung Pao Shrimp and my wife ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken lunch special which was because it was still considered lunch time.

I got a Thai tea with boba and it was really tasty, we decided to get the food to go and if you order the lunch special they don't serve it with soup to go because the containers they serve it in are not very sturdy so I opted for an order of egg flower soup which came with a better container. 

The owner said it was more of liability  issue which I could see after he showed me the cup they serve it in.i wanted some and was willing to pay more to take some with me.

The food was still pretty hot since we live relatively close 2.5 miles away, I liked my Kung Pao Shrimp. My wife didn't like that their was too much tempura on the Sweet & Sour Chicken and the rice didn't really have no flavor to it and the noodles were too thick. I have to agree with her on the rice and noodles.

The first time I stopped in I ordered spicy garlic chicken and a bowl of hot and sour soup. I had a cold and was looking for something to clear my sinuses. This lunch did the trick though my appetite at the time was not up to my regular standards so I didn't start out eating much more than the soup and a few bites of my garlic chicken. I took the rest home and ate it later. As before, the spice did its job in helping me to breathe again. Not that it is actually so hot. Just enough. Overall, good flavor and a fair portion. A lot of chicken and vegetables.

Second visit was last night. Again, not feeling so well, I was craving some Chinese. Chow fun noodles to be exact. If you follow my reviews you know that I love chow fun. Especially when my stomach is iffy. The noodles tend to calm the beasts within. Chow fun is not overly seasoned and fairly easy to digest. This is no exception. Maybe a little more salty than I am accustomed to (soy sauce I assume) bit still not harsh or off putting. The chicken was a little over cooked and the noodles were a bit clumped together but this was a pretty good dinner. Like the garlic chicken before it, the chow fun did the trick and I felt pretty good when I was done eating.

China Wan Wan is not exactly one of my go-to's when I want Chinese food but it is on the way home and pretty well convenient. I'll be back.",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,3,1,4,UwBEihZC9EP30iY3oXopaA

B's pics, check-in comments, and review that created a mental balloon that said ""You have to China Wan Wan.""  In the near future I'd pop that mental balloon when I stepped inside China Wan Wan. I'd end up liking it so much that I would return a couple of more times. 

   China Wan Wan is in a small strip mall at the southwest corner of Boulder Highway and Russell Road. It is not a stand alone Chinese restaurant. It is a small Chinese restaurant in back of the Popeyes Chicken. 

   The lunch specials are a fantastic deal. They start out at $5.95 and top off at $6.55. The shrimp based entrees are the highest priced ones. A Coke beverage brings the price up to around $8. The lunch specials include a cup of soup. They are served in a styrofoam  plate with the entree, fried rice, and soft chow me in noodles. Before they serve the food to your table, you can look into the open kitchen to watch them make the food. To the left of the counter and open kitchen is the Coke soda fountain. 

     China Wan Wan is more of the take out environment than a full service casual dining Chinese restaurant like The Lotus or China Bistro for example. Here, there is no visual candy like a Buddha statue, pictures of China,  or place mats of the Chinese New Year. It is a take out atmosphere with sufficient seating. Anyways, the food is the eye candy. 

    On my visits,  I had ordered the peppersteak and shrimp chop suey. The peppersteak was really good. The meat was juicy and tasty. They interspersed it with the right amount of onions and pepper. The shrimp chop suey was also delicious. The shrimp were sufficient in size and portions. The representation of vegetables, mushrooms, sauce, and ingredients complimented the mushrooms. The fried rice was of good quality. The soft chow mein noodles were tasty and far better than what I have tasted at some Chinese restaurants where they are filler food. The choice of the soup that comes with the meal is either egg drop or hot and sour soup. Both are good, however, wonton soup would be great. 

    Friendly people take the orders and bring the food to the table. Everything I have been here, they greeted me right away and were friendly. 

    China Wan Wan is China Win Win. When you dine here before 4 pm, you come up winning with delicious Chinese food and Coke for less than Panda Express. I am sending you the reader a mental balloon that says ""If your in the mood for a good Chinese lunch special when your in the vicinity of Boulder Highway and Russell Road give China Wan Wan a try.""

The food is very good and authentic.  Special are always a great deal and the service is just as good.  Ordering directly is best and they do deliver.  I find picking up my food to be faster and easier.  Again, don't need to be flashy, just taste good and they do it right.

5606650,2017-07-02,0,KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA,"My husband and I have been ordering here for years and my husband orders enough where they recognize him when he walks through the door. I was hungry and had not eaten in over 24 hours. I decided to order from a place that had never let me down and I like the food. This time I was let down. Not by the food, but the lack of customer service. My order was $43.00 (told you I was hungry). I ordered the crab rangoon, beef Nd broccoli, fried rice and hot and spicy chicken. When my order arrived, rather quickly, I couldn't wait to dig in. When I opened my order I found that they gave me some chicken dish with vegetables. That was not what I ordered. I immediately called China Wan Wan as the delivery guy had just left. I told them they got my order wrong. I ended up talking to three or four different people telling me I ordered spicy garlic chicken. I repeated no I ordered hot and spicy chicken (cooked completely different). The guy on the phone then says that he will make sure I get the hot and spicy chicken next time. Uh no I ordered what I wanted I don't want this chicken. I then got transferred to another person who tried to make me keep the wrong item. I said no again. He then proceeds to ask if I ate the wrong item and I said no because it's not what I want and they can have it back. He then proceeded to argue with me and say that I ordered the spicy garlic chicken even though I was looking at my receipt that said hot and spicy chicken. I then told the man look I will show your delivery guy the receipt. The guy then said well I will have him come deliver your chicken. They finally brought me the right chicken. I won't be ordering from here anytime soon. I may have to start looking for a new spot.",PSc3miQpdYkdrpJUThvquw,0,0,2,Y3Xo9HUmhuNbdiUf3kCFwA

5820570,2014-09-06,1,KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA,"Was craving Chinese and decided to order the closest one near my place for our friends. I placed an order over the phone and the guy was very courteous and friendly. From the order I called in to the door delivered, it was quick within a 30 minute span for a large order. 

Had it delivered and it came to the door, Bay Area style with grocery warehouse box. It was like Christmas. lol

The Honey Walnut was great, placed on top of crispy lettuce. The shrimp size was generous and the sauce was very tangy/sweet which complemented along with the candied walnuts. I think this was my favorite out of all the orders. 
The beef meat for this particular joint, is very tender and soft whether it's beef broccoli or any entrée that has beef in it, which was okay. 
Orange chicken was tasty but nothing to commend on. As far as the kung pao chicken, it was OK; large chopped veggies and small chopped chicken pieces. 
Also the Hong Kong crispy noodle was great, it came separated with the special house sauce (shrimp, beef, chicken, veggies in special sauce) in a container by default. 
The salt and pepper pork chops was great as well, I'd say it was not as 'salty' as other Chinese joints are when it comes to the salt & pepper theme. Crispy and not too salty, gave me a bonus star for that. 

Overall, along with a free large combo fried rice, the food was piping hot & fresh and with the speedy delivery, this joint gets an all 5-Star for me. Would I say this is best chinese joint ever? For some it may, but for this joint, I'd say it's the best in delivery and large, generous portion-sized for its affordable price. Try it, it won't disappoint for the non-fancy Chinese food connoisseur.",TyeU40zAsjgRR7wIjvzsFg,1,1,5,3s1CYlLAhgAgAGK6uYM15Q

The food tastes fresh and the isn't anything around on the east side that can compare. It's the best take out/delivery. They are usually pretty quick with their delivery as well. We love the orange chicken, cashew chicken and spring rolls. You won't regret giving this place a try!",jZ97LaB2IhC9clweDrJpPg,1,1,4,wBNztv5vMnUzpkm6HdRefQ

5915511,2014-04-18,2,KhvwEXKJXRTgcJRNmJNhsA,"Decent Food. Good Customer Service.

We ordered the salt and pepper chicken wings and while they were tasty, it was like they added five spice seasoning to it and well, I just didn't expect that on Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings.

Beef Chow Fun is alright. My noodles were a bit too soft for me but it had decent flavor.

I ordered a shrimp dish and it was very plentiful with shrimp. I was actually surprised by how much.

What i love here is the taro boba. For $3 bucks and some change you get a very large drink. That makes my belly very happy. They also mango and strawberry flavor but I have yet to try those.

Overall, China Wan Wan is good to me. I will continue to order from them if chinese carry out strikes my fancy.",U0WU9d6gpMNkO_tPXK58Sg,2,4,3,YA-KIW9SXc4cIN_5DjwZ3Q

The dish called Teriyaki chicken was dried up turkey meat covering mushy vegetables. Not edible, and the Sesame chicken was the same dry turkey deep fried in mushy batter. The sauce was ok but after trying the so called Teriyaki I could not get myself to finish it. Waste of money, completely disgusting!!!!",DN4UP-5EHYEU0LBI-5tdzw,0,0,1,H9p5tAHTSfCxj_t6lPz9ew
