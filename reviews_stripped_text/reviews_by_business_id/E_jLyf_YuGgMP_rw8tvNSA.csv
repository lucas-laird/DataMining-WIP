A $100 order at a pizza place is like 5 pizzas? The place was EMPTY! The kitchen was staffed? I don't get it?! that's honestly bad business and we won't be back.

402130,2017-07-03,2,E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA,"I was bait and switched on the type of pizza I was getting. On the website they have a picture of a wood burning pizza oven. So since the picture was on the website I assumed that's the oven from this location. Wrong! They have a conveyor belt oven like the ones mostly associated with the poor quality chain pizza joints.  Pizza was chewy and the onions and peppers were very sparse.  I paid almost $19 for the 14 inch pizza that IMO should be half that amount for the type of pizza you get. I think it's highly unethical to have that picture on your website when you don't have anything close to Woodfire pizza!  Wow I actually just read the rest of your description right above the Woodfire oven of the places that you have consulted/worked. Those are two of the top 10 pizza places in Vegas and 550 at Aria being #1 in Vegas. Had I read that before ordering and eating your pizza here I would have been even more disappointed. No way you can be in the same stratosphere as those two places with a conveyor belt oven.  I guess you want to keep going with a rude response!  It's a scam that you have a picture of a wood burning oven if you don't have wood fired pizza!!! Prices down 35% off of what?  You have a chain pizza type pizza and you're charging a premium pizza price! You need to learn to take constructive criticism or you have no chance to succeed. The pizza I got was over sauced and had few toppings!  Bottom line there are no quality pizza chefs that would ever use a conveyor pizza oven. That's left for the 16 year old ""chefs"" cooking at Chuck E Cheese. Please name one quality pizza place in town that uses a conveyor pizza oven?  Conveyor pizza ovens are for amateurs and rookies. Name a single place that uses a conveyor pizza oven and charges your prices. I told you that my favorite pizza place in town is five fifty at Aria. Your prices are very comparable to theirs size for size and they obviously have 10 times the overhead as you. I have no problem paying for quality, conveyor pizza is garbage!",s2IdcrEaVGGB0m57cqxw0A,0,0,1,7uH6WHXM0e0Ip8MOqXXX4g

Niko and Dorian are seriously the best guys you could ever want to meet and Niko is a pizza artist. Seriously awesome. What also makes them great is that everything I've ever tried from them has been amazing. Chicken wings, salad, their Italian sub with the housemade ranch is excellent. They make their caeser dressing too! 
Downside is that they usually aren't open for dine in, only delivery, waits can be long but beyond worth it for quality pizza. 
Reheat at 425 for 8-9 minutes in the oven and the pizza is just as good as fresh but the crust gets super crunchy and its good. I'm not a leftover pizza lover but i do with this pizza. 
Nicest guys ever with the best pizza. Our favorite is classic pepperoni or pepperoni, bell pepper and bacon. Niko does perfect proportions of toppings and its never messy. Toppings are laid just right and there is this perfection when it comes to the sauce, to crust to cheese ratio.",H9AjU4X3GV8GQycJVLdP_g,1,1,5,_JFMyUMQq9JJWutU9sI8xQ

801733,2017-05-14,1,E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA,"This was my first and last time to try this restaurant.  I ordered online to pickup through Eat24. The app said my order would be ready in 20-35 minutes.  I arrived at the restaurant right around 20 minutes later.  There was a delivery driver and one other person who I assume is the owner, cashier, cook, waiter, dishwasher all in one.  I told him my order and he pulled it from the computer for the first time.  He then told me he will make my pizza next.   I took a seat and waited 10-15 minutes.  When the pizza was done he gave to me and then as I'm walking out the door he told me not to come so fast next time because now other orders will be 30 minutes late.  My response is that there won't be a next time.  A restaurant with one person doing everything can not succeed, especially if that one person chooses to get upset for someone paying his establishment money.

Just realized this is my sons yelp account but that's okay! Was finally able to get my hands on a pie from Niko's pizza got a L pepperoni. The restaurant is so cute and clean. Niko and his brother are hilarious and so polite! The pizza was bombbbbb!! One of the best pizzas I've had in a long time and their ranch is freaking crack so good I could drink it which they told me they make their ranch themselves. New favorite pizza spot will be coming back over and over again for sure! Thanks guys! 







Unfortunately wasn't able to order from nikos today due to having a large order and expected time given but still would like to give a review based of the customer service I received from Niko himself over the phone. Although our conversation wasn't even 5 minutes I appreciate how nice and honest Niko was. I was going to order an XL pizza but given the time frame wasn't able to I really appreciate Niko being honest with me and not just taking my order and money and not give me an actual expectation. I have yet to try the food but have no doubt that it is amazing based off the other reviews will definitely be trying nikos asap!!!!",oDpYifys5VQZ8eLOzHGL6Q,2,1,5,c4O08v_zjRP2PY65DAE9DQ

1273103,2018-06-04,0,E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA,"Went to visit my old high school friend who lives in Vegas a few weeks ago. Apparently, she is a regular customer of this Pizza joint so one evening she said she would be ordering us a Pizza and salad for dinner. She told me about how this place has a bit of a funny way of doing things, (extremely long wait times during the typical ""dinner time "" an the restaurant itself will close for eat-in business and to walk-in orders) so we actually called to place our order a good 2 hours before we would actually be hungry and ready to eat. 
This worked out perfectly fine and I can honestly say that this was the best pie i have ever had the pleasure of eating! I had 2 slices as a ""midnight snack "" and I had another slice for breakfast the following morning. The next time i visit her, we are DEFINITELY going to be ordering another pizza. If i lived in Vegas, i would be a regular as well. I briefly read a few of the negative yelp reviews, it looks like the time it can take to receive your pizza is what some people are put off by. Bring from the bay area, California, admittedly Niko's way of currently doing things is odd BUT it is a mom and pop and these 2 men are busting their butts to make this Pizza joint great. The food is AMAZING an the owner is a sweetheart!  Niko, if you read this review, keep you're head up, don't let the haters get the best of you, you have an amazing product, work ethic, and soul. Hope to enjoy another one of you're pie's again soon and when i do, ill let you know that I am the one who wrote this well deserved 5 star review!",LeQa_-45n-M3_z9_TBl69A,0,0,5,Sq_gDnzc0a6IlncTJMfvsw

Excellent quality of pizza especially if the one who made it is passionate about it. This place is not just your ordinary pizza place. Utmost respect to the owner who takes pride with his masterpiece. Met Dorian on our way out. Both of them were really nice. We definitely recommend the place. We'll try the BLT next.

Response to the owners reply:
Thank you for validating my review of your attitude.
Now you're calling me a liar.
Based on YOUR history you have a habit of personally attacking anyone who posts anything negative about your business-again, missed opportunity to make things right. (Added photo of response to your aggressiveness toward another Yelper Kim; who is an Elite). 
And this ""liar"" spoke with Yelp and GrubHub about her experience and advised them to speak to you to get accurate information so this doesn't happen to another patron. I also received a refund and future credit from GrubHub due to my poor experience and for that...they will continue to get my business and have my confidence.
I look familiar because I came INTO your store on Saturday.
I'm not ""with"" anyone and not sure who you are referring to as being in cahoots with to hurt your business.  Yelpers follow other Yelpers -that's how it works, our connection is only to experience good food and great service.  The latter I can definitely say needs work.
You did NOT EVER offer to waive the fee as you say and my review is truthful based on my experience as are ALL of my reviews that I have taken the time to write. I clearly stated that the review was based on your attitude and not your food.
And hanging up on you-well after having a pointless conversation with you and your not willing to help-or stand by what was listed on YOUR business listing-pretty sure was warranted.
Clearly-you are the aggressor as demonstrated in how you react to criticism.
Not sure what you ""delivered"" as I never received any notifications or updates on my order...cancelled it with you (after you finally found it)....did you really think I'd want to accept or eat it after our conversation?
My review is to help you assess how you react to customer issues-which you clearly must improve-it is not to hurt your business but help.  And it was clearly written to avoid misrepresenting the quality of your food...which from the 5 star reviews must be good.
It was the 5 star reviews that made me go out of my way to physically come to your store and when that didn't work, order delivery from...
Your pie could be made of gold and you couldn't give it to me free at this point.
If this is how you respond to any negative review-get ready because I'm confident your attitude will result in many more subpar ratings.
 

***WARNING*** Do NOT order through YELP or GrubHub if you expect to have free delivery even if you put your address in and are taken to order/delivery page and it shows FREE.
And don't expect the owner to give a crap that his information is inaccurate on these sites or to waive $5 to keep a possible customer. (apparently only free within 4 miles-no mention of anywhere!) owner states Grubhub/YELP at fault-well they can only print what info you provide....and you could have waived the $5 or offered a credit toward next order.
Also, physically went  to the pizza place yesterday and was told you had to preorder and pick up later-no onsite service.
Can't tell you how good the pie is but what I can tell you is if it is anything like the owners attitude...it's sucks.",huXqrSaGyNO1aZKiM55EUg,1,0,1,6F1EKa1Z1jDstKPxwushoQ

This place is GOOD.  The pepperoni pizza is delicious and so was the garlic cheese bread.  You can tell that Niko is really passionate about what he does and is very confident (rightly so) in the food he makes.

Yes, Niko's is a small operation so you will probably have to wait a little longer for your pizza than you do at Domino's.  But quality takes time, and trust me, this pizza is worth the wait!",USbfD7i0BwAcHymoNpLHvA,2,1,5,BA1loryYMCpDpgPzwXNchw

When I came in today, I was apologetic because I know how it feels when you`re getting ready to leave and get that last order. But they have reassured me that as long as they are in the restaurant, I do not need to hesitate to call and order. The customer service is amazing, and just the whole atmosphere is so warm and welcoming! I will never order a delivery, just because I want to come in and have a small talk with the owner and the manager. 

Now, when it comes to pizza,  I will never settle for anything less than Niko`s. I am kind of indecisive when it comes to ordering food, so when they heard what I was trying to order, they made a suggestion to satisfy my cravings.  Pizza with bacon, ricotta and roasted red peppers is a must try! But even if you order just a regular pepperoni it will taste like something you`ve never tried before. 

When you call to order and pick up, they always give you realistic expectations of how long it`s going to take to make the food. They also will give you a call when the pie is in the oven, so you can start heading over for a pick up. So if you are not ready to wait for the best pizza in your life for extra 10-20 minutes, please don`t ruin this amazing pizza parlor for us by posing negative  reviews - it`s hard enough to find decent pizza in Spring Valley, and this place is just 5 minutes from my house.",JbHcGfqHJTmItSmmQViX2A,3,1,5,kIv3l4J2kT1bkWAsXzAPJQ

Drove about 5 miles from my house to get it and I will do it again in the future. 

My pizza was half pepperoni and half pepperoni with additional basil and feta cheese on the other half.  Nice to change it up a bit instead of getting the entire pizza the same.  Also, the crust is really good.  I usually don't eat the crust (to reduce my carbs) but THIS crust can't be resisted . 

Also, the LArGe pizza is quite a generous size ""Large"".

Hope they don't change anything and this new restaurant will be successful.

Placed an order for delivery a little before 6pm. I ordered the niko special, medium, 8 wings with ranch and a calzone with mushrooms, pepperoni, and olives. The yelp confirmation quoted 45-60 minutes. It was 730 and still no food. Gave them a call and the owner apologized and said he was waiting for his driver. Food finally arrived around 740. The pizza dough was tough and overly sauced and the sausage pieces were so small that they just burnt and got hard in the oven. The calzone was missing the pepperoni (which they charge extra for, as they do with all toppings). The wings were the best part but still not great. Owner was very apologetic (which I appreciated) and said they were short handed. That's understandable and maybe the quote from yelp 24 was not entirely accurate so that could be an error on yelps part and not the restaurant. But an apology can't really fix bad food. The whole order was $55 including delivery fee and tip. Which is a lot to spend on bad food. Delivery delay aside, the food itself wasn't good. We just ate some of it cuz we were hungry but probably won't be eating the rest. You don't usually regret deciding to stay in, but we did today!

Mind you, to say I'm passionate for pizza would be an understatement. I prefer head over heels for pizza. Any who, on to my review. If I had to use only one word to describe my dinning experience, it would only be 'DECADENCE."" Yes, Niko's Pizza is pure savory decadence. I have had the luxury to spend many summers in Italy, and with that being said I have high expectations for my taste in Pizza. This by far is the only Pizzeria that comes close to giving you the true intoxicating taste of Europe. Each bite is full with an abundance of invigorating delightfulness. The cheese used, is bursting with flavor. The olives are completely delicious an leave the most wonderful aroma that will have you feeling like Zeus and Aphrodite themselves. The tomato sauce, well, that just leaves me absolutely speechless. So delicious, it's unbelievable. I'm completely in love with this place and it's heartwarming ambiance. The staff is also very welcoming, friendly, and helpful. It truly is a family owned and oriented restaurant. Which is quite evident with the uplifting customer service. I highly recommend this place to anybody who truly loves Pizza.  As the Italians would say "" Uno non può pensare bene, amare bene, dormire bene, se non ha mangiato bene."" Meaning, one cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one hasn't eaten well. So trust me, you will definitely be eating well here.

3208655,2018-03-25,2,E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA,"This must be a fairly popular pizza joint. Smelled good but never had a chance to order anything. After walking into the restaurant through the propped open door, we waited in the empty dining room for 5 minutes listening to the phone continuously ring off the hook. Finally one of the proprietors stepped out and informed us they were closed because they had too many delivery and pickup orders and that if we ordered, it would be well over an hour. Knowing that there is a Grimaldi's right up the street that operates off of a business model capable of handling mass volume, we dipped out and headed north. The proprietor informed us we should call ahead next time to ensure he could accommodate our order. I'm not sure if that would really work since, as I mentioned earlier, the phone rang off the hook without ever being acknowledged. My advice to anyone wanting to dine here would be to plan on ordering something for pick up and call it in about three days ahead to ensure the 3 Amigos with one oven have ample time to get your pizza made.

EDIT: no worries about staying customers elsewhere as we will never be back your way. Advertise as a stand-alone/pickup-delivery joint as that is clearly what you are. Get a bigger ""Closed"" sign. The 3 Amigos reference was in regards to an old movie centered around 3 well meaning friends who get themselves involved in a situation that is over their heads, as you clearly have in regards to operating a business. You need business help as you have limited understanding of customer service or how to operate a money producing enterprise as evidenced by the repeated ""we are poor"" statements. The good news for the 3 Amigos is that they found a way to be successful. I wish you luck and hope you can find a way to grow enough to afford more employees, air conditioning, and another oven as it sounds as if your pizza is good and deserves to be made ready and easily available.

Edit 2: kudos to you for providing for your family. I am sure your mother and father are proud that they raised a hard worker who likes to throw petty insults at people when they call him out on the flaws of his business model. Again, I seriously wish you luck, small business owners are what makes this country great.",_oPJ_SpoWrjS-oy9IZldrA,8,0,1,onep-opGxVBwpMDM0UmCow

Shortly after posting my review I was contacted by Niko himself via Yelp messenger, he offered me a replacement pizza which I politely declined. I write my reviews not for a free hand out but to share with my community good and bad dining experiences. Niko had explained to me how serious he takes the process of making his pizzas and felt in disbelief that I had a bad experience. I would like to mention that I had ordered on New Year's Eve and that I understand that's a very busy night. I still stand by the description I posted on my earlier post viewable below because in no disrespect the pizza was not up to par that night but I did want to mention that an owner that shows so much care towards his business and customers does deserve a 2nd or maybe depending on how good the pizza next time multiple chances. I increased the star rating based off of my experience speaking with Niko to 4 stars for 100% customer service. 



***Reading the reviews may have set my standards a little too high for this place. We ended up getting a large pepperoni pizza and wings. I'll start by saying the wings were actually really good and had a nice crispy skin to them and the sauce was very tasteful. The Pizza being the disappointing item was mostly bread barely any cheese nor sauce and the pepperonis didn't really have much flavor, I think it may have just been baked too long. I wont be going back only because I tried a neighboring pizza place called Carmines and it was absolutely on point.

We have been looking for a good pizza place for what seems like decades and I think we found our home. To experience patience and impeccable recommendations while ordering, to feel welcomed upon entering, the care and time put in to the food, the use of quality ingredients, and the fairly priced product all combined is truly a diamond in the rough. We plan on exploring the menu further during our next visit and spreading the word! Thank you for providing such an establishment for the valley!",p0HoZhH1mkQ5xrOEJ1hXFw,1,1,5,rkULs7HWvLD0oyl6J9-3rQ

I would have been fine with a discount. I would come back because they made an effort to make the 2 hour wait time for us right by not charging us for the meal. After finally taking our food home to 4 hungry kids and a toddler we all thought the pizza was very good by far one of the best pizza I have ever had. I will be going back for the delicious pizza but mainly because they made an effort to make up for the 2 hour wait time. Owner said they had many orders and only two of them working. Next time I call in to eat I will make sure their not too busy and they have enough employees to work for the day. 

Horrible!!!! I called for pick up one extra large specialty pizza and one large cheese pizza with an order of wings. The guy told me he has two orders ahead of me and said it would take 45 minutes. I said that's fine I don't mind waiting 45 minutes.....I called at 553 arrived to pick up at 645 so i arrived over the 45 minute time frame only to be told that it's not ready he needs another 20 minutes. 20 minutes? I shave to wait for my order for over an hour is just insane it's not delivery it's pick up.

4030414,2017-04-08,0,E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA,"This is easily the best pizza place in Summerlin and Spring Valley. Trust me, I've tried basically every place in the 89148 and surrounding areas and have not found a place that gets the crust (tastes like bakery fresh hot bread you would be happy to butter and eat alone!), the cheese (lots of it, white mozzarella thickly coated), and the sauce (rich and tomatoey, with a bit of sweetness and ""tanginess"" if that is a word) as good as I've tasted anywhere in my 6 years in Vegas. I'm originally from the east coast so this reminds me a bit of some of those style pies. I actually met the family when I went in to pick up my pizza and the mom and the pop and the kid and staff were all back there making sure everyone was getting served in time during the busy after work hour (I ordered at 6 pm). The wait was only 50 minutes which sounds like a long time to some people, but these guys have a process to make their pizza and 50 minutes on a Friday night during rush hour is spectacular for this good of a pizza! So to wrap this up- the experience I had talking with this family really impressed me as another small business owner. They are the genuine real-deal kind of business owners we need around here-folks that take care of their customers like they want them for life. It made me wish the absolute best for them in growing their new business. Mediterranean families seem to take great pride in the food they serve to you and that sensibility is not lost here! Mom even gave me some homemade baklava to take home! I have Lebanese background from my mother's side and she wanted to see how I liked it and let's just say they need to put THAT on the menu too! Overall great experience and they will go far if they simply keep the product like it is! I've been here about 6 times now and I'm happy to give them a deserved shout out.

I did a search on Yelp and it gave me several choices all of which I didn't know because my diet has never and never will include Pizza.

Anyway, I saw this place called Nikos Pizza and in all in yelp style I looked at the one with 5 stars knowing that has no real influence of the experience I was about to experience.

The yelp app offered a service called eat24 that would handle the whole lack of character thing with a few thumb taps, so I did it and ordered from Nikos.

As the time went on I thought 'hey, why don't I call Niko and see if my order went out, so I called.

To my amazement, Niko himself answered the phone. He assured me we were in process and thanked me for doing business with him.  I like Niko now. 

Then, a knock at the door and 'whala' a hot piping Niko pizza is at my door.

4868103,2017-06-11,0,E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA,"My wife and I recently bought a house on the southwest side of town. As pizza lovers, we usually try to hunt down the best pizza joints around the area. We've tried Carmine's before so we decided if there would be a better spot and we're glad that we stopped by Niko's after browsing a few pages on Yelp. 

Let me start that I'm usually very picky when it comes to pizza. I can tell if the toppings and the dough they use is either fresh or the typical preserved garbage. 

We stopped by for dinner around 8pm on a Saturday night. Niko and his server greeted us and made us feel very welcome. The place is very simple with a cantina vibe to it. Very cozy and nothing too fancy. First thing we noticed is that Niko is very passionate on what he does and when it comes to his pizza, he makes no compromises as he tried to explain to us with a little backstory and how he got into pizza making. Customer service is definitely on point. 

My wife and I decided on a large meat lovers. Let me tell you right now that their sizes here are frickin' HUGE. No complaints there and I'll welcome any left overs to take home and pig out later while I'm gaming. 

Be prepared to wait a little bit since they chop everything in house for your order; meats, veggies, etc... If you want fast pizza, go to Pizza Hut. I don't mind waiting for good ass pizza. 

We didn't mind the wait and while they told us it was gonna be awhile, Niko gave us a complimentary Caprese flat bread (I think that's what it's called?) to chow down while waiting. Take note: this is customer service at it's best right here. 

Pizza came around 45 minutes later and boyyy let me tell you right now that this shit is on a different level. The crust/dough is perfect, the pizza isn't greasy (my pizza pet peeve) and just the right amount of cheese. My fat ass ate 5 slices and my wife ate 2 and we still got left overs ... And if you're a ranch lover like myself , do your self a favor and order a side. It's bomb.com ... 

Closing remarks: My wife and I will definitely be back... That ranch is crack sauce ... I might give delivery a go but I forgot to ask if they deliver by Blue Diamond and Ft. Apache area...

Our pizzas were done by the time we wanted. Super fresh & were a hit at the party especially the BLT must try! This is a small company so if you're looking for fast half ass Pizza don't bother. They love to take their time and pride on every order to make every pizza perfect. They might not have people inside the restaurant but they get hit with tons of online orders so if they're telling you it can't be done till an hr from now believe them. They want your business but they do not want to sacrifice the quality of their pizzas.

Ok so I am so pizza happy right now!
This is a must try spot that will have you craving pizza over and again.
So I really went back and forth when I first placed my order as my confirmation was an hour and 45 min delivery time, my first instinct was cancel and order something else quick as I was starving and when I called (several times) they didn't answer I got worried, so I emailed asking them to cancel as the wait was too long... 
so glad I did not cancel!
Niko called me about ten minutes later in response to my concern and explained that it was just him and his brother working the restaurant and that until the business is more established they are working every angle themselves and this is why it might take a little longer for delivery.

It is sooooo worth it!
Niko was kind, very honest with why it was taking so long and to top it off I was able to try the organic milk desert, just like his mom used to make.

So, if you have time and want a great quality pizza that tasted so fresh and mouthwateringly delicious, then you will not be disappointed!

We ordered just a quick pepperoni pizza and garlic cheese bread and the Greek salad with so many fresh tomatoes, we had leftovers only because there was so much food, but happily so as it gives us dinner as well.",O5HTtmTZ9RHMkWPwXvyKRA,4,4,5,voqSYKH1bEQu5RBRIerlpQ
5257461,2018-06-28,0,E_jLyf_YuGgMP_rw8tvNSA,"Ok so lets get real real right now. This spot is the real deal. It's freaking amazing and not just because they have bomb ass food. They also have bomb ass service. Im going to lay it out so stay tuned through the end of the review.

Food: pepperoni pizza and mild garlic Parmesan wings
I have to give it to them. Definitely the best pizza I've ever had and I've run the gambit of pizza from New York style in NY to deep dish in Chicago, this beats them all. The ingredients are so fresh and delicious. First bite I set the slice down and just kinda thought about how my life just changed. It was so freaking good and piping hot after being delivered at like 11:30ish pm. They definitely know how to serve up a pizza. As for the wings, I've had many types of wings as well. Wings are wings ya know? But the Mild sauce mixed with the Garlic Parmesan sauce was a flavor combination that just flipped across my tastebuds. Like I wasn't ready and was beyond pleasantly surprised. I would highly recommend that combo to any wing enthusiast! Now finally we come to the home made ranch. Like.....I don't know if I can ever go back to regular basic bitch store bought ranch. This shit was ranch crack and I'm upset about how they fucked up ranch for me. I'll never be the same. I'd buy it by the bottle. Is that possible? Let me know!

Service: ok so yelp told me that Nikos closed at 11pm so pregnant me was like.....hmmm 10:15 is the perfect time for pizza and sent my boyfriend to go over there. So I hadn't read the reviews and didn't realize how long it would take initially. Once I started reading I saw the 1 star reviews and was like....oh shit. BF is already sick and he's just the type to start a scene in a food establishment if the staff is rude and stuff and I sent him to this busy ass spot late as hell..
Well to all you haters out there. Y'all can eat a dick for talking mess about this spot. They were beyond amazing when they didn't have to be. Boyfriend gets there to order me what I wanted, they apologize and let him know it'll be at least 45 minutes to fill the order. Knowing that my fetus is like my picky ass 2 yr old right now he placed the order anyway. Not only did they upgrade our pizza size for free, they didn't charge us full price (lack of change) and offered to delivery to us. They were so apologetic. Y'all 1 star haters had me thinking they were just going to straight reject the order and stuff but they were so nice. They were even able to deliver to us a little bit before the 45 minute mark and the pizza was as hot as if it just came from the oven. My boyfriend went ahead and stopped at the gas station on the way home just so we could give them the difference that they didn't charge us for and a tip. I appreciate good customer service especially when it's so easy to be a shit human these days.

Final assessment: I would rather go and support this local business and wait 2 hrs for a pizza then go to dominos, papa Johns, Pizza Hut, etc.  You can literally taste the difference and the quality. People don't take the time to make food like this anymore. This is passion and artistry at its finest. I understand that people may have had bad experiences but I also recognize that some folks are too impatient or selfish to recognize that a local business who makes mouthwatering food can't just bow to everyone and shell out food like a Burger King. Quality takes time and I won't knock a good business for being good and getting a ridiculous amount of customers. I'm sure they weren't expecting this type of response and it's a testament to their work ethic and quality that people love them so much. So I'll gladly wait the 45 min to pick up my food if it means helping this business thrive. Much love and respect to the owners and their families should be proud.",SkCd0ZkiFJXk5cbsRlfpdw,0,0,5,cJlchUynOmt_EgCbkcmkOw

My suggestion would be to either eliminate delivery service as an option, as it took an hour and a half for the delivery the first time I ordered, as well. Or, contact the customer and let them know that their delivery will be significantly late. I have worked in the restaurant industry and understand that you can get in the weeds, but you always try to keep your customer informed.

Looked nothing like the pictures and not a sprinkle of cheese to be found, even though its supposed to have asiago on it (according to the description AND the pictures). Mostly tomatoes and large pieces of red onion.  Plus, they have some nerve not including any dressing when you order a salad and then charging you $1.25 for the tiniest container of ranch I've ever seen.  Will not order here again.  Disappointed.

Update 4/15/18:
Niko, I received a voicemail from you just a little while ago.  While I appreciate the fact that you realized the error of your ways in your initial reaction to my review and are offering to make it right, I would like to point out to you that my personal phone number and address were provided for the purposes of a delivery made to me on friday night.  They are not for you to use to call me personally or show up at my door.  If you continue to contact me by phone or if someone representing your restaurant shows up on my doorstep, please understand that you will likely receive a visit at your business from metro police dept.  

My advice to you would be to focus on the constructive criticism for your future orders and customers and reel in your need to continue pursuing one customer that didn't particularly enjoy the food that your restaurant made.
