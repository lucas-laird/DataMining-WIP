Long version of this review: I made a yelp account just to write this review. This is the worst taste I've ever had in a restaurant. I ordered Spicy Tonkotsu Miso Ramen, the broth tastes decent but the bamboo shoots taste horrible and smells gross. They don't taste fresh, they taste like canned bamboo shoots you can buy at China Town. The thing that upsets me most was the Buta Shio Bukkake. My girlfriend ordered it and it was nothing but udon noodles in clear soup with three extremely thin slices of burned grill pork and three sticks of green onion. The soup tastes like boiled water with oil and burned smells, and the worst thing is that it costs $9! I will attach pictures at the end of the review. It was so bad that I had to ask the server to take it back. The restaurant let me order something else instead. I ordered Chicken Karage Don, which tastes blahhh at best. The chicken tastes so bland and the miso soup that came with it tastes horrible. The tofu in the miso soup tastes like it hasn't been washed prior to cooking. I don't understand how they can serve food that tastes so bad to customers and charge this price. It's ridiculous.
Overall, definitely avoid this restaurant at all costs if you don't want to ruin your appetite and waste your time and money. I would not even eat the food there again even for free.",K0P230eWl4Ad_hmQGdd0dw,6,0,1,apMpGSZtm0GFqTp6glLXoQ
82291,2016-09-20,0,SzzrUeJGnl_LQAJXMK8wQw,"The food was decent. Dining area was pretty clean. That's the only reason I'm giving this review a two star. The roaring music the employees play are explicit and very offensive. The kind one should be listening using a headset or played at a rave party. Not a place to take children, family, aunts, uncle, grandparents, or even discuss respectable business. Regardless if a restaurant is $ or $$$$, background music should not be inappropriate. The content of lyrics played during a late lunch with my 12 yr olds twins were obscene, indecent and profane. The owner should have a sign on the door about their inappropriate music so children or anyone  who wishes not to be an audience to this type of surrounding can opt out. This place seem to be overpowered by a group of young careless inadequate staff. Is it recommendable? I wouldn't put my name recommending this place, there plenty ramen places that are worth earning your business like Ramen Kobo on Durango/215.",eehTX2tvKForsYHBSsj0eg,0,0,2,xYck6tGy9ChS39dS0iLrjQ

I have had a few appetizers and the fried rice and they were average at best. This is why I'm giving 3 stars. I would recommend the tonkotsu ramen and the spicy version if you like heat. Great broth and delicious pork.

They've only been opened for less than a week so the place is a complete mess and disorganized. We literally waited for 25 minutes for our ramen to come out and it wasn't even that good. I'd rather wait 45 minutes at Monta to get seated and eat some good ramen. 

The kitchen was so backed up. They brought one of the appetizers we ordered and it was wrong so I sent it back. They gave us a complimentary vegetable tempura for the messed up. I kept on hearing the servers apologizing for their kitchen being backed up but yet the servers couldn't keep up cleaning the tables, waiting on the tables, and serving the customers which I didn't understand when there's 5 of them and since there's no food coming out of the kitchen. Our ramen finally came out 25 minutes later but we still never got the wrong appetizer that I had sent back and the other appetizer we have ordered. I might give them a chance months down the road if their service improves.",7U2cOebWk-KZWhrlqCBIvA,8,2,2,verf_8RUujCjQRaFVlpAvg

Layout: I hate the entrance!  Open the doors to tables. Customers (including myself) stop at the entrance looking left and right for the hostess stand. There is none.
Food: I only had the zaru soba (cold buckwheat noodle) and a Calpico.  So it's hard to judge the quality of food based on an easy dish. I guess I'll say it was acceptable.
Service: Servers were polite and there were no long waiting periods.
Menu: OMG There are so many different types of Japanese food on this menu I wonder what they can handle it.  One order could be ramen and the next could be a katsudon. The cook(s) have to be really talented to switch gears like that. Finally, I found several misspellings on the menu.  I addressed it to the server and he said he will pass it along to the manager.

Like both restaurants, Omoide has a plain exterior and a beautifully decorated interior.  Unlike Soyo and Oyshi tho, I think Omoide needs some work on their food.  I ordered the Karaage chicken but it was a bit dry and tough to eat.  My friend ordered their cold soba noodles.  I normally don't like soba noodles since they tend to taste funny out here in Vegas whenever I've ordered, but his was surprisingly good. If they spend their time tweaking with the menu by specializing just a little more, I think Omoide could become a gem of a restaurant like her sisters Soyo and Oyshi.",OXuL4nKwbBUw6lIH5EUngA,0,0,3,xcnT4hlNaacxUf6t8jGASQ

I ordered a udon bowl and the wifey ordered a donkatsu plate. After waiting an eternity my food finally came out first. It didn't just taste like instant udon but I think this is what they were really serving. Flavorless, soggy shrimp tempura, and one small fish cake. I finished my food and my wife never got hers. I asked the waitress if her food was on its way and she apologized and said she would check on it. She didn't give us an update and came back 10 minutes later with the food.

I love this place, I love their food, always good service, but today was horrible!
the server who are working opening sheet today, she was so rude!
why she shift responsibility on the customer?
she keep charge for her mistake even we said several time when we placed an order.
she seems she don't have any knowledge about menu and common sense at all!

I asked to my husband to call them to make an order and pick up.
He keep saying Not a ton katsu-don, we want to only ton katsu! but she can't understand. I thought she barely understand English. 
Anyway when my husband pick the order, she give him donkatsu-don, so my husband explain about we want donkatsu, not a donkatsu-don.
and guess what she saying?
""Next time say order king tonkatus"".

and we have to pay for tonkatsu-don too.

The decor is so adorable with Japanese accents. The restaurant only had a few patrons when we arrived, but my daughter spotted a couple of seats at their bar, so that's where we enjoyed our first Omoide meal. :)

Menus were ""served"" on clipboards.  Extensive menu for a little place!  I had a hard time deciding what to order, but being that it was an unusually cold day in May, I knew I wanted a hot bowl of noodles!  Although I was excited to try the ramen, I ordered the Shrimp Tempura Udon and my daughter ordered the Tonkatsu Miso Ramen (I knew she would be able to spare a few bites for me to try their ramen noodles as well).  We also had the garlic edamame appetizer.  Everything was really delicious and plated (bowled) beautifully!  Our soup was not super hot which was a little disappointing, but not enough for us to send it back. We ate it anyway and honestly we were both very happy (and full) with our meal!  

Of course their service was a little scattered, which is expected of a new restaurant on only its second day of business, but I'll be back to check them out after they've had more time to get used to their own menu + perfect their service.

A bit of sweetness from the corn, but the cheese didn't impart any addition. The buta shio soba didn't really add up either.

I got their hot green tea. It was pretty decent. But then again how can u mess up green tea?? OK traditional matcha tea is a whole different story...... Lol (4/5)

I got their onigiri as an app... It looked pretty... But the flavor was non existent. The daikon was salty salty salty...(2/5) but it helped the onigiri that was bland bland bland....:/ together they were OK... But the crab mix just had no flavor and the rice was overcooked so that it was on the mushy side and I'm sorry but who wants mushy rice in their onigiri?? (2/5)

I also got their tonkatsu shoyu.... And I know that shoyu is a Japanese soy sauce.... But still there should have been more balance in flavor. It was just salty salty salty. I'm seeing a trend here. Too much salt and not enough other flavors. It was not balanced at all. Did I eat it? Yes I did.... I was starving. :/ but did I enjoy it... Sadly no....:( 

Service was ok seeing as how I was the only person there. :) but I still had to ask her for a refill on my tea (4/5)

Ambiance.... It was cute. Same layout as when it was Rice Traxx but better decorations! :) (5/5)

Will I return... Most likely no... I would rather drive to Jinya or to other ramen places in the Chinatown area.",L3DxG0n3lRq5N2lv1QNrrA,4,2,2,JPHfHT_CBFIPb2r6gfJhBQ

Ramen was al dente, egg was perfect, compliments all flavorful. The soup is definitely lighter than Monta's and less salty. Which I don't think is a bad thing at all. Just different styles. 

Think this will be my new midnight spot after work. I'll try a few more things and update my review.

A few months after its launch, Lexus faced a potentially disastrous recall.  What could have been a major faux up actually helped to define a level of customer service people now closely associate with the luxury car company.

Our first visit to Omoide was kinda like that.
Although it was laden with way too many silly mistakes for a super slow lunch (food delivered to wrong table, missing orders, etc.), their level of attentiveness and speed in fixing our orders thereafter saved them from a far far worse review . . . the food also helped out a little.

I had the spicy tonkotsu with extra chasu: good broth, decent amount of heat, okay noodles, and good chasu.

The wife had the veggie miso with extra corn: tasty veggie broth and a good amount of greens and things.

Now I'm not saying Omoide is anyway like the Lexus of ramen.  All I am hoping for is that the ramen stays tasty and that next time we go things will go more smoothly.",vRjVhl3ONG2GfWY4NXJZbQ,43,36,3,9s-8wsh4_-lUCGHyjk1iUA

I tried their udon instead of the ramen (which I had last time) and I prefer the udon. The broth is better and the noodles aren't the thick udon noodles I've had at sushi and other Japanese restaurants. I like that you can add extras like wakame and fishcake (or tempura among other things).

I'm also a fan of the umeboshi nigiri, which if you're from Hawaii is basically a musubi with ume in it. I don't see this on a lot of menus and although it's a very simple item, I love it! Probably because it reminds me of home.

The toppings get nice amount like any other Ramen spot in Vegas. Ramen it starts and ends with the broth. Unfortunately did not work for me. Next time I will try order Shoyu broth. The Curry Bowl that was five star experience!! It Japanese style brown curry. Right off the back my favorite style curry. It delivered on point!

On my first visit, I had the lunch special with tonkotsu shoyu ramen, curry bowl, and an iced green tea. The ramen was quite yummy: the noodles were cooked perfectly - not too soggy yet not too hard; the chashu had a lot of flavor; and I had a nice helping of green onions to go with it. I'm not really a fan of the big piece of seaweed in my ramen, so I didn't really care for it. The curry don was your normal japanese curry with rice; nothing too special. Finally, the iced green tea. Let's just say it was so watered down it seems like I was drinking green-colored water. At least it was free with the lunch special. Lol.

My second visit I had the shrimp tempura udon, the chashu don, and a hot green tea. Warning: don't expect to get the thick udon noodles you're used to. Think the  thinner dry instant udon noodles you can buy at the supermarket. Also, they literally dunk your shrimp tempura in the broth, so by the time it gets to the table, there is no crisp to the tempura anymore; just soggy tempura wrapped shrimp. I didn't really care for the udon. Next was the chashu don. The sauce of the chashu gets soaked into the rice and it just makes it SO much better. Let's just say the chashu don more than made up for the disappointing udon. I practically licked the bowl clean and wanted seconds! As for the hot green tea, let's just say I was letting it cool before drinking it. About 10 minutes later, the waitress came and switched it for a new steaming hot green tea! I was like, ""Uh... I was waiting for it to cool before drinking it.""... I guess +1 for above and beyond customer service? LOL!

We stopped in to Omioide and went with the waitress's recommendations, Tonkatsu Ramen, Katsu Don, Konbu Onigiri, and Pumkin Croquette. Aside from the raw egg white on the Katsu Don everything was palatable...then again most places aren't going merely for palatable food options. We didn't hate any items we tried...but we would certainly rather venture elsewhere. The ramen lacked flavor, and I literally thought on first bite, ""Well, this is edible."" My favorite item was the Pumkin Croquette, but even here; this isn't something I could ever envision myself specifically wanting to stop in to Omioide to get. All around they are a strong two star or very weak three stars. The problem is that with the exception of ramen most of their menu can be found nearby at a similar price point with much better versions. ...and for ramen I'd rather make the trip to Flamingo or Spring Mountain than come back. It sounds a little harsh, but the food certainly wasn't A-OK...it was precisely, ""Meh. I've experienced better.""

It's hard to recommend an item that was served with unintended raw egg, but if you find your way here, I think I would go with the Katsu Don to go with the aforementioned Pumkin Croquette. Omioide took over the old Rice Trax building and fans of that quality & originality of food may enjoy themselves here. 

The interior is more than adequate for this price range and we actually really like the padded double-chair/loveseat-chairs. They were comfortable and certainly something you don't typically find.

2512759,2017-04-22,0,SzzrUeJGnl_LQAJXMK8wQw,"Kids choice night. They wanted Ramen. I suggested this place because according to their yelp, they serve Ramen. After our experience here, I think I've created little foodie monster children lol. They are so blunt and hey, kids keeps it real!

I had no influence in their opinions, yet I always encourage kindness. But my unfiltered 6 year old son and 3 year old daughter had the most funniest facial reactions to their ""ramen"". 

""Mommy, the noodles are so hard.""
""Eww what kind of soup is this?"" (Miso and shoyu base)
""Mommy, you tricked us, you said they'd have Ramen."" 
""Can we never come back here again?""

I had to keep shushing them because other customers were looking our way. My husband tried their Ramen and agreed. My 11 year old son, however, enjoyed his grilled chicken wings. The other two little kiddos asked if they can have potstickers because they couldn't eat anymore soup. After encouraging them to eat more, I did order some potstickers, and my hungry little monsters gobbled up the two orders.

I enjoyed my salmon sashimi and plain rice onigiri. In fact, I had hubby pick some up for me to-go another night since the kids were so adamant about not wanting to eat here ever again lol.

3 stars for the good service we had, the grilled wings, potstickers, and salmon sashimi. Not a great choice for Ramen.",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,0,0,3,5jiySJkKHtX2RNK-_0fIEw

Because the place is so close to my house, we wanted to like the place and gave another try. Second time we went, it was packed but had only one server. Service was friendly but slow. At least noodles tasted better.
Then finally the third time we went, the restaurant now seemed all in place and settled. Service was prompt, very friendly and attentive, and noodles were perfect texture. We ordered tonkotsu, spicy tonkotsu miso, ten zaru, gyoza and pumpkin croquette (i tried potato croquette before but pumpkin croquette was more flavorful) and all tasted very good.

2583784,2015-05-14,0,SzzrUeJGnl_LQAJXMK8wQw,"Cute exterior menu board and interior decor, so I really wanted to like this place! It's trying to be what people expect Tokyo to be like, but just an FYI, it's not actually...which would totally be ok if the authenticity in flavors was there... The menu had good options, but I'm afraid our lunch didn't live up to my expectations. The karaage wasn't seasoned enough - there needs to be more salt and maybe a crispier batter (higher cooking temp fryer so it's crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside), and if we're trying to avoid over salting, there should be condiments on the side (salt and pepper) on the table, but there wasn't...or at least offered on the side (there was curry powder and a mayo/soy sauce on the side instead...maybe chili pepper could've been an option?). The onigiri fell short also, the rice was overcooked (wet), and the ume filling was ok - but for the price I wouldn't typically point this out as a fault except that the rest of the meal wasn't that tasty either. Then my miso ramen - it wasn't hot (maybe the bowls should be warmed prior to serving? Because it was room temp when it got to the table), the ramen noodle was different, and slightly overcooked. The miso base itself was rather bland and more orange in color than I typically have, so maybe it was a different miso base?  Overall everything was ok, and the best way to explain it is that all the flavors are mild. Other notes - it bothered me that multiple tables brought on outside drinks, and no one said anything (as in, 1 table had Starbucks, another had raising canes, but maybe it's just that casual?)...and when our apps came out, there were no utensils/napkins/plates? We had to wait for each of our entrees to come out for them to bring each setting (since mine came out first, I had chopsticks, but my companion had to wait for their ramen to eat the app!). Finally, no one stopped by to touch our table (server or manager) to see how we were doing until I was waiting for a check and the server saw how my ramen was not touched much, as I just didn't care for it any more than an instant ramen I can make at home. If you're in the area and want a quick bite/fast food, this may definitely be the place for you! But I think you're might be better off going to Chinatown for a better meal at the same price, and if you like stronger flavors/temperature-appropriate meals.",yh_HDtWbTA2V-RgT9QC6kQ,0,0,2,qNwbiDx7Ai8RGVvwIVvbHA

I absolutely LOVE what they did to improve the restaurant, bravo! Seriously guys.

To start, the interior has been revamped to give it a more intimate vibe. The booths on the left side of the restaurant has a Japanese style canopy. It's a nice touch.

My favorite part by far is the introduction of new items on their menu. This place has some of the BEST tonkatsu money can buy. I am borderline addicted to their King Tonkatsu, which is a fat-ass piece of tonkatsu served on a massive plate. 

The reason why I love this tonkatsu is they flatten this thing to hell so it's extremely wide and thin. When served the pork is so thin it almost melts in your mouth. I love how thin the texture is. I'm usually not a fan of pork in general but it honestly tastes like beef briskets because of the thinness of it. The homemade sauce they serve with it is to die for. I love the balance of sweet and sour it has.

Last but not least they have a wicked buy one get one free beer or sake during the nighttime. This place never had a drinking vibe to it but I think the new interior makes it a fun place to have a few drinks at.

IMO, their Chasu don bowl is probably the only I would come there for. The rice was just right paired with the sauce of the Chasu and pickled plum and radishes. Their rice bowls come with salad and miso soup. Their salad were sprinkled with a dash of yuzu to give it a citrus-y flavor. 

The black sesame ice cream was just what was needed to make the meal feel complete. But overall,  I left feeling full but unsatisfied, the noodles lacked a lot of flavor and umami.",a0IOPV9cjQoxPsbXUImH2Q,0,0,2,zB0ZUmQBaL743v7_mWRniQ

3024604,2015-08-28,1,SzzrUeJGnl_LQAJXMK8wQw,"First of all, I am really excited that there is finally a ramen place here in the Southwest! So when we saw that this place opened, we tried it right away. 

I learned that ""omoide"" means ""memories, recollections"" in Japanese which is reflected well within the interior of this ramen place. The design reminds me of a street in Japan where you find a random ramen spot and discover that it's a diamond in the rough. It is very well-lit (love the paper lanterns!) and spacious. I like that the windows are big letting more light into the place. Most ramen places make it so that their interiors are dark.  It makes me feel a little claustrophobic sometimes. The ambiance inside Omoide is homey and comforting. 

The food here is decent. Not the best. It is hard not to compare it to Monta Choya. Their broth for their ramen is pretty bland. I think that is a good thing. It is refreshing to have a ramen place where you can control how salty you want your broth to be.  The portions are big so you get your money's worth. 

Overall, this is still a pretty good ramen place. They are new so there is always room for improvement.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,1,1,4,mIhitkQAVVYa5w1eE3OXwg

The restaurant itself is nicely decorated and I love how they stuck with the theme of an old town Japanese noodle vendor. It looks as though it has warped into a lil nook on the southwest side of town. The high ceiling makes the place look so open. And when you look up at all the hanging lights and decor, it makes you feel like you're stuck in a dream. Corny? Well, just trust me... and LOOK UP. ;]

The service was great and I have no complaints about the food or wait time. Their menu is really simple and they've broken it down to mini appetizers, ramen, hot/cold noodle dishes, poke bowls, and rice platters. I tried the Tonkatsu ramen and my friend had the Gyudon (See the menu on Yelp for pics and descriptions). Both were really good! The portions were just right for the price and the presentation of the meals were nothing fancy. We also ordered the Honey Bread for dessert and it was a nice lil treat to top off our meals.

Would I come back to this place? Yes, but only if I'll be in the area. There are a lot of equally great noodle/ramen houses as well as poke bowl restaurants all around Vegas, so they need to add just a little something extra to the menu to make me want to drive this far.

I went in there with miso ramen in mind. As I was looking over the menu, I came across this Gyu Don. The picture looked familiar, so I read the description .

I walked in and it seemed really established. The furniture was new and they designed the restaurant well with Japanese themed decorations. The menu is fairly simple, but if you aren't familiar with Japanese dishes, then it could be a challenge. I knew most of the items on the menu, but it seemed to have some duplications so I asked about them. The waitress half answered my question with no confidence until she asked her manager and even with the manager's answer, I didn't buy it. I still don't know the difference between the katsu don and tonkatsu don. Then I just asked about a few more items and she had to continue going back and asking about them. I know she will learn in time, but I thought knowledge of items would be something that would be well covered before opening. As long as she learns, I don't mind.

The food was nothing spectacular, just up to par for Japanese food. Their onigiri was not that great at all. I got the beef and bonito onigiri and I wouldn't order them here again honestly unless a lot of time has passed. I ordered the chicken karaage bowl and it comes with a salad and soup. They forgot my soup and when I told them I was missing my soup, it didn't come out very hot, so that was a red flag for me. My mom ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and it wasn't spicy at all.

The spicy broth actually delivered a good heat throughout the course, perhaps taking some of the Korean influence from the area with a gochujang-esque accompanied spicy sauce in the bowl.

THE DECOR (4 out of 5)
It was pretty nice walking into this new restaurant. Lots of seating and really high vaulted ceilings made it feel really spacious. That and a lot of Japanese touches (even Japanese ads) that made it feel kind of fun.

THE SERVICE (4 out of 5)
Pretty good service from the wait staff here. Didn't really have to wait too long to get our food and refills on my water were plentiful.

THE FOOD (4 out of 5)
So, let's get down to it, shall we? I had ordered an app of their karaage (think Japanese fried chicken nuggets) which was pretty good although, I kind of like the karaage from Fukumimi better. And then I had the Tonkotsu Shoyu ramen (like I usually get from Monta) and it was pretty good too. The veggies and the pork chashu were good, but as far as the flavor of the actual ramen broth, I really prefer Monta's ramen broth instead. Maybe it's because I'm a big salt kind of guy, I dunno. The good part though for Omoide is that they have a lot of stuff on the menu like udon or soba noodles (both hold and cold), katsu don, etc. So, I'm looking forward to trying out their other dishes.

*UPDATE* I went to Omoide for lunch again last week and had the Tonkatsu Curry Don, which was really good. 

OVERALL (4 out of 5)
So, if you're in the Southwest part of town and are looking for some good eats, be sure to check out Omoide. However, if you're looking for the best ramen out there and don't mind waiting, then Monta or Monta Chaya (in my opinion) are where you should go.",JDXcf0qEwoeo8fx9TlPMeA,2,0,4,wUCRDxNvM4yvE_ubVOleug

The only negative would be that their hot tea is $1.50 w/ free refills, where other places give this as complimentary.

Environment: The inside is clean and ventilation is great, no smell from the kitchen at all, especially no frying oil smell.

Service: Very good. We were acknowledged and seated immediately. Menu and water was provided before the server walked away to another table. The food came out quickly and our server came back numerous times to clear off emptied dishes, refilled our drinks, and made sure everything was fine.

Food: We ordered, Gyoza, Cold Tofu, Potato Croquette, Edamame, Kitsune (Bean curd Udon), and Buta Shio Bukkake (Pork belly Soba).
Potato Croquette was fried perfectly, crispy and doesn't fall apart.
Kitsune, the noodles were great. Soft yet chewy, just like udon should be. The soup, however, was a little saltier than it should be for this dish.
Buta Shio Bukkake, the Soba was made perfectly and sauce was good too. I must say, the pork belly was made very very good, crispy with lots of flavor.

What caught my eyes right away was the display of paper lanterns hanging on the ceiling. The restaurant's lighting is dim, so it gives that intimate feeling with your partner or your food if you like your privacy that way lol.  It also brings out the beauty in all the lanterns hung above. I also found the bar unique too! It looks like a traditional outdoor food cart.

She gave me some time to look at the menu and asked if I had any questions regarding. There item selections because it was my first time. She recommended a noodle bowl with a rice ball side order that compliments my main dish.

She was also quick to provide the spices and sauces for my meal. Communication was there and her ability to see cues on the customers needs was great.

Omoide definitely has a home-y feel to it. It looks cool from the outside, and the interior looks even better. Japanese decorations adorn the wall and the lighting is a bit dim, but perfect to enjoy dinner with company. It sort of makes me think of a modern day version of a noodle house. Everything is clean and organized, and workers had a smile on their faces.
Menus are presented in an unconventional clipboard and paper combination.

The waiter we had was friendly and he didn't seem to mind to educate us on the menu items. He also made sure our glasses were never empty and brought us a glass of ice to put in our drinks.

The music playing went along with the environment of the place, which was very pleasing to experience. 

We ordered the chicken karaage don and the beef steak don. The beef steak don was cooked to your choice of temperature, but the taste of it with the ginger sauce (I think) was a bit weird. The chicken karaage was better tasting and was a bigger portion. Miso soup was on point and the salad tasted amazing even though it looked a little plain. 

If you do decide to get dessert after eating, try the black sesame ice cream. It has a nutty flavor, yet a subtle sweetness to make it a perfect combination of flavors after eating a filling, well-portioned meal here.

4006004,2015-05-18,2,SzzrUeJGnl_LQAJXMK8wQw,"Recently opened, this restaurant is located in Southwest side of Vegas. As the name of the restaurant ""Omoide Noodles & Bowls"" says, their menu mainly consist of noodles (choice of udon/soba in either hot/cold) and bowls with few appetizers. 

ATMOSPHERE
The atmosphere of this place itself deserves 5 stars. The interior resembles a lot like Omoide Yokocho in Sinjuku or Dotonburi Yokocho in Osaka. Just like the name ""Omoide"" which means memories, I was having a nostalgic moment as soon as I walked in. Aw, I would just come here just to sit and enjoy the atmosphere.

SERVICE
Quick, attentive and friendly. Servers here were all smiling and were quick to refill water/constantly asking if we are doing ok. 

FOOD
I was craving some cold noodles and went with Shio Buta Bukkake. I went with Udon instead of soba. Food arrived within 10 mins. I looked at my bowl and was surprised at how simple it looked. Udon in tsuyu, with green onions and few pieces of shio buta on the side. 

The soup, or tsuyu was on the saltier side but overall had a lot of flavor even though it looked so simple. I realized halfway that there were some yuzu kosho (seasoning made of yuzu peel, pepper and salt. Citrusy and refreshing) on the shio buta. If you get the Shio Buta Bukkake, then I advise you to mix the green onions and yuzu kosho together. Makes it more flavorful! As much as I loved this, portion was small and soup was too salty for my taste. 

In addition to the bowl of noodle, I also ordered tempura mix. Mmh..for $6, definitely not worth it. Unless you are craving tempura, I would not order this. Few pieces of shrimp, along with vegetable tempura. It was just ok. 

CONCLUSION
Would like to see more options on the menu. I would like to see tsukemen added to the menu since they mainly serve noodles and rice bowls, but just a suggestion. Will return again!",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,2,2,4,xWMv8NKYYxl7akkHPJ9ikQ

2. after being disappointed by karaage chicken, we have to find something else now..so we gave their pork bun a try.....it's good, except the pork I got in my pork bun was literally PAPER THIN with mostly breading and almost no meat, I'm not joking guys, I compare my pork meat with the picture on their menu, which looks just like a generous thick cut, it looks NOTHING like it at all, when I talked to waitress they just politely apologize, although I didn't expect them to give me money back....but...not even effort of remaking me a new one? wow, there goes another star

As I was waiting for my order, I totally forgot to add the butter, but once I tasted my ramen, it was so yummy and buttery already and didn't need it anymore. It was so tasteful and yet so light. It came with the usual veggies/bamboo shoots and chashu. Although I didn't taste much garlic which I love with ramen. 
Hubby and son ordered the Ton Katsu Curry Don. ($10.00) came with a side salad with ginger dressing and miso soup. The curry and chicken together was such a good flavor and perfect spiciness. By this time nothing can go wrong with the food. Everything was delicious. 

Why only 3 stars? Well the food took more time to come out than other usual ramen places. We also had ordered 3 pork buns as appetizer, but never came out and had to cancel the order since it was put on our bill. It was really chilly inside the restaurant even after eating my Ramen and being the fact that I had to eat with my jacket on was super uncomfortable. And lastly, for being an Izakaya, they didn't have much options on their menu as other Izakayas. Other than that, our server was great and super happy with all the food we got. Will definitely be back for more.",xWpI52PuDd0yIE0lc_lPlg,0,0,3,__mI6ZG4MxKM3R5mbLrtDQ

If you're a newbie to Omoide, and have a craving for curry late at night, definitely try their ton katsu curry don. The pork cutlets melt in your mouth! A delicious surprise for me as it reminded me of a closed establishment years ago that had a similar dish (however I couldn't find any place that served it anywhere in Vegas for the life of me). Not until stepping into this quaint little joint. 

Ton Katsu Curry Don consists of a generous amount of pork cutlets, white rice that consistently doesn't get too sticky or hard in texture, slices of red ginger, and a less than wholesome amount of curry sauce all over. It always comes with a soup and salad, whether you order dine in or to go.  

Apparently they have tonkotsu ramen with black garlic oil (but only limited to one specific ramen), which I tried briefly with a few friends however flavorful it may be, it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Their late night Japanese beer specials are definitely noteworthy though!",pHk6gWq3gFPNG0smjd9cRQ,8,8,4,yvuScvcJV6Kzqsnoa0Qz0g

She did a fantastic job with serving, clearing tables, etc.  However, overall the food was okay nothing great.  Katsu curry was tasty but strong, katsudon was okay.  Gyoza was tasty. Big issue is cleanliness. Salt and pepper shakers and soy sauce plate were sticky and dirty.  Looks like cleanliness leaves something to,be desired.  With one waitress, how can she do everything and clean up too?  Also what looked like a counter for customers with utensils and napkins laid out has a curtain front of it but you can see supplies behind the curtain. Would hope they don't seat customers there, I wouldn't sit there and stare at a curtain while I'm eating.

I saw that this place just opened and what better time to try it then on a cold Saturday May night. I made my husband pick it up and he was excited that he could stop by Lee's if he wasn't in the mood for noodles. 

They just opened yesterday and when we called the first time there was no answer but they finally answered and we were able to order. My tonkatsu shoyu was more tonkatsu than shoyu but it was creamy and flavorful. I'm a bit thirsty after it but I assume it's just from the saltiness? The noodles were precooked in the to go box which could be a good thing or bad thing. They should probably offer an option of doing either or. Luckily the noodles were cooked al dente so when the noodles and soup were combined it wasn't a bunch of soggy noodles. The bamboo pieces were hard to eat but I definitely like the charsui. The onigri was ok. Nothing to go crazy about but it's a nice filler. 

Overall, I'm glad they are opening more places around the southwest so we don't have to make the trek down to Chinatown. I'm definitely coming back when I feel the need to eat ramen. =)",sa5zd7bwBQzajQB48Y9SUw,10,13,4,PgxEGMa_EFdJGS-vs8nY2g

They have a variety of food to choose from: Udon, Ramen, Gyuudon (Meat Bowl), etc.  My friends and I chose this place to try their ramen. The last time I went, I saw that they also have Poke Bowls which was new to me since the last time I went to Omoide.

I had the Tonkatsu Miso while my other friends had the regular Tonkatsu. The ramen had the usual meat, bamboo, and seaweed.  It also consist of thin type of noodles.  Overall, it was delicious~  It tasted similar to other Ramen restaurants I've been too.

Why the low reviews, Yelp? The 2 dishes I tried were both good. There aren't very many non-sushi Japanese restaurants in Vegas, but this one makes up for it. Authentic items on the menu, but they didn't taste authentic. But that doesn't mean they didn't taste good. 
Chashu bowl: Fatty pork, but that melt in your mouth kind of fat. Not the chewy stuck in your mouth kind of fat. Heavily flavored and dripping sauce into the rice. A plus. 
Ebi-don. Oyako-don, but with tempura shrimp instead of chicken. They don't usually serve it with tempura shrimp in Japan, but I can see the appeal.Very filling. Both dishes came with a salad, soup and pickled veggies.

Our large group rotated in on a Sunday afternoon after a long holiday weekend of rock climbing. We appreciated the warmth, especially the extra warm restrooms, that gave flashbacks to the warm heated toilet seats in Japan. These toilet seats weren't heated but the adorable little bathroom space was extra warm and cozy.

This ramen shop was conveniently located off the freeway on the drive back to Southern California. Our group arrived and departed in staggered times which probably made it easier for the restaurant to manage. 

There were vegetarian options for those that didn't eat meat and they were still hearty, warm and satisfying ramen. The majority of the party ordered the spicy tonkatsu ramen and added an egg. Some people didn't get eggs as the kitchen ran out but we weren't charged for them.

2. Service: I didn't request for a lot and I don't have complaints
3. Soup base: I actually like the soup here more. The flavor of the Tonkotsu was more subtle and not as overbearing with the salt. 
4. Noodles: It tastes store bought, nothing special. 
5. Chashu pork: Compared to Monta, unremarkable. It was a bit course and flavorless in comparison.

I couldn't even count the amount of people that I've introduced to this place, it'd be hard to calculate the hundreds (plural) of dollars I spent at this place overtime. Last night, both myself and my coworker were very disappointed.

It's almost religious I order the same thing at this place (The only exception is when I'm feeling dangerous and order a honey bread for dessert). It's always Ramen and a side order of shrimp tempura. The shrimp comes in a set of two for three dollars and while I'm personally not the biggest fan of the price, I pay it anyway every time because I just happen to love shrimp tempura. Last night, however... When I received my order, it was noticeably smaller to both myself and my coworker who comes with me all the time. 

Seriously, if you look at my last review, it was five stars and I'm pretty sure I even mentioned it was arguably my favorite restaurant. Not anymore. I brought it to the waiter's attention upon delivery and he scoffed at me and said ""they always come in this size."" They don't... They seriously don't. If I was cheap and just trying to get free things, I would've complained that there is some hair in my soup or something. I've never complained here before in the countless times I've been here, i've always been polite to everybody. I've always been easy to please. 

This is the one time (over a three dollar item) that I had ever spoken up about anything and I was argued with and scoffed at. I didn't even ask for them for free, I just wanted them exchanged for some regular sized shrimp if I was going to pay the three dollars I always pay for it. That type of guest service put enough of a bad taste in my mouth that I have become fairly confident I'm never going to come here again. This was a bill over $40 (including tip, because I'm not an animal) you would think more effort would have been placed forward to retain a VERY loyal guest's business but instead they are now trained to argue baby shrimps till their death.",4xgbVGM9yklvk8zrOf7tiA,1,1,1,5uE19mgnpYn0QeTOVrBrnw

First, service took FOREVER. And I'm not exaggerating. A couple seated next to us, left because their dishes were taking too long as well. Anyways, it took them twenty minutes to give us our first ramen dish. And I had to wait an additional fifteen minutes for my pork belly miso bowl to arrive. And lastly, the gyoza came after another five or so minutes. And there was no communication between the servers at all. We got the bill twice at the end of our meal. 


If the service wasn't bad enough, the food was below mediocre. The broth for the miso ramen tasted like it came from powder. The so-called udon noodles looked and tasted like hydrated ramen noodles. Both bowls were oily as well.

A.  Where is everyone?  Came in on a Sunday at about 2:15 pm Amd it is nearly empty in this very good sized noodle shop with plenty of tables and space.  

B.  Service - very nice and attentive staff. Friendly and quick.

C.  Choices. Love this menu.  From the rice dishes, to the noodles, ramen, soba and udon.  Both hot and cold noodles. They even have my favorite Zaru Soba noodles as well.

D.  The food. This is key and three star to me. 

A.  Buta Shio Bukkake Cold Soba- of course I love soba and cold is best.  I first want to know where were the noodles?  They gave me a huge bowl and a small bit of soba.  The soba was perfectly cooked.  Enjoyed it quite a bit.  The grilled pork belly was well very grilled. I found it to be tough and the taste was not flavorful.  The sauce was strong.  Very strong taste.  I know they use Mirin for the sauce but it was over powering. 

B. Tonkatsu Shoyu Ramen- my son ordered this and I had a few bites.  The sauce was very good, ramen just right.  My only issue is that the ramen was swimming in soup and I prefer that it is not.

C.  Hiyashi Chuka - these cold ramen noodles are very good and on a nice warm day just right.  Right amount of ramen and all the toppings were great.  The wifey ordered this and of course I stole some bites.  I look forward to ordering this in future.  

I like this place, the size, the service.  The food could be slightly improved but  it it is good overall.

The menu holds so many options, whether you're feeling ramen or Japanese curry or appetizers or cold noodles. Its wide variety made me question my decision because everything looked so good (and I wasn't even hungry). 

The pricing is ridiculously good. Although we only ordered two mini dishes and an appetizer, we were filled up and the total ended up being lower than a fast food meal. There's no chicken option for the curry so I opted for a mini chicken curry bowl. It's pretty good sized and it was only $4!

I ordered the salmon and avocado salad and that thing disappeared with the quickness. I could not stop eating it, it was delicious.  The salmon melted in my mouth and the avocado was perfectly ripe. I also ordered a Katsu pork bun. It was bigger than I thought it would be and was also taster than I thought it would be. It was so good we ordered two to go. The sauce on it wasn't overpowering and gave the bun a great taste. 

Lastly, of course we had to order the Honey Toast and we ordered it with black sesame ice cream although the waitress kept saying not to, and to order it with Vanilla ice cream instead. Welp, no we wanted black sesame AND guess what miss waitress it tasted like an orgasm in my mouth. The black sesame ice cream was delish, and that toast! My goodness soo goddam good.

The reason why I say this is because the udon is not thick. It is pretty skinny for udon and also the meat portion on it is a joke. I ordered the curry broth which was very good actually, but it came with pork belly that was 3 small pieces. It was literally small as a strip of super thin bacon sliced into 3 pieces.

We stopped in about 8pm on Saturday night - the place was busy, but we were seated immediately. That's where the goodness ends. 

We looked at the menus for a while - long enough for the people who came in behind us to be seated, get drinks and food. No one had come by to get our drink orders or even check us. Of course, I understand being busy, but at the very least any type of issue should have been communicated to us. 

After discussing how rude and unprofessional this is, we  decided to leave. If you can't be bothered with taking care of your customers and making them all feel welcome, we can't be bothered with dining at your establishment or recommending it to anyone.

My fiancé ordered the spicy tonkotsu and it had the right amount of flavor to it.  I wish the karraage was a little more crispy, but that's a personal preference to me.   I ordered the katsu don,  once again not bad, just wish there was more flavor in the pork and rice so I just asked for hot sauce.  The part I dislike is that there are no descriptions or images, so we had to ask the server to explain things on the menu.  Another suggestion, have Yelp help you (thanks to the previous reviews and photos !!!)

The atmosphere/decor was super cute.    This is the primary reason it got an extra star  (just being honest).   The servers are attentive.  The food was good.  I think they could kick it up a notch with the flavoring, but with everything else I would definitely come back !!",7P6t9qnhKLOa8SqGb85B7w,1,1,4,qWy4I1ljAUCHeKE7Buql6w

I was still amazed with the ambience of this place. This restuarant is located where I call ""little Chinatown"" next to Oyhsi on Rainbow Blvd Rd.

5716278,2017-05-15,1,SzzrUeJGnl_LQAJXMK8wQw,"Stumbled upon a new favorite!

Omoide (???, Japanese for ""memories"") is perfectly located on Rainbow blvd. to catch our attention enough to draw us in.  We were actually on the way to another spot, and because I don't often find myself in this part of town, I just had to try.  

Once inside, the center ceiling lights will catch your eye, then you look around and now find yourself outside a Japanese village. From the building designs on the wall, the windows decorated like awnings, and the seated-bar section like a street cart, the interior decor is beautifully crafted atmosphere.

Like the name says, they serve poke bowls and variations of Japanese noodles.  Today I'm having an appetizer with ramen.  Next time I need to try the poke, or even the udon or soba (which are two of my other favorite Japanese noodles, not found often in Vegas).  

Karaage ($5.50) - Japanese-style fried chicken bites.  Great but a little thin on the fry imo.

Tonkotsu ($7.50) - a classic bowl which every ramen spot offers.  Omoide's version nails it.  Thin noodles, flavorful broth, no overwheming oil, and compared to other ramen joints, at a good price.

The end result was a delicious experience by means of a surprising stumble.  I'm glad I found this place.  When I'm back in the area, I want to go straight to Omoide.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,2,4,4,ZbqnSs9s9SzIWJS4IUi5Ng

My husband has been on a search for good tonkotsu, and we are happy to say this place filled his needs! I cannot speak for him, but the chashu was tender, broth was perfect and came with thin noodles as it should (according to him).

My tendon came with 3 shrimps, nasu, shishito, kabocha (pumpkin) and a perfect hanjyuku-tamago (egg)!!  It was a double thumbs up for not only having potato croquette but also having pumpkin croquette!! Oh, and Orion beer of course.

The decor is like being in an out door street alley in Japan.  I liked the feel of it.  It kind of takes you away.  Decor A.  I got tonkotsu ramen.  The broth and noodles I'd give a B+, but they need to work on their toppings.  The Chasu, egg, and everything was good, but the bamboo tasted like the canned type.  If your you're going to use canned bamboo then just don't.  Also, they put what appeared to be saffron on top as well.  They could do without that.  Just keep it simple and yummy.  No need to make it fancy.
Over all I like this place, but it seems to have a polerizing effect on people.  People either love it or hate it.  Hopefully that keeps it from getting to Monta's crowd level.  I still think Monta is the best in town.",aj2pS6AFVlzKDDUrisIRaA,1,0,4,qF0N6o05ManQpufHzx1ADw

It didn't taste special or anything. The Tonkatsu sauce was already on the meat which made it soggy. I recommend asking for the sauce in the side. The miso soup was one of the worst I've ever tasted, mostly because it tasted like hot water. 

On the upside, we ordered the Buta shio buttkake and it's amazing! In fact, we loved it so much that we ordered a side of noodles to add to the broth. The sesame ice cream was also one of the best I've ever tasted. I'll definitely get a scoop every time I go. 

We wanted to start with the gyoza but the waitress forgot to ring it in, I guess. We didn't feel like eating it anymore.

The food came out very quickly, almost too quickly, like it was just sitting there. My friend and I were both disappointed by the small portions. I didn't enjoy anything in my bowl. The tempura was soggy and unappetizing and the rice was gummy. My friend was unimpressed with her meal as well.

Once we finished eating we both mentioned how we still felt a little hungry but didn't have any desire to order more food. She even discussed what she planned on reheating from her previous night's leftovers that she had at home...

This place is an authentic JAPANESE restaurant with amazing quality and variety.  A little hidden and secret place-- we loved this place so much my husband went on Wednesday this week and returned on Saturday.  Having visited Japan many times, we can spot an authentic Japanese restaurant-- not just one that caters to Americans with their offering of hundreds of rolls (with mozzarella and everything fried).  Prices are amazing-- like Happy Hour price but offered all the time.  AND amazingly enough, they offer 2 for 1 Beer and house Sake AFTER 7-- yep after NOT before.  First time on Thursday -  we ordered the garlic edamame (on point), tuna tataki (fresh and delicious with fried garlic on top) and the tonkotsu ramen.  It may sound like they may offer too many different items to be good but not so.  The Ramen was probably one of the best I've had here since I moved here 3 months ago and I have gone to specialty Ramen only places.  The broth was rich but light and the noodles were the right amount of chewiness.  The noodles tasted homemade.  The pork actually had a grilled quality to it that most other ramen places do not have.  Now, I know where to go to satisfy my ramen crave.  One of the best buys is the buns.  They are only $2.50 and they are huge.  We tried the Pork Katsu ones and the pork was so flavorful, crunchy and melted in your mouth.  It was so good we had to order one more.  This is a must try.

Tonight - Saturday night - we went back.  We started with the Avocado Salmon Salad and it was the bomb.  With a light Yuzu dressing, lots of fresh Salmon sashimi and generous avocado , it was a price steal at 8 bucks!  We also had the Black Cod and grilled squid.  We have been to premier yakatori places in Northern Ca and this squid was better than any I have ever had.  Delicious, fresh and tender-- definitely another must try!  The Miso Black Cod was also flavorful and tender -- yum!  We also tried the Udon-- again amazing light, flavorful broth and satisfyingly chewy fresh udon.  We met the Japanese chef, Nagasan.  He was so polite and friendly.  The service is also very friendly and helpful.  Kevin helped us with both visits. Go try this secret, hidden gem.  You won't be disappointed.

5984508,2015-08-12,0,SzzrUeJGnl_LQAJXMK8wQw,"First off I want to say how happy I am for such a great ramen place to be so close to home. 

As soon as you walk in you'll notice the detailed decor. It's super cute and very well planned out. It reminds me of a little Japanese village you might see illustrated in a book or in a old Japanese film. It's not just the counter seating but if you look up you will see the lanterns and the set up they have in the nooks of the walls. 

Then there's the food. I love most things spicy so when I first came I ordered the spicy tonkatsu miso ramen with an egg even though you have to order it separately, I gotta have an egg. Lol That was delicious and now here for the second time I couldn't wait to have it again. It's not spicy to where you can't enjoy your meal. It's just the right amount of spice, because they know that's why you ordered it. I love the noodles, always soft and just the right size. The toppings in the ramen are what make the broth more flavorful. As you eat you can taste all the different things but at the same time nothing over powers another. We also tried the umeboshi Onigiri, which is pickled plum inside a rice ball. This brought me back to my grandmother. Being raised in a Japanese house, when we were sick we were given umeboshi Onigiri and tea, it brought back memories. We also ordered the gyoza, honestly it's nothing to be excited about. It's a fried pot sticker, something I feel you can make at home. 

My overall feel for this place is amazing. Love, love, love it!! The waitresses are super nice and very friendly. Always making sure everything is alright and filling up your cup. Brought my brother back this time only for him to love it too. I will continue to be coming back and bringing more people.",2Np7qRLMWQVn_M23iyZ4og,1,0,5,hcCYrhdcGWi3H2MAimUm7A

When we came the server seemed super flustered and was rushing us as we were ordering our food. We did have a few questions about some foods because the menu didn't really explain what some of the dishes contained. 

One of our friends asked if he could try their curry sauce and the waitress looked confused about why he wanted to taste it. He had to explain that he wanted to taste it so he could decide whether he would choose a dish that contained the curry and she just nodded left and came back a few minutes later with the curry. The curry was watery and not as thick as other restaurants make it.

My husband and I got the takoyaki, salmon avocado salad, and Ebi fry don. The Ebi fry was okay. It was kind of chewy and may have been fried a little too much. The salmon was good and the takoyaki was okay. 

As we ended our meal the waitress took her time to come to us and hand us our bills. This was a change from her rushing us and I personally didn't like how much of a difference her attitude changed from the beginning of our meal to the end.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,0,2,GddMYiCwqndghjuwagceGw
