We came on Friday around 8:30pm. When ordering the girl informed us that they close at 9pm and asked if we're taking it to go to which I said no... we're dining in. While we were eating the food (which was OK but nothing special in a world of poke bowls) they started vigorously cleaning the store and putting the chairs up. Made us feel ""very welcome""... like ""can you hurry up and get out since we want to close now"" welcome. By 8:52pm the sign was off and store was closed. In my opinion... if your hours are till 9pm - you serve till 9pm. Otherwise there is a whole bunch of other places to choose from where we are not rushed out of the door because staff looks like they are late for a Friday night party.",ifN4zDOzYHt3RxEKW6Rc0Q,0,0,2,WEpZOz45tI_2SzAF4O5XHw

I have come twice already and plan to come back many more times.  This place is a little more expensive than the other poke places, but I'd rather save my money and eat once in a while at a place like this than eating at the other typical poke places.

Now down to the good stuff, the poke was definitely fresh  with a mix of some ahi tuna, salmon, spicy tuna, and the sauce mix I chose was their signature poke paku which had a little kick in it (just how I like it). I wouldn't say it's the absolute best poke I've had, but it's definitely a great, clean environment, with good staff.

And I dont see her wearing the glove when I walk in it seems like she already has one on all the time. Which makes me little uncomfortable since she is touching my food with her hands and I dont know what her hands has touched before she touches my food. Since its raw fish I think they should put on their gloves infront of the customers and not have them on already while waiting for the next customer. Dont know if they use the same glove for so many customers or if they change them with each customer. 
Just something I am very picky about it is hygiene. Since its dealing with food and health. Taking one star of for the wearing one glove only issue. Other than that no other complaints.",CEtp4S5PCLQZRe0xXNPgkw,0,0,4,DpdICJ32MznjclkkxJwcBw

A great variety of sauces, toppings, sides, etc. that is sure to please any poke fans. A medium was more than enough and was under $13.

Poke Poku is set up like Subway or Chipotle, where you stand behind the glass and tell the server what you would like out of an assortment of ingredients. My husband and I both ordered medium bowls, which gave us each three scoops of protein. I had yellowtail, tuna, and salmon; and he had two scoops of tuna and a scoop of snapper. Next up comes two sides (seaweed salad [yum!] for both of us, with spicy crab for me and edamame for him). Then you choose your ""mix-ins"" (fruits and vegetables [cucumber, mango, onion, etc.]) and ""toppings"" (salts and spices [roasted garlic, ginger, tamago, etc.]). Last comes the sauce: I chose Hawaiian style (sesame oil, Sriracha, Aloha, and ponzu); and my husband had Japanese style (same as Hawaiian, but swap the Sriracha and Aloha with wasabi mayo). The server mixes these all in a bowl and serves them on your pre-ordered base. We both picked mixed greens, although you could also select rice (white, brown, or mixed) or baby kale (my first preference, although they were out of it when we were there).

As I said, there are thousands of possible combinations to try, but we were both pretty pleased with our choices. The fish was fresh, and the portions were plentiful. I just wish I could have tried the kale.

It's not fancy, but it's filling--and reasonably priced for freshly prepared fish (around $25 for two). So if you're in the mood for some island-style eats, pop on in to Poke Poku!",55bAo20xQNIA2CfMKIDtPA,0,0,4,FU9KW8mG15vaE5QOyJWcZg

My friend had just came here earlier on the day and told our ""group"" (fb chat) about the lunch special. Sushi Burrito with miso soup (dine in only) for $5, their house-made teas (dine in only - varies per day), and 3 gyoza ($1.50 extra)

-----------------------

Their original menu is as follows

Step 0 - Poke Bowl/Poke Salad - Small $9.50 (2 scoops), Medium $11.50 (3 scoops), Large $13.50 (4 scoops). Hawaiian poke - 5 oz $8.00, 10 oz $14.00. Poke burrito - 1 scoop $7.50, 2 scoop $9.00. 

Sides - Shrimp Shumai $5.00 (6 pieces), Gyoza $5.00 (6 pieces), Takoyaki $4.00 (6 pieces)

Step 1 - Base - White rice, brown rice, half and half, mixed salad

Step 2 - Sides (Choose 2 - Extra side +$1.50) - Seaweed salad, edamame, crab meat, spicy crab meat, avocado, fried shrimp tempura

Step 3 - Protein (Extra Protein +$1.75) - Tuna, salmon, yellowtail, scallop, snapper, spicy tuna, soft shell crab, shrimp, octopus, seared albacore

Step 4 - Mix Ins - Masago, red onion, white onion, cucumber, cilantro, pineapple, mango, organic tofu, tomato

Step 5 - Toppings (Unlimited) - Green onion, jalapeno, crispy onion, roasted garlic, tamago, kizami nori, bonito, sea salt, ginger, corn, tobiko, wasabi, shichimi

Mix in Sauces - (lots of styles, essentially a mix of different sauces) but they include Sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, aloha, ponzu, shichimi, eel, yuzu ponzo, mango, guzzi, Korean spicy chili, wasabi mayo. 

-----------------------

I had opt'ed for the lunch special and I was not completely hungry and I tend to not eat that much for the ""first meal"" of the day. My sushi burrito consisted of a seaweed wrap which had white rice added by a machine with a sprinkle of furikake. For some reason, I opted to have seaweed salad and spicy crab meat. They pile the sides on before getting a metal mixing bowl for your protein, mix in items, and sauces. As a salmon lover, I definitely went for salmon and added red onion, cucumber. Wasn't too familiar with the sauces but I opt'ed to try their ""signature"" poke poku style which consisted a mix of sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, and aloha. Not sure what aloha is. Lol 

What I didn't realize is for burritos, you cant get toppings cuz (for obvious reasons) you cant really put toppings on a burrito. Lol.. DANG IT (next time im getting a bowl LOL) They wrap it up and cut in half. If you dine in with the lunch special, they give you a small bowl of miso soup, and ""access"" to the house-made teas (but to be honest, cups are right next to it, I think anyone can get to it) 

The ingredients they use are pretty good. My only complaint is too much sauce is used in the mix. Next time I may opted out or just pick a specific sauce or two to use. Made it quite messy to eat and sauce filled. Would like a more ""natural"" taste. Sauce seemed to cover a lot.

If you've had poke at Fresh Catch in Honolulu, or the fish market at Hilo, or even Safeway in Lahina, you'll find the offerings here a bit confusing. It's like a buffet -- make your own poke on the spot. The ingredients are all fresh and good, but I think poke benefits from a bit of time sitting and blending the ingredients. 

The staff were completely clueless and the process is a bit arcane for a newcomer. There aren't any toro chips for the purists -- they serve the poke over rice or solo in a bowl.",7WyqK8rM-NX3XTyFu9XtGA,1,0,4,jL2VTUTl9xjzOotYRfTVVA

Their fish is fresh and cuts are big. Personally like that way because you get a taste of the seasoning + fish. Large has the best value. 4 scoops of protein.

You can tailor make your bowl, so if you're not a fan of things like imitation crab, mayonnaise or cream cheese - which you sometimes get as a ""surprise"" in a sushi roll, you don't have to endure that.

After I paid for my order, it instructed me that it would take 40 minutes to pickup from the time it was confirmed (takes only 5min to assemble). Maybe they were busy at the time. Showed up at 40 minutes (8:20pm) to an empty restaurant with two young girls (employees) eating on a table at the side. I was quickly greeted and one of them went behind the counter to wait on me. Upon informing her I was there to pickup an order from Yelp, she panicked, went to the side to grab a piece of paper and whispered to the other girl that they forgot about this one. She came back to me and told me sorry, they had customers, they forgot all about it, and that it wouldn't take long. I said that it was fine and knew it wouldn't take long (which is why 40min was a little much of a wait). Just not very professional or responsible to forget an order. Lucky I wasn't in that much of a rush, which is why most people order online (so that it's ready for pickup when they arrive). Someone else may have even left a single star, even though the food is amazing. The 3 stars is for the food, and would have been 5 if this was an altogether smooth experience. Also, the reason they did not get a tip. You never know what will happen, so I tend to tip after I have all my info.

It's a great lunch option as the small bowl is the perfect amount of food for me and I truly enjoy the fun environment here. They play j-pop videos and I find myself always in a better mood by the time lunch is coming to an end.

So why the 3 stars? 2 reasons - 
They advertise fresh avocado and even show it in their own marketing images but what they really offer is mashed avocado only. I'm not a fan of mashed avocado in my poke bowls plus I strongly feel that you should sell what you advertise. And the second reason is that the bowls are more expensive than their competitors by $3-$5 and there's tons of competition out there.

Pros:
Complimentary miso soup (dine-in only)
Complimentary teas (a variety of fun flavors)

1993518,2017-02-14,19,hDyc9DdjGldhxis5E1rd3w,"Poke Poku is one of the better poke bowl options- despite marketing themselves as Hawaiian, they've got the standard build-as-you-go format. PP stands out by having more add-on and mix-in options with a traditional slant, like roasted garlic, furikake seasoning, dried seaweed, tomato, bonito, and pineapple. They also have a variety of traditional-sounding teas available at the drink station, though I admittedly didn't care for the ones I tried. 

Unlike most of the other poke bowl places, they have tofu and scallop as protein options. They get a bonus star for mixing the protein, veggies, and sauce by hand before putting them in the bowl. This seems obvious, but a lot of places just drizzle sauces on top or leave the bowl dry, and the marinated flavors are a big component of what i look for in a great poke bowl (americanized or otherwise). 

There's free miso soup with dine-in. It's free, yes, but it's also possibly the worst miso soup I've ever had, because it had a distinct dishwater taste to it that made me think, ""no wonder it's free.""

She never explained all the sides to me after I explained I was a first time customer. I asked if there was a way I could have the avocado instead and she picked the crab off and put the avocado on instead. After she switched out my side, she mixed my protein choice with mix ins and left without excusing herself. Then some guy ended up taking over my order.

- Lots of fun sauce combinations

- Avocado is offered as a side, but it's more like guacamole. I dont care for guacamole in my poke bowl and I'd rather have fresh avocado.
- The price is much more expensive than competitors. A large bowl, which is 4 scoops of protein, is $13.50.

I had feeling was not more of your traditional true 808 poke but more of the new trendy style of build your own bowl then pick your protein, sauce, and toppings. I truly have no problem with especially when your starving from a post long run and craving raw fish and rice. lol!!! Hawaiian they definitely have that theme down from the minute you walked into the restaurant. It got the island vibe the only thing missing is local hawaiian station. I appreciated that they were playing current music in the restaurant. 

It was my first time so went with the Poke large bowl/ I got three different proteins one spicy tuna, salmon, and albacore. My toppings tried not to go crazy. Nothing worst then overkill and takes away from the fish. True Poke never about the sauce but the fish quality. I feel the quality is good at Poke Poku. The sauce went with the LA sauce. It tasted basically like spicy tuna sauce you would get in sushi I felt. Good. The portion size feel like your not getting cheated at all for the money you pay. So many different toppings and options you really could go back everyday for week never get the exact same thing twice. They have nice options comes to beverages. They have refrigerator with different bottle and cans choose from and fresh made teas (three different ones). Not just Poke bowls I got order of gyoza. It was solid. The only thing odd was ask for gyoza sauce it doesn't come with one. They just started serving ramen noodles on the menu. 

The service was five stars. The gentlemen making my bowl went over the steps being my first time. Friendly, attentive, and made my first experience great one.",iSC96O2NjQc3JExGUHQG0Q,6,5,4,d__xgR9iGbizSnFd_1Kjdw

I'm not a Poke expert by any means, but I believe this spot gave me the will to become one...I know, sounds cheesy lol. 

Seriously, everything was delicious! I tried a rice bowl with half and half white and brown rice with 3 scoops protein: yellowtail, salmon, and spicy tuna with the LA style sauce. For the sides/toppings I chose: spicy crab, seaweed salad, the sweet egg patty (forgot the name), roasted garlic, red onion, red and orange fish eggs, green onion, futikake, seaweed strips, tomato, mango, and probably some other stuff I can't recall. They have so many tasty options and everything is fresh and prepared right in front of you. I also ordered a Spicy Ramen and the steamed Dumplings which were both on special for $4.99! Both very hot and tasty as well :) I know it sounds like I really pigged out, but really, I DID! Although I shared my ramen and dumplings, I still could not manage to finish my medium bowl because they really do load it up. I had enough leftovers for a snack the following day, so that's always exciting! The food is absolutely excellent, the employees are friendly, the atmosphere has a positive vibe, it's clean, and they offer free Jasmin, barley, and corn tea. I can't wait to go back again!

UPDATE 06/09: Came in for late night dinner. I noticed that I didn't get a little stamp card the first time I came in, so I asked Ralph if they could stamp my new card for last time I went in and he was totally cool with it! Once you get 10 stamper-oos you get a medium poke bowl for $0!! Thanks for being so chill, Ralph! Awesome customer service!

The downfall is that a few changes have been made and even though the price dropped the large bowl is 3 scoops of fish instead of the 4 it used to be. 

What continues to make me sad is that they don't offer any sauce with any of their fried items. I come here purposely because my kid likes the fried stuff but he also likes sauce and I don't know of anywhere else that serves calamari without a sauce. Odd. 

Lastly, while we were dining in the music wasn't the edited version. F bombs were blaring away. Luckily my kid didn't notice and the parents with a younger kid behind me didn't seem to notice either but eventually someone will make a big stink about this.

I love sushi and poke places and have tried so many in town. Many are just average to be honest between Soulfish Poke and Tail Fin etc. Depends on the day you go how fresh the fish tastes and for spending  $10 base plus on bowls I was always annoyed the amount of upcharges and how stingy these places are with non existent basic portions whether protein or veggies. I don't eat out often but love healthy spots that are quality among give you value for your money. This place is it. I had never heard of Poke Poku until I was randomly in the AutoZone in this new plaza as I live in the SW. I have passed it so many times but just one of those places you don't see and have never heard it mentioned. The staff was polite and not trying to rush through my order as all too many places do among love all their food options and desserts. This has hands down become by go to Poke place and one of the handful of places like Skinny Fats and Greens/Proteins I will have in my arsenal for delicious but healthy options when I'm not cooking.

Every location has a check-in deal via Facebook that saves you mula + a stamp card. You really get the bang for your buck. Dine in and you get free miso soup as well. They just love showering you with freebies and I'm not complaining man.

Lastly, the macaroon ice cream is my favorite. I've seen the same ice cream at several different restaurants and they seem to be slowly replacing mochi ice creams to be the next staple, cool treat. Love this place and the one on eastern/215, I'll be writing a separate review for that one as well.

2980817,2017-06-02,0,hDyc9DdjGldhxis5E1rd3w,"Believe it or not, after all the years of the poke bowl craze. I had my first poke bowl late last year. And I'm so sad I had it at Poke Poku because I was in town visiting family and my sister and in law wanted me to try out this place. 

Now, since then I've tried a few more poke places. And a good poke place are a few and far in between. That said, I have not come across any other place that compares to Poke Poku. 

I would say they are a little pricey. I had a medium with 3 scoops and the scoops weren't that big. But overall, once it was finished with toppings and etc, it was a heavy bowl. The reason why I never tried poke bowls it because I don't like eating rice really (I know, I'm Asian) so I don't like eating rice with any raw fish especially. However I did not mind it. And it's probably cheaper if I ate rice instead of trying to get full from poke, which is impossible! 

What I love about Poke Poku is their sauces and the many varieties they have. Their sauces are so darn tasty, I wanted to lick my bowl after I finished it. Many places have the simple spicy mayo, ponzu or shoyu but I'm a girl that craves for flavor. And they offer so many more different toppings (like literally!) compare to other poke places. I just love their variety. They have complimentary tea and miso soup for dining in. I make sure it's my first and last stop in Vegas.",Kf35Fl31zONNxUxKIVOOzw,0,0,5,ygistV5RWQvI1aL0SbRC4w

They definitely do go above and beyond with toppings and options, however their fish is sub-par. Personally, that is the most important part of a Poké dish. 

Poké has become a big thing, and can be found everywhere now a days. Problem with that are places like these that don't give Poké the great name. Worst part is they still charge the same as the places that truly have the great fish and much better bowls.",3E_ZanLMpnFCPUq49CqSlQ,2,0,3,pS00prBHiXib1jePQCdUEA

Its located on a busy busy street, but I didn't have a hard time with parking. Clean, with a lot of seating. I like how they have lunch specials like a poke burrito which I got for $6. Prices here are a bit higher than other places. I think a medium bowl with 3 scoops was around $11-12 which is the same price as a large bowl else where. While the fish looked fresh, they didn't have that many options for toppings. 

I got my salmon burrito to go. I liked how they have a machine that automatically makes a rice sheet with a push of a button! But... I did find hair in my rice. I also think they should have avocado slices so that the avocado mash doesn't make the burrito mushy. My fish was unevenly distributed so on one half of my burrito, there were only 3 pieces of salmon and the other half had the majority. The burrito is a bit smaller than other places as well... not sure if thats due to the lack of topping choices so I only chose cucumber, onions, crab meat and avocado with my salmon.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,2,1,3,Z6ZkpwnpM22YQDarLU3-Mg

So when you go, expect loud music and cold chairs. That's probably the only things I would change. Oh wait, I forgot about the inconsistency of the sizes of the burritos too. I tend to get something similar each time, but the sizes can vary to ""eh, I'm still a bit hungry"" to ""oh-ho-hooo this thing is so thicc (WITH TWO C'S) I don't think I can finish this!"". 

The quality of the fish itself is pretty good. They tend to be cut in smaller pieces so you get a better ratio throughout. Something I want to try though is to ask them to mix the seaweed salad in with the bowl that they  mix the sauces, toppings, and fish in. I need to keep that in mind for next time I go. The amount of choices you get is pretty good as well. You have the option for brown or white rice, you can do a sushi cheeto burrito (hot or original, I recommend the original), and you have a nice spread of things you can toss in there as well. They do have tamago, but they won't stick it in the burrito. Completely understandable because you wouldn't be able to close it at all.

Something else I like about this place is their free water station. I remember a barley tea and a roasted corn water, but I'm pretty sure there are one or two more. I think it's a nice thing to add on since soda can be too heavy of a drink to go with the meals they provide. They have reasonable lunch specials and if you eat in you get free miso soup. I will never argue with free. Every once in a while they will have promotions they show on Facebook where they'll  include some dessert of some sort or another appetizer with the meal.

But, they do have items like soft shell crab, octopus, and scallops, which others do not. Also unique are their suggested combination of sauces like LA Style (sesame oil, spicy chili, aloha sauce, and sriracha), Korean Style (sesame oil, aloha sauce, Korean spicy chili), and Japanese Style (sesame oil, wasabi mayo, and ponzu).

Their medium bowl ($11.50) is slightly more expensive than other places, but my bowl consisting of brown rice, seaweed salad, crab meat, tuna, yellowtail, octopus, masago, red onion, cilantro, pineapple, crispy onion, roasted garlic, bonito, ginger, sesame oil, sriracha, ponzu, and aloha sauce was more than enough.

I don't care how good the food is somewhere, if the employees annoy me I won't go back.  Business lost for them.",sVPCIq1qiCZJv-PuAwJRAQ,0,0,3,ypyxuCm6w7-wFQdnpk25-A

I ordered the tuna poke bowl with rice. It's a $9 bowl. You get your protein you choose how you want your tuna sauced (they have sauce styles on the wall) and you can pick your toppings right after. The best part is the tea they provide are complimentary! Anyway the tuna is good here, I get scared to order tuna at restaurants because some places put in the chewy muscle (there were none thank goodness) so I enjoyed my tuna bowl. 

I ordered a small bowl of rice for my son with 2 pieces of shrimp tempura. They were nice enough to accommodate my picky eating son.  Thank you! 

It was a great experience, with good music. When you play Porter Robinson, EXO and Madeon it makes your surroundings even better :)

They have items like hot Cheetos burrito, ramen, takoyaki, gyoza..the list goes on. 

Now what I like to do when I order from here is order a Small bowl with rice then add extra protein. It's extra but who doesn't want more fish. Fish is pretty fresh from the looks and taste of it whenever I've gone in. They also have so many add-ons to choose from as well as pre-made sauces to go into your poke bowl/burrito/salad. 

They also offer a variety of teas to go with your meal. Free of charge! Corn tea was interesting. But I prefer the barley.

What do I expect from a place that calls themselves ""Hawaiian""? I'm looking for friendly aloha vibes. Broke da mouth grindz.

Instead what I got was not so welcoming service, expensive/small portion and subpar food. Yes, I know poke is not the cheapest lunch. But compare to other poke options in town, this was the least amount of food I got for the price I paid. 

I did enjoy the different sauce combinations they offered, as well as their unlimited topping options. I ordered their poke bowl with salmon and various toppings, then chose poke poku sauce to go with it. Sauce was good, and not overpowering as I expected it to be. Overall it was pretty average.

I must say as a tea enthusiast, their complimentary tea bar was the highlight of my visit. They have 3 different tea options and all teas are nice and refreshing.

However, Poke Poku is an exception to the fad.

I recently moved to the complex next to it and my favorite poke place is now a twenty minute drive away so I decided to give it a try. We were not disappointed! I've already been five times. 

It is ordering made easy! Everything is up on the board for you to choose step by step. He portions are also generous. They have sizes s-xl. I went with the Medium which is 3 scoops of fish along with your sides but it was too much so started ordering the small which is perfect for me. I love that they have a variety of sauce mixtures put together for you to choose from to add to your fish(this is what makes it poke). I mix all of my add ins together so it makes he poke even better! I LOVE this place and if you're on the south west side of town, you should definitely give it a try. The staff is also normally very friendly with the exception of one girl who wasn't very happy the other day ? my only gripe is that I would like the fish to be cut a little smaller.

4108217,2016-12-19,4,hDyc9DdjGldhxis5E1rd3w,"I still have a few more local places to try, including a vaunted Hawaiian import (which is a bit like comparing apples to pears, but that's another story), but I'll just come out and say it: best poke bowl place I've tried so far.

Poke Poku is one of many similar restaurants on Rainbow Blvd that's trying to ride the latest fad. They're deep within a plaza next to Goodwill, and they're conveniently across the side street from beloved bubble tea shop Brew Tea Bar.

Poke Poku does bill itself as a ""Hawaiian"" poke restaurant, but it's still fashioned in the style of most poke bowl places in that you're assembling the product step-by-step a la Chipotle (but with seafood and typical ingredients):

""Start Here"" - there are more options now than they had when I peeked in during their first week. You can choose from a poke bowl/salad, ""Hawaiian Poke"" (served without rice/greens), or sushi burrito (one size fits all). I went with a large poke bowl ($13.50 for 4 scoops of protein). There are also numerous appetizers available, but those only need to be ordered at the register.

Step 1 (""Base"") - white rice, brown rice, mixed salad, baby kale, or a half and half mix of any of those. I stuck with the white rice.

The employee asked at this point if I wanted furikake, and I said yes. Why not have good seasoning, right?

Step 2 (""Sides"") - pick two of the seaweed salad, edamame, crab meat, spicy crab meat, avocado, or fried shrimp tempura. I went for seaweed salad and shrimp tempura, and both were actually about as good as you'd expect. Extra sides available for $1.50

Step 3 (""Protein"") - went with tuna, yellowtail, seared albacore, and salmon (after being informed that snapper was unavailable). Also available are bay scallop ,spicy tuna, soft shell crab, diced shrimp, and octopus, with extra proteins worth $1.75 each... hmm, maybe I should've tried to game them by doing a small bowl with two extra proteins?

""Sauce"" (not an actual step): select from predesigned mixtures of sauces, or perhaps create your own out of what appeared to be a dozen different sauces. I went with the namesake Poke Poku Style, which was sesame oil, spicy mayo, spicy chili, sriracha, and something called Aloha sauce (note from a Hawaiian co-worker: if this is the shoyu brand, then the sauce has two key components of traditional poke). The end result did not taste too spicy, so don't worry about those labels unless you're ultra-sensitive.

Step 4 (""Mix-ins""): I went with masago, tomato, cilantro, mango, red onion. Other options include cucumber, lettuce, pineapple, and organic tofu. After this step, the employee will mix by hand the items from steps 3 through 4 (including sauce), so all of these get coated in sauces before being transferred to your actual bowl.

Step 5 (""Toppings""): I can see why some of these are separate, but I wouldn't have minded others being mixed evenly. I picked green onion, roasted garlic, tamago, kizami nori (shredded seaweed; note that they add a whole piece of nori to the bowl at the end anyway), corn, and tobiko. I probably should've added shredded bonito, and other toppings included jalapeno, crispy onion, sea salt, and ginger.

Then it's cash register time, where they'll place your bowl on a tray. They also offered a small complimentary miso soup, which was actually pretty delicious and not too salty, and pointed out some free drinks on the side including something slightly bitter made from burdock root, a so-called jasmine tea that was really just weak tea, and a roasted corn drink that somewhat resembles barley tea and which I easily chose after quickly taste-testing them all.

My poke bowl was just thoroughly delicious for whatever combination of reasons. Seasonings and sauces were certainly key, but all of the fish were fresh (albeit not necessarily high-quality) and weren't cut too finely as I've had at other places. The white rice isn't sushi rice, but it certainly was cooked properly. All of the assorted add-ons can be tasted individually and were also fresh.

My friend and I also tried the takoyaki ($3.99) out of curiosity. While it's advertised as 6 pieces, it's more like 8 half-pieces, and it oddly appeared to have been cooked after being sliced. They were crunchy and I found my tako reasonably tender, although the texture of the filling was a little overcooked compared to what I've eaten elsewhere.

Poke Poku is a little pricey, but their main product is the best I've had in its genre. I've been trying to evaluate this form of restaurant on its own merits, rather than directly compared to sushi or traditional poke, and I've found none better. I should also disclaim that I've only just started trying to trick out poke bowls fully to my liking, but this was superior to two places where I've fully customized my bowls.

P.S. I'm eagerly awaiting the opportunity to try their food again closer to Henderson. They're aiming for a Feb. 2016 opening on Eastern Avenue in the EOS Fitness / Monta Chaya plaza.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,9,7,5,u-tZljMkJdrn78E3KjG4rQ

I am so impressed with everything about this place, especially the food. Obviously! I got a salad to go, huge portion, and began my way down the steps. You get two sides, and guess what? One of them is crab! Well both if you want! I mixed spicy with regular. Then we move to the beautiful pinkish, red, glorious, AHI tuna that caught my eye the moment we walked inside. Paired with fresh mix ins. I got the poke poku sauce, light siracha of course! The girl (pink hair) mixed the sauce flawlessly making sure the AHI was completely covered. We moved into the additions and I went to town, I recommend the garlic. This is a must! I have never seen this in poke, this is what made the entire bowl stand out. 

Everything about this bowl was fresh, and eloquently flavorful! This place has set my standards very high for the next poke place we eat at! Happy but sad! The staff was friendly and knowledgeable. They even came out to see how we liked it! Awesome!!!

Just stopped in for the first time last night! I'm beyond impressed! Beautifully designed, extremely personable and helpful staff, lots of specials.

Their approach to creating poke bowls are unique and stand out in comparison to the typical build your own poke bowls/sushi burritos all over town (you'll have to just head over and see for yourself what I'm talking about). Their portions are huge (ordered a medium and barely made a dent in mine), quality of food is great (their brown rice was cooked to perfection which surprisingly a lot of people get wrong and their sauces actually had great flavor! I find a lot of places sauces to be super bland), got a free miso soup for dining in (which was so yummy), and they even have freshly brewed herbal iced teas COMPLIMENTARY that are so amazing!! I had the jasmine tea.

What did I get
I got a small salad with 2 proteins and got the yellowtail and the salmon. I chose to have mine tossed with no sauce, cause I don't like my fish to be saucy, then topped it off with some random stuff. Got soy sauce on the side. IT WAS GREAT! They were big portions! And I was stuffed! There are a lot of toppings to chose from to be tossed with the fishes and then top your bowl off.

Environment
The restaurant was on a strip plaza. Easy to find. There is a ice cream place next door, great way to end the meal! If its your first time, you may need to take your time to read the menu, but it is very simple. There is specialty sauces they have that they will toss with your fish, but you are always welcome to mix your own stuff together! Your choice! There is teas to the side that are free! Barley, Jasmine and regular.

Niceness of Staff
She was really really nice. It was my first time there and she took the time to explain things to me. I decided to do the bowl but because I wanted vegetables, she recommended I do the salad plate so it holds more! Yay! Thanks for the help!

Dollar $
I would consider this very inexpensive and tasty. Especially for fish, it is hard to get good quality for a reasonable price. I am definitely happy with the meal!

Yes?
Absolutely! I would definitely go here again. Especially if I am trying not to eat rice, these are the salads I rather have!

I think it's all about the choices and amounts of fish.  Monkey usual was a Medium bowl(3 proteins) with half brown rice half salad, soft shell crab, double Salmon, Korean sauce and all the fixins. Now sans the rice, a Medium Salad is a huge box of greens plus all the above. 

Friends who have tried other Poke joints and disliked Poke overall because of them, changed their tunes here. You're welcome. This my go to spot for Poke. I don't want it anywhere else. Poke Poku nailed down the value in its pricing, punch card and free delicious teas while dining in. Staff is always friendly, patient and kind. Great environment.

They have outdoor seating but it was 110 degree outside when I went on Father's Day. This father brought his two daughters here and they sat at the little kids table which was the cutest thing ever. Servers were really nice here. The toppings here was fresh and plentiful. I loved the variety of choices. I got the small poke bowl with half rice and half salad. I loved that they give you this option cause I wanted the two options. They give you two sides, two proteins choices (freaking awesome because most places only give you one protein choice and then charge you crazy for other protein) and you get unlimited toppings and mix in choices. They don't charge you extra for masago or other toppings choices. I love this place! So lucky I stopped in here. I highly recommend this place.

You can't go wrong w the Poke Poku sauce or the LV Style sauce.

The girls working today - Sun afternoon - are both polite, efficient and hard working. (Asian girl w long braids and blonde w med length pony tail/forearm tat).

Don't be intimidated first trip if you have never been to Poke Poku, just let them know and they hopefully will walk you through the steps to building a bowl or a burrito - and if you're lucky you won't get the impatient guy I had the first time YEEESH.

Cutting to the chase, this is another great poké option in the southwest area. I might ever so slightly favor this place over Sweet Poké thanks to having tobiko in the lineup.

Poke poku is similar to the other poke places in the way that it's a chipotle style way of ordering. I ordered a small bowl & that came with 2 scoops of protein.

I'm not even finished eating my poke but I felt so compelled to rave about it because it is very worth the praise that other yelp reviews have given it. They have 3 sizes (small, medium, and large) and as I have mentioned in a previous Yelp review, usually poke places only have regular and large sizes. The amount of toppings that you can get for no additional charge is huge! Including 5 different colors of masago, a super duper delicious soft shell crab mix, full cloves of roasted garlic, bonito flakes, etc. I also love that they are really generous with their portions...you will definitely be full even with a small! Additionally, they have complimentary health teas on the side which go well with the poke! 

Service is very friendly and helpful(they even gave me an extra topping choice for no reason), sauce choices are unique and delicious, and overall this place is just plain awesome. Do yourself a favor and stop by! I live quite far from here, but after trying this place, I will definitely be back because I think I found my new favorite poke restaurant!",wi0d3o8tU6ahnUllJ3332w,3,1,5,IH-Ai8mBUzqzJspV1hHh2g

Rant: pineapple, mango, corn, siracha, ponzu, eel sauce.  No, no, no, no, no, no!  We don't put these things in our poke in Hawaii!!!  Stop calling it Hawaiian poke!  Don't even get me started on putting pineapples on pizza.  Grrrrr.

That said, what is offered is very good ""SoCal style"" poke bowls and wraps.

Keeping it real, the seafood is previously frozen but not gassed or treated with color additives.  All good, the norm.  Crab is imitation, AKA krab.  Rice is of average quality, Best when served warm. Veg is fresh. Finally sauces, bold, all with a nice sesame oil flavor, those containing ponzu, have good acidity making them refreshing.

Tip: pass on poke only.  Poor value at $22/lb.

Ordering is, well you know the drill. As a bowl or burrito (the bowl is better as the burrito is so stuffed it oozes out and falls apart).  Mix and match up to three proteins to satiate your hunger. It's your creation.

Unlimited toppings a plus.  Servings are generous.  Free miso soup (dine in only).  Look for check-in offers (10% off with yelp or Facebook check-in's as of this writing).

Extremely friendly and patient off strip service.  Novices need not to stress.

I would have given 5 stars but I am not a fan of the new Miso recipe at all. It has a lot of gunk at the bottom of the cup which isn't tasty at all.

I love poke, when it's made fresh and to order. No grocery slop that may have been sitting, dressed, for up to two days, yuch. I've only ordered from this establishment once, and I've only ordered two things, but the bowl was so extraordinarily good that I had to comment.

What I had:
TAKOYAKI:
A bit disappointing, but not surprising, considering that most Asian establishments in this town don't do it right. I may be overly critical; not only did I learn to eat TAKOYAKI when I lived in Japan, I lived in Osaka, the takoyaki capital. So I didn't subtract any stars 

MEDIUM POKE BOWL:
I don't really need to note the particular ingredients I chose for my bowl, save to say that everything was fresh and flavorful. You build your bowl from the bottom up, according to your taste, and the options are numerous! The tuna, while not prime quality ahi, was decent and cut bite-sized enough to cover any inherent flaws, like sinews. If you ordered the same amount of maguro nigiri at a sushi restaurant, you'd probably pay $80 and not get anything but the sushi; this bowl was only $13 and was delicious and full of extra yummies. Small and large bowls are available, too, to suit the size of your appetite.

The restaurant also offers poke salads, in case rice isn't, well, your bowl of rice. And sushi burritos, too, whatever THEY are (yes, I'm a genuine sushi snob!). I didn't see misoshiru on the menu, perhaps my eyes just passed it by.

My only complaint is that when you order medium to large bowl there're lots of rice but the sauce they put on the fish for these sizes are not enough so bottom of the bowl will get no flavors,a3yOeL5b0lzbo1ORHF2yHg,2,1,4,qRw96euygxRI3hRHWM0Ywg

I'm a dietary vegan and I eat fish a couple times a month, so have no fear if you are vegan they will set you up right!!! It is rare as a vegan that you go out to eat and find anything palatable. Oh my! Forget that noise! They pile it high give you extra yummy topping choices in place of your proteins and they have tofu!!!! YUMMY!!!!!! Now after writing this review I don't care that it's almost 8 at night I'm ordering in some Poke Poku!!! Woot Woot!!! I may have a mild addiction!

5918896,2017-10-23,2,hDyc9DdjGldhxis5E1rd3w,"I got a few missed call from my friend Leo. So I texted him asking ""what's up?""  Turns out he wanted to know if I have had lunch already.

It was like 2pm, but I managed to miss lunch while studying for a TAM card exam, plus procrastinating on Facebook and also watched a few Tasty Japan videos. 

Apparently it is also Poke Poku's One Year Anniversary and they are offering complimentary appetizer sampler and dessert with your entree order all day this weekend (Oct 21 & 22).  Sounds good to me!  I love having foodie friends that help keep me in the loop for these promos.  And if you check-in on Facebook, you get 10% off your order.

Mochi Ice Cream Free - Green Tea or Red Bean (I suggest you eat this first, mine was melted by the time I finished my large poké salad)
3pcs of Goyza Free
3pcs of Shrimp Shumai Free
5pcs of Calamari Free
Miso Soup Free (Dine-in Only)
And Healthy Water- always on the house (3 varieties of iced brewed tea)

As far as Poké goes, it is NOT traditional Hawaiian style, in spite of the restaurant's name. Brah, if that is exactly what you're craving for, then you will be disappointed. Come on, even the Poké occasionally sold at select LV Costco locations are more authentic. No stink talk intended. Just laying some truth. I will also not say SoCal or Korean fusion version of Poké are not also grinds. (double negatives, so it is GRINDS!) Actually it is quite popular on the West Coast and made its way to Las Vegas.  In fact there seems to be a ""Poké"" bowl or sushi burrito eatery open on every block in this SW part of town.

While waiting for the 4 people ahead of me in line placing their orders, I distracted myself posting pictures to Instagram Story and snapping a few more pictures for Yelp and Facebook check-in.  Leo said I waited a long time, but I didn't really noticed.  And I also did not utilized my time more wisely studying the menu, so I ended up ordering a large salad and then haphazardly picked the other items (I don't want to be that guy taking forever with the order and pissing off the people patiently waiting behind me) to complete my order.

So ended up with the following mad creation:
(Step 1) Mixed Salad
(Step 2) Seaweed Salad + Fried Shrimp Tempura (pass on this next time)
(Step 3) Salmon + Scallop + Yellowtail + Seared Albacore
(Step 4) Everything (but they skipped on the Pineapple, Mango and Organic Tofu)
(Step 5) Everything, except Jalapeño + Sea Salt
And for someone that does not particularly like spicy food, I went with Gangster Style for the Sauce option (Sesame Oil + Spicy Chili + Sriracha + Spicy Chili +  Spicy Chili + Spicy Chili). Next time I will be sure to read the menu first than survey the premises with keepsake photos. 

Anyway, the portion is generous and although I paid $13.15 for a large salad (with the 10% FB check-in discount), I still felt it was a reasonable deal. Plus they gave me a fried appetizer sampler and Mochi Ice Cream to celebrate their One Year Anniversary. 

Today may be my first visit, but for sure it will not be the last.  I still have 9 more sauces to try.

So HAAAAPPPPY One Year ANNIVERSARY POKE POKU!!!
And best of luck in the opening of the next two locations in the Ninth Island.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,8,5,4,fZfU57XTLddvpuQRHOww_w

It seemed like any other poke place so i ordered a 2 scoop bowl with rice, 2 scoops salmon, ny style sauce, crab meat and some toppings.  It was all put in a tiny bowl so i was a little disappointed. Once i ate it though..OMG! The flavor!! The freshness!! I was beyond pleased!! And the small bowl looked deceiving because there was plenty of food in there for my full meal. My only complaints....the crab was a little too creamy and the forks are super flimsy!! Yes, those are my only complaints!

It did not disappoint. 

Top tip. Only order the large if you are HANGRY. Next time I'm getting a size smaller.
