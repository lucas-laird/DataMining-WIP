The young male worker got my order wrong and I had to drive back which was inconvenient, but Javier (the owner or manager) made it all worthwhile. He corrected my order and let me have a little extra. The worker genuinely apologized as it was an honest mistake. I appreciate a business that owns up to their mistakes and goes above and beyond for their customers. The only downfall is that this place takes cash only (most of the time), but these tamales are worth giving a try! Oh, and maybe label the packages as to avoid giving the wrong tamales. I would call before going to make sure they have what you want. Sometimes, they are out of certain ones.

Wow! I was impressed. 
Currently, Patty's Tamales only sells tamales to go. These tamales are excellent. They are  huge and filled with a lot of meat. The masa  was moist and not dry. I ordered the chicken in red sauce, chicken in mole, and the pineapple. All were a big hit when served for dinner.

I have fond childhood memories of family friends loading me down with containers of delicious tamales during the holiday season when I was growing up in Phoenix, so this place sent me into a nostalgia groove.

I stopped in around noon and ordered one cheese/chile and one chicken/chile- unfortunately they only had chicken at the time, so I took two of those. I took them back to my car and opened up the bag and was amazed at how large each tamale was! Just as I remember, wrapped in moist wax paper, tender morsels clinging to the corn husk. After one bite, I did not regret that they only had chicken/chile. The tamales were stuffed to overflowing with juicy, spicy chicken in a tart green sauce with a thin and tender savory sweet masa shell. Every bite was heaven!

At 1.50 each, these are an absolute steal! The service is quick and the counter staff are friendly. There is currently no seating, so expect a takeaway. These travel well, so consider grabbing a half dozen for dinner. I can't wait to stop here again on my next trip through Vegas!",gdra9cxGRv0XqoK4477kPg,3,2,5,duK_TPDpdHnLYdtLg8syVQ

955085,2017-03-28,0,oE6gKgUfMd74m77d6hG9qg,"I've been reading the reviews for Patty's, and I love tamales, so today, after running errands in the area, I decided to give them a try.

First impression: I arrived at around 10:55am. Upon entering, the first thing I took notice of(and, I do so in any restaurant or food establishment, even grocery stores) are the floors. It's one of my pet peeves...to walk into a business that sells food and see the floors sticky, dirty, and just plain unkempt. Well, I must say, that was not the case with Patty's. Floors were spotless and I'm talking pristine. Windows were crystal clear. The counter was clean, wiped down. And, upon looking in the back to the open kitchen, I could see that the work area and the place (the stove top) that held the food I was about to order, definitely met my expectations, cleanliness wise. 

I approach the counter and I am greeted/acknowledged by a man, possibly the owner?  I begin scanning the menu, which is simple, and I so appreciate that. I then ask him to please give me his opinion on the green chicken tamales, in regards to the spiciness level, that is, because I'd read through the yelp reviews that the green chicken is overboard spicy. Well, he did confirm that it is super, super spicy. I prefer green sauce over red, and as other reviewer's have commented, red sauce here is mild and green sauce is hot. But, while I do love a little heat in a majority of the dishes I eat, I cannot handle too much heat. Too much and it becomes unenjoyable really fast for me. Anyways, I decided on just giving the red sauce chicken tamales a try. I ordered two. Price was $2 each, totaling $4, no tax. Not bad at all! The guy that took my order went back to the stove where the tamales are kept in humongous stock pots, and retrieved two tamales. I could see the steam emanating from them. Exciting!! 

I thought the man that took my order was very welcoming, professional, and just based on that first impression alone, I'd consider returning, especially if the food is up to par, as well. He asked if I lived in the area, if this was my first time visiting Patty's, and he did treat me, the customer, how I feel I should be treated, how I think any customer would want to be treated.

So, I left, and of course tried one of the tamales I'd purchased, once I arrived home. The tamales are a decent size, not small by any means. They're also heavy, just another indicator of their huge size, and that's always a plus. Next, I unwrapped the corn husks and delved in. The inside of the tamales were packed with chicken and the mild red sauce. I thought it tasted just as it should. The meat wasn't dry, and it did have flavor. The masa, (my favorite part of a tamale!) was also flavorful, but the most important thing to me was the meat/masa ratio, which was perfecto! Not too much chicken, vice versa. The taste was good and I enjoyed it.

As I mentioned above, I love chicken tamales! If, (or when, I should say) I am craving one, I'd certainly consider coming back here. The customer service, in addition to the freshness of the food, the speedy service, the price, ($2! for a large tamale? Uh, yeah!) and the cleanliness of the place, definitely warrants a second visit from me. Although, I will say- like other reviewers have- that this is not a sit-in restaurant. It's take out only, so just another reminder from me. 

To sum it up, this was a pleasant experience for me. If you like tamales and happen to be on the East side, I'd suggest you pay them a visit.",wWjM6sgMiwjsCE8SjlM9ZQ,0,0,4,On98R72DCQl0uzCXBOyltw

Cant go wrong with fresh! It literally burned my leg when i set the bag down oncd i got in my car. Most importantly, it melted into my mouth.

1357587,2017-02-02,2,oE6gKgUfMd74m77d6hG9qg,"OMG!!!! So I decided to try this place out since I missed the Christmas rush for tamales. Place was empty when I got there and was served immediately. I  ordered green spicy chicken and the red pork spicy.  He pulled them right out of the pot and were still warm by the time I got home. There aren't any seats to wait or eat there but since I was helped quickly didn't matter anyway. 

Opened my bag and these things are HUGE!!! And I really mean HUGE!!!  They both were sooo good I didn't know what to with myself. The spicy pork with the red sauce is pretty spicy but not too bad. Now that green chicken one is really really spicy and I'm still sniffling from these but since I love spicy food I was in heaven. I wouldn't recommend these if you can't handle real spicy food go with the mild chicken green ones. You also get alot of meat compared to the masa which means you can definitely probably can only eat 1 or 2. So did you get that I said they were HUGE????  Okay good. 

Since I'm a Cali born and raised mexican food obsessed person, I recommend giving them a try. They are $2.00 each but well worth it because they are HUGE. People who complain about them being $2.00 have probably never bought them before. I mean those mini street tacos are about $2.00 each and nowhere near the size of these tamales and I have to eat about 6 of those little things to get full. But enough of that rant so don't let the price discourage you. The only drawback was they charged me an extra $1.00 to use my card and didn't tell me. But I knew that before while I read previous reviews. Just think that's something to make customers aware of ahead of charging my card. 

I will be a returning customer as I am extremely satisfied with this place.",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,3,1,4,ZHi2tsJYfQHByStymShKgw

The menu is fairly basic, offering pork, chicken and cheese tamales as well as sweet corn and pineapple. They have red, green and mole sauces. As of 6/10 they had shrimp tamales too.

Apparently they don't always have their full menu. I am not sure if they run out or what but it's best to go early. My friend went in on a Friday afternoon and placed an order of what we wanted, then picked them up and paid a few hours later. I ordered 2 jalapeño and cheese, 2 red pork, and 2 sweet corn and pineapple tamales. It was $9 for 6 HUGE tamales with plentiful fillings. You cannot beat this deal. 

My friend got a couple mole and chicken tamales that I got to taste and it was so yummy. I love mole sauce and hadn't seen it offered in a tamale before, but what a great idea. I do have to say my favorite was the sweet corn and pineapple though. It was sweet and sinful like I was eating a dessert. The jalapeño and cheese were delicious but holy crap those are spicy. I had heartburn for hours after, but it was so worth it. I let my man eat the pork ones and he loved them.

You can't take pictures, and it's handy to be able to snap a pic of the menu for later use (and would probably be good for their business, but, alas).  If you don't see the sign and start to take a pic, they'll let you know in no uncertain terms, so be aware.  However, the tamales really are good.  Some of the hot varieties are a little too hot, but they're still delish -- just be careful if you're not into spicy heat in your food.  Tamales are enormous, so keep that in mind when you order.  Wasn't a fan of the dessert tamales, but I've never gone for sweet tamales.  Ambience is basically fast food tamales.  They run out of tamales during busy times, so best to go early.

If you look at the reviews their new menu is the green one. Only 4 different choices.  Their old menu is the one with sweet corn and such that they don't have anymore. The tamales are $2.00 each. 2 tamales was more than enough for each of us, they are a pretty good size and have meat throughout the whole tamale. 

Really really heartbroken there was no sweet corn because it's all in the reviews and the menu shown on yelp.

Patty's Tamales is one of my favorite places to eat. Their location is only a couple minutes from my house and their quality of food is top notch.

They also gave me an option that I can pay in advance and they'd make whatever tamale I'd want for the next day, since they only have certain kinds throughout the week. The kid that handles the front is very friendly and efficient. He always tried his best to make things better when things didn't go as planned before. I'm really happy and grateful that they decided to better themselves with how they handle their customers. I will forever return and indulge in these delicious and inexpensive tamales.

You can get a variety of different fillings for your tamales and I went with spicy pork, and the mild chicken.  With the prices beyond reasonable, a dozen for only $18.00, how could one not be giddy with anticipation to get home and start unwrapping these masa filled delights.

I must agree with previous reviews on portion size. The tamales themselves were stuffed full of meat, spices and sauce.  Only was able to eat two before I was starting to feel full.

They are huge compared to the average tamale and they are filled with meat or cheese, depending on your order, and not dry and all masa. It's definitely not a dine in restaurant, my office orders for lunch and just picks up. Cash only is some what bothersome, but to be honest if they took cards I might be over there everyday...

For the reviewers complaining about certain flavors not being available all day, My office is right across the street so we've gotten to know the owner's fairly well and asked them what the deal was. They have different ladies employed that make each of the sauces  at different times of the day or on different days all together. Everything is made fresh for that day, they don't like to hold over tamales, or sauces. They want the food to be fresh and hot, not like the kinds you could buy at any other grocery store that could have been sitting in the fridge for days or even weeks ( YIKES.) It is distinguishing factor that make these tamales better than any other fast service one out there. THESE TAMALES ARE FREAKING FRESH!! 

The best thing to do is make a quick call and ask what flavors they have available before you head over to pick them up just to be sure they'll have what you are looking for.

It was better than any place I can think of to get them: a mercado like Cardenas, LINDO, Roberto's type places. It was so good. I took em home and fried them in a little oil. The masa was light and fluffy and it was just really good.

I can't wait to stop by and get some of the other offerings! The guy up front was nice also.",pZ6P_1V-bTSoYG1fg1TXzw,25,20,4,ICKyv4Kj0eF6eOnL455edQ

I've been wanted to try this place and so so happy I stopped it. People aren't kidding they really do run out of food so make sure to call ahead of time to see what's available. 
The tamales were literally just done being cooked and damn did they smell amazing. I had a pleasant conversation with the owner while he was getting my order together. I asked him a few question about the food and he happily answered everything. The place itself is pretty empty which doesn't bother me one bit. So don't plan on eating there because they have no tables. It's all about the take out. 
Today my family and tried the cheese and peppers(spicy), chicken in green sauce(spicy), and chicken in red sauce(mild). Spicy really is spicy so be aware, but it's the good kind of spice that is packed with flavors and still gives you a kick. The mild was delicious as well but I think I prefer the spicy ones. A dozen costs $18 or they are $1.50 a piece. Great deal. 
I'll definitely be back to try the other flavors. The owner told me the chicken in brown sauce was his recommended favorite and I also saw they make corn with pineapple. That sounds interesting and a definite must try.

I originally was alerted to this place thanks to my trusty Yelp app! I had a hankering for Tamales so to Patty's we went. Don't expect much in the way of decor or ambiance this place is a bare bones hole in the wall. That's my favorite kind of place! Plus, make sure you bring CASH! You know it has to be good when they have huge bubbling pots of tamales and the little old grannies making the tamales in back. On the day my husband and I went they didn't have their full menu to pick from they only had chicken in brown sauce, pork in red sauce and sweet corn with pineapple. On our first trip in that day (yes, we went back later for dinner.) we just ordered three chicken in brown sauce. Patty's prices are also very reasonable $1.50 per tamale. We brought them home and dug in. They were enormous tamales with a layer of thin masa and filled with spicy chicken in a brown sauce. They were so moist and the flavor was out of this world! My husband, who normally doesn't enjoy tamales, asked to go back for dinner. How could I not say yes to more tamales! 

On this trip we got three of the chicken in brown sauce and three of their pork in red sauce. Both are delicious! The pork is slightly spicer then the chicken. I'm definitely loving the flavor of the chicken in brown sauce the best so far. I'm looking forward to trying Patty's green chicken tamales. 

They are a great east side location for some seriously yummy tamales. Bring the cash and they will have the tamales. I'm super excited to have this gem so close to me. Tamales for everyone!!!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,9,5,5,KUsxXuDWO9fEJqtwaI1-Mw
5067018,2016-01-25,3,oE6gKgUfMd74m77d6hG9qg,"So rewind to about 5 years ago. Every time we would go to church in the east side there was a man selling tamales outside of our church at St.Anne in a cooler. I used to love grabbing a few and taking them home to eat if they lasted until we got there. Sometimes I saw him at parks nearby selling his goods. Eventually we moved out of the eastside area and we stopped going to that church because it was too far from us. When we returned here and there he was nowhere to be found. Even the business card I received from him was long gone. So finally we decided to try Pattys tamales. I was in the car with my son and my significant other ran in to grab the tamales. He told me it was the same guy who used to sell outside out church! Yes! Thank you! Gone are the days I have gone without these delicious tamales. Let's face it. Good tamales are hard to come by. Either they're dry or too much masa to meat ratio or the vice Versa. Patty is his wife. Aka Pattys Tamales! 

The inside of this place is pretty bare. Nothing but a few tables and the counter to pay. Getting them to go is an obvious choice. Which is what we planned to do anyway. We wanted to try the sweet corn and pineapple but were told it was the number one seller and they ran out. I was happy the had the green chili chicken tamale. So we got a few of those a few chili and cheese and the brown sauce tamale. 

The green chicken tamale is the one I would always get years ago. Perfectly spicy and filled with meat! They're not ripping you off on meat and especially at $1.50 theyre a steal! This one is my favorite! 

The cheese and chile one has jalepeno and cheese. Almost seemed like an American cheese. It was good but I didn't prefer the cheese. It is spicy though so if you can't handle spicy stay away. 

The chicken and brown sauce was my least fav. I believe the brown sauce is mole. I didn't prefer the flavor. 

These tamales are delicious and for $1.50 each you're really getting your money's worth they're pretty big tamales! I'm so happy I found my tamale guy, We will definitely be back to satisfy our tamale cravings in the future. Hopefully next time they will have some sweet ones next time!",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,8,5,4,O-voJGJHx47a7KdEha5kqw

Ok, the tamales were HUGE. I'll give them that but they were just mediocre.
