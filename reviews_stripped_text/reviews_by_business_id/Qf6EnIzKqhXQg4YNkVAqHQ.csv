103398,2014-11-30,0,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,WORST EXPERIENCE! my family took my mom and sister out for their birthdays when we arrived at 7:00pm everything was good up until tthe drinks. Once we ordered our meals the waitress returns 5 minutes later stating that they do not have lobster tail so me and my brother chose something else. We waited for 40 minutes until the manager came to say that there is no more salmon and two plates we ordered had to be changed. She brought a menu first we noticed it was one plate so my husband chose a different meal. Then the waitress come along confused saying that there was no more salmon I had told her yes we were told she then mentioned well did the manager told you that you can change the salmon to tilapia. We were shocked because we were not mentioned that. Then we continued to wait until the manager comes out again saying no there is a second plate that has salmon you can change it to tilapia. We continued to wait at this time most of the table were empty on drinks so the waitress comes along and took 20 minutes to come back with drinks Finally after waiting for so long our food is ready. Everyone received their plates except my dad. I told the waitress the plate you are holding is my dad she looked at me confused and called the manager I then mentioned the same thing and the manager was trying to solve who plate it was until they realized that my dad was the only one left with no plate (REALLY). During the time we were eating the drinks did not get refilled once we were done that's when the waitress comes over asking if we wanted more drinks. (At this moment I was upset of the poor customer service) the staff was not coordinated at all! We were discounted $7 dollars but that seemed like a big joke. Would not recommend this place at all. All I was looking for my sister and mom to have a good birthday but it ended as a disaster with bad experience.,u0Cn1TZH59wwsyfHkDyeFQ,1,0,1,Xh-OLtbVOV4DWhK8Ev6b7A

138132,2013-09-08,1,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"I went in to red Lobster with thoughts and aspirations of enjoying plump juicy shrimp. And to enjoy said shrimp in quantities that would baffle modern science. Fortunately for I it was endless shrimp time at Red Lobster. How fortunate was I. Or so I thought. The lunch time experience began when we were waiting outside to be seated and witnessed our soon be be server bringing in a Taco bell fiesta ten pack through the front door. That's odd I thought. If I only knew..... Soon after being seated we meet our server, but with out her tacos. She begins to to take our order which is fairly simple since we are here with one things on our minds. Unfortunately she is interrupted by another hostess which tells her about some more tables she must attend to. This is the beginning of the end. She brings back our Cesar salads which are bland and tasteless at best. But no worries I am here for the shrimp. The shrimp arrives some 20 minutes later and is what one would expect from red lobster. Probably pre-frozen but tasty and numerous none the less. The shrimp was fine and the promise was ""all you could eat."" which should be ""all you can tolerate."" As I continue to enjoy the plates of shrimp in front of me the following plates seem to be taking longer and longer to arrive at our table. Our servers hospitality seemed to become more and more forced and in its place an uncomfortable air of ""are you full yet?"" A quick trip into the bathroom reviled a nightmare one would expect from a shady wrong side of town gas station. Never have I experienced a floor so sticky, it might well be confused for a massive piece of fly paper strewn with remnants of discarded toilet paper. And soon orders were becoming ""forgotten in the kitchen."" I tried to be patient but after the second time of this and spending 3 hours inside of red lobster my patience reached its end. I did not eat all I could, but I have tolerated all I was able to. Next time shrimp is on the menu, it will not be at Red Lobster.",5jfXwpO23OQ8XFeleN-lag,1,0,2,ifB8Hod1IAOwYIZKO9hkyw

913495,2016-02-14,0,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"I love Red Lobster! The food is always awesome no matter what location I go to. But this one has the worst service! This is my second time here in the past 6 months, both times I've had to wait for a table to be cleaned before I was sat. Normally this doesn't bother me... But both times after waiting and being escorted to my table, while walking through the restaurant all the empty tables were dirty. 
Also, both times I was able to go through the entire menu, discuss with my boyfriend what we were ordering, debate back and forth on what appetizer we were going to get before our server even greeted us to take drink order. This happened at our 1st visit, so this time we just happened to glance at the clock after we were seated (we had a feeling we were going to get the same kind of service after we saw all the tables were dirty again) it took our server over 15 minutes to greet us for drink orders and then another 5-10 minutes to get our drinks and might I add we ordered a water and a Sprite. 

And it's not just that we had bad luck with servers... Another couple walked in the same time as us. After they waiting for their table to be cleaned they were seated... in a different section then us but we could still see their table from ours. After we waited and finally got our drinks we looked over and saw they were just placing their order for drinks. 

I'm an incredibly patient person, and I've worked in the industry so I'm not one to complain if you can tell there is a shortage of staff or they are incredibly packed.

Last night my wife and I came for supper and had the ""Endless Shrimp Special"" Red Lobster has been advertising.  Upon our entry, I quickly noted that their wasn't anybody standing or sitting ahead of us. We were greeted right away with a friendly smile from Cecilia. She took note that it was just the two of us and told us it would be about 10 minutes for us to be seated. I looked down the hall and into the dining area and I could clearly see available tables.  I decided not to say anything about the 10 minute wait. 
At the 10 minute mark, Cecilia asked to seat us.  A few minutes later, our server Talia came around with another friendly smile   and asked if she could bring us any drinks/and or place our order as she overheard my wife and I speaking about the endless shrimp.  I have to say that Talia was very prompt with expediting food and making sure that our drinks were never sitting empty for more than a minute or two. Props to her for doing a great job!  
My second ""needs improvement"" comment for the evening (the first being the seating time) is directed for whom I assume was the manager. I can only describe her as being long blonde haired lady with a tattoo on her right arm that extends to her elbow. As she was working the floor thanking other customers for coming in and joining in on their respective chit chat at their tables.   She completely ignored us. I held eye contact with her 3 times with half a smile and she just looked the other way as if she was being bothered.... ??? 
I was going to tell her how well a job her staff was doing and how much we were enjoying our dinner!...but she never came around.  
The preparation of the food was spot on!  Every shrimp order that arrived at out table was extremely hot, yet never was the shrimp rubbery to the taste. Perfecto!!  Last night we enjoyed our dinner very much.",iSD-cPCUFNfXkCNgTKCz5w,5,2,4,vyk299Q_r5BUxgcGUl1-IQ

I've noticed a steady decline in the food quality, an incline in price, and, at least at the location that I *used to* frequent (Las Vegas, South Decatur), the service has gone to hell.   
The last two dining experiences I have had there have been awful.  The time before last I feel so awkward and uncomfortable with the waiter's attitude and demeanor.. he ACTUALLY reached out to shake my hand when he presented the check.  WHO DOES THAT???    I spoke to the manager and got an aloof, almost insulted response to my complaints.   Not apologetic, at least not in a sense that was anywhere near sincerity. 

This last time.. which will be my LAST time eating at this restaurant, The waiter, a young man named Chase, was absolutely off his game, if he ever had one to begin with that is.   First he argues with me about ordering add-ons, trying to sell me on another option that was about 8 dollars more expensive.  Refills on my water, or my husband's iced tea were pretty much out of the question, my ceasar salad came out with hardly any dressing on it and he argued ""this is how I make mine, since most people complain that there is too much dressing.""   He then took 10 minutes to bring me a side of dressing.  We received a basket with 3 biscuits (for two people), and even though I put the empty basket at the edge of the table, we were never offered more biscuits.  
My food arrived.  My fried shrimp (which, it turned out were slightly undercooked) came paired with a side of KETCHUP, instead of cocktail sauce.   This is a seafood restaurant where the staff do not know the difference between cocktail sauce and ketchup!!!    So, then he takes 15 minutes to bring me cocktail sauce.   

To sum up:  mediocre, overpriced food, served by idiots.  Unapologetic, apathetic management.  I will not be back.",GuamoK7UMeQJ4WP-U3hlRQ,4,0,1,9B00Iy5vRXSm1RjF5COruA

the prices are just a bit more expensive that what i'm used to but let me tell you the ultimate feast is everything.....i really mean an ultimate feast!!! the crab legs were huge, lobster tail was huge, baked potato with all the fixings, fries were good and hot, and both kinds of shrimp were good.  i didn't get to eat it all since i had the salad and bread before we ate but it was just as good when i re-heated my leftovers.

service when we got to the table was ok just hate i have to ask for water more than once.  i am a water drinker and need my thirst quenched.  needless to say we had a great time and will definitely be going back again!!!",KEerqlFNhzl1I-yVK6mHVA,0,1,4,g712lar8HdAz6cn8IA_e7A

Anyways, going back on point, the wait was about 20-30 minutes, not bad as to other places. I was pretty hungry and so was my friends, so the orders got in quick and food started coming out. 

First plate was the Alfredo, gotta get the Alfredo man, and soy-wasabi grilled shrimp. Alfredo was tasty, but it was a bit too thick on the sauce. Felt like it kind of overwhelmed my whole mouth. Overall, not bad not bad. Only got two plates of this, one in the beginning and one to end. Can't fill up stomach room with carbs !

Soy-wasabi and shrimp scambis are the go-to dishes for the best benefits of maximum shrimp consumption. Ask for no rice on the wasabi grilled shrimp plate, it'll just come out shrimp. Perfect? Yeah. It was the tastiest of all shrimp dishes too. Scambi was not bad, bit too buttery for my liking. The hand-breaded shrimp wasn't bad too. Got tired of eating it though. We kept getting orders for it because the waitress kept mistaking our table. Nevertheless, still shrimp. I wish I ate more though, but the cheddar biscuits got me bloated and gassy.. Too much information.. But it was uncomfortable :l. 

Our waitress was nice! She kept asking us what we wanted next and kept bringing them in a fast paced manner. She told us the top seat of most shrimp eaten is 32 plates. Maybe I'll come back and try to take the crown ! Oh and our party discovered that our friend has a minor shrimp intolerance for the first time after eating a truckload of shrimp.

Maybe...no, definitely avoid their chicken. I highly doubt they are serving fresh chicken. It had a really weird texture, I can't explain it but trust me it was not quality. Plus it was the thinnest cut, half if it fatty and the bottom of it was over cooked so over all I had four bites worth at most. 

My daughter really enjoyed the crab legs and her broccoli, she didn't touch her Mac and cheese. My fiancé and my sister really liked their crab legs and lobster. FOR ME, the best part of dinning at this Red Lobster was their garlic biscuits, I love those tastey little rolls. The host was really nice, we were seated quickly, we were helped by a server (Linda) right away and she was very sweet. The food came out in good time as well and our drinks were refilled without having to ask. 

BIG FAT NEGATIVE...
There were two flies hanging around our table, landing on the sides of our glasses and attempting to rest on our platted food. When I looked over at the big windows there  was a few more flies hanging out on them. Very unappetizing to see.

If this Red Lobster is any indication, they've experienced something of a massive upgrade. Gone are the days of glaring, operating-room lighting and family fast-food styled interiors. Now we have mood lighting, soft and calming; art on the walls; separate dining sections to baffle the noise of conversation; and soothing color schemes that elevate Red Lobster above its humble beginnings and into a more sophisticated family restaurant offering. Tired of McDonalds and want to offer your kids a taste of the grown-up world?  This is a good intermediary. 

However, a few downsides. Our waitress was a little pushy with the recommendations, which felt like upselling. Not cool in any dining establishment. If I want recommendations, I'll ask. I want to feel like I'm dining, not shopping at the mall. 

The high quality photos on the menu of food items surpassed the actual presentation so that our entrees were mildly disappointing to look at when they arrived. I wish this style would just disappear from restaurants altogether, but it definitely doesn't suit RL anymore as they work to improve their appearance. Adopt a simpler text-only menu that both looks more professional, makes it easier for customers to decide, and doesn't lead to disappointment when the food arrives, please. 

The prices are somewhat steep on some items, and the drink I had (pina colada) tasted great, but there was no recognizable alcohol in it (and I'm small at 130lbs). 

So, we'll go back sometime--I mean the endless delivery of biscuits is just amazing by itself--but between the prices, weak drink, upselling, and plate presentation, we won't be rushing back soon.",yGGGUYCGXm2UKVNYKT1U3g,5,5,3,QPOgoGXYJ87qaInPs2qFxQ

I haven't been to a Red Lobster in literally YEARS!!
We had recently ate at a ""high end"" sea food place in town, with an unbalanced product:value ratio. Red Lobster was a refreshing surprise at a fraction of the price. 

GF had a gift card, so we popped in during Lobster Fest.
Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING was great!!

We were quoted 45 minutes for a table and were seated in 20.
Every point of contact was polite, but casual. The biscuits are everything I was promised, the specialty cocktails are delightful, and specials really covered all tastes.

I got two, perfectly cocked and wonderfully seasoned lobster tails.  
GF had the Surf & Turf which she said was great, but wouldn't let me taste, as she was too excited to eat it herself. (j/k, she reads these)

If I had to lodge a complaint: 
The water in the bathroom sink gets hot too fast.

1977037,2014-01-19,4,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"Being a native New Englander from a fishing family with a birthday coinciding on Monday, I had a tremendous craving for a Maine lobster. Off I went and entered Red Lobster at around 8 PM Saturday. The place was a graveyard. 

I was seated immediately and asked if I was ready to order. I told the server I'd like a moment to peruse the menu but I really wanted a Maine lobster. Laughing, the server pointed to the empty lobster tank. How does a restaurant run out of it's signature product on a weekend? He told me he'd bring me some biscuits and left.

When the server returned,  I ordered the stuffed mushrooms, the lobster bisque and the Bar Harbor Lobster Bake. I was not asked if I wanted to order drinks or dessert. The server promised biscuits again, and left.

The server returned with, alas, without the biscuits, but the stuffed mushroom appetizer. The server cautioned me the dish was extremely hot, He promised to bring me biscuits again, and left. I gave the food some time to cool and let the flavors settle. The appetizer was quite delightful. However, I apparently waited to long.

The remaining courses began to arrive in rapid succession, literally piling up on the table. I was flummoxed as the was restaurant was nearly empty. I was promised biscuits each time the server came, but alas! Those biscuits and I had paths that were apparently never meant to cross.

The other problem that was nearly comical is that by the time I got to each dish in succession, it had cooled to the point of dissatisfaction. The lobster bisque had congealed. The main course should have been called the Bar Harbor Linguine Cover with a dash of Seafood. A smaller portion of pasta would have better allowed one to savor the flavors of the seafood and the accompanying sauces. 

Incidentally, the food presentation reminded me of something you would see in a hospital., The main course was covered in a plastic container and made me feel like I was in an assisted living facility.

At the end, the server came back with a check (about 45 dollars), and asked me if I would like to take some biscuits on takeaway. Anyone who has eaten a cold biscuit probably can guess why I refused this offer. And who knows, perhaps I'd still be sitting there, waiting...

I can see that many people enjoy this place. I heartily recommend spending one's money elsewhere. The salesmanship, service, food preparation, and quality leave much to be desired.

I had ordered a shrimp cocktail instead of fried shrimp with my meal and ask them to bring it out as an appetizer that never happened they came out with my food!! Then when our food did come out but actually I had asked for loaded mashed potatoes with butter sour cream and cheese they just gave me mashed potatoes then my crab legs they weren't even together they threw on a pile of crab legs that were all broken apart and they only end crab leg was connected to the knuckle and then when I asked the waiter for a manager because I felt that this was totally unacceptable 10 minutes had went by and by this time my theater is absolutely getting cold and I was hungry so I felt they better eat something so I started in on my shrimp scampi and that was already called and the little rock lobster tail was Already cold my whole meal was basically ruined!! Finally when the manager didn't get to the table and I complained he said let me go get you a new set of crab legs so he goes ahead and brings me a set a cab legs drop some off to the table and leaves OK so I'm sitting there when I'm I supposed to dip them in!! He did not even bring any butter with them!! My father was actually paying for the meal because it was my birthday and he really did not want me to make a scene however I really wanted to curse them out because the service was horrible our plates were piled up on the end of the table nobody was bussing our table!!

My boyfriend and I waited about 15 minutes for a booth and 4 times(!) during that 15 minutes, a waiter walked right by us and into the bar where he stood watching the basketball game on the TV. And yes, THIS GUY turned out to be our waiter. No doubt he was checking the hoops game while we ate because we hardly ever saw him (I don't think he smiled once the whole time we were there).

I had the Admiral's Feast combination plate, while my boyfriend had the big Lobster/Steak dish... thing... plate... whatever. OK, the food was good. Cool, no problem, but you know what? Like I said at the beginning, there's nothing really super-duper about Red Lobster. What I mean is, Long John Silver's food is good, too (maybe better) -- and a helluva lot more reasonable on your wallet.

$75.00 for two people for dinner!!!.... at Red Lobster?!!! RED FREAKING LOBSTER?!!!!!!! Holy smoke! I never remember it being THAT high. And when I finished the pay process, the waiter just grabbed the final check in the folding book and bailed -- FAST!!! I guess the basketball game went into overtime.

I've said it before... and now again.... the customer doesn't have to go to a bad restaurant. There are plenty of them out there. If a restaurant cares about keeping our patronage, if they care about making some good money with their restaurant, IF THEY HAVE ANY BRAINS AT ALL, they should get their act together. They shouldn't disrespect the customer by dissing good management practices...... THAT'S what makes a restaurant a place worth one's time, or just another hole-in-the-wall.

Thanx, everybody. I'm finished with my tirade. Until..... MY - NEXT - REVIEW !... dun-dun-dunnnnnnn!!!",IduEiOzDSIMlAGnOMPfSvw,1,2,2,jFHr7-QVhJZj8tVAPRGa_A

However, I didn't give it five stars because the servers can be hit or miss. Don't get me wrong, the majority of the time we have excellent service from the wait staff but every now and then you get one that lacks equal attention among tables. 

I actually decided to open a Yelp account and start my own reviews because I felt the prior reviews where rather harsh. Yes, Red Lobster is a chain, but the food has always been delicious and the customer service still beats everything in the area. Trust me, I'm a local and unless you want to travel all the way to McCormick & Schmick's near Maryland and Flamingo, this is your best bet.

We arrived just before the dinner rush, so we were seated immediately.  The service was excellent.  Our water and iced tea were kept full and the warm bread was replenished.

I had the fish and chips.  My husband had the salmon.  My son had the seafood platter.  

My husband felt his portion was too small, the fish was overcooked, and the pilaf was too salty.  He felt we paid too much for what we got.  He was also unimpressed with the beer selection.  He prefers brew pubs.  At Red Lobster he drank iced tea.

My son, who is 11, gobbled up his food and exclaimed over how good it was.  But he's a kid, and he tends to have different tastes.

I felt my fish and chips were perfect and while it was expensive, it was competitive with other restaurants.  It's always pricey to eat out, and if you want seafood you have to pay for it.  If I want to run out to a family restaurant for fish and chips and a glass of iced tea, this place is fine.

But, really it is one of the more affordable options to get seafood that still tastes delicious.  I'll admit- I'm not the biggest fan of our friends in the sea.  But, I can handle a little shrimp and lobster occasionally. 

This location is BUSY every time I visit.  Wait times for a Friday or Saturday night are generally estimated to be 40-45 minutes.  But, really, we have only every waited 20 minutes tops which leads me to believe that they are estimating high so guests don't get angry.

Since this is a chain that most people are familiar with, I will focus on the service aspect of this location.  On our most recent trip, we were blown away by the awesomeness of our server.  He seemed to be balancing many tables at once, including a large party of about 10.  Yet, our drinks were always full and he checked in to see how we were doing multiple nights.  Sometimes this does not even happen at high end restaurants!

I ordered 1. Potato bacon soup, 2. Caesar salad, 3. Coconut habanero shrimp, 4. Brownie a la mode.

Service was prompt and efficient, even a little shake of humor, no hiccups whatsoever.

Food, well, besides the cheddar bay biscuits hitting the spot, yes baked to perfect goodness. Send me out to my B.A.(biscuits anonymous) meeting, 'cause I'm officially an addict.


Soup was nice and perfectly HOT, the way I love it. 

Salad, ehhh, not so perfect. I had my own learning experience to ask for dressing on the side in the future because it was drenched(I prefer my green leafs to be drenched 15% instead of 115%). with that said, I was full by the time they brought over my main entree.

Main, the idea of coconut and habanero (sweet, then kick in my mouth) is culinary-bipolar science and art goodness. Can we do this over with each shrimp? Thanks. I enjoyed some of the shrimps and sack of rice pilaf. Because I was full by the time salad was done, the rest was boxed up with an unrequested bag of those crack biscuits. Way to go the extra block mr. Server. 

Truly, so much food, that I asked my date to ask for box, dessert, and bill within 3 bites of my main. 

Dessert, I like brownie a la mode. But as another learning experience, I should ask what else it comes with, because too much caramel and chocolate drizzle on both brownie and ice cream takes away from the balance of sweetness, making it way too sweet to enjoy. Next time, I'd prefer a plain scoop of ""mode"", thanks.

2284849,2011-01-26,1,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"One Word: Disappointment.

It has been a while since I have been to Red Lobster. This was not my first time to this location, but perhaps over a year since i have dined at Red Lobster. I just remember the amazing cheddar bay biscuits they bring freshly baked to the table. It was the best part of the meal here, always. I could eat the whole basket right when they bring it out and sometimes I do and then get too full to eat an entree.

The reason we chose Red Lobster for our early dinner was because there was an ad in the mail for $29.99 for 2 people to dine - 2 salads, 2 entrees, and choice of appetizer or desssert. As great as it sounded, I knew there would be a catch but we went anyways as I had been craving the biscuits. After waiting about 10 minutes to be seated, when it wasn't even busy... I was so disappointed with the deal. I knew the entees would be limited, but so were the desserts and appetizers, to only 3 choices of each. We also had a coupon with the ad that is $4 off two dinners, and the server said we could've used it with the $29.99 offer.

But I really just wanted the biscuits and lobster nachos. So that's what we ended up doing, lobster nachos and shrimp scampi to share. Pictures will be posted. The first 3 bites of each item was great! But that was about it. Then the nachos were soggy and there wasn't much lobster, and then the scampi was filled with small shrimps, but after about 3 bites I felt sick.

The server was very nice though. But I completely agree with the current rating of this restaurant, about 2.5 stars. Not worth the price for what you get. There's so many better quality or better value restaurants.

I'll just have to learn to make the cheddar biscuits myself! Which, BTW, were not as good this time as I remembered...",JY0rvs_4HBjXKdRB07aEnQ,6,3,2,jelUDRbpsNiId1wx0rFpkA

But I am told on the phone that all they have is a Caesar with chicken, salmon or shrimp. Weird that a seafood restaurant doesn't know what a Shrimp Louie is but ok. I order the Caesar salad topped with fire-grilled shrimp, it will be ready in 15 minutes. So I dilly-dally to pass the time, then drive around the corner to pick it up ""at the bar"". I enter the restaurant behind a couple and naturally wait my turn while the young hostess, barely looking up from what she's doing and without a smile or greeting of any kind, says to them ""your name."" The man asks the hostess why she needs his name if there's no one else in the lobby and she says snootily ""because we have to get your name."" I would've told her to pound sand but he was very nice and complied. Meanwhile, I tell her that I have a pick-up in the bar and she gestures to her right. Not hello, not can I help you, just a dismissive wave of the hand. I enter the bar and the bartender does tell me he'll be with me in a minute. Ok, I'll wait. He returns a few minutes later and I tell him I have a take-out order. I must be the only one because he asks me to clarify what kind of dressing I want on the Caesar salad because I had ordered a side of thousand Island. I explained that I want the Caesar salad dressing on the salad and I want a side of thousand Island. He disappears again and I wait. And wait. And wait. Seriously? They told me 15 minutes and now I have to wait another 15 minutes? He finally returns with my order but I'm perplexed because the salad is in a container, the dressings are all in containers and then there is another small box. When I inquire he tells me it is the shrimp! Huh? Separate? If I had ordered this in the restaurant would it have come separately? So weird. But I'm ready to get the hell out of there so I pay my $16.49 + tip, he packs it up and I exit. I have to pass the same snotty little hostess who is now sweeping the floor and doesn't say goodbye, have a nice evening or thank you as I leave. No surprise there. I get home 10 mins later, the picture shows what my dinner looked like. I felt like throwing it away but it was my dinner! Not only have I had better (and way cheaper!) salads from a fast food drive-through, but every skimpy piece of shrimp still had shell on it that I had to spit out.

Just walking up the sidewalk, was disturbing,  there was a lot of trash everywhere.  I understand that trash gets blown around by the wind here in Vegas, but if the trash is against your main entrance, you might want to clean it up. The bathroom was a disaster,  looked as if it hasn't been cleaned in awhile. Walking to our table to be seated and I notice that the carpet and tile are in desperate need of cleaning,  not to mention random trash on the floor. I sit in my chair and see bits of food from previous users, food stuck in the cracks of the table. We were at a round table that sat 5 people, my section of the table was loose or broken, (not sure which) and was constantly moving.  As for me, I can't say how the food tastes, because I couldn't bring myself to eat it. Knowing that all the small things wrong that I noticed, I couldn't help but wonder what else this place has overlooked.  My sons petite lobster tails was tuff and chewy. One daughter got chicken stripes, little burnt. On a good note, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. The utensils! Some were dirty, a few forks were bent in odd shapes, a couple small plates had food stuck onto it.  I know it is a fight to keep a running restaurant clean and tidy, but a little effort would have gone a long way. 
I have one allergy, Mold, and I was having a reaction sitting in there. So, somewhere in the restaurant there is mold. Could be in the AC, or the carpet maybe. Seeing how the place obviously needed a good cleaning,  there is no telling where the mold is growing.

I'm normally a big fan of Red Lobster but tonight my girlfriend and I decided to treat ourselves to some crab legs and I was disappointed to say the least... They were very over cooked and the meat just fell apart anytime you've tried to open the shells. Besides paying $60 for two orders of crab legs that were no where near the price for the quality, our server, although I can't remember his name, was very attentive and made up for the below par food. I would not recommend this red lobster to anyone in the mood for crab legs and would instead direct them toward a local casino for all-you-can eat for the same price....",InSRZ2xaX2mi9UaDNxmE3A,0,0,2,F0Dnh8JKxVb1Q64XENC8eg

We arrived about 12pm on a Sunday afternoon. Our server, Tiffany was fantastic. Very kind, smile on her face the entire time we were there. 
We ordered an appetizer of mozzarella sticks and chicken strips. Mozzarella sticks were still frozen in the center. We sent them back and she brought out new ones. Next, the baked potato soup was very salty. Then, the entrees came out. I had ordered the maple chicken. The chicken itself was dry but the sauce was very good. Baked potato was crusty and dry. It likely was last night's leftover reheated. Corn was also dried out and hard...also probably left over. 
Roommate's shrimp pasta was inedible. There was skin on her shrimp, and pools of oil smothering the pasta. 
Manager was nice enough to comp the meals since we didn't eat them, but we won't be back.

It's a combination of factors that make this chain less than stellar. On the positive side, the new menu provides small plates featuring lobster roll, seafood tacos and some Chinese dishes. The best values are soup or salad with traditional menu dishes. The steak and grilled shrimp include a vegetable and potatoes. The food is tasty but rarely cooked perfectly. On the downside the music is loud and often inappropriate. Moving tables requires one to drag one's own drinks and silverware to the new location. Finally, they don't take reservations till an hour before you eat. Depending on the time you choose, you might have to wait.

4052880,2013-02-09,7,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"For a ghost town of a shopping center, this Red Lobster is busy.  It's always busy, especially during lunch.  

Once you get past the mini-wait, everything starts to fall in place.  Service at this Red Lobster has always been great.  There have been times I've come here on a limited lunch break and told our server. To my surprise, they did what they can to get me and my group in & out.  

On my most recent visit, I was craving a steak and also lobster. Then I found what I thought was perfect.  It was their Lobster Steak meal.  But if you've been here before, you know what this is. It's steak with lobster bits on top. I expected a lobster and a steak.  My bad, I should have read the menu better.  Also, the price was fair.  

As for their other food choices (from previous review):

-Bottomless Shrimp:  I don't know if this is daily or all the time.  But I have had it in the past.  Their fried shrimp has more batter than shrimp, but still pretty good. 

-Seaside Shrimp Trio:  Is a favorite when in the mood for shrimp.  It's shrimp pasta, fried shrimp, and garlic shrimp

-Tilapia and Cod  I put these all together, but their cod is really good.  Big thick pieces of flaky fish.  Tilapia is prepared pretty good to.  Both are not fishy.  

-Steaks:  Mixed reviews here.  I've had steaks here prepared either too dry or too greasy. The steaks are not as good as a Ruth Chris' but definitely better than a Chili's or Denny's. 

-Lobster:  My opinion, one of my favorites.  Portions small though.

-Stuffed Sole:  Tried once and only recently.  Did not fill me up, but still good.  Order an appetizer!!

-Glazed Chicken:  I know it's a seafood restaurant, but have stopped by for lunch just for their chicken breast.  About 7 total oz and usually have the sauce put on the side.

-Calamari and Fried Vegetables:  An oxymoron, but you'll find it all gone before your soup arrives.  Usually gone from me and yes, the only way I will eat vegetables. 

-Red Lobster Biscuits:  Don't remember the actual name, but this is a must on every visit.  So good and perfect to dip into you chowder. 

Overall, I recommend Red Lobster. I've never had a bad experience and you get what you pay for her. Price for seafood here is just about right for the quality you get.  Just be prepared for a little wait at this location.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,8,8,4,y53wGfVuSQYr-iJqU2A-9A

 I have to say the cook/Mgr? whomever he was specifically came to my table because I had ordered the ""crusted"" shrimp (which was as available) and indicated that they were out of that special (since it was on the special and there was only 3 days left) and they did not reorder it, however, he would make me up something similar by hand.  WOW  It was delicious!! it should be on the menu. So they not only substituted the special but gave me extra.  I was so impressed, then came the bill.  Our waiter, when taking my order, was asked if I could have a cup of soup instead of the salad. ""NO PROBLEM"".  He also asked me to pick a side, since I was having the 3 entree special , I asked what the options were, he said on the last page so I picked the asparagus.   After reviewing the bill I find that he charged me 2 or 3  $$ for the soup and $3 for the asparagus.  When I question him, he said OH YEAH there is an ""UP"" charge for the soup and for the asparagus!!!  Why did you not tell me that when ordering. ""Because when I do tell people there is and UP charge, they get defensive and say well I have money and can pay for it"".    Needless to say his tip was not the greatest.  I might have say OK anyway, but I deserved to have the choice.

1) Server didn't come to our table for about 10 minutes after we sat down (we came at about 1pm so it wasn't that busy)
2) Our appetizer did come until after about 15-20 minutes (it wasn't even hot, but it was warm).
3) Had to ask the server twice to refill our water after he already told us he would be right back.
4) My wife got her entire meal 15 minutes before mine came. She finished her first serving of shrimp before my food arrived and I only got a soup and salad! 
5) My wife's second order of shrimp took about 20 minutes, 3rd order the same - we spent 1 1/2 hours here and most of that was just waiting and waiting for our food and drinks.

What was upsetting is we had to consistently ask the server for more water and where our food was and he would come off as if he was just as shocked as we were, ""Oh my, you didnt get it yet?"" No! We told you 3x already that we don't have water and are still waiting for our food and you keep telling us your going ""right now"" and then never come back! He even offered to get the Manager to come over and we agreed and wanted to talk to him and the server must have forgot that too because the Manager never came. Granted, he did claim he was fairly new but someone should at least be helping or shadowing him or at least check with customers on their service with new servers.

Really, what more can I add to Cheddar Bay Biscuits?  Those things must be made with crack because you will be addicted after the first bite.  Yummy!

Ok, ok, now to the review!  Red Lobster is an A-OK restaurant in my book.  I don't visit it often, but when I do, I always enjoy my meal.  It isn't fancy, but it sure is tasty.  The prices are pretty reasonable for what you get.  They often have great specials, like the 4 course meal for $14.99.  And the best part, unlimited Cheddar Bay BiscuitsI   RL also has some great lunch specials for when you want something smaller and cheaper.  Most of the lunch specials are $7.99, which is pretty good for some seafood.   I always feel like I got a great deal when the bill arrives for lunch or dinner.  

The menu is pretty big and quite diverse as well.  If you like shrimp, you are in luck because there always seems to be at least a dozen different types of shrimp.  They also have lots of other seafood options to suit everyone in your group.  Don't like seafood?  That's ok too, because they have steak, chicken, and beef options as well.  Everyone should be happy in your party.  If anything, everyone can just eat the unlimited Cheddar Bay Biscuits.  Have I mentioned how amazing those suckers are yet? Yum!

The food over all is ok.  The dishes are ok.  Nothing is really special or outstanding, but it gets the job done.  The super highlight of the menu is the chicken tortilla soup.  It is super duper yummy and I think my favorite thing at RL.  It is a chain restaurant, so at least you always know what to expect, no matter which location you are at.

The service here is usually pretty good.  They have a dud or 2 in the service department, but that is everywhere it seems.  I don't require much though, just keep the Cheddar Bay Biscuits coming and my soda filled and I am head over heels happy.  

The interior is ok as well.  I know they want to be fancy, but it is still just an ok interior.  This location was recently remodeled though and is looking a lot fresher.

So, the moral of the story is that Red Lobster is ok.  And guess what??? I will be back for some more Cheddar Bay Biscuits!",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,9,5,3,GTuzi6rm5lO32_q2HaKOjQ

They bring me another plate of pasta and I still hadn't gotten the other refill that I ordered . So after all of this, I ask to talk to the manager . He comes out and asks me all these questions like 'oh so you said you got here after them' ... yes, yes i did . that doesn't change the fact that i waited 40 minutes from the time I ordered to get my food . He just stares blankly at me while I'm trying to tell him about my experience . I've worked in customer service for years, I know he's not actively listening . Not reiterating any of my concerns, not making sure he that he understands my complaints, not asking me any questions to let me know that he's actually listening . So this pisses me off even more but i don't raise my voice or anything . I just wait for him to respond . He says ""I'll discount the meal"" and walks away ..... YOU CLEARLY DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE TERRIBLE SERVICE IN YOUR ESTABLISHMENT OR HAVE THE CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS NECESSARY TO HANDLE THESE TYPES OF ISSUES IN YOUR RESTAURANT . I didn't ask for a discount, I asked to talk to you about my experience and you couldn't even listen to that . It's 950pm ... they close in 10 minutes and at this point I'm over it . I continue to wait for my food just because I've already spent almost 2 hours here so why not . When it finally arrives, I just ask to take it to go and she says No, because they don't allow you to take Endless Shrimp to go . In a normal situation, I could totally understand that . But after wait for an hour to get it AND there's a hair in it and you have to remake it again, that is absolutely ridiculous. I have my 2 year old son with me (who is behaving extremely well ... not crying, making a mess, not doing anything normal 2 year olds do) but It's after 10PM now ... the least you could do is let me take my food to go after this disaster of an experience . This was one of the WORST restaurant experiences I have ever had . If I could give 0 stars, I would . With that being said, I will NEVER return to Red Lobster again .",2azHsB0XbkW9-mU5toWOtQ,0,0,1,s60K1hjFvvTxIre_Avr7pw

4287617,2011-09-22,2,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"ENDLESS SHRIMP!! 

So my son has been asking to go to Red Lobster for a while and I finally decided to take him. I noticed they had endless shrimp for 15.99$ so off we went. 

We arrived and parked and were greeted by a very nice lady, taken back to our seats and on came our server. She took our drink order and came back and asked us what we'd like. I asked if my son and I could share the endless shrimp bc hes young and will end up eating off my plate anyway, and she said sure she didnt see a problem with it. SCORE! 

Our first dish was bite sized coconut shrimp and breaded shrimp... OMFG YUM!! The breading on both was PERFECT! Not overly breaded but not skimpy. The coconut shrimp came with the yummy pineapple sauce, which was totally delectable! The breaded came with the standard ketchup, and that other red stuff (yucky!) and french fries which were DELIGHTFUL!  This first plate was seriously the bees knees! 

Next we got shrimp alfredo and sweet and spicy shrimp. OMFG! Yet another perfect plate!! The alfredo was not overly oily and had a lot of bite sized shrimp! The sweet and spicy shrimp was AMAZING! The perfect blend of sweet and spicy! My son ate the entire skewer of this grilled delicacy! It is served along some rice pilaf which was also freakin delish!

After this yummy explosion we got the Parmesan crusted scampi and another order of the sweet and spicy. Normally scampi is too buttery for me but hot damn this was ON IT! I took one bite and the buttery with just a hint of crunchy from the parm was absolutely PERFECT! I swear I heard cherubs! I never wanted this love affair I was having with the shrimp to end! I felt like I was taking advantage of Red Lobster because I got unlimited yummies! AND THE CHEDDAR BAY BISCUITS! Fresh and warm and just soooo DELICIOUS! I swear they are lucky I could only eat soo much, the table behind us trumped me they ordered like 13 plates! I was like WOW!!

Marquitta was my server and she was a delight!! Never rushed us or anything!! Seriously the nicest server I had in a WHILE!!

I would def recommend this RL, they even let us per 2 Lobsters!! My son was sooooo happy about this! AWESOME! The place itself is clean and very tidy, I had no complaints! Even the bathroom was super clean!! GREAT JOB!

Go here now before endless shrimp is over! Ill probably go for dinner tonight!!",cJh4F1zFNJb2wXCNT1uNWQ,4,3,5,UTvyLLShwunbPbNeiD7b0Q

4374031,2014-05-20,1,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"After a tough hike at Mount Charleston, the girlfriend and I were ready for a meal, so Red Lobster came up, and on we went.

We were greeted promptly by the hostess and sat quickly. Within a minute our server Kim started us off with two sodas and a ""create your own"" appetizer. We selected the calamari and the chicken strips. The calamari with fried broccoli was great, and the chicken strips were pretty standard, not expecting much there. 

Entree wise, we both chose the Lobster/Shrimp/Scallops combo with a side salad, steamed broccoli, and wild rice pilaf. I opted for a soup and the potato bacon soup was rich and delicious. The lobster was decent, a bit overcooked, however the shrimp, rice pilaf, and scallops were awesome. Of course, I don't have to say much about the biscuits, you know everyone loves them. 

The best thing about the meal was Kim. She was very attentive, our drinks were never empty, and she would lighten up the mood with her great personality. I would hire her to be in my restaurant on the strip in a HEARTBEAT. Kim is genuinely about your experience and she sells items the right way. That's what it's about. A true server, a seller, not a boring order taker, a true combination of what every server should be like. 

We opted out of dessert because we were pretty full as is. The food was decent, not horrible for a chain restaurant, the service was excellent, and the decor was pretty relaxing. Great stuff. See you when the unlimited shrimp comes around. ;)",SJskhjbY1VPfL8ej0fYPdA,1,1,4,a660ExHwks4n5efq-gBKdA

Ordered the lobster dip and lobster lover's dream.  Appetizer was 20+ minutes to the table but biscuits and salad kept us pacified for most of that.  The dip comes with tortilla chips and was a bit thin and greasy for my liking.  

Entrees came 10-15 minutes after our appetizer was done.  Lobster Lover's Dream was very good.  Mashed potatoes,  two kinds of lobster, and pasta with shrimp and lobster. ($31.99)  We had a coupon for a free appetizer ($12.99) with two lobsterfest entrees.  Talia, our waitress was very nice and apologetic for any delays.

I ordered the surf and turf on the lobster fest menu and my daughter ordered the ultimate feast.  Both dishes were very delicious.  We were so stuffed, we didn't have time for dessert.

Las Vegas doesn't have too many Red Lobster locations and this was the closet one to the west side. We came on a Saturday night and had a wait of about 30 mins which I suppose wasn't too bad for a weekend. We waited in the super small bar area and grabbed some drinks before dinner. 

For dinner we had was the usual - cheddar biscuits, Caesar side salad, breaded shrimp and shrimp scampi. It was all pretty tasty to me and nothing out of the ordinary from a typical Red Lobs visit. 

My only reason for a 3 star review would be the service. Our waiter was super slow about checking on us and too busy folding napkins in the corner. Also we didn't get any biscuits until our entrees came out since they were ""in the oven.""

My family and I ate dinner here on Tuesday around 7PM and waited less than 10 minutes for our table. That was the best part of my experience! 

Our host sat us but wasn't taking the time to pay attention to us rather he was looking around for clear tables to call in. He tossed the menus on the table and left. Then a server approached us saying our server would be right out. It took our server about 5 minutes to acknowledge us and then said he would be back to take our drink orders. He then disappeared for about 15 minutes and we didn't have any waters or biscuits at our table. At this point the table next to us had already had their drink orders taken and biscuits set down. 

It was becoming upsetting that we saw all the servers doing their duties attending to their tables but our server was MIA!! He finally reappeared to take our drink orders and we already knew what we wanted to eat so we ordered as well. He said he would be back with our waters, salads, soups and biscuits. He comes back about 10 minutes later with out waters and plates and said he would be back with our starters. It took him another 5-10 minutes to bring out our starters and never checked on us again. He proceeded to come back after about 15 minutes saying our main course would be out shortly. It took him another 10 minutes for other servers to bring our meal out!! I was at this point furious! Our waters hadn't been refilled, our server never checked on us and he was overall missing most of the time! And it wasn't just our table he was neglecting it was all his tables! 

Overall, this experience was a disaster! The service is terrible! I wish a manager had approached my table because they need to know there is a major area needing improvement! Step up your game Red Lobster!

To start off with I ordered a calamari appetizer and the largest piece of calamari was smaller in diameter than a nickel.  It appeared that whatever was left in the fryer basket was dumped onto a plate and served to us.  There was very little calamari, it was essentially a serving of deep fried vegetables.  Very unhappy.  The lobster stuffed mushrooms that we ordered were ok.  

Both members of my party ordered the lobster and shrimp trio and both of us were highly dissatisfied.  The lobster tail was extremely rubbery and dried out; there could not have been more than 1-2 oz of meat total.  The shrimp were also extremely small and appeared to be slimy and undercooked.  I ate one of them and refused to try another they were so bad.  The lobster mac and cheese was burnt on the top yet also somehow soupy and watery underneath, it was also inedible.  

As I write this to you around an hour after leaving red lobster both members of my group feel sick to our stomachs.  

This was not an inexpensive meal either.  I would assume that if your restaurant advertised a ""Lobster Fest""  and charged $25 dollars a plate the customer would get food that did not resemble leftovers from a low end chinese buffet.  Every piece of seafood was so incredibly small and disgusting to be completely honest.

I am extremely dissatisfied with my experience and I want a full refund immediately.  I have been a huge fan of red lobster restaurants for many years and have gone to different locations all over the country and have generally had a good time and great food.  This particular experience was un acceptable.

This is a chain, the food servers hired are trained to give the same mantra and very often provide service based on your response to the manta. The secret to a ""positive"" experience is develop a relationship with one or two servers, Ask for them each time you visit, tip them accordingly.

If I could have reached through the phone and given him a back handed slap across the face, I would've since his choices were unlimited. Everyone else's food was ok, but I wasn't happy because of the poor execution of my simple dish.

Utilizing call ahead seating, our party of 8 was seated immediately. I have no complaints about our server, Dom, who flew solo handling our party without any issue. The appetizers, salads, and entrees were brought out in a smooth, timely manner without significant waits.

I thought I'd stick with something that was pretty safe and ordered the grilled rainbow trout ($20.49). Somehow they managed to mess this one up. The fish was served skin side down, and after I sliced a piece from the filet, the fish was not warm and sitting in a pool of liquid. It seemed that my fish filet was frozen and wasn't thawed properly resulting in the liquid to leach out after resting drenching the skin leaving it soggy. Rainbow trout can definitely use some assistance with seasoning. I had to provide the assistance by squeezing lemon and cracking salt and pepper over the filet which one should never have to do. I made the mistake of trusting the cooks and not ordering a sauce or ordering it blackened. And the pre-portioned and reheated sides offered no assistance to the dish either.

My wife did enjoy her shrimp tacos. The cheddar biscuits were refilled multiple times, but other than that, nothing significantly positive was mentioned about the rest of the basically fried or pre-prepped and heated entrees. I had low expectations going in, and they did not meet them.

If anything, the service has always been nice, the food and drinks have been excellent, and there's plenty of food to take home.

To me, a good server is courteous, helpful, stays on top of things, and has a good personality.  I normally have gotten a ""seafood expert"" with a good sense of humor, and is good at answering questions about what dishes consist of.

My last meal, I tried their $15 deal, and for what you get, it's worth the price, and easily the best deal.  A soup, a salad, the main entree with a side, and dessert.  The portions are respectable, and as anyone else notes, the cheddar biscuits are seriously good.  I also tried some beverage that has raspberry, blueberry and blackberry in it, and it well made for that ""comfortable zone"" during my meal.  Their booze has always been consistently tasty.  It's kind of crazy to think that they have as robust a bar as they do.

The last time I went in there it was fairly quiet, and we were seated almost instantly.  By the time we left, however, people were lined up outside and leaving because the place was full.  The parking lot always seems full, so I think it's a matter of picking the best time to go over there.

All in all not bad.  For seafood chain fare, they are quite decent, and I hope that $15 menu remains a mainstay (but I hope they diversify some options over time).  Not bad.  I came out full and content.  Always a plus for me.

5620599,2015-03-09,6,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"Once upon a time last year, I read a Buzzfeed article ranking free restaurant bread: http://www.buzzfeed.com/laraparker/the-definitive-ranking-of-free-restaurant-bread#.qmD34J1xDR

Number 1 on that entertaining list were the Cheddar Bay Biscuits at Red Lobster; hmmmm, really?  I couldn't remember ever having those biscuits much less even remember the last time I ate at a Red Lobster.  So, I resolved to add that to my list of places to try just to see for myself because YOLO and all that.
Fast forward almost a year and I finally got to try the biscuits courtesy of the b/f's gift card; we just never made RL a priority eating destination until then and probably won't be again for a long time. 

First of all, we dined here on a Thursday night.  B/f arrived first and put our names in  at 7:00pm and was quoted a wait time of 20-30 minutes.  I arrived around 7:50pm from an appointment with a bloodmobile, famished.  B/f was still sitting in the waiting area.  We didn't get seated until a little after 8:00pm and probably only because the b/f went back to the hostess to see what the heck was taking so long.  I've heard that the wait times are horrible at RL, but really?   We think they forgot us because we were then seated immediately.

Cheddar Bay Biscuits:  The time had come and....they ARE good.  My first impression of the biscuit was that it was salty, probably from the cheese.  But, then you get the flakiness of the biscuit and its flavor is very tasty.  However, I wouldn't rank them #1 of the restaurant bread that I've had.  Yes, Buzzfeed lists are not scientific, I know.  I'm just sayin'--I love bread and I think I need butter with mine.  Maybe I should have asked for some!  I ate more than one biscuit and they are definitely a plus for RL.

4-Course Feast $17.99:  this seemed like the obvious choice for me because for the price, I got soup (Clam chowder), salad (Caesar), entree choice (Jumbo Coconut and Spicy Pineapple-Grilled Shrimp), and dessert (Triple-Chocolate Brownie a la mode).   The chowder is good with the biscuits, just like the b/f said.   I must note that our server, Andy, did a fine job throughout the evening and brought the b/f a complimentary bowl of chowder because I had to wait for a fresh batch to be made.  Caesar salad is okay, nothing special.  I liked the Coconut shrimp more than the Pineapple-Grilled shrimp since the latter were tiny and not grilled enough.  
I was too full from biscuits to eat the dessert, but Andy had it boxed up, including the vanilla ice cream and some chocolate sauce.

Overall, I don't think the unlimited Cheddar Bay biscuits or the food are worth the notorious long wait times at this place.  Maybe it was just a fluke that night, but the food is not all that for over an hour of waiting.

P.S.   If you ask me, the best unlimited free restaurant bread (with butter!) can be had at our local pizza chain, M#$%o Pizza, but that's just me.",7Oe6ikklTjVBbEFw9emLcA,5,5,3,APyGZskdZksMRRAQrFtNjQ

We ordered the calamari and whoever thought it was a good idea to include fried broccoli and peppers was wrong, too many flavors that mask the very delicate flavor of the calamari, in short ruined it. We ordered fish and chips and a chicken dish. The fish was greasy and breading had no seasoning. The fries were warm..ish.. crispy and could tell they were not fresh. The chicken dish was actually cooked nicely, the wild rice was probably the best thing on the plate. Considering the prices they charge I expected so much more especially in such a foodie city. They were busy so obviously people come here but sorely disappointed is an understatement. I will say the staff was attentive and friendly.",Urq54Q9SWt1w0PiHMGb4Iw,1,1,2,lRMaKPlU_YJwI7Pas5rp9A
5823604,2016-03-28,0,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,Red Lobster's one of my favorite seafood places believe it or not some general franchise company. I went to eat last night with a couple of Associates from work. The food was the portions I don't know what happened over the last few months but the horses have gotten smaller . I ordered the shrimp scampi with a side of lobster tail in the lobster tails look like they came off a quarter pound Lobster laughing out loud. I gave it 3 stars because I'll come back again I just think it was a fluke. I love their cheese breads of course.,4gb54lZDjk1LPPJwG9Ytgw,0,0,3,XXfE_jOxyKdiIWOg6Zo7OQ

I am a shrimp slut, I just can't get enough. This last visit was during the AYCE shrimp promotion. I got my fill of shrimp scampi, traditional fried. sweet chili shrimp, teriyaki shrimp skewer and shrimp linguini. 

As I write this review, I reminisce on that shrimp feast and feel that I need to get satisfied again!  

Service is always good, the RL staff Rocks!",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,3,2,4,manXx9tvAWNWv-xX_iD1lA
5909642,2013-09-19,0,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,It took over 45 minutes for them to to seat us. We ordered the calamari As our appetizer and when it arrived it was substandard and did not taste very good. When our entrées arrived they were cooked however the seasoning was lacking and the food itself tasted like something I could make it home. The staff was relatively attentive however for the price and the wait time was far below my expectations. I was reminded why I had not been to a red lobster in three years and won't be returning anytime soon.,9HZSqrJhVZkjJxKVaOICbg,3,1,2,23adht3xw2GZj1wGXY6P1w
5924406,2018-04-01,0,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"I like this restaurant but not this visit. I ordered my family and I meals online and it told me to pick up the food at a certain time. I got there a few mins before the arrival time but I still had some time to wait. But that wasn't the issue, once I got the food home it was cold like the food had been sitting. I ordered the waffle and lobster special it was such a disappointment my waffle was over cooked burnt and hard and my lobster tails was chewy. I also ordered 2 orders of the the 1.5 lbs of crab legs with sides which was missing the baked potato's. That I didn't realize until I got home and a kids meal lobster with fries. The entire meal was a complete disappointment and I feel like I wasted a 100 bucks. If I had time to take the food back I would because it was trash.",zSyDdamonHjja73giyMajg,0,0,1,bQs8LT8FZYVExZD1IUdFmg
5928904,2012-09-28,0,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"For a while, my husband and I kept seeing the endless shrimp commercials on TV every night. We have never been to a Red Lobster before, so we decided to come here for dinner on a Friday night. What a mistake that was because it was ridiculously crowded! I think we waited about an hour for a table. 

We both ordered the endless shrimp and it was surprisingly good! You get to choose 2 dishes at a time, and it comes with a salad. The choices are Teriyaki, Parmesan, Garlic, Hand Breaded, and the Linguini Alfredo. My mistake was ordering the Alfredo during the first round. It made me full and I didn't order more after that. :( But it was so darn good! The pasta sauce was very tasty. I also ordered the garlic shrimp, which came out hot and full of garlic buttery goodness! The Cheddar Bay Biscuits were also addicting. We had to stop ourselves from eating more than one to make sure we had room for our dinner. I also love their Sunset Passion Colada (virgin because I don't drink alcohol)! We ordered the Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie for dessert, but it was disappointing because the cookie was kind of cold. 

Service started off good. Our server was friendly and attentive in the beginning. Later on, he stopped refilling our drinks and it took him forever to bring us our bill. I think it was a very busy night and the servers were overworked. I thought it was nice that we were able to take our leftovers home. Normally restaurants that offer an all you can eat deal will tell you to eat it or leave it. 

The second time we came here, it was much better. I believe it was a Thursday night and it was pretty empty. We sat in the bar area, but service was kind of the same thing we experienced the first time. Attentive at first, nonexistent towards the end. The food was still great, and I was able to try the Teriyaki and Parmesan shrimp that time. 

This place is not close to my home, but I would definitely come back. Just not on the weekends.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,5,3,4,drbW2WUw_US9e2swJl9ONg

5996381,2017-07-05,0,Qf6EnIzKqhXQg4YNkVAqHQ,"Went here for a family dinner with my in-laws. It's been around ever since I was in high school from what I remember. The place is actually pretty big and has a casual ambience. 

We were seated right away and it didn't take much longer for our waitress to come by and ask what we were having to drink. I actually went with the watermelon lemonade per suggestion of the waitress. It came in a tall glass and it was actually pretty good. 

For dinner I chose the shrimp linguine Alfredo. I also choose to get it in a half order. I didn't know you could get half orders so it worked out perfect for me. The linguine was a bit too salty for me. Also, my mother in law complained of her food also being way too salty. She was not even able to finish half of her meal. I love their biscuits and our waitress even gave us a bag to go.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,1,0,3,tDEibVuInWovzBR1Si-FMg
