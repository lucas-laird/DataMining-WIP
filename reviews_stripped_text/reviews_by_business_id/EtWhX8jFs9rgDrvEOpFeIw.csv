The meat lacked flavor, even the jalapenos I added had no heat. So, no suprise here.",pi6vmI4MCR52OBuxxJ3Kiw,0,0,1,9P_BDB7hedb5MDpZM9MVmA

(but then again I do walk in covered in sweat after running for 2 miles so im busy catching my breath and cooling down) knocked off 1 star from this location because one morning I ran all the way to the front door 47 minutes after they were supposed to open and the doors were locked with no sign of life inside. late shift worker? not too sure. aside from that's it's an alright location.",0H-zIyvxf94D11173f63xg,1,0,4,JXyrbcrKO8mKUWuEUf3nZw

I read the reviews about the owner, and after 10 minutes of an unmoving line, decided not to support an owner who would leave one worker in his shop on a Saturday alone.",o6omJ_bawWyoGOuyyCJVUw,0,0,1,0Rw_mo-ETRfx_Zbgpy26YA

Woman behind counter saw me try to enter but completely ignored me and my attempts to ask what was going on. Normally this is a good store but the lack of professional courtesy on this occasion was rude especially since she was ""breaking"" hours of operation",zbwOrPMVeXQiEoGxPNJYTA,0,0,1,na_u7jaAEwXlMcoovGKRSA

The Sandwich Artist made my sammie to order and it tasted very good.

Another great visit to Subway.  They're pretty consistent and that's why they're one of my favorite places to go when I want a quick, cheap meal.

Will I return?  Sure.",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,8,7,4,_7Cdt7IB5mGgbv8R-GPkYA
3992051,2018-05-19,0,EtWhX8jFs9rgDrvEOpFeIw,Give it up. Close it down. Better subway franchisee just around the corner. Has one employee working at 6:30 pm on a Friday. Who also showed no urgency and took 30 minutes to clear a line of five people. You've forgotten the only thing that keeps Subway relevant with so/so sandwiches: convenience.,Rese0RvjJuhpSCBzdGvYkQ,0,0,1,_uqeFSA_Y2HqAifGOgNnTw
4294583,2014-05-08,0,EtWhX8jFs9rgDrvEOpFeIw,"I walked in earlier this week at 7an in the morning, no one in the place, and they wouldn't toast only 1/2 of my foot long sandwich, although it was only tuna, nothing else on the sandwich. I contacted subway corporate and they had the store manager reach out to me. The store manager gave me a 1 min story about employee theft and I just zoned out after that point cause this guy has no idea the customer comes first, before his internal challenges. Fix the prob internally without affecting customer service. Huh. Not going back to this subway store, especially when 2 other subways I frequent honor my request.",ZSFvE013RL8Nt57YmRgFQA,0,0,1,Umu2nhrx5vIm80kvCa9IXA

When we went to pick up the order, they were closed and are REFUSING to give a refund. Thieves and liars. I lodged a complaint through Subway. Someone from the restaurant contacted me, Brian. When I asked him several times to confirm that his store was closed at 7:45 pm on that day, he refused to answer. He claimed he never received the order (lies -- the store was closed).

There are always brand new employees always working alone with no extra help. And when I return a few weeks later those employees are replaced with brand new ones. The food is prepared well, I don't have a complaint about that. I think maybe the owner is cheap and doesn't have 2 people on every shift in order to save money. I hate coming here and damn myself every time I leave because the length of time it takes to make 3 sandwiches is unbearable. Hire more employees!",EZzV8WIUGWJ7D-e5E7XdjQ,1,0,3,HM2BO7cQg2LUexShPugPAA

There is a very rude man working at this location. Which come to find out he's also the owner. 

Today I received very poor service from him and will not be returning again. I understand that Subway is a chain and patrons just roll in but this business owner obviously doesn't care about his customers by the way I was treated. 

This loyal customer is taking her business else where and guess what there's another Subway location just down the street...2551 S Durango Dr.",tRX5bPyXchxJmlt3GKPSVw,0,0,1,x9fO3wu44rjWoAKLB2JEAA
5199414,2012-08-29,21,EtWhX8jFs9rgDrvEOpFeIw,"I have admitted it before: in a starvation crunch, Subway is on my list of sustenance. How do I judge a Subway? By how many times I have to ask, ""Can I have a little more [insert topping]?"" It is humiliating to beg a sandwich artist for a few more onions, a couple more pickles, a... eventually you just hang your head in shame and accept the measly toppings they are doling out. This happens to me more often than not at this particular location. You get the feeling they are being watched, and if they give you more than the acceptable allocation of jalapenos, something bad may happen to them. It's not a good feeling to have when you're simply trying to concoct a subway sandwich with ample onions",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,12,9,2,n7oI535ZPX0bA2RiMx94hQ
