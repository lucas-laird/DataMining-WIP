124286,2013-12-13,1,1Tak6Q-IlkDrdmLwrEZeSg,"This version of Off the Strip is located on the West side of Tropicana in an old Timbers Bar and Grill space, so you can expect the same smoky environment and mostly untouched building décor you'd find in any of the other Timbers locations around town. The owners of the new space may have redecorated a bit on the inside, but when you pull up there's no doubting its history. And did I mention it's a bit smoky in there? From what I read online and what we experienced on our visit, the service can be a bit spotty. You can sit wherever you like, so I guess it's a bit of Russian Roulette as to what kind of coverage you're about to receive when you select a table. Our waitress disappeared for long periods of time throughout our visit, and never refilled our waters after they emptied about halfway through our stay. The menu features just about everything you could think of from a typical neighborhood bar and grill, plus offering the full beer and drink menus that they all carry. Also, if anyone from the restaurant reads this review, it is never spelled ""potatoe salad""; I counted this error at least two times on your menu.

I was sent in by a friend to try their crazy double burger on the menu, but chickened out at the last minute and ordered their regular bacon and cheddar burger instead. The bun was flaky, gooey, maybe a bit on the store-bought generic side but quite good. The patty was a little small; I was afraid of the double burger at first but not after eating this one. The beef itself was decent; maybe a bit overcooked and possibly a pre-made patty, but had ok flavor overall. The bacon was crispy, smoky and cooked well which can be hard for many restaurants to handle. The cheese was melted and also pretty good. It was  accompanied by a good pickle slice which I definitely appreciate for some reason. Overall this was a perfectly decent burger, and I believe I said just that out loud as I was eating it.

The fries were just ok; some were not cooked enough and they were maybe a tiny bit too oily overall. I don't even know what to say about fries these days, it seems as though very few places are putting any effort into them. For $9 this was a perfectly decent deal, and about what you could expect from your average local spot trying to serve a little better than average food. I will note that my fiancée got the angus sliders, and they were completely overcooked so be mindful if you're going for those instead. I can't say I'd go out of my way to come back here, but if you're in the mood for a local bar with fairly cheap drinks and reasonably priced decent food, you'll do ok here.",0G9BcXSQscv_GnhlNwFfjw,2,0,3,RQPZVJlhZW_m2TQWn3EC_A

That aside, the food was okay.  I had the Caprese salad which was good and the Asparagus was good.  Nothing that wow'ed me.  My friend had some kind of pasta...he didn't like the pasta.  It was okay.

It took 30 minutes for someone to ask if we wanted anything other than water to drink. We were greeted with dirty looks if we asked for anything. Finally we got drinks, when we finished them nobody came over to ask if we wanted refills or anything.

He explained how things worked at this location. Introduced us to our waiter. Kind of sad that no beef wellington at this location :(. 
Decided on the chicken saltimbocca, it was a toss up of this or the rigatoni ala vodka. My friend had the chicken with artichokes. 
We started with the NY steak wrapped around asparagus. That was truly fantastic. They also gave us bread. Then our salads. Then they brought the entrees, as we started to eat, the owner brought me a small order of the rigatoni ala vodka. What a nice thing to do. He know I was having a hard time deciding, (ocd) it was on the house. Both were very good. Big portions. I could not eat half to it. (Lunch for today). They asked if we wanted desert. No too full. Well they gave us a piece of cheesecake to share. That cheesecake was off the hook. Homemade. Perfect. 
I had my radio shopping show certificate, so my total for both of us 30.00. 

Will be going back. A super great experience, good food, good service. The waiter rocked.

1539561,2012-05-02,0,1Tak6Q-IlkDrdmLwrEZeSg,"We tried `Off the Strip' based upon it's high rating for Italian cuisine in the Las Vegas area. Even on a Saturday night, they cheerfully accepted our reservation for 2. I made mention that it was our anniversary. When we arrived there were just two tables available, both right by the kitchen. Not exactly a `romantic' location w/ all the kitchen crew noise and wait staff traffic.

The service was prompt and very personable. We both ordered the Caesars salad w/ our entree. I asked for a small side of marinara with the bread. I usually do this because I enjoy a dip of marinara with my bread, but more so on a first visit, it lets me evaluate a key ingredient for most of their offerings. We all have formed our own particular tastes when it comes to Italian, and mine was formed during my travels to Italy, in particular Southern Italy. For me their marinara was not bad, but a bit too salty w/ a just hint of tomato. Not that fresh tomato flavor I have grown to love, so I avoided their marinara offerings and went for a vodka sauce dish.

The salads are made to order, I know because we were just steps from the salad chef. The Caesar salad was too 'hot' for both of us. It overpowered all other ingredients. We were later told that it was due to the amount of garlic used. I suggested they try cutting back a bit to give all of the complex flavors of a Caesar salad the opportunity to shine.

Dinner was good (not great), but we were both pleased w/ out entrees. After dinner we were surprised w/ a complimentary slice of their famous cheesecake. It is not under rated. It was delicious and the highlight of our Off the Strip dining experience.

A Tip... I don't know what the Off the Strip corkage is, but if I were to return, I would bring my own favorite as their most marginal wines are in the $35 range w/ most anything decent at $60+.",vf6Q3vu9Ho9HmV5GrZq-RQ,0,0,3,vic42pzb11mbFQLU4yTAAg

2138625,2010-11-10,1,1Tak6Q-IlkDrdmLwrEZeSg,"A great local bar to go to if you're in the area. 

The place doubles as a restaurant as well, so the food is a lot better than most foods you get at other bars. The food consists of mostly Italian. The prices are a little more than I would like them to be, but that gets offset by the cheap prices at the bar. $2 domestic drafts !! Plus, the bartenders there are pretty friendly as well. If you go for lunch, the prices are a lot more affordable. 

If you're a big fan of rice pudding, definitely give it a try. Their pizzas are thin crust, and the crust had a lot of taste, which is a plus. The BBQ chicken pizza, was a little heavy on the BBQ sauce for my liking. 

The bar area is very clean, especially compared to a lot of other local bars. They have super comfortable couch/chairs, big screen TVs, pool tables, darts, and shuffleboard. 

I've been here a few times, and I'll definitely be back. Probably wouldn't go there again just to eat - but when I go there to drink, I wouldn't be against ordering food.",LPSNKZWCOweiPHNiJgafng,1,2,4,3QNYt2H4S7qQBcvM_6LITg

That said, one of my best friends is a chef here, and he makes sure that we're taken care of with any special requests we might have when it comes to food. That also goes for the rest of the staff; the service is EXCELLENT and friendly (without bias), and they have a couple of cool little promotions going on.

Beers are like $2 a pop; every time you drink a fat tire, you get entered into a raffle for a fat tire bike. Besides, fat tire is delicious. 

The food is actually excellent as well. I've tried more than a few things here, and I've been surprised every time with how good the quality was for a restaurant that's off the beaten track, hence the name.

We came here on the recommendation of a friend who said it was the best food ever!  Such high expectations but then.... UGH!  Not one person at our table enjoyed their meal.  

Let's start with the food....ordered the grilled artichoke and NY steak wrapped asparagus.  Um.... would you like some artichoke with that serving of SALT?!?!?!  Awful!  Couldn't even eat it and didn't even bother packing it to take home.  And then a few other people order the soup of the day, cream of potato.  That soup was about as thick as mash potatoes.  YIKES!   As far as our entrees.... I ordered the grilled salmon.  The fish was clearly not fresh, definitely frozen.  Two others ordered the lobster ravioli.  Sounds good right?!  WRONG!  Both of them disliked their meal.  The Penne vodka was probably the one hit of the night... the sauce was tasty.  And then another person got the Shrimp Scampi.... he seemed to enjoy the flavor, although the shrimp was not really cooked well.   

Now, atmosphere... if you're expecting a dine in restaurant.  It's more of a bar and grill type of place, with gaming.  Don't bother dressing up, very casual.  Think sports bar.  Not a nice restaurant for dinner.

And then the service.... granted our waitress said it was just her second day, but come on!  We waited forever for our meal, forever for our drinks, forever for our tab.  It was not a good experience at all.

Would I go back?  Nope.  Would I recommend this place to anyone?  For dinner, Nope.  Maybe for drinks after work.  But really, the food was not good.  And in a place like Las Vegas where there is so much competition... you can't serve bad food.",kNV9dPP9EQod-x0SSVaV5Q,5,0,1,Dq9hpTyER3-VV8o2UMI4hw

I loved this place as soon as I walked in.....2 Pool Tables, 2 Dart Boards, and a full sized Shuffleboard game, plus comfy chairs and a wall of big screen TVs.....perfect!

They ordered tons of food for the party....Mozzarella Sticks, Chicken Wings, Chicken Fingers, and several Pizzas.  With over 40 people coming, they needed to load up.

I tried the Mozzarella Sticks & Meat Lover's Pizza.....they were both very good.  The Mozzarella Sticks were cooked just right....the Breading was crispy and not too greasy and the Cheese was melted and gooey.....it had a nice flavor to it and went well with the Marinara Sauce.

The Meat Lover's Pizza was awesome too.....from what I could tell, it had Canadian Bacon, Bacon, Sausage, Pepperoni loaded on top of the Pie.  It was very flavorful, but with all of that Meat, the crust was a bit soft, very difficult to eat the first few bites of the slice without a fork.....which is not good for Pizza traditionalists.  Other than that, it was spectacular Pizza....full of flavor and I thought the Cheese to Meat ratio was good.

To wash all of that down, I had a Hoptoberfest Beer made by Fat Tire.....very tasty, not as Hoppy as other Beers I've had recently, but very good.  It went well with the food.

Overall, I had a blast here and so did the rest of the party.  People were playing pool and darts....it was too packed to play shuffleboard as the party goers were too close to the table to play a game.

It's really quite spacious insode and there are darts and pool and stuff; however, there is a cozy dining room to the right so you can avaoid all the bar stuff if you so choose.

You get a chicken breast, stuffed with shrimp scampi, on a bed of spaghetti in a flavorful marsala sauce.  it comes with a salad as well.  I dig it.  It's $20! A bit much  - but plenty to share! Definitely enough for 2.  The bread leves muchto be desired.  

I tried another pasta here preciously (it hink it was called Big Al's Pasta of something).  It too was delicious and flavorful.  It was spicy!  we also sampled the asparagus spears wrapped in steak and drizzled with balsamic.  A lovely appetizer, I must say.

4435008,2011-01-30,1,1Tak6Q-IlkDrdmLwrEZeSg,"Finally...Kuge will REVIEW...Off The Strip

Kuge does unfortunately hang out and is friends with fellow yelper Jonathan S. (har har) and is also friends with the same friend that works there.  

But The Great One loves to review about the complete experience and not just the food that he ordered. Right from the get-go Kuge and his friends were greeted instantly upon entering the establishment.  Along with that Kuge felt completely welcomed as he noticed Off The Strips open layout inside the building.  It certainly had a homey feel to it (similar to Naked Fish).  The staff was fast and courteous throughout the night.

The menu was pretty unique but The People's Champ will admit he is gun-shy on trying new items he played it safe and ordered a pulled pork sandwich. 

The food came pretty quickly and Kuge was pleasantly surprised that the portion size was absolutely HUGE.  Aside from the service size, Kuge believes that the food he ordered was pretty damn good and rock solid.  It was as if he ordered 5-7 pulled porkies from Slider Truck except it cost nearly half the price.

The sheer value of taste, service size, and price make Off The Strip a restaurant that you jabronis keep an eye on if you are in the area.  The Great One had a wonderful experience with it's homey feel and great service.  

Kuge will gives Off The Strip 5 Rock Bottoms out of 5.",UER4m0CBVgcFlVbMqhCvCg,2,1,5,vixsMJwbWOzgXEuljXMg0w
4491153,2014-01-15,3,1Tak6Q-IlkDrdmLwrEZeSg,"We came here looking for quality food with a relaxing atmosphere. I wanted a variety so I ordered 2 appetizers instead of one entree.

My first choice was the New York Asparagus. This is thinly cut black angus beef wrapped around asparagus with provolone and  topped with marsala mushroom sauce. It was very good but the sauce reminded me of Salisbury steak sauce which kind of threw me off. It is pretty small so don't order it if you are really hungry.  

I also ordered the pesto garlic bread. It was made with french bread and had tomato,  garlic, pesto on it. There was a generous amount of mozzarella on top! It was really tasty!

We had the chocolate cake for dessert which made me glad that I ate a light meal! I know that garlic bread isn't considered ""light"" but I shared so in my book its considered a tapa.",48vRThjhuhiSQINQ2KV8Sw,4,3,4,xETeG2L5_X7-Xep_6_UNMQ

While the Southern Highlands location is just a restaurant, this is a bar and restaurant. Knowing that, I wasn't sure if I would be getting the same type of dining experience. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food served here.

I came here for lunch. There were two older ladies just leaving the dining area as I was about to sit. Thus, once they left, I had the whole dining area to myself. The place was dead. My waiter was quick and the service was friendly, but I'm not sure if that's standard or because I was the only one there. Who knows.

I ordered the special, which was a grilled pork chop with apple stuffing and green apple gravy. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and honey glazed carrots. Everything was delicious. For $10.95 plus tax, the special was the way to go. Some of the other options on the menu seemed a bit pricier than I would've liked, but I'm glad the special was truly special in both taste and price.",s8v5KKrZShVK29M4XP8Q3A,2,2,4,5SVO49vJ3JN3kt68VvjS6g

This is a one star review. I should give it a two because our server Laura B. was nice and attentive. Service can not help all your problems though. 
This use to be a Timbers. You can tell because everything if here from when it was a Timbers. 
Yelp says Off the Strip is a four star. Not at all. I ordered a burger well done. It tasted like ash, burnt and nasty. My friends burger was a Salt burger. 
Our visit was not great. I wanted to love this place. The four stars had my hopes high, but the food was a major let down. I can't see a reason to return.",k35XOPT9cZeUSUC9OnlLdg,2,2,1,qkKo2XVGWgVXN0ZtokVKGQ

Those were my gut feelings a few days ago when I ate there.  Having time to think about it, while the server was incredibly friendly, we had to grab our own menus and had to look for her when we were done eating to pay.

The food was middle of the road.  I was a bid disappointed based on the reviews, as I was expecting much better quality.  My wife had the chef's favorite pasta (forgot the specific verbage used on the menu) and said it was decent, but rather spicy.  I layed up and had a pizza.  I was impressed by the handmade crust, but with such a great foundation they really could have done more with it.   I wouldn't steer anyone away from this place, but it wouldn't be the top of the list for me when looking to eat.",dM2Pvd9v-hewm3oZpLczNw,0,0,2,si0m6p-GVyaw7HtiKZQceA

I had the chicken and artichokes and it was delicious! They also have a great house sangria. I was going to order their raspberry beer, but our server was honest with me and told me it was really bitter and suggested the sangria instead. I'm glad she did.

The prices were good and the portions were large enough to have left overs the next day. The first time you go in mention it's your first time there and you'll get a slice of their cheesecake for free! They were out the night we went, but they offered us German chocolate cake instead and assured us we could have the cheesecake next time we're there.

We used GPS navigation to get there, thanks to my Droid and Google maps... 

We had dishes of spaghetti, fish, and steak. All were large portioned, and the staff was very friendly. The nights specials were sold out already, and there were a couple of menu items that had been dropped,

We had heard the vodka sauce was great, so we ordered an extra plate with a home made meatball-excellent! My dish was a french style prok chop, that literally may have been the best I have had. 
What made this even more special was both owners stopped by and said hello as we hung around, and after conversing a while, found out that we took a taxi to the restaurant to meet a friend. One of the owners had to go to the airport to pick up some one at 9:30, and offered to drop us at our hotel on the way-unbelievable.
We will go back when in Las Vegas, and I would highly recommend it. If you want great italian food with huge portions for about $15-$20, this place can not be beat!",3kX4duu-YHx5o0gLpVze8A,1,1,5,ai1ow97hAXCJKf2Up2oA1A

It was a little awkward at first since we didnt know it was a bar, but right around a quick corner is restaurant style seating where you can sit yourself and a waiter will arrive shortly. We ordered a few appetizers: Onion rings and New York Steak Asparagus. Both were great, although the Asparagus is litterally just two pieces of asparagus for about $10 bucks...it was good though so I cant complain too much. I ordered the shrimp scampi and it was simply amazing! So much flavor and tons of food for the price. My mom ordered a pizza for herself thinking it was going to be a personal pan sized portion but it was waaaaay bigger. I think it was probably bigger than a Large order from Pizza Hut, and it was much better than Pizza Hut of course. My dad ordered the meatloaf which he loved and the boyfriend ordered a Philly Cheesesteak that looked pretty good also. The Cesar salad that comes with most of the entrees was amazing BUT incredibly garlicy (which I LOVE) but I'm sure not everyone would feel the same. The atmosphere is really chill and laid back, the bar was filled but not super crazy. I truly am surprised this place wasnt more packed with hungry locals. We did visit on a Sunday evening though, so that could be part of it. Get away from the strip for a bit and check this place out for sure!",BfMQ_GNqADz6y6v055C-rg,0,0,5,GZGjCkcSikwg-3tL8ov5yw

5574344,2011-04-14,1,1Tak6Q-IlkDrdmLwrEZeSg,"I did not enjoy my experience here at all. and by experience I mean the food. 

Tried the Reuben (special) and calamari. The fries were not crispy, nor was the calamari. The reuben was too salty and they put so much butter when they browned the bread that the bread was soggy from it. 

Then I had the rice pudding, which I didn't know comes cold, I always thought it was suppose to be hot but whatever if its good I can eat it cold. But nope, this dish was just a complete fail in my book. It came out in a bowl with cinnamon sprinkled on top and two maraschino cherries. (Unfortunately that made it look less than appealing) The taste/texture was not what rice pudding should taste like. It was like eating whipped cream with a few bits of undercooked rice strewn throughout.  

I think the server knew that we did not enjoy it but he didn't say anything. So I would say the service was average. It's nothing I would rave about and nothing I would be angry about.",CMu9FmdK8xpiawJowJuGQg,2,1,1,Xj2G-m_X2cXIsX-bG5xQOg
