And the prices are great. I recommend the Lomo Saltado, one of my personal favorites when it comes to Peruvian food. Also, s/o to Tim and Norma (owners), they are very friendly and cook delicious food!! Highly recommend",p-DqT4jS9eK34y4bS-hzdg,1,0,5,C-3Uev8IgoWVUFCdzW9Pjw

2763009,2017-05-02,0,q4MJE4yTtnkmxRwJTSTAZw,"This food truck serves Peruvian and Mexican dishes with the average price around 8 dollars per Entrée. I had Lomo Saltado which is a popular Peruvian dish. It consisted of marinated steak served and sautéed tomatoes and red onion , served with a side of jasmine rice and french fries( the fries still had the skins on them ) .This is  a very tasty dish , portion size was good and was still piping hot when it was served. While I'm not a connoisseur of Peruvian food I enjoyed every bit of it , the only demerit that I could take away from this dish would be the amount of sodium used .Between the marinated steak and the soy sauce use to garnish the dish I found it rather salty. Presentation was awesome and the cost was good I believe it was seven dollars if I remember correctly. If you have the opportunity I would definitely try this food truck!",Y1yb6mOUPdjNt4y_2uz9mQ,0,0,4,JJOmaUArr-HfV_lhE5eIcA

4106846,2017-08-18,2,q4MJE4yTtnkmxRwJTSTAZw,"Affordable yet filling and tasty food isn't usually a combination that you'd expect from a food truck, but I managed to find one today at this food truck.

I was feeling quite famished after work and some time to kill before meeting a friend for dinner, and I recalled that there's a weekly food truck gathering at the Total Wine & More just south of Town Square. I'd been ignoring it during the hot summer weather, but it was a convenient stop en route to my eventual destination.

I arrived to find a slightly sparse lineup (on account of a gathering downtown) that included Inca Vs Azteca. I made a quick lap to survey the menus, and I chose to try the cheap options on the Azteca (Mexican) menu here.

Taco Azteca ($2 including tax): yes, $2 off a damn food truck for tacos. The menu says 6"", but it's a 4-inch tortilla with a steak, ham, and bacon mix, caramelized onions, and a ""spicy"" (maybe mild) avocado sauce. Definitely the more flavor-packed of my two tastes tonight, with the beefy flavor singing (and pinkness in the steak was a great visual).

Tostada ($3 including tax): can't really go as far with chicken, but made a commendable effort with the copious amounts of veggies, queso fresco, and sauce (mild per my choice). There was definitely some liquid that was compromising the crunch by the time I got to this bite, but at least the tortilla stayed intact.

Hopefully, I'll be able to get into the rest of Inca Vs Azteca's menu soon, especially the Peruvian side. The pricing and quality of the food wouldn't be out of place for a casual brick-and-mortar, so to see it on a food truck was a welcome change of pace.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,5,4,VzcH5rLV8e5RTTDefdwxAw
4181672,2017-08-27,0,q4MJE4yTtnkmxRwJTSTAZw,"What a cool meal. I tried the food out at the Food Truck Party on Las Vegas Blvd. There was a helpful gentleman that guided me through the menu. It was half Mexican dishes and half Peruvian dishes. I took a walk on the wild side and had the Aji de Galina from the Peruvian side. Not only was the dish beautiful, it was delicious and filling. I also got the Inca Cola. It was a cream soda with a twist. The food was worth every cent, the Cola... not so much (for me, you may love it).

They also have a burger option, but it is only 4oz. So it is more of a slider that a burger. 

Find this truck and enjoy a great meal!",P2ZK_uDduvKbKgmNuyZQ4w,0,0,4,aRw9YR9njEOwPcLbnNpqBQ

The taste was there but the cut of meat was just awful tough thin flavorless, potatoes are soaked in oil which I get the point but these are absolutely ridiculous way too much sodium, the tomatoes and onions were a nice addition the rice wa great but the meat come on man care about your customers ! Toughest cut of meat ever and for twelve dollars ?? They should be selling this for 5 dollars MAX belongs in an empty strip mall thats just about to shutter, such a shame to call it this",nWpp7zJWADqpWzCHEDzFag,0,0,2,ETd-hCHCtwc4_uKwDKB_6Q
