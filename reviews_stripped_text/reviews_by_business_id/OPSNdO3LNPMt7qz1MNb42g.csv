Ordered butter chicken and asked twice if it came with rice. Both times they said yes.

The lamb chops were outstanding and so were the chicken basil bites. Paneer tikka was moist n succulent as well (never thought I would say that). They need much improvement on the veg items. Salli boti was much like vindaloo but quite good. Co-owner was very very hands-on and obliged to our every request. All in all it was a great experience. Location is superb on Paradise Rd (parallel to the strip) and also has a very large lounge with full bar.

Facts:  it took more than one hour after ordered to get our takeout while it was not busy at all. 

We were told it will take only 10-15 minutes. After 50 minutes they told it will take additional 15-20 minutes due to cooks mistake.

Meanwhile, The chef was being called at each table by unsatisfied customers as we watched.

Food was no way authentic, atleast a chef from Jalandhar should have been careful preparing palak paneer. Dal was partially cooked and didn't reach the level you need to bite easily. 

The only good part was person who took order in the reservation  desk  genuinely apologized. I will recommend Other restaurants on strip but not this one at all.",T7ROJKcwrB4NTiZ1gK7qbw,2,0,1,AEPRptH6vq2taQSik22cug
42500,2017-05-25,0,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"I was a regular customer of Urban Turban .. but not anymore !  Last week I had a very bad experience at Urban Turban.  I had a friend visiting Las Vegas from California and I took his and my family to Urban Turban. We are all vegetarian and there was only one option for Veg Subzi (Curr) ""Paneer Tikka Masala""  ! Usually we have seen at least 2 options here as well as other places. The ""Dal"" they had was very salty and all of us could not even eat it. On top of all these when we ordered Garlic Nan, we were served cold Nan which was difficult to cut and chew. After we had our lunch when I went for making the payment, I mentioned my feedback to the manager/owner ... He accepted that buffet was missing one item (curry) and told us that he would take care of this.. He looked at the bill and then he said he could not do anything in the bill and provided us with $20 coupon ($20 written with pen on business card) to be used next time (we need to see him when we go and remind him about what happened to redeem the same). Also, there was some additional item called ""Party Gratuity"" of $8.00 which took me by surprise as I never had to pay the same before !  I think if he really wanted to retain the customer he should have compensated us in the payment same day rather than giving us a coupon and making it necessary to come again to redeem it !! Anyways, I don't think I would visit again this restaurant .. never with any guest for sure......",fAhAun-wSobkeogosjbOPQ,0,0,1,wHnGANn0YETYSjzEwQLmNA

62418,2015-02-21,0,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"I love Las Vegas and places like Urban Turban are the reason why. 
This place is located in the once famed Restaurant Row in the same strip mall location as Ruth's Chris Steakhouse Paradise Road used to be.  Now, I hate strip malls and honestly I have not had the best luck with Indian restaurants in this town but I am always willing to let somebody change my mind...Consider it changed!
 
The unpretentious exterior is no muss, no fuss. The owners understand my need to do a selfie and graciously accommodated me with a Turbie ( small taxi, scooter car looking thing) at the front entrance so I can jam all my friends in and get a picture.
 
The bar area is low key and intimate.  Two large TVs that they use to broadcast sports are above the bar.  These guys know their market and have outlets under the bar so you can charge your phone, tablet or laptop while enjoying their free wifi!  No more asking the bartender to plug your phone in beside where he is trying to make drinks ( you know you have done that!). Perfect for catching up on Facebook or doing your business emails while having lunch.
 
The owner, Bhushan is from Mumbai by way of Auckland, New Zealand.  He is usually there and he is really friendly.  Ask for him by name ( Bush-On or just say Bushy).  I found out that he and his wife, Jasmin have a successful Urban Turban restaurant in Auckland.  They are not new kids to the block and it shows because these dishes are authentic, made from scratch creations that have been tested and proven to be AMAZING.
 
The chef, yes Chef is the real deal (actually Indian) and if you have any special requests or questions he will come to your table and assist you.  For my Vegan friends, he came out prattled off several dishes that he would be happy to make Vegan for me!  Vegetarian? No problem.  Maybe you are just picky ( you know who you are).  Chef Vijay will offer substitutions and variations to accommodate whatever you need and no, you do not need to explain what gluten free means to him.  I think the thing I loved most was that he took my special requests as an enjoyable adventure and not a burden.
 
Manish and Ed are great servers that are just the right amount of friendly and knowledge that you need when eating international food with native ingredients.
The evening bartender, Ronaldo is a happy guy and is often singing along to the music as he polishes stemware.  Don't be afraid to make special requests; I invented my own drink and Ronaldo was more than happy to accommodate! 
 
I realize you are probably wondering about the most important part - the FOOD! 
I recommend the Tika Masala which is a spicy red curry.  Please note that you can order one portion or bottomless!  BOTTEMLESS!  It is served with a home made Naan ( Flat bread / Tortilla thing) that is so light and flakey.  It also comes with my favorite, basmati rice.  It is so fluffly I have to control myself from ordering more ( the sides are not bottomless).
The Palek Paneer ( green spinach curry)  is made with their own home made cheese.  It blew me away and I do not even like cheese that much.
The vegetable pizza on the Happy Hour menu is perfect for sharing and at $6.95 is large enough to have as your dinner.
 
They have a fabulous happy hour ( 3pm-6pm & 10:30pm to close) that I strongly recommend.  They also have Industry nights but I forget which day it is. I know it is posted on their website.
 
Tell them Skeedaddle sent you, spend $20 and they will give you a free glass of my favorite New Zealand wine ( Ask Bhushan).  Seriously, I do not get commission, I just love them so much. I was going on and on about this place and a friend of mine finally went.  She reported back that the service was amazing ( Thank you, Ed) and the food was so good she returned that same week!  Yeah!  Finally an Indian restaurant that is warm yet hip, friendly yet professional with quality food that will not break the bank.",9imSnJsjKTSTMlyMZ3EYYg,3,2,5,Qnmxu3jN0-1CznCE2tiaWA

We tried the chicken biryani, which had a really rad presentation and great aromatic bite.  We also shared the chicken tikka masala.  The food overall was great.  We tried a paan shot, too.  It was like a baby melted milkshake with a really nice flavor that I can't even describe.

140935,2017-12-30,0,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"Stay away from this shithole. There is a hostess here that is probably the most dishonest and shameless person you will meet in your life. The way she treated us is astounding. First when we called she said 'Are you using Groupon '. The moment we said yes, she said you need to come to restaurant and order. They apparently don't take phone order for Groupon even though the Groupon for specific for takeout. Once I reached there and ordered 4 items, she said it will take a few minutes. After waiting for 30 minutes she said it is taking longer as they a big crowd that night. Next I decided to get something for my young daughter from McDonalds as she was getting hungry. I came back in 20 minutes and inquired about my order, I got the same answer from the hostess. After another 10 minutes which was an hour after coming in to the restaurant she indicated that the order has not yet started. Her claim was they are still cooking the previous order. At that point we have enough and demanded a refund which initially she was not ready to give and only after we pressured her to either give our food immediately or refund us she agreed for a refund. At that point we had spent 1 hour and 15 minutes at the restaurant without even getting a glass of water or most common decency any business will provide to you. Why are such joints open & there is accountability for treating paying customers this way? If you don't have the capacity to serve close your business and do something else like lying. You will do good in that.

154101,2016-05-25,2,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"We have been here a total of 3 times. The first time was a great experience and the food was maybe a 4 out of 5 stars and service was great as the man told us about everything on the menu. On Tuesday, we went and we were told they were only serving buffet and we had to eat in a separate dining room because a tour bus had priority over us. I was like ok no worries your food is really good we will come back some other time. Today I called ahead and asked if they were serving buffet or a la carte and if a tour bus was coming, I was told it was a la carte and I should be fine no worries. I drove for half an hour to get there and was told by the manager that we had to leave in less than an hour because a tour bus was coming, I explained the situation and he was like ok...he got on the phone to speak to someone. By this point I was so irate that I was turned away twice in 1 week that I will never be going there again. This restaurant does not cater to locals or non-Indian people on tour buses. Please go to Mint, Ghandi or Saffron (Saffron Flavors of India being the best Indian restaurant in Vegas) for better food and service to locals and those who are not Indian tourists. You food was good, but not great and considering that Mint and Ghandi are right next door and have just as good food I would recommend them over you. It's a shame because I highly recommended you to my coworkers that now I have to tell them otherwise. 

This is the response I got from the manager insulting me and calling me a racist and see my response below ---

Bhushan A: Hi 
My name is Bhushan and I am the owner of Urban Turban
Reading your review I don;t understand what your issue is - you make allegations against us being benefiting Indian only - is uncalled for and racists. This is how I read your review a rant out of frustration, not a review on its food quality or service. YOu clearly like Saffron, Mint and Gandhi satisfy your needs, then why visit Urban Turban. We have failed to meet your expectation, in which area your review is unclear. It seems like there is motive to defame us - At Urban Turban we are getting to be the most popular Indian cuisine restaurant in Las Vegas, hence we get super busy - each day we are getting full - by locals and tourists - by All - no specific race dominates us - we welcome all races and people from all over the world. 

I am not sure how I can help you, apart from saying your choice  should be Gandhi or Mint or Saffron

Lastly, this review is unfair and a rant  - no comment on our food or service.

This is my response and now I am really infuriated--- A. I am the last person to be racist as I am Hispanic and a minority as well and I applauded Mint and Saffron for their service and food and they are owned by Indians so how is that racist. B. You do turn away locals and single parties to accommodate Indian Tour buses and turn away locals (that clearly shows your service) as they are more of a priority and your response clearly shows no customer service as the customer is always right and you should not insult anyone C. I said your food was good not great, please re-read my review and I even complemented the server we had the first time but your food was not the best and I am entitled to my opinion the first and only time we were served a party of two with no alcohol racked up a $120 in order to try everything and it was mediocre to good not great from the garlic naan to the rose petal ice cream to the chili paneer that was made for us upon our request. D. Your response just does not show any remorse by your actions or concerns of losing a repeat customer it just shows that you will do anything to keep a ""reputation"" that is nonexistent and shows no customer service. That shopping center has way too many other good options to eat at like Mareekech, Sushi Way and Satay which are far cheaper and your prices are expensive for tapas style Indian food. So before you call ANYONE a racist you should know your facts, having an opinion and telling the truth about Indian tour buses, which is a fact, is not being a racist so don't play the race card with other minorities that may fly against a white person but not another minority. You just ensured the fact that I will not be returning or recommending your establishment. Maybe if you stop turning away repeat customers you won't get reviews like this. Finally, yes I have Mint, Saffron (the best by far in Vegas) and Ghandi, I am entitled to give my review which I think is fair and your response just shows how your service was by getting defensive and calling someone a racist. FYI the second time I was there was at 7:15 and only two tables were occupied and I was told I would have to leave by 8:00 because of a tour bus, what the heck not even a hi or hello...that is why we left...and I called ahead! Also, Hash K. gave a similar review a couple of hours ago, just so you know it's not always about the food...service plays a pivotal role as well.",vrYY6ByqCS-2We-raSqjXQ,6,0,1,GcAOAnfH4rccd1JiHXeGFA

I trusted the chef and oh God that was the biggest mistake. Buffett had three items, soup, pav bhaji and some snack with super bad taste  never heard of it before. 
We asked him to change the stuff to which he said he can't and offered us instead take 2 extra entrees to cover up his lies. I was with my parents and don't want to create any scene so I said yes to that, and needless to say those entrees were even worst.

We got off from our chairs to leave the place without eating it, and this shameless chef brought check for that buffett which we didn't eat at all. I mean one can't go beyond this level

The Raita wonderfully complemented the curry and naan. Loved the meal so much that we ordered further side of naans. The wait staff was quite attentive and helpful. Came over to make sure we were enjoying our meal a couple of times. We finished off with chocolate samosas (awesome!) and the paan shots. The paan shots are a must try! We ended the dinner with their Masala Tea which was seriously authentic! The art and decor of the place was clever and really nice. Took a few photos with the Auto Rickshaw called Turbie before we left.

Urban Turban has been my third restaurant and the Bhel Puri here is so much better than the other two that I decided I must let the world know about it. I am Indian and a foodie, as well as a gourmet cook and I can say that the Bhel at UT is just great. Firstly the portion is huge for the price - a complete meal by itself and simply delicious and authentic. It needed to be a little spicier, so I requested them to chop some green chillies for me to garnish the Bhel with. The service was as cheerful as the ambiance with the autorikshaw. Before the Bhel came an ample serving of papad with VEGAN mint chutney which was a pleasant surprise to a dairy allergic person like me. The African American waiter gave me a high five saying he was dairy allergic too and was pleased that he could cater to my needs.

The only problem I would say is that the food is a bit pricey for the quality. I ordered the Butter Chicken bottomless curry bowl (which was around 17$) and felt that it was watered down. I feel if you don't plan on eating enormous amounts of curry, it would be better to spend the 17$ at Mint or India Masala to get higher quality curry. But if you can down 3 or 4 bowls of curry, then it would be definitely worth it to get the bottomless curry here.",LP3oRiipp4GGMPERVNJUKw,2,0,3,l8D43UlgSlIpVyC3w8TnJg

The only reason it wasn't 5 stars is that they need to develop a lunch menu with lunch pricing. 30 bucks all in for entree, appetizer and drink is good value for dinner, less so for lunch.

When it did come out, it didn't all come out at once. By the time everyone had their food (we waited for them to get it and didn't want to be rude and start before they had theirs), ours was cold. It's pretty funny that the curries are ""bottomless"", since that would have meant waiting another 45 minutes for a refill. Also, our bill came to $400, and for a ""casual"" restaurant, that seems pretty steep to me. It's too bad, since the mixed drink I had was delicious (albeit very small) and the flavor of the food was decent (although the portions were small). I felt pretty crappy about making all of my friends pay so much for such a mediocre meal.

Oh wait...The food!
My attention was captured by the delicious naan. Garlic naan all the way!
The meat platter was brilliant and so was the butter chicken. 
What really caught me was the biryani. We sadly got the veggie one but the approach to cooking it is truly an art at urban turban, and the flavor beyond anything you ever imagined biryani tasting.
The owner recommended the lamb one, so next time, I'll be having that.
Now desserts...
My entire family cringed when we looked through the menu at first and and saw chocolate samosas. But after seeing and tasting the best biryani ever, it all made sense.
Do yourself a favor and get a pan shot (brilliant!!!) and a plate of the chocolate samosa. These guys are artists, and there is no better way to put it. They have pulled off the impossible, and blew my mind.

861395,2016-12-02,0,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"Name of this restaurant should be Urban Garbage!!! This should tell you all about their crap food and crappier service and attitudes! In last 6 years, of 100 times that we might have dined  at restaurants, this was 1st time that we did NOT leave any TIP for the servers at this restaurant--that much Crappy Service and Attitude they showed to us. Here's what happened...
We were 4 adults and of almost empty restaurant with nicer tables we were given seats with 2 joint wobbly. On all the other tables exact amount of glasses were placed and on our table, only 3 glasses were there. My sis-in-law's hubby had to ask for the glass of water! Then our server took the order and brought out 4 appetizer plates (small). My hubby had ordered Samosa chaat which was good. Then came 2 Paav bhajis with chopped White onions. 1st of all Bhaajis color was almost brownish black not orange or red!  Bread wasn't properly done and White onions the way they had roughly chopped, we do better job at properly chopping. They did NOT even give lemon/lime with it. When asked for lemon/lime and chopped onions (that my hubby wanted), they gave red sliced onions (looked stale) and lemon/lime. When I and my sis-in-law tried the Paav Bhaji, it tasted good though- NOT Great or excellent! My hubby had ordered Paneer Tikka Masala. His PTM came 1st and then Garlic Naan (1 Big instead of 4 cut pieces) and as soon as my in-laws saw that, they told server it was burnt for most part. Server started teaching my sis-in-law that in Tandoor oven, it will burn only and she told the server that chef can take it out little earlier that way it is not burnt!!! he took it back and I saw how chef inside the kitchen was laughing and said don't bring back! 
There was another server whom I called and with attitude he came and I requested him to bring extra Bhaaji and he said tell to your server and walked away!!! Not even courtesy to call our server so that I can convey the message to her! Then When I and my sis-in-law tasted my hubby's Paneer Tikka Masala, it was tasting quite sour!!! Literally it felt they had squeezed lemon/lime in it!! Then the properly done Garlic Naan came. Nobody liked Paneer Tikka Masala as much. My sis-in-law's hubby had ordered Parda Biryani. It comes with Roti/Naan as Parda meaning a Veil. The Biryani container is closed with Roti. She didn't bring roti with Biryani and when asked she replied that as we do not like burnt Naans/roti, they did not give us at all..! Plus the Biryani was tasting Sour as well--as if they squeezed too much lemon/lime in it..! So with all their attitudes, crappy food and service, so pissed, we decided not to give them tip. In addition, it felt like they charged us for 2 Naans although they had initially charged for 2 naans and we asked them to cancel it. 1 Paneer Tikka Masala - $12.00 (Bad), 1 Samosa chaat - $8.00 (Good), 1 Parda Biryani Veggie - $12.00 (Bad), 1 Big Garlic Naan - $6.00 (okay), 2 Paav Bhaji- $ 19.00 (okay). Total with Tax $ 61.65-not worth it..
I would give it a Negative star if I could. Wobbly table! I had to place everyone's glass of water on the empty table by my side. Paneer Tikka Masala and Biryani was still left. Biryani almost 80-85% still in the container. we didn't even feel like taking it home!

1079732,2016-05-17,1,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"I had (1) Turban Weekday (buffet) = $11.99 + tax -- (1) Pav Bhaji = $10.95 + tax -- my grand total was $24.80.

There were some good points and bad points about this place:

The GOOD:
The pav bhaji was delicious. The buffet had some tasty selections such as the tender butter chicken... and the goat curry was a little spicier and had more of a (welcomed) kick than the goat curry I've had at Angara Indian Spice Grill. The buffet is $12 which is standard fare for Indian food buffets in Vegas. The Gulab jamun (dessert) (also on the buffet) are like little delicte pancake balls swimming in pancake syrup -- they are awesome

The BAD:
I went here SPECIFICALLY because they have Pav Bhaji and almost NONE of the other Indian restaurants in town have this. For the uninformed, Pav Bhaji is a street food in Mumbai (a/k/a Bombay, the capital and most populous city in India), it is a curry that consists of mashed potatoes and tomatoes and a bunch of other veggies... Now, I'm sure (over there in Mumbai) Pav Bhaji is only like $1-$5... but here it 'says' it's $9.50 but when I got my check it said it was $10.95 (yikes!) -- Plus, it doesn't look like they made the rolls (literally the 'pav' in 'pav bhaji') from scratch... it looks like they just got some standard dinner rolls from a local grocery store and toasted them too crispy... I was expecting hot soft yeast rolls with butter on top... plus the portion size was disappointing seeing as how it's $10.95 (see my pics)

The naan (bread) -- which came free upon request with the buffet purchase --  was burnt and (practically tasteless) it tasted like old leftover crispy pizza crust... good thing it was free because if I had paid for it I'd be pissed.

The 'tandoori' chicken wasn't cooked authentically (see pics) as REAL Tandoori chicken is cooked in a tandoor -- a clay pot -- hence the name tandoori chicken... this was just grilled chicken coated in tandoori spices... so it was definitely missing some of that smokey flavor you'd get if you ACTUALLY cooked it in a tandoor -- the BEST Tandoori chicken I've had came from India Palace

The food on the buffet was good but the buffet was generally small when compared to other Indian buffets

This place is really dark... now, I've come to know that that's apparently 'the thing' in Indian restaurants (in India)... that dark ('romantic') atmosphere... but this was at 11 am in the morning and I felt like I needed a flashlight... kinda annoying.

Our server on multiple occasions walked by the buffet line and began munching.. who knows if he even washed his hands. The app we ordered was cold, the lemon garish had some other residue on it... not sure what it was. Of course, by now, Another glass of wine was highly needed, but without prompting wasn't  going to happen, however my cleared plate was on the table next to me so I should have lowered my expectations then and there.

The main course was luke warm at best and that's pushing it. The butter chicken was a tomato sauce (hunts in guessing, yes that bad) and the naan bread was a glorified tortilla; overall chewy and flat.

Chef came to the table after the check was presented, why neither (I or the chef are sure) awkward interaction, then left.

I ordered the Himalayan Chicken on the recommendation of the owner and it was great - very flavorful, some nice warmth but not too spicy, and overall left me full but not feeling heavy.  It came with a huge butter nan which was very fresh and soft, as well as some rice.

Extremely efficient and friendly service and the owner was great, anticipating my needs from across the restaurant and making sure I was happy.  The food was halal, which was important to me, and tasted great.  I noticed one of the starters was infused with vodka, so be careful when ordering if, like me, you avoid alcohol.

After the meal I asked for the masala chai, worried that it might be overly strong like a lot of badly done masala chai, the owner assured me not to worry and the chai was turned out to be very good.

The restaurant has a lot of interesting vegetarian and non-vegetarian options, fast friendly service and great food, as well as an fun full size Indian rickshaw cab in the front of the restaurant :). 

I got a Yelp deal for checking in here for the first time $12 for food and drinks if you spend $20, felt slightly guilty as I would happily have spent more - recommended!",cuauHyVu9qpQOBUPoLAKMA,2,0,4,ggLTtJ1OcpQpDfXGDZW2XA

I am a vegan and usually it's a hassle when I try to explain that to the waiter at EVERY other Indian restaurant. They usually proceed to throw out options without explaining what they are as if my Caucasian self is supposed to know. Not at the urban turban. As soon as me and my friend explained to the waiter that we were vegan he immediately got the head chef to our table to help us out with the menu. He took his time with us and presented us with some off menu items as well. Not only was the service fantastic but the food was even better.

The waiter was extremely helpful and went above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. The manager was also a nice gentleman which asked that i put this review on here. Ok so yes he asked but fuck it they deserve this great review. The food was great and not a single item on the buffet was dry/tasteless/underwhelming. They take pride on their Nan. Supposedly they have a certain oven for this Nan which most others dont. I didnt see it but i did taste it and that was some damn good Nan. We went during a weekday but i was told to come back for the weekend as they had Seafood on the buffet line. It sounded very interesting. I Would recommend to anyone. Wish i remembered the servers name to recommend to others. He was a mexican american (i believe) medium sized gay guy. Sorry only description i could think of.

Food mediocre at absolute best. Less variety than most Indian buffets I've gone to, and Indian is my favorite cuisine, so I've been to more than a few. Naan was flat and stale. Service in the restaurant was almost nonexistent- one glass of water never refilled, even after requesting.

Waiter took our credit card and came back without the bill. Had to take it again. Sketchy. Love monitoring credit card statements.

On a Monday afternoon, there weren't many other customers at UT. But the food was excellent and we were treated by the staff at UT. My wife being a vegetarian, we went straight for the veggie fare and started off with samosa chat. The samosa chat was great and not like the usual super spicy fare back in India, but yet very flavorful. We were served Dahi Puri while we were waiting for the samosa chat and we attacked it like a pair of hungry vegetarian wolves.

Being tempted by the starters, we proceeded to order Paneer (cottage cheese) Tikka Masala which was served with rice and naan. I would say this is a must have non-menu item (ask for it!) for the very smooth and subtle flavor of the gravy with nice soft chunks of paneer. 

We topped the gastronomic ride with masala chai and nimbu paani (lemonade) and weren't disappointed there either. Again, smooth taste but not overpowering.

Lack of food labeling in the buffet was quite an annoyance as well. Good thing I know what most foods are. I also saw that certain dishes they load up like the chicken tikkas and they sit out drying under the lamp. They definitely need to up their game when operating a buffet. 

For the prices they charge for items they can afford food labels properly printed and even detail what each dish actually contains in buffet for allergy purposes 

On the positive best butter chicken and raita in town.  

We also noticed that their naans and well the whole menu is over priced. But the naans we found hilarious. 
Regular Naan is $3
With cheese it's $4
But if you add garlic and butter it's and extra $3.50 making it $7.50 

Last I checked butter and garlic should not cost $3.50. Rip off alert!!!! Couldn't stop laughing.

I only had the Vada Pav at this place and I wish I had a more elaborate dinner or lunch. My first impression of this trendy Indian restaurant is of their urban decor with Indian aesthetic. There is an auto rickshaw parked near the main entrance and a huge bar right behind it. The service is very friendly and the Vada Pav tasted authentic. 

Mr. Bhushan, the owner of the restaurant, is an amazing listener. I just wanted to talk to him briefly about clearly distinguishing vegan food items on the menu and right away he sat me down and showed me the yet-to-be-released new menu with vegan, vegetarian, gluten free options. When I told him I am visiting Vegas as part of my documentary on Veganism, he was interested in learning more about me and my interest in the topic. I advised him on substituting butter with Earth Balance ""Butter"" because of its low calorie, no cholesterol and good fat properties, he immediately called his chef for taking note of my suggestions. We ended up talking for almost an hour about using meat and dairy alternatives simply because they are healthier, environmentally friendly and not to mention save lives of animals who don't deserve to die to feed our bellies. Customers are becoming more aware of the health risks and cruelty behind meat and dairy as well and almost all the restaurants in Vegas now have several vegan/vegetarian items on their menu. 

Urban Turban will be my go to place on my next visit to Vegas. You can go to Sin City and still not commit any sins.",f7jg69qMuLExp9SMh-lYwA,7,4,5,rGWMc2UKXfcz_lNAhNNZBQ

And not in the literal sense, though there is a rickshaw by the hostess stand for photo ops.

Dine in at the bar or in the dining room proper, service is attentive and décor is dark and classy. Menu is a bit muddled, with small bites taking the most space and odd fusion items (Indian pizza anyone?) featured on HH special, but the traditional items are where they shine: chicken tikka masala, lamb curry, and fish curry were all delicious, sided with an impeccable butter naan and a mountain of white rice.

Bottomless curies and traditional dishes are just under $20/ea, before adding in apps (average $10) and drinks (full bar). This isn't your usual takeout indian or buffet bargain, but the quality is better than many other places in town.

EDIT: Dropping a star after another visit. Was too focused on the flavor to care much my first visit but the portion of meat in the curries is minimal, making this place a poor value.

3900 Paradise Rd
Las Vegas, NV 89169

Our second visit to Urban Turban occurred June 15, 2015.  There were five of us on attendance - it was my and my friend's second visit, my husband and best friend's first visit, and my son's third visit.  My son really likes Indian food, especially since serving overseas, and has made this his ""Go To"" Indian restaurant simply for the amazing bottomless curry dishes.

On this visit I wanted to clarify some of the negative interpretations about Indian food and table service.  Luckily, we had a fantastic American waiter named Jose.  Jose had been working here for sometime and was happy to answer my questions.  I commented that most of the Indian restaurants we checked out served all our food lukewarm.  We were told that some Indian dishes are served cold, stone cold and room temperature simply because that is the way they are made to be served, however curry soups and other main course hot dishes should be served very warm.  Second, I asked about American table service compared to Indian service in restaurants.  I commented that Indian service was greatly lacking when compared to American table service.  We were told that Indian culture usually serves the food and leaves you alone with it, and also they dishes are usually made and served one at a time rather than several dishes at a time.  Also, Indian waiters do not hover over the table, but usually wait until summoned to the table to take orders, serve food or refill drinks.  Service and attention is pretty laid back and slow, and nonchalant.  Another thing we were told is most drinks are not served iced.  So if your waiter is Indian you need to request ice.

Service with Jose - 5 stars

We have enjoyed the food so much, but the service sometimes was slow and erratic.  So it was nice to have an American waiter with Indian cultural knowledge he learned from the owners and other workers.

For this visit we ordered beverages of Coke and Mango Lassi.  The Mango Lassi is a fruit drink of puréed mango that looks like it has milk or yogurt added to it.  It's delicious.  We also ordered Buttered Chicken, Egg Curry, Bombay Fish Fry, Flavor Burst appetizer, Gun Powder Shrimp and Naan Sense.  We enjoyed everything except the Flavor Burst, which is a puff a pastry served cold with a spiced filling.  We just did not care for the flavor.  The Bombay Fish Fry was a whole fried fish - very good.  The Butter Chicken is served in a red sauce which is delicious and the chicken is so tender it melts in your mouth.   Bottomless Egg Curry was delicious.  I recommend getting your refill as just curry on the curry soup dishes and leave the meat r egg out of the extra serving, so that when you take the leftover home, it last longer in the refrigerator - because after all the curry is the best part of the dish. 

Food - 4 stars",jvmB9pym9-VVf-TBOUMGeg,1,1,4,UTBBTxnmQAOPqsDlGSwqMQ

The Bombay fries were good too. It was nice that they made veggie biryani for us because the menu only had chicken biryani. Biryani was flavorful but tasted more like pulao.

Urban Turban is the jam. Here is what you need to know.

1. It's not family style like most Indian restaurants. You get your own plate. 
2. Naan and rice is included with curries.
3. Curries are bottomless. Eat to your heart's content. I had the fish curry and it was AMAZING!! Spicy, flavorful and aromatic.
4. No cheesy Indian music. They play normal radio top 40 stuff that your car might have.
5. The decor isn't over the top Indian and campy. There is a cool rickshaw in the front, but other than that, the furniture is modern.
6. End your meal with a paan shot. Look at the photos.

Everest, etc.). Las Vegas restaurant scene is very competitive, particularly when you are located next to many good choices.

I am sad to say that Urban Turban didn't live up to my expectations. It's a really good concept to do a pseudo Indian fusion, but on many of the items we tried, it frankly falls flat on some of the dishes. Here are some of the things that we tried.

Appetizers

- Dry Fruit Bread - Hardly any raisins, but i'm not sure if sweet naan works with curries. 
-  Samosa Chaat - Big Samosas, they're flakey, but the filling was ok, it needs more spices.
- Lamb Bhaji Pav - Its minced lamb meat with peas and other species, probably the best appetizer I've had here.
- Paneer Tikka - I'm not the paneer fan, but the tandoori sauce really brought out the flavors in the paneer pieces. Another must try if you like Paneer.
- Bhaji Pav - Needs a lot of work. It was tasted like something that Gerber scientists cooked up. Plain, no flavor and overpriced.

Main Entree

- Butter Chicken - The sauce was little too sweet, but it was packed with flavors. The biggest issue here was that there were hardly any meat in the curry. 
- Bombay masala lamb - curry lacked flavor, spice, and meat. 
- Five Herb noodles - my dinner partners loved it but I really wasn't a fan. It was hard to get the herb flavor and it just doesn't go well with Indian curries (Noodles are not Indian, Indo-Asian Fusion may be). 
- Butter Naan - same as any place
- Basmati Rice - Fragrant and delicious, but nothing new (its hard to mess up rice, unless if I'm cooking). 

Dessert

- Paan Shot - Must try dessert, cheap and full of flavor. 
- Chocolate Samosas - It's unique, but nothing new. It's also very messy item to eat if you are sharing with others. 

Service
- It was good, the servers were very attentive, but they did mess up our naan and  other condiment orders. I think having some Indian servers can help the business since they can explain the variety of indian food they offer here. 

Parking
- Lot is was pretty empty, I think since Firefly (AKA - LV Salmonella Factory) got closed. If you have a car that's been lowered be careful and drive slow there is a steep gradient where you can do serious damage if you are driving too fast (Look for the sudden dip sign). 

Overall, its an interesting place, but the food quality needs to improve to even consider this place with good Indian restaurant. 

Also, I read through lot of the reviews for this location, but I find the review by John L. to be very suspicious. He opened his Yelp account in December 2014, wrote the first review on 12/30/2014 and gave it 5/5. Also, the review looks like a PR(or a manager) guy wrote it from a customer perspective.

Overall 2/5.",kwIhn1_cnQeUaLN0CuWWHw,10,2,2,7gOOtBHWbSVTv6NtVTYhLw

The only negative here was that a party of about 14 arrived minutes before us and that really slowed everything down.  The waiting at our table ended up being about 20 minutes.  Sometimes you can't help the unexpected.   Ed did check on us often though and kept our drinks full!

We heard about the new lunch buffet and we will be back before we go back home next week!  That says a lot as the choices in Las Vegas are infinite!  We are picky coming from Seattle where we find many great restaurants. 

We met the manager here after we finished our meal and he told us about an after dinner shot that aids in digestion with mint and a spice I am unable to recall now but it worked!   I forgot to mention how great the naan bread was too! Oops! 

All in all do check this place out!!!",z6wLiRdIEeA15__huN2HKw,3,1,5,HiyXjHVQNJKQa-yEB3Ik0Q

The server came over and explained the menu. They have bottomless curries, tapas and entrees. I ordered a Mojito features cocktail,  it was pretty standard and not anything special.
A complimentary appetizer of papadum was dropped with a green and red sauce. We ordered chicken tikka and paneer tikka.  Usually tikka has a lot of sauce, but these items just seemed dipped in the tikka sauces and the plated. The chicken tikka was really good but I found the paneer tikka very dry. We also got the daal and Himalayan curry. Both dishes were served with naan and bastmati rice. Each dish was very tasty and authentic.

2140036,2016-08-10,0,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"While in vegas for a conference, I was craving for some good indian food and came across urban turban. I was enticed by good reviews and great pictures/presentation on yelp (Bhaji pav, vada pav, bhel etc.) but the place didn't meet expectations. I am a vegetarian so review below is around vegetarian items in their buffet

Good:
- The place has good decor
- The staff is friendly and service was decent. They even accomodated my request for Garlic Naan instead of regular naan they have in buffet.
- Buffet had large selection

Not so Good:
- I came for their chaat and street food items based on yelp pic but on reaching the restaurant, the owner kept insisting I opt for their buffet (which i unfortunately obliged). I should have seen this as a warning sign.
- After seeing other order ala carte, I think many food pics on yelp are not real and taken from internet (all good pics were from a single yelper which raise another red flag).
- The buffet had tons of items but quality was sub-par (somewhat stale and not as flavorful): 
    * Bhajjis were Average fare.
    * Shahi Paneer was watered down. I could only see a few paneer pieces floating
    * Bhindi masala was terrible. Bhindi was so chewy, you could skip your dentist visit and check your teeth's strength on this curry.
    * Other curries were Potato curry and Cabbage. They don't go with Naan and I have seen many establishments serve it for cost cutting (vs. more complex/flavorful curries like malai kofta, eggplant bhartha etc.)
   * Palak Mushroom - Excellent - this was the best part of meal
   * Garlic Naan - Average
   * Rice and Daal - Good
   * Gulab Jamun - Average
   * Cold Coffee - Good
- The price of buffet was $19. I am not cribbing about cost and willing to pay premium for good food but this buffet was just like any other $10 indian buffets I have had at many other restaurants.

Based on this experience, I am not sure if ala carte (chaat and street food) experience will be any better (esp. with fake pics) but can't say for sure till I try it. Although I am more inclined to spend my next $20 at a casino table as that may have better odds of me walking away happy than this place.",dTqJxUo-uKQU-04gmXLa0A,1,0,3,cGp9nsv6UrXDVuwIDsTQCA

2716903,2015-11-20,1,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"I've been here several times now, and I'm a happy and loyal customer.  I've had dinner twice (ordered off the menu) and lunch once (the buffet).  No surprise, but the items prepared to order off the menu are better than the buffet, even though there's nothing wrong with the buffet at all.

There's lots of room inside.  The tables are small and can be pushed together easily for larger groups.  Note that it can be noisy.  The floor is bare and the tables and chairs make ""that noise"" when moved across the floor.  (You know, that metal or plastic on concrete kind of sound.)  Without carpet or something else substantial to dampen the sounds, voices carry, everything echoes, and when there's more than a few people, it can sound noisy.  Not a problem, but worth noting if you're looking for a more intimate or quiet meal.  I think there's also a private group room, but I'm not positive.  Overall, the place has a sort of urban feel rather than the look and feel of a thoroughly traditional Indian restaurant.  Don't worry about that though.  The food is what you're there for.

The buffet has a decent assortment of dishes, most of them popular standards, so you won't be disappointed if you want to make a quick run for Indian food.  The full menu is wonderful, with a great assortment of menu items with chicken, lamb, shrimp and fish.  There are also vegetarian and vegan options.  The appetizers are delicious too, and there are certain dinners served prepared for sharing.  

I recommend trying these:  for starters go for the Mushroom Sweet Garlic, the Lamb Kebabs (to share), or Gun-Powder Shrimp, then move on to the Chicken Tikka Masala, or the Bombay Fish Fry for the main course.  If you're in a curry mood, be sure to check out the Himalayan Chicken.  Take note, you can tell your server how spicy you want your curry.  By the way, don't look past the Paneer Tikka Masala (made with cubed cottage cheese instead of meat).  It's delicious!  Regardless of what you order, try the Garlic Naan to complement your meal and to mop up the delicious sauces.  Being full at this point, I've never made it to dessert, so you're on your own there.

Everything was top notch during the two dinner visits.  Both times we were treated by a hostess who was cheerful and kind, welcomed us to the restaurant with genuine warmth, and quickly seated us.  The waiter each evening (a different guy each time) weren't pushy, but took care of us quickly.  They introduced themselves, talked about menu choices, offered suggestions, took our orders carefully and brought out well-prepared food that was presented nicely.  Our glasses were never empty and as we slowed down, they ensured we knew to-go boxes were available.  I really wish I could remember the two gentlemen's names.  I wrote them down and have since lost the note, but they were great: the kind of waiters any restaurant would want to employ.

My recent visit for lunch was a bit odd though and the reason this isn't a four-star review.  When I arrived at the restaurant, the main door was locked with a sign on it pointing to the right and telling customers to use ""the first door"".  Just down the front is the other door into the restaurant.  That door had a sign on it pointing back to the main door, telling customers to use it instead.  Both doors were locked.  Just then my friend who arrived ahead of me opened a third door, farther down to let me in.  The whole door game was awkward.  I would have figured it out in another few seconds (there had to be another door), but apparently the management didn't think it was important to put new signage on what ended up being the middle door, ensuring customers were easily aware they needed to continue down the storefront to the less obvious third door.

It was 1:00pm and the restaurant only had a few other people in it.  Apparently we missed the main lunch crowd, meaning a quieter lunch and great service was upon us.  The waiter came across the room as we sat down, was quick to take my drink order and confirm we wanted the buffet.  Once that happened and for the rest of the time , he looked and acted as if it was an inconvenience that we were there.  Frankly he looked angry, and acted like it took all his self control not to tell us to hurry up and leave.  Truly it was almost uncomfortable with all the angry looks, and glares.  I thought maybe we were up against an after lunch closing time but on Thursdays they open at 11:00am and serve continuously until 11:00pm, so no issue there.  We were well-behaved and both of us showered, so I'm at a loss why the waiter seemed to have a problem with us.

I ordered 2 samosa chats and Urban Turban gave only gave me one. So, I paid for two on grubhub and only received one. I specifically asked for extra plates/forks because I ordered at a hotel I was staying at and they didnt give any of that. Also, I said mild for some of the plates but they were all spicy.

I added a picture of the advertisement for Vegan Jam Night because the only reason I went was for a 100% vegan BBQ.

There is not a 100% vegan BBQ. There is a vegetarian Indian buffet with some vegan options that stops serving at 10pm (which is not advertised). In the bar, there is an advertisement that says Tuesdays are industry night, half off well and domestics but the bartender didn't know about it. She was nice, just didn't know the specials.

The food was not even OK. Just a few things about this place that kinda irked me though. For $18, chicken tikka masala and half piece of Naan bread and half cooked rice. I was hoping to see thick and tasty gravy but it was simply tomato juice with 4-5 pieces of boiled chicken.
In Egg Curry, 2 eggs were swimming freely and the daal fry has mustered seeds instead of cumin.

This was a return visit and I highly recommend Urban Turban for anyone that might want a ""safer"" choice along the lines of the late-great Firefly (yes, they're still around - but would you eat there? I think not!). The food is awesome, this visit we shared the Bombay Chicken slider (a fave  from the prior visit, a must!), the Butter Chicken Flatbread (excellent), as well as the Spinach and Chicken Fritters (again, delish). I tried two cocktails, the Kiss of Cobra and the Marine Diver - both well worth the price - very exotic and packed a definite punch! The only problem, the service. I see another review posted for the night of 5/30, so maybe it was an off night in general but it was definitely lacking. At one point our server actually snagged the lone drink menu we asked to hang onto (did she not want us to spend more?) and we had to ask for it back. The only member of the waitstaff that was attentive was a woman who was ninja-quick in refilling our waters. Our server 'Alejandra' went completely AWOL & it took an exorbitant amount of time to get the bill (we actually had to request it) - we even noticed the hostess seemed busy flirting with another server as they both hid behind a column near the kitchen. Again, the food and drinks are very good (the atmosphere is inviting if not the most engaging, the bar area seems cozy),

UPDATE: visited again on 11/11. Nearly completely empty at 7 at night, and despite that, the service was even more unattentive and slack than the previous vitist. When I sat down, I immediately grabbed the menu and attempted to order a cocktail from the drink menu on the table and was told that ""there was no bartender in today"" - which seemed odd as they'd just ended their ""happy hour"" (and by the time I left I saw someone served two beverages on a platter that came from the bar area that sure indeed looked like cocktails of some sort). Also, one of the fave items - the Butter Chicken flatbread was no longer on the menu, but oddly now in the 'kiddie section' (which was able to be ordered, but not on par with prior visits and had next to no sauce). Sorry, I really dig the food and the atmosphere and pricing is great - but I won't be back, the service is really just ridiculous and it's like no one cares. To accentuate this point, there was a large family entering when my party was leaving and while the 'host area' appears to not normally be actively staffed, no one approached them and I heard them say ""maybe this is one of those 'seat yourself type places"" - it's a miracle this place is still open.",ViDfpxU9tykjvwchJsq9vQ,3,0,1,bRdw_wm9aMunfdGih0c7DQ

2999478,2015-06-02,0,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"Quick Look: Had been waiting months for a chance to try Urban Turbin. Had a horrific first experience and unfortunately, we left before we even got to sample the food. Think we may have been duped by false positive reviews? Please see below. 

In Depth Review: Had Urban Turbin on our ""must try"" list for many months. The stars aligned and we were both able to go there on the Saturday over Memorial Day Weekend. We arrived at 7pm (prime dinner hour). We walked in and we were greeted by an enthusiastic female greeter. She asked us if we wanted to sit in the darker lounge/bar area or the dining room. Looked into the dining room and it seemed empty and very bright. Chose the more intimate bar/lounge area. The hostess seemed eager to point out the good dishes. She introduced us to the new bartender and said he would take care of us. She then contradicted herself and said she was going to take our order and would be back. The bartender took our drink order, we ordered two Bombay Mules (Moscow Mules) with Hendricks Gin. They were perfect and tasted great. 

So the confusion begins... the female hostess disappeared and never came back. We sat there a long time waiting. I went up to the bar to get the bartender. He had his back to me and seemed to be struggling with the POS system. I said; can we place our order with you? He came to the table, we ordered our food. We ordered the Gun Powder Shrimp and Garlic Nan Bread as an appetizer. Then we ordered a signature chicken dish and a bottomless lamb curry dish as our entrees. We asked him to make sure we had enough time to eat our appetizer before the entrees came out. Then we go back to waiting. During the wait time, I saw that when I checked in on Yelp, I would get a complimentary glass of wine. So, I redeemed it. The wine was bitter and spoiled and there was lipstick on the side of my wine glass (not from me). The drink was free, so I did not complain. 

So we are waiting, and then our entrees arrive to the table. We were shocked because the appetizers did not come out yet. Not even the bread. The food runner said the appetizers were still being made. To which I said, I would like my appetizer first, can you please make that happen? The food goes away (side note: it looked and smelled delicious). So we are waiting again. So a new food runner comes out with our Gun Powder Shrimp. The guy walks right by us and goes over to the bar to say hello and chat with three regulars. We are watching him from 15 feet away, he is talking, goes in for a hug etc. Then turns to come to our table. As he is walking over a shrimp rolls off what looks like bread. He goes ""whoops"" and proceeds to use his bare hand to pick up the shrimp and put it back. Then tries to hand it to us to eat. We were shocked, so was the bartender. At this point we have been waiting almost an hour with no food. We just asked to settle up for the drinks and said we were leaving. 

The bartender was embarrassed and very apologetic. He comped or drinks, we thanked him and quickly left to go get food elsewhere as we were starving. 

In Summary: Urban Turban has some obvious service issues. I suspect a lack of long-term hospitality experience with the owners and people in management positions. I also suspect that the staff might not be up to date with the rules set forth by the Southern Nevada Health District. Too bad, because it is reflecting on business. That restaurant should have been slammed at 7pm on a Saturday, over our busiest holiday weekend in Vegas. I hope that the owners read this review and make the proper changes to their business.

The two dishes were Pan Fried Tandoori Pomfret (Fish) and Classic Crab Masala from Konkani region (Western India). I notified Urban Turban that we were going to dine in the restaurant on a Saturday night and my interest in the two dishes mentioned above. Within a few hours, I got a call from the owner of Urban Turban informing me that the Pomfret Fish and Crab Masala will be prepared and ready upon my arrival in the evening. I appreciate the good service and prompt communication over the telephone from UT. We received a warm welcome from UT management and acknowledgement that our dinner would be ready in a few minutes.
Pan Fried Tandoori Pomfret - This dish was making itself known as it was being brought to our table. The aroma originating from the dish was appetizing. It was prepared with spices and herbs which we were longing for. The fish had a crisp layer outside and was soft, delicate and tasty from the inside. Each bite was absolutely delicious. When I was done, nothing but the bones remained on the dish. Great job!
Classic Crab Masala - This was the second course on our menu. It consisted of two large hard shell crabs covered with delicious curry masala complete with flavors infused right from Bombay. It was a sheer delight cracking open the crab and immersing its meat into the masala and then taking a tasteful bite. The chef did an awesome job preparing this dish. I had to ask to meet the chef and thank him for the custom prepared dishes for us.
Urban Turban continues to manage to be versatile with its menu and therefore remains an interesting place to visit during our trips to Vegas.

Went here tonight with one of our vegan friends and boy did we have a bad experience. 
For starters it took for ever to get our order taken and when we asked our server for suggestions he said he was new and would go get someone else to help us with suggestions.  Our server returns and said they were too busy and that he could try with the couple things that he had tried. We placed our order, 2 appetizer and 2 entrees and then sat around almost another half an hour before anything was brought to our table. When our appetizer were dropped off one of them wasn't even anything that we ordered and when we asked where the app we did order was it we were just told that it was still on its way.
Now the biggest issue is one of our friends is vegan and that's the main reason we came here because she's heard good things, well her food was not vegan as it dairy based which we did not find out about until we started eating and questioning our server about what the appetizer we didn't order was. He then went and got the manager who told us her dish was vegan just the sauce was not.... At this point we decided that we would just leave and not have our entrees since at this point we could not trust what our friend ordered would be vegan or not. We offered to pay for our drinks but the manager insisted that we stay and he'd give us our food for free. I'm sorry but if you are server vegan or kosher food it had better be prepared that way. 
After telling the manager and server three times we'd rather not have the entrees they finally let us leave.  This was a very disappoint experience since our vegan friend was really looking forward to trying this place out.",ryzNoSd9FRdlMlLEuwJtrA,2,0,1,nh_lh8SZ1CqFJO9V0976gA

You can get all kinds of fusion foods now away but Indian fusion is a first and a fun adventure to take your taste buds on. I had a meal that put me in a food coma. Try everything because it's all good. 

The Bhel Puri dish; which ideal for vegans and veggie lovers; was perfectly spiced. Not doused in tamarind sauce but not neglected either, just a nice blend. The puri is nice and big so you can get it with almost every bit til the dish is done. Very little onion; which worked great for me since I am not a big onion fan but if you want just let the server know and they can make it with extra onion. This dish didn't look big but damn it feed four very hungry and big adults!

The Bombay platter dish is like tapas of a meat plate. Tandoori flavored shrimp, some very big shrimp! Lamb kabobs and tandoori chickens bits. All very good! The only draw back is the dish was $40 and does not come with bread. It makes up for this by being a huge dish and consumable by fingers and or hands!

The lamb curry is the softest lamb you will ever have! It's not very spicy but still very scrumptious. The bread is included with the dish and it's just as soft as the lamb. A definite must try!

As for desert you need to get a paan shot and chocolate samosa if you still are conscious! The paan shot has no alcohol in it and is just amaze balls, hell it makes obesity look like a great life choice. The chocolate samosa is like fried ice cream you eat at sushi places and you know what; it's just as good!

Food
ordered 2 curried dishes, biryani, naan; 
Butter chicken- bland, sweet
Paneer tikka- sweet, spicy. Creamy?! 
Chicken biryani was spicy, flavorful and had nice presentation. 
Naan- under cooked and warn at best when served. 

Drinks 
Ordered Tamarind margarita- was Ok 
Beer on Tap(Stella) OLD and simply nasty(has nasty smell)

Service
the server was friendly and that is why I gave my review 2 STARS. Though food was below average except for Biryani I tipped the server 15% for his service. 

The place was unorganized, ambiance- looked if a warehouse was turned into a restaurant! I could hear arguments between servers and cooks. There was a table who must have waited 45 minutes for their food and then they received partial order. When they were leaving the gentleman stared conversation with me and recommended me to try Delhi restaurant instead. He also stated he is friends with the owner who kept inviting him to try this place so he did and was leaving disappointed. He also shared that the same owner owns a restaurant in New Zealand.

1) We went here at 1 pm on a Sunday and there was absolutely no one at that time! Should've taken the hint. The high rating on yelp is really puzzling to me.

3591711,2015-01-13,1,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"Urban Turban is a restaurant based off an Indian Fusion Bombay Style restaurant in Auckland New Zealand - I don't really know what that means exactly but the food quality here is a little higher than your typical Indian buffet or dive spot.

Coming from the Bay Area, there's a lot of choices for good, cheap Indian food especially in Silicon Valley. In Vegas, the choices are noticeably fewer and I think a higher class of Indian food could catch on.

However, I didn't find that my experience here was eye opening nor a particularly good value. The prices and stipulations with the ""bottomless"" curries were discouraging to me. The primary stipulation with the bottomless curry is that they aren't to be shared, and naan and rice can be charged if you want extra. That being said it was plenty of food, so if you don't come in starving, you'll probably be full after a plate of food.

One thing that was quite nice here was their rice. It was tender, non-sticky, and yet not dry at all. I had the Himalayan Curry. The chicken inside the curry was extremely tender and tasted of a higher quality overall than most other Indian food joints. My curry itself seemed a little watery, and while the menu said it was spicy, I couldn't detect much personally. The GM did come out and say if I had a problem with it, he would gladly bring me a spicier one but I was too full at that point.

My friend had the Chicken Tikka Masala, which, not being a curry, was not part of the bottomless deal - which is a bit of a bummer still. The naan was quite good, though nothing special in my mind.

I don't really know what a good value is at a place like this - the atmosphere does speak to a higher level of quality, but the food on the plate wasn't so outstanding, especially when I compare them to a typical Indian restaurant. I'm curious to see how well they can do with the location and price point, but for now I will give them a barely passing grade.",KbwOwQZTOfrtaeJdmucALQ,2,6,3,LDvA8QCXEEqIbadqlaGa-g

Ah..Urban Turban...+0.29 stars for the clever and catchy name..it'll make sense when you walk in and see how they've put a hipster spin on their ambiance. 


DO TRY...
- TANDOORI CHICKEN - 54/5 (not a typo...that's a 54 out of 5) - easily BEST tandoori chicken of my life! So juicy...so tender...so red...so beautiful. Other indian places ive been to have too much of a smoky flavor to their tandoori chicken but Urban Turban's was perfect. I literally cannot think of any complaints. TRY IT!
- GOAT CURRY - 4.5/5 - im not even a big fan of goat but their goat curry was delish. Nice tender and meaty chunks floating in curry..yum. 
- GARLIC NAAN - 6/5 - comes out hot n' fresh to your table. emphasis on the HOT. and crispy. so fresh. and cripy. did I mention it was hot and crispy and fresh? GET IT! DIP IT IN ALL DA CURRIEZ.
- FRITTERS w/ Chutneys - 4.5/5 - Not what you'd traditionally picture a fritter to be, expect more like deep fried slivers of onion, but very tasty. Please do yourself a favor and don't forget to dip the fritters in the chutneys. Salivating jus thinking about it.. ..
- BUTTER CHICKEN - 3.5/5 - too buttery for my taste but still worth a try. 
- 'RICE' PUDDING - 4/5 - pretty sure they labeled it rice pudding BUT its basically like angel hair pasta pieces in sweet milk with raisins tossed in. sounds unappetizing and looks unappetizing but I had 3 bowls of it. nom.

DONT GET TOO EXCITED ABOUT...
SALAD- not your traditional salad...more cabbage than lettuce. I'd pass on this.
GULAB JAMUN - mysterious brown balls floating in a syrup. usually my favorite thing to eat an indian restaurant but theirs seemed to have a stronger ginger flavor I wasn't diggin'. worth a try, but not such wow. 

LOCATION/PARKING - 5/5 - Same plaza as Tacos & Beer. Not too far from The Strip. Parking was easy peasy on labor day morning. 

SERVICE - 5/5 - Abundance of workers - every single one of them seemed genuinely friendly and attentive (usually a rarity at a cheap buffet!). Consistently checked up to see if we needed anything. 

OVERALL - definitely worth a visit! Even a picky eater should be able to find at least 1 thing they'd enjoy -- even vegetarians!

We were first brought three papadum with mint and mango chutneys.  I liked both.  The mint had a good amount of heat to it unlike what I've had before.  

Next up were:  dry fruit whole wheat bread, Samosa chat, lamb kheema pav, and paneeer tikka and pav bhaji.  There were two winners here--the lamb kheema and the paneer tikka.  I really enjoyed the grilled flavor of the paneer and the lamb had good texture ingredients.  The lamb was served with bun halves that you could make a slider if you wanted.  I chose to use it as a base for the meat.  One real miss here was the dry fruit whole wheat.  I thought it was garlic naan.  I could not tell that there was any stuffing of nuts or raisins in the bread.  

For the mains, we got two curries and the five herb noodles recommended to us by the owner as his favorite dish.  The curries were good with a small amount of meat in each one.  I expect that's why the curries are bottomless.  The five herb noodles were my favorite of the night.  Really good seasonings and something quite different.

For dessert, we each got a paan shot (highly recommended) and we ordered a chocolate samosa.  It reminded me of a dessert in a Mexican restaurant with fried dough and ice cream with chocolate drizzled over the dough and the ice cream.

The restaurant is very nicely done.  It's a modern room with wood tables and lights hanging from the ceiling.  Service was OK.  One must do is to take a photo of someone in your party in the rickshaw.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,14,8,3,qQDaZ-qjgdbVOSitCW0v8w

On our plate:

Kheema Pav - this is a dish similar to scrambled eggs, but made with beef or goat mince and served with a street style bread -called pav. This version was pretty close with what you get back in India... dry, seasoned well and non-oily. 

Chicken tikka - real charcoaled grilled tikkas fresh from the grill - very delicious.
 
Chicken biryani - came in a pot sealed with dough, piping hot and very well done. Spiced to perfection, flavorful and great quantity. 

Garlic naan -  fresh and crispy 

Paan shot - this is a non-alcoholic after dinner aperitif. It is the liquid form of paan or betelnut leaf. It's become very popular in high end restaurants in India and great to see Urban Turban bringing it to us here in the U.S.

Over all, this was a most excellent meal and could be a 5-star review if the restaurant sorted out its issues in the kitchen and with the service. Service is a little sketchy and seems they were having delays in the kitchen. Towards the end of the meal, we also felt a little rushed - would have liked to sit back and enjoy the last few bites of the excellent biryani and savored the paan shot, but didn't really get the chance to do that. However the staff seems really genuine and it would be great if they could figure out a way to iron out these issues. 

PRO TIP: If you're not sure what to order, chat with the staff or the owner Bhushan - they gave us great advice about not over ordering and and we were happy to go with their recommendations.

I brought my Mom, brother and sister here for lunch  yesterday and I will NEVER go back. It was all bad from the start. We were seated and given warm tap water to drink. No ice. We asked about the buffet and the waiter raved about it. I don't know why since when my brother and I took a look it was all old looking. The rice looked, um, crunchy? We decided to order fresh food from the menu. We asked the waiter what was lactose free for my bro and he went to ask the chef. He came back to tell him and then jet off before we could actually order. Then... we waited, and waited, and waited. I waved down one man and he said he would get our waiter. 30 minutes in and we finally order our food.
42 MINUTES LATER (yes, I counted) I was angry. We were literally the ONLY people there! When our food arrived it looked great! I was convinced the delicious food would make up for all that came before. We were starving so we dug right in with gusto. I was immediately turned off by my chicken tikka masala. The chicken was gross. Slimey and possible undercooked. The sauce is what really upset me and gave me a theory as to why our food took so long. It tasted like it was right out of a can and then simmered with some onions and peppers. But not for long enough. It lacked any real flavor at all.  I asked for it to spicy and it had no spice at all... they probably forgot to add the spice since they were ""maybe"" rushing to get the sauce done at all. It was by far the worst plate of Indian food I have ever had. And, by ""had"" I mean let sit in front of me.
Brother liked his lentil stew, sister said her paneer butter masala was ok and Mom liked her samosas.
The best thing about this whole meal was the jumbo naan. That was all I ate after two bites of that slop they served me and charged me $17 for!

The mint chutney was also delicious. Lots more to try next visit like chocolate samosas....",p4ot_tZ-6e0M-OHcsNlMcA,2,2,5,ua_7IaZIL-fkjOFCQoZS9A

On my most recent visit, I had the lunch buffet for the first time. While it was slightly more expensive than I expected (comes in at $11.95) I was glad it included naan. There were a variety of selections (for the vegetarian and non-vegetarian) and the quality seemed to match that of their entrees I had enjoyed previously. (My favorite is the butter chicken). 

The wait staff is always very friendly and helpful with their suggestions. On my last visit the owner stopped by and made a point to learn my name and that of the friend that I was with. That doesn't happen very often. He was also excited to learn that we were both locals. Apparently locals do not visit as often as tourists do.

4374188,2016-09-27,3,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"This review is purely for the weekday Indian buffet. It was good, but I've had much better at other Indian lunch buffets. My boyfriend and I came in at around 12pm on a Monday, and found the very open seating area to be very empty. During our lunch, only two other people came in to dine. A couple took to-go. I expect that it fills up later on at night, as there was a separate area for the bar.

Upon first glance at the buffet, I immediately thought that the options were limited, but it ended up being just enough for me! There are plenty of vegetarian options. HOWEVER, the vegetarian options were bland for Indian food. Lacked strong flavors, and that's why I enjoy Indian food in the first place. I liked that they have papadum, which I don't usually see offered at buffets. I loaded up a whole plate full of these chips. Cripsy with salt and tang from the chutneys. May have been my favorite, along with the butter chicken. This was well seasoned and creamy. The butter naan was more like roti in that it was more of a thin, soft, and dense texture and lacked crunch. I enjoyed this. My boyfriend, on the other hand, said he prefers his naan crunchy and airy. The gulab jamun was not as milky as I had expected.

To conclude, some items were good, just not enough for me to give higher ratings. I'd be willing to Urban Turban again sometime (possibly for their tapas and American/Indian fusion dishes).",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,6,5,3,DGo9kWPvvZDqBbdrCxaJDw

So no wine for us.  The buffet was okay - there was a lot of variety and even Indian eggplant but nothing stood out, no complex flavor profile.

It was only at 6.25 pm that the attendant visited out table and that too after asking around twice for some service. And to top this, he placed this order in the kitchen at 6.38 pm and we know this because their kitchen is not sound proof.

Now I can live with poor service, but that clubbed with mediocre food is a recipe for disaster.
We called for a plate of VADA PAV to begin with. This dish has been my staple food for the last almost 3 decades and this was definitely one of the worst ones I've had so far. The Vada was cold with hardly any flavor. The lassan chutney was okay. The Pav was the only saving grace of the dish.

Next came in the LAMB KHEEMA PAV which was good to be frank. Not the best I've had, but tasted good enough. Although I had pieces of ginger in my mouth a couple of times which was a little disappointing.

We got the VEG. KORMA with NAAN for main course. The vegetables were not fresh and seemed like those frozen veggies we get at supermarkets. Also, there weren't enough of them in the dish - less veggies and more gravy. The Naan was rubbery and not too great either.

Finally after the disappointing meal we got up to leave and that's when the manager came to us to ask how our experience was. We told him the truth about our experience and he got extremely defensive. He also promised that he would refund the dinner amount, which he obviously did not.
I don't think I would ever recommend this restaurant to anyone.",UnUwWCaogyBensnLItiSkg,6,0,1,xZhC_IsvB99cjt-SLyI7vA

DINNER

Let me sum it up. Las Vegas has a great selection of Indian food, off-Strip and off-Downtown. Better than any I ever found in my 41 years of living in LA. Take your pick of restaurants, you'll get variations of cuisines and quality of experience from very good to fantastic. Buffets or ala carte, both experiences are outstanding. Now, we have ONE favorite Indian restaurant out of all of them, but Urban Turban has now moved up to number two, and may overtake number one, judging upon what we encounter during our next visit to the fave.

OK. Now the details.

My spouse and I had been to Urban Turban one time before, using a Travelzoo for their tapas items. We loved the food and drinks, and wanted to return. So when a friend decided to host a party to celebrate his return visit to Vegas, he asked if we'd like to attend, and we did.

We arrived before everyone else in the party. Jose, the restaurant host who later became our waiter, asked if we'd like to wait in the bar for the rest of our party. Sure!

Our bartender, forgot her name but she had just moved here from Texas, was new yet very attentive and engaging. We each got a great cocktail from her, me an Old Fashioned, my spouse a concoction containing St George gin & absinthe called Kiss of the Cobra, subtle in flavor (hard to believe) yet very strong. And Jose, out of the blue, brought to the bar, gratis, a small plate of something that resembled Indian nachos (but not as messy), and those were terrific.

The party of 8 present, we sat in the bar area at a high top for dinner. Jose was extremely knowledgeable regarding all of the food. First Jose got out of the kitchen more of those nachos we had at the bar, for everyone else to try. Then everyone ordered their food.

Our party host and others present were quite generous, purchasing a few additional dishes for the table, I think mostly due to the menu being so interesting. Those passed dishes were:

- Lamb Sliders: I didn't try these, as I was having lamb for dinner, but everyone who tried it liked it a lot.

- Mushroom Sweet Garlic: Fried mushrooms. Yum.

- Bhel: A fascinating and delicious dish. Rice puffs (like Rice Crispies) tossed with veges (particularly those tomatoes) and a tamarind sauce. I've never ordered such a thing in an Indian restaurant, and I've had lots of Indian food in the past. LOVED this dish. Our party host referred to it as ""Indian breakfast food"" to the unknowing at the table. He had had it before and loves it.

- Fried Onions: I didn't catch the name, but that was basically what they were. Very good.

Next came the entrees.

Urban Turban has numerous entree selections, but also has a section in the menu entitled ""Bottomless Curries"". Containing 7 different dishes of chicken, lamb and vegetarian in nature, you can eat as much as you want of the main portiona, but you only get the initial naan, rice and salad with the first serving. I ordered the bottomless Bombay Lamb Masala, which was lovely and quite hot with spice. (My spouse and I can take intense heat, and sometimes request it, but this time I preferred it not be too extreme, and this was perfect.) My spouse had the bottomless Egg Curry, which is a street fave in Bombay, and very unusual. Hard boiled eggs in a sauce, it was completely different from my sauce and also lovely. Our party host was flipping out that they had the Egg Curry dish at all, he ordered it, and then he went on to say that it had the best plain rice he had ever eaten in any Indian restaurant. My spouse and I ate only one additional bowl after the first, and that was more than enough.

Someone at the table ordered bottomless Butter Chicken, which I tried, again it was completely different from any other sauces I had and was terrific. Another ordered bottomless Palak Paneer Masala, which contained spinach and those Indian cheese cubes, the dish like a Saag Paneer, and that was great. She even asked for her second bowl to be ""Indian hot"", and she was quite pleased. And another ordered the Garlic Shrimp Flatbread, and that looked great.

At the very end our party host decided to try something else unusual, so he ordered the In-House Made Ice Cream. He chose 2 flavors: betel nut and rose. The betel nut was really weird, but good. Bright green in color like basil, a slight anise flavor to it (someone said Good & Plentys but with mint), we all loved it. The rose was also outstanding. I'm not a huge rose fan, but this hit it out of the park. Both were unusual, tasting more of shaved ice from the Hawaiian places around town, but definitely Indian in style.

During the entire meal Jose was jovial, entertaining, extremely informative, passionate, a fun and fantastic waiter.

My spouse and I will definitely be back.

And watch out, our number one, there's a new competitor in your quality range in town!",_ReALUaGu7Qayk4ULX9wnQ,3,1,5,Vlljm6hnET0-I2gPHGm56Q

Upon entering I had a huge smile on my face when I saw the auto rickshaw right there by the entrance. It's something I used a lot for transportation growing up in Mumbai! A neat touch & quite unique! 

The receptionist, waiter & couple other people who checked on us were very attentive & respectful. The food was absolutely delicious, I loved the saag (spinach), eggplant Bharta & the Chana masala. They had Gulab Jamun for buffet dessert & I found them to melt in my mouth soft. The chai was nice & strong. We got to talk to the owner who is very amicable. He asked if we had tried the ""Paan shots"" & we hadn't, of course we had to. Absolutely loved it! I've never had anything like it before in my 12 years of eating Indian food all over the US.

Then I had the Parda Chicken Biryhani that was beautifully presented in a hot pot covered with a pastry crust on top. Yum!!! I was with some family & friends so I had the opportunity to taste some other appetizers & main dishes as well. Butter chicken pizza?!?  OMG. It was good! And at the end of the meal we tried the ice cream as well as some paan shots that are a must!

The food itself was okay, 3.5/5 stars. The order was ready quickly and we got in and out very fast.

But then things go downhill. The spicing of the dishes was inconsistent at best. I ordered medium and got what would be considered hot at most places, but then one of the dishes was ordered medium and was exceptionally mild. The lack of predictability in the seasoning is a bit concerning. The place was empty when I picked up (8PM on a Saturday night) so it's not like ""we were busy"" would be a good excuse either.

The food is also a terrible value. Let me be clear that I don't expect portion size to scale with price. Not at all. I'm happy to drop $25+ on a smaller entree if the quality is there. But to only include two very small take out containers of rice for four entrees? And a $8 side dish of broccoli includes just 4 florets? It's stunning that they would cheap out on things like that. The entrees themselves were fine, but with how hot my dish was I needed more rice to thin it out. I've been to many places where I got better food for less money.

The place was about 15 mins from the strip and i'm not quite sure why we made the drive all the way to Urban Turban that night. But definitely glad we did:)  It's dimly lit and was super clean and tidy. 
We arrived for dinner around 8:30pm ,and the place was so dead! The bar and the dining hall were both same and it worried me a little.

The manchow soup was insane, and probably my fav. If you like curry and spicy Indian flavors you just gotta try it. It definitely has a kick, and I mean it'll make you sweat (and I eat spicy food every day). The Chili basil chicken bites were soooo good and those went so quick. The Tapas platter was also really good and included chicken tikka, lamb kabobs, Basil chicken, paneer and 2 kinds of shrimp. It came with naan as well and we both enjoyed it all. The basil chili chicken was so perfect, along with the tandoori shrimp. We got a bottomless Lamb dish as well, and that was just okay. The curry was good, but came with very little meat.They refill the curry but not he meat :(  Thankfully we had plenty of other food, and if we had just ordered the lamb curry this review would be very different. lol

Tonight was actually the opening night of this buffet, and a portion of the proceeds went to local animal sanctuary, One Family. The restaurant was popping, and understandably the service wasn't the greatest. Urban Turban more than made up for this with a large selection of Indian foods I've never seen or heard of. Additionally, there was live music that really set the tone for the evening.

The buffet had soups, a salad, appetizers, plenty of main course, and a few desserts. While the kitchen could have done a better job refilling the food, I get it since it was opening night of the much buzzed about vegan buffet. I went with my husband and three friends. Everyone left full and happy. Thank you Urban Turban for creating a much needed vegan buffet in Vegas!

Admittedly entering New Zealand one-off Urban Turban with mixed feelings based on the tardiness of a tablemate and previous experiences with below average Indian cuisine outside of hot spots in BC or DC it was just after 5:15 when the owner/operator stopped by the table at Urban Turban to explain the concept of 'tapas' and having already perused the menu through the assistance of Yelp pictures, as the restaurant apparently cannot update a simple website, a large order was soon crafted - our server not really offering much aside from the occasional water refill and dropping-off of plates.

Located in a small plaza off Paradise, just a minute from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino by car, Urban Turban is the sort of place one wants to like on entering, and with largely benign décor aside from the whimsical rickshaw sitting beside the hostess podium the focus seems to be on the food moreso than the scene - a wide view of a gleaming kitchen flanked by chalkboards revealing a number of Chef's working diligently on plates whose results would unfortunately prove average, at best.

Starting off with appetizers before progressing to proper plates and curries it was with a trio of free Papadum that the meal began and with the flavor mostly that of oil it was thankfully the mango chutney that made the crisp pastry far more interesting, though the green 'mint' version was flavored much like bile - overly heated, viciously acidic, and not particularly something one should strive for in any sort of cuisine.

Next served a quintet of plates that quickly covered the table it was with some confusion that I looked upon a menu item described as ""Dry Fruit Whole Wheat Bread"" and with neither fruit nor nuts evident I attest to this moment we were simply served the wrong thing, though the server assured us this was indeed the correct item.

Largely ignoring the lack of fruit and instead using the 'whole wheat' Naan to scoop up the first bites of a duo of Pav, suffice it to say that unless one is vegetarian the Lamb version shows far superior to a more traditional take that serves as little more than muddled vegetable mush meant to be served on bread and turning attention to an impressive Paneer Tikka presentation with tangy cubes amidst earthy aromatics it was a thankful circumstance that the Samosa Chat was only lightly drizzled with green chutney, thus allowing one to augment the largely flavorless pocket with the red version instead.

Investing the rest of our appetites in bottomless curries that featured excellent basmati rice and par-for-the-course buttered Naan alongside bowls containing less than two ounces of protein each, it can only be said that at prices ranging $10-$17 the better bet is to visit one of the many local Indian buffets if one is merely looking for a 'fill up' and partaking lightly in the dirty tasting Lamb Masala as well as overly sweet Buttered Chicken a bit of credit is due to the owner for suggesting the seemingly out-of-place noodles - a show stopper of well-tuned aromatics that at least gives one hope that the kitchen could improve the rest of the recipes as time goes on.

Ordering three Paan Shots that again saw the kitchen offer up something balanced and refined it was largely the lack of traditional Indian desserts that led to the final selection of Chocolate Samosas, but having experienced a similarly underwhelming dessert at Nosh & Swig just a few months prior it can only be said that this one was slightly better - the house made ice cream and melted chocolate at least helping to offset the same oily taste that had marred the papadum, though the $7.95 price tag seemed rather excessive for something so underwhelming and small.

Suggested as 'urban tapas,' and thus seeming to purport a modern take on tradition, Urban Turban really only seems to shine when sticking to simpler plates and with ingredients that really seem no better than the typical Indian Buffet in an environment that does little to wow there seems very little reason to return, let alone support another restaurant import when places like Mint seem to be satisfying locals just fine.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,19,9,2,bLJrfW9XgWjT0uSOhqJErw

5349088,2015-01-13,5,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"A solid 3.5 star from me.

My friend and I decided to dine at Urban Turban last night just to see if it was any good! Plus we haven't had Indian food in a while ... and it's new! We love trying out new places to see how they are compared to the ones we always go to! 

Urban Turban gives a very modern feel when you first enter the restaurant. The establishment is quite big, their dining area and their bar area is actually separated which is pretty nice. Though, I would've never thought that Urban Turban would be an Indian restaurant if it weren't for me seeing them on yelp and/or the writings on the walls. Everything about the establishment was modern ... like it's American. It's a nice change from the typical Indian restaurants though..

Aside from my friend and I, there was only one other party in the dining area. Therefore, the service was quite prompt and very friendly. Our server gave us suggestions on what to order and what he liked from the menu. I actually do appreciate a knowledgeable server, especially when the establishment is new. It typically means they know how to train their employees (and feed them of course) !!

We thoroughly looked at the menu...they had some classics and they had BOTTOMLESS CURRIES. You know what that means! It means unlimited curry for whoever ordered them. However, naan and rice are not included in this all you can slurp curry goodness. 

I ended up choosing their chicken tikki masala. The server gave me a little warning that their masala was tomatoe based so it is kind gravy. I was a little hesitant about that cause when they say it's tomatoe based, it tends to be on the tangy side but what the heck..I really wanted to try it. I also mentioned how I like my food spicy and the server responded with how they will take care of that. My friend, on the other hand, ordered one of their bottomless curries: himalayan chicken. 

The food came out quickly, which was nice. The chicken tikki masala did have a nice gravy texture to it, which I did like. I don't typically like my sauces very watery if I have it with rice. The sauce wasn't tangy at all even though you could taste hints of tomatoe base but it was sweet. The sweetness of it kind of threw me off. On top of it, it had a bit of a kick to it. I enjoy the level of spice they put in it...it was enough for it to make a presence but not enough for me to say spicy. 

The chicken in the curry was amazing. Every bite was tender and juicy. It was probably my favorite part of the dish. The rice was very fine .. it was a little odd because I'm eating it but it feels like I'm not eating it. I know, perhaps it's me that's odd. I do like the rice though but I had to make sure not to mix too much sauce with it. With how fine the rice is, it could easily drown in the sauce then I'd just be eating the sauce. The naan seems normal to me... 

One thing I did notice was that my friend's Himalayan chicken curry was on the watery side. I guess I'm just so used to a thicker consistency with curry that his curry was a little odd to me. Maybe that's just how it is! I'm no expert on Indian food ... so I guess you can start disregarding my whole review HAHA!

As for dessert, we both had a paan shot, which was one of the things that many reviews suggested. My friend liked the shot cause he said all he could taste was cream. However, it is definitely NOT my cup of tea. Yes, it was like a milk/cream type of drink and then it had a herbal-floral note at the end of it and that was like a huge stop sign for me. I simple cannot consume that type of flavor. I gave the rest to my friend (: 

We also got to have a few words with the general manager of the location. From what he's told us, they do make the dishes as they are ordered so you can absolutely customize the dish to your liking, such as wanting it to be more spicy. Also, their food is like Indian food for the American palette, which I suppose you could consider Urban Turban to be Indian fusion. 

I would also just like to say that our server was amazing and the service he provided was awesome. He was very friendly and very willing to start a conversation with us at any point of time. We really enjoyed our time there.

Overall, it's decent food. Interesting twist. The quality of the ingredients is definitely better than some of the other Indian restaurants that I've had. However, the price point was definitely a negative from me. The chicken tikki masala at almost $17 and the himalayan chicken curry at $18...the prices are quite steep compared to a lot of other Indian restaurants in the city. Granted, the himalayan chicken curry is bottomless but rice is not included .. most people that I know would eat curry WITH rice so you'd have to order MORE rice if you want MORE curry. On top of it all, the dishes are made with the American palette in mind ... I would honestly like something more traditional.",oqTZC9WriodTCby6jl0LfQ,9,3,3,woT3gHJQujki7fKGrrEIsw

5529186,2015-01-21,35,OPSNdO3LNPMt7qz1MNb42g,"Urban Turban is a good choice for people that don't love Indian since they have atypical offerings like flatbreads, a dish consisting of fried chicken strips, sliders, and even oysters.  It would definitely work out for the kind of people that order only California rolls at sushi joints.          

Our friendly, upbeat hostess gave us a window seat, ""for the romance"", although the outstanding view of a Toyota minivan in need of a wash and hungry CES attendees walking by didn't quite capture that feeling.  Maybe a Yelp quick tip like ""don't propose here"" is needed. 

All jokes aside, the two of us were ravenous and came specifically for their ""bottomless curry"".  We were also eating vegetarian this evening and found only 2 choices of curry disappointing.  I went with the ""Dal Tadka"" for a solid dinner price of $10, which was basically a fancy lentil soup.  It was hearty (as much as lentils can be anyway) with nice mix of curryness and heat.  Since only the curry itself was unlimited, I did my best to conserve the naan ($3 for another) and basmati rice ($5).  For $8, I would have rather tried one of their interesting looking tapas.  It also took around 5 minutes (sometimes longer) for the next bowl of curry to come out.  I could see this taking even more time when busy, so that could potentially be a problem.  I was without carbs by my fourth bowl.  The waiter also informed me that I had broken the bowl record.   

My wife got the ""Palak Paneer Masala"".  That had decent flavor, but it was too soupy for my taste.  I would have preferred a standard saag paneer at any average Indian restaurant over this.                      

Despite all this, I remain optimistic for future visits.  They have a full bar area with happy hour.  I can't think of another Indian spot that has a bar worth hanging out at.  Perhaps bringing more people and trying all the ""Bombay Bites"" would be a better way to go.

I especially loved the cute, small taxi from the 1960's that is the focal point of the restaurant.  The art on the walls also adds a creative touch.

This review is for their weekday lunch buffet.  I found the food to be decent overall with more subtle flavors than other Indian places I've eaten, but pleasant just the same. The buffet consists of 2 steam tables with the typical staples you'll find on other buffets. My only gripe is the some of the chicken in the tikka masala had really tough crusty ends which I suspect could come from it being cooked in the tandoor.  Fine for tandoori chicken, but not so much in the tikka.  The garlic butter naan was also very tasty and even requested a second basket. 

A good experience with helpful and friendly wait staff.  Noticed they also have a happy hour with some good deals; must check out.",jx7w1ztxqpRrA7pBoOfu6w,3,0,4,Kpb6Nd_MiOHkVORgT8j-vw

Many of the meat dishes here didn't taste as heavy or creamy to me as many other Indian restaurants, which I appreciated. The naan also wasn't coated in butter. I particularly enjoyed a spicy beef dish, the puff rice (great to snack on even when you're stuffed) and the tandoori chicken. 

Pro tip: make sure you check in on Yelp to get the 10% discount and also use the buy 1 get 1 half off if you're there for lunch. Normally it's about $20 per person which I don't think is really worth it given the relatively small selection of food but with all of the discounts it'll be closer to just about $10 per person!",MPpSR0KCdQie-A78X_epvA,1,1,4,GOgJ8g7O27C8LOgMHhDOXA

People have come and gone and we were still waiting. One dish finally came out and we asked about the last dish. They ACCUSED us of never ordering it. Nevertheless, they brought out the dish another 15 minutes later (in case you have lost count, from order to receiving our last dish, an hour and 30 minutes have passed). After our meal, our bill came out and I told the manager that I feel like we should not pay for the last dish as it took an hour and 30 minutes for it to come out because they forgot to enter it in the computer. He said ""well you ate it didnt you?!"" shocked, I said ""yes but we waiting a long time for it"".

The place has a separate urban bar area that is cozy and offers all kind of drinks. We had a very friendly bartender girl. She explained it was her first day at the job, but she had great personality and did really well serving and entertaining my friend and me.

The food was amazingly delicious as Mohammad had promised me. I ordered the lamb kebabs that came individually cut and stuck on a little shish topped in a shot glass with tasty sauce. The lamb was so delicious that I immediately repeated my order. We also had chicken tandoori and a number of vegetables dishes like Pav Bhaji and rice that tasted very well.

Absolutely horrible service and attitude. A very small order took forever to arrive. Asking an extra naan in the middle of the meal could not make it to the table even for another 20 min. But the time we actually finished. 

Asking the server for other status would give a blunt answer ""it's gonna take whatever it takes"". The server  didn't even bother to pause and respond. He was handling just walking. Not really crowdy so won't give him credit being too busy etc. 

At one point he actually mentioned that go and eat somewhere for faster service. 

We asked for onions that we always ask and get complimentary in any Indian restaurant. This guy said sure when we asked for it and got a full salad plate instead saying we charge for it. 

The another server sort of sensed this all and tried to help out. But it was quite late by that time.

One of the items was simply sliced onions, lettuce, and tomatoes. There are so many great Diwali dished they are missing, and the food that they made for the buffet was not very good. Some of the food was even cold. Being that I have been to India during Diwali before, I have a great idea of what Diwali is like and what the food/street food is like. This was a poor attempt to give an impression of Diwali street foods. During Diwali, there are a lot of sweet foods eaten. This restaurant did not even provide a single gulab jamun. No sweet foods at all. That is the least they could have done. There were other customers at the restaurant who were also excited to try the buffet and were shocked to see the terrible variety. This is not a ""mouth watering buffet"" as described, and it is not fair to call such, a buffet. Due to the poor selection of Diwali food, I would NEVER go back to the restaurant. I had high expectations seeing a vast amount of great reviews. If you are going to make a ""miniature selection of foods"", please do not label it as a dinner buffet as that is a misleading term, and I left to go and eat a REAL DINNER, afterwards. Also, if you are going to serve very few items, please atleast do it well. They did not even serve the basics, such as basmati rice or naan. They were also OUT OF mango chutney, another basic item.

I felt so bad for those people. I just don't understand why they couldn't bring Nan bread first, so we can have something to eat at least. We were able to see a guy in the kitchen just sitting there telling people what to do but he wasn't doing anything himself. I guess his the owner or manager?

And when we're ready to pay, the iPad actually died and we couldn't pay with our credit card. It was so bad that it was funny. All the workers seemed like they were running around with their heads cut off. We had to laugh it off.

I can tell there was so much confusion in the kitchen. I don't know who was the server, or who's the busser, or who's the manager even. I felt like I was in a live recording of kitchen nightmare, and Gordon Ramsay was going to pop out and yelling ""Everyone just stop, stop the service right now!""

The curries are well balanced, creamy and with just the right amount of kick. The garlic naan is soft and chewy. The Samosa's were gorgeous (looking) and tasted just as good as they looked. And this Lamb Sheekh Kebab was sooo flavorful. So even if it's not ""real Indian food"", it's still really good food.

First of all service was poor. No one greeted us as we entered, and we had no idea if we have to sit down by ourselves or have someone come and tell us where to go. 

Then, when the server came to our table, she didn't even ask us if we wanted any type of drink, she just gave us water. Well, we thought, oh maybe they didn't have soda or alcoholic beverages, that's fine. Until lo and behold we look around and other tables have wine or soda with them. What? Is it because we weren't wearing coat and tie formal outfits? Idk and don't even want to know. 

Then, once our orders were placed, it apparently took an hour to have our main course sent out. Did you have to get the ingredients from the grocery across town? Really? 

Well, we had the bottomless curry, we got a refill, and in less than 5 minutes, out came our fill. So... What was with the one hour wait? 

Then, when we asked for more water, our server forgot and we had to ask another server for it. 

Then, same server was asked for our bill, took her a good 10 minutes. Didn't come back to our table, so I had to personally bring the bill and payment to the cashier which gad 3 people already waiting. Wow. I wasn't the only one bugged by the service, so were provably three other customers. 

The food was good so I'm ok giving a star for that (I don't think it's possible not to give a star at all) otherwise, I'd give a negative if I could.
