25.00 for two stromboli's and horrible sides.   

Stromboli's 90 % bread and a mixture of horrible pepperoni and cheese. 

The meal includes a side and drink. The sides include either a salad, pasta or bread sticks.  All equally horrible......

Pasta is plain. Basically boiled noodles that can be bought for. 25 cents. 

Breadsticks taste processed obviously made with horrible ingredients.

I work too hard to burn money on garbage like this. I'm surprised this is still open.

Consider a Subway, Chipotle, etc.

Ask for a fork or you will end up eating plain pasta with your hands.",uzUbcJbmWOMIOPPkrBZLGQ,2,1,1,7QlJIHGi-HNwrPNm4Za_pQ

I pointed to what I wanted and the girl working pulled one of these other calzones from under the fresh looking ones, turned around threw it in the oven and dismissed me.. Umm excuse me?

It varies slightly based on which item one buys, although the pasta seems to be the best since it turns over faster.

It's a little hard to figure out what to do there since the staff doesn't explain the prices or how to order and there doesn't seem to be a menu that one can look at so one's on their own when it comes to how much one will spend and what items pair with each other in terms of pricing.

Well, in comparison to all of the other places of the food court there, it's priced better since one gets more quantity.",Z9rSlTj3pJr2eI7eqWIlZQ,0,0,3,YAHPG52ZUv544svYS7gOzQ

For the stromble, I got the pepperoni and sausage which is decent when I took a bit of the peoperoni or sasuage. Most of the time I felt like I was just eating dough.. at least the dough was soft but I'd say its on the pricier side for the small portion.
