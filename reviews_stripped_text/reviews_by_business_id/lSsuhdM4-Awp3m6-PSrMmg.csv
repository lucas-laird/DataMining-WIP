The guys are friendly and very helpful when you ask about questions on the menu. The food is delicious and the customer service outstanding. This is my new go to spot for any day of the week or weekend. The ribs are delicious!,f-azWVF0wFzET6fa4hm3nw,0,0,5,fj2aJCUR22wrrKcIRwUZ1Q

First time around got a great burger to go and was very satisfied. However when I tried to call today (5 times) I couldn't get anyone on the phone (yes it was during business hours). Like the food, owner seems really nice, but if nobody answers the phone I can't give them my business.",FSgYzaJ0CW-3ooMjKxHmbg,0,0,3,XeSgYQhfbiqFLDl_FskDZg
