1186,2011-07-13,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"While it's been nearly a year since I had a fabulous dinner at Michael Mina, I still think about the amazing meal I had.

It was my first trip to Las Vegas and my boyfriend wanted to impress. By taking me here, he definitely did as well as enjoyed the food himself.

We were recommended to try the Chef's menu and also followed it with the wine pairings. We both enjoyed the Ahi tuna tartar, LOVED the lobster pot pie, which got the pie to innards content right (I like a little breadness with each bite), and both of us were in awe of the Kobe with sear foie on top. I don't know if they still do that, but both of us just melted a little inside with each bit. It's in our top 2 of steaks...and trust me, we eat a lot of steak. I don't even remember the dessert, that's how mind blowing the steak was. I'm sure it was tasty and delightful because my dinner at Michael Mina was nothing but excellent.

Service was impeccable, and they dealt well with my constant requests for their delicious bread. The wine pairings were done well, but I was happy I was staying in the Bellagio after dinner because that was a significant amount of alcohol in one sitting. The atmosphere was elegant without pretension or ""over-styling."" Probably the most comfortable restaurant I went to in Vegas. Most people were well dressed (i.e. slacks and dresses) but no need for anything over the top. I wore a little black dress and my boyfriend wore a nice sports coat with dark slacks. While we were probably the youngest ones there, the servers didn't treat us like we didn't belong there, which sometimes happens in upscale restaurants. Big plus for that.

I'd love to go back, but this time, I'd probably order something different just so I could try other things...but I'd get the Kobe again. For sure.

It's worth the pennies to go, and try the chef's menu!",1cd1TjQEynOjhBT-3Qnsjg,0,0,5,AN7nMubhX-Zv0CeUb5Qm-A

Went here to celebrate my birthday and I knew I was going to be tough to please, as I've been to the original Aqua and Michael Mina in San Francisco numerous times.  I was dreaming of some of his classic dishes like the tuna tartare and lobster pot pie, so opted for The Cookbook Tasting Menu while the BF chose The Seasonal Tasting Menu.  Some dishes were spot on while others were good but not 'wow'.  The dining room was not as elegant as I expected, but service was good and the price was reasonable for Vegas standards.

80581,2012-06-18,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"One of my favorite dining experiences. Ever. For so many reasons. 

Well, the night started out in Vegas with my parents and sister. We came for a weekend of shows, gambling, and tasty food. The plan was to hit up Michael Mina, then to Cirque du Soleil's ""O"" in the Bellagio. On our way to the restaurant, as we walked by the Bellagio fountains, my boyfriend popped out of nowhere and proposed to me. Apparently this was all planned by my co-conspiring family members. 

After many tears and my dad acting like paparazzi, we headed to the restaurant. I have been vegetarian for many years, so my fiance and family decided Michael Mina would be a great restaurant since they have a vegetarian tasting menu. They were SOOO right!

The waitress was super nice, and after we told her that we had just gotten engaged she brought us the champagne list. Obviously. My parents ordered champagne and we had a toast. After we finished the bottle, our waitress brought us the label on a card in a little Michael Mina envelope. We thought that was such a special, thoughtful touch... definitely going in the wedding scrapbook. 

OK, now onto the food. We all ordered the tasting menu--everyone else ordered the regular, and I got the vegetarian. To start it was the heirloom beet salad with burrata cheese. A very small plate but a great starter. Next it was the best course--the fennel tortellini. SO amazing, made with fennel and citrus brown butter. Next was the Japanese tasting, with rice, crispy tofu, glazed baby bok choy. Ohhhh boy do I love me some Japanese food. Especially tofu done RIGHT. Overall I loved the menu--perfect portion sizes, wonderful flavors. I was also just generally giddy because of the engagement PLUS the vegetarian tasting menu. On a weekend vacation in Vegas with my family and fiance. Pretty much all my dreams in one. 

For dessert, they brought out the tasting desserts. Apple cider, brownie, and chocolate bon bons. But the best part of all was the mini root beer floats with sassafrass ice cream. YUM! and so fun. Tasting menus are always fun because you can try so many things without getting completely stuffed. 

All in all, loved the food, the service, and the ambiance. A truly wonderful restaurant for a special night. Plus, it is close to ""O"" if you are going to that show, which is absolutely mind-blowing. Thanks to Michael Mina for making a special night even better :)",AEbLxmYYwKh7TI4x6q9obA,0,1,5,4AoVCKGN1gsQOi_iRkcn2A
86331,2017-05-16,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Food was still good but service was having an off night.  This was our third time at MM in the Bellagio.  Service was having an off night.  Two shattered glasses off in the distance.  A wrong dish being ordered and deliverd to the table beside us.  My tuna tartare was launched from my plate onto the tablecloth (not once but twice) while the server mixed it for me.  This resulted in a dirty tablecloth which they just put a napkin over (really romantic eating on a napkin) and also resulted in me losing some of my app that went off the plate.  Then a martini was spilled on another gentleman at a neighbouring table.

Now all of this happened in my little area, one could only imagine what the whole restaurant was going through.  Manager seemed interested in the man with the martini spilled on him but not even a glance my way or check in at all with myself or the other diners.  Big Fail.

Third time was not the charm, but definately the last.  Mainly due to management.  Food is food and only goes so far, its the service and management that make people feel appreciated.",Xo99Z-shvqVAijcrQjr_Sg,0,0,3,losoSFtsWWI8Sdq6XPEyTg

Many of us chose a 6-course tasting menu featuring many of the items on the a la carte menu.  Each course was memorable. There were combinations of items and seasonings that created wonderful tastes I've never experienced before!  The lower mark for service is directed at the kitchen, which left a 30 minute gap between course 3 and 4.  It affected the mood of the table and took us out of our conversation. Otherwise the waitstaff was very attentive and helpful. This is the most expensive restaurant I go to in Vegas, but it is also the best!",Pp0Iqg4b4TDHah96QPTDFA,1,0,5,YejAKUI7LyqrzRdHlUmLSQ
169312,2007-08-23,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,I have been eating at Michael Mina when it was Aqua. In addition to having eaten at Michael Mina Las Vegas I have eaten at Michael Mina San Francisco at the Westin St. Francis and Aqua in San Francisco. The Las Vegas branch is consistently good (having had about twenty dinners) but the San Francisco branch is consistently better. Located in the Bellagio it is a quite nicely decorated and most of the service staff and management has been working since it opened in the Bellagio many years ago. Keep in mind the style is French although it is considered a Seafood restaurant. Most of the diners are thirty and up and it isn't a casual restaurant. You also may find that tables are fairly close similar to a bistro. Extensive wine list. Reservations are highly recommended.

175732,2011-04-27,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"My husband and I went here before ""O"" from Cirque du Soleil and had the pre-theatre menu with some supplements.  We had:

Ahi tuna tartare - wicked tasty!  Best part of the meal!
Baked potato soup and grilled cheese - also wicked tasty!  My husband's favorite course as well
Lobster pot pie - My husband liked it a lot, but it was too much food.  He got full really fast and it just got to the point where he was just eating lobster to eat the rest of the lobster on his plate!
Phyllo-crusted sole - Excellent!  I liked all the parts separately and for the most part they went together, but sometimes I would screw it up and it wouldn't taste as good as it should!
Root beer float - Tasty, but way too big!  The choc chip cookies were quite good!
Brownie - Very tasty!  Small portion, but perfect for doing a tasting-type menu.

Overall we really liked MM, but we were very full by the end, so if the portions were even a bit smaller we would have probably been happier.  Overall, the appetizers overshined the entrees for us, but maybe we just haven't found our signature entrees there yet :)

Additionally, the service was amazing and it was great having the waiters explain what you are eating before you dig in.  The presentation was immaculate.  Oh, and this was our first experience with wine pairings and I must say.... we've been missing out!  These were AMAZING!

184629,2014-04-30,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Last weekend we had the signature tasting with wine parings and it was simply amazing.  From the sea bass, to the ahi tartar, to the lobster, the steak, and foie gras, it was all very well done.  The ahi tartar was absolutely amazing, and I'm not one to love tartars.  The caviar was so fresh they must have had the fish in the back room.

The sommelier chose the wine parings extremely well for each course.  If your eating here don't pass on the opportunity for such expert advice, trust me.  Just be cautious of the amount of wine and liquor they bring you if your a lightweight.  I'm not a lightweight and things got a little fuzzy towards the end.

Although the food was to die for that's only 1/2 of the experience.  Service must be up to snuff.  Growing up and formerly working in Las Vegas I have very high expectations for service and have seen a steep decline in the level of service in Vegas the last several years.  I can tell you that trend has not made it to Michal Mina's restaurants.  I've been to a few and every one, including his namesake restaurant, have superb service.  Friendly, accommodating, entertaining, and competent.  I really couldn't have asked for a better staff.

Instead they just put extra food on the plate instead of really asking us what the issue was(food was just bad quality). The straw that broke the camels back was the dessert course.

My boyfriend and I rounded out my culinary birthday weekend here - so we were really not capable of doing a whole tasting menu.  As soon as our server realized that, his level of attentiveness dropped dramatically.  He did not pay attention to empty wine glasses, and rarely stopped by.  All in all, the service was just ""off.""
The foie gras trio was spectacular, as was the beef trio.  My sea bass was also delicious.  The show stopper of the night was definitely dessert - that darn rootbeer float is just amazing.  The food was absolutely delicious all in all, and I was glad we decided to try MM.
The 3 stars are due mainly to the service (or lack thereof).  The food was excellent - but I expect more from a server than cursory glances from across the room.

249762,2010-02-22,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Frankly, the meal we had at Michael Mina was the least enjoyable of our weekend in Las Vegas for the following reasons:
 
1.  The entire meal was extremely rushed (we'd finish one course and the other would be placed as the prior dishes were being collected) -- no time to reflect, digest and enjoy the food;
2.  The chocolate cake dessert was terrible; dry, tasteless and reminded us of a lower-end dessert buffet offering; and
3.  The manager on duty listened to our complaint but quickly dismissed us by saying ""some patrons prefer a quick meal"" (note we NEVER indicated that we were in a hurry, no one asked and every table near us had the same quick service).
 
We were two couples traveling from San Francisco and often enjoy the array of fine dining options at home. We had heard so many wonderful things about Michael Mina that we made a reservation and cancelled another highly recommended one for the same evening. Bottom line; the entrees we chose were good, the soup was good, the salad was average, the root beer float very good, and the chocolate cake was horrible (3 of us had this and same opinion). The rushed atmosphere, mediocre food quality and then lack of customer service at the end has ensured we won't patron this restaurant again nor recommend it. What a dissappointment!

I also sent an email to the manager and received a form response of sorry that your experience wasn't better and let him know when we'd be dining with them again (so they could make the experience better). We have received far superior customer service from chain restaurants than this establishment. There are so many good food options out there that are far more worthwhile than Michael Mina.",ZoE2lm0j5rOp0WqIFoX35w,0,0,2,IrKKhPByIfJjaAyqn5Ufmw
251198,2008-08-04,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"I thought to myself - this will either totally live up the Bellagio's greatness, or it will be a very pricey mistake. 

Michael Mina was outstanding.  The decor is under stated and warm: high ceilings, caramel hued wood accents, white table clothes and simple, delicate bud vases with pink mini calla lilies.  

George and I both had the seasonal 5 course tasting menu with sommelier  wine pairings.  Three out of the five dishes were outstanding - and the other two were nearly as good.  The amuse the mouth (or whatever, sadly, I'm not great remembering even the most basic and important French culinary terms) was a cold fingerling potato with a piece of smokey pancietta and a weird green sauce.   Good, but I've had better.  The first course was a delicious sashimi course with coconut, mango and red onions that was flavored lightly with sea salt.  It was a very good dish, and went well with the Vueve they served it with, but wasn't AMAZING.  Just a nice way to begin a decadent meal.

The second course was lump crab meat soup with sweet white corn and shaved fennel.  All of the ingredients were delicate and high quality, but they put this ""broth"" over it to make it into soup that was way to damn salty.  George pointed out that it must have been to make it taste like the sea - but I found that it overpowered the crab, etc.

The third course was outstanding - a filet of sockeye salmon that was cooked PERFECTLY (I'm not normally a big salmon fan) with a crispy skin but tender, bright red-salmon flesh.  It was outstanding, hands down.

The forth dish was leg of lamb.  It was also amazing, although by this time I was feeling the four glasses of wine and can't recall how it was prepared.  

Desert was a gorgeous arrangement of mission figs with black pepper vanilla gelato, mission fig compote and a square of simple bread pudding.  YUM!  

The service could have been better.  Our main waiter at one point made a joke at one of the server's Chinese accent that I found rude and in bad taste.  I loathe racially charged humor (unless it's good natured between good friends) and I loathe humor at other people's expense, so that docked him a bit in my mind.  Also we asked for a print out of what we ate and the wine pairings, and he never brought it to us.

272095,2016-01-17,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"For a special treat we tried Michael Mina.  We surprisingly were able to get reservations the same afternoon at 5:00 pm when it opened.  We were immediately seated by a window seat that we had requested.

Atmosphere is nice, service was very good to excellent. Waiter was friendly and reassured us that he would try to have us out in time to attend a show. When I asked what was a particular garnish, he went and re-checked with the kitchen to be sure.  

We had the three course pre-theater menu ($68).  Both my friend and I were looking forward to the butternut squash soup that was on the menu (as well as on line).  Unfortunately, the waiter did not mention that they did not have it until we were ordering.  We had the alternative soup that was not listed which was a celery heart soup with a small crab cake in the center of the soup.  It didn't  sound as appealing to me but it was excellent!  Presentation of the soup was very nice with two waiters pouring the soup at the table from two small individual containers.  I would order it again!

I had the fresh sour dough bread .  My friend and I were surprised that there was not a glutton free alternative.  Something else small should have been offered to my friend to nibble on, especially as I was eating my bread and she just sat there waiting for the soup to arrive.  I was surprised that the bread waiter did not come back to offer a second bread or replenish the butter.

We both ordered the sea bass.  My friend loved her dish!   I often cook broiled sea bass so I was surprised that the sea bass came in a light Asian broth sort of like steamed Chinese fish but much better (my mistake for not reading the menu more closely). The portion of sea bass was plentiful.  There were Chinese dried black mushroom slices, Bok Choy and a tiny won ton dumpling in the broth.  The sea bass was placed upon a bed of slivered jicama.   Won ton  wrapper was sort of undercooked and the filling needed more flavoring.  Broth was flavorful.  Sea bass was tender and seasoning on top was tasty.  Bok Choy was slightly over cooked to my liking ( I eat a lot of Asian food!). . Slice of black mushroom was salty but this might have been a sprinkling of seasoning intended for the fish.  Overall the dish was a blend of salty and mostly mild tastes

Dessert was excellent!! I had the rootbeer float with chocolate pecan cookies.  Sooo good!  Cookies were warm, crispy outside with soft middle.   Root beer was well balanced with the delicious ice cream.   My friend had the vanilla Ice cream.  (Since she is glutton free she replaced  a tart with 2nd scoop of ice cream). Ice cream was refreshing with a clean vanilla flavor.

We were celebrating my friend's birthday so they brought out a plate with ""happy birthday"" written on it, a candle and four small chocolate balls.   Very nice touch!  

Best not to rush this type of dining experience.  Be sure to allow yourself at least two hours to enjoy the meal in a leisurely fashion.  (Our mistake!)

The lobster pot pie and the main courses, filo crusted cod and duck, had a fantastic blends of flavor and textures. I'm not sure what Mina was thinking with the foie gras rice side dish though. To me, the black rice used pretty much destroys the flavor of the foie mousse that is stirred in. I was actually hoping for more of a foie risotto like thing when I saw this dish on the menu.

The restaurant is noisy and the table where we were seated made it hard to hear each other across the table. Our waiter was attentive and answered questions we had.

My husband almost flagged her down to ask her to photograph us since we were celebrating our anniversary and a photo would be nice memorabilia--but we didn't. The tuna appetizer was AMAZING and the presentation/preparation was a great touch. When presented with our main dishes, my husband ordered the Lobster Pot Pie and when the waiter was plating it and scoped into the pot, he mumbled something under his breath and excused himself as he rolled the cart and dish away. He came back to the table to tell us that he sent it back to the chef for a ""few extra minutes"".  I let my food sit on the table--as I waited for my husbands dish to return from the kitchen. The waiter eventually rolled his cart back and plated the remaining of the dish. There were no apologies given and a new/fresh dish wasn't presented--which was awkward--especially for an $85 plate.

The service was great, very quick and responsive.

For the most part the food was good, but it just felt, as some other reviewers suggested, as if something was off.  

I ordered the Butter-Poached Lobster app, and the Lobster itself was the best I've ever tasted - very very tender and delicious.  However, the sweet potato crepe it was to be served with was so small as to be invisible under the piece of lobster tail I was served.  Upon excavation I found that a rim of my crepe was black.  It seemed a very juvenile mistake to try to cover up. Why not just make a new crepe? Especially for the $28 I paid for the thing.  Also, the thai coconut cream it was served with was rather ordinary.  

My sweetie's Foie Gras trio was to die for, and I regretted not ordering it after that crepe disappointment.  

I met the arrival of my Japanese snapper trio with some suspicion, but it turned out to be quite delicious, as well as my sweetie's lamb trio.

At this point in the meal I was still feeling disappointed, but the dessert turned that right around.  

The Root Beer Float was to die for.  The attention to detail was fabulous,  and I think they even accounted for the fact that my sweetie and I were sharing as it included two chocolate straws and two gigantic walnut choco chip cookies (some of the best I've tasted - perfect texture)  

Just another word about the prices - Wow! Very Expensive.  I'm not afraid to spend money on food, but it seemed the prices were very high. Especially the prices on the wine list - very very inflated.   I don't know if it was because of the inclusion in the Bellagio hotel or just an inflated sense of self-importance on the managment's part, but the price just didn't seem to fit the overall experience.

The kitchen opens up to the restaurant, so you get a little behind-the-scenes action, which also brings the fancy-factor down a bit.

We had the Cookbook Tasting Menu, which is a selection of Michael Mina's best-loved dishes.  My favorite course was our first, the tuna tartare.  It was light and fresh, with pine nuts adding a nice crunch and pears that balanced the spicy flavor.

I thought the lobster pot pie would be my fave, but it was a little too hot and a bit awkward to eat.  Each course was quite nice but of course, dessert was the absolute best.  It was a trio of desserts - a coconut s'more with homemade marshmallow, opera cake topped with bittersweet ice cream (yum) and a mini root beer float.  The root beer float was AMAZING!

With lots of restaurants to choose from, the fact that Michael Mina has a Vegetarian Tasting menu sealed the deal for us.  Although I eat fish, I prefer to eat vegetarian when I can, so I was excited to see what was in store.  

We'd never been inside the Bellagio before and it was very pretty with all the flowers, Chiluly art (I think it was Chiluly) and the merry-go-round.  Michael Mina was located in the back corner, perfect for taking pre-dinner pictures.  I am especially good at taking pictures of myself.  Some might call it self-absorbed, I call it good photographic skills. I digress.

We had a 7:30 reservation but got there at 7 and asked to be seated early.  Since it was a Tuesday, we had no problems with that.  We were seated at a table and immediately brought out some bread and salted butter.   After choosing a bottle of sauvignon blanc (the cheapest one on the menu. what? dinner here was expensive, gotta cut costs somewhere), we ordered our tasting menus.  The vegetarian for me, the regular for my husband.  After finding out that I do eat fish, the waiter told me that the regular tasting menu was better and they could do fish instead of steak, but I really wanted to try the veggie.  

My meal started out with a beet salad that was tasty.  Next was a fennel ravioli and finally some sort of tempura tofu dish.  I have to say, I liked the main course, the tofu, the least.  Too fried.  The regular tasting menu had tuna tartar, lobster pot pie and steak.  The steak was tiny.  I know it's a tasting, but I literally laughed out loud when I saw the three small pieces of steak that my husband was served.  He liked it though and I guess that pot pie was filling.

The best part was dessert.  We were each given a sampler of five different desserts including a delicious root beer float that was my absolute favorite.

My client and I were just amazed at not only the flavors, but the artestry and impeccable service. 

Sadly I also had to bring two other knuckleheads with me who made faces like a kid eating broccoli when attempting to get them to try the divine foie gras duo. The mousse was so melt in your mouth it almost could have been dessert. 

The salsify soup was a beautiful blend of flavors I would have never thought would go. Chestnut with the oysters? Really?

My client and I both did the Phylo crusted Sole which was... just amazing. Melt in your mouth, flakey, generous fillet. Great accoutrements on the plate with the potatoes, etc. 

Also did the brussels (fantastically char-grilled) and the mushroom faro for some nice earthy balanced sides. 

And then...the dessert sampler and the panna cotta. I mean...I am NOT a dessert guy but wow. They literally make their own candy bar and then the mousse and peanut butter parfait cup is like a high end reeses on steroids. But what really did it for me was the panna cotta. Oh man...the passionfruit panna cotta was just ridiculous. Such amazingly clean flavors. So crisp in a panna cotta which is so hard to do....

Husband's 2nd course was the lobster pot pie, their signature dish, generous portion but alas the lobster tail was tough and over cooked, he chewed and chewed and chewed each bite, rendering conversation difficult.. Meanwhile my 2nd course consisted of four tiny tortellini swimming in an sea of over powering, sweet red pepper sauce.  I dissected them in half but still ate them in a blink while he continued masticating the rubbery lobster.  His 3rd course was kobe beef....again, tough and chewy!  My third course was a discordant, Japanese inspired hodgepodge...a spoonful of sticky rice, two baby bok choy, a round of daikon, two battered mushrooms and a bowl of vinegary sauce...each item was well prepared, but still a dish that would have been disappointing at 1/4 of the price.

We actually found the place a bit hard to find - at the time, there was this huge Thanksgiving display right in front of Michael Mina that totally made us miss it on our first pass around that little atrium space. In any case, we eventually got in and were seated at a nice little corner table in front of the wine rack at the back. 

We both decided to do the tasting menus (surprise!) - as usual, I got the vegetarian version. For a seafood restaurant, I was really, really, really impressed at how good the vegetarian menu was. A butternut squash soup with little pieces of apple garnish came out - and I would have licked that bowl clean if it wasn't a fancy restaurant. And I don't even like butternut squash soup (or squash in any other form, for that matter)! Very good dish. The other memorable dish that came out for me was a mindblowing artichoke souffle - perfectly executed and definitely left me wishing their ramekins were a tad larger. Maybe a LOT larger. For my date, I think her most memorable dish was a lobster pot pie, which she still raves about. 

Dessert was definitely disappointing. A trio (as is Michael Mina's general style) came out but was distinctly unmemorable. 

I was taking my date out for her birthday, and had called in advance to let the maitre'd know about it. However, they seem to have botched it a little at the restaurant - while we did have a dessert course, they failed to bring anything out with a candle on it, which would have just been a nice touch. Instead, the maitre'd, who was really very welcoming in an instantly likeable way, wished my date a happy birthday and inquired as to what our plans for the rest of the night were. It's the small touches that make the difference, people. 

So the next time you're in Vegas and looking for a great dinner experience, hit up Michael Mina. It's a bit pricey but well worth the money.",yiK_9m_3sQscRQr-QgYVGg,0,0,4,iZSb0nXyUanba0N6E7utTA

Starting out with some fruity champagne was excellent. Another dinner at a business trip and it was AMAZING and our server was the best one there. He knew everything on the menu, what foods were good and what it tasted like, what wine goes well with each food and how to describe each texture of the food on the plate itself. I decided to go with the tasting menu and here is what I had. I actually had to catch a flight that night so they paid extra attention to get my food out faster while still making it taste wonderful.

First plate was the Tuna Tartare; presentation was beautiful.The quail egg on top of the tartare with chile powder and pine nuts and oil. Our server mixed up the food for us and it was one of the best plates. We could taste the spices and the tuna was goooood with the bread pieces on the side.

Second plate is the lobster pot pie. To me, the tasting menu portion is perfect because the soup inside is delicious and there is actual pieces of lobster that you can taste. But anymore of the dense soup inside the pie, I probably would have gotten tired of it.  There were some carrots and potato BUT hands down best pie I ever had. 

Third plate was the wagyu ribeye. This was mediocre because the meat was fairly seasoned... although it was cooked perfectly to my taste it was not anything special to my taste buds.

Last plate was the dessert and it was crazyyyyyyyy goood. There was gelato in with some orange soda, a delicious cookie and vanilla brioche with raspberry sorbetto, brown wafer with cream and he even gave me a refresher soda with some grapefruit pieces. AHHH!!

Awesome customer service, waiter was awesome, great food, and I was able to get to my flight on time. I am definitely coming here again, but not sure if SF will top the service that LV provided for me.",mn8VZC3jAR_gB9HRVlTPlw,11,3,5,NPHMGAwc3XoKkvQ_E3O_Nw

As a guest at the Bellagio, I was rather excited to taste the so recommended menu. I was delighted with the staff and the service but absolutely disappointed with thr quality of the food. I must say that the dinner at Michael Mina's restaurant could be considered as the most discouraging experience I have had. As I am vegan, my choices were limited but the waiter was helpful enough to recommend the tofu and the soup. As I have previously lived in the region of the truffle in Italy I am highly sensitive to its unique flavour. However, there was no sign of the truffle's distinct fragnance in my butternutsquash soup which in addition was oversalted. Moreover, the following dish, the tofu with mushrooms and risotto was extremely greasy and salted to which my sensitive stomach did not react well. 
As I only eat out I have certainly tried plenty of different restaurants and must say that Michael Mina's one is without a doubt the most disappointing one. I would most defintely advise against it.",r4wrZrjbViB7P7TrFw0ABw,2,0,1,0E37-bdxRyvgilsda-3Yqg

713026,2015-03-02,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Visited Michael Mina's recently while in Vegas celebrating my husband's birthday and really did love it. We had enjoyed our meal at another restaurant of his which is now closed and decided to give this one a try. My husband and I definitely enjoyed our meal this time around but not quite enough to give it 5 stars. 

The service was excellent and most of the food was really wonderful. The staff did a superb job as you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber. We were seated right off the (pretty empty) main dinning area in an (almost empty) small room right near the restrooms. It seemed a bit odd but assumed it was because I requested a view of the fountains when I made the reservation after reading other reviews. We were also seated right next to a table of 4 and 2 of the guests were small children (under age 6) who thankfully ended up being very well behaved for kids. We were seated by the window and after the host left I noticed that there was a fountain that we looked out over but it was not functioning so the view was just okay. But...we were there for the food, so I decided to look beyond these things. 

The bread served upon our arrival was really nice. My husband and I each ordered the 3 course meal with the Lobster Pot Pie as our main dish (this is what we had come for). 

We both started with the short rib ravioli appetizer which was amazing. I would get this again and highly recommend it. 

Next out came our lobster pot pies. The pot pie was delicious, the flavor of the veggies, crust and gravy inside was wonderful but I agree with other reviewers that the lobster was a tad over cooked. It was just a bit tough this time around- bummer! We had enjoyed this dish at his other restaurant years ago and it is what brought us here. Because we ordered the 3 course meal we anticipated the lobster pot pie being just a bit on the smaller side. It ended up being the regular size and we were both served from a good sized copper pot. Beautiful, and a hearty meal for sure. (We had, during our previous visit, shared one of these pot pies along with appetizers and it had been cooked perfectly and was the perfect amount for us.) Knowing we were each about to receive a pot pie that size, after the appetizer, with dessert still coming we were a bit overwhelmed but enjoyed it nonetheless. If you are used to eating very large meals you might do okay but it was a lot for us. Better to leave full than hungry for certain but in retrospect my husband should have ordered one of the 3 course meals and we should have asked to share the pot pie and I should have just ordered an appetizer, dessert, and small side salad. That may just be us though! 

After we ate our mostly yummy pot pies the dessert came out. We had both ordered the Apple Crostini (I think it was) and for us this was a mistake. It was not very good in our opinion. We both wished we had ordered something else. 

We are ""foodies"" and really enjoy trying new restaurants, eating great food, and look forward to going back if we absolutely love a spot. The short rib ravioli would definitely draw us in again some day and I might give the lobster pot pie another shot in the future but next time I think I think my vote might be to try somewhere else.",LoZfieRzz-G7xT4yHypgCw,0,0,4,kfsmZMX-amz6uvAojwpnGQ

Well what I thought would be a bad experience turned turned out good based on the service the waiter gave us. We had ordered a bottle of wine and when it was finished he asked if we wanted to order another, we said no but her showed up with a bottle of red wine and said it was on him.

Upon seated by a window with a view of the Bellagio pool, our server laid napkins on our laps and explained to us the menu options. We spent a bit of time looking through the wine list and the menu options. We both decided on the pre-theater menu $59/person for appetizer, entree and dessert. 

We ordered: Potato & Root Vegetable Chowder, Brioche-Crusted Florida Pompano (white fish similar to halibut), and the Maine Lobster Pot Pie, Michael's Root Beer Float served with warm chocolate chip nut cookies, and the seasonal fruit tart (fig over a hazelnut streusel with spiced ice cream). We had wine pairing with one of the meals. 

A man was walking around with a bread basket full of different choices of bread - the honey wheat and the sourdough was amazing. It came hot and toasty with just enough to dip into the chowder. The chowder was amazing - not too heavy even though it's a creamy soup. The chunks of potato combined with the smoked ham gave this soup a great texture and flavor. 

The main course was even better than expected. I had the Maine Lobster Pot Pie which came out in the pot it was baked. The server took the crust off the top and laid on the plate followed by re-assembling the pieces of the lobster in order. It's a full lobster. The color of the shell is a beautiful deep orangey-red color. You have the option of having it served without the shell. Then the server spoons out the veggies and mushrooms and drenches the whole plate in a fragrant sauce. My hubby had the pompano which was a tender fish over a bed of cauliflower which was less extravagant then my dish so I shared mine. I love lobster but couldn't finish my entree due to the amount of lobster and the richnes of the sauce. 

Dessert was good - I liked the balance of flavors from the citrus salt and the sweetness of the fig. The ice cream cleansed the palette and was refreshing. The root beer float was also good and had just enough sweetness. I couldn't finish the cookies or the small plate of chef's miniature desserts (coconut macaroons, chocolate cookies, one other type of cookie). We had to pack it up to go. 

Overall, I like the atmosphere with very attentive wait staff. One waiter kept bringing me iced tea every time I was low. They were generous with the wine.

They did give him a sampling of the premium wine pairing, in which he wouldn't stop talking about this white burgundy, like he was going to take it home or something ; )

The restaurant was much brighter than most of the restaurants we have been to in Vegas.  Service was spot on, and our table was very nice and private.

Thankfully that was not the case with Michael Mina. One of my friends ordered the tasting menu while the rest of us ordered a la carte. Tip: if you want to try the the lobster pot pie ($85) you might as well order the five-course tasting menu ($115).

I ordered the following:
- Fluke crudo - The yuzu dressing and hearts of palm blended wonderfully with the fluke. I only wish that they gave you more than 5 pieces!
- Diver scallops - The scallops were tender and flavorful, but the best part of this dish was actually the two oysters. They were creamy and delicious and sat in a butter sauce that complemented the scallops nicely.
- Passion fruit panna cotta - The panna cotta was a bit of a letdown. It was too sweet for my tastes.

I also tried some of my friend's tuna tartare, which was mixed with quail egg. It was delicious! 

I was impressed with the service. Everyone was incredibly friendly and attentive - the sommelier even came over to describe the landscape of the vineyard we had ordered a bottle of riesling from in elaborate detail. The waiter was also able to gracefully satisfy my friend's request for a drink that was ""manly, but pink in color"" with a dark pink bourbon drink.",IJteUJ9XrDAr3w4PRWNzFw,0,0,4,bL4cPcvO9OtZEZZNfwHsfQ

Got the signature tasting menu. The only things that were good were the caviar amuse bouche (OH HEY guess what? a course they don't make but buy from other suppliers! No wonder it tasted good) and the seabass. 
What was most disappointing to me was that they completely ruined the foie gras course. It was WAY overcooked and bland. SOOO bland. Never had bad foie gras in Vegas before until now. The kobe beef was also very hard to chew and just not top notch quality. Lobster pot pie was also bland and not very good.

The restaurant staff made it seem higher echelon than what it probably is without being too uppity. The server was very well versed in the menu and ingredients and explained in detail the dishes and was spot on with what the dishes tasted like.

The Grgich Hills 1996 Cab was excellent. Held up very nicely through the entire time we were there without diminishing structure. We didn't use the sommelier in the choice but our choice was confirmed by the server as a good one. By the way, the service was very good throughout the night and they kept the table nice and clean. Even more so than Jean Georges.

I had the 5 cookbook tasting menu of Michael Mina's signature dishes. Everything was good except the sesame oil in the tuna tartare. More later on that.

It started off with an excellent Osetra Caviar Parfait. The nicely crisp, warmed potato cake on the bottom and cool caviar on top nicely meshed in the mouth.

Next was the Tartare of Ahi Tuna. I've had this dish at numerous places in CA because they basically have it everywhere but usually the sesame oil overwhelms you on the first bite. This one did not. The sesame oil was much more delicate as would be expected so the first bite surprised me. However, that was the end of that. By the 3rd or 4th bite, the sesame oil took over and never let go for the rest of the night. Thankfully it didn't completely ruin the rest of the meal but it did the rest of my night...

Next was the Maine Lobster Pot Pie which is supposedly the best dish on the menu. I have to admit the pot pie crust I did like but for some reason I wasn't all that impressed with the dish. A little too rich maybe? Not saying it was bad, but just not really good.

The American Kobe Dry Aged Ribeye followed and was good but not great as you would expect from American Kobe beef. It's not the real thing and even Japanese Kobe Beef isn't the best by far in Japan. They do good marketing though. The tomato stuffed with short rib balanced out the dish well. I would normally think ""meat with meat on the same dish?"" but for some reason it worked.

Lastly, the desserts were very good. I particularly liked the root beer float which had some nice complexity to it with the herbs and also the coconut macaroon which was part of an added dessert not included in the tasting menu. Also, I don't like marshmallows at all, but the coconut s'more was actually pretty good. The marshmallow wasn't the mushy, super-sweet stuff that you normally associate with marshmallows and was firm and not overly sweet.

However, we ordered a strawberry dish in addition that was light and refreshing. By far the star of all the desserts as the server did claim beforehand.

Even the biscotti that came with my double americano was a nice surprise as well.

All in all a very enjoyable meal and a better experience than Jean Georges which I went to the previous week. Next time I'll forego the tuna tartare though. It stuck with me for hours... Ick.

I would actually rate this as 4.5 stars but gave it 4 stars because I'm saving a 5 star rating for something in America to be on par with 4 star restaurants in other countries.",CnpxcfXRD4vhiZN7z2ISsA,0,0,4,E8ngHGtA0sXkXDu3CYC-MQ

The salmon was not cooked all the way as if it was frozen and not thawed out, the ahi tuna was super salty and the sea bass was overcooked and definitely did not taste good. 

In addition to the awful tasting food, the portions were super small. The ahi tuna dish goes for $58.00. You would expect to see more than 3 small chunks of tuna placed on simply what I call a small piece of hash-brown that tasted awful and a few mushrooms and a little spinach. 

The restaurant didn't have much of an ambience. Too simple, too plane, and boring. 

Besides that, I guess the 1 star I am giving is for the service which was not bad.

992428,2010-09-04,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"We chose Michael Mina as our fourth Restaurant Week 2010 meal. We had a 7 o'clock reservation. We were seated in the farthest corner of the restaurant, there is a small room next to the main dining room, we were in there. It was peaceful, you'd never guess you were a couple hundred feet from the craziness in the Conservatory.

We were started with an amuse-bouche of watermelon topped with red onion, feta and balsamic vinegar. It was clean and refreshing.

Then, we were offered breads: Italian and sourdough, both were warm and fresh. I preferred the Italian. After noshing on breads, we were brought our appetizers. My husband had bibb lettuce salad with Maytag Blue Cheese, Summer Corn, Bacon, Red Wine Vinaigrette. It was fresh and delicious, the vinaigrette was fantastic. I had the Heirloom Tomatoes Gazpacho with Spiced Crab Salad, Avocado, Summer Herbs. It was like biting into a fresh tomato only I was slurping it off a spoon. Yum. The crab salad was excellent, too.

When it came to the entree I was torn, I planned to order the halibut which sounded fantastic, but the Lobster Pot Pie that Michael Mina is famous for was included on the Restaurant Week menu for a $30 supplement. Regular price for this dish is $78, this meant I'd get it plus a starter and dessert for $80.10. It sounds like a no brainer, but I've never been a fan of lobster. I tend to find the chewy texture off-putting, but on the other hand there was no better place for me to try it. My husband left it to the fate of eenie meenie miney mo and the winner was the lobster pot pie. I did not regret it. It was superb. I prefer the lobster claw to the rest of it, but overall it was very tasty. The brandied cream sauce was lush and velvety. It's really a beautifully composed dish, I'm happy I experienced it. 

My husband ordered a filet that was splendidly prepared it was one of the tastiest I've had in quite sometime, it was served with a short rib cottage pie, like shepards pie, with short rib, carmelized onions and whipped mashed potatoes. It was warm and comforting, not too mention delicious.

By some miracle we still had room for dessert. He had Michael's Root Beer Float with Sassafras Ice Cream, Root Beer Sorbet, and Warm Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies. The float was pretty good, but the cookies, oh! the sweet heavenly cookies were the star. They would've been perfect served with a glass of cold milk for dipping. I had the Summer Blackberries over Caramelized Brioche and Cinnamon Toast Ice Cream. Eh, it wasn't very special. Neither the brioche or ice cream were a success. Thankfully, I have a dear husband who kindly shared his heavenly cookies.

After dinner, the manager came by to check on us. We chatted a bit, mainly gushing how much we love Michael Mina's restaurants. He returned and poured us each a glass of a nice dessert wine. I don't recall what it was, but it was not cloyingly sweet like most dessert wines. We both really enjoyed it. Then, finally to end the meal our server delivered a plate of small treats with the check. The coconut macaroons and shortbread cookies were simply wonderful, as was the entire meal. The food, the service, it was all excellent. After three no-so=great meals, Michael Mina saved Restaurant Week.",ZsUSGU1-L1ImomLZjXxxTg,4,2,4,1rMIxCfFQV6-K8Zz4sZRSg

The bf and I made late night dinner reservations on the same day.  We arrived the Bellagio Hotel and saw the restaurant just as we walked through the doors.  The hostess said we are on time and if we would like to have a cocktail while we waited.  I had The Gentleman which was quite a delicious drink.

Shortly after receiving our drinks, the hostess escorted us to our table.  She carried our drinks to the table, which I found quite accommodating.  ""How fancy!""

The bf and I agreed on the tasting menu with an additional foie gras order since the bf never had it while it was in CA.

First course: Domestic Caviar Parfait: Caviar, alderwood-smoked salmon, creme fraiche, shallot potato crisp: BEST THING I ATE THE WHOLE WEEKEND!  So good!  Definitely looking forward to coming back to this!

Second course: Foie Gras Two Ways: Like buttah.  For my bf's first time, he didn't get the hype.  I, on the other hand, thought it was dank!!  lol.  

Third course: Tartare of Ahi Tuna: Asian pear, pine nuts, scotch bonnet infused sesame oil: pretty good.  I loved the presentation of the dish.  The prepare it for you on the table which adds a nice touch to the experience.  This is where the bf and I started slowing down and the tasting menu became more a food-eating marathon than anything else.  We were hurting to find room for food...I think it was the foie gras that took up a lot of space...note to self: do not add any dishes to a tasting menu!

Fourth course: Miso-glazed Chilean Sea Bass: Shellfish Dumpling, Dashi Broth: Fish was good, nothing impressive; but still good.  Least favorite course of the menu.  The dumpling was whatevs.

Fifth course: Lobster Pot Pie: By this point of the meal, we were really struggling.  This dish was rich.  It's lobster pot pie for Pete's sake!  It's my second favorite dish of the courses.

Sixth course: American Wagyu Ribeye ""Rossini"": Hudson Valley Foie Gras (ugh!  why did we order a separate course of foie gras!?? It was already in our menu!!!? hahaha), Pinot Noir Reduction: Heaven.  

Seventh course: *This is when I told Miguel, our server, just bring one plate of dessert, there is no way we could have our own plate; we'll just share* Rootbeer Float, Warm Chocolate Chip Cookie, Lincoln's Candy Bar (peanuts, Valrhona chocolate, pretzel...the best thing on the plate): The rootbeer float was too spicy for me.  the chocolate chip cookie was nothing that spectacular, but that candy bar...ohhhhhh nelly!

Whenever I write a review, I always ask myself: Will I go back? With all the other well-known restaurants in the area, probably not. I think I'd rather try the others before coming back to this place.",tvPZka5YqURSIMyHwsddxw,1,0,3,A1pEPt0CPn7KrV2ojE66KA

1119212,2010-01-10,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"I had a wonderful experience at Michael Mina's all-around: service, food, and decor were all up to par to what is expected from such a big name. Furthermore, despite the fact he doesn't really cook anymore and he opens more restaurants than he can probably remember, I was still pleasantly surprised at my dining experience. 

I came for my bday dinner and my gf and I chose to get the ""Michael Mina Cookbook Tasting Menu"" which basically consists of a 5 course meal showcasing Mr. Mina's 5 most popular dishes (albeit in reduced portions versus that of the a la carte size): (108 per person w/out wine pairing)

1. Tartare of Ahi Tuna: a very light dish seasoned with salt, pepper, pine nuts, and sesame oil - compared to the multitude of ahi tuna dishes out there in the culinary world, this was surprisingly bland. The fish was well diced and was very fresh, just needed a little more seasoning.

2. Maine Lobster Pot Pie: Mr. Mina's arguably most famous dish - with vegetables, cream, and black truffles - had this once at one of his original restaurants in SF (Aqua) and am still wowed by the flavor here. Beautifully made with a delicate pastry covering a generous portion of lobster mixed in with a flavorful, but not too heavy brandied cream sauce - yum!

3. Miso-glazed Chilean Seabass: sitting over a seafood dumpling (more like a tortellini) that is immersed in a dashi broth. Great miso flavor on the fish and well-cooked. While i felt the miso glaze may have been a little unbalanced and heavy on some portions of the fish filet, it was countered well with the light dashi broth. 

4. American Kobe Ribeye - a nice slab of foie gras sitting on top with a kind of potato cake on the side; while the beef was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and the foie gras was flavorful as always, i thought the portion of beef they give you is a little on the small side. It seemed more like a ""sampling"" than a merely reduced size dish. Just don't expect a nice big filet coming to you.

5. Trio of desserts - mini root beer float, opera cake, and coconut smore - i'm not the most reliable dessert critic as that is not my favorite part of the meal but i must say the mini root beer float was memorable. Not too sweet, yet flavorful and the straw that is made of white choocholate actually works as a straw with a hollow middle. 

Service: The service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive, friendly, and informative. He explained every dish and its components and always checked in with us to ensure our meal was going well. He refilled our drinks/water as often as it was necessary.

Overall, despite a few picky things here and there concerning under or over seasoning, i had an awesome time at this restaurant. The food was generally well-proportioned and flavorful. The service was good and the price was fair considering it is a five-star restaurant in a five-star hotel in a tourist city. Recommended =)",KAU0uc4Ff_RNfJ_3_BKgug,1,0,4,Y23G4nIR3ia8lhV3RCTXXA

Regardless of how the food tasted, I have no desire to dine there ever again because it was just such a dry atmosphere. Bland white walls, bland white table cloths, smooth jazz (aka elevator music) playing in the background. BLAH! It was much too stuffy in there! 

For the record, the food was very well prepared but the pricing on the main courses seemed a little ridiculous. It's the type of place where you pay a lot of money for barely there portions. Don't bring your appetite to this spot!",qdAWit92O9lMqLYPFs1VYw,1,0,3,2s8tbToWk9orzUxQuKxfJA

The service was great but the vegan version of the vegetarian tasting menu left way too much to be desired for that price. We called ahead to make sure they could accommodate a vegan diet for one of us and were assured they could. But when we get there the waiter initially said they could not for the tasting menu. He then checked with the chef and yey, they could. But in hindsight I wish they would have originally said no on the phone and we would have went somewhere else. 
I'm happy to pay these prices for inspired food like I had at Michael Mina's restaurant in San Fran years ago, or Susur's in Toronto, but the food was just not today. I literally had the best meal on the trip from the much cheaper vegan menu at Nacho Daddy's! And we ordered a literally $11 bottle of Riesling from Columbia valley marked up 600% to $64.

Forewarning - you're going to see heavy usage of the word intense 

Veggie Tasting Menu w/ the ""Premium"" Wine Paring 

* 3 Melon salad - huge shavings of Honeydew, Cantaloupe, & teeny little balls of cucumber w/ slivers of Jalapeno & drizzled in Olive Oil 

* Asparagus Soup w/ Tomato Dumplings & Mushrooms - those dumplings were OMG gasp-provoking - intensely flavored w/ tomato & when paired w/ the equally intense flavor of the asparagus - wow!  Also had little mushrooms & roasted tomatoes in the middle of the soup so lots of yummy flavors to mix & match. This was 1 of my favs 

* Artichoke Souffle w/ Parmesan sauce - so smooth, rich & intense w/ artichoke flavor; not eggy at all & cooked just perfectly. This was 1 of my favs 

* Ricotta Truffle Fettuccine - teeny tiny carrots, green beans, and these absolutely incredibly tasty large brown beans (don't know what they were) are nestled in long-as-your-arm, hand-rolled fettuccine noodles. Huge flavors of truffle!! 

* Cherry Semolina Cake w/ Sherry-infused Ice Cream - moist semolina cake w/ marinated cherries and an intensely-flavored Sherry Ice Cream. Light dessert which topped off the meal just perfectly 

* Amuse Bouche was Goat Cheese Panna Cotta w/ Tomato Gelee. We didn't get to try this dish b/c Panna Cotta is usually made from gelatin & those of us in the veggie world know gelatin is a no-no. Our waiter was so kind & apologetic & he had the chef make us a special Amuse Bouche of Melon & Tomatoes which was so nice! 

But he then came over later to tell us upon further research, he uncovered the gelatin they use for the Panna Cotta was actually made out of Agar so it was completely Veggie-friendly!  He said they make it a special point to design all their Amuses so that everyone can enjoy.....they take care to incorporate the Veggie and Allergy people - so no animal, shellfish or nuts go into the Amuses 

HOW AWESOME IS THAT?! 

Service was incredible & everyone was so friendly - immediately asked if we were on a timetable (which we were!) so they could get us out & on our way - explained each dish as it was delivered & how it was made; asked if we liked it; The Sommelier explained each wine, where it came from & the vintage & came back to ask if we liked it.....it was true 5-star treatment

1253042,2014-12-27,2,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"I got the signature tasting menu and some people I was with got the seasonal tasting menu, a six course menu. Both were $115, wine pairings are an additional cost. The room was nice, quiet, and dimly lit. Even on a Monday night the place was fairly busy. The service is professional and fast. Also, I have to add this because I love artisan bread - the bread they had was so. good. They offer you a choice between honey wheat and sourdough. The honey wheat tasted amazing. The sourdough had a weird taste. I didn't like it much.
The starting course was caviar. For the signature, it was some kind of potato cake/cheese with caviar on top. It was very good, probably one of the better dishes of the night. For the seasonal tasting menu, it was a squash panna cotta topped with caviar which was kind of a flop. Nothing really special.
Next course was fish. Signature tasting menu was tuna tartare. I don't like tartare, so I can't really comment on this dish. Seasonal tasting menu had sashimi, which was decent but lacking taste.
Third course was definitely the best for the signature tasting menu, which was Chilean sea bass. This was absolutely the best bass I have ever eaten in my life. The fish is so tender and they serve it in a miso soup. The fish was amazing. There was ahí tuna for the seasonal tasting menu. I didn't try it, but the people who had it said it was nothing special.
Fourth course was lobster. Signature tasting menu had a lobster pot pie, which looks huge but is only filled about a third up, which is good, because by this point we're all stuffed. The waiter cuts the pot pie in front of you, which is sort of cool, and you're supposed to crumble the top bread part into crumbs and put it in the soup. It didn't taste that special. Seasonal tasting menu fared better this course with a lobster ravioli which they plate right in front of you.
Fifth course is red meat. Signature tasting menu had a wagyu beef which was super tender and well cooked. What was interesting was that they didn't ask you how you wanted it cooked, but it came out about medium so I guess that was fine. It tasted good. The seasonal tasting menu had veal which was tougher, but that's to be expected with veal.
Final course was dessert. Both desserts came out on a plate with a root beer float and a cookie. The cookie was pretty good. The float, not so much. The signature tasting menu had a weird chocolate/jam cake with peanut butter chantilly which was adventurous but tasted weird. The seasonal tasting menu came with a passion fruit panna cotta that was tart and amazing.
Overall, the food was good, the service was good, and each plate was presented beautifully. Between the signature tasting menu and the (winter) seasonal tasting menu, I recommend the signature tasting menu, but this may not be true when the menu changes. The food was worth the high price in my opinion. It was pretty fitting for a one Michelin star restaurant. The only critique I have is that the sommelier and the waiter were not coordinated so sometimes the wine came out minutes before the dish, which was awkward. Otherwise it was a nice experience.",yVZfXD9R81Y-TsRitsvrCg,1,1,5,FvkjdILXg9cSHCX1yB-LwA

The sommelier said the California sparkling wine is not on the menu, but it is very good and it turns out is  1/2 the price of VC Yellow label.  I can't remember the name of it, Cisnaros or something, but it was a great deal.  Heavier than VC Yellow but good.  

We make goat cheese with beets and vegetables at home, but their appetizer had almonds with the brown outside removed and they used aged goat cheese with a light brulee that was beautiful.  So much nicer than standard Trader Joe's goat cheese that we use.  Very nice dish.  

She had the grilled sturgeon which was very tasty, but came out just warm.  She sent it back and then was perfect.

Fine contemporary Americana dining offers a style in service and food similar to Wolfgang's Steakhouse or Ruth's Kris. Fairly standard and finely prepared foods, served by a host of waiters delight the palate as the ambiance and dining experience dazzle the eyes.

MM's leans more towards the seafood spectrum than the aforementioned restaurants and that is where you will the majority of their creativity.

The steaks are well prepared and cooked but feel as they serve as a substitute for the turf hold outs.

While the starters also show some creativity and are excellent, the sides lack that creativity (Potato Puree, Summer Squash, etc ...) and (for me) take away from the dining experience a bit. Everything is ordered ala carte (a style of service I am not a fan of at fine restaurants).

I loved the lobster pot pie, and the duck was the best duck I've ever had, and the honey butter bread.....delicious. I was actually planning on going here for my birthday in a few months.

Unfortunately, when I came here, I was so disappointed.  So many things went wrong.  I wasn't terrible hungry, so I decided to go for the ravioli appetizer and brussel sprouts.  I also planned to taste/share everybody else's food.

The ravioli was not amazing.  It was small portioned, which was fine, but it was just too fishy and not very flavorful.  The Brussel sprouts were really good.

Then comes the lobster pot pie.  It was beautiful, as always.  The problem was that my boyfriend's lobster wasn't cooked all the way.  They told us maybe it was because the shell was too thick at the end?  Anyway, it had a horrible taste in the tail end.  At first we jokingly thought maybe it was a female and it had the taste of eggs.  Anyway that lobster was passed around the table, until we all agreed it was just undercooked. 

We told the waiter who apologized and said somebody would be out to speak with us.  He also asked if we wanted another entree.  We said no.  

About 5 minutes later, they bring us a another lobster tail.  Nobody wanted to eat it.  Nobody came to speak to us.  

Meanwhile, a waitress tries to split behind us between a wall of wine glasses.  Her apron hooks on something and broken wine glass shatters all over 2-3 girls jackets and purses on the floor.  We got an apology.  

The manager never came to speak to us.  My boyfriend is so grossed out and nauseated he cant' finish his foie gras, so it was wasted.  
 
The steak I tasted from my friend's was good.  The beet salad was pretty good, and the last side dish-something creamy/risotto tasting was alright.

Anyway, the bill came, they took off my boyfriend's lobster.  

It's just- I don't know-the experience was very negative.  My boyfriend wanted to puke, and he was very unhappy.  Saving a bit of money wasn't really worth it.  I think if the manager had come out or even if they brought us dessert, it would have been a nice gesture and that would have been enough.

Instead more lobster nobody wanted to eat, an apology with a not-so-great excuse (the shell was too thick?), no manager after the waiter told us he would be out to talk to us, and broken glass....not to mention my fishy ravioli I didn't like....

I don't know.  In my boyfriend's words...he felt like Micheal Mina really missed the mark.

1337490,2007-11-17,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"I was here on a business dinner, so our menu may or may not have been the standard option.  This is a true 4 star review.

We started with a simple salad, very nicely presented, though a bit difficult to eat with the full leaf lettuce requiring a knife.  The quail egg and bacon were perfectly presented, as was the peeled grape tomato.  The 2nd of 4 courses was a butter poached lobster tail with a sweet potato crepe. This was the highlight of the meal.  Very well cooked, and very sweet. The true flavor of the lobster came through, and could be appreciated.  

For the third course, I chose a miso-glazed black cod.  This was very good, though I've had better black cod with miso (Nobu/Matsuhisa/Morimoto).  The presentation was lovely.  The final course was a trio of desserts, and this was another huge hit.  A warm molten chocolate cake with an espresso sauce.  The scent of this wafted off the plate, and made your mouth water.  A coconut creme with a bit of toasted coconut on top. The texture mix of light, and smooth with the tiny bits of crunch were very well balanced.  The final bit was a marzipan cheesecake with a dark chocolate sauce on the side.  Again, this was a big success, and the flavor of the marzipan (I think that's the best way to describe it) really didn't weigh down this amazingly light and airy cheesecake. I think it might have been made with a marscapone instead of a ricotta or cream cheese.  I reccomend the restaurant, the service was very good, though a bit un-eco-friendly, as they replace your napkin every time you get up, instead of re-folding it.  The wine list is extensive, and the space is a bit small, but keeps a nice, intimate feel to the restaurant.

First...we had the tuna tartare....which was served on, I kid you not, wonderbread toast. My ""I don't eat raw stuff"" friend next to me had the dungeness crab ravioli substitute, which was really delicate and tasty..

Then...we had the lobster pot pie. Everything inside the pie was delicious; lobster was cooked just right and the cream was smooth. But the pie crust was not edible.. I was about to take a bite of this cream-dipped  piece of pie crust and my friend belched out ""DON'T!""..as she spat out the pie crust back onto her plate..oh my. I didn't believe her, but it really did taste like a stale piece of saltine cracker. How can you assume people will just eat the filling and not the pie crust...~sigh..

And then...we had the kobe rib eye. The rib eye was really good; very tender and juicy as expected. The fav around the table is the creamed corn that came with it. My friend's snow peas were not blanched enough and it left a grassy taste.

Finally...the dessert sampler. I really liked the root beer float with the chocolate chip and nut cookies.. We even snuck in some of those cookies to the show.. heh.

the waigu beef with seared fois gras was mouthwateringly delicious and perfectly cooked. I could go on and on about the food, but I must get to the desert... German Chocolate Cake, Toasted Coconut Ice Cream, Candied Walnuts and Root Beer Float with Sassafras Ice Cream, Warm Chocolate Chip Nut Cookies. 
The wine pairings were right on, from the light grassy chablis to the rich full bodied bouredeaux.
I must say though, that the service at Michael Mina put  the service at Joel Robichon's to shame  (they were horribly snooty... AMAZING FOOD and awful waiters).

It was fancy but still a casual & comfortable atmosphere with impeccable attentive service (water refilled immediately never more than half empty, finished dishes removed within a minute, more bread offered & courses served timely within 3-5 minutes of the last).

I had the tasting the menu & my husband had the butternut squash soup, wagyu New York steak, grand patron margarita w/ mariner, & the root beer & chocolate pecan cookies.

I was expecting so had to swap out the caviar parfait & ahi tuna tartare for cooked dishes but will have to come back to try those as it looked delightful coming to other tables around us.  Everything was flavorful with special surprises in texture or a burst of sweet or tartness from fruits/veggies.

I figured I'm saving by skipping an appetizer. Both we excellent. My pot pie delayed our meals and the menu nor the waiter informed us of this so we just sat there (without appetizers) for about 30mins until we asked. The menu should warn people or the server should suggest sharing an appetizer to fill the wait. Anyway, they bring out the pie still in the copper clad pot with the top crust already removed.

Our party came for the $60 3course Prix Fixe menu. We arrived a little late and they only offer the menu within a short hour between 5-6pm i believe. However the waiter was nice enough to offer the menu anyway. 

The ambiance is nice and clean in the restaurant. I had my doubts walking into this place because it was located next to the arboretum at the Bellagio and it was particularly busy that evening.  But the sound from the crowd was nicely muted within the restaurant, I hardly notice all the passerby outside as soon as we sat down. 

the menu was great. My brother opted in for the tuna tartare. The waiter mixes the ingredients right infront of you and the dish was fresh and the flavors were vibrant. I opted for their pumpkin soup and grill cheese sandwich. I don't remember what the cheese was but that sandwich was delicious... It was down right magical. The soup was creamy and the flavors were strong. Some might not like it as much if they don't like pumpkin but it sat well with me.

Second course I opted for their lobster pot pie. It was $20 extra I believe but it was totally worth it. They stuck a whole lobster in the pot and baked in its own juices and veggies. The lobster has got to be a good 3lb. I was stuffed from this. The other people in my party got the filet. I can't comment on that dish because I didn't try it. But it did look delicious and my friend said it melted in his mouth. So I'm going to assume its good.

The dessert was either the rootbeer float or the chocolate truffle. Both were good. The float had a little waffer straw which was a nice touch. The chocolate was intense but with a very nice texture.

That showed some foresight and helped us be able to enjoy our meal with plenty of time.  

We ordered the watermelon salad to start. It was absolutely beautiful but I didn't personally care for the taste. My friend ordered it, too, and she really liked it. I ordered the scallops for my main course and they were absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. My other friend ordered the fish and he said it was delicious as well. The waiter made a really great recommendation for dessert when I said I wanted something that didn't taste too heavy.

The accolades are endless: One Michelin Star, AAA Four-Diamond Awards, Mobil Four-Star Award... along with countless others thanks to their impeccable? service and a menu that offers modern? Seafood and polished? American cuisine uniquely prepared using seasonal produce all under the careful watch of Executive Chef Nick Sharpe.

A delicate?, flaky filet of Sole is coated dragged? in Phyllo Crumbs that have been baked in sheets and then crumbled to adhere to the Sole Steaks. The result once fried is a textured crunchy crust with a heavenly mouthfeel.

My favorite item on their menu is the Lobster Pot Pie. But please arrive hungry as the pot of lobster will challenge even the most voracious appetite.  If turf is more you're style, Michael Mina's signature trio entrees are also recommended, especially the Kobe beef. Excellent in every way.

But I have to tell Yelpers, once I got emotional indigestion from MM. It was when we first started up our business and took our only staffer to a professional meeting and MM for dinner. Later, when I  learned that she had used the trip to interview with a frenemy, I felt like we not only had the lobster pot pie but a piece of humble pie as well.

These days, we walk around the office thanking the frenemy as his hiring away that original staffer got us to meet and hire a really great replacement. 

And whenever we're in Vegas we'll make it a point to savor our luck and continued success over a lobster pot pie knowing that chances of running into the old staffer and her penny-wise boss dining in this fine establishment would be slim to none.

My boyfriend and I love trying new dining experiences and having passed this establishment a gazillion times before,  we've finally secured ourselves a rezzie for dinner. 
We were greeted seated promptly after checking in. A quick survey of the clientele that night in October revealed mostly young, hip, 20-somethings who're there for the same reasons as us: culinary adventure.

We knew, going in, that we would partake in the prix fixe dinner, but since we wanted to get the most out of this adventure,  we opted for two different prix fixe options.  I believe I ordered the Signature menu and my boyfriend ordered the Seasonal menu. Both were bomb delicious!

1. Called to make the reservation, you get dumped into the Bellagio system and very impersonal throughout. Never asked if this was a special occasion.

2. Seated right away after lukewarm greetings from the staff at the door.

3. Server greeted us right away but seemed put off because we did not opt for bottled water. He did cheer up later after we ordered the caviar appetizer.

4. We stuck with the A la Carte menu because wife wanted the diver scallops and most reviews raved about them. 

5. The appetizer was the Siberian Osetra ($175) and it came with three (each) blinis, sour cream, hard boiled eggs, chives, toast points, a tall glass of champagne, and some fried mashed potato tater tots. Caviar had a good taste but a mushy texture, did not ""pop"" at all. Blinis tasted great but popped up too much and hard to spread stuff on top of them without falling off.

6. For second appetizers I had the Hudson Valley Foie Gras and the wife had the Asparagus soup. The Foie Gras was excellent, the only time I had better was a few years ago at Picasso. The soup was ok although my wife enjoyed it.

7. The diver scallops were very disappointing, not ""melt in your mouth tender"" and they did not have a ""clean"" taste to them. The scallops at Aquaknox have been perfect the three times we ate there. My chilean sea bass was a letdown, it was more of a soup than anything else. It was cooked perfectly but the presentation was not what i expected. 

8. For desert my wife had the pear tart and it was very good, I tried a bite and also liked it. I had the signature Root Beer Float mainly because of all the raves. Seriously? It was root beer with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a few cookies. 

9. They need to do away with the dress code. I wore a suit and most people were dressed fine, there were quite a few people in ratty jeans with shirts not tucked in. Why even have a code when you don't enforce it. 

Wait staff was very attentive and quickly removed all empty plates. Never did see a sommelier, maybe because we did not get the tasting menu, but the waiter did a good job of pairing glasses of wine for each course. He did not ask if we wanted any coffee or drinks with desert. 

Some of the food was 5 stars while some was 2 stars. 
Service was 3 stars overall.

1707147,2013-08-27,9,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"6 stars. Only 5 stars are showing, but it's 6. Trust me. This review is based on our Restaurant Week dinner. I've given 5 stars to restaurants during this popular foodie week that's held twice a year. Michael Mina, without a doubt, exceeded all of them. 

Before our dinner night, I realized my boyfriend, who recently went through knee surgery, could not wear slacks due to the leg brace he's required to wear. When I informed Michael Mina, their response was ""No problem, we understand."" Not only were they completely understanding about his attire, but they didn't hide and seat us in the back by the kitchen. Yes, folks, usually restaurants like this will ""dress"" their room.

Looking at Michael Mina's regular menu, you can immediately tell that the $50.13 RW prix-fix dinner price is an absolutely steal! The entree selections were the Phyllo-Crusted Sole or Beef of Filet. Each one alone was $55+ if ordered ala carte. I was also pleasantly surprised they added the Ahi Tuna Tartare and Lobster Pot Pie ($37 supplement) to the Restaurant Week menu! The Ahi Tuna is originally $26, yet they offered it as a $15 supplement. I spent more than I usually do at this dinner, but seeing the original prices, I thought it was one of the best RW deals I've seen.

As far as the food, the Lobster Pot Pie, the Phyllo-Crusted Sole, and the Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies really shined. The Lobster Pot Pie was presented and deconstructed elegantly table side. If you read the other reviews, you already know both these entrees was pretty darn delicious. The Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies were served warm, gooey on the inside, crispy on the outside. So delicious. These cookies will be what I judge all future cookies against from now on. 

Service was near perfection. Really. There's many restaurants that give great service. However, there's something to be said that great timing, also. From every fresh glass of iced tea that was brought out, to the fresh table napkin that was replenished when we got up from our seat, doing all this at the precise right time without making you feel like they're hovering over you needs to be given a lot of credit. Our server, Sabin, could tell by our expression how full we were from our main course after it was cleared away. She asked if we wanted to sit and digest before she brought out our dessert course. No worries about turning over her table on a busy Saturday night, or rushing us out.  So, we sat, took our time, chatted, then let her know we were ready to tackle our sweets. We appreciated that.

1709245,2012-01-20,12,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"***Michael Mina's food is well presented and it is mostly decent, but it is not up to the standards of similar fine dining restaurants in SF and Chicago***

Michael Mina sits in The Bellagio and is a bustling restaurant.  The open kitchen showcases a frenzy of activity and the dining room is dimly lit and nice (an elegant room but contemporary decor and not too stuffy).  The space is kind of straightforward and there is not much about it that will stick with me.

I want to try Michael Mina's new spot in SF, but I decided to pay this Las Vegas location a visit first.  The menu consisted of pricey a la carte options (starters, entrees, desserts) or a four course tasting menu.  I opted for the tasting menu and added an additional starter.

The complimentary bread at Michael Mina consisted of rolls--sourdough and honey wheat.  Both rolls were warm, which was nice, but the rolls were too big (too much bread, too dense, mild in flavor).

My first course was the smoked salmon parfait, which sat on a potato cake and was mixed with creme fraiche and topped with caviar (there was a supplemental price for this course).  The flavor was good.  I liked the smoked salmon and the potato, which was crispy and not greasy.  The caviar was fine, but it did not pop with flavor like the caviar at Petrossian in West Hollywood.  Considering that Petrossian is next door, they might be using the same supplier, but the salty flavor of the caviar did not come across.

I ordered the seared foie gras as an additional starter and it was a good combination of salty and sweet elements (date puree).  They garnished the dish with some pain perdu (French toast), but the pain perdu did not seem that fresh; it was a little dry and there was little crispiness to the outside crust.  Overall, the foie gras dish had a good flavor, but it was actually quite undercooked and raw.

The next course was the lobster pot pie, which is a Michael Mina specialty.  The pastry crust was good and the pot pie mixture was kind of like a lobster-bisque, which included chunks of lobster, potatoes, carrots, and other vegetables.  The dish was incredibly buttery and rich.  The potatoes were slightly underdone.

A lot of times, lobster can get cooked too much in these type of dishes and I felt that was the case here.  Even though the lobster had a good flavor, I would have preferred it softer.

My main course was the American kobe ribeye, which was served on creamed corn and then garnished with a porcini mushroom sauce.  The ribeye was good.  It had a great outside bark (crispy and kind of like the bark you would get with smoked meats).  The meat was tender and had a great flavor (it was also juicy).

I liked the sauce, which provided moisture and a savory flavor and was not too sweet.  The creamed corn (which was quite minced so it was kind of like a creamed wheat) was fine but nothing memorable.

The dessert course consisted of many small desserts.  There was a chocolate bon bon filled with ice cream (just okay), a brown sugar wafer filled with cream (I liked the crispy, buttery wafer) and warm apple cider with vanilla sugar cookies (the cookies were standard stuff; the apple cider was strong but good).

The bigger desserts included freshly made chocolate chip and nut cookies that were served with a root beer float.  I really liked the cookies, which were crispy, chewy and rich.  The root beer float was okay.  The ice cream combined with the root beer to make a root beer slushi.

There was also a chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream and pecans.  This dessert was moist and rich, but it did not stand apart from similar chocolate desserts I've had at other fine dining restaurants.

Service was good.  The staff was personable and polite and the food came out at a good pace.

Prices were high, but then again, a lot of Las Vegas fine dining restaurants are expensive.  Michael Mina's premium ingredients like the caviar and kobe meat are very expensive here, but there are also a few less expensive options.

The food at Michael Mina was nicely presented and I really liked the ribeye.  If the foie gras would have been cooked properly, I would have liked that as well.  The other stuff I had was fine, but it was not up to the standards or quality I would expect to get with similarly priced restaurants in SF or Chicago.  I think Michael Mina in Las Vegas is an okay fine dining spot, but I am hoping that the new SF location will provide a much more superior experience (and I think it will).

We waited 15-20 minutes for our table even though we had reservations and arrived on time for those reservations, I gave them the benefit of the doubt since we had 9 people in our party. Once seated we waited a long time for drink orders and after drink orders were taken we waited even longer for drinks. We ordered a couple $300 bottles of wine, you would think the waiter or wine steward would have been on the ball when the bottles ran dry, nope, we eventually had to flag down another waiter to ask our waiter be sent over. from the time we were seated until the time our main course was dropped was about 80 minutes, way too long considering the only appitizer courses we ordered were salads.

One of my favorite dishes was the beef carpaccio (don't think it was on the menu when I went back tho). The flavor and texture were perfect. Mina's foie gras also has a good unique flavor to it with the ideal silky texture. I had the kobe beef which was obviously a small amount, but cooked to perfection.

The most glorious bite of my meal was on a round, lightly salted blue corn tortilla chip, loaded with fresh chunks of tangy ceviche, fluffy white coconut foam threatening to escape and fall to the table- but not before I caught it on my tongue! Finish that off with a sweet and spiced up popcorn kernel, and you'll want to worship the day that Michael Mina was conceived. This most delightful bite of ceviche was Thai influenced with hints Thai chili and coconut froth enhancing its refreshing lemon based sauce. I know it sounds strange, but it works. It works real good. 

By now you're probably thinking, wow did she really just write a WHOLE paragraph on one bite of ceviche? Well I just gotta write what's in my heart! That stuff stole the show. It made me wish that photographs existed to record the memory of a taste instead of sight. 

But on to the rest of the night: the service was exceptional. Make sure to call ahead and book a table near the window with a view of the Bellagio fountain to make it all worth it! For fish, get the sea bass with miso broth, shellfish dumpling, and bok choy. I seriously drank the rest of the sauce after my fish was long gone. That tasty. For meat, the kobe is out of this world expensive- but also equally as delicious. To get the bang for your buck and a slice of Kobe, order the tasting menu. I never thought beef could taste like anything else but beef, but this piece of meat brings quality steak to a whole new level. Perfectly cooked, juices burst in your mouth and the meat just melts.

MM in SF is good, but nothing blew my skirt up.  Had the Cookbook Menu.  

I DO like how MM LV gives the option of ordering the Cookbook Menu WITHOUT the actual book.  Who the hell wants an autographed copy w/useless recipes you'll never utilize in the kitchen?

Wine pairings were poured prior, set on a silver platter, along with the wine bottle and then presented.  Hey, they could have been serving Meridian for all we knew.  

We chose the seasonal tasting menu and the wine pairing:

Amuse: Mushroom soup, a bit goopey in texture and heavy in taste.

MM Signature Caviar Parfait
Beautiful presentation: layers of American Osetra, Alderwood Smoked Salmon, Creme Fraiche, & a Potato Shallot Cake at the bottom.  Excellent.  By far the best course of the evening.  Mild flavors.  Each ingredient shone individually.

Butter Poached Maine Lobster
A small, slightly rubbery piece of lobster, with a soggy corn crepe, swimming in Thai coconut cream.  I did not like the flavor profiles @ all.

Wild King Salmon
Terribly bland.  Did not taste the Vidalia Onion Soubise or Cippolini.  It was all about the overcooked, unsalted fish and the crispy leeks.  The bf didn't even want to touch my leftovers.

The tuna tasted like it was just doused with soy.  Eh.  Tasted like something a big chain would whip up on their 'Asian Wok' section.

Tasting of MM Signature Desserts
Warm Chocolate Cake, very good.  Finished the entire thing.  Coconut panna cotta, delicious, mellow flavors.  Mini root beer float, I like ICE CREAM in my floats, this one had a slush inside, the bf enjoyed it.  

Many jellies on the petit four plate.  Not a fan.  

MM is supposed to be focused on seafood, but this tasting was too heavy on the seafood AND it didn't help that the flavors & the execution were MAJOR flops.

I would not make a return dining trip here.  We actually decided we really don't like MM after THIS particular dining experience, but we will navigate his MGM Grand ventures at month's end.",53bZ_EsXH71L7iFs5MP9_w,5,0,2,oCL2OcKIUcB3TMYmzOexLg

I used OpenTable to make my reservation.  So convenient!  

Most of our table had the signature tasting menu and two guests had the seasonal tasting menu.  If I had the option, I would've done some mixing and matching to get the best of both worlds.  

The first course of caviar was excellent.  I wished that was bigger.  I could easily have eaten a whole plate.  

The tuna tartare was a tad heavy on the sesame oil, but otherwise, the tuna itself was perfect.  I shared with my friend and got to try her hamachi.  That was incredible. 

My miso glazed sea bass was amazing.  The texture was spot on.  The portion was just right and the flavours were well balanced.  

What do you think of lobster pot pie?  Sounds like a good one, right?  The lobster was way overcooked.  It was actually a huge disappointment.  None of us wanted to say anything because we didn't want another portion and we were getting full anyways, but this one was off the mark.  The carrots were undercooked.  Very strange dish.  

The wagyu steak was good.  Not fantastic, not terrible, just good.  The truffle was a nice addition but I felt the foie gras was unnecessary.  Of course, that might've been because we had just consumed the whole roasted foie gras served table side.  That was really good.  I preferred the middle pieces whereas some of our table enjoyed the end pieces.  Chacun son gout!  

I liked the mini root beer float, but I'm a sucker for root beer.  The cookies were nice and moist.  The chocolate bar was very rich after such a filling meal, I wish I ate it all but just didn't have room.  I tried my friend's panna cotta and that was light and delicate.  Very smooth on the palate.  Passion fruit and avocado, go figure!  

Overall, considering quality, quantity, and value, this was a good meal.

I won't go into every single course but will say this: Tuna Tartare - fish was fresh, but could have done with more flavor. Serving Size was too large for a tasting menu (and as this was one of the early courses it sort of ruins your appetite for later courses) Lobster Pot Pie - lovely in theory, shame about the pastry - it is a pot pie after all, and you're encouraged to break up the pastry and eat it in the bowl itself but we found it too thick and cloying. Chilean Sea Bass - fish was done well but nothing spectacular (sort of like a really well done Chinese fish dish) Beef - Decent not great. Dessert - was the best course of the meal - which says alot. 

Way overpriced in my opinion, although service was fantastic, a total let down after the lovely first meal we had at Lago (also in Bellagio, by Julian Serrano).

They do a great job with presentation and the restaurant itself if beautiful with the abundance of wood they used for the interior. My wife and I enjoy food and would consider us borderline food snobs, therefore we have high standards when it comes to fine dining establishments. Just a few days before we tried Le Cirque and had a great meal. 

The taste was lacking in many dishes we had. We were a party of 4 and had a vegetarian with us who opted for the vegetarian tasting menu while the rest of us had the regular tasting menu. Most of his vegetarian dishes really lacked a good flavor and I think whoever created the menu should start over. Our first course, the ahi tuna could have used a little more spice and maybe some sesame oil to bring out the flavor more. My lobster pot pie had good flavor but the lobster was overcooked. The squid ink risotto really wasn't that flavorful. The scallops was tasty but could also use a little more flavor. The wagyu was good but could also use more seasoning and flavor. 

Out of all the tasting menus we have had this restaurant would be in the bottom 10%. The food would be very good compared to most other restaurants but in a city full of great restaurants it really needs to step up its game.",tDb-EDd6MV26tGwk6U8QOw,1,0,4,loI3VK3B6qUWHa_rk0j9ZQ

It was like a calm orchestra. My boyfriend and I had a great time watching the head chef directing the line cooks and servers. The décor was nice, soft wood, lots of flowers. Nothing too harsh or too obvious. It was very laid back, but refined at the same time.

The service here was impeccable. From the hostess, to the servers who took away our dishes. We really felt like we were being taken care of.

They started us off with a complimentary amuse bouche, a piece of watermelon with goat cheese and balsamic vinegar. I've never had watermelon with goat cheese, it was surprisingly good, and went well together. 
To start off we ordered the Ahi Tuna Tartare ($24). It came with a quail egg, sesame oil, toasted pine nuts, garlic, mint, and some bread points. The waiter explained everything, and then thoroughly tossed everything together so we'd get everything thin in a bite. The tuna was fresh and delicious. The garlic add a great kick, as well did the pine nuts. Very enjoyable. 
I ordered the Phyllo-Dusted Sole ($55), it came with a crab brandade, horseradish marscapone, and sauce djion. The Sole was cooked perfectly, the phyllo added great texture and crunch. The crab brandade was delightful, and the marscapone wasn't too strong. Great compliment to the fish.
My boyfriend ordered the Surf n' Turf (market price at the time, $95). This was American Kobe (2 decent size filets) and a bone marrow-crusted lobster tail. This came with a delicious carrot puree, potatoes, and a bearnaise sauce. Delightful!
For dessert we had honey soaked pineapple with almond sponge cake and vanilla gelato ($12). Very refreshing. The also offer you complimentary petit fours at the end. One was a red wine reduction gelee, one was a coconut macaroon, one was a round chocolate cookie, and one was a vanilla cookie ( I think). They weren't GREAT but a nice way to end the meal.

If you are looking for a romantic locale, this restaurant is located on the perimeter of the gardens in the Bellagio, which serve as a scenic interlude into the restaurant. I went with a friend for dinner on a Saturday night in late April.

Ambiance: 5 out of 5
Michael Mina is cozy, warm, intimate, and comfortable. The noise level is just fine. One of the unique aspects of the experience is the semi-open kitchen, which provides just the right amount of ease and excitement in the restaurant, which would feel overly formal without it.

Ahi Tuna Tartare Appetizer: 5 out of 5
We ordered this to split and it ended up being the perfect starter. Two servers arrived in concert and presented us both with a beautifully-conceived plate. Each had a small round of chunky tuna tartare, topped with a quail egg. Toasted sesame oil decorated the plate and roasted pine nuts were situated on the side. Next, both servers placed the plates in front of us and proceeded to mix in the elements of the tartare with two serving spoons. The surprise tableside presentation was delightful. Taste-wise, the tuna in the tartare was cut in large chunks and was tender and succulent. The sesame oil added an unexpected complexity, depth, and richness to the dish. The quail egg, though small and pretty, neither added nor took away anything from the dish. Overall, it was delicious.

Lobster Pot Pie: 5 out of 5
We ordered this to split as our main course. The pot pie is large and enough for two people. Our server wheeled it out on a cart and perfectly portioned it out in front of us. The crust is thin and not flaky and resembles more of a rich, buttery cracker. The filling consisted of vegetables and huge hunks of lobster meat. Between the two of us, we got close to a full lobster. The broth is thinner than a typical pot pie, but it is exceedingly rich, creamy, and is elevated by black truffles, which infuse it with more dimension. My favorite part of the experience was eating the semi-soggy crust after it had been bathed in the cream sauce. I don't typically eat pot pies because I try to maintain a low-carb diet, but this was the best pot pie I've ever had, and it is worth the calories. A++.

Service: 5 out of 5
There are few instances where exceptional food is outshined by the service. Michael Mina has it down and perfected to the details. I cannot say enough about how excellent our service was--our waiter and the sommelier were exceptionally helpful. The food pace and presentation was also extremely memorable.

We had a reservation and good that we did, otherwise it would take forever. The restaurant is inside Bellagio, the decor is pretty and the ambiance is classy. We decided on vegetarian tasting menu ($85+ taxes) the menu wasn't a well thought out, not bad, just could have been so so so much better for a Michellin star restaurant.

We started with beetroot birds nest ( don't remember the exact name!) it was MIND BLOWING! The dish has dried beetroot stings in the shape of a birds nest topped with avocado, citrus and cheese. Just awesome! The texture of the birds nest and the combination of citrus and avocado, just wonderful! Perfect symphony in your mouth! 

Followed by GOLDEN BEET SALAD- pickled peach, hazelnut granola, drake glacier goat cheese was great! 

Followed by WHITE ASPARAGUS & GOLDEN CURRY SOUP  which was alright.

The SWEET CORN RAVIOLI was amazing. The taste of corn and it's texture was the star which elevated this dish!

JAPANESE TASTING
bamboo rice, tofu, glazed bok choy, tempura hen of the woods- this was really just so so. Hmm, not really going with the menu theme either.

The dessert was LEMON POPPY SEED POUND CAKE- macerated strawberries, lemon curd, coconut gelee was ok, again, I expected so much from a michellin star place.

Overall the good was great, good tasting, great colors and amazing textures with good plating. The experience was so so.

The pot pie was good, with an entire lobster in it, although I probably wouldn't order it again because I'm really not a big fan of pot pie. The sauce in it is good, so I'm not complaining... I just wasn't blown away like everyone else. I had the root bear float and cookies, and I was NOT impressed with either.

I ordered the Wagyu Ribeye because I know that it is one of most flavorful cuts, and I didn't feel like the filet.

What are you talking about - how could you possibly give JR a 2 star and Michael Mina 3. Here's the deal.

My bf and I, when we first started dating, decided to go out to eat. My bf wanted to take me out to MM to impress me. Needless to say I was impressed. The restaurant is located after a beautiful floral atrium and is almost next to the most impressive chocolate fountain you have ever seen. But that's besides the point. On to the eats.

At a $175 (for the chef's menu)price point - I was young and easily impressed by that (now I know better - see my JR review). But arrogant as it is - the menu does include a beautiful hardcover autographed book at a $60 value. So for what it's worth $115 for the chef's tasting menu roughly for food alone.

The amuse bouche was a clam chowder - without any clams visible. Vegetables yes - clams, no. 

The tuna tartare was tasty however it wasn't anything special that I hadn't had before. The famous lobster pot pie was a let down because of the pastry - pot pie should be flaky - like puff pastry. The thick and gumminess of the biscuit coating was a big turnoff. American Kobe Beef 3 ways - kind of obnoxious when there's only three rather thin slices of beef on your plate. 

The best dish of the night was a black cod in a miso broth - the cod was buttery - done just right.

And it's a kind of thoughtfulness that's rare even in fine dining these days. The ratio of main components to sides to sauces is perfect. I wasn't thrilled with a few things -- my steak wasn't served hot enough, its accompanying sauce was sitting out and had formed a skin -- and the waiter, although nice and friendly enough, spent most of his time chatting up the next table.

So I ate:

Ahi Tuna Tartar: Delicious. Each component - tuna, bell peppers, bosc pears - was portioned and sliced to perfection. Flavor was well-balanced and excellent, and didn't even need the accompanying slices of bread.

Lobster pot pie: A little misleading to call it a pot pie since it's essentially lobster soup in a bowl with a thin puff pastry cover. Nonetheless, it's delicious. Good-sized chunks of lobster, rich wine-y broth, divine.

Kobe steak with fingerling potatoes, crispy shallots and cheese sauce: Incredibly tender and juicy, seared to a perfect medium-rare. I'd have liked to see more crispy shallots but since it was essentially garnish, it's ok they only had a few strings of it. Like I said, the steak wasn't quite served hot enough and the cheese sauce had a skin on top. But I still ate it and it was still yummy.

Dessert of pecan fudge, pecan/choc chip cookies, marshmallow dipped in chocolate and graham cracker crumbs, vanilla mousse-stuffed wafers, and a root beer float: This was the highlight of the meal, and I'm much more of a savory-foods than dessert-foods person.

Everyone in our group decided on the tasting menu which for the price is not that expensive (4 courses for $98 with a wine pairing for another $55). However, we upgraded our tasting menu by getting the Russian Osetra Caviar for another $75.

Our courses included the following with the wine pairing:
- Caviar Parfait (Russian Osetra) - Alderwood-smoked salmon, creme fraiche, potato cake [Veuve Cliquot Yellow Label, Champagne)
- Lobster Pot Pie - Summer vegetables, brandied-lobster cream [Louis Michel Chablis, Burgundy 2009)

- 5 different desserts including Glazed Chocolate Brownie, Root Beer Float, Sugar Cookies, Brown Sugar Wafer, and Chocoloate Bon-bon [Smith Woodhouse Vintage Port, Portugal 1999]

As far as the lobster pot pie goes...True, cooking the lobster in a pot for 18-20 minutes may make it slightly rubbery, but lobster has that texture far more than any other crustacean anyway...the flavors are amazing.  Definitely a heavy dish, which is why I shared my husband's and I just ordered a couple sides (which were great).

Fortunately (unfortunately..?), it was the latter in my case.

For being such a fancy-schmancy dining establishment, there is quite a bit of noise and hustle and bustle going on here.  The kitchen line is (mostly) open for diners to view the madness that would usually be going on behind the scenes.  Also, servers rush around performing tasks like folding your napkin (or giving you a new one) when you excuse yourself from the table for a few minutes, or cut and deconstruct your lobster pot pie for you.

Aside from the entrees, I initially found it amusing and/or ironic that the 3 course pre-fixe dinner options included such items as a foo-foo version of a quarter grilled cheese sandwich with the soup appetizer choice ($16), and a fancy root beer float ($15) for dessert.  Although quite tasty, I realized that having such items appear on a triple-figure dinner bill might actually have made the joke on me.

It was eye opening (and stomach satiating) to be introduced to such simple yet amazing food. The deconstructed tuna tar tare mixed in front of you... the lobster pot pie carefully removed from the inverted crust topping and placed on your plate in the shape of a lobster... it was all new and amazing to me. 

Now, Mina (with the help of Andre Agassi's bankroll) is spreading his awesomeness around the country with establishments such as Bourbon Steak, Nobhill Tavern, Stripsteak and his signature Michael Mina found in the old Aqua location in the Bellagio hotel. 

Remnants of Aqua are still there... the lobster pot pie and the tar tare, but I went all fois while there. The seared scallops topped with fois gras were simply decadent. The texture and cooking temperature just blew my palate. They were paired with a little bit of citrus, vanilla, and a parsnip puree. I followed that with more fois... this time on top of a fillet (not my usual cut, but the fois was sure to add a layer of fatty type richness). The beef was served on top of a potato pancake, then topped with a nice slice of fois gras and had a perigourdine sauce drizzled over top. 

My meal ended with an outstanding trio of cheeses with some atypical accompaniments like tiny marinated mushrooms and jellied pomegranate. All in all, Mina continues to please with impeccable service and remarkable food.",mCtbnY3HVLUmb91ADNPczQ,0,0,5,VF9ry-N3R7pnSE8CmmHJ2A

We were both carrying a glass of wine as we walked in (courtesy of Bellagio) and the hostess offered to carry our wine to our table for us.  From that moment on, I knew we were going to be pampered for the night.

Service:
Wonderful service.  Our server had a deep accent so it was hard to understand him at times.  I wish I was able to fully capture everything he said about the wines that we had for the night but that's not his fault by any means.  Water glasses were never empty and finished plates were picked up almost immediately.  Trips to the restroom meant newly folded napkins.  There was really nothing more that they could have done to make the evening smoother.

Food:
We both had the cookbook tasting menu and shared a wine pairing.  Everything was delicious but our favorite dish for the night was the cavier parfait.  Bff didn't like the kobe beef with foie gras but I thought it was fine.  We were both looking forward to the lobster pot pie but it wasn't as great as we had hoped.  However, overall, I really enjoyed the food.  Every dish was flavorful and well plated.  The trio of dessert topped off the night. 

Wine pairing:
I thought the sommelier did a good job pairing the dishes to the wines.  One thing I did notice was that the sommelier used more white than red wines.  Personally I prefer red over white but still thought that the pairings went well with the dishes.

Located in the beautiful themed garden of the Bellagio, the restaurant's sleek blond wood interior was both intimate and inviting.  Set against soft lighting, the dining space was conducive to a festive and celebratory evening with good friends and at first glance of the tasting menu, i was looking forward to the exciting evening ahead. 

The Breads: Warm sourdough & honey wheat rolls came out nice & hot with a side of lightly salted soft butter. The sourdough was my personal favorite with its nice buttery crust and warm chewy center.

Our party of four didn't need much coaxing as we almost instantly decided on the all inclusive chef's tasting menu with wine pairings, which included the famous lobster pot pie!  

Tuna Tartare - Fresh plump ruby red tuna prepared table side with bright vibrant colors that was definitely a sight to see!  The ancho chili and fresh mint pumped up the volume by adding a tangy zing to this remarkable dish and the pine nuts added a pleasant rustic contrast of texture and rounded out the flavor profiles nicely!

Caviar Parfait - Magnificent! Served atop airy light creme fraiche and a crisp potato cake, each bite was magical! The bubbly paired perfectly with this exquisitely enjoyable dish!

Lobster Pot Pie - Outstanding! I was anxiously anticipating this dish and i am happy to admit that it did not disappoint! As soon as the server carved away the warm golden crust, the sweet smell of buttery lobster wafted into the air and i was mesmerized! As i glanced down into my ramekin, i could see chunks of juicy lobster bathed in brandied lobster cream and it made my mouth instantly water!  I simply love pot pie and lobster has always been on my guilty pleasure list, so the combination for me was a match made in foodie heaven! 

American Kobe Rib Eye - Perfection! The kobe beef was exceptionally moist, tender and buttery! Oh, and yes, it melted in my mouth! Hot dayam, what i'd give to sink my teeth into this luscious piece of premium meat again! Let's not forget about the sides! The butter poached porcini was rich and flavorful while the creamed corn was decadence in every bite!

The tasting menu ended with several small dessert items that showcased the chef's whimsical approach to sweets including a magnificent root beer float, a cookie served with hot mulled apple cider, chocolate bon bons, chocolate chip cookies and a glazed chocolate brownie with cocoa nib ice cream & spiced pecans. 

In a few words, it was literally death by chocolate!!!....and oh what a way to die!

The wine pairings were 100% spot on compliments to our meals. With that said, our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly.  It was great having friendly conversation with everyone but still enjoy the formalities of fine dining.

Our waitress described then as ""dueling menus"" and although that may be a little stretch, it was very cool to compare his traditional menu with his more modern takes.

We started with the fish tart tart and it was delicious...melt in your mouth creamy delicious when eaten with all the flavors on the plate.  They give you table side service and mix it in for you too.  Plating at the same time for the both of us at the table.  

Then the lobster pot pie came out and looked so pretty.  They cut the crush off the top at the table then serve it too you.  The flavors were delicious.  One reason this place is not my 5 star is because our pot pie was a bit raw and not cooked through.  The huge lobster chunks in the creamy sauce was raw still...which they were more than happy to fix for us and heat it up a touch.  

We then had the American Kobe beef...which was chewy and tasty...but ok...didn't think anything special about it.  I've had more creamy and melt in yo mouth meats before ...and this was meh...but not rememorable.  My wife's piece was also a corner piece and more cooked and tough for a medium cooked piece.

Ahi tuna tar tar - this was delicious. It had a quail egg, pine nuts, tuna, and other items on it which I can't remember and the server would present it and mix all the ingredients together in front of you before I put anything in my mouth,

Now on to the food.  The dishes were good but in my opinion not great.  The Tartare of Ahi Tuna was quite tasty.  The ahi was fresh and delicate.  The asian pear and pine nuts was a nice contrast of flavors and textures.  

The world famous Lobster Pot Pie was not impressive to me.  Maybe I had a bad batch, but it was very underwhelming.  First of all the broth had too much brandy in it.  The brandy overpowered the broth.  Secondly, the vegetables inside was too crunchy and severely underdone in my opinion.

The best dish of the night was the Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass.  The fish was cooked perfectly.  It was moist, delicate, and had an outstanding flavor.  It was silky and practically melted in my mouth.

I ordered it at the urging of my boyfriend over the lobster pot pie (which the waiter told our friend was the best thing on the menu...) and was severely disappointed. It was cooked to perfection but crusted with some black trumpet crusted layer that literally tasted like dirt. 

The chilled english pea soup also was a pass... BUT the dishes that shined were absolutely awesome. Their cocktails were all delicious, the market greens salad, oysters, lobster pot pie (dream, heaven, WOW- I did end up eating 1/2 of our friends after passing on my salmon), surf and turf tasting trio of kobe ribeye beef, filet mignon with crab oscar crust, and langoustine with bone marrow, stuffed colorado lamb, opera cake, etc etc... and the platter of jello-esque squares, macaroons and whatever else was on there (I'm trying to recall) were AMAZING.

The lobster pot pie was delectable, with it's robust chunks of lobster poached in butter and topped with a puff pastry. However, it seems like any chef could put those ingredients together to be something tasty, and thus did not stand out. 

The one thing I really enjoyed was the dessert, which was a myriad of miniature takes on american classic desserts like root beer float and brownies.

Friends of mine have been to the location in San Francisco and said the food was good, but it was more about presentation(trios).

We decided to order the chilled seafood platter, which was around $75 or so--in which you get lobster, king crab legs, 3 huge shrimps, some raw clams, and raw oysters.  You also have some lemon, seaweed salad, tabasco, mignonette, and cocktail sauce.  This was pretty straight forward and tasted good, except the clams tasted a little too much like the ocean.

Following the seafood platter, I ordered the trio of Sashimi: Roots, Shoots and Fruits

    *  Fluke - Radish, Daikon Sprouts, Honeycrisp Apple
    * Snapper - Fresh Wasabi, Cilantro, Lemon
    * Hamachi - Red Beet, Sorrel, Chilled Grape 24

I thought the Hamachi was the best of the trio.  Most places go spicy, by pairing a sliced Jalapeno with Hamachi, but Michael Mina went sweet with the roasted beet.  The others weren't memorable.

Following I order the trio of Surf and Turf - American Beef & Shellfish with a glass of Bordeaux

    *  Kobe Ribeye - Grilled Lobster, Sauce Choron
    * Petit Filet - Crab ""Oscar"" Crust, Natural Jus
    * Langoustine - Bone Marrow, Langoustine ""Bordelaise"" 85

The Ribeye was well cooked and the lobster was fresh.  The Petit Filet was overcooked to a medium well(when I ordered medium rare).  The buttered lump Dungeness crab on top of the Filet was very
good and went well with the steak.  I did ask the waiter to fire up a new one, which was also a little overcooked, but understandable because the Filet portion is so thin.  The waiter was very quick and attentive in giving new steaks, great service.  The Langoustine was cooked well and the bone marrow was deep fried with a little batter.  

Overall, it was just ok, nothing really stood out and nothing was really terrible. I would recommend trying one of his preset or tasting menus, as I felt the Trios, priced similarly, weren't worth it.",ctcxi1foc550U7QFS5CV0Q,0,0,3,4YwJSs05o2m8zDZFXw8Sig

We never had the pleasure to dine at MMSF (though we went to Aqua a few times years ago).  After an infuriating experience with the guest room we decided why not make the best of where we are stuck @ (Bellagio).

We were greeted with a warm welcome and our waiter took the time to discuss what's available in the 2 tasting menus.  
We had 2 ""cookbook"" tasting and 1 ""seasonal"" tasting prix fixes.  They were flexible with substitutions.

The foie gras that topped the kobe steak can rival that of 
""Au Pied d' Cochon"" in Montreal (HEY WHERE IS YELP MONTREAL?!)
Contrary to some of the reviews by other fellow yelpers,
we found the black cod to be delicately done rather than overly marinated like other ""upscale"" restaurants tend to do.
Perhaps it's a matter of taste in my party.

We absolutely agree with Andrew K's comment about the sole being way too salty (both fish and the puree beneath it, should have read his writeup before we requested the substitution)

The waiter was quick to apologize and asked if we would entertain a reworked dish, and got our coffee and tea comp'ed for that (that's called service, compare that with the attitude @ Nobu Waikiki)

It was after I walked out of the restaurant that I realized I paid
$150 for the cookbook menu instead of $115 as posted on a placard outside the door.   Hmmmm... whats up with that??!?

I asked the manager who explained to me that $150 is for the meal with the book, and $115 for the meal without (again why did I NOT read the writeups first, shame on me).  It was an omission on the waiters part for not giving us the books (hope its not the usual Vegas practice) .

It was a classy affair where we were treated like VIP every step of the way. The elegant dining establishment is located facing the Bellagio Conservatory and Botanical Gardens.

We started with a simple offering of complimentary bread, butter, olive oil and balsamic.

For appetizer, we selected the wildly talked about Ahi Tuna Tartare (Ancho chili, sesame oil, pine nuts, Korean pear, mint, quail egg.) The dish is mixed table-side and the waitress explains each ingredient as she stirs it all up with precise artistry. The tartare tasted absolutely refreshing and delicious! I loved the crunchy texture of the pine nuts and the crisp Korean pear - the spices and sesame oil danced harmoniously together on my tastebuds.

For our entree, we loved the subtle Asian preparation of the Miso Glazed Sea Bass (Braised bok choy, Dashi Broth, Shrimp tortellini, Sautéed mushroom.) The dashi broth was incredibly rich and flavorful, without overpowering the buttery miso glazed sea bass that melted in my mouth with every bite. An excellent execution of an exotic, yet comforting dish.

For dessert, we indulged in the Mascarpone Cheesecake with Huckleberry & Vanilla streusel - a perfect ending. Very luscious and not obnoxiously sweet, which is great.

The ahi tuna tartare had a good balance of flavor and crunchy texture, having been accented with ancho chili, mint, pine nuts, and sesame oil.

Meanwhile, the American wagyu ribeye was incredibly flavorful, soft, and tender. A pumpkin tart provided a refreshing coda to a perfect progression of courses.

2811344,2015-02-01,2,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Literally one of the worst experiences I've ever had in a restaurant. My boyfriend had a conference for work and I tagged along. I thought it would be fun to treat ourselves to a lovely dinner. I have not previously eaten at a restaurant with a Michelin star. So I made reservations for 7:45 on a Friday evening. 

A wrench was thrown when my boyfriend's conference ran long and a networking event included a catered dinner. I figured we would just work it out. I arrived at 7:40 and was told it would be a few minutes so I sat at the bar. The bartender was the highlight of the evening, a very nice lady who mixed me a killer cocktail. My boyfriend soon joined me at the bar. Now, I don't mind waiting a bit for a reservation, some times these things come up. However, we were left waiting for over 30 minutes and only when I shot a look at the host like ""what is going on?"" did he come over and complain that the people already paid but haven't left yet. I thought that was unprofessional on his part. I just wanted to make sure we hadn't been forgotten about. 

Finally we were seated and our waiter came over. He says ""oh I'm told you're in a hurry tonight"". I mean, one of the first things out of his mouth. I'm assuming this came because the host was pissed that I had questioned him after waiting over 30 minutes for a reservation. It just started the meal on a bad note. My boyfriend ordered an espresso and a cocktail and I looked at the menu.

The waiter came back to drop off the drinks and I decided to order. I said that I wanted to order the signature tasting menu with the sommelier pairing. Then I said something to the effect that my boyfriend wanted to relax and enjoy his beverages before choosing something. Now, the already strained relationship between our server and myself implodes. He tells me that the whole table HAS to get the tasting menu or I cannot order it. Well my boyfriend simply cannot eat six courses after already having dinner. The waiter walks away and I'm nearly in tears. I strongly considered just leaving but my boyfriend could see how upset I was so he said we'd just buy two tasting menus and just only have them bring out one for me. 

The waiter returned and we told him what we'd like to do and then suddenly his tune changed. I guess it's a little embarrassing when your patrons are forced to pay for food that won't leave the kitchen. So he allowed me to purchase the tasting menu and my boyfriend was able to get an appetizer because ""the chef wouldn't know"". Later in the evening, he asked if he wanted more food so obviously what he told us earlier was a lie. 

As for the food, it was mediocre. I enjoyed the first course with caviar. The tuna tartare had much too much sesame oil. The sea bass was delicious. The lobster pot pie was way overrated. There was two small little morsels of lobster and they were way overcooked, like total rubber. It was not good. The steak was decent but was not served warm enough because the fat was starting to congeal. I had wanted to substitute out the apple pavlova for the pbj dessert which the waiter said I could do. However, I was still served the pbj dessert which I did not care for because I don't like pbj. 

So I spent about $400 between drinks, food, and tip. I felt like I was talked down to the whole evening and my business was not appreciated in the least. I will not be returning EVER.

In spite of the fact that they were closing for 2 weeks starting the next day, we had full service.  I do believe they were out of quail, but none of us wanted that.  We all three had the Chef's tasting menu and it was an experience we've never had before.  The tuna tartar was absolutely wonderful, with a waiter serving each of us all at the same time.  The lobster pot pie had been previously recommended by Yelp as well as other acquaintances and it was incomparable!  Our steaks were done exactly as we requested and were so delicious and tender, probably the best any of us had ever had. The dessert was the creme de la creme, to say the least.  We had at least 5 different ones to sample, with sample sizes of each, so we weren't overly sweetened (LOL!). 
     We each chose not to do the wine pairing, which now disappoints me, but my Pinot Noir from Sonoma, CA was wonderful and helped keep me from over drinking.
     The atmosphere was relaxed and simple.  Coat and tie could have been worn, but was not necessary.  Nice shirts and slacks were fine and most men were relaxed more that way.  
     The service was impeccable from beginning to end.  I've never experienced so many wait staff who were all friendly and so well trained.

Reflecting back on this experience, I have to say, I wasn't very impressed. 

Now look, I'm not saying this just to one-up anybody or anything. This is how it truly was to me, although my friend's palettes may differ. 

Our group ordered the prix fix menu. Nothing on it stood out to me. What I remember from the dish was the tater-tots which complemented the main piece was too overpowering, and the filet mignon just didn't have the taste this particular meat normally has. 

The dish we unanimously enjoyed was the foie gras...they literally gave us about five pounds of it. I've never seen so much of this ingredient in one place than I did here!

Service: 4 stars. We were greeted first by a young woman but a little later on she switched with another guy. Our server was pretty good all around but i've had better at other restaurants. I felt like he was 'just getting the job done' with our table because we look young and probably wont tip enough. Little does he know that I work at a restaurant and never tip lower than 15% !!

- Another thing that I noticed was our previous waiter talking to one of the bussers about a lady's plastic surgery. I literally saw her making faces and laughing with the busser while staring at the lady at the table next to us. The lady next to us obviously had a lot of work done but I was surprised that a server at a restaurant like Michael Mina would even do something like that in public! 

Food: 4 stars (Chef's tasting menu $100 per person)

Ahi Tuna Tartare: very tasty. they bring the plate out, present it and then mix it together for you. however i think ive had better tuna tartare at other restaurants.

So I am not a mammaluke yelper griping for no reason! I am a seasoned gastronome and formal fine dining captain of a multiple michelin star restaurants. 
So I don't yelp a lot lately but this has to be shared...
By far worst service in a fine dining restaurant ever!!! 
Reservation booked as a birthday, Maitre D' or manager who was super polite initially. walks us to table, we mention it's birthday he acknowledges as well. 
FIRST COURSE
Place food order we request that we split the  shrimp tortellini between seat # 1 and #4, and seat #2 onion soup, Captain (pathetic to give this joker that title) acknowledges 
Second COURSE.  
split mixed green salad same way seat #1 and #4. And me seat #2   will have  artichoke truffle salad. 
3rd COURSE
Lobster pot pie split between seat # 1 and #2, 2 orders lamb seat # 3 and #4 and side of beets.
Now what went wrong?
ordered 2 ice teas never came
Shrimp tortellini and mixed green salad and onion soup delivered same time not split (Btw if the kitchen doesn't split things which is respectable we were not told) I was delivered onion soup. 
What happens now??? So I have to then Eat artichoke salad by myself and feel like a gluttonous pig while no one else at the table has foood and we SPECIFICALLY order in a way to avoid this!!!!
Next the captain comes to mark our table and backhands all of us like he is working @ denny's!
Entrees arrive and lobster pot pie split on a gueridon by the captain he deliver the plates and says ""it is very hot! I should know I just touched it"" WTF u just touched my food that is disgusting!! 
Food was great! 
Oh so my water glass is empty for at least 2 minutes 
Oh and the beets never arrived?
oh and we ordered dessert and there was no candle
OH no one ever checked on any of courses???? 
Oh our table was never crumbed?
Oh ya when we left there was no manager around or maitre d? To tell this too that is why I yelp which is so lame.
IN CONCLUSION
Great food lobster pot pie still one of my all time faves incredible.   
Service TERRIBLE what an f'ing AHOLE of a captain screwed up every course and never checked on anything. Pathetic service not worthy of any restaurant I'm disgusted!!!!!

We had party of 10 in a 30 % full restaurant on a Thursday evening in  September. My starter was scallops, hard to describe exactly what was in it because there was alot going on but the taste and quality was sublime. My main was 12oz New York steak with all 4 sides to share. Steak perfectly cooked and rested, served on a hot plate with no juice on the plate, all in the meat. Nicely seasoned and tender. The sides of patato mash and peas and carrots were the best I have ever had. Cream corn was too salty and the seasonal squash was good. 

Service was as expected in this level of restaurant. Perfect timing and teamwork. Everything was always topped up and available without us asking.

We planned our usual big Vegas dinner and made a reservation via Open Table. We had a short wait for our table to be prepared upon checking in, and decided to order some wine at the bar. They have a cool iPad with their wine list and the bartender was helpful in navigating it. The sommelier advised on a few bottles once we expressed our preferences, and we selected a bottle of white just as we were whisked away to our table. Our dining companions ordered their own bottle, and we were greeted by our server and brought bread and water immediately.
Bread is served in individual little rolls directly to your plate from a busboy--fancy.
Our group of four enjoyed a few appetizers (hubby and I split the lobster ravioli and enjoyed it immensely) and then on to the main course. Our group had the lobster pot pie, the Japanese fish trio, I had the sole, and hubby had a fish I can't remember. The lobster pot pie presentation was really impressive and all of our dishes were delicious.
We didn't have room for dessert but had some espresso before heading out for a night on the town.
Our server was attentive and polite, if a bit overbearing (but that tends to go with the style of the establishment) and everything we tasted was executed well.
The only reason I don't see Michael Mina as 5 stars is just that is lacks that little spark that makes fine dining truly special. Everything is done very, very well and the quality is exceptional, but there's nothing truly outstanding or distinguishing about the cuisine or the restaurant. 
I would definitely return, but not until I try the rest of the fine dining establishments Vegas has to offer.

I assumed they thought we were just kids  and not big tippers (asians look younger than they really are), but we were all past our mid twenties and we had enough money.  After 15 minutes of us chatting, we had to request for our menus.   We finally ordered, each an appetizer & entree.  I had the trio sashimi, ahi tuna, and a glass of wine.  I recommend both dishes.

3019833,2017-01-17,2,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"It's very difficult to rate this place just three stars, but I'm afraid that some dishes simply fell flat. 

It all started with an exceptionally decadent Pacific Sturgeon Parfait with alderwood-smoked salmon, crème fraîche atop a shallot potato cake. This is perhaps one of the saxiest bites you could have in Vegas without worrying about someone else finding out. That being said the next dish, Tartare of Ahi Tuna with asian pear, pine nuts, and scotch bonnet infused sesame oil fell absolutely flat. The tuna had no flavor and none of the other ingredients did anything to help it stand up. Moving forward with the meal, the third dish of Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with a shellfish dumpling, and dashi broth was a beautifully crafted and cooked seafood delight. It was just a tad underseasoned and perhaps a minute overcooked, but nonetheless quite good. 

Of course the dish that everyone comes here for is the Lobster Pot Pie with seasonal baby vegetables, in brandied-lobster cream topped with puff pastry. At first glance and smell, my mouth was truly watering, but as I began to dig in, I quickly realized that the lobster was grossly overcooked and the pastry wasn't quite cooked enough. It is a very rich dish and just a few spoon fulls of the sauce is enough to make you full. But this was only dish 4 of 6.

I present to you the second best dish of the night, American Wagyu Ribeye topped with hudson valley foie gras, in a pinot noir reduction. There is very little that I can say about this dish as it really needs to be experienced. The steak was cooked to perfection and so was the foie gras. The sauce had just the right amount of seasoning and velvety mouthfeel. The only thing was left to do was to have dessert. 

Although I wasn't overly impressed by the Peanut Butter Bar and chocolate crémeux, with candied peanuts, I did end up finishing it. Realizing somewhere halfway in that it was quite sweet and needed something tart to cut through it. 

The service was good, the wine list is enormous and one would be well advised to really know their wines when choosing something here as they are priced more by recognizable names rather than actual worth; the experience was nice, but nowhere near exceptional.",e3-W6kzr0xaUDKX4Onj_aw,6,3,3,Wd7noYtZ_ZNCZg1TRphQVA

First course 

Caviar parfait  - I would say that this is one of his signature dishes. Layers of flavor with a lot of depth. 

Second course 

Hamachi - the fresh fish really cut through the richness of the yuzu aioli. I thought the dish was well balanced. 

Third course 

Japanese a5 steak - the marbling on the cut really made the meat melt in my mouth. For you carnivores and steak conoussiers this cut is a must have

To start with, it's a bit out of the way. you have to walk through all the shops and the entire Bellagio Casino to get there. We came from Caesars which in theory should not be that far but it took us about 20 minutes to walk there. 

When we got there, they let us know they had a fixed menu since it was a holiday (Valentine's Day) it was $145 per person which was a little more than what I would have ordered from their regular menu, but again, I was ok with it because I was expecting sensational food. 
 
The meal was a seven course meal which took entirely too long between courses. I know they were busy, but it was about 20 minutes between courses, and dinner took 3 plus hours. It was uncomfortable to sit for that long. We were so tired of sitting and waiting that we were tempted to leave before the main course - which was strip steak.  (It was really good by the way - I would probably give it an 7/10). 

The lobster pot pie that everyone raves about was just ok. It wasn't bad, but I was expecting something better and it was very rich. Combined with the very rich caviar parfait and the muse, and oyster soup that was also part of the dinner, it was WAY too much richness, in fact, by the time I got to the pot pie I could barely eat any because my stomach couldn't handle all that rich food. It needed something lighter and more acidic to break it up. The whole meal was just too heavy. 

All in all we spent about $400 with drinks and gratuity, and for the money it wasn't worth it. 

Do yourself a favor and go across the street to Paris @ Gordon Ramsay Steak. We ate there the next night. It was half the price and much better!",VLA7uiCqWAj5C3OEmj805g,1,0,2,R8SxCKSsro51Gx9TcFG7Hg

However, I chose to go over the top (at least in my books) with a dinner reservation at Michael Mina last week and had the most delightful meal in my gastronomic career.

My fiance and I wanted to celebrate perhaps our last nice really nice meal before we get married in 3 wks and chose this restaurant after the wonderful reviews on Yelp.  I called the same day and was able to get a 7:30 reservation on Thursday evening.  

Service was amazing.  The Brazilian server (Marco) knew my name before I even sat down.  He knew were were celebrating and offered me a complimentry glass of champagne which I declined - because I needed to stay sober for our 10:30 show, ""O"".

However, we still proceeded to order two tastings.  Aside from the A La Carte menu - there are two tasting menus.

1.  Classis Michale Mina dishes $115
2.  Seasonal dishes $115
Premium wine pairing $65 on top.

We order exactly that and love almost every dish.

I won't bother with all the details with the meal since it appears that everyone else has done so, but the hamachi from the seasonal offering was incredible.  Just a big party in my mouth!  So many flavors and textures coming together.

Also not to miss - the lobster pot pie..OMG, I love truffles and this was so aromatic.  The American Kobe with seared Foie Gras, I can taste the marbled meat in my mouth..just MELTS.  

Not extremely impressed with the cod or the salmon but they were still very yummy.

It was seared on the outside and what i did not expect was how soft and moist it was inside. It felt like I was eating fish fat because it was so smooth except that it was not fish fat. It was fish! 

That magical sea bass was part of the Three Seas of Fish entree that I got. The other two fish pieces were the seared Hawaiian tuna and scallop. That entree was basically an interpretation of Japanese cuisine and reinterpreted into Michael Mina's version without losing any of its authenticity. The tuna tartare was also very delicious and it is mixed up together in front of you at the table. The shellfish platter which is commonly ordered as an appetizer is substantial enough that it could be an entree in itself. Some creative flair is definitely shown in the shellfish platter e.g. scallop ceviche served with fresh popcorn. We came to Michael Mina not knowing what to expect except from knowing that it has a Michelin star and the food impressed us in many ways.

Our server was nothing short of professional, helpful, and friendly. In fact, I think he should moonlight as a part time photographer when he is not working at Michael Mina. At the end of the meal, my husband and I asked our server if he could help us take a photograph. We didn't know what we were in for. After we handed him our camera, he proceeded to rearrange the items on our table so that they would look nicer in the photograph and he temporarily removed some ""ugly"" items on the table (our table's check), etc. After the first shot, he walked over to the other side and suggested us to hold hands over the table (which emitted some laughter from the table next to us although I think they laughing at our server and not my husband and I) for the second shot. And then finally he wanted to take a third shot of us and suggested my husband to stand by my chair. LOL. Our server was cute. Gotta love him.

Fourth course, the one I was looking forward to... the kobe beef w/ foie gras. I was in heaven. Not over cooked and the foie gras was seared and prepared perfectly.  Finally came the desserts.

3135788,2015-01-07,9,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"I think Michael Mina is a fitting first review for 2015. There are so many things to love about Michael Mina's location, understated decor and staff and of course the food. It is after all a Michelin star and a AAA 4 diamond  rated restaurant. It was a very special family occasion and celebration that brought us to MM. 

There are several ways to approach a high brow dining establishment like MM and clearly the tasting menu let's you check all of the culinary boxes. Small bites of their best fare served at a measured pace heightens the anticipation and allows you to truly savor each bite. It's not all that easy if you are super hungry so be prepared. Your hunger may actually increase after the first few small plates.  
Surprisingly there was no amuse bouche which is usually standard at a restaurant such as MM.  The bread and rolls would have to tide us over. 
They offer several seasonal tasting menu options and parings, and the 4 of us mixed and matched and shared  a little bit of everything.  

Case in point, the first course,  pure perfection in a barely more than a single bite.

The dining room was spacious and well lit which helped with my picture taking on my iPhone. Service was fantastic and I liked how they recite the dishes to you when it's served.

We ordered the cookbook tasting menu which was quite delicious overall, but damn were we stuffed. 

First: Tartare of ahi tuna was delicious! I loved the sesame oil and pine nuts mixed in for texture. It was my favorite dish of the evening. Fresh and fun.

Second: Maine lobster pot pie was amazing! The waiter cuts off the top of the pie for you, so you can dig into the huge chunks of lobster and veggies. Creamy and delicious, this was the BF's fave, and my second fave.

Third: Miso glazed Chilean sea bass was next and I liked it very much. It was soft, flaky and sat in this dashi broth accompanied with a shellfish dumpling. Exquisite. 

Fourth: American Kobe ribeye was a bit of a disappointment. Too chewy and a bit salty, not really either one of our favorites. 

Sixth: Trio of Desserts was the final course. Thank goodness because we were about to burst. The root beer float was charming and I liked the chocolate straw it came with. Coconut cheesecake was decent, and the opera cake was way too sweet for my taste. Overall, dessert was not very impressive.

We also had a couple glasses of Riesling each. After all that food, I certainly did not feel the buzz. However, the wine was just the right amount of sweetness. 

I would come back here in the future, as long as I try not to eat anything the entire day.

The presentation was as good as the food tasted. My girlfriend took on the seafood dishes while I handled the meat dishes.

We started with the shell fish appetizer which had a variety of samplings which were wonderful. We ordered a steak/lobster tail per couple, to be shared, for dinner. We thought that with the two sides that we ordered - mushroom risotto and brussel sprouts - we would be just full enough. When the meal arrived the lobster wasn't there. We asked the waiter and he advised that they were out of lobster AT 6 IN THE EVENING!  I asked he waiter why he didn't mention this before the meal arrived, as we may have changed our order. He had no answer, but apologized.

Now, to be fair, the steak was good. Not amazing as expected, but it was fine. The sides we delicious, but we never did really rebound from our disappointment over not having lobster at a restaurant known for its seafood. The worse part is that when we left there were several people eating lobster!!!!!

I've eaten here a few times with my wife and even once with my family when I have eaten at Las Vegas. It's absolutely fantastic.

This restaurant is located in the Bellagio hotel. The restaurant is owned by Michael Mina who is a very popular chef and I've seen him on TV sometimes (Food Network, Hells Kitchen, etc.) I believe he owns a number of restaurants.

Hubby is the winner with his starter: Tartare of Tuna mixed (at the table by the server) with sesame oil, toasted pine nuts, garlic, and chiffon of mint. OMFG. It's on my list of things I'd like at my last meal.

Honestly, everything else was just good/ok from there on out. The lobster potpie was disappointing (after reading reviews), the John Dory was ok, the butter-poached Maine Lobster was yummy, I will say.

3253922,2009-12-01,1,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Disappointing does not begin to describe my experience at MM Vegas.
Let me preface this review by saying I am a HUGE Mina fan. I've dined many times at both Stonehill Tavern (Monarch Beach) and XIV (Los Angeles), and have flown to San Francisco on more than one occasion  for the sole purpose of devouring plates of Mina's fantasmic creations. 

We came here for a late dinner after seeing a show. We had had an AMAZING meal -- more like experience -- at Alex (Wynn) the night before, so I was looking forward to continuing the good times. First off, decor. ""Understated"" to some = Boring Bob to me. ""Cozy"" to others = ""Where is the other half of the restaurant?"" to me. This was, after all, Vegas. 

The menu...*yawn*. Everything on the cookbook and a la carte menus was way too familiar -- nothing new or creative. Two of the items on the seasonal tasting menu seemed interesting, but there was a noticeable absence of a trio dish (MM's signature), which my friend wanted to try. I looked at my watch and it was 9:30 pm, which was too late for a course meal (walking into a club, expanded tummy from course meal = so NOT cute), so I agreed to order a few dishes a la carte.

Amuse bouche: Truffle mousse with pear. 2 stars.

Bread: Wheat roll and sourdough. Boris boringballs. 

Tuna tartare: I've had this dish a million times (MM SF, Stonehill, slightly different version at XIV) and a million times I've loved it. Here, the presentation was the same, the taste was NOT. It was lacking seasoning -- I had to ask for sea salt (I rarely ever do this). 

Market salad: Good. Nothing mind blowing (I didn't expect this from a salad anyways).

Miso-glazed sea bass: This dish was served with small squash balls which had been sitting in a freezer. How did I know this? They were cold. Like, awkwardly COLD. I didn't even bother telling the waiter (more on this later). The accompanying dumpling, simply put, was gross. The bass was good, a little salty. I finished half of the dish.

Surf and Turf Trio: Kobe and lobster were pretty standard, as were the crab and filet. Langoustine had a foul taste. 

Dessert: Never even got to see a menu (keep reading).

Now, the service. I'd received anything but remarkable service at MM restaurants prior to this meal; here, the service was liken that to which you would expect to receive at an IHOP. Before I get into any more detail, I want to point out that there wasn't a lack of waitstaff around the restaurant. There were at least seven servers near the kitchen, talking amongst themselves during the entire meal. Still, I never got my water refilled. Not once. In fact, I ordered another bottle of sparkling water, and PAID for it, but never got a drip of it. On top of that, I stared at dirty plate after dirty plate up until the moment the next one arrived. In fact, our entree plates were still sitting at out table when we left the restaurant. This is a HUGE peeve of mine. Once my table finishes a course, I will wait up to five minutes (it's much longer than it seems), before I start to get antsy. Here, we waited over FIFTEEN minutes after we finished our main course, before I threw in the towel and just asked for the check. The most ridiculous part: the manager, a semi-bald man wearing a bad suit, brought over the bill and a small plate of complementary dessert (this is custom at MM restaurants) and sat it down on our tables, right next to our dirty plates. This behavior from an inept waiter I can grasp my head around, but from a manager? Needless to say, we didn't touch the dessert plate and left.",9Yq-WcBfBsz75cPWdJ_9jg,1,1,1,cOhrvP8YjtEcHewGWH4ecA

Pacific Sturgeon Caviar Parfait - a refined caviar starter with depth of flavors, so divinely good. I wish it was bigger in portion. I could easily eat 3 of these!

Tartare of Ahi Tuna - a twist on the classic french beef tartare. Good portion. A more subtle taste which bridged the first and the third course perfectly. 

Miso-glazed Chilean Sea Bass - the flavor of this combo is straight-forward but also one of my favorite course of the night. The shellfish dumpling is an delightful touch. LOVE.

Lobster Pot Pie - Their famous lobster pot pie....hmmm. I wonder why it is. Really not a fan. This is actually my least favorite course of the night. When it first came out, the pot pie was under-cooked so we had to send it back. Then they brought out the full entree size to replace this course for us. We're grateful for the gesture but with a liberal amount of that brandied-lobster cream, it is just way too overpowering. I could neither taste any hint of truffle nor enjoy the natural sweetness of the main lobster. I also wished they would've saved this dish for last since the heaviness really just overpowered the next course.

American Wagyu Ribeye Rossini - another favorite course of the night. I wish they had served this one before the lobster pot pie so I could enjoy the wonderful flavor-layering of the foie gras and wagyu beef to its fullest.

Rocky Road Profiterole - a great dessert for chocolate lovers. Although I'm not one of them I still enjoyed the mini-size root beer float. What a cute idea!",dM7lGhMnhuFvg0p9xZYu6w,0,0,4,QU0nCGDB1WOJ2slMpma3eQ

The broth was super rich and you could dip the bread into the broth. I got a big lobster tail piece in the pie with cream broth. 

Wagyu and Foie Gras 5 Star
What combination can be better than this? The fatty foie gras melted on steak and created this really great flavor. The steak was cooked to medium rare but still tasted a little over cooked so I think foie gras could create great kick of moisture to the beef. I really enjoyed this dish too.

Caviar Parfait 4 Star
Hoestly I did not try much caviar so I was expecting caviar to be a little fishy smell. However, the flavor of caviar here definitely impressed me. The taste and texture just match each other so well that I forget I was eating caviar. They have this salty taste which added so much flavor to the parfait. There was this crunchy texture that I like, I guess it was the potato cake, 

Ahi Tuna Tartare 4 Star
There was this running egg yolk in the middle of the ahi tuna. The waiter mixed the ahi tuna for us and I smelled this great sesame oil smell right away. The ahi tuna was fresh and delicious. There was also pine nuts in the ahi tuna to create a cool texture to the tender tuna. I like this dish but It is just not as unique as other dishes I tried. 

Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with broth 5+++++ Star
This was my favorite of the night. The sea bass got this sweetness because of miso. It was also super tender and fresh. The dashi broth was so delicious and even the bok choy has the great flavor of the broth. I also enjoyed the sea bass a lot. The buttery sea bass literally melted in my mouth. The broth and the sea bass just compliment each other so well. 

Dessert ( Root Beer Floats, Fresh Baked Chocolate Chip Cookies, Chocolate Mousse) 4 Star
The mousse was a little bitter. I love the root beer float. Since root beer itself already tasted great. I was really full at that point but I still enjoyed the dessert a lot. They also gave us free chocolates for anniversary!
 
They also have complimentary bread but don't eat too much so you can save your stomach for great food! Thank you Michael Mina for giving me extraordinary dining experience.",jl9c3cv0kxy62E8NL7pnzA,11,7,5,filX5qotb3OyvWic8GMNDA

The food was decent. Waitstaff decent. 

The thing I do remember is the snotty teenage girl that was their ""hostess"", this place was not even a quarter full, and she tried her hardest not to seat us by a window as requested. We finally got seated at a window table after talking to an assistant manager. 

His excuse for her behavior was ""we get important regulars who want tables by the window"". I guess their money is better than mine, my mistake. 

By the time we were finished with our tasting menu and signed for the bill, we looked around and found that the restaurant was only half full.

3332601,2017-05-06,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"This review is for 4.5 stars. 

Let me just put this out there - the food is phenomenal. Artistically prepared and portioned well in the 6 course tasting where you come out stuffed and yet get a full glimpse into the chef's repertoire. 

I had the signature tasting and the person I was with tried the veggie tasting. We began with a bottle of wine as well. The meal began with wheat and sourdough rolls which were fine, though I was disappointed that we were not given the typical pre-dinner course at most tasting restaurants. 

The veggie courses included beets, asparagus salad, tomato soup, pasta, Japanese plate, and an apple pie. Of the plates, the tomato soup really stood out. Poured in front of you onto fresh bread, tomato, and even marshmallow, this was a great dish. The pasta was also very tasty with a nice lemon breeze to the dish. The main course, the Japanese, underwhelmed a bit as it was more fusion tofu with a tonkatsu taste rather than authentic as expected. Still every dish was fine. 

The signature tasting is what you come to Michael Mina for. The dishes included caviar parfait, tuna tartare, fish, lobster pot pie, wagyu with foie gras, and a smore with root beer float. This tasting will get you stuffed for sure. You will taste some of the best ingredients presented with a French flair. This tasting really is exceptional so each dish deserves an explanation. The parfait came with a salmon and cream cheese base with caviar on top. Eaten together the warm was of the salmon with the cold caviar was fantastic. The tuna tartare was crafted in front of you and had a very nice Asian taste that adds to the typical raw tartare you see at most restaurants. The fish was a pass as it was simply a breaded variety of fish. The lobster pot pie is what the restaurant is known for. Very interesting dish that is worth ordering as you won't find this anywhere else. The fact that a mini version of the flagship dish is included in the tasting while the main dish is $85 on its own (albeit 5x larger) makes the tasting worth it. The wagyu beef and foie gras was the best dish for me. Perfectly cooked meat, melt in your mouth foie gras, and plenty going on on the plate. Fantastic main dish. The dessert was actually quite surprising as the smore wasn't a typical graham cracker model but rather burned into a caramelized igloo. Solid choice if looking for a shareable dessert. In order, the wagyu dish was best, followed by the tartare, lobster pot pie, parfait, smore, and the fish taking the rear for the main courses. But 5/6 were fantastic which is rare on the tasting menus. 

My main qualm was the wait staff. This sometimes happens at the higher end restaurants in Vegas where 1 waiter gets 10+ diners in his area while another gets about 3. So we never see our waiter and then we see the other standing around all meal long. Also, our waiter really ambushed us with the menus in the beginning and didn't bring our bottle of wine until the first dish was served which was poor on him. Our wine also had some issues and had to be traded out for a different bottle and we were not given an apology or discount or anything just a new bottle 15 minutes later. 

For the price of $128 for the signature and $99 for the vegetarian, it's an affordable upscale destination restaurant in Las Vegas. The signature menu really takes care of the entire menu and showcases all of the best parts of Michael Mina's cuisine.  This is a great restaurant food wise but I think their customer service could use some work when it comes to making the customer feel wanted in the restaurant. The total meal is about a 2.5 hour experience with the tasting but that's what you want when you go for an event type of dinner like this. Definitely worth a go if you want a great tasting meal but you don't want to drop more than $250 per person.",JaqcCU3nxReTW2cBLHounA,3,0,4,m5dcXlmtbkukUS1HU3MCWg
3333128,2013-03-11,4,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"This restaurant actually serves a very useful purpose in the hierarchy of restaurants at the Bellagio:  Where do you take someone if you do not want to spend the money on a Prime, Le Cirque, or Picasso and are perfectly satisfied into tricking your guest into thinking they had a great meal?  I think I and the gentleman sitting next to me (with a young lady who definitely was not his daughter) would agree:  Michael Mina!  At Michael Mina, you can toss around words like ""foie gras,"" ""truffles,"" ""lobster,"" and ""market price,"" and actually come out devoid of any semblance of a positive culinary experience.

To be fair, the dinner started well enough with the Hudson Valley Foie Gras ($27) appetizer--a bigger piece of foie gras than I expected that was cooked just right and combined nicely with the pear and medjool dates.  From there, however, things took a turn for worst:  The truffles in the Truffle Risotto (MP at $38) did not add anything to the dish, and the risotto itself did not have much or any depth of flavor to it.  The chestnut sauce at the bottom was okay but not enough to revive you from death by blandness.  Perhaps the only saving grace is that you can say ""Hey, these are like the truffles I see on Anthony Bourdain or other food shows!""  Hence, my hypothesis on Michael Mina was born.

But any hypothesis needs testing before becoming a theory.  Enter the Michael Mina signature Lobster Pot Pie (MP at $85)--lobster and vegetables cooked inside a crust, which is then opened and rearranged into the shape of a lobster on your plate.  Indeed, either the ""lobster"" or ""market price"" tag proved too much for the aforementioned young lady to resist.  While intriguing in name, the only thing I gathered from tasting this dish is that ""pot pie-ing"" is one of the worst ways one can prepare a lobster.  The meat ended up tough and rubbery and all traces of the delicate sweetness of the lobster were fully eradicated.

The Dessert Sampler ($15) was slightly better, but not by much.  The Mascarpone Cheesecake was very good, but the intense tartness of the Passion Fruit Panna Cotta was difficult to bear.  The Root Beer Float (much like the Lobster Pot Pie) proved to be more an interesting name rather than a particularly good dessert, but at least the accompanying chocolate chip cookies were better than average.

The restaurant décor was not anything special, though it was a bonus to be able to see some of the preparation and staging in the open kitchen.  Service was solid, perhaps more casual then the other Bellagio fine dining establishments, but I thought that fit the mood of the restaurant along with the clientele.",kHGRDaZt4nHgNSJcjOTDeQ,2,0,2,tlZ3dRuVAHac_NGZLnEPiQ

""What?! I need to do this for Yelp!""  I hissed back, pulling out my pink camera out of my purse. 

I did a quick scan around the room. Yup. I'll be the only dorky looking tourist here. (These Vegas peeps think they're just cool like that)

I highly anticipated my meal to be absolutely flawless at this location, since my meal at SF last year proved to be just that.  Hence, the camera.  

We didn't plan on dining at MM, but we accidentally came across a sign for restaurant week and Mina offering $50.09 prix fixe menu for dinner.  I was ecstatic!  

Guess what's on the menu?

Tuna Tartare.  It's  #19 on 7 x 7 Magazine's Big Eat SF list.  

On with the food review:

For the first course, we both had the tuna tartare.  Chopped tuna topped with quail egg, toasted pine nuts, garlic bits, mint chiffonade,  lightly drizzled with sesame oil.  This is mixed tableside. May I just say, that tuna was definitely sashimi grade, buttery soft and the flavors complement the fish in wonderful ways.

For my entree, I opted for the miso glazed cod, since I was craving for fish.   Steamed cod that flakes off beautifully, al dente soba noodles, crisp microgreens and delicately flavored mushroom dashi.  What doesn't work for me is that the mushroom flavor was so light, to the extent of being bland.  If you're ordering this entree on its own, the $43 price tag is not worth it.

The bf chose the lobster pot pie.  Be aware that even with the prix fixe menu, the pot pie is an extra $25 (compared to $35 in SF).   The pot is brought over to your table and plated expertly while you anxiously lick your lips waiting for that first bite.  Alas, the lobster is overcooked, the crust on the crispy side and the cream sauce sparse.  (while SF's version is generously adorned in sauce.)

Dessert was a joyous celebration of a comforting American favorite: the rootbeer float.  It's housemade and paired with warm chewy chocolate chip cookies and boy, it's a winner. The Madjari Chocolate cake with plump blackberries, sweet lavender chips and refreshing pinot grape sorbet was delightful as well.

It was busy that night but timing of the dishes were well-paced, thanks to the kitchen staff.  Excellent service and knowledgeable sommelier.  Of course, champagne was the appropriate choice for my upcoming birthday.  On that note, I got to blow out my birthday candle with complimentary strawberry and neopolitan gelees, but didn't feel so special as the other tables got the same thing minus the candle. 

Not quite perfect, Mina. But I'm still a fan.",Z88N6qly3Dp5C06XbZ9IMQ,27,27,4,FZCtsAGXrQP5XA4MXiFQLA
3389811,2014-07-12,5,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"We have been on a mission to try all the michelin star restaurants possible in the U.S.We were about to try Joel Robuchon's again this trip for our anniversary dinner, but decided to try something new. Michael Mina's restaurant is located in Bellagio where the botanical gardens is, next to the cafe.

Ambiance: I am not sure what the theme is, but I didn't really like the interior/atmosphere of the restaurant. It was so plain and boring, needs more color or something. I did like our table though with a good view of the open kitchen. Sometimes I wonder if the chefs think it's annoying w/ me staring in awe at their cooking hahah.

We got started off w/ bread and we're used to michelin star restaurants having multiple selection of breads, but here at Michael Mina's...you only get one. It was a really cold, dry, and plain piece of dinner roll. I had to ask our waiter for a new warmed one. The butter here isn't that great either. I was starting to get a bad feeling of the place already just from this first impression.

Appetizers:
Wagyu short rib ravioli - the first time it was undercooked, but the second time around it was better. you couldn't really tell it was wagyu short rib though.

Domestic Caviar Parfait - ALDERWOODSMOKED SALMON, CRÈME FRAîCHE, SHALLOT POTATO CAKE. All the ingredients were in symphony within the first bite. The shallot potato cake really adds texture to it. The caviar taste wasn't as strong which was good for me

DOMESTIC CAVIAR & WHITE ASPARAGUS - If you love black caviar, then get this, but I wasn't a fan of this app at all. Caviar was really strong and the whole app tasted really fishy

Tartare of Ahi Tuna - It was prepared table side as the server mixed together the tartare. I loved the fusion of asian pear and toasted sesame oil w/ the tartare. The toast was nice and crispy to eat with the tartare. 

Hamachi Sashimi - The best appetizer we got! The yuzu vinaigrette was light and refreshing. The sashimi was cut beautifully and really fresh. Presentation was beautiful. Highly recommend this appetizer

Seaweed & Pepper Crusted Ahi Tuna - The ahi tuna was seared perfect and the pepper didn't overpower the flavors. Between this and the hamachi, I would say get the hamachi. 

Entrees:
Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass - As always, sea bass is our fav and so we got this. I expected more from this dish..Only some parts of the sea bass had that buttery richness to it. The dashi broth didn't overpower the miso and it wasn't too salty.

Butter Poached Maine Lobster - SPINACH & RICOTTA RAVIOLI, CITRUS BROWN BUTTER YEAAAA BUDDY. I love my lobster and this dish was presented flawlessly. The ravioli was cooked perfect al dente, I liked it a lot better than the wagyu ravioli (this says a lot coming from someone who's basically a carnivore). The lobster was cooked to perfection as well

LOBSTER POT PIE - A lot of people were ordering this so we had to get it. The server brings it out to the table and cuts off the top of the pot pie for you. I really liked this dish with the lobster cream. Wasn't too heavy and there were plenty of lobster pieces in the pot pie. The pastry was flaky as we expected

American Wagyu Ribeye ""ROSSINI"" - HUDSON VALLEY FOIE GRAS, PINOT NOIR REDUCTION. YUMM MUST ORDER!! The wagyu ribeye was cooked to a beautiful glistening medium rare. There was truffle on it and the foie gras added that kick. Very tender ribeye

Copper Ridge Natural Veal Loin - Foie Gras Farro was delicious with the veal. The veal was really tender and not dry at all. I did prefer the wayu ribeye, but the veal loin is a must order as well. It was lean & tasty

Dessert:
Michael's root beer float - It's a root beer float w/ choc chip & nut cookies. The float comes w/ this cute chocolate straw that you sip out of then at the end, you eat it :) It was just regular root beer float to me, nothing special. The cookies however, were warm, crispy, and not to sweet. Very comforting

Lincoln's Candy Bar - This was our favorite dessert. Reminded me of a snickers bar, but more high end. The Valrhona chocolate went well w/ the pretzel & peanuts.

Passion Fruit Panna Cotta - avocado, citrus, and coconut-lime sorbet. Who knew avocado would be so good w/ dessert? This was a lighter dessert, not bad for those who like panna cotta

Cheesecake - It was our anniversary and what I liked most was that instead of just one anniversary dessert, the restaurant provided both of us w/ our own anniversary plate of cheesecake! That's the first time a restaurant has done that. I really liked the cheesecake, it was light and wasn't as heavy as cheesecake factory. The graham cracker crust was crumbly and not too sweet.

I had the Tuna tarter to start, when was served with Pear, Mint and pinenuts... I tried replicating it myself at home and I will say,I appreciated that theirs had a cleaner more refined taste and each piece was balanced and perfect.

It's like a symphony of food rising until the end and then desert as the perfect finish.  However, having eaten at the Michael Mina in SF and having eaten here, I have to say the service at the SF location was far superior.  That's not to say it wasn't good here.  But it seemed like the staff at the SF location had just the right amount of attention - they noticed when we enjoyed a specific wine pairing more than others and made sure to offer a second glass.  Then the waiter, seeing that we were about ready to leave, actually went out and flagged a cab down for us and held it until we were all ready to walk out the door.  Similar service has happened in SF each of the 4 times I've been.
This experience is what made me fall in love with the Michael Mina group of restaurants.

However, it seemed like the staff at the location in Las Vegas, just weren't up to that level.  We waited a good 10+ minutes before seeing someone.

We originally made a 6:30pm reservation on a Saturday night but had to push the time later on to 8:30pm.  The restaurant was kind enough to accommodate a later time for us.  The server who took care of us was extremely friendly and highly experienced at serving on a timely manner.   I have no complaints when it comes to their superb service and food quality.  I was hoping that this would turn out to be a 5 star dining experience but after reviewing the tasting menu, all six of us were not at all excited to try it.  We had no other choice but to opt for the Porterhouse for two people.  

If I thought that everyone would end up ordering steak, I would've suggested going to an actual steakhouse.  Reluctantly we all got the steak and hoped for the best.   We also ordered the Foie Grais appetizer along with Lobster Ravioli.  Both were super delicious and I strongly recommend starting off your dinner with those two appetizers.   We also ordered the foie grais fried rice to go with our steak.  I can eat this everyday!  Highly recommended and must order dish!  

The bread basket had an assortment of both slightly sweet and savory breads.  They were mediocre and no one really enjoyed the bread basket.  We expected better tasting bread.  

The steak came with a variety of vegetables on the side.  The servers would cut about three pieces and serve it on your plate.  The rest were sitting inside an oval pan.  We were super hungry and everyone was in a rush to eat their meal.  I like my porterhouse steak from Mastro's compared to Michael mina's.  If the tasting menu had better choices, I would've ordered that instead.  Afterall, I was looking forward to trying the tasting menu.  Ordering steak was never on my mind prior to looking at the menu.  Even the other a la carte options didn't sound all that great.   Maybe in the future I'll give this place another try. 

What we LOVED about this place was their famous Root beer float with cookie dessert.   I really don't like root beer but the pastry chef here really did a great job creating this masterpiece!  Both the drink and the cookies were just melt in your mouth yumminess!

The caviar supplement was excellent. Although I would have preferred slightly more caviar on it. The desserts were WAY too sweet. I like real Patisserie type french desserts and this had too much sugar. When the sugar takes over the flavor versus bringing the flavors OUT of the dessert it is too much. We had the root beer float and the chocolate pudding which was more like a VERY thin creme brulee'. The wait staff were excellent. If I had to go somewhere again I would head back to L'atelier Robechard. Its at the MGM. That place definitely earns their ratings.",1s-60-WqDgsVkY0Agsc-Wg,0,0,3,qnS3Yty865udaUcEV7ttGA

We saw the signs for Michael Mina and kept passing up the restaurant. Between the stupid water fountain show and the flower garden it can be a challenge to find this restaurant.  We arrived and there was no seating unless one had a reservation but we where welcomed to eat at the bar.  We took that chance and started looking over the menu.

I started off with the Black Mussel Soufflé Saffron Chardonnay Cream for the main course I had the Maine Lobster Pot Pie with Baby Carrots, Fingerling Potatoes, Black Truffles.   I have never had a savory souffle and this was just decadent. OH MY GOD.  The saffron sprigs where swimming in the chardonnay cream sauce. I poured that sauce all over the souffle.  Every bight was a savory cloud of mussel, saffron, cream and goodness.  The lobster pot pie had a 2lb lobster and the waiter presented this dish very elegant and with such manor.  The lobster was perfectly tender with a light cream sauce and lots of veggies.  So worth the $80.00.  The bartender Anthony was very informative about the restaurant and choices of wines.  He was busy with a tipsy bunch of people and in the process failed to ask for my drink order so he comped me a martini.

Being I am from the Bay Area and have never set foot into Michael Mina's restaurant here I would definitely give it a try and check out more of his great dishes.

Just not up to par with other fine dining experiences I've had. Also--we were there on a Saturday night and really looking forward to the meal. Most of the other guests were dressed nicely but one couple seated near us was wearing ripped jeans, dumpy tank tops, etc. This is fine dining, people! Does Michael Mina not enforce a dress code?

For this trip I sampled Sage, Aquaknox and Michael Mina. All my meals were delicious but dinner at Michael Mina was the best. 

My friend and I both had the tasting menu (always the way to go when it's a new spot). They have more than one tasting menu, I went for the signature, it features 6 phenomenal courses. It would be hard to pick a favorite but the lobster pot pie was...transcendent. Seriously. I was absolutely stuffed by the time I pushed myself away from the table. The service was also 5 stars.

With the cookbook tasting, you can go beyond what Giada did with over 5 more courses. The servers were surprisingly wonderful. They loved us (probably because we were a deviation from the usual crowd like at French Laundry). I was getting very excited about the food & they probably thought it was pretty nerdy. 

We chose to do the wine pairing with the prie fixe, which may not have been the classiest move because we hadn't eaten all day. A glass per course is definitely enough to do Connie in. 

To the server: ""How do you expect people to not get drunk after these pairings?!?"" 

I let them know it was my friend's birthday & he brought out complimentary champagne. It was the good stuff. 

Amuse Bouche: Butternut squash mango soup (I think). Wasn't my fave, but how can I really say no to mini things. 

Bread: Black pepper roll is yums. 

Tuna Tartare: Yolk mixed in with the ingredients in front of us. Very straight forward & very fresh. Reminded me of the one I had at Aqua (SF) except that one was Moroccan spiced. 

Maine Lobster Pot Pie: It was mini! I missed out on the copper pot of the big version, but I'm sure it was just as tasty. The lobster was perfect. Tender w/ a slight crispness. The shiny pastry shell was wonderful dipped in the creamy truffley goodness. (I audibly gasped and probably got more excited than they did when the table next to us got the big version because it's HUGE & the water guy laughed and whispered to me..that's the BIG one..See? They loved us.) 

Miso-glazed Black Cod: Flaky soft with the clean rich mouth feel of cod. The shiitake consomme was a bit salty, but expected. The shrimp and scallop ravolini were definitely -ini but a nice pair. 

American ""Kobe"" Ribeye: Perfect salty seared crust. Creamy foie gras and a deep pinot noir sauce. I really don't think you can go wrong. 

Dessert: Root beer float, strawberry shortcake, chocolate pudding. The root beer float was a pungent root beer flavor (I ate my friend's too) & the sassafras ice cream omg...It came with warm choc chip pecan cookies too. I think I can eat 5 courses of just that. The strawberry shortcake was a financier w/ macerated strawberry quarters & a hint of mint. Nice buttery financier w/ a chewy exterior. The chocolate pudding came with ice cream and red velvet cake. Never a bad thing. 

Extras: Then came little ice cream lollipop bonbons. Dark choc w/ espresso ice cream dipped in coffee beans. White choc w/ orangey ice cream dipped in almonds. Then they gave my friend a birthday chocolate martini (as if we hadn't drunken enough). 

Wines: Awesome pairings. Some of the best wines I've ever had and no it wasn't my asian glow talking. 

Everyone was very attentive & smiled at us all night. They would pause so I could take my food nerdy pictures & they all excitedly said thank you when we left. 

To the server: ""PS: I think we're drunk."" & I wondered why the servers loved us so much... (See excessive photos of experience.)",pe71QlTylW-ViRmMt-jQ5g,2,2,5,QPIiOET-d9kr8J_nhoJ1Sg

In comparison, the Vegas Michael Mina is much less pretentious and more casual than the SF one. The staff is more welcoming to walk-in's and don't blink at the sight of jeans and a T-shirt. 

My boyfriend and I decided on the Cookbook Tasting Menu, a selection of MIchael Mina's signature dishes. One of the best choices I ever made! In SF, I usually just go for the 3-course tasting menu. 

Tuna Tartare (Appetizer) - nice balance of sesame seed oil and salt/pepper along with a quail egg on top. I would have preferred something other than toast but overall the dish was delicious. Flown in everyday from Hawaii!

Lobster Pot Pie - as always, delicious. Unfortunately, a much smaller portion that if you were to get the 3-course menu. Understandable though because you have so much food. The lobster was cooked beautifully but the sauce is slightly different from the one I get in SF. I prefer the SF lobster pot pie but this one was good too. 

Chilean Sea Bass - they make their own dashi! The sauce was a bit on the salty side due to the buttery-ness of the sea bass but this was actually my favorite dish of the night! The dish was flavorful and the sea bass was the right texture. 

Filet Mignon/Kobe Beef - my boyfriend opted for the Kobe Beef selection which was delicious, tender, and perfect. It actually seemed like he had a larger portion of beef than my filet mignon! Each of our dishes came with a large piece of foie gras. Overall, this dish was delicious but very heavy and we were very full by the time this dish came out.

Dessert - a trio of desserts. If I wasn't so full at the end of the meal I would've probably enjoyed it much more. Our trio came with the delicious rootbeer float with a warm chocolate chip cookie, an ""opera cake"", and a smore-type dessert. 

We were celebrating our anniversary dinner and our waiter, who was very cool, gave us free champagne. He was also very helpful in helping us select our wines and cocktails. Bravo!

One dish that did blow me away was their tuna tartare that was mixed table side. The fish was of an amazing quality and after being carefully mixed with sesame oil, garlic, mint, and pine nuts it amplified all the goodness.

The decor was sophisticated in a boy scout ballroom sort of way. There was an open kitchen which made it cool to watch the food being prepared. The entrance to the restaurant is right in the botanical gardens at the Bellagio so you have hundreds of tourists crowding the area with their 3 foot long margaritas and Hooters t-shirts. This is fine by me but when your trying to exude a certain class you probably shouldn't put your entrance right where one of your hotels biggest attractions are.

I had the surf and turf. My filet was tough and my lobster was undercooked. How the hell did they pull that off? Anyway none of the other food was memorable except for the scallop three ways starter.

I had eaten there a while back when it was Aqua and I remembered we loved it. From the start we were treated like ROYALTY. Jorge (the manager) is a top-notch, gracious, and over-all classy guy that genuinely cares about the diner's experience. I feel like he sat us with Miguel (server) because he knew we were looking for a fun night. Miguel was THE BEST server ever. He put up with our tipsy antics and joined in on the fun which was such a treat, upscale dining can tend to be stuffy, with Miguel we had a GREAT TIME. We all ordered the signature tasting with wine pairings and everything came out in a timely fashion, not too fast, not too slow, JUST RIGHT.

I had the signature tasting with wine pairings. This was not my first rodeo. I've had the privilege of experiencing quite a few fine-dining restaurants in Las Vegas but this one TOPS THEM ALL. You know when you have a meal and think ""nothing will ever compare"", that totally happened. The food was SUPERB. It is so hard to choose a favorite dish because everything was so perfectly executed and the pairings were so perfect (hence being tipsy), but if i had to choose, I would say my favorites were the caviar parfait and lobster pot pie. Here is the play by play:

1. Starting off with the caviar parfait, which is paired with vodka AND champagne (why choose just one?!), really set the tone for the rest of the night. It is like a perfect combination of richness, crunch, creaminess, and a dash of acid to keep everything balanced, PERFECTION. 

2. The ahi tuna tartar is prepared table side and paired with a delicious Riesling (this was my favorite wine of the night). This dish was a big hit ay my table, everyone devoured it and it is quite a large portion. I wanted to lick the leftover quail egg off the plate it was so damn good. 

3. Miso glazed chilean sea bass: sweet, savory, tangy, crisp on the outside but moist and flaky on the inside all in all perfect once again. Paired with a white wine from a rare grape (or was it a rare wine) things were fuzzy at this point but I really liked this wine.

4. LOBSTER POT PIE: how they get all these pies out without overcooking the lobster is beyond me. they bring them out and cut the pastry shell off for you,the timing has to be just right or the lobster would get overcooked but my lobster was easily the BEST I've ever had. Of course lobster swimming in a buttery cream sauce is going to be delicious and it was. Paired with a chardonnay but I was too busy enjoying the lobster to give my wine any love and attention, the lobster was the star of this course.

5. Wagyu ribeye and Foie Gras: I've had his Foie Gras at Nob Hill MGM back in the day so I knew it would be good and it was SPECTACULAR. My friends agreed they had never had a better foise gras. It's got a yummy carmelization (my mouth is watering again). The ribeye was tender and delicious, everything was perfectly seasoned. Paired with a nice Cabernet.

6. Dessert trio: Root-beer float, chocolate chip cookie, and peanut butter chocolate cake paired with a port. So yummy but at this point I was very full so I could only have a few bites, those few bites were all I needed to end on a nice sweet note. 

Jorge and his staff made my birthday so special and I will never forget this experience, it not just a meal, its an experience. I HIGHLY recommend the signature tasting. From what I experienced, anything you order will be outstanding but it's a real treat to taste it all and with great wines. Job well done folks!

Immediately we noticed that Michael Mina is less formal than Le Cirque.  There were people in jeans and T-shirt; some in way too casual for fine dining but guess it's Vegas.  It was also louder than other fine dining places.  

To the food, we ordered the chef's tasting menu and here's the breakdown:
1) Unlike other fine dining restaurants, the bread selection is non-existent.  You get one cold bread while other places you'd get a huge basket with numerous selections that are warm to indicate fresh baked = minus 1 star.
2) First course - caviar parfait.  Very good.  Portion is small but very well-balanced flavor of slightly salty from the caviar to the citric from the tomatoes, and slight crunch from the toast.
3) Second course - tuna tartar (prepared at table) with quail egg, pine nut, and sesame oil.  Good; the tuna was fresh.
4) Third course - miso glazed chilean sea bass and dumpling.  The sea bass was tender and tasty.  The dumpling was so-so, nothing special.  The broth was what made this dish.  Light but very flavorful.
5) Fourth course - lobster pot pie.  We expected more after reading all the reviews but this was ok.  We were glad that we didn't order the full course 'cause this dish is very rich.  Because it's a tasting menu item, portion is smaller; you get about 4 small pieces of lobster and some pieces were overcooked.  The sauce is very rich but nothing special.
6) Fifth course - pre sliced Wagyu beef rib-eye with foie gras.  The foie gras was seared just right but small.  The Wagyu beef was ok, not tender enough but was cooked to perfect medium rare as requested.
7) Dessert - because it was our anniversary dinner, we each got an extra cheesecake dessert with handwritten ""Happy anniversary"" on the plate.  The cheesecake was light and tasty, not too sweet.  For the dessert that comes with the tasting menu, there were 3 items: a root-beer float (good but not spectacular), a warm cookie (very good), and a candy bar that taste like a chocolate tart (very good).

As for service, it was excellent.  From our server to the staff, everyone was very friendly and attentive.  Overall, this place is a solid 3 to us, not enough to be a 4-star.",Uo6Fw9OFMidVjY18jQr-7g,0,0,3,sIiBYDwuVTdOG1ubdiMdZw

Disturbing.

Anyhoo, I did the Cookbook Tasting with wine pairings, and travelin' man, who wasn't feeling as hungry, sweet-talked our waiter into letting him order the smaller lobster pot pie from the tasting menu and a salmon entree.

Amuse: watermelon and feta. Feta was delicious - actually, I thought it was goat cheese.

First: tuna tartare. Hands down best dish of the night. Travelin' man started waxing poetical about how this was the only tuna tartare that could ever compare to a wonderful and mythical tartare he ate in SF back in the day - fast forward to us (well, me) figuring out that the SF tartare was none other than...Michael Mina's! At one of his first restaurants, Aqua. 

Second: the famous lobster pot pie. The kitchen was actually out of the tasting size and instead split a full pie between me and the man. Honestly, it was way too much and almost derailed the rest of the meal. Because - how can you stop eating lobster?? Especially with that sauce, and the truffle flavor, and, mmmm... but it's just too damn rich to eat too much of. And eat too much, I did.

Third: Sole with something - clearly very memorable. I was still in a lobster coma, I think. It was delicious. I think.

Fourth: American Wagyu Ribeye with foie gras. Holy orgasm in my mouth, Batman! Oh the richness. Oh the flavors. Oh the buttery goodness that just melted and exploded and composed a symphony, hired and rehearsed the orchestra, and created a masterpiece with each and every lovely bite.

Suffice to say, it had nothing to do with the food, which was fantastic, but with a series of bad service choices made by the staff and an annoying customer who made the dining experience less than enjoyable. After that review, I was contacted by the general manager, Jorge, and invited to return. He went out of his way to make our experience there on our anniversary last week simply amazing. 

It was a demonstration of outstanding customer care. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. Our server, Marcio, was the best server I've ever had at a high end restaurant. He not only explained every course thoroughly, but was knowledgeable and personable in relating back stories about how the food was conceived, why wines were paired with each course and how each course was prepared in detail.

We were treated to a tasting menu, starting with the domestic caviar parfait with a shot of chilled vodka. The layers of flavor in this amuse bouche were astounding and it paired perfectly with the vodka. We then had the tuna tartare and diver scallop crudo. Both were so fresh, with surprising, bright flavors.

Next, we moved on the Chilean Sea Bass. The dashi broth...I am speechless. I was slurping it up. One of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. Next came the signature lobster pot pie. By this time, we were getting full",pAbGkh3sDmN4zVBDglduHw,1,0,5,GEOE1bMETxTwrImK1IxbOA

amuse bouche
salt baked potato soup with smoked onion, black truffle, and bacon bits -- tasty, heavy cream style, but nothing outside the box.
Maine Lobster Pot Pie with Seasonal Vegetables, Black Truffles, Brandied (Cognac) Lobster Cream -- a signature dish, but just heavy on the truffle and wouldn't order again
also tried the Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Shellfish Dumpling, Caramelized Cauliflower in a Dashi Broth -- prepared too salty.
for dessert, the Opera Cake with espresso and bitter chocolate sorbet was better than the Michael's Root Beer Float with Warm Chocolate Chip Pecan Cookies, but nothing to be excited about
mignardises (macraroon and gelee)
so maybe getting the trios is the way to go, but still nothing here was adventurous or perfectly executed, and flavors just played it safe.  if you have too many restaurants, maybe this is what happens.",kS1MQHYwIfD0462PE61IBw,2,1,3,YiehdpO0PKwRIaPXxZllSw

It was a very good price with the addition of adding a wine pairing for $55. I opted for the Bellagio Cocktail which was champagne and puree. Very yummy. The meal was amazing! Service impeccable and endearing. I asked for the vegetarian when it wasn't presented and the waiter jumped to attention and got very excited that we had similar tastes. My boyfriend enjoyed the beet and goat cheese salad, which I snagged a bite of and it was a perfect pairing. He also opted for the n.y strip which was $70 plus dollars. He said it was the most amazing piece of meat, he's ever had. 
Mine came with dessert, which was fit for a group. Me and the bf shared. We started with a small espresso size cup of hot apple cider and small shortbread cookie.

My bf surprised me with reservations at Michael Mina to celebrate our engagement. I was amazed how nice the restaurant was and semi quiet especially since its located at the Bellagio Conservatory. You cant even hear the big crowds outside. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant. 

I decided on the Cookbook Tasting Menu and my BF got the Far Niente Menu (which changes seasonal).

Cookbook Tasting Menu ($108 per person):

1. Tartare of Ahi Tuna - I love Ahi Tuna so I am biased but the tuna was really fresh and tasty.

2. Mini Maine Lobster Pot Pie - MY FAVORITE. I wish I got the BIGGER lobster pot pie but its okay. The crust wasnt oily and there were plenty of potatoes and spinach. i would definitely order this again. 

3. Glazed Chilean Sea Bass with Shellfish dumpling - My least fav because I am not a fish person. The sea bass wasnt kinda salty but definitely loved the broth.  

4. Loire American Kobe Ribeye with Foie Gras - Definitely a new taste for me. I enjoyed the Kobe ribeye and it was cook medium rare. It was my first time trying foie gras and its something i have to get use too. I really liked the potato cake though. YUM! 

5. Tasting dessert menu - Man, by the time dessert came i didnt even want to look at food. but i loved the root beer float and the warm chocolate cookies.

3673029,2014-02-22,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"One of the things my friends and I looked forward to as we planned our trip to Las Vegas was a fine dining experience that would fittingly conclude our vacation at one of the most surrealistically elaborate cities in the world. In the last minute, we decided to dress up and splurge ourselves at Michael Mina after watching ""O"" at Bellagio. The menu displayed at the indoor entrance of the restaurant certainly seemed enticing enough, and I was immediately drawn to a good balance of its trendy yet classy atmosphere. 

As we sat down, we were presented with two menus - the a la carte and the seasonal & signature tasting menus. All three of us decided on the signature tasting because it was comprised of the six most interesting items from the a la carte menu. My friends ordered red wine while I decided to settle for a less classy long island. Our main waiter, who was efficient and polite throughout the night, brought our drinks before taking our orders. I was disappointed with the long island as it tasted like lemonade one would expect from a lemonade stand operated by an 8 year old. 

It did not take long at all for the first item on the tasting menu - domestic caviar parfait - to arrive at our table; in fact, I was impressed by the speed of the service, considering how fresh every ingredient tasted. The combination of smoked salmon, creme fraiche and caviar worked really well, and I was particularly impressed with how the flavour of smoked salmon was just subtle enough to not overpower any other ingredients. However, I was not impressed with the choice to use hash brown as the base of the dish; its presence was almost too dominating. The dish would have had more balanced, superior flavours had the hash brown been replaced with something less dominating, such as an unsalted potato chip. I do have to admit this is more a subjective opinion, however, as my friends were pleased with the inclusion of hash brown in the dish. 

I was much more satisfied with the two items that followed: ahi tuna tartare and miso-glazed chilean sea bass. The tuna tartare simply melted on my tongue, and it was one of the most interesting combination of flavours and textures I've ever experienced. The sea bass was cooked flawlessly, and the presentation of the dish was elegant. I did not quite agree with the choice to add the dumpling as it was more a distraction than a complement to the dish; however, everything else in the plate worked well to enrich the already superior flavour of the sea bass.  

Next came the lobster pot pie, which had an interesting presentation but nothing much to flaunt about otherwise. It was a rather disappointing dish, as the lobster had this distinct aftertaste that could only be attributed to the fact that it was overcooked. The cream and the vegetables inside were good, but their flavours were far too subtle to overcome the major flaw of the dish. The pastry itself was baked perfectly, and its texture was an excellent complement. However, one cannot give too much credit to a dish with a poorly cooked star ingredient. 

The fifth item to arrive at our table was the wagyu ribeye rossini. The dish came with foie gras, which I had never tried before. I was quite pleased with the dish, even though the kobe beef was tougher than I had anticipated. Nevertheless, the subtle flavours and the textures of every ingredient used in the dish worked perfectly together to create a near-flawless tasting experience. 

The last item of the tasting menu was, of course, the dessert, which comprised of a root beer float and a chocolate chip pecan cookie. The root beer float was mediocre and forgettable; I am sure if I put together a scoop of vanilla ice cream thrown into a glass filled with root beer, it would taste the same. As for the chocolate chip pecan cookie, it had a peculiar, unpleasant flavour to it that took me some time before I knew what it was. It was the same flavour that I remembered from the cookies I've baked long ago using a poorly cleaned baking sheet. I obviously cannot say with 100% certainty that the pastry chefs at Michael Mina had been reusing baking sheet without washing them properly that night. With that said, I can't see what else could have caused the cookie to taste like that. 

Overall, I enjoyed my experience at Michael Mina, albeit it did fail to live up to my expectation. The service was adequate, but it did not add much to the dining experience; with the exception of our main waiter, the servers seemed distracted and in an unnecessary haste most of the time. I have experienced superior fine dining at cities much less grandeur than Las Vegas for lesser price; therefore, it is hard for me to recommend this restaurant despite some of its commendable dishes.

3681304,2016-02-14,1,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"While the service at Michael Mina was top notch, something about the dishes left me feeling like my experience was just so-so.

My friends and I came to Vegas and were planning to see Absinthe across the street so we decided on Michael Mina based on the high reviews and the relative distance from the show.  Given the excellent variety that comes with the tasting menu at a decent price  ($115), all of us decided to go with either the Seasonal or the Signature Tasting Menu.  

I personally chose the Signature Tasting Menu which has a lot of great sounding options but ultimately I left slightly disappointed.  Here is what was on the menu and thoughts:

Domestic Caviar Parfait:  Delicately plated much like a parfait with a layer of salmon, caviar, and potato cake, this dish was a pretty knockout way to start the meal.  The inherent richness of the salmon and saltiness of caviar balanced well against the potato cake and the creamy creme fraiche. 

Tartare of Ahi Tuna: With solid blocks of ahi tuna mixed tableside with the sesame seed oil, the dish seemed a little one note to me.  It helped to have the pieces of pear and pine nuts to add different flavor notes, but the sesame oil seemed a little heavy handed and that was the overwhelming taste that I experienced.

Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass: I really enjoyed this dish!  Immediately when you put the fish in your mouth it was close to melt in your mouth goodness and you can definitely taste the miso glaze.  The dashi broth was refreshing and the shellfish dumpling was a nice complement. 

Lobster Pot Pie:  The famed lobster pot pie was good but did not live up to the hype.  It definitely comes out amazing with the pie crust a nice golden brown.  The waiters came tableside to cut it open for us and you can see the steam wafting out and smell the wonderful aroma that comes from inside.  Unfortunately, the content seemed a little too soupy.  There was a good sized lobster pieces and some vegetables but it required a lot of slurping to get to it and it would have been better if it were a little tighter.

American Wagyu Beef Rossini: This was a solid beef dish that was done well but nothing amazing.  The pinot noir reduction provided a nice balance of salty sweet and to pair it with the with the foie gras added a nice extra textural component.  However, whether I would necessarily want to order this by itself, I am not sure.

Chocolate Mandarin Mousse: As a dessert, this was a let down.  After dishes that were executed with such laser-like focus, chocolate mandarin mousse, a cookie, and a root beer float on a plate seemed like a throw away.  It was nothing amazing or interesting and unfocused.

The service was amazing.  Whenever we stepped away, the waiters would replace it with a new one on your table for you to use.  Because we had a show to go to, they made arrangements to get us out on time even with our extensive tasting menu.

We had a party of 8 (four couples) there on Saturday night. Our server was really indifferent, right from the get-go. No smiling, no personality. Borderline unfriendly/unpleasant. And it didn't get better as the meal went on. It's not like they were slammed with a huge crowd, either. Other table attendants (water, bread) were super pleasant and on their game, though. Service was slow -- slow to take drink orders, slow to deliver them, slow to take dinner orders, slow to bring meals, slow to bring dessert menus, slow to bring the check... Our steaks were really good, our friends raved about the Lobster Pot Pie and everyone who ordered the Chilean Sea Bass loved it. Sides (beets, truffled polenta and a 3rd [kale?] that I've already forgotten) were... forgettable.

Again, a good meal, but not a great one, and subpar service in a place where you're paying for 5-star service. A disappointing experience after a great visit to American Fish and BLT Steak in Scottsdale.

Things began to get surly when I was delivered what was described as a Ribeye Steak - and upon delivery finding it cold, mealy and the portion shockingly small.  It had been at least 20 minutes since the starters had been delivered.  Delicious and piping hot were our Maine Lobster Tortellini Appetizers - served by a saucy and delightful waiter who shared a laugh with us.

Then...stony silence.  Our eyes were constantly diverting to what we could see of the pass, wondering when our dinner was going to come.

It did, dead on arrival - or at least my Rib Eye did.  This is a 'Rancher's Cut'?  There was probably 4 - 6 oz. of cut slices on the plate - and it was cold.  And..it was returned, and I instead opted for their signature Lobster Pot Pie, which is not to be missed.

But, even that takes some time - and we waited, and waited (my wife's Crusted Sole was perfect, and I could imagine it poised in some microwave, waiting to be reheated).

""Uh...can we see the manager"".

This is when things turned around.  This evening our restaurant experience was about to take a new direction.  Doug, the manager, was cool, efficient, friendly and sincere.  He apologized profusely, and backed up his apologies by making us feel that we were valuable to the restaurant, and that our experience was something he felt significant and important.

The food came, and it was good.  Our conversation turned to how wonderful this guy Doug was, how he was an incredible representative for Michael Mina, and the Bellagio Hotel.  We were frankly blown away.

Doug then went a step further and comp'd our desserts.  Something to be expected?  Sure, a comp'd dessert is always appreciated.  However what was not expected was Doug coming outside after we left Michael Mina, and before we were going to let him say anything, we told him how wonderful he was, and that he made our restaurant experience unique, memorable - and now we look forward to returning.",KnZ6CiJuH1lufLl3r5mSFg,7,3,5,Atj4UpbBVkoueBfYbewVLg

Unforgettable though near or far.
Like a song of love that clings to me.
How the thought of you does things to me.
Never before has someone been more."" - Nay King Cole

I have been staying at Bellagio for years & MM was one of only three restaurants I have never tried. (The others are Le Cirque & Picasso). After eating at Prime Steakhouse, Yellowtail, Fix, Jasmine, Noodles, Lago, & Harvest, I haven't had to really go to any other restaurant recently.

Some of my friends raved about MM so I finally decided to take the plunge and try MM for myself.

I ordered the following:

-Michael's Clover Club
-Cucumber French 75
-6 Kusshi Oysters
-Hamachi Crudo
-Ahi Tartare
-Spicy Broccolini
-""Wagyu"" NY Strip w/ foie gras butter & poivre sauce w/ King Crab
-Root Beer Float

Cocktails. (4 stars). 

I enjoyed both of my drinks. Michael's Clover Club was a nice start & had crisp slightly citrus kick to it! The Cucumber French 75 was light & refreshing! If I had to choose between the two I would order the Cucumber French 75 again as it was a nice palate cleanser!!!

Kusshi Oysters. (4 stars).

Absolutely fresh and slurp-o-licious!! I had no problem downing these beautiful mollusks!! So fresh, clean, & naturally salted!! I probably should have ordered 2 DOZEN but I had to save room in my rental unit (stomach)!

Hamachi Crudo. (4 stars).

I was a bit skeptical about the fish quality as I am from Hawaii where fresh fish is abundant and wicked expensive!! But I decided to try this dish after my server suggested it. I was pleasantly surprised by the freshness and texture of this dish! The chef adds some ""accoutrements"" aka Crudo such as the red seaweed strand, jalapeños, and Watermelon to give this dish a mildly ""sweet heat"" profile. I didn't care too much for the Watermelon as I felt it detracted from the dish but all in all a sold dish that I would order again... I would just give the Watermelon to the BF!

Ahi Tartare. (4 stars).

After eating the Oysters & Hamachi I was no longer afraid to order this dish! Ahi Tartare. Very similar to Poke. The fish is the ABSOLUTE star of this dish!! I loved the chili powder that is sprinkled on the dish to enhance the beautiful hearty Ahi!! I absolutely loved the pine nuts as it gave a nutty and earthy taste and crunch!! The only thing I didn't care for were the pears that were cubed and mixed in. Much like the Watermelon in the Crudo... The pear almost seemed to water down the robust flavors of the chili powder and the sesame oil!! The chunks of pears weren't terribly sweet but I just didn't care for them. The pine nuts were an awesome addition that I'll steal for my next Poke creation!!

Spicy Broccolini. (3.5 stars).

Not much to say. Not spicy at all?? The Broccolini was steamed nicely and came out ""al dente""! It's a good side to order! I would order it again but I was slightly disappointed by the lack of spiciness??

""Wagyu"" NY Strip with King Crab. (3.5 stars).

I have to say I have had much better Steak at Prime Steakhouse (A5 Wagyu Beef) but of course that Steak was almost $1000!! This NY Strip was tasty & wasn't terribly rubbery but it could just be that I'm more a ribeye fan but I felt the flavor of this beef fell flat even with the foie gras butter & poivre (peppercorn) sauce. In truth, I do not enjoy sauces on my steak. I just prefer a little butter, salt, & pepper. King Crab was yummy and simple!! But there is one part of this dish I really enjoyed! The shaved truffles!! So light & airy and melted on my tongue!! Reminded me of a very adult version of Japanese candy rice paper!! Next time I'll just ask them for shaved truffles!!

Root Beer Float. (4.5 stars). 

I LOVE ROOT BEER!! But more specifically Sarsaparilla!! It has a distinct licorice taste which is out of this world!! MM didn't disappoint me with this final course!! The Root Beer was pungent and bubbly and ice cold!! The vanilla ice cream scoop helped my drink stay nice and frothy!! The cookies that come with this dish were utterly limp and almost falling apart so I took one bite and left the rest of the cookies. Too sweet!! I will come back just for the Root Beer Float!! It brings me back to my childhood!!

All in all MM is a solid restaurant. I will probably come back as the BF has never been here before. I still prefer Harvest and Prime but MM has something the others don't... ROOT BEER!!!!!",Z67zFhSzaTDiIMKtVcuFFw,16,12,4,f3yVI9uplHiJKXXp_jFd_w

One bathroom per gender for the entire restaurant, seriously?  I was standing there awkwardly with two other guys and one gal waiting for their respective restroom. This, in a $$$$ restaurant (-.5).

The larger room which we were in was bright, crowded, and loud, not something I would expect for a $$$$ (-.5).

My small lobster pot pie that came with the tasting menu had 3 or 4 small overcooked pieces of lobster.  I think that you would be better off with the regular pot pie (-.5).  Warning: it is very rich, so eating the whole thing by yourself would be overwhelming.

Being in Vegas, it's pricey, I get it.   But definitely not worth the value.  Every entree was between $60 and $80. Take your money and eat somewhere outside of the Vegas strip for about half the price, but get the same enjoyment if you do your research of course.

Reservation was made for 5:30pm, and though people did not show up until 6pm, latest, the server kept pouring $8 a bottle of water and $130 bottle of champagne for two hours until we complained that we waited a bit too long for the food, and for them to stop pouring champagne (glass full to the top) to people who were obviously not drinking.

When the food came out, you can tell from each bite that the dishes were sitting in the kitchen for quite some time. That may have worked for their ahi tuna tar tar appetizer and salad, but it definitely didn't work to their favor when it came to their entrees. The meat came out cold, looking lumpy red, and the fish came out tough and dry, even when covered with white sauce. There was also a long delay in between the plates they brought out. They also had lobster pot pie but in all honestly, I only remembered it after going through my pictures. That says a lot about the dish.

Bright side though, each cold dish still ended up being quite tasty. Similarly to the one that we frequent in Glendale, the flavors are definitely spot on. 

Deserts ended up being the main attraction because everyone commemorated on the root beer float ice cream (really?), with a side of their soft cookie (... really?).

Now question arises whether the overall experience at this place was worth the $250 per person (including drinks), and if you're telling me that the only thing people liked from this place was the DESERT, then my obvious answer is no.

Aside from the initial 2-hour delay, our main server (not any of the girls or the guy in a suit) was the only one in the restaurant who was friendly to everyone during the entire time and was also quite attentive to our needs.

3819463,2014-09-13,6,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"My first Michelin-starred restaurant in the US! Michael Mina - Bellagio holds a Michelin one-star award and the food here is some serious business.

My boyfriend and I decided to try the Signature Tasting Menu for $110 per person. We were in Vegas, at a restaurant headed by a world-renowned chef, and this was going to be our first $$$$ restaurant. Umm, what do the kids say these days? YOLO. Go big, or go home! Thus, the tasting menu was the obvious choice.

Michael Mina is not splashy. There are no extravagant decorations or chic interior. It is purely a classy and elegant restaurant with simple decor. However, this setting can accommodate a large dinner gathering or an intimate date. The servers and staff are professional and friendly. Our waiter was very helpful and attentive--a little too attentive that it became borderline overbearing. But I think that comes with the territory when dining at an establishment like Michael Mina.

Now, to the best of my Yelping abilities, I will review the six items off of this Michelin-starred restaurant's Signature Tasting Menu.

*Domestic Caviar Parfait - Alderwood-smoked salmon, creme fraiche, shallot potato cake
A small treat that packs a huge punch. The parfait is tiny, but that's its design by intention. Just a teensy bite contains big, bold flavors. The ingredients blend well together to create an intricate tasting experience. The smoked salmon definitely dominated over the other ingredients with a powerful BBQ flavor. 

*Tartare of Ahi Tuna - Asian pear, pine nuts, Scotch bonnet infused sesame oil
The finely chopped ahi tuna is molded into a cylindrical block with a raw egg yolk sitting on top. The waiter breaks the yolk, then swiftly and meticulously mixes all of the ingredients together. You can eat the tartare on its own, or spread it on the bread. The sesame dressing is strong and peppery. The ahi tuna is velvety and soaks up the seasoning. The pine nuts add a crunchy texture. My only complaint is that my toast was extremely burnt (I should have taken a photo of it but I opted to snap a pic of my boyfriend's less charred toast). I was surprised they even served it in the first place. Does a Michelin-starred restaurant not carry enough bread that it can't replace burnt toast? It wasn't just me. The table next to us also had really blackened toast for the their tartare.

*Miso-glazed Chilean Sea Bass - shellfish dumpling, dashi broth
The BEST dish of the night! The sea bass was so moist, delicate, and silky. Loved the miso flavor and the dashi broth. I didn't care much for the shellfish dumpling--my mom makes better dumplings. But sweet Jesus. That sea bass was absolutely divine. The broth was savory to the last drop. 

*Lobster Pot Pie - seasonal baby vegetables, brandied-lobster cream
This was an interesting dish. After the waiter sets down the pot pie, he cuts the top off to expose chunks of lobster swimming in a buttery cream sauce. It's essentially an openface pot pie. Cool concept! The crust/pastry was flaky and doughy. This dish was too rich and heavy though. I'd say it was my least favorite despite its unique presentation. The lobster was fine but I wasn't impressed with the flavors.

*American Wagyu Ribeye ""Rossini"" - Hudson Valley foie gras, Pinot Noir reduction
The ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare, with a glistening red interior. The foie gras was smooth and buttery. This was a solid dish.
 
*Lincoln's Candy Bar - root beer float with vanilla ice cream, chocolate cookie
OK, I felt like the chefs were being lazy or lacked inspiration for this dessert. It's basically a glorified Butterfinger candybar, a typical chocolate cookie, and a small root beer float with a milk chocolate straw (that you can't even sip with!). Really? I expected more from Michael Mina. This was fine if I was at any ol' restaurant--but not at a Michelin-starred restaurant. 

Phew! I realize this review is LONG but I wanted to detail my experience since Michael Mina popped my Michelin Star cherry. Our dinner was top-notch, but I won't say it was the most incredible meal I've ever had. That sea bass though. It deserves a million Michelin Stars.",JGnqasIkGMLfSejt7mw9qQ,11,9,4,wxiQps75ZHW_NhgMejuYhg

We all ended up going with the 5-course tasting menu and I don't think we could've left happier. The tuna tartare is one of those over served dishes that you see on so many menus these days, but I'd be happy to just scoop up spoonful after spoonful of Michael Mina's version. Extremely fresh, with a nice little kick of heat, mixed at the table. As I write this review during my lunch break, I could use a plate of it right now. The other standout would have to be the lobster pot pie. I mean...just look at the name of that dish, how could it be anything but delicious?

Sure, the meal will but a dent in your wallet. But you're walking into a top-end restaurant in a top-end Vegas hotel...you already know what you're getting into. That being said, the meal was great from start to finish. And if there had to be a reason I wouldn't go back, it would simply be because Vegas just offers too many great dining options.

1. Ahi tuna tartare with sesame oil, pine nuts, and a quail egg
    - well I love tuna, and I love raw stuff, hence...I love raw tuna...and raw tuna dressed up this way is,well.....the best tuna tartare I've ever had

2.Lobster pot pie
    -A minature version of a Mina classic....actually a nice size (served in a ramekin with the pastry baked on top) for a tasting menu, generous amount of lobster, very rich

3.Miso-glazed cod with soba noodles, mushroom dashi, and bok choy
    -another variation of the famed Nobu dish...the sweetnes of the miso was well-balanced by the other components of the dish

4.Kobe ribeye with foie gras
    - the other courses were nicely portioned...this was a very small portion of what should be the highlight of the meal. 2 ounces at most. very anticlimactic for me. The steak wasn't all that great either.

5.trio of Mina classic desserts
    -Rootbeer float with chocolate chip cookie, coconut cheesecake, and something else I can't remember..I apologize for that.

3876012,2010-06-23,1,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"I saved my 400th review for our first nice dinner in Las Vegas at Michael Mina. Michael Mina is a huge name in fine dining, especially coming from San Francisco, so expectations were high. I was particularly excited because this restaurant had a prestigious Michelin star. Having already been to a two star Michelin at Picasso, I expected good things. 

We arrived early to make it in time for the prix fixe pre-theater menu, but I actually ended up choosing ala carte since I knew we would probably end up full and sharing the dessert. We were seted close to the windows that overlooked the Bellagio fountain, which was nice. We started dinner with an amuse-bouche of a small piece of watermelon with goat cheese. I never developed a liking for the strong pungent taste of goat cheese, but it actually worked quite well with the piece of fresh watermelon. The melon mixed very well with the strong flavor of the cheese, which resulted in a smooth aftertaste. 

For dinner, my companions chose items from the pre-theater three course menu. I went for the savory black mussel soufflé with saffron-chardonnay cream. Having tried to make a soufflé, I can appreciate one that rises as it should and is light and airy. It had a great seafood flavor and saffron as the most expensive spice in the world makes it even better. It reminded me of a seafood paella made into a soufflé. For only $15, I was also surprised at how cheap it was (relatively). I got to try the market greens salad and also the chilled English pea soup as well for the first course. The salad was your typical salad (I don't have a great appreciation for salads) made fancy by Michael Mina chefs, but the pea soup was full of pea flavor. It made for a refreshing starter for the rest of the meal. 

For the main course, I had the rack of lamb with anchovies, which also came with gnocchi and broccolini. The lamb was cooked a perfect medium-rare with a nice crust on the outside. The anchovies were a great touch since it didn't overwhelm with the salty flavor; instead, it had a rather tangy touch. The gnocchi looked like miniature scallops and came a bit dense. The broccolini was a bit over-roasted. I was lucky enough to try the Maine lobster pot pie, which was one of the signature dishes from Michael Mina. I enjoy table side presentation so it was nice that the server scoops everything out for you and presents it on a plate read to eat. The pie crust on top was huge and covered the whole top of a big pot. At $30 supplement to the pre-theater menu, it is worth trying. The filet of beef was juicy and tender, but I was more impressed with the ""cottage pie,"" with mashed potatoes topping the short rib meat underneath.

After the second course, we were already beyond full. It was probably not a good idea to accept some of the freshly baked breads at the beginning of dinner. We shared the root beer float and also the opera cake. I liked the sassafras ice cream and root beer sorbet a lot with the two freshly baked chocolate pecan crisp cookies. I'm a big fan of root beer so to have it turned into sorbet is something new. The opera cake was very rich in flavor so I didn't really taste the almond sponge cake because of the chocolate.

Overall, dinner was fantastic. I have a great appreciation for plate presentation and all the food looked as good as they tasted. A minor complaint about service was that I had to request water twice and waited a while before I was served water. Usually such high class places like Michael Mina will not let your water glass drop below 50%. It was a great meal and I left satisfied, but it wasn't one of the best fine dining meals I've had.",fgkJ6KUlrmbKyLDQervxsw,2,2,4,qMQIUKBCvwe1oQ0wFD_8Bg
3897578,2009-08-30,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"The pre-theater $55 per person dinner is the main reason I'm a fan - otherwise, the prices are really too high for this dining experience.  Reviews of the lobster pot pie being pretty phenomenal are spot on - worth the $20 surcharge on the pre theater pricing (and I'm a flaming frugal fox).

So why not a 5th star?  Coupla reasons.  Upon making the reservation, they inquired if this is a special occasion - why yes it is a birthday.  If asked, you anticipate at least a birthday wish.  A birthday cake with a candle wisks by, husband thinks it's his - oops - sorry -- no cigar.  Polite bussers but a bit of a cocky server whisk by again.  Dessert - so so - but where's the b-day cake?  Sorry sweetie, but I'm not one to make a scene.  We leave.  Enjoyed the filet mignon, tuna tartare app...not so much the seafood canneloni app - but that lobster pot pie is sure worth a trip here.

As for the wine, the sommelier was very approachable and knowledgeable.  Not wanting to seem too frugally foxy, I neglected to ask the price of  wine and ended up paying $29 for a glass - so while the pre-theater pricing is quite a deal - they will get you on the alcohol.",ae7zi8F0B6l_JCITh1mXDg,0,0,4,WqtwiJaVsk3SCOZxl539jw

Outstanding, each.  Dessert brought chocolate brownies and ice cream or a root beer float and the most delicious chocolate chip and nut cookie I have ever tasted.

3923110,2013-07-01,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"A long overdue review for one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas. The lobster pot pie here is one of my favorite dishes out of everything I've tried in the world, and it rightfully occupies that ""My Last Meal on Earth"" blurb in my Yelp profile. A 2.25 lb Maine lobster, perfectly cooked inside a pot pie with mushrooms and mixed vegetables in the most decadent sherry sauce I've ever had? Ugh. This is what I work out at the gym so much for, just so I can have it a few times a year.

There are two other must-haves: the ahi tuna tartare, which is served tableside mixed up with pine nuts and quail eggs, alongside brioche; and the caviar parfait - caviar on top of a mix of salmon and chives and creme fraiche, all over a lightly-fried potato shallot cake (which is the best ""hash brown"" I've ever had... and I love my hash browns).

This review is not without negatives; I am definitely not a fan of this place going downmarket over the years. For example, today's chilled seafood platter is but a shadow of what it once was (don't bother with it). Many of the higher-end selections (such as in their steaks) are long gone. Also, why get rid of the famous Michael Mina tasting trios?

However, the service has not suffered any sign of going downmarket. The servers are as attentive as ever without being at all overbearing or pretentious. The master sommelier here (Joe) is an awesome person to just chat with about wines. I love bouncing all my random wine thoughts off him, and he's really nice to humor me.

And the bottom line is this: to have a meal consist of the caviar parfait, tuna tartare, lobster pot pie, and root beer float to finish comes very close to what I would consider a perfect meal. And to have every course be from the same restaurant? How could I not give this place 5*?",65Bcz8_Rbbrcz_HGpq9Y-g,3,2,5,20qM7cIy7YV428Vg6nykRw

After checking some of these things, we were seated in the main dining room.  We were brought champagne flutes for our toast to each other and that was the beginning of a four hour dinner that was extraordinary in every way.

A simple starter of laffa bread with olive tapenade, house made hummus, and red onion labneh had me watching how much laffa I was eating given how much we'd be eating.  The tapenade was exquisite.  Then came a Pavlova the English peas.  The server cracked the Pavlova to allow us to get to the crab meat inside the Pavlova.  That was followed by the Mina caviar parfait.  Then came a crudo sampler that was beautifully presented with excellent fish.

Next came some more serious food--a grilled shellfish platter and some diver scallops.  Excellent!  This was accompanied by some tempura asparagus with an Osetra caviar cream.

Then came one of the most outstanding parts of the meal--two whole Hudson valley foie gras.  The foie was sliced and served on a platter.  We had been given plates for the foie and the taste was amazing!  Next came whole Kona kampachi and the fish was filleted table side and then served.  Superbly cooked fish with an excellent flavor.  

Dessert was a strawberry granita panna cotta and a milk chocolate soufflé with some cappuccino ice cream.  Then we got some mignardises just to make sure we hadn't been filled by all this great food!

Service was outstanding!  Iced tea glasses were replaced, water glasses refilled, and the table was kept clean at all times--well except for where I slopped.  I was asked if I wanted a napkin to cover my sloppiness but I politely declined.

During the dinner, Gary LaMorte, Vice-president of the Mina group stopped by the explain some of the dishes and check on our progress.  Before we left, Mina Chef Sharpe stopped by to make sure everything had been to our expectations.

We are developing an appreciation for wine and the foods that pair with them. Their special pairing menu featured four courses with four different wines. The first was a seared ahi appetizer which was paired with a chardonnay. Second course was a lobster pot pie with a chablis. The very dry chablis was one of our faves. Could it be that lobster and chablis are just a perfect match? Next was the kobe beef entree that was cooked to perfection and so tasty. It was a pretty generous portion paired perfectly with a bold cab. The dessert course was really fun. It was a sampling of 4-5 different desserts from cookies to chocolate dipped things and a miniature glass of root beer with a chocolate straw. This was paired with a port. A bit too sweet, but with a great kick. We were in heaven throughout the whole meal. Really.

Our main server was very attentive. And there were at least 3 other servers that I can remember that had different responsibilities to keep everything moving smoothly.

I have been there many times, and on every other visit I would have given five stars...however, after eating there last night I think this restaurant has started to go downhill a bit.

We had the tasting menu because (in my opinion) it includes the best of the menu: the caviar parfait, lobster pot pie (to be honest, the large lobster pot pie on the menu is so heavy and so much to finish, I actually prefer the smaller version on the tasting menu), and delicious wagyu. We chose to add seared foie to our steak since there is no foie elsewhere on the tasting menu. I highly recommend doing that!! There is also a huge foie gras you can order from the menu - but beware, it is enough for at least 5-8 people, so don't order with just a few people!

The food: The caviar parfait was not nearly as good as I remember from prior visits. Completely loaded with creme fraiche (as opposed to more salmon and much less creme fraiche previously) - a shame to drown it like that. The lobster pot pie is a stand out - a full tail and claw in delicious sauce. I even loved the butter-seared scallop, which is not one of my favorite foods normally. The steak is the best course - absolutely melt-in-mouth delicious.

The service: Our waiter was nice, but sadly, just not the caliber you should expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. He did not check back in with us mid-course even once during our meal, only coming by to deliver our next course or our next wine (and sometimes he did not even do those things). Before we ordered and began our wine pairing, we wanted to start with a wine or champagne. As we began asking questions about the wine list, it was clear he had no idea what he was talking about and instead of going to get the sommelier, he literally said ""Ummmmm"" for a long time, and then just pointed at one. I asked him to please check with the sommelier before bringing the wine, but I'm not even sure he did that. We didn't see a sommelier even once during the meal.

Ambiance: I love the open kitchen. Generally love the non-stuffy feel of this restaurant. However something happened that shocked us: someone came by with a huge camera asking if we wanted our photo taken! Turns out you can buy these photos later like you are on a cruise. We though it was hilarious, but pretty tacky. I think the old Mina management would be appalled...

The food was, for the most part, still very good. But I don't think it deserves its Michelin Star anymore and the service certainly leaves a lot to be desired for a $600 meal...I never leave below a 20% tip, but doing so left a bad taste in my mouth this time.",C2RTNSaPYu_TKvpHxN41YQ,4,1,3,BjwrjOt8UnMMf7QP8-iDRQ

Cons: Kinda pricey, but that's expected

Kristin C. and I ate here at the Bellagio to celebrate our 4 year anniversary.  We had a reservation at 7:30 and were promptly seated.  I love when you have a reservation and you actually get seated right away. 
Anyway, the decor is very elegant, but not too gaudy or overdone.  Definitely felt like a Bellagio restaurant.

Although they have a ""tasting menu"" that seemed pretty good for the price, Kristin C. and I opted for selected our own entrees.  We started with the steak tartare salad and I ordered the sashimi plate.  The steak tartare salad was pretty good although they could have put less steak and more vegetables.  The sashimi was good, but it wasn't amazing.  For our main courses, we got the lobster pot pie and Mediterranean grill plate.  The lobster pot pie is one of their signature dishes and it definitely did not disappoint.  The lobster pieces were generous.  The Mediterranean plate was pretty good, but it wasn't amazing.  It had grilled calamari and prawns, but it wasn't anything to write home about.

The big winner in my mind, however, was the black truffle potato puree.  Anything with truffles is a win in my book, and that puree was no different.  It was creamy and had the right amount of flavor. Delicious.

In the end, without any beverages, our bill came out to $199 without tip.  Kinda pricey, but not too bad for a fancy meal.",pPe_Hsm44QOar_dYYFKy1A,1,1,4,-Rp_96VWXaAZ_8sNDJB82g

Mind you, the Bellagio conservatory was closed so we were slightly disappointed however, getting seated by the window with a lovely view of the pool quickly got our mind off of it.
Our server, Jaime was great! He was very friendly and made jokes with us throughout the whole evening. He had great recommendations that really sold us as well.

We were started off with some bread. You have the option of sour dough or honey wheat. (Hint: make sure to save bread for later if you're going to be ordering the Pot Pie. Dipping bread into the sauce leaves some type of magic in your mouth)

What we ordered:
Hamachi Crudo: (what's in it- avocado, yuzu koshu, pickled kohlrabi)
It was OoOoookay. It was good but nothing special.

Ahi Tuna Tartare: (what's in it- ancho sesame oil, pine nuts, mint)
Smells and tastes so good! The runner will be finishing up the preparation of the dish at your table. You will be able to watch him/her crack the egg on to the tuna and mix it with the rest of the condiments. 

Maine Lobster Pot Pie: (what's in it- baby vegetables, truffle-lobster cream)
Like the Ahi Tuna Tartare, the server or runner will be plating the dish by your table. They will bring the pot by you and explain the dish  while they move the components of the dish on to your plate. The highlights of the pot pie are definitely the pie crust and the lobster. The lobster was great as expected, it tasted fresh and was very tender. I was surprised to find how much I enjoyed the crust! Even when it was drenched in the sauce, it still had a crunch to it!

Root Beer Float: (what's in it- sassafras ice cream, warm chocolate chip pecan cookies)
Yes, I am that person that orders a root beer float at a fine dining restaurant AND I have no regrets. The ice cream easily melted with my root beer and was so delicious. The chocolate chips in the cookies were just oozing out of the cookies and the cookie itself was so chewy. Perfect way to end the meal.

Also, we were surprised with complimentary truffles. They were so sweet by preparing an amenity wishing us a Happy Anniversary.

Open and brightly designed, the restaurant itself seemed classy yet very welcoming. Right next to the Bellagio garden, opportunities of photo ops are everywhere.


Domestic Caviar Parfait: This was my FAVORITE.  Full of flavor and yet so simple and light.  I could've eaten at least 5 more of these.
Tartare of Ahi Tuna:  Quality was very good.  A bit too much sesame oil for my taste, but I love the smell of sesame oil so I didn't mind it.
Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass:  Broth was delicious and the boy choy was deliciously charred.  Fish was light.  My friends went to the restroom before this was served.  We saw it was ready in the window, but since they weren't there, they didn't serve it.  We saw the kitchen take it back and re-make it for when my friends returned.  Good sign for consistency of quality?
Lobster Pot Pie:  Big chunks of lobster...a bit heavy for my taste.  
American Wagyu Rib-eye:  Meat was cooked perfectly.  Served with foie gras, which I don't care for.  I gave that to my friend.  Enjoyed the meat slices but I was so full by this point, I couldn't finish it.  

Lincoln's Candy Bar:  Cookie was warm and yummy, as was the Valrhona chocolate piece. My favorite was the root beer float.  

I would HIGHLY recommend getting the wine pairing if you plan on drinking.  The pairings went perfectly with each dish.  One of my friends ordered a glass of wine with her meal which was $18.  For $65. you get 6 glasses of really good wine.  

4 signature tastings, 1 wine pairing, 3 coffees, 1 americano, 1 wine, 2 cocktails for roughly $770 (after tax and tip).  Staff was friendly and on point.  We tried taking a group selfie and our server offered to take a picture for us.  :D

Maybe I am a spoiled San Franciscan.  Ok, I am definitely a spoiled San Franciscan.  I live, eat, breathe good food.  I was hoping that Mina might be the ticket out of my culinary drought (so to speak). 

Walking into MM, we were greeted by a generic decor which reminded me vaguely of ""Stacks"" on Hayes.  Uh oh, I thought.  No, give it a chance.  You need this. 

Following seating, we were served a corn panacotta and crab amuse which was quite tasty.  The server who took our wine order was snobby, correcting my ""pinot gris"" pronunciation which instantaneously irritated me.  I did not say the ""s""...ok, maybe I did.  So what.  Bring me my $15 glass of wine. 

Am I sun blind?  Did I really just read that it was $78 for dover sole?  This seemed excessive, even to me.  I opted for the duck with chestnut puree, brussels and tangerine jus (FLASHBACK---it's fall of 2007!!!  oh wait....).  My guy, the ahi with foie and potato cake (superb--perfectly seasoned and delicious).  

When my duck emerged from the kitchen it was so rare that it exhibited the chewability qualities seen only in the finest of rubber feathered gag gifts.  Duck is great medium rare.  But for $40, I think it is fair to say that I should be able to cut it with my steak knife.  I saw another of the same plate headed back to the kitchen with all the duck untouched.  Writing in the sand!!  But what does it mean?

Luckily, my plate also came with some fabulous confit which I readily devoured.  The brussels were so so, the tangerine jus was exceptionally good on everything (and was served in a saucer so that I could sauce at will...ummm saucy.)  

Overall, I was disappointed.  Vegas is renouned for its culinary offerings and while Mina wasn't astoundingly bad, it certainly was not comparable to Jardinaire or Quince in SF.

In any case, the bf and I went. We decided to try one of his Signature Trios so, we went with the classic pork. The pork is prepared in three ways; 1.kurobuta 2.pork belly with marmalade 3. BBQ pork worchestershire. The presenation was nice, however, the taste was not. Kurobuta is naturally fatty and tender. I have never met a dish of kurobuta that I could not finish. Mina certainly changed that for me. It was chewy and extremely tough. It's a shame. 2 & 3 arent even worth mentioning. We couldnt finished our trio. Such a waste.
 
On a more positive note, the following dishes were memorable:
1. the butter poached lobster. the foam was a nice touch, it added a bit of lightness to the dish.
2.the lobster pot pie. Thin on the dough and cream - its a good thing. it allows the lobster to stand out and not be overshadowed by the sides.

It was clear that we had to try his tasting menu and so we did with excitement. In the end, I found the majority of the dishes to be very lacking in flavor combination and flavor itself. It felt like a ""play it safe to the palate of average diners kind of meal."" Just kind of lacking in excitement all together. I did however find the miso glazed seabass in dashi broth quite excellent. I WILL tip my hat to that dish. On the flip side, the lobster pot pie dish he has been oh so famous enough for was the most underwhelming dish and quite frankly the worst course of the tasting. The rootbeer float cookie dessert was a joke. (But that's just my opinion). The food itself was cooked nicely for the most part with no serious complaints. 

Apart from that, the service was excellent and on par with what you would expect from a restaurant of that caliber. Bathrooms were nice too.

1.  We had a choice for the first course - Ahi Tuna Tartare or the Caviar Parfait. Both were delectable but the Caviar was definitely the winner.  Each bite bursted with flavors...literally... 

2. The second course was THE LOBSTER POT PIE.... WOW.

3. The third course was The American Kobe Rib Eye - Each tender bite melted in my mouth. The cream corn that came with the Kobe was delicious.

I appreciate that they offer a vegetarian option and that's why we chose this restaurant over others, but I felt like the vegetarian choices weren't as well thought out or inspired as the meat ones.  I understand chefs are often less happy making meat free options, but they obviously cared enough to go through the motions.  

I also found our waiter to be a little rude towards us. We didn't order alcohol and we're happy with flat tap water, so I'm not sure if we're just not pretentious enough? This was a few months ago and I'm still laughing about how the waiter forced my boyfriend to finish everything on his plate before he would take one of the courses away.  I can't figure out the reasoning for that! There were maybe 2 small bites left and when my boyfriend indicated verbally and nonverbally that he was done, the waiter insisted he needed more toast points for his tartar. When he came back with the toast, he literally prepared another bite of tartar for my boyfriend.  It was weird and uncomfortable.

Appetizer - We started off with a seafood platter, which included things like crab, lobster, ceviche, raw oysters, and prawn.  Everything on that plate was beyond fresh and delicious.  The crab was SWEET and I'm not usually an oyster fan but this oyster was delicious.  

Main - My main was the lobster pot pie, apparently a signature favourite.  And I can definitely see why!  The lobster pot pie is a pastry filled with a whole lobster, vegetables, and a creamy sauce to compliment it.  They bring out the pie in front of you and slice the top of the pie (shell) and use it as a base on your plate.  Then they delicately arrange the pieces of lobster and vegetables on your plate.  At the end, it is absolutely beautiful and I can see someone has already posted a photo of it on Yelp.  It tasted as beautiful as it looked.  

My friend had a the filet steak cooked to medium rare and that was also very juicy, tender, and delicious as well.  

I was way too full for dessert by the end but I did order a Blue Lagoon drink at the beginning.  They went out of their way to find the recipe for the drink.  It was a great drink but unfortunately, I wasn't feeling very well that night (recovering from a flu/cold) so I barely touched the drink.  

Overall, I felt their service was great.  The food took a little longer than I wanted for it to come - there were a table of 10-11 of us that night so I'm not sure if they just wanted everything to come together or what the story was.

I've been to Michael Mina twice, and the food and service have been remarkably outstanding both times.  This is a special occasion restaurant, with special food, service, and, yes, prices, to match.

The food is wonderful.  Dinner typically begins with a compimentary surprise starter.  On Sunday, we were served a cold sole starter that was light and flaky.  For appetizers, Michael Mina offers serveral ""signature trios,"" a main ingredient prepared three different ways, akin to Iron Chef.  I had the foie gras, which was actually prepared six different ways -- three cold, three hot -- with lychee nut, pear and pineapple.  Excellent.  A friend had the scallops, which were also wonderful.

For main courses, and the waiter recommended one starter and one main, I had the classic lobster pot pie dish, while a friend had the rack of lamb trio, again, prepared three ways.

The wine list was extensive, and the desserts were tasty, particularly the mini root beer float, which I love.

I thought service was impeccable.  The restaurant had noted that this was my second visit, and they addressed me by name when I first arrived and at the table.  I thought that was a very nice touch.  And the water and sommelier were knowledgeable and responsive both.

Yes, the prices are exhorbitant, but, frankly, this restaurant is one of those places that if you have to ask, you probably can't afford it . . . .

Our first main course was a perfectly seasoned filet mignon. Perfect temperature. The other dish we chose was seared scallops. This was an unfortunate choice. The scallops, although perfectly cooked, were over seasoned with squid ink and truffles. They also ladled entirely too much browned butter over the entire dish.

Food, Service, Attentiveness, Detailed, Courteous..Anything you can think of....ON POINT!

From the moment we walked in, service was impeccable.  It was a family trip so we had my baby nephew with us, and instead of them turning their noses r rolling their eyes at the matter,  they were so accommodating.  We usually wouldn't  think about bringing a baby to fine dining, but since this was a vacation, we couldn't put him with the bell boy. =) So needless to say, the whole time they made us feel comfortable and very welcome. So that fact alone really impressed us.  

Our waiter was attentive and detail about the menu and had great recommendations,  but of course being me, I've already had my mind set on something.....And Two words...LOBSTER POTPIE! It was a great big portion and was so yummy and rich, I was happy and full for the rest of the night. the best part of it was the flaky, buttery and crisp crust...mmmmm, so good! But I also enjoyed the steak tar tare! Fresh, soft and melted in my mouth! It was delish!

Overall, I though the food was okay, atmosphere is relaxing (loved the old big band/jazz/blues music selection) and service was decent.

Ordered the seasonal tasting menu ($115pp) as well as a side item.
Domestic caviar & celery root - Caviar tasted great, can't really go wrong with caviar. Although, if it was alone on the menu, I wouldn't make efforts to re-order this.

Hamachi Sashimi - Tasted good, but was a missing an ingredient to put the final flavor punch. Tasting this made me miss the hamachi shots at Alexander's (in Cupertino, CA).

Seaweed & Pepper Crusted Ahi Tuna - Cooked wonderfully but not a memorable dish.

Butter Poached Main Lobster - Ravioli tasted great. Lobster was cooked nicely as well.

Copper Ridge Ranch Natural Veal Lion - Veal tasted great. The veal came on top of a pile of risotto which I didn't like the flavor of, probably because it was oily which is not my cup of tea.

Strawberry Creme Fraiche Panna Cotta - This came with a mini root beer float and chocolate chip cookie. I think the cookie had nuts in it so I didn't eat much of it because I hate nuts in cookies. Root beer floats are just like regular root beer floats, can't really screw this up. The panna cotta was probably the STAR of the menu. If I were to re-order anything from this seasonal menu, it would be the panna cotta. Rich, creamy with fresh fruit. Really refreshing! I'm not really sure how the root beer float/chocolate chip cookie goes along with the panna cotta, but I guess it's like a mini 3-course dessert selection.

Brussels sprouts - The side of brussels sprouts was like eating vegetable candy. The sprouts were caramelized and some of the pieces were nice and crunchy. Yum. And yet, you can't eat the whole thing because it'd be like eating a bag of candy. Or maybe you can? Hrm!

Overall, after tax/tip I ended up spending ~$170 for what I ordered above as well as one non-alcoholic drink - dinner for one person. I'm not sure this meal was that memorable considering the amount of money spent, I expected a better experience.  Other than the panna cotta, there isn't much that I liked enough to have again and/or to tell other people to try. 

Some of the not so great parts of the night was that there were some dishes that took about 20 minutes to come out (after my previous plate was already taken away) which created a long lull. Secondly, out of a whole row of empty tables, they sat people right next to me. Which made it a little awkward when the two next me to wanted to talk about more personal topics.. especially during the moments when I had no food to busy myself eating because I was waiting for the next dish. I ended up doing some pretend reading on my phone - because I had no cell reception in there. Fun!",z1zQNIcfGeBAPdaaXXO2fg,1,1,3,eLj7qOSbFusGUFUi9tty_Q
4411576,2010-01-08,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"scallops scallops!!! so delicious!! 

this Michael Minas is a bit different than the one in San Francisco. they offer an a la carte menu, which is more popular and offers a greater selection than their tasting menu. I guess more people come for a shorter dining experience since tasting menus usually average a 3 hour dinner. the tasting menu offered two choices of a 5 course meal. 

the scallops and foie gras appetizer is to die for. fine dining is known for their tiny spoon sized, yet hardy portions. this dish was filling. two pieces of scallops and foie gras. the black mussel soufflé was also very hardy and delicious. the tuna tartare with sesame oil was great as well, the sesame oil adds just the perfect taste to the tuna. next time maybe I'll just have a bunch of appetizers for dinner...

the lobster pot pie. its bigger than my stomach. I can usually chow down but I couldn't get myself to comsume the last two pieces. they make the lobster and its sauce and veggies in a cooking pot, they then cover the top, like a lid, with the pie crust. when serving, they cut out the crust to use as a base to your plate and scoop out the lobster all its glory onto a dish, beautifully done. 

my friends and I had an awesome time over excellent food. the service here is top notch. I had to catch a flight and they had me in and out just in time, but enough time to enjoy the food. fine restaurants usually have many waiters catering to you which I haven't always had good experiences with since they get confused and the service then become inconsistent. but the service here, was outstanding, to say the least.

highly recommended. Michael Minas definitely puts a twist to fine dining.",_OpVivevjEFl2rwEPPX-XQ,0,0,5,JPsa1NUzYbmnW2yni_ew5g

I ordered the Cookbook Tasting Menu ($118 per person)

Before we started our tasting, the chef gave us a sample of watermelon salad w/ goat cheese. It was a good summer salad. I'm not a fan of goat cheese, but i was able to eat it - the goat cheese wasn't too strong, so it was okay. 

So now, onto the my Cookbook Tasting Menu:
1. Osetra Caviar Parfait - it had layers of alderwood-smoked salmon, creme fraiche, and potato shallot cake. This was all topped w/ Osetra Caviar. This was my 2nd favorite course of the whole entire meal. Everything was so fresh that this course got its own sweetness to it. 

2. Tartare of Ahi Tuna - I love how they presented this dish to me. They explained each ingredients and mixed everything together in front of me. This was a good texture dish, you got the freshness from the tuna, the crunchiness from the pine nuts, and the flavor of sesame oil and chiffonade of mint and a pinch of habenero. overall it was a good dish, but it didn't WOW me.

3. Main Lobster Pot Pie - my favorite dish of the night. Originially I thought this dish was going to be small with diced up lobster. But boy was i wrong, the pot pie was a good decent size, it came w/ a good portion of lobster, it was big enough to fill up that pot.  Aside from the lobster it came w/ some vegetables and black truffles. The sauce was so creamy and so flavorful - you can definitely taste the brandy - this was just amazing. It was rich, which made it filling, but oh man, i can eat another one by myself right now.

4. Kobe Beef with seared foie gras - the beurre rouge was an excellent sauce to complement the kobe beef. However the beef and the foie gras was so good on its own that I can do w/o the beurre rogue. It also came w/ two sides spinach and potato cake - those were just okay, the star of the dish was, of course, the kobe and foie gras. 

5. Tasting of Michael Mina desserts - Coconut S'more, was pretty good, but i didn't think it was that special perhaps it's just me since i'm not a fan of marshmallow to start off with. I wish it had more coconut flavor. The Mini Root Beer Float was really good - it had a REALLY strong flavor of root beer. If you like root beer, you will definitely like this sample. Opera Cake was topped w/ this rich dark chocolate ice cream - it was heavenly! i loved this dessert out of the three samples. 

At the end of our meal, they also brought us another plate of cookie sampler with macaroons, brownies, some butter cookies, and what seems to be peach jelly. These were really good! 

This whole meal was an excellent experience. From the service to presentation of each meal to the taste of each dish was just amazing. I enjoyed my meal a lot. 

I'd definitely recommend you order their tasting menu since it's just a few more dollars more than their regular entree and this way you can try other dishes.",Vp5DzIiP_MmaMZMZVFFltA,17,14,5,ta2nyxfcqdvEjzwf9PVnAw

The chef's tasting menu consisted of caviar parfait (extra charge), lobster pot pie, wagyu ribeye, and a selection of desserts.  The caviar parfait is a beautiful layered tower with a crispy potato cake on the bottom, then layers of creme fraiche and smoked salmon, topped off with osetra caviar.  A magnificent presentation and so so so good.  My friend had the ahi tuna tartare instead of the caviar parfait, and despite all the raves about the tartare, I did not find it special.  The wine pairing was Veuve Cliquot yellow label Champagne which is fairly ubiquitous and I think not special enough for the singular caviar course.

The lobster pot pie was exceptional.  Large chunks of tender lobster in a truffled cream sauce.  Holy mackerel, that was good.  The wine pairing with a French Chablis was so delicious as well.  Bravo.

The wagyu ribeye arrived as a few smallish pieces with a few fingerling potato halves and some sylvetta (wild Italian arugula).  The morbier cheese sauce gave it a nice pungency.  The dish was delicious but the portion size was quite small.  I also found the paired cabernet sauvignon a bit timid for this dish.

The selection of desserts was a bit underwhelming to me.  Root beer float was cute but a bit lightweight for a meal of this caliber.  The wine pairing was a 1999 vintage port which I was not impressed with.  The desserts and some of the wines brought my rating down to 4 stars.",jL-qSB8CAKrAdF6fKJNCxQ,0,0,4,DwZ3p_FlE7jmBzZRfrDKqw
4488921,2014-11-18,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"This was my first time at a Michael Mina restaurant and it was exquisite! We did the signature tasting menu:

- Caviar Parfait (with creme fraiche and shallot potato cake): This was a perfect dish. I wanted to make out with it.

- Ahi Tuna Tartare (with Asian nuts, pine nuts, scotch bonnet infused sesame oil, raw egg): Presented at your table, then mixed by your server with the raw egg and all the accompaniments. The fish was undoubtedly fresh and the serving was generous, but the dish fell a bit short on flavor. My lease favorite of the night.

- Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass (with shrimp dumpling and dashi broth): I'm used to similar dishes prepared with black cod, and the choice of Chilean sea bass was interesting. Black cod absorbs sauces and flavors better in my opinion, but I still enjoyed this dish. Can't really go wrong with Chilean sea bass in general. It was a beautifully cooked fish.

- Lobster Pot Pie: Deliciously rich, buttery goodness. A la carte, the pot pie is usually presented in tact, then cut open and plated at your table in spectacular fashion with the lobster shells and all. As part of the tasting menu, the pot pie is smaller, and the lobster is already de-shelled and cut up into chunks. The server simply cuts off the top crust for you, and it's ready for you to enjoy. I'd liken it to a lobster bisque with veggies and a flaky buttery crust topping. It's extremely rich and heavy, and I can't imagine eating a larger portion!

- Wagyu Ribeye: Three slices of beef, cooked medium rare topped with a pinot noir reduction, chunk of seared foie gras, and slices of truffle. Yes. Foie gras and truffle. *I die* This was fantastic, but I was so full at this point, I could only eat half of the ribeye (I killed the foie and truffle though, for sure!).

- Chocolate PB&J (with root beer float and chocolate chip cookie): Enjoyable, but again, I was so full, I don't know that I truly appreciated the dessert!

Service was excellent, with the exception of the hostess who, in every interaction, made eye contact with and spoke ONLY to my companion while actively ignoring me (what the heck?).

Hubby loved all of the dishes but I found them to be a little uninspired and a little lacking in flavor. I guess my major issue was that they seemed under-seasoned and needed a little more oomph to make them truly spectacular. Hubby thinks my palate might have been off on this occasion but I have to disagree... 

I did thoroughly enjoy the dessert however and the service was good. The restaurant's ambiance felt a little stiff - we were seated at the very back corner of the restaurant surrounded by folks who seemed just a tad pretentious for my liking.

We were lucky enough to be Vegas during Restaurant Week and scored a great deal at Michael Mina. The special menu was 3 courses for $50 and wine pairing for $20.

First course: 
*Tuna Tartare mixed table side with quail egg, toasted pine nuts, sesame oil, mint and garlic. Delicious! The tuna was creamy, the flavors went together beautifully, and the pine nuts added a nice texture to offset the smooth tuna.
*Shellfish Cannelloni: one giant cannelloni filled with crab and lobster, in a delicious foam. Surprisingly filling.

Second course:
* Miso-glazed black cod: perfectly cooked cod, arranged in a bit of miso broth with mushrooms, bok choy and soba noodles. Delicate flavors that definitely complimented each other.
*Jidori chicken:

Third course:
* Michael's root beer float: too filling! This would be perfect to share, but it was way too much for me. The root beer sorbet was delicious, as was the sarsaparilla ice cream, but I don't think the dish could survive without the 2 cookies. 
*Petite basque with quince gelee: perfect serving size and great flavor combo.

We also received an amuse bouche (tuna something on a parmesean cracker - looked a little gross but was really really good) and a little after-dessert plate with fig bars (too dry) and pomegranate gelees (really good).

Dining at Joel Rubuchon just last month, it really upsets me that I paid 5x as much for a meal I didn't enjoy as much.  The signature tasting menu for $115 was incredible.  The six courses will not leave you disappointed nor hungry at the end.

Dishes included:
- Caviar parfait included a base of shallot-potato cake, Alder wood smoked salmon, creme fraiche, topped with, of course caviar.  I'm not a real caviar fan but this was exquisite.

- Ahi tuna tartare is basically a Hawaiian poke.  Fresh ahi mixed with sesame oil.  Pine nuts and fresh pear was a nice twist to hawaii's poke.

- Chilean sea bass.  For those of you familiar with miso black cod or butterfish, this was a nice take on this loved dish.  It was flakey with a great miso flavor hinted with a smokey taste.  It included a wonton in a lightly salted soup base.

- Lobster pot pie.  This was the mini version of his famous pot pie.  Nice large chunks of lobster, mini carrots, potatoes and onion.  It was cover in a light flakey crust which the cut off table side.  The sauce was a bisque-like flavor, creamy and delicious.

- Wagyu ribeye.  Perfectly season ribeye cooked to medrare perfection.  The HV foie gras put this simple protein, over the edge.

- Dessert - you finally end the magnificent meal with a Trio of simple American favorites.  A peanut butter chocolate bar, a chocolate chip cookie and a mini root beer float.

I honestly never had a tasting menu in which in truly loved ALL the dishes.  This was the Exception.  The restaurant was smaller then I expected, which made it more intimate.  

Service was top notch.  We are fast eaters so usually with fine dining tasting menus there can be a long wait between dishes.  Not here, they immediately caught on to the pace we ate our dishes and the next dishes took no more than a few minutes.  A nice touch.

drinks:

When we walked in at peak dining hour, we were surprised to find the restaurant so empty (not that we mind). En route to the restaurant we did find a lot of activity at other bellagio restaurants which makes me wonder why this place did not attract any crowds. The location is also not as attractive as the other bellagio restaurants facing the musical fountains.

The cocktail we ordered on our server's recommendation was the most disappointing $14 cocktail I've ever had. It just tasted like cucumber water.

We always wanted to try the hamachi crudo and decided to give it a shot. It comes with green apple, winter black truffle, tempura crunch. Everything combined it was very tasty with the tempura providing the crunchy texture.

Our server recommended ""three seas"" tasting of japanese fish, bamboo rice, ginger vinaigrette so went for it. There was scallop, hamachi and snapper. They all tasted the same since the ginger vinaigrette was too overpowering. Paying $45 for that dish was a complete waste of money.

We had the TRUFFLE-STUFFED CHICKEN with SAVOY CABBAGE, SUNCHOKE-PEAR PURÉE, FOI GRAS RICE. There were hardly any truffles to be found in the chicken. moreover, the chicken itself was bland and unseasoned. The savoy cabbage had some flavor and foi gras rice was probably the star of the dish.

The Lobster Pot Pie was delicious, but I did need just a small bit of salt to lift some of the flavor.  That did the trick.

So, I was waiting for this grand plating, but did not get it.  It was still very tasty and I would order it again.  The lobster was very fresh and tender as well as the vegetables.

Now that Foie Gras is banned in CA, I was excited to eat it in Vegas. Foie Gras is always good, and it's no different here. There was a nice sear on the outside, and the inside was very rich and soft. What I really enjoy about Foie Gras is how the livery metallic flavor balances with its fatty richness. The way it was served was pretty typical of fine dining. Cherries and kumquats flanked the plate to add some sweetness and acidity. Besides having the entire lobe carved tableside, the preparation was nothing innovative or inspiring, but it was still flavorful and tasty. In my opinion, Foie Gras is perfectly fine by itself. All it needs is basic seasoning and a nice sear. 

I can see why people rave about the Maine Lobster Pot Pie; it's really good! The sauce was very creamy, rich, and infused with a lot of lobster flavor. I was very glad to see that they keep the lobster shell when they cook it. I'm sure part of the reason why the sauce was so flavorful is because of the shell. I appreciated that the dish was very focused on the succulent lobster flavor. All the ingredients were there to put the lobster flavor at the forefront which made it bold and awesome. 

The only thing I can complain about is that the lobster was overcooked. That's understandable as lobster is so easy to overcook especially when you have to bake a pot pie. If I were to make this dish, I would separate the meat from the shell, and keep the shell in the pot when it's baking. The meat could then be cooked separately and added in the end, so the sauce would still get the lobster flavor from the shell while the meat won't get overcooked. 

After my meal at Michael Mina in Vegas, I feel like I should try the San Francisco location especially now that Ron Siegel is there.",Jl7wukjs3Y0WSQOQQ1vkgw,1,0,4,jKDGpxcGB8zahx8iQIdtqw

My girl friend and I both tried the Chefs tasting menu. $115 each. She had the traditional and I had the seasonal. We picked at each other's plates. I actually liked her menu slightly better but both were exceptional. Some of my favorites were the ahi tuna for both menus (tartare and seaweed and pepper crusted), ribeye and the lobster pot pie. Yum! The Pot pie reminded me of a chunky lobster bisque and the Ribeye was cooked nicely over truffled mash potatoes. There was not one thing in both tastings that I did not enjoy since the flavors throughout the tastings were all so different but comparing the two tastings and weighing the two dishes against each other was fun. 

Presentation was impeccable and the ambiance was very comfortable for a fine dining restaurant.  Proportions were just the right size.

-Tuna Tartare: ancho chile, sesame oil, pine nuts, mint
-Lobster Pot Pie: winter vegetables, truffle-lobster cream
-American Kobe Steak: porcini -butter poached, pommes fondant
-5 Desserts (root beer float/ assorted cookies/ etc)
-Wine Pairing

My recommendation would be to go for the lobster pot pie.  That was a phenominal dish.  

Completely skip the American kobe steak. It was over cooked, dry, tough and I could literally hear myself sawing through the meat with my knife.

Although the menu is not every expansive, each dish was impeccable. I ordered the ""Three Seas,"" which included a trio of fish and well-paired sides. The two standouts for me in the dish were the Chilean sea bass and the sea scallop.  The sea bass was buttery and melt-in-your-mouth while the seared sea scallop had a smoky sear which kept the inside nice and tender.  Although I was initially slightly disappointed by the small pieces of seafood on the plate, the portion was actually quite sizable as I had trouble finishing it all.

Not to be overlooked is the great service my friends and I received.  I have been to a fair share of upscale restaurants and never have I seen more attentive waitstaff. One of my friends excused herself to use the restroom and upon getting up, a waiter swiftly replaced her napkin with a brand new one. As we were about to leave, our server even offered to take our picture by the displays in the lobby of the Bellagio.

4884699,2010-10-03,1,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"We went to Michael Mina (MM) for my Mom's birthday, and had an overall great meal.  Two of us did the tasting menu, and two did a la carte.  We appreciated them letting only half the table do the tasting menu, as many places will make the whole table do the tasting or no one.  The service was great, the Sommelier was one of the best we've seen in Las Vegas, and the food didn't disappoint.  

One service characteristic that gave Michael Mina the 5-stars was their corkage policy.  It really gets to me that everywhere in this town charges at minimum $35 corkage fee, and even worse, they only allow a 2 bottle limit.  What if I am bringing in 8 people?  I'm already overpaying for the food (which I don't mind), but many of these restaurants forget they are in the ""hospitality"" industry.  While MM's corkage was $35, they did not put a 2 bottle limit.  This was especially important because we had 4 people at our table, meaning 2 bottles of wine was not enough (A bottle of wine feeds 4.  But only 3, happily).  We also noticed that they allowed us to bring in a bottle that they had on their list.  While we would not have done this if we had noticed, we appreciated their hospitality they gave us that night by not even mentioning it.  This sense of hospitality is something that many of the fine dining restaurants on the strip are missing, but MM was very hospitable.  As a customer, I want to be able to feel like I can request anything and get it, and they definitely make you feel that way at MM.  

Now to the fun part, the food. The tasting menu was, by far, the best value.  It was $118 for 5 courses of his signature items.  There was only one clunker in this tasting, all the rest were some of the best dishes I have ever had.  The tasting menu consisted of:

1) Tuna Tartare: This was the best tuna tartare I've ever had, by far.  While many people love to point out how popular and typical the dish has become, they often forget that Michael Mina was one of the chefs who made this classic dish very popular.  The tuna was great quality (unlike a lot of tuna used for tartare), and the flavor was fantastic.  A little bit of heat from the chiles, nice texture from the pine nuts, great well-rounded flavor from the sesame oil, and it all binds together with the quail egg.  Great dish.  

2) Maine Lobster Pot Pie: This is, by far, Michael Mina's most popular signature dish.  The Lobster pot pie put Michael Mina on the map, and for very good reason.  This was another fantastic dish, one of the best lobster preparations I have ever had.  The tasting portion was a little smaller than the giant a la carte portion, but it was still a perfect size portion for the tasting menu.  The lobster was tender, succulent, and very flavorful.  The brandy cream was rich, deep, complex, and full of layers of flavor.  Michael Mina attributes much of his success, and specifically this dish, to his experience he has in Baking and Pastry when he first came out of culinary school.  The first two courses of this tasting menu will show you why Michael Mina has so many restaurants.  

3) Phyllo-crusted Sole:  This dish was a major clunker.  The fish itself had great texture, and was cooked perfectly, but the overall dish mechanics were off.  It was served with a horseradish mascarpone, and what seemed to be a dijon beurre blanc (butter sauce).  While this dish was not terrible, it was not great.  The flavors presented were very dulled down, therefore the main flavor in every bite was the horseradish.  This dish was the only one that was not one of MM's signature dishes, and you could tell.  This dish was not bad enough to take away from the other gems, so I could not take my rating down simply because of one dish.  Does an album get ruined by one song? No, and neither does a tasting menu.  

4)  American Kobe Ribeye w/ Seared Foie Gras and Truffled Potato Puree:  Wow!  This is all I can say.  Anyone who knows Michael Mina knows that he is an expert in the use of Foie Gras and Truffles (pretty damn good things to be an expert in), and I think Kobe beef can be added to that list now.  His method of using sous-vide (temperature controlled water bath cooking) to cook the meat, and simply searing it before serving, is another thing that makes Michael Mina unique.  The ribeye was cooked perfect Medium-Rare (just like I ordered) and was topped with a nice chunk of Foie Gras.  The whole thing was on top of creamy, rich, flavorful truffled potatoes.  This dish went perfect with the 2004 Rubicon we were drinking, and was another gem in this tasting menu!

5) Root Beer Float, Opera Cake, Coconut S'more:  The desserts were very good, but nothing too special.  I really liked the root beer float, which was root beer sorbet served inside root beer.  The root beer sorbet had great anise flavor, just like any good root beer should.  And it was served with two warm cookies that made a perfect way to end a meal.  The other cakes weren't too impressive, but very tasty.",icjbGrWlNnkFl_jjSodsEg,4,1,5,L27qEGI9KNGUN8oihiT7Bg

You will note a lack of fancy frills in the energetically elegant room: clearly the focus is on the open kitchen, and more importantly, the food coming from it via the personal, attentive servers. Several menus will be offered, including a Cookbook Tasting which actually notes the pages from which these dishes were taken (a signed copy of Chef Mina's book can be added to your experience). The a la carte menu also includes many of Mina's signature tasting trios, presenting lamb, fish or beef in enticing variations. The only drawback to this arrangement is that you will likely see dishes from different menus that you'll want to try. Sometimes they can accomodate this, sometimes they can't.

If ordering by the dish, you would do well to start with the Michael Mina parfait: A strata of alderwood-smoked salmon, crème fraiche and Osetra caviar on a potato-shallot cake that is a mouth-filling mélange of salt, savory and creamy sweetness. A seasonal menu also offers a novel chilled seafood plate--far from your father's raw bar, this selection of uni, mussels, clams and laughing bird shrimp is a fanciful fresh festival. 

Seafood has always been a Mina specialty, and there are many such satisfying selections here. His signature Maine lobster pot pie serves the perfectly cooked crustacean with a rich black truffle cognac in pastry. Thai Snapper with sunchoke, bok choy, pineapple marmalade, kefir lime and a bacon vineagrette is a dance of earth and ocean in your mouth. The sea scallop with foie gras, phyllo-dusted Dover sole with crab mascarpone brandade, and miso-glazed sea bass are all rich pleasures as well.

From the land, the tasting trio of lamb with different mole sauces is a juicy, aromatic rondo while the Three Sisters plates pork with three fall vegetables. There is an equally inspired Surf & Turf as well.

Chef Mina has always stressed a certain level of autonomy for his restaurant's Executive Chefs; here, the recently appointed Marc St. Jacques is also able to express his creativity in some enticing preparations of his own. Master Sommelier Joe Phillips not only pours apropos pairings, but shares stories of the wine's sourcing. 

This is also the place to impress your vegetarian friends: MM offers a meat-free tasting menu with dishes like White Asparagus Veloute and Artichoke Souffle that look every bit as delectable as the standard menu--they will also adapt other dishes with aplomb. A cheese course, creative desserts and petit fours will end your evening exquisitely.",97TjZvvXtVZY91NEPZXZBQ,0,0,4,9lMPXYDpwFXhT4yOnW-6Hg

Because they have never had a tasting menu and I have never been to a Micheal Mina restaurant, I thought this was the perfect time to check it out.

We ordered the cookbook tasting menu which had the lobster pot pie that I was dying to try. 

Tartare of ahi tuna was first up.  It was served table side and the waiters were wonderful. I have had a LOT of tuna tartare in my life, but this was the first time there was sesame oil, pine nuts, garlic, and mint.  A huge portion, but so fresh I couldn't stop.  I liked and a high point of the night.

Maine lobster pot pie was next. Our waiters were there to cut the top of the pies. Flakey top, comforting, and luxe because of the chunks of lobster...So far right on my hit list.!

Now we go down hill... :(

Miso glazed Chilean sea bass. Ok...to me nothing stood out. There was a dumpling, but really it was like most of the miso sea bass I've had but watered down bc of the broth.

Fourth and the biggest disappointment: American ""Kobe"" ribeye with Foie Gras.  There was a HUGE chunk of foie gras almos tthe size of the meat itself....I was super excited seeing this because I love me some foie gras and would make myself sick on it if I could.  Bummer that the dish was not a sum of it's parts.  Salty, chewy, and for the first time ever...I didn't even want to finish just the foie gras part. 

We finished up with the Trio of Desserts.   Mind you, even though I didn't finish the beef and fish dish, I was still full and I am not a huge dessert fan.  I liked the root beer float though! 

I'm glad I went, but for a Michelin-star level restaurant,  would go with somewhere else next time.",3PTxT1VPDEp9BzLidS0VEw,0,0,3,F_Ff-jP4r3otAJhKo2PtiQ

The phenominal lobster pot pie and caviar parfait are still offered but add to them air flown shellfish on a raw bar, or simply grilled, seasonal crudos and whole in season fish prepared multiple ways.

Two menus work side by side.  One, more ""refined"", the other seasonal and fish house worthy simply titled the ""Market List"".  

Note:  Hawaii yeeps, the ""Market List"" menu is from Hawaii's own Mina's Fish House.

Beginning with the shellfish, offered raw or charcoal grilled with a miso, garlic, yuzukosho (a type of spicy peppercorn) butter, as individual items or platters.  As good as the live Santa Barbara uni are, the grilled live diver scallops steal the show.   Perfectly grilled, a hint of smoke and that heavenly butter that boost the natural sweetness and complexity.

Raw fish?  Do not pass up the signature tuna tartare.  Small chunks of sashimi grade tuna mixed with mint, pine nuts, chilies, and a bit of sesame oil and EVOO.  Like poke on steroids. The pine nuts and sesame add earthiness and a pleasing roundness while the mint, an mild herbal finish.  Crudos (red snapper and yellowfin tuna sampled) are also excellent and showcase the freshness of the fish.  

For mains, it's all about the sharable whole fish.  Three preparations offered, two sampled.  Broiled with ginger and scallions atop baby bok choy, trumpet mushrooms and topped by fermented black beans adds a great salinity and sharp umame notes to the branzino.  The spice crusted then fried madai (snapper) with a coconut green curry and thai basil, bold and very flavorful.  Both examples were perfectly cooked with the flesh being moist throughout.  Despite the delicate nature of the fish, the flavor is enhanced by the seasonings, a mild sweetness and clean, subtle fish flavored goodness.

The lobster pot pie (the dish that drew me from the Bellagio poker room many a time) is still excellent with beautiful root veg, mushrooms, a perfectly poached lobster all in a lobster cream sauce baked in pastry.  The caviar parfait, just think cold smoked salmon, and traditional caviar accompaniments in a tower topped by a your favorite caviar, heavenly.

Very good wine list with an emphasis on seafood worthy old world wines.  Typical resort markup.

Excellent, friendly, knowledgeable service.

5100285,2012-03-02,1,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"LVRW2012: After years of walking past Michael Mina, I finally made it here to sample MM classics at a LVRW price. 

1st COURSE: (Ahi Tuna Tartare) $24 on the Regular Menu. There was a $15 substitution fee but I had no regrets paying it. The Ahi is supposedly flown in fresh everyday from Hawaii.. Can't fact-check that but its an interesting tidbit to gloat about when I'm telling my friends how amazing it was. It was presented beautifully and my server, Alejandro, mixed it at the table. Sesame oil, pine nuts, and mint were the main flavors in this dish--seasoned lightly with salt, pepper, and garlic. It needed a little extra salt... I'm also not used to my tuna tar tar being served with white toast. I found it a little whacky considering it added no flavor and threw me off texturally. 

2nd COURSE: (Phyllo-Crusted Sole) $48 on the Regular Menu. Initially, Alejandro said there was an issue receiving the sole that day and they were substituting salmon. I was quite disappointed but salmon sounded better than steak or chicken at the time. He pleaded my case to the kitchen and magically a sole filet appeared on my plate. Essentially, its pan-fried in butter but its not overbearing in any way. It stays crisp and the warmth melts the horseradish marscapone into a sauce.  Its served on a bed of creamy crab brandade. And the dish is drizzled with a dijon sauce that's pleasantly citrusy.

DESSERT: $10 on the Regular Menu. I was diggin' the Sassafras ice cream Root Beer Float. It had a natural and clean flavor while satisfying my sweet tooth. I didn't have any room for the cookies. But they didn't disappoint--crisp on the outside, gooey on the inside... I took them to-go and they tasted just as good cold. As a bonus, Alejandro brought over a hot apple cider and a sugar cookie. Not necessary but I ate it!

$20.12 Wine Pairing: Worth it. I can't see myself ordering any of them a la carte. But its nice not to have to worry about whats good. And only 20 bucks? ALRIGHT! My server was kind enough to refill my glass a couple of times as well. The riesling and chardonnay complimented the seafood nicely. And the port was a treat at dessert!
    1st: 2006 Mönchhof Robert Eymael Ürziger Würzgarten Riesling Spätlese
    2nd: 2010 Domaine William Fèvre Chardonnay Petit Chablis
    Dessert: 2006 Dow's Port

Service was impeccable! Alejandro was such a polite young man. And every time I took a bathroom break, the serving assistants were ridiculously attentive on the napkin-work and water-filling. All-in-all I'd say this meal was a success. The ambiance is upscale while being cozy and casual.

We are so happy that we did! I have had some amazing meals, but this one stands out as best meal ever. When arriving at the restaurant we were greeted by Jorge, the Manager. When making the reservation we shared that it was my friend's birthday and Jorge went above and beyond to make sure that we enjoyed our night. All of the staff were exceptional. We especially enjoyed our server, Miguel.

One piece of advice: do not waste any of your appetite on the bread.  While it's good bread, the tasting menu is very generous, and I wasn't able to finish my meal.  The highlight of the tasting menu is his signature Lobster Pot Pie.  I also loved the warm cookie on the dessert course.

The portions are also quite large for a gourmet restaurant and I wish I had passed on the bread because I was stuffed by the time dessert came. My only complaint is that the server automatically applied 15% tip to the bill at the end when I gave him my credit card. It wasn't noted anywhere on the bill nor did he tell me that he was going to do so. I ended up leaving an extra 5% on top of it, but I couldn't help but feel like he did this because my wife and I are young. This is the only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars.

I'm just surprised it took me this long to commit (cough)...but alas, I came back like I promised for that lobster pot pie! I even specifically asked when I made reservations if it was available that evening :) 

We ordered the full serving courses, not the tasting menu portions. (as shown in the pictures) 

1. Lobster pot pie - served table side with huge chunks of lobster (2.5 lbs worth); they carve the top crust off the pot pie and put it at the bottom of the plate to serve as the base, and then they put all the vegetables and lobster pieces on top of the crust, so its like an open face pot pie - one of a kind experience

4. desert sampler - i just remember the three desserts were sweet but not too sweet

I guess I could have gone to one of those buffets four times with the money I spent at Michael Mina, and maybe I should have.

Anyway, long story short, I almost mistook my Dover Sole for Filet-O-Fish by Mr. McDonalds. The spoonful serving of corn soup that came before the meal was really good, but I can't really recommend this place just for that.

Here's a breakdown of our tasting menu: 

Domestic Caviar Parfait
Alderwood-Smoked Salmon, Creme Fraiche, Shallot Potato Cake.
A delicately layered presentation consisting of crispy fried potato, cold creme fraiche, smoky cured salmon, and a velvety smooth serving of domestic black caviar.

Asian Pear, Pine Nuts, Scotch Bonnet Infused Sesame Oil
This dish is finished table-side.
The waiter mixes the ingredients before your very eyes.

Miso-Glazed Chilean Sea Bass
Shellfish Dumpling, Dashi Broth
The Sea Bass has a silky, moist and delicate texture. It was mixed with a miso dashi broth and a handmade shellfish dumpling, finished with pea shoots and a sliver of radish.

Lobster Pot Pie
Seasonal Baby Vegetables, Brandied-Lobster Cream
Puff pastry and lobster bisque - two great tastes that taste great together.
This is one of his signature dishes which combines the rich and creamy lobster bisque style brandy sauce with lobster meat, potatoes, and other assorted vegetables beneath a golden and flaky pastry crust.
As the waiter cuts the crust for you table side, the rich, creamy aroma fills the air. I asked him to feed it to me.  He smiled and politely refused.  We had a moment. 

American Wagyu Ribeye Rossint
Hudson Valley Foie Gras, Pinot Noir Reduction
The ribeye was cooked perfectly. The slices are placed atop foie gras and a light vegetable puree. The dish was finished with some black truffle shavings and the Pinot Noir reduction.

Dessert - chocolate cake, pecan candy, warm chocolate chip pecan cookie, root beer float

Having already had a phenomenal culinary experience (you can't just call it a meal) at Gordon Ramsay Steak two nights before, we were really hoping to recreate some of that fine dining euphoria. We figured a Michelin starred celebrity chef's restaurant inside the Bellagio was a good place to start.
First off, I really like the way the menu is set up at Michael Mina. There are lots of different options, tasting menus, pairings etc. However, being the master of communication that I am, I somehow managed to get both our waiter & myself thoroughly confused. Think bad Laurel & Hardy routine. With Sarah translating for me, we cleared up the confusion & settled on the pre theater prix fixe with wine pairing. 
We chose the Tuna Tartare with quail egg, pine nuts & mint (prepared table side- nice touch!), then the Wagyu ravioli with chanterelle cream & parsnip purée. That got the meal off to a fantastic start. The ravioli dish was insane- highly recommended! For our entrees we chose phyllo wrapped sole and the lobster pot pie. 
SPOILER ALERT: The presentation on the lobster pot pie was over the top. They bring out a big pot with pastry baked over the top. Then they cut the pastry off, and serve the dish right on top of it. There are lots of pics of this dish on Yelp but none of them do it any justice, so I didn't even bother. It is very impressive in person. It is also a large and very RICH dish. The phyllo crusted sole was outstanding as well. Really nice paired with Patz & Hall Dutton Ranch Chardonnay.
The meal wrapped up with their signature dessert, root beer floats with sarsaparilla ice cream & warm cookies paired with port.

I had the pre-theater prix fixe for $60 that started with a wonderful salad that had large chunks of feta cheese, crispy little disks of fried pita, and a hummus spread on the side. The appetizer was an homage to a greek salad with a creative twist. For my entree I had the filet which was a perfectly cooked medallion. The side is  bowl of mashed potatoes with a base of short ribs which was a great surprise. By the time dessert came around i was stuffed. The Opera Cake was really good with a nice combination of coffee and chocolate.

We did have to wait a few minutes to have or water refilled even after asking, but that was honestly the only thing I can really think of that wasn't positive.

If you're jonesing for his famous lobster pot pie (which is fabulous, btw) I actually recommend Nob Hill instead. The atmosphere there is better, and I think the offerings there are more interesting. We found the atmosphere at MM to be very blah. Not cozy blah, or sleek blah, just BLAH. 

First things first: The Bellagio cocktail is awesome and I'm happy about that $14 we spent on it. The $20 wine pairing with the restaurant week menu was just ok. I definitely wouldn't spend $10 a glass on either of the 2 wines I was served if I had the decision to do over again .

Course 1: Tuna tartare. This was a typical MM presentation (similar to how he does his kobe tartare). Egg on top, lots of cool seasonings and things on the plate and then mixed in front of you. This didn't disappoint! Tuna was fresh and the pine nuts and mint and whatnot melded perfectly .

Course 2: I had the Miso Cod, my fiance had the ""3 little birds"". The miso cod was extremely bland and flavorless. The miso flavor was way too delicate for me. The table next to me actually complained about the same thing.. maybe it was an off night? This dish was a huge disappointment given it's one of his ""signature"" offerings. Allegedly it used to be sea bass (rather than cod) and it tasted better back in the day.. who knows. The operative word with 3 little birds is LITTLE. There was maybe 5 oz of meat on the plate. 5 oz is a lot of foie gras.. or kobe.. but not freaking chicken/duck/quail for $39. It was however, beautiful and very tasty. No major complaints.. definitely a recommended dish if you like birds and you aren't a big eater. 

Dessert: This took 35 minutes to arrive.. yes, we sat for 35 minutes between main course and dessert. Damn annoying if you ask me. The dessert, however, was excellent! We had the rootbeer float with homemade rootbeer sorbet (rootbeer sorbet covered in rootbeer..kinda stupid but awesome at the same time) and then these awesome warm cookies were on the side.

Service was a little off that day (I suspect because it was busy), but in general this restaurant delivers top notch everything, from decor, to service to food.  

I have had the pleasure of experiencing their vegetarian tasting menu every time and I am repeatedly amazed at the time and attention paid to non-meat items.  Typically vegetarian options in fine dining restaurants are overlooked, but this restaurant puts great care into selecting flavors and textures.  I have told several people that the vegetarian tasting menu at Michael Mina in the Bellagio is the best meal I have ever had, and the offerings for Thanksgiving were no exception.  I appreciate a restaurant that allows me, without a steak or foie gras or seafood, to ALSO savor flavors.  Typically I feel like I'm an imposition to the server because I'm not ordering an expensive entree.

5278991,2018-05-12,4,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Back from a brief hiatus it was on Saturday night that four friends sat down to dinner at a refreshed Michael Mina Restaurant, the kitchen toqued by Chef Nick Sharpe opened up to a brighter dining room where guests are invited to experience a menu that additionally comes across lighter with the focus more than ever shifted to Seafood.

Still located just off the Bellagio Conservatory Gardens, the current Springtime theme as free and elegant as ever, it is immediately upon entry that guests will find themselves greeted at a podium by familiar faces, several longtime servers and managers overlooking both a fully refurbished Bar and Lounge as well as the main seating area.

Adding a private dining room where Dale Chihuly's gallery once stood, a space suitable for twenty complete with customizable music and lighting, it was after a brief tour including an area with fresh Seafood on Ice that guests sat in the center of a room full of crisp linen and chandeliers, light music overhead appropriate to the environment and virtually unnoticed aside from its ability to hush the din of other diners.

Offering a bevy of seasonal Appetizers, Entrees and Desserts in addition to two tasting menus, pre-theater Prix-Fixe and an all-new ""Market List,"" it was with deference to Chef Sharpe and a visiting Gary LaMorte that a Champagne toast kicked off what would turn out to be nearly four hours of great Food and conversation, the bubbles quickly followed by an all-new Bread service replacing Rolls with warm Laffa and Butter with a trio of Kalamata Olive Tapenade, Housemade Hummus and Red Onion Labneh that are replenished as necessary throughout the evening.

Maintaining only a few of Chef Mina's Signatures, the shift to several tableside presentations and large-format whole Fish preparations necessitating the change, it was starting out light that a crisp Meringue was shattered with a spoon spilling contents of King Crab amidst fresh-shucked Peas and Mint, the tiniest of Turnips offsetting sweetness and offering a pleasant lead-in to Mina's iconic Caviar Parfait that has recently been freshened up through the addition of fragrant Onion Syrup.

Coursed out slowly but never noticeably lagging, the slowest diner's pace dictating the flow, it was with one member of the group enjoying Wine pairings that course three saw five raw bites served on a wave of glass, the Ocean Trout with citrusy Salsa particularly noteworthy though so-too was a snappy slice of Amberjack dressed to impress with Ginger, Snap Peas and Holy Basil. 

Expectedly offering a variety of Shellfish, the Charcoal grilled Platter standing out thanks to both the quality of its constituents and the added umami of Red Miso Butter that contributed particularly well to Scallops, it was in another Japanese inspiration that course five built around Tempura battered Asparagus with additional grilled segments and luxurious Caviar Cream added tableside.

Updated but never forgetting a classic, both the legendary Whole Foie Gras and Michael's Rootbeer Float available to those giving the Restaurant at least 24-hours notice, it was with a glass off 2014 Sauternes poured that longtime General Manager Jorge Pagani carved the Liver before placing segments atop Mango Chutney, Greek Pastry and Pistachios, each bite pure decadence and probably best shared by tables of six while the same is also safe to say regarding the Ginger-perfumed Kona Kampachi flown in daily from Hawaii and dressed with fermented Black Beans alongside Rice and Mushrooms.

Turning Pastries over to the skilled Monica Delgadillo, a half-pour of late-harvest Austrian Wine just sweet enough to pair, it was as the group awaited a faultless Milk Chocolate Soufflé piped with Creme Anglaise and large enough to share that attentions focused on a bowl titled ""Strawberry Granita,"" the designation doing what lies beneath hardly enough justice as the Panna Cotta eats more like Greek Yogurt given vibrancy by fresh Strawberries and what can best be described as crumbled Financiers.

*****Rounding out the evening with two types of Chocolate as the crowd finally began to thin, not one unsatisfied face in a room that at times appeared completely full, it can only be said that Michael Mina and his team have continued to raise the bar even as his empire grows, this recent meal easily the best yet and arguably placing Michael Mina Restaurant amongst the five best fine dining destinations in Sin City.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,13,5,_DJIOlWO8yreSArFkN51bQ

Everything was prepared beautifully and tasted so elegant. We were both pleasantly surprised how on the ball they were at every step of the way.

Out of all of the awesome items we had, I think the best tasting was the lobster pot pie and the Kabocha squash ravioli. The 2nd best were the domestic caviar parfait.

5294760,2018-01-03,1,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"We came for dinner to celebrate our friend's birthday. Easy to find within Bellagio and with nice elegant decor but unfortunately no view of the fountain outside. Overall the dinner was a hit and miss and I'll give you the highlights here.

Wine: Quite an extensive selection like more nice restaurant in Vegas. I was looking at a bottle of Brunello and asked our waiter what he thought. His response was ""Oh that's a nice Super Tuscan... mix of Sangiovese and Cab"". I know he wasn't the sommelier but please train your waiters to know the wines a little. Everything he said was simply not true. I just went with my own decision, ended up being a good bottle.

Unfortunately for my own meal, seems with going with our waiter's suggestions were just mistakes. I got the Phyllo Crusted Sole on his recommendation. This appeared to be by far the weakest entree of our entire table. It's really just a breaded sole filet over some mashed potatoes. In taste, creativity and presentation, I expect this to be served at a $$ restaurant, not at Michael Mina. 

Should have learned my lesson but I went with the suggested coconut tapioca for dessert. It's just a bowl of tapioca and some coconut flavoring and some mini fruit pearls on top. The colors were pretty but taste quite subpar. To make up for the fact the lackluster ingredients, the serving was unappetizingly huge.

Reason for still giving them 3 stars. They were able to accommodate my off-menu request of a seared foie gras appetizers. It was a large serving, well cooked and I enjoyed the jams that came with it. The rest of the party seemed to like their food. Standouts there include the Ahi Tuna Tartare that is mixed at the table, as well as the (albeit very expensive) Lobster Pot Pie that was painstakingly presented and served tableside. 

The last thing I was disappointed with was the fact that even though I mentioned that we were celebrating a birthday on my reservation on OT, there was no acknowledgement at all during our dinner. I actually decided against calling in ahead of time because I figured they would see that online comment as most other fine dining establishments I've been to in the past have and do something special on their own initiative.

 So as you can see, my dining experience at Michael Mina definitely did not live up to expectation as I really like Pabu in Boston. There are many other options on the Strip for a great meal.",0Pd-LScDP0zLf4ShnV8L0Q,2,1,3,AdRRh61joPjhNUFH6Jksdg

My husband and I spilt a root beer float, which comes with warm cookies. Not what you would expect from fine dining but the waiter recommended it and it was good. The cookies were warm and delicious.

Wagyu Short Rib Ravioli:
Ravioli with wagyu short rib with arugula on top with parmesan foam, natural jus and parsnip puree. The short rib was super tender as expected. I loved the parmesan foam and the arugula gave the dish some crunch and pepper-y taste. 4/5

Heirloom Tomato Soup:
Tomato soup with a side of toasted brioche with Maine lobster on top. If you think grilled cheese and tomato soup is a great combination, think again! 5/5

Filet of Beef:
Comes with fingerling potatoes, sylvetta, a small cube of braised beef and root veggies. My sister ordered filet cooked medium but it was closer to medium-well. Medium-rare would have been perfect. The filet still came out tender though. 4/5

Lobster Pot Pie:
Baby veggies including green beans, white beans, carrots; a whole lobster in truffle lobster cream.  The color and the type of veggies in this dish threw me off a bit and reminded me of a Filipino dish called kare-kare. Although this was good and is one of Michael Mina's signature dishes, it's not the best lobster pot pie I've had. 4/5

Michael's Root Beer Float:
Root beer float with a chocolate straw, and 2 freshly-baked chocolate chip and nut cookies.  The cookies were really good and warm. The root beer has sassafras. There was ice cream that got stuck in my chocolate straw - I tried to suck as hard as I can but no root beer was coming out so I had to gently blow air into the straw to unclog it. It worked. 4/5

Chocolate Candy Bar:
Peanut, chocolate and pretzels.  Similar to Take 5 chocolate bar sans caramel. A bit too sweet for my taste. 3.5/5

5430370,2008-08-04,1,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"I went to Las Vegas for business and was not nearly excited about the trip as my coworkers were- I am not a gambler so that the thought of going to overly crowded tacky Las Vegas was not high on my list of places I wanted to visit.  After I got over pouting about having to go to Las Vegas I realized that there are a lot of great restaurants there and to make the trip more fun I would treat myself to dinner at one of them.  After reviewing many menus and because of my SF Bay Are roots I decided on Michale Mina.

I had a 6:30 reservation for one and was seated right away when I walked in. (I have absolutely no problems eating alone at nice restaurants; I had a good books to read and I like to people watch while I savor my food.) I was seated at a table near the kitchen's expediting area but this was not a bad thing for me because I like watching the kitten's activity.  This area is open anyway for the guests to see.

The waiter was over right away and  had I a Hanger One (good call on the Bay Area Vodka Chef Mina!) dirty martini with blue cheese olives (there were also garlic and jalapeno olives to choose from) I also got a bottle of Fuji water- I did not really realized I had ordered something other than tap water but when it came I did not complain. (although it was $8!) 

I always ask servers in restaurants fro their recommendations or favorites on the menu.  I came here expecting to order the 5 Course Cook Book Menu but once I looked at the a la cart options I weighed my decisions with the waiter.  He seemed very impressed with my a la cart selections and recommended that I go with them.  He also offered to have the kitchen do a half order of the mussel souffle (which was not an option on the menu).  

The kitchen sent over a taste of fois gras with some sort of glee on top.  I was already in heaven savoring the rich taste.  The bread choices were great and I selected something different each time the bread server came around.  I had the trio of scallops to start,  the (half order) mussel souffle and the seared Ahi Tuna for my main course.  Presentation was beautiful for everything and the flavor and freshness of each was also amazing.  One bit of my greens with the tuna were gritty - which was a disappointment, but probably the only one of the night.  I had coffee and the trio of cakes for dessert.  At this points I was so full that I did not eat very much.  There was also a mini dessert sent out from the kitchen at the end- I can't remember exactly but it was some kind of frozen chocolate lollipop. 

I also watched the tables around me and what they ordered- the table side presentation of the tuna tartar was great to watch.  I also noticed that the staff was very considerate in substituting items from the a la carte menu to the tasting and cook book menu which was a considerate suprise.

Service was probably the best that I have ever had.  I never once filled up my water from the bottle sitting on my table, there was always someone there to do it.  The assistants to the waiter and the waiter were always around to get me anything I needed.  I worked in a restaurant for a while so I tend to be critical of staff, especially in a place like this because I expect a lot, and I was not disappointed.  Additionally a lot of the expediters were very young and I was impressed with their promptness and professionalism.

This was a great experience.  I do not know if I will ever be back to Las Vegas but if I am this will be top of my list.",d24VuwXubL8rwRtn5RAzWw,1,2,5,HFIrTzDMEOwvl_xjy9VztA
5431073,2014-01-04,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"My dinner at Michael Mina was one of the best, most memorable meals I've ever had - certainly worthy of my big 100th yelp review!

I arrived right at opening on a Thursday evening to sample the pre-theater tasting menu. It's a fantastic deal for just $65 and includes your choice of an appetizer, entree, and dessert from an abbreviated list. I went with the sweet corn ""brûlée,"" the phyllo crusted filet of sole, and the root beer float. The brûlée was exquisite - one of the most beautiful dishes I've ever had and my hands down favorite course of the meal. It was basically a salad consisting of some artfully arranged raw peashoots, hearts of Palm, and shaved corn, all enveloping a delicate, corn-flavored jello topped with a shaved truffle and a sugary brûléed crust on top. The dish was light, delicate, and subtly flavored, but its unexpectedness, originality, and use of fresh, seasonal ingredients made it such a joy to eat. (I believe they keep the dish on the menu year round but rotate the vegetable base depending on seasonality - I came during late summer when corn was in season.) Definitely a must order! Similarly, the sole was light and delicate despite being pan fried in a crispy panko-esque phyllo dough crust. It wasn't too greasy at all and was served accompanied by a mild Dijon sauce and mascarpone, perched atop a generous portion of luscious crab brandade (basically mashed potatoes). Unfortunately, the brandade made the underside of the filet mushy - I wish it had been plated differently. My meal concluded with the root beer float accompanied by two incredibly soft, moist cookies. Loved the subtle hint of sassafras in the icy, not too dense or heavy ice cream. I took the cookies to go because I was pretty stuffed at that point, but by some godly miracle they maintained their melty gooeyness even after they had cooled. 

To be honest, with the exception of the brûlée, the food was far from the best I've ever had - while I appreciate Mina's classic point of view and use of simple, subtle flavors, the sole and the float lacked creativity and a punchy ""wow"" factor. So what made this meal deserving of a 5 star woohoo!!! as good as it gets? THE SERVICE. I'm a pretty low maintenance kind of gal, but my waiter truly made the dinner special. He was patient, professional, made great suggestions, and took the time to carefully walk me through the menu and answer my questions. He truly went above and beyond to accommodate me and my preferences - I.e. He worked with the kitchen to have my sole pan fried in olive oil rather than butter and he had balsamic/olive oil brought out instead of butter to accompany my bread. He also paced me through the meal perfectly without rushing me at all, as I had a flight to catch immediately afterwards. 

Overall, MM is truly representative of what a fine dining experience should be, IMO - modern and upscale but not stuffy or pretentious, fresh and delightful food with a point of view, and most of all, overly accommodating service fit for royalty.",9uIclQgMKYSt9qOZIEgBWg,0,0,5,gPG0QoHtQ4gmn13j2e-5qg

The size is very intimate and the staff were very friendly. Roy always ask if you're allergic to any types of fish and that's very reassuring to know he cares about his customers. It can get busy on the weekends, so it's best to come as early as possible to get a good seat. Patrons are friendly and has the small town feel. 

Sushi was very very fresh! 

Service was excellent!

When the family wanted to have a special Christmas dinner in Las Vegas, they searched all over and decided on Michael Mina. 

Reason for picking Michael Mina was the:

Triple AAA Four Diamond Award 
Michelin Award

It's located inside the Bellagio Conservatory, right next to the Bellagio Café and features views of the Bellagio pool area. Reservations were highly recommended, so we made one 2 weeks in advance. Our host and servers were very courteous and lived up to the 5 star rating, as well as the food.

They only had a pre-fix menu during Christmas and was $115 per person!

I ordered:

AHI TUNA TARTARE
-ancho chili, mint, pine nut, sesame oil

Included: LOBSTER POT PIE
-seasonal vegetables, brandied-lobster cream

8 OZ ANGUS FILET MIGNON
-truffle potato, braised wagyu shortrib

CHOCOLATE CUSTARD
-candied pecans, bourbon toffee, whipped cream

The food and presentation was a huge win! I never thought I'd be eating at Michael Mina's restaurant inside the Bellagio but it was a special occasion and we wanted to make it very memorable, so Michael Mina ftw. 

The clientele is obviously very classy but you don't need to wear formal attire to eat here. I saw some guests wearing casual clothing and looked like they just walked from the strip.",j-1qkha4h87wMfNfwPvfqQ,9,7,5,eDJSQ9JzkDWURsW92DbjmQ

This year I started with the foie gras and it did not disappointment...sauteed perfectly, buttery smooth....mouth watering reliving the moment.  The production of the pot pie and the richness of the sauce...basically food porn.  The only thing they fall a few points short on is dessert.  If you want dessert go to Mastro's or maybe the Carnegie Deli in The Mirage.  Everyone else loved their food!  The kabocha squash and pear soup looked amazing and the bibb salad and the fish special.  The decor is elegant, maybe not as trendy or spectacular as some of the new designs but sophisticated.

I have to say that the food exceeded my expectations.
we both got the tasting menu that was amazing, all dishes cooked to perfection, an array of fishes and seafood and a buttery piece of kobe beef to finish! my favorite was the foie gras with figs,and I really enjoyed the salsify soup, as well as the caviar amuse bouche. The warm toasted bread accompaniment is a whipped ricotta with honey....DELICIOUS!!!
the chef visited our table which was a nice touch to add a pretty face to this meal.

5496937,2016-10-01,2,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"Very good but not over the top amazing, would be my tl;dr.

My lady friend and I went to here because we were staying at the Bellagio and I'm not a super huge fan of walking to anywhere else.  Plus it's Michael Mina, and I hadn't been here yet.  So forget about that first part about me being too lazy to walk anywhere, we went here because Mina is awesome and I hadn't been here yet.

I had the signature tasting menu, she had the seasonal.  She also had the premium wine pairing because she's a thirsty biz.  All told it was about four hundred bones plus tip IIRC.

And it was very good.  

Since we got different tasting menus, it means she let me taste her menu.  And by ""let me"" I mean ""I snatched some food off her plate while she was busy drinking her wine pairing.""  So I basically had both, and here is what I think about them:

Lobster pot pie is pretty awesome.  If you get it as an entree (not getting the tasting menu) it comes out in a copper trough.  If you get it as part of the tasty menu, it comes in a ceramic ramekin.  It seems like plenty in the ramekin though.  Like you're not getting a 0.2 ounces of lobster flakes with a  pastry side, there's multiple nice big chunks of lobster in there.  Like maybe 1/3 of a decent sized tail.

As part of the tasting menu you get plenty of lobster pot pie but ordered ala carte its a giant amount of lobster pot pie but you should probably also order an app and a side.  That may be slightly cheaper or near the same as the tasting menu.  It just really depends on how much you want to give up other stuff to eat a ton of lobster pot pie, is what I'm saying.

A man sitting next to us ordered the ala carte lobster pot pie and it came out in an enormous copper pot and the waiter dude cut all around the top pastry with his knife and then the man plunged his entire head into the pot like he was bobbing for apples.  He came up with a full lobster tail in his mouth and started giving the Nixon V for victory with both hands, so I guess he liked it as well.

Other stuff about the signature menu:

The tartare course was solid.  Great taste and a good amount of tuna.  I've had some tuna tartare courses where I felt kinda screwed because you got like 0.5 ounces of tuna, but this was not that.  Nice serving of good tunas.

Wagyu and foie gras was great.  Really good.  Cooked perfect.

Sea bass was awesome.  I ate all the fish and then slurped all the dashi out of the bowl and then there was a little bit left so I dipped my fingers in it and rubbed it all over my face, it was that good.  My gf didn't like that so much, but she was busy drinking wines so who cares.

Seasonal menu stuff:

Caviar was great.  The gf isn't a huge caviar fan so i managed to eat at least 3/4 of this and it was excellent.

The Diver Scallops course is false advertising and I have already contacted a lawyer about this.  It's one scallop.  But it's listed on the menu as Diver Scallops.  It's one biggy scallop, which is totally normal for a non main course, but they still lied.  DROP THE S, MINA.  It's just one.  Was good though.

Sweet corn ravioli.  Did not taste.  Reason I did not taste was because this thing was the size of a postage stamp and that is difficult to share.

Lamp chops:  The beef was better.  Still super good, but not as good as the beef and foie gras.

Deserts: Very good but you're gonna be stuffed by then anyway.  I did very much appreciate that they had like three deserts for each tasting menu.  Like you got a peanut butter (or passion fruit) thing that was the main attraction but your also got a rootbeer ice cream float thing, plus a warm chocolate cookie thing.

Aaaaaanyway.  Bottom line.  Great restaurant.  Great service.  I just don't think it's quite good enough to get five stars for a higher end Vegas restaurant.  I.e. I think I'd go back to Joel's before I'd go back to Michael's.  But that's kinda like saying maybe I'd rather have a Ferrari than a Lamborghini.  They're both good, I just slightly prefer one to the other.

tl;dr scroll up and start at the top again, you lazy hump.",Kwabq2SeJwbJMnp1bVO2sg,0,0,4,I88oip6HNwMV-CAikRcLmw
5503176,2015-03-27,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,The food tastes good and it better for $50 a plate. The price point is about $60. for a 6oz steak. I must say I think my $100 would have been more rewarding with Bernie Madoff than Michael Mina's rip-off dishes. I think the portions of the food alone are reason enough to think twice about eating here. It did taste good but I'll be sick to my stomach over how ripped off I got.

I do know my group in its entirety had seafood of some sort and that it was all delicious. It was paired with great wine, and the dessert was the best part (passionfruit something, I just know it was incredible!). We celebrated my friends birthday and they gave her four lovely truffles (which she did not share because they were too yummy ).

Ambiance is nice, if a little dated. Or maybe that's not quite right. It's very pretty and elegant, it just felt exactly as you'd expect it to be, and that was a little boring. Definitely feels like somewhere my parents would go more than myself (just based on looks alone).

Prices are high, but it's Vegas. And the food really is delicious so it's okay. Just treat yourself!

I don't know that I'd go out of my way to come back, but not because I had a bad experience, just that it wasn't absolutely amazing, and there are a lot of other places to check out in Vegas.",a4IgqHdva08RBnEV73Qk3g,1,0,4,ND6xZZNXThz5AMX2LHnovA

I started with the Sweet Corn Soup with Crab Fritters which single-handedly takes the award for best dish of the trip.  It had a potent, creamy corn flavor topped with little bites of fried crab.

For the entrée, I ordered the Loin of Veal which came with rainbow chard (I am seeing chard everywhere these days), glazed sweetbreads, and truffle sauce.  It was supple and juicy.

5548805,2016-09-18,2,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"What a disappointing overall experience! That Michelin Star should be ripped off the wall. 

Had 8 P.M. Reservations for 2 and had requested a quiet table in the back. They accommodated us at a very nice table, albeit 15 min after our reservation but not bad. From then on downhill. 
1) Waiter came by and asked bottled or tap water. First of all if a restaurant of this supposed caliber can't even filter the water they serve to guests so they can try and run up the bill with overpriced bottled water then you have already lost my respect. When I heard that I should have trusted my instincts and left but I reluctantly said tap. Sadly it was actually tap water they poured, chlorine smelling and awful tasting. 
2)handed the menus by our server who was awful all night, seems like he was trained at a Denny's. He then left never introducing himself or the restaurant. 10 minutes go by and nothing, no bread, no drink order, nothing. He eventually comes back and simply says what will you have. So i ordered the tuna tartare, lobster ravioli as our apps. Then the famous pot pie and a 12 oz strip for the main. Along the way I asked do you recommend this or how's that and his answer for everything was its good. I then also order a bottle of wine and he takes off. About another 15 min go by and nothing and then he comes back to the table and says what wine did you order again? 
3) after reconfirming our wine order bread finally comes, 1 dinner roll each nothing special just a dinner roll. 
4) 30 minutes pass without a peep from the server, he finally comes over and says you want another roll? So I ask how much longer until the food comes out in which his reply 1 minute. So 10 minutes later still no bread and an hour since we get there. apps finally come out. Tuna tartare was good but served with sliced wonder bread, very weird. Lobster ravioli were good but lacked seasoning. 

5) shortly after main arrives, they are dropped off by another server and we're both disappointing. The pot pie had nice presentation but lacked flavor in the meat and sauce. The steak was cheap tasting and had quite a bit of nerves in it, my wife had to spit out like 4 bites of her half. 

Server never came around, said his name, or made any comment about the less than stellar food. So $260 later we left feeling like we wasted our time and money here. 

I can honestly say that this restaurant has to cater to tourists and the ignorant because the food and service are undeserving of a decent Yelp review let alone a Michelin star.
Michael Mina should be ashamed that a restaurant that carries his name should be run this poorly by untrained inattentive staff who do as little work as possible to earn a tip. Do yourself a favor and eat anywhere else in the Bellagio.",OFPDxfHyNkAuYZkCV_yNww,8,0,2,aDmJJI6-5nZbvOz3COC-6g

5560201,2012-08-07,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"SPECTACULAR! I'm honestly struggling to think if my wife and I have ever had a better dinner! I actually made our reservation via OpenTable and was amazed at the table they gave us. It was in a corner by the windows overlooking the pools and most certainly must have been one of the more intimate and private tables in the restaurant. Our servers were exceptionally attentive and personable. We both had the tasting menu with the optional wine pairing....as I said previously....SPECTACULAR! A culinary delight. I'm certain the food would have been exceptional on its own but when expertly paired with the appropriate glass of wine.....gastronomical heaven! It was actually quite fun to sip the wine on its own and then see how it changed with the dish. The food portions were actually quite large and the wine pours were also fairly generous. We have had tasting menu's before that left alot to be desired in regards to portion size. That was not at all a problem here. The dessert sampler was out of this world. We initially thought we were going to only choose one of the desserts but then they brought these huge samplers for each of us. The meal was paced very well....we certainly were not rushed but nor did we feel like we were sitting around and waiting between the courses.

I'm on the verge of saying this was actually a bargain for what it was. We had a couple bottles of Pelligrino with dinner and each had a cappuccino following dinner. The bill was around $400 with the tip and they didn't even charge us for the cappuccino or one of the bottles of water. Not cheap by our standards but it was truly worth every penny.

Pre-theater menu $68/per person + $35/per person wine pairing

Recommended:

Ahi Tuna Tartare (add $15 to menu price) - they mix this table side and it's a nice way to wet the appetite. The tuna is fresh and the tartare mix is light and refreshing.

Lobster Pot Pie (add $32 to menu price) - I debated whether to add this to the menu, but I'm a lobster fan. This was served table side as well and the pie crush is served beneath the lobster. It was hearty and the presentation unique.

Service - professional, friendly and timely

5585761,2014-09-29,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"We had an early dinner reservation on a Sunday evening so we could see Cirque de Soleil's O. We chose to go a la carte as my wife wasn't interested in the prix fixe menu selections. I had the artichoke salad, which sounded amazing. It was a deconstructed salad, laid out on a long, thin plate. Pretty to look at, not too great to eat. The slices of artichoke heart were good, the dressing was thick and on the bottom of the plate. Two fairly large croutons mean you had two bites of crouton to go with your salad. Meh, I make better salads at home. 

My wife started with the onion soup, a lovely, creamy soup. Beautiful and delicious. I wish I had ordered that. 

My wife had the Dover sole in phyllo pastry.  Cooked perfectly, with a nice light sauce. I had the braised beef, which was cooked perfectly and it was delicious.  The roasted root vegetables were four small root vegetables placed around the plate. The potato was literally one small bite. The other three of its buddies were smaller. Is there some new vegetable famine I haven't heard about?  

The wine list was loaded with expensive wines. The cheapest two or three were all over $95.00. Some of the $100-$120 bottles are available at grocery stores anywhere for less than $25.00. I have no problem paying two times retail, but four times retail just isn't right. Our waiter was clearly disappointed that we each ""just"" had two mixed drinks each and he did a lees-than-perfunctory job for the rest of the evening.  

I asked for a description of the root beer float dessert. His reply, "" If you liked root beer floats when you were a kid you'll like this.""  You know, pal, for $15.00 it ought to be a lot better than the root beer floats I had as a kid. I had the chocolate bar for dessert. What a stupid name for a great dessert. A small bowl with a light chocolate cream with a dollop of ice cream in the center, and on a second plate an elegant rectangular chocolate bare that I can,t describe, but it was luscious.  

I asked our waiter about the sauce the ice cream was in and he said, ""it's some kind of cream sauce.""  Seriously. He said that. 

My wife and I used to frequent the longest-running 5-star restaurant in the country, so we are used to fine dining and high prices. Our waiter was weak, the rest of the staff were very good. The food was very good, but not great. The salad was a disappointment and the garnishes were pathetic. 

The mixed drinks were good, but at just under $15 anyone can make a good Plymouth gin and tonic. Ice, Plymouth gin, tonic water and a wedge of lime. The wine list was overpriced unless you were in the $150-250 per bottle range, where things were generally two times retail or a little more.  

We have had better meals in Vegas, lots better meals in Seattle, and we still miss La Maisonette in Cincinnati which had world-class food AND service. For the money, not a great deal.  Three stars. If I didn't know the cost, maybe four stars.",4Nkw_c7yuubNd241bhfWaQ,0,0,3,v62rp5RYc1uxxe7QL1wd7Q

        I've always been a fan of chef Michael Mina Restaurants Group across the US. Michael Mina here with the head chef Ben Jenkins, serves up refined dishes such as truffle-stuffed Jidori chicken, the ever-popular Maine lobster pot pie that available in MM San Franciso, Bourbon Steakhouses and Arcadia Steakhouse in Silicon Valley, the Ahi Tuna Tartare and 2 ways foie gras dishes

     The wine list here is stunning, imagine that the sommelier here can pull any bottle from the Ballagio cellar for you, think of 90,000 bottles; the most impressive wine cellar in the US, as if you have enough on your M Life card to get comp! Wouldn't that be nice? 

      Think of a good evening, during my work at CES 2014, dropping it at the bar, without any RSVP, got the Master Sommelier/Bellagio Wine Director Mr. Jason Smith, just happened to be there, personally and poured you a glass or 2 of Champagne and some of the wines that off-the-menu for you. And the GM Mr. Douglas Martin is always there to greet you, to make sure you have a grand time, an impeccable service,  that I feel like a queen each time I come here. 
      
- The Michael Mina's signature ahi tuna tartare,  ancho chile, ancho chile, sesame oil, pine nuts, mint was always delicious here.

-  Hudson valley foie gras duo - You got the pan seared and the mousse,  spice cake, fig jam, roasted apple - Yelper JULIE K. enjoyed it very much with me. If you are from California and can't get foie gras, come to Michael Mina at the Bellagio for some of the best foigras 2-ways here.

- CAVIAR parfait, is the way to go, ALWAYS when I'm here, with cold Belverdere Vodka, oh life is good, indeed!

-  Chilean sea bass, miso glaze, dashi broth, shellfish dumpling - this was perfectly moist on every bit, delish. 

- Colorado lamb rack* glazed ricotta gnudi, tagine vegetables, lamb jus - it was so juicy and tender, ask YELPER JULIE K. 

     Every dish was perfect, during this CES 2014 week, I've dined at over 30 restaurants and Michael Mina remains 1 of my FAVORITE of all times in Vegas. I've been here countless time, each and every time it just kept getting better than the last, I don't know how they do it! But keep it up, because I'm coming back for 5 more trips in 2014 :-)

    Another reason why I love this location, it's right by the famous Bellagio garden, stunning all seasons long, and Bellagio is always my first choice of stay, because of my gracious VIP host! If you visit Michael Mina at the Bellagio, please tell GM Douglas I say HELLO :-)

I loved my experience here because the food was exceptional, waiters were nice & friendly, and presentation was stellar. I also pulled my picky self together and asked them to move us to a bigger table and they did this immediately which was very satisfying.

ordered:
1.) Thai-Style 'Kobe' Beef Carpaccio
Glass Noodles, Cilantro, Chile, Toasted Peanuts - This was lovely. It was VERY good! A++
2.) Butter Poached Maine Lobster
Sweet Potato Crpe, Thai Coconut Cream - This was so delicious, I felt like I got a million different flavors from it. I was a bit sad it was small because I just wanted to eat more of this dish..A
3.) Chocolate
Gianduja Semifreddo, Praline Crunch, Caramel Mousse, Warm Chocolate Cake, Mocha Anglaise -Really good combination of desserts..loved it!

The reason as to why I'd knock off .5 stars is because perhaps I had slightly higher expectations because of the name of this place.. nonetheless the food was great, oh and our waiter gave us some extra dessert for free which was really sweet of her :)

Pros:
+ nice setting
+ they change all your utensils and plates several times which was nice
+ waiters are at every corner  waiting to re-fill your drinks
+bathroom was really pretty, too :)

Cons:
- just a tad bit pricy..but then again, it's Michael Mina's...what do you expect.",ibvH1Y7Rh_tstiWgH0OFTA,0,0,5,FfAkzegRqnTp-E_0wc508A

Not overly creamed, it is surprisingly light.  The mushrooms and truffle add a nice fragrance and earthiness that contrasts with the lobster essence.  The crust is buttery and flaky building up an almost croissant-like experience.  I have dreams about this dish at night.  Lobster rarely is served justice when cooked as a dish, but Michael Mina has definitely made it worthy of one of the best things I've ever stuck in my mouth.

Service was sophisticated without being snooty, an appreciated balance for such a lovely white tablecloth restaurant. We were greeted promptly by the hostess and the GM (?) bid hello to us as we passed him walking to our table. We were surprised by a glass of champagne as I had noted in the reservation that we were celebrating our anniversary -- nice touch!

Since it was our first visit, we opted for the Signature tasting menu, which features six courses of the restaurant's greatest hits ($115pp).

- Domestic Caviar Parfait: a lovely tower of crispy potato, smoked salmon, creme fraiche, and black caviar, this dish was an innovative presentation of a classic flavor combination.
- Tartare of Ahi Tuna: they mix this table-side but our server was very considerate and asked me if I would like to take a ""before"" picture! i really enjoyed the asian-inspired flavors and the portion was generous.
- Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass: absolutely loved the buttery Patagonian toothfish swimming in a delicate dashi-based broth. the dumpling and bok choy were A-OK.
- Lobster Pot Pie: definitely a show-stopper of a dish! creamy lobster-brandy sauce bathing fingerling potatoes, lobster knuckles, and other hidden treasures lie beneath a golden and flaky pastry crust that is sawed off table-side. with all the butter involved though, it's not for the faint of heart!
- American Wagyu Ribeye Rossini: the steak was perfect - bright red medium-rare/rare with an even, crunchy sear. it was topped with a (very small) morsel of foie and generous shavings of black summer truffle. a decadent combination of delicacies!
- Mascarpone Cheesecake with Huckleberries and Vanilla Crumble: we received a surprise ""pre-dessert"" course in celebration of our anniversary! the cheesecake was airy and light, while the huckleberry compote (?) was nice and tart.
- Lincoln's Candy Bar: a trio of a Snickers-esque bar, a warm chocolate chip cookie, and a root beer float. the bar was sinfully good, the cookie was OK, but the float stole the show! the sassafras ice cream and chocolate straw were the perfect way to end an already great meal.

Ravioli was cooked perfectly and was interesting in flavor with a hint of orange. They prepare the tuna tartare at the table. Great blend of spices and Asian pear to balance the heat. 
I had the lobster pot pie which was prepared table side. You get a whole pan so you definitely get your money's worth if you are ok with the $85 market price. The cream was perfect with the crispy pie. I savored every bite and I'm sure you will too. The hubby got the filet of beef which was perfectly cooked and tasted amazing with the short rib and mashed potato. Both dishes flawless in presentation and so flavorful.

3.) Sea Bass 10/10- This was by far my favorite dish. The dashi was so succulent (I wanted seconds after this dish!)

4.) Lobster pot pie (4/10)- I don't understand this dish. The lobster was chewy and dry. The dish is way too rich and salty.

5.) Wagyu Ribeye  8/10 - Amazing Rib eye, but the foie pairing was too much at this point after eating the lobster pot pie.

- Phyllo-Crusted Sole: Simply AMAZING.  The fish was cooked perfectly and the crust provided a great contrast in texture.

My boyfriend made reservations for our anniversary before heading out to the club. The waiter was real nice and quick. To start off their half shell Kushi Oysters were delicious, the presentation was nice and had a unique taste to their sauce. It was def. fresh and cold just the way i like it. 

They hand you a Ipad to order any cocktail drinks and dessert which was cool. It was very well detailed and the pictures was a plus. the cocktail was more on the fruttier side that didn't taste like it had any alcohol at all. 

Their Filet Mignon was prepared nicely, small portion but it did fill us up.

They do have photographers walking around snapping pictures and we ended up buying a package lol. She made us pose in different ways and complimented us very well, it also came with a frame. The lady was nice enough to even send the pictures to our room since we didn't have any time left.

One of my friends opted to try out the seasonal tasting menu since he's had the cookbook before. Since it has been a while since I've dined there, less than a year, but more than 6 months, I cannot remember the differences except for one: his had hamachi sashimi for one of the courses.  However, I do remember my dishes, two, in particular - the lobster pot pie and the Kobe ribeye with the foie gras... HEAVENLY. I still dream about the lobster pot pie to this day. It was difficult to finish off the whole tasting menu because before the first course came out we were already drunk - i'd like to note that the pinot noir was really good (not as good as the one I had at Comme Ca). I can never remember the names of the wines, although I wish I did because I would definitely order it again. 

I wish I could frequent this place more often, but price-wise it is quite steep. I do recommend that everyone should dine here at least once, just to experience the lobster pot pie!

The bartender was friendly and encouraged me to try the Powell Street Shandy.  If you were looking for something refreshing, this drink is like drinking a mojito or the brazilian caipirinhas. Instead of mint the drink uses muddled lime leaves.  Very good.

I had made reservations prior to coming to Las Vegas.  For this restaurant I would encourage this.  The staff was accommadating when we arrived early.  They sat us when we were ready.  The waiters quickly introduced themselves.  Both of them were very knowledgable about their menus and were quick about their opinions. There is an in house sommelier who made a great recommendation on a red that paired great with the seafood and beef we chose for dinner.  

For appetizers we ordered the tuna tartare and fois gras.  I cannot say enough about the fois gras, melts in the mouth, and completely satisfies. The tuna tartare for me, at any five star restaurant, is a great go too when undecided.  

For dinner, I ordered the lobster pot pie and my buddy ordered the American Kobe ribeye.  The lobster pot pie is a house favorite and is quite amazing in presentation and taste.  The portion is quite large and if I was staying at the Bellagio and could take left overs to my room I would have had this for breakfast.  My buddy felt the same way about the ribeye.

We did not order dessert. 

The Bellagio is a terrific hotel that offers a lot to see. The restaurant sits beside the garden and its great to hand out in before and after dinner.  Andre Agassi is part owner of the hotel and from what I understand dines there regularly.  I unfortunately did not see him.

The overall tone of the dining room is informal: lots of light wood; cream and tan carpet, upholstery and table cloths; medium lighting; bustling.  Another adjective that comes to mind is noisy - not just high energy, but noisy.  I prefer the bar area, which is quieter and more relaxed.

Service is good at the bar, but was somewhat lacking in the dining room.  The server was friendly but not especially good, with awkward waits at times.  I noticed similar problems at the table next to mine.

**Meal #1: Excellent foie gras, lobster pot pie, and ice cream for dessert.



**Meal #2: I tried the seasonal tasting menu (pricey at a bit over $100) and the accompanying wine pairings (pricier still at $80 or $85).  Picasso is better, and no more expensive, but I still enjoyed myself.  The meal included hamachi tartare; lobster salad; (third course that I can't remember); kobe beef, foie gras and lobster mashed potatoes; trio of desserts, including an improbable but excellent sasparilla float.  Excellent meal.



**Meal #3: The meal started off with an amuse bouche of sweet pea soup: thin, slightly sweet, with a slight graininess.  A good start.  On the other hand, the roll that accompanied the meal had good flavor, but was doughy inside.

I started with one of the signature trios: foie gras, served both hot and cold, with three different accompaniments (lychee, poached pear, and pineapple).  The roasted foie gras was buttery smooth, but could have been a little crisper on the outside.  Still, it was very good.  The chilled torchon was as soft as warm butter, and full of flavor.  Overall, very good.

My entree was Phyllo-Dusted Dover Sole with Dungeness Cod Brandade.  It takes a simple dish like fried fish and mashed potatoes, and shows just how good it can be.  The fish was barely coated with phyllo, fried until crisp but very juicy and tender.  Under it was a bed of nicely flavored cod brandade.  Accompanying all this was horseradish butter and two tasty sauces.  A winner!

Dessert was three flavors of panna cotta: mango, coconut, and passion fruit.  I was a little disappointed.  The mango version was bland; it barely had the flavor of the fruit.  The same was true for the coconut version, which paled in comparison to a perfect version I had at Okada a few months earlier.  The passion fruit panna cotta was much better, with the sweet and very tart flavor of fresh passion fruit.",qDi5XvihmkuTWLhaw3f3Fw,2,1,4,q3oDJ4OiRjG5cTGf4y38Iw

Caviar was served with gigantic, thick bellinis that weren't cooked through so the middle was raw buckwheat pancake batter. When we asked for proper replacements we were simply told - the chef said no. OK, if I'm spending 5 bills on caviar I've probably had it served properly before - be an ""artist"" with your own creations, Don't state you serve caviar in ""the traditional fashion"" and screw it up. 

Then my special appetizer arrives, white truffle risotto. The risotto was too salty to eat. At $80 I expected it to be stellar. No such luck.  

At least they're consistent- the rest of the meal sucked too. Out of 5 people there was one decent dish. The only reason I gave them two stars instead of one is because they had Jewel of Russia vodka so at least the martini was good. 

Don't waste your time or money dining at this restaurant. Go to Petrossian for caviar and try LeCirque or Prime for dinner.

We dined at Michael Mina and had the Signature Tasting menu ($115) with the wine pairing (extra $65).  There was a total of 7 of us, including Mr. Riches.  The tasting menu consisted of a 6 course meal with some highs and some lows.

The Lows:
- The Sea Bass was very dry and rubbery.  Nobody at the table who had it enjoyed it.  When the waiter asked how it was, one diner said, ""I'll be honest with you. It's not very good.""  The waiter just didn't say anything as he cleared the plate.
- The Caviar - I'm not a huge fan of smoked salmon.  This dish is probably just a personal preference issue

The Highs:
- The kobe steak was the best part of the meal.  Well flavored and cooked great.
- The Lobster Pot Pie had a lot of lobster and was delicious.

I was also quite surprised that there was not any amuse buche with the meal.  Nor, were there any small chocolates or jellies at  the end.  I think that a tasting menu should always include these nice ""surprises,"" especially at a fancy restaurant.

5837415,2013-10-25,0,-3zffZUHoY8bQjGfPSoBKQ,"One of the benefits of Restaurant Week is becoming acquainted with restaurants that were never experienced before, at very reasonable prices.  And, what a treat it was to savor new flavors at Michael Mina.  I had always been a fan of Chef Mina's cooking mastery from earlier forays to Stripsteak at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas and Stonehilll Tavern at the St. Regis Monarch Beach Hotel in Dana Point, California.  So, I highly anticipated this initial encounter with one of Bellagio's best restaurants, and thought that I would like what I found here.  Yet, even so, my expectations were exceeded.

In really opulent and elegant surroundings, my party of four began our repast with nice warm baguettes of real sour and salty Sourdough Rolls presented to us in tongs by an assistant server.  There were other such rounds once a roll disappeared from a plate.  In fact, we enjoyed tremendous attentive service throughout the night.  

Wagyu Ravioli Short Ribs were salty but delicate and tasty.  Phyllo-Crusted Sole was simply excellent, with a light, buttery battered mild exterior and a moist interior, accompanied by great Crab-Horseradish Mashed Potatoes.  A lemony Veloute Sauce was very nice just underneath the fillet of fish, although pea shoots on top really added nothing for me.

Michael's Root Beer Float, together with an edible Chocolate black & white straw, was an inventive dessert, made even more sumptuous by the addition of two gooey Chocolate Chip Cookies.

There were other special touches that I applaud.  For instance, a long spoon for Iced Tea was nice, and cloth napkins were gently placed on guests' laps.            

This dinner was one highlight among many during Restaurant Week in Las Vegas in the summer of 2013.  I will surely be back!",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,3,3,5,Efznt7_5u-ZpY0xgRnZlIg

It is rather unromantic being forced to yell at your partner because the place is so loud. They have a lot of large tables with 6 or more people. Good for groups, but this makes it so loud. 

I had foie gras which was very good and the lamb which was good too. Cooked perfectly and a good portion. My wife had the Dover sole which was tasty but very (!) rich. She could not finish it. It was cooked in a lot of butter and the sauce was very rich too. 

The service was very slow. We had to wait quite long to order and then for the food. Too much time in between appetizer and main dish. Waiters were too busy helping the big group tables. 

I would come back with maybe a work group, but not for a dinner for two.

My favorite dish was a butternut squash creation prepared in the style of creme brûlée with micro greens. 

The waiter was friendly and accommodating and the sommelier talked to us with interest about the wine and answered a lot of our questions about being a sommelier (one in our group had just watched the documentary about them).

Dungeness Crab Tortellini - amazing.  I was hesitant to order this because I thought it would be boring.  The sauce was yummy.  I couldn't help myself, I dipped bread into the sauce after we were finished with the tortellini.

Porterhouse for Two - Personally, I thought this was one of the best steaks I have ever eaten. I thought it was better than anything I've had at steakhouses such as Mastros or Cut. 

Also, the bread is very good.  

I'm not as picky about ambience as I am with food, but I liked it inside. It was just right - not too loud, not too stuffy, not too trendy, not too dark, and the staff was very friendly.

The service is fantastic, they put your napkin in your lap and check on you through out the meal.  The ice for my diet coke was huge and perfectly rectangular, it was really impressive.  The starting bread was not that great but I wanted to save room anyway.  We got the lobster tortilli which was good.  It had a lemon twist to it.  The serving size is small but packed with flavor.  We also got the squash soup with brandy gelatin cubes and chorizo sticks...AMAZING! the flavor get better the longer its in your mouth.  The serving size is actually pretty big considering.  I got the Lobster pot pie and I heard about 15 other ppl order it too.  It was amazing like everyone says, rich but good.  You could definately share it, it was about $75.00.  My man got the Salmon whcih was so freah and cleansed your mouth.  I am not a salmon person but I was impressed.  We then got the vanilla cheesecake which melts in your mouth....by far one of the best meals of my life.  We left feeling full but not disgusting.  We also LOVED the capital grill...so thats my taste for comparision.",RAEZBD9UVxy_SxHYCd9xZA,0,0,5,c-00sbKwz_cG8fcuGWd5zA

Sea bass was perfection. Cooked to perfection, seasoned perfectly - do I need to say more? The Asian in me wanted to ask for a bowl of rice and mix it with the broth. The filet mignon was good. Nothing worthy to write about. 

I'm a root beer hater but I still ended up getting it to see what the hype was all about. It was refreshing and had the perfect amount of sweet. All you root beer haters, go try it out, I guarantee you won't hate it.",jbn7XQV7CngRu0sA6cZN1Q,0,0,4,cJ3KVml3yDJ0wSfakk_DAg

Exemplary service and an energetic atmosphere - this is what I expected in Vegas dining. We began with the Ahi tartare paired with a lovely Reisling. It wa a perfect combination of buttery tuna, spicy ancho, crunchy pine nuts and refreshing mint. But the lobster pot pie was the ultimate joy. Rich, savory, perfectly balanced truffled brandy cream surrounding an entire lobster, cooked to perfection...and all paired with a delightfully crisp Chardonnay. Oh glorious creation, Perfection is thy name!! Dessert was a pleasant trip down memory lane in the form of a root beer float - unpretentious and delicious.

The prices are outrageous for the amount of food and quality. I don't mind paying top dollar , but when I do I expect good food .
The food has no flavor, thr presentation is nothing to speak of. The service is terrible.
So disappointed!
The force you to order more to scam you and get more money 
We left there starving and so unhappy.
We had an app for 26 dollars it was literally four mini ravioli that my 13 year old daughter can make and   better.
Don't waste your time or money.
We had pizza after and that was better !!
They should be ashamed of themselves charging 25 dollars for a bib salad that's a fork full

There's a lot of places that I've paid more for and were disappointed, but Michael Mina you make me want to try all your other restaurants! We opted for the tasting menu, a wise choice indeed. For $98 you get an appetizer, two small entrees, and dessert. The appetizer was tuna tartare which our server tossed for us at our table, that was a nice touch. Most notable were the mini lobster pot pie (which I know costs like $65 at Arcardia so I had to get it here) and the Waygu which was cooked perfectly. Bonus points for preparing steak properly! The mini lobster pot pie was rich and creamy and they didn't go skimpy on the lobster chucks either. The highlight of our meal was dessert, never have I seen a dessert sampler quite like that before! Quite the presentation and it came with a little of everything from gelato, to cookies, cheesecake, a soda float and more! I highly recommend dining here.
