The waitress was friendly and patient with my toddler.  She brought out a sample of a sauce when my mother worried about it being too spicy.  We were in and out and I was back at work on time. 

Now to the food.  I ordered enchiladas with avocado and artichokes.  My mother ordered cheese and onion enchiladas.  My father ordered chicken enchiladas.  All were delicious.  I especially loved my avocado and artichoke enchiladas.  They were fresh and tasty and I didn't leave with a heavy-feeling stomach.  The cheese enchiladas were also very good.  The black beans were very bland but the rice was delicious.

I would happily go back to this restaurant.",tHStf1qlliRe8iCcxjwK-Q,0,2,4,7sVqUfWcXwamss95eBAekQ

Today I was there with a group of six for a business meeting and the food was wonderful. We ordered the cevichi and guacamole to share both were great. This was my first time having either one and they will now become a staple. The guacamole is made to order and ours had a wonderful kick to it. The chips are warm from the oven and the two salsas they serve with them are wonderful, I particularly like the warm one. I shared with my co-worker so I got a barbacoa (brisket) taco and an al pastor taco. While both were good the al pastor did not have the kick I require in al pastor; the barbacoa on the other hand was spectacular and i will be ordering it again next time I go. Several of the ladies I had lunch with enjoyed the salmon which was the fish of the day and all three said they would order it again. The service was good not great my water ran dry a few times but overall our waitress Amanda was very respectful of the fact that we were in fact having a meeting and was careful not to interrupt.",oisQ6O_uV70PhWLqaNhbIg,1,1,4,Ye3pu5yVgbD3R9Q5PYJqRQ

165843,2013-01-18,4,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"We were excited to try the happy hour menu at this new place in Tivoli Village. That excitement quickly turned into dismay as we experienced the shitty service and crappy food. When we do happy hour, although we prefer sitting at a table, oftentimes we sit at the bar counter if we are concerned about slow service by the waitstaff. Typically, the bartenders do a much better job refilling your water and attending to you than the regular waitstaff. Unfortunately, this was the exception to that rule. Frankly, this was probably some of the worst service we've ever had sitting at the bar. We are very understanding if the bar/restaurant is busy, but this wasn't one of those cases. The bartender asked if we were interested in the happy hour menu and what we wanted to drink. We replied yes and we would start with ice water until we had a chance to peruse the menu. He acknowledged us but then proceeded to take care of other bar customers for the next several minutes before eventually serving us ice water. We got impatient waiting for him to give us a menu so we grabbed a menu that had been placed aside by one of the other customers sitting a few seats away.

We decided to order the Mahi Mahi fish tacos ($13), pork al pastor tacos ($11), ahi tuna tacos ($9) and steak flatbread ($11) and save room for the mango tres leches for dessert. The tacos came in orders of 3. Everything was half-price for happy hour, except for desserts. We were served a complimentary basket of tortilla chips and 2 kinds of salsa, mild and spicy. The chips were unusually thin and the salsas unremarkable. Our order came out pretty quickly, about 10-15 minutes after we ordered. The flatbread was huge. It was not bad but not great and also the best dish by far. The pork al pastor was a distant second and quite disappointing. Instead of pieces of pork sliced off a rotating spit, it consisted of ground pork marinated with Mexican spices but severely lacking in salt. The Mahi Mahi tacos were bland and very skimpy on the fish and drowning in a raw red onion ""salsa"" which completely drowned out other flavors. The ahi tuna tacos were our least favorite. They were unusually sweet and soggy due to the extremely watery and bland guacamole underneath. On our way to the restroom, we spotted their dessert display tray sitting on a random counter. We were hoping that perhaps dessert would bring some minor redemption, but the mango tres leches did not look legit so we decided to pass.

Now, let's continue talking about the service. After telling our bartender that we only wanted to drink water, he asked if we were sure we didn't want a margarita. I find this second-guessing and upselling tactic incredibly annoying. If I wanted to order an alcoholic drink, then I would've ordered one. To add insult to injury, we had to attempt to get his attention and wave him down numerous times for everything from water refills, getting the check, and even for eating utensils, believe it or not! At least a couple of times, our water glasses were completely empty and ignored even though he was standing directly in front of us after he finished entering orders into the register. Once we finally got our check the bartender actually had the gall to say ""Sorry about the poor service tonight. We just got slammed. I hope you understand."" Oh, really? Maybe, we're both blind because it certainly didn't appear busy at all. In fact, the place was mostly empty. Listen if you're going to own up to poor service, then don't try to justify it with some BS excuse. Hey Luis, understand this: you are lucky that we still tipped you 10% on the happy hour pricing instead of a big fat goose egg. We usually tip 15% on the regular non-discounted pricing, but this guy didn't even deserve what we gave him.

In summary, inauthentic Mexican food that is gross to subpar even by Americanized standards combined with abysmal service gets Cantina Laredo 1.5 stars. Since my wife rounded up to 2 stars, I'm rounding down to 1. Frankly, we were shocked by how pathetic both the food and service were. We expected that this place would rate at least 3 stars, but I guess you never know for sure until you try. Never again.",LkWNo83Lg92C5V4JEyxOZA,5,2,1,iAfQXqINeugek7OVoCyTOg

He seems to love working there and said the company transferred him from their location in Dallas, I believe. Anyway, it always makes dinner extra nice when you are served by someone who is happy to be there.  The margaritas were delicious, and so was the guacamole that Miguel prepared for us tableside.  Crab cakes had a nice kick to them and fajitas were good too.

171765,2017-05-18,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"The food doesn't seem quite as tasty as it once was.  We have shifted to other restaurants.  I'm trying to be more specific about our criticisms.

Other Yelpers need to understand that we moved to Las Vegas from Texas, and we are used to Tex-Mex with fairly robust flavors--not the more mild flavors favored by people from some other parts of the country.   We also prefer New Mexican-Mex food to Tex-Mex.  The spices used for Mexican food in Texas, New Mexico and Arizona can be fairly strong, and we like it that way.

I believe that Cantina Laredo is Texas based, but the chefs and cooks in the Las Vegas Cantina Laredo seemingly have taken a less spicy route to the cooking than we found on our earlier visits, which has left the food a little too bland for our tastes but not bad.",ybOQaWY_F1dsq1XM-u8Q3Q,0,0,3,sLJ5bVkQjY_vaiZCe3PK7w

We each ordered a Margarita, then our entrees.  The waitress came by a few times to see if every thing is alright while we were eating our dinner. Then, the waitress just came and slapped down our check without us asking for it, and also without her first asking whether we wanted dessert.   
Meanwhile, a special Tequila dinner announcement was enclosed with our check (which we did not asked for).  The food looked interesting and I asked this waitress whether we can have the dinner without Tequila.  Guess what she said? - ?.""You don't have to come!""
We were completely stunned at this point having been very nice and cordial to her through the whole time we were there.
We will give the food 3 stars, but the attitude 0 star because she was too mean for us to imagine the management philosophy behind her actions.",n2QXI3u5aFriGS49QP_FDQ,1,0,2,oTinBmHKqEbSAhF55HRC4g

272797,2016-04-23,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,I truly agree with several of the other reviews regarding service and food. I feel as though every time I go back to this restaurant in general it becomes more subpar. From the host to the server that we had it was terrible. We had to continually ask for drink refills as well as chips which we shouldn't have to do considering we had ordered the guacamole made at the table. The restaurant was not busy at all and they had plenty of servers so there is no excuse. The chicken that was on the fajitas was beyond dry. The fish on the fish tacos had no flavor. For good Mexican food in that area Pancho's is so much better which it appears people are finding out. It really is ashame because we spend a lot of time in Tivoli Village because of a kid program they have there. I definitely have seen an overall decline and it appears to be affecting business as they are now on Groupon and the restaurant never seems busy anymore. I doubt we will be coming back anytime soon unless the chain decides to employ new management to turn this particular location around.,O44zCbx_1QZE8pg-Sik_2Q,1,0,1,GaqC7N2__nmY9vMVZWOgxQ

I like that there are vegetarian options for the enchiladas that don't just include cheese, sauce and tortilla. 

When we went for lunch the food was just as great, but the service was a bit slower. Some diners got really fast service and were in and out, others (like us) had to wait a little longer at each step of the process making a working day lunch a bit too long.

We have been strong supporters for Cantina Laredo, referring all our friends to try it out. Service has always been very good. Until tonight. We arrived, sat at the Bar and asked what the Happy Hour specials were. After being told that the Merlot and Cab were $4.00 I ordered the Merlot.  We relocated to a table across from the Bar so another couple who we invited could join us..  We asked the server before ordering anything if she would split the check because we were ordering dinner and our friends were just having Apps and drinks.  We were told no problem. So far so good. We then got a different server who had a attitude and was not a people person.  Drinks took excessively a long time to get. I ordered Fortaleza Blanco tequila, Neat. The server forgot what i asked for so i repeated what i wanted and he repeated what i requested, then he was going to give me the wrong tequila that I ordered even after repeating my request for what I asked for.
The check came and we were charged $9.50 for glasses of wine instead of the $4.00 happy hour charge, When the bill came, it was bundled together instead of split and the server got a new attitude when I told him I had asked the 1st server to split the check.  Our friends were very upset and vowed to never return. Not a happy camper. Vegas has 1000's of places to dine and if customers are treated properly resturants go as fast as they come.

536064,2015-02-07,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"*****HAPPY HOUR REVIEW ONLY*****

My friend and I were happy hour hopping in Tivoli and decided to come in and try their happy hour specials (starts at 4pm). It is definitely a beautiful restaurant with pretty outdoor seating. We obviously sat in the bar at the high top tables and all of their bar plates were half off. They provided complimentary chips and salsa, which was SUPER SUPER GOOD!! The chips were so light and airy since the were crispy instead of crunchy like regular salsa chips. They gave you two different salsas and my favorite was the darker hued one (sorry I don't know the name) It Was even better with guacamole to thicken it. 

We ordered the Ahi tuna tacos for $4.50, the flat bread ""de camarones"" (shrimp, pineapple, goat cheese, and bbq chipotle sauce) for $5.50, and the crab cakes for $5.50. Everything came out 3-5 minutes later (which could also be a bad sign). My favorite was the shrimp flat bread! The twist with pineapple, goat cheese, and bbq sauce was AMAZING! Definitely a staple dish that I will always order! Unfortunately, it was the only great dish out of the three. The tuna tacos were underwhelming because the tuna had no seasoned flavor. It was very watery versus being juicy. The guacamole that came with it was not as flavorful as it should be either, so we mixed it with the salsa. I may try it again just to see if we caught it on a bad day or I will try the mahi mahi tacos next time.

The most unsatisfying, disappointing, unappetizing dish was the CRAB CAKES!! Simply the worst!!!! We couldn't even finish them and it was only three! The cake batter was mushy in the inside and hard on the outside. It had that OLD frying grease taste and the crab pretty much sucked. I will not be giving this dish a second chance. It was just too horrible and NOT WORTH $5.50 (Originally $11!!!). It wasn't even worth the price of a item on a fast food dollar menu. And only three cakes at that! Never again! At least the tuna seemed like it had potential to be saved, but the crab cakes were just hopeless and overpriced for what you get!

Service was good, but not overly amazing. She gave us to-go bags for the chips. Yes, they were THAT GOOD! 

Overall I will go back to order off their happy hour menu. The four star rating is for the flatbread, wine (the Riesling was quite good and I love their wine glasses), complimentary chips & salsa, service, and the ambiance/decor (even though half our dishes were not appealing thus minus one star). I like the ambiance both inside and outside. I will return, but I want to try more dishes before I say it's a hit! As of now it is worth stopping by for a drink and bar appetizers out of all the restaurants, including Brio. The complimentary chips and salsa will fill you up if you only enjoy one dish. They are not stingy with chips and salsa! If your frequent to Brios happy hour, try this place and get the shrimp flatbread and others. But PASS ON THE CRAB CAKES unless you feel lucky.",ka8Pk_MXUXNmPy9kPaO43w,3,1,4,cy2jkY2LgHLUwzbeCrku-A

As a girl who could eat chips & salsa for dinner every night and be happy - upscale Mexican food is a welcomed addition in Las Vegas. I just can't wait for the weather to turn nice so I can dine on their two patios - their fire pits and an indoor/outdoor bar are going to be a hit this spring.

I have grabbed lunch here a couple times and the food has been wonderful on each visit. Upon arrival they ask if you'd like to try their signature Top Shelf Guacamole. It's a fresh, delish way to start your meal.  They roll a cart to your table and then prepare made-to-order guac. You can't go wrong with that.

As for the menu as a whole, it is diverse and a lot lighter than typical Mexican fare. You won't leave feeling like you ate a huge greasy meal, but rather a nice sensible lunch. Over my visits I have tried the Mini Ahi Tacos (my favorite!), the Queso Fundido, Pollo Chipotle and their signature dish Enchiladas Vera Cruz. All the dishes delighted. I will be back for sure.

We just had to try the guacamole made at the table - the guac-chick was awsome.  They give you all kinds of options while preparing it.  It was fantastic....needed a little salt for my taste but pretty darn good.  Chips light and crispy-homemade.  Salsa just ok.

For entrees we ordered a chicken salad, steak pablano pepper and pork tacos.  All delish!  The chicken salad was full of flavor.  The steak pablano pepper (not sure if that was what it was called) was great.  The pepper stuffed with cheese, shrimp, onions and mushrooms sandwiched by a thin steak.  Wow.  Really wow.  Yum.  The tacos were good and flavorfull too.  My daughter ordered the corn dog (haha-kids) which they served honey mustard with which I thought was weird. lol  

The decor was very blah.  They sat us in the back facing a wall with nothing on it. Odd kind of ambiance.  Kadence was our waitress-she was fabulous!  Like I said everyone was fantastic-on their best behavior still learning everything and getting to know each other but seemed like a good future team. ;)

The best thing was the BROWNIE!  They said it takes SIX yes SIX hours to make!  What???  They prepare the brownie with some kind of cream sauce and ice cream on a skillet right at your table.  Unbelievable!  It sounded like alot of their desserts were specially made like that - at the table.  Very ""special"" kind of dessert.  I only planned to have a couple bites...uh yeah that didnt happen.  hahah  Bet you would say the same and change that thought.

3 stars because they are not opened yet.  We will have to try it one more time to see.  The prices seem a little high-well some on them.

We were seated but it took forever to get our order in and another 20 minutes for our food to arrive. I ordered the juevos Migas and it arrived undercooked with barely any eggs mind you there is bacon in there! Everyone working there seemed very unhappy with barely any smile on their face. How sad. There were only 3 tables but the waiter kept bringing the foods to the wrong tables. Last but no least we asked for our check and that as well took forever... I had to go inside to ask somebody to bring our check-in

1056006,2016-04-22,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"I haven't written a review on Yelp in a very long time but my experience last night at Cantina Laredo compelled me to get back on the yelp train, this time to warn others to stay far, far away from this place. I'll get the only positive thing out of the way: the restaurant décor and set up is nice. They also have a large outdoor dining area. We asked to sit outside and the hostess led us outside and handed us menus. 

We sat for a good 15 minutes, watching the server walk by us a good 8-10 times, never acknowledging our presence or bothering to bring us chips and salsa (or water). When a different server came by with chips and waters, because we'd had 15 minutes to look over the menu, we also ordered: skinny margarita and patron margarita, both with salt, Combination Fajitas and Chili Rellano. Another 30 minutes passed, no refills on our empty water glasses, no drinks. I've never thought about just walking out of a restaurant before finishing a meal, but we came really close. 

Finally, the server came out with our drinks. The BF told him, without any attitude, how long we'd been waiting without any service or more water. Server's response: the bartender is slow and he'd go check on our food. Couple minutes later, our Fajitas and Chili Rellano  were brought out. The BF pointed out our drinks had no salt as ordered. Server's response was, well, there really wasn't much of a response. It was some mumblings about the bartender. The server apologized and offered to bring us salt. We declined. The server clearly had no idea how to handle a well earned complaint about the service or the drinks. I'd suggest some proper training. Getting us new drinks, rather than offering to bring us salt, would have gone a long way. I use to work as server so I know something like that makes a big difference. But we got nothing. 

On to the food. Fajita entree: My rice and tortillas were cold. Beans were luke warm. No sizzle on the fajita platter. The chicken and beef were barely hot but totally dry. The Chili Rellano: ths dish looked really, really good. The BF said it would have been good had it been hot. Obviously, our food was ready to go in the kitchen, probably a good 20 minutes before being served to us. 

When the check came, and that's the only thing that came fast, I asked my boyfriend to refrain from leaving a tip. I have never not left a tip. Ever. But after last night, I see now why people sometimes don't. When spending $65 for dinner and drinks, we expect good food, good service, and some effort to remedy things that go awry. We will never go back to Cantina Laredo and I suggest you stay away.",g1_M-7uw6KSGx747Uz16AA,5,1,1,JDFtkh_nGRzfpZ-Zv1H6Ew
1059420,2016-08-14,1,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Well ... it's time for our periodic ""let's-go-eat-someplace-that-isn't-the-Nest"" visit.  I had a lunch at Cantina Laredo one time when the Orchid visited her favorite retail establishments in Tivoli Village, and thought rather well of it, so we decided this would be this month's stop.

As it was when I visited solo, it was bright, cheery and looked a little trendy.  It was much noisier than I remembered, but (a) it was Friday night, (b) there was Olympic coverage on half of the TVs, and (c) there was pre-season American football on the OTHER half of the TVs.  So, we just gutted up and dealt with it.

When I was here last, I ordered what I THOUGHT I remembered as a chimichanga, so I asked for it again.  (Due to a food allergy, I asked for NO avocado or guacamole products in any of my food.)  The darling Orchid, with her food sensitivities, asked for the mildest sauces possible (NO heat if possible), and asked if pinto beans could be replaced with black beans.  (When I got the check at the end of the meal, I noticed that Eric, our server, had noted on the ticket ""FOOD ALLERGY -"" and the nature of our requests.  Nicely done, sir.)  The requests for modifications were honored, and pleasantly.

The food itself ... Orchid's appetizer, something they call ""Top Choice Guacamole"" - tableside preparation.  You can ask for customization ... add this, leave that out ... she loved it.  Her entree - an enchilada plate with avocado, something-else-starting-with-the-letter-""A"" on a bed of spinach, was very much to her taste.  (When you go, it's the last item in the column of ""Enchiladas"" on the menu.)  My chimichanga was decidely not what I remembered, but it was on the lunch menu and not on the dinner menu, so either the dinner chef makes them differently or I just plain remembered wrong.  (At age 60, this is not beyond the realm of possibility.)  It wasn't bad, just not what I was expecting.

Will we be back?  Probably.  Will it be soon?  Maybe not.  There are too many other places we'd like to try.

 It wasn't completely horrible, but Burt won't be back.

The guacamole is excellent. The margaritas were very good. The problem was the entrées.  Tampico which was highly recommended,  was mediocre and lacked flavor.

But I dummy up and defer; all the while repeating a please don't suck mantra with my inside voice and  hoping three's a charm rather than three strikes you're out.

The Top Shelf Guacamole prepared table side.  After much ferreting, poking, probing into this mushy mound I though I heard a faint whisper.  Can you taste me now? What about now?  Umm, that would be a NO!  Bland and tasteless through and through.

Beef & Chicken Combination Fajitas.  A pretty plate of more banal and tasteless food (chicken that tasted as if it had been boiled first); except for the horrid overcooked and sour tasting rice, which was pathetically terminal, not worth saving and best left to science.

Torta De Pollo.  Nothing to say as there was nothing to taste.  Did Sysco not deliver spices this week?

Chimichanga De Pollo Poblano.  The best of the lot, but not by much.  More than half is sitting in my fridge and destined to be sent to the dumpster or Smithsonian.

1518481,2014-06-02,2,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Based on our experience and the other Yelp reviews I would say management needs to provide some basic training to the entire wait staff on how to handle dining customers in a restaurant. 

We arrived at Cantina Laredo at 8pm on Memorial Day evening, planning to have drinks and a leisurely dinner. The restaurant was open until 10pm that day, and was less than half-full when we arrived. 

Our server arrived at our table about two minutes after we were seated, and rather insistently asked if we were ready to place our order. There were menus at our table when we were seated, but we were still figuring out which cocktails we were going to begin our dining experience with and we hadn't even looked at the food offerings. We had been told by Cantina Laredo on the phone just a couple of hours before we arrived that they were having drink specials on Mimosas and Bloody Marys all day that day. Our waitress denied this and told us that they were not having any drink specials that day.

So my GF hurriedly ordered a Sangria and I hadn't really had time to understand the bar offerings so I just passed on the libation and ordered water. 

After about 5 minutes the waitress was back and we placed our food order. A minute or two after that her Sangria arrived.  She had only taken a couple of sips of her drink when our food arrived. So much for a leisurely and pleasant dinner out. It became clear to us that we were in a kind of ""Lunch Rush Express"" situation, like ""How fast can you get `em in and get `em out?""  

Was this an over reaction to all the negative reviews about their slow service? In any case service that is too fast can be  just as bad as service that is too slow, especially when menu prices tend toward the higher-end and the restaurant is not in the least crowded.

25 minutes after we were seated our check was placed on the table. Our planned leisurely drinks and dinner on a holiday evening were not going to happen at Cantina Laredo. We've had longer sit-down meals at a Taco Bell.

BTW I ordered the mole enchiladas which were good but the portion was very small. I don't remember what my GF ordered because the whole thing went so fast.",j_TSUybr0hoAu7r_wyehEg,2,0,2,CK0Vf881ExNFzKoSJTDXSg

Each time I've been here I've had the same experience with the chips: they are TERRIBLE. Super cheap and thin, they are super fragile, and they taste kind of like those really cheap crappy chips you buy from the bargain rack at a grocery store in bulk. The chips are just awful. Which is a shame! Because the chili con queso, while still tasting kind of cheap and crappy, tastes good. And the salsas are really good! I just have to load them onto these totally crap chips.  

Last time I was here I had some fajitas with chicken and jack cheese and bacon. I forget the name, but it was really delicious. Unfortunately, the rice and beans that come with it taste like they're just bulk-bought at a supermarket. The rice is kind of flavorless and the beans are super watery, and also don't have much flavor. The main dish, the chicken and bacon and cheese and onions and peppers, that was delicious though.

The time previous to my last visit, I ordered the tacos. Holy cilantro! I hate cilantro. HATE it. Typically if I forget to order something without it, I don't have too hard a time either pulling it off or eating a small amount of it, as long as there are other flavors to blend with. These tacos had a HUGE amount of cilantro on them. Ridiculous amount. I spend over 20 minutes picking it out of the tacos. Yes, it literally took me that long to try and get not all of it, even, just enough that I could eat the tacos and taste anything else other than the cilantro. Sure enough, this last time my wife ordered the same tacos and they came out with the same huge mountain of cilantro in each taco. It isn't even just on top, it's all mixed into every part of the taco. It's totally inedible, and my wife doesn't share my disgust for cilantro either. She's just normal, and even she found it inedible and spent a solid 5 minutes trying to get enough of it out of the tacos.

Lastly, It is not possible to have worse lighting. The directly-overhead-and-super-bright pot lights make reading the menu nearly impossible without constantly moving it around to avoid the glare spots. And it's super bright, it gives me a headache and since the lights are so focused there are weird super-bright-then-kinda-dark-then-super-bright-again spots all over the place. It's very straining on the eyes, and it's uncomfortable to sit in.",7hnwrH20r6IiJOAlNOPgcw,0,0,2,t9a7GmZfmjrRvZLhKX4tOQ

To tell you he heard the same thing before but no change made to menu or waitress serving what you ordered correcting the errors in the printed menu is unacceptable.  The ahi tuna taco appetizer was amazing. The tortilla soup was just mediocre. The menu item stating it was chicken stuffed with shrimp and spinach only to be served between two dried out cutlets with a sauce and three shrimp and spinach in between these cutlets does not constitute stuffed by any means.

Anyway, came here with my husband and two dogs just before noon on a Monday.  I walked into the restaurant to ask for a table outside, but was shocked when the restaurant was completely empty, I thought it was still closed, but it wasn't. The host showed me a table outside, but we requested to be near railing to tie up the dogs and he happily let us to choose it. No bowl of water for the dogs, but that is ok...we had one.

We ordered a few glasses of wine which averaged $9/glass from a list of 12  wines..all decent and familiar.  The pour was atleast 6 oz., which is generous these days. Then I ordered the two appetizers for my lunch because they had the fewest carbs...ceviche and tuna mini tacos. My husband got one of the enchiladas entrees.   The ceviche was decent and fresh, but probably a bit salty for most people...I liked it, especially paired with my glass of Brut.  The tuna in my tacos was unexpectedly sweet, but with a little salsa and habanero sauce (we requested)...it tasted really good.  However, limiting my sugar and starch intake, my husband finished it off. He said his enchilada was solidly good, but said I make better enchiladas at home.  I did train him well.  

So why 4 stars?  Love dog friendly places, the price to portion to quality ratio was all good, and service was quick and attentive, but that could be because there were only 6 people in the entire restaurant. 

Let's see if the next time I come here my experience is just as good.",ejBGQeL177ECBqgMXe7sdg,2,0,4,edRgZViq7e1EaVRXpLO-bA

One of the best features of this restaurant is that they allow your dog to sit out with you on the patio while you dine. 

The food is not traditional (authentic) Mexican food which doesn't bother me. But, the poor execution is an issue. We have eaten here a handful of times. I guess because I keep hoping to select something on the menu that I love. Unfortunately, that hasn't happened. The highlight of the menu is their guacamole and chips which are made table side. Their complimentary salsas are also very tasty. 

I would give Cantina Loredo another try. It's a shame that we haven't found a good Mexican restaurant in the Summerlin area. My husband likes this place a lot more than I do.

There were not a lot of people on the patio so it was really relaxed.  What we didn't know is that Thursday nights are Ladies' nights.  The bar area was hopping with patrons.  I made a mental note to try that later.

We filled up on fresh guacamole and chips and then I had the appetizer Ahi Tuna mini tacos.  The mango margarita was strong so I only had one. The Tuna tacos and the mango margarita makes me a happy girl. 

Juan was our server and he was very helpful and attentive during our meal.  My friend needed to speak with the manager about corporate events and Juan brought him right over.  The manager was very accommodating and told us what he can offer to take care of a large group.  

It's good to note they have a glassed room for groups in the front of the restaurant which allows a lot of natural light in.  They can do a special menu for a group and can accommodate comfortably about 28 in that room.

We love Tivoli and frequent many of the places here, although they are turning over quite quick these days.  I sat at the bar and had a cocktail.  Service was impeccable and  the chips and salsa were served quickly and were YUMMO!  Friends joined me at the bar and we tasted some tequilas before settling into our table in the dinning room.  That is where things went down hill.

I would say at least 10 minutes passed before anyone stopped by our table.  He then said he was slammed and would be by shortly.  He stopped by again about 5 minutes later with waters and swooped away again.  Finally came and got our order, it was pretty simple, ceviche appetizer, combo fajitas and a salad to share between the three of us as entrees.  I also ordered a drink at this time.  Well food came out all together (not as requested) my drink also didn't show up yet....  He ran off to get the drink.  We realized we didn't get our tortillas for our fajitas, and we also needed chips for our ceviche.  It was just a disaster.  Then with a table full of dirty dishes he brings the desert tray over, REALLY??  I am sitting in garbage, could you clean it up PLEASE!

1846545,2014-02-14,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Cantina Laredo is a newer, modern, well-designed bar/restaurant that is best enjoyed on a warm (or even hot) spring or summer night - its open air bars and outdoor patios are its greatest assets.  One bar-height outdoor table that seats about 8 surrounds its own bar height fire pit and this is a great find (they'll take reservations for it) when you want something special with a group in the evening. 

This is not typical mexican food - they call it ""modern mexican"" and that it is.  Fusion Mexican might be another way to say it.  Don't come for slathered enchilada or giant Burritos.  This food is more delicate.  I'd say this is better as an ""eat in the bar"" spot than a restaurant (where ambiance is best), unless you get one of their outdoor tables (there are lots).  The bar area can be very charming when all the doors/bar areas are open and the warm breezes are blowing.  Staff is always great and friendly.  Food is ok, not much to write home about with the exception of the Ahi Tuna Tacos that are one of their most popular items.  I am addicted. They do also serve ""Skinny Margaritas"" which is a plus for those of us who don't want all the sugar found in a typical margarita mix and table side guacamole is a good choice. Great happy hour, btw - most appetizers at half price as well as all margaritas, and they have an all day HH on Saturdays until 5pm...And those great Ahi Tuna Tacos are on that HH menu.  Great early Saturday evening spot - to slip in there just as HH is ending, and grab a seat at the bar before the crowds arrive.

Placing an order for pickup was quick and painless- the 15 minute estimate was right on time, and as I waited the bartender made light conversation and offered drinks. They have a ginger-citrus concoction on special that I want to come back for.

The spinach enchilada is tasty- get over the fact that you're paying $10 for a single vegetarian enchilada, because this one is large and tastes really good.

1939064,2014-03-12,5,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Cantina Laredo is a great TEX MEX style restaurant- that is important. Many of the negative reviews look like they were expecting southern California style Mexican food (Baha) with grilled fish tacos and 4 lbs of avocado on everything- THIS IS NOT THAT KIND OF PLACE. I originally went to a Cantina Laredo in Dallas a few years ago and this is pretty much exactly the same (although a little fancier inside).

That being said it is a pretty legit restaurant- if you have tried to eat Mexican in Las Vegas you probably have seen its a desert wasteland of options. Cantina Laredo is a little pricier than most (about 20$ minimum per person) but is pretty good food and service wise.

There is both a self park lot and valet -the valet stand is right across the round about from Cantina Laredo. The lot is not very far away but after you get Mex-ecuted at a big meal the walk begins to look more like a death march- I highly recommend valet.


The Food- Like I said , its Tex-Mex so order accordingly (fajitas for instance) . Start the meal off with some cheese dip or Guac- both are very good - and its one of the few places I have found in Vegas where you can actually get queso DIP instead of queso fundido- an item that should only be served to particularly hard to crack Guantanamo detainees. The regular salsa they bring you with the chips is OK but nothing special. 

Fajitas- this is a pretty big amount of food for one person- if you tend to eat a lot of chips or order an appetizer you can easily get by splitting this for two people. The steak comes in larger than usual fajita pieces which I like as it generally means the meat is less dried out/overcooked in the middle. The chicken- who knows cause I would never order chicken fajitas this is America.

Drinks- most of the mixed drinks come a little too sweet for my tastes so I get some lime pieces and make sure and add some more lime juice. Other than that the margaritas on a scale of 1-Mesa Grill are about a 7.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,5,4,5,98Bwhtla_SGob7i2uPtWYQ

If you're already in Tivoli Village maybe give it a go, but if you're in the car deciding-just go somewhere else. 

This time around we ordered the tacos barbacoa ($11) and the beef enchiladas ($10) off of the lunch menu. Both were served with rice. The tacos were served with black beans and the enchiladas with pinto (we weren't offered a choice when ordering-so I want to point that out). 

The tacos were two street tacos. The flavor was okay, but not spectacular. For the price I expected more. More flavor. Bigger tacos. A third taco. More something. The rice was undercooked. Im not a huge fan of black beans, so I wish the waiter would've asked or the menu indicated what type of beans each item is served with. In the end, I felt a bit rooked on lunch. Oh well. 

I tried some of my husband's beef enchiladas (2) as well, served with pintos and rice. The beef was ground beef with a mixture of potato. I would expect a restaurant of this type to be above serving ground beef - something we can all easily make at home. Additionally, they were served with a con carne type of sauce, not enchilada sauce. The flavor was good. But again, the food underplayed for the price. 

We also ordered the house margarita and the strawberry margarita ($11 each). Both were very good and the saving grace for lunch. They offer these at a discount for happy hour, which might be worthwhile if in the neighborhood.

The chef Damon came out to our table, ran down the different items on the menu for the group, citing what was vegetarian and how they prepared them all, then proceeded to make something entirely new and specific to the tastes of our vegans.

The shrimp appetizer was a bit weird. Otherwise they make fresh guacamole at your table just the way you like it. I would get that alone as a starter next time. 

The food is made to be gourmet mexican...and they deliver. The stew was amazing as was the crab enchiladas.  When you walk in don't be afraid to look at other peoples dishes. Very social atmosphere.  It is pretty classy but casual at the same time. 

I will definitely be back here. I think because they do have fancy interesting takes on classical mexican dishes. .it can catch people off guard.

2206271,2012-12-05,13,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"This is a review of the Happy Hour.

The Skinny: underseasoned and underwhelmed. Although they give you big portions, in this case, it isn't a good thing (2), service - stinks worse than the food (0) value: edible food but nothing spectacular, shoddy service makes this place a (2).

We came here to try their happy hour because we were enticed by their rather extensive half priced bar menu.

Normally when it comes to happy hours, we make it a point to sit at the bar because the bartender is right there offering you service. At this joint, the bartenders couldn't give a s&*t.

He barely acknowledged us as we sat down. After spending a good amount of time fetching 2 glasses of water (he was too busy flirting with 2 skanky looking chicks at the end of bar), he neglected to provide a menu. I had to sneak one away from our neighbour. 

By the time he returned, we barraged him with our menu selections because we didn't know when he'd come back from infinity and beyond. Then he asked us ""are you sure you don't want a margarita?"". 

Pet peeve rant. If I wanted a f&*king margarita I'd have ordered one. End of rant.

Realizing we weren't going to order booze, he pretty much ignored us. We had to ask for everything -- from more refills of water even when our empty glasses were in front of his face to f*&king cutlery. Don't even get me started on him lifting out heavy bins of dirty dishes and not washing his hands. Oh, and it took at least 10 minutes to find him to print out our check.

At one point, the bar was completely unmanned for at least 6 minutes. A bunch of servers were huddled around the drink order area, waiting for their drinks to be made. Yup, the bar area = major clusterf$&k. And lets face it... the restaurant was perhaps 25% capacity (maybe 40 customers) and that's being freaking generous.

The bartender actually had the gall to say just as he handed us our check which he finally got around to printing out. ""Sorry about the poor service tonight. We just got slammed."" By whom, I wonder, because the joint wasn't even hopping. 

In a way that was totally a dick move to try and garner sympathy. He knew that service was shoddy but didn't really acknowledge it until he realized that he was going to get a s*&tty tip. Sorry douche -- you still got a shitty tip anyway. He's lucky we left anything at all.

On to the food.We ordered the fish tacos (3 tacos, $13 regular price), the tacos al pastor ((3 tacos, $11 regular price), the steak flatbread (2 large portions, $11 regular price)  and the ahi tuna tacos (3 tacos, $9 regular price). Portion sizing in general for their bar menu is rather generous. However given the lower quality of their food, large amounts is not a boon at all.

We sampled their chips and salsa. Our server just plopped them on our table so I had no idea of what kind of salsa it was. The warm one is better than the cold one but neither one was truly worth mentioning. Their chips are on the thinner variety and needed some salt.

Ahi tuna tacos were pretty bad. The fish had a weird sweetness to it that was singularily unpleasant. Encased in a taco shell made soggy by the watery, flavourless, green slime masquerading as guacamole, I believe this was definitely the worst dish of the night.

The fish tacos had a very skimpy portion of fish in it. Or maybe because there are too many freaking slices of red raw onion to actually identify that there's some underseasoned fish hiding in there. Texturally uninteresting, it definitely needed more cabbage to add some crunch. It was just terribly bland and not very interesting dish.

Tacos al pastor are not legit. It looks like chunky, stewed upchuck instead of the roasted pork on a spit. If that wasn't bad enough, the pork was as desperately flavourless as the fish tacos. Mixing in the grilled pineapple wasn't going to save it. It was pretty mediocre.

The flatbread de bistek was the only thing that was truly palatable that night. The steak actually was seasoned and the flatbread was crisp - almost like a thicker cracker. It definitely wasn't anything astounding but at least it was okay. But as finger food, it's really messy to eat without a knife and fork. 

Overall, given the s*(tty service and the ""okay to the-verge-of-nasty"" food, I have no inclination to return. I was seriously debating about given this place a 1 star review. However the food was bad but wasn't completely inedible. For that, this joint squeeks by with a 2 starred review.",h9RUaaHa5kcQKqtJ-sgS0Q,8,4,2,jQpDLNiJiYZ6foQ0U2ri8w

I asked that my margarita be made with less of the sugar syrup and they were unable to do that since their margarita mix (both blended and on the rocks) are pre-made. 

On our second visit I ordered the tacos de fajita and the beef was extremely overdone and difficult to chew! The other two people in my group also ordered beef dishes and felt the beef was over-cooked as well. Same deal with the margarita - extremely over sweetened.

Service was top notch - they seemed very busy but the staff handled it well. Having worked customer service jobs for well over a decade, it's nice to see a staff handle high volume with so much professionalism. 

The food was great - I had chorizo con huevos and my husband had the chilaquiles. The food was more than enough - I didn't even finish my plate. My only complaint is that the dish included jalapeños and that was heartburn city for the expecting mama. That is no fault of the staff - they prepared the dish as it should've been - but it would've been nice for the menu to state that. I understand it's a chain restaurant though, and that there isn't any way for local staff to change that. My husbands eggs were cooked perfectly and he devoured the whole dish. 

Our drinks came pretty quickly - I just ordered OJ since I can't drink right now. He had a mimosa. They took a few minutes but, when it's busy, that's to be expected. My request for a non-alcoholic brunch drink were accommodated without question and delivered correctly, which I appreciate.

With the exception of the omission of jalapeños from the menu (and the subsequent heartburn), we had a wonderful experience!

Some genius thought it would be a good idea to smear beans and cheese on a pita chip and stick a generic piece of chicken from a bag that they bought at walmart and call it a lunch special.
It was luke warm barf and whoever came up with it should be fired. Our chips were also more gritty than other mexican places and the salsa was mediocre.
My experience wasn't good but my friends ceviche looked and tasted good. 
Our margaritas were not good at all.
Our waitress was very friendly but never brought us napkins or silverwear. About 5 minutes after our dishes arrived i went and grabbed the table settings off of an empty table.
Since I returned most of my meal they took it off of the bill. I feel like it's probably better here at night and maybe I ordered the wrong thing but what I ordered should never be on any menu.

It was a Sunday night and when I arrived they had 2 large tables set up for our group, although the rest of the restaurant was pretty empty.

We had some margaritas, that were alright so I mostly opted for Dos Equis Amber drafts, which was served in tall skinny glasses. We ordered a few appetizers to share: queso dip and tableside guacamole, which was pretty cool since you got to see the waitress making a fresh batch for you. Everyone got various different entrees and I wasn't able to try them all but the quesadillas and tacos were tasty, as well as the tres leches cake for dessert.

Umm yes please! $5 for the Cinco de Mayo specials... Absolutely!! I read that the specials were only available on the patio, that's cool, I love sitting on the patio. 

When I got there I put our name on the wait list for the patio and was told 20 minutes. It was only about 15 mixtures. We were a party of three were she sat us at a table barely set, and for only two people at that. 'Oh, there's there?' Umm yep, told you three and three of us walked out together. 

They had a mariachi band playing when we sat down which was awesome entertainment for the day! We waited what seemed to be forever for a server to acknowledge us. I later learned the server that walked by us several times and ignored us ended up be our server. Ugh, you couldn't have said 'Be with you in a minute'? Serving 101. 

Anyway, he did warn us the bar was running slow, no biggie, we enjoyed each other's company, until he completely lacked on his job. I was so irritated! Slow, un-personable, when he finally came to get our food order he literally just came to the table and waited for us to say something. Uh 'Hi are you ready, what can I get you, what looks good' would have all been acceptable things to say. To be fair, it wasn't entirely his fault, he seemed to be the only server on the patio!! HELLO!!! You offered patio specials for Cinco de Mayo weekend!! Staff up!!! But he could have totally made the best of it and get our asses drunk and no one would have cared his service sucked!

I got the carnitas and they were cooked perfectly. The pork was falling off the bone. The sauce on top was a little heavy and it overpowered a lot of the meal for me. The chips and guacamole before the meal were good but nothing to rave about. The service was great and we never lacked anything. Overall the meal was good.

2575786,2014-08-17,1,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Cantina Laredo was quite a surprise. We only chose to eat there, because we were close on time to see a movie across the street at The Suncoast & they took reservations. Walking in, I must have had a look on my face of a person who'd never seen a restaurant... but I was in a bit of awe, because the inside looked nothing like I pictured in my head. We both thought it was going to be small, dark & ""weird""... the place is huge, light & airy. Very comfortable. Our waitress was awesome- genuinely pleasant & the perfect level of attentive, especially once we told her we were tight on time. The chips are amazing- very very thin. I'm not certain what the salsa is comprised of- there's a flavor I'm not normally a fan of- but, gosh, I went to town. The bestie got the mushroom enchiladas & I got a chicken with mushrooms & artichokes- portions were perfect, both dishes were refreshing & booming with flavor. Rather than beans & rice, our entrees came with thinly sliced & sauteed zucchini & rice. I devoured the veggies... the simplicity in flavor balanced the robust entree items & made the meal less bulky, like some Mexican food can be. Then we were off to see a movie! Helpful hint: whether eating at Tivoli or Boca Park, consider The Suncoast for seeing movies... no one is ever there! On a Friday/release day, we got right in with maybe 9 other parties in the theater with us. Anyway, give Cantina Laredo a shot- I don't think you'll be disappointed.",hd343st7cOIUSfAd5r0U7A,2,2,5,PpYO11ClpXAxsBB2KO9ggA

First, they told us we couldn't get the fresh guac cart outside, so that was a bummer. Then, both of my parents ordered their meals without onions, and they both came completely loaded with onions. My mom sent her dish back and it came back with onions still on it. My dad wanted to order something else and asked for the menu and they never brought it out. My mom finally just ordered a different dish and it took forever to come out. By then my dad was practically filled up by their complimentary chips and salsa. I even had to wait quite a while just to get a refill on my water. My mom's third and final dish was good, but they forgot the queso it was supposed to come with. At that point we didn't even bother pointing it out. My boyfriend and I had already been done eating for 20+ minutes. Our food was good, and we ate it while it was still hot. The manager came by, but he basically just told us that the meal my dad had ordered earlier was prepped with onions prior to being cooked, so they couldn't take them out. One would think that if someone requests for their entire meal to have no onions that they would tell them that it already has onions in it that cannot be removed.? When my mom finally finished her meal, it took another 15 minutes for them to come back outside to check on us again and clear the table. After all of this, we still ended up having to pay $79. It even took forever for them to pickup the check so we could pay and leave. Hopefully next time we come in the food come out right the first time and the service will pick up some speed.",-05XqtNjcBq19vh2CVJN8g,1,1,2,FWnQlW3Nye_NL4ciyUaGiQ

Lily is an absolute doll, Jose our server was awesome, and the rest of the staff was equally as great! 
The private dining area was reserved for us and originally set up as two separate tables, however, upon our request Lily and her team quickly reset the tables in a U shape and with the most pleasant demeanor! 
The food including the carne asada with stuffed poblano, the fajitas, table side guacamole, chile con queso, ensalada with mango and chicken, enchiladas, and tacos were all very tasty.  The margaritas are great as well.  In addition, our Birthday boys and girls were each presented with birthday brownies. 
Without hesitation, they separated our checks into 4 different parties, promptly cleared our plates, and allowed us to visit without feeling rushed (some of us came from California and others from Nebraska). 
I can't say enough about the great service, food and ambience.

To start off, for some odd reason, I love the decor of this place! Especially the big door when you enter!

Now the food.. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Tacos, chicken taco, barbacoa taco and pesacado taco, and the SLIDERS!!

Chips and salsa is complimentary. Thin corn chips with 2 different kinds of salsa. Both were delicious! 

The tacos were good.. nothing to rage and tell friends about. All served on corn tortilla unless requested otherwise. The chicken was too salty so that kind of overshadowed any salsa or toppings on it. Fish taco was good.. I'm always a fan of fish tacos. Barbacoa was great.. the red onions on top is what makes it! 

But now THE SLIDERS!!! who would ever think sliders at a Mexican restaurant would be any good.. but I tell ya! Order these then thank me later... I guarantee you will. These are charcoal grilled sliders with aioli, guacamole and BACON! These burgers are good! Not dried or overcooked. Seasoned perfectly! It is served with fries that are beyond words. The fries are topped with caramelized jalapeños and onions! This is the best HH item on their menu!

We've enjoyed drinks there a couple of times before, but I guess there's a difference between being at the bar and watching them make your drink, versus ordering drinks at the table where you get, well, what they give you.  Those simple margaritas sure didn't taste like they were made with the Herradura reposado we paid extra for.  The beef enchiladas were made with ground beef (I should have asked) and had a mushy texture (I'm guessing beans).  The beef tacos should have been called onion beef tacos, if they have to list ingredients by quantity.  Service was sub-par.  Tables hadn't been cleared, yet I watched a busboy walk around with empty hands.  The best part of the meal were the chips that came first -- they were light and crisp, and not salted.  Too bad most chips were broken up so small that we couldn't eat them with the dip.  All in all, a mistake we won't make again.",PhRj3okiYEWNLnlCihwOHA,0,0,2,Lrx0LBz-S13dDEGOrD5Ong

The one down side to this is that they do not have salt or lime on the tray to add in. Definitely need to add salt and/or lime. I had the steak and chicken fajitas. I didn't even make it to the chicken because the steak was so good. My friend ordered the chorizo tacos and really enjoyed them. 

Drinks: long list of margaritas and other cocktails, as well as wine and beer. I had the skinny margaritas. I was very happy with it. 

Vibe: a fancy Mexican place. If you didn't look at the name or menu, you wouldn't even know it was a Mexican restaurant - no tacky decor or bright colors. Great place to grab a few drinks with friends.

The restaurant is beautiful, and I'm looking forward to warm weather when the patio with bar seating is open.  There's something for everyone on the menu, and everyone enjoyed their food every time I've been.  Service has been an issue, and you get the sense that the young ladies out front are more about eye candy than knowing how to seat guests.  You can find both in this town, CL, so keep looking.  My biggest complaint with CL, like many places off the Strip, is that guests should be greeted by a server within five minutes of being seated.  If you're not able to do that, you're not really ready to seat them.  I hope CL works out it's server issues because I want them to hang around.

There's two kinds: One is more spicier than the other and has a kick of spice to it. The other...pretty mild and it taste like a bean dip (taste better than it sounds...trust me lol)

Now onto the food: I really like the portions...its smaller than most ""authentic mexican"" restaurant dishes. Some of you might not like this but I do cuz I'm weight conscious. lol I get paranoid if I feel like I'm eating a bunch of food. But lets not get sidetrack. =) My boyfriend ordered a chicken enchilada and I also order a chicken enchilada with a sweet sauce on top of it. My boyfriend and I both thought it was eh...just okay. The rice didn't taste so good. To me, it was kind of bland. I had to drench that in salsa. Prices I think came out to be around $12-16 per dish. Obviously more expensive if you were going order any type of seafood entree.

Would I come back here? Probably not. I'm not a drinker so I didn't try any drinks but maybe this place would've been better for those who like to drink and such.

All three dishes were extremely greasy. Like, grease with a side of food greasy. The enchiladas looked like something from a gas station. The chicken dish tasted fine but the vegetarian dish was not good at all. I did not try the tacos because I personally do not like chorizo, although the person who ordered them did enjoy them. The vegetarian in our group did not finish their food but both of us carnivores did. This, again, was a mistake.

We were given a set menu that unfortunately was not printed out for some reason so the poor waitress had to repeat the items over and over.

My meal of veggie tacos with sides of rice and beans was flavorful came out about 15 minutes after ordering and again, that was fine with me. Gave me time to chat and catch up.

3018379,2017-05-16,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"I came here recently with my mother, sister and brother-in-law the day before Mother's Day.  We had originally intended to eat lunch at a different restaurant inside Tivoli, but the wait was too long and we found this place instead, mostly just by following our noses to the amazing grilled chicken smell.

When we entered, the hostess station was empty, so we stood at the front for about five minutes before someone came in to greet and seat us.  The only reason that seemed a bit odd to me was because we did come here during lunch and during lunch there wasn't anybody at the front to seat peope.

When we finally got seated, the waitress took our drink orders while we looked over the menu.  In the additional five minutes it took the waitress to bring our simple drinks to our table (two waters and two iced teas) we had already decided on our meals and ordered. 

The food is AMAZING!  The service is subpar.  That's the best way that I can summarize my experience at Cantina Laredo.  The service wasn't horrible, I'll definitely come back, but it also wasn't the sort of thing you expect when you're equally paying for a nicely cooked meal and amazing customer service.  At one point, our waitress hadn't returned and we were ready to leave.  So, we flagged down another waiter and requested a takeout box and extra tortillas from him.  Our waitress DID NOT like that.  She corrected us and then ran down to find the waiter and fulfill our request herself.

To repeat, if you come to this place, you're only really coming for the fantastic food and even knowing that, I completely recommend Cantina Laredo.  Here's hoping in my future visits that the service improves.",Ner9deZ2TUFxdiRijBpOjA,2,0,3,U7L7tM9J61Llx2UFchdoAw

Otherwise, you're going to have a lot of small broken chip casualties from the heaviness of the chunky guacamole.  

I wasn't too hungry, so I had a chicken salad with cilantro lime vinaigrette, which I would certainly order again.

The atmosphere and guacamole are the highlights of the restaurant.  Cantina Laredo has comfortable seating both inside and outside.  The inside is beautifully decorated in coastal modern elegance!

We ordered an ahi appetizer, three tacos, a fajita entree and the brownie desert. The food was really good. For myself I ordered the three tacos and brownie. The tacos came with rice and beans and I wanted to save room for my desert so I only at one taco and the rice. Took a bite of a second taco but basically had two tacos + the bowl of beans left. I ordered my desert and asked the sever to bring me a box for my food. The server agreed and picked up my friends plates and took them back. Mine was still on the table to be put in a box. He brings out the desert and takes my plate away. My friend and I are under the impression he is boxing my food. Desert is over and I ask the server where are my tacos and beans. He said I told him to throw it away. This is absolutely inaccurate. He agreed to bring a box for my food hence why he only picked up my friends dirty plates and had left mine until desert came. He did not apologize. He looked at me with a blank stare and told him ""well.."" For him to proceed with a solution for the mistake he made. He went to the kitchen and had them make a Barbaco taco, a single taco. My friend and I weren't sure whether we should ask for a manager considering I had two tacos and beans to be boxed and the server replaced it with one taco that I didn't even order. I ordered the chicken... Anyways.

This was kind of a rip off to pay for a $15 3 taco meal to have server make a mistake to throw my food away that was suppose to be boxed and never even apologized. Hopefully Francisco can work on his skills as a server to pay attention more.",MBd-YGLXC3CsVioZ6vfFew,0,0,1,CiugGZ1VG58Y-SfvS_yRfQ

The salsas - especially the warm salsa was very good but the chips were a bit mealy I did not like their texture.  The poblano pepper was stuffed with about 3 shrimp and the seeds and glans of the pepper were left in which is odd.  The steak was small but adequate.

The waitress took what I might call a 'long time,' to come back with the correct drinks and to check to see if everything else was okay.

Andy and I come here all the time, Edwardo is the best bartender ever. We always call ahead to make sure hes working because he truly brings the whole experience together. 
The happy hour is amazing here. They have a full HH menu that is 50% off and it includes a few of our favorite items. 
The very first thing I have ever tried here still remains my absolute favorite. The Ahi 
Mini-crispy tacos with sushi cut ahi tuna, chipotle aioli, jicama slaw and guacamole. The ahi is so fresh and flavorful. The guac is homemade to perfection!
On to our second favorite. The Tacos de Barbacoa. Slow-roasted brisket with marinated onions, monterey jack cheese and cilantro. delish!
The crab cakes are also very good. But the apple pie... you cant beat.
The apple Pie comes in a hot skillet and smokes with Mexican Brandy Butter and topped with cinnamon ice cream. I could go into a diabetic coma and be ok with it by eating 5 of these.
And you cant forget about my favorite part of any meal... THE DRINKS! Their house-made margaritas are great. Edwardo was telling us that they do not use sweet and sour, which is great because most bars do. To make their margaritas they actually hand squeeze every juice that goes into them.

Friday night we went there for happy hour and to my complete dismay they have closed down. We were there just 2 weeks ago and there was no mention of a pending closure. 

Even though this is Las Vegas with lots and lots of places to go, this location was very very cool super nice people great food and I feel really bad for the employees that must've lost their job with basically no notice. 

I have also heard that Tivoli Village has forced businesses out at lease renewal time with huge price increases.

With the same expectations of execptional food and service toward this location as the others, I would have to say that we were let down with just a mediocre welcome, regular service (nothing more than just what their job description asks for), and a disppointing meal. It was a very slow night, and we were the only ones dining in our area We always have an open mind with trying new foods anywhere we go (certified foodie geeks), but an example of that disappointment was their Laredo cheese appetizer. What sounded like a great precursor, suggested to us by our server, turned out to be melted velveeta cheese and canned taco meat. For such a beautful restaurant in a beautiful location, it seemed so underwhelming. My husband asked for a Bloody Maria and he got a Bloody Mary instead. He drank it anyway, but didn't bother to order any more drinks after that. Luckily, the mole enchiladas saved the day when those were served, but I am certain we will not return.

All I can say is simply ""amazing"" all the way through the evening.  I started off with a drink (beer) and some chips/salsa and as the guests started to arrive the fun started to begin.  We were treated to a four course meal, consisting of a beef tamale appetizer,  Mexican chicken soup (spicy and delicious), followed by the main course of which I had the pork chop (the other option was fish) with russet Mexican potatoes, and for desert a coffee flavored flan that was out of this world.  In addition we had 4 cocktail style tequila drinks, one grapefruit based, then strawberry margarita, lime margarita and a iced coffee flavored tequila as part of the dessert... YUM!!  To also complement the evening there were three shots of different Tequilas.  I met some interesting and great people and had a very enjoyable evening that pleasantly exceeded my expectations.  My thanks for the outstanding service of the evening goes to Lisa our waitress along with the rest of the staff that served us a fantastic meal.

We ordered the ceviche which was delicious but I would have loved a bit of jalapeño kick as it was very mild.

3414938,2014-09-06,1,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"I've been several times to Cantina Laredo.  I'd give the bar 3 stars, the restaurant 2.
Last night was probably the last time I'll attempt the restaurant.

Like others, we were seated outside on the front patio when the side patio had no tables large enough.  The front patio was loud due to outdoor entertainment nearby.  This wouldn't be bad for a loud party, but we were not, so we asked to be moved inside, and were accommodated.

Service was a disappearing act.  Polite, but tense.  Although we each ordered different entrees, 4 of us received exactly the same thing - fajita tacos with beans and rice.  It having taken too long to deal with changing, we stuck with it.  Overpriced, not much food.  

The music inside is loud and disjointed, playing from what seems to be a poorly engineered sound system.  We all found it overbearing.  

SUGGESTIONS:

1.  Put large tables on the side patio where people can talk.  Leave small tables where it's noisy, except for one or two for noisy parties;

2.  Train staff on the menu.  If your menu is in Spanish, they need to be able to comprehend enough of the language to know what people are ordering;

3.  Turn down the music.  We don't want to dance.  Grownups like to talk when they dine out.  Grownups pay the bills.  In case there is confusion, it is on this side of the bread that the butter resides.

4.  Maintain a consistent bar menu.  What happened to the Tanqueray?

3517724,2013-05-19,6,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"I should know better than to go out for upscale Mexican. That's like going out for fancy Chinese food -- 99% of the time it leads to nothing but utter disappointment. Cantina Laredo was no exception. It's a great looking spot in Tivoli Village with a cozy patio, but the service and food were a letdown.

I heard guacamole is made tableside. Except maybe if you're dining on the patio? Our order was hastily dropped off by another server/food runner. It wasn't bad and was a large enough portion to feed four. Tuna tacos were ok, but surprisingly bland, minus the guac and red onions. The casarita margarita tasted watered down and wasn't nearly as strong as it should have been. My wife's salad suffered from mushy mangos and soggy greens. But at least the shrimp was good.

I was happy to hear that I could mix and match a taco platter. Unfortunately, these tacos made me crave one found at much cheaper taquerias (Tacos el Gordo anyone?). The barbacoa was my favorite with it's smokey flavor. The carnitas wasn't any better than what I can make at home and the al pastor was average. They would have been good coming from a home cook, but from an upscale restaurant... I expected more.

Our server may have been busy, but slow service is slow service. We didn't get napkins and silverware until after our appetizers showed up -- and we had to ask for them. No offers to refill our drinks until after we were done eating. Our server vanished after we got our food and didn't show up until fifteen minutes after we were done eating. There may or may not have been a good reason for the poor service, but it was bad enough to create a negative dining experience and forced me to do something I haven't done in a couple years... give less than a twenty percent tip. And, ultimately it means there's zero chance of me returning.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,9,5,2,LDnyv9hneiix5-Pj5iiRHw

As I approached our table and saw an avocado and lime waiting at the table I could have sworn they new me well and it was there just for moi! Of course they were on every table but an avocado lover like myself could at least dream of something so simple yet sweet! Chips and 2 kinds of salsas were brought to the table. One I didn't care much for but the other I couldn't get enough of. It had such a freshly made flavor and just the right amount of kick in it. The chips were really good. Included in our RW meal was a ""Casa Rita"" which it isn't for the weak and the freshly squeezed lime juice added just the right touch. For starters we had ""Chile Con Queso"" and Flautas De Pollo"". I have to say the con queso was disappointing. I didn't think it tasted terrible but it did remind me of velveeta cheese. I personally wouldn't order the con queso again. The flautas were good with a tex-mex vibe. I am used to my flautas being made with flour tortillas so it was different to try them made with corn tortillas instead. For my main meal I had the ""Tacos De Carnitas"". I loved it! The pork had such a beautiful flavor. I would for sure order the tacos again. It came with beans and rice. The rice was cooked just right and the beans were beyond flavorful. as if I weren't full enough the meal was topped off with ""Churros"" for dessert. It was chewy and sweet. The grand marnier cajeta dipping sauce paired nice with the churros! I enjoyed my meal as well did the other people in my party. 

The service was great and it was clean inside. I saw people in jogging pants and sports bras so I guess there isn't as much of a dress code as I thought. I noticed seating outside that would be great for taco grubbing and rita guzzling should mother nature be so kind to allow it.

3592605,2015-11-20,12,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"In the interest of full disclosure, I am a regular at Cantina Laredo. Don't ask me why it has taken so long to write my review, but as I have said before, sometimes you need to try a place out several times before you can give them an honest review.

My first shout out is to the staff, many I know by name and who know my name as well. There is a reason someone becomes a regular, and the staff at Cantina Laredo has done exactly what you need to do to get customers to come back again and again. 5 stars goes to the staff, and very well deserved it is.

The food is really quite good, but there is the rare occasion when the kitchen sends out something that just doesn't appeal to the eye, even if it tastes great. Sorry guys, but presentation matters. As I said, this happens only on a rare occasion, but it is the reason I cannot give a full 5 star review.

Tivoli Village can be an adventure when it comes to cuisine. Some places serve amazing food with top-notch service, some places have pretty good food at really good prices, while other places charge ridiculous prices for some really marginal food. But fear not, it's really very easy to tell these places apart - just take a look inside to see what kind of crowd they have. 

Some people slam services like Yelp, claiming that average people making reviews is completely untrustworthy, as if regular people don't have the ability to recognize quality and service. But if you walk around Tivoli village on an average day during happy hour, the crowds in each restaurant very closely match their Yelp reviews. Some restaurants are nearly dead, while others are filled to the brim. A closer look at their Yelp reviews will tell you all you need to know - the average person really does know what their talking about.

Cantina Laredo is one of those places that is filled to brim during happy hour, because they serve good food at great prices. It's still funny to me to see their patio filled up with smiling people, while its neighbor's patio is completely empty - but then I shouldn't be that surprised,  I've had their neighbors food.",pWEzY3YY0zEAJLlGSSucrQ,27,16,4,zC91rsrMaKjZBD8GPZbkBg

My mum reports the carnitas were fantastic, well cooked and savory. That said they could have been a little larger I think. For almost $15, I think that there either should have been 4 mini tacos, or the tacos should have been bigger. They were beautifully presented, although I didn't particularly taste the chipotle aioli in my taco. 

The service was neither good, nor bad. It was a little slow (considering there was almost no one there when we went) but it was a nice day to sit outside, so it didn't bother us too much. It took a bit too long to get water or refills, but the waitress was nice and friendly. I took the star off for a combo of slow service and maybe just a bit too little food for the price.

We were here about 4:15 yesterday afternoon and there were very few people there.  We were seated immediately and brought menus and drinks.  The chips and salsas were brought and our server explained that the warm salsa was spicy and the cold salsa was not spicy.  The chips and spicy salsa were good.  The chips are very thin and I found I broke several in half dipping them in the salsa.

For our dinners, I ordered the Tacos al Pastor.  Here's the description from their menu:  Spicy pork with pineapple, pico de gallo and cilantro.  My wife ordered the Tampico which is described as: Grilled chicken breast topped with sautéed artichoke hearts, mushrooms, spinach, red bell peppers with sour cream-poblano sauce and monterey jack cheese.

My tacos were just OK.  The biggest problem with them was there was only one taco.  When I get tacos like this at genuine Mexican places, they're always doubled so there's some body to help hold the filling.  With my tacos and the single shell, the pico was wet enough that it softened the taco and made it almost impossible to pick up to eat.  I did eat the first one that way but I was awash in juice.  The pork was OK, but the spice was a heavy coating on the pork.  It was spicy but other than that, there wasn't a whole lot to recommend the tacos.  I also thought of the al pastors I've gotten from street vendors on East Charleston for a fraction of the cost I paid.  Stupid me!  With my tacos came rice and black beans.  My wife liked her chicken and it was as described.  It's the kind of dish you might get at any Tex/Mex kind of restaurant.

Dessert was the star of the night.  I got the très leches cake and she got the Mexican brownie.  My cake was excellent.  Her brownie came with a bit of table side ta da!
The brownie was placed on a very hot cast iron dish safely in a recessed wooden holder.  Then the vanilla ice cream was put on top of the brownie.  LAst, the sauce was poured over the ice cream and when the sauce hit the hot dish, it bubbled and made a kind of extra buttery syrup that added to the flavor of the brownie and ice cream.  

Now to service:  Up until the time we got our meals, everything was going along fine.  Then our server disappeared.  She came back once and asked about the food and then was gone again.  10 minutes after we finished our dishes, she was nowhere to be found.  The host looked at us several times and it seemed as though he was going to get her at one point but that was not the case.  Finally she showed and we asked about a box and asked about dessert.  She said she'd get the dessert tray and be back.

Again she was just gone.  About 5 minutes later, another server stopped and asked if we wanted a box.  We told him we'd already asked for one and then he brought his tray down to show us the desserts. We made our choice with him.  A few minutes later, our server and this second person arrived with the desserts.  She stood by as he did the table ta da for the brownie.  Then she left again.  About 6 minutes later, she came back with the check and just put it down.  

When I finished dessert and we had some time to relax and talk, I got my credit card out and put it in the holder and within 10 seconds, she was there to pick it up.  Wow, Speedy Gonzales then but not at the needed times.  

I really like Tivoli Village and there are some other restaurants there that I have yet to try.  But, Cantina Laredo won't be one of them.  We have so many small places along East Charleston that there's no reason to ever go here again.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,9,1,2,r49m7ELdwewu7nH9OuW1Bg
4012219,2013-06-04,5,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Cantina Laredo is located inside the Tivoli Village, a beautiful open space with cobblestone streets and architecture made to look like you're walking in a small town in Italy, complete with a giant fountain.  Nice little shops, restaurants', a cafe, a cigar bar and it's newest tenant...the ""Authentic"" Mexican Food restaurant Cantina Laredo.

The ""cantina"" also boasts a nice a outdoor eating area with pre-lit trees glistening in various colors to put you in the mood for a fiesta.  

The decor inside is sleek modern and upscale, such a contradiction when juxtaposed with our enchilada dish which aesthetically was a mess...we all know that we eat with our eyes first and if you saw the sad entree on my plate you would have thought your  angry mother-in-law served it up.

Here's a run-down on my Enchilada Plate:
No garnish! No slices of avocado, no sour cream, no lettuce, no tomatoes, no nothin'!
Bland!  I've had better TV dinners! 
Cheap Cheddar Cheese barely sprinkled on top! What no Cotija? Ugh!
An ugly brown sauce that looked gross 
My entree was served on a tiny plate...fit more for a slice of cake
The entree looked like they just slapped everything together.    
This Chef should be embarassed sending out that enchilada plate that looked like this!

I did order the flautas and those were good. I actually enjoyed the creamy sauce and the pico garnish. Eye pleasing too.

We sat at the bar and had our dinner.  

The service at the bar gets five stars.  The Baretnders/Waiters were super friendly and attentive and the margaritas were very good.  

I would absolutely still come back because I know an enchilada plate can be fixed but outstanding service is hard to come by.

Sorry Chef, but you need to fix this Enchilada hot mess!  Every picture on Yelp should look like a mouth-watering masterpiece to lure people in...Then it better taste like one!",uEvusDwoSymbJJ0auR3muQ,13,6,4,1j_Ca7zQzb6CqccaqIt5kQ
4012930,2014-04-15,1,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Jessica is an outstanding server but we had a hiccup when we ate here for happy hour.  The hostess, Julia, sat us in the back because the bar area was full and told us it would be okay to order happy hour.  It's common practice there but she never told Jessica about us and happy hour so our check leaped to $90 off a few items and drinks.

We ordered everything from the menu side that offers happy hour and drinks which should have been an indicator that we were there for happy hour.  The manager ended up giving us happy hour prices for the 3 taco dishes we ordered but not the casita rita's but made it $5 rather than the $3 HH price. 

The only item we did order that wasn't happy hour was the table side guacamole because it's sooo good but if they ever sit you outside the bar area for happy hour triple check with the hostess to make sure they told the server, check with your server to make sure she knows and the manager because they have the swipe card to access happy hour prices.

I'll still come back because the street style tacos are good, drinks are made well, and happy hour is hard to be beat here.",k4M43lXJuQMpQW65DTqzIQ,6,1,2,GcEu7AUU7_7q_6UaLXn0hg

I was pleasantly surprised with the experience! 

Chips are ultra light, fresh and crispy and salsas are flavorful. 

I had the enchilada Veracruz and it was delicious. The green sauce was tangy and the plate was vibrant with colorful fresh vegetables. The enchilada was filled with fresh spinach and topped with red cabbage and carrots. Perfectly crunchy sautéed  zucchini and red peppers were served alongside. The rice has a unique flavor which is not my personal preference but different! Hubby was also very pleased with his carne and enchilada. His steak had a delicious grilled flavor. The prices and portions are just right. 

The kids meal was excellent. Around $5.75 for 6 half taquitos with pepper cheese dip, rice and beans and a drink. Disappointed they did not have milk for my guy though. 

We had the mango tres leches to finish. It was very good but could have been a little more soaked in leches. Service was good but a bit slow for the number of patrons in the place. 

I would definitely go back for another lovely lunch; the outdoor space looks like an excellent spot for a margarita when the weather is not so HOT!",DPtOaWemjBPvFiZJBi0m8A,3,2,4,Oh1Eec5Yim66sFQcjh45bA

After the first time I had it I was already craving more the next day! Also my server recommended the carnitas which were amazing! The meat was so tender and juicy and basically fell off the bone, and the chipotle wine sauce on top didn't steal from the meat but added just the perfect mouth watering touch!

I like patio seating, I live in Vegas afterall and we have one week of Spring and one week of Fall, so I truly take advantage!!  The patio here is nice - it's comfortable, it's great for people watching.  The big patio to the side was booked for a private party, so we weren't able to sit there when I was there last.  The atmosphere is very comfortable, little noisy, but nothing unusual.    

I love Mexican food, I love chips n salsa and this is where my first disappointment lies. The salsa is fine (noteworthy would be a stretch, but it does taste fresh), but the chips are these thin tasteless corn things with no zing, there's nothing to love about them, at all!  Try the chips and salsa from Leticia's and you'll know what I mean by great chips! 

The guac made fresh and tableside is pretty great - it tastes awesome and is all that great guac is supposed to be!  I've had the chicken salad, carnitas tacos, shrimp tacos, and mahi tacos (LOVE tacos too!) and fajitas here.  All very average. They do let you mix your tacos - three per plate and you can try a variety if that's your thing.  The carnitas tacos were the best of the three, but not a WOW kind of taco. They are smaller, street taco size, just like we had back in Ensenada, but not as memorable.  My husband had the enchiladas and said they were ""yea, they were good"", but again, nothing great. 

They do have a happy hour here - its in the bar area only and does include food although I wouldn't say it's any kind of a smokin' deal that would bring me in.  The drinks . . . . maybe, but not the food.  

I didn't have one, but the woman next to me raved about their Casa Rita margarita which is their house margarita.  I'm not a margarita gal, but if you are, try it out!!",evS0cCehNU_EiDiD3286Jw,1,1,3,wD44ZUfNIjVVwcOpO8BV6A

Now, in my opinion I not only want my drinks to be refilled when low and my food to be brought out fairly quickly, but to be personable and happy and make it seem like you like your job. He wasn't very personable, friendly, or very much conversation. However, he did pay attention to us saying it was our grandmas birthday so he brought out a dessert.

4287887,2013-06-03,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Looking for some yummy Mexican-ish type food? Look here!

Cantina Laredo is a newer restaurant located in Tivoli Village, right next to the colorful trees. Its a very nice and open location, and the seating is not tight and uncomfortable. Upon entering you will see a bar area to the left, an outdoor area to the far left, and to the right more seating inside with the cool AC running. There is also more seating available on the patio, but we opted for the cool indoor seating. 

Then menu is simple, the front is the Entrees and food, the back has all the drinks they offer. This visit we all got a mojito, the waiter suggested adding peach to make it more delicious, and boy he was spot on with that! We chose the ""Cantina roll"" and the table side guacamole as our apps, they also provide you with chips and 2 different types of salsas. I liked both, one was a little spicier than the other so it was nice to have variety. Soon our lady came to us with her cart to make the table side guac, what I liked most is that you have a choice of peppers, the hot Serrano, spicy jalapeno, or the roasted jalapeno. I really wanted Serrano, but we went with the jalapeno. You can also choose what other ingredients you would like added, the standard tomatoes, red onions, cilantro, and of course lime and other spices. She pitted 2 large avocados and went to work making the guac. She was very good at making it, although I would've like it a little creamier, she had big chunks of avocado in there, luckily they were ripe and soft so it was ok. My friend liked it so much so he ordered a 2nd order when dinner arrived. 

For our entrees we all ordered enchiladas, my ""mother"" opted for the enchiladas de espinaca aka spinach enchiladas. They consisted of Sautéed spinach, Monterey jack cheese and mushrooms topped with sour cream poblano sauce. Her husband went with the Enchiladas Veracruz which were made of chicken, spinach and monterey jack topped with tomatillo sauce, marinated vegetables, and queso fresco. I went for the Enchiladas de Camarones aka shrimp enchiladas, these were made with Shrimp, Monterey jack cheese and roasted peppers on vegetables topped with sour cream poblano sauce. All entrees include 2 enchis and rice, some cilantro some Spanish, and black beans. My enchiladas were super amazing, and coming from a Mexican girl that should mean something! My friends also agreed! Their entrees were gone is less than 10 minutes! As well as their yummy mojitos! If you've ever dined with me, I am definitely the slowest eater ever, BEWARE!

The nice server came back to our table and asked if we were ready for dessert, of course Santiago said yes so he brought out an actual plated selection of what was available. We chose the mango tres leches and the Mexican brownie. The Brownie consisted of a large brownie with pecans and walnuts served on a sizzling skillet with Mexican Brandy Butter and vanilla or cinnamon ice cream. The mango tres leches were a creamy vanilla cake with fresh mango as well as mango cream sauce. THEY WERE AMAZING! My favorite was the mango tres leches, mainly bc it was sooooo light and tasted amazing with the mangos! By the end of all of this, we were totally full!

The service at Cantina Laredo is impeccable and the quality and quantity of food is just right for the price, its more gourmet and you can tell they put love and time into every dish they make.

We had quite a large party of people showing up at intermittent times. Our party in total was about 15-20 people. 

They kinda corralled us into an outside fire-pit area. As more people showed up, we struggled with finding seating, so everyone was just kind of standing around. Quite a few of our co-workers showed up with their children. I was a little surprised that they did not even try to accommodate the mothers of our group. 

Our server was absolutely terrible. As more people showed up, he didn't even bother asking for their orders and we have to wave him down multiple times. He simply did not take the initiative to take any orders at all. He barely spoke as well. He was very unfriendly (he had a sour look on his face the entire time) and seemed inconvenienced and annoyed by us. It took forever to even get a couple drinks, and when we did get them, the beer wasn't even cold. 

I'm not even going to comment on the food, because I was so annoyed with the service that's the only thing I can remember.

Went on a weekday evening, noticed the patio area to the left...asked the hostess to sit there and she directed us to the other patio on the right. Still nice, but was loud...music and singing from the bar or restaurant next door.

Ordered the ceviche and the blood orange sangria to start. Both great, although if you don't care for olives ask to have them removed. The blood orange sangria was great!

For dinner we ordered the chicken and barbacoa tacos. Both had good flavor, not great, but was definitely expensive. 3 ""street"" tacos, small bed of rice and small bed of beans...for $17 it didn't seem reasonable.

I don't recall our servers name although he was good, he did have to yell...since it was loud, not his fault but definitely something the hostess and management should consider before seating patrons on that patio. My only gripe with the server is he disappeared...and from what it looked like to the other patio...maybe they had him serving there as well?

Driving from Silverado Ranch to Tivoli to go there again just doesn't seem worth it. Maybe if we lived in the area...but won't be going back anytime soon.",J3OIm59Uhfmd0pVVNDd2IA,2,0,3,B9qii3_SCK0D93ePovS_WA

4484757,2016-07-12,2,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"I've checked in to Cantina Laredo 8 times since my initial review in 2013.  My last update, for dinner about a year ago or more, which wasn't very complimentary, has mysteriously disappeared.  And it's not relegated to the ""Not Recommended"" list either, which is usually populated by newbie Yelpers who just might be friends of the owner or paid to write reviews.  I'm neither.  Go figure.  Not the first time this has happened, and probably won't be the last.

But I'm kinda glad it's not there.  Because when we decided to give it another try tonight, we were happy to find that it has returned to its former glory.  

Playing Goldilocks again, I checked inside. It was too cold.  The patio was too hot.  The cafe across the street had misters, and that would have been just right, but we weren't eating there.  So we sat on the patio, glanced longingly at those misters, and cooled off with some tall and refreshing Sangrias - White Honey for me and Blood Orange for Mr. +1. Both drinks were great, with the white seeming a bit more potent.  Figures, since I usually do the driving.  They're both amped up with liqueurs added to the mix, but neither has fresh fruit.  That's okay - more of what counts.

We went straight to the entrees, and my Pollo Escondido, a chicken breast sliced and filled with small shrimp, was covered with a rich and flavorful sauce enhanced with spinach.  ""Hidden Chicken"" is spicy, but not overbearingly.  I guess it should have been called ""Hidden Shrimp,"" but that would have ignored the star of the dish.  My husband ordered a dish new to the menu, Guiso de Pollo, a chicken stew in a dry (meaning not swimming) green sauce, filled with veggies and rice.  I tasted it, and it was excellent.  

My mouth was watering for the Mango Tres Leches dessert, remembering just how delicious it is, but my stomach cried ""No!,"" so regretfully we passed.

What made our dinner even more enjoyable was our server, Jessica, a lovely cubana.  In addition to her outstanding service, I relished being able to talk with her in Spanish and learn about her life coming to and living in the U.S.  For now she works only Friday, Saturday and Monday, so when we return it will definitely be on one of those nights.  It was a refreshing antidote to the surly server who (dis)graced our previous visits.  The other positive factor was learning that some of the changes that had left us disgruntled last time have been rolled back.  So now, if you order a bowl of their tortilla soup, you'll get a bowlful, not a tablespoon-sized portion.

I loved having Cantina Laredo close by, and now am happy to love it again.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,4,3,4,DOiGXnRivBmyGlPbNllklQ

Unfortunately I didn't see it on the menu so I tried the Mango Margarita.  I also loved this drink I could have easily ordered another one but I practiced self control! I hope one day that they will add the Jalapeno Margarita to their list.

We started off with the table side guacamole which was awesome! They always make it look so easy compared to when I try to make it at home. It was worth the extra $8.95 because it was so delicious!

I ordered a not so Mexican dish but I was craving it so I was like, ""Why not""? The Cascabel Rib eye ($24.95) is a cowboy cut bone in rib eye. It is aged for 21 days then basted with Cascabel marinade. It was so good and so tender ! This is a great price compared to some places I ate steak or rib eye at! The side potatoes that it came with was meh .... I personally think they should replace them with mashed potatoes. You can't go wrong with rib eye and mashed potatoes! 

We ordered two desserts to share for the table. We had the sizzling Mexican Apple Pie. It is sizzled in Mexican brandy butter and topped with either Cinnamon ice cream or vanilla. I chose the Cinnamon ice cream it went together beautifully! We also had the Mexican Brownie which also was sizzled in Mexican brandy butter which was topped with vanilla ice cream. That was also tasty. If you come here you should try at least one dessert !

Dinner was okay. My husband had the ribeye which came with mashed potatoes and asparagus. (He liked it) I just can't bring myself to order steak and mashed potatoes at a Mexican restaurant..... That is what I would order a couple doors down at the steak house in Tivoli Village (which is excellent, by the way)
My dinner was the enchiladas. One chicken and one cheese. The cheese had red sauce and the chicken had a cream poblano sauce. I preferred the cream poblano sauce of the two. The tortilla on the enchiladas had to much of a bite to it, like it wasn't cooked long enough. I prefer a soft tortilla. Just wasn't exactly to my liking. So many Mexican restaurants in Las Vegas make fresh homemade tortillas, I have gotten spoiled.

I ordered the huevos divorciados. Its a corn cake with 2 eggs on top with a green sauce on one side, red on the other. Both sauces were amazing, but I liked the green more. The corn cake was perfect, looks like a pancake but not sweet. My husband ordered the chicken fajita omelette, which was huge. The sauce thats on top is so good. Lots of chicken and veggies with plenty of cheese but not overloaded. 

Service was very friendly and our food came out so fast I was surprised. From other yelp reviews I've seen they offer $2 mimosas on Sundays.

The food was good as well. We have the queso blanco dip to start which had a different flavor from the typical queso dips. For an entree we split the tres fajita.

We all really wanted to like this place.  It started off great!  The chips and salsa they bring to the table are delicious and addicting.  I was excited to order the fresh guacamole but then it started going downhill.  I only had one bite of the guacamole - I thought it tasted nasty.  One of my guests had only one bite while the other guests took out the grilled jalepenos that were mixed in it and found it to be ""ok"". On to entrees....one guest ordered a chicken burrito that was ""ok""- It was swimming in this creme sauce that he tried taking off.  The waitress kept stressing that she recommended the tacos - I should've listened to her!  My other guest ordered tacos and they looked nice and fresh. I ordered off the brunch menu and got the omelet with potatoes and these cinnamon fried bananas.  The bananas were good but the omelet was dripping with oil!  And the potatoes had a REALLY WEIRD taste to them - they were uneatable!  Ewwwww.  I mentioned this to the waitress with the suggestion that the chef taste the batch being served (I didn't want anyone getting sick from them) and she just smiled and said ok.  Once we asked for our check it took 20 minutes to get it... They weren't busy.  Maybe understaffed?  I paid the check and I have no plans of returning.  I can get way better food thats edible at the Suncoast cafe across the street- and still have money left to play wheel of fortune!

Located in beautiful Tivoli Village, parking was a breeze, though I imagine peak times on the weekend might take a bit longer. Indoor and outdoor seating is a great feature, with outdoor seating on both the side and in front. 
We chose a spot inside since it was 1pm and pretty hot out.  Our server was spot on with everything including letting us know about the grilled salmon special. Nice selection of beers including Carta Blanca, Tecate, Dos XX, Corona, etc...along with margaritas, and a decent wine selection.  
We ordered the queso laredo dip as an appetizer and it didn't dissapoint.  Most of the appetizers are for 2-4 people to share. The 2 salsas they bring along with the chips are excellent as well.  The main dishes are small compared to what most folks might be used to at a Mexican restaurant.  However, the food quality is great, fresh, tasty and suprisingly filling.  I ordered the Tacos Barbacoa, and would again, although there are so many great menu options to try.  My friend had a different Tacos plate and loved his as well.  We abstained from dessert and coffee, and they don't have espresso, just regular brewed coffee available.  Hopefully, they'll invest in an espresso machine and train the staff here soon.  Total lunch bill for 2 people with a shared appetizer and a couple beers was just over $40.00.  So my opinion is price for the quality is a good deal.  It's not a bargain, huge plates or a buffet style Mexican restaurant.  If that's what you might be looking for, this really isn't the place, and you probably won't feel you are getting your $ worth.  This was a weekday at lunch so dinner prices and larger crowds may affect the price and server dynamic.

The $20 ""Camarones Escondidos"" dish, described as a chicken breast stuffed with shrimp, was an overcooked chicken breast laid on top of some pre-cooked baby shrimp.  I could forgive baby shrimp of the dish were only $10 but it's actually $20, which is frankly insulting. 

The beef enchiladas contained no cheese and are covered in ""Tex Mex"" chili con carne instead of enchilada sauce, which was a shock to our table as we have never experienced this sort of thing at any Mexican restaurant, ever.  What kind of enchilada doesn't have cheese?  We expressed disappointment about the enchiladas to our server who helped us replace it with tacos, as a manager stood over his shoulder interjecting comments, making the entire thing very uncomfortable.   The replacement beef tacos weren't much of an improvement. The meat felt mushy, as if it had been sitting in a crock pot for a full day.   

We also got fish tacos which weren't very good. The fish was clearly not fresh and the rice and beans that came on the side tasted bad and were served cold.  They did replace the rice and beans for us but it didn't help much in terms of flavor. Even hot, the food was still bad. 

Needless to say, we left extremely disappointed. Just really bad food with service that tried to fix the issue but just couldn't.  Giving this place one star for trying to correct the issue but the manager seemed to have an attitude even when trying to help.

- 4 Stars for its good valued happy hour drinks & bar dishes and atteactive modern decor
- 2 Stars for poor bartender service!

It is a great addition to the charming Tivoli Village. It's a mid-upscale, Mexican restaurant with a plush, modern decor and very inviting, comfortable ambience. Its Happy Hour offer is excellent with good bar dishes and drinks and low prices. Service at the bar is quite SUBPAR, however.

My HH EXPERIENCE: 
- My first HH experience here was good enough that I'd go back there again and soon, and bring some friends along. 

Its entrance looks upscale and inviting, with the large open patio on the side, its lit firepit radiating warmth and charm. Inside the entrance is a nice waiting area. I was surprised to see a modern, mid-upscale decor - nothing resembles a traditional Mexican establishment! 
- It was only after I saw the HH menu and well after getting my free tortilla chips, when Cantina Laredo made me feel being in a Mexican restaurant. 
- I took a seat at the bar counter, which was about half-full around 6pm, and had to wait unusually long to get my 1st beer and chips! After one of the 2 barkeeps first greeted me, then they just seemed to ignore the customers.

The bar lounge is medium sized with an attractive bar counter and  several nice bar tables. Its happy hour (4-7; 9-closing M-F: Sat 11-5pm) offers a good selection of drinks ($2-5, plus daily drink specials), half-off bar dishes ($5-7), with free, warm tortilla chips!
[- See pics of menu]

I enjoyed my draft Dos XX ($3) and a delicious Margarita (Monday Special, $5, equivalent to two normal margaritas at $3each). For food, I had its popular Crab Cakes ($5.5) which came with 3 pieces - great price. However, the first cake I tasted was disappointing, a bit loose, runny, hardly had any crab meat, and was ONLY LUKE WARM (despite the warning from the server that the plate was super HOT!). After several attempts, I finally got the attention of the bartender, who called the manager. The manager was very friendly and offered to get me another order. I asked him to just have it warmed up, which he did. After the dish was warmed up, the crab cakes did taste much better; those remaining two did contain some crab meat! The mgr explained that the batch was probably not mixed well enough for more even distribution of ingredients? The gentleman sitting next to me was going to order the crab cakes but changed his mind after seeing my order.

Actually my main disappointment was its two bartenders' SUBPAR service that evening. They were NOT attentive, even the bar was not busy. They avoided eye contact with customers. The gentleman next to me and I were sitting at a great spot near the beer tabs and cash register, but we both still had great difficulty getting their attention even for our 1st drink, not to mention our subsquent orders...!

Note to Management:
- I understand that your nice restaurant is still brand new. I do hope your management would conduct more training to improve (1) the services at the bar counter, and (2) the consistency/quality of its dishes. PLEASE!

IN SHORT: 
- For its elgant, modern decor, nice ambience, and especially its good happy hour menu and low price, I like Cantina Laredo's HH, and will go back. Hopefully, its service at the bar will get better. When it does, I'll include it in my list of favorite bars.

When there we saw a couple neat places to eat, but we decided Cantina Laredo looked like a cool place to take the family. We came in and sat on the patio outside. It was a beautiful night and Tivoli Village is a cool place to look at, so the patio is a plus to this place. Alexandria voted on us and did a fantastic job. She knew the menu very well and helped us select our entrees. They have a good kids menu with great pricing. We had their Chille Con Queso dip as an appetizer along with there chips and salsa. I had the Mahi Mahi tacos with black beans and rice. The tacos were phenomenal, I had no choice, but to clean my plate of them. The black beans were also good. The only complaint I had was the rice which was okay, but had a lime flavor that was a little overwhelming. But, overall really good. My wife had the Chicken Quesadilla for her meal and enjoyed it. We wanted to try the Mexican Apple Pie which looks amazing, but we were too full. Oh well...maybe next time!",EcYPCwJtFcQ-Ih9BG6mcUA,2,1,5,G1hbkpCdyNCS3Vj96EKJxA

For the happy hour, the margaritas were half off and so were the beers.  I just got a Pacifico but it was cheap!  Our tables decided to get a bunch of different appetizers.  Oh, I almost forgot!  If you check in on Foursquare (after checking into Yelp of course!), your table will get a free queso!

What I really love is the unlimited chips and salsa that the staff brings to your table.  I was very appreciative of that.  The chili con queso (usually $7.85) was a little runny but the flavor was awesome!  It came in a soup bowl and fed us for a long time!  Try taking the tortilla chips and dipping it into that.  It's total bomb diggity :)  Our table also got a few chicken and pork tacos, as well as chicken fajitas nachos al carbon for $10.  It was a full plate of the chicken, melted cheese peppers and goodness!  The chicken tacos or Taco De Pollo for $9.45 was Fajita chicken with avocado, pico de gallo, queso fresco and poblano drizzle.  It was packed with a lot of flavor!  Avocado is creamy and chunky and the pico de gallo offers a light taste with fresh ingredients.  The Tacos De Carnitas for $10.05 includes Slow-roasted pork with chipotle wine sauce.  I love slow roasted shredded pork.  So much flavor.  So much juice.  On point!

All in all, this place was a great time!  Since the outside area is so inviting and close to the bar, I would maybe suggest to extend the happy hour to that area.  That would make this place perfect!  No matter, I will be back!",CNaaizAUc2c4WIb1M3BBPw,3,3,4,2U01dIHKSjPk55rGbCinYQ

I don't need to write much as there are numerous reviews already. 
The food was okay. It looks much prettier in the pics. 

We ordered a decent amount of food. Worst thing I always hate about restaurants - they used pre-cooked rice. Rice is pretty cheap, people. And pre-cooked rice is disgusting. 

Biggest downer - when you go to try a new place and spend over $100 and the food is not that great. Time and money you can't get back. 

The service was excellent and the restaurant is pretty. But if you're going to try the food, it's ""merh"" at best.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,9,4,3,3DWqf2crbQmg3IHJqaEwDA

We were a small party of 3 and had asked to be seated outside. We waited for quite some time. A server had gone to a table on one side of us, looked me in the eyes, and walked right around our table to another group. That happened about 3 times and we noticed a couple had just left the small bar area that's seated right outside but faces the inside of the bar- super neat. So we moved and were taken care of by Lillian. 

She gave us the menu, which was happy hour pricing all day and also had a special margarita with 5 tequilas. We each ordered one- AMAZING. I loved that it was sour and not so sweet! I hate that. No salt on mine- no problem. I ordered the ahi tacos with my sauce on the side, an order of guac for us to share and the guys got the barbacoa. Everything was great. It's hard to beat the amount of food for the price. The guac was made right in front of us- just like at other Mexican eateries. I always appreciate a fresh, chunky bowl of guac AND when given the option of spice level.

The server and staff were friendly and seemed to enjoy their job. Although he did say he did not receive benefits. 

We ate outside since we had our dogs with us, but I did go inside and check it out. The setting was nice, and tables and booths were not on top of each other. I really like that! The  restaurant and women's' restroom was clean, however some things seemed to be poorly organized for them not being very busy.

Especially if you go on happy hour which is 4-7pm and 9pm-close 1/2 half apps and good $3 margaritas and $4 house wines and well drinks. $2 beers. Now this is probably the best mexican restaurant in Vegas besides Dos Caminos which I think is closed. They have the most flavorful tacos and outstanding chicken flautas. Last night we had 6 tacos (brisket, spicy chicken, carnitas), chicken flautas, 2 $3 margaritas, FREE GUAC, queso fundido, chips and salsa, and outstanding ceviche (fresh) for happy hour and was $35. We couldn't even finish it all such huge portions. I ordered chicken enchiladas which were the best I ever had and even the rice was good not the beans though and guess what the non happy hour menu price is $9.65. Anyone who thinks Macayo is good is white washed. The restaurant is very nice and modern and clean and our server was absolutely adorable and was extremely friendly. Honestly, give this place a try and trust me you won't regret it just ignore they clueless idiots who dont have a sense when it comes to eating out. Geez!

I was not hungry for Mexican food since I wasn't feeling well anyway. I just wanted some fries. We ordered quesadillas al cangrejo, asada y enchilada and torta de carnitas.

Chips & Salsa:
The chips were warm, thin and crispy. They were awesome. We had 2 dipping sauces: one spicy, one medium spicy. 4/5

Quesadillas al Cangrejo:
3 quesadillas stuffed with lump crab, goat cheese and topped with mango ginger salsa. This was a nightmare on a plate for me since I'm allergic to shellfish and I'm lactose intolerant. Since I was already sick, I had a small bite anyway. The quesadilla itself was nice, soft and fluffy. The goat cheese and mango add tartness to the crab. I wouldn't worry about this dish since they were pulling it off the menu that day. 2/5

Asada y Enchilada:
Grilled skirt steak with marinated onions, rice topped with tomatillo sauce. This is something I would somewhat enjoy if I wasn't sick. The steak was pretty tender and flavorful but it's not one of the best asadas I've ever had. 3/5

Torta de Carnitas:
Griddle-baked sandwich with slow-roasted pork, apricot spread and chipotle aioli. It comes with a side of fries. Yay, something I could eat! The slow-roasted pork was juicy and very mildly flavored. The apricot spread and chipotle aioli turned me off. I took 1-2 bites and ate some of the fries. 2/5

I ordered a Margarita & Mahi Tacos & my partner ordered coffee & a chicken quesadilla.  The Margarita tasted like perfume & was murky so I sent it back (as did the woman next to me).  Our server Jackie (always exceptional) said she'd have one made from scratch.  That came & it was very sweet, so I asked for a Mojito.  That was too sweet, but I didn't want to be a pain in the arss, so sipped part of it & let the matter go.  My Mahi tacos consisted of so many large pieces of red cabbage & I couldn't find any fish in the first two.  But alas!  There were pebbles of fish in the 3rd taco.  By this time I was feeling ripped off-- no decent drink & no edible food.  Jackie asked if I wanted anything else & I said just a small order of cheese dip for the chips; & asked for the Manager.  An assistant arrived at our table & said he'd take care of it, but he disappeared for too long so we asked our server who then inquired.  He told her he'd comp the food but not the drink.  Thanks a lot, Pal !  We left a nice tip for Jackie & that was it.

The lack of friendliness by the receptionist didn't help matters, & because she was close to our table I noticed she treated everyone else the same way-- not even a smile.

Manager & co-owner Mark left for a Cantina in another state recently & under his guidance, it was a different restaurant.  He'd have comped the whole thing & rolled out the carpet, espec. since we've brought so many people in to try that restaurant.  So for now, it's ADIOS!

The plan was to pick up my wife after she got out of work and I went over to Misti's CMYE at La Belle Terre in the meantime.  Unfortunately (or fortunately?) the treats they offered were really, really good and I couldn't bear to eat...just ...one.  

So I wasn't that hungry when we rolled in here.  We split an appetizer and entree.  But it looked like happy hour was truly where it was at with half price margaritas, $3 beer and half off the bar menu.  They run that from 4pm-7pm and after 9pm.  Ofcourse we're there at 7:30pm.  We made sure to order things that weren't discounted during happy hour.

Appetizer: My wife's only request is that she wanted something with cheese.  What?  At a Mexican restaurant???  Are you sure???  It didn't get much cheesier than the ""Laredo Fundido"" which was a huge bowl of cheese sauce with taco meat in it.  This would be excellent to share with a group.   I would've preferred the tableside guacamole.  A lot of tables ordered it and that looked great.

Entree: The ""Enchilada Mole"" was pretty good.  Mole isn't something I want to have most of the time but it sounded great and it delivered.  The sauce had good flavor and tasted like only mole could.

I'll definitely be back for some of the more exciting dishes when I have more of an appetite.  The outdoor area will be great when it gets warmer too.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,5,5,4,esWzU1kIGdepQs-hUPEETQ

It took quite some time for someone to greet as after we walked in. (Not a good start for any restaurant)

We decided on the Happy Hour menu (good prices), so we sat at a high top table by the bar.

If we called ahead, it may had been quicker to get water and chips delivered to our table. I think the wait when we walked in was a sign of things to come.

When our waitress finally arrived, so came off as having an attitude, although I'm sure she was attempting to be cute/funny.

After ordering a few of their appetizers, which tasted AMAZING and were delivered relatively quick, we where still hungry. 

Because of the lack of service when we first arrived, we decided to go somewhere else to grab deserts, since we didn't want to give this restaurant any more of our money.

That said, I've been there for lunch before during the week several times and had a wonderful experience! I'm guessing that my experience this time around was not typical.

There was about 75 people waiting outside for the event to start then right on time there was 1 girl checking everyone in. A huge mob of people cramming into the door way to talk to one girl. We were not seated by anyone, and were told to, ""head straight back."" But there were not tables or seats left in that direction and were fortunate enough to get one of the last tables inside, a lot of people ended up outside due to the lack of seating. The menu stated that we could go to the buffet and/or order off the menu, but I had to ask someone to take my order. The buffet was underwhelming as well consisting of fruit, eggs, potatoes, and biscuits; no bacon or meat of any kind. For a ""champagne brunch"" we thought there would be glasses of champagne or mimosas that would be passed out or brought around but we ended up having to wait in about a 30 person line to have one made in a rocks glass because they ran out of the flutes. After that, I got in the buffet line and there were no plates for about 10 minutes. The ordered food was not much better :( the take on steak and eggs had little steak on the plate and both the French toast and huevos rancheros were way too sweet to eat. All in all, pretty disappointed :(( and we were so excited for this event!",OwJ6uwZc7VMd1_1yFCXkOA,1,0,1,EmQwVntNjGaz0PAioL0ezw

An order of their table made guacamole was done along with a Pineapple infused margarita for me. 
This is where is started slipping away. Happy hour was only 5 minutes over, yet no offer to sneak in the cocktail. $11.95 for the margarita could have been 1/2 off. We did mention we were first timers here. That kind of rubs me the wrong way. The chips and salsa brought to our table were ok, but half the bowl was full of chip crumbles. Nothing to put the $9.95 guacamole on....she did eventually bring more chips about the same time as our main orders arrived.
I had tacos barbacoa...which was ok, meat was tender, a little kick in the chipotle sauce. Nothing to write home about....beans and rice on the side. $13.95 I think was the price. My friend had the carnitas that were supposed to have the bone but we were informed all out of bone in pork, so just regular pork. He said it was ok.

Would I go back here? Probably not for the food, but I would for Happy Hour and half off margaritas as it was pretty tasty.",wXZS42D0L8hoCiSh2Krc_A,3,4,3,OcXVh5CsOJlpGEE4xEPlmQ

5802234,2014-04-14,1,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"According to their sign they are ""modern Mexican""...which basically means ""same things as other Mexican restaurants except a fancier setting"". Just kidding, that's not nice - there are several options on the menu that you wouldn't see at La Fiesta but let's not get carried away, it's not a new form of cuisine.

I was happy to find Mole Enchiladas on the menu since mole is friggin awesome! I wasn't super amped about these babies though...worth trying but the mole had a little too much tang to it and not enough depth of flavor. 

The guacamole should definitely be purchased. There is a guac-girl who comes around and makes it at your table. She'll use 1 and a half avocados and ramp up the spiciness however you like it. She also has cilantro in her ingredient cart which is yummy.

Service was subpar. Our waiter was not very attentive - seemed to have too many tables to deal with.",5Eo9TdRJt9YXMy4kfdUbcQ,1,1,4,RwksaSlsyjZREWEP1Bb0qQ

Still coming to this wonderful place with almost two years under my belt of visiting. Still, I enjoy lilies guac, but it seems she has done a wonderful job training everyone on how to make it, everything with fresh jalapeños is the way I take it.
I've been there for brunch and dinner and love both menus, mimosas with breakfast and tamarin lemonade for dinner. I tend to venture with the cilantro salad, it's great when trying to be healthy. Everything is always fresh and you get exactly what you want. Service is great, we have a great experience every time, no matter if they are busy or not. Everything is beautiful inside creating the best atmosphere that we could have, calm and upbeat. I will continue to come back and always will, and if I find another city with one, I'll be in that spot so quick to eat my favorite part, those wonderful chips that come complimentary. 



:) thanks guys so much",KJ0a-KChFN-SRZSJqZ04Wg,1,0,5,wHq_bcqqMPjqkJd9CW-M_A
5845332,2017-05-21,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"We went here for lunch at work. The menu looked good and I was ready for some good food. The waiter came and I asked if there was cilantro in the item I wanted to order. He said everything had cilantro. I asked if there was anything at all with no cilantro and he said no. I told him I was allergic and he still said absolutely everything had cilantro. Finally he said I could have a cheese enchilada. It came and the cheese inside was not even melted. It had two sides of beans because the rice has......cilantro. I ordered some sour cream and miraculously it had no cilantro. The meal was lukewarm, not even up to Taco Bell standards. The beans were flavorless. I cannot imagine that I could not have had something without cilantro. And my meal came on like a kids meal sized plate. I won't be going back.",5mkRo6VhwdYQ0X2qbBFE_Q,0,0,1,w7kYTmPnGEoR4UyS2wgBwA
5859150,2017-06-27,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Not bad. The closest thing to Tex Mex I've found outside of Texas. The fajita meat was cooked well and had a decent marinade. The salsas were unique. One medium heat, warmed, and smokey chipotle. The other mild heat, chilled, and with a tomato and onion flair. Not bad. The queso was quite good. A little spicier than I care for, but solid. The refried beans were  smokey, not something I cared for. The greatest disappointment was the tortillas. Bagged, not homemade. I'd return here for a TM fix if ever stuck in Vegas for a long period again, but Tejas has far better options. God bless Texas.",4C_JFKgEo15R2eJa1s4vTw,1,0,3,UhHuE8UdrvSu4UHvKSVfBw

You see those people squeezing those wee limes all day long. I really can't stand an over sugared sour mixed yankee margarita. I've always sat at the bar, had brilliant service, grand  late night and early eve happy hours. They have daily specials too. I love their chips and salsa, warm and not overly salted like el segundo (no offense segundo, I love lettuce entertain you, but your chips and salsa are wayy  to over NaCl(ed).  If you order the guac, you don't have to get the table side you can order one from the kitchen and its a bit cheaper.

The food was mediocre, and overpriced for what you get. The drinks were also quite expensive. I came here on a busy Friday night, and it was totally PACKED, which is probably a good sign, but I was overall very underwhelmed by the entire experience. I kinda prefer Roberto's Taco Shop food-wise :/

Okay, I lied. I did like our server. He was very friendly and had a great personality. But the service overall was VERY slow and inaccurate. He also made a huge deal out of trying to split the check...and in the end we just split it for him.",cQU8IWVEJYcklBJbW9CzdQ,2,0,2,h6r3rKSC1XEPgQllkzTr3Q

The food and drinks have typically been good for a sit-down chain, but not great.  But the service and management are inexcusably bad. Two times in a row I have made reservations and arrived with my family to be told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait.  Neither time was the place that crowded, both times were Friday evenings when they should have been well-staffed, and both times the excuse was they were ""understaffed."" Also, both times we waited five minutes before anyone even acknowledged us at host desk. We sucked it up and waited (30 mins) the first time and ended up with two mismatched tables pushed together next to the kitchen. Second time we walked. 

Cantina Laredo is just not that good that they can get away with these kinds of management and service deficiencies. Hope something better takes their place when they inevitably shut down.",-uKGztxHpUcXGRWdIzDzcw,0,0,2,CUMwFjrU8Kp2UsjcV-1mFA

5972089,2014-03-22,0,hRZadfm7OEOzk0qjuk8BXg,"Cute place, like everything in Tivoli Village. Really great menu options, including vegetarian which really appealed to me. Two enchilada options I noticed were spinach/mushroom, and avocado/artichoke which is the choice I made. I think I had maybe 2 pieces of artichoke and 3 avocado slices. Instead they were filled with green chiles and jalapeños which I was not expecting. I was disappointed in that because I was really looking forward to some avocado cheesy goodness!! :( . The black beans served on the side however were really flavorful and delicious. I also ordered their signature margarita which was very good, very fresh tasting, not syrupy like some can be. Service was great, attentive, my water glass was always full, so good job there. Overall just not super impressed with the food!",jJtMKVIUzdDG4xagIOSraA,0,0,3,PXb1_YFiwz7COwLvLMxOwA
