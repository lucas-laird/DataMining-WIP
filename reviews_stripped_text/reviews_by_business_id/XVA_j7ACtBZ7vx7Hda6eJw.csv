Fine, at least your checking before putting things on our sub that you aren't sure of, but it should all be right there on our order. Get our sandwich home and it is covered in mayo. We never asked for mayo, it isn't on the receipt, I find it disgusting and can't eat my $15 sandwich now. I called and told them what happened, they said we could come back and exchange it. My husband waits for a ridiculous amount of time upon returning, AT LEAST another 15 minutes. They ran out of receipt paper, which apparently makes their register not work, so people were getting free food. Two people came back in the time it took my husband to get our second sandwich saying that their orders were also messed up.

When I moved to Vegas back in November, I saw a bunch of these Capriotti's locations around town. I also happened to see a Thrillist article about a new location in Beverly Hills (I moved here from LA).

I paid a visit to this location, and I've been back MANY times. I follow the company on Twitter (@capriottis) and even won a free sub for being a follower. Very interactive company and they WANT your business.

But I digress...

Their signature is obviously The Bobbie. Pulled Turkey, Cranberry Sauce, Stuffing and Mayo. Divine. Heavenly. Any other words that describe it? Angelic and pristine? It'll turn your tongue into Niagara Falls. 

Also the Grilled Italian, which I wont bother describing, because it's an experience all to itself. As is the Capostramie.

Aside from the great sandwiches, you have your choice of Wise chips, and TASTYKAKES! Prepare for an experience.

Due to the dinner crowd we waited 15 minutes for our sandwiches. My sandwich was dry, sparse and boring. There was barely any chicken or cheese, no flavor and grease would have been a welcome friend to the dry roll. I took about 4 bites and wrapped the rest back up.

I expressed that I would have liked to have been told they cost more before ordering them. I was laughed at by the cook, who said I should have read the board better (I hadn't glanced at it). It was too late to change my order, so I let it pass. Well, the cost did come out of the tip.

Good businesses and staff are respectful to their customers. That's what keeps them coming back. In the grand scheme of things, one dollar isn't a big deal.

They do have a few small tables to dine in, but I prefer take out.  I love their sandwiches. I like them all, but my favorite is probably the capistrami. It's hot pastrami with cheese, thousand island dressing and coleslaw piled high on a fresh, chewy white roll. I usually ask for sweet and hot peppers to be added to my sandwich for a little extra flavor, and sometimes I ask for them on the side. They are always willing to accommodate and never charge extra. I also like the Bobbie which is Thanksgiving dinner on a roll. Turkey, stuffing and cranberry sauce, mmmm good. They have many more hot and cold sandwiches to choose from, as well as salads, brownies and cookies, and a large selection of Wise chips. 

My last visit we both wanted the capistrami, so we ordered a large which is a 20"" sandwich, it's freaking huge. It's so much food and we usually have some leftover for later. Everything is made fresh to order, so expect a wait especially if they are busy. It is definitely worth it though. I have always received great service from the workers, they always greet us with a smile and are so thankful when you give them a tip, or ""beer money"" as they say.

Oh shit, you guys have no clue what I'm talking about if you've never been to Capriotti's. Their standard subs including homemade turkey and homemade roast beef are fantastic by themselves but their specialty sandwiches are what really elevates this place to epic status.

The Bobby is the standard Turkey Dinner sub including turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing. Everything seems homemade and delicious and the price for what you're eating is really hard to beat. The Cole Turkey and Slawbie(sp?) Joe both have a base of Russian dressian and a really yummy coleslaw, the only difference being that one is Turkey and one is Roast Beef. I wonder which is which? Hmmmm

Anything you order here will make your stomach happy so go nuts! Sadly, this location is run by young kids who basically get your order wrong one out of every 3 times so beware. Capriotti's as a whole gets 5 stars but I'll knock off half a star for the haphazard service.",ffknU3Jt63V2IkAmH_DpOA,4,2,4,mbaIUkY73j78Y5eCclF_LQ

Who knew it would grow to be so big and have locations all over? I did! Well, I dreamed haha. It is nice to have a Caps nearby no matter what area of town I am working so I can grab lunch.

Always clean inside and the staff are very friendly. I usually call my order in for convenience.This location can be so busy.  The ""Capastrami"" is my fav. If you love pastrami, coleslaw, and thousand island dressing then this is the sandwich for you.
I love to stop by before heading to the nearby Doc Romeo park. The paper they wrap the sandwiches in carries well. My man tries the ""Cheese Steak"" and I sampled a bite. It isn't a true cheese steak and would go elsewhere for that type of sandwich. Good thing there is a variety of options. They have vegetarian options too!

The parking lot is sometimes cramped but who cares when you know you're going to eat one of these delicious gems?!?!",Fv0e9RIV9jw5TX3ctA1WbA,4,3,5,6iwsPV187WHCWr54tb9k6A

I always get a turkey sub with absolutely everything on it, messy and dripping with all of the toppings. The sandwich is usually busting with turkey, not deli turkey, but real turkey. However, the last few times I've gotten it the amount of turkey was minimal - barely there. Very disappointing given that I appreciated the good value the sandwiches have always been. Unfortunately, with the new owners I think they have instituted a new policy about the amount of meat you get. So, it's no longer delectable or a good value. How sad.

I ordered a Small (9"") Italian Sub (Genoa Salami, Capacola, Prosciutini) w/Hot Peppers, Provolone, Mustard, Mayo, Pickles, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Onions.  Also had a bag of Jalapeno Chips and Bottled Water to go with the Sandwich.

The food came out a few minutes later and I dove right in.  As usual, it was a sloppy meal with stuff falling out of the Sandwich.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.  For some reason, even though it's a Small Sandwich, it's always very filling.

Over the years Capriotti's has declined somewhat.  It use to blow me away, now that it's been franchised I think their ingredients have lost some quality....can't support that with fact, only my opinion after eating at various Capriotti's for over 17 yrs.

Located along West Cheyenne and buffalo, in the easy to access strip mall next to Sasa Sushi and the gas station.

I never was a big sandwich person, but then I came to this place and it all changed. I remember a few years back eating my first Bobby and I was hooked.

A few sandwiches to try are The Bobby and the Chicken Cheese Steak. I always like the sweet peppers for the cheese steak.

Remember to check in here and you'll get a large fountain drink. Also your able to get the Nothing bunt cakes here as well.
