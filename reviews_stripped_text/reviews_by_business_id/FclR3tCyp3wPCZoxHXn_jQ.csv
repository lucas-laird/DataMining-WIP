My reason for four stars is that a meatball sandwich with cheese and regular drink, plus sales tax, is $10.42.  If it was $10 or under, I would happy rate five stars.",1Hhz6FGgvi9qd1q6PR0AEA,1,0,4,BcjRzi3OIHsYwd7Ct8JwNg
1070786,2011-05-06,0,FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ,"There is a sandwich which you can only find in the City of Chicago.  It's an Italian Breaded Steak Sandwich and even in Chicago they are not easy to find.

Well now a Chicago family has opened a place right here in Las Vegas where you can have one and they brought their old-school recipes with them.

A breaded steak sandwich is large piece of beef that is breaded and fried, placed open face on a large bun and covered with Italian red sauce and mozzarella cheese.  They are so good and this place is doing them justice.  When I drove past and saw this place was going to be opening, as a born and raised Chicago guy, I couldn't wait.   Finally I am able to have one of these sandwiches here!

Along with the breaded steak, they also do a very tasty Italian Beef sandwich, Chicago-style hot dogs and panzerotti or pizza puffs, all Chicago originals.  This is stick-to-your-ribs, rich-flavored food like one would find in Chicago and it's fantastic. 

Because of the fact they are making good versions of something I can only usually find in Chicago, they get 5 stars from me!",LqfTwsgco3QCpkAxArROMQ,1,0,5,8gvn_Zg4bVmz7ymCsdJ5iA

Ordered the meatball sammie w/cheese, pizzaiola w/cheese, onion rings and a soda ( free with coupon ) - total cost $20.50 

The high's - the pizzaiola was very good - thin sliced roast beef with au jus ( not sure if the roll was dipped or it's simply from the drippings within the meat - my guess is it's dipped on the face ) , some peppers and a little cheese. Very generous portion of meat, tender flavorful but might be a little too salty for some. 

The meatball sammie -three decent sized meatballs - tender, nice flavor, generous portion of tomato sauce. a little miffed they charge extra for the cheese - who gets a meatball sub w/o cheese?! 

The lows ( besides the extra charge for the cheese ) - the onion rings ...can you say...ORE-IDA . Really ? Why not make them fresh ? 

Again, good service, and a decent vibe to the place. 

Will return for a taste of the chicago dog and the sausage sammie",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,5,1,3,wf3auPaSJ3sFu5UrkwET8Q
1183448,2011-06-13,0,FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ,"Now this review is based off of the fact that papa geo's states it's chicago style food. When you hear that you do go in with certain expectations. With that said, me and a friend(who's from chicago) went to check it out. It's nice, clean, and the staff was friendly. I got the pizzaiola since he said it was their italian beef, and mozzarella sticks. It's not a bad sandwich, just not a chicago italian beef. The mozzarella sticks were the cheap frozen garbage ones your can find in your freezer isle. I couldn't believe they served this in a ITALIAN restaurant, what a joke. They say the marinara is home made but it doesn't taste like it. My friends steak sandwich was ok, but he sent back his fries and they still weren't good the second time. If you go here with low to no expectations then I guess you might be alright but, why go out to eat then in the first place.",ys0fyvMJfKyh1knTEWadbg,2,1,2,_4XTbYvTGDcVbbN_T8CzLg

1333408,2011-06-02,0,FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ,"Went there for the first time today.  Grabbed a few things to try.  Italian breaded steak sandwich, mozz sticks, and the Chicago Tamale.

Sandwich was goopy, messy, and all the words that describe great, greasy italian food.  I loved it.  Mozz sticks were average, but not as expensive as other places so I didn't mind (people normally charge WAY too much for them.)  Chicago Tamale, surprisingly awesome.  Basically a huskless tamale with beef in it, dip it in marinara.

The guy at the counter kept stressing their homemade marinara.  It is great, don't get me wrong... its just that a can of tomato sauce was sitting on the counter at the time, so I can't say it's completely homemade.  It is really good, though.

Service was great.  Everyone was nice.  One TV was a Cubs game, another was an ESPN Classic Bulls game from the 90s, and I loved that the lady behind the counter was asking about the score.  ""Alright, Go Bulls!""

I am definitely going back to try more of the menu.  And, its probably been mentioned... but where's the Chicago Pizza?",vFiwwcmzSEXNKMsTdvWVhg,4,2,5,lQysE3Xp-0pdNZ5ggnKquA

I went in and the place was empty, but the employees were soooo nice and welcoming, that I added a star just for that.  I decided to order both the steak sandwich and an italian beef sandwich to take home (couldn't make up my mind).  Service was quick, and bag was heavy!  Once home, I opened the italian beef first, and holy crap, was it a mess!  Bread was soaked and dripping so bad, I had to take my first bite over the sink.  But wow, was it delicious!  Meat was tender and the giardiniera flavorful.  Not your typical italian beef, but was very satisfying.  It was just so messy, I ended up eating with a knife and fork...but I would definately order it again.  The portion was big, so I put half away and decided to take a bite of the breaded steak to try it out....to be honest, the breaded steak was a disappointment.  It was so tough and gristle-y that I ended up giving it to my dog (who LOVED it, by the way)  Somehow I imagined it would be way different than what it was.  Nice idea, but doesn't work with whatever cut of meat was used.   I'll go back.  Just won't be ordering the steak sandwich again.",GeRgStFIS3oBxkAiCIgwMA,0,0,4,80hEuJJw_14Pg00zDBP3Jg
3006372,2012-01-21,0,FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ,"I have to confess, I've only been once. Generally, I try to go to a place at least twice before I write a review, but I still think about that Italian beef and that must mean something. I stopped by and got carry out one afternoon. The place is very open, bright and clean. The girl at the counter was really helpful as I hadn't been before so I asked for a recommendation. You can always tell if the employees like the food because when you ask what they like best, there's a hesitation. Without any hesitation she said, ""Breaded steak or chicken sandwich."" I decided to go with the Italian beef because 1) I've had good Italian beef and 2) I love Italian beef. The wait wasn't long and when I got the bag with my sandwich in it, it was like a pile of bricks. I was salivating all the way home. I'm not sure if it was meant to be dipped or it was just the delicious juices dripping from the sandwich and soaking into the roll, but yowza did it look and smell delicious when I unwrapped it. Biting in was about what I anticipated, it was tender and juicy and everything meat should be. The only complaint, and I use the word loosely because it could easily be an artistic decision, is that the giardiniera veggies were in huge pieces. I like a really small cut giardiniera so that it blends like a proper accoutrement. However, I'm not from Chicago, maybe that's how some people do it there. Other than that the sandwich was fantastic and far too big to eat in one meal. That's most of the reason I haven't been back, I know I need to go on a free day when I'm really hungry. So, if big sandwiches are your thing, this is a good place to go.",bWzl8y3rE_l9QdEOQMFvew,0,0,4,N9ofNBsHxczpuVG8YanBUQ

Now, that being said, I know what a Chicago dog, Italian Beef and Pizza Puff taste like from Chicago, if that's EXACTLY what you're looking for, go else where. The food here is above and beyond anything that you'd stick in your pie hole! Don't get me wrong, Chicago food is great but Papa Geo takes it's own spin on things. They take what is already great food and make it better. Yep.

Papa Geo's is a Mom and Pop shop. You walk in and they instantly make you feel like family. We've talked to Papa Geo many times and he says he gets all his stuff from Chicago! They're amazing. We love coming here.",77lef7kKkoOVupY-7AmieQ,1,0,5,cA8392koBS3gcLiztJaUHQ

I took my kids here for the first time Friday Night and we were not disappointed. The whole staff was super friendly and treated us like we were family. For me growing up in a full on Italian Family food is a huge thing. Every Sunday having those huge Italian dinners with the family is something that I miss. Coming here it feels just like that. The food is awesome the people are the best, what more could you ask for. My kids had the Cheese Pizzaiola and they loved it, I had the breaded steak sandwich and that was awesome as well. We loved this place so much that we went back the next night for dinner. The kids had the same thing again since they loved it so much and I opted to try the Chicken fingers and fries along with some cream puffs and fried dough. I have no complaints about anything and I will for sure be back in the very near future, I have many friends that need to try this place out!

5551826,2011-07-15,0,FclR3tCyp3wPCZoxHXn_jQ,"I'm from Chicago so naturally when I heard about this place, I had to check it out.  I went for the Breaded Steak w/ red gravy.  First off, the price of $8 for a 7-inch sandwich isn't too bad.  

As soon a I ordered, I saw them bread & drop fresh steak.  A few minutes later, I was having my first breaded steak in over 10 years (I miss you Ricobene's), and it didn't disappoint.  The steak was breaded and cooked perfectly.  The gravy was good, and there wasn't too much that is took away from the taste of the steak.  And the bread held up perfectly for this messy sandwich as well.  

As I was eating, the owner came over and we had a nice conversation.  She even let me have a small sample of her pizzaiola and homemade gardiniera, both which makes me want to go back for a full sandwhich.

A SIDE NOTE:  Pizzaiola is NOT Italian Beef.  They are cooked with different ingredients, thus the different names.  

All in all I was impressed; and by the way, there is no other place in Vegas you are going to get breaded steak, so this place is one of a kind out here.",L4wssW3_b2UAnI6uErOggA,2,1,5,KsIb53y9H-BkIKUGfmxfQA
