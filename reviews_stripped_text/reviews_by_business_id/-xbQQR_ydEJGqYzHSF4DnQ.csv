Now, the bad part: The service was TERRIBLE!  The front of the house needs work! We were not greeted when we arrived just asked: ""how many?""  The server was very slow, distracted, & overwhelmed.  We had to ask for refills of water several times throughout the meal.  When she filled the glasses of water (using a pitcher) she poured the water & spilled all over the table & floor. We had to ask about the types of beer & wine (we were never offered).  After we got our first round of waters it was a good 10 minutes before she came back to take our order.  When she did she apologized for the wait and then told us that she was the only one there.  All 5 of us have worked or still work in the service industry so we understand that ""things happen"" and you might be struggling, but there were only about 4 tables having dinner.  When I was a waitress if I got slammed I would have management there to help with back up.  After reading a few reviews of this restaurant it seems that this has been an issue for a while.  I hope Management reads some of these reviews and realize that the food is wonderful, but your wait staff needs some help/training.

675909,2012-05-29,0,-xbQQR_ydEJGqYzHSF4DnQ,"FIrst let me mention that I am a Chicago native and this means I know pizza.  This place serves the closest to Chicago style deep dish pizza I have found since leaving home.  (closer to Uno's and Connies than Giorgano's but we will take it). This could be because their other locations are all in Illinois. They also serve thin (sliced correctly, in squares), double crust, pan, and stuffed.  Upon being seated, the table receives (free) a basket of the most delightful garlic parmesan bread bites we have ever tasted.  These, plus a salad, would be enough for a normal person's dinner.  But no, get the pizza and take it home.  A medium deep dish will feed your house for the next few days, and warms up as delicious as first served.  Sadly, filling up on the bread and anticipating a pizza meal was not enough for us.  We also ordered the cheesy bacon fries.  We were overstuffed but not sorry.  These feature real bacon, two cheeses and dipping sauce.  We have never, ever, had fries this good.
The restaurant is cute and comfortable with Italian country decor, but a bit small.  A large party with children came in when we were in mid meal and we were asked to move to a booth so they could push all the tables on one side of the room together. We did not mind moving, unfortunately the large party with children in the small space subjected us to learning much more about the lives and activities of them and their children than we ever wanted or needed to know. Size feels like a real restaurant in Italy without the outdoor seating.They provide linen napkins but no tablecloths.  The staff provided regular check-ins to see if we needed anything, refilled beverages without being asked and the food was served promptly. The server was extremely patient with an elderly foursome who did not understand their check or how to use an entertainment coupon (close quarters, we heard it all clearly).
In summary, I would gladly chance the possibility of loud families in close quarters to feast on those delightful bread bites and the great pizza.",XOHOy3hJtOh_RGvNexNgmA,0,0,5,TYfNPAPfLoMgSWVaU3kvEQ

When he brought it to us 45 minutes later, it was cold ...and just gross. Another notable observation; The waiter NEVER CAME BACK TO OUR TABLE. Not to check on us. Not to refill drinks. Nothing.

Bonus points for the options to add calamari to the pasta, the tasty thin-crust pizza, and heaping basket of free, fried breadsticks.  They may kill you but they're free!

The restaurant, located in a random strip mall, is decorated to feel like an Italian eatery (i.e. faux venetian plaster, etc).  Seating is amazingly plentiful, complete with booths and tables.  You may, however, get an arm workout while waiving down your waitress.  They're a tad understaffed.

We have been eating at Maciano's since they opened,  I had my daughter's Baptism lunch catered from thern and overall had been been very satisfied, that is until tonight.  Usually the service at Maciano's is slow, but the food more than makes up for it.  Tonight, the food was really awful and the service was so slow we almost fell asleep at the table. I ordered the Chicken Florentine, which came out at room temperature with some of  the most disgusting garlic mashed potatoes I've ever seen(I'm guessing they were either leftover from the day before or made from a mix.).  The rest of my party had a pizza which took forever.  Our less than enthusiastic server said  the kitchen was running behind when we sent my order back.

I went to the ladies room and saw employees(who looked like a bunch of high school kids) texting and sitting around in the kitchen, it explained a lot. Their tiramisu used to be to die for, homemade and creamy and HUGE. Now it's tiny portions and no longer homemade. I feel like our server should have offered to take my nasty meal off our bill or comped a dessert.  Maciano's used to be so good, unfortunately that is no longer the case.

I love there pizza, entrees, coupons, etc. I have been twice this year with very subpar results. Yesterday I found out that they changed owners or management, which made me skeptical. Apparently i should have trusted my instincts. I ordered takeout and they would not honor my coupons, they informed me of new management or owners, ok whatever. When I picked up the order I made sure to ask for a plastic bag to double bag the paper one given. Good thing bc this thing leaked oil ALL OVER THE PLACE. The bag looked like it had a philly cheese steak from Geno's in it. My leather seats would have been ruined. Not to mention the girl at the counter basically rolled her eyes when I asked for the bag and double checked my order in front of her. . I asked for some minor changes to 1 dish, extra meat sauce to the lasagna and a side of sausage. There was little to no meat sauce on this lasagna AT ALL. It was 80% cheese and was just awful, i ended up throwing half of it away. My gf got the Fruiti de Mare and didnt even make it 1/2 way thru her dish before she had the RUNS! Totally unacceptable. I highly doubt I will ever order from this place again. I can think of a better way to spend $30. such a shame. Bye Macianos, we shared many great football Sunday's together but I think that was the last.

UPDATE*************

Spoke to several people there this evening. The ""Manager"" was some guy, couldnt hear his name, but could not find my order history for 15 mins, kind of a joke. However i did speak to a Marinka? Who was very nice and actually apologized and refunded my order. That was pleasant as I was only calling to give them my 2 cents.

3039690,2012-05-10,1,-xbQQR_ydEJGqYzHSF4DnQ,"To start, this is not a high class, white linen restaurant. Maciano's is a local, small, friendly restaurant that serves excellent Italian cuisine in a quiet, serene little quaint atmosphere. We have stopped here many different times, usually on our way home, to grab a bite. There's usually one waitress on duty, who also serves as the hostess. Our last drop-in was on our way back from a two-week romp around the country. Driving home after a long flight is always a dreaded experience, but seeing that your favorite little Italian place is open mitigates the angst a bit. Stopped in, had a few beers, a great meal, and then went home and slept like a hibernating bear.
The only reason we don't give a five star is that their delivery pizza could use some work. Its just a bit too greasy, a bit flat and undercooked bread wise, and the prices could be a bit more competitive. 

That being said, if you do go, please enjoy the bread bits they make and serve as an appetizer, for free, with every meal. They are hot, little pieces of parmesan heaven. Couple that with a couple Peroni's, and your meal is delightfully ruined. However, it definitely tastes great heated up the next day. ;)",4yG4J05aKzE2zov0Jr37kg,1,1,4,wY_OZAauqlMIsC9eQnBhdw
3248237,2010-10-23,0,-xbQQR_ydEJGqYzHSF4DnQ,"With Maciano's varied menu I think they run into a case of being jacks of all trades but masters of none. Our meal here, inspired by a $25 restaurant.com coupon was very uneven and despite the wonderful service we won't return, simply because the food had too many problems.

In order to buy the $50 worth of food as required by our gift certificate, we ordered a house salad to share, two pastas and a medium pizza to just get us to our requirement. 

The salad, despite being a little unimaginative, was huge and fresh. I probably should have gone with a different dressing instead of the Italian which was a bit sweet for my tastes.  The free bread sticks were, as others have mentioned, deep fried, but I didn't find them greasy - just unremarkable.

My pasta, an alfredo penne with a few add-ins, including meatballs was initially encouraging. The alfredo sauce was tasty and everything seemed cooked well. The big let-down was the meatballs. I can say without a shred of hyperbole that they had absolutely no taste. They weren't even a good texture, being slightly gritty and soft. I tried to season them up with some salt and pepper, but they seemed immune to any sort of flavour. 

The Pizza was mostly intended as a take home item, but by the end of the meal we barely wanted it. It -looked- great, but the crust was very odd and hard. Don't get me wrong, I don't like wet, sloppy ""New York Style"" pizza either, but somewhere there's a nice dense, chewy medium between slop and a rusk, surely. The pizza sauce was rather sweet and unremarkable.

Overall it was fun to try a new place and with our coupon the damage wasn't too great, but I think Maciano's could work on the taste of their menu items. I know ""good pizza"" is very subjective, so I'm willing to chalk down the pizza as ""not to my taste"", but the tasteless meatballs and other issues really hold this place back. When you consider that this would have been nearly a seventy dollar meal without gift cerfiticate, most diners would expect something great for this sort of outlay.

It's perhaps telling that my wife and I both looked with regret at a newly opened Little Caesar's we spied on the drive home, considering the mediocre pizza we could have picked up for $5 instead of the unwanted and much more expensive leftovers we had in our trunk.",U1XB9-3lh8Z3Eki6qU-v2g,3,2,2,BoyQ7-tNo8SX4wrFnun4ag

The Breadsticks/ sauce they bring to the table are the best. Love their red sauces. I've had calamari; it was good. The service is just...weird. It can be okay, it can be fast, but it's usually lax.

This last time our waiter told us not to order certain things, after trying to upsell us on the Fruti de Mar. At this point I'm not trusting in the freshness of mussels and clams, yet. Nice try, though. My friend ordered tortellini with vodka sauce. Our waiter said, ""no, you shouldn't order that."" Um...okay. Though they regarded against it, the pairing was good, she said.

There was a man playing music, which was a nice touch. Except all we could hear was ""Ya'll gonna make me lose my mind...up in here, up in here."" DMX rap booming through the kitchen walls. I mean, it was too loud,

Found out a lot of details about the business that customers really don't need to know. It was a lot of TMI, I won't go I to too many details but I do believe the wait time problem for order outs because the server said that the do deliveries while serving tables understaffed.  Kinda hard to fill waters if you are driving an order somewhere.

The Thin-Crust came pre-cut in an unusual method... a Checker-board pattern with each piece about 3-inches square... not a Pie Slice. Pepperoni slices were baked on top of the Pizza with only 1 to 2 small pieces of Pepperoni per ""slice""... as described above.

My only complaint was about the house salad. Although huge and fresh, it only encompasses four ingredients. Romaine, cucumbers, tomatoes, and red onions. We got the balsamic and ranch which were both freshly made and fantastic, but the salad could really use some more to it. Croutons and something else like that round it out would be nice. Plus the red onions were so hot and plentiful it tasted like a raw, red onion salad.

Service was great and prices were very reasonable, I will continue to go again and again.",5fQ9P6kbQM_E0dx8DL6JWA,2,0,4,1szZxIk-a3ixO-iFhR2ZFg

The place is small but the decor is very cute, I love the ambiance. The waiter was very attentive. He brought out a bottle of Cabernet (Yellow Tail, not bad) and complimentary parmesan bread sticks. We ordered Thin crust with buffalo mozzarella cheese and half black olives (boyfriend doesn't like olives..whaaat?). The wait was not too bad, maybe 25 minutes but that is fine because we were not in a hurry. 

The crust was really good, a thin, crispy not too greasy crust, reminds me of Chicago. It is a popular chain in Chicago, am pretty sure they have one in Elgin. Sauce was just right, cheese was very tasty and not too much to overwhelm. Love the square slices.

Essentially, this is a dine-in Italian restaurant but they also have delivery and pick-up options. The menu is a pretty good size. In a lot of ways, you might consider this a ""poor man's Olive Garden"", however the food is good enough that I won't use that term to describe it.

Atmosphere in the restaurant is nicer than you may expect from the outside, the place having decor similar to what you would find in most dine-in Italian restaurants. It is a pleasant atmosphere, though I found it a bit annoying that they had the local soft music station on (but that's just a matter of personal taste, I can't really fault the restaurant for their taste in music.) 

The service was surprisingly good, considering there only seemed to be a single woman working. We were always promptly served despite the lack of staff, at least until around noon when more and more people started coming in. One more server would have been nice, but I'm honestly surprised how good the service was given there being only a single employee to do the job. 

And then there's the food. I had the cheese tortellini and my girlfriend had chicken parmesan. My tortellini was excellent, easily one of the best dishes of this type I have ever had. I tried her chicken, and it wasn't great (I prefer my chicken parm with a crispy outer later of breading), but wasn't bad either. The restaurant also serves deep-fried, parmesan-coated breadsticks that are VERY easy to get hooked on. 

Overall, I was very satisfied with this place, and I am surprised to see this place has gotten several negative reviews -  I had no major complaints whatsoever. Overall, I would strongly recommend this place if you live in the area.",qnJEn88UBRXh8kTCggNOWQ,6,2,4,A9gIcLsg-Xk6RDn0MKGANQ

1. M Deep dish - Hawaiian Luau, 18.49
2. Bacon and Cheese french fries, 6.49
for $3.22 (Used a $12 Living Social valued at $25) 

- Free bread sticks with marinara sauce! Fresh, soft, with a slight crisp. Best part of the evening. 
- Clean and inviting atmosphere! Nice Italian design. 
- 45 minute wait time for deep dish or pan pizza! 
- Bacon and cheese fries were pretty good. crispy and stuck together. But compared to 6.50 carne asada fries, these fries are sub-par. 
- Our waitress decided to tell us that the Hawaiian pizza comes with BBQ sauce, and that it was better in pan than deep dish, but ignored to tell use the charge for deep dish. 
- HIDDEN charge! When we got the check, they charged $21.49 for the pizza. The conversation with Marinka went something like this: 
""$3 extra for deep dish bc it requires more dough""
Where does it say that on the menu?
""hold on...""
Minutes later...
""My manager decided to refund the $3 back""
HAHA...FAIL..
- Pizza was delicious! 8 slices in medium. Very cheesy. Crispy crust, but a bit wet inside. Less pineapples than expected. Needs toppings and less cheese. small bits of ham. IMO, the flavor of Round Table Maui Zaui is better. 
- We got 6 slices to-go and decided to weigh it at home. 4lbs! Amazing! Heavy. haha",rHgT6lBbZ2PaHt0UWfTMtw,3,3,3,69tF3EHUsAdTPGb0LO2aWg

I personally don't mind the breadsticks. I get it, their deep-fried & different from other places. If you leave them out for too long, they get gross & chewy. They're best fresh. Especially with their marinara.
My favorite thing to order is their fruti de mare. The seafood is cooked perfectly, & the linguine al dente.
Their wine is an awesome price too!
The Alfredo seemed to be a little flour tasting. Not very appetizing, but my boyfriend seems to order it every time he goes in. Maybe I just ordered it on a bad day.
Small restaurant which is typically always short staffed. Went in one night an hour before closing & it seemed like 5 other parties came in afterwards.

We ordered pizza for pickup, and when we got it home...wow. It was supposed to be half and half, but it was more like 1/4-3/4, All of the sauce was on one side of the pizza and that side just had the toppings swimming in the sauce instead of baked into the cheese. And on top of having to usually wait 30 min for the pizza, it took almost an hour. On top of it all, when we decided to actually eat it, 1. it was about half of the thickness it usually is, and 2. it wasn't even cooked all the way through/cold. Nothing like waiting forever for inedible food! Or paying for an amount of food you aren't even receiving. 

When I contacted the restaurant and asked for a manager, I got the snottiest person I have ever talked to. He only referred to himself as ""manager"", so I'm not ever sure who I was talking too. He assured me he PERSONALLY made that pizza and I was mistaken about not only the half and half, but everything else as well. Guess my eyes are liars! Sad to say all of this because this used to be my favorite pizza place with authentic Chicago style pizza. Now I will have to search for another. A little customer service goes a long way, and you lost a loyal customer over it.

Oh, i did end up getting a refund, an hour and a half later, but we had to take the pizza back (so much for having an evening in) and ended up with little caesars, which was sadly a million times better than this. And a hell of a lot cheaper.

Ordered online, got 20% off coupon for it being my first time ordering online (pretty sweet!)
Ordered: 
Kid's pizza with pepperoni and bacon
Calamari
Chicken Caesar Salad
Tiramisu
Canoli

Kid's Pizza - $7.49:
Pretty good for being a kids pizza. About 6-8 slices, thin crust and flavorful. 

Calamari - $6.99: 
I'm no expert on what calamari SHOULD taste like but their calamari was really really fishy tasting. For being takeout, they remained crispy and in my opinion you get a lot more than you would at San Gennaro or Olive Garden for a lot less money. The sauce was awesome. I recommend.

Chicken Caesar Salad - Small - $7.48:
Enough to feed 2 bulimic people! Holy crap, there was so much salad. And it was fresh! The chicken was breaded, not very flavorful and chopped into tiny little cubes, which was weird. The croutons were phenomenal, lots of flavor. The dressing (Caesar) tasted home-made, anchovy based and a little too oily. It was also covered in powdered parm cheese. Overall it was just okay. 

Tiramisu - $4.99:
Tiny! $5 for a really really small piece. The espresso taste was overwhelming, not sure if it was the sauce they drizzled on top but it was way too strong. Probably why I'm writing this review right now, I'm pretty wired. I wouldn't recommend it if you love traditional tasting tiramisu.

Canoli $5.99:
AMAZING! You get 2 canolis and they're a pretty good size. They're covered in powdered cinnamon and over stuffed with cream. The actual canoli tastes like puff pastry, really fresh, not too hard. Do recommend.

The service!
After ordering online I called to make sure it went through okay, and to add my desserts on because I forgot them at check out. The girl who answered the phone seemed pleasant but was really confused. She confirmed my order but stated the driver already left. I submitted the order 2 minutes before I called, lol. She apologized for the mix up, added my desserts but didn't tell me my new total. Originally it was $21 and some change, when the driver showed up it was $33 and change. Whatever! So the delivery guy shows up hands me my food, takes my money and leaves. He was pretty nice except he forgot my desserts!! I'm starting to think I wasn't supposed to have them :( so I call back, the girl that answered (different from earlier) answers the phone ""Maciano's please hold"". I say okay but she didn't hear me because I was already on hold. 5 minutes later she picks up the phone ""sorry we're closed."" It was 9:40 supposedly on their website it say they close at 11:00pm on Fridays. I say ""WAIT!"" because I thought she was going to hang up on me without hearing me out. I explain to her that the driver forgot my desserts, she puts me on another hold, picks the phone back up and says ""he's on his way back."" and that's it. No apology or anything. The driver returns, hands me my desserts and offers to shut the door for me as he sees me struggling with my dog and the bag. Oh and he apologized :)

Overall the food was OK. Service could have been better. Desserts were a bit over priced, but it is what it is. I'd like to order their pizzas instead of miscellaneous stuff, they might taste better.",v3in4pF9w0wxtPNF09za5Q,1,1,3,db4_ZmO3for9gNiyihmrfQ

With a reluctant yes we still offer the discount, I gave her my order and she gave me my total. How not surprised was I when I got the receipt to see that they gave me a whopping $3.00 off. That would be so mathematically correct if I had ordered $15.00 worth of food but sadly I did not. I ordered $28.00 worth. Not wanting to add a sour taste to my mouth right before eating dinner, I didn't say anything but "" screw it, I got $3.00 off"".
