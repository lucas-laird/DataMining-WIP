Pulled pork on grilled cornbread with fresh corn on top? Amazing and filling. My boyfriend's cuban (or their version of a cuban sandwich) was also really good, and very fresh. Their burgers look amazing as well. It's cafeteria style (sort of), where you order at the front, pay, and then find a seat and they bring you your food. Every employee is a sweetheart and are super helpful if you have a dietary restriction. 

My only beef with this place is that their coffee is a bit sweet for my tastes. Not anything that should stop someone from checking it out, but just be aware that it'll be pretty sweet if you get a flavored coffee.",wkKnzTG93gutdDWJpjwDQQ,0,0,5,NTmd9nifyzFUjvLPwEDqAQ

The decor has a ""farm to table"" feel with their patio furniture and mismatching chairs. 

You can't really expect much from their food when their ""kitchen"" is behind the counter. I ordered the tartine. The bread was over toasted so it was as hard as a rock. I had to use a steak knife aggressively to cut thru it. My husband got the pastrami hash. It had a pickling flavor due to the large amount of celery that they use. 

This place is great for coffee and pastries. Unless you really like coffee, their coffee taste like donut shop coffee. It's a cute place to sit, work on something, read a book or meet up with a friend, but not good for a hot breakfast.",-ouzfV5nm0Fmv3JRLXegmQ,1,0,2,PPyyfxplYC9f4QbDJ2JROg
49491,2014-04-30,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"My sister actually found this place I think using Yelp! Thanks Yelp for helping us find this hidden treasure. This great little breakfast place is a little far for me to get to so sadly I actually haven't been back since my first time. 

Its a little hard to find because it is hiding behind a metro pizza joint. So you actually can't see it from the street! So as soon as you see the pizza place turn in! Go to the right and you'll see it from the side. 

It is a small cozy little spot and actually is connected to the pizza place. We went for breakfast so we got there around 10:30-11am. I guess we missed the rush because there weren't too many people there which was good so we could take our time to look at the menu and check out the store. 

There is fresh bread displayed and pastries when you go up to order and a small cooler that displays some of the menu options. 

I decided to go with their stuffed french toast. Strawberry and another fruit that I can't remember and it was AMAZING! I never ever have good luck with french toast every single time that I have ordered it I have always been disappointed. This time was a totally different story. It was so delicious and not overly sweet and just the right serving size! 

They have an S shaped table that has outlets built into it so you can get some work done or just charge your phone! Very clever. 

The service was excellent and the workers are so nice and I just love the homey feel this place exerts. 

They also have cronuts on their menu but it is only offered on  a specific day I believe. You can also pre-order them! 

Thanks for making my breakfast experience a delicious one!",zm5ZxCeFYT4GD8u4v60D-Q,2,1,4,SP-OXFQfG6L-jVFEY4M5SQ

This time I ordered the Captain America. A sandwich with white cheddar, ham and sausage. Sounds delicious right? Ah not so much! The bread was AMAZING, but that's where the good ended! The sausage not only tasted like something you would get from the discount grocery store's frozen section it also looked like it was boils instead of grilled! The flavor and texture totally threw me off!

So why 5 stars? The staff was amazingly friendly and though we pretty much serve ourselves they were still very attentive and for my favorite part, the pastries!!

I ordered the ""one of those"" and oh wow! A cross between a donut and a croissant. It was deep fried rolled in sugar and then layered with a thick pastry cream! That alone was worth the second chance I have this place.

It's close and convenient and I'd be willing to order from the menu again. They seem to be on the right track, I just haven't had a breakfast item that has made me fall in love!!",6X3--JJwPaCcNEGhhl90Yg,2,2,5,ZtNOn_ntsc2ipQdpbZ9vnw

109414,2013-11-02,0,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"My husband and I decided to check out Lulu's for breakfast after a morning trip to Gilcrease Orchards and having worked up an appetite for a good hearty breakfast. The foyer, once you find it, is welcoming and Lulu's offers a great variety of homemade breads and pastries if that's you're thing. The ordering process was easy but I must admit, and the main reason I only give Lulu's two stars, is sticker shock. 2 small water bottles and 2 breakfast sandwiches, $18?! 

Ok so I pay the nice lady and we're thinking this is going to be epic. After a short wait, they arrived with our sandwiches, the Skinny Lulu and the Farmhouse. Now I won't take away for flavor, they were delicious. But after all was said and done, I'm still hungry. Each sandwich was comprised of 1 egg and little accoutrement. My skinny lulu was served on the same bun as the farmhouse which is far from skinny and while it was tasty, again, it was one egg with 2 pieces of asparagus. Bummer man. 

So don't get me wrong, Lulu's is tasty if you have the budget for it, but keep in mind the portions are TINY. Next time I'll wait til I get home to just make my own farmhouse with my fresh haul from Gilcrease.",QrD0LkL25MqnyU9BNUSSGw,4,1,2,QEKOfDXJeqx8DktaOhKRmg

We sat and waited for our order for over 30 minutes, at which point I went to the counter and asked how much longer it would be.  The same woman told us that they hadn't started it yet, and 20 minutes was the norm on weekends.  She seemed irritated that I even had the audacity to inquire about our food, and ignored the fact that we had been waiting for over 30 minutes.  Sorry, but I own a restaurant and this is not acceptable.  I was so disappointed that I left, despite already having paid for my meal.

312412,2014-11-13,0,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"First of all most of the food is quite good.  My frustration is that nearly everything is premade and assembled and then just heated up to order. This prevents any customization i.e. for an allergy etc... Additionally while most of the salads are quite appealing those that are topped with fruit etc are also pre-assembled.  So because of that the apples have started to brown, croutons have softened etc. The menu has a lot to offer and many delicious options but I think all of the issues would be ameliorated by making the food to order. Some of the breakfast items with fruit product (i.e. peach french toast etc) taste like canned pie filling as opposed to home made. The more savory items, however, are delicious.

The owner is generally very present and vocal, but she can be just a little intimidating.  They also offer specialty coffee drinks and breads to take home.",tzXuVHY6IsKCp-05cjRBQw,0,0,3,K9R2wJKZ6wPz1s_GoL6_Gw

The manager has always been a little short, but today's experience ensured that we would not be going back. A couple of parties ahead of us asked if they could have a coffee drink decaf, and she looked at them as if they were stupid and said that they could have any coffee decaf. I half expected her to say ""duh!"". And when they paid, the lady that handed her the card asked if she wanted to  see her ID. She looked at her and asked her why, was she a scammer? Seriously?! I almost didn't want to pay with my credit card after that. In this day and age, you don't take identity theft lightly.

We kept our interaction with her short and sweet, paid, ate our sandwiches and left knowing that we probably won't be coming back. We've been coming here because it's close by and convenient when we want breakfast, but that's the only thing that's been making us come back. The food is good not great, and what we witnessed today made us decide that we'd rather patronize other local places instead of Lulu's...

And that was after he got lost a couple of times driving over because he wouldn't pay attention to his GPS.   The food was great.  We split a Bat Ship Crazy sandwich and a Benecio del Porko.   Too bad we don't live in Vegas.  Means we can only eat here a few times a year instead of every week (or day).   What pushes Lulu's into 5 star territory for me is the people who work there.  Robin greeted us and patiently explained everything on the menu.  The kitchen split our orders on separate plates so we didn't have to do it ourselves.

Both items I ordered were already sold out (breakfast burrito and cinnamon roll) so I settled so for the Sloppy Jose. After ordering, my friend and I spoke for nearly 40 min before our food was delivered. The Sloppy Jose is actually quite dry, not ""sloppy"" at all - tabasco required. While the food was decent, it was certainly not worth a 40 min wait. Upon inquiry, the Manager told us 35-40min was a typical wait time on the weekend so my advice is IF YOU ARE HUNGRY, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. The manager was completely unapologetic and acted as if we were doing her a favor by simply being there.

You don't know that you have to order at the counter until they yell across the restaurant at you. Then they hand you a piece of paper with a weird little menu on it and show you props of some of the food. This place is attached to a pizza restaurant, whose connecting doors were open, so while eating breakfast you have to smell pizza. And over flow had to eat in a section in there. Food wasn't too bad but nothing to write home about with very minimal selections. Mostly pasties with a few different looking egg dishes which have way too much bread.

Upon walking in we were greeted immediately and urged to come to the counter for assistance. Most of the sandwich dishes are displayed in a bakery-style window at the order counter.

Items ordered:
Large Caramel Macchiato
Large White Chocolate Mocha
Grilled Veggie Hash
Venicia

The drinks were served within 3 minutes of finding our seats (the restaurant is self-seating, I personally like this style) and the food was served 10 minutes later (and it tasted great!)

The staff was very friendly and helpful, the whole experience was overall amazing. I'm surprised I've never heard of this place before. I will definitely be back soon!",ZTCmye3tIZTDsEY2F63NMA,0,0,5,0TCw0-ZOkPLsyDDZTtnStg
628270,2013-09-08,0,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,I don't like this place. They are incapable of making anything that isn't exactly on the menu. It's not a place to sit have a good breakfast it's a grab and go. I wouldn't go here ever again. They can't even make a simple turkey sandwich. Don't go here if you want a simple breakfast or lunch,00Myy7VRMaD4zDdqNYmTPQ,0,0,1,n4xzl7QjiMFaOPnWTQdvCw

First the Ordering Process was awful - the Order was not entered correctly and two people Finished eating before the Third Plate arrived. Sodas are $ 2.00 per 12 OZ Bottle, the tea is one of those fruity teas sold at Big Lots because no one else would have it. While the place has excellent Bread far above average, everything else is average at best. The Pulled Pork is Overcooked - Under sauced and what is it with raw carrot sticks on the sandwich and Cilantro and Couscous on the side. The Corn Chowder that looks and tastes like canned Whole Corn with Half and Half added. Quiches - forget about it. The Pompous menu is in desperate need of a rework, the service needs Capable Trained employees (even a refill on the Tea is a chore), I can't think of any reason this place will make it. The do have a base of Great Breads - so so deserts, muffins and Danishes ( but nothing that makes them stand out).

644035,2014-02-26,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"After having such a horrible experience at Babystacks (see prior review), my friend and I drove over to Lulu's. I don't know if it was the contrast to the poor service we just experienced but it was so nice to have such good service.  Although  you order at the counter, you can sit in the Metro pizza area which is easier with kids. Also, they brought out drinks over to us, which again helps with kids. They didn't bat an eye when my friend sent her egg back because she forgot to ask for it to be over hard instead of over easy as it normally comes. The manager is always nice and has gone out of her way to make us feel welcome before. 

 I had the Herman breakfast sandwich, a little pricey (about $8 if I remember correctly), but I love that it comes on a pretzel bun and it is surprisingly filling for just being a sandwich. It is just the sandwich with egg, sausage, cheese and a stone ground mustard. 

I have had the chocolate croissant before and it was okay - but of course I am a chocolate croissant aficionado (aka snob) and really only like the traditional french chocolate croissant (as served at Patisserie Manon and the Baguette Cafe). The lemon tart is really good and reminds me of a sour cream lemon pie my hubby makes which is phenomenal. They usually have cookie and muffin samples out which is nice.",xECpt0seSDbTmt1mGcfffA,1,1,3,K47JPUoP1xAx9mpx3JfqLA

722940,2013-07-18,0,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"Had my first lunch here yesterday. I was so excited because they sounded so great. First, I think they have taken the advice of people because their customer service was better than mentioned below. They took their time to ask us for our order for some unknown reason, but after that, they were very nice and considerate. They asked if we wanted to keep our dessert until we were done since we were taking it home. This way they wouldn't be out of refrigeration. Our server brought over our sandwiches and silverware. She was very attentive and brought samples of their breads over. They do have amazing bread but I was disappointed with my lunch overall. We ordered the Turkey & Brie and the Meatloaf sandwiches. I expected more flavor with the Turkey and Brie. I guess because I expected to tasted the fig jam in the description. It was OK. The Meatloaf was monstrous but it was OK. I think it's cumin that overpowers the flavor? But of course, the bread was fantastic. We took home a Cannoli Cupcake and a Johnny Curtis. The Cannoli Cupcake disappointed. It is a cannoli shell dipped in chocolate but the filling was just a frosting like cream. Not cannoli filling (ricotta, whipped cream, etc). The cupcake was more like a basic dense muffin and not special. It is not a cupcake. Someone here said it was angel food but that is not what I had yesterday. Maybe they changed it? The Johnny Curtis looked so amazing! Two fat slices of a lemon blueberry loaf with frosting in the middle. A frosting sandwich! But the frosting wasn't special, just sweet and I wondered if it was a premade frosting? A nice homemade cream cheese frosting would have been great.  I would have enjoyed the slice more without the frosting. So I would come back to purchase their bread but I will probably not have a meal there again. I want to give them a chance with the other pastries but they will have to visually impress me with something first. I was visually impressed with what I had ordered but the outcome was just a little disappointing.",_V-2956yreqDwqSN3n87kg,0,0,2,MwWDntsUAz4VUX21Hm9hhQ

The woman behind the counter was very friendly and went through the menu with us, pointing the items out in a display case. We both ended up getting the Skinny Lulu. Overall, it was a little underwhelming. The large, soft roll kind of took over the sandwich; however, the red pepper pesto was really flavorful and packed a punch. I just wish there had been more of it. I also took a sampling of cookies to go - oatmeal raisin, chocolate chip, and chocolate. Wow, the oatmeal raisin and the chocolate cookies were good - not too soft but not hard and crunchy,and just the right amount of sweetness in both.

The wait time can vary, the majority of the time we have no wait, however one time on a Sunday they had a stack of orders and the wait was about 45 mins for our food.

811743,2014-11-11,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"Lulu's is a little sidebar, bistro-like spot adjacent to Metro Pizza.  Cozy and inviting, there are a few two-seat tables, a long winding multi-seat counter, and a pub style table for larger groups.  A couple of tables are available on the patio for those so inclined to eat outside as well.

A lovely, chirpy lady flutters behind the counter, welcoming all who enter with a warm and genuine hello, and addresses everyone as ""baby."" It's truly charming. After receiving our gratuitous greeting, this dahling hostess graciously went over the menu with us.  A cold display case showcases the selections.  Now, if I had anything negative to say about this place, it's that the plates of food inside this case are not doing Lulu's any favors.  I don't know if they're wax mock-ups or actual plates of food, but they didn't look appetizing at all.  Had those displays been our only basis in deciding to eat there, we may have turned tail and ran.  But the reviews of this jizzy are on point, and the little lady in the big-rim glasses is uber confident in the food she is serving.  As it turns out, she has every right to be.

We placed our order and were handed this funky little glittery soda bottle with a rabbit card sticking out of the top. Cute, eclectic, memorable.  We first sat at one of the tables, but the seats were a little low for our liking, so we opted to sit at the counter.  The tabletop-to-feed your face ratio was much better.

The food arrived quickly, served by another team member who appeared to truly enjoy her job.  I had the breakfast burrito.

We've all had breakfast burritos.  And we've all cut into a breakfast burrito where the outer edge is six layers of folded tortilla.  That wasn't the case here a'tall.  A laser guided, precision incision into the corner of my burrito revealed a pocket full of cheese, beans, pork and other fillings.  Pipin' hot and full of flavor, the burrito was stuffed full of tasty fixings.  The warm salsa verde added just the right amount of kick, and there was no skimping on the meat.  The verde was so good, we asked for an extra side of it!  

After we'd gone and engorged ourselves, we sat for a few minutes and enjoyed the ambiance of the place.  Although it's busy and bustling, the crew are never harried.  They're efficient, courteous, and professional.  And the food is generous, delicious, and fulfilling.

But I believe the success of Lulu's is due to the personality behind the counter.  The sweet little lady in the big spectacles is Lulu's secret weapon.  She treats everyone like family; as if we're coming to visit for a home cooked meal.",pphrt7iAXMjg8QqLHHUA2Q,4,2,5,OGRZWCz8zKzrTnn6n6m4rQ

I found out the first time that they only serve them on weekends and was warned to come early.  The first time I came, I had my eye on the custard raisin roll.  There was only one left and the lady in front of me ordered it.  Apparently, what you see is all they have.  

So I came back again today (Saturday) at 9 am hoping for a wider selection.  I ordered everything I wanted: kronut, custard raisin roll, and a guava croissant.  Note! There were 3 raisin rolls when I placed my order.  Anyway, I ordered a sit-down meal and they brought me my kronuts to the table (I wanted all the pastries to go).  Then they brought out the meal I ordered.  I advised the waitress that I didn't receive my raisin roll or croissant.  She took my receipt and came back letting me know they sold all the raisin rolls.  WTF! Now I'm pissed.  She tells me she'll go see what they can do and assured me she'd make it right.  Another girl came back to me and apologized letting me know they sold them all and offered to replace it with another pastry.  I ORDERED EVERYTHING I WANTED! Anyway... I requested a refund and left.  

Make sure they package your pastry when you place your order! I am upset but the staff was pleasant for both visits. They just need to work on their operation side of things.",8q7zz5-0ZtYFu1WrnjZdeg,6,3,2,RjyKG31KD3csWax9ajcdMQ

They have breakfast, lunch, an assortment of baked goods, and a pretty extensive menu of their specialty lattes. We were there early on a week day morning, and judging by some of the other reviews, this is the time to come. It was pretty empty in there, and I'm assuming it can get really packed on the weekends, so if you live in the area this would make a great before work stop, as service was fast. This place is small, and could get busy pretty quickly.

The decor inside is wonderful, and there are tons of windows!

We had the vegetable hash which was delicious and loaded with plenty of flavorful veggies, the eggs were cooked absolutely perfectly, and the toast which was their bread of the day (a yummy french country loaf) was perfectly toasted and delicious. We also had a breakfast sandwich though I cant remember the name, the bun was large and fresh, it came spread with a yummy onion jam, spinach, tomatoes, thick cut bacon and another perfectly cooked egg. Their house yogurt parfait was great, and their homemade granola was so good we bought a bag to take home, its loaded with lightly sweetened roasted nuts and tons of dried fruits.

Overall the food and experience was great and we will definitely be back if we are in the area.

Today, I visited and was greeted by an extremely kind and helpful young woman. She told me about their breads (they only had three options--pretzel rolls, brioche, and country white), cookies (two options), and pastries (4-5 options) and asked if I wanted one of their made-to-order sandwiches. I just purchased two bakery items--a cinnamon roll and cream-filled croissant. Both were huge and incredible! The croissant was overflowing with yummy cream. The cinnamon roll, covered in cream cheese frosting, was more of an elephant ear (I think that's what they're called... you know, they're like coiled pie crust sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar). The croissant was underpriced at $3.50, but the cinnamon roll was overpriced at $5. 

I loved the pastries, but can't see myself going back too soon. The woman who took my payment at the counter was downright rude. She said she's been the manager for over 20 years which, apparently, explains my past experiences. I was kind and smiled, and yet she yanked my payment card rom my hand and seemingly threw it back. She scowled the entire time and gave me the impression that I was disturbing her simply by purchasing items from her store.",7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ,3,0,2,07jorE87vK22RtILiCL7EQ

I was impressed by the atmosphere when I walked in, but my positive mood soon took a turn for the worse. The teenage kids behind the counter were nice enough, but when my GF ordered a featured chicken chorizo sandwich after five minutes of debating, only then were we told that they were out of chicken chorizo, lol. After ordering, we stood in front of the register at the opposite end of the counter only to be ignored by a woman (who I can only assume was Lulu herself), while she filed receipts, moved things around and belittled the staff. When I finally got attention from one of the teens behind the counter to ask the price of a specific bottled soda, no one knew. The teen cashier asked the stern Lulu lady, who ignored us (even though we were still right in front of her) and snapped a vague answer back to the cashier. The poor girl cashier looked so scared to get a clear answer from this Lulu lady, that she told me the price was ""between $1.50 and $3.00"". I put the soda back. When Lulu finally acknowledged us, my GF presented a coupon. Apparently Lulu wasn't ready for it and snapped, ""yeah, I see it"". So not only does she treat her staff like isht, she follows suit with customers. Now to the food. We were the only order working, and it took 15 minutes to make two sandwiches. It may have had something to do with Lulu charging up to the teen male cook and belittling him out in the open about not following her instructions. My roast beef sandwich was poor quality and impossible to chew. Very fatty. The bread was good, but the side was barely something you could consider a salad. Out of about six employees trying to act busy, not one asked us how our food was. I'm guessing by the guilty looks silently screaming ""help me"" I kept getting from the staff, none wanted to be fired by the evil old lady who runs the place. My guess is the Metro Pizza owners gave grandma a project to keep her busy, and out of their hair. Good for them, bad for us.",F4Jj_4WC0UUyxa-aOvN31w,3,1,1,RVIgW0iq80mapnTIqV2bSw

My husband and son both got breakfast sandwiches. They were both very pleased and their hunger satisfied when we left.

But like I said, come here with time to spare. Even coming after their morning rush, I waited half an hour for my food.

Atmosphere: I was wowed it really doesn't feel like a Las Vegas shoppe for sure. The owner is helming the register and there are a half dozen workers handling food and orders.

Food: mixed. The baked goods were amazing. The coffee was nothing special fresh and hot. I ordered the benicio del porko. It was good, new flavor combination for me and a generous portion. My wife had the new years resolution it was flavorful and also a great portion.

Service: although the service was very friendly their system is cluttered and inefficient for a rush.

They have a grilled cheese of the day and unfortunately it was absolutely horrible.  I really hope it was just a bad day. It was turkey, bacon, Brie and cranberry.  Sounds kinda good?  It did to me.  The turkey was dry and tasted like it was going bad.  The Brie was also funky with a funny flavor to it.  They used tons of dried whole cranberries and they were sooooo sour.  The worst sandwich I've ever tasted.  The salad it came with was overwhelmingly drenched in dressing and not edible.  Just a tip for the cook; cranberry sauce or chutney would have been so much better.  Fresher turkey and cheese would also make a world of difference.  The bread was good and so was the bacon.

I did enjoy my coffee! 
The older lady that cashiers might want to think about treating the employees better.  She seemed so aggressively angry and rude to them in front of customers.  They were all so robotic and seemed scared of her.  It was interesting to see all the fake sweeties and babies she gave to the customers but would turn around and bark orders at the other workers.  Made me uncomfortable and I felt sorry for the employees.  I would probably like this place better if she was more professional.",Sw69CeTA03hsCR_UqJTlvA,0,0,3,qkQ6oSVctF5aNf4TWsdSYg

Cute little hidden gem tucked away at the edge of town. Offering up good eats and mouth watering pastries. Spoiler alert: your diet will be ruined today. But it's okay. Treat Yo Self! 

Benicio Del Porko and Dirty Chips are highly recommended. Skip the Pastrami Hash. Not a lot of meat, too much celery (Yes, I said celery. Weird right? lol) and soggy potatoes. I did like toast and jam that came with it though. Super crunchy & buttery...mmmm. And we really enjoyed the stuffed (Apple) French Toast. My kids practically demolished it.

Everything was superb from the pastries to the specialty drinks it was an A+. We tried the The chocolate croissant and another pastry I forgot the name while we sipped on Chai Tea Lattes and a mocha frappucino  while we waited for our Benecio's to be ready. Just delicious! Once the main meal came omg what an explosion of flavors. Highly recommend this place if your looking for something other than your typical eggs and bacon dishes. The price point isnt horrible but when you add pastries and specialty drinks your bill will jump up to about $50 for two ppl. The Benecio platter is pretty large two ppl can definitely share that so portions are huge even with the pastries.

Since Sweet Delights Cuban Bakery closed over two years ago, I've missed great pastry in the north side of Vegas near my mom's house. When my brother, a picky pastry fanatic, raved about this place, it was definitely worth a try since I am in Vegas once a month.  So on a Monday morning a 7:30 AM, I made the five mile trek from my mom's house into this bakery  not too far from a Target.  

From the outside, I could see some smiling counter girls with a smile on their morning faces. When I walked inside, the sweet smell of butter smacked me upside the nose.  The place is big and modern, and there's no question the pastries are stars. There are two families munching heartily on their breakfasts.  But my eyes aimed lustily on the big, the golden brown, beautifully presented croissants.  ""Hello sir, are you here for breakfast? ""Actually, I am here for these pastries"".  They're not too cheap, but once I got them home, the four items... blueberry, apple, plain and chocolate croissants were gone in a flash.  The flavors and texture were perfect. I go to pastry shops all over LA and OC where I live, and only a handful can get that texture just right. Flaky on the outside, soft and tender on the inside. With home brewed French Roast coffee. it was a simply perfect breakfast.  They had some very cool breads that I will try next time, along with other pastries.  My doc says to take it easy on the carbs...limit yourself eating them as an occasional treat.

But I am originally from Washington.  Despite what you may think, most Washingtonians despise Starbucks (unless you are one of the yuppie-types who needs to make some kind of social statement by walking around with an over-roasted, overpriced bitter coffee that needed way too much sugar, syrup or sweetener to make it tolerable in a cup that carries a symbol that states ""the person carrying this cup drives a beemer or wishes they did!"") and most Washingtonians prefer to get our coffee from one of the plentiful smaller, more fairly-priced coffee stands that use far superior coffees from local roasters.  Well this is what Lu Lu's coffee reminds me of.  The coffee here is the best I've had in Vegas, roasted perfectly so it doesn't need crazy amounts of sweetener.  Call my crazy but I like my coffee to taste like coffee, and as a matter of fact, they make the only iced coffee drinks that aren't too sweet for my taste.  A little bit of caramel or vanilla or whatever but you still know you're drinking coffee, and no bitter taste or aftertaste.  Great coffee!

I saw a ton of eye rolls and looks of hatred on the employees faces when she turned her back. The manager called everyone 'Baby'! That's so phony and annoying. Sitting in the restaurant for 30 mins and I must have heard her call someone BABY about 300 times. 

The food was great. It took about 15 mins to be brought out though. We were there early and not many people were before us. Don't drink the bottled soda though! My husband got a Diet Coke and it expired in February! It's June!! 

Multiple people came in with children and ended up leaving because they don't have a kids menu.

I might try this place again sometime.",X7zJJcWcyP9o52P2C9VeVQ,2,0,3,U__CHubsKCDHcAepWl4srw

Finally I stood in the middle of the room until someone from the metro pizzas side came in to help me out. She showed me where to order and even explain some of the menu items shown in the case. I ordered the apple raised French toast. After I ordered, I was left to carry all my drink items to the table by myself. I was not offered a tray or even some help.  When the food was ready, it was not brought to me but I was called up to get it myself, and again was offered no help to carry it to my table. Although the food was very tasty I didn't like that I had to ask for cutlery and then I had to get the spoon I asked for myself, after waiting for awhile when it didn't come.

On this trip I also tried an almond milk toffee nut latte and it was good they definitely have good coffee here. Like I said the portion is big so me and my boyfriend like to split the Cuban sandwich and then we'll order another sandwich to try and this time we tried the grilled cheese which came with Brie cheese, cranberry, turkey and bacon it was a great sandwich but I'm not used to that different cheese so at the last bite of that sandwich the cheese became too much for me but that was just me being weird, But the staff was nice enough to plate us our sandwiches spit since we were sharing.

- the country tartine-- french bread, poached eggs, ham and hollandaise-- WOW
- the Benecio del Porko -- cornbread, pulled bbq pork, eggs, hollandaise -- tasty!
- stuffed french toast-- cinnamon apples and syrup- yumyumyumyum!
-spinach, sundried tomato & feta fritatta - a favorite

The best part about this place is they make bread on-site and their baker(s) is/are PASSIONATE about bread. Following them on Facebook gives you an inside peek at loaves ready for the oven, or their next pastry creation. The ""one of those"" creation, a pastry cream-filled fried croissant, is pretty good, but I love their turnovers and almond croissant-- we never leave without taking a pastry or two home for snack time later!

When we can't stop in for breakfast or brunch we'll go and get one of their breakfast sandwiches for the road-- so much more filling and tasty than the drive-thru special. The best part of these sandwiches and paninis is, though, the homemade bread.

Speaking of bread-- take some home with you. Especially at the holidays, their pumpkin seed cranberry bread with maple butter is to-die-for and made out Thanksgiving table that much more yummier.",8IgcBeeSyDMHQhHq7LNOwg,3,2,4,SBBfZvt4STI8aMbL19iL0A

i'm ecstatic that they're in my neighborhood!

lulu's started out as a food truck called ""lulu's on the move"".
i never had the pleasure of trying them out then but i'd heard so many great things so, of course, was extremely happy to hear that they were opening a brick and mortar in our neighborhood.
it took some time, as most restaurants do, but they finally opened.
we've since had many a breakfast/brunch there.

walking into lulu's gives you the sense that you've left las vegas.
the decor and ambiance make you feel like you're in the pacific northwest or something which is appropriate considering lulu's is in northwest Las Vegas.
i absolutely love that.
and with the smell of fresh baked bread emanating from their bakery, i could just stay there for hours.

the restaurant is set-up like your typical bakery/deli/cafe.
you order and pay at the counter, they give you a table sign, you sit wherever you like and they bring your food to your table.
it's not full service but the service you do get is always friendly and fast.

i've had the opportunity to sample many of their offerings and some of my favorites are:

Frittatas
Tartines
Hashes
Guava croissant is the biz
Raisin custard roll
Cronuts
Cookies
Basically anything from their bakery is delicious!

If you haven't had a chance to yet, come visit the Las Vegas northwest for a little comfort food and baked goodness at lulu's.",pN6pzJR6mK7549M0azoaxg,4,6,4,YSF_2e3oCkF_Ol8sTwIy5Q

I usually request a guava and cream cheese turnover from my favorite Cuban bakery in south Florida when my parents come to Las Vegas for a visit, so it is nice to have a little taste of home just minutes away when I crave it.

I'm also in love with their loaves of chocolate bread. They do offer chocolate muffins, but the cocoa-colored yeast dough loaded with rich, dark chocolate chips and dried cherries is a real treat. It would make amazing bread pudding if you find yourself with leftovers, but that is an unlikely occurrence, unless you plan ahead and buy extra! I enjoyed the cannoli embedded in the center of the cannoli cupcake, but the cake itself could have been more flavorful. Their regular coffee is tasty and strong, which I certainly appreciate.

The manager, chef, and employees are very friendly and enthusiastic, which enhances the experience. The cafe is attached to Metro Pizza in the northwest. I love the look of the brick walls and chandelier on the ceiling, but the large windows make some of the seating uncomfortable. I felt like I needed to wear sunglasses inside the dining area.

Lots of love put into everything from the creme filled croissants to the blanket of flavored hollandaise over pulled pork and corn bread (Benicio del porko). We also ordered a egg sandwich called a 'Captain America' where I opted for the 'over hard' style egg which was basically a traditional egg sandwich on a toasted sweet bread roll, veggies, and cheese but was portioned and seasoned exquisitely. When a simple dish impresses me, I know it's that kinda place.

The attention to detail was greatly apparent throughout every item and I clearly realized it when I saw that even the cornbread had perfect grill marks. This was especially impressive because the cornbread is covered in several scrumptious layers of so many other things. Most dishers will get lazy and skip this step thinking it's a waste of time but I assure you it isn't. That simple detail solidified the idea of pride and joy of that plate, and the entire establishment, which speaks volumes to a former chef like me.

After waiting over 25 minutes for our order, I went to the counter and asked only to be told that we would have to wait another 20 minutes. I pointed out that several tables that were larger than ours and had arrived later were already eating at which time she said they'd try to finish in 10 minutes. I had watched as she checked several places for our order slip and was fairly certain that some mistake had been made, but they insisted that the kitchen was behind and understaffed. After I asked about the food, it only room them another 5 minutes or so to get it out and it was certifiably delicious. They also brought us two pastries in apology for the slowness. We were to stuffed to eat the pastries right away, but they were also fabulous. 

If not for the slow down in food delivery, this would have been a 5 star breakfast. If they had admitted the mistake immediately and gotten our food out to us the way they did, AND computed us the pastries, it would have been hard to decide between 4 and 5 stars. But they never admitted the mistake even after making profuse apologies and giving us the pastries, which makes it hard for me to decide between 3 and 4 stars.

My boyfriend tried one of the iced coffees and said it was pretty good. He also tried the breakfast burrito and said it was pretty good. I had my heart set on one thing and one thing only, there. The Benecio Del Porko or the Pork Benedict. It was so good. I'm not a big fan of bbq sauce so I'd definitely try to get it with less sauce if I could next time, but it was delicious.

The nutella croissant is to die for!

The Captain America breakfast sandwich is a good choice too.  My husband things it's a little too salty, but I think it's just fine.  Lulu's Breakfast Burrito is a winner also.

2619318,2015-12-16,53,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"Located in a quiet part of Centennial Hills, this quaint breakfast, brunch and lunch joint is a new favorite! We never find ourselves in this part of town since it's further north from all of our weekend activities, but I'm so glad we went out of our way this past weekend to try this spot! The café is rustic and charming with an old school, classic vibe to it. 

The employees all seemed very eager to help and sweet. After we looked through the menu, we went to the counter to place our order. The lady running the register was the manager; she was quite the character, very enthusiastic and called us baby throughout the process (with a sweet, but animated southern charm.)

We decided to get an iced chai latte and requested that it be ""extra spicy."" We saw the manager/cashier make it in front of us from of a liquid/syrup blend and not from powder. We also had it topped off with whipped cream and cinnamon. It was very sweet at first, but as the ice melted, it was tasty! My fiancé and I enjoyed it. Rated: 4/5

We also shared the Benicio del Porko - Corn bread topped with succulent pulled pork, BBQ & hollandaise sauce, poached eggs and a sprinkle of more sweet corn! Wowza! One of the tastiest & creative benedicts I have ever had. The portion was generous and definitely stuffed the two of us. The corn bread was not too dense and slightly crisp on the bottoms, like they had tossed it on the grill for a bit. Also, the pulled pork was wonderfully moist! A slight complaint was the BBQ sauce overwhelmed the overall flavor of the hollandaise, but when eaten sparingly in the ""perfect bite"" it adds a nice pop of flavor, complementing the dish! Rated: 4/5 

I also saw some menu items and pastries that looked fantastic and unique. I'm looking forward to coming back to try their creative sandwiches as well!",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,73,69,4,qyh357hV3IZ7r-m9MOVUew

Very cute little breakfast cafe offering pasteries, fresh bread, aromatic coffee, and made to order breakfast dishes. I was like a kid in a pastry store drooling over all the goodies- macaroons, croissants, holiday bread, yum! 

The skinny Lulu: was a breakfast sandwich using their soft roll with egg whites, grilled asparagus, and red pepper pesto and shavings of cheese. I can go on and on about their soft roll- it was amazing. The bread was light and fuffy, but also warm and crunchy, lots of volume but not too dense. Bravo to the bread. The cons- the portions of the eggs/asparagus was very scant. The asparagus was more like little shards, hidden here and there. Cheese?? Couldn't find any. The best part was prob the pesto. Too much bread vs not enough filling ratio. My husband's sandwich suffered from the same problem- he ordered the Farmhouse. 

Macaroons-- maybe these were stale?? Bit into one and it was very hard on the inside. Had the consistency of chewing bubblegum.... Not pleasant. And at $1.25 a piece- stung a lot.

Pumpkin latte- was very good! Love seasonal drinks. Order a large cause you'll finish it all :)",-267Yx8RmdP6io2-qI4UcQ,5,1,3,51grtXSkGtsz0jIIbYaozA

Upon entering we were immediately greeted, the waitress then explained the ordering  process and where we were able to sit. The ordering style is very unique for a breakfast spot, I liked how we're were able to see a display of food that was available to order. The girl behind the counter was extremely helpful in explaining everything, and answered the many questions that we had, as first time diners. I must say that menu is very unique  from other breakfast spots in town. I ordered the Bumbah sandwich with my eggs over medium, and my boyfriend  ordered a breakfast croissant sandwich . We each got a side of potatoes, 2$ extra how can you pass that up! The prices are so reasonable! We actually only ordered one side, the waiter gave us another on the  house, once I saw the size, and realized it was too small, and wanted my own. They also offer fresh squeezed orange juice, and a variety of sweets and pastries to choose from ! Today we had happen to arrive late, so there wasn't much to chose from, but next time I will definitely look forward to trying the cinnamon roll. 

Overall I really  enjoyed my sandwich, it was something that I wouldn't normally eat but I was very happy with it!  Only negatives are the potatoes, they were super plain and small!  I would like to add, that if you are a picky eater, and wanted something plain and traditional, like the French toast , it's already stuffed so you do not have that option. Overall LuLu's is great place! I suggest adding it your list, if you want to try something different , that is not your typical every day breakfast place!

The BBQ pulled pork is flavorful and goes well with the corn bread and hollandaise. The eggs are cooked correctly (though they aren't able to poach eggs) and the drizzle of BBQ sauce completes this amazing dish!!!

My wife got the pastrami hash and was impressed but said there was a little too much fennel at times.

It is stuffed with scrambled eggs, carnitas, black beans, sauce, and pepper jack cheese. Then it's grilled and smothered in chili verde sauce. Wow! It was heavenly.

It seemed as if this place was a sit and order type place but it's not.  You order at counter with the help of some great visual aids...preserved meals on display.  Nice touch.  And thank goodness for that because the old lady behind the counter with gray hair and the butch haircut was EXTREMELY rude and unhelpful.  She seemed to not want to be there and rushed us through as fast as possible and it was pretty slow with only 2 other tables sat.  I decided to go with the benecio del porko which had some great flavors and would of been amazing had it been warm throughout, and minus the parchment paper I had to pick out of the middle.

I'm a breakfast / brunch type person so this hit the spot after our excursion to Gilcrease Orchards.  
It's located inside/adjacent to Metro Pizza. It's the same building as Metro Pizza... let's put it that way with its own entrance.
I had the Pork Benedict and my hubby had the Pastrami Hash.
Both were excellent.  
My pork benedict was on top of 2 generous sized portions of THE BEST CORNBREAD.  I'd order just the cornbread next time and be happy.
This dish is an all-day-er.  Meaning... you eat it and you don't have to eat again all day. (Kinda.)
It does fill ya up.
The pork is tender... the sauce they use on it is a little on the sweet side... I'd prefer something with a bit of a kick or at least a bit tangier.  That's just me though.
The eggs were a little over done for ""over easy"" but I'm not doing to dock any stars for that.  The yolks were still mostly runny.

The Fresh OJ is sooooooo good!!!  FRESH and SWEET with a hint of pulp.

We didn't try the pastries but they looked quite yummy.

If this place was closer to me, I'd be here every weekend.

I also had The Herman which was a sausage and egg sandwich with mustard and muenster cheese served on a pretzel roll. And a few other dishes that were all delicious but escape my mind right now.

The only thing that will keep me from eating here daily and gaining a thousand pounds is the fact that I can't get up to that side of town daily.

Having accidentally discovered it one morning, it quickly became hands down my favorite place to eat breakfast in all of Las Vegas. The menu is delightfully unique with an array of sweets and savories for any of your early morning cravings. Among my personal favorites is the Breakfast Burrito - which is like no monster I've tackled before - stuffed with tender pork, corn, eggs, and creamy cheese, topped off with a green verde sauce. HOLY YUM. 
The Benicio is a whole other delicious beast - and if you're a meat eater and want to have the best damn breakfast of your life, order this. It is two pieces of vibrant yellow grilled cornbread, topped with moist and savory BBQ pulled pork, further topped with two eggs any way, then drizzled with hollandaise sauce. Mother. Of. God. May the brunch gods just take me away on the wings of this heavenly meal. 
I won't even get started on the sweet treats that they have. The Cinnamon roll being amongst my favorites - with a layer of icing so thick you could swim in it.

I ordered:

Skinny lulu- don't know why it is called skinny when they use a large brioche bun, eggs were pre cooked 

Frittata- no flavor, also pre prepared and most likely microwaved to order, accompanied by a side salad that was soaked in dressing 

Harvest spinach salad- ingredients were skimpy and balsamic dressing entirely too biter 

By the taste and texture of both the skinny lulu and frittata it was clear to see most items are pre prepared then reheated to order.

Now, this is not your run of the mill breakfast joint, so don't go and expect pancakes and biscuits and gravy(but it wouldn't surprise me if that showed up on the specials one day). Lulu's offers everything from fresh baked bread and pastries to a killer green chili pork breakfast burrito(by far my favorite daily item).

The bread is soft and delectable, the pastry is flaky, and the cookies are to die for. If going for breakfast, you can't go wrong with any of the breakfast sandwiches. Brioche buns, egg and a variety of different spreads and toppings to choose from. Weekends welcome new specials for both breakfast and lunch. Benicio del Porko, a twist on eggs Benedict, is my top weekend special right now. Jalapeño cornbread topped with bbq pulled pork, egg and hollandaise. Finish with a little bbq sauce and toasted corn.

I asked the server to show me where he got it from and he hauled out an industrial-sized plastic container of corn syrup with artificial flavors and colors. This from the place that promises ""real maple syrup"" and ""nothing artificial."" The kid insisted it was maple syrup until I pointed out the ingredient list to him.

I'd expect fake maple syrup at IHOP but geez, even Cracker Barrel manages to use real maple syrup. The fellow at the table next to us sent his food back because the bacon was barely cooked. It looked raw. It's hard to mess up bacon.

The stuffed French toast wasn't any good, without or without maple syrup. It was just gooey.

I looked to the counter and there was no one there. I had been pleased to find out we had a mom & pop place for coffee in this area that I could support.

We were quickly greeted by the staff and gave us the run down on all their menu items. The smell of fresh bread and pastries just welcomed your tummy to try everything. We had the stuffed French toast which is to die for, the amount of flavors it just made you want to ask for more, we also got the maple sweet potato hash and eggs, which unfortunately does have meat  the menu doesn't state that so being vegetarians we had to pick around it but other then that it was OK.

Most recently it was a pulled pork offering, which was fabulous, but a previous one with sausage and eggs was also quite tasty.  My wife had a dish each time that was basically a variation of a benedict, and it was delicious. Highly recommend that one as well.  Good coffee too.

The pastry we selected was flaky, buttery, and delicious. The Benicio del Porko my wife ordered was delicious (the meat was a bit salty but cooked tender, and the hollandaise balanced it). I ordered the turkey, Brie, and cranberry grilled cheese; excellent, if you're a fan of Brie. Lots of Brie. Lots. Next time I order I'll ask for extra cranberries, but that's a personal preference.

3454433,2013-11-17,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"The breakfast items are on the lighter side. Unlike breakfast restaurant chains, you won't find combo plates of eggs, bacon, and toast. The specialty here is the Egg on a Soft Roll, and there are several variations to choose from off the menu.

Skinny Lulu: Egg whites, red pepper, pesto, grilled asparagus, and Romano cheese. A light, yet tasty roll. All that was missing was spiciness. The hot sauces they have on hand are a few varieties of Tabasco sauce, but I think shaking some onto this roll adulterates it.

S.O.B.: This is what my boyfriend ordered. After one chomp out of this, I almost didn't want to give it back. No regrets about ordering the Skinny Lulu. It was good, but I prefer this one more because of the slight bite it has. There's pepper jack cheese, green chilies, chicken chorizo, and avocado -- the perfect combination of ingredients.

Apart from their breakfast rolls, the do sell other items like french toast, parfaits, pastries, and frittatas. Though I've talked about breakfast, Lulu's also offers a lunchtime menu with an offering of sandwiches and salads. 

The food is made to order and delivered to your table. Their dining area is tiny, but you can sit outside when the temperature allows for that.

I came here with Christina, David and another friend Cameron for a late breakfast/early lunch, but it wasn't brunch (only because it wasn't Sunday and there was no mimosa's). The place is adorable. Kinda cafe-ish, kinda modern barn-ish, kinda electic-ish. A mix of things. Anyway, I liked it. 

I ordered the fruit and cheese plate. Excellent. However, IMO they definitely needed honey for the cheese(s). The cheddar wasn't anything special liked I hoped it would be. The goat was good but was cold, would have been so much better room temperature and creamy. The brie was good. The toasted ciabatta bread was delicious, although they only give 1 slice for 3 types of cheeses, and a decent amount of cheese. Note, order at least 1 more piece of bread.
  
Others had the bbq sandwich, corn chowder, fritatta and an egg sandwich. Everyone enjoyed what they had, that's for sure. We pretty much finished everything single thing on our plates!

I got a bit confused how their system worked as I saw a bunch of nice big booths when I walked in. Thought this place was full service restaurant (Table service). Later found out it was attached to Metro Pizza owned by the same person. We sat in a big comfortable booth that could easily fit 6 people. (I guess that was Metro Pizza's seating area?? but they said OK.)
I had ""New Year's resolution"" which is not on the menu. I asked what's the healthiest, and the girl recommended me this. This menu was created for the people that set New Year's resolution goal to be healthy and lean. (Perfect for me!?) It's spinach tortilla filled with low fat mozzarella, egg white, fresh spinach, roasted tomatoes and lean ground turkey accompanied with salsa verde and guacamole. 
The homemade guacamole was delicious. The ground turkey tasted exactly like Italian sausage which was nice and spicy. Although... I should've asked to go light on the cheese. I love cheese and everything but the amount they put was way too much for me. Even though it was low fat cheese, my stomach felt heavy after eating half of it. I think this menu was far from ""lean and healthy"" (just my thought, you know). 
Would've been nice if they had more healthier options for people that feel like eating lighter lunches.

Dirty Fries-Kettle chips coated with Hollandaise, piled high with BBQ pulled pork topped with Cotija Cheese and Cilantro....Very hearty and delicious!

Turkey and Brie with Apples on Raisin-Walnut Bread...if you're a fan of savory/sweet combinations, this is worth trying! Great service here is another plus and I'm most definitely returning to try their breakfast selections.

 Their section of daily artisanal breads is also very cool. Grab a loaf on your way out to  enjoy with cheese and wine, or if you plan to make more sandwiches.

Service is usually mediocre to fair, depending on the day of the week and if the boss is on shift. Weekends tend to be busier and better than weekdays.
My final visit to this place took place on a Thursday lunch in December. The boss wasn't in and there were no other customers. The girl taking the order let me order an ultimate hot chocolate and a fugazi. When I got to the cashier, he told me that it was a weekend only item and that I would have to choose something else.
I opted to stick with the sandwich. The forks we were given had crusty food stuck to it. I complained about this and was given a new setting. The dark haired manager on shift began talking to the cashier while behind s corner and made several motions towards our table.
The food was delivered to the table by all three of the employees working that day. I took one bite of my sandwich, and the cashier behind the counter started having a big laugh. That was enough to put me off my meal. I did not finish the food or leave a tip.

what i ate:
- sweet potato and sausage hash: savory sausage paired with cubes of sweet potato, yummmmm. And the egg cook knows what s/he is doing cause my over medium eggs were just that (really really rare)! Came with two slices of bread that blew my mind. I feel sad for all those with a gluten allergy who can't enjoy taking a bite of lulu's bread
- burrito (daily special): this was amazing! Everything was so flavorful and it all worked together so well. That salsa verde was out of this world! Definitely get this if it's on the daily special menu
- ham + cheese tartine w/asparagus and hollandaise sauce (daily special): the ham was nice and salty, the cheese gooey and melted, the hollandaise.... omg the hollandaise sauce... it was so good it left me speechless. Again another dish I'd love to eat again

Pros:
- FOOD!!!! Seriously everything I ate was so tasty. I want to go back to eat everything again!
- service at the counter was friendly and helpful. there isn't waiter service but this cute brunch place didn't need it. Walk up to the counter, grab a menu, narrow down which dish you want (toughest choice of the day, hands down), and then grab a cozy booth or sit at any of the open tables
- plenty of space! Even of a Saturday morning the place wasn't too crowded. They open up the doors to the adjoining pizza place, so you can venture in to grab a place to sit.

Cons:
- too many yummy things on the menu! Seriously I couldn't decide what to order
- bright! For those grabbing brunch after a long night of drinking, the crazy NV sun streaming in through the windows may make you want to bust out your sunglasses while sitting indoors
- although I didn't have to wait for a table or wait long for the good, I wish there was waiter service

3815295,2014-03-09,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"I'm not sure what all the hype is about... I was not impressed. Came here today, wasn't busy so I was able to order right away, after looking at the menu I realized there wasn't much for me to eat. When I'm out I eat vegan/ or primarily pescetarian without eating eggs or dairy. Needless to say, they have very limited options for those with dietary restrictions. Coffee was also sub par. 

I thought the layout was strange there is another restaurant that was connected, a pizzeria I believe. No idea if it's the same owners, if not, even more weird. I asked if Lulu's served mimosas, they do not. However, the restaurant that was connected to Lulu's has a huge bar. Could I have ordered from that bar and brought it over? No idea, no direction was given. Again, going back to it being a very strange layout.

Another reason for the bad review was because the workers were very unprofessional. Eating in the dining room during shift, or on break. I understand people need to eat, and employees do get breaks. However, I'm almost certain that if the health inspector came in and saw this happening Lulu's would be fined for this and certainly be given a downgrade in code. I work in the service industry, too and this is one of my biggest pet peeves. Eating in front of guests is a no no. 

If you are an avid Eater Vegas reader and have seen Lulu's on there as a place to go as I've read also, please think again if you live far, it's not worth the drive. I live downtown, and I don't believe it's worth the drive from there.",9ARxqHzCnZ6pY1DmSGFqFg,2,0,2,7qkGl3LX-qr2Z6cecH20nA

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the wait was kind of ridiculous. I believe the owner was ringing people up and I mean...it's kind of sh*tty of me to say, but she spends way too much socializing with each and every single customer, especially if they have kids. Don't get me wrong, I appreciate how sweet she is, but maybe let's not spend 5-10 minutes playing with a customer's baby at the register when there are 15 other people in line waiting to pay. It was kind of annoying. If it were empty, by all means go for it. If there's a line out the door, let's hustle just a tad. Also the parent should have had more sense to keep on moving instead of standing there forever showing off their kid. Let's remember manners in a public place, pal.

The wait time to have our food served took a good 25 minutes as well. Luckily, I had taken relatives from out of town so the wait was good as we got to catch up. However, not convenient if you're hungry or in a hurry.

If they could find a way to mix in the great vibes with a bit of fast service, this place would get 5 stars.

I called to make reservations for a baby shower and they told me they don't take reservations but that I could reserve a table next door at Metro Pizza. That way I could sit over there but I would be able to order food from lulus's. I thought well that's good enough. Over the course of a couple weeks I talked to the manager at metros twice. They were super accommodating and more than willing to do whatever we needed for the baby shower. Fast forward to day of the baby shower. We show up and metro kindly seated us, offered to take our orders and turn them in over at lulu's and bring us our food. Normally you would have to go order yourself at the counter. Super helpful! We set up our table with decorations and presents and a cake and we were getting settled in when a waitress from lulus came over and told us we had to move to a table that was closer to the counter. We gathered up all of our stuff started to move and realize we don't have room where they want to put us. I asked if we could move back to our other table and they said no. Everything was going okay until the owner came out. She was perhaps the most unpleasant person I have ever met. (Not exaggerating) She wanted to know what was going on and what I was talking about because they DO NOT take reservations. I told her I was aware and that her staff had told me to call and make the reservations at metro so I did. She proceeded to tell me that, that doesn't make any sense because they don't take reservations either. As she is chewing me out and we are standing in the middle of the restaurant with table clothes, gifts, balloons and a cake in our hands, everyone is the room is staring at us. I was mortified! Thankfully the mom to be was not there yet and we got settled at the table that was too small before she arrived. After that we ordered our food and they told us they were out of some of the stuff we wanted to order. (It was the owner who took our orders) my friend asked why they have the option to still order it if it wasn't available? The owner got in my friends face about it but once she realized my friend wasn't backing down she settled down. All in all I was just appalled at how they treated us. Here I brought them 10 people for brunch and she acted like we had hurt her by coming in for brunch. If I wouldn't have been so speechless during her rant I would have just left....I should have left. I am not sure how this lady runs a successful business.

3968696,2015-08-17,9,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"Two of us came here for a breakfast tasting with a menu set by Chef Chris Decker.  When we arrived, he asked if we wanted to order or just let him send out what he had planned.  We opted for him just to send things out.

We started with a triple berry yogurt parfait with house-made granola.  We then moved on to five sweets--One of Those, Toaster Strudel, Plum and sweet ricotta turnover,  Peach turnover, and Apple pie croissant.  

After the sweets, Chef Decker brought two egg sandwiches--Bat Ship Crazy and Farm House, two French toast selections--blueberry and peach, and apple raisin.  and an order of Benecio del Porko, an eggs Benedict on house made corn bread topped with BBQ pulled pork.  We also had a breakfast burrito.

This isn't your typical eggs and bacon with hash browns kind of restaurant.  Rather, breakfast here can be coffee and a couple of these wonderful pastries for a sweet breakfast or you can go to the savory side and get one of the egg sandwiches or other breakfast items.

Not one of the pastries failed to satisfy!  The One of Those is Chef Decker's take on the cronut.  It's named that because you weren't allowed to use the word cronut so customers would just say One of Those.  Between the layers of flaky pastry are layers of wonderfully tasting cream that makes this a sweet treat for sure!   The plum and sweet ricotta turnover and the apple pie  croissant were two more outstanding sweets.

On to the savories, the Benecio del Porko, grilled cornbread topped with BBQ pulled pork, two eggs over easy, Hollandaise, charred corn kernels, and cilantro is sublime!  There's a reason this has been selected best Benedict almost since opening.  Everything in this Benedict just melds perfectly.   The other standouts were the French toasts.  They taste more like you're eating bread pudding than French toast.  The soft brioche with the fruit and a dollop of whipped cream are heavenly.  The two egg sandwiches were excellent also.  Again, I found all items to have outstanding taste.

During our tasting, Chef Decker took the time to explain his passion for breads and he gave us a huge amount of information on the dishes.  

Finding out that Chef Decker came from Upstate New York, a graduate of Maine-Endwell  Central School District did not cause me to downgrade my rating.  Our two schools were in different conferences then!

I'd really recommend Lulu's to take your friends and family from out of town for something totally different.  It is good, very, very good!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,19,13,5,CNb_tIGdEbnElZtTtwJ7CA

I joined Amanda, Petra, Shawn, Soul, Alida, and Helen for their Grand Opening week.  The bakery is located right next to Metro Pizza on Sky Pointe.  If you're coming from US 95 northbound, you will want to take the 215/Buffalo exit but make a left on Sky Pointe and head west until you see Metro Pizza.  As for the items I ordered, I started with a nutella hot white mocha, wow yummy.  Sugary, I love it but more nutella please.  I also ordered the Captain America sandwich which was good.  It was also the last one standing, it was the last avenger.  Additionally I got a croissant and chocolate croissant, I did not see it at the time but they had a guava croissant.  I need to go back and try it!  I ordered one each of the macarons and the ladies didn't know what was in the purple macaron.  I found that odd.  

The staff is nice and helpful.  They even helped clean up a mess created by Soul when the doll he threw across the table and knocked coffee all over Alida.

Overall this would be a 3 star establishment if it was housed anywhere else but since this is the only true bakery in the NW area and a decent one at that, come pay a visit.  They can only improve from here on out, the prices on some items are already high so I hope that doesn't change.  I do wish they had blinds though because the windows face South/East and the sun seeps in greatly towards majority of the seating area.

Located along Sky Pointe and N Cimarron rd, Lulu's is one those Blink and you'll miss it kinda places. I think even Google/Apple maps has it across the street in the gas station. But Don't be fooled, it's in the same brick building as a Metro Pizza.

When walking in I noticed quite a few cool things 1) Rocking a yelp logo on the window. 2) It looks new, I mean it's been open over a year and a half and it still looks like it just opened. And 3) The layout is great with outdoor seating, hightop table seating with plugs for laptops etc and half booth style seating.

The menu has a great variety of items to choose from bakery, desert, coffee and speciality breakfast dishes that are made fresh to go or stay. They also do rock quite a few Australian Bundaberg soda products which I believe always deserves extra stars. 

If your in a group and your not feeling breakfast or brunch, just head through the connecting doorway and grab some Metro Pizza or some Gelato as an alternative.

They have a good supply of high chairs, so you parents don't have to lock them up or find a sitter. The staff are pleasant and very interactive if you have any questions.

I have worked in the service business for at least ten years and am now in education.  I have been in fine dinning and worked at a diner and everything in between.  And the way she treats others is wrong. 
I used to share to my friends/coworker/family about this place bc they do have one great dish but I won't bother to tell I what it is because I'd hate to subject u to her rudeness/blame game playing.  I told my coworkers about my experience as they could see that I was upset(one was with me when it happened)  and couldn't eat anyway due to the anxiety she had cause me for a simple misunderstanding that nor I or the person who took the order was at fault or even mad/upset about.
She is not good at customer service and should not be dealing with people.  She treats them like dogs.",5dLAmXWDYb9OAswtNHyVdQ,0,0,1,zVKUvHFYWMxQs32UkYfnbw

Place your order at the counter, and they'll bring your food to you. Daily specials and free refill self serve drip coffee. They specialize in breakfast, per the name.

I had the Cuban sandwich, substituting shredded chicken for pork, since they were out of the pork. Not bad, but the flavor kind of reminded me of canned sardines in tomato sauce, which I like, so no biggie. The accompanying salad had too much salad tossed in already, so I didn't eat much of that. Next time I'll order dressing on the side.  My friend had the Benicio del Porko, poached egg and pulled pork on cornbread topped with hollandaise and bbq sauce. He said it was rich, but good.

I went on a weekend morning and really fretted over their menu over what to get because it all looked so good. I ordered the Goomba and my boyfriend ordered their pork breakfast burrito. From the moment we walked in, everyone was incredibly helpful and sweet. The lady cashing us out even told us about how the family that was walking in at that moment had been going there since their oldest was a toddler. I like knowing that a fast casual place like that recognizes their regulars and harbor a fondness towards them. 

The goomba was a nice little breakfast sandwich on a brioche bun. It had an onion jam on it that was just right. I really enjoyed the breakfast burrito as it had really creamy cheese, the sauce was fresh and it had a nice kick to it. We also had iced pumpkin spice lattes that were delicious and sweet. I can't wait to come back to try out some of their other menu items. 

Extra nice touches--samples of their bread and pastries to help you decide what to eat, locally brewed coffee, and pug ins on the the tables so that you can chill there with your laptop.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,7,3,5,T9pzWHM4xG3jIq_Mq-S5cQ

The pictures of the food were really neat, so we decided to try it out. When we got in, we were a little confused as to how their operation worked. I don't like to use that phrase, ""how does it work?"" Because many people who say that, are just too clueless as to know how a quick service/self service restaurant cafe works. We were confused because there were booths next door, like a full service restaurant. Then, we realized that the Metro Pizza was connected over. 

There was only one table of 3-4 people inside this cafe. We went in about 1:30pm. The decor was cute and quaint. Almost like you have stepped back into a much simpler time. 

There was an elder tall woman, with glasses that seemed like she was either the owner, or possibly Lulu herself. At first, she seemed pretty rude and mean with her remarks and demeanor tone. She took our order and seemed annoyed. 

It wasn't busy(just 2 tables), so the food was out within a good enough time frame. Around 2pm, the lady sat down and took a break. After she was done eating, I noticed that she yelled at her employee about something. The employee looked scared. I think she needs to retrain on speaking to her employees and her guests in a more professional and respectful demeanor.",LcR2WZoFzgrKNi4w1xenQQ,4,1,2,R6dip_VeK8niqx5DvLXYHw

This last time I went she was outwardly rude to one of her employees and humiliated her in front of customers. I had asked for nondairy milk when I ordered my coffee, so the owner retrieved the soy milk and placed it on the counter where the cream and sugar was. While I was paying, an employee came out of the kitchen and, thinking that she was being proactive, started to take the soy milk back to the refrigerator. The owner blasted her in front of everyone. ""Why do you think I put that out there?! A customer ASKED for it! Use your brain!"" Then she proceeded to mumble under her breath, presumably about the employee's inability to read her mind. I was embarrassed for the employee, who was only trying to help. There is NO EXCUSE for a supervisor to ever publicly humiliate an employee.

  From the moment we walked in, not a ""hello"", no direction whether you get seated or place your order at the counter, nothing.

""Ok well you're supposed to get a number but whatever I can help you.""  Then after ordering our food, she gave me my total, I hand out my debit card to her, she takes it, and threw the card onto the counter when my hand was clearly out to receive MY fucking card back, the card that has MY money that I regret giving to that place.

  We then proceed to seat ourselves in the dirty tables still with crumbs from the last person that was there, and she comes over with our food, doesn't even say anything, and yells to her employees, ""you guys need to get more silverware over here,"" comes back and practically drops off the silverware, and then leaves. Not a single ""sorry about that guys, let me get some silverware for you,"" or ""here you go,"" not a damn thing. Just dropped our shit off like if we were animals.

  I am not one to complain as lengthy as this review, I've been to plenty of restaurants, and I myself work in customer service for many years now, but this place sucked, and it's because of that lady that I will never come back.

So we took some family from CA over to Lulu's for brunch yesterday. it was pretty busy, so it took a little longer than usual to get our food. No big deal it was worth the wait.  A couple of our orders weren't right, but they were quickly corrected.  The food was amazing and despite the mistakes, the customer service was also amazing. The manager even sent us hoe with a box full of their delicious pastries for our troubles. She really didn't have to do that...at all!  We weren't upset and we were certainly going to continue to visit Lulu's as often as we could.  It was very special of her to do that.  Anyway, bottom line...customer service is real!!  Food in phenomenal.  Try the croissants (any flavor), the french toast, the turkey sandwich, the turkey burger, the ""basket full of green""... oh heck, just try anything on the menu (and the secret menu) ...they will not disappoint!",93B4ayOGLg7Kx2T9Oul1DA,0,0,5,B17kgKNWKfGKahAHHq5HwQ

It was very busy and at first - I was very excited, especially after seeing all the food that was being plated up. The young woman at the counter who took our order was extremely nice and helpful and explained the dishes thoroughly, the  other gal who checked us out was also very nice I believe she could have been an owner or manager not sure. I did order my food to go and because I only ordered an actual dish and two sandwiches I didn't think I was gonna have to wait almost an hour to get my food. Two individuals that had ordered before I did ended up walking out I know they went up to the register I'm not sure if they received their money back or not. The young woman that had taken my order did come up to me at some point and apologized  over and over again she was very nice. Towards the end of my wait, the woman at the register  who I think may have been a manager or owner got into a small tiff with one of the female employees who had been preparing our food and sent her home. (MARIA) The woman who is being sent home was being a bit loud and I thought this was super unprofessional I went in there to get great food and have great service not to listen to people arguing about orders and food going out. I wish I would've just asked for my money back and been on my way- it's too bad too because the food was very good and we live not too far from there- plus I believe they offer a military discount which is always a good thing seeing how my entire family serves.... to bad LuLu's did not meet our expectations-- I think that the owner or manager of this establishment should re-train their staff to communicate better with their patrons.

This place is comfortable, trendy, and inviting. It's kinda hidden,  no big sign , not easy to spot when driving , but that might be one of the best parts. It open from 7 to 3 and on the weekends it has a steady stream of customers( sometimes you might wait 10 or so minutes to get your food , totally worth every minute). 

Some days the owner or at least I think the owner who I would assume is lulu is here and let me say she is an added treasure to the visit. She has a kind grandmother with a mix of soup nazi (  Seinfeld reference ). Sounds weird but totally true... 

The food it's great , I normally get the Benecio Del Porko, it's amazing. Reading the description you might think "" wtf"" but it works the pulled pork on corn bread with over easy eggs covered in hollandaise sause. It is an amazing mix of flavors!

I have also had the ""Sloppy José "", it's a smaller meal than the Del Porko but it is amazing. It's soft roll with pulled chicken and egg in a mix of green chilies, avocado , and pepper jack. It has an spectrum of amazing flavors that make you want to get another..

The food was good but took awhile to come out. It was 5 families and they would bring out our meals in the order that we orderd which was fine..problem was ..when a meal comes out..the family previously would practically be done with their meal...so u couldn't really eat together.

We went for brunch on a Sunday and it did not seem too busy.  There were plenty of tables available and there was a small line to order.  They take your order at one counter and then you wait in line to pay for your order at another counter. We ordered and then stood in line for about 15 minutes before we could even pay for the order.  The set up is just not expeditious in any way.  We got a table and waited for our food.  There were four of us; 2 people in our party received their order in about 35 minutes....the other 2 received their order in about 50 minutes.....which was over an hour from when we first made our order.  We ordered a Benedict and a 3 Sandwiches (total).....so over an hour seems completely unacceptable to me for such a small and simple order.  The Pulled Pork Benedict was good and the pork was nicely flavored but their Cuban Sandwich was flavorless.  I was so hoping that it would be good enough for the hour plus wait....but I was really disappointed.  We also ordered a side of potatoes...but it was a small plate of about 10 thin, small slices.  The portion was really small for a paid side order and they were also MEH.....nothing special and no seasonings or herbs at all.

It's very confusing when you walk in - are you supposed to sit down? go to the counter? where are the menus? Once we figured that out, the girl behind the counter asked if she could take my order.  I started to tell her and she turned and started talking to someone else.  

Even though there were only 4 people in front of us, it took 15 full minutes from the time we ordered to the time we paid - their system is flawed.  When I asked for water, it was like I had ordered the most complicated drink ever.  Then of course the water thing was empty.  Waited another 25 minutes for our food which of course came with no silverware.  And then, after all that, the food was not that good!  My husband ordered an egg sandwich and he said fast food restaurants have better ones.  I had the frittata which came with salad and grilled bread.  The salad was soaked in dressing and inedible.

Second, she started asking questions about an order for the previous customer without even looking at them. How are you going to ask a customer what they want with your back facing toward them? I found that pretty rude. When it was finally our turn to pay for the food, she rushed everything even though she seemed to be taking her sweet time making the drinks. We waited a good while before she even checked us out for our order. She asked if we were military and my girlfriend said yes but I guess the worker didnt hear her. Mind you she didn't even look at us while she asked. She just ran the transaction through. When my girlfriend asked if she needed to see her military ID, she said that she asked and we didn't respond and to be fair she didn't give us much time to respond.

5049607,2013-05-12,2,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"Finally our neighborhood has a cute bakery cafe. If you follow food truck culture, Lulu's On the Move truck retired and they opened this brick and mortar location. If you follow me, then you know I'm biased to things named Lulu seeing as ""Lulu Cooking Monstor"" was my special senior pugs name that she picked herself (Yes, I'm THAT dog cray lady. Yes, I let my dog pick their own name). 

A quick spot to eat that has a relaxed and take your time feel is definitely a welcomed addition. It would be a good option for someone looking to study or get some work done as it is quiet, homey and has electrical plugs with cafe studying culture in mind. 

It's a come to the counter and order type situation and they give you a order card to place at your table and they'll bring it to you. Instead of numbers its a flashcard with farm related things clipped to a reclaimed and glitter-ized soda bottle. The menu is small, but has enough selections and there are specials rolling out in the future. The case is of pastries and offers, again, small, but good selection. If you're wanting full cakes and huge selection and such, this spot is not. 

We ordered -

S.O.B - a little skimpy on the chorizo, and the egg was over hard. I get many places don't want to do over easy as it makes for a mess, but at least a medium creamy yolk is preferred and perhaps would be nice to be able to give a choice. Still, the flavor was there when I took a bite that had a bit of each component. The bread I have to say was the best part. It was perfectly crunchy, soft, flaky and buttery in the way I want bread to be to make it addictive. I want more of that bread and that's a very good sign! 

Pulled Pork - this was lightly smoky and bbq sauce tossed pork in a baguette with pickled carrots, daikon and cilantro. Basically, a bahn mi with a spin. Unlike the SOB this was very generous on the meat. I thought it was a solid sandwich. I added a bit of jalapeno tabasco and it was aces. 

The BF and I were sharing and the SOB came out and we split it, ate it and waited around a bit until the pulled pork came. Minor hiccup and would have been more of a big deal if we were eating separate. 

Also got a guava croissant which was pretty good! Now, it isn't like my holy grail cuban spot for guava cheese pie always served warm, but this still pleases me greatly and heals that craving for it. I will be coming for these on a regular I think. 

French macarons are my favorite treat and theirs was just OK. The pistachio was chewy of a shell and biting into it made the filling spill out. The chocolate was a better consistency and wasn't chewy. 

We were greeted hello and goodbye when we were by the door.They were friendly at the counter and register while talking us up. We did have someone walk up to us in the middle of eating to see how we were doing. It's not a full service spot so I got up to get refills of our waters myself. Prices weren't bad on the baked goods at all. Sandwiches weren't expensive, though I wish there was a combo type situation with them them to give better value. Still for lunch under $25 and we were full, it was still in a fair price. 

While there were some hiccups that float it closer to a 3.5 star, this place is also barely a week old at the time of my visit. I'll give them that there is room to tweak things and grow, it's a good for it's first week. I will say this place has a lot of promise and the flavor is indeed there so I am fan already!

We had the - 
Tartine: Open-faced Sandwich, Eggs, Potatoes, Canadian Bacon, Hollandaise, and Asparagus. 
This dish was very very good. It honestly doesn't look very appetizing, but it was so flavorful and cooked perfectly. 
Stuffed French Toast with Raspberries and Peaches. 
It was a little different than I expected, but it was still very good. It's pretty much like bread pudding sprinkled with powdered sugar and syrup. 
Chocolate Croissant.
It was a lot better than it looks as well. We were trying to decide between that and the Cheese Danish and the server recommended the chocolate. I will try the Cheese Danish next time. 

Overall, everything was excellent. I loved the lady that was there, we thought she was Lulu, but to our disappointment, she was not. She is so friendly and warm, you just want to give her a big hug.

Egg White, Grilled Asparagus, Roasted Red Pepper Pesto, and Shaved Pecorino Romano. This was a good sandwich! Tasted healthy lol...but good!  The bread is pretty large too, so this is a good value.

We moved to make space for the table. There were three ladies behind the counter who not only didn't greet us upon entering but didn't acknowledge us either after standing right in front of them. We had to ask for our own menu and I even mentioned it was our first time there. I asked for recommendations and she said one response ""everyone gets the egg Benedict with pulled pork"". Alright cool so my friend ordered that and I got the pastrami hash. Both our meals were below average in fact I only ate a few bites before the bland flavor was not worth the calories. Also, I ordered a chai tea latte which was the only decent thing there. It was hot and made just right with the right hint of chai flavor. 
I guess our experience explains why we were the only individuals there. It's a cute little morning cafe however. Maybe a great location to have a private afternoon tea bridal shower at our gathering. Of course, with way better customer service.",vNGs6_DP7ZbtPwX7finVIQ,1,1,2,fhpve_cOeUm-0Vy4fRB31A

5216798,2013-05-02,0,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"Fantastic sandwiches and pastries in a quiet little cafe.

My wife and I went to Lulu's on their much anticipated opening day. We were greeted as we walked in the door by Robin (more about her later) who directed us up to the front counter to order. Kim very politely explained items on the menu, showed us the different pastries available behind the glass case, AND offered us a free slice of their chocolate bread. Very RICH. Very yummy!
Owner, John (of whose mother the restaurant is named after) quickly began preparing our order. Later I had a brief but polite conversation with John who told of the history of his family and baking. Very nice man!
As our order was being prepared, we stepped to the left to the cash register where we really met Robin. Robin is a delightful southern gal with an east coast attitude. Think if they took Carla from the Cheers TV Show and raised her in the south. Maybe it's Flo from Alice's Diner? Either way, Robin is quite a hoot and a key reason why many will be going back to Lulu's. She's rough, tough, almost abrasive, around the edges, but still a lovable delight who's charm and CARE for the customer and the products she serves shines through.

The food:
I ordered the S.O.B sandwich (South of the Border). It came on a very soft bread with that flaky crustiness on the outside that's so hard to find. Inside, it was SO flavorful. A little bit of spice, but not too much. I wanted another right then, if I wasn't so full! Oh, and that I had a Raisin Custard Roll. Similar to a cinnamon roll, it's more moist, and no cinammoniness. My wife loved it, too.
What my wife REALLY enjoyed, though, was the Sweet Potato Hash. It came with two eggs on top. The hash was sweet, maybe with a little fruit, and oh so tasty! She also got a guava croissant, whose filling was too sweet for her (maybe after the hash?) but was just perfect for me. Not like a jelly donut, the guava is such a unique flavor that, combined with the flaky croissant, was just fantastic!
Drinks included an iced Vanilla Latte and Peach Ice Tea, both very good. 

The restaurant sits right next to Metro Pizza, which I thought was their second location, as I've only been to the Tropicana/Maryland Parkway location. Apparently, there are six, all owned by John. It's wooden inside, like a cottage, with old signs around. Very classy, like you'd think a BED and breakfast would look.

I can't wait for the weekend: We'll be back and bring the kids. Definitely a new, fun, and incredibly delicious place to go!

I got one of the soft roll breakfast sandwiches (the SOB-chicken chorizo, pepper jack cheese and avocado spread (vs. avocado slices)) and coffee ($10). I love carbs-breads are my favorite and it was OK, didn't take a bite and think YUM! which I expect to do with place with a lot of 4 and 5 star ratings.

I am a sweets person too and you would think this place would reel me in. But everything looked super kinda overloaded with sugar and glazes (I.e, the generously frosted cinnamon roll-I do not have blood sugar problems but, the way this looked, I believe this could send someone into a diabetic coma with one bite). I wanted to try their version of the cronut but it was filled with white sugary creme, I think the cinnamon sugar on the top likely would have been enough for any normal sweets lover. Anyway everything in the pastry case was in the $4-$5 range so not inexpensive to dabble in and nothing screamed try me (it really screamed sugar overload).

Jury's out on whether I would go back (the location is not central for me. It would require planning with errands to the North).",krdKDJfXT4EKZwWcOrW2wQ,1,0,3,WF6ZEzXrOb_bXvcTyTendg

I can buy 3/4lb turkey with loaf of bread for that much.. 

I guess I should have been happy because it is fresh baked bread but the slices are about 1 inch thick which is a little bit too much for just a few slices of turkey. I found myself taking off one side of the bread and eating it like an open face sandwich.

5278154,2015-05-18,5,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"There were so many things wrong with this place, which is a bummer since I've had this place bookmarked for ages. It's quite sad, really. Lulu's Bread & Breakfast offers breakfast options a la carte at combo meal prices. I'll start off with the bad.  

After viewing a paper menu, you walk up to a counter and place your order. The employee writes it down on a pad and then rips it off, handing it to you to so that you can give it to the cashier. Wait, what? That whole ordering process is ridiculous. Why are there 2 people (3 including me) part of the ordering process? Why do I need to be handed this piece of paper at all?? It makes for a lot of confusion. My order was lost in the process, for example. Okay, I'm finished ranting.

I was feeling like a breakfast burrito and asked if I get one without avocado/onions. Nope, because the burritos (and french toast BTW) are pre-made!! WTF, over. What kind of breakfast joint makes their burritos in the early AM and then reheats them up later to give to customers? Rant 2 done.

VEGETARIAN TARTINE ($7.95): I settled on the tartine. It came with 2 eggs on Toscana bread, with a balsamic spring mix and cherry tomatoes layered on top. The bread was super duper hard and I had to exert a lot of effort cutting the toast with my dull knife. My dad said it looked like I was getting a workout. 3/5

BREAKFAST BURRITO ($7.95?): My mom got this and she said it was pretty good, but nothing special. 3/5
 
SIDE OF EGGS, SAUSAGE AND BACON: My dad likes traditional breakfasts, so we had to make him a custom order. His reaction was ""What the heck is this?"". But, after giving it a try he said the food tasted better than it looked. 3/5

ICED CHAI TEA AND SEASONAL RASPBERRY COFFEE ($8.92): I splurged on some specialty drinks. Prices were Starbucks steep for two small drinks. For some reason, Lulu's doesn't believe in Fountain drinks and only sells small glass bottles of regional beverages. I like my refills, so I wasn't too happy about that. 4/5 

SERVICE: Employees were great except the manager. Que the evil music. She was an older lady with glasses and she was the RUDEST person ever, for no reason! She was the one ringing people up. She was short, impatient, and had an attitude. I could tell the younger employees were intimated of her and felt bad for them. She never smiled and glared at my family. No customer skills at all! This is why I bumped Lulu's down to two stars instead of three. 1/5

Worth a Return Visit?
If it wasn't for the rude manager I would have been willing to give this place a second try. Looks like that's not going to happen.

Although Metro Pizza has long been the flag-bearer for Las Vegas' now-internationally relevant Pizza scene only select locals are aware of Lulu's Bread and Breakfast, the cozy dining nook attached to Metro's Skypointe Drive location run by Chris Decker.

Originally visited as a tourist in 2013 and again in August 2015, the intervening months and rise of Instagram seeing the Chef's @everythingbutanchovies account become a test-kitchen and showcase for ideas that only a few lucky people besides Chris ever get to taste, it was with the goal of understanding exactly what lies ahead that two diners sat down Saturday morning, a five-course tasting very encouraging should any of these dishes eventually see the light day.

No stranger to the space itself, a pair of educational Pizza courses hosted by the legendary John Arena taking place within the counter-order kitchen since the last daytime visit to Lulu's, it was moments after entry that the Binghamton New York native offered his greetings, an early morning of deliveries to DTLV spots like Vesta already completed and a full day on the line yet to come.

Still featuring many of the same Pastries, Benedicts and staff members as last time, an elderly woman prone to calling everyone 'baby' or 'honey' adding a homey sort of charm to Lulu's ever since the beginning, it was with water poured that ten minutes passed before the meal got started, Chris' daily inspiration a sweet Dutch Crunch Roll with crackling Rice Flour playing well off fluffy Eggs, smashed Avocado and Tomato Jam plus two strips of Bacon.

Always working with new recipes, the Bread selection ranging from Pretzel to Semolina to Sourdough depending on the day, course two saw Lulu's French Country Loaf sliced, toasted and topped with Ricotta Cheese, fresh Fruit and crumbled Pistachios, Nectarines and Cherries at the peak of freshness playing well off torn Mint with John Arena subsequently making an appearance of his own carrying two slices of crispy Cheese Pizza created with Caputo's new autolysing Flour.

Stating that in its final form the Ricotta Toast would feature housemade Cheese it was here that Chef Decker continued to move from savory to sweet, the Churro French Toast presented in a Jenga-style configuration of Deep-fried Bread topped with Cinnamon Sugar and Dulce de Leche alongside intense Raspberry Compote every bit as good as it sounds while the Pina Colada French Toast was an elegant Dessert-for-Breakfast sort of dish featuring buttery Brioche completely saturated with Banana Pudding beneath a ring of Pineapple next to Whipped Cream, Toasted Coconut and Maraschino Cherries for garnish.

Opting to finish up savory, though plenty of Pastries were still available should more have been desired, it was once again on toasted French Country Loaf that Chris sent out two slices topped in White Bean Hummus and Roasted Mushrooms, the flavors robust and woodsy with a bit of heat added by Red Pepper Flake and all of it coming together nicely as carried by a poached Egg Yolk.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,9,8,5,0xoUgCw7yAV8CG9jToxipg

 During my last visit, I ordered an egg white sandwich which had asparagus and was served on a bread that must be kin to a croissant. It was both heaIthy and delicious. It also helped me to justify eating one of Lulu's soft chocolate chip cookies. As a matter of fact, I've stopped by a few times just for the cookies.

I got a Bacon Frittata (with sun-dried tomatoes and spinach) which came with a salad and 2 slices of fresh, warm, crisp and very yummy bread baked in-house. I love frittata and I love bacon so this was a hit.  My friend got a Tartine - an open-faced sandwich with eggs, potatoes, Canadian bacon, hollandaise sauce and asparagus. Very tasty and filling.

They also have palmier, macarons and all sorts of cookies and pastries. The service was wonderful. Plenty of space even though they were busy. The S-curve table in the middle has electrical outlets to plug on your portable devices which is a big plus in my book!

All the hype building up to its opening had made me anxious to go try. Once you walk into the bakery, it feels like you are transported out of Vegas. It is quaint with its brickwork, large windows and high ceilings. 

The food is amazing. I wish there was one in the Southeast. I got the maple sweet potato hash and was blown away by the portion for $6. The first few bites made me think that it was vegetarian. I didn't get any meat in it. Then halfway through I came across bits. It could have gone either way and I would have been happy. It comes with two fried eggs and a piece of toast that has been pressed. Although that was good, the guava croissant was my favorite from the trip. It possessed a flaky exterior, was not too sweet, and the filling had just the right amount so that nothing comes out when you bite into it. The biggest disappointment were the macarons.

Get there early to ensure the best selection, as menu items sell out each day. I personally don't eat eggs but I've been able to find something crave worthy every trip. 
My fav is the french toast. Sometimes it has apples and cinnamon this week it has peaches and raspberries. Delicious! But it's not your cookie cutter french toast. It's more like a soft bread pudding. Oh my gosh! 
I've also chowed down the Cuban sandwich a few times and its a pork filled wonderland for $8.50. Which brings me to the fact that prices here are so refreshing. Meaning they are appropriate for what you are receiving. A large sandwich with fresh ingredients on homemade bread would be like $12-$15 anywhere else in Vegas. 
But the best part of Lulu's is the wonderful staff that works here. Every single person has been kind, welcoming and eager to always answer any questions we may have. They are awesome :)",l7E5dQmzqg_X_oUI8x_88g,0,1,5,BJz5h5KT3wOb9JhV-_jjJw

5460556,2014-03-30,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"I've been coming here since they first opened and fell in love with this place, but have found myself coming here less and less. 

The good: They use fresh quality ingredients, and have unique menu items. They also switch up the menu with new seasonal items. Some of my favorites are their salted caramel latte, guava croissant, and bacon egg potato tartine. The staff is friendly. 

Things that irk me: They don't bake fresh pastries every day. Seems like Saturdays are their main baking days with the best selection. Here it is a Sunday with a line of people, yet the display case looks pathetic with one or two pieces of a few different pastries. Basically left overs. I've also come in mid week and found the same. Also if you don't come in right when they open you may miss out on their daily specials, not enough to make it thru the day. 

I really like the food, if and when it's still available.",ChkQ2jkLKScO8WYXZ2lBFA,3,1,4,x4KT1UfZ4TopQQLkRS0srQ

I'm going to start off this review with the customer service . For starters the ordering system was, weird, inefficient and at times problematic. Upon walking in it appears as a cafe with a chalkboard sign greeting you at the door. Displaying the the list of lattes and coffee like drinks that they are serving . You get in line were a stack of paper flyer style menu slowly becomes in reach just before you get to the first station were you place your oder (note: there are no food menus displayed) you order, as in my experience they are out of the item you'd like at 11:00 in the day. Or as in my husband's experience take out the cold pastry sitting In The display case and warm  it in the microwave. Then you go the next station to order and pay . You'd  think this were you get your food . No. It is not, this is where the condescending woman at the cash register gives you a place card and tells you to seat yourself . This is also where you get confused and sit in the restaurant next door if their dinning room is in over flowing but be careful were you sit because only some of their seats are reserved for LuLu's overflow some are not. This is also were we sat waiting for a very long time for our subpar food to arrive. We settled in long enough to observe different waitresses wandering about, and looking for different place cards to deliver. Having not seated the patrons themselves  it plates, this was almost entertaining to watch . And I say almost, maybe if we'd had our less than mediocre food at the time it would have been a bit more enjoyable to watch. Alas it wasn't and the food near inedible . Bland and badly executed. Needles to say we did not enjoy our time or food here at all .",H7NoL5cpMd17_RgOjEPGOw,2,0,1,qz2P59HDYO1UjOlHXTh10Q
5470971,2013-08-09,5,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"They have amazing pastries here- but I wasn't very impressed by the stuffed french toast. Also, what is with the loaves of bread left out? Are those what we can pick from if we want some bread? They are just out there by the line, and anyone can sneeze or finger them. Ew.

Anyways, I really liked the croissant I got (I had it with Nutella xD) it was flaky and light, and very tasty! All of the breads and pastries looked amazing, and were reasonably priced considering they are fresh made.

I did not like the stuffed french toast at all (we got the apple and raisin), it was bland and had way too much egg batter on it that most of it turned out to be mush. 

I will come back to try some other breakfast item, since I really do want to give this place more stars.",g8_8roieVRwGJVTpNOgbYw,7,4,3,u-3xQ-vMBiC3AgP8AAAj8A

Okay it's cute, okay it's one of the only breakfast spots up north...but it doesn't make up for the fact we waited over 45 minutes for our food.  Or the fact that I mentioned I had a dairy allergy, so I removed the bread from the sandwich and made sure nothing was cooked with butter.  The BAT ship crazy sandwich says egg, avocado, bacon, tomato relish with no mention of cheese on the menu.  Lo and behold...two slices of cheese on my breakfast, even after asking about dairy!  Thank you Lulu for my infant's milk protein allergy flair!  The food was just okay.  The side of hash browns was the saddest looking thing I've ever seen....limp potatoes that seemed like they needed to be cooked for at least another 5 minutes.  I would much rather eat at the Aliante buffet for breakfast.  I was thinking I could guarantee there was no dairy in my food if I went to restaurant, boy was I wrong.

There's a good amount of items to choose from on the menu. The restaurant is very cute in its decor. The lady running the register (LuLu maybe?) was a little rough around the edges and barking slightly harsh orders to her worker bees. The dining room has no window treatments so you need sunglasses to eat there in the morning or you can sit next door or outside. I got the spinach tartine, which was good not outstanding. They forgot to cook my egg well done and fixed that...not a big deal. For $10, you would think it would come with a side of fruit or hash browns. The hubs got the captain America.

5599545,2013-11-01,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"So I stumbled upon this cool little eatery, not by accident, but after asking a co worker where they would like to do for her birthday since she is always coordinating events for everyone in the office.  She thought about it then said the secret word, ""Lulu's!""  It was music to my ears, especially since I have been screaming for an excuse to go there considering it is over 30 miles from home.  I only heard good things and was eager to check it out.

Upon arrival, I was surprised to see how big the place was and in a well established area in Skypointe.  This would actually be a solid spot on the way to Mt. Chuckleston for some ice snowboarding, but that's another story.  

You could find Lulu's nestled right next to Metro Pizza, in fact, I heard the good ol' Lulu was the mother of the founder of Metro, but not sure how much truth is in that.  Anyone care to verify?

I will not elaborate on the menu since there are monthly specials and I think it will only be fair for you to come and check out the offerings in person, like I did.  The online website was not informational, does not do justice needs work but make the trip and you won't regret it.  

The joint is very well kept and managed and the staff is extremely pleasant, very important for people trying to kick off their days.  Plus this may be the only place I can be called ""honey"" in front of the fiance without getting punched in the throat.

The food was superb and you can tell they put some thought and effort into the dishes.  For you sweet-tooths', you will find macaroons, pastries, hot drinks and much more.  In addition, the Metro Pizza next door is fairly new and includes a well supplied bar. #typsytime

In closing, I enjoy the subtle considerations, such as little rubbish cans near any handle that may need to be accessed.  Even the pizza boys room had Zero 7 playing...so sick..

Even if you factor the drive, the place is not bad, but that is the only thing that prevented me from adding another star to my rating.",ewDNa_FRoG71UFm56eTGkw,2,2,4,1qQsquLeORok2PrLryVqVQ

We were able to order off of the lunch menu thankfully. After we sat down is when we noticed that there actually was a greeter that meets you at the front door. We also noticed that the greater was handing out 2 menus to people when they came in the door. That might have been nice to know since the first menu we saw left a lot to be desired. It took about 15 minutes to get two sandwiches, which didn't become frustrating until we noticed that the people that came in after us were already served and eating.

Luckily I was just there for some food. I got the Captain America breakfast sandwich. It has ham AND sausage, cheddar and an egg cooked to your liking on a super light and flakey roll. It's a little heavy with the double meat but tasty nonetheless. 

I've seen some other reviewers griping about ""pre-made""...I think they may be confusing pre-made with 'already prepared'. The kitchen area doesn't appear too big so, yes, it appears the make some things prior so they can heat them up. But things like eggs, etc. are freshly cooked.

Everything is already pre-made and then just reheated as people order, which is fine, considering their service is pretty quick. My food last time still tasted pretty good, so I'm not too horribly upset about it, but it does suck when you order something and they're out of it and since things aren't made as you order, they can't just go make you the dish you want at that time. I ordered a different dish and asked if they could modify it for me since it didn't contain any meat, the girl that took my order was totally nice about it and said ""of course"" but then the older lady at the cash out counter kind of made it seem like it'd be an inconvenience since it's already pre-made, the last time I came here she was super nice, so today I could've done without the slight attitude. I was fine with my turkey grilled and then placed on top of my spinach stuffed croissant, although this dish in general wasn't near as good as the one I got on my last visit. Who knows, maybe the cashier lady was tired and maybe they pre-make everything really early in the morning and that's why they state everything is ""fresh"" but I was still kind of bummed by today's visit.

Not only is the atmosphere cute and inviting, but the people are all so sweet and accommodating also!
The FOOD!!! - divine! They use all the ingredients I can appreciate and don't get much of at a regular breakfast spot.
My favorite is the Skinny LuLu- the bun is fantastic, the sundried tomato pesto is of course something special.
They've really come to perfect the iced coffee and espresso drinks (that was a little shaky in the beginning, but its not starbucks anyways)
The pastries are always on point!
I have no complaints and hope they are around for a long time to come!",lBYr_iY0idEpsVEQkaEBmg,1,1,5,NgsqL0v76SVQOH-mhhMCNQ

Will have to come back for lunch sometime soon and hoping to make it back on a weekend soon as well. Service was curtious, fast and friendly.",mOiF-Uq8pMwBiSzhx2Htyw,1,1,5,w8D-TK7tMq0jZ2kpzjxPzQ

The burrito left a gelatinous coating of cheese goo in our mouth, the Herman pretzel sandwich was bland and unappetizing and the apple stuffed French toast made our son throw up on his plate.

5901126,2018-03-17,0,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,1st time here at Lulu's and I'm not impressed. The stuffed French toast is basically a tasteless bread pudding. The frittata was just ok. And the breakfast potatoes were plain and rubbery. I'm giving two stars because the toast was delicious (country French bread made in house) and my latte was very good.

5955262,2016-01-03,0,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,Not a traditional bed and breakfast with traditional breakfast items. A bakery with no breakfast bagels? Food mediocre and poor food selection.,HlWWoRGrfNJ7lzPTam5SXA,1,0,2,IEwYlq3sPIo4iEj0LdzMQw
5961546,2013-09-21,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"Please disregard the lady that gave this place one star. I'm sorry she couldn't find the menus, but they are paper copies in multiple locations around the order area. I'm sure if she politely asked someone if they had a menu they would help her. Her take on the food is obviously a personal opinion so I won't dog her for that. 

I came on a Saturday around noon for a late breakfast. They have fresh baked loaves of bread, pastries, and cookies so my roommates parents came along for some amazing sourdough. The place was busy but by the time you look over the menu you won't have a wait. I had a ""Herman"" sandwich. Egg, sausage, Munster, ground mustard on a pretzel roll. It was about 6 bucks and very tasty. Fresh OJ for a few dollars and a Nutella croissant for 3.50. The dining area is nice and bright. All of the food was good to great quality and the OJ is fresh made so it's an absolute home run for me. If you live in the north/north west. It's an awesome location. Would I drive from the central/south part of town? Probably not unless you like their bread. But if you live or run errands in the region it's a great place. I live by the shooting park so I'll probably become a regular for my Saturday brunch cravings.",kittuNN8czCY1AVA_RvExQ,3,2,5,a0ir3EpR9ztg_QySJjE0ug

5993607,2013-11-23,1,WETHRoXB2IbixndSlOktJA,"OK food, CRAPPY SERVICE : ""I WISH I COULD GIVE ZERO STARS!!!!""  I yelped this place when my father in law came to visit. Both his legs are amputated and it is difficult for him to stand around with prosthetics. (He was wearing shorts, so I know they saw he was struggling). A girl have us 3 pieces of paper and said here is the menu, you order back there. Names on the menu didn't make sense so as I am trying to decipher what each item is for my father in law we started ordering. Apparently order here means order only your food here. Drinks orders are taken by the register! When I got to the register, this old hag started giving me attitude over my not knowing what size drink I want. (Here is the deal: if it's not on your menu, I can't divine an answer for you!!!!!!) so then the hag decided hand me 2 cups with clear syrup; which didn't add any flavour what so ever to the coffee and told me I go fill it up myself. Shall I tip myself too??? Then she gave us a soda bottle with a bike picture on it to notify our ""server"" where we are sitting. The so called cinnamon roll was caked with icing, and was freezing cold! Coupled with this shitty service, I would NEVER RETURN HERE AGAIN!!!!!!",SSeOfQ3gronJEozm-FTMLg,5,0,1,pnrF5-Gl_Aiz6no4hELZZw
