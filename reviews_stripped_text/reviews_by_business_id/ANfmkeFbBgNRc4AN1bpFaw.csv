71295,2014-09-07,0,ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,I took a friend of mine to paint tonight for her first time. We had an awesome time!! The staff is super friendly and attentive. I brought my friend for her birthday. She had an amazing time! Everyone sang Happy Birthday and she even got a dessert to enjoy. We loved the instructor and our paintings look great!! We'd love to bring along more friends next time.,0aN7GiwzszMPMA_K4AWG5w,2,2,5,PKKTa_sAg0chLFDDyF6EBQ

I wanted to do this as last minute activity for a girls night out we had planned... I made the reservation at noon on a Wednesday, and the lady on the phone needed my credit card info to ""hold the reservation"".  Within an hour of making it, one of my friends found out she had to work that night, so I called back to cancel.  Her response was, ""Oh, I'm sorry, we don't allow cancellations within 48hrs.""
A.) IF that's the case, that should be explained when making the reservation
B.) They told me they needed my card info to hold the reservation, but they charged me right then and later emailed me a receipt.
C.) She even told me that switching to another night wasn't an option!!  What?????

I work in the hospitality industry, so this poor excuse for ""customer service"" is truly mind blowing to me.  I've since called back twice to speak to a manager and was told by the girl on the phone (Connie) that the manager wasn't available and wouldn't be back in the office, but ""she's going to tell you the same thing I am"".

So they charged me the cost of 3 people attending a class that we weren't able to go to. 
Apparently this is their way of making money.  Which is unfortunate, because instead of gaining a repeat customer, you've lost future business from anyone I can tell this story to.   

How they have this good of a rating on yelp is beyond me.  There are plenty of places to do a wine & paint night in town, and they don't have ridiculously rigid policies like Design & Dine does.  

For those of you looking for the right one, we finally had our wine & paint night at **Wine & Canvas Las Vegas**.  We had a blast doing it, and somehow ended up with 3 cute snowman paintings despite being artistically challenged.  

This is my first ever yelp review, which goes to show that I felt it was important to warn people of their tactics here.",KE2cxAAtCfk3y0sDfkT9GQ,1,0,1,Y95TbcscKhxkDu8KXhTicA
239733,2015-10-13,0,ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,"My friend and I went here for our second attempt at painting, and we did sugar skulls. After having such a great time at the Durango location attempting Starry Night, we figured a sugar skull would be much easier and more fun, and we were right. Jenny (Jennifer?) was our instructor again, which made us happy as we had already had her as an instructor and knew her sense of humor. 

The painting was much easier than Starry Night (protip: try not to make your first painting one of the great masters. I know I had major confidence issues for a while afterward). Once again,  Jenny walked us through step by step, and encouraged us to do our own thing. I saw someone else mention that they frowned on doing your own thing, but I didn't have that issue. Maybe she just had a bad class? idk. The original painting was adorable, but I wanted to do something a little different, and Jenny encouraged it. 

We had so much fun the second time around that we got a group of folks together to go to the next class with us. Apparently if you have 5 or more in a group, you can have them reserve spaces for you! And they give you a tiara if it's your birthday, so my little brother and I will be celebrating ours this time around. 

Again, I cannot express how much fun this idea is. Design and Dine is brilliant, and if you don't drink, that's okay. They have soda, as well as beer & wine & other choices, and the food is amazing. 

Seriously, if you're looking for something to do? Give this a try. It's a great date idea, good way to hang out with the girls without going to a lame bar & having to shout over the music, and you have something to show when you come home. :)",Jmlqb5UYfygtUXugrpywjg,5,1,5,P17QoKwWj6kySnt7KTEYAw
245844,2015-07-12,0,ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,"I absolutely love design & dine!  My last two instructors were Veronica and then Sara.  They both were so amazing and so helpful.  Tonight I painted with Sara and she was so sweet and so patient with all of her students.  I came by myself and she made sure to always walk around the room and make sure if anyone needed help or had any questions.  I asked her for her help several times and she was more than willing to help me with a smile on her face each time.  She was so funny and keep the whole class laughing and focused the whole time.  She always taught us to have fun and to not stress.  It was so much fun to paint there.  So I have signed up for multiple classes.  The atmosphere is so fun and upbeat.  They have fun music going, the food is always coming, and so are the drinks... If you wish to eat or drink there.  It is your choice.  I highly recommend their food!  The staff are always asking if you need anything and are always so nice and funny as well.  You never feel like you have to act a certain way in there, come as you are and you will truly have fun.  You don't have to know anything about painting and I promise you, you will walk out feeling like you know how to paint while having a great time.  And the instructors I have had have been more than amazing.  They make it so easy and fun to paint beautiful pictures and they encourage different styles and anything different you would like to try.  ""You are never wrong"", is a good quote they say, which I appreciate!  They encourage individuality and creativity!  They food is amazing.  I love the caprese panini, it is my favorite and also their chocolate croissants are oh my goodness, so yummy.  They have a great choice of wine and drinks.  It is overall a great way to spend you evening whether it be by yourself or with a party.",6PpnbOm_119QqpUuZ91Zfw,6,4,5,mXNd2U4BW8LqFisoAZqSxA

THIS PLACE IS MY VERSION OF HEAVEN
ok thats an exaggeration but if you are anything like me (meaning a single mom who rarely gets to go out for a fun night) this is my go to. I get out once a month and dont even consider going elsewhere after my first experience. This place will make you feel like you are this AMAZING artist and at the end just about everyone (with the exception of the super drunk) come out with something similar to the original even with no skills at all! The food is decent and the staff is amazing. 

I want to give a shout out to Christina their administrator as well. That poor girl has been slammed with over 2000 groupons bought that all have to be called in and booked that way. I recommend if you are coming with a group of people with groupons to get all the voucher codes together and email them all in one email to mydesignandwine@gmail.com with the class info. She has been super helpful even with as busy as shes been but that sure could save her and the phone lines and everyone else a lot of time and hassle :)",RYIKVU0CajiNUMIjG9fUrw,1,1,5,_GyM2-ySSNHrjojt3DNy4A
370097,2015-09-10,2,ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,"I arrived early as I do every time I have recently. However, tonight was weird. Started off by getting carded which was the first in my many visits. I sat down at 6:15pm, wrote down what I wanted and no one would even walked by me. I was making eye contacted but nothing. I finally reverted to sticking my arm straight out. After a few minutes that got someone's attention and they took my order at 6:35pm. A drink and chips. I asked for my drink at 6:42pm and was told it was coming. Then she proceeded to tell the other server to get it. Now sitting here 30 mins from my arrival time and I can not get a soda. Asked for the managers email address at 6:50pm. My drink arrived at 6:51pm. Right as the people next to me got their second round and we sat down at the same time. I get they are a big group, but I paid to be here too. Food arrived at 7pm. 7:05pm got a refill, yeah, I was that thirsty. Glad I didn't start with a alcoholic drink. I wouldn't have ordered another. 
Person who was instructing us decided to do more talking first then showing and talking. Talked and walked around too much then showing the walking around. Unfortunately I let my lack of getting served effect me and it showed in my painting. I did not have a good time. I wasn't able to turn it around and not once did anyone say hey sorry it took so long. I wasn't the only one. They have a dinner break halfway through and some people hadn't even gotten dinner as the break ended. Highly disappointed tonight. I never got the managers email....

1816727,2016-08-09,0,ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,"I bought a groupon as a little birthday gift to myself and as a first timer to this, I was definitely not impressed. The quality of the instruction, the food, and the wine were average, nothing that would blow my skirt up. 

The instructor whom I rather not put on blast   because honestly I feel like he didn't know what he was doing versus being a complete a**hole, was just ""OK"". He wasn't confident in the paint ratios, he wasn't very clear on the instructions and it made it even worse because he kept trying to talk over the excessively loud music. We had to ask him to turn down the music multiple times so we could hear him even though we were all seated in the front. 

Now, the food was not worth the price. We ordered the spring rolls & the jalapeño poppers (if you want to call them that) and not impressed at all. The spring rolls were tasty, but really? Only 3 small spring rolls for $8?! And the jalapeño poppers my friend ordered didn't even have jalapeños in them! They were just baked puffed pastry with a jalapeño taste to them. Once again, 3 - 4 small ""jalapeño poppers"" for $8! Geez! 
The Pinot noir wasn't very good, tasted like a cheap wine....a glass for $7! Plus a can of soda is $2.50, which is the same price as a 12 pack mind you. On top of that, the server that was there messed up our order, he forgot my friend's soda, and she had to ask for it after 10 minutes of waiting, plus when we paid, he got the bills mixed up with the people across from us, giving us their change. It wasn't a fine dining restaurant with a packed dining room, so it shouldn't have been that hard to get things right. 

So all in all, my painting didn't come out close to the original because I started to do things on my own because the instruction was confusing and unclear, but it wasn't a total loss. 

Would I recommend this place and would I go back? Maybe if there was a different instructor and server. And maybe if they let people bring in water or their own drinks/food within reason like other painting places in town.",N8I7SBX6o2lX_Ce1_W_D8w,0,0,3,d2wkq6okx9uCSIWfFJIiTw

It's now 5:34pm and I still have had no point of communication. I've emailed them through the contact information online as well and still no response. Having called over 10 times throughout the day but there's not even an option to leave a message because the mailbox is full. As great as this would have been the lack of customer service is very very poor because there is no way for a customer to even receive service with the number provided. This is ridiculous and unprofessional. It requires a reservation to book this wine and canvas night which requires arranging my schedule but I can't even confirm the reservation because there is no one available to speak to.

The instructor was nice,patient, and funny. After giving a painting instruction the instructor would walk around and make sure you were keeping up, helped you out with any part you were struggling in, and gave loads of complements.

I believe she had already purchased the deal through Groupon or Yelp prior but was able to add myself and another person for $20 each.  I arrived about 15 minutes prior to the scheduled start time.  I was given a menu and opted to just order a flavored beer for $5.  I did notice that there was a sign that said no outside food or drink.  That's fair.  No one said anything about my bottled water and I would have been a little irked had I been forced to spend $1.50 on another one.  

The instructor for the evening, Megan, I thought was really good.  She introduced herself, went over her background and explained the process.  It really is step by step and she leads you through it giving you options along the way.  We took one 20 minute break so people could catch up or ask questions.  This was my first time attending a wine/paint party.  It's a fun, affordable evening with friends and you get to take home something you made.  

My major complaint would just be the brushes.  Being that the majority of people are first timers and novice painters quality brushes would be nice.  Mine were frayed and I didn't feel comfortable getting too creative because of what I knew would be a bad outcome.  Meagan even cut fraying from my angle brush.  

When it comes to seating try and sit as close to the front as you can so you can see the instructor and not have to rely on the one small monitor they have hanging from the ceiling. 

As far as the food goes I didn't order any but people around me did.  Basic bar bites that didn't look that appetizing.  I imagine it's more of a frozen to oven kitchen preparation versus actual cooking.  Add to that I didn't notice any kitchen smells.",YfYas8wdkrrvbqXcBH9x9w,1,3,4,nHCEJ3KIwyHOLAeSXeaOvA

They walk you through the painting process, skill is not required or needed. The offer a decent collection of sandwiches, appetizers and desserts. The wine is always good and the food runners adorable. My favorite painting I did was a Charlie Brown tree at Christmas time. 

Plenty of parking and look for them on Facebook to take advantage of discount codes.",Ct25jCAjdFEaq_uzgZ_M6A,1,1,5,smFJIkeZf7q3nzW1m_rqMg

The class seemed to move slow, probably due to this, but it was fun anyway!  However, the class started and ended on time, so she kept us on track.  I've painted there several times and always have a great time. The crowd was especially festive that night with lots of birthday celebrations!  I also love that you can get a nice sandwich and dessert while you paint, and the cost of it, along with beer or wine doesn't break the bank.",DjcRgZ0cJbf6-W2TxvFlBA,0,0,4,ITo2TXU5eNINSe8O2r8bIQ

She had a big headband on. I really really liked her. She was positive and patient and very encouraging. I also want to say that the waiter/bartender was great. He was silly and fun and did a great job keeping all our orders straight no matter how many times we asked for something. They were a great team and we are looking forward to going back. 
I would only add the small suggestion that I wish they had better seats. No back support was difficult and the seat was a little high and narrow (depth wise). 
I also want to say that I was so pleased to find out they have an animal-friendly, plant-based menu. I was very impressed.
We are looking forward to doing it again with a bigger group of friends.",OI7eN_aR8LjgkTYT4Yyteg,2,1,4,FmF1-ONKqDS8MvHwMWapfg
4635189,2015-09-10,1,ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,"Very disappointing. I've painted at multiple locations over a dozen times. This is the first time I've been to this location. 

First, it's not in Summerlin. I would consider Craig and 95 North Las Vegas. 

Second, there was an honest booking mistake where I thought my friend we booking reservations for both of us (she made a same day reservation) but discovered once we arrived that she had only booked 1. There were 2 other women there that had the same issue. Being there were no spots left open, both of us couldn't stay and paint. Our choices were for big of us to leave or one of us to leave while the other painted by herself. Even though they were completely full and had one other person waiting to see if they can get in, no refund was offered. 

I understand the 48 hour cancelation policy, however, we offered our 1 spot to the other duo waiting.  Design and Dine would not be out any money and would still be at capacity. Instead, we got a rude employee who came over with an attitude and said ""what's going on here""?  And then said she was ""too busy to deal with this and we would have to call the office"" then walked away. 

We were just trying to make it right due to a scheduling mix up and there was another patron willing to fill the spot. I didn't think it was too much to ask. 

I will not return to this location. Perhaps not to this chain being there are a dozen others in the valley (and not all the way in NORTH Las Vegas).",WuA2uq1jZmy60_qfTj__NA,2,1,1,z_NAPDrbmB0PZJ-Y5_mTdQ
4767526,2017-09-23,0,ANfmkeFbBgNRc4AN1bpFaw,"The paint class itself wasn't too bad. The teacher seemed new but good enough. 
The problem was with the food and service. Upon arrival, I was told there would be a free glass of wine. So I ordered a glass, which I didn't plan on doing. The wine was brought to me. I took a couple sips and then the waitress came over and asked if they lady at the door told us we got free wine and we said yes and she told us that that was wrong so great, now we're stuck paying for the wine. So I asked if we got a free dessert and she said yes so I was like great. We filled out our paper and picked a dessert and we were brought the dessert we picked out then they asked if we were allergic to peanuts? Which I'm not, but I don't like them. So then here comes our apparent free birthday dessert of chocolate and peanut butter which I'm not a fan of so I didn't eat. So the bill comes and there's a water bottle charge, which whatever I'll take. But then there's also the wine and the dessert we picked. I'm just pretty upset about that. Definitely dampened my experience to spend so much on food and drinks that I didn't want or was expecting to be free. This experience is making me reconsider coming back versus going to a different company who doesn't have this kind of communication breakdown or cheating system where people order items expecting to not be billed for them then being billed anyways. 
My suggestion would be to go to another company that takes you to a restaurant where you'll know exactly what you're getting and still getting to do the painting.",ZTR73AMIx6kuBAvXfdm_XQ,0,0,2,xgAZgioMLfR4hRAMJDEOGg

I called and explained the situation and was told that there were no refunds, no credits...period. I wasn't looking for a refund, just a credit to use at a later time. On their website in the FAQ section, the late arrival policy isn't clearly stated, just that 'you may be asked to reschedule for another session,' which to me, sounded as if they were willing to work with you. Anyway, back to the phone call, it was recommended to come, if able, before 7:15pm. We got there at 7:00 and were caught up within minutes. The instructor was wonderful and so were all the 'artists' in the room. Waitstaff was attentive, but food was just mediocre.

Get the free punch card and get a free class after 9 classes.

They offer monthly specials and pictures scheduled are for novice to master painters. The instructors are always there to provide assistance.

My daughter is pregnant and it was almost unbearable. I'm actually surprised I did not read any other reviews regarding this as I heard and watched more than 15+ people get up numerous times and complained of their backs. This was a 3 hour class and both our backs has been hurting since last saturday. My other complaint is when I've been to other locations, they welcomed your artistic side of personalizing ""ad libbing""  to your painting. I felt a little annoyed that I was on more than one occasion, corrected if you will, it was a little embarrassing in a room of people. Also it seemed like we were working with old paint, gummy and constantly having to water down, never had that experience. All in all the staff were very friendly, the food was great, fresh salsa yum! The atmosphere was bright and cheerful. Prior to this we scheduled another paint night at the same location for May, hopefully I'll have a chance to leave a better review / experience.

My girlfriend saw the groupon and wanted to try the place out - I was hesitant being that I am awful at painting - but she convinced me and we made reservations to go. They recommend you arrive early, to get a good seat (we chose one facing the instructor, so we didn't have to keep turning back and forth to watch her instruct). They lay everything out for you, with an apron, painting palette, canvas, and some fun music! It was mainly a ""girls night"" feel, but there were a handful of couples there for date night as well. The instructor did a fabulous job making everyone (who hadn't painted previously) feel comfortable and like they could do it. Only thing: this location doesn't have their liquor license yet - I'm excited for them to finally have it, so I can indulge in some wine at the same time as painting :] such a great time, even for people who have never painted before.
