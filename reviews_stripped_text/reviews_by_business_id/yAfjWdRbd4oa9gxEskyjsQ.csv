My brother unfortunately is (mildly) allergic to beans, so the nice fellow behind the counter made an excellent effort to accommodate by substituting the hummus. Even though my bro just opted for double rice in the end, the man was confident and ready to take pride in ""finding something you'll like"" as a replacement side.

No, it's not one of those hole-in-the-wall family recipe places, but for a chain, Zikis has some real delicious and reasonably priced meals that could also be considered one of the more healthful choices you can make, given how quick it's made to order! 

Will definitely be coming back.

P.S: The ""Cupz"" place it's connected to is awesome for dessert afterwards. :)",WM00OaPW6D2UvnI7TiM0Tw,1,1,5,-RgQjSTyYrKGfMLsHQ-zjg

Ordered the two falafel plates, the food again was very disappointing falafel tasted like it was frozen the rice had very little flavor to it, the hummus was ok definitely nothing special, again  another horrible experience, the gentleman at the counter was really nice and courteous, I guess he felt bad he couldn't honor my gift card and comped us free dessert from the coffee shop next which I guess is the same business. Ordered the cheesecake which was probably one of the worst I have ever had. I'm usually not one to complaint but after another bad experience with this restaurant and another $24 on subpar food, I felt the need to warn others. Will definitely not be returning.

Sauce was Bland with little to no garlic bite.  This sauce should be life of party.   Maybe the sauce is bland for same reason most thai restaurants ""hot"" is not really hot.   Chicken had no flavor,  chicken on rotisserie was not ready and mine was taken from a container and heated up on flat top grill.

I like that they have so many options on the meats, veggies, and the preparation i.e. Bowl, gyro, wraps, etc. I ordered two bowls and a wrap with gyro meat...all with different veggies. Their hummus is also really creamy and tasty. The prices are very affordable and they are generous with the portions. I'm so happy they finally opened a fast food joint in my area that doesn't taste like fast food and that's also different and unique! Also, the cashier (a blonde, young guy with his hair tied back) was also very courteous and helpful.

The only reasons I gave a 4 star are because I had previously gone and arrived around 8:30 PM and the man who was there turned me away and said they close at 9PM. This time I went, the girl that took my order made me feel a little rushed so I asked her what time they close, and she said between 8-9 depending on how busy they are. I don't know what kind of business turns people away an hour to half an hour before closing, but I guess business must be that good for them.

2381739,2017-05-18,0,yAfjWdRbd4oa9gxEskyjsQ,"Today was my second visit to the restaurant. My first being just a couple of days ago. That tells you that I had a great experience the first time. During my first visit we ordered a chicken kebab plate and a chicken tender kids meal. The chicken kebab plate takes 10 minutes because it's made fresh to order. The chicken kebab is a bit on the dry side (pretty standard for chicken breast) but it's pretty good with the zikiz sauce. The kids meal comes with fries but unfortunately we weren't able to eat any of it because they package it inside of a container with a lid. So without ventilation by the time we got home, the fries were completely soggy (trashed). 

I went back today because I wanted to try the gyro plate and I wanted to introduce my husband to the chicken Kebab plate. Both plates come with a small bed of rice, hummus and Tabouli.. however, only the gyro plate comes with added lettuce, tomatoes and onions. When my husband asked for some topping on his plate as well, they told him it's usually an extra charge.  This was a surprise to me because the restaurant set up is like ""subway"" or ""chipotle"" where you go down the line and things are added to your food. I think being generous with rice portion, a few toppings or some sauce can make a big difference in the overall experience and how the customer feels leaving the restaurant. A little can go a long way. 
 
I gave this place 4 stars because the food itself has good flavor and tastes great.

Side note: a combo (chicken & meat) dish would be great.",8MMkcPuIdEYIDQQaBblxCw,0,0,4,exYTqEvCCWMqPnf1pmo6tg

3482843,2017-04-08,0,yAfjWdRbd4oa9gxEskyjsQ,"At the time of writing this review, Zikiz is a relatively new fast-casual Greek/Mediterranean restaurant that opened in the Southwest part of town. Think Chipotle, but for Gyros and Salads. 

They follow the Chipotle formula to a tee: you pick your dish (wrap, salad, or bowl), your protein (falafel, chicken, gyro, salmon), then add toppings and dressing. Aside from this, Zikiz also offers regular gyros and gyro plates. 

Getting to the good stuff, the food is really good! The gyro meat is tasty, and there's something about their tzaziki sauce that I find particularly addicting. They also have a variety of French fries that range from normal to garlic herb. 

I was excited to try the garlic herb fries, but because the place is still relatively new and was trying to get everything squared away, they had a lack of efficiency in their execution, which resulted in a longer than expected wait time, and my order being partially incorrect (I received regular fries instead of the garlic herb, not realizing until I got home). 

Overall, the food is great, and it's nice to have a Greek/Mediterranean restaurant on this side of town. I think once they've been open a bit longer, they'll have the workflow ironed out much more smoothly, creating a better customer experience.

They fell short on their sides which,  for me, is why I love this style of cuisine. They didn't have the traditional Greek salad and their hummus was super bland. The pita bread lacked any real flavor and kind of seemed like they didn't heat them properly.

I had a wrap on Spanish tortilla with gyro meat, rice, humus, spinach, olive, tomato, tabouli(however that's spelled), feta, and some delicious sauce. It was a fat Mediterranean burrito! 

For my side I had the garlic fries. They are just French fries with a garlic salt seasoning. Like I mentioned before, they were tasty, but overly salted. Like, half the amount would still be more than what McDonald's puts on their fries. Easy fix though, just ask for light seasoning.

There's a really thin woman who works their and I saw her wipe down all the tables at one point. She also called me by name andasked me if I liked my food and later cleared my tray. I was impressed (wish I had gotten her name).

Unfortunately, there is no way that the hummus I tried there today could be sought after. I am very fortunate to have visited the middle east and tasted some of the best hummus ever, as well as having lived in New York City and in Montreal, Canada, where you have some of the best Lebanese food around and the hummus is amazing at many places.
The falafel here was just OK. I ended up ordering the bowl with Hummus as the base and falafel as the protein. You get to choose what kind of ingredients you want to put on top of your base and there are many to choose from at a bar behind the counter, from many different types of chopped vegetables to chick peas to tabbouli salad to cheese to salad dressings, etc. I think that if I chose the rice as a base and chicken as a protein, I would have likely been happier.
The bowl cost $10, which I thought was a little bit pricey for what I got. I am very disappointed in the service because I was not asked whether I wanted pita or not and they put a heap of hummus in the bowl with no bread or pita to go with it.

My girlfriend and I often get it as a salad and pita which never fails to deliver in flavor. Their portions are also favorable making you wonder if whatever you're eating there is indeed healthy, because it's questionably delicious. Also, when they give you hummus, they incredibly generous about it. 

The only thing I didn't really like was that the process is a bit slow. Despite being the second person in line, the wait is inappropriate. I think it's because they shave the gyro then grill it. I wonder how long I would have to wait if there was actually a long line. Pretty sure it would be unpleasant. 

Also, customer service could improve. Every time I visit, the associates don't seem to like being there. It's almost a tad bit intimidating to grab business there, but again, the food is good so I can't exactly complain about it.
