You can find this treasure tucked away in the corner of the old Vons shopping center at Decatur and Lone Mountain next to the Ace Hardware. We've tried the Hong Kong Seafood Combo, one of the specialties of the house, and were blown away by the crisp, delicately breaded pieces of a white fish, krab, shrimp (40 count) and *gasp* moist sea scallops, all with just the right amount of heavy garlic. Yum. The crispy beef is one of a kind in this city, not found elsewhere, and Chef will gladly bump up the heat on request.  Come here to compare.  Mixed vegetables are always fresh with the best sauce.  Love the spring rolls. So much more to explore.",VII0JRQRejoFuVH2Lhnkzw,0,0,4,G4jyO3Gf6B0AcH2_yWY8kg

The food here is never bland or greasy like at many other Chinese places and really tastes fresh and special.  The hot and sour soup is so good that I find myself craving it whenever I think about it!  Another great dish is the Hong Kong seafood special.   The interior of the restaurant is perfectly clean, with about 10 dine-in tables, or you can also order take away.   The location is a bit hidden, in a strip mall on Decatur, on the NW corner of Lone Mountain.   Mmm, I'm wishing for a bowl of their soup now !  :-)",ePUXeZsFYq2WwR2KcF7ZpQ,1,0,5,y-mJux_qXk5WlX5MiPkJuQ

There would be peanuts & medium size chopped slices of green onion, sooo  yummy! My dad also really loved their chow fun here too. The twice cooked pork or peking pork chop..I forgot which, is really good. The food also came in a reasonable portions that always got me full. Their service is always nice & friendly when we either take out or dine in. The cook also had us taste their shrimp rangoon, so delicious. The one thing I'm not sure of is.. if they're actually still open. My mom dialed their number a couple times & got nothing. Whenever we'd pass the place it didn't seem like they were. If they're really closed..that's a bummer because their place had the best authentic chinese food!",IVhd52S1wRToLVNPFQaipA,0,0,5,HX9p1wne4Ng220IZXFxk3w
