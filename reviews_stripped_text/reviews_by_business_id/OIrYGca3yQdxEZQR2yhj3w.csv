The cashier ran to the back to begin preparing pizzas, and said nothing to me. I then waited for TEN MINUTES at the register, while at least 5 people were preparing food or doing other tasks behind the counter. At least half of them made eye contact with me. Not one said a word this entire time. Finally another person walked in the store, and only then did someone come to the front - to ask HIM if he had been helped yet.

When I said that I hadn't been helped yet and I had been waiting ten minutes, I'm sure I sounded frustrated but I did not yell or get angry. Thirty seconds later I finally had the pizza, but not once was I offered an apology for the wait. 

I would have been completely fine with the wait if just one person would have acknowledged me while I stood there for ten minutes. I even would have been okay if someone said ""sorry for your wait"" when I finally got the pizza. But to be completely ignored for that long and then not offered even a ""Sorry"" is absolutely unacceptable.",NWs_VdM8tqnNGilljXHo0g,2,1,1,Y7D-CLUSgjI8LJVsWQgbrQ

Tonight it took over an hour and a half to get our delivery. I called to make sure they had the correct address because it has never taken this long to get an order and because we recently moved [even closer to where they are located]. The manager had nothing to say except that it was on it's way and the delivery driver had our order. I voiced my concerns about it possibly being cold by the time it got here and she said if it was cold or not up to our standards to let the driver know and they would remake it. Why would I have them remake it and wait another hour for my order?

 On Halloween we ordered ahead for a pizza for carry out. We ordered 45 min ahead and were told it would be done within one half hour. After arriving a half hour later, someone gave our pizza to someone else, and then told us that our order had not even gone in the oven yet after waiting for 15 minutes in the restaurant for our pizza. My husband told them to please forget our order and refund our money, as we could not wait any longer. My husband was not mad, was actually pretty understanding of the situation as it was a busy night and we just unfortunately could not wait any longer. He was first ignored, then after asking again nicely for a refund,he was given attitude by the manager who had to refund the money. 

We did not think twice about the incident until we called in again to order pizza for my sons birthday. We were told that we could not order. Our number had been blacklisted. Why? because we wanted a refund because we simply could not wait for the pizza any longer on Halloween. The person who stated we could not order was EXTREMELY rude on the phone, did not allow us to speak to a manager, and ended up hanging up on us TWICE. 

I am disgusted by the behavior of the manager and the workers in this establishment and unfortunately (though it is my kids favorite pizza) we will no longer be paying customers.

I will now drive all the way across town to seek out my favorites again. So here's what happened, which I will be contacting corporate. I ordered a pizza a few nights prior and I asked for it to be lightly done due to the previous pizza being hard to chew. Well as I understand things happen and you can't always determine if something is raw I said ok, bad night I guess. Well I called to notify them that I would be returning the pizza and coming back.

What I enjoyed most about the pizza was the crust. I like the flavor and texture cornmeal can provide on a decent crust.  The crust had a nice crunch to it and was sturdy enough to hold the toppings without sagging.   The sauce was a pretty standard prepackaged just add water pizza chain sauce with a sweet tangy tomato taste.  Cheese and topping distribution was also to be expected from a national pizza chain.  Everything is either weighed or counted to create a consistent pie weather your in Nevada or in Florida.  

What sets this chain apart from Domino's or Pizza Hut was the complimentary crust toppers.  This really adds flavor and complexity to a part of the pizza some do not enjoy.  We had the Asiago which had a great taste as well as the buttery herb which was finger licking good.  

They offer some deals in newspaper mailings that could be perfect for a football party, with pizza and wing combos.

The three cheese bread was missing a lot of cheese. Total waste of money. I've complained at least twice in the past year but the pizza has only gotten worse & the manager isn't pleasant or apologetic, so I don't think I will waste my time with another call. We have been ordering at least once a week on average for the past few years but this time the pizza was so bad that I just didn't eat dinner. Time to find a new Friday night go-to.

Taste wise I'd say it's somewhere between Chuck E Cheese pizza and little Ceasars. 

Less greasy than little Ceasars.
Cheaper than Chuck E Cheese.

Upside is they deliver. 

Downside: My debit card information was stolen with this place being the last place that had seen or charged my card. Card wasn't used days before Howies transactions but once I paid here my account started having random charges within a 24-48 hour.

After she got the salad I asked for packets of Parmesan cheese and she told me they are 10cents a peace. Other places give you cheese packets pepper packets and even paper plates.  If I'm paying $40 I should get at least a dozen or so packets for free.  It would be like ordering tacos from del taco and being told you have to pay for you sauce packets.

The bread you can buy as a side is extremely salty. That is the only thing we have ordered, and not been happy with. Wayyyy too much seasoning. The texture was similar to eating bread dipped in dirt. 

The cinnamon bread is a great dessert! You get quite a lot, and we never save it past the day we buy it. (It gets pretty hard.) 

You definitely get what you pay for. Don't expect high quality pizza. We went in expecting bad pizza, and were pleasantly surprised with a delicious and affordable dinner! Can't beat the price!",-IM1qwYck6nqKizjCzR_ww,1,0,4,EeofS2rXG4auPtcnpOzjjQ
