The place was nice - felt more pricier than a 6.99 or 7.99 entree place.  Service was a bit awkward a first, but never a strong suit I guess anywhere when it comes to PHO. We never went thirsty and our water glasses were always promptly filled. 

Broth was savory and not a shortage of meats. I ordered their signature and a friend ordered off the grill portion. The bowl was HUGE.  Although my bowl of Soup came our substantially earlier than my friends...always a pet peeve and makes it awkward amongst friends it was dang astute and enough to share. 

All acceptable until the bill came....ours totaled $17 bucks and change. ""Hannah"" came by and said that it was a 20.00 Min to use card....WHAT?!?!? I asked where the sign was and she said "" I am just doing my job"" as she flicked her ponytail. We scramble up $20.00 and left the balance of a 20.00 as a tip - sorry Waiter...Hannah was after all just doing her job. 

I left and asked where the sign was...Hannah swung that ponytail once more which set the tone for the entire evening and pointed to the sign. HAHAHAHAHAH it must be handwritten amongst other signage and in 12 point font!!!  I guess I should of read reviews further, apparently it's an issue for others. 

I rarely carry cash and don't like to be pressured to ordered more to get my bill over 20. Too many options out there, although the Pho was good, a side of Hannah's saucy attitude and no credit cards makes me not want to return.",P5zo78XMAvQrJys4b5N5PA,4,1,3,uJjtibSpqPNepv1l1JKuTA

150517,2015-08-15,0,I6qFvR-jVDGqDD_iVG38ng,"This is the first time I have written a review about a restaurant. I have been to a lot of places with bad food; however the effort to write a review is daunting after already having a terrible meal. I woke up at 6 AM today to write this because I cannot contain my frustration. Of course, it is also because I semi recovered after a night of battling with my stomach after eating Jenni Pho's food. If i could give the place zero star, I would have. 
My friends and I came to eat at Jenni Pho because we wanted some pho before going out. The food portion was very big and the waiters were very nice. The environment seemed clean and nice. When the food came out, I tasted the liquid and the pho liquid was a bit sour. I order bun rieu oc myself and from the liquid, I know is 'one of the last bowls remaining' of an old pot. As an avid eater, I have a particular palette but not picky. We did not eat much since the food did not particularly taste good. The flavor was bland and it tasted pretty old. It is understandable that restaurants that open pass 1 AM is mostly for people who have been clubbing and want some food before heading home. The food does not need to be particularly tasty and I get that part. The result for eating several spoons of pho and bun rieu? One hour later, my stomach cramped up so bad as we were walking around the strip. My friends then started have similar symptoms and went straight the restroom. Our night was cut short because my stomach hurts so bad that I couldn't even walk properly. We did not get to go dance or even have a single drink. As a vietnamese, I am very disappointed and question the restaurant's ethic. After the food was cooked for several days (5-7+), you should either taste the food to make sure is still fresh or dispose of it. Feeding spoiled food to your customers while trying to maximizes profit is a terrible plan. I have travel to may places and eaten food from stalls without getting sick. If I am sick from eating food in a nice restaurant and is still laying in bed recovering on my vacation, this is unacceptable. Please be ethical and dispose your food when is spoiled. It really makes all the Vietnamese look bad because I know that we are not all money hungry and trying to maximize profit at the cost of people's health. 
FYI, if you have 'PHO' as part of the restaurant's name, make sure your PHO is at least fresh.",Q2jdmvceyu5Y7t6NGm5vrA,0,0,1,BltDz83Ypp1_9jLJMvMSnA

Alright - on to the actual review :)

We live in NYC and was in Vegas for a bachelorette.  We can't get good Viet food back home so we decided to leave the strip to get our fix at Jenni Pho Grill.  We've been at the other location and the bun bo hue and pho was amazing.  I ordered the bun rieu here and it was exactly how my mom makes it.  The broth was fragrant and tasty, there was a perfect combination of noodle to crab meat to broth. I asked them for a side of shrimp paste because I'm Viet like that and they brought me more than enough...yumm!!  I was a happy camper and so were my gals.  

The service: the owner Jenni is super friendly and the staff did come by several times to check up on us. It was also nice to be able to speak in Vietnamese with the waitress.  Will definitely be back on my next LV trip!",9f0cbbUFYvcAr9v23tg76A,0,1,5,XXLA0YRrD2rJGImKN0cULA

For Jenni's incompetent crew, it took over half and hour between serving spring rolls and pho!  It wasn't busy, just a bunch of clueless and inefficient young staff standing around.  To add insult to injury, they charged me $1 for extra onion without telling me.  Wtf.  After the long wait, they still got the order wrong.  I want the tai meat separate but they put it inside, essentially over cooked to my liking.  Dangit.  

Go some where else if you want pho.  There are plenty of other pho shop who will try harder to earn your money.

 First off, my lady and I saw this place and decided to stop there because our normal pho spot had a line out the door. We were greeted to whom I'd assume was the owner of the establishment. She was a very nice, slightly older woman. My lady and I were seated right away by the nice lady. 

About 10mins of waiting, this older gentleman comes to take our order. My lady orders her food and hot green tea and water, but not before placing an order for potstickers. He takes my pho order with water, but he can't seem to get away fast enough. 10 more mins of waiting a young waiter comes to the table with the potstickers but no water or tea. My lady asked for a green tea smoothie since they forgot our beverages. They came back to inform us they were out of the Matcha green tea smoothie, So my lady asks for the peach smoothie then. 5mins later they comeback and say they have no more peach smoothie. So she asks if they have the mango smoothie and the waters we ordered at the start and I slide a diet coke order in there at this time. The gentleman comes back with the smoothie and waters but not my my soda.. Innocent mistake. I taste the potstickers and they are cooked but cold which makes me wonder how long they were out and if they were from an order that was sent back or changed. Maybe that's why they got to the table so quick. 

Our food gets to the table along with my diet coke. I have the beefball pho which taste pretty good. My lady has the beefball pho with added steak which also taste pretty good. We are eating and talking, our drinks are empty for about 10mins and no waiter to be found. Im looking around and notice the place isn't to packed. So where is the service?! About 20mins into the drink wait the nice lady who greeted us sat a couple tables away looks over and sees our drinks empty and tells one of the waiters to fill our drinks. Damn, it takes the head cheese cracking the whip to get some water refill and order another drink.

Oh and they charge for everything even if you get water and say ""no ice please."" Yeah, they charge you for the ""no ice.""

The pho I'd rate it a 2 ...maybe..meaning it would do in a pinch, but the service  F-ing sucked. Negitive rating if I could for service.

After living here for 18 years, we had pretty much given up finding a good Vietnamese restaurant. But Jenni Pho did not disappoint - in fact, it was perfect. From the minute we walked in and were greeted with a very warm and friendly hello to the excellent service and wonderful food our experience was superb. Instead of the PHO I had the sour soup (I can't remember the Vietnamese Name) and my husband had the chicken rice dish. Both were amazing. I am still craving the soup and will definitely be back for more. This would make a good take out dish to eat at home later - Our order was so large we took it home for leftovers and ate for the next two days (it kept getting tastier every day). OMG Jenny it's wonderful!

Jennifer the owner stopped by and introduced herself while we were dining. She is a lovely and charming hostess and that extra interest was very pleasing.

First I want everyone to know that I've used Yelp many times before to find a good spot to eat in Vegas, and the last few times i was really let down...

For example:

Stay away from PHO KIN DO!!!! They have good ratings but the food is horrible!!!

Now Back to Jenni-PHO, by far the cleanest and best service I've had in Las Vegas.. I'm from So Cal, so I'm a Pho connoisseur ""at least I think so""... and this place was delicious!!! Service was great and the Pho was super tasty.. it had a different aroma to it, not too sweet or salty... you just HAVE to try it... its BOMB!!!! 

Don't need to order a large cause they only have one size, and it's a BIG bowl.

Vegetables were really fresh... don't think I've seen bean sprouts that fresh before... 

I started with Spring Rolls and Egg Rolls.... 

Spring rolls were really crisp and fresh, good portion of meat and veggies... Peanut Sauce was tasty and original too... egg rolls were fresh and crispy too...

I had the Pho with Rare Steak and Tendon, again soup was hot and tasty...  meat was fresh and i DRANK ALL THE SOUP!!!! ""I don't do that often"" =D

Finished it off with a JenniPHO Dessert... that was super good too... not sure what it was but it was Green and my GF was in love with it...

The Decor was really cool... you can see right into the kitchen and the place was spotless.. very hip and modern...

Wait staff was very attentive and I never had to ask for my water to be filled... Good Job guys... I love's my water after I long night of DRINKING!!!!!

After waiting another 20 minutes one of our party asked where the heck was our food??! A server asked, ""no onions, right?"" ""That's right. Three with NO onions."" 7 minutes later, half our phos come out.... the three non onions had to wait another 7 minutes...
And it had plenty of onions on top and inside when it finally did decide to make an appearance. Wow.

Well not really new, its a new branch of the one off of Ranbow and Robindale. Opened really recently, there was a special for free food. Of course who can say no to free? I've tried the first location before and wasnt really impressed but was willing to try again. I had tried the Pho Dac Biet there before. 

Came here on a Tuesday Night, before it opened at 5. Got ""in line"" with the few people who were waiting there too for opening. By the time place opened, there was a snake that led into the parking lot. The restaurant was designed almost 1/2 kitchen with open viewing (large windows) and the dining area. 

Service was pretty good. Fast and quick. 

The special was allowed either Pho Dac Biet (Special combination beef noodle soup), Bun Bo Hue (their pork based noodle soup), or the Com Suon (broken rice plate with pork chop), as well as thai tea. 

First time i came here, i got the Bun Bo Hue (because i had tried the Pho Dac Biet before at the other location), and my other friend got the Pho Dac Biet. Thai tea came pretty fast, as well as the food. Presentation wise, not bad. Flavor, average. I wouldnt say its the best but its not bad. I had a party of 3, anotehr friend had gotten the same item as me. The different sizes of the pork feet we had gotten was different. Mine was considerably smaller compared to hers. Luckily she didnt eat pork, so i got to eat it all. It was tender and not hard to eat. Flavor was decent. Nothing too special. Not really flavorful, but not bland either. Couldn't really tell if it was legit broth or MSG.  Amount of food, given per portion, was a little smaller than i had been used to, at for example Pho So 1. 

Next day, we had came here again for lunch. Wait wasnt that bad. Maybe 1/2 an hour considering peak lunch time and it was during this free food special. This visit, i had gotten the Com Suon. Came with two pork chops on top of the broken rice, slices of cucumber and tomato, with a side of the fish sauce. The rice was plain. Little if any flavoring at all. Added some of the fish sauce to compensate. The pork chops were pretty tender. Flavored pretty good. Bone in so be careful ! 

As i had said before, this was a special they were running for i guess the grand opening of the restaurant, for marketing purposes probably. Portion size and item availability may be a bit different when its operating normally. I hope their broken rice has more stuff, otehrwise, this is definitely not a place id go for that. 

Some older gen viet people like this place more compared to other vietnamese restaurants. For me, it was ok. Not the best, probably prefer Pho So 1 or Pho Saigon 8 more if i wanted Pho. 

OH ! SIDE NOTE ! I am not sure if they implemented this at this new location but at the other location, it is CASH ONLY. They may or already have implemented this so be careful, otehrwise you are going have to run to a bank or maybe use the ATM machine they may have on site.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,0,0,3,9clhNGVeRL2QQFUapxmQ9g

We finished our meal for a good 15 minutes before I had to walk up there myself.  Why did it take us 1 hour to cash out?  Because they suck at telling us our additional to go order of an appetizer was too hard to fulfill because they are out of spring rolls.

That's just dumb. One hour to cash out. Very poor service. The food was good. Average good food. But I will never come back to Jenni Pho again. I don't care how ""creative"" that name sounds.",9kzhg6WhUkCLuk3h4wa7mA,0,0,1,mRjlvpcwcbnLQrLXESrxfQ

Ordered the custom bowl with tripe, flank, and meatballs, and though the portion was large and noodles were plentiful, the broth itself was lackluster- not packed with flavor and earthiness as expected, given the process and ingredients it takes to make. Much doctoring was needed with the herbs and sauces at the table to make it palatable, and even then it was underwhelming.

But the vermicelli pork bowl knocked it out of the park. Loved the plentiful portion of pork, with just the right bit of char to add flavor, tons of noodles and fresh herbs and vegetables. It was essentially a noodle salad, dressed with fish sauce, and deliciously so. Would come back for this dish.

Service, as I've come to expect at pho joints, was nearly nonexistent. Placed our order, got our food, and never saw the guy again. That being said, they seem to be well-staffed and had several guys working in the open-plan kitchen: loved being able to watch what was going on, and appreciated that the kitchen (and windows peering into it) were so very clean!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,0,2,wJ0VBHsgvDx_JCcP8_s4Kg

I already had lunch though at the restaurant next door, but I decided to just pop on in and order some Pho to go. The staff here was very friendly and just real welcoming even though I wasn't sticking around to dine there. Offered me a drink while I waited too.
  
From my vantage point sitting in the waiting area which is partitioned off, I can see the dining area is fairly large and spacious with marble tabletops and wicker chairs that either seats 4 or tables that seat 6. The overhead lighting caught my eye, such fancy looking chandeliers.  It just sets the tone of a nicer dining experience here. At the entrance you can see your Pho being prepared and cooked from their open exhibition style kitchen area. 
  
My order didn't take long at all, was packed carefully and survived the 20 minute ride back home. I ordered the Rau Cai Pho (Veggie Tofu Beef Noodle soup) .  The beef broth had a nice seasoned taste, rice noodles were real good. Not mushy (cooked to order) , had chunks of broccoli, cauliflower and slices of carrots, the toppings, green onions, crunchy bean sprouts and the basil leaves were real fragrant.  Love the tofu that was fried golden brown and didn't get soggy when soaked in the broth.  Pho was perfect comfort food! I was happy with it. Serving was plenty for one and prices are pretty reasonable. Prices range from $6 - $9.  

From taking a quick glance at the menu I also saw they have a kids meal and ""Create Your Own Bowl"", appetizers, and some Chef's Specials you can choose from. The Bun Rieu Oc (Crab noodle soup) crab meat, tofu & Escargot in Tomato soup w/Vermicelli sounds delicious!   They also have a section of different Boba and flavored teas and slush ice drinks. The host who took my order said they're pretty popular and guests sometimes come in late night just to have that. Most definitely will be back for more!

Clean and tidy with modern decor and young English speaking servers. My impression of the food will be made relative to area rather than OC standards:
1. Bun Bo Hue- broth is shockingly bland for this dish but meaty parts were good. Noodles were soft but acceptable. 2 of 5.
2. Pho Tai- very little selection for those accustomed to a variety of beef cuts/parts, you're limited to beef rare flank and/or meatballs, or chicken. Broth average at best, very little beef flavor, noodles clumpy but edible. Too much star anais  and funky flavor from noodles. 2/5.
3. grilled chicken rice- good moist chicken, tasty overall, 3/5
4. Beef stew soup- good stew brought down by over softened low quality rice noodles, but broth definitely flavorful and makes up for subpar noodles. Barely 4/5.

I would not return for pho or bun bo hue but would return for beef stew and grilled chicken rice. Pho beef broth is very complex and few places outside of OC get it right. Even in Saigon they rely on MSG to compensate for lack of skills. I will give Jenny Pho 3.5 out of 5, relative to Vegas, but in Cali, they would barely score a 2.",ThsTKzeZP8Ql0YxVIuVIfw,0,0,3,SP5ksgA_nqz2LZt638crVg

The first time they had a tough time because there was a group of eight people who got there before us, and there was so little wait staff that everything took a very long time.  Just eight people!  Anyway, I had the seafood pho.  The broth was very good, and I would say it was on a par with Saigon 8, which is one of the best.  The bowl of pho was interesting in a good way.  The fish pieces were actual good sized pieces of fish, not fish balls.  There were even baby octopus.

I was there a second time about a week later.  Service was faster.  However, there was a bit of a screw up by the waitress.  We got two bowls, and they weren't meant for our table.  I'd have eaten it anyway, and even put in sprouts, sauces, and so on.  I suppose I'd forgotten just what I'd ordered.  Then it was taken away.  My pho was pretty good, and by the way, I never saw that waitress again.

By comparison with other Viet Pho restaurants, there are differences.  They use lacquered chop sticks, rather than throw-away wooden ones as used by Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon.  The lacquered ones look classy, but are harder to use.  Tougher to hold onto the noodles.  Unlike other places, they bring the spoons and small empty dishes later, along with the meal.  My problem with that is that I cannot mix my dipping sauce while waiting for the rest of the stuff.  Also, they don't immediately bring out sprouts and greens and sliced peppers, which come out just before the pho.  I like using the sprouts to dip into the dipping bowl, kind of like you would do in a Mexican restaurant.  I know, it's just a whim of mine, but that's what I like to do.  Saigon 8 and Pho Little Saigon make it easy for me to do.",guP0iaS6scB_ONYC67fyYw,0,0,3,4oh_KQB-AxezUZb0TuYkAA

secondly, my soup had metal sponge parts in it.

you can't do that!!!

For being a new restaurant, I'm really impressed by the way they cared on how we found this place. I love pho and this is one of the best pho I've had. Give this place a chance! It's better than the place down the street... Pho Little Saigon---pho-get that place!",kPbWS9e85TdQ_YGoEucYFw,2,2,5,i3UEDe7MkIZFTyKmWDoDIw

We came here on a Monday afternoon. Hungover from a long night of drinking and living the Vegas life ;) 

When we arrived we were seated immediately. Which was good cause we were hungry and happy there wasn't a wait. However, the waiter was extremely slow. He took over 20 minutes to come back and take our orders. Another 15-20 minutes to bring us waters and any other beverages people may have ordered. Luckily the pho didn't take as long to come out after he put in our order. 

Overall: I wouldn't recommend or come back here. The service was horribly slow and the pho just tasted okay.",to5QXyxyI84QCR9JJMXrSw,7,2,2,V9UsEKVU7HcuJcVWdQeJ5g

My boyfriend decided to be adventurous and try the XXL pho...IT WAS HUUUGE!!!! He managed to finish it. I think we finally found a place where he can get full off of just pho haha. I don't remember if the price for that pho was listed on the menu, but in case you're curious: it came out to $15 or $16. 

JenniPho is a place that I will definitely be visiting again soon. Bonus points for them being open late to satisfy those early AM pho cravings.",wai1J7wtI5Wp0DUwy3QG2w,2,2,5,BQL7EfE7TJ1VzD1TfYIepw

Unfortunately I can't say the same about my food. I ordered the pho with steak and tripe. This is the only thing I get at Vietnamese restaurants. When it was brought out, it looked like it was going to be amazing. The bowl was huge. However one sip of the soup and I was greatly disappointed. It was unbelievably bland. A good broth is what makes a bowl of pho great since the noodle itself is typically flavorless.

Maybe I've been spoiled by all the delicious pho in San Gabriel Valley, but this was very underwhelming.

So here were the events leading up to this decision. 

It was a cold thursday night. I would say it was about 47 degrees with the wind blowing which made it even colder. So a hot bowl of pho would sure hit the spot. The wifey suggested our usual pho place. I wanted to be adventurous and try this new place based on the 4 star average. So off we went.

We come in and are greeted warmly. We sit down to a really nice glass table with what looks like seashells. I look around to see some nice chandeliers. I must say the decor is very nice. But just like any other relationship, once you get to know the person, you find out they are not who you thought they were.

So comes the unpleasantries. 

First off, I think they had the thermostat set to 70 degrees. BELOW ZERO. At first I thought it was just me. But after I looked around, I noticed everybody else in the restaurant had their jackets on. First strike.

I order their namesake, which is your standard combination. Came out at a decent time. Nothing out of the ordinary. If anything, it was a LITTLE MORE GREASY than I wanted. Second strike.

So we finish our our soups and ask for the check. We ordered two of the same soup at 7.99 a pop. So the total was 17 and some change. As I pull out my debit card, our server tells us that there is a 20 DOLLAR MINIMUM TO USE PLASTIC. Say what? You would think that they would at least have an ATM there but no. Even if they did have one you would still have to pay a convenience fee to withdraw cash along with whatever your financial institution might charge you on top of that. Third stirke.

So to make up the difference, we decided to get a milk tea with boba for 2.99 to push the total over 20. We get our drink. I take a sip. THE BOBA WAS HARD. For those that are not familiar with boba drinks, the boba is supposed to be soft and chewy. That was the fourth strike.

Now if this was baseball, they would of struck out plus an extra strike, unless they were bowling, in which case you would have 6 more frames. Originally I wanted to give them only 1 star, but the service and the decor were decent so I was gonna give them the benefit of the doubt meaning I am willing to give them another try at a future date. I will update this review accordingly based off of that.

So Jenni, we just need some time apart. This relationship looks like its not going anywhere except straight to this review. Maybe next time I see you things will be much better. Until then, I wish you luck.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,19,7,2,MQ434mc1QAO5NLZGuXSCQg

This is expected when a restaurant is busy, but there was only 2 other parties dining (one being a two-top) and workers just gathered to talk stories. 

   After we ate, my friend wanted to order Boba to go.  We waited another 10 minutes before my friend decided she was going to have to wave someone down again.  She got someones attention, but instead of coming up to help us, he yelled across the room and said: ""Can I get you anything else?""

Considering that it's Jenni Pho and not some regular joe shmoe pho restaurant in Chinatown, I went in with soaring expectations. It was a mediocre meal with decent service so it's not bad by any means, but I was slightly disappointed.

First off, there are still NO CREDIT/DEBIT CARD TRANSACTIONS. I just don't like to carry cash and rarely have 'em on me. Jenni Pho, why do you always make me take a trip to a Bank of America to take a withdrawal of $40 bucks after a meal? Until these slowpokes update their system, take some cash with you.

Secondly, the service is not lightning-fast which many pho eaters may be accustomed to with other venues. You have to ask for extra napkins because there's no dispenser on the table and they only give you two napkins for each person to start with. The tables in the middle are terribly small and it's a joke that there's four chairs around them because it was crammed like a tuna can with three people.

The pho is pretty oily. The one reason why I liked the Jenni Pho on Rainbow is because their broth is usually very clean and less oily. The pho at this location just tasted very thick and saturated with unnecessary flavor.

Overall, it was a pretty mediocre meal. I know they will get better with time because it's new. I'm sure Jenni or whoever is in charge will straighten things out eventually. HEY JENNI, UPDATE YOUR SYSTEMS TO ACCEPT DEBIT CARDS, OK?!! Geez.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,2,2,3,Vs1_f6rP_q5YvntBDFgAPA

Am I a pho expert, absolutely not.  However I have eaten enough to know good vs bad.  Jenni pho has very good pho in my humble estimation.

Was in Vegas for my son's 21st birthday, and he had never experienced pho before and I figured he needed to pop his pho cherry.  Saw a billboard for jenni pho and decided to give this place a try.

Waiter and I figured the flank steak was a pretty safe bet for a first timer and I went with the seafood. Also got the spring rolls as an appetizer.  Standard spring rolls, good, not the best or worst. As for the pho, first of all, it comes out HOT, hotter than others I've tried.  Gentleman who works there explained that they heat the bowls just before they put the broth in, so that makes it extra hot.  (noticed other patrons eating it right away, but we opted to let it cool a bit)  The broth was above average to me, very flavorful, not bland by any stretch of the imagination.  The meat in my son's was very tasty, cooked just right.  My seafood had fish, shrimp, and squid.  The fish was awesome, shrimp was good, squid was not the best.  (note, my favorite seafood pho in Houston has scallops, so I measure against that).  What sets the pho from jenni apart from the rest is the amount and quality of noodles.  Many times I have pho and find myself wishing for more noodles.  Jenni's had the most noodles I have ever had in pho.  To me, that made it a heartier, more filling dish.  So filling in fact, that we couldn't finish our bowls.  Very good value and very tasty.

So why choose jenni pho over others?  Service!!!  Granted, we went very late at night, so they weren't really busy, but it was by far the BEST, friendliest service I have ever experienced in any place that serves pho.  Everyone there was super nice, helpful, and friendly.

Unfortunately for Jenni here, her broth was surprisingly bland, the noodles were average, and they skimped out on the meat.  I had to load up the pho with sriracha to compensate for the flavorless broth. The rare beef in the pho seemed to be low quality luncheon meat, and they didn't even add much in.

Although the others may seem more popular, I think Jenni Pho is one of the better ones.  First of all, the owner is super clever with the name.  Already kudos for that.  Second, even if you are hung over or drunk, you can't deny that this place is cleaner than the other pho restaurant around the area. May not be a huge priority when you are trying to get that oh so yummy beef broth in you mouth and into your belly but better be safe than sorry.  Jenni Pho's pho is actually pretty good. It has the usual Vegas prices so you at least you aren't paying a premium in comparison.  Also the broth is pretty legit with the right amount of spices and herbs. The soup comes out hot, which is always a must when you get pho.  Next the meat to noodle ratio is pretty good. You aren't feeling like you paid $10 for a bowl of pho khong (pho noodle soup). You actually get some meat! Not too hungry, look for a super size bowl and sharesies with you and a friend.

All in all, Jenni Pho hits the spot when you are looking for some good noodle soup. The place is clean, the parking is simple, the location is prime and literally blocks away from the other pho places. Why go somewhere else and wait then you can come here and be seated immediately and get the same quality (if not better) of food.  Also, if you aren't in the mood for pho, they also have vermicelli, rice plates, other noodle soup dishes such as bun bo hue or bun rieu, or bun rieu oc.",Vi_qBZBXgkNbsO1qXXkoVw,4,4,4,bBjEyU8fAcuUeQayZvG72g

We were there on a Tuesday night right before opening, got there after class so around 4:20, no one was really around, but by the time they opened at 5 there was a line leading to the parking lot. And when we left the parking lot was full and still a long line out. Everyone loves free food! 

I had the Bun Bo Hue, it was pretty decent. It wasn't really spicy at all. It contained a lot of pork meat which was okay as well. My mom would say the meat ""smelled"" as she is picky with meats it definitely smelled like eating a pig. My friend and I ordered the same dish, the meat in his dish was smaller than mine, and since I don't really eat pork, I gave him mine, which was when he commented that mine was larger. 

Second time I went was for lunch special, had the Pho Dac Biet, which was also pretty good. It wasn't anything special that stood out. Both times the portion size seemed smaller than it was at Pho So 1 or any other locations I've been at, but it might have been because of the promotion they were giving out. So the sizes might have gotten bigger. It was free food so it was worth trying, I'll probably go again to make final conclusions if I'd go again or not. 

The thai tea everyone got came out pretty fast, but it wasn't strong. All the foods came out pretty fast, but I'm sure they had it ready as there was a very long line and with certain specials being free, I didn't think anyone would really stray from the 'free' menu too much.",dM1HHK4szA5Qs6NSAaEk1Q,0,0,3,Y9kXVHxp7eeBw3Itn6_0qQ

I had the jennipho which i assume is there signature dish it being number one on the menu and named after their restaurant. The presentation was great. When i had the broth it was not as i expected it wasnt bad but i expected more complex, stronger flavors.

The seafood pho was slightly better. I seasoned with chili sauce and Sriracha and bam. But i dont like adding anything to broth to enhance flavor.

There were a lot of ingredients inside such as pigs blood and pork hock.  It was flavourful and the noodles cooked al dente.  Wasn't sure what was in the green dessert, but it was okay.

When the hell did have less of something cost more...OK on that portion it said in small as print that no ice is 50 cent extra so OK our mistake...but still that is really terrible how she didn't give us that kind of courtesy to let us know...another thing was that they charged us 15 % gratuity on our meal and she asked his if I wanted to put my tip on the card...they already charged me and she did not mention that smit was already on the bill she just wanted me to tip her more lol for what bringing my order wrong and coming by what never to check to see if we needed anything?

3540184,2015-05-26,1,I6qFvR-jVDGqDD_iVG38ng,"Oh man this is going to be a long review so if you want the gist, god awful, do not go. I was so dissapointed with everything that once I got home I had to write a review.  First of All I am Vietnamese and Pho is such a soulful dish, the pho I had today was the worst thing ever.  My parents came to visit with my sister and a friend, and after a long day we wanted to finish with a hot bowl of pho.  I have seen this place, I have even walked by it when I ate at Sura.  There was a smell so tantalizing that I had to go and try it. I thought it would be a good idea to try Jenni Pho Grill tonight.

We walk in saw that the place was not too busy maybe about 7 tables.  We got seated fairly quickly.  Our server was pretty nice, my parents attempted to order in vietnamese but the server informed us that he did not speak it.  Cool cool, no big deal, he seemed like a nice kid.  After that it went downhill from there.  We ordered three bowls of the Pho Dac biet, and two orders of the pho tai.  We finished our order with two thai teas, the jenni jelly drink, and two waters.  

My family waited around, no waters, no drinks nothing.  We watched three tables get seated order their food and get their food before we even had anything on our table!  after a 25 min wait, our waiter finally comes back with two waters.  We asked why the service was so slow, he stated that there was only two waiters and said sorry.  So it was fine for now.  After we got the water nothing else came to us.  We watched as the tables that came in after us eat, and one even finished before we were served.  After another 35 minutes, our food finally came out.  First the two dac biet bowls, then the last three.  Finally the drinks came out as well.  I have worked at a boba place before, making thai teas should not take a hour.  For waiting for so long I was really anticipating for a great bowl of pho.  Oh man was I wrong.  The broth was lukewarm, it could not even finish cooking my meat.  The broth tasty funky as if it was made with a pre made powder.  My parents and I watched a one cook was constantly tasting the broth, and we saw no bones that make a great broth.  The bowl was mostly disappointing broth.  There were very little meat and noodles.  We ate, and we wanted to get out as soon as possible.  We asked for a to go cup for the thai tea because it took so long we were just going to take it home.  It took almost another five minutes just to get a plastic cup.  

In the end it was just terrible.  My family and I went home unhappy.  And the thing is I love food, I work in the industry so I timing is very important.  Having only two servers is rough but it can not be the only excuse.  If there was something wrong or if it was going to take a little longer, they should inform the customers.  The worst part was watching tables come in before us and eat before we got anything.  I am never going back.  I really hope they clean up their act, there are a lot of pho places out here and if they don't fix things it will be buried beneath the rest.",R38mW_Uyp46JHToxobXQXg,2,0,1,mbVzxuQTLRPbK-RwoGJsbA

Third and last strike: when the cashier girl(who was also eating during her work) told us that there's a minimum of $20 for using the credit card. Again, are you serious.. Most of the places are set to $10.. Why be greedy and add extra $10 into their minimum credit card charge amount?

I went here with my fiancee just for a quick lunch. I had the pho tai and she had bun cha. (Bun cha is rice vermicelli with fried spring rolls usually accompanied by seasoned fish sauce in case you are wondering.) Now going to Jenni Pho, Pho being the namesake of the restaurant, you think you would get something that is standard or above par. Not so much. Like opening a can of peanuts and getting snakes instead, I was quickly disappointed and surprised at how disappointing it was. The broth was weak and I felt I could have done better with a packet of ramen. The noodles were alright and the beef was eh. My fiancee's dish didn't far any better. Her vermicelli was cold. Not cold as in it was hot in the window and probably got cold after waiting for a little bit. No. It was cold as in grabbing it from a lowboy cold. The spring rolls were also mediocre at best. Service was not bad and seemed apologetic for the most part. The floors were a little messy and the restaurant having not been busy when we were there, I can only say probably due to laziness.

Jenni Pho's isn't the best in town, but it's good enough. And they do give a generous amount of meat, which I appreciate quite a bit.

So I'd probably give them an A-OK Yelp rating. I'm adding an extra star for their delicious Jenni Pho Dessert drink. We took advantage of the buy-two-get-one-free offer.

The portions are large, if you need a lot to get full it works. Service is lacking, I saw other tables look around for a server so they could order, it took us a while to wave down someone to ask for extra soup... which seemed to confuse the waitress so she asked our original male server to come back and confirm that we wanted extra soup... he said OK. Near the end of the meal it finally came, we thought they forgot about it and didn't feel like asking again. But load and behold when we got our bill they charged us for the extra soup, if you were going to do that you should of told us. Then we can decide if its worth the charge... and you still brought it at the very end when honestly we didn't even care for it anymore. The food was just OK, nothing great. I doubt we will be back again, there are a lot of better restaurants in the area with better service and less MSG.

The broth was brown, never in my life have I seen such dark pho broth. I asked our server and he said reason for that is ""beef broth"". My boyfriend is 100% Vietnamese and he's the reason I have a love for Vietnamese food. We travel to Orange County every week and you best believe I don't leave until I get my $3/bowl of pho! Another thing is the cost!!! $9 for a bowl is ridiculous. I told my friends in Orange County of the ridiculous cost for pho, all of their families are now in debate on opening a pho restaurant. $9 for pho=gold mine!!!

I tried a chicken vermicelli bowl and  pork/shimp broken rice plate. My friend got pho with beef. Aside from the spring roll appetizer which was ok, everything else was so bad it was almost inedible.

The chicken on top of my vermicelli bowl tasted like it had spoiled. I took one bite and had to spit it out.

On to the broken rice plate. This dish wasn't scary bad like the chicken vermicelli, but it wasn't good either. The pork was not trimmed, large pieces of fat hanging off it. Flavors were bland, boring.

I didn't try the pho but my friend said it was way too salty and had so much grease in the broth that she couldn't eat it.

We sent back all three dishes (something I almost never do) and kindly told our waiter what we didn't like about them, including that the chicken tasted like it had spoiled. We were quickly served our bill without any adjustments.

I understand mistakes can happen, everyone deserves a second chance. When it's brought to a restaurants attention that they may be serving spoiled meat and they do nothing about it... well I'm sorry but I'll definitely not be eating there again.",5rL-YgU3CXHbQA3Txzdd9g,1,2,1,nipf_eK6UJuYsDTrb_xIfQ

I enjoy their pho and I love the stuff they have on the table! a few things I enjoy in my pho are chili oil and pickled jalapenos, and this place is one of the very few that have it! I'm afraid that's it though.. although the food is good, the service is just.. absent. I once went there and the servers kept walking by us, not bothering to check on us. after trying to get someone's attention and being ignored for about 15 mins, (the place was empty! there was only one other man eating there!) my uncle went up to the front desk to ask for assistance. even after that, it took about maybe another 5 mins before someone actually paid any attention to us. we ordered, then my uncle's pho came relatively quick. I ordered pho too, but for some reason it took longer. I eventually received my pho. my uncle asked for a side of onions, but felt like no one remembered, so asked again. not only did they bring the onions when we were already done eating, (the place was still empty! I don't understand how not one person was assisting/serving us!) but they also charged my uncle for the onions that he didn't even end up eating.. 
my friend told me she goes at night all the time and their service isn't bad, so maybe just don't eat here during the day time, unless you don't care about customer service..",mlJlcQ36kcyBAVWLY3FMpg,0,0,3,FNFB__xk86zbSSOBtIeUag

5468711,2016-07-05,0,I6qFvR-jVDGqDD_iVG38ng,"A few nights ago my friend and I came in during a power outage sometime around 11pm. Both of us only had card and since the power was out on the whole block, we obviously weren't going to be able to use an ATM. I asked the waiter, who was standing by the door at the time, if they were still open and if we could pay with card. He said yes that they could only make the pho and were still accepting cards. So my friend and I order one chicken pho each, that were going to be paid for separately. (Btw the power was out our whole meal, but thanks for still serving us) After our meals they asked us to come to the counter so we could pay with our cards. The waiter then took down my friend's and I card information on slips (because again, we were paying separately) and when they took it down, they wrote down the expiration date, security codes, everything. He then said that it was going to be charged later when everything is back to working. Well, that would've been nice to know before our meal as having all my card info just written down isn't something I'd like to think about. Basically I didn't see the charge for a day or two, and when it finally showed up in my bank account today I was charged $20.09 when I only ordered one pho. I called to find out why I was charged double, and talked to the manager who said that what had happened was that an employee lost the slip with my friend's card info and charged both pho's to my card. She then told me ""my friend owed me $10."" I mean I don't mind paying for my friend's pho. But still I don't think this was handled very well as now all of her card info is just around somewhere and I wasn't told I was going to be charged $20. Anyways, I'm very unhappy with how the manager handled this situation and the fact that they lost her card info and didn't take responsibility for it.

My family also ordered the special Jenni drink which is buy 2 get 1 free ... so after they brought us the coke I asked how about the 3 Jenni drinks we ordered when we got here ?  He goes and checks and comes back and tells me they are all out.  It would've been nice for someone to tell us instead of just sitting here waiting for it.

Literally the only time we saw the servers is when we ordered the food and then when they served it to us.  If you want a refill on your drinks or napkins or anything else you better flag someone down because they sure aren't the ones that are going to be checking on you.

The decor is nice, bright and clean and I like the open view kitchen so that you can see the cooks moving about while making every ones food. 

I was in the mood for something with shrimp in it and for Pho there were only two options for seafood. They had the seafood Pho which had, shrimp, scallops and imitation crab or Tom Pho which is what I ordered that only had shrimp.

The Pho noodles and the broth were good however my little shrimps had been cooked to death, overcooked then filled in a bowl with boiling hot water just killed it as those shrimps never had a chance to be good. That is a pet peeve of mine, over cooked seafood is a deal breaker and will ruin a meal as shrimp should not be hard as a rock and chewy. I do not suggest ordering the Tom Pho.

I did like the fresh spring rolls with the peanut dipping sauce and my lychee flavored iced tea was a winner.

If you do not see a combination that is listed you do have the option to create your own up to three meats.

There is no ATM in this restaurant, they refer you across the street of crazy busy spring mountain to a Wells Fargo bank ATM. I have no idea why previous reviews state there is an ATM located inside of the restaurant when there is not. 

Also no credit card transactions are accepted for less than 20.00 so it made it sort of complicated for us going dutch.",deL6e_z9xqZTIODKqnvRXQ,6,7,3,T8pXGBpCGQPMknYKygtoUg
