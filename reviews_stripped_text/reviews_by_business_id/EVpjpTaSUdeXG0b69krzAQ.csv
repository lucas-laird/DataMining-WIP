I have been here several times now and the staff are very friendly and very prompt. Not too far from the highway and the local residential areas.

The other subways in the area could take notes from this owner they definitely know how to run a good ship. I know the sandwich market is competitive but they are off to a good start and I recommend any subway lover stop by for a visit.

As an added bonus they have a VIP member card but they stamp after every Sandwich. My only request for them is that they continue to take time with each customer and not to rush through every order like the other shops do",EXx__0SOew8Is7CpFZ8DLA,1,1,5,dkZn7mKOnRa88taoM4yDlQ

Staff is very nice and the was not that busy. The place had nice tv and is really modern looking inside.
I have never seen one nearly as nice. They have a vip card as well so make sure to get one.

I can t remember any other subways offering that
VIP card, just a nice place for a healthy alternative to the regular fast food restaurant.",Fv0aM7cvx0jD4ekkl2QTuw,0,0,5,OCSWdzsPbgQQp1YgjnlPPQ

3766943,2017-10-28,0,EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,"Alright I'm  giving Jonathan five stars.  (Hope I spelled his name right,  probably not) sorry.  He made my sandwich exactly how I requested. I told him I was a chef and asked him to change his gloves,  he did.  I asked him to change the lettuce cause it was old and discolored,  he did.  He was super perfessional , polite, and friendly.  I don't usually even eat out especially subway but sometimes you just have a craving.  The worst part was they don't allow you to tip on your debit card.  I had no cash and wanted to tip him, but it wouldn't let me even sign.  It sucks when I can't tip someone who truly deserves it.   It was great service,  the sandwich was made perfect (I even rang the bell) and it tasted great.  Hopefully  jonathan will get something out of this cause he deserves it.

3887198,2015-04-29,0,EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,Out of all the subways I've been to in Las Vegas this has to be the nicest one. It's hardly ever busy and the people who make our sandwiches do it right.it's almost like walking into a Starbucks atmosphere they have lounge chairs and the environment is  very nice and Pleasant to eat inside of. It's a clean professional atmosphere with accessible parking.,Tup7BEHsdCoggPxvKJC13Q,0,0,5,Bv4hyMt7ByTk0HLgJN-qoQ

It was near the lunch rush, but wasn't busy at all. The woman working quickly greeted me, prepared my sandwich, and cashed me out. She wasn't overly friendly, but she was quick. My sandwich was consistent with the brand.",3nIuSCZk5f_2WWYMLN7h3w,3,0,3,s3sRSWjA4qRXDTUpInN2Rw

As soon as we walk in the guy, armondo; tells us that the option to use the toaster is unavailable. I ask why. He says because he likes to clean it at night. Ummmm... What? It's a 24 hour subway.. I def come here for a toasted sub. But I can't have one bc you like to clean the toaster at night? Whack. Don't come here. Thanks ""armondo"" btw 400 degrees in my oven for 20 secs doesn't work you jackass. Cheers.",cpsU24Lroi4i-6PeDp2rKg,0,0,1,jbS6D02olneze8lT35rEXA

I really like subway soup, and sometimes in other locations when they are out of it they don't make any more. Here they are always willing to do it, and don't make you feel uncomfortable about it. This is my first choice for Subway.",_kDvNx3EpWaalOuOt4ed0A,0,0,5,x1TijCfIfJkn0TDRKbrHQQ
4853423,2016-03-20,0,EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,"Stopped here while I was driving home. I ordered the meatball marinara sub on whole wheat. The meatball marinara was the same as any other subway place I have been too so it didn't disappoint. The sub wasn't too toasted either. However, I did want an order of chicken noodle soup but they were all out so I had to settle for broccoli and cheese soup. The soup was okay. It was a bit too creamy for me.",S0qvyDeY7HP7MKaxneLRpA,0,0,4,fM_jzeU8ahiSk6_5cUyGQw
4892403,2017-06-09,0,EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,"Holy wow I am blown away. So I order subway all of the time, probably too much. I have never had a sandwich this good. I ordered a standard turkey sandwich with veggies and got it panini grilled. When Ivan hands me the sandwich it is this beautiful crispy brown sandwich with everything perfectly in place and nothing falling out. Keep in mind there was a LOT of veggies in the sandwich and usually when I get it panini grilled at other subways it falls apart. This wasn't the case with Ivan the panini master. The bread was perfectly toasty and I could go on and on about how satisfied I am. All I'm trying to say here is Ivan is the best and my sandwich was awesome.",RekZuJgKrbpoXW0TyDyVLQ,0,0,5,r7WBuqihNhw-8-uT-unYYA
4899066,2016-01-17,0,EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,I feel bad writing a negative review but the employee who made my sandwiches I had to correct almost every time he went to get something . He'd ask what cheese and I'd say what I wanted and he would reach for the total opposite cheese and I'd say no I actually wanted Swiss . I was trying to be a nice a possible but after the 4th time I was about to walk out and go to another place for lunch . There was no language issue and I wasn't speaking softly so I'm not sure what the issue is . Hopefully next time it will be better,CvwJnFmJ5NMidSAXHc118Q,0,0,2,5Wwf7SvMSDEzQZ1e9GSkyQ
5103402,2015-08-09,1,EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,"I stopped by for a large drink since my pups were not finished being groomed. The store is very well maintained and the workers are very friendly. 

The drink station is kept clean and does not have any drink splatter marks or drops. The workers come out every 10minutes or so to ensure all the chairs and tables are clean. Best subway location I have been to. 

Love the tea station!",EtaJMHr1Df_8B9ODxhqhvQ,0,1,5,CYZuaEZ5bz0Xvwi1tF384A

At the end, we ordered 3 foot longs, 3 drinks, and chips.  The same guy that made our subs had to ask me what we ordered!  HUH?  What just happened?  Anyway, subway subs are tasty fresh, but this location has to go if they have people like that working there.  Ill still hit up other subways, just not this one.",aL9HhoLSzv8O1pUwQ44UmQ,1,0,2,U1Qi88Beht0UiEDFsJrrww
5917636,2018-01-25,0,EVpjpTaSUdeXG0b69krzAQ,I love subway and it's usually pretty cool but this time I felt kind of off. That guy Armondo or whatever yelled at his employee when he didn't even seem to have done anything wrong. I just felt as if it was very unprofessional of him to do so. The sandwiches taste good tho! I hate that what could've been a great meal was only okay due to this bully. Julian was nice. Will return to subway again but most likely not this one,Xfza0iFwJQEC8ECWpj-RqQ,0,0,1,cCTPC6fep7COMOITev1trw
