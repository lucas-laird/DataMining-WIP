A good balance of ingredients. Nothing over powered anything else and it all worked very well together. I am looking forward to trying the sliders that were offered the next time I eat here. The fact that they have 6 different sauces to mix and match with the meat options makes this a place to go back to.

1847529,2017-02-01,0,tv-WIUQifcp5J9pUKoiE3Q,"It was the last day of my cousin's bachelorette weekend. Monday November 21, 2016. We just dropped off some friends at the airport and wanted to get a bite before our 6-hour drive back home. I looked this place up and it was exactly what I was craving. So we went to find it and of course there was nothing there.  

I decide to call the number from yelp and the guy answered saying they were closed. It was 12pm on a Monday. First I said ""Oh you're closed? But on Yelp it says you are open. Did your hours change?"" He answered in a rude tone ""we open Mondays from 11-10pm."" I'm thinking am I wrong? Isn't it 12pm?! So I replied ""but it's 12 on a Monday so shouldn't you be open?"" He then said well I closed up early because I was having some issues. (Again in a rude tone.) 

So I said ok and hung up. I was so upset! Also because I was hungry and finally got my heart set on that place and drove around looking for it and they way he spoke to me like I'm stupid and didn't know the hours he was open. Also it would've been appreciated if he had just apologized and said something came up and he closed it down. Then fine I understand things happen but if you're going to just state your hours to me when I ask if you're open (which you should have been open) in a rude tone then you deserve this horrible review. 

I will never try or recommend this place because of my bad experience with this guy. 

Horrible customer service. 


REPLY TO CHRISTIAN G OF DRAGON GRILLE: 1/31/2017
I checked in before we found the truck (which we never did) because I wanted to get the 20% and have it ready but since we never found you I had unchecked it. After I wrote this review I decided to check in to show we did in fact drive to this address listed on Yelp. 

Also, you advise to not rely on Yelp for business hours but I called your business phone number and someone from your business told me the SAME EXACT hours Yelp stated. It wasn't only the hours I was upset about it was the attitude and assumption that I didn't understand the hours of operation. You tell me you're open Mondays 11am but at the time it is 12pm? Does that make sense? You say you as business owners don't have time to update hours on websites but obviously you had time to reply to my so-called fake review but still did not update your hours. 

Your website says you open @ 12 on weekdays but I was there at 12. It's not just the time but the rude person who answered the phone and his tone while answering a customer's question. Even your tone is horrible. I clearly said I did not try your food. This review is based on your horrible customer service and accuracy of business hours. 

I checked in because I was at the address provided and you were not.",epM-xFb_jMnKAC-hkFjXlQ,0,0,1,8MyDkdeR_3rKBTYiyuc-Bw

Upon walking about to the stand, The gal working erased the pork off of the board of available meats. She said they had just ran out. Darn. So my choices were the shredded beef and the chicken. The gal suggested that I do a combo of the two since I wasn't able to make up my mind. As for the sauces, they have 5 different kinds - ones I remember were the Korean Galbique, Hawaiian Shoyu and the Asian Sweet Chili.

DG gal said that the Korean galbique was the most popular and her hubby's fave. Since I'm Korean, I opted for something else, so I got the Asian Sweet Chili. Creamy with a tad hint of sweetness - delish! I did crave some heat and thank goodness that they had pre-packaged sriracha sauces! The small bowl is $6 and the large is $8 for meat with your chosen sauce over white rice. Adding veggies is $1. Canned soda is also $1.

I paid via credit card. They had an iPad that took payments. They can either print your receipt, email or text it. I thought that was kind of cool. Never had my receipt texted to me before!

I was completely satisfied with my small bowl. I can't wait to go back and get me some more. Just wish they'd regularly come to Mountain View even after the cafeteria re-opens again!",1EvZSNmhYmyPIElblCeMdA,0,3,4,5uVPxYSRSACEguhAh2P-7Q

Dragon Grille is an Asian Fusion food truck that's been around for quite a while. Considering how often I seem to visit food trucks, I've been a bit slow to try some of the longer-tenured Las Vegas trucks. Well, here's a checkmark for a four-year veteran.

The main focus of reviews amongst my Yelp friends seems to be the Dragon Fries ($8), so I went for those. They were quite addictive from the first bite, with satisfying greasy fries that only lost a little crunch under the pile of wet toppings. The delicious, mayo-based sauce was the dominant flavor. There was a reasonable amount of tender shredded beef, but it really could've been any meat in there and I wouldn't have really noticed one way or the other. That's the only flaw in this otherwise very satisfying dish.

I'll consider trying more items Dragon Grille in the coming weeks. They're not quite as memorable as some of my favorite recent local food truck experiences, but they're definitely worth checking out.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,6,4,y_i0_rTuadCfec_7-5FmIQ

The philly cheese steak was a shocking let down.  IT'S TINY a 4"" roll (not a big sub sandwich like the picture) with hardly any meat.  The street tacos also had hardly any meat.

It was clear after a bite of each that their strategy is to charge double and give you half as much.  It was also clear that they simply cover all their dishes with a bunch of sauce so why even advertise Kobe beef or Korean BBQ when it all tasks like sauce.

I will go to ANY sub sandwich shop/chain, pay less and get more meat and more sandwich than purchase from this food truck ever again.

The Dragon Grille was chosen as the 2015 Best Food Truck by the Las Vegas Review Journal, so naturally I had to seek them out. They are known for serving modern Asian Fusion cuisine.

I ordered one of the most requested items the Dragon Fries!!! 
It's a monster of dish and equally as delicious, it's beer battered dipped fries topped with a generous portion of Korean Beef Brisket, Balbi Q Sauce & Furikake. They also make a mean trio of bulgogi sliders. The price I paid was $7, very reasonable, I cannot wait to try the bulgogi cheesesteak sandwich next time.",bLExVDNKxXMjjZcx3YG36Q,2,2,5,QCwuji4ViHnS_rw9zoR0Rw

Christian helped us decide by allowing us to taste some of their made-from-scratch sauces before ordering. They ranged in spiciness levels and were flat out delicious.
I love the Asian fusion thing they've got going on, the truck was clean, staff was friendly and I will definitely try to catch up with them again.",4wpV4DZlNxQ2xG_O3Y9lSg,3,2,5,Dw5o_pwbTVOymoyphJhHbQ

I saw ""Korean BBQ"" on the menu, heck yeah! I should have known better. I got a small Korean BBQ Bowl which was a lot of food. I opened the lid of what looked like cat food. Yuck! If I could get past the appearance...ok, so, I tasted it. It was really salty and sweet - like I would need dialysis if I ate here regularly. And the rice...it was undercooked. If you're going to call yourself ""Dragon Grill"" at least cook the rice properly.

$8 worth of disappointment. See, if I had gotten the large bowl, that's even worse. Customer service is also lacking. The menu was minimal. I'll pass.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,6,2,W9xDmq5hfgUao8ikLZSeGg

Wish they were on the food truck app so I could find them all the time....I can't wait for special events :(  I would definitely eat here once a week. It's only been a day and I am DYING for their food....TAKE MY $!!!!! We want to try everything on the menu because we know we won't be disappointed!!!!

I was fortunate enough to enjoy Dragon Grille before they relocated their food truck to various business and events around Las Vegas. My words can only describe a TASTE of what Dragon Grille has to offer. With their various yumyum sauces (as I would like to call them) added to either chicken or beef you can be satisfied for hours. Soft, sticky, japanese, sushi-grade, white rice pillows your choice of pulled beef or chicken. You can add fresh, steamed veggies as well. It is your choice of six different sauces to drizzle or drench the already succulent meat in. Obviously, being asian myself, I add Sirracha as well as either the sweet chili or galibicue (dragon) sauce to my chicken dish. With a small bowl you can get away with spending only 7 dollars and waiting about 5 min for your food to be prepared. It doesn't get any better than that!",-IAoLIpqcuQrGY17z6wpKg,1,1,5,8qPrnUu7cxKgWZ_MDPaBww

No bowls, forks, chop sticks to worry about, lovely and personable ""hostess"" (Sandra?) to chat with while waiting - yumm on all accounts!  

I was visiting Vegas on business and could have eaten in any restaurant on an expense account, but chose Dragon Grille's tacos after ""experiencing"" Fremont Street's scene and seeing the truck down a side street.  In fact, I brought a business associate the next night and he was equally impressed with the burritos we ordered.  Great food, prices and people!  Look for them!

Actually, looking for them and checking out the tasty menu would be easier if they updated their website - hint, hint!  :-)

Delicious food. I had been craving their kalbi-Q sauce and shredded beef brisket ever since I first tried it at the Foodie Festival at Silverton Casino a few years back. Sooooo delicious. 

We ordered three servings of the fusion tacos with beef brisket and the Korean Kalbi-Q sauce, some Dragon Fries also with Korean Kalbi-Q, and the Sriracha Mac-n-Cheese.

The fusion tacos and Dragon Fries were simply amazing, tasted just as I had remembered. Don't bother getting the Sriracha Mac-n-Cheese, though, as it seems to be just normal Kraft Mac-n-Cheese with some parmesan cheese and sriracha on top.

Minus a star because the main chef seemed irritable with the lady taking orders, and annoyed with us for having to reiterate that we wanted it to-go, which I guess he didn't hear. 

Also there was literally no location mentioned here on yelp or online, I tried to call but no one answered. I had to find their facebook just to figure out where they were. PR people!",cN3O3npQUfpAyaw7rWl_uQ,2,0,4,UQ18s5OF1V3j7a85sUXCYA

The beef tacos to start there was not enough beef maybe I should have ordered a bowl because tortilla and rice. Uhhhmmmm maybe put cabbage or something else. I understand you're trying to do a fusion thing but yeah anyway. So the beef tacos 3 for $10 price not bad. Did fill me up. Quality and taste ehhhh. The chicken egg rolls. GREAT PRICE!!! Shitty taste. No taste and covered in sauce. Sad life. Well at least I tried it. Walked by it again today went to subway instead.,-pJjB1K1-rtxZBOu8n7OWA,0,0,2,8J1w-2EgBqEJJewM4vaCwg

I'd only go back to get the kobe beef sliders.",B1829_hxXSEpDPEDJtYeIw,1,1,4,2aDqUag5XK6EyNDnDtS72Q
