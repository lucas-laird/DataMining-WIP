24305,2016-10-17,0,N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg,Please be aware this is a take out joint with common tables shared with other take out places. We came for breakfast at 10 am their opening time. They did not have masala for the dosa nor several other items. Two employees had just opened the place. Not professionally run place. Took half an hour to get the food. The plain dosa by then was cold. Not a good experience altogether.,J_jP-R409YplWuEcGDs_mg,0,0,1,BElbhYDbYV6etizBC6JiFQ

For me personally - the indian tea , its not great but is better than dip dip tea with no taste, you get in other tea and coffee shops for double price.  

Most of the time I have only tea at this place which is also just okay. Its inconsistent and they don't keep brown sugar so I usually carry my own. 
I did try a few things here like masala dosa and papri chat. It feels like they server pre-made frozen stuff diluted as the species are less, salt is missing and everything is quiet tasteless. 
They used chole gravy instead of tamarind chutney in papri chat - who does that ? 
Dosa without salt, i had to use hot sauce to spice up otherwise it was unpalatable. 

I will still go back there for tea for lack of choice else where but i am done with eating any of their food.

This Indian food place located inside of the Venetian hotel, which is a very nice hotel. 

My husband ordered chicken curry for me one night and asked the cook to make the curry spicier. They did a good job . The curry was really tasty and the portion was fare for the price they charged. 

I went back the next day for dinner and i was very happy that I did not have to get in a car and drive for a good Indian food while in Vegas.",5kaQcIAP7zhfvF4_4Mu16w,0,1,4,7UFzKDbPAw5KvY23Cf1RFQ

The flavors were good but the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala weren't as ""smooth and creamy"" as I've had at most Indian restaurants.  Price was slightly higher than expected for a food court - but then again it is at the Venetian.  Not bad for a quick bite if you're in the mood for Indian and don't have much time.  Just temper expectations a bit. Probably better than most of the other restaurants in the food court, but still food court quality for sure.

We don't have a lot of experience with Indian food so can't speak to this restaurants authenticity. So we will judge by taste and value. Talking about value when you're in Vegas is an oxymoron. It's like finding a unicorn. Value wise this place is not. You don't get much food for what you pay. Taste wise the food was just mediocre.

5527621,2016-12-24,0,N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg,"I've never had Indian fast food before, but I'm guessing curry pot is a chain. Their menu is at least varied, with vegetarian and meat options for all. I ended up ordering the shahi paneer because I like a good paneer, although I have never had shahi before. 
It came out steaming in a small plastic container, so I could take it back to my place if I really wanted to. It was served with naan, a side of masala sprinkled vegetables, including onion, cucumber, and tomato, rice, and the curry. 
The rice was steaming. The naan was fresh. The vegetables confused me until I dipped a piece into the curry. Then I saw a huge flaw. 
The curry was cold. 
Not cold cold but room temperature. Eating the shahi paneer with naan and rice disguised it, but dipping in a piece of onion confirmed it. The curry was cold.

5601710,2016-12-06,5,N-L7ISdndWsIWdK0fn29wg,"The Grand Canal Shoppes food court is somewhat always in a state of flux. The No1DP and I visit the Shoppes at least ever year for the last four years (partly because we end up staying at the Palazzo for his conference) and while we can count on staples such as Johnny Rockets, Subway and Wasabi Jane there's always one or two new business that open up that replaced the businesses that closed. Curry Pot was a new addition for this year.

Their slogan is ""American made, authentically Indian"". While I haven't eaten at enough Indian restaurants to make informed decisions about its authenticity what the No1DP and I can tell you that this was one of the better Indian places we tried. No1DP's also picky about his Indian food as he can get a good plate back in Japan. He was initially hesitant about my choice because his stomach doesn't go well with bad Indian food but I had a good gut feel about this place. Considering the affluent environment of the Venetian|Palazzo complex it has to cater to a wide range of ethnicities. The menu options are more limited than traditional Indian curry houses but what's unique about this particular Indian joint is their limited South Indian options. Normally traditional curry houses are staffed by people from the northern part of India so you wouldn't see masala dosa served here.

CURRY POTS: Served with cumin-saffron basmati rice, naan bread, salad.
- Chicken Tikka Masala (Chicken, Creamy Tomato Sauce, Red Chili Paste, Herbs & Spices)
- Classic Chicken Curry (Chicken, Onion-Tomato Sauce, Ginger-Garlic Paste, Herbs & Spices, $12)

No1DP got the tikka masala while I got their classic curry chicken. As mentioned we enjoyed our plates because not only was it delicious but it was also one of the healthier options in the food court. We noted that the curries were at least moderately spicy (which we didn't mind as we're used to moderately spicy) - we didn't specify spice levels and we don't know whether this could be adjusted for people who can't tolerate spicy food. Portions were quite big for a curry dish as there was a generous amount of chicken and a good amount of sauce for the ""naan"". We could have ended up sharing a curry pot and it would've been adequate for lunch.

We did note a few concerns with our dishes:
- The ""naan"" that was served was actually pita cooked in the style of naan. Though it was still a good bread and went well with the curry sauce, the business does advertise themselves as ""authentically Indian"". I would think Indians would have an issue with this.
- The salad contains too much onions. Needs more greens. I didn't mind this as much as I love onions with my curry and it was sprinkled with cumin.
- The No1DP ate one of the peppers and it was enough for him to be bothered by it for at least 5 minutes. As he's somewhat lactose intolerant mango lassi was out of the question and had to get rid of the lingering spice with beer. Upon inspection I noticed there was quite a bit of green pepper seeds in the salad. Again I like my spice so this wasn't much of an issue but I don't know how a person with a lower tolerance of spice would handle it.

Even with mild concerns the No1DP and I would come back here for a quick lunch should we be in the area. Hopefully this place does well enough so we could come back here again next year. I was bummed that I couldn't go back to Anchor Bar (last year's food court lunch), so I hope tourists will be more open-minded to try food court Indian.",7gNtYzygF7dB8e7k1mWdjA,12,10,4,zCbb4T56BcxY8PMWqNgTpg
