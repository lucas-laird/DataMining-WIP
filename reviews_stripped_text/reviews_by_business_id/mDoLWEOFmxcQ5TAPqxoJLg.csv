3574,2015-06-11,0,mDoLWEOFmxcQ5TAPqxoJLg,I have sought out a good time countless times with Sagos many times over the years. It is a great place to hang out and throw a few back. They have a decent happy hour with appetizers and sliders for 5.00. The food started off awesome and then took a down turn. That kitchen crew has since been replaced and the food is back on par. I love the spicy pickles and the mac  and cheese bites. The drinks prices are decent but best during happy hour. The staff remembers your name and your drink. The owner will also show up and just sit and chat with you.  The bathrooms are always clean which o can appreciate. There is always a good time to be had at Sagos. You have to check it out at least once.,MSP8Ej3br9191YZUK-Zd8A,0,2,4,mQEH3y2Vbk33ICvk7azMPg

stopped in three times for their MNF special, sitting in the restaurant side.

780040,2014-01-17,0,mDoLWEOFmxcQ5TAPqxoJLg,"Been awhile since I've written a review and since that last review, have to say this is now one of my favorite ""locals"" places in town and it's time to give them some  well deserved love on Yelp. Loved the service the first time I walked in and keep going back on my home from the office.

Rachel & Rachel, Heather, Muoy, Austin and Aaron are all great bartenders and Gia is a great server...  Super nice and genuinely great people that will put a big smile on your face with their upbeat personalities. 

There are plenty of very cool regulars that go here consistently which should tell you a lot right there about the place. There is a reason why this place was named Best Locals bar by Seven Magazine last year.

This is truly a locals bar owned by a local and it's not uncommon to see Jason (the owner) there and is a super nice guy. As their motto goes, ""We take care of our players like Old Vegas used to"". For some of us that have been in Vegas since the 1990's... we certainly know what this means before everything got so corporate and neighborhood bars started nickel and diming everybody.

I'm not a big gambler and rarely play but they certainly take care of me and it's NOT one of those places that if you stick $20 bucks in, hit something and play it all back, you'll only get comped one drink. (Places like that annoy me.)

Happy Hour is 3 to 7 with $2 Domestic Draft pints and $5 Maker Marks. (Not entirely sure what other drink prices are.) Appetizers are $5 and WELL worth $5. $2 Coors Light Pints during Football games and it's a GREAT place to watch Games with big TV's right at the bar or a couple of huge ones in the back dining area. (If you love The Bears -- this is certainly a great place to go for Bears games.)

Even when it's not Happy Hour, I highly suggest the Street Tacos and as others have mentioned, the Nachos are divine.

$ for $, one of the best places in town that I've been to and I've been to a lot of places. Your mileage might vary but I can guarantee you if you are cool to the staff, you will certainly be taken care of.",OF9gus15zboR9d8Xb-C83w,1,1,5,E91TsixAow_MQ9SF8JnOpQ

1178036,2010-11-11,3,mDoLWEOFmxcQ5TAPqxoJLg,"I've been meaning to write this review from the moment I walked in that bar a few years ago...I was new to the south west area of town and generally I don't go into a bar unless I know someone that works there...I heard a thing or two about ""Sago's"" (it's said ""SAY-GOES"", for the record) from a few coworkers and figured I'd check the place out. 

I pulled into the very easily accessible parking lot, walked inside and grabbed a seat. I had never been there before so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. 

I walked in, grabbed a seat in the middle of the bar, and within a minute of me sitting down, one of the bartenders came over and greeted me right away, she introduced herself as Heather, and took my drink order. I put a $20 into the machine, and she then began telling me about all their wonderful gaming promotions they had going on. Generally, in Vegas, I've found that if you walk into a bar for the first time and aren't a regular, or aren't with a regular, you get the cold shoulder. That was not the case at all with Sagos. 

I was about halfway done with my first cocktail, and Heather asked if I wanted another one, then presented me with a food menu if I was hungry. I'll get into the menu and great food in a bit. The bar was pretty steady, and they had two bartenders on. I personally loved that because it seemed as though everyone was taken care of. As I was looking over the menu, the male bartender, came over, introduced himself as Aaron, and asked to take my food order. 

I wasn't sure what I wanted to eat...there is so much on the menu, wings, fingers, fries, quesadilla's, nachos, salads...tacos, burgers...pasta...sandwiches, wraps...so much to choose from...Aaron threw out a couple of suggestions, then I finally decided to order the ""Western Bacon Chipotle Cheese Burger"" He let me know the food is made to order, so it'd be about a 10-12 minute wait. He refilled my drink and wished me a little luck on my 4 card keno....before I knew it, the food was out and I was eating the best burger ever. Seriously...it's my absolute favorite. 

The burger was amazing...thick burger, with cheese, topped with a giant onion ring and Chipotle BBQ sauce.... 

Both Aaron and Heather came around a few times to refill my drink, make sure I was doing ok with the food and everything else. Things couldn't have been better....after a bit, it was time for me to venture home. 

Aaron and Heather did an excellent job of making me feel at home and just like a regular. Needless to say, I made Sago's the only bar I ever set foot into for the entire time I lived in the south west. I've since moved to Henderson, and seldom stop into Sago's, however when I do show up there, the service is as great as it was the first time I stopped in there. 

If you're looking for a place to go in the south west area of town, Sago's is definitely the spot.",EvcZUf-wwDs5dTda4Oi9oA,3,6,5,qAAyU-R-RxdL_GjTKG0JuQ

The first thing I noticed as I walked in was the poor air ventilation system. Guests cigarette smoke just hung like a cloud, never really dispersing. We put some money in the machines, and quickly realized how strangely the games were setup. The only game on .25c for keno was multicard. Classic keno, cleo, and 4 card were only available on .50c. And let me tell you...the TIGHTEST machines I've ever played. The bathroom was nice, the bartenders were friendly, and the food seemed to come out pretty quickly (didn't order any food myself).

The service? I have to rate as a 5/5--the waitresses here are super nice, attentive and thoughtful. They're also super speedy; one thing I noticed with bars and gastropubs with table service, they take FOREVER with their drinks, but Sago's is punctual. I ordered a Lemon Drop Martini and an extra spicy Bloody Mary, and both did not disappoint (perfect ratio.) As an appetizer, the table got the steak nachos. I don't know if I was just starving or they were really delicious nachos LOL, but either way, I was satisfied.

It's pretty loud here, with crazy sports fans and incredibly booming television sets, so keeping up a conversation with the table is pretty hard, but tolerable. ¯\_(?)_/¯ 

Good note to keep in mind though: HAPPY HOUR, DAILY 3PM-7PM AND Midnight-3AM. $5 appetizers and sliders/$2 well drinks and domestic drafts/$4 craft/ half off wine.

2140460,2014-07-11,1,mDoLWEOFmxcQ5TAPqxoJLg,"This place has one heck of a Happy Hour!!!! I still am amazed by the value/price. 
It is definitely a bar/restaurant for locals; you'd probably never have an occasion to visit otherwise. When we visited, it was pretty empty, just a few people sitting at the bar playing video poker. The decor is pretty dark, with huge tv screens on the walls.

Happy Hour- well cocktails- $2!  Beer and wines- $4! ALL appetizers and sliders- $5!! Truly incredible! The server was very friendly and attentive, and checked on us several times throughout our meal.

Now, the downside... The food. It wasn't spectacular. Average, at best. We ordered chips and salsa, the chicken quesadillias, sliders, and the coconut crab cakes.  On the positive side, the portions are very large, especially since they are only appetizers.  The crabcakes are more mango crabcakes than coconut (they are topped with a lot of mango), but they were pretty tasty overall and not overly breaded. The chips and salsa came with two sauces, a cheese sauce and a salsa. No complaints, but nothing to rave over. The quesadillias- eh... not fantastic. The chicken had an odd flavor, and there wasn't much cheese. The sliders were fine, but the accompanying fries tasted old.

However, for 3 mixed drinks, a bottle of beer, and 4 appetizers to total bill less than $30 (I'm still wondering if she gave us an extra discount).... I have NO complaints. If I'd paid regular/full price, though- I'd be a little unhappy.",lQGJcwX105k17081f6pulg,3,1,4,EzbRvzCbDA2Zf_dwfpKD-A

Their happy hour was perfect. From 3 - 7 they offered all appetizers and sliders for only $5! And they also had game day specials of $2 Coors Light and $3 Blue Moon. The jalapeno and cheese tamale bites were delicious and the chicken nachos were plentiful.

We sat in the booth which was super cute, and waited for someone to come and greet us.

The bartender came back with menus and our drinks really fast. The menu looks really good. All the food looked really good by the description. I ordered a burrito and my husband ordered a burger, although the bartender didn't know if the burrito came with a side and had to look at the menu to find out. The food came out and we were excited to eat. The burger wasn't bad but the burrito was horrible. The rice seemed like it came from a box and there was no chicken in the burrito, like I had ordered. I was very disappointed. When the bartender came and brought us our check she introduced herself and shook her hand. I would never go back to this place for food.

So all the appetizers are $5 (tax already included in that $5), $5 sliders, $2 wines and wells, and also the beers but I forgot how much. There is a lot of options on the appetizer menu. The ones that I always get...

Wings & Fries flavor that is bomb dot com is the Hotti Yakii. Which is like a teriyaki but with a kick. When my friend ordered it I wasn't going to try it because I'm not really a fan of teriyaki but first bite it was amazing. 

Crab cakes. By far my favorite appetizer. It's got some mango salsa on top that just elevates the dish even more. It comes with 3 crab patties which is perfect. You can tell it is made with real crabs and if it's not, you can't even tell! That's how bomb it is. 

Spring rolls. These are not your typical spring rolls. They are more like egg rolls, it has chicken in it. There's a sweet and sour sauce on top. Its really good. And it's a really big portion for the price point. 

One appetizer that I really wasn't a fan of but really was excited for was the Mac n Cheese bites. It was very cry not even cheesy and it came with ranch dip. Mac n Cheese and ranch do NOT go well together. 

The bartenders are awesome. They are very involved with the customers. You can tell there are regulars that come in because they the bartenders know by habit what they order. There are many TVs everywhere. If a game is not on the TV you can just tell them and they'll put it one.

Congrats to the bar and grill staff for showing such precedence. Just remember to pronounce the place correctly (say goes) and you'll fit right in. I believe it's been named after the wonderful everlasting sago palm also know as a wonderful house plant (cycads). Some people classify it is a cactus.

The pluses:  Good food    Cheap happy hour drink specials.   Cute, friendly waitresses  Ginormous big screen TVs in the east room   Good food specials.  Decent slot player incentive program.

In my initial review, I praised the amazing service and exceptionally friendly atmosphere of this hidden little gem on the western edge of town, but I also mentioned that the food was nothing to get excited about.

Well that has all changed with Sagos new menu. I have two words - GREAT JOB!

Moving the menu closer to the restaurants Baja theme, management has introduced a completely new menu filled with some great selections like fish and shrimp tacos, homemade pizza, a delicious chicken avocado sandwich, a new twist on the BLT with a tomato jelly that rocks and much more.

If you go, and you will, you have to try the Ceviche - cradled in what looked like a sea-shell shaped crisp flour tortilla, the taste is fabulous and the serving size to price ratio will fill you up but still make you want to order another.

Quick Review
+ Superior to food offered at 99% of neighbourhood pubs* (*British for bars)

+ Great location along CR-215, if you're a Las Vegan. No one else need apply.

-  Deserted: I really don't know how they stay in business. 

-----------------------------------------­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­-------------------

I won't be the first -- nor the last -- to come in here while it is relatively deserted. The staff is polite, kind, and personable. The food is figuratively solid (literally too) and the drinks, you will have to ascertain their value yourself since I don't drink and drive.  

Pro Tip: Get a burger, tacos, or whatever; but, don't drink and drive. 

Zero Fatalities is the objective, folks. Only you can prevent desert fires. 

I digress.

Tacos, good. Burgers, good. Service, very good. Overall: good.

The place doesn't look that spacious on the outside, but when you walk in, there's a bar area complete with tvs, as well as another room where there are projection screens and even more tables.  The tv setup at the bar has 3 flat screens on one side, and 3 flat screens on the other side.  In the other area with tables and projection screens, there are three flat screens framing each side of one o the projection screens, so that there are 6 tvs framing a single screen.  

After looking around, I ended up sitting in the bar area, since that's where all of the patrons were hanging out.  I debated about sitting at a table, but realized that I'd probably get faster service by sitting at the bar.  It seemed to be a pretty happening place for lunchtime--roughly 12 people and one friendly bartender.  The majority of the patrons were playing on the video poker/blackjack machines, drinking, smoking, or watching tv, while there was only one other person eating something. 

It took me a few minutes to figure out what to get, but I finally decided to go with the fish tacos.  They were three tiny ones, made of cod, with a salsa and other sauce drizzled on top, sitting on a bed of greens and flour tortillas.  Pretty tasty and the sauce wasn't too overpowering and they seemed to put just the right amount on the tacos.  Next time, though, I'm gonna have to get the steak or ceviche...decisions, decisions.  To be honest, for the prices that they offered and the selection/variety (given the type of establishment), I was pretty impressed.

I've yet to find a place that bears any resemblance to Cheers (""where everybody knows your name""), and this place seems to be it.  I think that I was one of two people that the bartender didn't know on a first-name basis.  There are quite a few regulars that come here, and I must say that if I find myself in the area again, I'm definitely willing to try out more of their menu.  

The only reason that I had to deduct a star was due to the service.  I would have given this place 3.5 stars, but unfortunately can't give a 1/2 star, so I rounded up.  Yes, I realize that I didn't walk into a restaurant (it's a bar/pub), but then again I do appreciate good service--not being ignored and attentiveness.",QiDtS54JwTGeH81c-a84WQ,2,0,4,FsapmorPZXQH9jsarEJC2w

The booths are covered in little tiki huts and very comfy -- a must if you plan on staying for the length of a game.  The service was fast and friendly.  Then the smoke set in.  Get mad all you want smokers, but I firmly believe you should be forced to smoke outside or shamed into quitting.  I don't care what you do to yourself, but I have never smoked.  That is MY right and I will not be made to marinate in a smoky haze while trying to enjoy a beer and some nachos.  I already have to endure a smoke-filled office during the day (thanks boss), and I refuse to deal with the same on my off time.  

Now that I am off my soap box, if not for the smoke, I would be a constant here.  The food was better than average for bar food, happy hour prices are very cheap, the girls who work here are very pretty and most guys dig that.  The food standouts were the crazy big nachos (although next time I would get the cheese sauce on the side because it was overwhelming) and the chicken tenders.  I think single guys would enjoy this place for the eye candy and single girls would enjoy this place for the dating opportunities.  Tons of big screens so you won't need to worry about missing the game.  Sadly, I will probably stay with BWW since it is smoke-free, but if you do not have the same concerns, I highy recommend this place.",rPRy7N3WCD3sVCrF60OOnA,4,3,4,-sAVtUC8T9PvyBWnmNVRNQ

The place was very smokey (its a bar), so be prepared to deal with that as it was very bad the evening i walked in. The staff i found to be very pleasant, lots of personality, and easy to talk to.

I wanted fish tacos and the reviews on here drew me in. We braved the potential noise and smoke so I could have fish tacos  (my boyfriend is the best!)

We sat in the dining room (all alone) and the waitress/bartender seemed confused as why we didn't want to sit in the bar area and a little put out, but we didn't dwell on it.

Well...in addition to the fish tacos (the menu said it came with only 2) we decided to get Carne Asada Nachos.

I barely remember the tacos.

The nachos stole the show. Wiped everything else about the place out of my memory.

Carne Asada, a spicy chipotle sauce, regular shredded cheese AND a nacho type cheese sauce.  All on one plate.  There were beans on the bottom, and some chips to work as cheese vessels into my mouth. I am normally not huge on verbal praise when eating out, as I am pretty shy.  The guy who brought out our food, was clearly the cook, so I was gushing over my nachos to him when he came to take the plate back.


Since I went for fish tacos, I should review them too  ;)

I was unaware they weren't fried fish tacos, which is what I prefer and really only order.
They were good, but I missed the crunch of fried.  There was also a lot of cilantro and onions, and even with scraping it off, I couldn't get the cilantro taste off.

-  
On another note, they don't have lemonade.  Which I find sad  :(

----

On another another note....
We went back a week later, because I was still unable to get carne asada nachos out of my head.  They were still delicious, but had been made by someone else, somehow they were not nearly as good.  i would get them a 4/5 on my second visit.  But the first visit, the nachos were a 10/5, so they are still great.   No idea who the master nacho maker is, but you want him to make them!",P8zNvht_iXkpkv74yrNUEA,5,3,5,6kE-V0rkISSoVGLaDnhbsw

had a few shots with her.....man I am getting too old to be having shots of all these flavored alcohols!.....think we had root beer vodka, a mountain dew flavored one, a fruit loops flavored one, and some Sambuca too
flad they had some nice boring coors light for me to wash all that down with!

We came to eat, but they took over the whole dining room, so it was the bar for us.  I didn't mind, except that there were only a few [high] tables and the chairs weren't high enough for short little me.

I'd glanced at the Yelp reviews before we left for the restaurant, and couldn't wait to see the ""gorgeous bartenders,"" as visions of Chippendale's danced in my brain.  Unfortunately, I didn't notice that the reviews were written by men, and the ""gorgeous bartenders were women!!  Oh, well.  For the record, they were indeed gorgeous, just not my type.

The menu's kind of limited - lots of appetizers, a few burgers and sandwiches, and only a few main courses.  Hubby ordered Skewered Chicken with Pineapple, and I had Shrimp Fajitas.  He was looking for his pineapple all through the meal, and waited until he was nearly done to ask about it.  Turns out it was a pineapple sauce, not the chunks he was expecting, but there wasn't much sauce.  He liked it anyway, but he's never met a chicken he didn't like; the man practically clucks.

My fajitas were terrific - I didn't count the shrimp, but there were a lot, together with mounds of onions and red pepper.  I was glad there was no green pepper, since I'm not a big lover of the green kind.  There were two things missing, and one was a big plus:  it was the rare meal that wasn't oversalted.  Big thumbs up for that!  The missing ingredient was some guacamole, and the dish definitely cried out for some of that.  

Despite the craziness of the partygoers in the dining room, who made their way over to the bar way too often, and the crowds of people assembled at the bar by the time we were ready to leave, the service was excellent.  The waitress apologized for being slow due to the unexpected crowd, but we thought she was just fine.  And my husband sure didn't mind having to stay longer and surreptitiously gawk at her (I didn't really blame him!).

Very few places in Vegas ever truly treat their customers like royalty like Sago's (pronounced SAY-goes). These are people who really care about us and treat you like family. They're good people. 

This is a great place to watch sports. They have this ENORMOUS 170"" HD TV and plenty of room in the dining area for a very, very large party. I should know, I have brought my Bears group here on many Sundays and we packed the place. I would call this place an ""unofficial Bears bar"" because after another Chicago themed establishment down the street went out of business last fall, a lot of Bears fans have been going here. 

The decor is not sports-themed, however. It doesn't need to be, either. (well I wouldn't mind seeing a Bears banner on the wall one day... just sayin'). It has a very cool tropical tiki bar theme, with palm trees and tiki huts. The service has improved a lot in the last 6 months. Their server Nikki is always a real pleasant, professional and fast waitress, my group really likes her. They just hired a new girl Gia and she is excellent as well. 

During football season I bring in a big group (20-30 people). The owner Jason always makes sure they reserve plenty of tables for my group & that we are accommodated. They even give me a microphone for calling out the raffle numbers mwaaa haaa haaaaaaa!! I have a microphone and you don't!!! ;)  

We had a little Super Bowl XX (that's right, 1986) viewing party yesterday and they not only put the game on the big screen, they even played the Super Bowl Shuffle video a couple times for us. These guys really went out of their way to make this a fun day for us and that is a reason for me to continue coming here. 

Did I mention the free touchdown shots every time the Bears score?? Awesome. 

I haven't even started talking about the food yet! Fellow Yelper Shana W. has it spot-on with regards to the nachos. I am the nacho queen, and am very serious about my nachos. Their nachos are out of this world. Fresh and very HOT jalapenos, shredded and nacho cheese sauce, black beans, pico de gallo and that chipotle cream sauce!! HOLY COW I want to go back and get some now. Whoever invented this creation is a nacho genius, don't change one thing with the nachos please!! 

I ordered fries with nacho sauce yesterday and it was very yummy. I inhaled it in 5 minutes. Fish tacos are good as well. I've tried other appetizers on the menu but those items are my fav. The only thing I wish they had was Chicago style pizza. Some of my friends also commented they wished they made Chicago style hot dogs here. 

They also throw a heck of a New Years Eve party - $50 guys, $20 ladies gets you open bar for 4 hours, free limo rides home and all. 

Be sure to give this place a try - the outside doesn't look like anything but a gaming bar, but it is much better than you might think. And they're just super nice people. I like supporting a local business when they treat you so well. DAAA BEARS",TOrRfYRFuxx0k9HH7OC6pQ,6,3,5,2PvITJUlz71x4OYZZChDiA

This place is the BOMB! We were looking for a spot to go watch Monday Night Football and a friend suggested Sagos for the all you can eat and drink special. Okay sign me up.

Here's the DEAL: 
$10 for Ladies: All you can eat Nachos, Chicken Wings, and Hot Dogs. All you can drink Smirnoff Vodka drinks.
$25 for Gentlemen: All you can eat Nachos, Chicken Wings, and Hot Dogs. All you can drink draft beer. 
You also get raffle tickets for halftime and game end drawings for t-shirts, hats, key chains, bar glasses, and shot glasses. 

The food is served fresh to you plate by plate throughout the night, NOT a buffet like I would have expected. The nachos come without meat and topped with pico, sour cream, and jalapenos and were pretty tasty! The chicken wings come in mild, medium, hot, teriyaki, and yoni kono. I tried the yoni kono and teriyaki with ranch and they were really good with lots of sauce and good quality chicken. 

The drinks were served in short glasses for the ladies the bartender has a decent pour! The service was excellent. The girls worked together and we never had an empty glass or plate of food. 

The bar has gaming and I wandered over to play some blackjack and started chatting with a gentleman that frequents Sagos and he said they take very good care of locals with comped food and premium drinks for players. Nice to know =) Again my glass continued to be filled with delicious red wine by the polite bartender. 

Oh and I won a cute tequila t-shirt and 2 shot glasses in the raffle! *BONUS*

And then there is the happy hour!!!!  The sliders are definitely the best in town, juicy and cheesy, and served up with a generous order of crispy hot skinny fries! 
You can almost feel the balmy ocean breeze as sip your perfectly made drink and relax in the tropical atmosphere!
This whole experience is made even better when you pay the tab......... And it is hardly anything!!!!!
Cheaper than McDonalds!!!!!!
Cheers for SAGO'S!!!!!!!!

(Pro-tip: Everyone really knows everyone in the small town that is Vegas.) It's a huge space, ample seating, and serves typical bar fare. Wings, nachos, burgers, and sandwiches.

There a huge happy hour with all sorts of food and drink specials. The bar has a slew of regulars and it's a warm friendly atmosphere.

There really isn't anything too special about it. It's a watering hole, with a large dining area, they allow smoking indoors, and they're open 24/7.",XLNaiWF21OsAf0fMV6kuSg,2,2,3,e5g8afKptl0jVW1gMQBx_w

Great for watching sports. And I must say the FOOD is exceptional especially for bar food. I can't stay away from the grilled fish tacos.

If you gamble the comp your drinks and if you gamble enough they'll comp your food.

I used to come here for basically one reason-the nachos. It has a spicy chipotle sauce drizzled over top of layered black beans, cheese and cheese sauces, pico de gallo, jalapeños, and a great carne asada option. 
Now I live kind of far from sagos but still make the trip to visit as often as I can. 
The service is generally spectacular here, and they have a good selection of drinks at very reasonable prices. Good venue for watching sports, and the happy hours here are awesome as well.
Ps....I am a big fan of the texas hold em game available there as well. Management is responsive to customer concerns, and for this I am grateful as well.",eVufnL_jVKhqqeaAfysgCw,2,1,5,Bpp9LL6GIyQleJCC5bqQVQ

Ordered the strangest nachos I've ever had, topped with shredded cheese, Cheez Whiz and this strange chipotle sauce (maybe a sour cream base?) that rendered most of the chips a sloppy, soggy mess.

Also ordered a grilled chicken Caesar. That was disappointing - the chicken breast was bland and the dressing was almost nonexistent.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,2,0,3,y1w8ze0wFczaCcc6aBaB0Q
5529439,2012-04-01,5,mDoLWEOFmxcQ5TAPqxoJLg,"If a bar offers match play, we're there.  The reviews certainly didn't hurt the place either.  They had a ""text and receive $20 match play"" but they informed us it took 24 hours to put it on a player's card so we would get it the next time we came.  That's a lock for repeat business.  

We also had a restaurant.com coupon but it wasn't necessary during happy hour since all drinks were $2 and appetizers were half off.  Everything is full price if you use the coupon.  We ended up ordering chicken fingers, chicken fajitas and the carne asada tacos.  Everything was just OK.  I didn't really like the tacos since the salsa was already put on them and the beef was kinda cold.

Wednesday night was insane.  All the regulars were there for the video poker drawings they do so if you're planning to play, avoid Wednesday between 5pm and 8:30pm.  You will not get a seat at the bar.  The staff was friendly and attentive.   

Went back again last week on a Tuesday to redeem the free play and got a plate of the carne asada nachos which were better than what we ate before.  All the patrons sure love their slots and everyone knows everyone else for the most part.  The restaurant area was dead both times but I imagine it would be packed for certain sports events since the TV's are decent.  The football deals sound sweet so maybe we'll try that in the fall.  

They also just sent us another $20 match play in the mail along with a bogo entree coupon for signing up for their slot club.  I guess we're going back!",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,11,7,3,B9ZoE9zhPAYslXe_FfKHhQ

It's your typical casual bar that will leave you smelling like cigarettes til the next day lol great service; the bartender is always attentive and it's never usually crowded so you'll for sure be getting your drinks right away!

The waitresses would stop by ask if we were okay and promise that our food was coming but to no avail nothing. Extremely disappointing because the food is really good. Needless to say we ended up at Lucky""s on Jones to grab a bite to eat since we basically missed the happy hour around town sitting in this place.  I am hesitant to even give it 1 star.

They do a pretty good set up for the games in the dining room area with screens all over. Lots of giveaways of bears merchandise during the game. Also raffle some good looking jerseys and expensive gifts at the end of games. Typical bar style food with some things on special for the games which is nice. Started having Chicago dogs which is a good idea if your a Bears bar. So if your a Chicago Bears fan and looking for a good bar to watch the game and talk with some good Chicago people this is the place.
