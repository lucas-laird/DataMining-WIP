Chicken is also very skinny, must have changed suppliers, did not seem that tiny previously.
My advice avoid this location like the plague, it is terrible.  Owner should be replaced, obviously never spends any time supervising or training employees.  Forget trying to call to complain, no voice mailbox setup and no one answers phone.  I am 100% done with this location.",qyWhdT4pP_6_XGVUjVkvRg,1,0,1,f73l-h0I1NXoy1sQNPHGnw

I went in and inquired about the new spicy chicken bites they now have, I was curious what size they were, since that was going to determine how many I bought. The girl taking the orders named Kelly was MORE than helpful when answering my question, she went out of her way to walk back and bring me a sample of the chicken bites, THEN offered for me to try it. I declined since I wasn't hungry, but my husband tried it and said they were great! After seeing the size I decided to order 20 of the bites, Kelly then went back to check to see if they had enough for my order, which they didn't. She offered for us to wait while they made fresh. Of course I accepted, who wouldn't want fresh food. My husband and I took a seat to wait for our order, I observed Kelly with each customer that walked in. She was sweet, professional AND helpful with the customers orders. After a few minutes our bites were ready and we left. I will continue to KEEP coming to this location JUST because of Kelly. She went above and beyond what MOST fast food employees would, and I think that is wonderful. She was an absolute peach and made my experience at this particular location awesome.

They cram it in a plastic container with a see-through top that's half the size of the classic bucket now,  and I would have gotten sides I just didn't feel like spending another $3 - $7 just to have a little beans and/or coleslaw or even biscuits. The chicken itself felt like someone spilled some water on them because there was so much grease on them when I bit into it, it felt too juicy it was near mushy that I couldn't get a sound of crispy texture from the breading.

Crispy, spicy and sweet.  There's no lack of honey.  It's good.  I enjoyed it except the vinegar smell.  But that's BBQ for ya'.  They put the fluffy buttery biscuit in with the chicken so it soaked up some sauce.  YUMM-YYY!

However my KFC preference is their regular crispy two piece with hot sauce packets and their mashed potatoes with gravy.

Nice friendly service at this location.  Located in an area that attracts a lot of customer flow.  The time I ordered they could've had another person at the register.  They gave me wetnaps for my to go order; I didn't need to ask.

Everyone here is of great professionalism, however the weakest link breaks the chain.

If it is HER we get the blank, empty stare with no eye contact or customer service energy. Its like she (HER) rather be in bed sleeping or she could even by high or something.

I'm sure this store could figure out who HER is and fix the issue.

Also, why offer grilled chicken breasts if there is never any available?  Or it takes 20 mins to make but, wait, you drop the chicken of the floor (HER) and we wait 10 more minutes. But wait, you gave our chicken to someone else who walked in and out the door (HER) so we have to wait 10 more minutes again only to have to take our food to go because the lunch hour is almost up?

Or even worse, at another visit we asked for grilled chicken breasts and you say you don't have any?  Only way to get it is to tell the cashier that you will wait for it.

I'm not a frequent KFC eater, but I have fond memories of their chicken from childhood. Also, compared to Popeyes and Churches chicken, I prefer the breading by KFC.

The chicken strips DO NOT have the KFC chicken breading. I was a bit disappointed. And, it wasn't good. 

Fried original chicken- 3 stars. Breading flavor is still the same. It was overly salty however. 

Mashed potatoes- mehhhhhhhh. 

Corn- mehhhhhhhhhhhh. 

Biscuits- mehhhhhhh. It lacked any crispy edges or surface and was just a mushy biscuit. 

Potato wedges- 2 stars. Not crispy, and it tasted like it's been sitting in the heat for an hour. 

I ordered a chicken strip meal for $5, which comes with a drink, mashed potatoes, and a chocolate chip cookie. I didn't bother to check my orders before I left. THEY FORGOT THE COOKIE. I was really sad, since the cookie was the reason I was lured into the combo meal.

Over the 9 years I've lived here, I've been to this location about 10 times. I actively avoid it. The service is poor on good days and almost laughable on days like today, when the following happened: 

I went to the drive-thru and ordered two Original Recipe breasts and coleslaw. I pulled to the window, where I paid and received change. Then, the cashier said, ""We don't have any Original Recipe. Is extra crispy OK?"" 

I replied ""no,"" at which time the cashier said, ""I'll be right back,"" and went to ask someone what to do. 

He returned and said, ""Grilled?"" (seriously, this is an exact transcription) I said, ""No.""

After another consultation, the manager, Monica, came forward and said, ""Someone ordered all of the Original Recipe."" What I needed to know was 'how long will it take?' but Monica didn't think to provide this information. She then said something incomprehensible having to do with their being four to a bag (?) and told me it would take 20 minutes. 

I asked for a refund, which I eventually received after much gnashing of teeth.
