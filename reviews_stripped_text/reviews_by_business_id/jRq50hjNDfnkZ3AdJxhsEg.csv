523258,2015-01-28,0,jRq50hjNDfnkZ3AdJxhsEg,"OMfreakinG- the food at Scotty's kitchen, inside the rum runner is AMAZING! Everything is so fresh, and practically everything is made from scratch on the premises.  They make their own fries here. And onion rings, and breaded mozzarella, and marinara. They make their own hamburger patties from 100% angus beef. They even make their own pickles!
 I tried the Hatch green chile cheeseburger with the fried egg on top. Probably the best burger i've ever had. My friend tried the Korean fried chicken wings- awesome and unique. Id never heard of them before. -Super crunchy, and a little sweet n spicy.
 We also shared an order of ""Scott"" fries! And let me tell you, i will never be satisfied with plain old fries again. Cant wait to go back!!",KdxUmqyG5tXXvwC18BJHrQ,1,0,5,JxKUL_V1xFOg6RTR_AQc7Q

Texans.  10/24/16 The Bartender was gambling on the floor,  and not tending to her customers, but she was nice.  At times she was sitting at the bar drinking with customers and sometimes she was gambling.  This normally wouldnt bother me but she was not tending the bar. 
Also i went in there to watch Monday night football but the game audio was off.  Instead they were playing 50s music that I love but that was not cool.  Other patrons brought this to the bartenders attention but she didnt seem to give a crap. 
Sucks. Because this is a pretty cool bar.",yCfgnFtmOQijmRzTP3adzw,4,1,2,zcYfByCbmsjEN-XJzo54hg

The bartender was nice, beer was cold and I could even smoke a cigar.
I'll be back.",TL01sciidCuV8Q1nYJu9kQ,0,0,4,p-2pV2RClJO2eKJx_1MSiQ

4026736,2015-02-09,0,jRq50hjNDfnkZ3AdJxhsEg,"I believe Scotty's Place is newer in this location, as a food provider.  The food is unbelievable.  The Korean wing is the best prepared wing I've had, maybe ever.  The green chile burger was fantastic and the gf got a philly cheese that she said was her fav of all time.  Great stuff.  The bar itself was fairly nondescript, but the food is worth the visit.  Go hungry and bring cash, or you'll have to use the ATM.",lYiAXajzcgMV7_1GnJeOrg,2,0,5,yvWvGzOBjHVO40mm39dXow
4104922,2018-01-27,0,jRq50hjNDfnkZ3AdJxhsEg,"This place was absolutely the most filthy bar I have EVER been in. 
I walked in around 6:15 for a 7:00 pool match. I discovered  that there was live music, a dart tournament AND league Play for 8 and 9 Ball all scheduled for that evening. The place was over crowded. The Fire Marshall would have had a field day. 
All of the chairs that are normally used for league pool players had been moved to quite literally two the other side of the bar. So, there were 12 Pool players and four chairs. 
I went to the bar, where there was ONE bartender available to serve the entire bar. I asked for a Pepsi, easy ice. The server grabbed a glass and plunged it into the ice well. Scooping out an entire cup of ice. She placed the cup onto the drain area and used the soda gun to fill the glass. It foamed so much that it was overflowing in a matter of seconds. She poured part of the foam out and tried again, then again. It took her four tries to get the glass full with soda and not foam. As the glass spilled over, she continued to fill it. She handed me the glass, completely covered in sticky soda syrup at this point. I pointed to the bar top and asked if she had a napkin? She set the glass down and handed me a square cocktail napkin. 
As the liquid dried, it became sticky. It only got worse, the longer the glass sat. 
I took the glass back to where I had stored my cue case, and tried to use the napkin to wipe down the outside of the glass. The napkin stuck to the glass. 
I walked back over to the server, who was standing next to the owner, who was Bull$&/++_Â€ with other customers, and asked for a wet paper towel or wash cloth. The owner handed me a rag he pulled from a bucket full of dirty water. He didn't bother to ring it out, just handed it to me dripping wet. 
I didn't want to put that in contact with my glass so I handed it back and asked for a paper towel instead. (He never asked why I wanted the cloth in the first place.) he ignored me. 
I finally got a wet paper towel from the women's bathroom. I wiped down my glass and found a chair I could sit in to watch my teammates play. 
When I went to stand up, for my turn to shoot, I discovered that I WAS STUCK to the chair. Both the back of my shirt and the seat of my jeans were stuck to the chair. 
It was all just too disgusting. I shot my two games of Pool, won my match, settled my tab and hightailed it out of there. 
If we have to play there again, I won't be participating. 
I feel like I need a Typhoid Shot.",S2EVS7LSLBFgelx3fOHqpg,0,0,1,tCjDJ4o7sHSwfFupRobJzQ
4355711,2013-09-29,0,jRq50hjNDfnkZ3AdJxhsEg,"Papavelli! Who would have thought an amazing dining experience was in the back of the Rum Runner on Desert Inn.  Well, I would not have ever conceived the thought to be honest.  The Owner/Chef Anastsaioss Papavelli and Owner/Chef Darren quietly prepare the meals for the bar patrons.  Both times I have gone, I have asked for the Gyro Salad. It is damn amazing. The meat is well seasoned and the dressing are home made. HOME MADE...fresh to order. I am aware of at least four home made dressings: Ranch, Tzatziki, Mediterranean, and Italian. The menu is extensive but not overbearing. I have seen some impressive meals leave this little kitchen including a Philly Cheesesteak which would rival anything from Philadelphia. Chicken Wings prepared and marinated in a sauce that anyone from Buffalo NY would be proud of. The menu is definitely east coast centric and offers a yummy option to the standard burgers and chicken fingers offered at most bars in Las Vegas. I recommend this place absolutely. The bartenders are friendly. The drinks are inexpensive. There are dart and pool tables available as well. It is a bar in Las Vegas so the malodorous aroma of a freshly lit cigarette is always present.   Regardless of that...the food is damn good. I strongly recommend trying it at least once. Say hello to Anastassio and Darren!",uzUi7nAnryHJcZNxMCcoUA,3,1,5,m-B4rzPGr-avBCTkyArlvA

Their food was way better than your average bar food. The brussel sprouts with bacon were delish and the onion rings were amazing too! The Korean wings have an amazing sweet and sour type sauce with just enough kick. I can't wait to try Scotty's sammy's and salads!",P9UxxzbStTHyJCKL2tF58g,4,1,5,TBZD2x3qt1Ub9JCoOQNvzA
