 I ordered the meatball sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the Italian Sub. The meatball sandwich was delicious! The meatballs were tasty and it was a perfect amount of cheese and sauce melted on top. The bread was lightly toasted just how I like, and very freshly baked. The Italian sub that my boyfriend ordered was good, however the oil and vinegar they used was a little too sweet for me.

The restaurant was clean and the people behind the counter were very friendly and efficient. We were in town visiting hey family member, and would definitely go back and eat there again the next time we're in town.",0SEbR0Yk4v6fKwHwC-KsbA,1,0,4,Bf4dK9hPdO9Ln8L5Doul6g

I like to sneak some of the hottest sauces on my boyfriend's while he refills our drinks. I'm scandalious.

I walked in on a Friday night at 7pm and didn't have to wait to order and my sandwich was ready in about 8 minutes.  In and out in less than 10 minutes is always good.  By the time I drove the 10 minutes home and opened up the sandwich, it was still warm and tasty.  The only problem was that the oil leaked and half the bread was soggy - which does not make for a good sub experience.  Nobody wants soggy bread!  Since the sandwich was ginormous, it didn't really matter that I skipped the soggy parts - it was still plenty of food for one person.

I've tried subway, port of subs capriottis, They all suck honestly (especially capriottis due to their bad attitudes at all of their stores) So i came into Firehouse a few months ago and I'm HOOKED!! This place is great, These guys are always polite they know how to make a good sandwich without making it soggy and has lots of flavor from the fresh bread the REALLY good meat (i like the hero), The hot sauce bar is a nice PERK!! The restaurant is always very clean and organized, Bathrooms are spotless (no graffiti). Anyway back to my review of 10/5/2013   i'd been working in the yard alllllll day long 6  1/2 hours and had no interest in cooking dinner so we decided to just grab diiner at Firehouse and go sit in the hot tub and relax after working all day. i wakked into firehouse and was immediatley greeted with a smile and a hello by jennifer (give her a raise) i had already placed my order online and was just coming in to pick them up and then hit the hot tub, sandwiches were just being finished up, They handed me my sandwiches  asked me if I needed anything else/ Drinks? hot sauce? napkins?  So i hit the hot sauce bar and then headed out, After the jacuuzi and getting back home a few hours later and enjoying the sandwiches (that were perfect as usual) I noticed my answering machine blinking and almost just didnt check it and was going to just go to bed and check the messages the next morning but i decided to just check it anyways/  It was jennifer from Firehouse saying ""HI"" and she noticed that i left my wallet laying on the counter next to the hot sauce bar and she wanted to let me know she'd hold onto it for me, I was like oops!!!  I went down there to pick it up and say thank you to jennifer and the crew but she was no longer there but everyone else was and they were very polite and handed right back to me. I was SHOCKED especially in las vegas that anyone was honest anymore!!  I had $150.00 cash in my wallet and 3 different credit cards and EVERYTHING was there, Nothing had been touched. I just honestly cant thank these guys enough and i will be a customer for life!!  Give jennifer a raise honestly!!  Great food, Great service, Honesty, Good prices, If you want to have a great sandwich and know you can leave your wallet behind when you leave  ( LOL )  :-)   Go here!!

Firehouse Subs is crazy good.  Excellent size, quality, flavor and down right satisfying with a very happy tummy effect.  This is not a over the top Guy Fierri Food Network sandwich.  This is a solid well made sandwhich.  Either 8"" or 12"" are available.  Size and proportion are top notch.  Moreso is the quality of meat they use.  The flavors of the sandwich I had (Fireman Hero) were out of this world.  
As a novelty in the shop they have a rack of various hot sauces for your consumption.  There must have been over 20 different kinds to choose from.  Most important for me to mention is the Captin Sorenson's Datil Pepper Sauce.  OMG!  This sauce is off the hook good.  So good I footed the $4.99 for a bottle to take home with me.  CRAZY GOOD.  
Service was friendly and quick.  Atmosphere of the shop was really cool.  Lots of firehouse memorabilia (go figure).  Top marks on cleanliness in the shop and the restrooms.

The Good:
One if those awesome Coke machines where you can have 642,690,371,625,974+++ combinations.

The Bad: Reading my reviews lately, you would think I have a weirdly super-sensitive stomach and I really don't. 

But yeah, this place made me violently ill as well. I had the Club on a Sub so I don't know if it was the mayo or what it was... but yeah. 

Also - the staff was inattentive as hell. There were a minimum of 12 staff members there and it STILL took 35 minutes to get our food at about 2 in the afternoon on a Saturday. If this is the norm during the week as well, I would never make it back to work on time. 

The staff were more interested in watching the baseball game and talking about each play than making customers' sandwiches. Someone had to go to the counter three times to ask for the ice machine to be refilled.

1914005,2017-06-04,1,dPbvWt-6YVxtGkeh7f9JpQ,"Here's the summary/too long didn't read:

Bread: wheat or white and both are very soft

Meat: they have your typical selections and they all taste great. Much higher quality than their competition.  

Cheese: many choices that compliment the meats rather well. I suggest a warm sub with melty goodness

Show me what you got: they heat up the meats in a sous vide style process that enhances the meats flavor and makes it more moist.  There's also a wide variety of hot sauces ranging in heat from 1 to ""oh god why did I do that?""  


As a large (fat) man, I have a great appreciation for sandwiches. The same way others seek out fine wines and chocolates, I search for sandwiches. 

I remember first finding Firehouse over ten years ago and was floored. I seriously ate here at least once a day for two weeks straight. I'm probably the reason they don't have stamp cards anymore. I had no idea that Firehouse was a chain until other stores opened up later. I'm typically not a fan of chain restaurants as they feel stale, boring, and use subpar ingredients.  

The bread is soft, fresh, and flavorful. The meats are flavorful and much higher quality than the cat food served at Subway. The cheeses are creamy and melt perfectly over the meats. Their mayonnaise and mustard compliment the entire package and bring it all together. To top off your amazing sandwich they have 30-40 hot sauces for you to put on your sandwich. 

Thank you Firehouse for making great sandwiches!",HwmeT0Rq9OI4ox04WlNdAg,1,0,5,SKv8FR0iVAG4jftxo1orwg

There are two things that were good about this place:
1) The Rat Pack firefighter mural on the wall.
2) The selection of hot sauces with convenient little to-go cups.

I'm still not quite sure what to make of the service. Everyone was sorta zoned out and just going through the motions. No friendliness, no excellence, and quite the air of ""you are annoying me, please go away"".

But really warrants the 1 star is the food. I had the chili, steak and cheese sandwich, and smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket.

The chili looked good, even though it came topped with strips of cheddar cheese and rings of onions (not shredded cheese and diced onions), but it was runny and bland. It was almost inedible.

The steak and cheese sandwich was absolutely inedible. This is essentially their version of a Philly cheesesteak. The menu describes it as sautéed sirloin steak, melted provolone, sautéed onions and bell peppers, mayo, and mustard. The only flavor that I could taste was mayo. Overwhelming mayo. And it wasn't good mayo. There was no mustard and very few onions and bell peppers. Barely any cheese. And the meat was completely flavorless. All served on some horrible bread.

The smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket was an improvement, but only achieved barely edible status (once dipped in hot sauce). The meat was tender, but flavorless. The cheese didn't add much to the overall sandwich. And it was rather soggy.

2414678,2013-01-23,0,dPbvWt-6YVxtGkeh7f9JpQ,"Ok so this is a review from my visit last night 1/21/13 around 8:00PM.  This is my second visit as I visited this location when they just opened up.  I don't remember what I ate that time but what I do remember thinking was that it is just like any other sandwich place in Vegas...well I would like to take that comment back as a result of my visit last night.

I recently stopped eating meat...again, and I'm sure all my fellow vegetarians can agree that it is difficult to find good places that are veggie friendly.  I mean don't get me wrong, places TRY but all they really do is just eliminate the meat from their existing sandwiches.  Well my only option here was their Veggie sandwich.  I didn't read the description as I thought it was going to be the typical lettuce, tomato, cheese sandwich.  Well to my surprise my regular sandwich was loaded with grilled onions, grilled green bell peppers, grilled mushrooms, and ofcourse the lettuce and tomato.  I was so happy to see that they made the extra effort in creating a veggie option rather then just removing the meat from an existing sandwich.

We obviously really love the sandwiches but......the service is terrible! We are both vegetarians and ordering is a huge deal each and every time. We constantly have to repeat ourselves over and over to the unfriendly staff regarding our order. We order the same thing every time we go there and all that is different is cold, no meat and more veggies. Apparently, if your ordering from right off the menu everything is cool, but if you want substitutions or extras, it's a HUGE fiasco (which they aren't shy about showing, especially the female owner). 
We aren't expecting perfection or a parade every time we walk in, but a little patience and recognition would be nice. Their sandwiches are fantastic but with all the choices available in Las Vegas and the poor economy, good customer service is a must.

Entering this place, they welcome you ""Welcome to the Firehouse!"" lol I was the only person to order so I approached the cashier, Thiago, and he asked me if I had been there before, which I had not. He went over their store, how they got their start, how each store is unique and how their menu is and works. As I starred at it, I scooted to the side and said the woman behind me could order while I read the board. Then Joshua one of the sandwich makers said, ""Would you like a recommendation?"" So, I said sure and he recommended The New York Steamer and it was delicious! It had corned beef brisket, pastrami, melted provolone, deli mustard, mayo, and Italian dressing. I made it a combo and got a big drink and a bag of chips to go with it. I am a big fan of this place and look forward to visiting their other locations and trying more of their food. Also, when my combo came to 10.22 they asked me if I wanted to make it an even $11 so they could donate that change to first responders so I said okay. I noticed a big check on the wall later for a couple hundred thousand dollars that was donated to a local charity on behalf of this place. I really like this place and I will be back. Also, with precision timing I might add (I am a trained 5-star food server) Gabe came over and checked on me to make sure the sandwich was good and asked me if I needed anything. What a nice crew, lucky ownership of this establishment I'll tell ya! Gabe, Josh and Thiago deserve bonuses! Also, there's a cool painting on the wall so I asked the guys about it and they told me that each location has an original painting, painted onto the wall -- so I look forward to seeing the other ones here in town. This one featured the Rat Pack and had an old-school Vegas theme. Great food, nice workers, and doing good for the community - I am a fan! Lastly, I want to emphasize how much I appreciated Joshua making a sandwich recommendation. I wasn't familiar with the menu, I never seen it before, I wasn't sure what to pick - he picked the perfect sandwich for a new comer, and truly made my visit an easy win.

Their flagship sandwich is called the ""Hook & Ladder,""  which you guessed it is a fireman reference.  

The reason I went here two time in a seven day period is because of a radio commercial.  Yes, a radio ad!  They have blitzed the radio stations promoting their new Pork and Slaw sandwich.  The first 50 times I heard this my brain started to give in.  It was almost like a jedi mind trick via the radio.

Yeah I know your mouth is watering right now.  I finally made it to the restaurant super stoked and somewhat brainwashed.  When I bit into this sandwich I my taste buds when into shock.

I enjoy the variety of hot sauces to choose from and the touch screen soda dispenser has unique sodas to choose from, like Mello Yellow.  But the last time I was there the workers were unorganized and didn't seem to work well under pressure when it got busy.  

I called to order take-out because during rush hour I didn't want to wait in line.  When I arrived my sandwiches were ready; and what I mean by ready is wrapped up, in a bag, ready for me to pick it up.  When I told one of the workers that my sandwiches were ready and I'm ready to pay, she said the cashier who takes take-out orders is on break and I had to wait in line.  There were 3 or 4 people in front of me and and the cashier must've been new because she looked like she didn't know how to take orders.  Guess they didn't want my money right then and there.  After waiting for about 10 mins, two workers came back from their break and one jumped on the other register.  Finally I was able to pay, but the cashier was confused and couldn't find my order. 

I'll mostly likely go back again, but what horrible service.  After a long day at work the last thing I want to do is wait in line for sandwiches that were ready to be paid for.",TjLuNZHUokRUZc6vNJ3Abg,2,2,3,XmRUYc2apOrh6KZJEqwi9Q

I feel that the place is starting to lack in customer service a lot. I dont understand what is the complication to make a sandwich in this shop. Honestly their customer service sucks now. They are so slow and uncaring. 
1. two weeks ago I ordered a chicken sub plus 2 more. I payed for all sandwiches and they tell me that they are out of chicken.. ok fine.. put turkey.. Cashier says no problem she switched my  order accordingly. I did not have to pay anything extra. What I did not realize until later was that.. it was actually cheaper to get a turkey sandwich so I was overcharged. She did not bother to do a return. Nice. I waited forever to get the sandwiches..It was not any busier than a quiznos would be.
2. I ordered ONE turkey sandwich last Saturday from my house for take out. I figured since they have been slow making sandwiches.. I will call in to give them more time. I called.. and they said.. 10 minutes.. I left my house and got there in the 10 minutes.. I still had to wait an additional 20 minutes just to get a sandwich.. 30 minutes for ONE sandwich? are you kidding me? This place is really lacking on focus. I dont know if they owners realize this but I dont remember waiting 30 minutes for a sandwich anywhere EVER!!! I am real disappointed. If they were more efficient I would be there at least 2 times a week...now I am starting to not go because I dont feel like waiting so long. Maybe they need more training. I dont know if the other locations are this slow. Sandwiches.. I love them.. customer service.. not so much.",a96yb3e4bI9i5js9zBUqJQ,0,0,2,bEj0iH9TCFqBnZntv5VKEA

What's different about Firehouse hot subs is that they used a steamer to heat their meat and cheese which adds a little moisture to every bite.

Sandwiches - also yum!

Hey, how can I not like a place that is owned and operated by firemen? Considering my obsession with Rescue Me, I'd say that's pretty much impossible. 

On my birthday (May 1st) I decided I would try out Firehouse Subs. Because guess what? You can get a free medium sub on your birthday here - your choice of which kind of sandwich! I decided to do this on my birthday because FS is a bit out of the way for me to drive to, but it's been on my ""To Try"" list for awhile. Now I wish there was one right up the block from where I live. It's so frustrating to be faced with ONE sandwich option in my neighborhood: Subway. Boo.

As for Firehouse - they have now been moved into my top sandwich spots! I personally think they are better than Cap's and the setup of the shop is nicer than Cap's as well. I think the ""firehouse"" decor adds to the experience and of course, the multitude of hot sauces to sprinkle on your sandwiches kicks everything up a notch! Excuse my Emeril euphemism. 

On my trip I got the Hook & Ladder: ham, turkey, melty cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayo, and this nice deli sauce mustard - mmm! Without the mustard it's just an ordinary sandwich, but with it - oh my... 

The staff was nice and happy about my birthday sub (yay!) and I really love their Coca Cola machine. It's like the new ones inside Five Guys burger places.

4655442,2016-03-05,8,dPbvWt-6YVxtGkeh7f9JpQ,"Yesterday, I celebrated National Cold Cuts Day with a delicious Firehouse hero. When my appetite is on fire for a first-rate sub, the Firehouse has successfully extinguished it. On National Cold Cuts Day as soon as I left my job in the vicinity of Eastern at Serene, I made a beeline here. It was my recent experiences at other Firehouses led me to this location to celebrate a day honoring cold cuts. 

    On account of the fact that this was National Cold Cuts Day, I exchanged nearly $11 for a sub meal featuring cold cuts. This made ordering a breeze. A few minutes later a friendly employee delivered the Firehouse hero (in some parts of the country they call subs heros) to the table. This was a thick sandwich stuffed with USDA choice roast beef, Virginia honey ham, smoked turkey breast and provolone cheese. This was a quality sandwich unlike some places where the bread is falling apart and the ingredients are to one side. This sandwich was smoking good. And where there's smoke there's fire. When you add mayonnaise, mustard, tomatoes, lettuce, and onions; this delectable sandwich had my taste buds on fire. On the side was a kosher dill pickle and small bag of chips. At Firehouse, Coke instead of water extinguishes thirst. The restaurant features a Freestyle Coke machine offering approximately 100 flavors. This worked out well for me because my favorite soft drink in the world is strawberry soda. In addition to the Freestyle machine there is a cooler selling other drinks. 

   This Firehouse theme permeating throughout the restaurant creates an upbeat and even interesting dining environment. The centerpiece of every Firehouse is a hand-painted and custom-designed mural. The interesting mural adorning this location is one of 850 that Joe Puscas has created. When I took breaks from chowing down the Firehouse hero, I'd look at the droll scene above of firemen putting out a blaze at the legendary Sands where one of them is singing into the firehose. Everywhere I saw neat things including a picture of a check dated February 16, 2016 showing that Firehouse Subs gave $191,888 to the Nevada First Responders and Public Safety. It is safe to state that dining in Firehouse is the antithesis of a  depressing experience. 

   The employees were friendly. Instantaneously they greeted me when I walked inside the Firehouse. They delivered the food to my table, and asked me how everything was. I was satisfied with the service. 

   On National Cold Cuts Day, I walked inside Firehouse with my appetite on fire. After a rough day working, it was burning. Firehouse extinguished the fire. This has been the fourth Firehouse that I have reviewed highly on Yelp. It seems that the only fire remaining is a burning love for their subs.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,9,8,4,TdOUtcXWppjOaDMNCWhTlA

5500667,2015-01-04,1,dPbvWt-6YVxtGkeh7f9JpQ,"Look, if you told me that I would be sitting here at midnight on a Saturday night writing a review on Yelp not only about a sandwich but about a chain sandwich joint I would tell you to call an ambulance because something is clearly wrong with me... Well, don't call an ambulance but feel free to call the fire station or in this case fire house subs. 

We call ahead quite often from work to firehouse to grab a few hook and ladders and some of the other hot subs they offer. Now, to be completely honest I think the sandwiches are just okay but they are very organized and usually do not mess up orders. 

What brings this place up to a 4 star review for me is the customer service not only during the call in order process but also when I have been into the location with my family. True story, I have a friend that offered to bring my 3 year old a real fire helmet to borrow and wear around the house and my son said only if it is from Firehouse Subs... Does that mean we have a sandwich problem or does Firehouse just have an amazing marketing scheme with those plastic fire hats they give out?

Now for the meat of this review, which if I may mention is not fresh and heated like the meat at Firehouse. The sandwiches are normally on point and fresh to order, my only complaint is that the way they heat the meat when it is ordered to go they are normally a little moister than I would like by the time they get to us because of the steaming process they use. I would imagine that if they put all hot sandwiches in the trays they place the meatball sandwiches in that problem would be fixed. As mentioned before the customer service is always spot on from the hello when you walk in to the have a great day when you walk out. 

A great place to grab a sandwich quickly and fill up when you are on the go, and don't forget to go over to the hot sauce bar and grab a 10 and take you taste buds for a ride.",sqJZt_Z144RWGk4bdKTpSw,2,1,4,AaOL5Jw7pEFKWsWEbJiawA

all of the sandwiches are hot.  all of them.  And they steam them, not toast them although the bread seems to be toasted, so I'm not sure what they do back there.

I'm not sure who paid 16 bucks for two small sandwiches, But the small sandwiches are just 5.50, the large ones are 7.50 or so.  The smalls are pretty hearty.

And not that I care but there's not a single vegetarian option.  If you're looking for veggie, I wouldn't go here.",PomQayG1WhMxeSl1zohAUA,1,0,4,n9t73gCrvn9K6AKyqDOjGA

The Engineer sub is my most recent choice, as well as the club sub. The staff is always friendly here too. I'm also a fan of the soda machine because of all the options you can choose.

5672539,2012-01-25,0,dPbvWt-6YVxtGkeh7f9JpQ,"I have been a fan of Firehouse subs for almost 8 years, since I ate at one of the very first restaurants in Jacksonville, Florida. When I stopped traveling for work, Firehouse was one of the chains that I missed the most.

One day, I was at Cars & Coffee across Eastern, stomach growling, grumbling, nay, SCREAMING for food. When it gets to this point, there is no easy decision, everything and nothing sounds good. Something caught my eye as my head turned to check out a loud car, a familiar white and red sign, no, it couldn't be. Scanning actively for the sign again, staring at it incredulously, I thought I had to be imagining something in my hunger induced haze.

Fortunately, I was not imagining it! I made my way across the street to make a Hook & Ladder intimate friends with my belly in short order. Ordering my food, I brought out my trusty Firehouse punch card from the East coast and asked the lady how long they had been open. I was absolutely SHOCKED to find out that they were celebrating their one year anniversary. How could such delicious food be so close to me, and they not advertise at all?!

My go-to order is always the Hook & Ladder with a sweet tea. The heated turkey and ham, with melty cheese, mayo, lettuce and tomato just hits the spot, even if it doesn't fill me up, check the nickname, bottom-less pit, remember?

I will say that aside from the register worker, most of the staff does seem rather aloof and distant, when busy or slow, they have always been that way at this location. My sandwiches are always good, so that is what keeps me coming back.",ajx1YQYaSiF_tBFaaP7XKA,0,0,4,bAwzA1eacY_pW2jAtQuDOg

I ordered a Medium Firehouse 'Hero"" Sub sporting hot Virginia Ham, roast beef, turkey, Smoked Provolone, tomatoes, lettuce, White Onion, and oil & vinegar on a warm Wholewheat Roll, along with Miss Vickie's Sea Salt & Vinegar packaged Potato Chips.  The vegetables were all fresh, meats juicy from application of vinegar & oil, and cheese nicely melted over the meats.  

Service was friendly.  And the atmosphere was nice and casual.  A Rat Pack fire crew wall painting was rather cool.  And, diners were seated at Dalmatian spotted wooden tables.  

How fitting for a firehouse ambiance!  I expect to be back.",s2o_JsABvrZVm_T03qrBUw,7,6,4,MmB-ReSjxnHokeZ-ySnV8Q

5918885,2011-05-04,0,dPbvWt-6YVxtGkeh7f9JpQ,"Was in the area and decided to give this place a try, after our first two options were closed already.  The store was clean and has nice themed decorations.  The staff was proficient at their job and the sandwich order was prepared and delivered to the table quickly.

This was my first and only visit to any Firehouse Subs, so it took me a few minutes to finally decide on ordering the Steamer (#3) combo that I upgraded from med to footlong for an extra $2 or you can also 2x the meat on the medium size sandwich for $2.  It was a good idea to upgrade the size, as my friend who just ordered the regular combo was still hungry after polishing off his medium sandwich, his bag of chips and the drink.  I was satisfied was the sandwich, but it is on the pricey side. ($7.59 for the large sandwich +$2.19 for the combo + tax = $10.58)

I still think I would get a better deal at Togos (if I was back in California) and Quiznos (especially with coupons and online promos they email). So in terms of value, I think it lags behind the other sub shops.

Flavor and taste-wise, I thought it was good.  And the best part was trying out the assortment of bottled sauces that are available for patrons to try.  My favorite is the African origin Puri Puri sauce.

Anyway, I am glad I gave it a try, but highly doubt that I will return in the future.  

Decor:  4/5  Themed decorations that you know is professionally implemented.

Service:  4/5  They did their job professionally.

Taste:  3.5/5  Pretty good sandwich (Steamer, which is supposedly their top seller).

Value:  2.5/5  On the pricey side, and the portion is on the smallish side.

We weren't the only guest waiting when others had to walk numerous times to the counter to ask if there food was ready. Finally got our food & drove home. We got home & opened the sandwiches club on a sub & hook and ladder which were Cold & it fell apart. The bread looked cheap & basically Noooooooo Meat & more veggies. We couldn't eat it. We end up throwing it away. Btw, the meal prices ain't cheap so you would thought you would get at least your money's worth but we were wrong.We will not be coming back to this location.
