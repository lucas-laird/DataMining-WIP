I tried them all. 
Fried Oreo was my favorite.
Fried Reese's was good too.
Fried Snickers was okay.
Skip the Fried Twinkie.",pfJdepP88pDSrLn_vTcHTw,0,0,4,WS0_S9JNwfhLi-7cQ1PsZw

Now I was a little intoxicated both times that I got it, but at 1:30 in the morning you can't beat the price and location!  Grab a corn dog and go into the casino and continue on, perfect!",7ivMHeB-GdUIC70AVapR4A,0,0,3,AjlBjncyX01GRrn-utSBEg

Fried Oreos, Twinkies, pickles, Snickers and Reese's peanut butter cup.  Now, I've tried fried twinkies at the Santa Cruz Broadwalk which pretty much tasted like a warned cake fried in oil.  I was gamed to try a fried Oreo this time.  
For $3.25, you get 3 battered fried cookies.  The batter was light and sort of between a tempura batter and denser corn dog batter.  Right in the middle was the Oreo and all 3 cookies were covered with whipped cream and chocolate syrup.  Yummy goodness.  Personally, I thought fried Oreos tasted better than fried Twinkies.  The dude behind me was commenting that fried Reese peanut butter cups are his favorite, but he was on a diet.  I concur, he needed to be on a diet.

they also take forever to complete your order. it does not take 20 minutes to make a quesadilla, sorry.

never going here again.",gHBMX2oTgxcPQr3KKrn3Xg,0,0,2,38jDp1dKWBMmuHP0gb3VtQ

The cashier girl was nice, but the food took forever- definitely on the slow side.",C8DetBEoq0TWpQtl0VYEvA,0,1,3,ac0abL7dpJWZ_Afsm--ugA

Big Hurt's happens to sell corndogs very late into the evening, which is good for late night munchies. They also sell fries that are too salty, unless you really like a lot of salt in which case they might just be good. And, wait for it, cheeseburgers on donuts instead of buns. So, in case all the gambling and drinking doesn't kill you, they've got you covered.",ACUVZ4SiN0gni7dzVDm9EQ,9,7,3,YUXMFTudqRfJlltFHBGTxA
3016872,2012-08-06,0,T8Z5LpR4gJXexRk-33P4LQ,"The stars are solely for their hotdogs and garlic fries.  Hotdogs were good, garlic fries were even better.  Prob one of my fav garlic fries ever, generous on the garlic!  Other than it being on the oily side, the flavor was awesome.

I got the Kraut dog.  Was pretty tasty, lots of kraut was given and the dog tasted great because it wasn't salty or oily.  

I did catch 2 things that didn't sit well with me...  They charged me $1 for kraut add on when their menu says $0.75.  And when they gave me my garlic fries, they only gave me a tiny ass portion.  I knew that b/c I looked at the 2 customers in front of me get the same thing but they got a full big basket each.  I told the worker that i paid $4.25 and u only gave a couple fries.  He was nice and fixed it, but i was a bit irritated cuz i had to wait again and my food that I already got, got cold.  

I'll still come back again.  It totally hit the spot.  This time I'll  be counting pennies and fries!  lol",lGYlH8ejr8hl3rKmHvuqMg,0,0,3,IYgKUQxOINYHMj3rnesj-g

I went here on a recent Vegas vacay. Had seen it on a past trip but kept forgetting to give it a try. Finally did so and loved the Italian Stallion sandwich (photo coming soon), and raspberry ice tea. You have the option of getting the sandwich with or without fries..I am glad I got mine without after I saw my sandwich lol. It was loaded with chicken fingers, italian sausage, peppers, onions, cheese, and marinara sauce..yumm-o :). I went on a weekday late morning and there were only 2 people in front of me. Took some time to get my food but in my opinion well worth the wait. I will be back to this place for sure and recommend to anyone wanting a satisfying and delish meal!",czgKq1me86NYHdHUsr1Djg,0,1,5,jfQO5eQBQVlYdP09GGIgCw

1. fast friendly service
2. inexpensive fair food such as fried anything and wonderful chili cheese fries... and a new must have, fried pickles.
3. on the vegas strip with atmosphere to match
4. hits the spot and you practically walk off all the calories walking up and down the strip",EJU09nc6IwZfrXpR_YzUzw,0,0,5,ZmolHzoVRlK5P9MQ4L6NUA

4742203,2011-07-19,0,T8Z5LpR4gJXexRk-33P4LQ,"I use to work for this place. The Carne asada tacos and burrito are GOOD! *at least when I worked there ;) * Fried Oreos would have to be my fav as far as Fried Deserts go - but the Fried Twinkie is like a deep fried cake! 

Corn dogs are ""ok"" then again they are straight from a frozen box of ""Foster Farms Corn Dogs"". Pretzels are rubbery so I wouldn't recommend them - plus they keep the butter in a spray butter for the topping - GROSS! Nachos - there Nachos, you'd think ""Where can I go wrong with this"" right? UNTIL YOU GET PAST 3-5 PIECES OF CHIPS AND SEE NOTHING BUT CRUMBLES AT THE BOTTOM OF YOUR BOWL.

I love this place, and will probably visit when I go back to Vegas for a visit, but for the money you spend - go to the hard rock cafe/bar right down the street - or to a buffet, THERES AT LEAST ONE IN EVERY CASINO.",2Te9qXzv4YRhjQtSFHBk1g,3,0,3,XMjtG2R52MRljyfd3PCeKw

The garlic fries are very good I liked it better than the chilli fries, just remember its called the big hurt for a reason so clutch to you antacids and dont have it too late",E8H8KHzMWfxsRzn0xuy_Yg,0,0,3,oXYpqg6XZGxayvOvkHbJvQ

It had plenty of meat and avocado... but no rice or veggies?? Also, service was pretty slow maybe cause they cook it on the spot. It was reaaaally good tho!",U-blmCm_qUbibUUgqDSB_g,4,4,4,E61zv05irDexBwDUaKgajA
5367691,2010-05-06,0,T8Z5LpR4gJXexRk-33P4LQ,"I was attracted to this food truck because it had a lot of different things on their menu. I didn't feel like splurging too much on lunch so anything quick will do. I ordered a corndog and it was meh. The corn batter was good but the dog part was weirdddddd. It had a weird squishy mushy texture to it when you chew. Cheap for vegas, expensive for a gross hotdog. =(
