ANGARA INDIA SPICE GRILL IS NOT TO BE TRUSTED!
We visited Angara India Spice Grill for lunch today, expecting to try out a new restaurant. Instead, we ended up leaving disappointed and angry. Here's the story:
Wife found a coupon on Restaurant.com for this place, which we'd never tried before. The coupon was for $25 (it cost $10), with a minimum purchase of $50. The net cost (in retail) to the restaurant amounts to $15.
Angara India Spice Grill is in a strip mall, near a Target store. There are at least two OUTSTANDING Indian restaurants in the neighborhood -- Curry Leaf and Mint. So, we were not exactly shopping for another Indian food place, but the coupon makes this worth a try for first-timers.
Reviews posted at the usual sites were positive. Good food, Clean place. Certainly, Angara was enticing for those who enjoy Indian cuisine.
We arrived at exactly 2:32 pm on a Tuesday afternoon. Note the exact time, because it's important. The website and hours on the door are posted as LUNCH: 11 am -- 3 pm. So, we were 28 minutes prior to close. Dinner began at 5 pm.
We were seated and were told the coupon would not be valid. An Indian waiter, who presumably was also the owner-manager said the coupon did not apply to the lunch buffet. By the way, we were the ONLY CUSTOMERS in the restaurant.
We explained that we were not interested in the buffet. We planned to order off the menu and would gladly order $50 worth of food. The waiter-manager-owner stated firmly that we would not be able to order off the menu. We stated that we would pay dinner prices (even though the coupon made no distinction between lunch and dinner). Waiter-manager-owner-weasel then fabricated some tale that the ""lunch ala cart menu ends at 2;30.""
Wait. So, the restaurant is open for lunch until 3 pm. But we can't order off the menu after 2;30. And, it's now 2:32.
Seriously?
I stand up in stunned silence and begin to march towards the front door. Wife, who can be just as much a bulldog as me if the wrong buttons get pushed, tells the waiter-manager-owner that we would have gladly taken lunch anyway we could get it, even off the buffet. The restaurant would charge us $50, get two new customers, and the waiter would even earn a $10 tip (20 percent). How the hell can they be TURNING AWAY customers? THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!
I was out to the parking lot and wife said she wanted to go back inside and tell him more of what she thought of this situation.  Wife went inside and explained that we'd become loyal customers of their competition Curry Leaf entirely because they offered a coupon for first-timers and that ended up producing perhaps 50-60 visits over the next three years. Don't they see the UPSIDE of offering a meal and honoring their own coupon?
Instead, they make up excuses. They don't list the details on the coupon. They even reinvent the hours of operation on the spot.
Of course, we are NEVER GOING BACK. They are history. Dead to us. To see a completely empty restaurant turn away two paying customers which guarantees them some profit along, with the upside of future loyalty, strikes me monumental stupidity.
This situation was handled very, very poorly. I urge others to avoid Angara India Spice Grill. Their word cannot be trusted!",rGCdKspFhzssoRzPwqWh-g,1,0,1,xYwoH1OofoeI6kYLDCKYcQ

The biryani came at a nice big portion and very flavorful I could taste all the spices and I ate it with raita to mellow out the spicyness, however level 8 is not as spicy as you think!

Their kheer (rice pudding), Tikka Masala, goat curry, and eggplant dishes, and spinach (saag) are great. The saag is where they shine and it is spicier and has more kick than what I had at Taj Palace and that's a good thing because the saag at Taj palace is very bland compared to this! Also try the galub jamun... which is like super awesome pancake balls swimming in syrup.

I just wish they had Pav Bhaji. Right now there is only one place in town that REALLY makes and markets their Pav Bhaji and that's Urban Turban.

Aside from that, Angara's staff are the friendliest I've ever encountered. This one dude is smiling all the time so much to the point I actually thought he was on anti-depressants.

We ordered a tandoori mixed grill, butter chicken, the yogurt sauce, tons of naan (garlic and their spicy green pepper naan), tikka Marsala and a few other things. My favorite dishes were the butter chicken and the chicken tikka! I ventured out and tried plenty of other Indian places but this one is still my favorite! Recently I cut out meat products. The restaurant was more than happy to accommodate. They have a lot of veggie options but I asked if they could change the butter chicken instead. I expected just a few veggies if anything but they put in cauliflower, zucchini, and tofu that was flavored so well it tastes better than the original! I also got their vegetarian potato dumplings (can't remember the name) but they were dusted with this curry powder and when dipped in the green chutney they provide... so good!

We walked in and we were the only diners, which i thought was odd. We were immediately greeted by a host and sat down at a comfy booth. The host took our naan order (garlic) and we got waters and one manjo lassi drink to share.  The magno lassi was delicious. The selection of food is nice and the plates aren't too big so it really helps to limit the amount of food each diner can take so people don't waste food. I tried the samosas, palak paneer, chicken tikka masala, and vegetable pakora. EVERYTHING WAS DELICIOUS. Even my daughter tried almost everything on our plates. The taste was great. It could've been hotter, but the food was not cold. The samosas are so amazing and the naan was also great as it was not too doughy or thick. It was flakey and light with a nice amount of garlic. Overall we were very happy and will be coming back soon. Our alternative would be Delhi indian buffet, but it's way further from us and this place has all of my favorite items. They serve fish pakora too, but i didn't try it. Best of all they serve hot gulab jamon in syrup, which is my favorite dessert. Check this place out! They are doing it right! I hope they get busier and stay for awhile. I'm happy to say that several more people came in after us that also seemed to be first timers.",2e-_BVPBowP4ccOA1Lw1Ew,2,0,5,ZulLS4vzedduBP2toQAzNQ

I have eaten here several times in the last few months and I cannot say enough great things about the staff. They truly make the dining experience exceptional. 

For this vegetarian, I appreciate the many options available and that they change the dishes frequently. I have my favorites for sure but enjoy trying the new selections. I love the cabbage with mustard seasoning. Never knew this was an indian dish, but I love it. The samosas are perfect every time and I have enjoyed the eggplant dish, potatoes and cauliflower, and the chick peas!

My only reason for not giving 5 stars is the inconsistency in the quality of food. The saag is consistently way too salty and way too hot. I put it on my plate each visit and each visit I taste it and am so disappointed. I can't remember the name of the vegetarian dish with the vegetables in yellow sauce, but this dish needs to be made with fresh vegetables and not the frozen cut vegetables mostly used. Often, I can taste the old freezer burn and it too is disappointing. It tastes like frozen vegetables were simply dumped in a sauce. I know your cook can do better. I ate a potato dish once visit in which it was over seasoned with cloves to the point where I found at least 5 hard cloves in one small scoop serving. 

Yesterday's visit was one of my least favorable experiences where the food was not very good at all. I was not there early or late, and the food was fresh on the line, but out of 6 vegetarian dishes, only 2 were edible. The other 5 were over salted compared to usual and the spinach dish continues to be a hot level of 7 on a scale from 1-5. 

i will continue to visit because I'm sure this restaurant has the potential to be a 5 star experience. Make a couple minor adjustments like using real vegetables instead of frozen, add new dishes with chick peas or peas, paneer, eggplant etc. reduce the salt (since the wonderful spices are enough to carry the dish). 

Definitely give this place a try!",gRBnMm0uB1-nekt8xyOyLg,1,0,4,hQWZrUqCKnDg7ABx2kJnCQ

We poured over the menu, and finally decided on...
Mango Curry - ($12.99) Slightly sweet and spicy. This dish had fabulous flavor but overwhelmed with too much ""heat"". It was perfect.

Chicken Tiki Marsala - ($14.99) This one had a little more heat, but not too spicy at all. It was rich, creamy and flavorful! A great rendition of one of my favorite Indian dishes

Aloo Gobi - ($11.99) Cauliflower and potatoes. This was a nice dish as well. 

Garlic Nan - ($2.99) YUM. You can't go wrong with a great nan!

And a side of Riata - ($3.99) A creamy yogurt and cucumber sauce.

Angara is on Grand Canyon behind McDonalds, next door to Tropical Smooth and two doors from Bite. 

Buffets is available only during lunch and is only $10.99/person. If you have never had Indian food, this is a very good deal and allows you to try all the popular Indian dishes. In fact, I recommend trying a little bit of everything. The staff at Angara is very helpful. If you wanna know about a dish, they are more than happy to answer your questions.

As you are seated, you are offered two types of naan, plain or garlic. I chose plain as I had to return to the office, and I wanted to be sure I could taste the flavors of the other dishes.

At the beginning of the buffet, they have large sized samosas (my all time favorite, Indian pastry filled with potatoes and peas),  followed by the vegetarian entrees like Saan paneer (my all time favorite Indian vegetarian dish, creamy spinach with cheese cubes),  lentil and eggplant dishes. I'm not a hot/spicy dish person. In the past, I have known saan paneer as a mild dish, but Angara makes it spicy that I had to eat it with the naan instead of the rice. 

Unfortunately, because I filled up on the samosa, vegetarian dishes, rice and naan, the only meat dish I could get to was the chicken tikka. Proof that one can get very full on vegetarian dishes alone. Next time, I'll have to start with the meats. Other meat dishes available were chicken tandoori and goat curry. One dish I wish they had is fried fish bites.

At the end of the buffet were desserts that I'm unfamiliar with, but will try in a future visit, and  regular house salad which baffles me with all the vegetarian dishes available, but to each his/her own.",leyNDNVu09Ldbg5ujPWMhQ,3,2,4,RZ1NrneyCQp7CTWOhQdY3A

I came here today to try the buffet. The buffet is a bargain at $10.99. I was happy to see they have goat curry. The garlic naam was crisp, and tender.  Some of the items they have on the buffet are Tandoori Chicken, chicken korma, bhindi masala, saag paneer, chicken tikka masala. The dessert  was Gulab gamun. They really meet the challenge of maintaining such an good selection of dishes at the buffet.

First off I absolutely love the decor. Elegant, clean and peaceful. Secondly the l service was excellent. Our waiter was attentive, kind and knowledgable. And the food? Delicious. Been missing good Indian food since I moved out to Vegas. 

I had never heard of Handi Chicken before but I'm glad we gave it a try. Fresh onions, bell peppers and chicken mixed with a delicious ginger garlic sauce. Just yummy. We also had to get the staple Chicken Tikka Masala and it was exactly how I like it. Not too sweet like I've had at some places. The chicken was tender and the sauce was perfectly creamy. Combined with the Garlic Naan and basmati rice I was simply in heaven. Oh and the hubby got a glass of the mango lassi that I ended up drinking half of because it was too good to stop.

I was told to sit anywhere I wanted--all the tables are for four people so I had a large table to myself.  Rani came and cleared the extra place settings and asked me for my preference of naan.  In addition, he asked me about drink other than water and I ordered and iced tea.

My first plate was a small plate with one large samosa, palak paneer, and some chana masala.  The palak paneer and chana masala had a nice zing to them but it wasn't too spicy that someone would not enjoy them.  The samosa was filled with potato and some peas.  It was very tasty and the crust was flaky.

For my second plate, I got some chicken tikka masala, chicken korma, and basmati rice.  You'll notice no photo for this dish.  I enjoyed the first one so much that I just started eating and no photo.  The chicken was good.  I especially liked the chicken korma so when I went back for a third, smaller plate, I got more chicken korma along with goat curry and some sautéed cabbage because that seemed so different for an Indian restaurant.

We ordered the standard Lamb Kebab, Panner tikka and Chicken curry with a couple of rotis.
Food quantity  is small. compared to the price. So if you have a average eating appetite then these servings are small. You will need more, which means the bill goes up - items are really pricy - lamb kebab were $17.99 for 8 small pieces of lamb, Chicken curry was $14.99 less then 16 ounce of curry - oh also there is no rice included, this is a pricy menu 

The taste, was OK, nothing that would stand out. Maybe to new Indian cuisine diner it maybe a great, but for Indians this is an outright average north indian flavor. 
Service,was great, that is why I give it three stars, otherwise it would be lower. There was only one employee, on duty, and he was the server + busser + matre-de all in one. He was prompt, respectful and efficient.

4484442,2018-05-13,2,ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg,"Dinner tonight seemed like it was going to be a little rocky. But by the time we left, we were fans.

We eat late, as do many Indians, so we were a bit surprised that an hour before closing, the only two occupied tables were preparing to leave. We thought it wasn't a good sign, but the dinner experience turned out to be wonderful.

Service improved as time went on. The two TVs had Bollywood playing, and I noticed that the subtitles were in transliterated Hindi. Our waiter, Norain (sp?), cheerfully explained that Indians now use English characters instead of the Hindi ones when typing on their cellphones. He also helped me with pronunciation. As a language freak, I was thrilled to be enjoying a great dinner and learning something at the same time!

All the wines are Cupcake, a common brand that was unfamiliar to me, and I enjoyed my Riesling.

We like to order thalis, which lets us sample a variety of the foods offered. Not ever Indian restaurant offers them, but they were on the menu, vegetarian and non-. We had an Entertainment book coupon, and many Indian restaurants have allowed us to apply the value of the coupon to a thali, but not here. We were a bit miffed, especially when we discovered that rice was not included with the entrees, and was $4 extra. But the dishes we ordered, the Coconut Curry Chicken and Lamb Buna, were ample, and the rice was also a large portion. We also had Garlic Naan, which was perfectly prepared. The two entrees were delicious, and the lamb was incredibly tender and had virtually no fat.

The background music - which didn't match the Bollywood on the TVs - was very pleasant, and the ambience is relaxing.

Angara is a bit pricey, but the quality of the food is outstanding, and we'll go back for sure.",m-BZLIIh5PCAKnzH0qj_0Q,11,5,4,7SgE0zn29W1jcpJakp4xwA

The gentleman did ask which naan we preferred, and I immediately requested garlic and we were not disappointed. I was not sure what to expect and I hate to waste food, so I started off with one vegetable samosa, one spoonful of navratan korma, one spoonful of aloo gobi, and one spoonful of saag paneer, and bismati rice. My mouth was happier than Mary Poppins with a new umbrella! 

The samosa was my favorite, especially dipped in the chutney and I definitely went back for another. The runner up was the aloo gobi as I am normally a huge saag fan and not big on cauliflower.

Not to mention, it's taken the place of Custom Built, a build-your-own-pizza place that we used to love and frequent, so this location had some large shoes to fill... And I'm glad to say that it didn't disappoint! We thoroughly enjoyed our first dining experience here!

Our dinner started off well with some complimentary samosas! Who wouldn't want that? The outside was crisp and flaky, the inside--a rich flavor, packed with potato and peas, and it had a good amount of heat! If you're not too into spicy food, they're really nice about toning it down for ya. Our table had the garlic naan, saag paneer, tikka masala, vegetable rice, and mango lassi.

The garlic naan was just as expected! Light in texture, but flavorful. The saag paneer was probably my least favorite, but the tikka masala made up for that. The paneer was a little bit harder than I was used to, though it was great in flavor nonetheless. I would definitely order it again! The vegetable rice went perfectly with everything we had ordered, and the mango lassi was creamy and had just the right amount of sweetness!

The space is clean, well decorated, and customer service is great. Our waters were always refilled, and specific requests didn't seem to be too troubling. For lunch, they serve buffet style from 11 to 3, and dinner is restaurant style from 5 to 10. We are happy to have Angara in the neighborhood!

Indian food is probably in my top three favorite types of food, but Indian lunch buffets are a funny thing.  Even top-notch Indian restaurants can have lame buffets.  Many use lower quality meats, naan or simply have a scant selection.  An Angara, neither of those things are true.  

It's set up into three sections:  Vegetarian, Meat and Salad.  Each section had plenty to choose from and everything was high quality.  

One of things that stands out is that they bring you fresh naan with your choice of either plain or garlic.  Many Indian buffets will keep a lower quality naan on the line, but here they bring the real thing.  

They had a wonderful selection of chicken: Tikka Masala, Korma and Tandori.  The vegetarian section has super tasty Lentil, Chickpea and other veggie selections that were dynamite.  Oh, and the veggie samosas were awesome. 

You really can't go wrong for the price and now I'm looking forward to going for a dinner.",qmYullp32aXFUr8WMVFrOA,2,0,5,m0T0R4UERM3wK-vqsbnS2w

I am not convinced that bringing a bloodhound would've helped me detect the garlic in the garlic naan. The goat meat must've been grass fed because it was mostly bony. I honestly don't remember eating anything there that I could think of. It was a mish mash of flavors. The rice dessert which most Indian restaurants do well is not done too well here. Too much noodle. Stick with Everest if you live in Summersville. And yes, they finally refilled our glasses of water after we paid the bill. My friend paid for lunch but I probably would've added Abe Lincoln to the coinage. Not paper Abe but copper Abe.

The last time I ordered I put in the comments on Grubhub ""MILD PLEASE MILD""... and it arrived so, so spicy. So spicy I actually called and complained (but didn't ask for a refund).

This time, I ordered the same exact order and put ""MILD PLEASE MILD"" -- and called the restaurant immediately after placing the order to confirm I wanted the saag and masala MILD. The manager assured me they got the note.

Alas, the food arrived and it is SPICY AF. I'm guessing they probably make large quantities of each entree and can't or won't make custom orders. 

As a person the eats Sriracha by the tub-fulls, and Tabasco as a sweet treat, I can honestly say the spice of this place is on fleek if that's your jam.

First noticed after a disappointing visit to Cinnaholic, but occupying the shopping center at 4165 South Grand Canyon Drive since late 2015, it was based on positive words from trusted palates that the Lunch Buffet at Angara was explored on Saturday, a well-culled selection of traditional Indian dishes all showing well and service on par with other like concepts.

Cleanly designed and smaller than the likes of Everest or Delhi, the main dining area lined with tables and booths arranged beneath colorful murals and textured wallpaper, it was minutes past 11:00am that Suite 105 was found empty save for two others, the space quick to fill afterward and also apparently quite popular for takeout based on five orders over the course of an hour including at least one sent out via Bite Squad.

Playing regionally appropriate music at low volume, the Bollywood-style Videos always a source of amusement for those unfamiliar, it was after requesting Butter Naan over Garlic that the line-up of dishes was explored, a total of three section presenting just fifteen dishes along with an equal number of Vegetables, Chutneys, Dips and Condiments.

Not wasting time in getting started, plates in two sizes plus bowls available to avoid mixing, it was just as warm Bread arrived that a plate containing Spinach Saag plus Warm Okra with Potatoes and Onions was obtained, the former boldly-spiced but mellowed by Cream while the later found its primary constituent cooked snappy, the blend of spices pleasant and all aspects of the dish superior to American-South versions that often come across bland or soggy.

Enjoying Papadam with housemade Chutney as a sort of palate cleanser between plates, the Tamarind a bit overpowering but complex and chunky Mango quite refreshing, it was marveling at the first of three crispy Samosas that Water was refilled without having to ask, a matter of good timing as plate two featured moist Tandoori Chicken and mild Tikka Masala alongside Goat Curry almost entirely devoid of Bones but full of supple Meat plus robust spicing heavy in Coriander, Cloves and Scotch Bonnet Chiles.

Alternating between Meat and Vegetarian options, the fact that Rice dishes make up 20% of Angara's Buffet no doubt part of its low cost of just $11.99 per diner, it was shrugging off clearly frozen Peas that the Pulao came across pleasantly herbal alongside Vegetable Korma thick with Paneer and Nuts, each bite as creamy and comforting as it was delicious while the cooked Cabbage and Chickpeas heavily perfumed by Ginger were unremarkable but not necessarily bad.

Wrapping up savories with Chicken Curry, the flavor profile virtually identical to Angara  India Spice Grill's Goat version, it was after more Papadam and Samosa that two Desserts were enjoyed, the Kheer a bit thinner than versions served elsewhere while the Gulab Jamun were soft and spongy in their floral and sweet bath.

*** Too limited to rank among Las Vegas' best Indian Buffets Angara India Spice Grill nonetheless presents their spread well and at a fair price, the limitations in quantity largely offset by quality but the lack of more than four Meat choices - three of them Chicken and one virtually identical to the Goat dish - probably not enough to bring many guests back.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,14,8,3,CnwfgS0hzdC4MprozQvm5Q

Everything was fresh and prepared exactly how we had requested so we were excited to be back. We live in Henderson and made the drive here to eat here again. We walked into this restaurant around 9pm for dinner with my parents and grandparents. We ordered a very basic dinner of Dal Makhani, Chicken tikka masala, Tandoori chicken, a couple of roti and a garlic naan. It's really hard for us to judge spice levels in some Indian restaurants so we always order medium. When the tandoori chicken arrived it was bland, and I mean like completely bland to the point where we were drowning it in mint chutney. We asked our server to change the spice level on our entrees since medium was bland. So food arrived and guess what. It was bland! We asked the server whether he had changed the spice level in the kitchen and we didn't quite get a clear answer. My grandmother tasted the Dal and she almost spit it back out on her plate and stated that it tasted old like it had been reheated and the consistency was off as well. Dal is supposed to be bisque like consistency and it was just this unappetizing blob. The owner happened to be around and my dad told him that the food was terrible. The owner offered no apologies but instead offered to reheat the dal and make it spicier. We quietly finished our ""dinner"" and made it very clear to the server that we wouldn't be back he didn't seem to care. My grandfather hated it so much that he actually said eating off the Dollar Menu at McDonalds would've been a better dinner. Needless to say I wouldn't return to this place ever again.

5636422,2017-07-18,0,ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg,"This review regards delivery service and the food I received. I have not yet visited Angara Indian Spice Grill in person.

I had issues with the actual delivery. That's not the restaurant's fault, nor is it Eat24's nor Yelp's. I've dealt with the issue through Eat24's excellent customer support. Thanks, Suckie and Josh!

This is the second time I've ordered Indian Delivery, and the second restaurant I've ordered delivery from. I had the Chicken Korma, the Chicken Tikka, plain naan, and those funny little fried doodles that I can never remember the name of.

This is why I withheld one star: Can't ANY Indian restaurant in Las Vegas make a curry mild when the  menu SAYS ""mild"" and even offers you options for spiciness? All the food was very flavorful; not one dish (except the naan, of course) was ""mild."" I like spicy food, but my tolerance for it has weakened as I grow older (don't tell me this hasn't happened to you or someone you know!).

Okay.
The fried thingies: oddly bland, even though the batter was SPICY.
Chicken tikka: Surprisingly moist and tender! Beautiful color. SPICY.
Chicken Korma: Subtle blend of flavors, noted as MILD on the menu, but guess what? It was SPICY!
Naan: a bit dry, missing that buttery caress. This was the only thing that was NOT spicy. 

Even the tamarind sauce was SPICY!

Bottom line: I will order from here again, but only when I'm in the mood for a mouth-searing meal. The flavors were excellent, and I could eat the Chicken Tikka every night for a week, and even make sandwiches from it (think cucumber slices and raita on a folded naan or in a pita). But I'll continue my search for an Indian restaurant that is more in line with my perception of ""mild,"" ""medium,"" and ""SPICY!""

So
5 stars minus 1, because you pretty much want something mild when you order something that's described, in the menu, as mild!",UL4bxNpzHk5V-xDrF7H5fA,1,0,4,hoISZl2WkfNGN69YNF5qIg

You get the usual choices in the buffet: tandoori, tikka masala, saag, veggie korma. The chicken korma was a new one. Piping hot naan and lots of ice in the glass of water which was refilled without having to ask. Never understand why some Indian places serve luke warm water with no ice. Best part is you can have both kheer and gulab jamen for dessert and they were great. Only negative was the TV that was blasting some Bollywood version of Sabado Gigante (idiocy).

First and foremost, they had a very clean and welcoming environment. The buffet section had a good amount of dishes ranging from a small salad bar to the main entrees. We got to meet the chef William, who was very friendly and made a point to chat with every customer that was in the restaurant. He told us that Monday's are he best days to come for the buffet since the selections often change every day. I got to try nearly every dish (except for the goat curry) and of course my favorite was the masala. Every dish was seasoned and cooked perfectly! You can really taste the spiciness without it overpowering the actual dish. When it came to dessert, I had the gulab jamun (which is essentially a milk-based fried ball in syrup) and the tamarind chutney. Both super delicious, although I do not recommend eating them together since both flavors are profoundly on opposite spectrums. 

Overall, I would absolutely recommend this restaurant to anyone that loves or wants to try Indian food. & by the way, the buffet was only $10.99. Very good deal!",rtOP1AmOHbZv9yQ7VI8InA,6,1,5,URiEggj0R3mSl1kxN3QNHA

5727095,2016-03-30,0,ZJ0gQp0fcnIDiZv0m9--Gg,"It pains me to write a negative review of this place, having had some good experiences here in the beginning but after several VERY disappointing meals delivered both by bitesquad and taken to go, I felt the need to share my experience in the hopes the owners/chef make some changes. I will add, I am relatively new to Indian food so I don't proclaim to be an expert. Our first visit was very good, I thought the Naan bread was a little thin and overdone, but improved on the second batch and later visits. Butter chicken was initially good, but after the second or third visits, then ordering take out and delivery on two occasions the quality dropped significantly. This last order, I was really craving butter chicken and begged my husband to give them another shot - hoping this would be the turnaround meal. We ordered the garlic shrimp, butter chicken, jasmine rice (because the last time we ordered the peas pilau we actually got vegetable rice instead.) The garlic shrimp was not what we expected, full of bell pepper, onions and no hint of garlic - but being newer to Indian cuisine I'm sure that error was based on our expectation versus the reality of this dish. On the flip side the menu didn't describe the dish in any way, so that's really what my review is based on. The real reason for my poor review though is based on the butter chicken. The pieces of chicken are pathetically small and sparse. On top of that, there was gristle and cartilage in this last batch, and the consistency is seasoning has been very all over the place. Going from almost too hot to eat at a spice level of 2 to bland and no heat at a 1. I was initially excited about this place and the people that work/own the place are really nice and sweet. But IMO there's no excuse for charging $14.99 for a dish with barely any chicken and with some seriously poor quality control.",H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw,2,0,2,G61kW9ukOcZKWDBFsdsaGg

The entrees were way over-spiced (details below) while the Garlic Naan was flavorless. Normally I like spicy food (and so does my eldest son) but since we wanted to share with my youngest and my wife we only asked for a spice level of 3 (on the 1-10 scale the waiter told us) - but both the Lamb Curry and Shrimp Saag were too spicy to eat! I can't recall paying $14.99 for a small entrée and then leaving 80% on the plate (and no one wanted a to-go container on it). My youngest ordered Chicken Biryani with the least spice possible (1 on a 1-10 scale) and it was too spicy for 3 of 4 diners to eat. The waiter was good - and he put in the orders correctly, as the receipt reflects the correct spice levels - but the cook made every entrée radically spicy. If they said up front ""every meal is super spicy"" that would be one thing, but to pretend that you can tailor the spice level and then serve the spiciest rice I have ever had (when the customer ordered the lowest) doesn't work. Also a bit pricy - $15 entrée does not include even steamed rice (extra $4). So in the end it was more expensive than other Indian food here in Las Vegas, and less edible.
