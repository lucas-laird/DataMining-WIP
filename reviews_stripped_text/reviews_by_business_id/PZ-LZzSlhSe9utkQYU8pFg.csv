It always seemed to have an old school vibe which I like. Picked up my uncle for an early dinner and he suggested  Carluccio's, he said it was very good. Works for me. Really cool decor, very nice and attentive staff. I had the ceasar salad which was cold and dressed perfectly. I think the crutons may have been homemade. Moved onto the meat stuffed ravioli which was great. The portions are large as one expects at Italian and Mexican restaurants. Had to take half home and eat the next day.

the food is moderately good. i've had way worse, but it's not amazing. the red sauce is somewhat bland and slightly tangy, which is definitely not my style.

the portion size was huge. we had the veal florentine and chicken parmesan. the veal was so super tender and moist. the chicken was alright. 

was it worth it just for the strange Liberace ambiance and casual no frills attitude? absolutely. it looks like this was the place where all the mobsters would eat. flashing bulbs on the ceilings and brown brick walls with yellow windows. everyone in the place was having a great time, laughing it up, getting loud and boisterous, which is a good sign.

i admit it, the next morning i wished i hadn't wasted a vegas meal on this place, but i'll surely never forget it. i think the lights have been burned into my memory forever.",15TfRqjx-2nW52XC4aSkUA,2,0,3,R31Czy9phIJmGc3wbJ7dNQ

If you are looking for a tasty meal but don't want to spend a fortune (and it's very easy to do that in Vegas Strip restaurants!), this is a great place just a few minutes East of the strip on Tropicana.  

It's very popular, and a lot of locals eat there (we saw cast members from one of the shows), and the interior is whimsically designed by Liberace - mirrors, strings of white lights dangling from everything, Italian fountains.  The recorded music features showtunes and jazz standards sung by greats such as Frank Sinatra, Bobby Darin, and even Rod Stewart, but I believe they have live music as well (maybe during happy hour).  It's dark in the dining area, but the thousands of string lights and candles on the table create a nice romantic glow.  

The food was very yummy, and very inexpensive for how good it was.  I had the Cavatelli pasta (a curved tubular pasta  a little like Penne with a break in it) with Marinara and CLEANED my plate.  My husband had spaghetti with meat sauce and mushrooms, and he liked his a lot as well.  We shared fried calamari with marinara.  The pasta dishes were $9 each, and my husband took most of his home!  

We love Italian food, and for the price, this is one of the best in Vegas.  We barely spent $30 for the both of us, which is great because we went to an Italian restaurant in a hotel restaurant on the Strip, and spent $50 per person!!  I wish we had gone to Carluccio's for Valentine's Day, because the ambience is romantic yet fun.  It is nothing fancy, but they do basics very well.  I would like to go back to try their fish dishes (other entrees are priced between $12 and $20).

I finally got around to eating here last weekend as part of my date night. We hadn't read anything about it and, thus, had no idea what to expect. As soon as we walked in, we were in love. This place perfectly represents that image of ""old Vegas"" I have in my head. It was outlandish while also warm and welcoming. I could just picture Liberace eating here. I could also imagine the Rat Pack, mobsters, etc. eating here as it just seemed so fitting of all of them.

We started off our dining experience with the calamari. Unfortunately, it wasn't even edible. We had little doubt that it came straight out of a box from the frozen food aisle. 1 star. For entrees, I opted for the cavatelli (it had an icon indicating it as one of their signature dishes) and my husband had the gnocchi. The menu described the cavatelli as ""sauteed"" and with meat sauce. What I was served was neither sauteed nor meat sauce. I almost asked if I was served the wrong thing, but since our server was the wife of the owner, I felt bad saying anything. The pasta was too mushy, the sauce wasn't very good at all, and I barely tasted any cheese. My date declared it inedible. I nibbled at it a bit, but refused a take home box. 1 star. My date's gnocchi was ok, but also not cooked properly. 2 stars. And 1 star too for the wine list.

At the end of our meal, our server explained the history of the restaurant and gave us the lay of the land so to speak. It was great to walk around and see all the different rooms (love the bar area!) and all of the pictures (especially the ghost pictures). The place itself is most definitely 5 stars. And that fact alone will bring us back here and have us recommending it to visitors.",YMgZqBUAddmFErxLtCfK_w,2,0,3,ArL4pdlaqGDXKQEC_ekzhg
2134340,2011-07-17,0,PZ-LZzSlhSe9utkQYU8pFg,"I've been always wanting to try Carluccio's -- I'm an often Vegas tourist who likes to explore nook-and-cranny museums, eateries et al (I know life is more than the Strip) -- I have the opportunity to finally get there over July 4th weekend.  All you need to know is that I did so in 111 degrees and via bus -- and it was oh so well worth it!

First, the service and staff were wonderful -- I'd been seated maybe 5 minutes and looking at the menu when another server (or manager) insisted on making sure I got some water because I looked like I'd ""been out in the sun.""  For an older restaurant, the service was anything but attitudewise -- very enthusiastic, friendly, knowledgeable...very homey.

Foodwise, wow, for the choices and taste and also for the reasonable prices.  I had the stuffed shrimp, which came witha side of pasta (I wanted to try the sauce, plus I ordered a side of meatballs) along with a  casesars salad.  For dessert I had to try -- or shall I say, ingest -- a homemade cannoli.   All food items were exceptionally tasteful, authentic, unique, flavorful...and the homemade bread was yummy as well.  Plus I did check out the lounge area for all the celb pics and piano bar and all the historical things (thanks to other reviewers for suggesting).

Just an all-around great dinning experience after a scorching hot day of playing tourist.  Totally hit the spot.

I have tried so many items lasagna, raviolis cheese and meat, Zuppa de Clams,on and on. I have never been disappointed with anything I have ordered. The homemade bread is amazing. My husband loves the chicken parmigiana and it is the most tender chicken I have ever tasted. You can tell they tenderize it properly in the kitchen.

2276762,2007-08-23,3,PZ-LZzSlhSe9utkQYU8pFg,"We asked our hotel concierge for a restaurant recommendation.  She said there's a place off the strip where you can get excellent cheap Italian food.  She said, ""I'm Italian"" and I love it and all my out of town guests always ask to go there.  So we said what the heck, beats paying a fortune for a mediocre meal at one of the big fancy hotel restaurants.  

The first note about Carluccio's is it is right next door to the Liberace Museum.  Las Vegas is such a bizarre place.  Any way, the interior is a flash back to to the 80's and still kind of charming in that bizarre Las Vegas sort of way.  It was also dark inside, which was a good thing, because they would get negative stars for the cleanliness factor.  Our bread basket and the inside of my menu had globs of marinara sauce on them.  Tasty....um, no....disgusting.

The bread was outstanding.  It was just bread, with no fancy dipping oil or vinegar. Just good solid bread with butter.  Side salad...blech.  Bottle of Pinot Grigio...yummy (friend pointed out it could be bought at Costco for half the price we paid).  Mushroom appetizer...good in concept...mushrooms in white wine sauce topped with cheese and baked.  Not so good in execution as the wine sauce was tangy and harsh.  Chicken parmigiana entree, pretty tasty.  It was served with a side of pasta with meat sauce containing very little meat to speak of.  I tried my friend;s gnocchi and it was doughy tasting (not in a good way)!  We skipped dessert.

Service was poor, but what do you expect when  you can get a bottle of wine, 3 entrees, 3 side salads and an appetizer for less than $80 (the wine was half the bill at $40).  

This place would be great for a group of people who want decent food for cheap.  Plus Liberace is next door.  That's a big draw right there!  Or not...",aKDe5qvoYT_1jdMOalehmQ,2,1,2,gVEdwH0VJ5s1oiRS6VfkaA

Calories be damned this time I went for the Shrimp Alfredo - which was absolutely stellar.  Wide ribbon noodles in a decadent, thick alfredo sauce that was seriously one of the best I've ever had.  The portions are HUGE - so I have left-overs for lunch today!  My husband had the Shrimp Oreganado which looked fabulous with a side of spaghetti - he liked it so much he polished it off.  He may as well have licked the plate. 

If you go - don't forget to take a peek in the piano lounge (supposedly the most haunted room in Vegas according to the magician performing there).   A charming room with twinkle lights in the ceiling, a piano-shaped bar, classic white Eero Saarinen Tulip chairs, and a fabulous mirrored piano a la Liberace!  Thursday happy hour has live music too!  Prices are reasonable - our party of four got out for half of what we paid a month ago at Casa Di Amore down the street.

Anyplace named ""I Lov it"" spelled backward by Liberace is worth a try especially if you remember his shows. 

We went as a group and sat in the piano bar room. The owner was happy to show us all of the great Liberace memorabilia and where when the place was owned by Liberace he liked to sit. 

Our food was fantastic! I had the chicken livers tarragon. This was the recommendation of our server for something unique from their menu. It was fantastic tremendously filling with lots of garlic, butter, good wine, and perfectly prepared tender livers. If you are a fan of liver (I know it is not everyone's favorite) this is the meal for you. 

Kelly our bartender knows all of the classic cocktails and talked us into trying an Italian margarita. She also can make the champagne drinks Liberace loved so much. This is a great place for a good classic cocktail. 

The restaurant is not your typical pub for Las Vegas. No video poker machines, no blaring televisions, you go here and talk to the rest of your party. Compared to the strip food the portions are generous and reasonably priced. 

Families are welcome and seated in a separate section of the restaurant for a traditional family dinner. Then we saw some secret booths at the front which reminded us of down-low mob meeting places where nobody is going to see you spill the goods to the feds.

Embarrassing that having lived in Vegas, I had no idea Carluccio's existed. Some friends from Phoenix came down and wanted to meet at Carluccio's for a group dinner. When I arrived at the parking lot, I was in awe. This place was ostentatious and gorgeous....just the way I like it. I felt like I was in on an old Vegas secret and someone was going to hand me a briefcase full of cash for me to do something illegal with. Carluccio's is right next to the Liberace museum (something I need to go see) and apparently Liberace designed the interior. The interior was gold all over, hanging lights, dark lighting, dark carpets....I loved it. This is a great place to have a small dinner/family gathering. 

Now for the food/service. Service was average. My water glass was always full, the waiter took our order fast and the service was pleasant. Unfortunately, the waiter we had made me nervous. I asked if the Caesar salad was vegetarian and he said yes. Then I confirmed if it had anchovies (as many authentic Ceasars do) and he said ""Oh yeah...it does."" But he was quick to tell me the other dressings that would suit me. The food also took forever to come out. I ordered a mixed green salad with thousand island (side salad) and an eggplant parmigiana. The mixed green came with about a gallon of thousand island on it rendering it inedible. I like my dressing but I also like to see my salad. Perhaps I should have ordered dressing on the side but I did not expect that much. The eggplant parmigiana (served with spaghetti with marinara) was very good. Fried to the right extent and with a gorgeous piece of melted mozzarella on top and drowned in tasty marinara, this was comfort food that hit all the right stops. 

Everyone else on the table thoroughly enjoyed their meals. The portion sizes were huge. I mean, I could have eaten my parmigiana for about 4 meals. No exaggeration here. I later realized that they do have half orders for some of the menu. So ask about that if you're a light eater. The meal was also priced very very reasonably. My parmigiana was 12.99 and my husband's spaghetti with marinara was 8.99. 

The dinner also came with a magician who entertained us for a little bit. The guy was pretty good at what he did (card tricks, disappearing money that appears somewhere incredible later) and added to a fun night. 

Highly recommend this place for a unique group event/dinner. I'm definitely coming when my girlfriends make a trip here. I know they'd appreciate the decor (over-the-top and dark). I'd like to mention here that some girls at the group ordered cocktails that were apparently awful. The waiter did take the cocktails back.

Huge piece came out!  I doubt you could eat much more than that portion.  She took half of it to go.  My dad ordered a shrimp and spinach dish (I can't remember the name of it).  I tried a couple bites and it was very good.  I had this shrimp and garlic dish (can't remember the specific name of it either) but it was very good.

The meatballs and sauce were bland and there was probably a quarter of a cup of pasta water in my plate.  I didn't bother complaining.  I think they lost a customer.",Sv1C8Uly4dO1qtytcGMbyg,1,0,1,dqK1zY3n0MraVX78NBKXXQ
4531603,2010-04-05,1,PZ-LZzSlhSe9utkQYU8pFg,"Be forewarned: they are very heavy in their sauces, and you can order light sauce. This would have been helpful to us if we had known before hand. 

With that being said, this place was a disappointment.  It's Italian food with upscale pricing, but low scale food quality. I've never been to an Italian restaurant where they serve prepackaged butter with their bread sticks. The food was covered in their sauce, and it looks like you received a bowl of sauce. They do serve a lot of food, and we were like every table there: taking food home in a container. 

The ambiance was very dark and loud. Dress ranged from formal to tshirt casual. The staff was very friendly, though. 

In the end, I don't think I'd make another visit here on my next Vegas trip.",mPU5Ar0NBOw_d95tIfTM0w,1,0,2,zwy5zZKCB66DMPmxr4FEgQ

PS.  Don't call old Vegas tacky, it's Fabulous Las Vegas, not ""7 shades of Beige"" Las Vegas.

We were able to drop the  cake off early and they stored it for us. Wine was on the tables and food was delish. We had a couple options to choose from. It was perfect for my grandparents as they are fans when coming to Las Vegas from california!!,98VVHG8CpPDf2zbSHqaB7w,1,0,5,mhaUb-BBiqAPFme73WFi-Q

5039641,2007-11-01,0,PZ-LZzSlhSe9utkQYU8pFg,"A late sixties year old woman struggled to light a cigarette sitting on a bench below the Carluccio's Tivoli Gardens neon sign high above her.  ""I hate having to come out side to smoke,"" she mumbled pulling her light sweater over her shoulders.   Our party bus pulled into the parking lot and drove past the Liberace Museum and neon grand piano and stopped in front of the smoking Carluccio's regular.  We all streamed out of the bus as she reviewed and evaluated each one of us. ""I bet most of these kids don't even know who Liberace was,"" she mused.  I opened the wood carved door to the Liberace design restaurant and the team entered into a world hip and cool 35 years ago that is now hip and cheeky in 2007.

I travel to Las Vegas at least two times a year for various trade shows for eBay or for various social events.  Like many of my friends, I get tired of the big casino hotspots that we all read about in the hotel room ""Las Vegas"" magazines.   Thankfully, my friend Jennifer found Carluccio's through her parents that live in the area and decided to host our team party there.  Carluccio's was probably THE place to be for Las Vegas hip in the 70s and is now a refreshing escape for those of us looking for something different...yet sill Las Vegas.

Apparently Carluccio's was designed by Liberace and it shows. Each room is a different style from a dark lounge with vinyl booths to an Italian sculpture garden to the all-mirrored back room replete with a bar shaped like a piano and twinkling lights on the ceiling.  Our group from eBay found our way to the mirrored back room where we enjoyed hearty Italian food. Bottles of Chianti housed in the traditional whicker baskets greeted us and were free flowing, accompanied by mozzarella and tomato and fried calamari hors d'oeuvres.  Due to our group (21) size, Carlucci's served a fixed menu including veal parmesan, chicken picatta and Lasagna.  The food was great for the basic Italian fare and the portions are HUGE.  Most of the group only ate half of what was served.  I'd recommend even ordering one entre and splitting it. I had the veal which was a little tough and smothered in sauce and cheese.  That should tell connoisseurs of Italian food that it's not top-line quality.  However,  Henry had the chicken parmesan which he said was good and Beth had the lasagna which she seemed to enjoy.

We were entertained by a great piano bar duet, Gus and Kathy.  Gus is a stage name for C.J. who is a full time plumber in Las Vegas.  Kathy is a long time friend of 30 years who sings with Gus in his ""Off-The Strip"" appearances. Gus, with is long gray pony tail and grey bushy mustache tickled out basic Sinatra tunes and 70s hits like ""Easy Like Sunday Morning."" Kathy chimed-in with ""do-waps"" and chorus versus when appropriate.  My friend Beth requested for me ""Staying Alive"" by the Bee Gees, hoping to elicit a performance reminiscent of Marty and Elaine from ""Swingers.""  However, Gus did not have that song on his laptop that sat on top of his piano serving as his sheet music. Beth was able to get ""More Than A Woman"" played for those of us with a Barry Gibb craving.

After Gus and Kathy's final number, we cleared out of the back room shaking hands with the musical duo and thanking Carlucci's manager for a great experience.  Overall, the food was good...not great.  However, the AMBIANCE and the old-school Las Vegas experience is OFF THE CHARTS.  I HIGHLY recommend taking the $10 cab ride off the strip to experience this restaurant.  I get the feeling most frequent Vegas travelers are not aware of this hidden vinyl and polyester gem.",9RkL3lRhtAkPUIVyB8_07Q,1,1,4,1_ar-XGW3QEOrVLJlZmyyw

Really fantastic red sauce.  I eat the Shrimp Fra Diavolo with the hot marinara.  The veal dishes are really good and what you would expect Italian to be.  Other places get fancy, Carluccio's gets it right.  Best of all they have been around for as long as I've been around.  Nothing has changed.  Every taste is like it was many many years ago.",sDFQazfIy2uWvjrIjtlfLw,1,0,4,6lOZ9zwZO0BvCMzuJMqczQ

The place is by the now derelict Liberace Museum on east Tropicana.  I am guessing it has been here for 20-30 years which is a long time by Vegas standards, so it has some history.  The place has brick walls, old school burgandy colored booths, custom wood door, dark wood in the bar area and I loved the black and red tiles in the bathroom.  

It has a bar area, restaurant area and we sat in the atrium area at a table.  The hostess and waitress were very friendly.  

The menu was typical of a Italian joint.  The prices seemed reasonable.  I ordered the meatballs and sausage plate.  It was a large offering with a side of pasta.  Very tasty - the meat sauce was right on!  I tried a friends chicken parm - that was tasty.  Huge servings at reasonable prices!  

Carlucio's is so not corporate and that's why I really like it!",L15JCA18Ib_vMUVJILxiSw,2,0,4,f0NmA59Qvz0sXHS-wrJu4g

Especially for birthdays!
Everything tasted like wine, the food was beyond great.
The stuffed mushrooms ruled the earth!
The seafood diablo was the shit!!
The chocolate mouse tasted like a shot of booze!

I loved the atmosphere and the classiness. The twinkly white lights, it was so Liberace chic. 
Every room was beautiful, and so was the bar. This was one of the last great las Vegas gems to fade out.

Every time I drive by I get sad.
I was 16 when i had my ""nice"" birthday dinner there. 
I wish this place would just come back!!!!!",owbC7FP8SNAlwv6f9S5Stw,3,0,5,53Zl7X1Fl1TgxAmHyrVWAw
5796492,2008-09-01,0,PZ-LZzSlhSe9utkQYU8pFg,"This place is fun. I gave it an extra star because its next to the Liberace museum. Any place located to close to Liberace MUST be fantastic right? Right. I guess. In any case, the food was just okay, but the portions were pretty ginormous, and the price was right. The joint is off strip, which was a nice change, becuase its relatively peaceful there and the diners all seemed to be locals, except us. And trust, we did stand out. The ambiance is fun with differently themed and decorated rooms depending on your occasion and the bar there is dark as any other in Sin City, but slightly divier. Service was good, albeit a little slow, and all in all the meal was a success. A little wine never hurt anyone.",oGYEaOv0IEUZ6kU3JFe98A,1,0,4,N7HxJSicQPM_EDAaCtxYSQ

It has one of his pianos in the back seating area and the back bar is grand piano shaped. The food is really, really good and the atmosphere hearkens back to the good old days of Vegas when the Rat Pack and the Mob were headliners. I have gone here for the 13 years I have lived her and consider it a must show to visitors who think the Strip is Vegas.
