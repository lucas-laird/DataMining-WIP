Come to get the latter, served hot and fresh, skin-on and lightly salted, with your choice of several spicy and savory sauces. They also have poutine, as well as bratwurst available in chicken or pork, all of which the super-sweet owner, Perry, is happy to tell you about.

The sampler size frites is comparable to a side, with two sauces, just the right size for dining solo. The Green Goddess and Spicy Honey Garlic dipping sauces were both good, but the latter was incredible and I even saved my leftover bit to spread on a sandwich later. There's also a Yelp check-in offer for an additional free sauce if you can't decide.

The bratwurst wasn't quite what I expected, served sliced with the toppings I requested (cheese and sauteed onions) instead of on a bun as I more typically see. Sausage itself was tasty, and the onions were awesome, and there was a small fresh roll included, too. The brats are available as a lunch special between 11am-2pm at extremely reasonable prices based on the number of toppings and sauces you prefer.  Looking forward to coming back to try more!",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,24,16,4,DSMRsBQmKI_vuZLQvBHJCg

It's ran by a super nice guy who, on our visit, took on every role from the kitchen to the register. And he was invested in making sure we had a great time and gave me and my fiance great recommendations. We will be returning!",KUq-JJ2Oz9SM3VYILrt0SA,0,1,5,19m530_Up8mLU6d-IQPTYg

This place serves exceptional bratwursts and Belgian fries (aka frites). The best part is that they offer a unique list of dipping sauces (over 40) to chose from. Decor is cute and the atmosphere is friendly. 

Can be a dangerous place to find yourself in if you live close by! Addictive!",2-AQhftohFmWd1sjjDVhPw,1,3,5,l1sIOY-xZya8lCKELp2o2w

Well it wasn't, however, there were people right on the other side of the door that saw my brother and me and completely  ignored us. Arms length of the door and could've said ""hey, we're  not open..."" for whatever reason, but instead would rather ignore your customer. Rude. Glad he wasted his lunch break for that.",VPVo0fNlqyL9OOilnqoY1g,2,0,1,lOh4zY2sWqflX0zjI5kxwA
4099632,2017-10-08,0,k4eZPetFVwDhbvLqVnRRQw,This place is basically like a nice little cafe for fries lovers. Theres a ton of of different sauces to try to eat with your friends. On certain day you can get $5 a meal. I love all the different flavors. Also this is  Canadian based place. I would totally come here just to snack on fries and do my homework. Its on the first floor in the Campus village. It is definitely a hidden gem since its brand new and nobody really knows it.,cG7-mlCp_cV8gfRC_9LW-Q,2,0,5,z1NuGId01KY3h4nKe8mJNg

I love that it's so close to UNLV. Definitely recommend for students and snackers alike. My fave sauces so far are garlic mayo and green goddess. My only wish is that they offer organic black truffle sauce like Pommes Fritte in the future!",JzDlERzt_wRasVEs2LjS0w,1,3,5,SBbszaz6MR7DuEL8XcTb-A
5093133,2017-09-04,1,k4eZPetFVwDhbvLqVnRRQw,"Oh My Frites!! Where do I start!?! They had me at Belgian Bräts & Frites (Fries) Snuggled by the heart of UNLV off of Maryland Pkwy & Harmon Ave this is a super convenient location for students and everyone to come grab a nice yummy bite to eat during all hours. Easy to find you can see the store and the signs House of Frites from Maryland pkwy as you pass by. There are plenty of parking spots behind the building for you to park at so there will never be a problem with parking shortage like some of the other hot spots. When you come into the store you are greeted with the delicious smell of their Bratwurst and everyone's smiling welcoming faces in the restaurant. I absolutely love their decor inside. The bench on the right side next to the clock against the brick wall with the paintings from Germany is such a nice touch along with the lamp post and lights on the left wall. Definitely selfie worthy while you wait for your food. There are plenty of tables for you to choose from and stools along the left counter tops for you to sit at. 

Now for the delicious Brätwurst & Fries 

Brätwurst were AMAZEBALLS!! Seriously those yummy juicy flavorful Bräts in and around your mouth are what dreams are made of. Perry's recipe is on point!! They are first boiled in beer for more than 6 hours with apples and onions then grilled to perfection before being served with your selected toppings, sauce, and a roll. 

Frites were nice and crispy some kettle like which were my favorites. Fries are made from fresh cut potatoes everyday in the kitchen with the skin still on. I love fries with the skin still on. They are then Double Fried in your choice of Soybean Oil (Vegan Friendly) or Lard. Both choices are scrumptious my favorite naughty pick tho is the double fried Lard fries lol. There are so many sizes for you to choose from starting at sampler size up to Jumbo but if you're really hungry they also offer Family sizes. All fries are served in a cute paper cone and with your choice of 2 sauces. 

Sauces are literally lick the ramekin clean delicious!! They have over 81 sauces and more than 40 for you to choose from!! Seriously so hard to pick a favorite bc I love them all but on the top of my most loved sauce list are the Roasted Garlic, Green Goddess (It's like an avocado ranch sauce), Curry Ketchup, Garlic Mayo, and more after I try them all  

I recommend this place to EVERYONE! For a quick yummy bite in between classes or if you're nearby this is the place to be. Love how everything is served in boxes and paper cones making it easy to take to go. They are now already opened for their soft opening so feel free to stop in. Their GRAND OPENING Date will be on this Friday September 8th 2017!! Join their grand opening celebration with them and enjoy the yummy Bräts & Frites they have to offer  #HouseOfFrites",_2Sa7pq5z2XOUhS9DOCGHw,5,5,5,GtVJpmr9LYy3amYro5eJVw

The prices are decent, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The naked bratwurst gives you two additional sauces that you can get on the side for more fry dipping sauce variety. Overall I really enjoyed their food. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys homemade fries and bratwurst as well as trying different kinds sauces. Cost me around 11 bucks, but I got a large fry and a drink. Worth it!!",YcrkNk0qZwbj2yWJtbIUiQ,1,1,5,8iXOPSQ9BWM0Mgksxx7ywA

Nothing is special about it, just one cup soaked in gravy brown potato fries and can soda for $5 + tax that's it. In-and-out burger animal style fries are 100% better alternative or even McDonalds for less money. Maybe they should change the name of the joint to 'Stay Hungry' anyway lesson leaned never again.",ZpzJROaiJiUCt-bfKwDnew,2,1,1,CZXRHKp7jouzBXBPHlrz5A
