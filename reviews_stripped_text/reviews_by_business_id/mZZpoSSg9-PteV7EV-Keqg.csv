Other lady came up to me after I sat down to say she didn't charge me for items and wanted me to pay. So no problem. I went to pay. This time they charged me too much.  So I went back to the register to tell them.  The first lady said she didn't know how to fix it and the other said the same and also that she wasn't sure of the prices.  Then they came and said they would figure it out. Only to ignore me till I was about to leave. Then they finally offered me something for ""free"". Even though I've actually already overpaid.

They give you huge slices of mango(wish they cut it  a little smaller to eat easier) and mango sherbet. I wish it was more like a smoothie type because there was some empty spots in the cup that the smoothie would fill. Also not enough sherbet in the cup. Last week I tried a Chamango at the swapmeet on pecos and Las Vegas boulevard. They make a mango smoothie and also have diced fresh mango in the drink with a whole lot of chamoy and candy. Definitely give the swap meet a try. very delicious. I give chamango a 3 star for their service. It was quick.although the chamoy was very sour.",Cw50ubvKYbQVf3gLE17A3A,0,0,3,mcfJ6zFKvcwWWhkmM5mm1g

1409433,2017-03-31,1,mZZpoSSg9-PteV7EV-Keqg,"Came here one day while in the area for a quick snack. Had found this place by chance on yelp or something recently and decided to try it. 

A few people sitting down at the tables but doors were open for some ""Fresh"" air but it was kind of hot inside. 

On the menu, it says Chamango is $5.95 without any signs for size. When i had ordered, the guy asked if i wanted a small or large, large being the more popular one. So i opt'ed for a large, thinking it was like 1 or 2 dollars more. The total ended up at $10.35. WTCRAP !? Ok i know im not mexican nor do i know what im walking myself into but damn thats one hell of an upcharge o.o ! the picture looks like a large. When i got my order, large pieces of mango with 2 scoops of mango ice cream topped with a ton of the chamoy syrup. No not everything lightly covered... i literally had a measurable cup amount of chamoy syrup. The mango is unripe but crunchy. Not sure if thats the way they prefer it but its similar to what is preferred in viet dishes. The ice cream is a bit icy but was not overly sweet. Not sure if it was the chamoy syrup that screwed up my tastebuds lol... better to get 2 normal chamangos than 1 large probably. 

unsure if id return in the future.",Ksp1e9Dw0Jcog_ZBD3-45g,3,1,1,baODpjV4ZFGySWKqTKd4BQ
