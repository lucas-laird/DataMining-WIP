I've found small hairs in the bottom of my caniac a few times before. Not a big deal seeing as how I already finished eating. But when your 2 fingers in on a delicious caniac and you take a bite and look at the chicken that you took a bite off of and see an inch and a half, curly, black, shiny hair wrapped around the remains of your chicken finger, you get a little disgusted. It seems as if someone took the time to do the tedious job of wrapping the hair around the chicken finger. They might as well have tied a bow in it to make it look pretty. When I brought my caniac to the counter, I said can I have a new caniac, this one has a big hair in it. (I was showing somewhat of a grin like it was a funny coincidence or a fluke) the employees just looked at me for about 5 seconds without responding so I said ""thank you"" and walked back to my seat and left my meal on the counter. I'm not the rude type but when I get stared at like I'm retarded for not eating some curly pube on my chicken finger I get a little aggravated. The manager was nice enough to walk my new caniac to my table and apologized for the inconvenience. I found that the manager handled the situation correctly but the employees did not, seeing as how i got stared down for not gorging on their delicious pubes. If you expect a little extra with your meal, then I suggest this raising canes.

Chicken has always been tender and flavorful and is never dry at all. Fries are always crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.

When I'm in a hurry and there's a Raising Cane's nearby, it's always on the short list. Definitely a go-to spot. 

The only reason it gets 4 stars instead of 5 is ingredient quality. I mean, I know I'm eating at a fast food place.

Then another worker came back, later, and asked if there was anything that he could do for me ""so you don't have to get up"". And I was like....""Wow!"" So impressed.

They cook their chicken from scratch meaning its not frozen! You might say all these guys do is chicken fingers. Well, they do have a chicken sandwich! Bottom line is that their menu is simple and that's why they do it so well!

For you first timers the Box Combo is the perfect choice. You get 4 chicken fingers, texas toast, cole slaw, fries, and a regular drink.

Important things you need to  know: Each combo comes with at least one ""special Cane's sauce"" that goes good with everything! Well, maybe not the cole slaw but if that floats your boat, then go for it!. Also, if you don't like the cole slaw, you can trade it in for extra fries or extra bread at no additional charge! How awesome is that? You can also request for them to toast both sides of the bread for more flavor! You can ask for hot sauce and they will give you packets of Louisiana hot sauce. And last but not least, their sweet tea is one of the best I have had in a while. Oh, and make sure you sign up for the Cane's card. Its free and you get cool stuff like free food and discounts. 

I have yet to have bad service at any of their locations! Bathrooms are spacious and kept very clean.

The prices are also reasonable. I would highly suggest a visit.",LvYnN2EbDEyaIWduLBIZPg,1,0,5,1dbtT5u7qr7toyier5Fegg

They also have coleslaw, but I opted for extra fries in place of the coleslaw. In addition to soda, they do also offer both tea and sweet tea.

My lil sister has been raving about this place ever since I got into town  (lol) and I was really reluctant because although she's my sister, I feel like our tastes in food are different. She likes things plain while I, on the other hand, don't mind all the veggies. We also went with out cousin who eats extremely healthy. She's vegan but recently started eating chicken, again. Anyhow, it was my very first time there and our cousin and the workers were very, very friendly. The prices, were alright. Not pricey, under $10. We dined in because, Lord know..the heat is much too much (smh). But everything changed once we got our freshly squeezed lemonade to drink. It was so yummy, it was hard for us, not to drink it all up but then we got served our food. It was a huuuuge plate with chicken tenders, french fries (usually it comes with coleslaw but we subbed for fries) and a slice of bread that smelt, oh so buttery. We (myself and my cousin) both had our first bites of the chicken tenders and man oh man were they juicy :D the gentleman that helped us told us we should try their special sauce which I did but it tasted like mayo w ketchup and a dash of pepper (lol) which isn't a bad thing but definitely not a special thing either (lol). I enjoyed their chicken tenders soooo much I could not even finish it, even though I wanted to SO BAD ): Best thing about it though is that I could take it home and eat it and it didn't taste like processed food like how McDonalds or Jack in the Box or any other fast food restaurants food would.",H0DGXTdJWTwcw5dmEcSx8g,0,0,5,85qIcu3rl0liU6LJcfcBGw

I like the chicken, but the fries and Texas Toast are just okay, and even if they say that the Lemonade is freshly squeezed, I still feel like it isn't, so I stick to the Sweet Tea instead.

Personally, I prefer bone-in bird, and I go for the boneless fingers once in a great while. Service is always pleasant, and if you got a family to feed, Cane's may not be a bad idea. ALOHA!!!

3826961,2010-08-19,5,vstifTjwsVFXc1aprX9_iQ,"I've heard a lot about Raising Cane's, so I decided to try it out for myself today for lunch.  I ordered the Chicken Sandwich Combo w/Fries & a Bottle of Water and I ordered two Chicken Strips on the side.

Since I ordered it to dine in, they gave me a receipt and said they would bring it out to my table.  While I was waiting for my meal, I looked around and saw many customers enjoying their food.  I must be getting old because I felt like the music was way too loud in the restaurant.

After a short wait the girl who took my order brought my food out.  I tried a few of the Fries first....they are the crinkled variety.....they were good, but not great.  Next I bit into the Chicken Sandwich.....***Caution, the Chicken is extremely hot***  I burned the hell out of my mouth with that first bite.....the Chicken must have come right out of the fryer.  Wow!  I couldn't taste anything because my taste buds were wiped off the face of the Earth!

I munched on a few more Fries while I waited for the Chicken to cool down a bit.  After a few minutes I finished the rest of the Sandwich and thought it was good....but again, not great.  The Sauce in the Sandwich was the highlight.  The Chicken was just OK.....was kind of bland to me.  I then tried the 2 Chicken Strips I ordered on the side.....again, I thought they were kind of bland.  The quality of the Chicken was very good though.....nice, tender White Meat Chicken....just not enough flavor for my tastes.

4014486,2013-11-21,2,vstifTjwsVFXc1aprX9_iQ,"Whoda thunk...a restaurant that sells only chicken fingers?  Like that's gonna last??  Well, looks today like Raising Cane's is the Mickey D's of fast food fingers.  But they do a pretty good job at it.

Keepin' it simple and keepin' it good is one of Raising Cane's mantras.  Make it right, and they will come.  First time I came to a Raising Cane's was like 7 years ago.  It is still the place I come to now if I want a fresh meal of chicken fingers.  Thankfully, their product is fresh battered and fried in house, not frozen in a bag just needing a reheat.  Fresh = Good!  

Dunno what it is about chicken fingers, they are like America's past time food now.  Kids clamor for chicken fingers!  Don't like fried chicken?  Have chicken fingers!  Need a quick party food?  Get some chicken fingers!  Like Ranch dressing?  Here, eat these chicken fingers!  It's somehow completely taken over the finger food world.

No, Raising Cane's isn't a fancy place (but they do have some cool memorabilia), and if you're looking for a juicy burger this ain't your joint.  But they do some damn fine chicken fingers, crinkle cut fries, cole slaw, and Texas toast.  And damn you Raising Cane's for your yummy sweet tea!  I could damn near drink a gallon of this stuff, feel my blood sugar rise, and drink another cup just for good measure.  You don't make it any easier with that ice you serve either, caviar for ice-eaters like me.  

What is it with that damn Cane's sauce, huh?  The addictive, what I'm sure is crack-laced dip that I dunk everything in to?  I've been trying for years to distinguish with my taste buds exactly what is in that sauce of yours.  I get ketchup.  I get mayo.  I get some garlic.  I get black pepper.  Perhaps a hint of Worcestershire?  I've made it at home but I can never get that taste like yours.  What secret am I missing?  I could dip a rusty anchor in your damn Cane's sauce and it would probably taste delightful.

This location is almost always busy it seems, maybe because of placement.  It is after all by a major highway, and flanked with a plethora of different eateries all within walking distance from each other.  Like - In N' Out, On the Border, Panda Express, and across the street is Subway, Smashburger, and Café Rio.  I'm sure Raising Cane's benefits from all that foot traffic.

Service here is very quick, friendly, and sufficient.  Although I don't think I've ever seen an employee over the age of 25 unless you're the manager or assistant manager.  Lots of high school and college folk manning the registers.  Oh well, as long as y'all don't mess up my fingers and sweet tea I guess we'll be OK!

Oh yeah, one last tip - Stick with the chicken finger combos.  I dunno why some of you INSIST on the sandwich combo!  Sometimes I wish Raising Cane's would take that thing off the menu.  It doesn't work with lettuce!  But, if you absolutely need a chicken sandwich do the following: 

1) Before you go to Raising Cane's, bring some sliced pickles in with you.  Look, go buy some and bring them in a Ziploc or something.  Just make sure they're good tasting pickles.  Don't cheap out!

2) Order The Box (if it's just you), The 3 Finger (if it's just mini-you), or The Caniac (if it's me) and sub your coleslaw (even though it's good) for an extra slice of Texas toast.  If you buy The 3 Finger combo you'll have to spring for buying an extra slice.  

3)  Upon receiving your order and eating, take one slice of Texas Toast, slather with Cane's sauce.  Place hijacked pickles on sauce.  Top with 2-3 chicken fingers.  Put some hot sauce on fingers if you like spicy.  Take other slice of Texas toast, slather with more Cane's sauce.  Place slice on top of fingers.

4) Ta-Da!  Your own damn chicken sandwich!  Yes, simple.  But sooooooo good.  Trust me!",QCtHk02W_Asu2LFfdmGQDA,2,1,4,ze10w3_qw0GRcwaPUCuR5w

They boast giving military discounts, but after I showed ID and mentioned it, no discount on the receipt. Also I asked for extra sauce .29 cents. charge. The fries were crinkle cut, cafeteria style. Yuck. The coleslaw was ok, think KFC style. The strips were good, just strips....no seasoning or spicy or anything just crispy. They were good, juicy, meaty, but just...ehhhh. The bread was the BEST! Soooo good! My friend ordered the same thing. Got extra sauce for free, military discount and a large drink, no extra charge.......hmmm.

I gave Cane's 4 stars for their service, cleaniness, and because they have the best fast food chicken tenders in Las Vegas.  Another reason for the 4 stars is because I can't find a Chick fil A around me. So, this place will have to do. 

What I've Tried:
-The Box:  4 Chicken Fingers, Texas Bread, and Fries:  Fries were dry and the chicken fingers were greasy.  Atleast the chicken fingers were real chicken breast cuts and cooked fresh.  The Texas Bread was actually the highlight.

-Chicken Sandwich:  Pretty good, but still with greasy chicken fingers.  This was basically the chicken fingers inside a bun.
  
-The Sauce:  Another highlight

Really wanted to love this place, especially since fellow yelpers and friends swear by them. All this place really did for me was crave Chick fil A even more.  Don't get me wrong, the chicken fingers were pretty good.  Just not good enough for me to give it 5 stars. 

My other issue is their menu.  Not much more than just a Chicken Sandwich and Chicken Fingers.  At least Chick fil A offers wraps and breakfast. Maybe this place has a special menu like IN-N-Out.  I suggest they create a Texas Bread Chicken Sandwich.  Now that would be good.",y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,2,3,4,2QemQGjEdcA72TIXnqvSDA

This particular location is situated among a bunch of other fast/sit-down dining options off of a shopping center by Centennial and the 2-15. The place is busy and Cane's was busy, even when my husband and I stepped in a little after 9 PM. This Cane's is open until 1:30 AM. Pretty good place if you have a late night fried chicken craving.

What I like best about Cane's is their customer service. Employees are nice to customers and that makes the ordering process better than most fast-food places. Also, in case you were not aware, Cane's gives a discount to military and military dependents. You will need both your ID and your spouse's ID to get two discounts per combo meal, but it is worth it! With two discounts I saved over $2 on mine and my husband's food.

The combo meals we received were great. Nicely fried chicken strips, not greasy, fries, also not greasy. Came out with the much needed Cane's sauce (for me anyway). And of course, the mandatory chunk of bread. I'm not a huge fan of the bread, but it's all right.

There is usually a long line in the drive thru, but i never had to wait too long.
Their workers always seemed very friend, happy, smiled.

I always buy the Caniac because it comes with the most food.
Their chicken is freshly cooked, which explains why it's so hot when you first get it. I love that about them, because no one would want food that has been sitting under a heat lamp like other fast food restaurants right?!

As everyone has mentioned before, their fries are the crinkled kind that you can buy at any grocery store. But that doesn't bother me, so...

I'm not a big fan of coleslaw to begin with, so their coleslaw was pretty good here. Nothing i would rave about. I also think they would do great without the coleslaw and switch it for some other type of side food, like mash potatoes & gravy :]

Their toast...omg their toast man! I fell in love with it the first time i tried it. It's this thick cut slice, toasty on the outside so that it has that nice crunch to it, but soft in the inside. I always order extra toast when I go here.

Their sauce is one of a kind. Hard to describe, but it taste tangy to me. I like it alot, however i feel like too much of it on my chicken or fries would make me shiver ....yes shiver :P
But i love putting the chicken, fries, and their sauce inbetween two toasts, so that its like a sandwich.

Here I was all excited, about the toast and all, and I pull up to the first window to pay and the cashier Sarah (I'm assuming it's Sarah cause, surprise, they put the name on the receipts) is snotty towards me. Ugh, what did I do to you chick, I just wanted some extra toast! She goes to hand me back my card without saying a word to me, but see's a coworker/friend on the other side of the parking lot and feels the need to shout REALLY LOUD to him, like ""bye""or some shit. So in the mist of that she drops my card and just turns around to close the window. UH OK. Maybe if you didn't have those hideously obvious, fakeass colored-contact lenses in, you'd be able to see what the fuck you were doing and not drop my shit without so much an apology. You asshat.

Got to the other window, got my delicious food with my fucking extra toast that I fucking really wanted and was like fuck yes, and drove off. 

Food wise, the chicken is good but if you're looking for a crispy country-fried version, this definitely ain't it, and the toast is obviously the best thing on the planet.

Now I'm not one to do that. I don't want to be the one car at the drive thru opening each box up for quality assurance/control.

Yes, I know. 1 piece of chicken. BUT! When you order your kid a kids meal and all he gets his ONE chicken when there's supposed to be two and like 9pcs of fries...seriously.

I'm not one to gripe about food, but 3x in a 9 month period being short a chicken. Kids meal short a chicken happened twice, last visit we ordered the 3pc combo. Instead, we got 2pcs so basically it was pretty much a kids meal. But what does that really mean when two out of the 3 visits our kids meal came with one. I never called to complain because I really feel silly for calling about being short a chicken, but at the end of the day...you're paying a price and you should get what you paid for. 

Workers seem diligent at the drive thru window and on point, but somebody isn't counting their chickens and I'm ready to tell their momma. Just felt like typing that in too. Lol.

Its a little sweet, little spicy, not quite bbq sauce. It looks like white gravy, but so did not taste like it. Maybe thats why I had a distaste for it.

The chicken and fries themselves were delicious. The bread was on point, but my meal was a little large. Next time i might just get the kids meal. Dad ate his whole meal, but then again, he was waiting on me to land before he ate.",bvr5-SZikO9DexmFmCn_4g,0,0,4,3smwBsLuKiRB59O41mnuLQ

I recommend joining the Caniac club which is free to join, just ask for a card, register your email and you will get a free box combo as well as emails for promotions. Today for Mother's day,  it was buy 1 get 1 box combos and they usually do the same for Father's day.",gPnezUoB9AcxE_qeBR_Dsw,0,0,5,HceNbGyBDiDXNzybITGrgg

The girl who took my order was very friendly, however after she took my order she close the window and stated something at which time several other staff members came to the window to stare at me. I don't know if it was because I was in an unmarked security patrol car or it was because I was in uniform but I was a little uneasy about that. Once I receive my food I felt I needed to double check it to make sure nothing had been done intentionally to my food. Nothing had been done and the food was awesome but the demeanor of the staff detracted from my experience at this specific location.

I would suggest this place only for persons not in uniform or working as many times we are targets of misplaced aggression of cooks and other personnel. That being said if I was not in uniform or driving a patrol car I would definitely return to this location. The food was awesome and on its own warrants my return.",9HZSqrJhVZkjJxKVaOICbg,0,0,4,KgAF7VGTXll7zdELZXAaxw

The chicken always comes out piping Hot and juicy -- I've never had a piece of dry chicken at Raising Canes, I really wish we had one in LA, you know how much business they would have here?!
Raising Cane's chicken is deliciously seasoned, their fries are great and the Texas Toast is amazing, it seems like they are always busy so the food is always made fresh.
Oh don't forget their dipping sauce, to me it tastes like a smokey Chipotle sauce with Ranch? Very delicious! Very Clean restaurant and cool photos/decor.",ckA6PwJswcCLC_raud3XmA,0,0,5,4yAcOLT45fe9S9gta31Ntg
5984357,2016-06-14,1,vstifTjwsVFXc1aprX9_iQ,New franchise whose menu is based on simplicity. There is only one sauce for their chicken and if you want extra you are gonna pay. Chicken shack has better fries and a dozen sauces which they don't charge extra for. Unfortunately they are only located in Henderson and Boulder City. I'd chose Cain based on a lack off alternatives.,U32-I7eL4X4Dcj80o1_SuQ,0,0,1,32ilW5dL5ZcDpL1Tz1tqbg
