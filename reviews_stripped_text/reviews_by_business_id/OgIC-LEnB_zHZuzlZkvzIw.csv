Got to the dinner, my husband wanted a breakfast sandwich with pastrami, but they have informed us that custom orders are not permitted. The cashier confirmed if I wanted the French toast three times (which the manager informed me that they do not have any sweet breakfast items except for pastries). FYI the pressed French toast, was ""pressed"" a few days ago. The bread was hard and burnt. My husband's corned beef sandwich looks like it came out of vending machine.

3577061,2017-05-22,0,OgIC-LEnB_zHZuzlZkvzIw,"Eating here is probably the worst decision you could make downtown, for a variety of reasons.

My wife and I went on a weekday near lunch and it was not too busy.  We quickly placed our order and sat down.  We ordered a sandwich, the American Breakfast, and some chili.  Oddly, the American Breakfast was served almost immediately, while the sandwich took another 3-4 minutes to come out, and finally the chili another 3-4 minutes after that.  What restaurant brings out food for one person and makes the other sit there for several more minutes for their food?  This is not something a restaurant should do.

In any case, the amount of food you got is very small in comparison to what you pay.  The $11 American Breakfast comes with what was either one extra large egg or two small eggs.  The bacon was very small, super thin, and almost entirely fat -- you'd get better/more bacon on a McDonald's breakfast sandwich.  On top of all this, they put it on a tiny plate and unceremoniously put your toast (which is unbuttered, and no butter is served!) on top of it.  Want to put jam on your toast and still have it on your plate?  Nope!  See my picture for more details.  $11 for this is a complete rip off.  The sandwiches are a tad cheaper at $7-$8, but they come without tater tots and if you added them on ($3 for an order of 14 normal-sized tots) it is again overpriced.

The chili came with sour cream, for some reason, so neither of us would eat it.  Pretty much everything else on the menu actually lists what comes with each item, but not the chili for some reason.  The cashier never asked us if we wanted onions, cheese, or sour cream in our chili, but at least I'll accept that the former two items are standard additions.  As of this writing a Google search for ""chili"" shows 230m results, while ""chili -""sour cream"""" gives 229m results.  Yes, let's list the exact ingredients in a bacon, egg & cheese sandwich (bacon, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese), but not list the major components of the chili, one of which happens to be relatively rare.  Seems like a good idea!

Although we haven't had all the menu items, a cursory look at other prices on the menu indicates they tend to be way too high.  $3.50 for a soda, $3 for a bag of chips that can be bought from a nearby casino gift shop (meaning they're already overpriced) for less than half the price?  From looking at the other reviews, I'm at least the 4th person out of 14 reviews that say the food is overpriced, and in some cases, outrageously priced.  

Now that Las Vegas Club is closed, Golden Gate lost Dupars, and Mermaid's is gone, Plaza has more of a captive audience than ever before when it comes to hungry patrons, but this place fills absolutely no niche.  Everything on the menu can be had cheaper & better at Hash House a go go, the coffee shop, Zaba's, Subway, or McDonald's -- all of which are less than a 60 second walk away and inside Plaza as well!  Even if you do want a standard sitdown breakfast and didn't want to go to Hash House, you could walk over to Binions, Four Queens, The D, or Downtown Grand and get better food, more food, and cheaper food than here.

I like all of the food options at Plaza aside from Brightside.  Given the type of food they serve and the poor service, poor quality, and poor value, I can't see this place lasting long unless major changes are made to the menu and prices.",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,0,0,1,cCXKMdvLzEgHu7HC8a45RA

If you ordering To-Go then this may not be an issue to you but for those who are dining in it is to me. Prices are reasonable that's another reason why they get 2 stars for this review.

5979254,2018-05-01,0,OgIC-LEnB_zHZuzlZkvzIw,"My best friend, my husband and I went to Brightside for dinner as it was located in the lobby of our hotel, the Plaza downtown Las Vegas. 

First of all, menu items are grossly overpriced here. Be forewarned that a bag of Lay's potato chips, snack size, will run you $3. The sandwiches are roughly 10 with no sides and their Mile High pastrami is a whopping $16.

When we first arrived one of the servers told us it would be a minute before they could take our order at the register. We stood around for nearly 10 before someone finally meandered over and asked us if we were ready. Of course we were ready, we have been waiting for you for quite some time!

The older blonde lady with glasses who was working the register did not seem happy to be at work at all. Over all the employees seemed annoyed with having customers.

We ordered two breakfast sandwiches and two Philly cheesesteaks. The breakfast sandwiches were pretty good, served on yummy brioche bread. The Philly Cheesesteaks on the other hand were a disaster. It was just shredded steak topped with a very plasticky nacho cheese.

As we had received the items just prior to their closing, we didn't get a chance to taste the sandwiches until we got back up to our room. They were so disgusting we didn't eat them at all, but rather went to bed hungry.

The next morning I went in to ask about getting our money back and was told that we were not able to do so because it was not the same shift. The same blonde lady was working and called her manager to see what could be done about our complaint. She seemed pretty annoyed at having to deal with our situation at all. No one was even the slightest bit apologetic that we didn't enjoy our food. The server even told me that she really liked the food and couldn't understand how I wasn't a fan of the cheese. 

We were given a note which allowed us to get two more sandwiches at a later time during our visit. So back we went and got a club and two Italians. Both of the Italian sandwiches were a little bit on the dry side, the club was pretty good. 

The service on our second visit was downright rude. My guess is that it had something to do with the fact that they were really annoyed with us having returned two of their inedible sandwiches.

I hope you see this review before you decide to eat there, because if I had checked out the reviews on here I would have been forewarned. Do not waste your money on this barely edible, overpriced food.",5iBQarGMBdAg_VYa6h_58g,0,0,1,ZSoo-mOVeeWJGYvZxG4lgg
