We ordered the tasting menu with the wine pairings - which of course was the expensive thing on the menu.  This came with the best service we have encountered, ever.  Every glass of wine, or food, came with a different waiter.  Everyone catered to our every whim.  The food - however - was hit or miss.  I remember the monkfish being exceptional.  Somethings were strange, though, not to my liking.  Although as a foodie, I loved every minute of it.  The wines were interesting, and the entertainment value of the wine ""angels"" added to the fun aspect of the evening.

27730,2007-08-28,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"If you are one to be impressed by the ""Go Big"" mentality then Las Vegas is definitely the city for you! Besides maybe New York there is no other city in the county that can rival Las Vegas in this regard. So, it figures that when it comes to going big in the arena of wine Las Vegas should know how to take care of business! And that is exactly what they have done with Aureole at Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino.
A Charlie Palmer restaurant, Aureole is second to none in the ""Go Big"" with wine category. After all, the first thing you notice when walking across the elevated catwalk and down the stairs just to get into the restaurant is the four story high wine tower! This skyscraper-like structure measures 14 feet square and holds approximately 9,865 bottles. And just to throw in a little Vegas theatrics they hoist ""wine angels"" up and down the tower plucking bottles of wine out of the sky for the enjoyment of their dinner guests.
And if the larger than life wine tower weren't enough to catch your eye, then the digital wine list is sure to keep you captivated for hours on end. Search threw thousands of bottles within minutes by making a few quick taps to the screen on one of many Tablet PC's turned wine list floating around the dining room. Feel free to place your order digitally or maybe drop an email to the house.

The ipad want to be tablet that they use for their wine list is ridiculously lame, totally doesn't work and only succeeded in pissing us off from the moment we sat down. It really set the tone for the evening but things did improve.  Service was also off which did not help the situation.  

Things got significantly better when the food came.  Neither one of us was interested in the options on the prix fix so went with apps and entrees.  The seared ahi was really good and I would definitely get it again.  I also tried the sea bass which was excellent as well.

They had rock stars with Pasty Chef Megan Romano, Master Som Willie Sheer, and Chef Poussel. They changed everything up, had MGM go cheap and push them around and ended up killing the restaurant. Well played.

I have dinned with them a bunch of times since the changes and it has really gone down hill, and with the bad kitchen performance you can tell the staff is demoralized. Food is uninspiring, cutting corner on food costs/portion size, and no attention to detail. The saving grace is Sal, David, and Kyran who are still providing exemplary service.  I still go to drink wine and order carefully (cheese plate, onion soup:Charlie recipe,etc.) as a pre-game or to meet before I take clients elsewhere.

52973,2010-06-02,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Yelp reviews took us to this restaurant and I have to say, it was a major disappointment.
It began with the Waiter/Somellier who basically gave us the bums rush. We were barely seated before he decended and raced through the wine options without so much as a warm smile, introduction, welcome, or caring about the fact that my wife had been seated on the gap between two bench seats. Cutting to the end of the service, as he presented the bill he finally decided to smile and converse with us. Too late, buddy.
Maybe it had something to do with the fact that we decided to order multiple appetizers rather than one main course each in order to sample as much of the fair as possible...who knows.

The food was ok but not stellar. The foie gras was excellent but that's the only thing that I even remember from the meal. In fact, now that I'm writing this, I really can't recall what we ate, it was that unforgettable.

Of course, it could have been an off-day. But hey - restaurants that charge this kind of money should never have an off=day.

The wine tower was a novelty but I'm here for the food.

53921,2012-06-25,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"This is more of a 3.5 star place but that's not an option.  Overall the food and service were good, but not particularly memorable.

I'll admit that we came here to see the wine angels, and when we didn't see any going up we ordered a bottle of wine.  This isn't necessary, by the way, they offered to do a demo for us without making us buy anything.  

We were seated promptly when we arrived, and while the restaurant was relatively empty initially it filled up pretty quickly.  The first thing they do is present you with a chunky tablet with their wine list; it is an overwhelming list that will just confuse you unless you're a sommellier or have really specific tastes in wine.  It's fun to play with it for 30 seconds and see what they have, but you're better off just asking for the sommellier to come by.  We did that and the sommellier came by, asked us a few questions, and picked out a list of 7-8 wines for us to choose from.  He did a good job, selecting 4-5 wines according to what we described and what we planned on ordering, and a couple other wines that he thought we might like.  

Our waiter was attentive and prompt, but not as knowledgable about the menu as we like.  He didn't know what various markings on the menu were about which was kind of concerning, as an asterisk next to a description of cured meat seems like it would be important.  He didn't know what was in a few dishes as well.  Despite this, once we ordered he struck a good balance of checking on us without getting in our faces too much.

My wife ordered the cheese plate as an appetizer and I got their take on a french onion soup.  For entrees my wife had the pork chop and I had one of the steaks.  Herein lies the problem with this restaurant; I remember that I had the french onion soup and a steak, and they were good, but I can't remember much else about them other than that the portions were huge.  I remember enjoying it and thinking it was a good steak, but I really can't tell you much about it.  I'd go back if a friend wanted to go, but odds are on my next visit to Vegas this restaurant won't jump to mind.

That said, the food and service were good.  My only complaint, which most people probably won't share, is that the portions were too big.  I couldn't finish all my food and didn't have room for desert, and walked away feeling really heavy.  I like to get through three courses and not feel like I just ate an entire cow, so this was a bit disappointing.  But this is just a personal preference, and I actually give the restaurant kudos for being generous.  

If you're in Mandalay Bay anyway, you wouldn't go wrong having dinner here.  But I wouldn't go out of the way to come here.",uOmGw_dh7nwRI43drtsGWQ,0,0,3,_JQJo3oaf5Oot6EjyKOBPg
54612,2010-06-15,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"My boyfriend and I wandered spontaneously into this restaurant at 9 pm on a Saturday night, following a show, and to our surprise, there were plenty of open tables. The decor is lovely, though it is on the verge of looking dated. The service, while thorough, was slow as molasses, but as I'd read the Yelp reviews before, I knew to expect this. That said, we never felt rushed, and ultimately got everything we needed. We scanned the menu and decided on the ""chef's harvest menu"" (I think that's what it was called?) which was a 3-course prix fixe menu of seasonal ingredients, costing $65. We weren't that hungry and we asked them if we could split it, and they generously obliged, even going so far as to plate the split portions separately without charging us a penny. We started with the arugula, strawberry, and rhubarb salad, which was delicious. We then had the halibut with risotto and some other delicious sides I can't recall. I thought it was ok, but my boyfriend loved it. My issue was that I had been completely ruined for Halibut by the Black Mountain Grill, who served me the most perfectly cooked piece of Halibut I've had in recent memory last week, so I was tough to impress. We finished with a chocolate spearmint bar topped with housemade whipped cream and vanilla bean ice cream, served with a tray of 5 housemade confections that I think comes with every meal. It was tasty, but forgettable. All of this was accompanied by a generously poured $20 glass of Grappa, by far the best Grappa I've ever had, and well worth the price tag. (Though we split this, as neither of us wanted a whole glass). Overall it was a good value - we were stuffed, even having split a meal, and the tab was under $100. This is one of those times where I wish there was a 3.5 star rating on Yelp, because Aureole is better than 3 stars but not quite up to 4. I didn't find it overpriced at all and it was good value for the food, ambiance, plating and service.

The restaurant is known for its wine selection, so of course we had to try! The list is presented on a tablet that is hard to understand until the server helps you.

84655,2016-04-11,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"This was the most disappointing restaurant my husband and I ate at in Vegas.  First came the bread, which was clearly not fresh (maybe a day old?) and the butter they served with it was cold and hard - straight from the fridge.  For an appetizer we decided to split the fresh king grab leg and red crab fritter.  What came out was two small pieces of crab, it could have been snow crab for all I know, topped with some tobiko and an aoili and two small pieces of basically a mini eggroll of crab.  I tried to be optimistic thinking they'd pack a lot of flavor, incorrect.  In fact, quite flavorless.  Next the entrees - my husband ordered the 24 ounce porterhouse and I ordered the herb crusted lamb.  The porterhouse was chewey - he gave me a few pieces and the new york strip portion was just bubble gum, the filet portion was pretty decent but couldn't compensate for the cheweyness.  He asked for a steak knife, but they said the knife he had was the right knife, he had a lot of trouble cutting it and kept mentioned hands hurt through out the meal because of how tough the steak was to cut.  The herb crust on the lamb was actually pretty good, but other than that it was just average.  Throughout the meal my husband kept noticing they kept putting our silverware in front of us improperly, which seemed strange to us.  I was still hungry after the lamb, so we ordered dessert.  I got the molten cake and my husband ordered the creme brule (the special that day).

85607,2011-10-03,1,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"*This is a downstairs Wine Bar review only*

The other night my wife and I had an excellent time at the bottom floor bar of Aureole in Mandalay Bay. There is also an upstairs cocktail area along the hallway inside Mandalay Bay, but we felt more like a bar experience than a people watching one.

The wine selection was EXCELLENT. I got a red flight and my wife got a white flight. The tempranillo and zinfindel in the red flight were great, and my wife said two out of her three white wines were excellent. 

We also got an ahi tuna appetizer which gets an A+ for presentation and taste, but a B for quantity. They aren't huge or anything, and they come on a specialized plate designated for six pieces but instead give you four with the other two pieces on the plate garnished with avacado. 

We also go the dessert sampler menu which I highly suggest for sugar-lovers out there. Everything from the Creme Brule to the Lava Cake was outstanding, and just enough for two people to share. We were going to pair the dessert with a Sautern, but the Sautern there wasn't very good, so we opted (on recommendation from the bartender) for an Ice Wine instead. The Ice Wine was AMAZING. 

The service was also remarkable. It was pretty busy downstairs but the two men tending the bar were still personable and didn't rush us. We did get their fairly early in the night (about 6:30pm on a Friday), so the rush may not have come yet.

Also, another cool feature was the Cirque du Soleil-esque wine retriever. They have a four story wine rack that is great to look at and it becomes even more fun when you see a woman in a harness bouncing up and down to get the bottle you want. 

All in all, this place would have been perfect if it wasn't for one thing: The prices. We got two sample flights of wine, an ahi tuna appetizer, a dessert sampler and two glasses of Ice Wine and the price came out to about $115 before the tip. I get that sometimes you are paying for experience, but I know I didn't get $115 in quality of wine.

Everything else was magnificent. I was very impressed and may go back to Aureole again, but I may only get one or two items to keep down on the cost. 

Extra Note: While your there, and if you go before 9pm, walk down to the Shark Reef. It was a great experience and they do have discounts for locals. I thought it was going to be a small, crappy aquarium but it was actually pretty good sized and kept us entertained for awhile.",On07LboilFAEaDARXKOQCA,3,1,4,Gt8xmzo9YQmG5835rZqccA

I started in the bar with a tangerine mojito, which was one of those drinks that tasted delicicous and benign to boot, until I reached the bottom and realized, um, there might have been a little rum in that wee glass. Oopsie.

Cracking on, since our party was pretty large we had a set menu in a private dining room. While I was disappointed not to be able to watch the wine angels scurry up and down, it was probably best that we had our own space to yammer away in.

Am I allowed to rave about bread in this day and age? Aureole serves these petite, warm, dark rolls that taste exactly like hot pretzels. It's possible I had 2. Cue sound of Atkins turning in grave.

I'm ashamed to say that my first course was a beet salad - SHOCKER - one of my favorite places to start. This one was tasty, though not especially memorable, possibly since by then I was already on my second glass of '99 Brunello. If you're an oenophile, by the way, arrive 20 minutes before your rezzo and ask for the wine last, an electronic tablet which allows you to scrolls through their deep, expensive but fantastic wine list. 

Out came the mains, and my plate featured salmon with pancetta, cooked to perfection. But wow, that brunello was really kicking in by now so don't ask me to reel off side items. All I recall is it that it was extremely tasty.

For dessert, I bucked the trend of my table and had a meyer lemon tart. Should have gone with the chocolate souffle. It was fine enough but reminded me of the lemon curd my granny used to offer me to put on my toast.

Between the salmon, the wine, the company, and that surreally good bread, I had a pretty splendid meal. The app and dessert were fine, though nothing outstanding.

Had reservations for five of us on Friday 2/3/12 and had high hopes. Unfortunately that all crumbled from the minute we arrived to getting our check- when the server was practically telling us to leave. 

It took awhile for them to decide who would be our server, we picked a wine from their electronic tablet and it still took awhile for the wine to arrive. They didn't give us menus for at least 10-15 minutes after we sat waiting. Meal happened, not much to talk about there. After all the rudeness and check delivered, we were charged for dessert after several servers advised it was part of the prix fix menu. We didn't even want dessert and then they tried to charge us for it. It was really strange. Last, we needed to split our bill and had 3 cards- for their convenience we wrote down each amount for each card, making it easy as pie.  But then the great check debacle happened and they decided no- we're going to do it our way and split it evenly 3 ways leaving our one friend being charged double what she should have paid.

I've never experienced such poor service and I feel bad for giving such a bad review, but I want other visitors to this restaurant to be forewarned. The food did not make up for it.

First visit:
My birthday dinner.  My friends own a restaurant in Chicago - so they called ahead to let the staff know a table full of chefs were coming in for a b-day.  You know right there that we received an amazing menu, and top-notch service.  12 courses of completely phenomenal food - attention to detail was ridiculous, catering to my food allergies and my  friend's vegetarian lifestyle (which is expected at a place like Aureole, but they were above and beyond my expectations).  This was a 5-star visit - everything was absolutely PERFECT.
Second visit:
One year later.  I had my birthday dinner at Fleur de Lys (posted a review for that, as well).  The next night, my boyfriend and I decided to visit Aureole for dessert and wine.  It was not quite 10 pm when we arrived and were told unceremoniously by the hostess (before she even said hello) that they were closed.  I could see people still on beginning courses of their meals - so I knew that at least the pastry chef was still around.  We asked if we might sit at the bar and just have a dessert wine, she huffed and said ""Fine.""  The bar area was full but not crowded or hectic.  We were simply ignored by the bartender for several minutes - he finally came over and we asked what dessert wines, ports, etc. were available.  He said ""just one"" and poured 2 glasses, then left us alone again [he was not in the weeds, nor even close to busy enough to justify such treatment].  One dessert wine???  In all of Aureole?  Come on.  We caught his attention again and asked if we could still order dessert, he seemed surprised that we thought we couldn't (thanks hostess).  Dessert was fine, not spectacular, and we sat and watched every other bar patron receive better service than us.  I was so disappointed, we left quickly, wishing we had tried dessert somewhere else.
Perfect example of why NOT to dismiss a young, well-dressed couple - we love food, I have worked in restaurants for years, and generally know what type of service/food I should get for my dollar.  This was a total disappointment, and I have told everyone I know to try other Vegas restaurants instead - this one has turned the corner from ""perfect"" to ""pretentious"".",Z_XHZiOS7Me8U-IpOj_RyQ,1,1,2,WnSQFbUsEt1N78uAWPrCug

Paired with a nice glass of Sauvignion Blanc, this was an unimaginable taste experience. We decided to add an order of Crisp Rick Shrimp Beignet, which--while not being the culinary epipheny that was the Angus Beef and Foie Gras Sliders---was pretty damn good as well.

To start with, they should have a regular written wine list for people who don't care to go through the multiple menus on the I-Pad based wine list they stick you with.  Too much work for that time of night.

We each had a glass of wine from their by-the-glass menu.  Good, but not great wine.

They bring by a bread plate, and you can choose what type you want.  We had a roll with cherrys in it.  Tasted like a cinnamon-raisin bagel.  A little stale.  Also some wheat bread.  Meh.

I got the french onion soup to start.  After the first one came out luke-warm and I had to send it back, it actually was amazing.  Instead of a soggy piece of bread and cheese floating in soup like you usually get, they made a pot-pie looking thing with crispy, cheesey top crust that you can break off with your spoon and dip in the soup as you want it.  Really good!

I had the sea bass, and my wife had the pork chop.  The waiter tried to give me the pork chop.  Who can blame him?  No self-respecting guy gets the fish when there's a pork chop to be had.  Woops.  I had to send that back too, because it was bordering on cold.  My wife's pork chop was very good, with a nice smoky flavor, but as we shared it waiting for the fish to come back, we realized that hers was pretty cold too.  It just didn't matter so much with the pork chop. 

When the fish came (hot this time) I enjoyed it, but there was no WOW moment.  It was good fish on a pretty good rice base.  As we thought about it, the pork chop was pretty much the same.  No Wow.  Good, but nothing special.

The manager felt bad about our luke-warm food, so he offered us a free desert.  I was stuffed at that point, so I asked for a single scoop of sherbet.  They brought us four deserts!  I guess this was to try to make up for the lack of everything else, but it just gave us a chance to try all the deserts and realize that they didn't measure up either.  

The fried apple ring thing was pretty tasteless.  The Sherbet was good.  The cookie taster plate was - good, not great.  I can't remember what else they brought.  That should tell you how good it was.

To sum it up, the whole experience was...good, not great.  But expensive.

My girlfriend and I decided to try this restaurant because we wanted to go to a nice restaurant for our anniversary, and because we are both wine lovers. When we were seated at our table our server came over and started speaking in Spanish to us. Neither of us are very fluent in Spanish, so we kindly asked him if he could speak to us in English. His reply was ""NO! You should know the language, so you must try"". First of all, I realize that I should know a second language, but a fine dining restaurant is not the venue in which I'd like to buff up on my Spanish skills. 

Next came the wine . That was delicious, and the highlight of our experience. 

When our entrees arrived, the server did not leave. He asked us about the wine in Spanish, and made us try to reply to him in Spanish. He said ""I'm not leaving until you say it correctly"". Then he asked us where we were from and we replied ""San Diego"". He wanted to know how long the drive was. Then then went on to say ""The reason I'm asking is because the girl that I was dating lived in San Diego, and we used to meet in Barstow or Victorville, get a hotel room, and then drive back our separate ways. Do you two think that I did the majority of the driving? It doesn't matter now though, she broke up with me...but whatever"" First of all, yes...you did do the majority of the driving.

The shared plate arrived with the appetizers (bad!) but the rest of the service was smooth. Our captain sent along a sorbet plate and after dinner sweets. 
While we were offered drinks quickly, we passed for a nice bottle of wine. It took ages before we were able to get menus to see what we wanted to complement. The sommelier was friendly and gave a demo of the tablet pc listings but we made our own choice and only saw him one more time.
For the chef I'd say forget the oscar part of the tenderloin (4 little pieces of crab and 3 long slices of asparagus) - it added nothing to one of the best steaks I've had in a long time. The peppered lamb with the red pepper coulis was great with the wine. The foie gras was ok - the table beside us had a tasting menu and got a better portion of it than I did as an a la carte diner.

Our favorite was the pan-seared diver scallop on a braised short rib with carrot puree and trumpet mushrooms...we would have paid the $300 for just that dish!

The bar staff really needs a lot of work here...

The whole bar staff was clearly fake. You feel like you are the centerpiece of a southern belle dinner. The tone of their conversation to you, and the stupid jokes they drop could pass very well if you were on the croquet court hanging with the Docker's models all with pink sweaters worn over your shoulders. They were like airline stewardesses with plastic smiles chiseled into their faces. (Hopefully, one of those analogies rang a bell with you...). This whole environment made me feel ultra-uncomfortable, which of course made me very nitpicky... 

I sat down at the bar since I was dining alone, and the bartender asked me what I wanted to drink. I told him that I really liked traditional drinks, and wondered if he had something awesome in his back pocket that he could mix up. He told me that they made ""award winning"" appletinis, cosmos, and some other glammed up sugar bullshit. Seriously, this is the best you could think of?? minus 1. 

So, I asked him for a gin martini, and wanted to know what gin he had on the bar. He could only list the boring shit off the top of his head (tanq, bombay, etc.), he had to go sift through the bar to figure out the interesting kinds of gin he had. He then asked if I wanted a twist. This seems to be a major problem with Vegas since I got asked it at more than one classy place...martinis have olives. *ALWAYS*. If you ask if I want olives or a twist, then you clearly don't know how to make a martini. Minus another 1.

He then makes my martini and gives me the check. No mention of food or anything. At this point, I'm convinced that he was trying to kick me out of the place. Like, to the point where I started looking around at how other people were dressed. I also thought about trying to find a mirror to see if I had a giant booger stuck to my chin. I nearly walked out after paying for my drink, but the bartender did notice *after I had finished the whole drink* that maybe I would want some food, and asked if I wanted a menu. I decided to give the food a spin, and was treated to a fantastic swordfish. Like I mentioned before, kudos to the chef...its sad that his great meal was really hurt by bad service.

With the exception of the cool wine tower/cellar thing in the middle of the room, the bar decor sucked...it might as well have been a wall street bank.

Having dined at Robuchon the previous nite did not help our expérience at Auréole. I do not expert rock shrimp or bay scallops on a fine dining tasting menu. The sérvice was cold and unprofessional. Truthfully the only edible part of the whole meal was the dessert course.Food going back untouched should have been a red flag to the kitchen and dining room staff.

Having frequently travelled the worldwide and dined at Michelin starred restaurants from Per Se and Le Bernadin in NYC and Fat Duck to Arzak to El Bulli to Mugaritz I think I know the standards.

444696,2011-08-07,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I really debated on the rating for Aureole.  We ate there right after arriving in Las Vegas for a week long stay at Mandalay Bay.  I was there on business but my husband joined me to combine a little bit of pleasure with the business.  I was really looking forward to Aureole after hearing so much about it.  I will start by saying our food was fabulous and that is of course the most important aspect of any restaurant experience.  Service was also very good.  My pomegranate martini was one of the best that I have ever had.  What was a little disappointing was the stark nature of the restaurant.  I think one problem is that  due to the 3 hour time difference from the east coast, we were there early by Vegas standards, around 6 pm  Wall are all white with no artwork or anything to speak of.  Maybe when it is dark the wine tower takes center stage but in the bright light it was really not as impressive as others have stated and we really only saw one flight up the tower during our entire meal.  I was also a bit shocked to see what appeared to be a curtained area used for waiters etc to serve from.  It just appeared kind of flimsy, like something you would see at a large banquet hall.  It was one of those rare dining experiences where the lack of ambiance took away from an otherwise great meal and if anything I had expected the opposite situation.",tlyeK4D9wIUy6ch0tADr7g,0,0,4,2pEJhDmPIRZM4IcvtfouVg
453093,2011-07-07,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"We stayed at THE Hotel at the Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas.  Since we were there we decided to try Aureole for dinner.  

The GOOD- 
1) The location and scenery were great! The 4-story wine tower is incredible to look at and fun to watch the ladies in their ""Mission Impossible"" suits go to get the wine bottles.
2) The food- read below for more information
3) The service was as good as I've had at a fine dining establishment.  From the lady serving bread, to the man who took our order, to the Sommelier who recommended a nice bottle of wine.

The OK-
1) The restaurant is a pricy place to eat.  It was over $300 for the two of us.  But I guess you have to expect that in Vegas!
2) The wine list is quite cumbersome so if you are like us and aren't the smartest when it comes to wine, it's hard to pick one.  We're both fans of the red wines, especially Zinfandel's from the Dry Creek area (Healdsburg, Sonoma County) and they didn't have many wines from that region to choose from on their list.

The FOOD-
We both ordered from the Chef Vincent's Market Menu. The Salt and Pepper Calamari has got to be some of the BEST I've ever had.  It didn't need any dipping sauce and the calamari pieces were perfectly lightly breaded so that you could taste the calamari, not just the breading.  I had the seared Rainbow Trout and it was good.  I wasn't a fan of the skin being served along with the fish, but I ate around it and the fish was really tasty.  The white asparagus was overcooked for my taste, but the whole dish itself was prepared well and seasoned good.  My boyfriend had the American Wagyu Beef Skirt Steak and he LOVED it!  There was nothing left but an empty plate when he was finished.  For dessert I ordered the Salted Caramel Bomb cake and my boyfriend had the Orange Grand Marnier Creme Caramel.  Both desserts were great, but my favorite was the blood orange sorbet served with the Creme Caramel.  It was to die for!!!

We also ordered a bottle of 2007 Joseph Phelps Cabernet Savignon that was really good! 

Overall, our experience at Aureole was awesome.  Hopefully we will be back to enjoy another great dining experience!",6Ng2TYmCkp0snxvRhw5BfA,1,0,4,jpLuroPwHvL7mm3e6jguvw
466553,2009-12-30,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"This was going to be the splurge of our girls trip to Las Vegas but it wound up being more of a bust. I love to read/research/pick out restaurants and we chose Aureole because we wanted to try the pre-fixe menu and we both liked the various choices. We arrived about 30 minutes early for our reservation so we spent some time shopping. We arrived at the restaurant promptly and were taken to our table but the hostess didn't ask to take our coats (it was windy that night) or our bag. Once we arrived, we were seated at one of the banquettes and I put my purse next to me along with my coat. The waiter came over and picked up my friends things and put them on the other side of me - totally made me feel hemmed in. Again, I should have asked for coat check but he should have as well. I had the restaurant.com coupon and let the server know we were using it as well as ordering from the theater menu and that we'd like glasses of wine (I like whites, my friend likes reds). That pretty much ended our service from him and his assistant. They took our order but after that, a waiter from a different section took care of us until the time when the bill was presented. We never got the chance to look at the electronic wine menu and our meals were just so-so. They were adequate but nothing spectacular. I've eaten in restaurants with better reputations where they actually make you feel like you more welcome. Maybe it was the waiter, maybe it was the restaurant, maybe it was me, but I know I'll never go back to Aureole.

But the funniest part was the customer service. I feel bad writing this review because the majority of staff and aesthetics was great. Of course, it only takes one terrible waiter or waitress to ruin everything. Gosh this waiter though... He just seemed to have a bad day, which is normal. We all get bad days. He comes over and just looks at us with this expression that reads ""wtf do you want"". My friend and I are just sitting there and I start smiling because it's literally this awkward pause of staring. My friend commented that it was like his first day or something. I think it's because he was having a bad day and took it out on customers. I was observing the other guest and you can just tell by their expression that they weren't having it with him either.

484625,2011-08-25,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Sadly, I must add to the apathetic reviews after my dinner at Aureole last night. Not because of the service, which was not excellent but also not terrible, nor because of the wine program, which  lived up to its reputation overall, but because in the end the food was just okay, and what is a great restaurant without great food?

Service was actually pretty quick, though very ""entitled."" What do I mean by that? Lots of assumptions were made all night. For instance, just after my first course, I was asked if I wanted any more bread (I had already tried one roll). I replied, ""Not right now,"" which evidently prompted the server to clear my bread plate, knife and butter. It would have been proper (and polite) to ask first. Lots of little details like this all night surprised me, given the (formerly) stellar reputation of this institution.

The food was good, but not great. I wasn't starving, so I just went for the 3 course menu -- corn chowder, cioppino and cheese. The chowder featured a tiny crab cake in the center of the dish, which tasted very fishy and was dried out from overcooking. I also had to pull some corn gristle out of my mouth, which is always gross. The cioppino had almost no flavor. Seriously. I put salt on it, which helped, but honestly it looked and tasted like someone had poured a thin tomato broth over 4 (count them) clams and a few unidentifiable pieces of fish. I could have gotten better cioppino at any seaside diner in California. The cheese was fine, albeit I received one TINY piece of three cheeses in total. I do mean small, and I do mean only one piece. Very stingy.

The wine program is obviously very extensive. That's what made this restaurant famous originally, and that's why I wanted to come primarily -- to see the ""wine angels"" make their ascent up the wine tower. Sadly, though many patrons around me ordered bottles, no angels ascended. I can only assume the bottles are stored somewhere else as well? Bummer. 

However, on the plus side, I did enjoy my wine selection and service. I opted for a 2008 Christian Moreau Chablis 1r Cru Vaillons, which was $90. A lovely Chardonnay, which paired well with the chowder in particular.  One of a few interesting bottles on the long list priced below $100. Wine service was well executed and prompt. My glass was always filled at the right time and with the right amount.

In the end, a spotty meal with a few highlights. I wonder if Aureole will be retired or re-vamped? One or the other should probably happen soon.",yNMrtQogwAW9Poa3F8J6Ew,0,0,3,_Y_EFuPqFP3f61TAMZfR_g

Atmosphere - 4.5:  Entry into the restaurant features a stroll down the staircase around the glass wine tower, which is something that sets Aureole apart from the crowd.  There are two seating choices, the main dining room and the Swan Court.  We chose the Swan Court which was more private, quiet, and romantic.  The room overlooks a pond that has curious swans swimming about that seemed interested in checking us out.  The only downside to the Swan Court is that there is no view of the Wine Angels flying about in the wine tower to retrieve your special bottle of Vino.
 
Menu - 4:  You have two options for the menu: 1. A fixed ""Parallel"" menu with two selections for each course.  The Parallel menu is a tasting menu where the selections aren't choices, but both course items are served together, in parallel.  This option can only be selected if the entire table is willing to go with this choice.  2. Select from a traditional style menu with a variety of appetizers, main courses, and sides.  We went with the fixed menu because we loved being able to sample a wide variety of dishes. Either option offered diverse selections.

Service - 5:  The is a Four Diamond restaurant so our expectations were fairly high, but Aureole did not disappoint.  Service was fantastic from the moment we entered right up until we left.  My wife has some food allergies and the staff did a phenomenal job accommodating her and modifying some of the dish preparations.
  
Food - 5:  Outstanding!  Everything was prepared to perfection.  The dishes were creative both from a culinary and visual perspective.

Wine List - 5:  In a word, WOW!  The wine list is on a tablet computer that you can search, sort,  and filter on various criteria (region, vintage, type etc.) to find what suits you.  It's a good thing too, because they have an unbelievable selection.  It's obvious why they have won the Wine Spectator Grand Award every year since 1999.  The sommelier knew the collection very well and and helped us pick out some amazing bottles.  I was blown away.

535955,2009-06-25,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"This was one of the most memorable dining experiences that I have ever had. The food was great, but it was really the sommelier and the wine that made the night. He was very enthusiastic about allowing our table of 3 taste any wine we desired. And the ""taste"" was more like a glass too. i got to try wines from Argentina, California, Austria, Spain... It was great!
He warned me that the entrees are not the best deal here, so instead I got 3 appetizers: the tuna canneloni, the louis salad, and the rock shrimp ravioli. All were executed PERFECTLY, both in taste and presentation.
I originally ordered the squab on risotto, which was not at all what i expected. It was very rare, VERY gamey tasting, and had no skin. I sent it back with no problem and got the louis salad instead, which was 80% crab - YUM, my kind of salad.
I got the opportunity to meet the chef and see the kitchen here, who was very gracious, even though I had criticized his squab. Seeing the kitchen was AWESOME. It is huge and there is staff everywhere. Very clean too.
I would recommend this restaurant to anybody looking to have a memorable experience, especially if you love wine as much as I do! The restaurant is beautiful, the wine tower is impressive, and the service is impeccable. It was the BEST SERVICE I had in Vegas all week, and I went to a lot of other high end restaurants.

It was fantastic.  Eclectic mix of flavors and things I didn't think about before.  Each course featured a key ingredient, but then prepared in 2 different ways.  It was a great way to sample the Chef at Aureole.  

It is hard to describe the type of cuisine in this place as based on some of the things they serve you'd argue it is Latin flavored...but it didn't really have a cuisine signature.  Don't let that stop you though...there is something for everyone.

If you like wine, this is the place with the tower wine rack.  They have the 'wine angels' (which I think should be called Wine Ninjas based on what they wear) who get on wires and pulleys to get your bottle of wine down.

The one thing I didn't like was the photographer.  Some random lady came to every table taking pictures.  For the type of place this was (and prices) that was unexpected and a bit annoying.  I thought I was in a fine dining place, but then I was temporarily transported to a vegas splash mountain camera experience.  Then she comes back with pressure to sell them.  Again, just odd and out of place for a fine dining experience in my opinion.  Our host was gracious enough to buy the pictures for us, which was nice, but I felt he shouldn't have had to feel that pressure.

590709,2011-05-16,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"What a shame.  A friend and I, both self-proclaimed foodies, came here for dinner last week, and it started off great.  The restaurant is beautiful, the towering wine cellar is amazing, and everything on the menu sounded great.  In addition, the prices were quite reasonable!

We each ordered an appetizer and an entree.  My friend also ordered a side dish, spinach gratin, to go with his entree.

The service unfortunately was a bit slow.  Bread took a while to come out.  Drinks were not refilled.  Slight annoyance, but I forgot about that after I tasted the food, which was fantastic.  I had a yellowtail crudo which was out of this world good, and my friend had a seared foie gras with strawberries, which was interesting and delicious!

Our entrees arrived (a halibut in Japanese broth, and a mediterranean-style escolar, both very well prepared), but my friend's side dish was nowhere to be found.  We assumed that the waiter would deliver that separately after dropping off our entrees.  But unfortunately, the waiter never came back.  He did not even come back to ask if the meal was ok.

We did flag him down eventually and ask about the gratin.  He said ""Oh yes!"", and quickly walked away.  No doubt he forgot about it.  We continued on with our delicious meal.

As we took our last bites, the side dish still had not arrived.  We decided to cancel the gratin, but by the time we found our waiter, he was already bringing out the gratin.  There were no apologies about the delay, no excuses made, nothing.  He dropped it off like it was nothing.  My friend (knowing how sharp tongued he can be) was already holding back and very nicely hinted to the waiter that we were already done with our meal.  Our waiter said ""Well, this is still good, it's still hot"" and walked away.

Trying to not let this incident ruin our meal, we let it go.  However, it quickly became apparent to us that this spinach gratin was quickly thrown together in a hurry.  The spinach was watery and there were no signs of this being a ""gratin"", in that the cheese on top was barely melted, there was no crust, no browned cheese... it was just a mess.  It was disgusting to the point where I would not even expect to eat this at El Pollo Loco or Koo Koo Roo.

Our waiter asked how the gratin was, and we told him it was not done very well.  He said ""Ok, I'll let the kitchen know.""  His attitude by this point was he felt we were just bothering him and wish we would leave.  My friend finally said, ""No, we were already done with our meal, this side dish came late, and on top of that, it was gross.""

The waiter said annoyingly, ""Ok, I'll take that off your bill, oh geez.""

Mind you, this is a high-end restaurant in Las Vegas.  I was very surprised and disappointed in this attitude.

If it weren't for the service, I would give this place 4 or 5 stars.  But the service ruined the experience and for that, this place gets 3 stars.",zpTP5V_53AJyW4ITdi4nBg,1,0,3,icBtBPlkyEknif_h-PEc7A

I was whisked away to Las Vegas for a quick birthday getaway with my boyfriend. We chose dinner at Aureole on a Tuesday night, in the wintertime/off season which turned out to be a pretty great night. 

From the minute we walked in the doors to the moment we left, we were stunned and impressed by the wine tower, food and exceptional service. 

We probably had two or more servers throughout the night and a couple of visits from the sommelier. We bought a bottle of wine, but it was only OK. Fortunately, the sommelier had mentioned a much better Pinot Noir, which he kindly poured for us instead! We ended up doing a wine pairing with our three course prix fixe meal, as there are so many excellent wine choices, and they are more than happy to introduce you to the perfect wine for your taste and meal. 

The meals were so delicious and beautifully created. I don't know if it was just because it was my birthday, but the desserts were my favorite part. I wanted every last bite. The selection of assorted sorbets are incredible! I don't believe I've ever tasted such unique flavors.

The wine tower they have is definitely worth a look.  It's a pretty neat system where the wine stewards get in a harness and have to zip up the side of the tower to get the bottles high up.  The tablet PC wine menu also gets them points for the fun factor for gadget geeks like me.

We had a very good Australian grenache, and a few of their desserts.  Both the wine and food were excellent.

It was cooked to perfection and had me savoring every bite. I was in food heaven.

Celebrity chef offshoots usually disappoint because the chef is never actually there and attention to detail suffers.  I know Charlie Palmer didn't cook my meal, or even see it, but the details are polished here and it would be hard to leave unhappy.  

The computerized wine list is so much fun for the oenophile that you should give yourself 30 minutes to find what you want to drink before you order.  Compared to other Vegas fine dining, you are given plenty of great choices/vintages under $100, or you can splurge from your winnings to spend much, much more.

Service is swarming, but unintrusive, and you shouldn't be surprised to have 10+ people be involved in your experience in the course of the night.

I wasn't wowed by the food (though it was very good), but I was wowed by the experience.  Everything else was so polished, I would expect the food to be better the next time around.

Considering Joel Robuchon wants $250 and up for his prix fixe menus, Charlie Palmer's are a veritable bargain, both coming in at under $100.

Then, the main course happened. Everything arrived cold. The medium steak, the potatoes, the pasta, the cooked purple kale. Cold cold cold.

To start we had the beef and octopus carpaccio, bacon wrapped pork belly, and lion fish ceviche. All were delicious and very unique! The bacon wrapped pork belly came with a sunny side egg that was cooked to perfection. Our waiter, Alfredo, helped with wine selections for every course. For dinner I had the Alaskan Halibut while my boyfriend ordered the cut of the week which was a NY Strip. We ordered a side of mac & cheese and the mushrooms for the table.  I absolutely loved my entrée. It was cooked perfectly and the tartar mashed potatoes were a perfect compliment to the fish. My boyfriend had ordered his steak medium rare - and him being a chef he's very picky - the steak came slightly overcooked. When brought to our waiters attention he offered to have it re-fired for us but did say it would be a moment or two, we decided not to wait and because of this Alfredo offered to take care of our desserts for us. About half way through our entrees a party was seated close to us that had a loud and fussy baby. The table next to us had already moved to get away from the noise and we were close to follow. Alfredo moved us to a table away from the loudness and brought over all of our dishes and drinks. He was more than accommodating which was very nice! For dessert we had the mango sundae, the cold pressed coffee panna cotta and the trio of cheesecakes. All were delicious! Beware though - when ordering the cheesecake it is not traditional cheesecake which was well explained to us by our waiter. One slice is brie cheese, the others cheddar and blue cheeses. All were delicious to us but definitely not for everyone I'm sure so be wary. All over a great experience! Alfredo was very attentive and we never felt like we had to track someone down for help.

Here is why it only got four stars. The price structure is a gimmick. I have no problem paying for great food. But the prices are set flat per person for three courses. Which means for $85 you can get the lobster ravioli, followed by the filet, followed Chocolate cake. And for the same $85 price your partner can get the ceasar salad, followed by chicken, followed by carrot cake. No matter how  you plate it or where you get your romaine/chicken/carrpts from the prices should be significantly different based on the ingredients. So if you want a menu that you can pick what you want and have the price reflect what you got, go somewhere else.

Service overall was excellent though it was Valentine's Day evening and the place was packed.

We both ordered fish, perhaps not the specialties of the house.  The swordfish in citrus with vegetables was beautifully presented.  The root vegetables were partially peeled with the skins tied into butterfly wings.  The fish was only good by comparison.  The red snapper, characterized by our waiter as flaky, was under cooked and flavorless.  It was presented on a bacon infused bed of vegetables that were much better than the fish.

We dined on Sunday at 8:45 pm.  The staff was weary from the weekend, perhaps.  We lost 3 of 4 staff before our entrees arrived.  They were out of the halibut. The bread was chilled. Not just room temperature, chilled.  Service was slow.  Which would not have been a problem, except I was brought the wrong steak, and was then pressured to accept it, because the one I ordered was inferior anyway.  I was assured I would not be charged the difference in price, but I ordered the steak I ordered intentionally, because it was the one I wanted.  Meanwhile the steak wasn't cooked to order anyway.  It was rarer than I requested.  A lot.  So I think it was a truly stray steak.  Or the staff didn't want to say they were out of the halibut and the New York steak.  We poured our own wine half the time.  Our last remaining server invested in the group next to us, to the point of offering club-going advice and comp options, but blew us off once he blew my order.  It was sad to see a giant nearly whole bone-in filet get sprinkled with the crumbs off our table without a question whether we wanted to take it and our nearly whole side of quinoa to go.  Aside from the swan court venue, a terrible experience.  I recommend N9ne if you need a perfect steak, or Craftsteak, or SW or Sage or Nob Hill or Botero or the Wynn buffet / Cosmopolitan buffet before I would eat here.

The special was fois gras, filet, spinach and was ordered medium rare and came very medium. Both were again very salty and overdone. We had the wine director pick a barolo and it was a good pick. The cheese appetizers were good but the main course was not up to the prices. They did give a waygu steak done properly but it was too little too late for us. Twice in many years is too much for me.

931751,2010-11-16,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"The decor of this expanded version of Chef Charlie Palmer's New York City Classic is absolutely amazing. The wine tower in the middle of the restaurant is a four story temperature controlled wine tower, with flying wine angels. 
For a restaurant that has been recognized as a AAA Four Diamond Restaurant and epicurious.com top restaurants from 1995 to 2010 , I was extremely disappointed with the service. Our waiter never introduced his name nor came back in a timely manner to see if we would like to start on any appetizers before our main entree. By the time our waiter ,by, the name of Abdaljalil ( asked for his name from another server walking by) came by to take my drink order.. i was ready to order my whole meal for the evening. 

I ordered a glass of wine to enjoy with my sirloin sliders with guacamole and chipotle sauce and a plate of artisaal cheese and house accompaniments, sliders were perfectly cooked and prepared. 

For the main entree I ordered 2 bone in rib eye with the garlic firecracker and classic bearnaise sauce accompany with some Parmesan fries and buttered asparagus. 

When ordering our main entree, I asked our waiter Abdaljalil if he could slice the rib eye in pieces for us, he responded No. So i left it as that. 

As our servers Dario and Ricardo were extremely tentative with refilling our water and constantly asking us what was needed, they even offered if i would like the bone in rib eye sliced in the back to make it easier for sharing. First, I already asked our waiter prior to ordering, so i was a bit confused with they offered to take it back to the kitchen. Our waiter Abdaljalil pulled Dario and Ricardo behind our booth and was saying something for quite a while, somehow Dario and Ricardo made my request happen! 

Our bone in rib eye was cooked to perfection, our sides was good but nothing to rave about. 

In all honesty, i was disappointed with our Waiter.If we didn't have good servers like Dario and Ricardo, i would have rated this a 1. 

The waiter did not even bring us our check,our servers did!!!!!!! 

I have dine at the Charlie Palmer in Orange County a lot, and that restaurant has never let me down. I was expecting the same type of service when dining at Aureole.

First thing you'll notice as you step in is the huge wine tower and the wine angels to retrieve the wine (pretty awesome mini-show!). The restaurant is elegant, as many Las Vegas establishments are, with a soft ambiance. 

Service was, for the most part, quick and attentive. We had a very cheerful waiter who took noticeable care with handling our orders. Our wine waiter was, however, a bit cold and emotionless in explaining how the wine selection worked. They give you an electronic tablet with an extensive wine list, allowing you to filter by many categories. 

The food is amazing. I started with the Peruvian ceviche, onion soup, oysters, and ahi tuna tartar. The ceviche was one of the best I've ever had,  with a nice tang. I loved the tuna tartar and the oysters, but wasn't crazy about the onion soup. For our entrees, we had grilled swordfish and alaskan halibut with a side of mashed potatoes with garlic. My swordfish was delicious, but her halibut was a bit salty. The potatoes was very good. Since we were stuffed, we declined dessert other than tea, but they rewarded us with a complimentary little dessert platter with assorted cakes.

This time we sat in the main dining room which offers a stunning view of the wine tower. We saw a couple angels fetch bottles. But otherwise, I much prefer the intimacy and extra level of service experienced in swan court.

We all ordered wine by the glass, the husband and I ordered of the menu and BIL chose the market menu.

Combined we started with clam chowder, onion soup and the pear tart with duck proscuitto. While nothing was outstanding, all three whet our appetite and we were ready for more.

Then for the main course we had Waygu skirt steak, the rack of lamb and the scallops. The steak had fantastic flavor, but it was very chewy, likely due to the cut of meat. As good as the flavor was I couldn't help but think it was like beef flavored bubble gum -- tasty while you chew, but you don't want to swallow it. The scallops were huge and nicely prepared, but the vanilla apple compote was simply too sweet for my liking and I thought it completely overwhelmed the dish. The star of the meal was the lamb. Rich and meaty, just plain delicious. I also ordered ratatouille for us to share. It was very good.

997089,2009-02-03,2,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I've walked by Aureole many times, but had heard wide varying experiences from fellow diners about them.  I remember thinking their wine tower sure is impressive looking and that's probably why I've never been tempted to try them.  Similar to my experiences of a hotel that has an opulent impressive lobby, but outdated and junky rooms, I have imparted this feeling of caution to restaurants like Aureole.  Nevertheless a group Vegas trip to celebrate multiple bdays was enough for me to just go along with the flow.  Unfortunately, this time my prior hesitations were confirmed.  It's a good thing I was with good company, bc otherwise the dinner would have been without merit.  Completely not worth it and I whole heartedly recommend you stay away from here.

I always start good things first, but this is gonna be very short.  It's clean and quiet environment.  If you think Vegas is just way too loud and you look for respite from the ding ding ding's of slot machines, you won't notice it here.  They have a nice area at the back of the restaurant with a window overlooking a fountain in a small lake, which I would suggest you request to be seated in if you are dining here.  They have a few private rooms available, but be forewarned that the prix fixe meals you order from are the same menus you can order in the main dining room, just $30 more per person.  (What?!)  

It's a total disappointment.  Even though the wine tower does make a dramatic introduction the poorly lit staircase which spirals down around it destroys it.  There's a very slow elevator, but I decided to walk down this monument to Aureole's ""greatness"" in order to experience the full effect.  As I arrived at the bottom, I thought, ""meh.""  The ambiance here can be nice or boring depending on your situation.  An intimate dinner for two to revel in each others' eyes and hold hands, you'll probably enjoy it.  To me it was boring.  Quiet, stuffy, and unless you're seated at the rear of the restaurant (which has a nice window looking out to a fountain/lake) it's a total drag.  Even though there was hardly anyone else in the restaurant, our large party was seated right at the foot of the wine tower in the front of the restaurant.  It was very distracting to hear the loud descending footsteps of later arriving diners during our meal.  People in our party ordered a couple bottles of wine, but because we were seated at the bottom of the wine tower, we never got to see them retrieve it.  I'm not certain that they even did have to retrieve the bottles from the wine tower.  Similar to dining at an over-rated on the beach restaurant way after the sun has set and darkness envelopes you, I felt we missed the best part for putting up with inflated prices and mediocre food.  Restrooms are ridiculous.  An ""open concept"" gone extremely wrong.  there is no door to the powder room on the woman's side or the men's side, both which have a communal circular trough with only one water dispenser to wash your hands as well as a mirror.  So ladies, don't expect any privacy or space if you're going to touch yourself up.  There is also only one toilet room on each side too (which fortunately does have a door), but everyone else has to wait outside the powder areas and watch each side wash their hands.  It's truly an idiotic design. Service was also abysmal considering this is supposedly a top notch restaurant in Vegas. From start to finish, things took a a long time and with none of the polish of a top restaurant.  Drinks took forever to get to our table, food arrived without a known destination and a diner-like question from the server of ""fish?"", and the fastest most efficient service was in delivery and collecting the check.  I hate restaurants are incompetent until they want you to pay up and get the hell out.  Food was also sadly poor.  Although there were several prix fixe meals to choose from, only the most expensive sounded appetizing.  And since things were on such an impressive start, I decided to save myself some money and order their cheapest and least appealing prix fixe meal.  I won't go into detail in what I had since they rotate the menu frequently and others more than likely won't be able to order anything I had, but everything was just ho-hum.  Is it my fault I was disappointed with my meal?  Maybe, but I feel I wasn't missing out on anything based on the reactions of my fellow diners who had ordered more extravagantly and had saved myself some money to lose at the tables.  = )  Finally the worst part of the meal was dessert.  Multiple bdays meant multiple free desserts which at first seemed delightful since they came out with a large assortment of sorbets, cakes, and other items.  But not one of them was tasty.  In fact several of the fruit sorbets were horrible and I couldn't stand more than a small spoonful.  Way to close the meal out on a low note Aureole!  I took the slow elevator ride up and got the hell out of there!

So after getting seated, our group had to request menus after being ignored for about 10 minutes.  They (we had 2 servers) came out with wine and cocktail menus first (maybe hoping we'd drink too much so that we wouldn't notice how slow the service was).  After finally getting menus and ordering, we were served a nice selection of breads.  When the food came out, everyone got their entrees except me so we nicely asked the waitress to check on the order for us.  When the waiter returned with my swordfish, he said that the reason they didn't bring my dish was because we had switched seats and the servers sent my dish back when they saw food already present at my original seat.  I couldn't decide whether he was just presenting an excuse or being accusatory, but I wasn't sure why they didn't just ask me if that extra entree was mine since I didn't have any food in front of me.  After I started to eat my fish, I was very impressed with the way it was seasoned.  However as I started to get to the middle of the filet, I noticed that it wasn't fully cooked.  So I asked the waitress if this type of fish was supposed to be served this way and she claimed that it was how the chef liked to prepare it, but if I wanted to she could take it back (hubby and foodie then tells me that swordfish is supposed to be fully cooked).  So after getting my fish back, I was only able to eat the outside parts because the middle was still not cooked.  At that point, I was full on the mini vegetables so I didn't ask for them to try again.  I was thinking that they would get a 1 star rating from me, but sadly I must confess that I can be easily bribed with desserts.  The waitress had seen my disappointment (and uneaten fish) and said she would send out some sorbet that is made in house.  She ended up sending out sorbet and ice cream and I found them very light and flavorful!  Voila!  They gain back a star!  

So, the final say is...If you're a wine drinker (which I'm not), you would probably want to try it for that reason because their selection is pretty vast.  Not to mention the gimmicky wine faeries are fun to watch as they fetch your order.  Otherwise, save the $120-200 for the slots because who knows, you could get to spin on the wheel of fortune machines or win Megabucks! ;)",vYgaWB90Qn9aXDp-v8FIMQ,0,0,2,KLkvQ_ZmCenMk16c6p-F-A
1050827,2011-04-14,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Had the ""Parallel"" tasting menu last night but they graciously substituted two more fish preparations for the Lamb course. We started with two raw preparations. The first was fluke and the second was lobster. Both included pineapple. The fluke had a slightly spicy macadamia nut and coconut topping. The lobster used grilled pineapple with a small green papaya salad. Both were fresh and tasty. 

Next, was a duo of carrots. First, a nicely seared scallop. The other half was seared tuna on a small plank of carrot pound cake. 

The third course was supposed to be lamb but they gave us black cod with sauteed broccoli and slightly spicy sauce. The other half of the course was salmon nicely with a red wine reduction.

Dessert was a baklava stack with concord grapes and ice cream in the middle. It was slightly dry and hard to eat, but the filling was great. The other half of dessert was a chocolate gelatin in a biscotti Napoleon. 

It was our anniversary, so the restaurant gave us a very nice additional dessert sampler. The lemon case with strawberries was the most memorable. It was a very nice touch.

All of the food was very good and the service was excellent. The waiter was very helpful but never intrusive. The rest of the staff kept the wine flowing, water glasses full, and bread plates filled.

First the service was excellent: warm, attentive knowledgeable staff and food came out in a timely fashion. 

The breads were not warmed and the baguette borderline stale. For this price point you expect better.

Neither of the foie gras apps were great. One an over chilled molded version with a chocolate sauce and the other shaved with a salad and pomegranate seeds that were difficult to eat and ruined the creamy texture of the foie gras. 

The fish over spaghetti squash was a real disappointment with underseasoned squash and over cooked thick cut pancetta that was almost inedible. The parallel dish, a squash rissotto was very good, which made up for it. 

The beef and cod cheeks were a solid 8.

I was so impressed by how elegant and stunning the room was and the massive wine tower . I remember my first time because it truly made an impression on me of how fine dining should be! I even have dined at the original one in NYC after trying the Vegas location, but somehow the second establishment was more stellar. 

Aureole has undergone a renovation as have most of the establishments in Mandalay Bay , a more relaxed, semi-casual , and more approachable menu items . Johnny Church is back , but as the Executive Chef and his menu is brilliant .
I decided just to pop in to the lounge and give it a try after a day of shopping at Mandalay Place. The room still holds its WOW! esthetics , the wine tower and beautiful entrance with the staircase going down gradually revealing the expansive , lovely warm toned colors of the room. It is beautiful and inviting to the senses . I sat down and the bartender J offered me a cocktail list , but since I don't drink he created a nice mocktail for me to enjoy. He was very engaging and knew what kind of drink I would like, something that looks fun, but with out the alcohol . I was getting hungry so he handed me a menu and I saw so many things I wanted to try. There was quite a large selection , I was leaning towards the octopus and beef carpaccio , but then the steaks looked amazing! I had only a limited time so I decided to try their smaller menu, the wine angel Ebony came over and I asked her what they recommended and they both said the grilled cheese with nuts and jam were really good and would come out quick . I finished with the chocolate and berry tart , with berry sorbet !!!!! To top it off the wine angel was very kind and took pictures with me and even went up to do a demo looking like a James Bond or Femme Fatale movie star in her harness , retrieving bottles from the wine tower. 

It was a fun evening and I could see outside which I like about this place as well, a lovely thunderstorm was happening and lightening was flashing behind the palm trees of the Mandalay pool area. 

I did get to see chef Johnny and he was very kind and invited me to come back for dinner in the dining room, I promised I would and I can't wait to try the octopus and beef carpaccio , and the steak! I'm a huge fan on CP Steak as well and Charlie Palmer is probably my favorite out of all the Vegas chefs. I mean he kind of speaks for himself , being here since 99. After all these years I still love his restaurants and it's actually one of the places that make you want to get dressed up and come out. The staff is always friendly and attentive, never intrusive .

Of course, our food was great, delicious and beautifully plated as one would expect, but what really made this meal was the exceptional service we received from everyone we encountered.

I drink my fair share of good wine, but I'll admit to being a little intimidated by the concept of ""sommelier."" I got over this quickly after meeting Adam, our sommelier for the evening.  His friendliness, affability, and unpretentiousness really added to our enjoyment of the evening.  It didn't hurt that he was pouring exceptionally good wines by the glass, and kept us tasting wines that we never would have ordered on our own and really ended up enjoying.  Even if you don't order a bottle, make sure to check out the extensive wine list, presented on a tablet PC and sortable by varietal, region, vintage, etc.  Very cool.

I started with a Caesar salad and my wife with a baby fields greens salad.  Both were excellent, although I'd have to say that mine was a bit prettier.  I ordered a loup de mer and my wife had a dish featuring smoked sturgeon and scallops.  I'd say she was the winner of the entree contest, with mine being slightly overcooked.  I was happy nonetheless, as the accompanying flavors and the terrific wine more than balanced any deficiencies in the dish's preparation.

We finished with a dynamite warm lava mocha cake and some small complementary truffles.  And of course a nice ice wine for our liquid desert.

Bernard, the dining room manager, has brought his years of experience at Spago to Aureole, and it shows.  Nice work, everyone!  Thanks for a terrific evening.",euSarYynpRSc9dCtDwbLag,0,0,5,BnW2Mx2bB60LR6pT3DZkkw

Reservations at 9 p.m. and we are walking to the back of the restaurant. Sitting in a secluded high booth I feel I am on a romantic date with one of my best friends. We look at each other and laugh, as we are some of the few patrons left. The giggles have taken over and our voices are nowhere to be found.

The menu is lovely as we get to pick one appetizer and entrée each for a fixed price. I was in the mood for beef and a delicious glass of Cabernet. I selected the cheese plate and my friend wanted the French Onion Soup.
We each choose wine, she is always about the Sauvignon Blanc especially if they are from New Zealand. On the other hand I spotted a glass of Cabernet from Hess Winery and knew that would be mine for the evening.  Appetizers and wine are served and we can't keep track of all the different guys that are serving us. We just can't stop laughing about our weekend and our recaps. We scanned pictures and videos and ate our cheese (all nice selections were yummy) spilled the soup on the white linen.

Our entrees finally arrive; I picked the Blue cheese crusted fillet. Cooked to perfection (medium-rare, more rare than medium) all I remember was just how succulent each bite was. We both couldn't stop laughing with what little sound would come out.

Food, wine and a spectacular friend of mine, the best ending to Vegas and an amazing UnCorked weekend.

But the dishes were delivered by different people, and overall it was very impersonal.  The guy that delivered the cheese was a total rookie.  He just plopped it down and when I asked where the cheeses were from, he responds with ""uh....this one's from France....and this...the U.S....."" and didn't mention if they were cowmilk, sheep's milk, etc.  A $450 dinner needs more polish.

Don't go for the wine angel gimmick; we didn't see any during our meal.

On the other, unless you've won some serious coin gambling and are just spending your own cash, be prepared to walk out of there with a slightly empty feeling, like - that was really good, but was it several hundred dollars for two good?

As soon as you make your way through the casino to the door, you walk down a circular set of stairs around the most amazing collection of wine you will probably ever see.  I won't go on about this because others have mentioned it, but needless to say, it is indeed impressive.  (Guys, there is an elevator there that you should offer to bring your women down in - high heels and this stair case don't go so well together.)  Once we made it down, we were immediately seated. No table in the place seemed bad, although our table was positioned in such a way that one of us ended up sitting on the divider between two cushions, kind of like having to ride bitch in the back seat. Again, small nit, but one would think they would have considered such a thing in a meticulously designed space.

We ordered the 7 course tasting menu but selected our own wine (which you order off an HP Tablet PC.)  The staff were helpful and attentive and not snobbish at all.  Even the wine professionals were courteous and un-assuming.  We probably dealt with at least 6 or 7 people throughout the evening, each of whom brought out different courses and explained what they were.  The food itself was fantastic; appropriately cooked, displayed beautifully, and tasteful.  Dessert left much to be desired however; I suppose that's a risk you take when you are at the discretion of the tasting menu instead of being able to pick out your absolute favorite.

All in all Aureole was a great place to go and I would go back again, but there was just something missing from this place that won't let me give it 5 stars. The ultra-modern decor? The cushion thing? The dessert that was slightly off?  Having to drop multiple c-notes on a dinner?  I don't know - judge for yourself.

It's a beautiful restaurant. Sadly, I didnt get to see anyone go up for wine. My bf even suggest they let us go up for fun! Haha

At first we were a little skeptical with service. From the moment we sat, we waited a good 5 mins for our menu. My bf asked for the menu, momentarily, we saw our waiter walking past our table and then disappears for another 2 mins then he comes back with our menu! PECUILAR much?! Our Bottled water and bread came before our menu, very strange we thought!

Shortly after we ordered, this young photographer comes by and started mumbling something to us, some how we ended up taking pictures. STRANGE? i thought so! LOL she made us pose as if it's a prom picture! HILARIOUS!

They have the coolest wine menu, it's almost like an ipad, but an older version and much heavier! Their wine list is phenomenal, i mean they are the only restaurant with such huge selection of wine! It's quite impressive! My Bf didn't have wine and there wasn't any wine by glass at my interest, so i went with a cocktail. Blood orange maritini! OMG it's so weird, but so good!  I love blood orange! Oh what's weird about this drink is, it had Jalapeno!  Sounds weird Right? But it tasted like fruit punch with a little bit of spiciness. Even my bf enjoyed it! 

So with Appetizers and entrees, we didnt want the prie fixe menu since we've had so many bad experience. 

Appetizers

Caviar - served with little miniture pancake that tasted very much like green onion pancake, the chinese kind of course. Toppings such as egg whites, egg yolks, purple onion, cream cheese, and chives were available. mMmMm it was a party in my mouth! It was so orgasmic; im in heaven! 

French onion soup - it's very tastey and rich. Bf said it's the best he ever had! One can find truffles and foie gras pieces in it :)

Seared foie gras  over toasted brioche and strawberry sorbet! Reminded me so much of the foie gras I had in palazo! AHHHH another orgasmic dish! Huge pieces of foie gras seared to perfection, unforgettable! :) 

Samosa curry salad - looked like little pot stickers! The curry itself was very good, but i thought it was gonna be a real salad, and it wasnt! 

Pull pork sliders - it wasn't dry, but it wasnt to my liking. Still good though better than RN74

As for entree, we had the Seared Seabass - GROSS, very dry! over cooked, we barely touched it. 

Lastly, we had the warm mocha chocolate cake. It didn't taste like mocha, it tasted like a every other chocolate lava cake. It wasnt warm, it was cooled off already.  They also sent us sorbet which i enjoyed a lot. It tasted very unique and different than what I am accustomed to.

Great service, my bf and I hate waiting forever for our food, so we usually let our server know that we would like everything to be fired at once! My oh my was I impressed, Aureole is the only restaurant who brought everything out all at once in a short amount of time! The waiter also took the sea bass off of our bill! :) Great service, will definitely return for the caviar, seared foie gras, and blood orange martini :)",mdCAsnSP3uCH2859UYW66A,0,1,5,3BkRi7nER8RXn8q5oLCrTg

The food was uneven.  Some of the dishes were stellar, worthy of lots of praise and just wonderful to eat. Others were just okay.  Nothing was bad, per se.  The bread options were amazing, and if you aren't Kosher, you MUST try to bacon roll.  We did the tasting menu, as one of the people in our group had a good night at the tables.  Note: you may need a good night at the tables to pay for it, but if you love food and the pomp around food, it may be worth it for you.  We were a fairly chatty crew, and we did not feel out of place, but a quiet elegant dinner would be equally possible there as well.

We are all about the bar food - looked forward to hanging out in the Tower Lounge and watching the wine angels float up to the top to get that coveted bottle of wine.

So we get there at 9:15pm and were prompted seated in the Tower Lounge bar. Ordering wine is not the easiest thing to do in this place. With over 50,000 bottles or whatever they have, it's hard to figure out what to get. Plus, in our price range, I had no idea what would be better - the unoaked Chardonnay from Australia or the Sauvignon Blanc from Chile.

The waiter/maitre d' guy was no help so he sent over someone pretending to be a sommolier. When I asked what he thought of the unoaked Chardonnay, he replied ""Well, it's good. It's an unoaked Chardonnay so it will be less oaky."" WTF? 

Whatever, I ordered a bottle and we decided on a couple appetizers to start. But get this - the appetizers arrived before the wine did.

And I was barely finished eating when the busboy/annoying ahole picked the plate off the table. I am ALL for clearing the table after dinner, but come on...

The waiter dude didn't even ask if we enjoyed the wine or the food.

Then - at 9:50p, he drops the bill on our table and thanks us for coming. Really? We were in and out within 35 minutes? You have GOT to be KIDDING.

We were lucky to be in Vegas during Restaurant Week so every dining establishment offered special prix fixe menus for $50 so we took advantage of that. The appetizer selection said ""choose two per person"" but we figured, no way ... but indeed, it was true. They weren't small plates either -- the appetizers alone (we had the hoisin-style calamari, ceviche, steak and naan, and artichoke dip) filled us up with goodness. But we had to get through two regular-sized main entrees (I had the porcini and artichoke ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale) and totally forgot they came with sides until those were set a few minutes later -- yeesh. 

Oh, and a quartet of desserts to end with -- what can I say? Top it off with impeccable service, and you have quite the winner. 

The only ""complaint"" I have (and I don't know if it even falls as one) is that the waiter assured us these plates were small since, after all, it is a tasting menu -- and as I said, if those were tasting plates, they must've been from Green Giant land.

Not only did he made recommendations, he called and made reservations for us and called us the next day to confirm.  Talk about taking that extra step!  

The food - wow.  Beyond good.  Each course I found myself saying, ""no, this is my favorite.""  ""Oh, this one!  This is my new favorite.""  Each course was better than the next, which is saying something when the first course is so outstanding.

Maybe because my expectations were so high...  But I went to Aureole in the Mandalay Bay in Vegas last Thursday evening and the service was horrible..  And food extremely disappointing..  
Maybe it was an off night or something, but neither the food nor the service redeemed itself by the end of the night..  
The Amuse was not so amusing..  Some cauliflower soup thing that had no wow factor whatsoever..  We both had the foie gras appetizer which had way too much going on and the flavors just did not do it for me..  I mean foie gras is foie gras..  I love it in any preparation, but c'mon now..  
Then I had the Escolar, which is a fish that a adore!  Every time I have had it, it was so yummy and buttery and this time it was grilled, but completely overcooked and so dry and unseasoned it seemed..  I only had a couple bites and could not even bring myself to eat any more..  Yes, it was that bad..  MM had the Salmon and he let me try a bite of that and I thought 'Eh...'  I make better salmon than that...

And what's the deal with that ridiculous electronic wine tablet!?!  
I mean, what are they paying the Sommelier for?  We tried several times to have them get rid of it and they finally got it out of our way after saying so at least 3x...  So needless to say, the servers were extremely inattentive..
For dessert we shared the Artisan Cheese plate and there 7 or 8 different cheeses and they plopped it down in front of us with no explanation of what they were..  We tried to get someone's attention..  Anyone.  Nothin..
So we decided to just have a go at it and I tried to guess myself what cheese was what..  It was ridiculous..
Finally after a long while, we flagged someone down and 
they were like..  'Your server did not explain your cheeses?'  
'Uh, no, not at all...  Hello, a little attention here, please!..'
To top it off that person, was rude as well..  Not to mention the fact that the servers were too busy cleaning up and putting chairs and tables away, that we felt like 'the door couldn't have hit us faster in the ass on the way out' to boot..

Everything was first class and top notch from the service to the food and the atmosphere. It was pricey but well worth every penny.

1517639,2016-01-10,3,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Dined here a couple of nights ago. Was in town for a conference and restaurant was recommended. We had a 915 reservation. Of course when you have a wine collection as expansive as this one it is quite the spectacle. The decor and ambiance is very nice as well. But for me, that is where the fine dining experience stopped. 

The entire night was thrown off starting with before dinner cocktails. The table ordered two manhattans that came and were so far from manhattans they could have been called San Diego's. I make a very good Manhattan and have no issue 1) telling you what's wrong with yours and 2) how to make it the right way. I asked the waiter to ask the bartender what they did because it was so far off and the answer was far from what I tasted the difference was. At any point they did not charge us for the drink that I would not take more than half a sip from and then made a much closer to regular Manhattan that clearly showed the first drink was made without focus. Although, the second was closer, it was weak and so small it was ridiculous. 

The restaurant mgr (at least I think that's who he was) came to take our order. He was wearing a suit where our waiter wore a vest and tie I believe, was in my opinion rude. He rushed our appetizer order. Rushed our food order and at no point was capable of providing a pleasant experience.  For example, there were four people in our party and his recommendation for an appetizer was three small ravioli. Which our waiter told us would not be good for us and provided another suggestion which we had him change to. 

Our waiter was nice, although his knowledge of the menu was questionable. He made good recommendations but when we asked what the side car dish was with the steak his answer was ""the chef changes it every couple days, I don't know"". You would think at some point he would ask the chef and answer the question. 

Honestly I could go on and on about the food and how mediocre it was. I ordered the bone in rib eye. Don't hate me but I like my steak medium well plus. The waiter said he would order it well but the chef would not dry it out. Well, it was very dry. It was served on these steel type plates/trays. Which was cool BUT. A cold steel tray will make a cold ass steak. A cold ass steak becomes a dry ass steak (and I'm not trying to say aged). We ordered roasted Brussel sprouts that ended up being steamed Brussel sprouts. The mushrooms were meh. I would send a picture of my steak but it wasn't picture worthy. I did take a picture of my friends chicken stuffed with crab. But you'll see there's no chicken and it wasn't finished. The other two dishes were rib eye medium rare which the person loved and the osso bucco which was tender. 

The desserts were okay but not my speed. 

I can sum this up best by saying a picture is worth a thousand words. If you look at the pictures from years ago in yelp from this place and anything recent. I feel you will see a drastic difference. Before the food was inspired, now the food is uninspired and tired. Maybe it's time for a change.  Anyone can have a huge wine collection in the Mandalay bay to get people in. But in 2016 in Las Vegas there are too many great experiences for dining to be had to perform the way this place is currently performing. If it wasn't for the ambience and the wine tower (which in this day and age the wine angel thing is played out, it should be automated if you ask me) I would've given it a one. That would be based on food, presentation, service and professionalism.",IGrsArXtZnRUdfsF_ecz1A,2,0,2,mtj_keu9GylKjJngc8uD9w

The concept of ""wine angels"" sounded really cool and, online, the menu looked really good. While the restaurant is certainly elegant and upscale, the service was terrible. We ordered wine from a massive and confusing electronic list of wines brought to the table by a person believed to be our waiter. However, after waiting about 30 minutes, we still had no wine and had to flag down the bus boy for more water, as well as finding someone to tend to the wine order. The appetizers were good (I ordered a cheese plate); however, they would have been complimented by wine. When our wine finally did arrive, it was brought by a completely different server, and our waiter was no where to be found. 

Then our entrees arrived, one of which was not what had been ordered. Once the correct plates arrived, they were delicious, but our experience was already tainted. We were never able to order more wine, and never received more water. In fact, the only person who was attentive was the woman who brought around bread. Although we were given a complimentary dessert (a plate a small cookies), it paled in comparison to the poor service. I've received better quality service in a truck stop. Though the food was good, for the price we paid, the service should be top quality as well. And while the impressive tower of wine is cool, we saw one wine angel the entire night.

This is a unique venue with its hallmark multi story wine vault that requires a bungee cord system that vaults a person up in the air to pick out a bottle of wine. Very gimmicky, but entertaining.  The setting is initially very impressive, but it gets somewhat odd upon further inspection as you can kind of see a hotel employee entrance on the bottom level (not hidden too well).

The food and service is what you would expect given the prices. It's tasty and quite good, but price is definitely on the high end even for fine dining. I had a filet, duck fat fries, and a salad --- and all were tasty. They didn't leave me floored though, and I kind of wish the duck fat fries were more crispy (they are extremely thick which makes it difficult to crisp).

Good:  the restaurant decor is very nice and the wine tower is impressive.  We only saw a wine angel go up once and I honestly expected more flips and stunts.  We were in Vegas, afterall!  I know, wrong show.  

Not so good (nothing was ""bad):  We went during Restaurant Week and asked concierge to call for a reservation.  Why our reservation was for 9:45, I will never know.  The restaurant was barely 1/2 full when we arrived.  We were presented with only the Restaurant Week menu and we had to mention the wine paring option.  Loved the way the server told us that he would honor it because we knew about it.  First he denied it and then he would honor it.  Whatever!  The food was good but a bit too much going on.  I had the braised octopus and lobster salad.  There were fingerling potatoes, a toasted piece of bread, eggplant, hearts of palm, the octopus, lobster, and some greens on this thing.  Pick it apart and it was excellent.  Everything tasted great.  Put it all together and you have a huge bite going on but it was too much!   Same thing with the entree.  I had the short rib with ahi tuna.  There was a gnochhi pieces (very good!!) and pureed broccolli on the plate too.  Again, each thing by itself was amazing!  Then I had the peach tart for dessert.  I was expecting more of a flaky crust.  This was more of a bread crust.  Good, but I prefer flaky crust.  My friend had the chocolate dessert and it was very rich.

1618921,2010-10-07,3,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I'm not gonna lie, I'm pretty horrified by the experience I just had at Aureole.  I've been there for happy hour and it is fantastic.  Two for one small plates, wine and cocktails are pretty amazing.  And those sirloin sliders are unbelievable (the two stars are for those...and the happy hour).  But I have to say, the dinner experience was just weird and offensive.

To start, I walked in and spoke to the host stand to let them know that our party would have one more for dinner.  It was then told that they did not have my reservation.  That was strange, I'd booked with Open Table and had mysteriously already received the points.  Turns out they found my reservation and told me that my party was already seated.  I guess I looked at them funny and they pointed at the table.  Turns out ""I"" was sitting with four people I had never seen before.  So they gave my table away.  No big deal, they weren't that busy, but it was weird that they argued with me that I'd already been seated when I was standing in front of them.

So they said they'd prepare another table while we waited patiently in the bar.  After 30 minutes, no one came to get us so we checked in again...and finally got our table.  You know it's a bad sign when the first thing out of your server's mouth is a giant sigh.  Then he said, ""cocktails, wine?""  No greeting, no smile, no nothing.  We asked for the wine list and he stared blankly at us.  We replied that we had no menus but that didn't seem to matter either.  So much for that Wine Spectator award.  They have a lot of great wines but you wouldn't know it, the servers have no clue about them or no desire to talk about them.  After being pressured into ordering beverages, we finally got menus.

The menus are pretty simple and don't go into a lot of detail.  When the server came back he asked if we would like for him to talk about the menu.  We said yes and he proceeded to explain that they had a tasting menu and an a la carte.  And that was it.  When we asked for suggestions, he muttered something about being really busy.  Then he asked where we were from in a condescending tone.  Ummm...really?  WTF difference does it make?!  You'd think we'd walked in with fanny packs covered in condoms and suckers from a bachelorette party.  

After answering no questions, another server came by and asked if we were ready.  When we asked him to talk about the menu, he went into the same spiel about there being a tasting menu and an a la carte.  Yes, we can read, but what about the things ON the menu???  They kept asking if we were ready but wouldn't answer any questions.  At that point, the bread guy was looking like he'd be a more promising server.  It was seriously like pulling teeth.  One even made a snide remark while walking away.  Most places love to talk about the menu, not this place.

I'd reached a point where I really wanted to walk out.  I'm in Vegas for business quite a bit more than I'd like and I know that almost anywhere else would provide better service.  My friends ultimately decided we would stay and we placed our orders.

Long story short-er, my octopus and hearts of palm salad had two slivers of hearts of palm and fishy, chewy octopus (I actually asked my friends what was supposed to come with the octopus because I could not remember and the only other main ingredients on the plate were cherry tomatoes & fingerling potatoes.  What is with this place and fingerling potatoes anyway?  They're in everything, but anyway).  My veal loin was overcooked despite my ordering it prepared as the chef saw fit and it was lukewarm.  The only good part of the meal is that this place seems to always send over comp desserts.

I know everyone's so amazed by the wine angels, but I would have had a better experience watching the rock climbing wall at the gym.

I now hate this place.  We were treated like an inconvenience rather than valued guests.  I miss Fleur de Lys, I really hope they reopen it.  If they don't and you absolutely must go to this place, only go for happy hour, otherwise you will end up leaving pissed and sorry you wasted your time.",j_xdpXxPdSVhlwTJ7roKag,8,1,2,yujojIln-Fs9bsS5_ruRzw

1726378,2018-07-02,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"This year for Restaurant Week, I was able to join friends for dinner at Aureole.  Their menu had a good variety for each course.  Honestly it's the reason my friend and I chose it because we knew our husbands would also enjoy the selection.  

With our reservation in place, we were seated immediately.  The main dining room is on the lower level.  The hostess brings you to the elevator so the ladies don't have to walk down stairs in heels.  Whew!  But if you want to walk down the stairs, it circles their glass enclosed wine tower in which a 'performer' is twirling on wires for a bit of entertainment.  The service we had was very attentive as well as informative.  

My first course was the Crab Salad.  It was very light and refreshing.  The Dungeness Crab was layered on top of the avocado with taro chips lightly placed on top.  The mango which accompanied it created a wonderful bite when you combined it with the other layers.  

For the entree I chose the Asparagus Risotto.  Somehow I always seem to forget how filling risotto is.  The large plate was creamy with spears of asparagus on top.  I believe they also used asparagus as a base for the risotto.  My husband ordered the beef tenderloin which I had to sample.  Perfectly done medium rare.  Each of these dishes would be ordered again on a future visit.

Lest we not forget the lovely Vanilla Creme Brûlée as my dessert course. Breaking the thin sugar layer on top is just fun for me.  The fresh raspberries delightfully garnished the top edge and complimented it nicely.  

I enjoyed a lovely meal at Aureole and hope for a future return!",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,5,3,4,bpsGl03p9td0rMBCdgxTBw

Pros: EXCELLENT cut of Filet Mignon. The quinoa side dish was flavorful and complemented my steak beautifully.

The walk to our seats was a nice tour around the wine tower to our seats below.

1741337,2012-06-04,14,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"***The food at Charlie Palmer's Aureole varied from okay to below average; I think you could have a decent meal here but probably not a great one***

Aureole definitely feels like a restaurant that might have been great when it first opened (though the standards and food quality are not there now).  The restaurant itself is nice.  The space goes beyond high ceilings with a massive glass wine tower.  The dining area is nice--it is contemporary and elegant (with white tablecloth) and there are big windows that provide a view of the outside greens.

In terms of the menu, there are two tasting menus (a seasonal tasting menu and a parallel tasting menu, which presents a primary ingredient in two separate preparations on the same plate).  There is also an a la carte menu (with some nice sounding dishes).

I had the parallel tasting menu because it sounded like an intriguing concept.  There were definitely bright spots, but there were also some average to below average courses (from the concept not being great to begin with or poor cooking of the ingredients and thus not yielding the appropriate flavor/texture).  Here is the rundown on the tasting menu:

(Roasted baby beets, tangerines, herb cheese, bourbon maple syrup) This dish was good.  I really liked the flavorful and juicy beets as well as the creamy and lightly tangy cheese.  The tangerines were just okay (not as vibrant as they could have been).

(Golden beet panna cotta, cured salmon, tangerine lace) The golden beet panna cotta was creamy and did have a mild beet flavor.  The cured salmon was okay in terms of flavor, but I would have preferred more freshness and moistness.

(Diver scallop, white asparagus and scallop terrine, wild mushrooms, asparagus, yuzu froth, trout roe) I thought the scallop was good.  It was very fresh and moist and had a good outside sear (though it was a tad salty).  A lot of times, froths/foams taste of nothing, but the yuzu froth here was surprisingly strong.  With the slight saltiness of the scallop and the strong yuzu flavor, this dish was not as light as it should have been.

The asparagus terrine was okay--I was not a fan of the gelatin-like texture and I thought it kind of tasted of nothing.  The garnishes of wild mushrooms, roe and asparagus were fine.

(White asparagus, crispy Serrano ham, black peppercorn gastrique) I like how white asparagus pulls apart like green onions and these were a good representation of that (nicely cooked).  The Serrano ham was crispy and salty.  Like the scallops, I felt this dish should have been lighter in flavor.

(Roasted Niman Ranch pork tenderloin, wrinkle potatoes, grilled baby leek, romesco sauce) This was a very below average dish.  The pork tenderloin was visibly overcooked and it was quite dry.  The sides and romesco sauce were not bad (the wrinkle purple potatoes were nice and tender), but they were not great either.

(Pork sausage, crispy rock shrimp, steamed bun, cucumber salad) This dish seemed way too close to its Asian/Vietnamese basis.  The flavors and fragrances were okay, but I think you could get a much more flavorful and fragrant dish at a good Vietnamese restaurant.

The only element that really stood out was the crispy rock shrimp--very moist but also a light and crispy outside.

(Ginger beignets, poached strawberries, lychee sorbet, lime rind) The ginger beignets were very disappointing.  They were filled with a ginger custard.  And because of this, the kitchen had to probably chill the beignets.  Unfortunately, the beignets were not evenly warm.  They were half cold, which was disappointing (especially when you think beignet, you think something hot, light and fluffy).

The lychee sorbet was cool and refreshing and I really liked the lime rind (small but very strong in flavor).

(Coconut ginger vacherin, braised pineapple, vanilla Chantilly, meringue) This dessert was okay.  The vacherin was creamy and cool.  It was filled with pineapple and there was more of a pineapple flavor than a ginger flavor.  While I thought the dessert was kind of a standard dessert, I really liked the braised pineapple (sweet and not too tart), which looked like ginger.

There was also an assortment of below average complimentary bread.

In terms of service, the food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.  I thought the female servers were more personable and pleasant than my main male server (who was still polite).

For a fine dining place with a notable chef backing it, the price for their parallel tasting menu was not as high as other similar Vegas spots.  The food was disappointing though and given the lack of quality, it felt overpriced.

Aureole may have once been a good fine dining spot, but I am not sure if you can get a great meal here now.  If there was more attention to detail (and better cooking/preparation of the ingredients), you might be able to get at the very least a decent meal here.

The wine angels were cool to watch.  I kind of dug the pc wine tablet, but the battery died on our first one and wiped out our selections (making our NY sales rep rather cranky).  They quickly brought us another, but with all the options, we couldn't remember what we'd originally ordered.  The sommelier was quick to help us make new choices, and we were off!

Amuse Bouche:  Sunchoke Soup - Delicious, but I thought it was kind of odd that they would bring a non veggie item for everyone to taste without announcing the vast amounts of bacon in it...  what if one of us had been a vegetarian??

My Choices:  To Start  - French onion soup with foie gras and truffles AND puff pastry top....  ummm...  yummy!!!  Verrrrrry rich.  Honestly, I could have stopped there.  Main - Roasted rack of lamb (med/rare...leaning more towards rare) with nicoise olives, preserved tomato and braised flageolet beans... very happy with my dinner.  I love it when a dish comes to the table perfectly seasoned!

J:  To Start  - Scallop trio which consisted of a truffle encrusted scallop, a scallop wonton, and scallop ceviche.  He snarfed it all down in record time (unlike his wine...which I was all too happy to help him with...  LIGHTWEIGHT)!  Main - Surf and Turf:  Braised short ribs and butter poached lobster.  He ate all of the ribs and lobster, but there was a little dish of some sort of seafood mousse that he did not enjoy at all.

Sales rep:  To Start - Ahi Tuna Duo:  He said it was delicious.  There was tuna tartare over Comice pear chutney, and seared tuna with ginger and cilantro.  Main - Surf and Turf:  same result as J.

The rep insisted on ordering a dessert while J continued to struggle with the 3 large glasses of wine he had accumulated...  Lydia to the rescue!!!  Unfortunately, this led to me being just drunk enough to let our equally inebriated sales rep spoon feed me some of the chocolate souffle.  Hmmmm...  only slightly humiliating!  Oops!

The service was awful....the bartender was tending to some drunk folks with an apparant familial connection to the place. The burger sliders were raw AND cold. The cheese plate was unimaginative and stingy. Was this cheese from Kraft? The wine selection was over the top pricey. A manager-like well dressed man was trying hard to tie up loose ends, but to no avail. 

Slightly less than mediocre experience from start to finish. When we informed the employees gathering at the hostess stand, they seemed less than interested. We could have been at an Outback for this type of attention. But wait, we would have recieved more concern and better service at Outback.

1931277,2007-01-16,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I have to agree, it's good but not great.  

The wine tower is cool and I loved the handy electronic wine menu (an HP Tablet).  I could have played with that all day but then... I'm a wine dork.  Service was helpful, if a little pretentious...   they did get us out in time to catch our show, though, which was appreciated.  The sommelier we had (a vivacious blonde woman) seemed to enjoy her job and was helpful ... not snotty at all.    I liked her.

They have a three course and a seven course menu.  We had the three course with a Champagne cocktail to start (I had the Champagne Negroni) which were quite good, even if they were totally overpriced at $21 a glass.  

Unfortunately, the food was not up to par.   

I had the Scallop Trio appetizer.  The scallop wonton was good but nothing special,  the truffle encrusted scallop was not at all encrusted... just a seared scallop sitting in a mysterious bland sauce... I tasted no truffle at all.   Finally, the ceviche spring roll was covered in some sort of creamy green sauce that didn't taste like much of anything.  Not spicy, not sweet, not savory.. just kind of nothingness.  Disappointing.   I would have liked the two hot items to have actually been hot, as well.  Meh.

My friends Black Mission Fig and Roquefort Tart w/Serrano Ham was good.  I love that kind of combination of sweet, salty and rich.   However, I felt like it too could have been warmer.   

For my main, I had the Organic Roast Chicken with Fricassee of Fingerling Potato and Pearl Onion, Truffle Infused Jus...   
Sounds great huh..?  But no, not so much.  Just your average roast chicken...  I've had better elsewhere and again, I didn't taste any truffle.   Portion size was quite large and I ended up leaving more than half.   I guess some folks would appreciate that but I hate wasting food so it just made me sad.

My friend had the Surf and Turf (braised beef short rib, butter poached Maine lobster, spinach mousseline) and while the short rib was rich, delicious and fall apart tender, she was disappointed by the beefy sauce that covered entire dish, including the lobster and hence, the lobster flavor. 

Her husbands Kobe beef special was also just okay, IMO.  I've had far better Kobe at Sent Sovi in Saratoga and the foie at Picasso was superior as well.  Not worth the extra price tag, IMO.

Dessert was the cheese plate for me, which was good but featured nothing that I hadn't had before.  Some hard to find artisan cheeses would be nice.   My armagnac was great though.  A first for me, and now I'm corrupted forever. 

My friends lemon verbena creme brulee was very good.  Light in flavor and texture with a thin crust.  Really nice.  

Overall I would go back for the entertainment value of the wine list but only if someone else was paying.  There's simply just better food to be had elsewhere in Vegas.  Sad to say.",8qtsJtmefjJZIFM6_Ksd7A,0,2,3,RIKJ7wkH4voWF80mrffWsg

However, we did not order wine, but the huge wine tower was cool. The lovely ladies of Aureole would be hoisted up by some sort of pulley system to reach the wines. 

We got there around 6:30PM and were told by the hostess that the next available table would be open at 8:30PM! So be aware, make reservations if you want to eat here. However, they did have open bar seating which you could order off the whole menu, so we went there instead.
We ended up sitting at a booth and there happened to be happy hour (even on a Saturday!) until 7PM that night. I tried the Watermelon Gazpacho, sliders, and a fish dish (I can no longer recall... because... Vegas).

The sliders were very cute and delicious, but I was not a fan of the Watermelon Gazpacho. Perhaps it's because I'm not a fan of watermelon in general, but I just thought it was too cold and hard to eat (it came with one giant cracker). 

I believe I ate some kind of Ahi Tuna dish which was pretty delicious, the fish was seared rare and of good quality. 

I really liked the environment of the restaurant, I think you have to dress business casual for this place, but it was hard to tell given that I went the weekend before Halloween

The problem is our alway opposite side of the spectrum taste finally took form when I went to San Francisco and she went to Chico. When I realized her birthday dream was going to be about grabbing a slice and walking around New York New York marvelling about how it was sort of like the real thing. I took off and decided to live it up for her. One of the places I found myself was at Aureole's lower bar. Three really handsome men approached me and asked if they could buy me a drink. ""Each?"" And before I thanked my lucky stars I tried to explain to them I wasn't in the service industry, because they might have had the wrong idea. By the time I finished that song and dance in a way as to not cause embarassment for any of us, their table was ready. And they asked if instead of a drink, I could join them for dinner. ""Why not?"" The food was incredible. Those three were there for a bachelor party, figuring why not just keep the group small and go really big. I became a mascot. They ordered every dessert on the menu, incredible wines, and were eyed with curiousity by the rest of the patrons. I was set up to steal the 5 inch ring binder that carries their list. I failed at that. But not at getting us into Rum Jungle later that night. Those crazy Canadians, saved my best friends birthday.

We walked alllllllllll the way from Imperial Palace to Excalibur and then took the Tram to Mandalay Bay, took us a WHOLE HOUR!!!! Under the blazing summer scorching sun. No doubt we took the taxi back HAHA.

When we arrived to our 6pm reservation, we were shown to the lower level where the whole entire restaurant sits! Trippy!! We drank tons of water and then presented our $50 GC from restaurant.com. They gladly took the coupon. There was no snobbish service, but we were not shown the fancy electronic menu many people talked about :'(. They had already assumed that we weren't going to purchase wine from that menu -____-;. Well, fine. We won't order it then. HMPH.
We'll just order from our cheap-o Wine Menu then. WHICH wasn't bad anyway because my BF enjoyed his wine a lot..... (GO CHEAP!!!)

We ordered the seasonal prix fixe. $65/person. 3 Courses.
Since there were the two of us, and the menu allowed only one person to choose ONE of the two. We were able to try everything on this menu.

Here's my noobish review on the food:

Bread: Got the Baguette and Bacon Foccacia. BACON FOCCACIA FOR THE WIN!!!!! NOMS!!!! Too bad it wasn't warm :T

Arugula Salad on Crispy Miche Tartine, rhubarb compote, shaved parmesan cheese
-I thought this was very refreshing, especially after a looooong hot walk. But the arugula started tasting really bitter after many bites. This is a pretty decent sized dish for the first course. The itty bitty extras on this dish complemented the salad well (like the strawberries and the florals) but still I couldn't handle the herby bitterness of it. So my BF happily devoured it, in fact, he actually loved the salad.

Chilled Spring Pea Soup, rosemary roasted ham croque-monsieur
- Honestly, we didn't enjoy this one as much. It's good at first, but then there was so much of it (big bowl) and we got sick of it. This soup is only for pea lovers, I'd say. My dad would hate this because he hates peas with a passion, it's quite funny. The croque-monsieur did save this dish a little bit because it was warm, toasty and yummy and complemented the soup well... but not the entire soup itself. We only ate half of it-at most.

Grilled Cajun Prime Hangar Steak creamy bacon sweet corn, roasted green chilie aioli
-Holy moly, this was probably the best dish here or in fact the BEST dish of mine and my BF's entire weekend in Vegas!! We ate a lot of good food this weekend too! Jeez the steak was SOOO tender and the flavor was just right!! You get the kick from the cajun seasoning so that was cool. And it sits on a bed of corn... and mashed potatoes?? I don't know what it was, but this dish was freakin' delicious!! I'd definitely order this one if it's still on the menu.

Oven Roasted Wild Northwest Halibut preserved lemon and parsley risotto / lobster
- This one was also VERY good. Didn't wow me like the steak, but this was so flavorful and the Halibut was so meaty delicious! You can definitely taste the lobster flavor and if you're lucky, there's a teeny lobster piece for you to enjoy too! What I liked is that there were a few veggie pieces in this dish. I wish they added more bc I love vegetables!! but the fish was REALLY good. Won't be disappointed.

Bananas Foster Tiramisu Parfait, banana cardomom ice cream
I LOOOOOOOVED THIS DESSERT!!!! I loved the spices and the ice cream was so soothing after a big meal. NOM NOM NOMS!!! This was the BFs but I just stole it from him hehehehe.

Dark Chocolate Spearmint Bar, vanilla ice cream
I ordered this one and MY IS IT CHOCOLATEY! No doubt, it was very good but I think this could only be ordered by absolute-chocolate-lovers and actually finished by them too.

Petit Fours:
Madeleine, Meringue, Shortbread type of cookie, chocolate, etc
Delicious :)

The french onion soup could have had a deeper flavor, it was borderline bland. They cook it with a puff pastry on top. The puff pastry was slightly underdone and was slimy. The cheese on top that was cooked to a crisp was very good though. There were 2 pieces of foie gras in it, both of which were decent, although the flavor diluted. 

The octopus salad was the worst octopus I've had. It was dry and tasteless. I sent it back and received the agnolotti. This was significantly better, but the pasta was a little thick. The mushrooms were very good. 

The seared foie gras was very good. I liked the huckleberry but wasn't a fan of the samosa or carrot puree.

The food, overall, was pretty good. I had the parallel tasting menu, which included shrimp two ways (ceviche with avocado, crispy with chili sauce), roasted sea bass, rabbit with truffles and fettuccine, beef loin, sweetbreads, and macaron and creme brulee for dessert. The rabbit and the desserts were the main standouts for me. My friend had the wine pairing along with it, but he said the pairings were not all that great.

The other highlights food-wise were the onion soup served in puff pastry, and the dessert sampler. 

Okay. Now for the rest. I hope you're not going anywhere.

The service here was ATROCIOUS. Call me crazy, but if I'm dining at a one Michelin star restaurant with a group of people whose tab is over $1100 bucks, am I wrong to expect service that's better than my local Chili's? I guess so.

We were seated by one waiter/captain and ordered drinks. My friend's wife ordered a glass of wine, and another person ordered a cocktail (amaretto sour). We then proceeded to order dinner. About half the table wanted the tasting menu, while the other half wanted to go ala carte. The waiter said that would be just fine. We also indicated that we were going to be paying separately...also told that would be fine.

Food service began. Those that ordered the tasting menu got their food first. The head waiter/captain (different guy now) failed to describe all of the courses after they were served. He totally flubbed the dessert course...basically seemed like he had no idea what they were serving. The half of the table that ordered the tasting menu got almost all of their food before the other half got theirs, so half of our party just sat there twiddling their thumbs while the others ate.

Finally the other food came out. Several people ordered steaks. None of them were asked if their steak was cooked to their preference. My friend's wife that ordered one glass of wine? She was brought two, for some reason. She also ordered a side dish that was never served. 

Throughout the meal, no water glasses were refilled. I had to ask each time for more water. Empty cocktail glasses sat unbussed. Breadcrumbs were never swept away. Empty sweetener packets were left on the table. 

After everyone had eaten, they brought out dessert menus. We looked but opted not to order anything. For some reason, two desserts were brought to our table. We thought that since no one ordered anything, these must have been given to us gratis. Nope! They showed up on our bill.

Speaking of the bill. Like I said earlier, we had indicated that we were going to be paying separately. The waiter told us that he couldn't split it for us, but if we wanted to personally divide up the check he could put it on multiple cards. We gave in and did it. As we're tallying up the tab for everyone, head waiter dude comes back and basically chastises us, saying ""you know, if you would have told me at the beginning of the meal that you wanted the check separated, I could have done it then. But now it's too late."" Really dude? Fuck you.

The last straw was when we finally had our bill sorted, everyone paid and signed. As we're leaving, dipshit waiter guy runs up to us claiming that one of us (me) hasn't paid. Bullshit. I said my bill is on the table. He says no, I never saw it. So I walk back to the table, and it's under a fucking napkin. Good job Einstein. Never thought to look there?

The service at this restaurant is honestly one of the worst service experiences I've ever had. I almost feel like because we were a party of nine, and gratuity was automatically included, that they just said ""fuck you we're getting tipped no matter what."" If I'm dropping that much coin I expect things to run much more smoothly. It's a shame, because the food here isn't bad. But then again I've had much better for much cheaper. I can't imagine any reason I would ever come back here, especially with the multitude of other fine dining options available in Las Vegas.

You are directed around the infamous wine tower to the second hostess station where your table is prepared within five minutes (even if you have reservations).  

I think we had a small army of three or four people waiting on our table.  The somellier with his iPad device of wine to order from and there when needed if you have questions or need to be topped off.  We had a waiter to explain the menu and take orders.  Then there was the person or two who brought the food to the table.  Then the manager circulating.  This is a the definition of hospitality.

Food had the highest quality of ingredients, cook to perfection, all with fresh energetic flavors, and you were really able to taste the meat and each individual ingredient.  

The food was affordable for what you were given.  I feel they had more $200-$400 bottle of wines than $200 and under and it was a bit tough to find a reasonable bottle that would be perfect with everything.  Thats why we got two.  Caaching.

Some of the servers are excellent, and others can seem a little more pretentious. In general, the food is very good. I did the pre-fixe menu the 1st visit, and it was a while ago, so I don't remember what I had, but I remember liking it enough to come back. At that time, the server even brought me some extra goodies for free, so that was nice. 

They are also on restaurant.com, so you can get a pretty good discount here. On my recent visit, I ordered the butternut squash ravioli with duck confit. This was a very nice mix of flavors. The foie gras was also good, but I actually had better foie gras the night before at Stripsteak next door.  The cheese plate was good. I also had the salmon, which was good but not great. I definitely enjoyed the pre fixe menu I ordered on my 1st visit better than the choices I made on my most recent visit. So the take home message here is not to trust myself to know how to order properly :)  

Also, they bring an assortment of four breads at the beginning (including pretzel bread), but they are all served cold, which is not pleasing. Who likes cold bread better than warm bread? Plus, they seem very excited about their wine list and the ""wine angels"" on harnesses who go get your wines for you. I have a better idea... why not charge admission and strap the guest into the harness and he/she can go get his/her own wine. Dinner and a ride! 

I want to give them 3 stars for the most recent visit, but 4 stars for the initial visit. I guess I rounded up. The overall average rating of 3.5 stars is very accurate.",i9JyPv8YyngL1Rzl_Cmc8w,0,0,4,9y3p0_JHlrJ_Vi60JI-eqQ

The only complaint I have is our wait staff took us straight to the ""downstairs"" seats, which requires to order from their set menu (it's $20 more than the upstairs seats). When I found out about it, I requested to be seated at the ""upstairs"" table (which allows me to order from regular menu or set menu for $20 less). Our stupid server wouldn't want us to leave his table, and I believe it's most likely because he didn't want to lose his chance for making tips. Yikes. I had to ask 3 times, and finally kinda yelled at him to make him give up on us and take us to the regular seating area.

I called down earlier in the day, explained our 'family situation'...and they gave us a little table off to the side, away from the other guests.  So my wife was able to nurse the little guy without making a 'scene' in the restaurant.  Big props to them for that!!

And the waiters were magnificent.  I'm sure it's a tough business to be in, especially in this down economy...but they were just the right amount 'friendly' while still leaving you to enjoy your nice dinner.  They even brought us out some extra dessert for our anniversary.  Another big props for that as well!

We decided to both go with the 3-course Prix Fixe meals @ $65/person.  We both got different items so we could sample the foods.  Overall, the food was great.  But sets of Appetizers and Desserts were simply wonderful.  And my beef sirloin was absolutely perfect as well.  The one 'weak' link of the 7 items we tried was the halibut main course dish.  It was certainly not bad...but it didn't really grab you like a main course of a $65 3-course meal should.  Perhaps we were still thinking about the halibut we had at Rick Moonen's RM place that same day for lunch, which simply had more interesting flavors to go with it AND at a significantly cheaper price tag.

The Gin and Tonic was as good as I've had in a long time!!  Very nice.

If it weren't for that one halibut dish, I could easily give Aureole all 5-stars....because everything else was just about perfect.  The bottom line is that when I pay $65 for a 3-course meal, my level of expectation is very high.  No room for error!  And unfortunately for us, the halibut just wasn't quite up to snuff.

TIP:  Aureole is one of the few Michelin-rated restaurants that will let you bring Restaurant.com coupons.

So on a Tuesday night, we just showed up there hoping to get in for dinner around 6pm, no reservations. And oh yeah, my hubby who usually dresses appropriately, was only wearing a collared golf shirt and shorts and sandals. Presentable but a little under dressed for this place (he felt a little uncomfortable though :). However, they did not say anything and we had no issues getting in! It is a little complicated, they seem to take your name up in the entry way, but then you walk down to the maitre d' and they ask you again the same questions and if you have reservations...we said no, but I guess checking in at the front door counted at having reservations? We were confused...Then they mentioned something about seating on some side area, outdoors or what...we thought they meant this b/c my hubby was under dressed, that that's the only place they would seat us? After much confusion, we figured out that we can sit 'anywhere' we like, and eat a la carte (they had prix fixed which they seemed to push a lot, but my hubby and I eat different things so the prix fix didnt cover both our 'tastes'). 

So, after the confusing entry, we finally decided to be seated in the lounge area by the bar, right next to the glass tower where the wines are stored..It was very comfy sitting there, felt private too (dining room area was getting fuller as the night went on). 

The food was great! I was worried about portion sizes being too small, but it was more than enough. I had halibut, and got a really big piece of it! Double of what I was expecting. My husband had some red meat (steak) he said it was good. The side dish of risotto would've been wonderful except it was VERY al dente...I mean crunchy still..so that was a bit disappointing...We also tried some cheeses for appetizers, they were amazing! We both loved those, had some huckleberries on the plate too! As for wine, we ordered a bottle of Derbes Pinot Noir ($90 or so, later we found out they 'only' double the price, not tripled like we thought they probably did). But I have to say, when you are at this place, you just have to buy a whole bottle :) 

Dessert...was amazing! My hubby had 'cocoa infused creme brulee', which tasted superb! I had some dark chocolate dessert with 'pistachio olive oil' ice cream and was heaven! On the side they also brought us some small dessert treats, so that was real nice too.

We ordered additonal sides of the Duck Fat Fries and the Tuffle Rissoto.  We LOVED both of the those.  Really wished by the end of the night that we would have just spent $30 on the sides and saved ourselves the $200 bill for a disappointing meal.

We visited Aureole after a 7pm show on a Monday night. We ordered the Charlie Palmer Parallel Menu which is a 4-course menu but is served as a ""duo"". The tasting menu cost $85/person but we used a restaurant.com coupon for a better deal.

It made me really sad to see how they served bread here. They precut the bread and left it sitting out for hours. In this arid climate, the bread gets really dry and hard - especially the baguette. 

The duo of crab came first: a crabcake with papaya and a crab/ahi tuna salad with thai curry flavours. The crabcake was okay but the papaya clearly wasn't ripe enough so it lacked sweetness. The crab salad faired better however texturally, it was a bit mushy for my taste.

The duo of salmon was my least favourite course consisting of a smoked salmon rolled in pasta and salmon on top of fennel with beurre blanc sauce. The pasta came out as a large clump of dough -  a total textural violation. The tomato sauce tasted like bad barbeque sauce. It was not good. Fortunately the salmon with fennel faired better but was definitely underseasoned and overcooked.

The final savoury course was a duo of scallop and Australian Wagyu skirtsteak. The scallop dish was done well and was well above the best dish of the night. The Wagyu beef however was tougher than some dried out jerky. Not to mention, it was real skimpy on the yummy sauce that came with it.

Dessert is usually a redeeming point with me. However there were definitely some timing issues with the preparation. The mocha lava cake, which had great flavour, was overdone and dry. The lemon/blueberry semi-freddo was nice but the bottom part that was supposed to be crunchy, wasn't. The blueberry financier was good but was a little too sweet. The best thing on the plate was the blueberry sorbet.

Service was wonderful and engaging. Our server got the wine angel to go up the tower so we could watch without ordering wine. He also comped us the mocha lava cake.

It's most recognizable feature is the two story wine tower that is the feature of the entrance way. If you're lucky you'll see one of the servers gliding up and down fetching wines ordered for tables down below (pretty sure out bottle was not one of them). The space is nice and elegant and even smaller than I expected. We were seated at a nice semi circle table with very high backs as to give the sense you're in your own space. I really liked the format of the menu - everything was prix fixe with lots of choices. We each selected a starter, a main course and two sides to share, as well as two desserts. It's a lot of food, well priced and amble choice. The service was top notch and we even selected our bottle of wine from an old school looking tablet (probably one of the first places to use?). At the end of the day we had a very nice meal but my biggest gripe is that the flavors over all were not outstanding or unique. There were a few bites here and there that were great, but if you took away everything else that made it ""vegas"", it would be a pretty ordinary food experience. I would recommend it for a safe bet for a good time with reliable food everyone can enjoy, the special vegas experience, and all at a good value and service. I would not go for an exquisite foodie experience or something extraordinarily different. A nice option to have the quiver.

They started us with an amuse bouche of three little bites: grilled cheese thing, egg roll and small piece of meat on a stick (I really don't remember the details). Our first course consisted of a yellow fin tuna poke composition and burrata and copa salad. The tuna was nice but hard to compare to the Poke we ate in Hawaii. I liked Erica's burrata salad more than she did because it had a nice kick with the bloody mary granite sauce. We both went with steaks for dinner - mine a NY strip loin with Peruvian smashed potatoes and chimichurri sauce, and Erica had the blue cheese crusted filet. The steaks were cooked well and nicely seasoned, particularly my strip with the exotic flavors of south america. I preferred Erica's more traditional filet preparation and certainly did not need my entire portion. Our sides were garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The potatoes were very creamy, garlicy and tasty but I wished more of those characteristics were found in the spinach.

And, usually, I am not disappointed with the offerings the many celebrity chefs have put such great effort to create.  However, after being disappointed on numerous occasions when visiting this restaurant, I feel compelled to write about it. This last experience was just last night.

So, we descend to the bar level and ask about the sommelier selections available for Happy Hour.  The waiter brings a bottle of Pinot Noir from ""California.""  Not Napa, Sonoma, Paso, Santa Barbara, or Watts, for that matter.  It was simply from ""California.""  We look it up on our smartphones and find that sells for $6.99.  We turn it down and instead, I order a glass of sparkling.  My friend orders a scotch and water.  The sparkling tasted like it was left in a cooler with a plate of cold cuts and cheeses.  It smelled awful and tasted awful.  My friend, who ordered a scotch and water got a tall glass of water that tasted like ... water.  It was so watered down.  It seems to me that a ""sommelier selection"" should do more than leave a bad taste in one's mouth.  Was this guy passing off a bad decision to buy a bad wine on his guests as a Happy Hour?  And, any bartender who serves a scotch and water the way this was served should be horsewhipped!  Used to be that restaurant specials were meant to highlight the wonderful capabilities of the chef and staff..  Nowadays, it seems specials are simply used to clear out the fridge of bad decisions. And, after having written this review, I have to say that Charlie Palmer is a great chef.  He has proven it time and time again.

We were a group of 10 people and again, had the restaurant to ourselves. That's usually a bad indication as it was a Saturday night. Ambiance is clean, spacious and fairly quiet. The music playing throughout the night was very random (sometimes country, sometimes top 40s, etc). 

Quick comment about the bread. It was not nearly as fresh nor tasty compared to other nicer restaurants. The butter it was paired with was too strong in flavor and we were not given olive oil with the bread.

We started off with a few nice bottles of wine, and the 10 of us ordered almost everything on the menu. Notable dishes were the slow roasted beef ravioli, sea bass, and the spaghetti squash. The other dishes were all fine, but not memorable. 

Dessert - maple creme brulee was the best of all the dessert. The worst dessert was the '3 cheesecakes.' They tried pairing blue cheese, brie cheese, and cheddar cheese into these cheesecakes and none of them tasted like dessert nor was it good.

All around a fine restaurant, but given that no one else was in the restaurant, odd music selection, and the terrible cheesecake, I would not go back.",5X80Lkieh8faTXoLB8AZjQ,3,0,3,gnMd-oxFREyfYEEcIp709A

As with most of the famous chef restaurant ventures in the lovely town of Vegas, the decor is opulent. But what makes this place unique is their center column wine rack and the wine angels that retrieve the bottles. About 5 years ago when we came by, the angels were scantily clad Vegas girls. Now, they're fully clothed servers. Eh, I guess they felt the attire to be more appropriate. Whatever. 

Food was excellent, as expected. The wife had the parallel tasting menu. Due to some food specificity, we requested that some components be substituted. The chef had no problems doing so. 

Preparation was impeccable and tastes were truly deserving of praise. The only disappointment was the 2nd course on the parallel menu of salmon prepared 2-ways. Neither were truly impressive.

Service was my biggest complaint. The server(s) were extremely polite, friendly, and present. However, the speed of the meal was painfully slow. Typically, 2 hours is my max allotment. 3 hours really tests my patience. Perhaps the kitchen was backed up. Maybe they just expect you to dine and converse for 3 hours. If so, this is not my type of dining experience.

I found it funny that their happy hour literally only lasted 1 hour (5:30-6:30), but it worked for us timing wise. The place was kind of cold and sterile looking and the staff looked surprised and unprepared for our arrival. For the happy hour specials, they offered a sommelier's choice of sparkling/white/red for $9, beer for $5 and a signature cocktail for $10. They also had several appetizers available for $9. Pretty good deal by Vegas standards. 

Our server had no idea what the wine choices were. So I asked him to find our what type of red they were offering, he walks over to the bar, comes back and says ""Australian"". Seriously. It's a WINE bar and this dude could not have known less about wine. I took a chance and ended up with a decent (not great) Syrah blend. We also ordered several apps, including the Oysters of the day, the Serrano ham, the cheese board, and based on the server's recommendation, the sliders. He failed to mention the oysters were cooked (Rockefeller) and they were terrible. The cheese board literally came with two pieces of cheese about 2 inches square, 4 giant crackers, a blob of honey and two pecans. The Serrano ham was a decent portion, but nothing special. The sliders were indeed the best item on the list - the meat and the truffle aioli were fantastic.

The staff are nearly perfect all the time, and you can see them being managed by this gentleman who looks quite the perfectionist (and whose bad side I wouldn't want to be on).

Yes, it is a tad austere, cold and corporate, but then perhaps I'm not so different myself (at least in some respects).  In any event, I feel very much at home here.

Everyone knows the wine list is extensive and the tower an interesting bit of theatre.  But that isn't such a big deal.

But think about the ""tuna composition.""  Excuse the dollop of yuzu ice cream on it.  Put it aside and out of your mind.  The tuna tartare is truly at the top of of all tuna tartares.  It almost (not quite) reaches the height of the original tuna tartare from Aqua.  The three way smoked salmon appetizer was also great.  The smoked buttery salmon was just perfect.

The John Dory entree was good, though a slightly more crispy (perhaps pan fried preparation) would have been better.  The black cod was great, but only about 30% of the size of the John Dory.  It looked more like an appetizer.  Someone might need to think a bit about portion size.

I'm not really a dessert person.  Frankly, I should have ordered another tuna composition for dessert.  I always regret not ordering more fish.  The desserts were fine, but my dessert opinion doesn't mean much.

We sat down and received an overview of the extensive wine list (handily kept on an ipad) and were presented with the four story wine cellar managed by ""wine angels"" who fly up and down to retrieve your selected bottle(s).  It's stunning.  First, don't listen to folks who ""dropped in"" and sat at the bar.  This place deserves the respect of making a reservation and sitting down for the experience.  Get the tasting menu.  It was $85 per person, and had four double courses, each playing off their own theme.  For instance, course one was ""foie gras"" and had a hot and cold prep.  Very non-traditional preps as well, not just seared and terrine.  

Let me back up though... our REAL first course was the foie gras chicken and waffles.  Are you kidding me?  I prefer not to swear in reviews, but WOW, this was f-ing amazing.  Perfectly seared foie over crispy chicken skin, a waffle, and dark meat bits of succulent chicken.  I could have just ordered three more portions of this with a bottle of sauternes and been happy as hell.

Anyway, after the chicken and waffles came the first foie course, which was amazing.  The second course was a play on squash, the third was a play on ""cheek"".  On one side, we hade grade A5 kobe beef cheeks with some tenderloin and on the other side we had cod cheeks.  Remarkable.  The final course was a play on peaches.  A perfect ending.

The first course was a tuna tar tar, so different that the bluefin tuna at l'atelier...it was stacked on top of some sort of pear chutney....not really my favorite.  But the crab ravioli. God that was so good. 

Squab paired with pan seared froie gras.  God. so good.  The froie gras was so perfect. one of my eating companions had a near orgasm over it, much to the chagrin to the rest of the table.  But inwardly....yes, it was good.

The menu is all prix fixe, with 3, 5, and 7 course tastings, with or without pairings. I've tried all, and the 5 and 7 course meals are a ton of food, so I stick with the three. The menu is interesting and diverse, and I haven't yet had anything that I just didn't like.

As would be expected, the wine list is expansive, and takes the form of a tablet PC so that diners can make their selections from a live database of inventory and the wine angel can go fetch it if it's not behind the bar.

Service is attentive and gracious, with elegantly attired staff swooping in and out delilvering bread, clearing plates, refilling water, etc. You get what you pay for, of course. One doesn't get out of Auroele for less than a Ben Franklin per person, maybe more depending on beverage selections.

The wine collection itself was very impressive, and the interior of the restaurant is beautiful, but the food and service did not live up to my expectation.

We were seated promptly upon our arrival, and my friend and I were happy to have been able to get a reservation before the Keith Urban concert at Mandalay Bay. I started with the petite greens salad with pears, dried cranberries, and a yummy pear viniagrette. My friend had the onion soup, and it was delicious and decadent with a little foie gras inside. 

Our server convinced me to try the monkfish dish on special, and I readily agreed as a love fish, especially monkfish. I was looking forward to the treat. The dish was so creamy it was almost soupy. I generally don't mix cream with fish, not that it can't be done, I just don't generally eat creamy fish dishes. My stomach was more than a little upset after eating half the dish, so I said no to dessert. My friend had the bone-in filet, and it looked and smelled fantastic; however, my stomach was not feeling up to trying a bite. 

I felt fine througout the concert, but felt very sick as we arrived back at our rooms at the Bellagio. I didn't feel well all night, and woke up still feeling off. I  can't necessarily attribute my sickness directly to the food at Aureole, but something I ate there did not agree with me. Everything seemed properly cooked, but I guess I will never know for sure. In the least, that monkfish dish should not have been slathered in soupy cream. For this reason, I probably won't be back. I have many other favorites in Vegas that never disappoint.

Sigh. Maybe I hyped it too much myself? It was, after all, a one Michelin star recipient. What went wrong? 

Well, for the most part although my meal didn't taste bad, it didn't taste particularly great. It wasn't fantastic. For the prices, it was only alright and not something I'd pay for next time. Most of their dishes were un-inspired and lacked the glistening luster of a one Michelin star place. The service was too casual to be consistent in my book and what kind of decent restaurant like this as DRY limes? 

They also don't ask you before re-filling your sparkling water, what if I didn't want to pay for another bottle?

The only dish that saved this meal from a complete lackluster of goodness was their daily inspirational preparation of foie gras. It was truly delicious with the sweet pudding bread that they paired it with. My chicken liver pate was almost tasteless which was very unexpected of pate, and my salmon dish was overcooked, dry and lacked any salmon flavor whatsoever. I even offered it to the rest of the table to share and they all agreed that it didn't taste like salmon at all. Their black cod was alright but then again ... cod as a fish is delicious and difficult to mess up to begin with. I was especially disappointed that although they had a fantastic wine selection that some top names other restaurants had were non-existent in their vast towering cellar of wines.

The room was understated elegance with lots of orchids & candles on the table. The food, from passed hors d'ouevres to the AMAZING French onion soup, steak and desserts was fantastic.

The food is sublime and well-orchestrated. The sea bass was sweet, tender and went so well with the delicate soba noodles and bok choy. The short rib ravioli a culinary delight! Bursting with flavor, but not too salty or overpowering. The dark chocolate brownie with salted caramel sauce and cinnamon ice cream literally melted on our mouths. 

The centerpiece of Auerole is the 4 story wine tower. Hannah retrieved our wine like a gymnast, suspended from a cable doing backbends. We enjoyed a delicious chablis that perfectly complemented our meal.

The dining room is elegant and classy, but contemporary and not stuffy. If really is a beautiful restaurant that is perfect for any occasion that you'd like to enjoy with a date, friends or even colleagues.

2557731,2009-07-18,3,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"It's all about their wine.

Let's put this right out front.  I'm a wine snob.  Check that, i *want* to be a wine snob, I just cant afford to *be* a wine snob.  So of course I selected Aureole because of it's legendary wine list.  Because it's all about their wine.

Walking into the restaurant, the stairwell winds around the famous wine pillar.  Your decent into the eatery gives you a close-up view of the Plexiglas, temperature controlled behemoth. I thought I would get a close up view of the ""Wine Angels"" zipping up and down, but unfortunately, there was no action in the tower, despite the fairly full restaurant.  It was a little like walking through the local wine shop.  A lot of wine, but no pretty women zipping around on cables.  Obviously, Aureole isn't focused on the ""Wine Angels""; it's all about their wine.

I was a little surprised when we sat down with our menus, but were not automatically presented with the wine list.  As an aspiring wine snob, I know that I need to view both menu and wine list simultaneously to pair the best wine with the food I'm going to eat.  That's when I realized the catch to Aureole; They offer -almost push- the fixed price dining with wine parings. Therefore, all the wines being paired that night will not be in the big tower, but someplace far more convenient for the staff.  It makes sense, but I wanted to see girls swinging from cables.   So I asked for the wine list, with the intent of ordering a bottle from the top of the pillar.  It may be all about theie wine, but I can't pass up a good show, regardless of the cost.

I got the wine list - a computer tablet that is so vast, it's practically useless.  You can narrow selections by country, region, and varietal, but not by something more useful to me, like flavor notes, or tower location.  So now I have a list that allows me to select from seemingly every wine in the world, and now I have to narrow it down to one or two.  And I want it to be high up on the wine tower, on the side I can see from my table.  This is clearly not the objective of Aureole.  They want to give you a great meal with a wine they have already selected.  They even charge you an extra $10 per meal if you sit in the swan court, out of the view of the wine tower.  It's all about *their* wine.

Next the sommelier came over to help us with our wine selection.  He was only 15-30 seconds behind the wine list, so clearly we were not expected to actually peruse all 9,865 bottles.  It's more like, ""ok, here's the list you twit, now let me tell you what you want.""  They probably carry your favorite wine, but it's all about THEIR wine.

We intended to spend the evening here, so I figure I'll start with a cheese course (steering clear of the prix fixe menu) and the sommelier unwittingly insults me by saying most people go straight to the reds, since that's what I did in my first 15 seconds with the tablet.  In reality, I was looking up a pricey wine that I am familiar with - so I could ballpark what their price mark-up is.  Now all bets are off.  I tell him I want a bottle from the top of the pillar, so we can see the girls zipping around.  Once we know what that wine is going to be, then we can build our meals around that.  He talks into his lapel like a secret service agent and ZING!  A Wine Angel zips to the top, left and right and back down again in a little flying demonstration.  My mission was a success, and I didn't have to actually get a $2000 bottle of wine.  I was off the hook, quite cheaply, and Aureole maintains their goal of keeping it all about their wine.

As for everything else, we ordered and the food was great.  The sommelier selected wines by the glass for us (that were also the same wines that they were serving with their fixed price meals) and it was all very good.  And we got out cheaper than we would of if we got the 3 course fixed price dinner.  It was a 4 star dinner, and a 5 star sommelier, but his inferring that I was a commoner will cost them a 5 star rating. I am a commoner, but he shouldn't treat me as such.  The atmosphere was also pretty poor - too many tables, and the wait staff was stretched too thin, a real 3 star effort in the dining room.  But as critical as I can be, Aureole earns 4 stars for the excellent wines served with our dinner, because...

2581024,2009-05-10,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"The flagship restaurant of the Mandalay Hotel and Casino, Aureole is architectural and design wonder.  The sleek open space is punctuated by the 3 story wine tower, home to nearly 10,000 bottles  (a fifth of their overall inventory).  This version of Aureole is far different from the small, intimate original in Manhattan's Upper East side, but in Vegas, bigger is better.  Visuals are great and all, but how is the food?  Excellent.  Chef Charlie Palmer's ""progressive American"" focuses on dishes of high-quality ingredients simply prepared and presented.  The menu is straightforward, either choose the 3 course prix fixe or the 7 course ""Celebration of Great American Food"" tasting menu.  Selections are mostly seasonal, although consistent on the menu are the ""Peking"" duck and Colorado lamb, both very good.

Aureole is home to one of the largest and diverse wine lists one will ever see.  Over 2,000 selections and 50,000 total bottles, the list is presented electronically on a wireless tablet PC.  There is an initial ""wow, this is cool"" upon seeing this, in practice it would be best to have a good ol' analog (paper) wine list.  Although I am usually too proud to ask for help selecting a bottle, there is simply too man options here.  The sommeliers are incredibly knowledgeable, and I suppose they had better be with an inventory such as this.  I would prefer to see a better by-the-glass list.

Service was ok not great. The staff wasn't very attentive for an example it took over 15 minutes for the wine sommelier to return to my Table to place the wine order. The wine list was very extensive with a high mark up to match. I felt the ""wine angel"" gimmick was really lame. Basically when you ordered a bottle of wine a beautiful lady adorned in a silver jumpsuit goes into the multistory wine room and does a few flips on the guide wire and comes down with your bottle of wine.  The food was mixed from outstanding to mediocre. I ordered the Cesar salad and it was not that great it was drowning in dressing that tasted it came from a bottle. The bread was served at room temperature and resembled sliced sandwich bread.  My wife had the beet  salad and she said it was excellent and was well prepared. For the main course I had the filet and it was very tender and cooked perfectly  the minus on the filet is that it lacked the rich flavor that one gets when ordering that cut of meat but it was still enjoyable. The dessert was awesome a huge surprise. I had the cream brûlée with a brown sugar whisky like  sauce with a cranberry sorbet and pomegranate on it. This sourness of the cranberry and pomegranate blended so perfectly with the super sweet cream brûlée.  Would I come back again?

Drinks are always stellar, and often when chatting with the bartenders about various liquors, we are offered a free taste or two of this or that. I'll never forget the taste of 1972 Pedro Jimenez that we were given a few years ago - a rarity that is now nearly impossible to find.

I didn't get enough time to scope the place out to try and pick a better spot. But it was a minor thing until a loud couple started snuggling side by side on the bench next to us. Gag.

Aureole is firing on all cylinders and had some nice changes to the menu.   Let me start by saying that the food, the wine pairings and service were all above expectations.

 The tasting menu was enjoyed at a slow pace at our request so we could savor the wines and many courses.   While everything was good, there were a couple star / stand out courses - fois gras - we eat a lot of foie gras and this one was easily in our top few in terms of quality and interesting preparation and wine pairing.    The scallop was also a true stand out.   One of us enjoyed the duck and the other enjoyed the lamb.   Both are good so I would advise if you like duck (crisp outside and rare inside) go for the duck as you don't see it often...

The wine pairings were probably one of the top pairings we have seen done.    Candidly we are generally let down when we go out to a restaurant and order the wine pairings.  Ordering the wine pairing was definitely worth doing here!   And the pours were substantial - particularly given the 8ish courses!   Also a special shout out to our captain / server - Eric - who was very attentive, handled our food allergy issues well and was generally super knowledgable and ""Johnny on the spot"" whenever you needed anything.   The once or twice we needed something I needed only look up - as he noticed the eye contact and immediately came over to check in.",IPFQA_6En6T8DE1-pCaPRA,2,2,5,sSmzYT8ShszIBwytn1Aeog

I've never once received a well done duck breast in a restaurant and I certainly didn't think I'd see it here. It was very chewy and under seasoned and unfortunately my husband had the same experience with his steak. It was marginal, the highlight of his meal was his side of mashed potatoes. I did taste them and they were great, the mushrooms were also fantastic, I'd recommend them both. While my duck breast was a huge disappointment my confit was great, again, drier than I'd expect but it was wrapped in a nice buttery pastry that balanced that very well.

We were seated right away, and the waiter did not clearly explain our dining options, leaving all of us confused.  We finally figured it out, and we all went with the $75 prix fix with a $15 upgrade for ""Today's Special"", an organic Australian filet mignon with foie gras, black truffle shavings, and morel mushrooms.  Well I should have known better, this ""special"" sounded like someone was trying too hard with fancy ingredients, and left me disappointed.
The timing of our courses felt rushed, being asked several times if we were finished.  The courses were served without explanation, other than ""this is really good, better than Kobe beef.""  Hm, another warning sign.
For desert I chose the assorted sorbets, which was served as 6 golf ball sized sorbets in a tray.  Nothing special here, someone missed the quality not quantity class.

The restaurant sits inside the Mandalay Bay Hotel which is one of the more classy of the LV Strip Hotels and the quality of the restaurant lives up to the hotels reputation. 

You enter from the Casino floor but to get to the restaurant area needs an elevator ride to a lower floor. However, from the top of the elevator you get to see the Wine Tower which the restaurant is famed for. More of that later.

I went for the Christmas Menu paired with wines which came in at about $160 so this isn't cheap but you are paying for what you get which is quality food and quality service. Everything was just right with the waiters not being too intrusive but close enough so you knew exactly what was being served and what the wines were.

During the meal we had asked if the waiter could tell us when the Wine Angels would be flying and he reassured us that as we were leaving we would get to see a demo flight. The wall of wine that encompasses two floors is reached by the wine angel by hoisting her high into the sky to obtain your chosen bottle - it's a sight to be seen!

Guys in suits at the bar discussing million dollar deals etc. I loved it here.

It's probably best not to come here if you're on a tight budget. This place costs more for a reason. They have this amazing one of a kind wine tower and floor area. The bar tenders are highly skilled and could make all the drinks I asked for in seconds with no questions asked. This really stood out to me. It was yes sir and here is your drink. 

That's what I like. Super fast excellent service. No waiting. Usually when I order a favorite mixed drink at a typical bar (example: Lights of Havana etc) the bartender looks at me like I'm an idiot. Why? Because he/she is displaying a defensive reaction because he/she doesn't know how to make the drink I've requested. Not here.  

I'm just going to say it:  There is a certain element of people who patron typical bars whom I really prefer not to be around. Thankfully you will not find this element of people here. If you are into socializing with the trash found at local dive bars this place is not for you.You are just going to feel out of place. There are no cheap pool tables. No. sawdust on the floor.

Food:

I have dined here twice.  I do not recall what I had on my first visit, but I know I left happy and someone I was with at the time said it was one of the best meals they ever had.  I went again a couple weeks ago and got the Parallels menu.  If you are unfamiliar that menu comes with five courses.  Each course has two distinct dishes with one common ingredient.  I have never seen anything like this and loved the concept.  Everything was cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed every course.  One of the people I was with ordered the salmon and was not happy with the the dish, not the way it was cooked (overdone).

Service:

The service was done in a team of two.  The first server was very nice, gave us our menus answered any quick questions and then disappeared forever.  Too bad.  Our second server was terrible.  Horrible at answering our questions on the menu, always in a huge hurry, and didn't seem to care at all about the service.  Although I did not buy the wine, I will add this from the person who did:  The electronic menu SUCKS! and our sommelier was great and very helpful.

Far from a Wino (subjectively speaking), it's all just far too tempting. The sommelier is extraordinarily attentive--and why not, he knows that he's got you is his cork calloused fingertips. In fact he was at our table for so long, at one point he had to politely excuse himself to tend other diners. No matter, we were well on our way to an intoxicating evening of--wine of course. I mean there's dining here too, and some it rather good. But you'll undoubtedly have too much wine to remember the sustenance.

I went with a group of friends in town for the Retail Tobacco Dealer  Association's annual trade show. Two of my accomplices were retailers, three were tobacco account executives, one doctor--and his date--and I make eight (""here on Gilligan's Isle!""--ironically for about a ""three hour tour""). Being in the good graces of the Charlie Palmer restaurant family, we got the table in the back by the swan pond, three servers, two visits from the manager, and one gratis mid-course from the chef. But all of that paled in comparison to the--say it with me now--""The wine"". Our resident expert requested the electronic wine list (they actually let us keep it at the table the entire night). The sommelier opened our two corkages then brought out several cheese plates and the first two of of our six additional bottles as we headed for wine utopia. Even the one member of the party who doesn't drink had to get in on the action. He took a sober whiff of several glasses but stayed securely buckled on the wagon.

Now the cheese plate was an ample variety, specially paired with our first four bottles of wine. My appetizer (see photos) was the most beautiful seafood manifestation I have laid eyes on, so much so that I had a brief moment of regret to corrupt its perfect presentation. The chef delighted us with a mid-course sampling of braised duck that made me long for a full entrée.  And the dessert tray was a divine cornucopia of sorbets, cakes, and other candied concoctions. Yet conspicuously absent from my recount are main courses. That is not to say there is nothing to speak of, but in comparison to the grandness of the ancillary offerings at Aureole--there really wasn't anything to sing about.  Perhaps due in part to the fact that, we were forced into the tasting menu since Aureole refused to split the table orders. We were decently satisfied with our selections from the tasting menu but acknowledged that we wouldn't remember it beyond our nightcap at the blackjack table. And with the check plus gratuity grossing $1600 ($200 per person--a significant portion of that being wine) you want to have more to talk about than the wine, the wine computer, the wine pairings and the wine steward.",KJIG4f-w0b-pcv17Wq9GPQ,6,6,4,nF0dhQy7me-tsA4-9x7SXw

That is all he said so I just said well i guess I will go with the chicken. Still keeping a positive attitude. 

2) The food comes (not sure the name of this server but it was the bald guy) He did not say one word at all he threw the plate down in front of me and my husband. Grabbed my husbands empty beer bottle and was about to walk away. I said umm did you want another one to my husband? Still not saying a word he looked at my husband. So my husband says yes i will have another.. Ok at this point you would think he would actually SPEAK to us. Nope instead of asking me if I wanted anything he POINTED at me.. What the hell? WHy the hell do I want a persons finger in my face?! I said NO Thanks and laughed in his face because of his rudeness. As soon as he walked away my husband said what the HELL was that? who points at a person and is this person MUTE? 

3) You would think at some point someone would come fill my empty water glass because the person at the next table had their water filled and it was still half full. Nope my husband actually had to flag them down to get more water. Yes we had to flag them down because they did not bother to come over and at least ask how our meal was. 

4) As stated above they did not come over to even ask how I meal was. We finished our meal the waiter comes over and just says ""I see you are done with your meal want any dessert"" I ask for the dessert menu but honestly at that point I just wanted to get the hell out of there. 

We still gave them at 20% tip because we always give at least 20%. Hey imagine what they would've got if they were actually nice to us? 

I am not sure if the reason they treated us different than the others was because we LOOKED young. Yes I said LOOKED because we are NOT young we are both just very lucky to still get carded. Or was it the fact that I was not drinking. Sorry i am not allowed to drink but you would think they would still treat you the same? I asked for a virgin pina colada but they do not make frozen drinks the only nonalcoholic drink they could offer me was OJ mixed with Pineapple juice.. NO thanks!",QCdMbMs9qhBxrfMcjYQy_A,1,0,1,Bos-KkdnyrQQL1eWdVIm_g
3141417,2015-12-19,1,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,Well... I don't even know where to quite begin with this review but for starters let's talk about how I ended up here by default.. I originally booked for the Stripsteak however they closed earlier than what I expected! After searching the available fine dining options at Mandalay Bay I ran across this place. Booked a 10:15 pm reservation and upon arrival was greeted immediately as well as seated! The ambiance of the place is spectacular! No complaints at all a nice wine tower that greets you as your walking in and just WOW. The winding glass staircase is amazing and you just feel like you're walking into heaven sort a speak. The waiter we had was awesome customer service was great! He had strong recommendations as well as great hospitality! Now on to the food.. No appetiZers or drinks just went straight for the entrees! Colorado rack of lambs ($65) and the 18 oz ribeye ($63) my rack of lamb was excellent and I wanted to try something different but wow for $65 it sure was a baby lamb.. Skip the Mac n cheese for $12 it was AWFUL! I could've made a better batch at home from the velveeta box..The ribeye we ended up sending back because my partner said it was on the level of Outback Steakhouse lol and just the preparation and presentation of it was OFF! We are steak people so we know when a steak is being short changed and this one was terrible! So terrible that we sent it back with an exchange for a filet with a lobster to top it off! Definitely made up for the joke of a ribeye!  All in all not sure if I would return but it was fun to try out..,qPVtjjp8sNQ32p9860SR9Q,2,1,3,omIIEGiNkQk20_EsCAlP0g

On a trip to Vegas November 2010, Hubs and I stayed at Mandalay, so we tried a plethora of their restaurants. I had read that Aureole had a great happy hour, so we headed over to the bar to partake. Two for one wine flights and appetizers. We got, how do I put this delicately...wasted. The wine was plentiful and the appetizers, while delicious (I had my first oxtail) were not enough to stave off the effects of the alcohol.

Our bartender was really nice and attentive. I disliked one of the wines in my flight and he chose another one for me to replace it. He let us play with the digital wine list, and kept a close eye on our needs all evening. After our flights he suggested some desert wines that were a great way to end our Aureole experience and then release us into the casino, inhibitions shorn away!

Overall, a very pleasant experience and I am sad to see the bad reviews Aureole has been receiving lately. I have always wanted to have dinner there but I will wait until things improve.",cjPK-A7G66CNDzfdTw8bqg,2,1,5,qIo-JbAi2_kZ9HI6eIH67A

3168570,2017-03-19,1,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"We came in for a late 9pm reservation since we were scurrying over from one of the PAC 12 tournament games at the new T-mobile Arena. As a result, the restaurant seemed to have a more relaxed setting. We ordered wine, not only because we enjoy wine, but also, we were eager to see our wine ""fairy"" acrobat grab our wine from the glass wine tower, which was so swift but still entertaining. 

My college friend, Sara, was celebrating her birthday so special attention was given to her and she was even awarded a sorbet dessert at the end of our meal! Unique flavors like guava, Berry lemonade, and cotton candy, if I remember correctly, were refreshing palatal delights! This dessert was a surprise and she still ordered that famous salted almond truffle tart covered in chocolate butter. We all loved this! 
I was fairly adventurous and also ordered a fois gras martini that had black truffle cotton candy mixed into it. I really wish I snagged a photo before the waiter mixed it because it was definitely a Dr. Seussian looking mix. It kind of had the texture of drinking egg nog. 

Rewinding to dinner:
Beef and Octopus Carpaccio - the Octopus was sliced so thinly that you barely noticed you were eating Octopus. Each slice was delicately placed in the center of the thinly sliced beef carpaccio. It took some talent to put the two together seamlessly. Pretty decent sharing appetizer overall.

Roasted beet and goat cheese appetizer - goat cheese always harmonizes well with salad type appetizers. This goes the same for beets!

Filet mignon and braised beef shoulder - I'm typically used to filets being pan cooked in butter or oil or both, but this filet had the slight taste of being on a grill. I'd also never had it with braised beef shoulder. I think the fact that it was served with mushrooms and bread pudding won me over.

4x Seared 16oz Bone In Ribeye - my hubby said it's probably one of the best he's had. Prepared medium rare to rare. 

Lamb Loin - very tender and flavorful. Just a hint of gamey which was only enough to discern that you were eating lamb and not beef. Super good.

Saffron Seafood Risotto - Sara's choice. We adored this dish. Some risottos are too runny and some too thick but like Goldilock's would always find, this one was ""just right!"" It was stocked with prawns, clams, mussels, and crab. Most places give you 3 to 5 pieces of seafood and the rest is risotto but Aureole did not skim on the serving. We all had some of Sara's dish and she still was filled to the brim with food! This dish was excellent!

The service was great. We never felt rushed yet the timing was good on clearing the table for the next course so that there was never a dull lull in the evening. Everyone was courteous and the food was great. I definitely return especially if we stay at Mandalay again.",eAJ3Ip0vh-zuk_BmcmchYA,5,4,4,SY1R34W1a9T7VdF0TW_AnA

The four-course meal: I would describe this as a French Laundry experience but with half the courses (again, in a way better than FL, which is not really a businessey type place, imo). Lamb, seafood, and some other very tasty items.

The service: Excellent, everything went very smooth, waiter was very friendly, maybe a bit chatty (I think he is opening his own restaurant in Peru?? sort of nice to know)

The atmosphere: Lives up to Vegas and Mandalay... Especially liked the wine tower with service people going up and down on ropes. Reminds me of Rum Jungle, which I guess has closed?? bummer on that.

He was enthusiastic about the food and wine and just so pleasant to be with. Yet he didn't hover or bug us. He anticipated our needs and was on point. 
The food was spectacular. We had the 5 course tasting menu with wine pairing. The portions and timing of the service was perfect.

First the hostesses were very friendly. They greet you immediately and aren't distracted. Our waiter was very nice and made us laugh throughout the night. You get an iPad at your table to make it easier for you to browse through the drink offerings. I selected a moscato di Asti and it was great. We were headed to watch MJ One so took advantage of the Prix Fixe menu. WOW. Every dish here is just an explosion of flavor. We started off with arugula, burratta, crostini and ham, it also had tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and pesto, the combination sounded strange but the flavors went well together. Next was the prime hanger steak and rock shrimp scampi. With the word scampi I am naive and expected noodles, no noodles here this was the most amazing dish ever. The steak was so tender and exploded with flavor on every bite. The shrimp was amazing. It all sat upon this corn succotash which I am determined to learn to make it was that good! Just when I thought it couldn't get any better they bring out dessert. A German Chocolate lava cake. That was heavenly. It was a lava cake with coconut ice cream. It was one of those dishes  that is so good it transports you to another place and just makes you want to smile. With dessert they serve an espresso infused vodka and brandy cocktail. It was like tiramisu in a glass. 3 courses plus a cocktail all for $58 In Vegas to me is a bargain and I didn't mind paying that much for a meal because it was the best meal I have ever had. The other thing is they don't overfill your plate so you don't leave feeling uncomfortable, just satisfied.

First, because I frequent the Charlie Palmer in Orange County, and wanted to see what else Mr.Palmer had up his sleeve. Second, because the offerings looked beyond enticing. I went with my date, and being the foodie that I am, he let me pick what we were going to eat. To start the dinner off we had their complimentary artisan breads, my personal favorite being the bacon bread (yummm!!!). I decided that the first courses looked more exciting than the seconds, and as we usually do, just ordered 4 things to share: Onion soup, Lobster Cappuccino, Wild Mushroom Risotto, and Roasted Butternut Squash Ravioli. The first course of soups was perfect. The lobster cappuccino was the front runner (I literally wanted to lick the bowl clean), and the onion soup was good but couldn't compete with the lobster. The wait for our second course was kind of long, which our waiter apologized for- and comped us dessert and espresso's, but after our first bite of both dishes neither of us cared about the wait. Both dishes were magic! The complexity of the flavors was astounding. I think my date and I looked at eachother with disbelief several times. Sadly, even though we shard everything, we couldn't finish it all (which I felt really bad about considering how deelish it all was).

The waiter was nice enough to let us order entrees only though. My friend got the surf n turf and i got the halibut. Both were dissapointing. My halibut was not seasoned at all and was a bit fishy but my potatoes and asparagus were both pretty good. Her  surf and turf was a veal and ahi tuna, except they were covered in a marinara sauce that was not so great, and the marinara was not so complimentary to the ahi. At least they were able to redeem themselves with a fantastic dessert! We had sorbet and bananas foster. Im not so much into sorbet, but it was so so so good, and even better was her bananas foster.

We had 12 and a baby and crammed into a round table. The wait staff were constantly reaching over us to fill water or bread. Very tacky when trying to eat and constantly having an arm in your face. That was only the beginning of the nightmare. 

Let's get to the food I had the seared scallops which were delicious the petite filet mignon which was cooked to perfection accompanied by the blue cheese sauce. My wife had the sea bass which was blissful with every bite. Dessert was one of the most amazing creme brulee I've ever had. Now back to the nightmare which was my 40th birthday celebration. Prior to ordering we asked for seperate checks, we were told no problem. We also informed the waiter we had a wine paring coupon he said that once we ordered someone would help with the pairing. Then the manager came over and said this would not be happening and to just order wine and they would subtract the price of our vouchers. Not what I paid for but ok. 

Here is where it gets really bad. Check comes not separated. So we ask for seperate checks again. They are brought out one by one. At this point we've spent 4 hours in this place one and a half of that time was waiting for checks. I'm last to get my check and it is wrong. Then they could not figure out how to take off my pairing which was really not a pairing. So here I am trying to celebrate and these people couldn't figure their stuff out. Then they were claiming someone didn't pay and could we track them down since not everyone wanted to sit at a cramped table any longer. Finally had to write everything down by hand of what we had and they rang us up and checked us out. Worst experience ever.

It was restaurant week, so I'll give them that they were probably a bit busier than usual.  We were a bit of a larger table, so I will say that might have been tough.  The first misstep was when we were in the bar grabbing drinks before and we were scolded by the server for walking up to the bar to get our drinks...after we gave our drink order to the server we never saw our drinks.  We were seated and had to reorder drinks.  So that was a weird start to the evening.  The rest of service was great so it was odd that they had this large miscommunication to start things off.  


Most people at the table got the restaurant week menu.  The first course was a choice of a salad which was frisee, poached egg, foie gras torchon and bacon lardons or a mussel soup.  Most people got the salad, I think they were impressed that they had foie gras on a restaurant week menu.  But it is restaurant week, it was pretty hard to find the foie gras the pieces were so small.  They said it was good though.  I ordered the foie gras appetizer for my first course.  It was a large piece so they definitely didn't skimp on that.  However it wasn't fully cooked through, there were veins that hadn't melted yet in the piece of foie and had to be sawed through with a knife.  Odd.  It was still tasty and maybe it was just a rare misstep.  My boyfriend got the french onion soup and he said it was delicious, it is served with a puff pastry top that is pretty and tasty.  

Entrees we all ordered from the restaurant week menu.  There were two options.  One was a duck leg confit with lyonnaise potatoes and wilted greens.  The other option was braised beef short ribs and seared ahi tuna with kimchee brussel sprouts.  I had the play on ""surf and turf.""  It was the best part of the meal for me.  I was kind of curious what a braised beef and rare tuna dish would be like, but it was just amazing.  The textures and flavors were all just stunning.  It was a hit.  The Duck confit looked good, everyone liked it. 

Dessert options for the restaurant week menu didn't include any chocolate.  I basically don't waste calories on dessert unless it's a chocolate dessert.  I ordered from the regular dessert menu, it was a chocolate tea creme brulee.  It was ridiculous :)  Desserts seemed to go over very well.

I would rate our experience a solid b+  service was actually great after the odd start to things.  Our server was very accommodating and it was nice to be able to kind of mix and match our meals.

People that like desserts would love this - I had 5 minis in front of me when I only picked 1 from the prix fixe.  Bonus!",Plq-ECmdLbLUrrSlld_Vig,2,2,5,_b0lzzwdq-gOKdSiSXh3eQ
3373033,2010-03-14,2,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"My bf and I ate at Aureole in LV on February 13 to celebrate V-day sans the crowds and annoying prix fix menu. I'm a big fan of Charlie Palmer family of restaurants; personally I think it's way better than Michael Mina. Since we had such a great experience at Aureole in New York City, I thought we should give it a second try for the real thing: dinner extravaganza. 

The one thing that my bf pointed out to me while we're walking down to the reception area was that the restaurant has a ""wine angel"" who ""flies"" up and down the massive wine cellar. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the wine angel since we were seated in the area facing the swan pool (yes, there were swans and they were vicious). 

Two things that really stood out during this 3-hour dining experience: our single super chatty and super nice sommelier from Santa Fee (let's call her ""Bertha"" because I don't remember her name; yes, I chose the name ""Bertha"" for a reason) and the incredible food. For those of you who know me, I don't drink alcohol except dessert wine in particular Muscato D'asti. Well, Miss Bertha here introduced me to my new favorite wine: Brochetta D'acqui. I was so digging the wine; I had two glasses (gasp!). At the end of dinner, she gave us two beautiful roses and two bags of the most delicious chocolate powder covered almonds you will have ever in your life. I certainly hope she finds a boyfriend soon because she really seemed like a great gal; lose a few pounds, a little make over (ok, a lot), and some M.A.C. touchup girlfriend can be quite a catch. Let's face it: physical attraction always starts with outer beauty. 

Ok got a little sidetracked on Bertha. We had a five-course tasting dinner menu, and the one thing that really stuck in my head (to this day) was the beef wellington. It is THE BEST single dish I have ever had so far. The foie gras on top of the filet mignon wrapped in puffy pastry was literally heaven on earth. Unfortunately, this dish is not a permanent menu item. But if the restaurant happens to offer it, order it. You will want more; shoot, order two dishes and take one home. 

I give this restaurant a 5-star because overall it was probably the best dining experience I've ever had. Each course was presented beautifully and tasted amazing. The service was very attentive without being overbearing. We were able to take a break between courses, walk around the swan pool and feed the hungry and aggressive swans. One thing about all Charlie Palmer locations: awesome bread selection and you can totally stuff your face with as much carbs as you want. But even without the unlimited bread, Aureole will not let you down. It is a culinary journey that is worthy of your presence (and deep pocket).",HB5Fg19Nm5KhKzXnJOc9pA,2,1,5,jZGiWcSFE9Ds64HMz5_fnw

Mr. Mainini's staff didn't just make sure we had a great dinner, they were constantly (in a kind, professional - not overbearing manner) making sure that an experience was taking place. 

I've visited this establishment for business and pleasure dining and each time, my expectations have been met and exceeded.

The staff's timing between courses, the freedom and comfort of quietly checking in without interrupting conversation, the artistic presentation of the chef's delicious preparations will not only impress, but will keep you looking forward to more.

Here's a neat tip: ask for a tour of the establishment. The staff will be elated to walk you through. There are some neat facts to learn about the place hat you'll remember. It was nicely and thoughtfully designed and knowing the details will give you a greater appreciation for what goes on behind the scenes.

Dinner with swans? The swan lake feature is regal and relaxing. Step outside with your drink and take it in between courses. Look up to the top left of that area at night to see the brilliant MANDALAY BAY moniker on the building's edge. It's a pretty sight adding to the experience.

Even the details inside the elevator (the decor)... you won't pay much attention to it on he way in. When departing, after you've slowed the Las Vegas adrenaline pace with a pleasurable experience at Aureole, you will literally stop  & ""smell the rose"" that is on display.

8:15pm, Saturday night, dinner reservations for 6. We're seated immediately next to our own personal patio with lounge chairs, a fountain, and a swan. Yes, a mother f-ing swan. Alfredo was our attentive waiter for the evening, and we also had a great sommelier. They explained the courses and specials very well and made sure we had enough time to decide and continue our fine dining experience. This man was a professional. Sure, the bottles of Fiji water were $9/bottle, and our drinks were pricey ($8 - $whatever/bottle of beer or wine), but never were we ever wanting for anything, and Alfredo always knew how to time our plates with conversation, extra bread, or exceptional information. Appetizers included the crudo, octopus salad (tender, succulent grilled seafood here), and special-of-the-night gnocchi. Soft pillows of dough and perfectly cooked vegetables awaited me, alongside a thick, but no heavy white sauce. Perfectly seared ahi tuna steaks and divers scallops came next, and a wonderfully light, but perfectly burnt creme brulee finished off the night. Did I mention there is a gigantic wine tower at the front for you to gaze at while you walk down the stairs to your seats?

Points to note - the aged steak is fantastic (you will not get a poorly timed or cooked meal here), the sauteed mushrooms and pommes puree are absolutely a combo you must put together as two sides, and adding a lobster tail to your meal never hurts. If you are going for the 38oz house-special steak, you should definitely split it with someone else. The fact that they cut off the bone and leave it for you on the side is just ridiculous attention to detail. Even when you walk away (and move to your amazing personal patio), people will quickly come around to change your dishes and cutlery and refold your table napkin. This is true fine dining.

Decor: Modern, clean, sleek. Depending on how you view it, it can work for as a great date place or a good business dinner. 

Food: The food was good but not amazing. The portions were pretty generous though. And I don't know if it was by mistake or because they had too much food but we ended up getting more dishes than we ordered--on the house. It was a nice gesture but I was completely stuffed before our entrees even came out.

Spicy coconut lemon grass broth - I'm not a fan of spicy but it was a light way to start the meal. 
Spinach composition of ahi tuna and alaskan crab - yummy! But I'm a big fan of seafood and tartar so this was going to be delicious to me by default. 
Seared foie gras - I love foie gras and while this one tasted good, I've had better. But still good nonetheless
Housed cured salmon - Another light way to start the meal, delicious. 
Hand cut fettuccine de mare - Good but a bit on the heavy side for an appetizer. Who starts with pasta as an appetizer? This is probably what made me full--not to mention they gave us huge portions of this. 
Beef wellington - A LOT of meat to eat. Either I was too full by this point or I just wasn't feeling it. 
Pancetta wrapped monkfish - This was good too but another heavy entree. This probably could have filled me up all on its own. The fish was cooked nice though. 
Chocolate raspberry bar - A slightly heavier way to finish off the meal (by this point, I was ready to throw up because I was so full)

They also gave complimentary chocolate bars courtesy of.....some dessert chef. Truffle chocolates were delicious. 

Service: A little slow but it was Valentine's and it was crowded. Our reservation wasn't until 9PM so I was surprised at how long our meal took (we ended up leaving right before midnight) but everyone working was hustling that night so I'm just going to assume there were way too many people that night.",4eR6hYFJcBHoAqhuOS07ww,2,2,3,v9bJp8ysZVY5tNRTCu8R2w

* Sirloin sliders are three to an order. Each one had a thick, juicy beef patty on a sesame seed bun along with crispy bacon and a guacamole chipotle sauce to add a kick. These are some of the best sliders this side of the slider truck.

* I'm a sucker for anything with lobster, so I had to try their lobster corn dogs. Big mistake. These dogs were a big letdown. They're basically three small, round fritters filled with a mixture that hardly tasted of lobster. I couldn't really pinpoint what was in the mixture, just a mushy bland mess.

The boyfriend had the hamachi crudo, the filet mignon, and the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The ""pudding"" is a light cake and was very flavorful.

My husband had previously come here and wanted to take me for serious meal and some wine angel action.  So much for that - looking for a romantic night, we were seated next to a European couple who were clearly drunk and fighting with each other their whole meal.  And the restaurant was about 25% full yet we were seated next to the drama squad.  Eek.

We both had the 9 course menu with wine pairings and every single dish needed editing.  A sublime seared diver scallop with beurre blanc was lost under a mess of pea shoots that negated the gentle flavor of the seafood.  Kobe beef came with about 3 too many garnishes that proved distracting from the main event.  After about four courses that I'd call no less than a hot mess on a plate, I was tired.  And I mean exhausted.  I kind of just wanted to leave, take a nap, and then figure out something to eat for dinner.

Maybe I was asking for too much in expecting to be wowed, but when a chef takes the time and energy to plan out nine courses with intricate wine pairings, you should feel excited and envigorated with the presentation of each course.  Instead, it was more like the staff came out almost mechanically, trying to get us through each course and then get us on our way.

Menus - fairly good range of choices.  I suppose there's something for everyone here.  

Wine list - Reeedikulous!  More choices then one should be allowed to make.  Personally, I would prefer a real menu over the tablet, the software they run is slow and difficult to use.  Markup averages 3x retail.  The wine tower and fairy thing is interesting but is too industrial for my taste.

Amuse - amusing?  Somehow they forgot to even serve that.  A good sign things were going downhill from here. 

Entrees - overall they were better described on the menu then executed.  I've eaten at French Laundry, Gary Denko, etc, and I wasn't expecting that here, but honestly the food wasn't - even - close.  It was extremely underwhelming.  Have a look at my photos if you don't believe me, do most of those items look appetizing?

I also suspect the kitchen was running slow, as the food wasn't as hot (temperature) as it should be.  

Service - We had a large party, but if you can't serve us right then don't take the reservation.  For example:  

Simple cocktails shouldn't take 10-15 minutes to make.   
If we're celebrating three birthdays, make sure you bring three desserts. 
Don't bring food to the table without knowing where it's supposed to go.  Asking ""who is having steak tonight?"" is acceptable at Chili's.  Not here. 


Wine service, on the other hand, met expectations.  

OVERALL - I expect better food AND service from a restaurant like this.",IyU01Jx7GF3BcJ8w-_T2EQ,3,1,2,VLdh9NZKBAAKsdqsw9sBhw

We were wrong. When we checked in upon arriving, the hostess told us that it will be about a 5-10 minute wait. Convention people were in the hotel and so it was a reasonable request. Well the time passed and so I was going to inquire as to the hold up. When I was about to, they gave us an indication that our table may be ready and we were finally going to be seated. Unfortunately they told us to wait longer as there was no table because of the convention. Well, one would assume that restaurants in Vegas would be aware of conventions and anticipate the amount and rush of people each night and manage accordingly, especially one as highly regarded as this restaurant. Again, we were wrong to believe it. 

We saw people being seated before us and they arrived after we checked in for our reservation. I was livid and told their hosts in certain terms that they ruined our special night and we were just going to leave. Another staff member intervened (didn't know if she was the manager because she never said her name nor told us who she was) proceeded to explain that they don't have a table available because of the circumstances. Their excuse made it worse because why set the reservation if they couldn't accommodate and we specifically said in setting this dinner reservation that it was for our anniversary. We could have chosen other fine dining establishments but we chose this restaurant based on the accolades and high ratings. Again we were proven wrong. Finally when we made a decision to just leave, they somehow found another table. BTW the table we requested should have been in the Swan room but we didn't get it. We should have left because further lame attempts and excuses should have warned us.

Well the appetizers we ordered, the glasses of wines, and my main dish were good, however my wife's main entree was not. After being seated and after the 40 minute fiasco, one would think that we will now be given a good experience - once again, we were proven wrong.

 Dinner started out ok, our group of 9 was excited to try a lot of different things. Orlando was our server as well as another gentleman that didn't introduce himself. At the beginning of our meal and when we were ordering cocktails we told the unnamed gentleman that we were going to need separate checks. He said ""that's fine we will figure it all out later"" ok cool, no issue. We spent the rest of our meal laughing & enjoying the food, some of it was meh some of it was AMAZING.. I ordered the grilled calamari, not my favorite, kinda bland, the hummus trio was ok, the cod was delicious, the beef cheek ravioli was boring. The carpaccio was outstanding.. eventually we ordered dessert, two of our friends left for about 15 mins and when they came back we waited another 15 mins for our desserts, they were good but not out of this world.. 

check time.. Orlando had us all on one check.. and separating it was a complete shock to him and instead of being professional about it, he made us feel like a major inconvenience. We explained how we wanted it and how we had previously asked for separate checks but that went unnoticed. We waited over 20 minutes for him to figure out everything and separate everything. My one friend was given the incorrect bill multiple times and his card charged multiple times and thats just ridiculous. There were multiple people helping process payments, but Orlandos partner from the beginning of the meal was no where to be found. It was beyond frustrating!

We were really looking forward to this dinner and have had this reservation made for over 3 months and it was so disappointing that the experience was ruined by lack of communication between staff..",9QvO3REQDaiacQLLnWxUiA,3,0,1,ngM7Viir8ow8IVvwI2hRDg

We started with bread which was not warm and seemed a little stale. For the price point and quality that this place is supposed to be at, I expect fresh baked bread. 

Next were appetizers which was a 50/50 hit and miss. French onion soup was good, it had little pieces of foie in the broth, they do like a puff pastry crust and the cheese is on top of the pastry so it's more like a cheese shell, you don't get the melty gooey cheese in the soup. Seared foie gras was very good, it was two nicely portioned pieces of foie. Octopus salad was not good. It has no flavor at all, not on the octopus or the accompaniments that came with the dish. Not even enough olive oil to hide the dryness of the octopus. My friend ended up sending hers back, I really wanted to send mine back too but since I was sharing with another person we did eat a good amount of it already so decided to just pay for that poor appetizer choice.

My entree ws pretty good. I got the branzino. It's skin was crisped nicely and the fish perfectly cooked and seasoned. I felt bad for the rest of the table because I don't think anyone else liked their entree. This was definitely a downer. Also our waiter didn't seem to care too much when we said the octopus was not to our liking. He did take it back, but reluctantly.

It seems like everything here is a feast for the eyes. From taking in the view of their waterfall-fountain scene, to their breath-taking and somewhat scary wine tower. Staff actually have to be on ""rock-climbing"" line and hook to retrieve your beloved bottle of wine.

I can say that only MOST of the staff were top notch. Our waiter was very helpful in all dinner decisions and was very attentive to all our needs. The host/cashier was very snobby and stuck-up, that's the last kind of service you want when you're spending $95 per person for dinner. They lost a star for that :( Sorry!

We had the 4 course Tasting Menu seated in the Swan Court. It was a spetacular view and very romantic lighting. ($95/per person)

Onto the food, we loved the presentations of all courses! Everything was served in the appropriate temperature and tasted superb! We even loved the choice of breads, my favorite was the caramelized onion bread! YUMMY!!! The waiter was even nice enough to pack some ""to-go"" for me. 

For the starter plate, I had Lobster Egg Roll, Ahi Tuna, and some sort of Sweet Potato Puree. They were pleasing, but we definitely wanted more bites of it!

Second Course we had Scallops with Crusted Mushrooms and Lamb Lollipops with Pearl Potatoes. The Scallops were very sweet, in a good way and the Lamb had a little too much fat  and au jus.

Third Course I had the Steak Three-Ways, Kobe Beef, New York Strip Steak (medium-rare), and Filet Mignon. My favorite was the New York steak which was served in a fantastic red wine reduction and complimented it very well. The scallion potatoes that they were on the bottom sucked up all the juices from the meats and was also very tasty!

Last but not least, the Fourth Course we had the dessert sample with Creme Brulee, Cheese Stuffed Fig, Almond and Grape Biscotti, Toasted Walnut Cake with Hazelnut Caramel, and of course, the house-made chocolates!!!!! They were all very sweet and we were glad it was in small portion/bites because of the large sugar intake :)

The first dish was a smoked salmon dish which I thought was ok, but a bit tangy/spicy.

The next dish was buttered asparagus.  Although it was simply prepared, the asparagus was delish.  There were about 20 sticks of asparagus.  Yum...

The next dish was a ravioli dish with peas and crab I think.  It was a nice dish with lots of butter also.

The best dish was the black cod.  It was so tender.  I just wish that the piece was a bit bigger.  It was only about 3 inches long and an inch high.  

We were offered four different types of bread.  Sourdough, pretzel, focaccio and wheat?

My group decided to do the regular menu which was a prix fix where you pick an app,  an entree and dessert.  We considered the parallel tasting menu, but there was a beef wellington that wasn't on the tasting menu.  

The popular apps at our table were the wild mushroom risotto, lobster cappuccino (bisque) and the seared tuna niciose.   All got rave reviews.

For Dinner, most of us had the beef wellington which had a layer of fois gras between the pastry and steak.  It was decadent and delicious.

The server brought us a sampling of sides for the table, which was awesome, but we ended up barely touching the side dishes because the dinner was so great.

We ended with dessert and the pear dessert was the standout.  We also got a sampling of sorbet, which was amazing, and I am not one to waste time on sorbet.

For example, some of the courses were excellent. The duck confit cavatelli was to die for, the foie gras and churros were perfectly cooked, and the king salmon and caviar (technically first course, but more like a big amuse) was a joy to eat. But many of the dishes were ridiculously salty. The lamb course was essentially ruined by this - I couldn't eat more than two bites, that's how salty it was. Even the duck confit cavatelli, which I loved, was tough to finish because it was so salty.

Service-wise, all staff we encountered - waiter, bussers, food runners, bartenders - were very friendly and welcoming. On the other hand, the meal was not paced well, there was a general lack of attention to detail, and we were repeatedly left waiting for utensils and wine to match up with our courses.

Ultimately, in a vacuum, I don't think most people would be outright disappointed by the overall experience here. But given the plethora of other options on the Strip in the $110 price range (or less, for that matter), I doubt I'd find myself at Aureole.

After we went to the main dining room where we ordered the pork chops, some sort of seasoned fries (not sure what kind because they never came), and a caesar salad. The caesar salad was very marginal because they tried to make this salad ""fancy"" but it was really just a pain because they just put three lettuce leaves on a plate with a little dressing and some cheese...

3972422,2017-11-18,8,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I recently had the chance to go back to Aureole since Chef John Church became the executive chef and I found out that he's doing a fantastic job!  The menu changes with the seasons and Chef Church is doing some fine and very creative dishes.  

I started with an amuse-bouche of an oyster with caviar and sorbet.  Good opener.  The salt of the caviar with the sorbet made for great flavor combinations.  The bread was focaccia and it was accompanied by butter with olive oil and thyme.

Next up was a beet salad with two beet ""marshmallows"" that the chef made by mixing beet juice with egg whites to make beet marshmallows.  Interesting and tasty concept.  Next came some onion soup with pastry ""pouches"" on top instead of the bread and cheese on most onion soup.  It was also topped with shaved black truffles.  This was followed by duck prosciutto wrapped foie gras torchon, huckleberry tomatoes, and sangria soda.  Simply wonderful!

The entrées started with vegetable lasagna--spinach pasta, butternut squash, mascarpone, and sage.  This was followed by Ora king salmon, sliced fingerling potatoes, smoked salmon, and white wine cream.  The salmon was so flaky and the fingerling potato slices were crisp which made for a fine balance of textures.  Then came what I considered the highlight of the meal--rack of Colorado lamb with pistachio and horseradish crust and lingonberry jus.  I think if I were on Death Row and had a last meal request, it would be this.  Excellent flavors and textures.  A complete winner.  

Then, Chef Church brought out three desserts accompanied by the pastry chef who explained each of the dishes.  One was a rose apple tartlette which was carved in the shape of a rose with cardamom and rosewater ice cream and almond leaves.  The second dessert was a maple brown butter crème brûlée, and finally there was coconut bananas Foster with Malibu caramel, coconut sorbet, and spiced rum financier.

I can't remember a time when I left a restaurant so full but I walked up the stairs with a big smile and thoughts of what great food I had enjoyed that evening!

This was an outstanding tasting of the various things on the fall/winter menu.  There was not one thing that wasn't completely enjoyable.  Service was outstanding as always.  Aureole is one of those restaurants to which you need to return.  I am enamored by the wine tower and the wine angel.

4059450,2012-04-01,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I'd like to start off by saying that we have been wanting to try Aureole for years... Their wine lounge is this wino's idea of AWESOME! Unfortunately, with so many great restaurants in Vegas, and typically staying in hotels more north on the strip (Palazzo, Wynn, Bellagio, etc...), we hadn't had the opportunity to. But, on this trip... we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay and so, Aureole was absolutely in our game plan. 

Originally, we'd planned to dine in the Swan Court section of Aureole on the last night in town (we already had plans with friends, every other night of our 7 day trip), but I couldn't wait. After perusing Yelp for awhile, I discovered they had a wine lounge... a bar area... right underneath, basically, the famed wine tower. We could go on night one for a drink and maybe an app or two, prior to meeting up for dinner with our friends. SCORE! 

We come down the beautiful staircase, my eyes fixed on the wine tower, and there it was. A table for us, right in the lounge! We were psyched  to get to experience it and so excited about it. 

Our server, Renaldo, asked what we wanted to drink and we asked for a wine list, naturally. He brought us a tablet with a digital wine list (certainly not cutting edge, but pretty cool). We wanted some time to enjoy looking through the massive amount of offerings. Since we're just having pre-dinner bites, we opted to try their wine flights. So far, so good.... 

And then it all went downhill.... 

Renaldo came back with our flights (we selected different ones) and headed off to check on another table. I started with a California Cabernet (my fave) and upon smelling it, knew it wasn't ""right"". It had clearly turned. When Renaldo returned, I informed him of this and he got defensive and said that it most certainly had not. It was a new bottle, he'd opened it himself. I said, well.... then it's a bad bottle. This is a spoiled wine, I'm pretty into wine, so I know when it's rotten. He went over to the bartender (and we watched the entire transaction with him), he asked the bartender for the bottle of Cab, the bartender shows it to him and it's got, maybe enough for a 3oz pour. Hardly a ""just opened"" bottle. He'd lied to me. He didn't open it. It had been sitting, for who knows how long, and turned. Clearly. 

Renaldo came back to the table with a fresh bottle, clearly annoyed with me, and poured my glass. And THAT is a how a Cab should taste. But why the drama? I wasn't rude, in the least... I just simply had a bad glass of wine and asked for a new one. A perfectly reasonable request, by anyone's standards... and most certainly in a fine dining establishment that has such a big ""wine"" presence. 

Next, my hubs and I decided on two apps to share... the seared foie gras (our fave) and a lobster ""special"". After ordering the lobster special, my husband inquired about the other lobster dish on their main menu. Renaldo said it was very good but we probably wouldn't want it because it ""cost more""... really? We just ordered a $29 appetizer... the 3rd most expensive on your menu (trumped only by a seafood platter and caviar), clearly we weren't price sensitive. 

I am sure people come in and order a fabulous bottle of wine and enjoy the tasting menu and probably spend more than we were planning to that night... but we had plans to come back to do JUST THAT! We just couldn't wait and wanted a sample. Never judge a book by it's cover buddy... isn't that fine dining 101? 

After much debate... because I almost NEVER ask to speak with a manager at a restaurant... I did, I asked for one. I explained my experience and I explained that I wasn't talking to her because I wanted something comped. My husband and I have more than enough money to pay for our meal. She offered anyway, and I declined. I even still left 18% gratuity, because the food was fabulous and once the wine situation was settled, that was great too. I didn't want the people that share in those tips to be short changed. I do want to note- I typically leave 25-30% tips. So 18% is a big deal... to me that indicates terrible service. I give 20, for just meeting basic expecations. 

I spoke with, Rebecca, who kept saying that my complaint seemed strange because Renaldo is ""one of the best captains""... and that may very well be true, but I didn't really find it very professional. It was as though she too was questioning my experience. She offered me her card. 

The following day, I sent an email to Steve Mainini, the GM. He promptly responded to my email and offered to help ensure we have the kind of experience we'd hoped for. He said ""Please know your observation is well founded and I am 
certain we can make your next visit an exceptionally positive one""... I let Steve know that we wouldn't be able to on this trip, but will touch base on our next. 

I'm going to give Aureole another chance, via Steve. I want, so badly, to leave loving this Charlie Palmer creation.

We arrived and we ordered the Valentine's Day special, which was clearly made prior to Vday as it all tasted old, and very below average, especially for $105 a plate. The first course had cashew purée which tasted rotten and sour, as did the vegetables included in it. The second course was risotto and it tasted like cardboard and was over cooked, and hardly even warm, I would feed that to my dog, much less my boyfriend. The third course was a Wellington that was under cooked, the pastry around it was still very raw and doughy and the meat tasted like the smell of dog food- I had one bite and pushed my plate away, as did my boyfriend. When asked by our waiter if everything was ok, my response was ""No, to say this meal was disappointing would be an under statement"". Our waiters response was an odd look, as if he didn't understand, walked away, and returned with our dessert. Our dessert was rock hard frozen, and we couldn't eat it, until we sat there for 20 minutes waiting for it to thaw out- and still wasn't very tasty. After waiting for 30 minutes to get our waiters attention, he finally returned with our $300 bill. WORST experience, a very embarrassing Valentine's Day surprise, and a complete waste of money.

4118852,2011-10-11,2,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Okay, I don't know what has been going on with other diners, but our experience at Aureole was awesome.

I can't belive Aureole lost its Michelin star last year.  A few of the dishes we ordered, on the a la carte menu, two (the ricotta ravioli appetizer and the veal shank) were two of the best dishes we've ever encountered.  And we've eaten at the French Laundry, Joel Robuchon, etc.  They served a steak knife with my veal, but I didn't need it.  The brazed meat fell apart with the touch of my fork, and the warm spices, beans, and strong salty prosciutto tortellini melded in a symphony of fall flavor.  My wife's salmon ricotta ravioli is one of the best to or three things we've ever eaten.  The creamy texture of the cheese supported the decadent salmon and vegetables perfectly.  It's simply indiscribable and a must-order.  The waiter recognized as much (he asked my wife if she'd ever been there before, as she had ordered two of the best things on the menu.)

The service was almost top-notch (the interaction with the sommelier and the waiter was a bit awkward, and the table next to us didn't get their coffee with their dessert). The electronic wine tablet is a great idea, though I couldn't get it to work (and I'm a technie).  I couldn't scroll through the varietal menu without first selecting one of the grapes at the top of the alphabetical list (so to scroll to granache, you'd have to click on cabernet, and all that would come up is cabernets...).  Since we were interested in ""c"" wines, that was fine with me.  Others have commented on servers forgetting a table, bringing things out incorrectly, or simply being rude.  Other than what I listed above, and a slightly too fast pace for dinner, none of that here--everyone was professional, friendly and attentive.  And we were there on a Sunday night at 6:30.

 The sommelier's recommendation for a cab franc was good, and the wine was tasty, but not out of this world.  But, I guess that's what you get for a $68 bottle of French wine at a place like this.

A few recent reviews commented on the small portions.  We found that to be just the opposite.  For a fine dining restaurant, the portions were HUGE! My wife and I could not finish our entrees and could barely get to the huge selection of sorbets.  It's not the Sizzler or an all you can eat buffet, but the portions certainly didn't leave you wanting more -- they left you wanting to clean your plate.

And, of course, the giant wine tower, with its gathering angels, was a sight to behold.

Maybe it's not the most inventive cuisine now, but Aureole does not disappoint.  4.5/5, rounded up to 5 because of the ravioli and veal.",OR0z3Tn7LLuO0NkHSy-atQ,3,2,5,sniQqJumUyE2XD4qR9envQ

We ordered the three course meal and I had the beet salad which was around 5 quarters of a beet on a mayo based sauce and I quickly moved all of the beets to the side because I don't like mayo based sauces.  And my boyfriend started out with the beef cheek ravioli which was good.  We both had the filet mignon and it was surprisingly a little tough.  It was on on top of a little bit of greens and what I think was a little bit of mashed potato.  And both were good but it was super rich so I knew I'd be paying for it later.  And I was going to order the ""cheesecake three ways"" which included brie, cheddar and blue cheese.  And, I can hang with brie and cheddar but I hate blue cheese.  So I ordered the creme brulee with a little bit of raspberry sorbet on top.  And the creme brulee was ok (I've had better) and I liked the rasberry sorbet but they also sprinkled some pomegranate seeds and caviar on top and I had to scrape both off because the only crunchy thing I want on my creme brulee is the carmelized sugar on top and I don't do caviar.

Great wine list, but on a computer so more useful to somebody that does not know a wine list and what they are looking for.  Kinda clunky to work through.  And they are really proud of the bottles on that list.  Maybe they could bring the prices back into a reasonable range if you didn't have to pay the cost of maintaining the tower and the lovely scantily-clad ladies to fly up and down fetching bottles.   . . . not that I complaining about that part . . . just that they are proud of the selection.

Our meals were all pretty good, but not the best meals on the planet to warrant the price.  Our server was slow.  Of the four of us at our table, one ordered San Pellegrino.  The rest of us had still water.  And the servers mixed them up.  Not the end of the world in the scheme of things, but on a $400 dinner . . . to charge for the second bottle after they mis-poured the first one.  Really?  Don't get me wrong, that $10 bottle of water did not, by itself, warrant the three-star rating -- it is just a factor in the overall price to food and service value ratio.

We arrived and were immediately led down the large staircase, past the massive wine tower to the back of the restaurant in a corner. Perfect for a quiet conversation. However, the restaurant was very empty with maybe only 3 other tables with people.

We started with a bottle of Pinot Noir. I had no idea about the ""wine angels"" and missed the presentation of them putting on a harness to get the bottle of wine out of the wine tower. You can't see it from the back corner of the restaurant and staff did not mention it. 

A member of our group ordered several items for the table to share and I was able to try bites of a few items.

4276291,2011-02-22,1,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Aureole was kind of a nice experience.  

The gentlemen who filled our water glasses and brought the bread tray was very nice.  The manager who checked on us towards the end of meal was also very friendly.  The sommelier was GREAT and helped us pick a bottle we both really enjoyed from their electronic wine list (which was fun).  We couldn't see if they sent the wine angel up to get it because we weren't seated near the wine tower.

Which brings me to where we were sitting.  We were seated in the ""Swan Terrace,"" although we did not request this and I wasn't too familiar with the fact that there were different ""areas"" at all.  Now it's kind of cool that there are swans, but the room comes with restrictions on what you can order.  Most importantly they don't even offer you the a la carte menu--you have to order a three course meal. We were both thinking about a tasting menu anyway, so this wasn't a huge deal.  But my guy had seen their advertisement outside the restaurant for the three course ""Harvest Menu,"" which is made with fresh seasonal produce, and he wanted that.  When our server came over, we asked why it wasn't on the menu, and he said it was only served in the ""other"" dining room.  When we looked surprised, he said he'd get it for us, but made it clear he was doing us a favor.  I found this altogether bizarre--if you're going to place restrictions like that, why not warn patrons first?  Why not offer them a table in the ""other"" dining room as well?  The restaurant was not full, so it seemed like they were trying to force us to order from only the two most expensive tasting menus.  Also, afterward, I looked at their web site, and apparently we paid MORE for the exact SAME food just by virtue of our presence in the swan room.  And at no point did we REQUEST swans or even have the swan option explained to us. 

Now, having read some reviews, I see that there are supposed to be little swan-based extras, but we didn't see any of that.  I saw other tables getting an amuse bouche, which we were not served.  Also, our actual server kind of put a damper on the whole evening because he was just pretentious.  We're really friendly diners, but he could hardly spare a smile and paid us as little attention as possible. Shouldn't you put your friendliest (or at least, your least snobby) waiter in the special swan room? 

Now, the food itself was beautiful and delicious.  Charlie Palmer knows how to put together a menu.  And the quality of the food explains the Michelin Star.  I had some delicious butternut squash ravioli with brown butter and snow crab.  We both had steak dishes.  And the desserts were pretty and yummy.  And we enjoyed the blueberry margarita from the bar as well as the wine.  I did think it was a little weird that they circulated the bread on a tray but didn't bother to heat any of it up.  But because they put bacon INSIDE their focaccia, I won't quibble.  

A few days later, after considering our whole Aureole experience, I don't think we'll be repeat visitors.  It's a very expensive restaurant to begin with, so you want to have a good memory there.  And I just can't help feeling taken advantage of with the whole swan business.  And when your waiter is snotty to you, it doesn't matter how nice everyone else is or how delicious the food is. It really just kills the evening.",F8NMMfNo3sY7meIDytLGdg,1,0,2,bDsqlrDtnYOHwS3T6lqFWQ

It's the perfect place for a romantic evening (or alternatively, a business meeting). Both of these require intimate settings and this place has it. You can request one of the booths near the back windows and it's like you're in the restaurant all by yourself! 

The food is incredible and well worth the price. I'd highly recommend the meat - we had the lamb and the fillet mignon and both were incredible. We ordered a few sides: broccoli and rice and both were delicious and well sized to share. We shared the dessert sampler plate which was one of the best desserts I've ever had. We had a mix of chocolate and fruit and hot and cold dishes - all very yummy!

The wine list is the BEST PART. You get an ipad and you can read about your wine selections on the application the restaurant uses.

We did the tasting menu in the ""swan court"", which means that you pay ten dollars more to be in a room with some swans outside.  Given that it was dark outside, this felt like a particularly stupid feature.

I asked if it was possible to split a wine pairing, and was quickly rebuked.  I've asked for that and had no problems in many other places.  Oh well.

The dinner started with a trio of amuses.  One of them was a bacon-wrapped scallop that was okay.  I don't remember the others.  The bacon they served with the beef was the most amazing I've ever had.  Incredibly crisp, but not overcooked.  The server was happy to explain the vast effort they go to make it, curing it themselves, cooking it low and slow between sheets of some absorbing paper that gets rid of the grease.  The duo of beef had some flat-iron that was dry and completely over-done, which was odd.

Dessert was okay; they brought a trio of sorbets and asked us to guess what they were.  We got two of them, but unsurprisingly pomegranate-cherry was a hard one.

We left feeling overly full but with none of the wonder we had when leaving L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, which was more expensive, but SO much better.  I won't come back here, and would suggest other places over this.  My brother came here a while ago and absolutely loved it, as he said service was great, which I definitely didn't get.",uT_J1dCJ3KQ6L_iZy0_UjA,0,0,2,O9chqfzjG7cEfubCr7_UYQ

I started off with the tuna tartare and I thought it was ok because it had this cream that reminded me of honeydew sorbet.

We came in using a gift certificate from Restaurant.com, so maybe that's why we got shabby treatment.  Obviously the restaurant is in need of new customers, which is they they had the certificate offered on Restaurant.com to begin with.  My friend ordered a glass of wine (Chardonnay - $12) and I drank tap.  After we ordered our entrees, the waiter asked, ""And for your first course?""  A more diplomatic way he could have asked if we were ordering appetizers could have been, ""Will you be ordering anything else?""  I found it to be pretty rude and pushy to assume we would be ordering appetizers.  Sorry, but since when is it expected that you order a certain amount when dining out?  I would have tipped him much less than I did, except that we were waited on by various ppl, so I assumed they shared the tip and I did not want to stiff some of the others who were quite nice (the bread man, the man who refilled our glasses).  We were also largely ignored after our entrees came.  No one asked how our dinner was and we had to wait at least 10 minutes after our dishes were cleared to get dessert menus hastily thrown at us.  As a result, we did not order any dessert due to the treatment we got.   I noticed the table next to us did not get serviced very well either, even though the guy ordered a $200 bottle of wine.

On our most recent trip to Vegas we wanted to eat at as many great places as possible. I love to plan out all my culinary stops and make reservations weeks before.  On this particular night we were seeing the AFI show (my favorite punk rock turned slightly sell out band) so we had some issues with time. Besides Aureole having the earliest opening time, they were conveniently located near the House of Blues (AFI) at Mandalay.  So, in hopes of another fabulous meal...

This time hubby and I ordered a la carte (time constraints). We shared a couple of tapas style small bites and then ordered entrees. We skipped dessert. Everything was very good but nothing was as stand out as the tasting menu enjoyed prior to this visit. Everything was still far better than our dinner the prior evening at Michael Mina (hubby will disagree with me there). 

Aureole's wine list is excellent. It could take you half the evening to make a selection if you didn't know what you were looking for or didn't ask for help. The service is really good. The restaurant itself is beautiful. With the wine cellar as the focal point, the main dining area is wide open with high ceilings. The decor is contemporary but the lighting is dim and very romantic.  I wish they had more bathrooms (they have a one-person ladies room) without having to leave the restaurant itself. 

My only real complaint echoes a fellow yelper's review. I think having a photographer make the rounds and take pictures of guests is kind of uncool, unclassy and commercial feeling. I felt interrupted and obliged to have my picture taken. The results I would liken to a slightly fuzzy prom picture.

It's good - particularly the food, but it's impossible for me to overlook several missteps. For starters, our hostess was actually having a conversation on a Bluetooth as she seated us. Although we had reservations and it was so early that we were one of the first tables seated, we were not given a seating option with our table (maybe it would have been impossible without interrupting our hostess). We ended up in the Swan Court, which is nice, but it kills any chance to see the restaurant's famous ""wine angels"" in action. The waiter appeared shortly thereafter to take cocktail orders. I asked for a Hendrick's martini. He comes back in 15 seconds to say they have no Hendrick's... and suggests Absolut or Grey Goose as an alternative. Um, Forbes Four Diamond and the server doesn't know a proper martini is made with gin? Call me a snob, but that's bad. Once we sort out what a martini involves, lo and behold we find that they do have Hendrick's. The drink came out perfectly, but then the wine list showed up. Aureole cleverly puts their very impressive list on an iPad. The good part of that is the lack of pressure and ease of exploration. The bad part for us was the utter lack of attention from our server - he didn't ask what we liked to drink or planned to eat; in fact, he said nothing. Just the thunk of the iPad on the table. I suppose I expected a bit more, but we agreed upon a bottle and it was fine. Between the waiter and the hostess, I was starting to worry about the food, but the bread service started to allay those concerns. It was excellent, fresh and creative, which typified the rest of our meal. The service evened out and became passable, and w enjoyed a very reasonable prix fixe menu that was very well executed and satisfying. It was far from a perfect evening, however.

4571229,2010-08-31,1,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I went here for the Restaurant Week dinner menu with Blair B.

The waiter did have the restaurant week menu neatly designed in its own casing, but insisted on reviewing the regular menu first.  He seemed annoyed when Blair asked for the other menu, and said he had to tell us about the real one first.  We actually had 2 waiters, and the other one (tall and handsome) was the guy who checked on us, our drinks and our food most of the time.

I ordered the frisee salad with poached egg, foie gras and figs for my first course.  Blair got the braised octopus and Maine lobster salad.  We definitely nibbled at each others.  I was very pleased with this course since it has everything great in it (and frisee is my favorite lettuce!)

Next, I got the crispy duck leg confit with greens, super thin potatoes and ice wine reduction.  Blair ordered the braised short rib and seared togarashi tuna loin with broccoli puree.  We agreed the tuna was blah, but the duck and beef shined.  I also liked the veggies on my plate.

We ended up both getting the peach brown butter tart for dessert and the peaches were good but the tart a bit dry.  They bring itty bitty petit fours at the end and I tried all of them!  We also tried to get the wine pairing mentioned on threesquare.org.  The waiter taking our orders said the wine pairing was mistakenly put on there but charities do not allow alcohol to be advertised or some BS.  Blair pulled up the web site on her iPhone but he said pairing the wines listed would cost us up to $80 each instead of $10 or $20 extra!

We ended up getting wine flights for $14-16 each, a better deal and plenty for me.  I had the aromatic white (the RIesling was amazingly fruity but dry) and Blair enjoyed the ripe soft red and especially the Grenache.  I also indulged in enough pretzel rolls for both of us since she is low-carbing it.  After all of this indulgence we went to Wet Your Appetite at Wet Republic!

4604356,2015-05-01,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"I'll start with the background.

I'm in technology sales and attend 2-3 week-long conferences in Las Vegas each year.  I also sell to and meet with tech companies in Las Vegas.  So, I've had over 50 business trips to Vegas in my career and on each visit try a mixture of new places, old standbys and places recommended by friends that live in Vegas.  I'm a foodie and cook that lives in Marin County, so know a little about food, wine and cooking.  And on my business travels I've been fortunate to dine at some of the best establishments in San Francisco, Silicon Valley, New York, L.A., Chicago, Dallas - all around the country and internationally.

Over the past five years our sales team has dined at every restaurant in the Mandalay Bay where Interop is held and have enjoyed each.  We finally decided to splurge and try Aureole.  Overall I'll say that, for the price and the hype, Aureole was mediocre.  Everyone on our team agreed.

From reading other reviews it seems the pre fixe and tasting menus are the safe bets.  We all chose to order a la carte. 

Two of us had the New York steak and the cut was overcooked and fatty.  Our VP's octopus was overcooked and chewy.  One person had scallops that were under-seasoned and flavorless.  The creme-brulee was bland.  It's OK to pay these prices for excellent food.  It's disappointing to pay these prices for lackluster preparation.

The wine list is quite expensive even by Las Vegas standards.  The minimum buy-in for bottles of mid-level Cabernet was $110, with only one or two choices at this price-point.    For comparison, the next night we had a far superior bottles of Cab at Fix in the Bellagio for $80.  

If you're willing to pay a huge premium to show that you can then this is your restaurant.   If you're ordering the tasting or pre fixe menus, perhaps you'll have a better experience than the a la carte choices.

I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and perhaps they had an ""off"" night.  However, when a major tech trade show is held on your property I would assume an establishment such as this would be on their A Game.

You need a gimmik to make it noteworthy and to stand apart from the competition. Chef Charlie Palme's Aureole has chosen wine as their over the top signature statement.

I could talk about the food, but I would have to say it's about par with the rest of the Vegas scene. Good juicy steaks, etc. I was dining on a prix fixe menu, as I was with a large group. My options were typical (an ahi appetizer, a filet, and a nice dessert). So my knowledge of the menu is limited, but I was very happy with what they offered, and my meal.

Now, let's jump to the fun part - their take on wine.

Aureole decided not to bury their 10,000 + bottles of wine selections in a basement or cellar. Instead, they opted to encase it in an acrylic tower that spans four stories (42 feet) through the center of the restaurant. When you enter the restaurant, you pass by this absolutely amazing tower of wine, displayed for all to see - from all four sides. 

Yes, it's cool to look at. But even MORE COOL? How they retrieve the wine. A beautiful woman, dressed in a sleek black leotard is hoisted up like a trapeze artist for every bottle. She is referred to as the ""Wine Angel"" and she's absolutely delightful to watch. Every time a bottle of wine is ordered, it's retrieved by the Wine Angel. She's a mesmerizing acrobat as she flies up within the encased tower, plucking your order out of her acrylic Heavens.

You can also ask for the ""wine tablet"" which is an electronic wine menu. It sounds cooler than it is - as it had a bad user interface. I'd prefer to tip the wine angel $20.00 & tell her to reach for something tasty!

Overall - review? Do go to Aureole once - or at least walk in to see it. The wine angel is something we've all dreamed about!!",sZdy2AQD0gn7RMAJcu48yg,7,6,4,rhrTYLTjE2P8YpemPNIXxA

They would not stop asking us if we needed help deciding. Kind of irritating.  We just wanted to read all of it and decide what to eat first. 
I decided on a steak. BIG mistake. It was indelible. I never send food back and this had to go. Especially for the price.  It was the worst steak I've ever had. The Cesear salad and tuna poke was good though. My husband had the chicken pot pie and it was fine.

4677479,2013-03-01,4,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Cant help but give this place 5 stars on a meal I didnt pay for...

I ordered the french onion soup, filet mignon with bleu cheese, and an apple turnover for dessert.

The FOS was unlike any I have ever had - it started out like a soufflé, except with a crunchy/cheesy dome around the top. A couple of pushes with the spoon into the delicious foie gras and truffle infused soup and the dish actually seems more like my everyday French Onion Soup, except there were lots of little crunchy pieces of the caved in dome. I finished the last bits of soup off with two of the 5 breads that are offered by the breadboy (I went pretzel bread and cheddar/walnut). Delicious, my coworkers got the romaine lettuce which looked totally underwhelming, but I guess thats what being healthy is all about.

The Filet was cooked perfectly medium rare, witha  nice and pink center and a good char to the outside. The bleu cheese was very creamy, with just the right amount of delicious chunks to give every bite a kick. I dont know if it was the knife that was so sharp, or the meat was so tender, but it was easier to cut through the steak than it was to cut the butter knife through butter at the table. Each bite was so juicy and delicious...I'm pretty sure this was the better steak of my excursion (beating out the KC Strip I had in Kansas City).

The desert was an apple turnover with maple iced cream, apple slaw and caramel spirals. SO GOOD! There were 3 small crispy rings of apple goodness which I topped with the apple slaw (basically stringline pieces of apple). The maple ice cream was a great compliment along with the caramel spirals (I crushed these down in order to get little flakes in each bite).

The bill for 6 people was about $550 including gratuity which doesnt seem unreasonable, considering the meal also included drinks.

It was also nice noting that this place isnt nearly as loud as many of the other Vegas restaurants I have been to. It's nice being able to converse with people across the table without repeating every sentence.

I'd probably give this place 4 stars if I had paid, but thats because I'm a cheap jew and usually prefer holes in the wall.",qbktBg_kKKbaWFk6r1f2Zw,4,1,5,w5CXFwS_MI2dCPiw-Mgiew
4686314,2015-02-22,1,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Aureole has flashes of brilliance, but, overall, it felt like maybe another theme restaurant that might be resting on its past laurels.

We were seated on time but then handed a electronic tablet to select our drinks from.  Totally out of character for a fine restaurant IMHO.  Felt much more Applebees than what you'd expect from a Charlie Palmer restaurant.

Drinks and appetizers were excellent, as well as service--at the beginning.  More later.  My date ordered a tasting menu, and I ordered the Niman Ranch pork chop.

My pork chop was disappointing.  It arrived sliced on a bed of chard and deep fried pig ears.  (I'm not grossed out by the pig ear concept, but their crunchiness annoyed me more than accent the flavor or texture of the chard.)  My chop was terribly dry near the bone and at the other end.  I simply can't figure out how they cooked it to have shoe leather quality meat at each end and appropriate juiciness in the center.  That said--even for the center--the meat had too much fat for a chop.  I prefer a solid, juicy, whole chop--not this presentation.

My date's main course had to be returned....with me eating in solitude....due to the kitchen ignoring allergy warnings.  The restaurant promptly addressed it, but this definitely takes the shine off a special occasion dinner.

Service:  A large party was seated nearby during our meal, and our waiter tended to them.  The problem this created was a LONG delay in my date's final course from the tasting menu.  So, the cadence was noticeably off.

I was finally offered a dessert menu whose pages were stained in several places from drink spills, etc.  This is off-putting and not projecting the image I'd suspect Mr. Palmer would want.  One of the stained pages was an advertisement to buy Charlie's books.  The irony wasn't lost on me.",CvFwqHdvFhF2UnmaJxYiEA,1,0,2,bvcsHUmmHsLl0T6bXkGxJg

However, once we got off, there was no hostess there. We waited for about 10 minutes with another party for someone to show up and greet us.

We got sat down at the swan court I requested for more a more private feel. We waited another 5 to 10 minutes for our server to come over and greet us. We weren't ready to order our drinks yet so we asked for a couple minutes, he didn't come back for another 15 minutes. The restaurant was probably at a 30% capacity. The busser, however, noticed that we were looking around and provided us with waters without us having to ask.

The cocktails we ordered weren't that great, at a fine dining restaurant in Las Vegas, you can get much better quality drinks for the same price point. The bread service is also very weak, with a cheap looking slice of french or ciabatta bread. Again, Las Vegas has many other restaurants where you pay over $100 that provide better bread service, and service overall.

We decided to go with the summer tasting menu, in order to get a little bit of everything. However, for $115, the portions are TOO little. How is the main entree going to be a mere 3 slices of duck breast, or one lamb lollipop? The scallop dish had ONE scallop. The two dishes we enjoyed was the foie gras and the panna cotta. It's way overpriced for what you get, and we left unsatisfied. I'd rather spend an extra $15 per person to dine at Michael Mina in the Bellagio again.

I feel that this restaurant is outdated, as with many of the restaurants at Mandalay Bay when you compare it to the newer places in the center strip. As an MLife gold member, I don't think I'll ever return to this restaurant. Seems like a waste of $330 for two people.",cLfSBSZcZFkxy9HPCvezRg,3,2,2,2YS_vWGpoFIBc49mQG35kA

With so many options near the Mandalay Bay Events Center, it was difficult to make an immediate decision. Also, since Lily is visting, I told her to choose and I am very happy she chose Aureole!

We walked up to the host stand and informed the hostess that we were in search of their bar, so we were directed in via elevator or stairs. We happily took the stairs to admire the vast wine collection. I had heard of Aureole's monstrous wine collection (for the record, it is a four-story stainless steel tower of over 50,000 wines including the ""Millennium Collection"" that features the first Bordeaux growth from the 1900 vintage - HOLY MOLY) and flying ""wine angels,"" but didn't take the time to appreciate it. It is quite the sight.

Once you get to the dining room, there is another host stand when you exit the stairs and we were graciously directed to the bar behind the stars (it's under and on the side of the stairs). Fortunately, the were two seats at the end and we were greeted immediately with menus. We arrived just minutes before the end of their Happy Hour (7pm) and without even having to ask, we were given Happy Hour menus without restrictions of not being able to order. That was refreshing!

I ordered the Enlightenment (Citron Vodka, St Germain Elderflower Liqueur, Lemon, Moscato d'Asti float) cocktail for a very cool $6. It was delicious and not overly sweet and most importantly, it contains all my favorite things! Lily had The Mountie (Canadian Club Whiskey, Peach Cordial, Lemon) cocktail and it was also delicious ($6). Both were only available on the Happy Hour menu.

Since I was hungry and we were in no hurry, I decided to peruse the menu. Both the Small Plates and A La Carte Dinner menus offer the ""Artisanal Cheese"" dish ($18) and I confirmed with the bartender that it is indeed the same offering even though each menu has different names and descriptions. This cheese plate is beautiful and really, really delicious. It featured six cheeses: Big Rock Blue cheese from California, Nerina goat cheese from Italy, MouCo Pepper Camembert from Colorado, Brillat Savarin cheese from France (triple cream Brie), Goat Blue Log from Massachusetts, and Beecher's Flagship Reserve from Washington (semi-hard cow's milk cheese; aged cheddar). They served it with lightly toasted brioche and white chocolate batard, candied pecans, caramelized red onion marmalade, and wine-reconstituted golden raisins. Phenomenal. If you like blue cheese, the two offerings were great. The cheeses that really stood out for me were the Nerina, MouCo, and Brillat Savarin. They all happen to be creamy cheeses, but the flavors were just amazing.  I would absolutely order it again and hopefully when they still have these particular cheeses! I will be on a mission to purchase those favorites.

I have to devote a paragraph to our lovely bartenders David and Dave. They were amazing. The pinnacle of excellent service and craft. They were charismatic, helpful, and very humorous. Dave (or David, I honestly can't remember who is who since they had the same name) was even kind enough to supply all the cheese information so that I wouldn't forget the delicious cheeses we devoured.

I made reservations for 2 at 9.30 on Saturday. They close their kitchen at 10.30. The Server pulled out my chair and and put on my napkin. Good signs.

I opted for the 4-course 8 dishes, $95 parallel prix fixe menu, and my bf got the $85 3-course. spring pea and ricotta ravioli for appetiser, grilled N.Y. strip loin with a side of rustic smashed potato.

My dungeness crab and ahi tuna mille feauille was was delectable, perfectly accompanied by the coconut kefir lime froth. It was a refreshing cold dish, layered with avocado. The crab was definitely very fresh.

The parallel was the seared dungeness grab cake, bedded with papaya. It was bursting with flavours, and as a hater of red pepper? I devoured it all.

Second course came the olive oil poached wild king salmon. one of the most tender salmon i've had, with a hint of citrus that accompanied the fish very nicely.

the parallel was the house made salmon angelotti in tomato dressing. The Angelotti was very al dente, I wasn't that big of a fan of this dish. it was slightly bland for my taste. I think the salmon was overpowered by the angelotti.

Next up came the Wagyu beef strip loin bedded with an abalone mushroom. The beef was very tender, the meat was full of original flavour. i did not like the abalone mushroom, the mushroom taste was overwhelming! i am normally a fan of mushroom too.

The parallel was the sea diver scallop surrounded by gnocci, morel mushroom and fava beans. O.M.G. the best scallop i've ever had. the freshness oozed out of every bite i tried to savour. It was cooked to perfection. The Gnocci was a little bland. The beans and mushroom completed the dish.

My boyfriend's spring pea and ricotta ravioli was delicious. al dente and i quote ""the best ravioli i've ever had"" For spring pea, it was full of flavour and scrumptious.
His NY strip loin was pretty good, but not the best. it was still slightly hard in medium rare. it was huge though!

Dessert was the cherry on top. My BF was stuffed and didn't want any dessert, but they still gave us a plate of 6 assorted sorbets on the house! one or two of them was a little sour, but everything else was very fruity that flawlessly melts in your mouth.  I was stuffed at this point. I finished the lemon mascarpone semifreddo, that had whole blueberries inside, YUM! Everything was melt in your mouth delicious! However, i didn't manage to finish the blueberry meyer lemon financier as I was too full. I had a couple bites and it was just too filling for me. it tasted like cake but denser, still very good. Maybe I should've packed it!  The blueberry lemon verbena sorbet was too sour for my liking. 

As we exited, rows and echoes of goodbyes and thank yous was said to us from all the servers around, including those that didn't serve us. What a way to end a special night!

Tip: Tasting menu is the way to go! only $10 more anyways! you will get full! Don't eat too much bread because you can get full from your 8 course!

Favourites: fresh, delicious and delicately cooked. great service

Do not want: pricey i guess? not too much. lack of choices

""AREOLA!!""

Now that we're done with the nipple talk, let's talk about the food. I had NO idea what to expect from this place. We were in Vegas this weekend to meet up with my fiance's mom, aunt, step sister & two sisters who were all visiting from various states. (mostly back East) His two sisters decided to book our Sat night dinner at Aureole. The restaurant itself is quite impressive with it's high ceilings and monstrous wine tower. They friggin have wine stewards PROPELLING up & down to get your wine! Like wine rock climbing! It's crazy.....anyway, we started off with our $17 cocktails which were good, but c'mon now....$17?! Whateva...then we were served our amuse bouche (yup, I learned that from Top Chef..haha) that was absolutely amazing. I can't remember what everything was, but it was all great. Then we were given our choice of the Chef's Tasting Menu (like 7 courses...forget how much it was) or your choice of First, Main & Dessert courses ($85). We all opted for the later of the two. Personally, I couldn't handle 7 courses. 

For my first course I ordered the butternut squash raviolis in brown butter sage sauce.............ohhhh good lawd, really, it was pure ecstasy in my mouf. (I'm salivating right now thinking of it) For my main course I chose the Mediterranean sea bass w/blood oranges. It was really good, but I think I prefer Chilean sea bass. It just tastes better when it's endangered.....I kid, I kid. No really, I do prefer Chilean sea bass tho. Anyhoo, for my dessert I chose the Caramel/Chocolate souffle w/banana & Bailey's ice cream. I'm no chocolate fiend, but this shit was tasty. 

The service was great....until the end when we waited FO'EVA for our check, but eh, whatever. Bill came to about $110 per person (7 of us) which wasn't too bad. The best thing was my fiance's mom & aunt picked up the bill!! (super generous) All in all it was a great time and I'd definitely go back on someone else's dime! ;)",YIGrdTE9PJO1jTJ_DbhCog,3,4,4,EnAsjgYus5KYf3x34iDwZA

The service was  pretty solid with a lot of different servers explaining the food and introducing the wine.

We did the tasting menu with the wine pairing.

The wine was fine.

The food was less than fine.

The worst course was foie gras served with a fruity syrup that reminded me of IHOP.  There was a sugary pastry with it like a small chunk of funnel cake. There was also something very off about the texture of the foie gras.  My wife refused to eat hers.

There was a salmon rillette that could be characterized as salty fish paste on stale bread.

Other courses were pretty decent.  There was a duck cavatelli and a cod dish that were Ok.  

Desert was cheesecake three ways.  One was a blue cheese cheesecake that was pretty interesting.  The other two were unremarkable.

I started off with happy hour in their bar and cocktail room with friends while we waited for our table to be prepared. All of the appetizers and drinks were delicious.

4791618,2008-12-20,3,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"This is a long-overdue review from our Thanksgiving Vega$ weekend.
Our decision to go was based on three factors:

1. Always wanted to try a Charlie Palmer restaurant, why not here?
2. Had to see the famous wine tower.  One of the seven wonders of the world, you know.
3. Had to pick a fancy restaurant that fellow Yelper, Cynthia C. hadn't yet dined at in Vegas (not an easy task, as that girl's done some professional-level eating in this city).

Set a date
Set a time
Starve yourself.

The Mandalay Bay Resort never fails to amuse me.  It's like a benign tumor that just keeps growing and growing.  I hadn't seen it in awhile, but the sheer size of the facility is impressive, even by Vegas standards.  Aureole is nestled in their restaurant row amongst some fairly ornate facades.  

**Aside, walk by Rum Jungle or Red Square and you'll never never be the same again...**

In stark contrast, the entrance to Aureole seems almost spartan in comparison.  The view changes dramatically once you're inside and staring at the four-story steel and glass phallus they call the wine tower.  It's a pretty impressive beast, and definitely the center of attention.
The main dining room softens a bit as you're surrounded in rich, dark hardwoods, white tablecloths, and leather chairs.  This is probably a deliberate attempt to distract diners from that large tumescent mamma-hamma wine tower...

Our table went with the special Riedel Anniversary tasting menu that night.  Wifey and I had to forgo the vino due to alien/parasite problems... but that's another story.

The food, however, was spectacular.  Highlights of our evening included a hunk o' otoro tuna that was otherworldly, and just about the best bison we've ever sunk our teeth into.  The flavors were almost enough to distract me from that monstrously engorged wine tower of verticality.

Conversation at the table was lively and electric.  The ladies looked terrific, but my mind was obviously elsewhere.

Wifey: ""It was so sweet of Aureole to make a substitution for one of my dishes, don' t u think, sweetie?""
Me: ""Damn, did u see the size of that tower?!?  That's one hella tower!""

Wifey: ""Don't u think Cynthia C's dress is really cute?""
Me: ""Yeah.  How many bottles do u think they can fit in that tower?  Shazam!  That thing's huge!!!

In the end, we had a great time, with delicious food and wonderful company.  My only regret of the evening was not being able to witness  the lovely wine angels glide up and down the shaft of that tower...

Finally after back and forth, they made a Veg risotto which was average at best. Then, we ended up finding a long piece of hair in the bread. When we told them, they said 'oh sorry about that, here is another piece of bread'. Really? We spent over $800 for 8 people and got lousy food and average service.

We did the parallel tasting menu and each course held its own. The salmon I had was really really great. The beef was cooked perfectly. Desserts were great. The wine pairings all went super great. But, how about some love and pride in your food and in the servers? We got an extra dessert thrown in and one other dessert wine with our last course, and that was a nice touch.

The wait was so long that I eventually got up to find the house manager and let her know that we were not happy. I am a very patient diner, so that is something that I would almost never do, but that's how bad the service was.

Wow, I'm speechless, I'll pull myself together though otherwise this won't be a very helpful review! I am by no means an expert in food or wine, but anyone can appreciate the quality of Aureole. The iPad full of bottles of wine was overwhelming but the Wine Connoisseur was, of course, extremely knowledgeable and able to suggest the perfect pairings for your meal. 

We sat in the swan court, I would highly recommend getting a table in this area. Not only do you have a view of the fountain with swans swimming in it (I was skeptical that they were real, but they were!), but you have access to a private patio. While waiting for your meal you can enjoy your drinks comfortably outside or even lounge for a few cocktails after you meal. That is the absolutely perfect dining experience in my opinion. 

As mentioned, I am not a food critic by any means so I'm not even going to try to tackle describing what we ate - it's that good. Please, just take my word for it, you will have an amazing experience and an amazing meal here. Aureole does not disappoint.

I like the setting.  Nice walkway with a long staircase down.  You get to appreciate a glass wine tower on the way down.  People actually get tied in and fly around getting bottles.  Pretty cool.

After Bouchon and Olives I was hoping this place was going to rock.

Some reviews have complained about the bread but it was great when I was there.  Clearly fresh.  The focaccia was AMAZING.  I had three pieces.  

We got the $85 Palmer tasting menu.  First round of duets was crab based.  Both were awesome.  Plenty of flavor.  One reviewer commented on the papaya not being ripe but I think that's the point.  I'm not going to get too detailed on the flavor, but I'll just say both dishes work and are decadent.  Awesome stuff based on my Michelin experiences.

Second round of duets was salmon based.  I think these rocked too.  Shout outs to the extremely good sauces and great sun dried tomatoes.  They really stood out.  Better than anything I can get in fine grocery stores.

Third round was some wagyu and diver scallop.  Scallop was perfect.  Wagyu was very flavorful and accompanied but some awesome mushrooms.  One reviewer commented it was very tough, but from my experience some of the greatest cuts of beef are very tough.  This isn't filet mignon.  The meat was very flavorful and the sauce was amazing.

Desert was a bunch of different things.  Didn't blow me away.  However the sorbets were interesting.  The cantaloupe one was great.

All in all I think I'm starting to like Charlie Palmer more and more.

Actually, I will tell you what was the worst, that the food was mediocre, for an old person's palate, and made up entirely of low-cost ingredients.

But at the end of four hours (we were told the tasting menu would take 2 1/2 hours.  Did I mention there were only seven other groups in the entire restaurant on a Friday night?)

I have not had tomatoes this flavorful since stopping on at a farm stand in the Hamptons in August. I seriously could eat this every day. The beef cheek ravoli with truffles was sooooo good. My husband's favorite appetizer was the bacon wrapped pork belly.  How can you go wrong with double pork? I would be remiss if I also didn't mention the carpaccio.
For my entree, I had the 4x seared ribeye with sea salt, soy, mirin and uni. It was absolutely delicious. My friend has the zucchini and squash ""spaghetti"" and was blown away by the house made vegan cheese.  For dessert, my favorite had to be the Mango Sundae with goat milk ice cream and dulce de leche.  Although, I also tasted the chocolate desert with berries and sorbet .......it's hard to choose!

I had little knowledge of the restaurant, it's cuisine, layout, etc... except that it sat across from the China Grill and that it housed a multi-story wine cage/vault... (basically a large glass encased storage tower you might imagine would hold... government secrets, DNA, or some kind of supercomputer... in a James Bond/Austin Powers/Mission Impossible kind of scenario--- but in this case, it was wine.) We traversed down a seemingly endless set of stairs that wrapped around the cage and arrived at the bottom to be greeted by the host. She offered us seating in either the main floor or the Swan Court. We chose the Swan Court. It was much quieter, more intimate. We sat by a set of double-pane glass doors that looked out onto our own private patio area overlooking a small Swan-filled pond. The interior decor throughout was very simple, but modern-  lots of earthtones, glass, clean-lines and height. We were then handed a PC tablet listing their wine selection (impressive), by servers dressed in full suit & tie attire (odd). Combine the decor with the technology and the server attire, and you can see why it felt as though we were in GATTACA (and feeling slightly underdressed). Nonetheless, the servers were extremely attentive, professional and knowledgable about every aspect of the dining experience... So far we've gone from 2 choices (main room or the Swan Court) to 10,000 choices (wine) back to 2 choices... either the 7-course Chef's selection or a 2 course pre-fixe menu... we chose the 7-course to taste a bit of everything, even after being warned it might take as long as 2 hours to get through the meal. Three hours (and several $$$$$) later, I found myself pleased with the whole experience and highly recommend it for a special occassion or after winning big at the tables.",l7V5w_vf9xv74As3abZukA,2,2,5,shcre2cPu3f8LYbP22Abzw
4974779,2010-09-19,3,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"A nice dinner out with the Husband can never be beat.  On this particular occasion, we chose Aureole at Mandalay.

As they showed us to our table, I reminded them that I had requested side by side seating in our reservation.  At that point, she asked if we wouldn't mind a booth and showed us to a lovely booth in the Swan's Court overlooking the swan pond.  This was actually nicer than sitting in the main dining room.

We knew we wanted to do one of their prix fixe menus, and they had two on this particular evening.  We decided on the Parallel Tasting Menu ($85 per person).  We didn't realize that this meant we would both get everything on the menu, which we actually found to our benefit.

First Course:
* Dungeness Crab and Ahi Tuna Mille Feuille, Coconut Kefir Lime Froth - Just as the waiter was about to present this to us, he realized that perhaps I could not eat the ahi tuna since I was preggos.  He immediately whisked it back to the kitchen and said he would take care of it.  We thought that was really sweet that he even remembered!  When it did arrive, only the Husband got it on his plate and I did not.  Nicely presented with a pretty foam, he wasn't as impressed with it as the crab cakes. 
* Seared Dungeness Crab Cake, Papaya Salsa, Yuzu Aioli - The Husband received only one of these while I received three (since I didn't get the crab and tuna mille feuille).  I thought it was so good, especially with the aioli.  The salsa added a nice sweetness and it was just licking it all up!

Second Course:
*Olive Oil Poached Wild King Salmon, Citrus Braised Fennel, Sambal Buerre Blanc - I'm not the biggest fan of cooked fish, but the poached salmon was okay although not extraordinary.
* House made Salmon Angelotti, Wilted Pea Tendrils, Olive Tomato Emulsion - The agnolotti pasta was a bit tough and doughy, and looked more like bone marrow covered in red sauce when it was presented.

Third Course:
* Japanese Pepper, Wagyu Beef Strip Loin, Grilled Abalone Mushroom, Sweet Potatoes Fries - My biggest fault in ordering this dish was having it medium well, which isn't exactly how I would usually have my beef (rare, please).  I think this played a factor as to why my meat was tough and not as enjoyable as it could have been.
* Seared Diver Sea Scallop, Yukon Gold Morel Mushroom and Fava Beans, Potato Gnocchi - Who doesn't like a perfectly cooked diver sea scallop?  Yum yum yum.  And with mushrooms?  Even better! 

Fourth Course: 
* Blueberry Meyer Lemon Financier 
* Lemon Mascarpone Semifreddo
* Blueberry Lemon Verbena Sorbet
All the desserts, including the complimentary trio of sorbets, were just wonderful.  (I think the flavors were coconut, tangerine, and watermelon.)  We enjoyed every bit of our trio of desserts and could have kept on going.  They definitely do their sorbets very well here too.

Service was fabulous.  The waiter was attentive without being overbearing and our beverage glasses were refilled in almost a timely manner.  The one thing that isn't so great is the house photographer.  They offer to take your picture at the beginning of the meal and have you pose in certain ways too, and then show you various packages you can buy at the end.  It's pretty expensive for a few pictures and ultimately, you just don't want it.  It can put a damper on your evening when you just want to dine, and not worry about buying silly pictures.

Overall, Aureole was a good experience.  It wasn't super fabulous and we weren't there to watch the Wine Fairies, but it was a good meal overall.  Of course, it helped that we had a restaurant.com coupon too.",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,6,6,4,o2ap5PxQSdmZawfxXRVyfw

I ordered the tasting menu and the chef accommodated my allergy with unique options that worked well with the existing menu. 

The service was impeccable. The only picky complaint I might have is about the ambiance. A frosted glass wall cut the room off and left us wanting to see more of the dining room. We only saw the bottle angels fly up the wine tower 2x and the tower lighting was such that she was hard to see. The walls could use some eye catching art -- maybe some modern tapestries to absorb the noise from the loud music bouncing around from the casino.

- bread: the pretzel bread was strange - too salty. rather than butter, it needed some wetzel's pretzels dipping cheese!
- Pineapple Mojito: their specialty drink. It was a good mojito, but I couldn't taste the pineapple!
- Porcini ravioli with a goat cheese foam and kale: excellent and filling dish. The bitterness of the kale balanced out the creamy, soft texture of the ravioli. Porcini was aplenty
- Salmon Entree: delicious, but to me, slightly overcooked and dry in the middle
- Roasted Chicken: juicy and excellent
- Tenderloin w/ Crab and Sweet POtato Mash: perfectly cooked and soft meat. The crab complimented it very well
- Pork Chops: cooked well, but tasted a bit too gamey for me.

One of my friends found a white ""hair"" in her dish and told the server. He apologized, and later the owner/manager returned and explained it was a brush bristle. He assured us that the dish would be taken off the tab, and gave her a NICE bag of gourmet truffles. Now THAT's service.

Appetizers were on point. Can't really screw up mac n cheese but it was cheesy yet with a nice crisp in certain parts for texture. Mushrooms smoky yet chewy on the inside.

Rib eye was very tender. Only complaint I had was that it was too fatty, and I usually like my rib eyes where they could benefit from some liposuction.

I could kinda surmise why the ratings are on the low side. Food was excellent but I wouldn't go back and pay $54 for that rib eye. 

I really wanted to comment on the wine, but it was too free flowing, in a good way, that I could not really keep track of it.

Maybe, I'm not overly emotional, unreasonably dramatic, or fail to exhibit the cliched passion that comes with the warm fuzzies. Possibly, it's because I'm not googley eyed and in love and have yet to demonstrate the depths of true love. That may have all changed after my exceptional experience at Aureole. I'm in love with Aureole. 

I can now rant and rave and become emotionally obsessed with the rich and decadent life that I could lead with Aureole. 

Ever had a meal so good you think that you're going to faint from the deliciousness? Ever tasted something so good you literally had that elusive foodgasm? Not an easy feat, but damn you Aureole, I'm seriously sprung off of what you have serving up!

First, let me just set the scene here. Mom, Susan 1 and I met at Mandalay for dinner. I had just come off my high of beating the house and I was ready to celebrate. We went to Strip Steak first and seeing that they had an hour wait, I remembered that incredible wine tower and boom! Dinner at Aureole was coming to fruition. We walked down the steps that curve along the wine tower-a pretty cool sight-down to the check-in stand. I wasn't in any condition for fancy dining-but it's Vegas-if you got the money, they got the goods. We were seated at a lovely table by the window. The sommelier came by and we ended up with a great bottle of Pinot Noir. Let's jump into our tasty meal.

Cavier-Russian Golden Ostera served with toast, finely chopped onions, egg white and yolk and cream. Delicious-salty, briney and heaven with every bite! Let me just say that when I ordered the cavier, our server told us that they were out. Seeing the slight disappointment in my face, he excused himself only to come back a few minutes later and said he was SENDING someone to get my cavier from another restaurant on the property. WHAT?!? 

Roasted Butternut Squash with Succotash-Smooth, nutty and just spectacular! The succotash with arugula was so good!

Roasted Chicken-served with black truffle jus-need I say more? The skin was crispy without sacrificing the moistness and flavor!

Roasted Pork Chop with roasted tomatoes-Large portion, filling and well flavored!

Duo beef filet with skirt steak-I like my steak medium rare-it came out the peerrrfect temprature and practically melted, and I mean melted in my mouth!

Creamy Spinach Au Gratin-Susan's favorite! A great side-definitely very rich!

Parmesan Fries-and dare I say I tasted some truffle oil in there? 

Dessert Sampler-Strusel Baked Apple-Yummy. Who doesn't love baked apple? It's the ultimate comfort food. Salted Caramel Bombe-Wow! Salt and sweet definitely go together here! Warm Molten Cake-I'm no chocolate lover, but I was giddy about this! Macaroon Tea Creme Brulee-a very different taste but surprisingly good!

Tasting of Pumpkin-Spiced pumpkin cake, chocolate ginger pot de creme, honey caramel lollipop. All amazing!

As if that wasn't enough-our lovely waiter, Jose brought us a large sampler of their sorbets to wrap up the night. The food was heavenly but it doesn't stop there. I don't hand out 5 star reviews just for anyone....

The great food is just like great sex. Really satisfying and fun but probably won't keep me coming back unless there is some depth....And, like I said, I'm in love with Aureole...now let me tell you why....

Our waiter, Jose was outstanding! Knowledgeable, warm and inviting! He not only brought us the sorbets but after drinking our bottle of wine-he brought me another glass of Pinot on the house! I told him how amazing our night was and thanked him for the experience. He then offered to give me, Susan and my mom a tour of the kitchen and to meet the chef!

What? I didn't even know that things like this happened! My mom is currently in culinary school and the very thought of seeing the inside workings of one of Charlie Palmer's gems was something we could not pass up! Charlie Palmer of course wasn't there but we did get to meet Chef Vincent who was not only very accommodating but welcomed us in his kitchen! He even posed for a few pictures with us. He allowed us to take pictures of his kitchen and we sat and chatted for a bit. He even signed the menu and wrote  a small note for my mom. My mom's excitement was priceless-she is extremely passionate about her culinary studies and the look on her face was worth every single penny I spent at Aureole. 

To sum it up:

Food-5 stars
Wine selection and the""angels"" that grab the bottles-5 stars
Service-10 stars (it's my review, I can give 10 stars)
Ambiance and experience-100 stars

The food, though, didn't really measure up.  It was okay, but I expected brilliance to match the price and setting.  (I almost want to rate this a 2 out of disappointment.)  I have to admit that the portions were excellent sizes -- no skimping on the appetizers or entrees.  'Entertainment'-wise, I was a bit sad that throughout my leisurely dinner I only saw the wine angels do their thing twice, and once was because a high roller specifically asked to see it.  I understand that it's not a guaranteed thing, of course -- it's not a show -- but as one of the restaurant's main showpieces, I just expected the tower to be more utilized.

my friends wanted a nice restaurant so i suggested aureole. it was a little disappointing when they would fail a little. like the entrance and no real greeting. then when we finished the bread (two small pieces doesn't do it for hungry people waiting for steak) we waited for them to come back and offer more... but they didn't. 

one friend ordered the ribeye, which i wanted. but as per my don't copy other people's food order rule, i got the lamb chops. my lamb chops were good. my friend let me try the ribeye and oh man, it was quite tasty. i wanted to grab it off her plate and eat it all hahahaha. 

i think my favorite part of the meal was my french onion soup. can't go wrong with gruyere, truffles, and foie gras in french onion soup. unless the consomme is horrible--which this one was not. best french onion soup in my opinion.

5141751,2013-09-30,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Sighhhhhh.  My wife has been wanting to dine at Aureole for quite some time so I finally obliged her and made a reservation.  Sadly for the restaurant, I'm not sure we even needed the res, and it was a Friday night.

Bread - 3 options, Rosemary, Pretzel, and (i forget the third, didn't try it).  The Rosemary was warm, fluffy, and worth a second go around.  If you've dined out at all in the last 12-18 months you probably have noticed that pretzel bread is all the rage and can be found almost anywhere.  Unfortunately, it really misses the mark here.  Maybe we were just unlucky, but the bread was room temp and fairly dry.

Apps - Here is where a little disappointment grew.  If you attempt to check out Aureole online, you will find a much different menu than what you will find in person.  I had my heart set on a shrimp scampi app prior to coming but soon found it was not available.  I was torn between two options and went with the French Onion Soup based on the waiters recommendation.  I'd say it was average, better than what you might get at a chain restaurant but not the best I've had.  My wife went with the crab risotto which was more pricey but also hearty and rich.  I would recommend it as an app to split because I think like my wife, most women would give up on the dish before finishing it.

Entrees - If you don't have an extra large appetite, the ahi tuna and scallop entree is a good option.  The tuna was high quality and cooked rare.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the spice level of the dish.  However, the portion is not very large so if your stomach is growling, you might feel like this entree is more like an appetizer.  My wife went with a lamb chop special which was nice.  The chops were fairly large in size and cooked perfectly.  Overall, she was happy with her selection and it was plenty of food for her.

Dessert - We went with the chocolate trio which is nice because it is like 3 desserts in one and is perfect for two people to split.  The fondue was my favorite of the three but the donut was not as good as a similar option we always get at Scarpetta.  Also, I forget what the middle option was called but it came with some coated bacon strips.  I think added a salty element (especially bacon) is also a very ""in"" think to do with desserts now, but the bacon here just amount to a hassle.  After only one bite it just stuck to all my teeth and was pretty annoying.

Lastly, our service wasn't bad or slow but Jerry Seinfeld might describe our waiter as a ""low talker.""  Eventually I just gave up listening to his recommendations because I couldn't hear a word he was saying.

All in all Aureole was okay, but nothing struck me as unique or superior to the many similar options in Vegas, so I can't say I would prefer to come back versus trying somewhere new.",mnoe2vwouRADn97dTDkw4A,4,0,3,tUjPhUVfQwvZIYp5EpBzPg

From the moment we arrived, everyone who worked there was extremely welcoming and friendly. We received pre-meal appetizers as we tried a glass of wine, and all of it was delicious. The dining path we chose was the Parallel Tasting menu, and boy were we pleased with our decision.

I tend not to try new foods in restaurants, especially when it's pricey. This night, however, I was determined to expand my culinary horizons and explore these dishes with an open mind. I'm thrilled that I did this.

The food and drink was extremely pleasant, the tablet used for wine ordering was great for us techies, and we saw the swans all night. What truly made the evening, though, was the outstanding service we received. Everything came to the table precisely when we wanted it. Having worked in food service, I can tell you that this takes a very attentive and coordinated server. We were never short on water, the food was always the right temperature and no dirty dishes remained on our table for more than a few minutes after we completed our courses.

Pristine white - marble everywhere.  The I-dont-know-how-many-stories-glass-wine-tower made my mouth drop.  Fluffy Swans.  Ridiculously gorgeous.

My boss had made me a reservation here as he rubs elbos with Mr. Palmer himself.  We were greeted by Aureole's Manager, Kevin, and were overly fawned upon from the moment my cousin and I introduced ourselves.  I felt old Hollywood.  Our waiter handed us an intimdating mini laptop device - aka - the wine list - and asked us to pick.  I looked at him as if he grew another head.  I told him, I trust you.   ""Well done.""  And he walks away.  

I'm not going to bore you with every detail, but let me tell you that every detail was perfectly executed.  I highly suggest the lobster ravioli and for dessert, the ladyfinger - and trust me, I had a sampling of EVERYTHING on the menu.  Not one morsel of that kitchen's mouth watering concoction goodness left unturned, unbitten, or unappreciated. 

Needless to say, my cousin and I were lit by the end of the night, drunk on wine, glorious food, and high on life.  We had the I-had-the-best- meal-of-my-life giggles and we were so satisfied with the evening we didnt even need to spend the saturday night at a vegas nightclub.  We found our way back to our hotel room and talked about dinner experience till we fell asleep.   And today, I still tell the story.

5222638,2017-01-29,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Very disappointing. I'm a chef and can be critical, but I'm also realistic. The food was mediocre and uneventful, but worse: The service was embarrassing. This was especially bad given that that the restaurant was maybe 40% full on a Saturday at 7:00 pm and had a plethora of staff. 

We weren't greeted when we got to the downstairs host/hostess stand for several minutes along with two other groups. Finally a lady came, asked our name, and told us to sit and wait on the sofa. Weird. We were seated shortly thereafter but what an odd combo to be greeted at a stand upstairs and give your name, wait, do the same downstairs, wait, get seated. 

Our server, Fernando, was very helpful and as attentive as possible. His supporting team was lacking. They cleared our starter and utensils and forgot to replenish. The two servers bringing the entrees didn't see we had no utensils. The manager would walk by the side of the dining room but not make eye contact or scan the room. I finally got up and asked if we could get utensils. Not acceptable for a $250 meal for two. 

The food? Meh. The carpaccio was creative but lacked zip. The frito misto was not impressive and had maybe a teaspoon of avocado purée under a huge pile of fried veggies. The crab roll lacked acidity and balance. While I hate the old restaurant trend of over salting to make up for mediocre flavor, all the dishes here tasted notably under salted. When there's little acidity, heat, or rounding of flavor, the low salt really stands out.

No we don't eat at Michelin star restaurants every night, but since living here we've had so much damn good food! My standards for a 5 star dining place are really high - I expect the best when I'm shelling out big bucks! 

We were drawn to Aureole by a $50 GC from restaurant.com and an $85 valentines day weekend 5 course menu. The menu *sounded* good and we'd never tried Aureole so figured it was a great time to give it a go. 

I think I read the word ""Corporate"" in someone else's review in describing the atmosphere. It was pretty, but it felt like a nice hotel in Sweden or something to me. It was cold, austere, modern, but not in a ""cool"" sense. Just kinda blah.

The wine angel and wine tablet were freaking cool. I was however disappointed by their insane prices (only 3 red wines in the entire book under $50 that I could find!) and every wine I wanted to drink (favorites from Napa/Italy) weren't in there. So much for their huge wine list. We did try a $60 or so bottle from Italy and were happy, however.

Anyways, if you're still with me.. here's the food!

*Caviar/Smoked Salmon: So incredibly blah and boring. I love smoked salmon but this fell flat. I had a better smoked salmon appetizer at a wedding I was at recently - sad.

*Short Rib Ravioli with Foie Gras - This was divine and saved the meal from being one of the most boring meals I've had in a long time.

*Dover Sole - bland and tasteless. I took 2 bites and quit eating it. 

*Beef Wellington - I do love me some Beef Wellington but this was one of the worst I've had. Not particularly flavorful and didn't compare to Chef's Palette in Henderson. 

*Dessert - lots of sorbet, some raspberry parfait thing, some icky coffee flavored ""tart"". Nothing to write home about. 

Overall I was pretty disappointed by this pricey dinner. None of the food was awful, but it was so freaking boring and bland I felt like I was eating cruise line food or catered food. There weren't those special touches you get at Alex (amuse bouche platter, special desserts,etc) and for $40 more per person I wish I had spent my money there instead! 

For the record I also was pretty disappointed by Charlie Palmer Steak in the Four Seasons. Maybe his NYC outposts are good, but his Vegas restaurants could really use some work!",kmE8w5Y785eZmodsx0V6Ag,4,4,3,qT8yY7cW5djgotMG8LDRHA
5279559,2018-01-22,5,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Although many are likely unaware of Chef Charlie Palmer's eponymous Steakhouse at Four Seasons it would be difficult for anyone visiting The Mandalay Bay complex to miss Aureole, still to this day one of Las Vegas' most dramatic rooms and a post-dinner visit on Friday once again telling of a combination of gifted individuals and exceptional product.

Toqued by the Michigan-Ohio combination of Chef John Church and Executive Sous Chef Athena Thickstun, the latter largely responsible for a menu of sweets that evolves gradually to compliment the former's focus on elegant seasonal fare, it was shortly after descending the staircase around Aureole's several-story Wine Vault that greetings were offered by the Restaurant's General Manager, a choice of seats thanks to low volume presenting a sizeable two-top at the main room's center.

Exactly 1/2 changed from a November visit, Pumpkin Bread Pudding as well as the Rose Apple Tart lost to colder weather and Passion Fruit nowhere to be found, it was with Espresso in hand that Chef Thickstun described a Creamsicle Parfait to start things off light, the mimetic Orange at the center of a large plate surrounded with White Chocolate squiggles and filled with Vanilla Ice Cream atop a dense Pistachio Cake that nicely tempered the sour Winter Citrus. 

Moving next to a Brownie Sundae, Charlie Palmer's ""Progressive American"" style nowhere better exampled than in a combination of Chocolate and Peanut Butter that one-ups the similar Candy Bar at his Steakhouse by way of myriad textures and a bigger scoop of Ice Cream, it was with the last bits of Brittle consumed that 2017's North American Dessert of the year made its return, Chef Thickstun's boozy Bananas Foster just as remarkable this time around with two Almond Cakes soaked in Rum propping up cubes of Bruleed Fruit beneath slowly melting Sorbet that tastes exactly like toasted Coconut.

At this point perfectly contented yet simultaneously excited to try more it was in an unexpected turn that course four saw Athena deliver her newest creation, the cool grey skies outside apparently in need of a splash of color that she was happy to provide in the form of bite-sized ""Candy Apples"" amidst piping hot Mexican Donuts, housemade Caramel Corn and Cinnamon Ice Cream nuggets protected from melting by rainbow Sprinkles. 

Opting for two additional shots of Espresso to finish, Chef Church's signature Cheesecake Trio best left for another time, it was much like the week before Thanksgiving that the night ended with Crème Brulee, the flavor of Maple Syrup this time seeming a little more prominent as the base upon which guests are treated to emulsified drops of Minus 8 Vinegar, Pomegranate Arils and bitter-sweet Cranberry Sorbet.

FIVE STARS:  While most are aware that Chef John Church has essentially reinvented Aureole Las Vegas and reestablished the Restaurant as one of Sin City's top five places for dinner fewer are familiar with Chef Athena Thickstun, though if she continues at her current pace it seems fairly certain that will not be the case for long.

Our friends had dined here previously and loved it so we gave it a shot.  Before dinner, we had drinks at Red Square next door which has an amazing vodka selection.  If you're really crazy, you can go into the ice room where you have to wear parkas and shoe covers.  My wife wasn't down for that because she was wearing fancy shoes for Aureole.

Aureole appears to no longer have long tasting menus and instead has a four-course (which is really 8 courses) ""parallel"" tasting menu.  Each course is brought out on a plate with 2 halves to eat side by side.  Basically, we loved everything they put in front of us.  The beet sald and the duck were particular highlights for me.  The wine pairings were excellent and they provided VERY generous pours (something I consider a hallmark of a great tasing menu).  The quality of wines were outstanding (Inniskillin for desert, all right).

We had a blast at Aureole.  The servers and food were great and we'll definitely go again sometime.  The only negative thing I can say is not once (not even once) did I seen any of the wine fairies go up the tower.  My wife said she saw one when we were first walking in but I missed it.

He got the wrong order, neglected to bring some order, and bragged to us about how he didn't charge for the dessert that came out since it was a birthday celebration. I thought restaurants didn't really charge for a birthday dessert in the first place?
It was very hard to speak up at the time because our parents were wanting to have a good time and keep the spirits up and not be downers. We were all definitely boiling inside, but to be considerate to the establishment, we didn't really speak our frustrations until after the dining experience had ended.

Just for fun, we wanted to see what the highest priced wine bottle was, and I believe it was in the $thousands!  The service was great; perhaps a little too overbearing, as the waiter was constantly checking up on us every 5 minutes, it felt like.  My bf and I ordered from the $75 3-course prix-fixe menu (I believe there is a $95 7-course menu too), and the water gave us an extra dessert with a candle for his b-day.  Food portions were average.  My main entree was the salmon, and my bf's was one of the steaks, and his steak totally trumped my salmon.  It has an overall romantic and classy atmosphere.

We had the 3-course prix fixe. The wine list is overwhelming. Wonderful soup and even the fried calamari (seemed out of place) was tender with a tasty rice salad. Fish and Steak entrees were wonderful. It was our Anniversary so they brought a sorbet tasting (my wife loved this). Otherwise the deserts were just ok. 

We did have an issue you might watch out for. We were not offered a menu for the 3-course prix fixe ($55 before 7:00, on the sign outside) but offered a $95 4-course. We asked for the 3-course and a new menu arrived (shouldn't have to ask). On this menu the same 4-course on the other menu was now $85 (hmmm). Then our bill came and we were charged $65 (after 7:00 price). That was awkward/unprofessional.

We did not choose the wine pairing which would have cost another $95 on top of the $145 and instead just ordered one glass of Pinot Noir which was delicious.
It started with a very nice beef carpaccio, followed by an absolutely delicious scallop,  followed by fois gras with waffle and strawberry, leading to an incredibly delicious Seabass and then one had a choice between the duck or lamb and I chose the lamb which was delicious. The dessert was a delicious pannacotta that was just too beautiful to look at. Overall, it was a good meal. I was not crazy about the fois gras and have had better yet otherwise it was lovely.

It just was meh... which was very disappointing as I had a friend from our of town that I wanted to spoil. It had been years since I had been here and it just didn't meet the experience I had painted I. My mind.

First off, I bragged about the amazing wine tower and wine angels. From what I remembered the angels wore a practical yet kind of sophisticated sleek looking black cat suit as they were reeled up and down that impressive tower. The poor girl was wearing a very unflattering thing that kind was kind of a boring grayish nude color and sneakers. When I'm paying for a fine dining experience I don't want something reminiscent of a gym suit with a sneaker in my face. 

Now the fiasco that is the menu... we had already planned on doing the special Restaurant Week menu but being that we are both foodies we still wanted to start with an app to share. The menu was incredibly confusing as it's not broken down into appetizers and entrees. It's all clumped together based on veggies, land or sea so we had no idea what was a realistic shareable item versus an entree. It wasn't until about 20-30 minutes of us staring in confusion on what the heck we are looking at before the server came by to explain it. A menu shouldn't be that confusing that you can't figure out where the appetizers are listed. 

We are pretty big into wine and part of the reason we chose this place was for the dynamic wine list. But let's face it, the more options the more overwhelming it can be. So we asked our server for help and we really kind of expected a sommelier to come and ask questions about our palates and what we planned on ordering. That's part of the fun in choosing such a wine centric restaurant. The server was nice enough but just kind of fumbled and seemed to just make a pure random suggestion.

Now that we figured out how to unlock the appetizer mystery, we were super excited to see there was a bacon wrapped pork belly topped with egg. The pork belly itself was amazing however the egg on top should have been sexy and oozing when the yolk was hit. It was way over done. No sexy oozing there which was a big disappointment to what should have been an amazing dish.  

For my entree I originally was going to get the seafood risotto but the server awkwardly talked me into the filet instead. I am by no means opposed to a good steak but they are a dime a dozen in this town and I wanted something interesting. I love servers suggestions since they are usually in the know and can guide you into something you may have overlooked. But it's really odd when someone orders something like seafood and is guided to an extreme opposite like a steak. I went with his suggestion even though I was really excited to try the risotto. It was as if there was something he knew that was top secret.  Like maybe people kept sending it back or the fish wasn't fresh. So since I didn't feel like dying I reluctantly went with the filet. The filet was amazing as I would expect no less from Charlie Palmer.  My friend is trying to eat healthier (yes this is the same person that just ordered bacon wrapped pork belly) and ordered the zucchini pasta with vegan cheese for her entree. I'm really kind of shocked that my filet tasting menu was the same price as her vegetarian pasta that I could have made at home with my spiralizer. She said it was good but at $80 per person that should have been fantastic. Saying you used black garlic just doesn't seem like enough to justify a cost like that.

Dessert was interesting. It was a trio of cheesecake representing Brie, cheddar and blue cheese. I'm all about teasing the taste buds by dancing between the sweet and savory but this just didn't seem to work especially on the blue cheese portion. It was just too salty and not enough vibrancy to offset it. Not an exciting way to finish off the meal.

Now the bathroom situation. Really awkward and not classy at all. First they are individual restrooms which is a nice touch at a place that is supposed to be elegant. However, there is no mirror or sink in there and you basically go to a co-ed mirror and wash station. And there was some creepy guy that kept lurking around the corner watching. Maybe this is a sign of the times of no longer having assigned sex bathrooms. But the last thing I want at a fine dining establishment is some creepster checking me out as I'm trying to remove spinach lodged in my teeth.

From my understanding they recently underwent a big remodel and were closed for awhile. That could explain some things going on but don't charge top dollar while you are still in practice.  Better off going to Charlie Palmer's Steak in the adjoining Four Seasons. It doesn't have that beautiful monstrosity of a wine tower but I have been there more than a dozen times and have always had an exceptional experience.",BbwldZQM1i89cAvV7fce3A,5,2,3,c2tbLzW67thgN9c9bFetHA

5435086,2010-10-13,0,MqYYYNA-ZYvV-1w5qcmMoA,"Was so excited to visit this restaurant on a recent trip to Vegas and it fell short of all our expectations. The sommelier and the wine was excellent and we loved the appetizers, hence the two star review. However, the service, main entrees, and desserts were horrible and we would never return.

We went with a party of 8 for an early Friday night dinner (6pm) because we had a show at 9:30 and wanted to savor the wine and food. The restaurant was basically empty and they sat us at a table right next to a room with a large wedding reception going on. I politely asked our waiter to reseat us right before the water was poured since there was no dearth of free tables and he had every excuse in the book for not reseating us (""Oh, they're just taking their seats, it'll quiet down soon."" ""We can close the doors a bit."")

I couldn't hear anyone at opposite side of the table, so I pulled the waiter over again and told him we wanted to be reseated (""But you have the best table here!"") or else we'd be leaving. On second thought, we should have just left and gone to one of the other restaurants at Mandalay Bay since we basically had a great experience at every one we tried. Finally we were reseated at a much better table. Finally.

We were appeased by the appetizers and wine. I had four oysters on the half shell that were served with lemon horseradish and tabasco. Yummy. I also had a small plate of a peach and cheese tartlet that was delish. The Caesar salad a dining companion ordered was ""deconstructed"" and looked cool, but tasted bland. But an order of yellowtail served with kiwi and watermelon puree was excellent.

Well, the main star of Aureole was the wine and its computerized wine list (given on an iPad type device) and the ""wine fairies"" that are suspended in a wine tower and retrieve your choices. We enjoyed a peppery Chilean Malbec and a buttery Napa Chardonnay that were delicious and enjoyed by the entire table.

I wish we had just ended the dinner there because the main entrees were a huge disappointment. I ordered the entree of tuna and veal which was stone cold. I sent it back and it was obvious they just microwaved it becuase the tuna (which was ordered rare) was now barely even pink. The sauce it was served in was salty and overpowering I sent it back again and they offered me something else, but by that point, my stomach had turned and I didn't want anything else. Steaks at the table were fine, but not worth the $40-50 pricetag and not as good as The Palm or another high-end chain. Two dinners got the tasting menu and were not impressed either.

Desserts came out and one called ""chocolate decadence"" basically had a little chocolate tart the size of a half dollar coin. We laughed at how ridiculous the dessert was since it barely looked chocolatey and didn't ooze chocolate like you'd expect.

To their credit, Aureole tried to make it better, though I could tell that the waiter was sullen and pissed off. They gave us $100 off the bill, gave us three plates of ice cream (which was chocolatier than the decadance) and a bottle of pink dessert wine that was unbelieveably good.

So there you go. If you go, go for apps and wine in the lounge. You'll get the same ambiance, good appetizers, and the same wine list.",RbZ5t70euzKJZmADlEogrQ,1,0,2,sl2oqjWMJ0lbE7BgRHndGQ

I was unable to view anything going on with the wine vault. Also, the tables are not centered around it as we both assumed they'd be (and we all know what happens when one assumes....) 

Okay, so it wasn't centered around gravity defying, wine grabbing ladies. No biggie. They must have a great selection of wine, right?! That they do BUT they present it in an iPad from 2004 judging from its weight. Okay...progressive people, I'm cool with that! Except the list is broken down into such minute categories with no way to view them all at once. Want a wine from France? Better know what region it comes from!

I'm not going to offer any suggestions cause that's not my job"" *leaves table*) we were greeted by our (what I can only assume was our arrogant waiter) who read the menu to us and then (literally) tossed the menu back in front of me and walked off. No suggestions, no asking if we needed anything...nada. Dude walked off like he had just done us a favor. Cause we can't read. Ugh.

The wait staff is Johnny-on-the-spot without being overly intrusive, which is sometimes a hard thing to balance.  The were all very helpful and ready with suggestions, including one that actually saved us money by telling us about an option we weren't aware of.  

Naturally, we had wine. I assume you'd be tossed out and not invited back if you didn't, given the effort they put into the cellar.  The wines were marked up the typical amount for restaurants of this caliber, and we found one that we'd enjoyed before at a reasonable price (reasonable for Vegas, not for Total Wine). We watched the wine angel grab it and bring it down, which is always an interesting experience, given its uniqueness.

tldr: Eh.  It's good but not great.  I can't decide whether to give them a 3 or a 4.  Definitely not getting a 5.  I expected a little more from a Michelin star.  I've had better dinners at Vegas restaurants without a Michelin star.

We had:
Apps:
Short rib rav: Very good.  4 raviolis.  

Calamari: It was good but needed more aioli.  It was just a light squirt around the bottom of the plate.  You end up with some with a fair amount on them and some with none on them, and I want to taste the aioli.  If they think providing a ramekin with aioli on the side is gauche then they need to use a bit more on the plate IMO.  Or just give me the ramekin and let me dunk those mothers to my hearts content.

Sides:
Mushrooms: These were great.  Nice variety and great flavor.  Maybe coulda been sauteed a little harder but I'm not really complaining.

Brussel sprouts: I liked em quite a bit but the spouse wasn't a big fan despite loving veggies in general and sprouts in particular.

Mains:
Filet: It was great but not amazing.  Cooked to the proper temp.  Maybe could have used a bit more sear.  

Frutti di mare risotto: I loved it but I also wonder if people might think it was a little too rich, lotta cream and fat for a risotto.  Might be great for an app, to be honest, split between 4 people.  Definitely a solid amount of seafood.

Service: First off, I hate ""over service"" more than under.  Like if you've got 3 different people asking me how my meal is every 4 minutes, I'm gonna get pissed.  If you're topping my water off when it's 70% full over and over, I'm gonna get pissed.  If you ask to clear my plate when there's still half a shrimp on it, not only am I gonna get pissed, I might punch you in the dilz.  

But I don't like having an empty water glass for more than 3 seconds either, and for ~$300+ for two people at a Michelin starred restaurant that shouldn't happen either.

Aureole was closer to the latter than the former.  It wasn't to the extent I would call it bad service, but it wasn't perfect service by any means.

The jamon, and yes I know it's expensive, was a pretty small piece compared to the size of the meatballs. They were heavily garnished with chives that tasted more like spinach than chives and I thought detracted from the dish. I can make better meatballs in my sleep at home and by a fair margin - there was nothing unctuous or delicious about these by any stretch of the imagination. You'd be happier at Bucca di Beppo. There is a reason some combination of beef, pork and veal is most often used.

Ahh, fried chicken oysters - cool concept! If you've ever roasted a full chicken, you'll know these are the moistest and most wonderful two pieces you can get. So, imagine our displeasure to find that (1) all of the pieces in the dish had different levels of breading and far worse (2) they were all overcooked. And not just a bit overcooked. This is plainly and simply a dish that doesn't improve on the original in any way. Further, there was a buttermilk base to it not listed in the description, which while good, had too much cream for me. I was pretty shocked to taste this when two chicken oysters from a grocery store rotisserie chicken would be far superior. Taken together with the lemon butter and all components as intended, it was a nice bite of food but shouldn't have been put on the menu.

FWIW, I agree wholeheartedly with the chef below who said their food is undersalted. I eat a low salt diet, am extremely sensitive to salt and everything just read very blandly during our visit.

My cocktail was great which I was more than happy to pay $9 for and service was very good, as well. But when the food was this mediocre, happy hour prices or not, we won't be returning, and we certainly won't be risking $100-300 to eat here. Way too bad considering the new chef who has taken over at the helm with some great buzz about him. It was also really weird/awkward having the wine angel just sitting around by the server station in the bar area drinking an energy drink waiting for someone to order wine.",d2BcWq9vJcn23oRP5awPRA,2,0,2,Y7vXOPXUlo-nwNzyEGxi5A

So why would a restaurant that rated as one of the best wine destinations by Wine Enthusiast magazine only get four stars from me? Because the downstairs bathroom floor was chipped and disgusting and because it took over THREE hours for two people to eat dinner here.  My suggestion: when the waiter asks if you are seeing a show later that you need to keep dinner short, just say, ""Yes.""

It's a typical higher end steakhouse with pedestrian dishes, not very big portions, and served at higher price which is normal for most any and all Las Vegas Resort Casinos.  

One thing we noticed is outside the restaurant entrance podium they advertise a 3 course meal for $55.00 but once you are seated inside their is no mention of this special anywhere on the menu nor do the servers mention it when being served.  When we inquired about it we got the feeling the server was not interested because of his response to us was very vague and his body language just says he wasn't interested.  It was pretty funny.  Note to Aureole management:  Take down that 3 course meal advertisement at the entrance podium if your aren't interested in selling it to your patrons once inside. It kind of comes off as a bait and switch tactic if you get my drift.

While the service was okay, the ambiance seems a little dated here (late 1990's early 2000).  The wine tower and wine angel is kind of a cool gimmick.  The restaurant wasn't that busy and makes one wonder how long they can stay in business for.

We were offered a spot in the lounge as we just wanted a little bubbly to cap the birthday celebrations for my sis. We didn't need table service for that, so we headed into the lounge and, as directed, chose our own seating.

Grabbing a high top along the wall, we took our seats and looked around, having enjoyed the walk down around the wine tower, and generally getting our bearings on the ambiance and decor.

After about 5 minutes, we finally got some eye contact and some menus. The waiter all but dropped them and walked away had my sis not asked immediately for water glasses.

After almost 10 minutes, we flagged someone else down, explained that our waiter had not been back in some time, reiterated our request for water, and asked to place our order. While waiting, we saw a dessert sampler served to the table next to us and decided to give it a go.

The fizzy stuff came out in good time, we had a toast, and we waited, chatted, and lamented the fact that we would, in all probability, explode before the evening was out (see previous review of STRIPSTEAK ;)).

The dessert came out and we were not disappointed (nor did we care about our impending food-induced doomsday). The molten lava cake was melt-in-your-mouth perfect, the brownie and mousse had a bit of a spicy kick to it and was, overall, amazing. The strawberry shortcake was bland and a bit on the dry side, and the creme brulee was too soft (probably a result of too small a serving, the crisping of the crust alone would melt the tiny bit of creme in the dish).

The original waiter came by and asked if we were finished. We assured him we were, he nodded, and then... he left. He left everything on the table and just left. When he returned (almost 10 minutes later?) he asked again if we were finished and if we'd like the check. We again answered in the affirmative and he disappeared only to return with the bill; someone else finally came and cleared the table.

$40 for a dessert sampler and two glasses of bubbly enjoyed in the bar/lounge. That didn't bother me as much as the inattentive, slow, and inefficient service.

The 3-course has an option for an appetizer, entree, & dessert. I would say that their forte lies in the entrees. The pork belly & seafood dishes were both very delicious.

The desserts were just okay, nothing spectacular.

Of course, the wine list is also very impressive. Honestly, I was surprised to see a plethora of somewhat affordable wines. You can find some great wines for under $50.

This restaurant is beautiful.  We were seated at a table with our own private outdoor area.  Our table was inside, and we had french doors that opened up to our private patio with another table that was right next to a pool that had swans swimming back and forth.  It was so romantic and beautiful.  We went outside once or twice to smoke a cigarette (since the dinner experience was 3 hours long) and to have dessert out there.  The swans swimming 2 feet next to us was a nice touch...although they didn't seem people-friendly.  It was a dining experience I'll never forget...sitting out there in the warm desert night with swans surrounding us.

The thing I didn't really like about Aureole was that we had to choose from either a $120 pre fix menu or a more expensive pre fix menu option (I think it was $200 but I cant remember).  So, with wine and tip we ended up paying more than expected.  I would have appreciated if we were allowed to choose our items a la cart, instead of being forced to have a tasting menu.  The food was a solid 3.  It was good, but not memorable.

We ate in the court in which you can see the swans swimming in the pond.  It's about $95 per person for a four course meal.  
Dinner:  food was ok.  I love food for starters, let me say this.  I love different flavors and such.  However, I wasn't too blown away by what was presented.  Don't get me wrong, the presentation was beautiful.  However, the food was so so.  The highlight was the beef tartare.  I thought that to be very delicious.  I did not care for either veal dish presented.  That was my least favorite.  
The dessert was a duo of white chocolate and dark chocolate with mango sorbet.   The white chocolate dessert was delicious however i feel the mango should have been left completely off of the dark chocolate dessert.  I love the bitterness of dark chocolate and felt as though the mango did not pair well at all with this dish.
Service:  I believe service could have been a bit more personable.  Our drinks were constantly refilled, but we barely saw our waiter except when being served our meal.  To his credit he explained each dish and what we were seeing--but I expected that.  What I was looking for we him to ask if everything was ok and if there was anything that could be changed--he only asked during the next to the last course. 
Cocktails:  they definitely utilize premium liquor for these cocktails.

The place has a beautiful atmosphere with very friendly wait staff and host.  We sat down to eat and picked out a glass of wine and our meals.  I have to say when the food came it was served in such a large dish, but there wasn't much food on it.  The food that I did eat was very tasteful but there wasn't much.  For the price you pay, you'd hope to have your full but I left craving a cheeseburger.

There is much better value at other restaurants at the Mandalay Bay.  Unless you already ate and looking for a nice dessert and port wine I don't recommend coming here because you will leave hungry after dropping $200.",GoSIyXJz4hfno0psnEWFKw,0,0,2,UNdypLMe6wU1jSQquCKvHw

We ordered the double rib eye steak special and the caprese salad special and soft drinks. No alcohol for the pregnant lady! 

The caprese was delish-delicate, seasoned well and very light (melted in your mouth) $20
The steak came out carved, sliced, juicy and ready to eat! Three sauces accompanied the huge steak that wasn't two steaks but was just one huge slab of meat. It was really rare for medium well but too bad, better to be rare than burnt so we enjoyed anyway. $140
Side dishes were: potato purée-awesome and yummy and very buttery but delicious $12
Parmigiana French fries-kinda cold, kinda greasy, kinda heavy. Didn't care for them. $11

Service was good. Malik was our waiter and he was friendly and helpful and described everything. My only complaint is that we had servers and bussers watching our every move but every time our glasses were empty we had to actually ask for refills. We shouldn't have had to ask for anything when the place was empty and three or four people didn't take their eyes off of us.

We all ordered the $65 prix fixe menu, and of course - at my table with the dad, we ordered a tasty bottle of grenache from alta maria vineyards. this was recommended by the very helpful & knowledgeable the sommelier. at a place like this - asking for a reco is the way to go :) the cool wine tablet menu was cool - but talking to a person was much nicer. she gave several options in our price range based on our descriptors of what we liked and what we were planning to order - fantastic job, thanks allison!

I had pre read some yelp reviews and heard that the halibut was only so so, so the entree choice was easy. for the first course, my dad and i ordered one of each. i really liked both, but if you don't like cold soup - opt for the salad! 

the hanger steak was amazing. i'm not usually a fan of sauces or seasoning on my steak, but this steak's flavors were really perfect - spicy & rich, but not heavy - it complemented the steaks natural flavors really well. add a sip of the grenache which was spicy with a touch of sweetness and it was a 'remy' moment. i can still taste it and i had it over 6 months ago...

for desserts - our server pretty much made it clear that the banana fosters tiramisu was the way to go, and it WAS. my dad ate the dessert in a blink, and started to eye mine!

All in all, was totally worth the experience & the $200+ bill after, but i had to dock a point off for the fact that the halibut and dark spearmint dessert (characterized as a big andes bar by sister who was at the other table) were only ok. for me - a restaurant of this caliber should have ALL excellent choices on a prix fix, and it was pretty obvious that wasn't the case. 

PS - bread selections were also amazing! and yes - the wine tower was amazing as well (but there are already plenty of posts on that!)",Cbw1IKmtlycJeZgxLImcUQ,2,3,4,OqLs63K6blwUjxx186w_nw

Directions: To begin, the restaurant is located in Mandalay Bay. To get there, enter in through the main doors and continue to the left of the casino. Upon entering you'll find a large glass wine storage vault extending 3 floors. Follow the spiral staircase around the wine vault and check in at the front desk.

Ambiance: Really nice but very classy and casual. The wine vault is really amazing and you can watch as a gymnast/ trapeze artist/ waitress ascends and descents hoisted by a wire harness to retrieve your wine.

Food: My group opted to order the 8 course parallel pairing with two bottles of wine. Roughly our bill came out to $120. The meal was... incredible. Dinner was served in 4 courses where each contained a unifying ingredient prepared in two vary different ways. As I expect the menu regularly changes, briefly some highlights were: Corn chowder with a ginger sauce, blood orange salmon gravlax ricotta lobster ravioli, and a grape a goat cheese tart. All were amazing and to be able to taste how a single ingredient could be prepared in such different ways was wonderful. Needless to say, we were all very full upon completing our meals and were very content.

Wine: The wine collection is extensive.

I'm not sure if maybe that was our mistake, but I've been to plenty of other places where the pre-theater menu's been outstanding. Was a little disappointed w/this particular Charlie Palmer location. Maybe Dry Creek won't disappoint the next time I go to Wine Country..

Also, there was a rather pushy photographer moving from table to table offering to take pictures of people, and then interrupting your dinner with a sales pitch. I'm surprised the staff at Aureole allow that..

The cheese plate was absolutely lovely and the hummus was very good as well. We all enjoyed our wine selections and had a wonderful time except for the fact that the service was a bit brusque. I felt a little as though they were trying to turn the table, even though the bar area was less than half full and we did end up spending about $100 there.

The hostess sat us at a table in the lounge, and we waited 20 minutes and were never given menus, water or even a polite ""be right with you"". Four different service staff made eye contact with me, and then looked away with no action. I even attempted to get up and track someone down with no success. 
It seemed steady in the restaurant, and everyone may have been busy, but that is no excuse when the tables all around you (sat around 2-3 minutes after you) already had menus and at least water. 
We got up and left. As we walked out, we let the hostess know, and all she asked was if we spoke to a manager on the floor. Considering we couldn't get anyone to speak with us, except her, we just left without so much as an apology. 
I would love to go back and try the restaurant, but if this is the service given on a Tuesday...i can't imagine what I may encounter on a peak night.

Ok onto the food. I can make this very short and to the point, UNEDIBLE! We sent back every course except the the white truffles risotto. The rest of the food and I mean all four courses because even the second choices the manager had made for us to try and compensate for the disastrous first course was horrible.

It's in the lower level so either you need to take the elevator or walk down by the two-story glass enclosed wine cellar which the harness mounted wine tenders go up and down to get your bottle while tourists take photos.

Menu is somewhat similar to the New York location with a good choice of seafood and meat dishes. No matter what your liking us you will find a dish but somewhat on the pricey side. 

There are bar seating, main dining room and also outdoor seating if you feel like it.

Wine list seems a lot more approachable than the New York location. Wines by the bottle from low $50s to four digits, if you have been winning big at the casino floor.

But, since we were in Vegas, and didn't feel like dining with the masses from Des Moines, we thought we'd have some fun and have a nice dinner to celebrate a great 2006. The PC tablet for the wine list is great in theory, but also sort of gimmicky, and we felt that ultimately the 10,000+ bottle wine selection was a bit overwhelming. Although the sommelier was helpful in narrowing down the choices, it definitely helped to have some knowledge of wine going in.  As for the meal itself, again, good, but not great. Nothing really jumps out at me as being a standout, and I can't even recall what I ate at this point. Contrast this to some of my 5-star restaurant experiences, and I can remember every last detail. Finally, but service seemed a bit schizo... we had at least three different waiters, all of whom would show up randomly throughout the meal.
