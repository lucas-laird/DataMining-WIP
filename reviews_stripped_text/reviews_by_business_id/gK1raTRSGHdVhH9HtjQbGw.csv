Would help if they had a few chairs to sit on.  Shave ice consistency is perfect.",noq7Ud-FMLMVVsVA3VJUqA,0,0,4,gQHhRgLqeU0chHHtp82qwQ

People here are nice and give great customer service. The Hawaiian frost and shave ice are perfect for the crazy summer heat here in Vegas. Also reminds me of a certain shave ice place back home. The ice they use is so soft, how it's supposed to be! Not the typical mainland ""snow cone"" hard ice. If you haven't gone to them yet you need to!! We definitely will be here all the time :)",DGY3ijPigPj9J7_hDvzEIQ,1,0,5,jlHepz4Gxd9yxv2ua2tunA

It's conveniently minutes away from our home and such a refreshing treat in this crazy Vegas heat of ours. I've tried a lot of shave ice here in town and never found anything as good as back home on Oahu until now. I may prefer this over Matsumoto's actually - crazy right?! Luckily we've only experienced a wait once here and still, it was only maybe 7-10 minutes with 5 people ahead of us. Pua and Lei are so fast and provide great customer service! 

Li Hing Mui shave ice with a scoop of Thrifty's ice cream and condensed milk to top it off is my absolute favorite! Must try! :)",jdjESW4dihwo9Ts5Ua3Kcw,1,1,5,RWQCloTHVxk1BJ9wcv2MLA
4180842,2015-07-09,2,gK1raTRSGHdVhH9HtjQbGw,"This place is terrible. The small size ""frost"" is served in Dixie cups. It's too sweet and doesn't taste like vanilla. It melts right away and gets super watery. Plus, I got a stomachache after eating this. Do not go there no matter how hot it is. You'll only be left thirsty.",HKPjwBQhQIDmUFgkyxeung,0,1,1,p29ALUDtjJR1t-r1JCPBSA

I like to get the Tigers blood with the ice cream in the bottom and extra condensed milk! So amazing. 

Thanks for the great service and quick shave ice. We will see you soon!!",Mxw5FCfuqgZmMtuqK9Uc_A,2,2,5,Ns5xGbs8i5WLMT_pNunlpA

Perfect for the summer heat in Las Vegas.
Unlike a regular shaved ice stand, they offer Hawaiian Frost, a Hawaiian Dairy Treat that comes in 6 different flavors: Strawberry, Strawberry Banana, Island Coffee, Coconut, Strawberry Vanilla and Honeydew Melon. Our family tried the Strawberry Banana, Strawberry Vanilla and Coconut tonight. All 3 tasted great, I especially loved the Coconut, it had lots of real coconut, filled in every single scoop!

They will be at this location for the rest of this summer and possibly into the Fall too. I am definitely coming back to try the other flavors and buying some to take home!",QtMgqKY_GF3XkOpXonaExA,4,1,5,_XLWfRX_fRgz_5ruSaJ1VQ
5455242,2016-08-23,0,gK1raTRSGHdVhH9HtjQbGw,"I'm from Hawaii so I know how real shave ice should taste and this place is the real deal. I got the large rainbow with ice cream and it was delicious and not overly sweet and the consistency of the ice is perfect. Also tried the Tigers blood flavor which is a coconut strawberry flavor. It had a strong coconut flavor which I didn't like too much but my brother enjoyed it. I didn't have a chance to try the soft serve which I always had back home so I definitely will come back. 
The only reason I'm taking off one star is because when we arrived there no staff was visible. The lights were on the bench was out and they looked opened but I couldn't see anyone in there. So after bout 5 minutes went back into my car and called the number listed on Yelp. I spoke to someone on the phone and he said that someone is there and just to knock and they might be closing up earlier because of the weather which was kinda gloomy. And once I hung up and walked back there was an employee there.",P19z16iz5I9Hh4T99pY8Sg,1,0,4,fbiFzzffqfgLw2YD4VhIxg
5531515,2016-09-18,0,gK1raTRSGHdVhH9HtjQbGw,I love this place! I come here maybe 3-4 times a week! They have so many flavors to choose from and so many choices to get! They also have Li-Hing Mui which is a PLUS if you're from Hawaii! Conveniently located on the corner of Rainbow/Windmill in the Yellow food truck! You can't miss it!,6KG5fzM_GwdiGhqTeMkT4Q,0,0,5,0mHHzkStf_SNvdwbEYq6Cg
