The eggs were cooked well, the steak was very thin and had a lot of fat.  But for $5.99 between the hours of 2 and 5am, who cares!   Note: there are absolutely NO substitutions for the special.  A friend of ours didn't like eggs and asked for more potatoes and they would not do it.  We also ate breakfast here one morning and it was average.  A bonus is that you can play KENO while waiting for your food.  I would say if you are drunk, hung over, or cheap it's definately the place to go.",RXcXvOok5rimXK-W9J935w,1,0,2,6_MR6JnPUDiN5WzYSlCnjA

964379,2009-06-04,0,G9OOkWH5rLHN3DKNPMv1lg,"My husband and I had a few meals here. The wait can be long, but that's expected more often than not. The lat night wait staff was cheerful and friendly. They kept our beverages full and overcompensated for the slow food service.

The food was the average cafe fair. We had sandwiches the first night. The fries were cooked to perfection, all were crispy. The fries were not over seasoned or over cooked. The sandwiches, well- it's difficult to mess up a French Dip and Tuna Melt. So no comment there.

The second evening we decided to try our luck again at this Cafe. We had enjoyed the wait staff from the night before so we tried it again. The food was disappointing, the service for dinner was even more disappointing. For the economy being as weak as it claims one would expect the service to go out of their way for tip money. My husband ordered French Toast for dinner. The waitress told him it would be a 30 minute wait. FOR FRENCH TOAST??? He didn't back down. She never checked on us, never topped off our drinks. Gave me a set of filthy cutlery for my steak. 

My husband's French toast was ok, but again, a half hour wait for French Toast is ridiculous. I had the Special- Flat Iron Steak and Fried Shrimp, veggies of the day, and a baked potato. By the time our food was served my shrimp were cold, the baked potato was served to me with absolutely no condiments, the stead was edible but I have had better. The steamed vegetables were slightly harder than baby food. So overall a very disappointing meal.",GOzbWUoHQ0OrCGuf0SUgrw,0,0,2,iwXpBpjJvGr2cl5zNwJH4w
1061468,2014-03-06,1,G9OOkWH5rLHN3DKNPMv1lg,"In terms of late night options the Cafe at Harrah's is better than nothing. I suppose. For any other time of the day I think its best to avoid the place altogether. 

My first trip to the Cafe was after a night of clubbing with the girls. We had worked up an appetite dancing and needed some food after returning to the hotel. Sadly the wait time to get our food was long and the food just wasn't that great. Who ever heard of being drunk and eating bad nachos? Well, I guess there's a first for everything. I went with the chicken nachos and the cheese was overcooked, dried out and over all bland. I'm not one to leave a plate of nachos behind but they weren't even worth totally devouring as drunk food. That says a lot.

My second trip was a solo visit for breakfast before catching my flight. I let the host and my server know that I had a flight to catch but apparently that didn't seem to make a difference for speeding up my tiny French toast stick order. Don't get me wrong, they were tasty but what fried food dunked in syrup wouldn't be? It just made me so angry that my server stopped at another table to drop off their food while holding my French toast sticks. Unless they were trying to catch a flight, I can't see any good reason that my small request for quick service couldn't be accommodated. 

I received a coupon book at check in that had a $5 off voucher which I thought was for the Cafe. It turns out it was just for Flavors, the buffet. I had my coupon sitting out on the table and ready to go the entire time. It would have been nice for them to tell me it wasn't valid there. I'm really hoping they were just that out of it and didn't notice.

In any case, the only reason to eat at the Cafe is if you have absolutely no other options.",OLGQ7alK4VKl3YdQk6UF5g,2,1,2,kGAPvu6SX82Ni2uqY--9bA

There were only two people ahead of us in line so we were seated quickly. After a few minutes someone came to take our drink orders. We were ready to order since we all had our hearts set on the steak and eggs, but the guy would not take our order since he was just in charge of drinks apparently. We also later heard him chewing out a fellow employee. It was loud enough for us to hear even though they were in the back. After a few more minutes a pleasant young waitress came to take our food orders: 7 steak and eggs. It took a long time to get our food. People who came after us got their food first, although I think the size of our group had something to do with that. We got so bored we started playing Keno. Two new employees that we had never seen before brought our food. It was interesting how overstaffed the place seemed compared to the other little coffee shops in Vegas. Still, that didn't mean we got good service. After dropping off the food, the only other employee that came to our table was the waitress dropping off the bill and telling us to pay up front; which was about 2 minutes after getting our food. 

The steak and eggs looked good, but the steaks were so tough. It was actually kind of hard to cut them with steak knives. They went through the effort of sticking the little flag in each steak to indicate how they were cooked, but each one seemed at least medium-well. The eggs, hash browns, and toast were edible though. 

It was actually a good bonding experience in the end. We joked about how horrible our meal was the rest of the trip. I thought that maybe we just had a bad meal or maybe they cut corners on the special, but seeing all the other bad reviews on here, I wonder if maybe they just have no idea what their doing.

It took them 20 min. to get us seated and it's not like anybody was fighting to be seated and it wasn't the most happening place to even be seen for goodness sake. when we finally got seated, the menu seems very enticing... country fried steak with mashed potatoes... salisbury steak, roasted chicken... after a long day of absolutely nothing in our stomach, this was the comfort food we both needed, not knowing what's to come!

So Sandy got the salisbury steak and the waitress stopped her before she even picked her sides to not order that. She said that everything on the menu is good to eat except the salisbury steak. That should have been a red flag to get up and run for dear life. But we were so weak there is no way in hell i could have walked out of there empty stomach after such a long wait! so basically their new recipe for the salisbury steaks contains some mystery meat and red dye. I couldn't stomach what else she was going to say so i zoned out. My boss decided to get the country fried steak and i got the roasted chicken.

Well after 30+ min. of waiting and the place is half empty, this was around 9pm by the way... the food finally came. i was overwhelmed by the size of the food. i literally got half a chicken sitting on my plate and sandy's country fried steak was the size of a belgian waffles. for those who never had belgian waffles.. let's just say... it's HUGE. we thought, wow, for the price it was pretty damn cheap... 

well after waiting for so long to finally eat, i had bypassed the hunger stage and the size of the chicken really didn't sit well for me. the chicken tasted like store bought walmart rotisserie chicken... and til this day, we're still questioning sandy's country fried steak smothered in some mystery gravy. 

overall, it just wasn't appetizing and the service was horrible. we had to wait so long to be seated, then be fed and waited for our water... i feel sick just thinking about it... i will never make a decision to pick a restaurant to ease the hunger on an empty stomach again.",buhQusfhldaAhsemLcF6UQ,2,1,1,AQoUoXWbTn3pZ4kHWJisrw

We got seated a little before 6AM, and we were told we can't get the deal. How annoying!!

There was this nice couple behind us that got out of line since the wait was too long and ended up getting back in it because this place was the only one opened within walking distance.

This place itself is a ripoff and me and the group weren't too hungry and we were planning on sharing. It was like a $2.99 EXTRA PER PERSON TO SHARE. WHAT THE FUCK. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. The waitress was a little bitch too. Just because we are younger than the rest of the crowd, it does not mean we should be treated differently.

We were fed up and ordered to-go. There was a fee for that too. It was to a point where it was like ""Fuck this"" and there wasn't much we could have done since they seated us. My group didn't want to be the rude ones who were seated for a few minutes and stood up and left.

At 6.99, Steak and Eggs never tasted so good. It comes with a side of toast and hash brown. They butter your toast, so I recommend getting your eggs sunny side up and dipping your toast in the yolk. And then, take a huge bite of steak doused in A1 sauce, and cleanse your palate with a big bite of hash browns.

The 24 hour cafe serves up your standard fare.  They have a special breakfast menu from 6 am to 11 am, and then an all day menu.  Posters advertising their lunch specials for $7.77 are what brought us in yesterday morning.  (And I'm sure it brought many others in, as well.)  

When we finally got seated, the breakfast menu was brought out and we asked about their lunch specials.  There were only three options to choose from and they looked far from special.  (I wish the waiter had offered the all day menu to peruse as well.)  There was a steak special that started at 2 pm, and our waiter was quick to tell us he didn't recommend it.

I ended up with the Corned Beef Hash breakfast ($10.99).  It comes with two eggs your way, hash browns, and choice of toast, bagel, or English muffin.  Yes, the corned beef hash was salty and basic.  I was a bit disappointed.

My aunt ordered the Bone-In Ham and Eggs Breakfast ($14.99) and it was a hearty chunk of ham.  She had leftovers.

My other aunt  ordered the Lox and Bagel ($10.99) and it was accompanied by an herb spread, capers, a hard-boiled egg, red onions, and tomato slices.  

The breakfasts took a little while to arrive, which was surprising when our neighbors got their food way before we did.  Our water glasses were rarely refilled, we actually helped ourselves to their makeshift water/OJ station right next to our table. 

We didn't appreciate the extra $1.99 charge for salsa that appeared on our bill.  (Uh, don't they usually tell you when things cost extra?)

Overall, it's expensive and not worth the price.  My mistake was not planning a breakfast/brunch place ahead of time because we would have paid more for better food and better experience.

My friends and I were a bit tired and hungry when we arrived at the hotel and after checking in, we decided to try out the $8.99 steak and shrimp special at the Harrah's Cafe that we heard about online.  

Upon arriving at the Cafe, we were seated quickly (not very crowded around midnight on a Wednesday) and began looking around for some type of sign or section of the menu that mentioned the steak and shrimp deal that we saw online.  We didn't see any mention of it anywhere.  We then waited a good five minutes for our server to come to our table to ask about drinks and take our order.  We thought that 5 minutes was a bit long when the cafe was pretty empty.  We sat around and watched all of the other tables being quickly served and taken care of as we sat for about five minutes being ignored.  We then saw the cause of the wait.  We were lucky enough to be served by the world's slowest waitress.  We waited and waited as she slowly crept closer to our table.  She finally arrived and we inquired about the steak and shrimp special.  She said it did exist and then asked us if we wanted the $3.00 beer with it.  We said sure, not realizing that the $3.00 beer meant we were getting Miller High Life.  We also ordered an order of buffalo wings as an appetizer.  We then sat and sat some more as people who came in far later than us were having their food served to them.  One couple came in after us, ordered, and finished their food before we even got ours.  Well, the food finally came and of course there were no buffalo wings on the serving tray.  As the waitress slowly crept away again, we stopped her and said ""Excuse me, you forgot the buffalo wings we ordered"".  The waitress's response was, ""I thought you ordered onion rings"".  To which we said ""No, but where are the onion rings then?"".  She stood there for a moment and said ""I forgot your wings, I'll place the order now"".  Knowing that it would be another 30 minutes until we got those, we told her to just forget the wings.  We then dug into our steak and shrimp specials.  We ordered what we thought were going to be NY strips cooked medium rare.  What we got were small cuts of (hopefully) NY strips weighing between 4 and 5 ounces at best and completely charred and burned and cooked well well done.  It appeared they took one steak and cut it into three pieces to serve to the three of us.  After scrapping most of the black char off with a knife, we ate the small bits of barely edible meat left over.  The fried shrimp was decent, but not that great.  The only decent thing on the plate was the baked potato and green beans.  

After another long wait, our waitress brought the check and my wife asked for a refill on her Sprite.  The waitress said sure, but we never saw her again.  After waiting another 5 minutes, we just asked a bus boy to please get the Sprite for us.  

A few nights later, I finally did see a mention of the steak and shrimp special, it was on the big marquee billboard on the Strip in front of Harrah's.

If this dish was the only thing I ordered I would have been satisfied. Since I wasn't going to eat lunch I knew I needed a second item. The second item was the breakfast nachos.

I thought since the breakfast nachos included egg, sausage, and bacon I expected an omelette style over the nachos. The egg, sausage, and bacon were diced.

I'm starving and you aren't making it any better. I mean Its 4:30 am and this place ain't exactly hoppin'! I guess I just expected better. The service was kinda bad too. I mean can you refill my water once...please!? You get two stars anyway because it's cheap and what else is one to do at a time like this!!!",YsHcdF2L1HM2boy2d2K7ow,1,1,2,c5V7QLqNia8xqt4UPx3ZPg

....Now I wish we had ventured elsewhere. Food was medicore and took quite a while to arrive. There was nothing special and nothing about this place stood out. It was pretty.....meh. *yawn*

This place would probably only be good if you're drunk. At least everything would taste good to you. You're better off spending your money elsewhere...like at the buffets here. For the price I had to pay here, I won't ever come here again...

I had the oatmeal and the fruit platter. It was surprisingly delicious. Everything was fresh, the oatmeal wasn't dry or clumpy. I was a happy camper.

The seating situation in this place is ridiculous. They ask you if you have a diners card, and if you don't, they show you to something that resembles a cluster of people. You have no idea whose next, where the end of the ""line"" or ""cluster"" is. It's really unorganized. SO unorganized that we actually left, because we were confused. We went to check out the buffet, came back to the Cafe 5 minutes later, there was a new group of people waiting in the cluster, and we skipped them all, because, after all we were waiting before. Nobody noticed anything, nobody said anything we just cut in front of everyone. I'm not complaining but it is what it is, unorganized. 

All in all, good cafe food, a little overpriced, but you're in Vegas.",18cDgNC4Su7NUrghm4COKA,0,0,3,rW-MTZX-8qrF-E8RCTXVzg

Rude, unacceptable service with no apologies. We actually sat there for 10 minutes listening to the servers argue over who was going to wait on us, which nobody did but the manager took our order but forgot to turn it in. Not one apology from anyone. Had to get our own refills, food was cold and terrible.  Avoid it, trust me. They are incompetent.",gtBq_ZmLvmCQoa838ChWUg,3,0,1,fhVtJS4BkpcjwnIjKL5UzQ

the bread pudding (see picture) and coffee is worth a stop if you're just dying to eat SOMETHING. it's cheap and good, and it's not ""real food"" but hey, it's really yummy. you won't regret it.",XpshsCdxZLrEgAfhaciQkQ,0,0,2,7mnMJaitReG1NHyFlVXh7g
