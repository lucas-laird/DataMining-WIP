It's a bonus that Pei Wei has a delicious gluten-free spicy chicken (that you can actually order non-spicy).  I'd recommend getting a side of sweet chili sauce to go with it.


*Also, the gluten free Pei Wei spicy chicken is not a normal menu item at most Pei Wei locations.  This dish is actually the PF Chang's Spicy Chicken dish which is a bonus because I like that dish better than the gluten free sweet and sour chicken dish found at most Pei Wei locations.

They assume that since they are an airport monopoly that they can get away with doing whatever they want to do. If the consumer isn't happy who cares because the odds are slim that most of the consumers will ever return. 
Pei Wei should review their franchise status but that isn't likely. They have a captive audience and probably outsell the average pei wei franchise.

Pros:
It's not your typical crapola airport spot. 
It's not that much over regular Pei Wei prices (everyone airport spot raises prices by 10-20%...travel even fairly regularly and you should expect this)
You don't have to question the meat source like at McDonalds or worse.
Food actually tastes good.  Meat looks like meat, veggies look like veggies.
Well packaged and plenty of napkins provided.

Cons:
It's not $4.
It's not as fast as a shitty fast-food burger.
There isn't adequate waiting space for people, so you feel super awkward and like you're in everyone's way while waiting for your grub.

Wash:
Super salt bomb...3x your daily recommended allotment but good to prompt you to replenish your body's non-alcohol fluid balance.

Taste wise the spicy chicken was OK - your typical Americanized ""Chinese food"" with sweet/spicy sour sauce on the battered chicken + rice/brown rice and sugar snap peas and carrots for $9.99

There are only beef and chicken hot entrees on the menu though - amongst the 8-10 options! You'd think there could at least be a seafood or tofu option too. 

The display says 2 of the chicken dishes can be made ""vegetarian"" but I'm not sure if they'd only serve the rice with the sauce or replace the meat with tofu as well.

There are also chicken salads, wraps, banh mi's and rolls available to grab. I got a spicy tuna roll (6 to 8 pieces) as I wanted to keep it light. It was small and $10, which was more expensive than the hot entrees! 

The beers were also $8/tiny bottle (the menu does not show the price)!

Well that concludes the good news.   The food was mediocre.  I got the teriyaki chicken with brown rice.  The veggies were barely ok, the chicken was as dry as the Sahara desert, and the rice would have had more water content before being cooked.  The massive quantities of sauce could not rectify the problems and instead added to unpleasantness of this meal.

Just make sure you have at least an hour during your layover at this airport as it may take over 10 minutes for your food to arrive.

We ordered the chicken lo mein and kung pao chicken during a 1.5 hour layover in Vegas. This location is perfect when you're traveling on Southwest Airlines between the B and C terminals. There are a few good options between B and C (including Nathan's hot dogs and sandwiches, Wendy's, an Italian place, Starbucks) but this is by far the best as the food is piping hot and fresh.

Portion size was very good for our $10.95 entrees -- a very good value. We could have split one entree to hold us over but enjoyed the two entrees with a little bit of leftovers. 

I wish they had the dan dan noodles at this airport location, but instead they have only over a half dozen entree options (caramel chicken, honey chicken, kung pao, etc) that come with white or brown rice.

Stopped by the airport for a two-hour layover and my friends and I were hungry...the past weekend we had eaten primarily American food, so we were craving Asian food.  Well, Pei Wei Asian diner is the only ""Asian"" option at the airport.

Ordered the Kung Pao Chicken and the total cost was about $10...expensive, especially since the portion is small.  There were a lot of customers there too, and although there are many chefs, it took awhile to get the food out.

However...upon my first bite, I was in trouble.  Peanuts.  I am severely allergic to peanuts, so I accidentally nibbled on a peanut (I was very hungry...didn't look).  I rushed back to the counter and checked the menu to see if they had listed peanuts in the description.  There was no indication of peanuts.  As someone who has a severe peanut allergy, I found this to be disturbing, because there many other people who have more severe peanut allergies, so it could have been much worse.

You may be wondering, ""Why then are you giving Pei Wei a 3 star rating?""  When I brought my food back and told them I couldn't eat the Kung Pao chicken (and told them that it wasn't indicated in the menu description), the manager said no problem to getting me another order of a different menu item without peanuts.

I'm happy to report that Pei Wei Asian Diner met all three of my requirements. Sure, our meals were way over priced, but that's airport dining for ya. The hubs and I grabbed a booth/table combo with an outlet right underneath - perfect for charging our computers before our flight. Service was friendly and the food was pretty good.

You place your order up at the counter then they give you a buzzer to let you know when it's ready. I'd say our food took about 5 minutes to come out. Not too shabby. I got the egg and bacon fried rice which I really enjoyed. It was a large bowl of food. My husband and I honestly could have split it.

While I was there, I didn't see them wipe any tables.  Just customers go, customer sits down.

The top it off, looks like the manager didn't even bother perfecting the receipt.  there's a line that says ""Enter Website Here"" on the 4th line of the receipt.  Manager that cares about details is essential to a business' success.

I ordered the Mongolian beef which included white mushrooms along with the traditional scallions, and I opted for brown rice over white.  I also ordered a pork egg roll.  The Mongolian beef was tasty, and I really liked the texture of the mushrooms, firm but tender.  The pork in the egg roll was ground and not crumbly which made it a lot easier to eat; it was a winner.  For me, this food is on par with PF Chang's - solid but not the most exciting Asian food. 

I ordered my food to go because I had only a short time before boarding and the restaurant was very crowded.  I felt like the wait (10 min or so) was reasonable given how busy it was; the line was 10 people deep when I got in it and it was still at that number when I left. The people I encountered (including a manager who had to fix my slightly bungled order) were polite.  

The seating area is relatively small but it is an airport, and there is a bar and who doesn't live a bar?!

I bumped my review up by a star because if I had seen the overall rating before I decided to eat there I might have skipped Pei Wei and that would have been awful because my experience was not negative in any way.

I did, at one point ask someone if all the items on he menu were available and was told yes, so for those of you who read this : boom! There's your answer. 

:)

I ordered my food with two egg rolls & I checked their drink fountain machine unfortunately they didn't have plain black tea.

The cashier let me know that the grab & go display had tea.

The dining area is self seating & so I did.

The food arrived unexpectedly fast but I was very hungry & happy about it.

Unfortunately, the food was very disappointing.

The fried rice was not good at all. The rice was mushy & I could taste ketchup in the rice. What I did like was the cabbage & sprouts were crunchy.

There was bacon & apple sausage mixed in & they were fine.

My biggest sadness was I anticipated a nice fried egg on top, unfortunately, it's mixed into the fried rice, unless you were to look real closely, you wouldn't think there was egg in it.

I would recommend to the chefs as feedback, stop adding ketchup, put a fried egg on top (its better for presentation), and the rice is way over cooked that it ends up like mush.

The egg rolls were fine but obviously previously frozen.

From the start, the cashier was not engaging and didn't smile. I felt as if I was disturbing her peace & quiet since the restaurant wasn't so busy. 

I even asked for a cup for ice for the expensive Black Tea I bought from the grab & go & she lifted a tiny plastic cup.

Overall, the food was disappointing & I left here with an un-wow experience.

Or at least as far as I could tell when I was looking for some asian soup last Sunday afternoon. Perfect if you had a looong night the night before if you know what I mean ;)

Like most airport food (in the US), this place is just OK. Don't expect anything amazeballs. However, when you are hungry, craving rice and soup, and are on your way home after a short weekend in vegas, this place does the trick, which is why I'm going with a four!

LE MENU:
-Thai Wonton Soup: Nothing really ""Thai"" about it but it was soup with spinach and wontons! Flavorful, but I would caution you to mix it well before you start drinking it. Ours got saltier as we got closer to the bottom of the cup. Oh and their large cup isn't filled all the way to the top so that is kinda misleading. But again, SOUP!
-Fried Rice with Chicken. They gave us a LOT of chicken, so that is a plus if you are hungry I guess. Fried rice wasn't too bad! I was comparing it with panda express and I think I would choose Panda's fried rice over Pei Wei, but overall I was still satisfied.

-lots of juices and beverage options, including gatorade

At first I was pleased to see a Pei Wei in the airport as an option, as I have had pretty good experiences at other Pei Wei locations, but that pleasure quickly changed to disappointment. 

Perhaps it was due to the massive amount of delayed and canceled flights that particular evening, but the line to order was ridiculously long. When I finally did get to order, I was told I had to take my meal 'to go'. This was due to the fact that Pei Wei shares a seating area with a bar, and numerous tables were being used by people with no food, just a laptop and half drank beers. There were even signs by some tables that stated that they were for Pei Wei customers only, but since no one from Pei Wei actually enforced that, the signs were pointless. 

All of this would be forgiven if the food was decent. It's airport food, my expectations weren't very high, and I was still disappointed. My 'Pei Wei Spicy Chicken' meal lacked any form of spice or flavor. The rice was dryer than the desert surrounding Las Vegas. Half my meal went in the trash.

Don't expect anything better than Panda Express from this place. The food's decent by airport standards, and I did like that there was no surcharge for brown rice.

A glass of red wine was $14 each and upon ordering, the lovely bartender said the bottle would be $29. Of course, a no brainer! We ordered a spicy chicken with lo mein and a California Roll.

The chicken and roll were modest at best. The lo mein was just egg noodles, without and seasoning or veggies. The wine was decent. Problem was that we were getting ready to board our flight and not to leave any of the wine behind, we knocked off the bottle.

A bottle of wine for two in 45 minutes. My friend fell asleep upon boarding and during the entire 1 hour flight home.",zwLq4aVDSH7HyMbVjKfkRg,4,4,3,5EV70_170CD_O2r-v4CB2w

Aye aye aye :/ There weren't many people in line and there were 2 people at the cash register... We waited about 20 minutes just to pay for the premade food we took out of the cooler. Everyone in line was incredibly frustrated by the ridiculously slow service. We made it back to our gate just in time to eat before they started boarding the plane. I feel like in an airport, service needs to be very efficient; people may not have a lot of time between flights to wait around.

Anyway, the food: we got a sushi roll ($9.99) and a spicy mango chicken wrap (I think it was $7.99). The sushi was definitely overpriced - I would normally pay about $6 for a roll like this at the sushi counter in a grocery store. It did taste fresh and was slightly better than I expected for the airport. The mango chicken wrap was really good, healthy, and filling. Again, I felt it was overpriced but that is to be expected when traveling.

Pei Wei is an off-shoot of PF Chang. The menu items sounded delicious but we did not have time to place an order and then wait even longer for food. If I have the time, I would stop here and give them another chance.",NpZ6hMBncbIvAo4btwrvZQ,0,0,2,JODRtvLP0td8i7NUg_BE0g

From now on, I will be saying, ""No way, I don't want Pei Wei (pronounced ""Pay Way"")!"" 

I have tried a Pei Wei retail establishment in Columbia, MD, and the food back then was just as bad as the food at Pei Wei Asian Diner at McCarran International Airport.

Why Pei Wei in Las Vegas?  My travel companion wanted Asian, and it was the closest place to our gate at the airport...  We both got steak fried rice, and she ordered an additional entrée for her boyfriend.

$9.69 Fried Rice
$1.00 Steak Add-on
$0.87 Tax

So...  Speckle of shredded carrots, couple of baby pieces of uncooked broccoli, bits of other vegetable here and there, and very bland, uncooked rice with slices of steak in a to-go container...

Otherwise, this place is sufficient for when you're at the airport and you tire of the same old fast food, Italian, or Mexican options.
