called the 800 # they started to insert answers that i didn't answer because i wanted them to repeat because i didn't thing any of the prompts actually answered the problem i was calling about. so i hung up and and called back they phone stated i already called and wouldn't take my call this seems very shady more than likely this is my last visit to panda express. my 9 year old is very upset",V6pG6YJhyueRGlGyKYnjxw,0,0,1,GZDeAqmCVwVchw9EsT6w-w

2222991,2011-06-30,1,UED302E-B2OyVr0mssARnA,"Before a few more fast food options popped up here in the barren southwest, Panda Express was a place we sometimes ended up when too tired to cook or drive far. My husband always tried different items, and I had the spring rolls and cream cheese wontons (no crab meat in these) once. (Then I read on Panda's website that these are fried with meat products. Duh, I know. Kudos to Panda Express for being so forthcoming, though.)

Mike would usually end each meal with, ""Never again."" Not because the food was terrible, but just because it is fast food, and once that distracting roar of ""Feed Me!"" is silenced, you think, ""Was I really so tired I couldn't make a sandwich? Something less greasy? Tastier?"" The talk of a full tummy, of course, one that has forgotten how good hot, crispy food from anywhere made by other people sounded an hour before.

I have to give this particular Panda Express an A-OK rating, though. One, the interior is always spotless. Two, the staff has always been so friendly and helpful. They are quick to suggest to cheapest way to set up your order, they're patient with slow orderers, and the time I got the wontons, they suggested I wait a few minutes to get something fresher than what was already in the tray.  

Also, they close at closing time. It sounds obvious, but if you go in 30 minutes before closing, you will get food. Try that at some other fast food places in this area (especially an unnamed one a few doors down), and you'll be told it's clean-up time. To me, the hours on a restaurant's door - especially a fast food place - are for the customer, not the cleaning crew... something that's particularly important when you may only be there because all of the ""good"" places are closed.",l9YOhaPYvTJi_qfD3Y-wBQ,3,1,3,QumY1cqW3fzaIm-LSNhKzg

    We had all order a 3 item combo and o even told the young lady 2 times our item request.  My efforts were in vain as she still managed to mess up our order.

4806737,2018-02-22,0,UED302E-B2OyVr0mssARnA,"I love this location. I come here when my craving for sweet fire chicken and orange chicken gets far too strong to ignore. My kids love the fried rice and chow mein and can usually slam a 2 entree (sometimes 3) leaving us with scraps. Now tat they're older they eat so much more. So I have to usually order the 3 entree option. 

I love the walnut shrimp, Beijing beef, beef & broccoli, orange chicken, egg rolls, fortune cookies and most importantly the service. I'm lucky enough to have the manager Dejah ring me up this visit and my last. I was honestly hoping she would be here today because I remember my last visit was so memorable. I sampled everything (or so it felt) until I found something new to indulge in. It was fairly slow last visit so it was nice getting one on one time and hearing her recommendations. 

Dejah is definitely doing the customer service thing above and beyond! She's the type of gal to stop mid-order to say 'Bless You!' To another patron! I am ALL FOR MANNERS!! she's definitely another reason I come to this location. She's taking orders, keeping the chefs in the loop, cleaning the dining room and getting to know her guests. I know she's leading her team to greatness. Hopefully she sees this and it brightens her day like she did mine.",7L8utEpYiVj3pNNjZkQaLQ,1,0,5,S8e6922UYetbImwZOiS31w

I usually have no issues, but if it hits 9pm (an hour before close), they refuse to make eggplant tofu. I have issues digesting meat, so I can't have any of their other dishes, and even telling them that, they refuse to make even a personal portion. I'm so disappointed.",4TdNI6N88Wl9KITJehSQbg,0,0,2,Ly5Q3XmOKUFtOeQX2Rl4CQ

The person in a black shirt, I'm assuming is the manager was standing right next to the cashier and didn't say a word. The cashier then proceeded to go into the lobby clean the counter and soda area and go right back to handling food without washing her hands. Good job Panda Express.",jlFTiLasJedHTCkAMwnGgw,0,0,1,IBslg3VHjiHQC1hxePKGOQ

Best items here I think are: walnut shrimp ($1 more), string bean chicken and eggplant. I always opt for noodles because their rice is so dry...but even the noodles are not the greatest...but again it's fast and decent.  I like that they have the peach diet green tea....kids meal is not worth it, might as well get a 1 item combo for just a little more. No prize or dessert....don't bother. I don't recommend drive thru either they skimp in servings. All in all it's OK....at least no msg.",zzPvEodjvLPe-5NvV0U_cg,1,0,3,hAMOeGeqif4PVecax9GiIA

After we paid for our 4 combo plates we were told that we would have to wait for our pot stickers and beef.  Paid and sat down. 15 minutes went by and our food was not ready yet (waiting on broccoli beef and pot stickers). We eventually got our food and began eating (without our broccoli beef and pot stickers). We were almost done and our food still did not arrive. So I went to the front of the line and got my order of broccoli beef, the cashier told me to have a seat and that she would bring me our pot stickers. Another 10 minutes pass and have
