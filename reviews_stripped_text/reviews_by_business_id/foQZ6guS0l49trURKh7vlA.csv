I came here for dinner with my friends and the food was good. Hostess was welcoming. Table server was friendly. Recommend the appetizer tower and the HUGE Double Barrel Burger.  
However, after dinner we decided to stop by the bar and there was a girl and guy bartender. The girl was nice, blond, smiled at everyone. Unfortunately, we sat on the blond guy's section, he only waited on girls that came by and joked around with his bartender coworker. When we asked for a drink it seemed like it was a drag for him to take our order. Who's hired at this place? If you think your muscles are above everyone, go work at a Gold's Gym buddy, you're nothing special. Not coming here again.

Fantastic setting just on the strip, great outdoor seating area and a great looking vibe was what drew my girlfriend and I into Double Barrel. We were on the hunt for a quick drink and snack, so we decided to give it a shot.

Initially, we were greeted by a very pleasant blonde girl who welcomed us in and sorted us with a table, she was accommodating and got us one in the shade as requested. Had she been our server, this review may have merited a higher score.

Unfortunately, we were served by another guy (I believe someone referred to him as Bill, tall guy with dark hair) who was anything but pleasant. He wanted us in and out as quickly as possible. I was still looking at the drinks menu and he stood and loomed over me looking angry until I eventually settled on something I didn't even want because I felt so uncomfortable. Then, we decided to order food. At this point, the establishment really earned its 2 star review. I asked 'Bill' if it would be possible to get the sour cream and pico de gallo toppings on the side as I'm not a massive fan of either, but my girlfriend likes them. A fairly standard request I assumed. At this point I was told no as ""the kitchen doesn't like to do that"" or something to that effect. Probably the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. I've literally never experienced this anywhere else. After this, 'Bill' delivered our nachos about 10 minutes later and they were underwhelming at best. They tasted microwaved and the cheese had the consistency of rubber. The chicken was sparse and for $17, I expected a hell of a lot better. At no point did anyone bother to check in with us to ask how the food was or if we would like another drink. 'Bill' eventually brought the check over and we settled up and left.

All in all a poor experience. The only reason for 2 stars rather than one would be the beer selection is good, if extortionate ($8 for a bottle of Dos Equis is daylight robbery).",DPMAVq-zzAch1ndRPxHqkA,0,0,2,ABwq9PBN10Z7uBZDQq19lw

The Roadhouse is right outside the doors of the hotel so we figure we'll give it a try. We wanted to eat light so we ordered 4 appetizers for a party of 6 and we each started off with a beer.

The pulled pork sliders for $12 were two White Castle sized sandwiches (I know... that's what sliders are but only  2 for $12?1?! They were ok.

Next was the pulled pork and beef nachos for $19. Our server told us it was a huge portion. Not even close., they were were served in a 6""x4"" casserole dish, I don't know where that classifies as huge. Anyway, not bad tasting overall but some of the meat was a little hard, as in dried out and old kind of hard. 

The third appetizer was the grilled chicken nachos for $17 . Not very good at all. Served in the same mini dish.

The last was smoked chicken wings for $15. All 6 of them had a nice smoky flavor that was unfortunately destroyed by drowning them in straight up Franks Hot Sauce.

The finish off the night before we were done with our first beer they called last call.

I liked the cornbread muffin, it had corn mixed into the batter...nice chewy touch...but they are not worth $4 for two. You get one with your meal...no butter offered, just the muffin. It is moist, but legit cornbread is served warm so it goes with butter. The coleslaw...no way, it was soggy, watery and had zero flavor...it tasted like it had been stored open in the fridge after being left at room temperature too long.

The ambience is super, but the food is a 5 out of 10 for me. Upgrades would be those mentioned already, and a variety of BBQ sauces (sweet, spicy, tangy). Maybe a vinegar based Cole slaw, too...the cream based one is not impressive. By comparison Famous Dave's BBQ may not be as upscale and doesn't lend itself to the sports crowd...but the food is lights out better and they offer combinations which let you explore the variety of offerings.

He made the atmosphere so much fun and please don't come for me for saying this but he made the experience more much Vegas-ey. About 4 hurricanes and 6 shots later we retreated to our next bar.

We went in around 6pm the last week of March 2016 and the restaurant was pretty slow. We ordered our food (BBQ half rack of ribs and BBQ chicken breast) and the food literally came out in 6 mins from our order. How do you cook these items in 6 mins?? The food came out luke warm and not at all tasty. The food was definitely pre-made and just warmed up upon order. I would spend a little extra money and go somewhere that will serve you freshly cooked food.,bLskTaK_sLIGnlKpLS1e0Q,0,0,2,yBq8ux4JxFfaN3U_RMVF-A

586839,2017-02-02,0,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"Service was bad. Food was good but expensive for what it was.

First I have to state this is a visit from a trip several months ago. I left here really irritated... told myself I would wait and probably not write a review but im still irritated about the service. We go to LV twice a year for 4 days and really go after the food there.

We decided to go here because the menu looked awesome, we love bbq regardless of how authentic and we were staying at the hotel. I am pretty picky for starters so I always scope out a menu and make sure I read the full descriptions of anything I order so there are no surprises.

I ordered the brisket sandwich I want to say it was around $20 but it sounded awesome. When I got it I checked it and there was mayo all over it. I tried to stop the waiter and tell him I didn't see mayo listed on the menu when I ordered it, showing him my sandwich. He said its queso and kept walking. He didn't come back for awhile. I sat there wondering what kind of queso is this? Why would they put queso on a brisket sandwich? And then finally this obviously isn't queso... did he even look? He finally came back awhile later after I had been sitting there and hadn't touched my sandwich. I had to level with him and say look this isn't queso, this time I actually got him to look at it. He took the food and came back to say that the chef had just started adding garlic mayo to it and that is why it wasn't on the menu. He brought me another one a little bit after that, nothing more to it, no apology or anything off the bill. That whole ordeal took a long time... then after we were about 3/4 through our meal my girlfriend went to the bathroom a bus boy came over and in 1 motion picked up our plates, said all done here and walked away. It definitely was not a question. When she got back from the bathroom she asked wheres our food...

This is the only restaurant I will not go back to because of the service.",XgOe6y0S1BWF-PyNp82OVA,0,0,1,lZftMUvYjUjH9HphJeUspw

625220,2016-04-30,0,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"Looked like a cool place with good atmosphere.  Started off by waiting for a seat on the patio because we had seen the sign that said Happy Hour on the Patio 5-7pm.  There were many open tables on the patio but had to wait because there was only one waitress.  Once seated I ask what drinks are part of happy hour and waitress said that's at the bar inside only not the patio.  I walk over to hostess and turned around the sign for her and pointed toward where I was sitting and asked is where I'm sitting considered the patio and she said yes.  Then I asked why does the sign say happy hour on the patio 5-7pm and she only apologized but could not explain why.  Ok so I'm over that part now we order. I had brisket and sweet potato fries and my wife had pulled pork sandwich.   The brisket was a few slices that look like it came from a swanson TV dinner (if you remember those) and was the worst brisket I had ever had. Plus it was 24 bucks.  The pulled pork was dry and bland.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars was that the sweet potato fries were awesome and the waitress looked like Jessica Biel.    One last thing.   A couple of ladies were seated near us but got up and left when waitress said happy hour is NOT on the patio.  Their web site even has happy hour from 3-7pm on the patio.  Look it up if you don't believe me.

1042951,2016-04-20,0,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"I went out to dinner this past Saturday night and we all decided to go to Double Barrel. A few of us had been past the restaurant many times and it smelled of delicious barbecue. We got to the restaurant around 6:30 and they told us it would be around a thirty minutes to get a table for six. We weren't able to have our party of six sit outside together due to code. In the mean time we had drinks at the outside bar. Not that familiar with the bar, we ordered beer and margaritas. Without asking rocks, with salt, etc. slushy margaritas were sitting in front of us AND with no salt. Not the service we expected at a nicer strip restaurant. It was around fifty minutes later that we actually sat at the table. We ordered appetizers and dinner. (Hot wing tower with garlic fries was amazing.) The rest of us ordered ribs, brisket and pulled pork. Pulled pork was by far the best. Brisket was only mildly smokey and very, very tough. Ribs were mediocre and tough as well. Definitely not fall off the bone barbecue deliciousness. 

Bottom line, if you want barbecue, don't go to Double Barrel. If you want appetizers and expensive drinks, it's your place

Customer service was decent. Although with a party of six they tacked on automatic gratuity. The waitress failed to mention this AT ALL. I wish I could take back my tip just because of this. Like a lot of Vegas restaurants they prey on drunk tourists. I wish though, seeing that we were locals, the waitress would have been a little more courteous and informed us of their tipping policy.

If you are looking for amazing brisket and ribs, try Fox's BBQ in Boulder City. (Their pork isn't very good.) If you want good pulled pork. Try it Memphis style at Lucille's BBQ in Henderson.",vCP7Uf2F7LwA6bg2H08GxQ,1,2,1,TU53adBbdyN4RjNTn8-fHg

I'll even go one further to say an upscale sports bar with a country twist. Double Barrel has all the offerings of a bar, plus a country style restaurant and PLENTY of tvs to catch your teams playing on. 

I've been to Double Barrel twice but most recently for a company team outing. I will say this up front, the menu is a little more pricey than I would expect - however you do get what you pay for (quality). If you're on a budget, skip DB for now. 

Service was good, our server checked on us often and made sure that we were taken care of. I got to try the sliders, wings and nacho appetizers. The nachos were OK, but those sliders and wings? SENSATIONAL. We ordered the bbq wings and they had the perfect amount of crisp and the sauce to wing ratio was spot on. They tasted fresh off of a grill. How can I think this? Because a few days prior I had wings that were fresh off a grill. The sliders were ALMOST as good as the wings... there was a bit more bread involved than I would have liked... I don't particularly enjoy when the bun swallows the burger.. but they were still really tasty. 

For my entree I had the Apple wood Bacon & Salmon Sammie... SO FILLING BUT SO GOOD! I could not finish it, but I really wanted to. I did not see that the garlic aoli (at least it looked like that?) came on the sandwich, so I ended up wiping that off as much as I could... whatever was left though complimented the salmon... so maybe next time I will leave it be. The bacon was cooked with brown sugar or maple syrup one... either way, super delicious. I also had the garlic fries as a side and I felt that they complimented the sandwich well. 

If you find yourself on the south end of the strip looking for a filling lunch or dinner, look no further - Double Barrel to the rescue!

First, about that service. If you've been to Vegas you know how much water is required to feel normal even if you have not a drop of booze. The desert, yo! They kept my water glass full at all times, and I was so grateful. Keeping the water coming is one of my service markers, but it's something I've learned to pretty much give up on in Vegas. They were SO good about it here, we couldn't thank the server enough. He was working hard to keep all our glasses full and we all really appreciated it and told him so. Seriously, the water pitcher came by every few minutes. We were blown away (made my dehydration headache disappear!). Our other server was a doll: attentive, friendly, genuinely warm without the Vegas 'tude that seems so ubiquitous. 

The food was okay. It was a set menu, as I said, and we had smoked chicken lettuce wraps (a little dry, but tasty!), smoked chicken cobb salad (okay! Would be a decent healthy-ish Vegas option for a main), BBQ chicken (okay, but not great. A bit dry, and I think there was cumin in the rub which is not my jam), garlicky fresh green beans (good!), and creeeeamy dreamy mac & cheese (GOOOOOD. Still thinking about it.). Oh, and cornbread (Okay. Sweet, tasted oddly like a blueberry muffin without the blueberries. I know that sounds weird but when I said it to my friends they were all like 'yes! that's it!'). One of the vegetarians in the group had a veggie burger and when I asked her how it was she said ""Eh. It's a veggie burger."". The fries looked good though ;)

Appetizer- Had the burnt ends, never had any brisket that tasted this poor- but I'm from Texas. It was pretty much cubed pieces of mostly fat brisket appeared to be pan-charred. 
The nachos were huge, sadly didn't live up to the hype. 1st, throwing shredded cheese on top of chips and melting it does not make it nachos. Again, these contained the questionable ""brisket"" mentioned earlier. The rest of the toppings were decent, but these overall missed the mark
Entrée-  The fried chicken was mostly fried batter which had very little flavor. You get 3 pieces that were in between the size of a wing and a thigh. The cornbread roll was good, as were the garlic fries. 
Waiter- this guy was almost non-existent! It was a weeknight and it wasn't crowded. There were plenty of waiters, so we weren't sure what the issue was. I know nobody's perfect, so we tried not to let this influence our opinion too much.  
Overall, wish we had gone somewhere else. Our time here is limited, and it's always disappointing to feel like you wasted what could've been a good time.",q_kz1mmG_uEQcatHEvf58A,0,0,2,NQqj04AdOiprKGStggb1Ww

Double Barrel Roadhouse was fairly good in kind of fulfilling that void for me. Had some very good BBQ chicken, along with some mac n cheese and a beer. Very good eats. Very friendly service. The top of the mac n cheese was a little too crunchy, which in most cases I really do like the crunchiness if baked to perfection, this however was kind of a ehh crunchy but still very cheesy and flavored well so didn't overly mind.

We stopped in one afternoon to try them out.  Since it was a nice Vegas day, we sat on the patio to enjoy the sun.  It's a nice view of the strip while people watching.  Our service here was great.  Greeted immediately, drinks always filled and fun personality.  

We ordered the loaded nachos with wood grilled chicken to share. Trust me when I say there are more than enough for two. The nachos are topped with avocado cream, jalapeños, sour cream and cotija cheese.  Absolutely delicious.  The chicken had a great smokey flavor along with their well seasoned nacho chips. I'd definitely order these again.  

We also split the Stacked BBQ Burger.  Meat on top of meat? Sure!  BBQ brisket on top of angus, onions, cheddar and sauce. With the great smoked meat, it gives this burger a little something extra.  

It was an excellent meal all around.   Plus with the Yelp check in discount of 20%, I was definitely pleased.",xhhE0txKwQtRzgQVVdKkvg,4,9,5,d97Nlf4OIN0P3Bivx1jnNg

1674929,2014-08-05,0,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"So this was our first experience here.  We were looking for something casual and down to earth to take a break from all the celebrity chef and high-priced stuffier places.   We came across the Double Barrel while waiting for the Blue Man Group show. 

First the wait.  We waited fifteen minutes for a table for two.  The hostess told us up front about the wait and said we could go sit in the bar area if we didn't want to wait because the full menu was available.   We chose to wait.  There were empty tables in the restaurant while we waited but might have been part of the bar seating.  Either way, we didn't mind waiting and the staff was up front about it. 

Once we sat down, the service was very slow.  Our server came up to our table as soon as we sat down and asked if we wanted to place our entire order for drinks and food because it was going to take a while.   We weren't ready to order yet, so we waited until she came back a few minutes and placed our order.   Turns out the server was right.  It took a long time for our food to come out.  Well over thirty minutes.   Once we had finished eating, it took another twenty minutes to get our plates cleared and to get the check.  Overall, very slow for a place of this style.  It looked like they might have been understaffed.  The server was working really hard but she had way too many tables.   Needed at least two more servers. 

The food we ordered all tasted good.  However, for what we ordered the price was way too high and the portions to small for two of the three items.   We ordered the baked BBQ oysters, the pulled pork sliders,  and the garlic fries.  The garlic fries were delicious, the portion was good for two people to share,  and the price was right.  The pork sliders were also delicious, but over priced.  $12 for two small sliders is a bit much.   Lastly, the baked BBQ oysters.  

To say I was disappointed would be an understatement.  The portion size is four tiny oysters.  To give you a reference to the size, there was a small piece of bacon on top of each oyster.  The total amount of bacon was less than that of one average strip.  There was less oyster meat than bacon.  Bacon is amazing, but when you're ordering oysters, you don't want the bacon to compliment the oysters, not overpower them.  Third component of this dish, the BBQ sauce tasted good, but there was too much.  In one shell, I couldn't find the oyster in the sauce, even after I removed the piece of bacon.  So yeah, for $12 paid for this dish, I was really disappointed.  Save your money on this one and order something else. 

Some of the other dishes that I saw people ordering looked substantial and good, but again, overpriced.  $17 for a basic cheeseburger is a bit much.  And while I understand that this is Vegas and things are more expensive, but for a casual place like this, these were a bit too high. 

To summarize, the food tasted good but the portions were too small for the price paid on the appetizer and main dish and the service was way too slow because they appeared to be understaffed. 

I would probably go back again because I never write a place off after just one visit, but I won't be back soon until they can work out the kinks.",wgCQw_Ha-vlWZ234F000hg,2,1,2,InilFJ7sV33OBxYu90syDQ

A California ID with FEDERAL RESTRICTIONS means that a person that has this ID cannot enter any FEDERAL BUILDING or use it as a form of ID to TRAVEL at an AIRPORT.
So since the IDIOTS at the door dont know the LAW on this form of GOVERNMENT ISUUED IDENTIFICATION, they use their power trip to deny certain CA ids entry to their establishment.
I was upset at the moment, but im glad I was made aware of their bullshit, racist policy.
The place was pretty much empty and the dumbfucks were blasting mexican music but they dont want Mexicans in there!
Just another P.O.S crap bar that will be closed after awhile.

Ohh! The ribs were so tender and soft and tasted Super good! For that alone...I give them 5 stars...Though the waitress needs more training..

1995428,2016-12-26,2,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"Before heading back home from Vegas, we decided we needed something that wasn't airport food. We came across Double Barrel and decided to try it out.

The inside is cute and definitely sticks to the southern and.... barrel.... theme. Their whole back wall is covered in a barrel print wallpaper (can they not just get real barrels? the world may never know) and they have cute wooden plank walls as well. One thing that I noticed is that during the warmer months, the whole front of the place has the ability to open up out into the strip and there is patio seating. 

If you're not a fan of birds, don't come here. There were three little birds that had flown in during our stay and I noticed a couple of older women getting very annoyed trying to swat them away. They really don't do anything but chill on the ground, but I know some people are weird about that shit and may not be okay with birds being in there.

On to the dranks. We all ended up getting Bloody Mary's because we weren't feeling one hundred percent - but I mean it's Vegas, so that's normal, right? The Bloody Mary's were definitely unlike any other I've ever had before. They were spicy as SHIT! And no, that's not the Caucasian in me talking. My fiance and his southern friend were both blown away at how spicy they make their Bloody Mary's too. After you get past the initial shock they're delicious and drinkable. But, be ready for a kick in the pants.

I wasn't too terribly hungry when we came here so I tried to order the Cowboy Chili and they DIDN'T HAVE ANY. I was pretty sad because it sounded bomb. I ended up with going with a side of their mac n' cheese which turned out to be a great second choice. That mac n' cheese was SERIOUS mac n' cheese. Bread crumbs on top, creamy, rich cheese all throughout the dish... The whole nine yards, right there in a small ceramic pan. 

Just based off of the mac n' cheese I'd come back. So if you want some fire mac n' cheese and a spicy ass Bloody Mary, these guys have got your back.",lrSlArehU8XqQlRNPQ7dbQ,3,2,4,adq82U2GlW3frCABz_IquQ

The final kick to the taint for us came when the 3 skins showed up the size of red breakfast potatoes.

During our last trip in March 2015 I went and say at the bar with two other friends. Bartender was friendly but didn't know the menu, that's always frustrating. Prior to sitting down I ask the hostess if they accepted the MGM resort gift card that I had and she said yes. I then asked the bartender who was serving me and got a yes. So we ordered, most of our favorite items had been taken off the menu, oh well, stuff like that happens. Service was slow, food took forever, wings were way undercooked and gross. Okay, they were having a bad night. Then the bill comes, I put the MGM resort gift card in the presenter. Bartender can't figure out how to use it. Ask another server, she can't. They call the manager who can't figure it out. By now we had waited over 30 minutes and had plans we were running late to. The manager was completely rude and not nice. Didn't offer further assistance or anything. I think just being nice and sympathetic would have been a requirement in her position. Finally I just paid with my credit card and left. I called later to speak to a different manger and I guess that huge place only has one manager on during a busy night. I left my number to have someone else call me. A week later after i returned home the GM called me, apologized and offered me two free drinks. Cool, send them to California dude. I can't believe this place treats customers the way they do.

I had checked in on yelp and saw that there was (I believe) a 10% discount coupon for checking in.  I showed the waitress who said great, no problem and then I proceeded to move on with ordering the drinks and bacon.

The drinks took a weird amount of time to come out considering there were only 3 other small groups in the bar (and it's a large bar) so we thought things would come out quickly.  They didn't about 15 minute wait.

Anyway, the drinks were just OK, nothing amazing but like I said above, the candied bacon was amazing.

When it came time for the check I stupidly just laid my card down and didn't check the total and found out afterwards that my 10% discount wasn't applied. Whatever, my fault - but I wish the waitress would have put the discount in at the beginning when she saw we had it.

Fries are A-OK and nothing special. No garlic fries which is a bummer. I didn't have the tea but my co-worker said it was pretty good. He also said the BBQ sliders were great.

If you're wandering in the area and hungry for a bite, I think this is a good choice. I would come for the burger and to catch a game but it was pretty crowded that day. If you don't mind a crowd, then it's a good choice.",De-dImXf-TOFWWPTUWwIvw,5,1,4,0UNLRZS1Wxe-zUPhXNAm5Q

When we walked up to be seated, there was a group of 4 guys who were inebriated beyond belief sitting at the first table as you enter.  One of the guys looked my mother straight in face and yelled ""my pussy"" to her.  I then proceeded to tell the guy to shut the hell up. The hostess seemed very annoyed by this guy and apologized to us. Trust me, I understand its vegas and it happens, but the restaurant should be responsible enough to make sure their patrons feel comfortable.  That should of been our first clue to leave.  We were seated and it took over 10 mins to have our drink orders taken.  I ordered a salad and added shrimp which was good.  My husband ordered a burger and said it was average and my mother ordered the salmon sandwich which made her sick later that day and the next day.  While waiting for our food, there was a huge crowd of people on the patio getting drinks and name tags.  We asked what they were doing and they said a ""bar crawl"" was starting there.  It was annoying to me that this was going on as it seemed all the attention was going to this group and they were not even eating.  People in the group were coming in and taking tables that others were waiting for.  It just seemed like a real cluster.  Now lets go back to our drunk group of guys who were sitting by the hostess stand.  They proceeded to bother more people as walking in and made passes at girls.  Come to find out, they were apart of the bar crawl and should not of even been sitting where they were.  Management should of taken care of moving these guys outside where they would not bother their patrons.  The guy who yelled ""my pussy"" to my mom later proceed to go behind the bar outside and pour himself a shot, all while the bartenders were no where to be found. Again, I understand this is vegas and things like this happen, but you should not be subject to this while paying to have a meal.  I guarantee you if this happened inside Monte Carlo, they would be long gone.  Not sure why Double Barrel supports this type of behavior.

The place was packed!  We are bar people so we easily found a couple of seats at the lower bar.  Tip: Go a couple of steps up past the lower bar and you will find a mirrored version of the lower bar on the backside.  The bar tender acknowledged us almost immediately asking if we were there for drinks, food or both.  We placed our drink order, not expecting to get our drinks for awhile because of how busy they were, within a few minutes we had our drinks and we placed our food order.

The drinks were excellent.  The food also came out quicker than expected and was very good bar food.  The bartender regularly checked on us throughout the evening to ensure our glasses stayed full.  At the end of the evening we placed a to-go order of chips and guacamole for a late night snack.  This was taking a little longer than our bartender liked (they make the fresh guacamole per order) so he personally went back to the kitchen to get our order.

The pork sliders and vodka martinis were both very good!  The guacamole was excellent.

Sat quickly and waited 15 minutes for the waitress to come by. She seemed frazzled but the place was not packed. I felt bad thinking maybe she was new. Still stopping by and getting a drink order shouldn't take this long

Ordered the Buffalo boneless wings as an app. They were awful.  Not sure how this is possible but every little nugget I touched, the coating and sauce fell off. It's like they took chicken nuggets and wrapped them with little Buffalo tear away jerseys. Just terrible. 

Next was the brisket dinner. Holy mother of all things smoky. This was the absolute worst brisket I have ever had. It's like they smoked a brisket, sliced it and then laid each slice under a broiler for 20 minutes. Literally the slices were hard, not just the edges but the whole slice. I tried a little bit of each slice but couldn't eat it. Absolutely terrible. 

The side was creamed corn. Lordy there is no way they can mess up creamed corn, right?  The recipe is literally take corn and cream it. Guess what..... it was disgusting and I couldn't swallow more than one bite. 

This place is at the Aria end of the strip. You will be tempted because you can get there without a 30 minute walk on the strip. Don't do it. You are better off going to the cvs next door and buying year old slim jims, rolling them in the street and then eating them. Same thing!

My husband and I stayed Tuesday through Thursday to avoid crowds and save money, The Strip is very populated every day of the week though so I was hoping for a pleasant experience either way. We were seated promptly by a friendly hostess even though they appeared quite busy. She asked if the patio would be okay which I informed her it would and we were seated right up against the railing on the strip for a nice view and some people watching which made for a nice Vegas dinner experience.

We had pulled pork sandwiches topped with coleslaw, with fries and I subed fries for garlic mashed potatoes and my husband and I split the sides. The waitress was very nice and greeted us with a smile, she was attentive and although had many tables, was good about checking on us for refills a couple times as well as to see how our food was after we received it. We got our drinks in about 5 minutes and the food in about 15 to 20.

Pulled pork was pretty good, not incredible, but good, fries were thick, hot and cooked perfectly, mashed potatoes had a nice flavor and were piping hot. They gave us sizeable portions of both. 

Drinks, were well made, a little on the weak side, but tasty at least, just wish they weren't $16 a piece, but everything on the strip is outlandish pricewise so it is somewhat expected that you'll pay an insane amount for cocktails. 

Overall, we had a lovely dinner experience and were in an out in about 1 hour. I would go back if it is not overly crowded and I think a week night may help with the service times, weekends on the strip tend to be a little crazy.",NPsH7vxMdw5wI89SvultUg,3,1,4,_3YmaR23M1NDLW0ORhZtJA

In the past decade or so, some shrewd restaurateurs figured out that bar-food didn't always have to be crap
This created the concept of the Gastro-Pub, which is essentially artisanal beer and liquor combined with high-end cuisine.

Well, the guys at Double Barrel didn't get that memo...because the food here is dreadful.

I had the BBQ ribs and my friend had the chicken-fried steak. Both came out 5 minutes after we ordered them, which means they were prepared well-in-advance and were waiting patiently under heat-lamps to be called upon. 
Nice.

On top of that, the place is located right on the strip at the front of the Monte Carlo casino, which requires a 10 minute walk from the parking lot through the casino, to the hostess stand.

The Chilled Spinach Salad was just a bowl of spinach with just enough toppings to keep it mildly interesting. Blackberries, which served as the seasonal fruit, and salty Manchego cheese went nicely with the earthy spinach and tangy white balsamic dressing kept it lively. 

The sliders of the Mini Mac were really tasty-- something about that potato bun and special sauce. They were hearty enough to really fill you up. And the fries were spicy and seasoned, crisp and crave-worthy. 

The pig candy, bacon with sweet and spicy elements, was so layered with different flavors that somehow it totally worked. Super yum.

Unfortunately we couldn't reserve a table using OpenTable, even though it was available in the search. Maybe that feature is coming, or blocked on weekends...?

There were girls in front of the restaurant passing out drink coupons - buy one, get one for $3. This applied to the 32oz beers (value!) We also had bogo entrees which helped with the bill, but even if we didn't, I would suggest sharing entrees. They are ridiculously big!

4163712,2018-03-01,0,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"Oh, where to start... So, my friends were coming into town for a birthday. We made reservations at Double Barrel Roadhouse on OpenTable for the special occasion. They were able to accommodate our party of eight, which was good. There was also a gentleman outside, who was passing out a 2-for-1 drink deal coupon for the restaurant. So, we picked up a few of those to use for the night.

We ordered our drinks. Everything seemed to have been going fine until the meals came out. 

Three of us ordered steaks. $40 a pop. We ordered them in three different temperatures: rare, medium rare, and medium. However, they didn't come out at all like they were supposed to. My rare steak was more like medium rare, and the other two were fully well-done. The steak was okay, but not worth the price, even by Strip standards. The birthday boy and my other friend sent their steaks back. It eventually came out tolerable. 

My boyfriend ordered the burger. It was supposed to be served with a fried egg and bacon on it. However, when it came out from the kitchen, there was no egg to be found, and the bacon was burnt to a crisp, literally. Like, it was blackened. I like my bacon crispy, but the strips were almost unrecognizable. He told the food runner, who then brought him out a plate with a fried egg on it. Eventually, the manager took the entire burger back to be remade. 

My friend's dad also had extremely burnt bacon. But, being the sweet old man that he is, he didn't complain about it. 

My other friend ordered the chicken and waffles, which he said were very good. It was the only meal that was positively reviewed by our table. One out of eight. A restaurant has got to do better than that, especially one in a 4-star hotel.

The manager was nice in the ordeal. He comped a round of our drinks, however, I believe they were supposed to be comped anyway because of the coupons. My comped drink also came out 3/4 full. Like, what? It is too much to fill 'er up? I feel like they could have done a little more since more than half of our meals were entirely unsatisfactory. He also didn't come back to check on us after the first time.

They also forgot to bring refills, appropriate silverware, plating, and so on. Normally, I wouldn't really care about all that, but on top of everything else... it was extremely disappointing. 

So, our server was polite and managed to remedy the situations that arose. However, we were not happy with the way he handled our check situation. On one of the tabs, my friends' bill amounted to $85 (or something like that). So, they put a $100 bill and a $20 bill into the check book and specifically requested change. The server kept the $20 bill and brought back only enough change for the $100. So, he took the liberty of tipping himself $20. That really isn't part of ""Can we please get change?"". We were pissed. We didn't want to deal with the establishment further, so we left without making a fuss about it. 

Overall, I will never be back. Too many things went unnecessarily wrong. It was such a disappointing birthday dinner. I would not recommend this place to anyone. Take your business elsewhere. There are much better value places that maintain a higher standard of food and business.",nrzswAPvMSjecJt8nK_BFQ,4,0,1,QdzDwYXkltEWwlCFK6zTew

In the end it still only saves you one dollar for two beers since you are unable to use the coupon on happy hour or any special yummy drinks. Has to be rail or beer =( I don't understand why they do this since all of us can get free beer and drinks in the casino, you would think that they would have better deals on the strip to maintain people buying directly from them nonstop. 

I viewed their menu and was sort of glad that I ate across the street at Diablos. I just wasn't very keen on their food choices. The bartenders were very young--or at least they looked like it. Both were kind and humble except when the one male bartender started to complain to another server about how stupid the two-for-one deal was in front of us. I thought that was unnecessary. 

Also a quick fun fact: I have never seen bathrooms share a sink. So in between the men's room and women's bathroom doors was a space reserved for washing hands.

Have to say it was definitely one of the best decisions of the weekend. Walking into the restaurant I managed snag ANOTHER offer for drinks which made for an extra awesome meal! 

Interior was pretty nice and modern but I'm sure that's the case with majority of Vegas restaurants you dine in Vegas. Very open and a large bar in the middle of the restaurant. 

Started off with drinks, bogo was for good for well drinks so I went with my Henny and Coke and my buddy went with his Gin and Tonic. $14 a piece they were pretty damn good size so that was definitely worth it even without the bogo. Was big enough to actually fill a child's to go cup (which we found out later because my buddy couldn't finish his drink) 

Food: My friend went with the New York Steak with ""fries"" and I went with the Full Rack of Ribs with Mac and cheese. Steak was the priciest of the two with both meals being just under $30.

The Steak was pretty damn good. Quality steak with a quality cook. He ordered medium well which I am personally not a fan of... BUT even with that one piece I took, i had to say it was quite enjoyable. Now the ""fries""... I thought these were just going to be your run if the mill steak fries you get at the majority of Chili's/Applebee's... Oh but I was wayyyy mistaken! Truffles fries! Can say I've had Truffle fries that good before this. 

My ribs. Can't remember the last time I ordered a full rack of ribs, but damn these were huge. Too big for the plate so they had to stack them up on each other. Sauce was on point and the meat were just falling off the bone... What more can you ask from such delicious dead animal?! Even the mac and cheese impressed me. Taste of real cheese, macaroni that were nowhere near overcooked, and that layer of crunch from the breadcrumb topping. I definitely enjoyed myself. 

With the offer for drinks and entrees, meal came out to $45! But have to say would definitely pay full price if I was in the mood for some Steak and Ribs. Service was also friendly!

My wife and I went with another couple last night before attending event at the nearby T-Mobile Arena. We had made a reservation earlier in the week, which was good since there were plenty of people on the strip - both Cher & Katy Perry in town at venues right next to each other. We were seated promptly, though it took entirely too long, about ten minutes, for a server to visit our table. 

We had ample time to look through their extensive but bland menus. I'm not sure what I expected, but the food options at this ""roadhouse"" were equally diverse as they were confusing. Chicken wings, street tacos, burgers, French dip and Cuban sandwiches, and a pasta primavera. I had imagined this place would be more of a BBQ or steak joint, but I was sorely disappointed, as was my wife who made the reservation. 

We ended up ordering our food and drinks at the same time when our server finally arrived. I settled on the DB Pub burger and my wife the southwestern Caesar salad. She also got the summer sangria, which ended up sounding way better than it would taste. Our food took far too long than it should, though on a busy Saturday night I wasn't too upset. I was more taken aback when our server delivered our drinks, and challenged me when our server delivered a margarita instead of the sangria and told me, ""that's what you ordered."" My wife's salad was quite peculiar. A Caesar by traditional standards, but with cilantro bits in the dressing, and black beans and corn - I guess that's what ""Southwest"" means? My burger was severely undercooked and the fries cold. 

Our server returned to our table about ten minutes (timed) later to check on how our food tasted, and was apologetic when we told her what was wrong. 
She apologized and explained the bartender made a mistake, and was quick to make sure the chefs remade my burger and fries. The sangria was brought rapidly, and my burger was remade promptly as well to my pleasure. However, everything was just blah. 

Overall, we left realizing it would likely be our first and last visit to this strip establishment. As locals, we don't make an venture down to Las Vegas Boulevard that often, but this place is definitely one we won't be making an effort to come to again.

Then look elsewhere.

After an entire day of liver-wrecking, my buddy & I woke late in the day and thought we needed something more substantial than the usual eggs-and-toast breakfast. Since this place is all shiny and new it acted like a beacon, calling out to us to stop in for a bite. The open air seating was attractive since neither of us felt like being too confined. We needed a constant flow of fresh oxygen, even if it was from Vegas' smoky streets. 

I ordered up a Bloody Mary to get things going. The waitress warned me it was spicy, which I didn't consider a problem. What WAS a problem was that it just plain sucked. There wasn't much spice to it, just the overwhelming flavor of BBQ sauce, which someone at some point in time thought was an acceptable ingredient in this drink. I'm not one to leave a wounded soldier to die on my table, but I just could not get this drink down my gullet. And I really tried. 

Both my friend & I ordered the brisket plate. They don't have any lunch specials here, so you're basically forced to order up an entire 1/2 lb. of brisket at once. I opted for the sweet potato fries as a side since everything else looked extremely heavy. 

When they served it up, we immediately felt a wave of regret wash over us. My friend took one look, had a tiny bite of meat, and then decided he was probably going to puke if he kept at it. I covered his plate with a white sheet (napkin) and laid it to rest. 

As for my meal, I didn't fare much better. The brisket itself was plentiful... and plenty lukewarm. There were, what, 5 or 6 other tables occupied here. How exactly did my food come out barely hot? The plate also included things like a parsley bunch and a grilled lemon. Function over form, chefs! WTF am I going to do with a grilled lemon? It's a plate of brisket. I asked the waitress and she said it was for presentation. A better idea? Don't waste lemons on a ""presentation"" that serves no purpose. 

Even better idea? Don't waste time - and a considerable amount of money - eating here.",4lng77gRdpRb24o91sSihA,3,4,2,kuX2LucDzbTyqwwHTe_U-w

We ordered 2 grilled cheese sandwiches in an attempt to have a ""quick meal"" before hitting the pool. We chose this spot on the advice of the MGM concierge, our main criteria being somewhere in walking distance that is ""outside with strip view."" That pretty much explains the best attribute of the Double Barrel Roadhouse in 4 words. 

After 30 minutes, we inquired into the existence of our grilled cheeses. I am positive this is when our order first made it to the kitchen. Another 15 minutes later, we had to walk inside to complain about waiting 45 minutes for a grilled cheese. 20 minutes later, still no grilled cheese. You would think they would make it a priority after MULTIPLE complaints. The place was more than half empty. After speaking with the manager, I explained as politely as possible that it's just 4 pieces of bread and cheese with some avocado and bacon inside and not duck a l'Orange. Following such a complaint, it should have been made within 10 minutes. Over an hour after our arrival, and after watching the table next to us sit, order, eat, pay, and leave, we had our sandwiches. I am adding the 2nd star because they actually tasted really good, despite being VERY heavy, and because the manager comped our meal, which included 2 beers. Of course they also got our bill completely wrong, which added to their reasons for comping our meal. The manager claimed he ""doesn't know what went wrong"" with the hour plus wait for our simple meal. Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.

Not bad but you get 3 small potatoes for $15, definitely not worth the price but it's on the strip.

The fried chicken comes in 3 piece or 7 pieces.  I asked what pieces come in the 7, Victor said it's assorted and you may get two or three of the same pieces.

    It was Sunday, March 15; and my dad had just flew in from New York. This was day one of my stay cation staying in NY-NY with family. We decided to make Double Barrel Roadhouse our leading meal. We had never tried it. I had walked by it several times when passing by the Monte Carlo. A few hundred feet north of NY-NY, we were now in the shadow of the Monte Carlo trying Double Barrel Roadhouse. 

   The Double Barrel Roadhouse  website promotes it as the place where country meets rock N roll roadhouse. However, in my eyes the industrial interior with the black ceiling reminds me more of a sports bar and restaurant that just so happens to open up to the infamous Las Vegas Strip. 

   When we stepped foot inside, the hostess walked us to a table that overlooked the bar. At the zenith of March Madness, the HD television sets played college basketball. It was a loud and upbeat atmosphere where holding a conversation was a challenge. A bigger challenge was staying here after seeing the astronomical prices. Where March Madness was playing above, the menu madness was below. We had expected a remarkable tasting barbecue dinner that mirrored those of Weber Grill and Rock Bottom. But just like gambling in a casino, we gambled and lost. 

   Just a sampling of the menu shows their astronomical prices. For example on the lunch menu, a cheeseburger and fries is $16, a classic Caesar salad is $12, and sausage gumbo soup is $9. For dinner, the starters (appetizers) are expensive with nachos for example costing $17. Beer is just as crazy. A pint of beer is $8 and a bottle of domestic beer is $7. This isn't a fancy bar that you'd see in the Wynn or on the top of the Stratosphere tower. Besides the astronomical prices, the menu selection is lacking the combinations that several barbecue restaurants offer. I did not see a plate where I could combine brisket with chicken or ribs with pulled pork. Anyways, my mind was set on the half rack of St. Louis barbecue ribs. With a side and cornbread, it went for $21. If I was very hungry, $27 would buy me a full rack.

   The half rack of St. Louis barbecue ribs tasted average. They did not knock my socks off. And there was one rib where I had to spit out what seemed like a piece of fat. I used a fork and knife to handle the six  St. Louis barbecue ribs. Between the fork, knife, and cloth napkin there were no sticky fingers. On the plate to the left of the ribs, the French fries were allright. If there was a next time in the near future, I would of ordered the garlic mashed potatoes. This brings up the issue of omitting cole slaw from the side dish choices. I have yet been to a barbecue restaurant that passed over offering cole slaw as a side dish. But, on the Las Vegas Strip there is a first time for everything. And there is a last time for some things. 

   I understand that there is this expectation that this is the Las Vegas Strip and it is acceptable paying more for less. The reality is that Las Vegas Boulevard isn't paved with gold and there is a World of restaurants in the shadows of its famous resorts. Ultimately, my reality is that when a restaurant charges more, my expectations are higher. After closing the door of Double Barrel Roadhouse, I most likely will not reopen it in a long time.",0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,11,6,2,ryUyL8iKXU1RORLYhZqKXA

I ordered a burger and garlic fries, my husband had the ribs and mac and cheese. My burger was alright, nothing super special and the garlic fries were definitely garlicy, but they were also dry and over cooked making them unpleasant.

My husband gave me a bite of his mac and I was extremely jealous that I did not order it too. Honestly, it is up there with some of the best mac and cheese I've had. I think it would be even better if it had jalapenos in it. So this is my reasoning for giving it 4 stars. because the mac and cheese was awesome! We wanted to come back another night just to have it, but there were too many other options to try out and didn't have time to come back.

4667624,2014-09-02,1,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"I'm not sure if the service here could possibly get any worse.  Came here on a Vegas trip for a quick lunch before our plans.  We chose this spot because of its great location and strip view.  The place was pretty empty, so we were seated as soon as we walked in.  We ordered their grilled cheese, assuming it would come out quick.  Wrong.  So wrong.  After about 30 minutes we asked about our meal and our server said he would go check on it.  Our server pretty much disappeared after this and didn't even come to refill our waters.  About 20 minutes later, we still had no grilled cheese.  This was more than enough time for the food to come out if they had initially totally forgotten about our order and put in the order during our first inquiry.  I had to walk into the restaurant and ask the hostess to find our server and to find out where our food was, especially since we had been there for about 45 minutes at this point.  Another 20 minutes went by and still no server and no grilled cheese.  I went in AGAIN and asked to speak to the manager.  The manager finally came out and we explained to him that 4 pieces of bread with cheese should really not take over an hour to come out.  He assured us the food was being made, which is basically what we had been told the last hour.  We watched about 3 tables sit, order, eat, and leave during the 1.5 hours we waited for our grilled cheese.  90 minutes later the grilled cheese came out.  After all this, I would hope it would've  at least tasted good.  Wrong again.  The only good thing about this sandwich was that I had asked to add avocado to it.  Other than that, it pretty much sucked.  It was super heavy, greasy, and just didn't taste good.  Making a grilled cheese sandwich is so easy and simple.  If they couldn't get this right, I don't know if they have a fighting chance in Vegas.  

Then we got our bill, which was totally wrong.  The girl at the front entrance had given us a certificate for 2 for 1 beers.  Of course, we were charged for both these beers.  After yet another visit inside to find an employee, and another complaint, our meal was finally comped.  During this entire ordeal, not one employee, including our server, came to ask us if we needed anything or to refill our waters.  This was possibly the worst service I have had anywhere.",Q7stP-Hi_3iC5ksxko5G5g,2,0,1,QdkLZ45q5lbdzqu0M6L5mQ

Let me first commend the hostesses. Great opener to the first-time visitor. Extremely friendly, courteous, and genuinely enthusiastic.

We ordered the loaded BBQ nachos, crispy (deep fried"") meatloaf, cheddar cheese grits, fried catfish sandwich, crackling pork shank, and BBQ brisket.

The best part of the meal was the appetizers. That meatloaf and nacho boulder were a phenom start.... (that meatloaf should be on every deathrow prisoner's bucket list).....

.... then it went sideways and slightly downhill like a 2-bit skateboard park. The catfish was too salty, brisket too dry, and cheese grits too...... out-of-a-cardboard-box tasting. The one saving grace was the pork shank because....... how the heck can anyone screw up pork at a BBQ place?

The live band was very ordinary (seriously, how do you mess up ""My Sharona""?), but the highlight throughout the night were the double barrel dancers that kicked their heels throughout the night up in the rafters, as well as waddling and 2-stepping throughout the restaurant...... a very welcomed distraction.

Because this is an SBE restaurant, on top of the fact that a Vegas bar is expected to be high at these menu prices (yeah they're not cheap folks), my expectations are high, and therefore rating standards are tough on this one. 

Cocktails were decent, but ridonkulously high-priced for the small quantity, and Bar service was slow. They also need to work on sound engineering and accoustic construction (waaaaay too much audible turbulence for a restaurant), and the air is far too thick. I think it has something to do with fog machines, but whatever it is, airflow is very stale and we eventually left because of headaches.

That said, I won't take away from the general fun atmosphere of the place. The dancers really brought a great dynamic to the place, and there was no shortage of gawking diners. It was sort of reminiscent of the days when the Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders could send any place into a high-octane frenzy when they toured the country and were a one-of-a-kind breed back in the day.

From a epicurean standpoint, skip this place if you're expecting anything more than a basic BBQ roadhouse joint. But if you're in the mood for group fun, you'll probably like it.

If you use the My Vegas app on your phone for slots or blackjack they have some pretty cool stuff on there to redeem for your points and they had a buy one get one free coupon for this place through the Monte Carlo.

The hostess was nice and our server started out with a bit of an attitude because we told her we were using a coupon and wanted to start with waters while we looked at the menu. Needless to say it took her a while to come back and take our order. Once she realized that we actually wanted alcohol her service was much better. Had to take away a star for the initial rudeness, but can't give less than four because of the wait and the food.

For being a lunch menu, they give you a lot of food for a good price. The three meat platter came with chicken, pulled pork, ribs and a side. The meat was very tender and the BBQ sauce was super tasty. Their garlic fries were delicious. I got the jambalaya which came with four huge shrimp on top, you could seriously get three reasonable bites out of each one. And the Jambalaya also came with a side, which I couldn't finish. The mac and cheese was good but nothing to write home about. They also give you biscuits to start and they come with honey butter which is really delicious.

5674833,2014-04-29,2,foQZ6guS0l49trURKh7vlA,"Anytime new restaurants open they seem to go through an adjustment period.  Most times the service is spotty and the food may not be that great.  Very few times have I seen restaurants open and everything run perfectly.  It is what it is.  People need to not be so tough....

Anyhow, this place has now been open a couple of months (max) and I think they've worked out most of the kinks. 

The space itself is very nice.  It's open to the strip and there is also a nice patio (Vegas needs more of these, even though it's hot).  Definitely some great people watching to be had.

The hostess and servers were all very friendly and helpful and made suggestions on the menu.  I was in the back bar area, where apparently they also have their own stage with band and DJ equipment.  They periodically offer live music, yet another thing Vegas needs more of.

I had the BLVD Bulleit which is made with Bulleit Bourbon, fresh mint, lime juice and ginger syrup.  I really liked this and found it pretty refreshing.  Although I couldn't have more than 1, I am not a big hard alcohol drinker. Their draft beer selection could use some work - there was nothing special about it and it was full of ""typical"" selections (Sam Adams, Bud Light, Shock Top, Stella Artois, etc).  I was excited to see that they had Steigl Grapefruit on their bottles list.  

For food I had the BBQ pulled pork sliders.  The order comes with 3 and bread and butter pickles.  Overall they were decent.  The bun was nice and soft and the pork had good flavor, although I found the bread and butter pickles to be a little overwhelming.  They weren't the best I've had, but far from the worst either.

For dessert I had the ""pie in a jar,"" and chose the lemon meringue flavor.  It was only OK.  I thought that the meringue was a bit dry and too burnt.  Not something I would order again, but it was worth a try. I'd like to go back and try the peanut butter version.

Overall, I like the concept and the vibe of this place.  While I found the entrees to be overpriced, the burgers and sandwiches weren't too bad.  It's to be expected while on the Strip.  This place is owned and operated by SBE, so it becomes more of a rowdy bar environment at night.  I think over time they will continue to tweak things and improve.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,5,2,4,tvxH562cLVXv0ILuhPIcsQ

I came to see the fights, and they have a $25 cover charge, no big deal. I ask to sit down, as I'm an hour early. I'm told I can't be seated until 5 pm. No big deal, can I reserve a table? Nope, they never do reservations, by five pm all the tables will be clear its first come first serve. I line up at five, ""I'm sorry, this table (the one that only shows a couple screens from one side) is the only one left."" Can we move? Nope, the rest were reserved. -_- but I can't reserve a table. Fine, whatever, we can all sit on one side of the table. THEN they tell me that, just FYI since you've already paid the $25 dollar cover charge, I should mention that there's a $50 dollar minimum. I'm pissed, because we paid $25 each and weren't told, but whatever the four of us will drink more than 50 bucks. Oh no Miss, it's $50 per person. We just sat at the bar, watched the fight, left and will NEVER go back. Served me right for trying to work with local businesses. The bartenders were super nice smart and made REALLY good drinks but the hostess was beyond rude, and the owner? He said shut up, I'm doing you a favor, I don't have to seat you...then what the hell did I pay for? So damn rude. Oh I forgot the best part, the bar has a screen that drops down so the people who paid can see but everyone else can't. They won't let u bring drinks through the screen, even though it's the SAME bar and they will let you transfer the tab. We even had the same bar tender. Good job, such a respectful establishment.

It reminds me of a frat house.  A clean frat house that serves amazing food.  They have pool, air hockey and beer pong and non-stop upbeat music, mostly top 40s.  We heard Nicki Minaj, Miley, Daft Punk, Beyonce, Usher and the like.

Our service was always wonderful and the food always quick.  My husband ordered a burger.  I can't remember which burger it was, but he said it was hands-down the best burger he'd ever eaten, and he got it every time we went there.  I'm not big on red meat, so I didn't try it, but I did sample his steak fries that came with the burger. Delicious and perfectly crisp!  I got the buffalo chicken sliders which came with two tiny sliders for $12, but they were delicious and I got those every time we were there, too.  If you go during lunch, you actually get the same sliders and a half salad for only $11 total, which is an excellent price.

They have a bathroom attendant situated between the men's and women's bathrooms where the sinks are located, which I found kind of odd considering the atmosphere of the place, but it's a nice touch.  One of the attendants, who my husband said was named Javier (but he was drunk because hey, it's Vegas!), let him borrow a lighter after he bought a cigarette off of him for a $1 tip.
