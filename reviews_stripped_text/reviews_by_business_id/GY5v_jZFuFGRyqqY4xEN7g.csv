My staples are the seven sensations roll (glorious!!) the stuffed tomato, the screaming orgasm, and the garlic tuna sashimi. Ive tried everything on the menu before and haven't met a roll I didnt enjoy here.  Also ask Tina to make u her special saki!! It's delish ;)",45LdXsT2WgyusSOw_0Gz-w,0,0,5,3gSu38sGRyJ5Xndu0v4hjQ

96113,2011-11-30,0,GY5v_jZFuFGRyqqY4xEN7g,"Come to sushi On Tropicana for the rolls, not for top quality nigiri. I don't think AYCE is worth it here because the freshness of the fish is mediocre at best, and most of the rolls, though creative, are very  heavy so you can't eat too many in one setting. I love the decor of this place though and I don't come to this location to eat sushi. I come here to have their boxed lunch or dinner sets as they are very filling and satisfactory. I especially love the Twilight dinner, and the tiny mashed potato ball full or corn that comes with it makes me happy. I know people love the fried ice cream served here. 

Personally, I give this place four stars because I am a big fan of their boxed meals. If I was coming here exclusively for fresh sushi though, Sushi On Tropicana only gets three, maybe even two stars.",Y55SXa5jxkT-O6wdafenHg,0,0,4,mzZcz4PyIQ7mI7WqYb5iDw

We started with edamame, chicken yakatori and the tiger shrimp tempura.  The edamame arrived unsalted, which I guess is nice so you can regulate your salt intake.  The yakatori looked nothing like the little skewer in the photo but instead it was really a shish-ka-bob just like something I'd make at home, it was good.  Tiger shrimp are generally larger than these specimens but it was no big deal (ha ha), they were still tasty.

I'm no conesuer when it comes to sushi.  Fry it, cook it, squirt a bunch of funky sauce on it, or just nigiri I don't care.  We did our first order with 6 various rolls; The Volcano Roll, The Rock and Roll, The Screaming Orgasm, The Loco Mexican, The Seven Sensations, and something else.  Except for the Volcano Roll, which was a little too cream cheesy, they were all great.  This wound up being plenty of food for the two of us with just enough room for dessert.

We finished with grean tea ice cream, hmph, and cherry tempura ice cream.  This was totally good.  Next time it will be a less sushi, more cherry tempura ice cream situation!

Service was good and when they added an extra beer to the bill it was no problem taking it off.  Wish we would have sat at the bar.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time and the chefs were pounding beers!

Looking forward to going back.",uj4iopBWA0RjpqoJ5xz_vQ,1,0,4,62nyizaCdD7gevfmrAFELA

My husband and i prefer sashimi, so FRESH is key!!!  This is where this place FAILS!  I have sent folks here, who I know just eat rolls, and they liked it and have gone back.  

My husband and I went in today because it's close and ""passable"" enough to take the edge off a sushi craving... today it was NOT.  It's never been more than mediocre but today it was so disgusting we actually spit out the Alabacore because it tasted like canned tuna smells.  We tried 3 things, 2 of which we choked down, asked for the bill and drove to the other side of town to eat.

The fish we got today was all room temperature, tasteless (except for the ""fishy"" albacore... anyone who eats sushi knows that fresh fish does NOT smell or taste fishy!!)

3 items (sashimi from the alacarte menu, not the ayce) one of which was inedible and visibly left on the plate and given back, cost $60.00....

Across town at Yummy Grill in North Las Vegas, we stuffed ourselves beyond full on some of the freshest yummiest fish I've had anywhere in the world and paid $77.00...

Initially the food was mediocre, maybe three star, and service was okay. A lot of mayonnaise used, which I don't like, and I have never been fond of the very limited lunch menu, especially in light of the AYCE price being the same as other sushi bars. For example, they would not allow me to get ikura at lunch. 

I was convinced to go yet again yesterday and quite frankly, neither myself nor anyone of my colleagues intend on returning. The service was horrible. From the time we sat down it took 40 minutes to get the first piece of sushi, and we were on lunch! We then remained for the next hour and got barely anything. Additionally, the quality of the fish was not the best. In addition to this they recently raised the price for the AYCE lunch, which would be acceptable except for the other reasons mentioned. We were served by Kevin, who was the manager of the location, one would think that of all people the manager would recognize the importance of good service, especially when practically the whole place was empty.

That's right ladies, all you can eat sushi for that hangover that does a body good and makes a body look right at night.

Peel ourselves off the ground and take off the frightful mask of makeup from the night before to head into Sushi on Trop for some tlc. With our greedy eyes, we automatically want to order everything twice. DON'T. You will need to pay for what you can't finish.

AYCE used to include drinks and desert.

I felt bad ordering a second round, since my friends were long done; but I did. We sat for another 30 minutes before I got the food - just some basic nigiri.

So my girlfriend and I jumped at the opportunity for a deserved study break and went around dinner time. There wasn't a great deal of people there but that was what made the place so special. We were greeted and seated immediately. I don't know if I'm the only one who can say this, maybe I'm super human or something but I can tell how the food and the overall experience will be within minutes of entering a restaurant. 

The service was top notch, they notified us of their specials and deals right off the bat. They made suggestions about specific roles and dishes they had that they specialized in. I mean, how many sushi joints will ever flash the news in big bright letters that they have a taro special? This place. 

The sushi was fantastic, some of the better sushi I have had here in Las Vegas. I'm no marine biologist (yawn) but that fish was fresher than I've had. Delicious.  

Some of the rolls we were so lucky to taste were the Candy Cane Roll, Stuffed Tomato and my personal favorite THE SEVEN SENSATIONS. You can only order that roll once and I can see why, because it would be the only roll I ordered the entire dinner. We also ordered some appetizers, such as the obligatory edamame and baked mussels which were equally tasty. They also offer a special with AYCE customers for free sake or a beer which is a nice cherry to the top of our metaphorical sushi ice cream a la mode. 

The sushi chefs, on top of all of this, were hilarious. They were personable and funny. They didn't just greet you upon coming in and leaving the place, they made sure you were having a good time which is something I definitely appreciate.

All-you-can-eat with a strictly enforced time limit. Seriously? If I want all-you-can-eat sushi I go down the street to Yama Sushi off Maryland/Flamingo next to China Joe's.

At a table or bar the service is usually slow. You have to eat within a certain time frame and with the time spent waiting for food/service, you'd think they'd be lax. Nope!

They don't even offer half rolls. No bueno.

It's not all you can eat EVERYTHING either. Yama includes everything on the menu.

You can only have one dessert per person and after that you're done with everything.

I do enjoy the rolls a lot, though. The soy paper is good. Garlic tuna and cajun albacore are great.
However, it's worth it to go somewhere else. The plum ice cream is great, although the portion is a little small. I'm used to getting a glob of green tea ice cream and an order of mochi elsewhere (included in all you can eat, of course).",iyhqoE49PTX2VNITzpDw6w,1,0,3,fHq2knOxxyb1lU_gLa3iTQ

My visit was mid-week for lunch. I'd been craving Sushi on Trop ever since I booked my Vegas vacation, and I wasn't going to let a little thing like 45mph wind gusts keep me away. I sat at the sushi bar and was tended to immediately. I asked the hostess if they had half-rolls since I didn't want to do AYCE and only be able to try 2 items. She pointed out a couple of items on the menu that came without rice and/or were 2 or 4 pieces. Perfect. She also said my last roll order could be a half order. (Something I totally forgot when the time came)

I went with her recommendations and tried the Cherry Bomb (spicy tuna topped with avocado). This thing was giant, and oh, so delicious. Then came the Screaming Orgasm (sashimi-style tuna tataki w/ screaming orgasm sauce). I'll just say the name of this item is appropriate. Wow. Next up were the Volcano rolls (salmon, avo, cream cheese, crab inside with whitefish and special sauce outside). This item came 4 rolls to an order, and is quite possibly my new favorite. Absolutely amazing. I finished up with Japanese Lasagne (california roll topped w/cream cheese and sauce and baked), which I had been craving for days. I totally forgot to ask for a half order, and I had serious trouble finishing.

As Victoria mentioned, the sushi chefs are a hoot. From the first guy asking ""And then?"" after each order to the second guy who asked me why I was even awake so early if I was on vacation. (It was around 1pm!) They both were good sports and I had a great deal of fun joking with them. In fact, I was told that the day before a guy came in for AYCE and polished off TWELVE orders of rolls. TWELVE! I admitted I could not accomplish such a feat, but mentioned my mother probably could. This brought a stern look from my sushi chef, and he advised me to 'never bring your mom here'. Heh.

Stuffed to the gills, I could handle no more food. I turned down dessert and a very kind offer to allow me to nap so when I woke up, I could eat more. I'm still laughing.

As I left, there were the usual cheers of ""thank you very much"" coupled with a ""see you tomorrow""!!

We have had a camera ""go missing"" when the only other people in the room have been staff. We have had club calendars be taken from us while we were eating dinner. We have waited an hour to be served our food before. 

I made it a point to give them another chance one night without the big group. 

I went in by myself and was seated right away. I was not offered anything to drink for at least 10 minutes. Once I asked for water, it was brought out another 5 minutes later. So, for those of you at home keeping track, that's 15 minutes for a glass of WATER. Nothing else. 

I ordered 2 or 3 rolls, and came in under the AYCE price (I didn't order AYCE). I waited longer than I should have for my rolls to start coming out. The manager came to check on me a couple times. He was friendly, but too pushy. 

When I was finished and went to pay my tab, he pushed the AYCE on me telling me it would be cheaper for me next time. 

Really? You're looking at my bill which is LESS than the AYCE and you think I'm going to save money by spending more money??? 

The service was WAY too slow, one table walked out, another table didn't tip and a 3rd yelled at the servers about them being so slow. 

I haven't been back since, and don't plan to. I'll even spend MORE to ensure better service. 

It's an overall shady place. 

Oh, and I haven't personally seen this, so take this part with a grain of salt, but a friend of mine reconfirmed my decision to NOT EVER eat there again, because the last time she was there, she saw at LEAST 4 roaches, 2 in the dining area and 2 heading INTO THE KITCHEN.

I actually thought this place was way better than Yama Sushi, and told the chef. That is because this sushi chef, and I am sad to say I didn't get his name, had a constant habit of saying 'And then?' after every order. At first I found this a tad off putting because I'm totally used to forcing every AYCE sushi chef to give me more sushi... because AYCE sushi is not for pansies. Then I realized what a fucking genius service mode that was, and we got into a good rhythm.

The waitresses were okay. I developed a plate pile at one point, and we had two different waitresses for the appetizer because the sushi chef called one over to help us, but she kept me in water.

At 24 bucks, they were comparatively priced and this one came with appetizer. I got tempura squid, which was very hot and pretty good. I had wanted an octopus salad, but it was not available (?) Though I ended up really enjoying the tempura squid. 

Sush/Nigirii pieces: came with a lot of rice and thick seaweed. Tako was pretty good - still a titch chewy but again, octopus is pretty chewy. You have to want it. The mackerel and yellowtail tasted very fresh and distinct to each fish. I didn't care for the urchin, which was um, very very sea urchin. The salmon roe were massive eggs. Inari was tasty, didn't care for the crab meat at all - but those two were the choices of the friend I was dining with, who is far less adventurous about her raw fish.

Rolls: Large selection to choose from here. I went with ""Final Destination 2"" as first selection - spicy softshell crab inside, four fish outside. Well, actually I recall it ending with sweet shrimp, but yeah. This was really good. ""Love Me Tender"" was my second call on rolls, which is crab and eel inside, eel outside. Delicious. There are far more adventurous ports of call on this roll list, and I'd like to go back and try them. My friend's Philadelphia rolls were okay, if you're into that, but I say you should just eat a bagel if you want cream cheese and fish.

Dessert: We had ice cream. I went with red bean, and I will say this: I thought Yama had the better red bean ice cream? The only real disappointment of my evening... well, aside from watching our Governor Gibbons blather on the television.

Upon coming in I had reservations, it was pretty empty for a lunch hour and from the look of the outside you don't know what to expect (definite hole in the wall). 

I sat at the bar and began perusing the menu. Their menu is very organized, by baked rolls, fresh fish, tempura rolls, etc. which is nice when you know what kind of roll you're in the mood for. I'm a fan of the Loco Mexicano because it's spicy and I love spicy rolls. I had some nigiri and another roll, can't remember the name because it obviously wasn't something to write home about. All in all it was pretty good, I wouldn't say great.

The waitress was nice and friendly. My sushi chef's name was Mike and he was very nice and helpful. He offered to make me a special spicy roll but at that point I was so full I couldn't fathom trying one of his tasty creations. He did make me some salmon nigiri which was one of his creations which was delish. I wish they had a wider nigiri option though & some of the nigiri isn't even available unless it's dinner which I think is a bit ridiculous. They also put sauces on a lot of rolls which I was unaware of, I enjoy simple rolls where you can actually taste the fish. Next time I know to request no sauce.

Overall the food was pretty darn tasty and the fish tasted pretty fresh. We had the all-you-can eat dinner and definitely got our money's worth.

Problem is we probably could have gotten more bang for our buck had the service been... there. Multiple times where we would be waiting 10 minutes or so for the waitress to come back. The all-you-can eat is in an hour time frame but I'm pretty sure we were there for 2 hours in terms of waiting in between orders etc so I guess  its a good thing they aren't so stingy with the time with all the downtime there is. 

Note this was on a friday during lunch time when we were eating. One waitress, two sushi chefs. Sushi Bar full with one or two side tables, so can't comment on the speed for dinner time rushes and my friend told me that it definitely isn't usually that slow.",JWNA_O5OSSIftKAGe4Yn-w,0,0,3,AUob7kKQywt93gTjOvX6oQ

We had the all-you-can-eat ($24.99). I had various fresh fish and one fried roll. They have a lot to pick from, but what really impressed me was their creativity. They had much more to offer, than just the usual assortment of rolls. My hubby had ngiri. They were actually fileting a fresh salmon - head and all - on the other side of the counter. When the chef saw us eyeballing that fish, he picked it up and made it talk. Everything was top quality. 
As for the decor, even the bathrooms were beautiful. I think this will be our new regular sushi place.",I9e80hahLUuqyvM0ft3EdA,2,0,5,a168IfJYNR2t2RlEcxznaQ

Rock and Roll - yummy
Candy Cane - yummy
Soft Shell Crab - yummy
Kalbi - good
Calamari - good
Tempura - okay

Take a seat at the sushi bar, I would say about 20 seats available, and the service is immediate, fun and whimsical.  Joe, the head chef, has a great sense of humor and will start you off with whatever you like.
We ordered Salmon Roe, which was amazing.  Yellowtail, which was wonderful.  Then the octopus came...one of my all time favorites at most places...and this was like RUBBER!  Horrid!  Avoid at all costs.  That being said, it was the only bad piece of fish we got the whole time.
We started with the rolls.  Great stuff.  They have a ""Tiger Roll"" which is a tempura battered roll and it is the best I have ever had.
""Joe's Roll"" is tremendous.  The ""Japanese Burrito"" had too much sour cream on it.
At one point they actually forgot about us and we sat for a half and hour waiting for a dish that never came. That was very uncool.

All in all it was excellent.  The fish was great, all but the octopus, and the rolls were great.  If they had not for got about us and the one rubber piece of fish we got, it would have been perfect.

All the rolls seemed to be a mash up of the color green, orange, and white. Seems to just be in the business of making money, no passion towards work output. 

The Pros:

Organized with using menu sheet
Server repeats orders
Wasabi between the fish and rice in nigiri
Tons of rolls
Free beer (Bud lite or miller lite) or sake

The Cons:

Missed orders several times
Definite corner cutting (i.e. Kalbi appetizer was 3 pieces cut up from one short rib, seems like a big waste of onions)
Inconsistent (i.e. some big rolls, small rolls, and different size cuts of the same fish)
Small nigiri selection (I'm not sure if this is small or if I'm just spoiled from Goyemon)
Fish quality was an uncertainty

Not to be out done in selection, there were more than thirty different styles of rolls to choose from (the hawaiin and candy cane roll I was rather fond of) and the experimental, or unusual named items such as the Who's Your Daddy turned out to be a tasty delight. Bella even got some head and had a Screaming Orgasm.

Beyond the extensive and massive amount of food to be had, the ambience of this sushi bar was perfect for our small group of friends to chat and dine casually, happily enjoying each other's company. The cheery, personable and friendly demeanor of our server Kevin made the night even more enjoyable, as he acccomodated our questions and stopped our incomnig rolls when we had over ordered (every roll with left overs counts as a la carte.) Even amongst the bright lights and showiness of Vegas one can find the nice and honest personal touches.

At $25 a person (not including the hot sake we ordered) and having eaten what would have been $38 worth of sushi a la carte, this is a good bargain if you bring your appetite.

Just be warned it may take up to an hour to get a taxi to come and pick you up from there as it's so far from the strip.

3939398,2011-01-12,0,GY5v_jZFuFGRyqqY4xEN7g,"This nondescript-looking sushi place is by far the best in town.  The sushi-preparers are friendly and laid back, the servers are efficient, the atmosphere inside is relatively welcoming and ambient, and the fish couldn't be fresher if you caught it and cut it up yourself.  Plus their all-you-can-eat is unlimited, and costs only 20 dollars (plus tip) if you can make it in before three oclock for lunch, or 25 if you're a nightowl like me.

I am surprised by some of the less enthusiastic or disappointed reviews for this place.  I've been going to Sushi On Tropicana for about four years now.  I've tried almost every sushi place in town, and this one is still my favorite.  They put no limits on their all-you-can-eat, and I've never gotten any service that was less than ideal, regardless of how busy they were.There are three sushi places less than a quarter of a mile from my house, only one of which is worth eating at.  I live near Summerlin, on the Northwest side of town, and I'd much rather make the hour-long trek across town to go to Sushi on Trop, rather than go anywhere else in town.

Sit at the bar, the sushi preparers are always super-friendly and they are hilarious.  I've had such a good time with them that I've even added a couple of them on Facebook.  They will treat you like a close friend if they remember your face from a prior visit, and hanging out with them while waiting for each of your delicious fishies is comparable to sitting in your favorite aunt's kitchen waiting for your favorite meal to come out of the oven, lovingly handcrafted with only the super freshest ingredients. The only real difference is that no oven is required.

The variety of options on their all-you-can-eat menu is incredible. There's really something for everyone.  Their handrolls are the best and some of the biggest I've had in town, I swear.  Their hamachi nigiri is my favorite.
You can taste how fresh the fish is they use, plus they have a few items that I haven't seen anywhere else in town.
For example:
Try the CHERRY BLOSSOM, under the special rolls menu.  It's my all time favorite roll ever, and it isn't even ""a roll"" at all.  They start off with about a snowball-sized mound of moist spicy tuna, and encircle it with fresh avocado slices.  Then they drizzle it with screaming sauce and sprinkle crunchy tempura flakes over the top of it.  It's decadent, dense, and filling.  I've eaten as many as three of these in a row on a single visit to Sushi on Tropicana, which says nothing for the size- it's pretty big.
They also have STUFFED TOMATOES, which is salmon sashimi wrapped around crabmeat and drizzled with ponzu sauce, which doesn't excite me as much as some of their other menu items, but a few of my friends I've taken there have just about jumped out of their skin over these.
Plus they have MACKEREL and SUPER WHITE TUNA NIGIRI, which are personally my two favorite fish.  Theirs are both buttery, moist, and have a good flavor which makes me suspect their fish has never ever at any point been frozen.

If you want to have a really great time, buy the sushi preparers a beer or two.  They will, in exchange, loosen up towards you, and also ensure that your sushi is only the best of the best.
The owner is also super-friendly.  At this point, as a familiar face and a returning customer, he even hugs me on my way out the door.  He knows I'll be back.

Next time you want a good time and some great sushi, try Sushi on Tropicana.  You won't be disappointed.",ccbW0wqPT4ViF8u9j_aG1A,3,0,5,GLDRLhDkHLWAdcMbj4y9bQ

Besides the fact that I can eat as many hamachi, unagi, ebi, maguro nigiri till my tummy desires, I can also order fresh oysters, shrimp tempura, beef teriyaki. Sushi rolls up the ying yang. This is not only all you can eat sushi, this is all you can eat anything. That is japanese of course.  If you're thinking about going to a place like Todai, don't do it. Unless you like your food sitting on a buffet for hours, where it's overcooked and the rice is rock hard. 

Go to Sushi on Tropicana instead. Everything is made fresh to order. Sit at the sushi bar, strike up a conversation with the sushi chef. He'll make you something incredible. 

Don't be greedy don't waste, sushi man get very angry when you waste. I always get overly excited and have the eye's are bigger than my stomach syndrome and order waaaay too much.

I love the name of this place, sushi on Tropicana! Give a guess what street this place is on :)

Nigiri: 5/5  I'm a picky nigiri girl, I like my portions to be off more fish less rice. I find a lot of sushi places packed on the rice and leave little sushi. Well this place ain't one of them. The fish is fresh too very delicious, 

Rolls: 5/5 WOW they had a huge variety of choices all delicious, if you look at the business photo's look for my name you'll see the photo with a whole lots of rolls. I'm not particularly a roll person but my group was & I don't mind nibbling off their orders we all had all you can eat. 

Baked Green Mussels: 5/5 The baked green mussels are very delicious I'd say #2 on my list of sushi joints that cook the baked mussel ever so perfect with the right amount of yum yum sauce with out burning it. 

Service: 5/5 The service here is amazing, once you walk in first thing the staff does is greet you. Very friendly place. 

Location: 0/5 If this place wasn't so far from me I'd go all the time. Its pretty close to the strip off of Maryland park way and Tropicana. It's kind of in a run down area.",iS4NVHLQDt1IzmmMKqwy5A,0,0,4,s5ciRS0fOGLjS-zjnERFWQ

So two of my friends and I were really craving sushi and found Yama, our usual joint, way too packed so we decided to go to sushi on tropicana instead. Right off that bat I knew we had made a mistake as we were greeted by the owner (who was extremely hammered and could barely walk straight) awkwardly and uncomfortably grabbing our arms to seat us. 
It was all downhill from there. Because we waited almost 20 minutes just for a server to acknowledge us and take our drinks, we were starving and therefore placed in a nice hefty order of around 10 rolls. It took 35 minutes (yes I was timing them) just for us to receive one freakn roll!!! If their chefs weren't too busy taking multiple sake bombs, maybe this wouldn't be an issue. I told our server if each roll would take this long we don't even want to waste our time and she assured us everything was on its way. 
After some more waiting, the server brings us out 6 dishes. 3 of the 6 dishes dishes were ""appetizers"" which were ""complimentary from the chef"" to compensate for the wait. This further angered me because: 1) we clearly saw the food on the menu and didn't order it for a reason 2) they were obviously using this as a tactic to fill us up 3) at this point they neglected everything else we ordered and thought we'd be satisfied with that! 
Trying to calm myself, I hoped that the food was worth the wait and took a bite of the sushi Kiss My Ass!! MOST DISGUSTING PUTRID TASTE THATS EVER BEEN IN MY MOUTH!!! Everything they had brought out looked not fresh and unappetizing. At this point, I was fed up and wanted to speak to the manager.
The manager or ""chef"" which mind you was also plastered out of his mind, came up to my table and asked firmly and rudely, what's your problem now? I explained to him that the service is terrible, we still haven't received half of our order after an hour and a half, and the food sucks! And this dude really had the nerve and yell so what's your point? You just want a free meal? I was completely embarrassed at this point and explained that I did not need a point because I'm just an unsatisfied customer making a complaint! He then proceeded to ask me the same damn question and continued to believe that my friends and I were hoodlums just trying to get a free meal out of it. 
Never have I experienced this level of rudeness and unprofessionalism. The boss of the establishment then offered to give us minors, alcohol. For the sake of your time and taste buds, STAY AWAY!!!!",UAXpyeoOyYmsvE5_YvBe5w,2,1,1,NCt0RvtNBtuoJVQMyw68iw

I thought it would be nostalgic seeing as I was going with one of the girls that I had gone with the first time I frequented this place. I was sadlyyy mistaken. We did not have the same waitress we had the first time, and I'm not sure if she still works there. I ordered whatever options there were on the menu for vegetarian rolls and my friend chose 'all you can eat.' Neither of us were impressed and the rolls were average if that. I ate 2 rolls and wanted some tofu on the side, of their 8(or more options) for tofu items they only had two available. I was very disappointed and will not be returning.

The service was pleasant and the selection for the AYCE was great - however I can't really speak on the quality of the fish because my nigiri and rolls barely contained any.  I have never seen any other restaurant try to pass off such a huge mound of rice with a small sliver of fish on top it as nigiri.  The rolls were also rice-heavy- they even skimp on the avocado, cucumber, and other non-fish ingredients in the rolls.  I have never tasted a blander shrimp tempura roll than the one they served me at Sushi on Tropicana.  I would have tried more of their menu options, but I was too disappointed by what they already served me.  I actually only ended up ordering about $5 more than the AYCE price than if I had ordered it a la carte because the sushi just wasn't that good.",6B9ICWLdY9C7gGPkRX93ZQ,1,1,2,Ls1QTmz83JazxWhc7QLzrA

4840949,2008-12-25,0,GY5v_jZFuFGRyqqY4xEN7g,"Just got back from another good Vegas weekend.  Tired of the pretentious atmosphere and outrageously overpriced sushi on the strip (Tao, Koi, etc.) we decided to head off strip a bit and try Sushi on Tropicana after seeing a few good reviews on Trip Advisor.

Went in with tempered expectations, and came away pleasantly surprised.  First, the fish seemed fairly fresh and the salmon, super white tuna, and unagi were all solid, but not spectacular.  We tried a number of specialty rolls and were less impressed, in fact I feel like some of these rolls are just overwhelming with ingredients/sauces to where you can't taste the fish.  Hence, my advice is to avoid the rolls with the screaming orgasm sauce or any of the other sauces.  

Regarding the service...we sat at the sushi bar and the service on a Friday night was spectacular.  The sushi chefs are very friendly and after we bought our chef a drink he returned the favor and we all drank a bunch of good sake and had a great time.  They have a couple of interesting sparkling sakes for $15 or less a bottle, which were unique and delicious.    Plus the chefs and servers kept asking us if we wanted to order anything else (food wise) and promptly served our drinks - you can't ask for better service!

Overall, the food was 3 stars, but the service was 5 stars...definitely a great value at $25 all you can eat and an awesome place to go with a large group of friends.",nJm0FoEIPlNCbyjtpmjfOQ,1,0,4,lua-YHVmAYxTlRyXAKrBJA

5059011,2010-10-06,6,GY5v_jZFuFGRyqqY4xEN7g,"WHY DOES THIS PLACE HAVE SUCH A LOW STAR COUNT?!?
If I could give this place more stars, I would. However, my review is solely based on their all you can eat sushi. Now, it's called all you can eat sushi but it's actually all you can eat sushi and APPETIZERS! Also, it's not a buffet, all their food comes out to you fresh and hot from the kitchen. Made when ordered!

Appetizers (I love this place because they offer so many different appetizers and they are DELICIOUS):
1. Hamachi Kama : the yellowtail collarbone, brought out on a sizzling platter which keeps it hot and makes the skin wonderfully crunchy. The meat is very buttery and moist. Squeeze a little lemon on it and go at it! At the end, I just pick the whole bone up and chew the rest of the meat/skin off of it. Caveman like, I know, but it's that good.
2. Salads!: they have a variety. My favorite is the Ahi Tuna Poke salad (fresh and flavorful). My second favorite is the salmon skin salad. 
4. Baked Mussels: YUM! and you can order as many little mussels baked with their creamy sauce as you want!
5. FRESH oysters: downside is you only get one. BUT mine was HUGE and so very FRESH. I believe they prepare it with ponzu sauce, tobiko, and siracha. If you are a raw oyster lover like me, you will love it!

Sushi (downside: you can't order sashimi but you can order nigiri and other delicious items made w sashimi)
1. Stuff Tomato : ALL TIME FAVORITE. It's salmon sashimi rolled up with imitation crab stuffed inside of it. Very cute presentation and dressed with a sauce that accents the sashimi perfectly. No soy sauce needed!
2. Salmon Skin HAND rolls: I love how they give you the option between cut rolls and hand rolls. The salmon skin hand rolls here are stuffed with crunchy salmon skin, not dry salmon bits. 
3. Screaming Orgasm : Not sure if it lives up to its name but still yums! Tuna sashimi drenched in a special sauce. Try it and see for yourself =)
4. They have Tobiko and with a quail egg on top!
5. Nigiri: Tuna, white tuna, salmon, hamachi, albacore...all VERY fresh and delicious.
6. They have such an abundant amount of rolls and a good variety too. You can have your fair share of cooked, fried, raw, and simple rolls. But my advice is to pick two or three of your favorite cause they can fill you up really fast.

Their service is extremely accommodating and friendly. Our waiter kept up with our order (7 hungry girls) an tried his best to do it as fast as he can. Funny guy. He also offered us tempura ice cream instead of the usual scoop of ice cream but we were way too full for it! Why can't there be one in San jose!!!

Upon arriving at the establishment, from the outside looking in, I would've probably passed up eating there if it hadn't been for how hungry my boyfriend and I were at the time. To my pleasant surprise, inside the establishment was very nice decor you would not expect. Around 3:40ish pm it was now considered dinner, the AYCE price was 24.95 like most sushi establishments.

My boyfriend and I took a few minutes to go over the menu and finally after about 7-10 minutes, we had to wave our server down to give him our order. While waiting for our food, I noticed a family of 4 sitting at the table next to us who seemed a bit antsy. They were probably there 20 minutes as we were there, having already ordered there food and still were waiting. Finally, the family gets up to leave due to the long wait. I was surprised that the woman had to pay for her hot tea, seems like they should've just given it to her for free if they were waiting 20 + min for their food. 

Around 4 o'clock, I noticed that many customers were coming into the restaurant and were PATIENTLY waiting for their orders to be taken after a few minutes of sitting down. Anyways, at 4, we were starting to wonder (because of the lack of fast service) how long it would take for our first dish to arrive... 20 minutes...25 minutes after 4, our first dish arrived which was not even a cooked dish. I was wondering how and WHY it would take so long for sashimi to come out. Anyways, I think I've made my point to how slow it took to get our meal. Now after 30 minutes, 5 or 6 dishes all came out at once. The food was delicious. My boyfriend felt that the wait was worth it. Don't get me wrong, the food was very good...but, I can't imagine going there on a BUSY day and waiting maybe 3 times as long. I would've just gotten up and left if it were up to me.

Anyways, the server was nice and apologized for the wait. Maybe he was new. Maybew the sushi chefs were new. They walked in turtle speed around the sushi bar.
