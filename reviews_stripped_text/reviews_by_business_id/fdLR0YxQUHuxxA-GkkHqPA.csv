442973,2015-05-15,0,fdLR0YxQUHuxxA-GkkHqPA,"So I called late for a delivery from Sacramento, CA to my boyfriend in Las Vegas because he was craving Mexican food. I called a couple of other places but they weren't  too friendly and did not want to do anymore delivery. So I called Senor Pollo Restaurant and Rami took my order even though it was almost closing time. He was really nice and made it happen for me...the BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE I ever had in Las Vegas, he even added a little extra to my order for free. My boyfriend said the food was delicious and freshly made. I will definitely come by and thank him personally when I move to Vegas next week.",3t45dVi1R8IJL11oEYYOpQ,0,0,5,ER3UqVhWTI7Zufft687Bkg

3891259,2015-05-24,0,fdLR0YxQUHuxxA-GkkHqPA,"This place must be having some problems. I just ordered food for delivery and after an hour of waiting, I get a call saying my order was refunded because the place is closing early. So I don't know what that's all about but why wait an hour after I've placed my order to let me know? I'm starving.... Oh well",-jSTFDuaDXMrLYvU1KbK5Q,0,0,1,Q0P9GvRKR049PFsPzSxlIg

Walked into the little market and where the section for the chicken is empty. Asked the man behind the cash register for the market, said they are all gone. Which is crazy since there are chicken food signs all over the outside of the market and someone just left a review 10 days ago ????",9llcWQyzwDwZuoIMzjV7ag,0,0,1,me7C7c0GA7muD8hAMzJD7Q
