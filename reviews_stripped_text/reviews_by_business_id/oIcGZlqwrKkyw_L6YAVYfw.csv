Not only did it take 30 minutes to get through the drive thru, which is irritating enough, we got the added pleasure of not being greeted at the window until we finally honked our horn after 10 minutes of watching 3 teenage girls laughing and dicking around in plain sight. No apologies or explanation on where our food was...or how long it would take. Another 10 minutes go by and we finally get our food only to discover, as we drive away, that half the order is wrong.....so we got to hang out for another 10 minutes waiting for the correction. Oh, and the girl offered us a coin for a free drink for our troubles. Seriously, my family and I wasted all this time because of your inability to do your job and you give us a free drink? I wasn't waiting for compensation so please don't insult me with a drink for me and my family to share.  A sincere apology would have sufficed. 

Appropriate words cannot express these girls' lack of professionalism, respect, and accountability. Whatever manager thought these girls were a good choice to close the store should revisit the hiring and training section of the SOP. I will not be returning Sonic.",yKxxRYgpHCI2WEXJF_GqxA,1,0,1,c1K05YbO7_yBYkgv17W4uA

She made our orders and she was very friendly.  She seems to be very concerned for her staffs well being.,T3_Maz72KRLYWY9a1qWYQg,1,0,5,iyajmZg7AUrSNBFMXgXZLg

1101917,2017-12-28,0,oIcGZlqwrKkyw_L6YAVYfw,"First time at this location. I placed my order in the drive thru, and when I pulled up to pay I realized I forgot to order something, so I waited about 5 minutes for her to open the window. There is a machine outside of the window to pay with card, maybe she was waiting for me to pay but 5 minutes ? When she opened the window I asked if I could ask something to my order, she could have easily answered ""sure no problem"" or ""no it's too late sorry"".... she just ignored me and kind of sighed. She clicked some thing on the register and said ""go ahead""... I come home to find my drink isn't even mixed. Attitude and my order wasn't made correctly. Get it together sonic. I believe the girls name was Chrysta per receipt.",p-hgqJve04p67p8_rPHY3g,0,0,1,4sjz7TwI6SPgx1YVu1Cs7Q

1699015,2015-05-14,0,oIcGZlqwrKkyw_L6YAVYfw,The service here is pretty good and quick. The reason for a few stars is multiple times we've come here for shakes and they are out of ice cream!!! I was surprised and I can see this happening once in a while but 3 times in the past month?? That's pretty ridiculous I think.,Gq9VWIn2-vlrx8cGZY4OXg,1,0,3,tb3QZW39hdDdc1KprXbjRw
1708550,2015-05-07,0,oIcGZlqwrKkyw_L6YAVYfw,"For real? 17 minutes to get food in a drive thru when I'm the only car?? Teenage knuckleheads work here man. I tried giving this place another shot, but what a let down. 

Last time I was here these kids were coughing serious attitude for not getting a tip. We live in a town of hospitality, if you deliver crappy service you get NOTHING. I seen a worker chick rage out and slam the shit out of a door and knock supplies over all because she didn't receive a tip. Quit being slow as a turtle and walk up to customers with a smile for once. What a disgrace to the Sonic family name. I'm over this place!",qauzCa1EheZzPnpAfU4fQA,2,0,1,gSXT00wG9Hs3_tu2eWbOkw
1712924,2017-11-27,0,oIcGZlqwrKkyw_L6YAVYfw,I just don't understand why this Sonics drive thru is so slow. I ordered a damn medium fry with a small drink and after waiting 10mins I just had too leave. Normally when I go to the other sonic establishments especially the one in North las vegas on craig rd across from the cannery casino they move the drive thru line very quickly. That's what bothered me the most is I saw that my order was ready even though I was second in line they could have come out taken my card and given my food and I would have been on my way. But after 10 mins of just staring at my order sitting on that counter while i waited for the guy in front of me to get his food I just said screw it an left. Maybe if the manager and employee where paying more attention and not shit chatting maybe they would have done what the other Sonics I have gone to do and given me my simple order.,9V9oenM4UPq90iT9WAoTDg,0,0,1,UtIUhIPtSD8c9wIseemirA

3170642,2016-01-24,7,oIcGZlqwrKkyw_L6YAVYfw,I've been to many Sonics before and I've never been fully satisfied like this location has done for me. All the other ones I've been to are so slow and always mess up my orders! It's not that hard to listen and apply! Well this location on sahara near eastern are very fast and efficient. Even when they might be slammed and the cars in front are holding everyone up. They will walk out to your car in the drive thru lane to collect your money and bring your food to you. They seem to have more of a sense of urgency than most places and that is what keeps me coming back. Also their candied slushes win their way into my heart every time. Other than that I wouldn't come here. Their food is nothing special.,0LzxzSM6oqOilJ_Tx8AXzg,13,14,5,MOJx7-OaUE6PZnqIRUg7Rg

Took exactly 7 minutes for them to even open the window to see if we had payed yet and still didn't have our food or even drinks. We ended up waiting 18 mins to get our food, and that's not from when we ordered that's from when we pulled up to the pick up window.

Then heeeere comes Xzavier with his ""I don't care"" personality. Had to repeat my order a couple times and he didn't even get it right, handed us our food and drinks and before we can ask for salsa he just shut the door on us. Had to wait at the window for a good 3 minutes before he finally noticed us. Meh. Disappointing. One star for you Xzavier, one star for you.
