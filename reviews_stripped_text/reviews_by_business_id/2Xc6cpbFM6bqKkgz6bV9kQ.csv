The waitress was really nice but we think the sushi chef had her cut us off as it seemed like they were making up limitations on the fly.

It's not a long walk from the Strip and the AYCE sushi is much better than most things you'll regret buying in a mega-hotel-casino.

The rolls are well sized for sharing, but they do skew towards being overly embellished. Maybe I should just say that if you like your rolls drizzled with sauce and fried, come eat here. Edamame, miso soup, etc. are included in your AYCE meal, but why fill up on that?

The space itself is nice, and the service is friendly and prompt. I might have preferred Sushi Mon, but as a tourist, I'd definitely eat here again.",6DbvYyAvTtXTmVOAG32Djw,1,0,4,oBKh4ULRLMFkMWEPHQTCgw

838541,2011-11-29,0,2Xc6cpbFM6bqKkgz6bV9kQ,"I created an account just so I could review this restaurant and make it known. I'm a Los Angeles local who eats a LOT of sushi and was pleasantly surprised by Rock n Roll. It was deceptively empty, which we thought was a bad sign... couldn't have been more wrong! My friend and I both got the all you can eat lunch special which included everything on their sushi menu, a rarity since it was pretty large. You can, of course, order the rolls seperately but I will soon convince you otherwise.

The sushi chef, Kiyo, was not only very competent but also very personable, I love being able to chat and joke around with a sushi chef at the bar. He was patient when we asked questions about the rolls we were not familiar with, made very successful recommendations when he found out what we liked and was very accommodating for my onion allergy. 

We sampled pretty much the entire menu... Honestly, we gorged ourselves and found every item served to us to be not only good quality, but pretty damn tasty. Even the simple items like the baked mussels and nigiri sushi were done well and not just run of the mill. My recommendations are the baked salmon roll and the self named rock n roll, which was a fresh, bright roll perfect for the desert heat.

Please note, that  Rock n Roll has rules for the all you can eat regarding charging for uneaten items, like most other ""all you can eat""ers that I've been too, but it wasn't necessary since I was basically licking the plate right in front of Kiyo. Also, note that there is a minimum gratuity based on the size of your party but based on the service and good time I gave much more than the 15% for a party under 4 people.

I could not recommend this place enough and even though I am not a local we've decided that we're going to be going back there a few more times during our vacation. It's sad that my new favorite sushi place is not even in the same state.

One waitress said it was all you can eat in three rounds and another said all you can eat as long as there isn't waste.  The service was okay to disappointing; one of the servers was a bit rude.  While tipping is traditionally a reward for good service, this restaurant just tacks on a tip (which in fairness they do tell you about before sitting down).  It's really no surprise that they do this, given the quality of service.  What is surprising is that their ""rules"" for tipping are clearer than their rules for ""all you can eat""*.  The irony is that we probably would have ordered fewer rolls if it were a more traditional all you can eat where there is no pressure to order in three rounds.  While we did finish everything, apparently you get charged for left overs (like at other all you can eat sushi restaurants).
Overall, not a bad place to eat, but consider this your informed consent :P

I'm very honest and polite as are my friends.  So I'll start with the good.  Food wasn't that bad for expecting fresh Fish in the middle of the desert.  The Vegas roll was pretty good.  Nothing here was great or worth craving for - but not bad.

The bad- we sit down and chubby waitress (don't know their names) comes up and says buffet is $27 a person no drink included - that's pretty high, but we were pretty high and wanted sushi- ok let's go for it.  

Red flag one- it's not a buffet - they make each roll one by one- although 4 people ordered - they only bring out one roll at a time. And take about 7-10 mins in between each one they bring out. We had munchies- these rolls lasted about 47 seconds and then another excruciating 10 mins before the next one arrives.  Mind you - other than for us there was just 1 other couple. For you simpletons out there quick math - 6 customers total - at least 8 staff working.  Speed should not be a problem when there is no cooking involved. Salmon meat was white, shouldn't salmon be pinkish?

Red flag 2: after 2nd roll and after Being there for 20 mins waiting for more food our waitress decides it's time for a ""shift change"" and makes us pay NOW instead of at the end of our meal like normal- okay weird but whatever- just get me more Sushi!! She takes our money and tips and waitress number 2 arrives.  Old Korean looking lady with evil eyes! Super scary and sketch, says ""l herp u now."" But the first waitress never leaves- they just both start walking by and staring every 2 mins like we're stealing the salt or something. What happened to the shift change?? And they forced us to pay a 15% tip even tho our meal isn't done yet and definitely not going well so far! But we were hungry and thought being the evil money hungry witches that they are- they would some how give us better service now knowing we're not cheap and have already paid! Boy was I wrong....

Red flag 3: were done eating after an hour and have had only like 5-6 rolls total between 4 people and just dropped like $120 + tips ready to leave - the waitress says u didn't finish the last 3 pieces were going to need to charge you for that!

This place had a bit smaller selection than other places as they were missing Tamago of all things.  Location is in a cheezy little strip mall area.  Dining room was stark and cold but not unpleasant as was the service.  They only let you go 3 rounds on the AYCE but that's more than enough for most people (they don't want people camping out which is understandable.)  I did note that she didn't bring the sheet back after round 2 but my stomach was hurting by then.  

Cooked food menu is very limited and quality is no different than a Japanese Counter Service place but with table service prices of $13+.  I wouldn't come here for anything other than AYCE which does include appetizers, teriyaki chicken, etc. etc.  

I would give them 4 stars but I think they put a little too much rice with their sushi to fill you up on rice.  It's the normal amount of rice.  But some places, like Sushi Twister over on the East side of Vegas give you close to the same size pieces of fish with less rice so you don't get full as quickly.

Overall, if you are in the North Strip area and really hungry, craving some Japanese food at a reasonable price, this is a decent choice.",z5YKMFtISMlMMPoBy4s9Fw,1,1,3,sMZoFWacEto_l2a4Wacxdg

I didn't have high expectations and, in the end, it's a sushi place in a strip mall.  But it's an acceptable, and more importantly, affordable sushi place in a world of expensive restaurants.

As far as Rock N' Roll, I'm not sure I get that vibe from this place.  Even in the middle of the day, it's dark but there's not especially rocking music.  I did notice a few large groups of day drinkers roam in as we sat there so I guess it must get wild with the drinking crowd at night.

The sushi was relatively rocking.  While they only have one vegetarian choice on the menu, off menu they are willing to make pretty much any kind of vegetable roll you can think of.  My avocado roll was not the best I ever had and I was a bit surprised by the small size of the roll but it definitely was high quality.  Combined with an order of fried rice, it hit the spot.  Honestly, the fried rice was better than the sushi and much cheaper.

While our server was rather aloof, she did bring us a spoon when we had trouble eating fried rice with chopsticks and she was rather jovial when we did see her.  And after another restaurant completely ignored us, it was at least good to get food.

Anyway, if you enjoy other food groups and excessive eating, then Rock & Roll Sushi is as safe a bet as any in the Vegas. For $24.95 you get all you can eat made to order nigiri and rolls. 

Here are the rules of the game: you have a one hour time limit, you order a round of sushi at a time, and you are charged if you leave anything on your plate. 

I went two rounds. In round one, I had some miso soup, plenty of nigiri (salmon, yellow tail, albacore, tuna), a fried spicy tuna roll, and a rainbow roll with shrimp tempura inside. For round two, I enjoyed more salmon, yellow tail, and albacore. 

The salmon was delightful. The albacore was tasty too. The yellow tail could have been better. I was not a fan of the tuna, but I have never been that into tuna for some reason, unless it is toro. My main grip with the nigiri was that in round one, the fish slices were very small. Look, I came here to eat and you're going to charge me if I leave food behind, so you might as well get my belly full early.

As for the rolls, they were good (especially the fried spicy tuna roll), but were sloppily made. For an all you can eat joint, they held back on the rice, which was nice. 

The staff was cool. It was interesting to see a female sushi chef. I heard somewhere that you don't see many female sushi chefs because they have warmer hands than men, so it ruins the fish. I just think it's some urban legend that Japanese men spread around so Japanese women would have one less reason to wield a knife. I am not sure if my urban legend conspiracy theory is true, but I think other men in other cultures should try this too. 

I am sure John Wayne Bobbitt would agree.",0kSXMbNFo7mdwTPj4iQv9A,14,12,3,fiCpWbnWWCh_OxF1DgFzRg

It was undercooked and had a weird after-taste.  Every nigiri felt like a mouthful of tiny pebbles.   I also don't believe the prices are that great.  We ordered a la carte, and a plate of nigiri salmon was $4-$5, but the quality did not match up to the price.  I've had way better nigiri for cheaper.

All of this was tolerable, but a couple things annoyed me.  First, they charge you dinner price for AYCE lunches on the weekends.  That was disappointing, since there was kind of no way of knowing this before walking into the restaurant.  The second thing was they stated that there was a mandatory gratuity on parties of any size, but they never told us that it would be on non-AYCE orders as well.  I understand if we were 2 people eating 20 plates each for AYCE, yes that would be a lot of work for the server.  But we were two people, ordering 4 items a la carte.  How is this different from any other restaurant that doesn't charge an automatic gratuity?  And no, the service was not exponentially better than other restaurants, especially considering there were only 4 other patrons in here.  To add insult to injury, they charged the 15% mandatory gratuity ON TOP of the tax.  It's not the money that bothers me, it's the principle.  If you are going to charge a mandatory gratuity on us, it should be on the price of the food only.  I normally calculate the tip on top of the tax anyway.  But when they make it mandatory, I feel like I'm not even given a choice, and that I am forced to pay a gratuity that is not based on performance of the service.  It also gives the sense that this business is shady and trying to pull a fast one.  Banquets and wedding receptions understand this concept; they calculate tax and tip separately, each on the same value: the price of the food (or per head).  If this restaurant really wants more money, they should just raise the prices on the menu.  The bottom line is, the only time this place MIGHT be worth going to is for AYCE weekday lunches.",h70Izpu92o8LRwGt8DbZqQ,4,0,2,F4S0qappHj-F7e98qa6k8A

They have a special for ""all you can eat sushi"" for 25.00, so it was automatically assumed that we wanted the special..... So details about the ""all you can eat sushi"" were discussed right away, and that we had to eat everything on our plate before we could order more, and we needed to understand that an 18 percent gratuity is expected....and so on and so forth. I finally interrupted her and explained that we were not interested in her ""all you can eat sushi"" special, it was 1pm and we were just grabbing a couple of rolls (lady, please calm down).

 We sat at the sushi bar and the chef gave a little giggle as we made comments about the manager/waitress being a lunatic. I ordered the dragon roll, it was sooooo yummy. My friend ordered the crunch roll and we kinda shared both of the rolls. My tab was about $14 which was not bad.

The octopus roll I ordered was not fresh.  The tempura seemed like it consisted only of baked vegetables and fried dough w/ no seasoning whatsoever.

I wasn't greeted by the usual blast of AC in most every Las Vegas building, but luckily it wasn't too sweltering hot outside so it was fine.

The sushi was pretty good for the price (about $22 for all-you-can-eat), but we noticed they added more and more rice to the subsequent rolls you ordered. I, however, kept a napkin on my lap, and kept removing the rice and placing it in my lap when our server and the sushi chef weren't looking.

Let me start by saying that Rock N Roll Sushi has been on my list of go to sushi restaurants for a while now and I finally visited. What attracted me were decent reviews, alcoholic beverages, and a professional website.
Yesterday at roughly 4pm I called and asked if there was currently a wait and if the AYCE included EVERYTHING on the menu. I was told by a female that there was no wait and EVERYTHING on the menu was included in AYCE. 
We arrived at about 5pm and the place was completely empty (told the truth about no wait). We are asked how many and we state 4. Immediately told there will be a 15% gratuity included on bills of 4 or less because they're ""on the strip"". Hardly on the strip and have ate at finer restaurants in casinos with no such BS rule, but I'm hungry so it's a go. 
Once seated we're asked if we're doing AYCE or A La Carte. I state the 3 adults will do AYCE and my 4 year old daughter will do A La Carte. I was told the whole table needs to do AYCE or A La Carte, no exceptions. So I need to pay $28 for a 4 year old to eat some chicken and rice? I dispute it with the server because she's 4 years old and she gives me an attitude and says ""whatever"".
While the server is getting our drinks I'm looking at the AYCE rules and it clearly states SASHIMI IS NOT INCLUDED. Upon her return I asked her if that was true and she said yes. I asked her why not even an hour ago she LIED to me on the phone and said EVERYTHING was included. She denied ever having the conversation with me and played dumb. 
She was extremely disrespectful and didn't care if we left or not. We left without saying another word. I will never return and I hope others don't waste their time.

Simply put, outright disgusting service. The atmosphere was downright toxic and disappointing. When we called in advance to reserve our table. The waitress was incredibly kind to us. However upon arrival we were met with sheer lack of quality on the managements part. There was a obvious loss in translation in our situation. We had with us a diabetic friend who regulates his diet very carefully. Especially in regards to rice, originally we asked the waitress if we could order nigiri. She originally said yes that is fine. However we also brought up the discussion of our friend and his issues. At 1st she was ok with the idea of him eating some sushi. But every so often discard rice and just give the leftover rice to one of us to eat. By technicality he was eating all the food he ordered. But when the manager got wind of this. The management outright changed the entire mood and killed our will to eat there. Instead of coming up with a compromise for our friend. We were told by the waitress as a order from the management that our friend must order sashimi. They refused to accept our order continuously when we tried to politely explain the issue. We instead decided to just pay for our drinks and leave.

Normally I am a very reserved person in writing reviews. But its what the manager did that struck a major chord with me. During our final moments of sipping our drinks. The manager was hiding behind the sushi bar where the chef worked. Every so often I personally looked over at her. She had the most intense glare and it was at our disabled friend.

The pure and utter lack of respect for their customers amazes me. I'm shocked a place like this has remained in operation as long as it has. This is a PSA advisory to anyone wanting all you can eat sushi.

Do not visit this restaurant. Their ordering process is obscenely complicated to grasp. You are met with utter scrutiny and lack of respect. This is not worth any of their so called ""delicious sushi"". Me and my friends will not be visiting this area again.",Ec-uiLf6p5Z_p457CtP_iQ,2,1,1,bSfgBMtXEsATnfjfvIsYlw

Wasnt packed out but it was busy, and they were fast to get my rolls out. Good place to get your fix.",KDIsFfEMLiMO9IqNmLjkOw,0,0,4,ITjdUSwB8BFW4jJqWdWsiA

The All-You-Can-Eat lunch was just $21.95! The Sushi Chef, Kiyo, is masterful! Everything was delicious and visually stunning. Kiyo was skilled and friendly in making sure we got a variety of sushi. The fish is flawlessly fresh and flavorful. 

Dinner is just $5.oo more. Don't miss it! 
Get out of your hotel and enjoy this local restaurant!",-JHAWoDhrO0GXs1lk9ppzw,1,1,5,RKU62p9Rq-X5B5QdoL9pSw

You would pay 3xs as much for decent sushi in the hotels. Parking was easy on a Sat afternoon too.",lwbwjURJNtdIuqiuYYmHpw,0,0,5,IaXxIPQ2Op5tHv7coHjKGQ
