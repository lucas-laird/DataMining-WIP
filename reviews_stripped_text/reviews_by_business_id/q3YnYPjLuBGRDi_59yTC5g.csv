The owner was super nice & helpful and was very accommodating to my Gluten allergy (all Rice paper/noodles are Gluten Free).  Loved every dish but my favorite was Pho with rare steak and brisket; Grilled lemongrass chicken, shredded pork skin & egg loaf; Pan fried rice cake with egg; caramel flan and fresh spring roll with grilled pork.  I'm lactose intolerant so I'm not meant to have caramel flan. I only had a bite from my friend's flan but next time, I'm going to order one for myself and worry about the pain later! The owner said that the flan is the most popular dessert and its made by his wife.  

You can tell that the owner is very passionate about food and loves his tea, brought out his tea collection to show us and told us when was the best time to have them & how to best prepare tea.  He even gave us a sample of oolong tea to try at home.  We had pu-erh tea and they were good quality tea, it was strong even after 3rd fills with hot water.  

It took us nearly 20 mins drive to get there but it was worth the trip.  I'm only in Vegas for a week and I'm definitely coming back again.",VTz5GDUaWwioUm6uynaYWw,1,0,5,vFMspnk6eS-jNtKkiBRHmQ

They can bypass the flavor if they serve to the Caucasians because they wouldn't know what to expect in the broth. To make it short, broth was bland and tasted like they used Pho flavoring bouillon instead of beef bones because broth was dark and bland.

Definitely one of my favorite restaurants!",zfWsnLW4myfY8RNoodeqxQ,2,0,5,d3M3bhiono8o01r3B262Wg

Nice small place. The decor is nice and I was seated quickly with a smile.

I only ordered 2 items. Wonton Egg noodle soup and fried egg rolls. Never get the large bowl. I think it's a sucker bet. I liked the egg noodles and the wontons were small but taste pretty alright. The barbecue pork is a good addition. Not the best barbecue pork but it will do. Egg rolls were standard and they were hot and fried to order. The broth was really good, not too overpowering but just right. Very well balanced. Soup broths don't have a standard taste. It depends on the house recipe. It's tough to mess up Vietnamese food. I like this place because of the location and the speedy service by super friendly people.

Both items were very good.  The wife's serving of grilled pork was larger than we have seen at most Vietnamese places.   My dish had six grilled shrimp with plenty of flavor.  Egg rolls tasty and the fish style sauce was very good.

After a busy black Friday, I took the family here for the simple fact that it's much closer to our place in Summerlin than our usual favourites of Pho So 1 and Pho Saigon, both in Chinatown.

We were the only Asians there at the time, which is usually a poor predictive factor.

The things that struck me right off the bat was how clean the place was and the fact that most menu items were $2 more than our favorite places.

My wife complained about the bleach smell coming from the recently mopped floor.

My kids split the beef stew. I thought it was tasty, but a little tougher than I'm used to. The egg noodles that I chose to go with it (as opposed to vermicelli or bread) was too chewy.

The pho came with 3 choices of meat. I chose flank steak, meatballs and some other beef product. The soup was a little saltier than usual. The meat was nondescript as was the noodles.  My wife describes it as ""adequate.""

I had the bun (cold and dry vermicelli) with chicken, egg rolls and fish sauce. The portion was surprisingly generous. The chicken was dry, underseasoned breast. The eggrolls were delicious, the noodles were average at best.

Overall, below average Vietnamese food at higher than usual prices. But big plus for being clean and closer to my house, though. I realize that they need to cater to their customers, so I'm sure it'll be edible if you're not used to the more authentic stuff.

The food is phenomenal is the only reason I don't rate this place lower so kudos to the kitchen staff!

Ridiculous.

Oh and expect a most disgusting look on the man's face when you ask for utensils.  Like I can use chopsticks, but my parents can't.  Accommodate them you sheisty fawk.  Straight up just bad service.  Needless to say...

My dad chose a P1 with rare steak, tripe and tendon and he loved it.  Very tasty indeed, the tripe was a tad bit tough but palatable.  My mom ordered the seafood pho (P4) and it was also good lots of seafood goodness perfect for he type of weather (overcast) we're currently having.

Yeah it's a fairly simple sauce but so many places get it wrong by either being too salty or too bland.  I thought it was perfect.

I live super close nearby (like a 2 minute drive) but haven't came here before. Both my friend and I had not eaten dinner so decided to come here since it was nearby

This specific location has changed ownerships/names/etc quite the few times in the past but it seems like this restaurant has been doing well. Surprisingly easy life still exists next door Lol xD 

Décor hasn't changed since the last owner but they changed the layout a bit. I think they put a drink station or something in the dining room, side closest to the streets. 

Since the weather is getting warmer by the day, we both were kind of craving something not so hot. Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. Vermicelli noodles with grilled pork and egg rolls. One of my favorite things to get in terms of viet food. Granted this location is a little away from the main ""Chinatown"" or Asian area so their prices are a little bit higher than others. For this specific dish, it was $10 each. Brief glance over the pho's they were a little more pricey too. 

Service wise, they were pretty fast. We were sat down at a table almost as soon as we arrived. Waters were brought out quickly and our orders were taken. 

Surprisingly it didn't take long for them to bring out the food too. The restaurant wasn't completely full but they weren't dead either. Maybe give or take 50% capacity? Granted it was dinner time but not bad. 

Their version of bun thit nuong cha gio is a fairly good size, in appearance. Topped with 2 cut egg rolls, a metal cup of their fish sauce, pile of bbq pork, some cooked chopped green onions, shredded pickled carrots, and carrots. All these on top of a bed of vermicelli noodles with a bed of mainly bean sprouts before that. Overall, taste wise was not bad. The thit nuong (bbq pork) was a little overcooked but nicely. The amount of bean sprouts on the bottom was a bit much. More used to more of a ""chopped greens"" with some bean sprouts vs almost entire bean sprouts. The best part is the cha gio (egg rolls). Though they aren't the best I've had, they are one of the very few that use taro in the filling. Flavor is light. My friend didn't even notice until after I mentioned it. Do love viet style egg rolls in general. With and without. But it was surprising they did theirs with. 

Overall, not bad. Maybe like to try their pho or their broken rice plates in the future.

With Vietnamese food my regular order would be bun thit nuong or pho tai or fresh spring rolls, so over the years I have been able to compare better tasting ones and not so good ones. 

I ordered the bun thit nuong. My hubby ordered a thai iced tea and grilled pork chop. After they took our order, it was not less than a minute that my hubby's food came out. I literally told the guy ""oh no, this must not be our order because we just ordered less than a minute ago."" He went back to check and sure enough it was. Hmmmm...ok so I don't know if this is how most Vietnamese restaurants work (pre cooked pork chop)?? But I can only imagine it dries out that way? and how long as it been sitting there??My hubby has been ordering this same dish for years at every Vietnamese restaurant we go to and I've never seen food brought out this quick. Needless to say, I was not impressed. Fast service is one thing, but that was clearly not the case. It was food that had been sitting there. He did not like his food. 

The next thing that I feel this restaurant needs to work is how to deal with a bloody finger and a dirty band-aid. What I mean by that is our server had a bloody finger (some sort of wound) that was pretty big (about a 1 inch cut oozing with blood to the point where I could see it. The band-aid was not fresh (you know when it is tightly wrapped around and dry looking). This band-aid looked as if he possibly wore it all day or washed his hands with it. When he set down my hubby's food I could see the blood on his finger and band-aid half falling off. I would think there is some health requirement about wounds and how to properly cover them when serving food???

The thai iced tea came in a  small glass in which water is served. Everyone around us had a mason jar with their thai iced tea, not sure why we did not get one. Filled with ice, my husband got 3 sips of thai iced tea. 

My bun thit nuong came 10 minutes after my husband's food (I guess they actually cooked the meat on mine). It has bland and I did not enjoy it. 

They also messed up our order and charged us for food we did not order. Of course they fixed it. 

2 stars for my food

I enjoy tripe in my pho and lately most places I've been to doesn't really do it to my liking. But Sidestreet's tripe was tender and had the right amount to it, in ratio with the brisket I added to my bowl. 

The Vietnamese iced coffee I had was tasty and actually tasted like coffee and not just sugar. It's pretty strong too, so I recommend you don't have it when you plan on sleeping early. 

One funny note: our waiter was really attentive and conversational. As he was refilling our waters, a couple came in at 9pm, and hour before closing on a Saturday night.

Obviously the locals looking for good food they know well or grew up with all have the 411 on the hip spots. 
This place is no exception, it comes close to the quality of the super-native Viet spots in Cali I go to when visiting family that are so ethnic the owners barely speak English. Like I said, that strategy always pays off and I'm glad I found Sidestreet, especially as it's only a mile or two from my hut. They have the food ready fast and hot, and have some of the better thai iced tea I've had. Most places in town that offer it have no idea how to make it properly.

We ordered the Bo Kho (sidestreet beef stew) with a baguette and Pho Tai (pho with rare steak). I asked for the rare steak on the side so that it doesn't cook too much in the broth before I eat it.

I asked the difference between the medium and large bowl hoping to get an idea of approximate size (every restaurant definitely varies). The server gave me the vague answer of ""large is good when you're hungry but if you're not very hungry medium will still fill you up"". I got absolutely nothing from that and wished he would have just gestured the approximate size with his hands. Anyways, I just settled on the large since I was going to share with my boyfriend. 

Onto the food: The baguette from the Bo Kho was very good. It was fluffy on the inside and crispy on the outside. The beef from this dish was pretty tender also. It's sooo delicious dipping the baguette into the dish. The large Pho Tai was a pretty good portion of pho. The soup was delicious as always. It was enough to share between my boyfriend and me. I did wish, however, that they gave me more Thai basil leaves and limes for the amount of pho I had. I got my water refilled which warrants a notable mention.

how do you know a relationship is at its caliber? when both parties are able to withstand all obstacles, right?


well, for me, it was cold and windy and about 9:50pm when my friends and i decided to go to the nearest pho place next to our house. luckily Sidestreet closes at 10:30pm, so we got there, got sat, and ordered by the time is was 10.05pm. my two friends barely opened their menu, and the lady already was trying to take their order. 

my one star represents that our soup came out fast and they weren't blatantly rude--at best.

when we got our soup, it wasn't even that hot, it was barely warm. i assure you, the meat was decent but the soup wasn't hot, therefore the pho wasn't the best experience. the staff didn't even come over to see if our empty cups needed refills. granted, they're closing up and setting up other tables taking care of other things. i noticed the staff greeting nicely to others but just because we were the last ones there just ten passed closing, not the same type of ""genuine"" service, as if we're a burden. [insert big eyed-emojicon here] Not a big deal for you, just for me. On that note, i'll just make my way to spring mountain where im worth their business.

The young  waitress just gave us menus and forgot we even existed. Even when we tried to get her attention she would come to our table so we had to go to the hostess station and tell her that we wanted to order our food. She eventually disappeared to the back and a young man took our order and brought out or drinks. He was probably the only one of the front of house staff doing any work. An older waitress brought the wrong food to our table (without saying a word) and simply walked off. Luckily, the young man was able to get the right food to our table.

The first visit went little different direction tried the Sidestreet Beef Stew. I was not sure the noodles out of three choices. The server recommending the Egg Noodle. It was spot on with the noodle choice. Overall really enjoy the broth. It was hearty with decent amount of beef and lot of stuff in it. The egg noodle rounded out the dish. Again hearty amount of noodle in the bowl. I got order of the traditional fresh shrimp and pork spring roll. It was refreshing. My second visit went with traditional Pho Dac Biet. I got the special combo. It has all the different meat options. Again just like the beef stew enjoy the broth, hearty, nice portion of noodles, and perfect dish on cold Vegas night. 

The service was fabulous both visits. Mention earlier my first visit got great recommendation on decided my noodle. They were on it the whole time.

Yelp informed me that they closed at 10:00pm and I wasn't sure if they'd be okay with us sitting down to eat, since I had gotten off work at 9:15 and by the time we got there it was past 9:30. We walked in prepared to settle for takeout. However, the waiter was very accommodating and gave us a table and menus and water right away. 

My bf and I both ordered the ""make your own pho"" option, his with rare beef steak and mine with steak and beef balls. It was out within five minutes. Soup was hot, noodles tasted very fresh, broth was DELICIOUS. I usually have to put a lot of hoisin sauce and sriracha in my broth, but theirs is so flavorful that I probably could have gone without the condiments. Lots of beansprouts for us to share, which is a huge plus for me. Hate it when pho joints skimp on the veggies. 

I see that their spring rolls have good reviews; we're going back to try them very soon. (Didn't want to make them cook too much, since the kitchen was almost ready to close.)

My broth was light, refreshing, citrusy, and not greasy.

I also ordered Cha Gio for $5.50. OMG! Excuse my French but these are the best PHOking fried egg rolls I've had in Vegas so far. I haven't been to many Vietnamese restaurants in Vegas but please let me know if you know of any better egg rolls than the ones they serve here. 

They also have a small bakery which I was too full to try. I didn't see many Chinese dishes. They serve mostly Vietnamese food. The decor of this restaurant is cute. It looks like an outdoor cafe with cute street signs such as Pho Blvd adorned with lots of plants & Asian style roofing.

Service was quick and friendly. The young waitress took my order, the food came out quickly, and in a reasonable time. She even checked up on me which is unheard of in most pho restaurants. However, it took a while to get my bill but they were busy so no worries.

Now for the non vegan pho I will have to say it is also excellent! I am 1/2 veitnamese and grew up eating homemade veitnamese food. So believe me when I say this place is very good for pho! Aside from pho Thier fried rice with chicken sausage is good. Kind of greasy but taste great. Chinese sausage has a lot of fat in it so it's expected. The fish sauce for dipping is pretty good. There are several ways to make it. Some people make theirs sour, some make it sweet, some make it salty and then there is spicy.

I also got an order of the fried spring rolls and papaya salad with pork and shrimp. 

Pho - outstanding, and I had takeout.  It was still piping hot when i got home (i guess that's to be expected in the desert).  The combination of meats and fresh vegetables really made this dish pop - they also throw in a cup of the black sauce and a packet of Sriracha. 
A bit on the oily side, but I'll eat this again for leftovers, it was a good portion.   

The fried spring rolls were good as well - moist and good flavor inside, and crispy on the outside.  The cloyingly sweet sauce was a bit much, however.  The papaya salad was good in the fact that it was cooked well - the shrimp and pork both very tender.   The flavor just wasn't there and although cooked well, was a bit bland.

2716978,2018-04-24,0,q3YnYPjLuBGRDi_59yTC5g,"Our town doesn't lack for good places to eat noodles.  Sidestreet is one of the places I'm starting to frequent when I need a quick Pho fix.  At the northeast corner of the intersection of Desert Inn and S Durango, it's easy to get to.  There's the main storefront / set of shops there, and several others grouped together in smaller buildings in the parking lot.  Sidestreet is one of those, so don't look past it.

The menu is big enough to satisfy you regardless of what kind of Pho you're after, and there's a generous assortment of other appetizers / assorted street foods on the menu to ensure you can supplement your soup.

If you don't already know what you'd like, I recommend trying the Pho Ga or Pho Tom.  Both are tasty.  Another way to go is to ""make your own"".  This was what I did the first time I went, and still do when nothing else on the menu seems to satisfy the craving.  From the appetizers, the Papaya Salad is very good, as are the fresh spring rolls with grilled pork.  I haven't tried any of the Udon or egg noodle soups yet, but I keep promising myself I'll do it soon.  I know I'll find some new favorites from those parts of the menu.

While it seems there are always people there eating at mealtime, I've never had to wait to be seated, making this a place you can go to for lunch during a busy day and not worry that you'll lose valuable time waiting for a table.  The restaurant is always clean and relatively quiet.  When you arrive, you'll notice the staff always seems happy and genuinely glad to see you, whether you're there to dine in or just to pick up an order to go.  Speaking of take-out, if you order soup to go, the cold/fresh items are packed separately from the hot broth so you can add them just before eating.  Just what you'd expect from a good Pho restaurant.

If you find yourself in the south-central part of the westside of town and you're hungry for Pho, swing into Sidestreet.  I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied.",djb61X-vkg5PF16qM_wI5Q,2,1,4,h6MJrFuiCjmH-FEGh1BvGg

What really upset me though was that the cook was having a huge fight in the back during the middle of lunch hour.  You can hear him screaming and throwing things at someone... not sure if it was an employee or customer but it really put some edge on during lunch.

2878266,2017-09-30,0,q3YnYPjLuBGRDi_59yTC5g,"I saw this place on Instagram and wanted to try their noodle soup with wonton.
I had a chance to stop by as I had business to attend to in south west area, so there I was.

This restaurant doesn't have ambiance or mood what so ever. Just table and chair, in some what Asian night market ish interior.

There are plenty of seating. I visited around 1pm and was seated immediately.

Menu is pretty standard, what you find in most Vietnamese restaurant here. Same goes for the price. It's not crazy expensive, rather cheap.

On to the wonton soup noodle. I ordered Mi Hoanh Thanh Xa Xiu. Served with in 5 or so minutes. 
It came with bean sprouts, pepper slices, and lime wedges on the side.
A lot of noodle, 3 wonton, bokchoi, broiled pork, in broth.

First, broth. It's nice but slightly sugary.

Second, noodle. It's my first time eating egg noodle at Vietnamese restaurant. I liked the thread thin noodle for its interesting texture. But they were tangled up in broth and was hard to pull apart.

Topping and garnish. Bok Choi is beautiful, and a good match for gentle flavor of the broth. Pork Xa Xiu was very lean, almost dry. Could've used little more fatty, personally. Bean sprouts was crisp and fresh.

Now, the wonton/noodle/broth ratio. It's way more noodle, not enough broth. That's why it's so difficult to pull noodle threads apart from noodle ball. 
I wanted more wonton, less noodle, more broth.



Overall, food was decent (based solely on what I had), customer service is non existent. I wouldn't say it's bad customers service. It's just bare minimum.

This place has some of the best pho broth in my opinion. I like that you can customize your pho with the meats that you want. Most places just have the pho choices made for you. Here you can choose your meats a la carte.

The noodle bowl is also really good (I had that this time). Everything tastes fresh and well-made. The veggies taste like they were plucked out the day of, green and clean.

Their meatballs also don't taste too great. Their steak is pretty good and they don't slice it paper thin which is a plus. At first glance their small pho seems a bit smaller than the rest of the small pho I've gotten at other places but it did fill me up so although appearance it's small it does have a significant amount of noodles.

Desert Inn and Durango in the Vons shopping center. My search for 5 star service and a 5 star pho-licious experience reached its bon appetite apex after consuming a carry out order of Pho-Rice Noodle Soup, plus Cha-Gio, (Crispy, Fried Egg Rolls), and while I waited, a Peteso, (French Pastry Puff) with a can of Tangerine Switch Sparkling Juice.  Yummy!

The 5 star service award goes to Ken, the owner. From enter to exit, Ken welcomed me into the grill as though I were family.  Even as a carry out customer, my ten minute wait felt timeless.  His suggestion to try the Peteso was a winner and introduced me to the french influence on vietnamese cuisine.  Ken kindly pointed out that the food here was as genuine and authentic as his childhood culinary routine helping his mother cook street food in Vietnam.  

""Ain't nothing like a home cooked meal"", I thought to myself in anticipation of reaching my own kitchen to construct a big bowl of the grill's broth with the traditional add-ins.

Now for the 5 star pho-licious award.  Sidestreet Pho and Grill wins hands down. The perfectly spiced broth alone earns a certificate of merit, then add bean sprouts, lime juice, scallions, onion and jalapeño slices, cilantro, basil, rice noodles, and a choice of beef cuts.  The aroma, texture and freshness of the ingredients plus the generosity of garnishes and sides assured me that here at Sidestreet Pho and Grill, I have found what I've been searching for: a welcoming environment and authentic Vietnamese food derived from a deeply rooted family tradition.

Atmosphere: Organized, lively
Even when the is place is almost closing, the place is still booming and patrons are still coming in.

Service: Quick and Slick, Nothing spectacular
Upon ordering, they did not ask me for what drink I wanted and automatically gave me a water. I don't really appreciate people assuming I just want to drink water, but I let that slide. My bowl of pho that I had ordered was delivered to me rather quickly upon ordering.

Food: Pretty good, but a little disappointing
I received my food pretty quickly, which was a bowl of pho with three different types of meats in it. I was also given a plate of vegetables (bean sprouts, mint leaves, jalapenos). I was disappointed on how little noodles I actually received in my bowl. The meats that I ordered, however, were totally up to par. The broth was flavorful as well.

The bowl overall was worth the price of what I paid for, but the lack of noodles was the eventual downfall.

Overall: Worth a visit! MIGHT come back
Totally worth a try, I might try something else on the menu. The pho I had was nothing special, but still tasty. I felt like my experience was a little under-valued, but don't let that stop you from having some Viet food.",yvqGJqrjeC0AwYs6Oecp0g,2,3,3,9dSF2p5yETit-5lm8HnLLg

Anyways, we were seated and we ordered our usual vietnamese things: the spring rolls, 2 large pho tai to share, and bun cuon thit nuong (bbq pork with mint, lettuce wrapped in rice paper). 

The food: Absolutely amazing like they say on their shirts haha. This is probably by far the best pho I have ever had in las vegas. The temperature was super hot, the flavor was awesome (I didn't even add any hoisin sauce...just jalapeños and lime because I like my broth a little limey). The spring rolls tasted awesome as well and we finished those in a heartbeat haha. The bbq pork wrap was packed with so much flavor that I ended up eating all of it myself...seriously the food was on point!

The service: Despite it being rather busy, the waiter (todd) was super attentive and kept our drinks topped off. He even stopped to chat with us a few times, which I thought was really cool of him. I feel like at a lot of the other pho places in town, they just barely talk to you and just make you feel like a number. 

The atmosphere: I think the decoration of the place is actually pretty neat... They have these indoor ""rafters"" if you will, simulating a street like feel. There was also a large flat screen TV by the register that had basketball on which was cool.... so basically this place would be awesome to eat some pho and watch a game or something.

Overall I am super excited that a pho place like this has opened on my side of town.... it beats having to drive into china town (and avoiding the traffic). This place also serves amazing food!! We will definitely be back for more!",V_dT-3YVhfcwlTM_ztG0fQ,0,0,5,wDCOz3n9R_56MK8bOZwh6Q

Their grilled pork could have been more charred, but the deftly seasoned pig and crispy egg rolls made the bún cha gio thit neon ($8.95) a satisfying dish. A better dish was the Bún Cha Gio Ga Nuong ($8.95) -- tender slices of chicken breast glistening with oil atop a generous amount of noodles. The broken rice was decent, too. An order of grilled pork chop showed good depth of flavor and a good sear on the meat. A to-go order of it came with noodles and a separate container with the tiny grains of broken rice.

Much of the interior remains unchanged from the previous tenants (Oriental House), with wooden columns supporting a faux street scene roofline along the kitchen area and dining room.

 We ordered
# S1 Vietnamese Crepe stuffed with Shrimp and Pork
#P1 Make your own Pho - I chose flank, tendon and tripe.
#C5 Tofu skin shrimp paste, Shredded pork skon & Egg loaf.

The restaurant was quiet busy around 1pm. The place looked clean and laid back.

Apparently, I received a text from DMV & we had to leave due to my appointment coming up in an hour. I motioned for the waiter and had him packed everything to go. He was so cool about it.

The veggies we very fresh and I really enjoyed it but when I put the tripe (see photo) in my mouth, I had to spit it out. It stunk so bad. It left bad taste in my mouth for two hours. Disgusting. I don't know if they gave me old tripe or what, but it was not edible.

Had the rice vermicelli with grilled prawns. We got extra prawns, which is 4. When the dish came, there were 8. Which means that without the extra, you get only 3-4. We asked the server about it and the response was ""The shrimp is very expensive"" ha! 

Also, prawns were not grilled. That is the Highlight of a vermicelli dish and it didn't happen. Came steamed and flavorless. Also, some still had the dreaded vein it them. Gross. The dish was also all noodle. There was a little bit of lettuce on the bottom, maybe a few bites and a few slices of cucumber. I ended up leaving almost half of my dish because it was literally just.. All... Noodle. 

The veggie egg rolls were very good but burnt. 

The potstickers are so gross and dry. They are deep fried, hard and absolutely not what I expected. 

There is no Chinese food here (as advertised on the signage). The server told us ""we do have Chinese food; we have fried rice"" and also that they were ""supposed to have it but the chef quit because he did not get along with the owner"".  Ah.. 

Overall, not happy with the food. I'm surprised because the ratings are pretty good and I was expecting the ""amazing Vietnamese street food"" as advertised. 

It is also very apparent that in this establishment, no one is really in charge, servers are very inexperienced, young and very open about the drama, which is a huge NO for customers and chefs are quitting before the place is even up an running.

3702140,2017-10-01,0,q3YnYPjLuBGRDi_59yTC5g,"Sidestreet Pho and Grill has been my go-to pho place for a year. Vietnamese cuisine has become popular in the area, and you can find a pho place everywhere. But Sidestreet Pho and Grill stands out because of few reasons. First is their food. I don't know how, but their broth tastes so much better than other pho joints in town. Their noodles are always cooked perfectly, and the side vegetables are fresh as well. I personally haven't tried anything else, but my friends say that other items are just as good as their pho. 
The interior is clean. It is certainly not the nicest atmosphere, but at least it's cleaner than most Vietnamese restaurants. They have incorporated the sidestreet theme by adding some street signs and roofs within the restaurant. They have plenty of tables to accommodate bigger parties.
The service is hit-or-miss. Maybe about 85% positive? Usually, they have servers who are extremely nice and friendly. The service is quick and they take care of the customers well. However, sometimes, they have rude servers who will not even respond to you even after seeing you asking for help... very rare though.
Sidestreet Pho and Grill is a great restaurant for your pho craving. It will be hard to find other Vietnamese restaurants that are much better this one.",vsZy481c3AVrl1ht-qwMuA,0,0,5,ukqsrGBJLDNPStGxrp-0sA

When we walked in, there isn't a booth at the front or really anywhere to wait but we were acknowledged and seated pretty much straight away. The decor is pretty simple but around the edges of the restaurant they have little roofs and street signs named after Vietnamese food that honour the restaurant's name. 
We ordered the pork and shrimp spring rolls to start and they came with an amazing peanut/ satay dip which went perfectly! The rolls themselves were tasty and unlike others I have had around the valley, they don't skimp on the meat. Yay!
As a light snack we also shared the Grilled Lemongrass beef rice noodle which was definitely a generous portion for the price. The flavours were very subtle so worth dousing it with the fish sauce they provide and it would have been nice if the dish was served hot and with better cuts of meat. I liked the charred, smokey hint to the meat, but there was quite a bit of fat that comes with it, which personally I don't like.
We also ordered a Thai tea that they forgot about. No apology or offer to discount it from the bill, however they did sort it for us straight away and we took it to go.
Just a heads up with the Thai tea: I'm a sweet tooth and like the sweeter made TT's so this one wasn't for me, way too leafy. My partner on the other hand preferred it because of the more leafy, tea-like taste, so depending on what you prefer, it could be your favourite or one to avoid!",Xsyw11gZiltqWL5RvWGKJg,0,0,3,mUsRCPuZPxTywIx3gGao5w

I stopped in yesterday for the first time and I got two large pho for takeout.  One was beef meatball pho and the other was everything--rare steak, flank, meatball, tripe, brisket, and tendon.

The soups were packed in two containers both having the meatballs.  In other boxes, there was the other 5 meats for my combo and scallions, cilantro, and sliced onion.  In a separate bag was a large amount of bean sprouts, some sliced jalapeños, and spicy Thai basil.  There was another box that had the two spring rolls I ordered.

While waiting for my take out, the owner gave me a glass of iced tea to enjoy while I sat there.  I also took the time to walk around and take some photos.  It's a very pleasant restaurant.  Everyone was very nice.

The pho was very good.  The broth was good and the meats were good, too.  The thing I learned from take out is to reheat the soup when you get home and get it back to scalding hot and then divide the portions and add your vegetables.  That would more closely match the restaurant version.

Our Lunch Orders:
01.  Lemonade Soda - $3.00 - 4.5 Stars
- This was absolutely a MUST if you come here. So good, it's actually better than MOST restaurants I order in Cali. I loved it but didn't think it was worth $3.00 for a small glass.

02.  Crispy Egg Rolls (4 Rolls) - $6.50 - 3 Stars
- Definitely was crispy and the inside was decent. At least it wasn't chewy. Just okay IMO.

03.  Sidestreet Pan Fried Egg Noodles w/ Beef/Veggies - $10.95 - 3 Stars
- The egg noodles were crispy and there were plenty of veggies and beef. It was okay, kids liked it. The sauce wasn't salty or starchy like most places.

04.  Bo Luc Lac - $14.50 - 2 Stars
- Not good, beef was chewy and salty. Really wasn't like what we are used to tasting in Cali. It was decent but not for $14.50. At least for that price, the beef should be tender. 

05.  Bun Bo Nuong Xa (Lemongrass Beef) - $8.95 - 2.5 Stars
- Lemongrass Beef was DRY and bland, no flavors. The fish sauce was watery too. Didn't give enough veggies like this dish normally comes with. Perhaps in Vegas, ppl don't eat their veggies like we do in Cali. 

06.  Com Tam Bi Thit Nuong (Pork) - 2 Stars
- The Pork was dry and chewy, the Bi was chewy as well with hardly any meat.  We left this dish aside, couldn't finish it.

07.  Com Tam Bi Suon Nuong (Pork Chops) - 2 Stars
- The chop was DRY and chewy. My friend didn't finish it and only ate the steam egg. I clearly see a pattern here...CHEWY! 

08.  Bun Rieu - 2 Stars
- Well, this dish is definitely not the Bun Rieu we are used to in Cali. The Broth was so bland and flavorless. The tomatoes are normally cooked long enough where they are tender and juicy. These tomatoes were firm.  

LOCATION - A bit far from downtown, located in a shopping plaza.

CUSTOMER SERVICE - Super nice staff.

FOOD - NOT AUTHENTIC at all.  Decent for Vegas but probably wouldn't be rated great in Cali. The foods are decent so if you're super hungry for Viet food, this place will do.

VERDICT - We will probably not be coming back if in Vegas, it's a good option for the locals.  If I'm in the area, I might order the Lemonade Soda!",t_ZPq_AJB0MQs4b-EX56Mg,3,0,3,hOaeo0Sh9P33hLx1AQtUIA

I called in for a take-out order just to save time. When I got there, they weren't done with my food but I didn't mind since I came about 10 minutes earlier than expected. But what impressed me was typically when I would order take-out at other restaurants and my food wasn't ready, I would just sit on the side and wait for it to be done. But with Sidestreet, not ONLY did they brought me water to drink while waiting, they also angled the TV towards my direction so I could watch it clearly while waiting. WOW!!!!!

The food was great and everything was reasonably priced! I've tried several items on their menu including:

Fresh Spring Roll with Grilled Pork: My first time ordering Spring Rolls that had grilled pork instead of shrimp!! To my surprise it's still very refreshing regardless of the grilled meat. I did opt out of the mint just so it's not too overwhelming

Wonton Soup: FYI this does NOT come with noodles but very tasty and filling nonetheless! It comes with several LARGE pieces of wonton so even without the noodles, you can easily consider this an entree. 

Lemongrass Chicken Rice Plate: So much bang for your buck! It also comes with shredded pork skin and an egg loaf

Grilled Chicken with Rice Noodle: basically like the rice plate except with noodles!

I feel like other places have been skimping out and this place does NOT! I order my normal pho tai and the broth is fairly tasty. I did put an extra order in the fridge over night and there was a big chunk of fat but that's to be expected with the bone marrow etc. They also do a good job of packing and separating items to go. 

Dining in was easy and of course we went before the noon o clock lunch rush so that helped as well. The lady provided scissors to cut my daughters noodles (super helpful instead of using a knife and fork to cut) and service was fairly quick.

For the appetizer, we shared the Shredded Pork with Skin Spring Rolls.  I had the small combo pho ($8,50). Broth was very falvorful and natural (no MSG that I could detect). I did tell Ken that our other favorite Viet place, Pho Saigon 8, small portion had a little more noodles which would probably cost them less than a quarter, but will increase the ""perceived value.""

I should add that I'm from SoCal/SGV so I've had my share of great pho. The first time I came here the soup tasted extremely weird and I had to squeeze in lots of lime juices to mask the weirdness. I can't really describe it because it didn't even taste like pho. Came here a second time because we wanted to give it another chance and we really wanted to like this place because it's the closest pho we can get. The pho tasted normal this time but I found a piece of hair in my soup. I didn't even bother telling them anymore since if the hair was in the communal soup to begin with it wouldn't make a difference if they gave us a new soup. Also both times their meat slices had that rainbow appearance and old oily taste. The waitress we had both times wasn't very nice either. I have RBF myself so I'm usually very sympathetic but she was really impatient even though we didn't take long to order or do anything really.

Cons: 
It would be nice if they cleaned the vein out of the shrimp.
Not sure why the meat egg rolls taste a little sour.
Shrimp Spring Rolls sometimes have hardened which means they were made too far in advance.

Time to dig in...  the pho noodles seemed starchy and bland. The broth was a tiny bit salty but otherwise flavorless. There were a few pieces of fresh veggies. 

I know that Veggie Pho can be challenging with regards to taste but I have had it prepared so much better at other places.

4750973,2016-05-24,3,q3YnYPjLuBGRDi_59yTC5g,"Pho a good time, you may want to drop by here (I know I know. Please put the tomatoes away). We decided not to drive all the way to Chinatown for pho and stopped by here. It wasn't my first choice or my second choice. I wanted to try another new one (to us) around the same general area, but it closed at 9, so we aimed the old VW and came here since they close at 10.

It's a modern looking design with street signs inside. No doubt to help those too drunkard from strong Vietnamese coffee from forgetting their table?

So the neat thing here is that you can build your own pho and choose your meats: flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, round steak. You choose 3. I like my meat rare so I ordered it on the side. Just make sure your soup is boiling hot (that darn Pho #1 used to be consistently hot and I can order beef on the side but now it's safer to just order it in the soup so it's still cooked and not raw).

The tendon was cooked till tender and the round steak was nicely cut, as in no sinews but a nice piece of tender meat. I didn't have fatty meat that you have at Pho So #1 now. They used to be lean meats but I think they thought we wouldn't be able to tell the yellow fat clinging to the beef and the fatty oil floating on their soup now. As this restaurant and No 8 proves, yes it can be lean, Mr. Pho So #1 (#2 more like it).

The broth here is pretty good but not as flavorful as it could be. I added Siracha for more flavor. I usually leave it out of the soup if it tastes good enough. BUT, to be fair, I didn't feel the need to drink my glass of water. Usually at their pho restaurants, the msg is heavy enough to make you drink like a camel (and pee like a horse). A hour later I am still not that thirsty.

Overall very friendly staff and the place is very clean (again Mr Pho So #1, your floors don't need to be sticky and neither do the tables. I can't believe I've been eating there since the late 90s). So if you don't want to drive all the way to Ctown, (phogeddaboutit? Uh oh, I've officially tried to steal it from mob movies and the dude advertising for San Gennaro Festival. He and De Niro gonna be mad. My next Yelp review may be written wearing cement shoes.) this is a nice alternative. Oh yes, you can choose a large for $9.50 (?75) or a smaller one for a buck less I think. At least they don't default to large like #8.",xRpAEg0M0azAPuKVg7WtgA,3,3,4,ONjn-BaRKxnLaQ8zJ2dqWw

They did not have two of the fried rice on the menu I wanted so I ordered the Hainan chicken rice, it was a little disappointing.

The ice coffee made fresh when you ordered, gonna give it a good 10 mins wait.  Some other restaurant they made the coffee ahead of time.  Up to this day I still prefer mine make it fresh even it's on ice.

We were staying out in this area and I was pleased that this place had a strong Yelp star rating. So while traveling, it is sort of fun to try out Pho from various shops much different than our own Hawaii favorites. Some of the differences seem to be due to the source of ingredients. Each part of US has different wholesale sources for produce and meats. Some of the difference is due to the cooks and local preferences. MSG use is a good example of this.

MSG: Speaking of MSG. I don't know if they use it or not. The menu and website didn't say 'no MSG' so they may use it. I'm pretty sure MSG was in the flavoring for the veggie pho soup.

Venue: Nice enough shop that was about average as far as Pho shops go. Easy to find. Family friendly.

Food: 

Veggie Tofu:  I had the veggie tofu pho. They asked if I wanted beef or veggie based soup. I wanted the veggie based. The veggies were fine but undercooked because the soup was not hot enough. Usually, the very hot broth continues to cook the broccoli and other vegetables perfectly. The veggie soup base tasted like it was a bullion cube dissolved in hot water and not a dedicated veggie broth. In their defense, it is very likely that this is an extremely low volume item at this shop. Las Vegas is more of a meat and potatoes city. It would not be practical to make special soup for this if few patrons order it. But, the bottom line is that it was a bit of a disappointment. Other Pho shops can make an excellent meat-free soup. Overall it was pretty bland and required some additional sauce to spice it up. It was still 3 star pho.

Beef Pho: My wife got the P2 combo pho. She liked it and said it was 4 stars. We got the small size bowls as they seemed big enough.

We're not likely to go back. But if we do I'll try a different dish. My wife would get the combo again,gladly.",ed-C-BTs9Xp_5pqo32bLAw,4,5,3,x0O4bNDkFSgcU0THq4x3vQ

However, the past few visits I have had here were rather disappointing and upon learning from some of the wait-staff the owner has changed, it is obvious from the way the food is served that things have taken a turn. 

The portion size is entirely different; the meat is sparse and the noodles stick together as if they were sitting in the bowl hours before the broth had been poured over it to serve. The green onion and cilantro garnish has also whittled down significantly.

I'm rather disappointed because the consistency of this restaurant was strong and suddenly, with a a management change, has become like every other disappointment.

My mom & I both ordered Bun Reu. The flavor was good. The only few things that would have made Bun Reu a lot better were:
- Noodles: noodles were undercooked, they were not soft.
- Soup: The soup itself was not hot enough & got cold quickly.
- Tofu: It was a different kind. Should be the one with less stuffing in it. Or maybe cut the tofu thinner so that it wouldn't over power the flavor. Maybe it's just me. Lol

I do like the following though:
- Soup: good flavor, similiar to ones you get in CA or VN.

There weren't many customers since it was past lunch time, but there were several tables that were not cleaned after the previous customers left. It was messy. The service was horrible on top of that and their food, meh. For whatever reason, the servers were acting like they were busy and we were not welcome. Then we all got sick after eating there, which we guessed was too much MSG. Never going there again.",YdFwKLuNkAjYmuPGfBKCEQ,0,0,1,M1ZRhWhKX6SNA95CYgwG9Q

I have tried several other dishes including the raddish cake and eggs, as well as the fresh spring rolls. I have zero complaints. This place is spot on and the owner is very friendly and cares about his restaurant a lot. This place is very convenient for people who live in Summerlin and are not very keen on driving to Spring Mountain. For tourist looking for good pho, this place will not disappoint!

5811064,2018-05-22,0,q3YnYPjLuBGRDi_59yTC5g,"Vietnamese person eating at a Vietnamese restaurant and it went okay? I ordered a broken rice dish and all of my other friends ordered pho. Funny enough, my meal came out first. Usually pho is the fast prepped one while the rice dishes come out later because of the grilled meat...

My meal was dry overall. I ordered C3, Com Tam Bi Cha Thit Nuong. The rice was dry since it was long grain which is usually different from the traditional short grain. The meat was dry since it felt like it was sitting around from someone else's previous order. It could've also been because I think the meat marinade had a little lemongrass in it. The soup and the fish sauce that was given along side it to ease the meal was blah.

Overall, I didn't finish my meal and I didn't ask to take it home. I'll try to come back when I'm in the area, but I'll stick to eating Viet food back at home in California.",cbzM6kE426dOaTvj9NPqww,0,0,3,hr6LxWRuxwCJSR6V6lMpyw

The curry chicken had rich curry, spicy heat and slight sweetness balanced together so you could appreciate each of the flavors. Cucumber and tomato were fresh & especially enjoyed pickled  cabbage. The combination Pho had tender and flavorful tendon, steak, flank, brisket & tripe in a flavorful broth, which I enjoyed all of it. Most Pho broths at other restsurants are too salty to finish; just would suggest serving with warmer temperature so it stays hot through the meal. Basil and bean sprouts were  fresh & crispy. Rice and vermicelli were cooked just right and everything served in generous quantity.",WXC0mnnlpFB0OAke3wi0Jw,0,0,5,5NKlS3dD6Lr78eJUD8mEqQ

Normally, when you have rice noodles with meat it comes fresh. Not so here. BTW, the server gave me a refund and that's why they're getting 2 stars instead of 1.

I was seated immediately upon arrival and provided a menu. Since I had reviewed the menu on line I knew I wanted to try B3 which is Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio (rice vermicelli, grilled lemongrass pork and eggrolls). My dish was dropped off and that was the last time I saw the server. The noodles were very good and the fish sauce as well which I'm sure is purchased. The grilled pork looked pre prepared and was small pieces, not like the grilled strips of pork I've had elsewhere. The eggrolls were disappointing as well. I ate what I could and then had to wait for a check which I finally got by waving at the cashier.

Service was pretty good. Our server was attentive and food came out at an expected pace. Prices are comparable to other pho restaurants.

Everything from Pho to Hu Tieu to Bun Bo Hue to Com Tam was excellent. Brought the family after my trial runs and wife concurs. We are self-described experts in Vietnamese cuisine. 

Key to the noodle soups is the broth, which was full of flavor and richness. I was impressed, with fantastic food, courteous service, and casual, clean setting. Now we have a great go-to place around the corner. Hope this restaurant succeeds and stays around.
