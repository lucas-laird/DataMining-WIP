Pollo, carne asada, chorizo etc. They're DAMN GOOD though! As expected of a place named ""The Burritos""! The Green and Orange are AWESOME. Be sure to try it since they add some great kick!

My favorite burrito is the CHILE RELLENO BURRITO. Even though I love meat, this thing blows the other burritos away! You could say it is a vegetarian burrito. HOWEVER IT HAS A GIANT CHILE PEPPER INSIDE IT!!! It basically goes from one end of the burrito to the other.

Chuck Norris himself can't beat that -  even with his Roundhouse Kick.

You must try it once!",cw1cO7zGarYJmIkdGdNdEg,0,0,4,pQ6i5ZFp9fKPH-mdEc55bA
597895,2010-07-02,0,ROAhwL6lyogjyD3BdmFzYA,I stumbled on this place while driving by. I had an awesome chile relleno burrito. I haven't seen this since I was in Mexico. It was very tasty. The place is set up like a down home Chipotle in that you can see everything and choose your burrito fillings. The restaurant is very authentic and the staff are friendly.,oenzGqlVMNpVq_Qrn6iAjA,0,0,4,1YqTiGOOIHYFnyIlmVHtRA

I thought the burrito was very decent and so was the taco supreme. Can't think of anything negative to say about the place considering it's a cheap neighborhood restaurant.",wnPceOm6cRKty5UPtN-3pg,0,0,4,lyf4_DesB8LimKJRTIqbgQ

I tried the super burrito and my man had the soft tacos both were so mild with no real flavor. 

Maybe I'll try something else soon but for now Los Burritos, 2 stars.",kLQmqXOB3-71jR6STtVZ2A,0,0,2,sayBCLIXoYmUlBcLzv7KAA

I stopped after a day of working in the area. I'll be back. It's got that Subway sammich style you request what goes in. They have a unique spin with some of the options. i.e. you can add Rice, beans, or Potatoes (cooked W/ chorizo) to your burrito. It seems to be a family run operation and they are all very nice & friendly. The order was super quick. The interior is crisp and clean. I Would've stayed. Especially since you can refill your Horchata.",ZlPIH7AlzBc2rDlK7Cas9A,4,2,4,e0C2isjUO5SI6pdn4wcLkg

Roland wanted Mexican food, even though I wanted to go home and eat an Asian Pear and a banana.  He was just too hungry and decided to go to Los Burritos, which is right across the street.  The place is quite small, will several booths.  The food are all on display, kinda like what you would see at the buffet.  This is what we ordered:

-Chips and salsa ($2:50): Decent, but I am used to other places giving free chips and salsa...O well.  

-Shredded beef plate, which includes eggs, potatoes, refried beans, corn tortilla ($6:50): They were all room temperature, except for the eggs.

-Side of guacamole ($.50)-I thought this was cheap.  I used the chips that came with the chips and salsa and dip it in this small side of guacamole.

-Pork Tamale ($2)-This tamale was pretty big compared to all other tamales that I have seen.  It tastes a bit different too.  By that, it is the flavor of the maiz.   It has like a couscous texture, and a bit saltier than the other tamales that I have eaten.  This was our favorite actually.  Different, but in a good way.  

We only finish 3/4 of the food.  Roland's eyes were too hungry compared to his belly.  I just got out of the gym so I didn't want to stuff myself.  Everything tasted decent, but will only come here for convenience.",5wT0vDycEzgq95yVCZ60Aw,1,1,3,PWe2lgzyphDjEXGIyPTDiQ

I just moved in the Silverado area, and I'm glad I looked it up on line to see what the reviews were.
I will be going to Taco Tuesdays!",Z0GA65zCMI4ska4iHRr8Bg,2,0,5,TuMa1IrFYdYyaXQ6s2CIBg

4336858,2010-11-23,0,ROAhwL6lyogjyD3BdmFzYA,"OMG let me just say three words, Carne Asada NACHOS! They are bombdotcom!  I love walking into this place, the employees are nice and are willing to take my order.  They have great deals going on like three tacos and a drink for $7.25, or stuff like that but I usually stick to the nachos!  I literally have to have this every other week.  My friend suggested this for me a while back, and I wasn't too impressed until I added the spicy mayo sauce.  It's like a mexican version of the yum, yum sauce = AMAZING!  I love how my nachos are still crisp even with all the toppings on top, and the vegetables are fresh! Once you're there get a stamp card, the lady was so generous that she gave me four stamps.  Get 7, and you get a free burrito.",0guV-tXB82pi2stV7a5g5Q,2,1,4,VmF4a92tZkv7Yerq0UAgKw
4586586,2017-11-19,0,ROAhwL6lyogjyD3BdmFzYA,"There's a legendary Mexican food place in San Jose called La Victoria that is known for their addictive orange sauce. I had it once while visiting NorCal and have been craving it ever since. Fast forward a couple years later when I'm in town visiting Vegas and I'm brought to this Mexican food place called Los Burritos. I'm advised to try their Orange Sauce. Much to my surprise, they carry an exact duplicate of La Victoria's famouse orange sauce! I explain my excitement to the very friendly owner and she says that not only does she know the owner of La Victoria, but that they grew up in the same town in Mexico. What a truly surreal experience. Not only do they have thus addictive sauce but their food and service is great as well.",Hw2mU1OGp0TbchI44EzVtw,0,0,5,OLnTayXbJI2lOVywQwptBg

My brother and i got the 3 pack with 2 burritos and a drink for 6.95 and an extra drink. It was tasty too, I dropped it a star cuz my horchata was not sweet at all it tastied like there was no sugar at all in the machine! 

Food was great, service was great, the horchata wasn't but it was great nevertheless. I will be back again soon. Thanks Yelp!",3yPrXlvbECGKHSZTy9usWA,0,0,4,zmfZ8qV7asEJH1nuIcsMmg
