They were voted best burger during a recent street food throw down so I knew it had to be good!  I went by the Writz Beverage building where they were parked for the day and waited in a short line to order my food. I stepped back and prepared for the wait to get my burger. To my surprise ( and horror) The guy running the truck outside reached in to the warming oven and pulled out my burger!!  So keeping an open mind I thought well maybe it was fresh anyway. I head back to my truck open it up take a big bite and found out I could not have been more wrong. The burger its self was thin and tasteless. If it had not been for the brisket the burger would have made it in to the trash. Let me just point out the whole premise of  what the Gourmet food truck movement is all about, fresh quality food and a good value.......",hXJJzlIe4pKs3px3grVJ6w,0,0,1,lQlh7glvR5fj911uLa7giw
1007324,2011-07-28,0,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"I had the Ahi sliders, the buns sucked and barely any sauce. I was not impressed at all, I typically read reviews before I try a new place or food truck but this time didnt. Once I ate one of my sliders I had to read the reviews on Yelp which I completely agree with. I hate to say that I will try LBS at Red Rock now from the taste of my sliders. Also the girls from the office had the original and veggie patty, they all were not very impressed. Lets just say We will not be having this truck again. OH and its was expensive, $7 for 3 tiny Ahi sliders that were thrown together?  No thanks!",h1u8E_xG4qb6FF5ibW3UFg,0,0,3,r8BwK3zmkMI4Pnq_E1fF7g

LBS Patty Wagon was back downtown the other day at the Western Cab location and I swung by to get some burgers.  Either they are afraid of the wind or the people down there, because the order window was boarded up when I got there.  But they removed the board and took my order. 

This time I tried the urth slider which I would not recommend.  Dry and with a weird pea flavor.  Even if you are vegetarian and have no other choice, don't do it!  Run away!  Just get the fries.  And the fries are spectacular.  Huge chunks of sea salt and they give you lots of fries.  Make sure to get the fry sauce.  It's not particularly healthy but it is oh so good.

The perfect slider was perfect as always and the classic slider was great as well.  You can get three sliders, fries, and drink for $9.  And they have diet Snapple!",iAevEfcmtCr2cpd6IRqnTA,3,2,4,2N8uDp-3jNNm6rJtwAMAEw
3519621,2011-05-03,2,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"The LBS Patty Wagon ""Perfect Burger"" ($7): beef patty topped with gruyere cheese, bacon, oven roasted tomato, frisee, red onion marmalade, LBS sauce and herb mayo. Sounds good, doesn't it? I thought so. In reality, the patty was dry, devoid of any juiciness, thin, hard, and overcooked. It was like one of those nasty burgers from McDonald's (except twice as expensive). The bacon was fatty and undercooked, although I did enjoy the flavor from the red onion marmalade and sauce. With the proliferation of food trucks in the valley, I doubt I'll ever be back.",C2C0GPKvzWWnP57Os9eQ0w,5,3,2,UW8RSBalD5WxUOJe1ZE8ag
3597951,2011-05-07,0,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,first time at their truck. I had the Ahi sliders and the were pretty good. I would go to 3.5 stars. I've had some better but i would eat these again. next time i would try a burger.,L8cvMZLWmM4qWTl9SkxJ8g,0,0,3,sAE9_VyT44l23NeukGIheQ
3877114,2011-03-25,0,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"Finally had the chance to try them at the Throwdown with Fuku and Slidin Thru.

I ordered the Perfect burger, which I thought was pretty good. I would give it 3 stars, but the bun was a weird texture. I was expecting the texture to be soft and spongy, but it was so weird I can't even explain it. To top if off the prices are pretty pricey, which was $7 just for a burger. Sorry, but you deserve the 2 star rating.",loOoIBFpGbkx8WaIpQndiA,1,0,2,2fLA47DZCk-A0wZ9xC8NXA
5014915,2011-05-08,0,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"After seeing the truck driving around in town often and never going to the Red Rock restaurant I made a point in trying at the Costco Food truck event. I had the Texan burger for $7, It has a burger with Brisket, Slaw and BBQ sauce. For $7 it is fair or you can get with drink and fries for $9.

The Burger itself was ok, too much dry bun, really thin patty, decent amount of brisket. Defiantly better than a fast food burger but lacked a lot of depth. I think if they had a thicker patty, and a better bun they would be in the 4 star maybe 5 star range.",hkSiQAfl6w3882JJQzRTlQ,0,0,3,eV3hYhvuybtDQloNBzxHvg
5529761,2012-10-01,0,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"The owner of my company had the Patty Wagon roll up at our place for a couple of hours treating all the employees to lunch.  I am a BIG fan of the restaurant so I had high expectations.  It was a set menu of either a cheeseburger, urth (vegetarian) or a hot dog with a drink, choice of side (iceburg lettuce salad, mixed greens salad, chips or fries) and a chocolate chip cookie as well.  

The cheeseburger was a no brainer.  I was hoping to get as close to a perfect burger as possible but the only ingredient I could get was gruyere cheese :(  Still a decent burger but it doesn't do the restaurant any justice.  It was a bit smaller than their home joint serves and try carrying the burger, salad, cookies and drink back to the desk.  Now you know why I don't do trucks.  Salad was fresh and the cookie was fine.    

If I see the truck, I'll probably order but I won't seek it out when I can go to their Red Rock location for a much better experience that I can wash down with a beer or two.",8DEyKVyplnOcSKx39vatbg,2,4,3,1PnJpiCr_HpOH3SwFgBwXw
5701504,2011-03-09,0,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"Tried the Californian and the Perfect yesterday and I was pleasantly impressed! The burgers were mini, but packed full of flavor. I definitely want to try the Ahi and the Shoestring fries next time.

I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is curious. The only downside is the wait, but it is well worth it. I hear they have a restaurant too! Hope I will be able to hit that up sometime in the near future. 

The price is not too bad either!",p7uRG-6cO-NQc8JQjoqAYg,0,0,4,6QqdcEOQNb6p7XBbdIIDgg
5918921,2011-04-05,1,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"Maybe my expectations were higher than normal for the LBS Patty Wagon, being a mobile kitchen extension of the sit down restaurant inside Red Rock Casino.  But after trying the ""Perfect Burger"", I thought it was just an okay burger, composed from more gourmet ingredients (i.e., frissee, gruyere cheese, herb mayo) compared to the other food truck burgers/sliders offerings.  At $7 it was a fair value, as you can obviously get less for your money trying other food choices from other food trucks.

The taste of the burger was somewhat disappointing for me.  Maybe that has a lot to do with the all-beef patty being cooked well-done, which is a major turnoff for me right there.  But the combination of the beef with melting Gruyere Cheese, Herb mayo, Smoked Bacon, LBS Burger Sauce, Frissee, Oven Roasted Tomatoes, and Red Onion Marmalade, which looks really good on paper, ended not doing anything for me.  Hell, even Carl's Jr's Original Six Dollar Burger was a better tasting and more ""perfect"" burger in my opinion.

I probably will not seek out the LBS Patty wagon in the future. However, for those that are into the budding food truck culture of Las Vegas, I say give it a try and decide for yourself.  For all I know the dry patty was a fluke, and their burgers are supposed to be more juicy.

The best part of the LBS Patty Wagon experience are the sample nitrogen chilled treats.  It is definitely worth trying, especially since it is free.  Their Dessert Slider made with macaroons is a concept that I think needs refining, along with the flavor profile.

2 Stars.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,4,3,2,3HPsSrpzIRqH89iY2RD14g
5944472,2011-05-02,0,FVospBWddyS7IpbEuFSqgQ,"So I FINALLY tracked down this truck. It seems like its always in Henderson!? Anyways, there were 4 trucks hanging out together this afternoon: slidin thru, sno-cone, foodslingers and lbs. I bee lined for lbs cuz I was starving! And I ordered the perfect burger. Oddly enough, NO WAIT! but all the other trucks did have a wait, which made me a bit wary of lbs. Sno-cones I understand, it was hot today. But slindin thru and foodslingers were more busy, and I wondered a bit as to why lbs was so unloved. Even so, it was a yummy burger with bacon, gruyere, arugala, an interesting ketchup and (yuck!) sundried tomatoes. If you didn't already know, I like my tomatoes cold and fresh, any other way is disgusting. I'm looking at you places that serve steamed tomatoes for breakfast! Anyways, all in all a good decent burger, but nothing to innovative. I think I'd prefer fuku over lbs.",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,3,iZwu0UtmeFFbcbLExMKXXA
