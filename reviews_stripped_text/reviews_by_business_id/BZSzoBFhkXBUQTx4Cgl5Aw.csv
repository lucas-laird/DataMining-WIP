Huge menu, kids eat free Sunday through Thursday, and a quiet alternative to the huge casinos. Went back a second time during our Vegas trip. Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner items were available when we went both nights. 

Service was quick, which with hungry kids was VERY important. Prices were very reasonable. Much better than inside the casino, so make a short drive or walk from the MGM or Tropicana over here.

The breakfast menu is pretty large and the food is decent/average. The fruit substituted for a meat choice was 4 small chunks of melon on a separate large plate.  I liked the cinnamon roll French toast a lot, but wanted 2 pieces, which she said was not an option. She could bring me 2 but it would be the same price. There was nothing a la carte listed on the menu, though my mom ordered just eggs and English muffin. I'm not sure what she paid, but they served it on 2 plates. The pancakes and waffles were good, as were the omelets, and I asked for poached medium expecting I'd get poached easy but at least the whites would be totally cooked, and that's what I got. The dinner included mediocre garden salad with some brown leaves, the ""grilled cod"" was chewy and the veggies were fresh but cooked weird - very salty and smoky and sparse cauliflower heads and broccoli spears. All on a plate 2x too big. The pies are ok but not better than grocery store. The staff is the worst part - super fast and obviously not interested. All 3 times whatever the 1st person said they wanted to drink, they repeated back: ""so 4 coffees?"" or ""waters?"" It was disconcerting and kind of stressful.

1397816,2016-07-30,0,BZSzoBFhkXBUQTx4Cgl5Aw,"This place is a cute, homey 24/7 diner, across from MGM Grand, attached to a small hotel. Just watch out for tacky Mexican-style paper decorations hanging from the ceiling, and very blustery A/C even on chillier spring days. There is a lighter-option section on the menu, and the back of the menu includes a ""55 plus"" section with affordable healthy options for the 55+. However you don't need to be 55+ to order from that section (I sure am under 55 and got something from there!). But really, all the prices at Coco are very affordable with just about nothing over $20. We ordered:
-tuna salad. Very generous portion, more than worth it for the price. The tuna wasn't too creamy and rich so it's a good healthy option.
-chopped steak with cheesy bread. The steak was not the best steak ever, but for the price, it was a very good value. I wasn't too thrilled with the cheesy bread, perhaps next time I'll order steak only. 
I will warn you that service is a bit slow considering how simple the dishes are. However the staff are friendly and easy to find if you need something. They also have an impressive pie collection that we didn't try yet. Anyway at any rate, Coco Bakery is a great place to recharge your tummy before a fun-filled day out in Vegas.",DPcJ_uf07HgSP-f-noeV_g,0,0,3,Ar6-9QLK8W16z2ULt0DQRw

First of all, the location was perfect.  The wife and I stayed at America's Best Value Inn right behind this little gem.  You couldn't have a more conveniently placed eatery.  Not only that, its located within an easy walk from the ""Four Corners"" area of Las Vegas Ave and Tropicana.

Secondly - its open 24hrs a day!  Craving breakfast at 5pm?  A t-bone steak at 4am?  THIS IS YOUR SPOT!

Thirdly - The food here is delicious!  The menu is varied and extensive...from cinnamon rolls as big as a plate to prime rib and everything in between!

Fourthly - The prices!  By Vegas standards, this place is a BARGAIN.  Breakfast specials from $5 on up?  I'm ""all in!""  The prices here are very reasonable, especially when your not in the mood to binge on buffets.

Fifthly - The service.  Every time me and the family dined here, the waitstaff was very attentive and friendly - just the way it should be.

Really... there's not much more I can say about this place other than, if your staying in Vegas and want good food, a varied menu and a great price... this is your place!  Enjoy!",zWLhTbc_Q0R2800Q5EPSKw,4,0,5,IPn5DMvKbyw1OBPe7ZQBdw

I am vegan so finding options to eat is not always easy.  The two older women who work at dinner time were extremely sweet and helpful.  I was able to create a salad that wasn't on the menu and it was delicious! I think my order may have been the most complicated because I was inquiring about different vegetarian options to check if they were vegan.  They even had to call the owner to verify some of the items lol.  Well at the end my salad was huge and filled with all my favorite foods.

It's a good reminder of how big of a shift the area can be just off of the Strip. 

As for the food, it's a chain bakery / diner. I enjoyed my cinnamon roll French toast. I asked for my bacon crispy, and it was cook just how I like it. The waitress was very pleasant and efficient.

I was so hungover. I hate Coco's. The one by my parents's house is disgusting. But I was hungover and unfortunately it was Sunday so our only other options were expensive ass brunches. No thank you. 

This Coco's needs to hire new hostesses. It was so busy on St. Patrick's day morning and the hostesses were clueless. Maybe they were exhausted from partying the night before too? I dunno. lol. There was this busboy that took charge and he pretty much seated everyone. I used to be a hostess myself. Shame on you girlies for not being on your A game.

Zenayda was a rockstar and kept the coffee coming. I ordered a veggie omelette and holy guacamole it was HUGE. I of course am a fatty and hungover so I ate all of it and it was so good. Props to Jose in the back. 

We had to pick up someone from the airport so she got us in and out of there super fast. Poor girl she had such a busy section. I watched as super picky people told the hostesses they kept wanting to sit in her particular section (I think she had the most booths). Why do you people like booths?! Booths are disgusting and uncomfortable gross.

Anyways this place was a lifesaver. Drank enough coffee for three days, ate enough omelette for three days, and got out of there in like 30 minutes lol.

I remember getting the San Diego Sunrise.  BLUH!! What a shitty mess.  Ground chuck? Is that what you call that?  Chipotle Holindaise.....That was pathetic.  Avacados? Well, hard to mess that one up.  The whole thing overall was a culinary wreck.  The avacados wouldn't even stay on the patty because of the nasty slippery ""holindaise"".

The next day we came here I went for a classic eggs, toast, sausage and pancakes. MUCH BETTER.  There's that basic borring food I was looking for!!!  At least I could eat it and finish it, unlike that nasty stuff from the previous day.

Can't believe any reasonable functioning person would give this place 5 stars, 4 stars, 3 stars or 2 stars.  And yes, I've had the unfortunate experience to have eaten there in the past. All this place has going for it, is location, location and location.  Those staying at the nearby Motel 6, American's Best Value Inn, or Howard Johnsons, might be lured there by the convenient location.

Cleanliness not the best, food mediocre to poor.  For gawd sakes, if you are looking to eat, there are SO MANY other places nearby (not on the strip) that are more worthy of your money and dignity and taste buds.

At a minimum go west onTropicana a few blocks to Einstein Bagels, or north on Koval to the cafe at Super 8.  

This place is really not worthy of your business, they are just taking advantage of their location and sinking to the lowest common denominator...

I turned on Yelp, and BAM there's Coco's right down the block from our hotel. I called immediately and they were crazy busy (apparently everyone else was also hungover). It took about 15 minutes for me to place an order to pick up since it was so loud and they had just changed their menu.

15 minutes later, we dig into our well deserved meal. It was perfect. I ordered the corned beef hash and poached eggs. The corned beef hash was much better than I expected. It had flavor (although it could've used some hot sauce) and the eggs were poached nicely too. It didn't come with any toast so I ordered a couple of biscuits. They were not good. Avoid if you can. Otherwise, my friends all dug into the pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage and there were zero complaints.

Coco's was reasonably priced and delicious. If I'm in the area again, I wouldn't mind stopping back in for another hungover breakfast cure.",lccsIaHyqWcvhzhLYN8LOg,2,2,4,kqGCX6tHOpsWQEXwmqjDww

This isn't anything fancy or amazing like the strip. It's  ""let's eat on the cheap and then go to bed"" food.

The burgers are ok. -try the bacon burger
Same with the omelettes - the something Swiss one
Avoid the steaks -frozen, under-seared, and chewy
I didn't try the pie. But if I did I guess apple would be my goto.

Service was fast and efficient, a short wait it seems if your party is small, and the coffee gets refilled on the fly. My cup never went dry which is service that I like.

Upon walking in I was greeted by a awful smell which was extra strong in the restroom  but I figured a bad smell would not discourage me from eating good food. 

The atmosphere reminded me of a old diner from the 60 ' s but it was missing the friendly waitress with the pen behind her ear. Instead our waitress was straight to the point not rude but not at all big on conversation.  If I could rate the menu alone I would give it 5 stars everything looked delicious and the descriptions made you think you couldn't go wrong with any of the menu items. 

I decided on the mouth watering charbroiled Turkey burger. The burger was a frozen turkey patty and the bread was supposed to be wheat but looked like a regular bun fresh toppings though.  The fries were very thin and not bad but not good either. My friend had the pancakes which she said was ok. The turkey bacon was cooked perfectly I was told.

They have an old lady that comes in and make desserts for them daily. These desserts seem to win Awards at various functions, so they are supposedly very good. 

After many rain delays and finally making it to Vegas, I was hungry, and this place is 20 feet away from my Hotel. I went in and automatically realize that they were a Denny's style place.  You know I took the time to look at all of the deserts in the display case with the accompanied awards won for the dish. I asked what the specials were and we're giving three different specials. The staff was really nice and actually gave me the pros and cons of each special. I was told that they were known for the breakfast and their burgers, but the burger that was on special was really small. Of course I went with the breakfast special that was essentially $7 for 2 eggs, 2 sausages or bacon, 2 pancakes, and choice of country potatoes or hash browns. 

It was a lot of food and a great value. All in all, it was decent eating at a great price. The pancakes had great texture and was very big. Overall the breakfast was decent, but nothing to write home about. I can't give them more than three stars until I try their desserts. I saw that they had a homemade banana cream pie for $8 for the entire pie, but didn't wish to eat an entire pie by myself...that night!

I like finding less touristy options and this west coast chain was situated off the strip so it wasn't super crowded. I had the fresh bananas and oatmeal while my boyfriend had the lumberjack breakfast. We also split a piece of coffee cake. I was disappointed in the coffee cake. It seemed too dry and had a funky taste. I'm not sure if it was over baked or was missing an ingredient. It was just different.

When I walked in I was initially turned off because the restaurant was old, didnt smell the greatest, and looked like it was in desperate need of restoration. 

The waiter came to the table to take our orders, he was very nice. 
As I looked over the breakfast menu I was overwhelmed by all of the tasty options they had to choose from-it was very hard to decide. 

I landed on the banana, walnut, and caramel pancakes with eggs. 
These pancakes were TO DIE FOR. It was so good that despite being full I was still eating. The pancakes alone get 5 stars from me.

Unfortunately the eggs weren't good. I had to add lots of salt and pepper to get them to a decent taste. And I noticed everyone else at the table adding salt to their eggs.

This location is older, possibly in the original state since they built it. It looks old inside and out, but not disgustingly old. 

I was seated immediately and my waitress came fairly quickly to take drink orders. I think there were only 2 waitresses at 8 pm and there were lots of people at tables. With that said, our food came out within 10 minutes and was hot, fresh tasting, and the portion was huge. Probably could've shared mine as I hardly was able to finish 1/2 of my food. I ordered the San Francisco Sourdough burger which came with fries. It was so good! The burger was well cooked and was perfectly paired with sourdough bread, which is my favorite. The burger came with a huge pile of crispy fries.

The service: the older gal that brought our drinks was grumpy and carried them out on a tray with a rag sitting on it, which was a turn off. The waiter made up for it though. He was friendly and attentive. 
The food:
My husband and I both ordered the basil egg white omelette ( I got the fruit as a side and my husband the hashbrowns). It was very bland despite having onion, tomato, spinach and feta. There was no basil taste what so ever and was greasy. The fruit was good though. 
Our children ordered the banana walnut pancakes. They enjoyed them a lot. My son,who loves sausage, didn't eat it and said it taste gross and was too greasy

After a long period of confusion, we realized that half of the line-up was for people trying to pay their bill.  I had to use Assertive Crystal and get us seated before I pulled my hair out.  Apparently Assertive Crystal scared the befuddled hostess and made a few waiting patrons angry, as I suspect we were seated too early.  Oops.  None of this should have happened.  Clearly the current staff are not cut out for this madness.

I had a very plain breakfast and somehow the toast wasn't good.  They put way too much butter in the center and the crust was a bit too hard and dry.  I didn't think you could screw up toast but it was the first time ever that I wasn't happy with it.  Everything else was acceptable and my spouse enjoyed his omelet.  His glass of orange juice was massive.

This little place right across from the MGM is a little secret. I came here Christmas morning and was warmly greeted at the door by the manager. He walked me to our table, taking note of my party and specially assigning the largest and most private table for us. Immediately after I sat down, before I could even get comfortable, there was a very happy bubbly staff member who came to greet us as well. Afterwards, I probably don't really know who my server was because there were a total of 3 who greeted us and periodically came and checked on us to see if we needed anything additional to our order, but my review for this particular Coco's is about their excellent customer service, warm tradition to coco's standard trained staff and of course their food. Their hash potatoes was excellent and warm. Infact the server brought it out saying ""some of yours was already done and the rest weren't, but I didn't want it to sit there and get cold so I'm bringing you these first, is that ok?"" so she brought it out first. That is SMART and absolutely considerate! When all our food arrived, we enjoyed a good hearty meal. 

The host also sat us down with recommendations, for what taste the best and what was best priced. I think this Coco's and this staff is worth my review, and a stop for anyone who doesn't really feel like some more cold/warm buffet and who want some hot food (just make sure you let them know you want it when it comes off the stove).",2H0kfZ_Q30WGaDaeu3Lb5g,5,1,4,M4h6V2UX1k1Dhvs1AOJh-g

It was late, and we were hungry.  I ordered chicken fingers with french fries.  The fingers were more breading than chicken and obviously came from a bag in a freezer, and the fries weren't very good either.  Liberal amounts of ranch dressing helped out.

Our server Donna was very friendly and pleasant.  The atmosphere was welcoming and pleasant to dine in.  Everything came out as ordered and quickly. 

The restaurant was so good that we had to return on the morning of our last day in Vegas before our flight.  The restaurant was busy but service was still above and beyond. We were seated immediately upon entering and the server came right over and asked what we would like to drink.  

I ordered the Western Omelet with fresh fruit.  It was a large portion and so tasty.  The fruit was extremely fresh and juicy. 

I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone in the Las Vegas area.  It's open 24/7.  You can't beat a restaurant that is reasonably priced with delicious food and great service.  Eating off the strip will save you a bundle and in most cases the food and service is much better too!",HLRIqBpLKZ3TuAemWmXzlA,1,0,5,QOmOOsgTrJkBCrTNZ7yCfg

5524802,2016-01-02,1,BZSzoBFhkXBUQTx4Cgl5Aw,"I stopped in here for take out breakfast for 2 this morning before heading back to LA. The experience that I had which should have been simple ended up being so bad it's almost laughable.

In case you need a reminder of the basics when working in the food service industry, just read this review. This covers most everything. 

1. Greeting customers
When I entered this place, I walked up to the counter where you pay. There were 4 employees standing directly behind this area chatting with each other about non-work related things. They looked at me but did not say anything for what seemed like forever. 2 of them left and the other 2 proceeded to chat about a stain on their hoodie (a conversation which also included the hoodie being placed on the counter to show the other worker). While I stood there feeling awkward, one of them looked at me with a very obviously irritated look because clearly I was interrupting their personal chat time. After more awkward waiting, someone finally came over to greet me. 

2. Workplace knowledge
I asked a question about one of the menu items and was given wrong information. The basic question involved what sides were included with the menu item. I apologized because I thought I was wrong, but then after ordering I googled it and found out that I was right, so I went and ""changed"" (aka corrected) my order.

3. Paying attention
When I received my order, I was not given the coffee I purchased. When I asked for it, the worker was unapologetic and didn't even remember how many I ordered. 

4. Basic food safety/proper cooking 
When I got back to my hotel and was eating my food, I noticed that the sausage was totally pink inside (see image). I'm no chef, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to be like that..
In addition, I was only given utensils for 1 person. Total fail. 

The only good thing about this breakfast was that the pancakes were tasty. However, the soggy bacon and undercooked sausage don't allow me to say that the food was good overall. 

I don't want to say that all of the employees at this location are terrible, but the 6 young ones that I encountered this morning definitely do not do their jobs appropriately at all.",HV4X67GH9kLUKhSJzpWicw,1,0,1,J5xDOjR8wqxQNZ_xHA294w

The Breakfast Special is EXCELLENT value for $4.99! My teenage son got that - and when we come back we plan to ALL get it next time :)

The kids got the smiley face pancake... Because of the nuts in it, my daughter didn't love it, but she still ate it.

I got the Tomato & Mushroom breakfast from the Lean menu -- only 190 calories!! Whoooo hooo! ;) But, in hindsight it wasn't the best choice or best value, since I'll likely be hungry again soon, with all the Vegas walking about the occur! ;)

Definitely a great spot to bring the kids and not spend a fortune! Very happy we found this place (thanks to Yelp reviews!) on day #1.  We will be back - probably tomorrow! ;)",2yGQ2zhdHMPUzt72p1g1MA,3,2,5,WMQlk0FCS45qY3jSZCNWuw

5722810,2013-06-11,3,BZSzoBFhkXBUQTx4Cgl5Aw,"Coco's is probably one of your better bets in Vegas for an affordable breakfast in Vegas.  Aside from the ""B"" Food Safety Restaurant Inspection card rating (at the time of this review) posted at the cashier, this place seems to be pretty good and pretty affordable (no crazy inflated pricing) .  They even have an awesome deal on burger's and fries for $4.99 which is pretty damn hard to beat anywhere in Vegas.

This became my regular breakfast joint considering that I could get a bowl of quality steel cut oatmeal with blueberries, bananas, milk & brown sugar for a few cents more than a small cup of water with oats from the local Starbucks.  For a decent breakfast such as pancakes or french toast, it pretty much beats anything you'll find at your local casino in regards to value. I mean it's not ""gourmet"" food but it gets the job done at a fair price.

The service is pretty good considering. I never had any problems with the waitstaff, hostess or cashier.  This will be my regular go to breakfast joint when I feel like saving some cash in order to splurge on other cool stuff in Vegas.",hmT6ygPjklrNEjvA2FYuVQ,6,3,4,IraFC_kPoaDvsxv3fYk2Kw

Okay, no, just no.  

I pulled up and thought, okay, looks like an older coffee shop type place, and I like those ... NO.  NOPE.

Upon opening the door there was a funky smell, I thought maybe the sewer backed up, but then I was seated and felt light headed, and realized that smell was the additive in natural gas.  I got up, ordered pie to go, and the hostess seemed bothered by this ""fast"" choice of mine.  I'm not trying to die in Las Vegas, so, yes, it's fast.  I mentioned to her that the odor was awful, there were four people in the place besides employees, and I don't know how they could stand it.  

It took me a while to get my head to stop spinning from being in that building.  The woman insisted it was some sort of cleaner they were using in the kitchen.  Funny, but, no.

The pie was great, I ordered coconut cream, but turned out to be banana cream, and it was spot on delish!!!  That's why they got the second star.

My fillet was raw down the center of it and my zucchini was so hard it tasted like it went straight from the fridge to the microwave and on the plate. Very unimpressive! 

That was the food.
Now, the real disappointment happened when i tried to enjoy my slice of Pecan Pie. Like, what happened? I think it's old.... It has to be old. I'm gonna post the picture i took of the pie. You be the judge. I was in a hurry to get to work. My best advice, check your food before you leave. Cocos is normally one of my favorite places.
