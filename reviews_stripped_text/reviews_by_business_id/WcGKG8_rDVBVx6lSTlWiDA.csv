Clearly they were already cleaning up but I just wanted to make them aware of the posted hours since I just drovw about 20 min to get here and as he walks up to the window finally um holding my phone in my hand to show him he just keeps repeating himself that they're closed.. no shit dude.. your not the brightest are ya??

Waited around with multiple other people who had also ordered for pick up who had the same issue. Some of them just ended up walking out because the wait was so long. Manager says they are understaffed but no real apology. Most places would at least offer a free drink for the inconvenience.

Didn't get out of there until 11:55. Food was delicious as always but placing a simple order over the phone for pick up and how unorganized  they are is ridiculous.  Total chaos inside this place and they really need some organization skills when it comes to go orders over the phone.

All I could taste after only finishing half the order was SALT! You know, the kind of taste in your mouth that won't go away.

The enchiladas were so heavily sauced, I guess I should have asked them to hold back on the sauce, but this being my first time to Cafe Rio on Lake Mead I decided to eat the dish the way they prepared it for others. The chicken was super dry even with all the added medium sauce they smothered it in. The combination of beans, rice, and sauce all created this big runny blob of salt-laden goo.

I ordered a vegetarian burrito, which the menu/sign claimed came with guacamole.  Unfortunately, not only did I not get the guacamole, but there was literally nothing but rice and beans in my ""vegetarian"" burrito.  No onions, peppers, napolitos, or any kind of vegetable. No tofu or veggie-meat option. Just rice and beans with a small sprinkling of cheese on top.

I returned to the counter to ask about this, and they gave me about a tablespoon of brown guacamole.

All of this was $9.

When I went to grab a drink, the machine sprayed liquid on me, and wouldn't turn off - continuing to overflow... I ran to the counter to grab something to catch the running beverage, and to let the workers know what was going on... the response was ""yeah, that one does that. It'll turn off eventually.""

1376644,2017-11-13,0,WcGKG8_rDVBVx6lSTlWiDA,"This Cafe Rio is in a great location for lunch and they tend to move people through the line fairly quickly. I was most impressed on my last visit. Despite a manager and two employees having just walked out, the people at the counter were working diligently to make us all happy.

Here's my otherwise typical Cafe Rio review (also fitting for this location):

I love Café Rio! It is my usual haunt because there are so few restaurants that offer healthy fast food. All their ingredients are fresh and made immediately right before your eyes. 

I always get the salad with just beans (no rice), lettuce, pico de gallo, and creamy cilantro dressing. I have them put the 440 calorie tortilla on the side (so I can make quesadilla quarters for a snack or dinner side dish later in the week) making the total salad calorie count less than 400 calories. I can often get 2 meals out of the salad. Don't be afraid to ask for more of each ingredient. I ask for them to put in 2 scoops of black beans (I'm mostly vegetarian) and as much lettuce and pico as they can fit. They always generously oblige. Even after a long workout (I'm a long course triathlete so a 75 mile ride or half marathon training session aren't uncommon), the salad is filling. There is nowhere else I've found a salad that completely fills me (though Cheesecake Factory comes close). 

There are several perks for regulars. Download their app and scan it at the register to earn $10 off every $100 spent. They also announce special offers on the app--like double-point days. Another perk relates to the receipt. Most receipts ask if you'd like to complete an online survey. The survey takes about 5 minutes. Once done, you receive a numerical code allowing you to get free chips and salsa or a free dessert. You do not have to combine these freebies with an order. Sometimes, I stop by my neighborhood Cafe Rio just to pick up a snack of free chips.",7hlF-dR-m-e8nFZMWao8cQ,1,0,5,9CLaG6yBq0v7XhBneVOQxw

We get the food back home, and my Chicken quesadilla was made with beef or pork, not chicken. We call them to tell them, they say we can come in and get a new one. Pack up all of our other food, hoping it stays warm while we have to drive back to get the new one. This whole process took almost an hour. An hour to get dinner from a place up the block. It took less time to get fondue the other night! What was supposed to be a nice and easy dinner turned into a complete mess. By the time we got back home my husbands burrito had to be warmed up again and our queso had melted through the container it was in. At this point we weren't even that hungry anymore. Sure, they gave us a free soda and a free item next time we come in (which is more than Cappriotti's did when they screwed up and were giving out free food to everyone but us just because their register wasn't working) but dinner was ruined at this point.

That's really all you need to know right? In the battle for the best burrito place in Vegas Cafe Rio is the big cheese- and that's because they actually have QUESO. Creamy, delicious, liquid cheese will fix just about any problem a restaurant has. Here is a short guide to Cafe Rio

1. Get a burrito- yes they have other things, the other things are not as good as the burrito.

2. Sauce spicyness +1 - the sauces are all extremely mild so whatever level of spice you would usually get you probably want to kick it up a notch

3. Enchilada style- this is where they douse your burrito in sauce and cheese before toasting it. Essential. 

4. Acceptable meats in order: pork, steak... thats it. They have shrimp and chicken but they are nowhere near as good so best to avoid

5. Chips and Queso- this ties the meal together. The chips are actually pretty decent and while the queso isn't white (the holy grail of cheese dips is white queso with jalapenos) it is still by far the best option in town. 


A negative reviewer laments that they put guac outside the burrito... well if you ask them to put it inside they do, not sure Cafe Rio should be punished for people not knowing how to order food.",s-591-mtIyP7F1Lffw98jw,5,3,5,NdOWFeI8FrzTrSceuAYAnQ

Coconut shrimp taco isn't my thing. It's filled with a few shrimp & heavy on "" toasted coconut ""

The cilantro was like all stems . I hate the stems too stringy for me. However I'm a huge cilantro fan so this was a bummer. 
Rice is super dry.  As well as the black & pinto beans 


Got a sweet pork burrito for my husband at home as well. 

Pork was dry & had over cooked / old pork  in it . Some of it was still edible : 

& a free ninjo quesadilla. Kids 6& under

& was amazed by the horchata drink I originally got for my husband who loves this drink from cafe Rio. 


Unfortunately my husband wasn't a fan for the first time. He said it tasted extremely watered down. He loves it normally it's very very sweet.

2077476,2016-08-19,2,WcGKG8_rDVBVx6lSTlWiDA,"This is a fairly new Cafe Rio, located on Lake Mead and Buffalo in a small shopping center behind Mickey Dee's. I love the fresh made tortillas here and believe it or not the salads are my go-to item. They are massive and extremely filling. They line the bottom with a tortilla, and then add meat and your choice of toppings. I usually always choose the pork barbacoa which is sweet shredded pork and it is so delicious, I just cant bring myself to order anything different. The dressings for the salad are creamy cilantro and vinaigrette which are both tasty, but I prefer the cilantro which is perfect for dipping leftover tortilla into.

Other items include burritos, nachos, tacos and enchiladas. The burritos can be made enchilada style where they douse the burrito in sauce and cheese then run it through the oven. The red enchilada sauce is really tasty, and I usually get it on the side to dip chips into. Speaking of chips, they give you a brown paper bag FULL of them when you order chips and salsa or queso. The queso tasted like melted American cheese and I didnt like it, so I threw most of it away. Not worth its almost $5 price tag. 

My last visit I tried the pork enchiladas with rice and pinto bean and I was not too impressed. The enchiladas were pretty skimp on the meat, although there was plenty of sauce and cheese, and the rice and beans had no flavor.

Today, I was at Cafe Rio picking up a quick dinner. The first server who made my tacos was very pleasant, asked me about my day, and took my order correctly. The second server who added my lettuce, etc. was where the service fell short. 

I am allergic to avocado. It's a strange allergy, and it is one that I take a chance on every time I eat a Mexican restaurant and almost every other restaurant. I liken it to the peanuts allergy. You can look ahead and see if it is in something. 

I ordered sour cream on the side, but some guacamole had fallen into the sour cream dish, and the server had scooped that into the sour cream container. I asked him to redo it that the guacamole could not touch the sour cream. He obliged but not without a sigh.  

When I got up to the register to pay, my side of sour cream was missing. The cashier asked this same waiter to do a thing of sour cream again. She brings one over with guacamole in the container with sour cream. I said I could not have that in my sour cream. The server, again, mixed the two together. The cashier did not seem to understand my point until I made a point that I needed a new container. I finally got a new container, but it was uncalled for.

Today we had a lady making our meal that seemed annoyed with me for asking a few questions about getting a plain cheese quesadilla. $8.75 seems a bit stiff. She returns from the register to check price ala carte which was only .50 less. She began making a salad for me and I asked her to please change her gloves from touching register. Now she's really annoyed. 
They used to give me 1/2 of two meats. Now they charge double meat. Also any extra sauce on a salad is additional. When did they get so scotch??

When l was eating l start reading the ticket and saw that they charged me for two tostadas so l went to the cashier and l told him l didn't have two tostadas it was one and one side of rice with one taco, he apologized and said oh sorry, then another guy came closer and tells me that they only owe me a few cents because l order that  a la carta or something like that so the taco was over $6.00 so my total with the taco and the side of rice was $7.35 l tought it was ridiculous to charge over $6.00 for one taco so l show him that the price for one taco was $3.00 something so he walked away and said that the orice was in the computer.
So l ask him to wrote everything on a paper.

I LOVE Cafe Rio, so when they opened one close to me I was so excited that I went opening day!

There was something different about their tortillas....they tasted....stale. They were a bit stingy with the meat. 

Came here several more times in hopes they would become like the henderson and centennial ones I love. 

I watched several times how they make their tortillas, they cook them early on and pull them from a bag instead of serving fresh. They are beyond STINGY with the meat. I asked for extra meat (which you have to pay for) and they legit gave me only 2 TBS more!

I watched the worker actually take some back from my bowl. The rice is always a gamble. Either you get the regular rice or there's a chance the cook will dump an entire container of salt. I always order a shredded chicken salad, regular portions, and they always give the bigger lid. This place, however, can easily place the smaller lid on. Overall, just avoid this Cafe Rio specifically. The only reason I'm okay with giving this place a one-star is because they gave us a free salad because of their screwup.",j9uv9WXob0742QncWVsN7Q,0,0,1,z-a3MPSX2Lk-lDRmGIfP5A

4014408,2015-04-09,1,WcGKG8_rDVBVx6lSTlWiDA,"Ah, it's OK.

Apparently this new Café Rio took over what used to be a bead store (yes, a store with bead buying galore), and now it's one of the most frequented lunch spots in that area.  Located right behind McDonald's it certainly is in the hubbub of patrons.

But come on, it's Café Rio.  It's basically the same as the other ones around town, and a competitor to that other build your own burrito/taco/bowl/salad place Chipotle.  Coincidentally, right down the street on Lake Mead near In N Out Burger is a Chipotle.  So it comes down to personal preference.  And if you're looking really hard, pricing and soft drinks.

I'll admit, they make a darn fine salad.  If you make it right, it's like a burrito that internally combusted.  It's huge!  And probably my go to from now on at Café Rio.  A salad starts with a warm tortilla on the bottom of the tray.  Then it is topped with your choice of meat (I go roast beef or pork), beans (I go black (but I sometimes go back (to pinto))), and cilantro rice.  Then you get a healthy (I go heavy) portion of romaine lettuce, and any of their other sauces/salsas.  I opt for some corn, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream, and a small scoop of guacamole.  Then top that bad boy with some fried tortilla strips!  I also choose the creamy cilantro dressing to go with my salad.  A bottle of hot sauce later, I'm in good eats land!

But this salad will set you back a hefty $8 -9 depending on your choice of meat.  Not the cheapest option for a meal considering it doesn't come with a drink.  But does Café Rio have some good drinks!  Not only is Coca-Cola product served, you also get your choice of some Mexican classics!  Horchata can be had to your refill hearts content.  So, a basic meal with a drink will cost you roughly $10 - 11.  Not the most value, but if you play it well you can get yourself a honkingly large entrée.  Think extras!  

Taste is OK.  The tortillas at Café Rio are actually pretty good when they are warm, seems to be fresher made than Chipotle.  I do like Café Rio's creamy cilantro dressing, but I prefer Chipotle's vinaigrette a whole lot more.  Plus, Chipotle edges pricing out a tad by being $1 - 2 cheaper per entrée depending on what you get.  But Chipotle serves no Horchata!  But they do serve Corona!  So really, it kinda evens out.  Just boils all down to personal preference, or which one you feel like eating that day.

If you choose neither of these for some Mexican food, you will probably end up at Roberto's.  That's not a bad choice either.

The staff was nice and quickly got the orders processed. The girl that took my order let me try the new green sauce which was actually pretty good, so I ordered a side of it. 
My food was still good as usual. I ordered a chicken quesadilla that was huge! Chunks of white meat chicken, cheese, and home made tortilla! I always order chips & queso. The queso is always piping hot as well as chips. Their chips are always light, thin and crispy. 
I had the limeade, and added additional lime syrup at the drinks station. Just the right tartness and sweetness. The mint really sets the drink off as well.

Eating the same meals daily is easy for me, but every once in a while I need a change from my boring chicken breast or lean ground beef. Café Rio is just one of the options I have when I'm looking for something good, cheap, and clean.  This Café Rio is conveniently located by one of my offices and it's never busy.  A typical order for me is 2-3 servings of their fire grilled chicken with nothing.  The serving size is really depends on their employees.  Some scoop a lot, some don't.  It really doesn't matter to me just as long as I'm getting about 10 oz. of meat.  You can really taste the quality of the chicken when it's prepped as plain as can be.  The chicken is pretty good and beats my chicken breast in a taste test any day.  

TIP:  Café Rio is also known for their huge burritos and bowls.

Fresh tortilla, tender chicken, salad, and some beans
That meal right there is fit for a Queen
I top it with some creamy cilantro
And always ask them for extra que-eso

Ok, this is a new Cafe Rio and it's semi close to my house. I legit love it, and will carb out on their fresh tortillas any day! I'm loyal to the fire grilled chicken salad (+1$ for grilled chicken) it's topped with your choice of beans and rice, chicken, salad, tortilla strips, queso, and cilantro with a side of guac. I get it sans pico though. 

All of the items on the menu are delicious, their steak is never over cook, nor is the fire grilled chicken. Most of them items can be ordered ""wet"" but I never opt for that.

They have a variety of drinks including horchata, jamaica, and mint teas as well as the fountain drinks.

I really like the customer service here, the workers are all super nice even when gringas make a big deal over not having green sauce ready THAT MINUTE. Lort forbid they had to wait 3 minutes. HMPF.

She didn't say anything because it's the lunch rush and we had waited long enough. $1.00 for a side of pico that I wanted on top of the tacos. Another $1.00 for a side of enchilada sauce. $6.99 meal ended up to be almost $9.00! Go thing Taco Bell is in the same parking lot.,A2LvWiQhkgZIe8Md_TXCbw,2,1,2,KdNir7jZrP2w5MWhTPLwDQ

I can tell they have high turn over because they have different people working there all the time.  Maybe if they hired the right people it would make for better customer service.  The taste of the food is the only reason I gave two stars.  The consistency of the quantity of the food is poor. I pay the same price for the salad, but it is pretty much all tortilla and lettuce now.  Not that I need huge super sized portions, but just the standard portion I'm become used to at other locations.  Lastly, because it's a place I always enjoy, one of my friends gave me a gift card for Cafe Rio. When I went to pay, the girl behind the counter told me it wasn't working and that I needed another payment method.

5193777,2018-01-30,3,WcGKG8_rDVBVx6lSTlWiDA,"Like the other reviewers, I am a fan of the menu offered at Cafe Rio. This, and many other Las Vegas locations, seem to be lacking direction, management, training and an overall concern for their offering. This restaurant is no different - except for a few very helpful/friendly staff - the location was very dirty, fountains were empty, floors, tables, and condiment areas were very unkempt and dirty. The wait was longer than 30 minutes and the food was terrible. 

After taking nearly 40 minutes to get our food the fire grilled chicken in our burritos was burnt. It was pointless to try to fix it now that our lunch hour was over. 

The unfortunate thing is that this is the attitude and demeanor of almost every Cafe Rio in town.",Q7IoE5m2heQKThuVq3SYFA,3,1,1,aiYa9uNb19V8pRPFnsmGdA

Hey it's Monday and the Bachelor is on, I had to get home with dinner before it started! Soo I got there and the place was empty and I told the girl at the register I ordered food online but I was there a little early. The lady was so confused and said they never got an order and that she had to get the manager. I was starting to doubt myself and thought maybe I put the order in for the Sahara location. Soon the manager (I think) came out and then they finally realized yes I was there a bit earlier than it said my order would be ready but I had already explained that to them. They found my order and started working on it (keep in mind there was no line forming or anything, no one was there) Then I got my food and went home. When I got home there was no dressing or guacamole in my salad. No one likes a salad without dressing, especially at Cafe Rio because the dressing is the only reason I even order a salad. So I was a bit disappointed. This experience just was really awkward and strange. Then on top of it my order was wrong. I really prefer the Sahara location.",ShmDxFOPf2IhLbY54-OVNA,2,0,2,afxhnm4MxJs0X8bTiGQGag

So when I went to Café Rio And I got the enchiladas it comes in a Pie pan which was OK. I did not really enjoy the quality of food at all it was almost as if somebody that had never tried Mexican food real authentic Mexican food created their menu and on top of that when I went into the store it was not inviting the staff weren't very friendly and the whole place is kind of disorganized and chaotic on the assembly line so for this I would not recommend going here I had an overall bad experience and did not enjoy it,D3XxyNOy8b_1484Oi1eYOg,0,0,1,MvpBEFg_-4tLKtcSOkA1zA

Every time I go to this location it's never busy, even at lunch, and I get to order right away which is a great thing! I always get the veggie burrito, enchilada style with no cheese or sour cream (for all my fellow vegans that don't want to miss out on the all the cafe rio deliciousness!). The vegetarian burrito comes with double rice, double beans and free scoops of guacamole which always leaves me super stuffed after my meal! 

The staff is very friendly, there's this one lady that is always such in a radiant mood every single time I see her that it makes even the grumpiest customer there smile! Lol
