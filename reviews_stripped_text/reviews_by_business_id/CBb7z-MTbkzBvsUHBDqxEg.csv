We were wrong.  The ""steak"" portion consisted of a small, unidentifiable cut off beef with ac strange flavor.    The lobster tail looked dry and had an awful appearance and texture.  It didn't tastequite  as bad as it looked though, but I would still characterize it as mediocre at best.  The mixed vegetables appeared to be out of a can.

Even though the price is low, the special is totally not worth it.  It is nothing but small portions of bad food, and you have to wait a long time in line just to eat that garbage.  The only positive about the entire meal was that the cocktails from the bar were pretty good.

Avoid the steak and lobster special at all costs.",yNiowknnVglktoo2AY5WuQ,0,0,1,pEr9RIe1y6-qhwttEfMQYA

615547,2014-04-03,6,CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,"Allow me to jump over the food review and skip to the end of my visit to where I was surrounded by security guards, the restaurant manager, and the casino manager. They were ineptly attempting to figure out how to handle an irate customer (me). As you can see, this was not a pleasant experience at a well-run establishment. Nope, it was a horrible evening at a piece of shit crap factory. Now back to the beginning...

THE ORDER: I ordered the ribeye with garlic mashed potatoes, garlic green beans, and added a lobster tail. My wife ordered the same, except with the sirloin. One daughter had a sirloin, and the other had a chicken panini with soup.

THE QUALITY: My daughters' meals were alright. The lobster was alright. The mashed potatoes and green beans were alright. My steak and my wife's steak were NOT alright. The ribeye was ALL FAT. Okay, that's an exaggeration. I was able to find approximately 4 bites on it that I was able to eat. The rest was fat, and I could not eat it. I have attached a picture of it. I understand that ribeye is a fattier cut of meat. It is one of my favorites. It is the cut I get every time I eat steak. This steak was not a cut that should have been served to anybody.

My wife's sirloin was inedible due to chewiness. I don't have a picture of hers, but just imagine a piece of meat with 5 bites taken out of it, and all 5 bites spit back onto the plate.

THE COMPLAINT: I asked a server to speak with the manager. About 4 minutes later a guy walks up, and asks what the problem is. I tell him that my ribeye is inedible due to the amount of fat. He simply says, ""okay"" and walks away. The table of 4 just seated next to us overhear this and ask about the bad steak. I show them my food and they are immediately interested in the goings-on.

THE ESCALATION: About 3 minutes later the pompous Japanese manager reappears and says, ""I will remove the lobster from your bill"". I pick up the uneaten steak and say, ""How about you remove this from the bill. I can't eat it"". He goes into an explanation of how they receive the meat and cut it there, and the cut you get is the cut you get. I then pick up the steak and tell him, ""You need to tell your cooks that when they pick up a cut of meat like this, do not cook it. Throw it out. Do not serve it to a customer"". I said ""This piece of meat is shit"". He told me if I speak to him like that, he is going to leave the entire bill with NO reductions and make me pay the whole thing. I say, ""F*#$ YOU"". He says ""Okay, here's your whole bill. Pay it"". I place it on the floor and tell him ""That's where it's going to stay. I'm not paying it"". He says ""I'm going to call casino security"". I tell him ""Alright"". The table of 4 just seated next to us witness all of this and get up and leave, saying that they can't believe a restaurant would treat a customer like that.

We watch the pompous Japanese restaurant manager walk to the hostess booth and use the telephone. A few minutes later two guys from casino security show up as well as the casino manager.

THE RESOLUTION: My wife decides to jump in and save the day. I take our daughters and stand in the lobby area in order to remove myself from the situation. My wife listens as pompous Japanese manager tells casino manager that I devoured all the food on my plate, then screamed profanities at him in an attempt to get a free meal. None of that is true. She walks the casino manager to our table and shows him our plates of food. He then instructs the restaurant to remove our steaks from the bill and tells my wife that I am banned in the future.

THE VERDICT: This restaurant is a fine establishment with excellent food and an extremely courteous staff is what I WOULD say if it were true. Unfortunately, this is a piece of crap excuse for a restaurant serving garbage on a plate with a staff who make Hitler look like a fun play date. My wife says she would have rather dumpster dived for her meal. DO NOT EAT HERE. I can't emphasize that enough. DO NOT EAT HERE. But DO stop in briefly and tell the pompous Japanese manager ""Hee Haw"" because he is a total donkey. I will send a special gift to anybody who goes in, says ""Hee Haw"" to the pompous Japanese manager, and reports it on this review.",1R_4y_HrssWQn41JMZASBg,8,4,1,zxHbmlgctPIiYY63gCMaSA

We ordered the steaks medium-rare. When the steak and lobster arrived, both steaks had large completely uncooked portions. This food passed through two points where it should have been noticed: the cooks and the server. Both neglected to notice. Then, when we cut into our steaks, we saw that they were completely raw--through and through. I should also say that the steaks were far inferior in quality and smaller than any I've ever had. They look more like beef intestines that are pressed together into an extremely thin slab. It was not even the color of steak; it was a drab gray color. It is even more amazing that the meat was not cooked, since it couldn't take more than a couple of minutes to cook these sorry excuses for steaks. Our lobster tails smelled foul, so we did not eat them. When we presented the problem to the manager, we were offered $4 off each meal. When I said that they should be refunding both meals and be happy if we don't call the health department, the manager asked ""Is that a threat?"" Additionally, when I went to the restroom, the manager came to our table and yelled about my not being at the table. Seriously? Is this how you treat customers? This is a ridiculous place with ridiculous service. Oh, and I almost forgot to mention their typical clientele type. I saw a guy drinking straight out of a steak sauce bottle here.

So they called the manager which was extremely rude to us and she said you guys can sit in your original seat or wait 35 minutes for a bigger table, we should have left but we were starving so we went back to the little corner and fit somehow. The girl who took our order of drinks was very nice and sweet, but when I asked her where our waitress is she showed me the lady behind her and the lady said I'll be right there and just walked off. She came back and forth a few times and I said excuse me but she ignored me. When I finally asked the drink girl to call her she said I'll be right with you again and walked off once more.

Service was fast and friendly once we were in and also - just to make that clear - the lady at the entry desk was friendly, polite abd funny. She kept all queuing guests in control and knew exactly what was possible and what not

We waited about 35 minutes and 2 of our 3 plates were cold. We sent them back with the manager (I had him feel my sandwich and he told the waitress, ""It's legit cold"") and they rushed out new meals for us. It was okay overall (their original barbecue sauce has a very weird/strange taste), but my mom was not happy with her meal. So they removed it from the bill for her. I would've also expected something for mine, but there was not. No big deal.

It used to be that casinos could sell good food as a loss leader, to get people to play the games, but it is clear that the specials themselves are now a cash grab. 

The $12.99 steak and lobster was terrible. 

I've seen better looking steaks in the freezer at Dollar Tree, and I wish that was an exaggeration. It was thin, leathery, and flavorless. 

The lobster tail is an ounce of lobster meat, attached to the shell on the outside, and tasted like it was flash frozen after pre-cooking, and reheated in a microwave. The saving grace was the melted butter, which allowed you to choke down the rubbery lobster meat. 

The mixed vegetables were exactly what you find in any frozen peas, carrots, and corn bag on your grocer's freezer.

The potato was, well, a potato. 

Not only will I never eat at this Tony Roma's, but I won't ever eat at another Tony Roma's either.

The Cal and Main St. were all booked up for a Video Poker tournament, so we flipped our comp'ed room over to the Fremont.  The second night in, we ended up eating at the Tony Roma's for the Prime Rib special.

First off, Tony Roma's is pretty busy.  We had to wait 30+ minutes for a table (and this was at 5:30pm).  The decor is very dark and while there are a lot of patrons, we were all pretty spread out.

All three of us ordered the Prime Rib special (since that's our thing to do when we go to Vegas).  It comes with a baked potato and mixed vegetables.  I didn't try the horse radish, but the waitress and my parents said that it was very strong.  The quality of the meat was about on-par with the Market Street Cafe, but maybe a bit less juicy.  It was okay, nothing too impressive.  What I really missed in comparison with the Market Street at the Cal, was no rice and there really wasn't that much au jus.

Instead of the free cherry jubilee (at the Market Street), we shared an order of the dessert sampler.  This is where Tony Roma's regained a star.  The sampler consists of a red velvet cake, apple tart with ice cream, and a brownie with ice cream.  In one word: yum.  I enjoyed all three of the dishes tremendously and they definitely did not scrimp on the portion sizes.

All in all, if the line is too long at the Market Street Cafe, I wouldn't mind coming back here for some prime rib.",_iwEegZrea12vujkjp06Mw,0,0,3,nyzqHJiaVklGw1OlZFq1EA

Upon arriving at Tony Roma's inside of the Fremont Casino we had to snake all the way towards the back of the casino and saw a line waiting for Tony Roma's special.  Little did I know the term 'special' was las vegas local slang for ""stupid tourists, come to me, come to Tony Romas and freely waste your time and money""

I knew better, my wife and mother in law they gave it a try.  I went with the buffalo chicken sandwich and fries and a bowl of the french onion soup.  The soup was ok, but the sandwich sucked and so did the fries.  I waited for the steak and lobster arrive and when it came, I laughed.  I've seen shrimp larger than the lobster that came with the steak and I've also seen shoe leather with less gristle than the steaks that came out.

For a place like Tony Roma's, I expect a bit of quality control when it comes to cooking their meat and plating. I ordered the steak and lobster special and when it was served, the vegetables looked like they were just thrown on the plate and the steak looked like it didn't rest very much as there was a giant pool of liquid under the veggies (could have been from the veggies too. Not too sure). The lobster was cooked alright. Nice and tender, but for some reason, was missing that richness I love in lobster. The steak on the other hand was a total miss. I ordered it medium rare and it came out decently cooked, but was all kinds of dry. It was actually pretty hard to stomach. But what can you expect for $11.99. I feel like they're just pumping out steaks so QC isn't as high as going to a normal Tony Roma's.

Simply do not eat here. If you are looking for a cheap meal in Vegas, just go grab a burger or something of a more pub fare restaurant. Do not be fooled into thinking you will get decent or even so so steak meal for a great price here.  Dirty tables, uncaring servers, wait times between water/drinks, etc are long, and horrible food is what you get.  We ordered an appetizer platter (cheese sticks, hot wings, bacon/cheese potato skins), and I am not kidding when I say they were exactly I mean exactly like something from a microwave.  You will get better apps from a microwaved frozen meal actually if you go for a higher end frozen product at the store.  I ordered the ribeye for $22.95.  medium rare. Came out well done. I mean not a shred of pink in the  meat. completely gray/white all the way through and tough.  Sent it back. I mean had it been a little pink, I would have ate it. but had to send it back.  What I got back was unbelievable--- the new ribeye looked like ahi tuna, literally seared lightly gray on both sides and COMPLETELY raw in the middle.  Sent my whole dish back telling the server to kill the meal and I would not eat here.  Serve  just said, 'Can I offer you some ribs ?... as I assume they just have a vat of pre prepared ribs they can slop out quickly.  I opted for nothing, hands down would not pay for anything here. My wife had a filet which was tough as a sirloin. She opted for the blue cheese melted crest addition.  Don't do that, what you get is a giant luke warm blob of white stuff that tastes like a gooey blue cheese like substance and ruins the steak should it happen to be remotely enjoyable.  Beans, potatoes, garlic mashed, all were of public school cafeteria quality at best.  Goal of this joint is pure volume, heard em in and hear em out, they don't care about their service, quality/taste of food, or what you have to say judging from most reviews.  Its a gut fill at best for someone low on budget but even then I imagine there are better options. I would eat at ANY fast food joint before here.  The only good thing was my meal was off the receipt so I didn't pay for it and I took $70 off the casino here at the craps table and made the waitress fetch me 3 free drinks in the process.  So I win but never again will I set foot in this joint.",x9F-0llJQREJ6aMX87OEgw,2,1,1,P0uPLRPdt87dKR0nzJ9xsw
1770270,2016-11-15,0,CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,"After eating out at a Ruth's Chris Steak house and not thinking the food was quite worth the price the night before (over $100 per person for dinner), we decided to take advantage of the $8.99 prime rib special while hanging out on Fremont St.  
Well, you get what you pay for sometimes. 
When we were seated there were two police officers talking to an elderly gentleman because he did not have money to pay his bill.  I think it would have been better if he had been escorted outside to finish the conversation, but it went on for at least 20 minutes even after another patron offered to pay his bill.  
Meanwhile, we had no service.  I understand completely servers not wanting to come over amid the situation, but then WHY seat us if you're not going to serve us???? 
After the man was led out, a waitress finally came over to take our order.  Over 30 minutes later, we still did not have food.  Another server came over and gave us refills on drinks which was very thoughtful.  However, when I asked him if he could check on our food, he got irritated and walked away while I was still communicating. I was trying to explain to him that two tables next to us arrived AFTER we ordered and had already been served.  I was not rude at all, but he did not want to hear it. To his credit, he is the only server who refilled our drinks on multiple occasions.  Our waitress did not fill our drinks once.  She came over to check, I think, once.  However, our drinks had just been replaced by the other server--the one who ignored my question about our food arriving.
The food, ironically, arrived minutes later.  It was good.  We had never been to Tony Romas before, and the food was pretty good and amazing for the price. 
When we left I did communicate my frustrations to the manager who was very nice.  By then I was frustrated.  Even though I was clearly annoyed at the poor service (and I was pissed that the server ignored me when I asked if he could check on our food), he was kind and patient.  I planned on one star, but bumped it up to two for the nice manager.  
If you're broke and NEED to eat here, feel free to do so.  My time is worth more, so next time it will be a more expensive place just so my time is not wasted.",RGezGxhPbG8SNZyms-WfeA,0,0,2,ebnkLWHZqoQTEw4CHzZA-A

Prime Rib, a small baked potato and mixed vegetable And you know what? For the price this was pretty good. Yeah it's $8.99 but it's just what you'd expect for the price.

It was 9 pm,  and we still waited about 25 minutes for a table as the place was very busy.

They skipped us, but when we brought it to their attention a few minutes later, they apologized and sat us immediately.  
The food came out almost faster than our wine from the busy bar, and as I said before, I was pleasantly surprised.  I was expecting a hockey-puck steak and a rubber piece of lobster, neither was the case.  I ordered my steak medium-rare, it came out more medium but not big deal (my dinner companion also ordered medium-rare, and his was perfect).  The lobster was cooked perfectly and was a decent sized tail.  All of that came accompanied with a baked potato and mixed vegetables (they were frozen, machine chopped mixture of peas and carrots  liked you'd buy in a grocery store).

We settled on Tony Roma's because it wasn't too expensive and we really just wanted to eat.  The host told us 30 minutes even though half the restaurant was empty.  They page the numbers overhead so you can go wander in the casino and not worry about missing being called.  We didn't have to wait 30 minutes, so I guess they were just playing it safe.

One server brought us water and silverware, but then our actual waiter didn't show up for about 5 minutes.  Asked for recommendations for drink selections, he wasn't very helpful.

When you're at what you think is a nice sit down restaurant and they give you mayonnaise in a packet you should turn around and leave.

Food came out quickly but again, you get what you pay for.  I've had better food at TGIFriday's or Olive Garden.  I ordered the ""Cheesy Burger"" which had 3 or 4 different types of cheese and it was fine, nothing spectacular.  In fact there was almost too much cheese, and for a girl from Wisconsin it takes a lot for me to complain about too much cheese.  I could barely taste the burger.  Also I asked for no tomatoes and got tomatoes.  Fries were standard, nothing special.  My husband ordered some type of chicken sandwich with Jack Daniel's sauce.

It looked like we had an hour wait because of all the other people that were ahead of us.  Turns out, we only waited 25 minutes.  I was surprised at the amount of time we waited.  We ordered our food and it was only a 20 minute wait!  Well, there's a reason why the wait to be seated went by quickly and why we had our food ready quickly - it all tasted like S**T!! Tony Roma's probably (by the taste of things) had everything cooked and prepared by the time the dinner rush was to come in.  They probably just cooked a lot of ribs and other popular dishes well ahead of time and when customers ordered those dishes, they probably just heated it up.  We ordered ribs and french fries!  Our fries was cold - not room temperature...cold!  Our ribs were dried out with barely no BBQ sauce on it - I had to add the BBQ sauce that they had available on our table.  Save yourself some $$ and don't waste it here.  It was definitely not paying $20.99 for a full rack of ribs - this was the worst food I ever had at a restaurant.

I forgot to mention that our waitress was nice but the other workers like the bus person was rude.  He even stopped to cough at our table in front of our food without even covering his mouth or apologize!",SDjiW-OWsMq6O5qojkmIlQ,0,0,1,dVEYySP50qu87y-D0lHHhw

You have to wait 30-40 minutes to be seated, but IMHO that's likely put in place by the Fremont St. casino that's no doubt subsidizing the cost of a dinner literally 1/2 the price of anything else on Tony Roma's menu: ""Oh look, Gladys. It's gonna be 40 minutes before they seat us. What to do? Hmmm, these slot machines look like they might be fun..."" At any rate, downtown Vegas at night has plenty to do and see while you're waiting.

We got back to the restaurant's lobby (located DEEP in the casino) near the appointed time, waited a few minutes, and were seated. The waiter was friendly enough, and the food was pretty good: yes, the veggies were obviously the prepackaged frozen kind you can buy at any grocery store and the unwrapped baked potato is served without even being cut open, but this is what you get for $11.99 for steak and lobster, and neither is a deal-killer. The steak itself was tasty (if smallish), and the lobster was très yummy!

If you're looking for a late dinner for a great price (our total bill was less than $40, including drinks and tip, for a meal that would have cost $100 or more anywhere else in Vegas), this special is hard to beat.

We show up to the restaurant with a party of 8. To our surprise we were sat immediately... Now we know why. We sat for about 15 minutes before we were able to order drinks. Another 20 minutes rolled by and we still didn't have service. I finally got up and approached a manager and asked if we had a waiter coming. He said ""I'm sure you do"" and turned around. Strike 1.

Our waitress finally arrived. She said ""what does everyone want to order"" she took our orders and walked away. We didn't see her until she brought put food out 45 minutes later. Completely out of water she never attempted to refill. Strike 2

We ordered the 11.99 steak & lobster special, chicken fingers & fries, bacon Mac & cheese, and the rib sampler. My fries were actually as cold as the ranch. The best thing that was ordered was the Mac & Cheese. The steak & lobster were so rubbery it was unbearable to eat. Now we weren't expecting much for this price but I didn't know steak could possibly have this type of consistency. Strike 3

We were never asked how the food was, our waters & beers were never refilled &  even after seeing the majority of food still on all the plates our waitress never thought to ask if everything was ok. I'm not sure if they just thought we were tourists but we are actually locals and all in the service industry. And to top it off the gratuity was already added... Insanity. 

When we were leaving I expressed my disappointment to the manager & all he did was smile & say ""have a nice night"" And to top it off after expressing these feelings a few of the servers were laughing & highfived . 

I will have a nice night because I now have the knowledge to never return.

Now let me ask you a question: when have you ever been to a store and been all that excited if you saw a big cut of steak for $3? Or a lobster?

Before we packed our Vegas bags, I commented to my husband that while there, I wanted to find a cheap lobster dinner. Some wives probably ask to be taken out to a nice lobster dinner. I wanted a nice dinner too, don't get me wrong, but I knew a cheap lobster dinner could be found and I wanted us to find it.

We were there less than 48 hours when dinner found us! We had been walking around Downtown Vegas and seen signs on the Fremont Hotel for an $11.99 steak and lobster dinner. I pointed it out with excitement. Unfortunately, we weren't hungry! But....after a couple more hours strolling and dancing, our appetites caught up and it happened to be between the hours the special was being served!

We had a 30 minute wait and we were not alone. The waiting area was packed! We were finally sat and our server (George) dropped off menus on his way to take another order. He returned not long after with a smile, even though I'd watched him scurry from table to table in the interim. His section was slammed and one booth was pretty impatient about not having received their bill yet. We decided we weren't in a hurry and placed identical orders (lobster and extra rare steak). I added a side dish of garlic green beans to mine.

Bread service came. A plate of Promise (buttery spread) packets came with it. A serious mound of fake butter! We ate our share until the dinners arrived.

I don't anything nice to say about the flat piece of steak I received, except that it was very rare and it wasn't bad dipped in butter, but mine was mostly fat. Husband ate all of his and said it was about what he expected. We both agreed the lobster was better than expected. They were tiny tails but they were tender and well-seasoned and the drawn butter coated the bites nicely. My green beans were actually terrible. Rubbery and not much garlic to be found. For the meal we received, the excellent service, and the cost, overall I would say we found a great value here!  ($28.40 total)

At the time we were there, most of the customer around me were eating the same thing but they crank out the volume pretty well. 

The staff is very friendly and they were on top of our drinks making sure the ice tea's, coffees and waters were all filled. They brought out a big basket of rolls and there is plenty of butter on the table. 

We got our plates fairly quickly. I will say that I have seen some pictures of steaks on this Yelp post but my steak could fit in the shadow of those steaks. I will post a picture and you be the judge. Actually worst than the size was the fact that my was pretty dry; however, when I looked at my Father-in-laws steak it was perfectly pink in the middle.and he had asked for his well done. I think they switched our plates. Too bad I ate my steak first then went after the lobster while he did the opposite. By the time he saw the inside of his steak, my was in my belly. Damn it.

Even with our little snafu, this is still a great deal and we all left very happy. There are much better steak and lobster plates in Las Vegas  but I appreciate not spending $100 on a plate. For a good deal, you cant go wrong with this special.

Its so nice having so many offerings in 200 yards or less. These are not the fancy upscale restaurants on the strip, these are the common  guy/gals place. It allows you to have a nice meal, see some great entertainment and still go play a little.",5lhisOo609Mymwf9-4MOlA,2,0,4,PRhk_8cyZpCM4digKjKHaw

We were attracted by the $11.99 steak and lobster offer so we walked in. Offer was only served for two hours between hours of 9:00p to 11:00p. This location was inside the Fremont Hotel in Fremont Street Experience so the restaurant was always crowded. We had a 20-min wait. Restaurant is not open in the mornings or lunch. They are open daily and begin serving at 4:30p.

Well, what did you expect for $11.99 right... small portions of everything. 8-oz steak was small and rubbery but the 5-oz lobster tail was delicious with lots of butter. Two bites for me. I didn't eat the house veggies as it didn't look fresh and appealing. The meal also came with baked or mashed potatoes. I think bread was served also before the meal, I can't remember.

When I was young, I remember coming to Florida to visit my father... I would look forward to a few things. My summer friends, Disney and Tony Roma's ""a place for ribs"".
We would always get ribs, some great appetizers and the onion loaf... a couple of years ago, I was in Orlando and on International drive I ate at a Tony Roma's, fantastic! 
Well, this visit to Tony Roma's in the strip was anything but... When I saw the sign, immediately I said, Tony Roma's ""a place for ribs"", I LOVE THAT PKACE!!! Man what a disappointment! 
When we arrived, there were cheap dollar store wicker baskets in the table with little individual promise margarines. YUK! Not to mention, no bread was even brought to the table, so what was the promise even for? We were starving, so we ordered apps and the onion loaf. GROSS! The apps were cold, lifeless and clearly crappy frozen product that I could have e gotten in Publix. The onion loaf, crispy outside but a mushy and pasty inside... dinner, good ribs, but the sides, cold and terrible! Garlic mashed potatoes had no taste! The consistency was terrible... well, I know one thing. Next time I'm in Vegas. No Tony Roma's for me!

It was about a 20 minute wait time for the regular crowd. Dunno about the special crowd for the steak/lobster, as we came about an hour before they did. And they don't give out numbers for that special until around 15-20 minutes before they open for such.

Lobster tails were strong and overcooked, in spite of having to wait for them ""they weren't ready"", I suspect the waitress just forgot. We ordered mahi mahi and got chicken, when the replacement fish finally arrived it was watery and not real warm. We received dinner rolls when we were almost finished eating, they were warm but nothing to write home about. Baked potato and baked beans were good, fries were standard. Coleslaw was good.

       Ambiance was no big shakes, all in all about the class of Applebees but more expensive, if not for winning some money at the 4 Queens down the street we may have been more upset, fortunately we didn't wait in line like many people had to.

4167521,2018-02-22,0,CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,"So I have never been to a Tony Roma's before, I thought they were a decent chain steakhouse.  Boy was I wrong.

I was with my wife on Valentines day and went towards the end of the night.  The wait was reasonable given the day. We were sat in the back by the host who sat 2 tables at a time, efficient, I liked that.

So our server (Mariella) took a bit to come over and when she did she was very short, not friendly, and just wanted to get our drink order.  We were trying to ask her simple questions about the special, which she didn't seem to happy to be answering (I suppose she assumed we were cheap, which is fair, but not true by any means).  You could tell she was in a hurry and wanted to get this over with.  We ordered drinks, but if she would have given us 30 seconds we could have ordered our whole meal, saving her another 5 minutes.

She brings the drinks (wine) and takes the order, 2 regular priced steaks ordered medium rare. Well this was about the last time we saw our server.  The steaks came out in a reasonable amount of time, but were over cooked.  All the sides were cold.  We weren't going to have them recooked (as I normally would an over cooked steak) but the side could have been addressed.  Well she never came back.  I had to stop a male server to ask for the sauce that was on the menu which she did drop off, but did so in a sprint and did not ask us anything about our food or if we wanted more drinks (which we did). So we choked down 2 horrible steaks.  

The whole time I could see my server doing side work 4 tables away.  This is unprofessional in several ways, reflects poorly on the server but also that the company is having them do so much side work rather than have other hour employees roll silverware.   I heard her trying to give away tables because she was trying to get out of there, which sucks that she would give such bad service then dump them on another employee to take sales and tip outs on horrible service.  Mean while, we were pretty much done at this point and had already had our card on the table for 10 minutes, which she would have known, if she EVER stopped by.  

When she was finally done rolling her silverware she came by and asked if we wanted more wine (we did 20+ minutes ago) and still didn't notice a credit card at the edge of the table.  I had to hand it to her and tell her to close us out.  We almost just left without paying seeing as no one knew that we were there.  

Needless to say, this is the only time I have never tipped, even bad service and rude people still get 5-10% out of me seeing as I worked in the industry for 15 years.  I will make sure all my friends and family that visit me never go to this restaurant when they are in town.

Ended up going to this Tony Roma's which is inside the Fremont Casino with a large group (my family primarily). As stated at the beginning of the review, glad I wasn't paying for my meal because it was not good.

I ordered the ""recommended"" Tony Roma's Steakhouse Burger and asked for it medium well. It came out medium for sure. Very pink in the middle, definitely not cooked enough to my liking. However, I was so hungry I did not bother to return it to the waitress. I also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack. She seriously was running around like a chicken with her head cut off. I think she had too many tables.

My brother also had the Steakhouse burger. We both agreed it wasn't anything spectacular. It came with two big slices of bacon on it and it was a pretty good size. The fries were not hot, and neither was my burger. It seemed like they'd been sitting around before being brought out. My aunt got the spinach dip appetizer. I had a taste, it tasted like spinach dip... and it too was lukewarm. My uncle got the shrimp cocktail. The shrimps looked decent sized, but the presentation was a little weird in my opinion. 

This place is seriously a tourist trap for sure. The dining room is also dark and off-putting. They have really, really cheap specials which i did not partake of, but I don't know, maybe they're worth it?

On food alone, it would be a 2-star, ""Meh. I've experience better."", but factor in the price and service and it really was A-OK (at least for us). Three of us went for the special, mom went for the ribs. The ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender. Our tails, though small, were tasty. The steaks, well things break down here a bit. They were very thin, and a bit on the tough side, but not so bad that we did not finish them. Veggies were no big deal but the potato was OK. 

If I had more time, I probably would have come back to try the $8.99 prime rib.

One thing to note, when it says 9PM, it means 9PM. The computerized ordering system won't give you the special price until 9, and the hostess won't seat you until you are ready to order. Couple that with people are going to queue for the special(s), and you may want to get there a little early.

Bottom line: I'm glad we had this ""special"" experience. 

PS. If you are a bit early, you can order drinks and appetizers and then place your special entrees order after 9.",I4eTqRHq93iElqq4f5istw,0,0,3,vjORTJ8wNVTvuMlYM3ykyQ

This restaurant has so much wrong with it, I'm utterly surprised it was as crowded as it was. The atmosphere, decorations and furniture are extremely outdated, it feels more like a cafeteria, rather than a four star restaurant. The food was no better, portion sizes are small, to feeling nonexistent. I know the rule; quality over size but quality fell in the nonexistent category as well. From the 14oz ribeye with coleslaw and baked potato, to the bacon cheeseburger an American classic that they couldn't even prepare right. The steak was a more done then what was ordered. It's a big difference when you order medium rare but receive well done. From bacon not being fully cooked to fries completely overshadowing the plate. Presentation was horrific, quality was horrific, as well as serving size. You pay for four star quality at this restaurant but receive one star in return.

I've only been to Tony Romas once before, years ago and this is one was alot different to the one I remember. We were seated right away which was nice, the place was filled with big groups (more families, etc).

I got their 'famous' Baby Back Ribs with a Baked Potato on the side. Yes, I might be tiny but I can eat A-lot:) They were good but nothing extraordinary and the potato was kind of cold.

A little dissapointed, but I guess thats what you get at a steak house in a beat up hotel on Fremont Street!

We ordered steak, pork ribs, and chicken. My plate came out and I specifically asked for dark meat chicken. The server was so nice that she went out of her way to get the dark meat after claiming it was Chefs choice for the chicken type. Ive been here too many times to know that she was incorrect. Nonetheless, it was rectified.

Our server was very polite, friendly and quick to attend to our needs. I like how she checked up on us and asked if we needed her service. The food came out fresh and tasty, at least mine did.

Butter should be on the plate in a container with the sour cream(got this).  Margarine should be an option for those that don't use butter.

All of the other Tony Roma's exude a certain level of classiness and have a few regular items on the menu that I always look forward to ordering.

I feel that all Tony Roma's chains should live up to their usual standards, but this one falls far below. Where do I start?

Firstly, the reason I decided to eat here in the first place was because of all the signs outside luring you in with a picture of juicy prime rib, accompanied by a big baked potato and veggies that says ""Only $8.99!""

After you walk through the rowdy smoke-filled casino to get to the restaurant, you are greeted by nobody. Rather, you have to walk up to an angry lady standing at a podium and let her know that you would like to be seated. 

She asks your name without looking at you, and writes it down as she rudely says ""30 to 40 minute wait. No prime rib tonight.""

Are they kidding me? How is a place like this so packed? They don't offer the meal they so widely advertise and the service is already this crappy before even getting seated!

I was very tempted to leave and eat elsewhere, but me and bae were hungry and didn't feel like going on the hunt for another restaurant.   

We stood up until a seat cleared so we could sit down and wait. As we waited, we had to hear the lady at the podium scream names out as tables opened up. Why can't they invest in a microphone and speaker?

Once we were seated, I decided to put the experience thus far behind me and order some of that yummy Tony Roma's food.

I really look forward to the warm bread and savory garlic butter served at every Tony Roma's before your food comes. 

What a surprise, they do not carry the garlic butter. They don't even serve bread unless you request it. I did, but it never came.

At least the entrée was good. We shared the Roma Rack of ribs, baked potato soup, and a fudge cookie ice cream dessert. 

During dinner, we had the privilege of witnessing a woman choke on her meat and a man perform the Heimlich Maneuver on her about 10 feet from our table. Thank God it worked and she was okay.

My boyfriend drank a soda with his meal and I had a glass of water with lemon. It tasted like the most disgusting grade of tap water I ever drank. I hope they also invest in a Britta filter or something.

Very classy joint, huh? This place almost has no right going under the name Tony Roma's unless they adjust their standards accordingly.

-cheap cut of tough steaks.  Buy better grade steaks!
-rude wait staff.  Train them or get new ones.
-cooks over cooking steaks, wasteful when they're sent back.  Train the cooks or hire new ones.  And buy better beef.  Can't work miracles with a cheap product.

I reaaalllly wish I had looked up the Yelp rating before we ended up here, but we were hungry and my phone wasn't working, and it is a chain, so I thought, how bad can it be? Mistake #1

Mistake #2? Ordering the lobster...I know, I know, ridiculous to think I would get decent lobster here, but my husband knows I love it and again, I thought, how bad can it be? BAD BAD BAD BAD BAD First of all it was 22.99 and I swear the two lobster tails were each the size of my husbands finger. If they hadn't come attached to shells, I would have thought they were large shrimp. They looked terrible, but I was so hungry, so I gave it a shot. First one, WAY WAY overcooked, took two bites to finish the whole tail. Second one? Took one bite and thought ""I am going to be throwing up tonight"" It was horrific, and made my stomach lurch immediately, so no finishing that one. 

While the lobster was definitely the defining bad moment of dinner, I will also add that I asked for garlic mashed potatoes instead of baked potato, got baked potato, had to ask for the mashed and once they came my stomach was so rocky from the lobster, I couldn't eat much, but they were pretty salty and not that great. Also asked for rolls, three times, finally got them and frankly that was about all I ate just to have something on my stomach. 

Sooo, the best thing I can say is, I did not end up sick that night, which I feel is some kind of a miracle given what that lobster tasted like. I guess I will add that my husband's burger was fine, so there is that I suppose, but I refuse to give more than one star to this place. The staff was nice, but incredibly slow and like I mentioned above, screwed up my order and really didn't want to bring those rolls. Dinner was $50 and I am still insanely irritated that we even paid it. I should have talked to a manager, but we just wanted to get the heck out of there and try to salvage the rest of our night.

It was sad and not worth the $280 we had to pay.",VtyVCYRChhdyzYOxomevAg,0,0,1,SP6Qlnxzx1wWoUMbjJgeZg

I don't know if it is the ecomony or the food, but it was unusual.  It's Tony Romas, so what can we say.  It is a restaurant chain located inside a casino in Downtown Las Vegas.  The food tastes pretty much the same as any other Tony Romas.  The wait staff was attentive and accommodating.  The ribs were great (4 of us had ribs), and we added their red hot BBQ sauce, which made it yummy.  My mom had the prime rib special and she was happy.  We started with the onion loaf, which is a treat for onion lovers.",j7yDFhbyYf9JDJRdbCTHZg,0,0,2,61tyw3zE1PrS067UEYfC1g

the food was ok.
the drinks were pretty terrible. 

I drank my water and ate the food. evidently we weren't the first to say anything because at the first mention of the bad drink the waitress apologized and took it off the bill. 
we went there because we knew the name and wanted good food. Next time, ill go someplace I don't know the name I guess.",2Ppy64oCGu3UcXHKNJDJzA,0,0,3,5PFfgOLVkf9eVE2s9HbOCQ
5906193,2018-03-04,0,CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,"Came here for their prime rib special for $9.99. I have to say for $10, it was not that bad. It was well made, and what you could expect for $10. The prime rib we ordered was medium rare and it came out just like we asked. 
If you looking for a basic meal, this is definitely what you will get, that's why I'm giving it a 4 star review. Don't expect anything fancy, basically a simple dinner. 

Service was good, it was super busy due to the prime rib deal. But we got our drinks and food in a timely manner. They messed up our one drink order but it was fixed really quickly. 

Would come back here for their specials if I am ever back in Vegas.",33d2OBr5yMWMMW_ibYbqIA,0,0,4,xzOT2PcaBbcGI0BY1JOqsw

5916179,2018-03-12,0,CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,Great steak for the price. We were down at Fremont and Tony Roma's had a special on steak. It was like $9 and was great for the price.,Y_-7ho0SVSIo7GDWniVZxQ,0,0,4,q_R5oEnFmRjXzZwGy65Kmg
5941805,2011-06-06,1,CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,I've been here several times and have been happy every time. For those who think you are going to get a five star quality steak and lobster dinner for 17 dollars you are foolish. For what you pay here it is a great dinner. The servers are hard working people who have a tough job because they have many tables. If you don't like your 12 dollar steak go across the street to Vic and snthonys  and pay 50 just for the meat it is excellent but remember you wanted a 12 dollar steak dinner,lsnpyUloDc3upsQ00YOs-g,0,0,4,yDY1L4HWfgleI4-fVDxtRQ
5985906,2018-06-11,0,CBb7z-MTbkzBvsUHBDqxEg,Save your money. We took my father in law here for a birthday dinner while on vacation. The service was mediocre and the food was overpriced. My ribs were fine but the steaks were soggy. Pretty sure the only way that can happen is if you're eating frozen beef. There are so many other restaurants in Vegas. Next time we will be trying someplace else.,FEiGViDkyGPM5jp6cy-F4g,1,0,2,gnCI_2nInY4Ki9ojVQZxhQ
