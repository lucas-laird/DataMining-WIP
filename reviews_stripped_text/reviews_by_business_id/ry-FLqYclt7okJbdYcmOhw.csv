26450,2009-12-13,0,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"Of the Vegas hotels I've stayed at, this place ranks above only the airport Travelodge and the only reason I stayed at the TL was someone stupidly scheduled our meeting during CES. Think 1970's motel, including the pizza delivery flyers strewn about the hallway and under your door. My room was clean and decently large and that's all the positives I can think of. Did I mention the tattoo parlor opposite the front desk? A discount is included in your fun pack when you check in.

It's clear there have been improvements in recent years but in a rather haphazard fashion, so the Nascar theme area is new (and sparsely attended) but the rooms, hotel area, and casino look like they haven't been renovated in about 25 years. There were none of the typical amenities in a newer hotel/motel like flat screen TV, coffee maker, or room safe.

Beware of the annoying mandatory ""resort"" fee of $6/day. I object to this practice as it's a hidden surcharge you discover either when you've booked or started checking in and should be included in the room rate if it's mandatory. In any event, I didn't see any resort and I certainly wouldn't have paid a cent to use it. Maybe they'll start charging us a flushing fee next?

The location is at the extreme north end of the strip and none of the Vegas sights are nearby. However, the monorail and ""deuce"" doubledecker bus are conveniently close. I didn't ride the monorail but it appears to get you to their limited stops a lot faster but at a higher price. The deuce is a modern doubledecker bus which runs between Downtown and the south end of the strip. A 24 hour ticket is also good for other bus lines if you wanted to go away from the strip. Some major places like LV Hilton, the convention center, and Hard Rock hotel are off the strip. Patience will be needed at busy times, however, as traffic and hicks who've never ridden a bus will slow progress to a fast walk.

In conclusion, if you're looking for a cheap place to stow your stuff, take a nap, and attend to your hygiene while in Vegas, you might give it a try but it ain't the Venetian.",UeAdOA6o8tXKOQQK4sE_iw,2,0,2,yX8iUyQYCyfpGyLBG5qgag

It wasn't entirely disgusting like some of the small seedy motels you'll find just north of here, but it's just not a place that screams relaxation. Especially when a water main broke, causing our room's bathroom ceiling to spill what we hope was potable water all over our toiletries. 

Not much was offered in terms of compensation (i.e. free buffet--we're starving college kids, damnit!), just a few beer tickets. Then one of the two elevators allowing access to our ancient tower broke down right as everyone and their mother arrived to check in.

This building isn't looking too good on the inside. A major structural overhaul is likely out of financial reach, but funds to at least freshen up the decor would go a long way toward higher guest morale. I'm sure this place was pure swank when it opened over half a century ago, but too many things were uncomfortably off or have been left in disrepair for too long.

To be fair, the pool area is nice, wind-free and clean enough. We didn't give the food offerings a try, but the drinks here are plain gross.

I know that the Sahara was built circa 1952 so I wasn't expecting something that was completely trendy and flashy so to some degree it did live up to my expectations. 
I have stayed in a Resident's Inn by Marriot that was alot better in nearly everyway than the Sahara but with one exception. The experience and history that the Sahara has packed into it.

298706,2010-03-22,2,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"Wow, where do I begin..?

My boyfriend and I went to this hotel because we wanted to try something different besides the Stratosphere, which is the cheapest hotel ""on the strip"". So we went on Expedia and got a ""Premier Suite,"" which we paid extra money per night, picked the option for a king sized bed, view of the city and smoking.
When we get there the check-in line is enormous and there are only two tellers there working as slow as they can, but we brush it off with the fact that it was before 3p, which is check-in time; understandable. So we decide to go get our players club cards and right away the tellers behind the desk are mega-b!tch*s. But we went on our merry way to go waste some money in the machines while we waited for 3p.
Once we got up to the check-in desk, the guy behind it was a jerk too, no smiles, everyone there looked like they were on the verge of killing someone. We get our key-cards and find out we are on floor #3, which was a major disappointment, but, again, we brushed it off. As soon as the doors open we get hit with a pungent smell of ass and weed, the ass being more dominant. 
Once we get into our room, we notice that #1 There are two full sized beds and not a king. #2 The room seems like a normal sized room and calling it a premier is just misleading. #3 Our window looks out into the middle of the hotel's walls, where we can see a rooftop with a lovely chair, a pillow and somebody's leftover Chinese. 
So my boyfriend called the front desk and said, ""Hi, I think we got the wrong room. We got reservations for a king bed and a view of the city."" I could hear her over the phone in a really rude tone saying that those options weren't guaranteed and there's nothing they could do.
So, after that disappointment I went to go to the bathroom and as I'm sitting there I hear a rumbling in the towelette and then a burst of sh*t water sprays up all over and then the towelette gets backed up!! The only person who was nice to us was the maintenance guy who came and plunged our towelette.
THEN in the morning we're woken up by this ""eeheeheehhhhhhh!"" from other people taking showers and when we take a shower, the only way to get a decent warm/hot shower is to have that nose real close to your ear. AND the tub backed up, I'm sorry, but when I go on vacation one of the things that I'm trying to get away from is my crappy plumbing.
Seriously, I would have not minded staying at the Motel 6 down the way! The Stratosphere would have been cheaper, cleaner, less noisy and better customer service. This experience was the worst I have ever had at any hotel or motel, the pay-by-the-hour motels in Los Angeles are better than the Sahara.",V8B5lhqGlAuLEr9cCs7HWw,2,0,1,vbuWpWY_4hPp-hEgZ2WN2Q

427412,2007-12-11,0,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"The Sahara Hotel and Casino is an older property that is located at the heart of the Las Vegas strip. Its room prices are at the lower end of the price range for Las Vegas Strip locations and only slightly above the price of the MGM properties Excalibur and Circus Circus. 

For the slightly higher price are you getting a nicer room, elevators that come within fractions of a minute rather than minutes and LAN and Wireless high speed Internet access rather than just Wireless. The Buffet is also excellent in quality and price and the Room service is cheaper than you might think. I used it several times and it was fast, not much more expensive than paying at the restaurant and good quality. 

The Monorail station is right next to the hotel, which provides a great alternative to using a cab without the need to walk a long distance to the station itself, like it is the case for several other Las Vegas Strip properties. 

Overall are you getting a very good deal. I stayed at the Sahara already three times and prefer it over the Excalibur, Luxor, Flamingo and Circus Circus. 

The Wynn is much nicer, true, but you also have to pay for a single night almost the same what you have to pay for a whole week stay at the Sahara.

The rooms are spacious, but not fancy and only equipped with the essential stuff. The A/C control lags some precision and a bit more lights would also not hurt. I was only staying in the room to sleep and to work a bit on my computer on the Internet, so that those short-comings did not bother me too much.

I also do not gamble and can't say anything about the quality of the Casino itself. I always ask for a room in the tower that is close to the Lobby entrance, so I do not even have to see anything of the Casino at all.",florjI7k-ow-Eq60uq8YIA,0,0,5,neC8hOFy1ZAunYHCCuAqHQ

As far as the rooms go, we got a smoking room which apparently is in the oldest part of the hotel, and has not had any recent renovations. The furniture was all chipped, but the beds were pretty comfortable. The AC worked great, shower and hair dryer all worked. The only real bad thing about the room was the light by the bed didnt work, but that didnt really bother us, there were plenty of other lights.
FOOD:
I don't like that nothing is open 24 hours food wise. well thats not entirely true, theres a cafe that serves seattles best coffee and crispy cream donuts and a few other things but thats about it. The nascar cafe was actually very good. The waitresses were kind of rude and frumpy, but the food and margaritas were good. Everytime we were there someone was trying to do the B3 challenge (they have to eat a giant burrito in so much time), so that was pretty entertaining.

overall the place was cheap, the people were rude, the machines dont pay crap, and I wouldnt recomend it to someone that wants a luxurious vegas getaway.

If however you want a place where you can lay low and crash for a decent rate this is the place for you. If you want to stay on the strip for cheap,  and have easy access to a monorail, and the duece stop going downtown, this place is for you. If your a pothead and you want to be able to smoke in your room but dont want the maids to rat you out this place is for you! (just bring extra towels and dont get housecleaninggg!)

ok overview

good: cheap, nascar cafe burgers,curly fries, and margaritas, monorail access, privacy  ;)

BAD: outdated, rude, old waitresses/ other employees,crappy 4ft deep pool, not good for late night munchies, slots dont pay out,",E-S9bfDe_dtdAcmub9vJFQ,0,0,2,XuxnBwSdezrcGgQrlvB2MA

2. they actually have the table game ........WAR!! Can you believe it. I think I almost Sh$t myself when I saw this. I'm not a gambler so seeing this table game was like an oasis in the desert. I swear it was the most fun I ever had loosing $40 bucks!  It reminded me of the casino that Clark Griswald went to in National Lampon's Vegas Vacation.  I am still waiting for the rock, paper, scissors table. 

3. The Beatles stayed there in the early 60's. You see plaques commemorating this throughout the hotel.

4. Close to the monorail. After a night of partying we went from one end of the strip to the Sahara in like 5min. It was super unreal how fast it was. 

The worst parts:
1. It was far from the other hotels. We had to cab it or take the bus.

2. The restaurants sucked. Don't bother eating here if you can help it

It's a weird, faded, not-at-all classy place where it takes a long time to check in and the dealers aren't hotties and you can walk around the lobby with a tallboy in your hand and nobody cares. The pool is full of friendly rednecks and colorful weirdos, and the outdoor bar has Miller High Life on draft. It's dirt cheap and attracts what my mother would call a ""certain element."" The lifeguards look like 19-year-old emo punk-rockers decked out in crazy tattoos and piercings. The casino is cheeseball central with Moroccan-themed carpeting and gaudy chandeliers. There's a crazy little club called the Casbah where a live band plays standards, and a NASCAR section that I never even found. The rooms are fine: Mine was clean, cold, and boring. I spent about four waking minutes in there, total.

Point being, the Sahara is what it is. It's cheaper than the other places because it's lower wattage and lower grade. It's not for everyone, but if you find charm in chintzy, slightly down-and-out old hotels, it might be the place for you. Years from now, when it's been torn down and replaced by the Miragio MGM Wynndalay Bay, we'll reminisce fondly about back in the day when you could get a room on the Strip for 25 bones a night, in a hotel that had $1 blackjack and $3 craps.

It really is sad how the place fell into such a depressing funk and the multiple owners it's had over the past 10 years who owned it without caring. At the same time though, the place wasn't utterly terrible. Old and in some serious need of work? Definitely. Rundown and disgusting? Well, in Las Vegas it seems like anything built before 1990 is rundown by default anyway. The local bias against buildings from the 60's and 70's which just need a little work or may be totally fine even really amazes me, especially seeing how many other cities in America have buildings from the early 1900's or even the 1800s which look like they could totally collapse at any moment. Kind of beating a dead horse there, I know, I'm just dying to see how most of the people with these kinds of biases will react in 30 years or so if places like The Bellagio or The Venetain are considered ""TOO OLD AND NOT HIP ENOUGH"" by the next generation and put up for implosion. 

I took one final look around the place a few weeks ago. It appeared that the arcade, the Cyber Speedway, the rollercoaster and most of the Nascar Cafe were already closed up. It was a rather dark, somber atmosphere. Everyone in there (workers and clientele) did not seem to care, all except for the enthusiastic gift store clerk I talked to. Well, I wish them all the best of luck anyway. 

On a positive note, the building won't be blown up, but in a few years it's name will be changed and it will be modeled after all the other hip and trendy places in Las Vegas. Well, I'm happy that at least technically the ""Sahara"" will still be around, I just wish the owner would execute these plans without sucking out it's character and making out like what it was never happened.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,8,4,5,OwByZ3x9oWGuNn-lkz38kQ

In the 21st century, The Sahara is starting to show its age compared to other newly constructed luxury hotels in Las Vegas, but considering the price differences The Sahara should not be overlooked by the budget conscious.

The Monorail stops right across from the Sahara's Paradise road entrance and can take you to the heart of the strip (and beyond) economically and fast. Airport shuttles serve the Sahara at reasonable rates.

The Sahara has a very nice outdoor pool and other amenities such as the NASCAR Cafe and Sports bar as well as a cozy comedy club and night club.

There are inexpensive dining options nearby as well as fast food if you prefer or are on a budget.

The Sahara casino offers the normal slots, video poker and table games and also has a great players club program that can be used for discounts in most of the shops and restaurants in the Sahara.

The in-room internet service is provided by Cox Communications and is available for the princely sum of $12.99 per 24 hour usage. Please note that there are other less expensive wireless internet providers such as Boingo that can provide internet service for as low as $7.99 per 24 hour usage. Check the signal strength of the other providers from your room before using the ""house"" service. 

If you are looking for a basic, clean and comfortable room in Las Vegas at an affordable price, give The Sahara a close look. If you prefer something newer and shinier, other hotels on Las Vegas Boulevard are more than eager to take your money.",kk-bXv0GI7bDg1RIRJNCIw,2,0,3,ymq9LR2UGPJwAi36V_lkSA

My gf and I stayed again for three nights this past weekend, and WHOA has the place gone downhill. The service has just gotten horrible, they've just thrown in the towel. 

On Sunday morning the power in our room went out (mind you it's close to 100 degrees outside, and no AC in the room). I called downstairs and they blamed it on Nevada power, and said it would be fixed within the hour. An hour and a half later, I call back, and they say it'll be yet another hour. I asked for some kind of reimbursement or comp, before the words were done coming out of my mouth, they replied with ""Oh I'm so sorry, we won't be doing any of that today"".

So we're trapped in our rooms, we haven't left cause we need to shower at least, especially with no AC, we were sweating more than a priest at a preschool. So another hour rolls by, and FINALLY the lights come back on. I jump in the shower, and I kid you not, the lights go off again. IT'S PITCH BLACK in the shower, greeeeeat! As I finish my shower and plan and exit strategy without slipping and breaking all bones, the lights come back on, but won't stop flickering.

Plus:
-Super cheap!  I think we paid $20/night.  
- Just clean enough for you to feel comfortable enough to rest your head on the bed.  
-Vegas monorail stop at the hotel.  Super convenient.  Also, it's the last stop, so there's really no way you can mess  up and end up going in the wrong direction (I can't tell you how many other passengers we'd end up riding with who all realized after the first stop that they were going the wrong way).  
-Super cheap gambling.  $0.25 roulette machines.  $1 blackjack.  
-daily slot machine tournament.  hilariously fun.  free to enter if you join their players' club (which is also free to enter) 
-daily $1 specials:  $1 shots, $1 hot dogs, and $1 beer

Minuses:
-Definitely more run down than the other casinos.  You notice it the moment you step inside--the air in the Sahara isn't as circulated as well, so you are instantly VERY AWARE that smoking is allowed indoors.  Versus, say, only moderately aware. 
-The crowd isn't great eye-candy.  When you're at, say, the MGM or what have you, you can take a look around and see how glammed up people are.  Here, at the Sahara, they're more low-key.  It's not unusual to see people walking around in unflattering sweatsuits. 
-The food.  Not fantastic at all. 
-The last stop on the monorail.  One of the farthest from the strip, yet somehow still considered to be on The Strip casinos.  

Anyways, would I stay here again?  Probably not.  I'd definitely want to stay someplace a little closer to the other casinos.  Would I come back here to gamble?  Heck yes.  Despite all its flaws, the Sahara is still a fun little casino to spend time at.

The check-in lines I noticed were extremely long. I requested a non-smoking room but clearly the room they gave us smelled like cigarettes (especially the bed). Perhaps they were giving us the shaft because it was a ""free"" room, but I really didn't like that.

On the second day while I was in the shower, the water suddenly turned off. My friend called the front desk while I stormed to the lobby to find out what the hell was going on. Apparently, there was a leak on our side of the hotel and all of the water was shut off. Okay, thanks for the heads up guys! The only highlight of that was we got moved to a much nicer room.

I enjoy coming to Sahara for the gambling, it's one of the cheapest on the strip but the place is a bit far from the mega casinos so I'd probably stay somewhere else next time I'm in Vegas. Last time I was in Vegas, I got a really good rate at Tropicana which I would take again if I was on a budget simply because it's closer to all the action. I had a rental car anyway because I drove to Vegas, so the distance wasn't a big deal but if I didn't have a car it would have definitely been a pain. I'd probably pick Hooters or Tropicana if I wanted to go hotel cheap next time.

I have to agree with other yelpers there is a total lack of $1 tables. I'd definitely would have played more at Sahara, but I didn't see any of these supposed $1 tables my entire weekend! Perhaps it is more of a weekday thing?

The dealers there are very friendly and the cocktail waitresses are very fast in bringing you drinks. If you leave your table for a minute, they leave the drinks for you which is very nice of them.

the good  =)
*price...it's cheap.  there's a reason why.
*buffet - ok, so it's not the best quality food BUT it's cheap and the food here is decent.  i don't enjoy paying $30 for a buffet all the time...for $12.99 or $6.99 for card members, it's good enough.
*gambling here is decent - my friends come here because the tables are cheap...so i guess if you like blackjack or poker, it's worth it

the bad  =(
*rooms are not clean!  carpet is terrible...linens/comforters are a joke...bathroom makes me groan when i think about it
*it's so far from everything!!  so technically it's on the strip, but the closest hotels are not that great...and it's a walk.  you seriously need to  take a taxi to get anywhere
*the parking structure is scary...the elevators seem unstable and why does it always feel like i'm going to get mugged here?
*very smoky - my eyes can't take a lot of cigarette smoke...if we stay here too long, my eyes water


it's really not worth it to stay here...there are other places with comparable prices that are much, much better.",GVYg18F-Rkuk63hvtHoG5Q,3,0,1,NJn-c-H5oNZb3B92LAbLFg

What can I say? Hubs and I stayed here while we were in Vegas from Feb 2nd-5th, 2011. We stayed on the 10th floor. For Wed and Thurs night, it cost us $22/nite, for Friday nite, it cost us $55/nite. With tax and everything, the total for the hotel bill was $124 (they charged us for a $8/nite ""resort"" fee, which I'm assuming was for the gym, pool and phone?) 

The parking structure is kind of tricky to get to for the hotel if you don't know where you are going. The parking lot was kind of sketchy, so hubs parked by other cars close the the elevator, and made sure NOTHING was visible to the curious eye. One of the two elevators from the parking structure to the ground floor to the hotel was broken the whole time while we were there. The elevator was sketchy as well... looked like it was going to break down on us most of the time. 

When you walk into the lobby, it immediately smells like greasy food. Not pleasant. But whatever... We checked in fine, no wait at 5:00p on a Wednesday night. The room we had was on the 10th floor, the view was really nice :) The floor we were on was really quiet, and I don't think we saw a single person in the hall way the whole entire time we were there. The room didn't smell, which was a total plus for us :) We had a king sized bed, and the sheets were clean so that's all that mattered. The bed wasn't the comfiest, but we still got a good night's sleep on it. The bathroom wasn't very well ventilated, so it kinda sucked when we showered. All in all, the room was really fine for what we were hoping for. We could tell that they didn't really care about the appearance anymore... and I just found out that they were closing in May of 2011, so now I understand why. 

We also mosied our way to the place with the $1 hot dogs and $1 beers. The hot dogs were tiny and dry, and the beers were Miller High Life beers... it didn't look like a full sized bottle. So, unless you are already drunk, I would recommend you stay away from this place, or you will be disappointed.

2258356,2010-11-12,0,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"This review is a little late I stayed the last weekend in September...

So I actually booked a room through their facebook promotion, $1= 1 night and literally only paid like $1.22 or something for a Saturday night. I had made reservations at a fancier place for Sunday and Monday nights. 

First of all let me say this the 3 stars is mostly for the parking. I know Sin City like the back of my hand and NEED a car to get around. That being said the parking for the guests of the Sahara is far and pretty shady looking. I expected to be encountered by a Gotham City villain any minute...

Check-in was a breeze I waited like 2 minutes at 10pm to be helped by a super perky male wearing some lovely smelling lotion. Mr. Smelly lotion wearer was very very friendly, however when we went up to our room in the Tunis tower it was obvious he had given us someone else's room (luggage, clothes, makeup etc). Now at this point some of you may have behaved differently but I was all smiles when I went down, had my hubby stand by our luggage, (somewhat awkwardly since mine is bright pink). So I go to inform my buddy that I believe he may have given us another guest's room but not to worry I wasn't going to make a big stink we just wanted any room that was unoccupied (I said this quite seriously not sarcastically). He apologized profusely and gave us a new room in another Tower (Alexandria) and sent us away. 

First of all let me say the ride up to the room was much different than the ride up in the Tunis elevator (the first notable difference was the elevator, not shabby or empty and semi-dark , filled with decent looking folks and well-lighted). I thought it was funny that groups of these semi-young club goers were going into the rooms next to us (like really 4 girls to 1 small bedroom hmmm a little suspicious?) But alas we get to the corner room and it is a 3 room suite with a living room/ bar/dining area, (balcony- view was awesome), powder room, bathroom, and bedroom.Very very cool....

So the hubby and I get freshened up and head downstairs. The karaoke taking place was pretty entertaining and we drank to our heart's content while gambling very little on the penny machines. The whole vibe of the place was pretty chill. I would go again but not to stay in The Tunis Tower.",ACbVjWSB0ryr5mdALm30Ww,0,0,3,4hPdy3KDYSMpRyUrYaH6KQ

Some cars/trucks will block a lane and one car can go through, while the other waits. Depending where you park, BE WARNED. the north side parking garage elevators are broken.

2597868,2011-05-17,0,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"When I realized that I would be in town for the Sahara's closing, I decided I wanted to be there, and not only that, I wanted to be the last person to roll the dice on the craps table, and finally I was hoping to bribe the dealers with a generous tip to let me take the last pair of dice rolled.

On Saturday I stopped in to walk around the place and get more info about the closing schedule.  I played some craps and was told that the all the tables would be closing at 10am on Monday.  Late Saturday night I was back with some friends who wanted to get some chips and one last visit and just to be thorough I asked again about the closing and got the same info. Sunday night I decide to turn in early (1am) so that I wouldn't oversleep and could be in Sahara by 9am.  I notice from the parking garage and walking into the casino that things are not very busy so I'm feeling pretty good about my chances of being the last roller as I was a little concerned that it was going to be super crowded and nearly impossible to get on to any table game.  Just as I made my way past the bar I saw the only thing I was not expecting - an empty craps table. No players fine, but no Dealers?!  What happened?!?  I asked one of the suits and was told that they closed at 3am.  I could have easily been there had I not been provided bad info twice.  I'm bummed, sad, mad...

Well, I'm here so I might as well stay around til 10am and see if anything special happens when the table games close.  I jump on the roulette table and play for the final 40 minutes.  About half of that time is spent listening to passer-bys ask if they can buy chips while the dealer explains that they can't.  The cashier wasn't selling chips and the only other tables (BJ) were usually full.

I do appreciate that the pit supervisor let us know when there were 3 spins left so that we wouldn't be blindsided that the game was over.  On the final spin I go all in (you have to right? I was the only one who did though).  The prior spin winning # was 19 so I'm on red, odd and 5 individual #s including the last winning #.  Sure enough 19 hits again and I cash about a $150 profit. That helps ease a bit of the pain of missing the final craps session which was what I had been looking forward to for weeks.

Doors were closing at 2pm but I'm not a slot player and it sure didn't look or feel like anything ceremonial was going to happen so I take a few pics and head back to the Encore to check out.

They really put me in a horrible mood.  Most of the bartenders are rude as well.  Despite this, however, the stay wasn't awful.  The location, while ""on"" the strip is at the very end.

The hotel leaves much to be desired.  The rooms are old, the halls smell like 30-year-old smoke, but for $39 midweek and  $99 on the weekends you can do a lot worse in Vegas.  I mean, I don't care how nice the room is--I don't see it while I'm passed out drunk.

Benefits:

Monorail stop that isn't horribly far from the hotel tower.
$5 blackjack
Poker room is a good size and has daily tourneys.
They have internet--a lot of casinos don't.
You can get toothless hookers and crack just around the corner. :)

Things that pissed me off:

Check-in took forever (and we arrived at 2AM!!!)

True, she was showing her age a bit. Out-shined by many of the younger ladies (some of which are starting to show their own age), but despite a few bumps and blemishes managed to retain enough of her former and once legendary class to remain in business long after most of her contemporaries bit the dust (literally). A notable mouse's former transit system was once thought to be her savior and as was a brief flirtation with stock car circuit but unfortunately all things must pass. Yes, she was one of the casinos Frank, Dino and Sammy hit in the original ""Ocean's Eleven"".

3139393,2010-08-31,2,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"My friend and I checked in on a Thursday.  There was only one person working the front desk.  We get our room keys and proceed to our room.  When we walked inside, one of the beds was unmade with a pair of dirty boxers on top, there was urine in the toilet, and condom wrappers and fresh stains on the floor.  We called down to the front desk to alert them to the situation and, rather than apologize or offer to come to us, we were asked to come back down.

When we got downstairs, there were a few people waiting in line to check in.  We approached the bell desk and told him that we had a problem with our initial room and did not feel like waiting again to have the problem corrected.  He scoffed at us and said ""there's only one person in line!"" as the people ahead of them had already moved up.  Many of the staff members had equally as poor of an attitude: Some of them were nice, but in general they ran hot and cold.  We spoke with a manager who ""upgraded"" our room to the 26th floor.  I had requested a smoking room, but there were no upgrades available in smoking.  Additionally, he waived the $6 facility fee - my bank statement does not yet reflect this credit back to my account.  Looks like I'll have to make a phone call.

Our 2nd room was clean, had a view, and a larger TV.  The rooms were nothing special and the beds were a bit on the hard side, but the hotel did have potential.  The housekeeping service certainly left something to be desired.  We only had our room cleaned once during our 4-night stay - since we had valuables in the room and no safe, we only opted to have the room cleaned when we needed fresh towels.  Unfortunately, wanting fresh towels was asking too much.  Two of the towels delivered to the room were stained with makeup.  One of them was even folded and hanging with the stain facing outwards.  The staff was apparently oblivious to this.  Also, every night we would receive coupons under our door for a local pizza place.  Many of the guests would toss their coupons out into the hallway.  We would leave the hotel at 4 in the afternoon and return as late as 12 hours later.  The coupons would still be in the hallway, which proves to me that no one was so much as doing a sweep of the hotel.

Our neighbors next to us were extremely loud and would come in at 3 am or later - blaring music, talking/singing/laughing loudly, having people in/out, and smoking (cigarettes and marijuana) on a non-smoking floor.  Although I smoke, I am going to respect the rules of the hotel.  When I called down to the front desk to complain, they offered to move us.  Not wanting to move again, they instead sent a security guard to the room.  The message was not well received by our neighbors - every night they stayed there was a repeat of the obnoxious noise.  I mean, it's Vegas, go party on the strip... you can take your drinks with you!!  On the last night they stayed, they received a phone call to their room.  It was their friend, Olivia, who works at the hotel warning them that security was, once again, on their way.  Obviously, Olivia does not value her job very much.

Our last night in the casino, we saw another hotel guest in a screaming match with a member of the staff.  I do not condone this behavior, however found it quite interesting that she mentioned that there was feces in the toiled when she checked in to her room.  Her and her significant other were also moved to the 26th floor.  Apparently, it is not uncommon for these things to happen at the Sahara.

When I initially read the reviews for the Sahara, I did not see anything like what I am writing now.  They did have bad reviews, but I chocked it up to people expecting to pay super low rates for a really fancy hotel.

LasVegas musicians  were told repeatedly that lounge bands were background for the business of gambling. Period. A pit boss once said. ""This is the best band I ever heard. Know why ?

3207932,2009-03-30,0,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"My fiancé and I stayed here over the weekend for a wedding. It seemed cheaper than most anything on the strip, but I guess that alone should have been a red flag.

We reserved a premium, non-smoking room with a king sized bed. It was run down, but I had seen worse elsewhere.
Though, the next day as we got ready for the wedding, we saw a cockroach run across the floor. Not acceptable.

We informed the front-desk of the roach, and while the clerk gave us a bit of attitude, she said they would switch our rooms when we returned from the wedding.
Since we were tired when we got back and didn't want to wait in the long line at the desk, we just figured we would call the front-desk from our room to get the switch done. Should have been simple...

About 10 minutes of either busy signals or endless ringing later, we were getting annoyed. We called the bellhop, which amazingly answered immediately. They were very helpful, and suggested to ignore the line and go straight to the windows for the switch.
After finally getting our new room keys, we called the bellhop back to help us move. They were there in less than 5 minutes. But as we opened the door to our second room, we realized that it was not only non-premium, but that there were two full beds, instead of the single king.
 
We attempted the phones again, but ended up going back to the front desk. We told the clerk about our issues. Her only response was, ""Oh, that wasn't a roach, it was just a water bug, we have those here!"" WHAT? My fiancé finally just said, ""No... we need for you to make this right."" Out came the manager...

The issues were explained again, and the guy at least pretended to look shocked and upset for us. He explained that they had a limited number of premium, king bed rooms, but that he would see what he could do for us, and then vanished behind some doors for about 5 minutes. When he returned, he told us our rates would be reduced by more than half for both nights, and that they were working on getting us a better room. He disappeared again for about 10 more minutes. Then he gave us new room keys, and we were on our way (again...).

Room #3 had the right bed, and did not look as beat up and worn as room #2, but we're pretty sure it was non-premium. But at that point we gave up. We had a decent room and were paying much less than we expected, and we figured there was not anything else that they could (or would) do for us.

Bottom line... avoid. It's cheap, which is nice, but really not worth the hassle. If they had a cleaner, better kept establishment, we would have been fine in the first room. It really seems that they've simply given up on this place. It smells musty, looks incredibly dated, and after staying there for a weekend, it's just gross. I don't like the idea of roaches crawling about my belongings.

Well, at least that's how me and my homies felt.  We're in Sin City to shop and party, not sleep all day!  I guess we spent more time in the hotel room than expected-- so here comes the review.

First off, the front desk lies about early check in!  We drove to Vegas and were pretty dang tired and wanted to check in early.  My homie called in a couple times before realizing that its the same person picking up at front desk, so started to fake his voice, asking what time early check in is.  The guy gave him 3 different answers... well, the guy might have just been messin with him cus he keeps callin, but we were desperate.  So we walked in and discovered the LONG check in line... weird.. I thought check in wasn't for another hour?  Well, people were gettin their rooms... geez, we waited in our car, delirious for two hours, for nothing!

The room was much smaller than I expected.  We had a smoking room with no ash-tray... not a big deal, but geez, were we suppose to tip the guy when he brought one up to us???

One of my homie and I went down to the pool to relax.  Pool is an alright size, lots of chairs, towel service, beer and music blasting.  Once again, though, no ash trays in sight, eh.

Room blankets were very thin, which is cool when it's hot, but once we got the AC blasting throughout the night, it gets pretty chilly... I guess I could've just gotten up to turn off the AC, but it's the principle that counts! .. and yes, I eventually turned off the AC :).

Room service is a big nono.  Food is cheap for roomservice, but you get what you paid for... well, not technically cus I dont think anyone really wants to pay to have diarrhea.... INSTANTEOUSLY... yes, all four of us.  Not to mention, pizza tasted like cardboard, sandwich tasted like cardboard and OJ was warm.

One room was 80bucks, two queen size bed and a tv.... it's cheap, prob stay there again ONLY because it's cheap... I woudn't put too much trust in that place, and definitely would spend a lot less time in the rooms than we did last time.",zpoHCxWETy89E4STauENXg,1,0,3,SSKncJionlrB-vfmW-eG-Q

Well, we searched through kayak for the cheapest rate during labor day weekend and found that Sahara had the cheapest, or at least decent price for that weekend and its location.

Theme: This place is a mesh of Arabian nights, meets Nascar. Yeah, weird huh? Well they have that Nascar cafe randomly in the front along with the random roller coaster. I didn't care so much about the theme.

Room: We were lucky because we ordered a 1bed non smoking and the guy at the counter gave us an extra bed for no additional cost. They played well for my buddy Peter S. because he didn't have to sleep on the floor. But the room is what you call janky. As soon as we walked in, I searched endlessly for the light switch. Lo and behold it was on the polar opposite of the room. We were seriously laughing our asses off when we explored the room. Found our smoke detector broken and on the floor. One of our lights didn't work. Our remote didn't work. Great view of the parking structure. One teeeeeeny tube of shampoo SLASH conditioner. Not both. 

We already expected all of this when we bought the rooms, so it wasn't any surprised.. we were too drunk to care.. and just laughed it away. So I guess it was okay. But had we had planned the trip thoroughly and thoughtfully, we would have never been here in the first place.

As I walked down the hallway to where the elevators are, SERIOUSLY, a tile from the roof fell and left a hole on the ceiling. If that tile came close to hitting me.. i probably wouldn't need to gamble to get some money!! But shows you how unreliable and unsturdy the actual building is.

1)A fun weekend with my girlfriends and I, was what I was expecting. We arrive in what seems like an old and dirty parking structure. There was absolutely no maintenance. Inside the parking structure, the walls where filthy and full of what seemed to be peoples footprints on the wall . I guess it was the thing to do inside the parking structure. No one bothered to clean or paint over the walls.

They had only ONE person working the front desk. As I'm waiting to check us in, my girlfriend goes outside by the pool, in search of a cocktail. The bartender ignores her for about 3-5 minutes. My friend finally asks for his help and a drink.

The Sahara was super inexpensive, great to gamble in (low minimum tables, not super crowded, fun dealers), and just generally low key, like us. Plus it has that super retro feeling, like it is still glamorous to be in Vegas. Great times.

Oh, Sahara. What has happened? Returning to you, after this 4 years absence, is like running into an old friend who used to just like to ""party"" but whose life took a serious dive that now requires some kind of 12 step program.

Where do I begin?

Our ""Premium"" room? I can't decide which was worse - the smells or the stains. I can't even begin to imagine what we would have ended up in had we not spent the extra money for that room. The shower was a weak little trickle and the beds were creepily low to the ground.

Your surly employees (but friendly bartenders) made us feel uncomfortable at every turn. I know we didn't pay a lot to stay here but we did pay enough to not be treated like we were inconveniencing you with our horribly high maintenance requests (can we get a cab? can we have a towel? is there anywhere to get food at 3 in the am?)  I swear the employees know the end is nigh - they just don't give a hoo-ha.

They are trying weird things to save this floundering dump. (I felt my heart hurt when I called my beloved Sahara a dump just then.) They put in a tattoo/piercing shop but the cafe is no longer 24 hours; we had to walk down to Stratosphere for late night eats. They put in dollar blackjack tables by the Nascar cafe (in the weird ghost town part of the hotel that gets no traffic whatsoever). They are promoting the hell out of their player's club, too. 

Everything we touched had a layer of filth on it. Buttons stuck on the video poker machines (all of them - I swear.) and the bar had this sticky film on it that felt like that house we lived in during ""college"". Not in a good way.

By the end of the weekend, we had decided that was our final hurrah with the old girl. It's time to move on. I just don't have time to wash my hands that many times when I am trying to play blackjack. I need somewhere to eat at 4 in the morning. I would like a room where all of the light bulbs work. And I just might be willing to dip into my gambling budget to get there.

3671215,2009-06-29,0,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"Ok. Here's the deal. 

My buddies and I come for a week every year. This property is our choice for $1 dollar Blackjack, decent location, and affordable rooms. This is a 'dude' trip where accommodation aren't that important. 

One caveat - if you like playing cheap Blackjack this is the place. But they only bring this option a couple a times a year. We go every June and seem to hit this 'special offer' annually. So, if you're booking in the fall I doubt they will have these tables available unless you play between the hours of 4-6 AM. 

Another caveat is getting your room comp'd. Simply get a players card and play at the tables each night for about $50 buy in. I often would wager $5 when the pit boss was around and then would bump down to a buck when they weren't looking (usually when I was stemming the losses). You could easily put together an hour at the table. Cash out after an hour and VOILA you'll get a free room at the end of your stay if you ask them to verify your points on the players card. 

We don't bring our wives because we'd then choose a different property. The rooms are a little outdated. You will rarely have a room with a decent view simply by the configuration of the hotel property. 

The pool is usually clean, you can always find a lounge chair to sizzle beneath the sun (unlike the Mandalay), and they serve Newcastle.

As I've gotten older, my interest in Sahara has faded dramatically due to all the luxury and the opulence that other mega casinos has to offer... well, I'm a total sucker for nice things in life such as brands and atmosphere so I nearly completely fade out from Sahara... But during Labor Day weekend since my buddy stays here all the time and he suggested the cheap rates that they were offering, decided to give it another shot.

Checking in was good for us because we got there at 5:00AM!  Who in their right minds would be up at 5am to either check in or out right?  So there wasn't any lines and we were taken cared of immediately... (Not the case in the morning as the line is probably as long as any Disneyland rides during summer!)  

Got to our room and was nothing to be excited about...  (Again the snob in me was spoiled rotten after stays at Bellagio, Palazzo, Venetian, Aria, etc...)  Thin walls where we can hear people walking upstairs, people talking next door, etc...  Cold looking restroom floors with simple amenities which is not there to impress anyone...Beds were double twins so it's tiny for guys!!!  (Hey, we figure we are just crashing for the nights since we wouldn't be in the hotel much anyway), and the TV didn't even work.......

Hallway was dingy and not impressive at all, and get this... the clerk said that they gave us an upgrade, which was a ""semi strip view"" (which over looks the empty lot right across from the Sahara and nothing else), but the actual room amenities have been downgraded because my buddy said that they had some better rooms... sheesh.... some upgrade they offer here....

So overall the stay was simply just a stay... nothing impressive or exciting to talk about except that for Friday/Saturday it cost us $130 with tax for a holiday weekend.... so for those cost-centric people who don't care for the luxuries, this would be a great place to stay...

One more positive note!  (Gotta give props where it's due) it's their famous $1 blackjacks!  They had $1 blackjack tables (7 of them) going all day and closes at 2:00am.... so expect a more young crowd there because it's cheap!

I would stay again if it's a holiday weekend and I'm dying to be in Vegas, otherwise, I probably would skip and just take the monorail and visit Sahara to gamble instead....

I'm play a dorky MMORPG called DragonRealms (or DR for short).  If any of you fellow dorks (or even people from the 80s) that remember the old Infocom text based games like Zork or Enchanter, then you get the idea.  Game is like that, but a bit more complex.  Anyway, every year DR players gather twice a year, once at the official Simucon at St. Louis and the unofficial/player run convention in Las Vegas.

One of Simu's employees Solomon has his birthday in the first weekend of March, so it's good time for him to fly out, go out and eat, check out the strippers and drink until the early hours of the morning.  Oh, we do have a short game forum or it would be just another extented party and not a convention.  I've gone the last four years (twice at the Fountier, which has since been demo'ed) and twice here.

Here's my logic for a 3-star review:

For starters, our organizer got some pretty bomb-ass discounts for our room rates.  $60 Friday & Saturday and $40 Wedneday, Thursday, Sunday?  Yah, the rooms are pretty beat up (at least my non-smoking room only had a burn mark from a dropped iron right in the middle of the room) but our suite was OK.  Not like I slept much anyway, although I did gamble some and took walks and 30min naps here and there.

Sahara is the only casino where you can host a gathering like this and they let you bring in outside alcohol.  The hotel does have a small liquor store on site, but we're bringing up cases of beer, ice, mixers and whatnot, so we're not sitting at the main bar ordering $4.50 beers.

When I wasn't with the group, I spent a couple hours in their Abracadabrah bar (north side of the casino, before the NASCAR bar) and had nice pints of Bass or Guiness ($5 and $5.50), which was very reasonable (much better than the gal that ordered an MGD for $4.75).  They also had a $12 50oz (more like 48oz) draft promotion, so you get a nice 50oz-ish of Guiness and a nice big 50th anniversity glass to take home.  If you run into Jay from New York, he's the best bartender in the hotel.  He was also nice enough to find a barback to get boxes for my nice new glasses.

Gambling-wise I was down $91 for the weekend, play five sessions of craps.  People were either bucking the point or getting couple rolls before a 7-out.  Thank God I was hedging, but I had a couple tables where the dealers were less than cordial, so no odds bet on point for the boys.  My last table was terrible, as far as the dice went, but I learned a bit more from actual table time than at-home practice.  Hint: when making place bets just give the dealer a stack of chips and tell him what you want....giving exact change slows you down and I lost a couple of key rolls because of this.

Another Yelper mentioned the lack of $1 tables; they might have differnent table limits during the day/night, weekend/weekday, but $5 tables on the Strip are pretty much standard...if you're looking for $1 action, you need to go to Fremont Street.

So, one star for the beat up room, one star for having our groups own booze and one star for Jay from New York (but he's a five star bartender).",uS18t9K9qW6tfcyqqJGB9w,0,0,3,ZrQxoaW3XLdX3P8sinXozA

First the good: it's got a pool (though it's tiny, it still has one). The rooms are cheap. The tables are cheap. There's a monorail station at the back of the lobby.

Now everything else: The rooms are not great. They are in desperate need of remodeling and renovations, and upgrading out of the 80s. Stuff just seems to be falling apart. Dirty fixtures, stained carpets, just generally cheap & unclean. 

The breakfast buffet is disgusting. Pay a little extra and go to one of the nicer hotels for brunch. The food was inedible. When you can fashion a waffle into a make-shift shiv, you know you're in for a bad time.

Room service is expensive, and they charge you for every other amenity. $14 for internet? $5 a page to print out airline boarding passes? What?

What happens in Vegas, well, you know the rest. Anyway, this place is OLD. But it's kind of charming to see something old school amidst the shine and glitter. It reminds me of when I used to go to Vegas as a child w/ my parents and grandparents. I don't know if I'd stay here and actually sleep in a bed only because I don't know how clean it is. It's just so old so as far as upkeep goes, it's pretty... Well, I'd compare the rooms to a motel you found on the side of the freeway. No actual restaurants in the place (at least I don't think). And the tattoo shop said they were open twenty-four hours but when we went in at 3:30 in the morning to get our tattoos done, they were closed! So we had to take a cab to one that was open... Hehehehe.
I like the location. It's a quick $8.00 cab ride to just about anywhere on the strip. And they have that monorail stop there so that was convenient for the morning after when my feet was just not up to walking anymore and we didn't want to bother with a cab. The monorail is a real nice way to bounce around and sight see the town as well. Overall, kinda sad to know the Sahara will be no more in May, but it's certainly has it's fun...

4409581,2011-03-16,4,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"I stayed at the Sahara my first trip to Las Vegas. I had a room that was on the sign from the elevator, the first room on the floor. From the window to the right I could see Paradise Rd. towards Hilton while they were building some new attraction for Star Trek fans that I would later attend the opening of on another trip & the week before that closed, as a local. 

My trip was to meet a group of people who were fans of something that didn't have a name then, but now it would be an interactive websodic blog site. Sahara was undergoing construction & our big landmark by the lobby construction maze was a Red Dodge Viper you could supposedly win. That week was the U2 Pop Mart tour, which I found out too late. Too late because we were ""stuck"" in the casino the night of the concert, all of the taxis in town were dispatched to the concert somehow. I never thought to take the bus. This was long before the monorail, too. I think my trip was supposed to be for 4 days. I won so much money playing craps that I learned from annual weekend Reno bus trips, I was able to call back to work & somehow extend my vacation 3 more days. In retrospect, I have no idea how I pulled that off. My adrenaline was magic. I had a date that first weekend, an Arizona woman I met online months earlier from WBS chat. This World Wide Web thing got me to travel beyond the bay area & L.A. & see a world I never considered before with flashing lights, neon with no last calls.

That week I got around the strip, I saw a frame for a building with a huge ornament sticking out of the front. By the end of that week, I saw that it was supposed to look like some motorcycle jumping out of the front of what became Harley Davidson Cafe. I also tried out a club called The Beach that I wound up partying at for 3 new years eve's after.

Sahara had a $1 bar with beers & hot dogs that I remember used to be the Bra Bar, where women got hooked up when they gave it up. I remembered when the arcade used to have motion simulator movies besides the Nascar simulators. That was also a larger setup when it opened. I have many printouts from the simulator races, one was from a legendary trip with the guys & I can try to identify other printouts as using the sim as a ""sobriety test"" before driving my motorcycle home. 

One of the few Sundays I had off I went down during Nascar to watch under RoadZilla. I bought a wristband & every time my driver was in the lead, we got a free shot. I won 5 more than ""too many"" free shots & got to meet a couple of girls who had a room upstairs, but they were locals & this was a longshot of a bonus to me. 

I met the Amazing Johnathan & Psychic Tanya & saw their show there for the first time. I got to see & meet them at a few other shows since with some of my friends that are performers. I never go to do the GM auto drive that was behind Sahara. However, lemmie give shout outs to Record City, PT's (East) & Leatherby's delicious ice creams nearby!

I remember the 24 hour cafe well, used to be one of the best graveyard eats. I first noticed the $3 steak & egg breakfast I enjoyed for years was one of the first casualties of the worst recession of our time. I didn't see another $3 steak & egg special anywhere else since. 

One of the last things we did was see that show with Buddy's kid performing as Joey Bishop, the most under appreciated member of The Summit at the Sands. That was a time, when all the shows had live orchestras. Sahara pioneered the late night lounges that had the top acts, all performing for free, all packing the house out to the hall. I'm sad that I won't get to House of Lords again, but I hope a Rat Pack's former hangout down the street will live on for more decades. 

My last trip thru Sahara I'm not sure I remember because I didn't assume it would be my last. I lived off Sahara West by Palace Station & I got to walk thru Sahara from the monorail when I took it home from work. I got in a groove playing a bank of machines that according to a website paid out the most jackpots. I always at least got dinner out of it & a few beers when I partook on My Fridays.

I hope by the time Vegas gets money to build casinos again, people will realize how a wannabe whaler non-themed douche attracting McCasino is what's keeping us blue collar folk away. Yeah, us that were repeat customers who's real bucketfulls of quarters (not BS tickets) built the casinos with years of loyalty until the new managers try to bump the place up a star. At least go for a vintage classy themed casino. Even Disneyland got smart & re-themed Tomorrowland to ""vintage future."" My biggest hope is someone will get really smart & have a Vegas themed casino & replicate if not rescue from the boneyard a lot of the famous & infamous Nesco symbols of Vegas, from the Apache to Moulin Rouge, from the Sands to Hacienda, Silver Slipper to the Horseshoe.

They might as well change the street name back to San Francisco Ave.",zulBnf95Ji1_LAcQKyhi8w,5,5,5,9aIsWYEUvOgPVVxtmOGCKA

This review is only for the bar that serves up $1 hot dogs, beers and mini-shots (kamikaze on the several nights we were there).

Seeing how my brother end I ended up drinking in this bar no less than 3 times, I figure I'm a fan.

Now we did not intentionally set out to find the Sahara. One night (well I guess it was technically morning), we were wandering (on foot) up the strip to to check out the Stratosphere. On the way back we walked into the Sahara to check out these dollar shots. We ended up doing a couple shots (each - see photos) and drinking a few Miller beers (each) and in our inebriated state, had a great time. We passed on the hot dogs, since we saw no one eating them. 

A couple days later, my brother and I are taking the bus back from Fremont Street (again, after a night of wandering the casinos and drinking) and as the bus rolls up to the stop serving the Sahara, we jump off. This time we passed on the shots, but as hot dog consumption was in progress this time, we gave a couple a go and washed them down with, you guessed it, a few more $1 Millers. Now I would not go out of my way for this hot dog (the $2 foot long at the Casino Royale is better), but if you've been drinking all night, the hot dog is actually OK.

On both nights (mornings?), with beers in hand we stood and watched the poker players. It seemed a good snapshot of life in the middle of the strip. 

Our third time in the Sahara was to see The Magic and Tigers of Rick Thomas. How can you stand next to a bar serving $1 beers and not have a couple?

So anyways, that's my experience with the Sahara, $1 at a time.

PS. If you are a glutton for punishment, there is a sports bar offering up a 6-pound burrito (as seen on ""Man vs. Food"") that is free if you finish it (in under 90 minutes). Otherwise it $19.99, but you do get a free T-shirt. Which T-shirt you get depends on whether you finish it or not.",I4eTqRHq93iElqq4f5istw,2,2,4,dMS6IzQvR0MahL8vlmCdcw

To be fair, I really should write separate reviews for the hotel and the casino.  I'll start with the hotel.  The Sahara is pretty much the cheapest hotel in Vegas that won't give you something potentially fatal or disfiguring by coming into contact with the sheets.  If you stay here I reccomend you splurge for one of the premium room.  The standard rooms are just a little TOO beat up.  I mean hey, old school is cool and all, and I figure at least one of the cigarrette burns in the table was probably done by Elvis or something, but man I need internet and other amenities or I'm staying someplace else.  I would give the hotel as a stand alone two stars.

Now for the casino.  The Sahara casino has all the charisma and charm of a 67 year old hooker with missing teeth.  It used to be different there.  They used to have $1.00 blackjack tables.  Those tables rocked.  You've never met so many happy people sitting gambling.  There was usually a twenty plus minute wait for those tables.  Anyone with half a brain would have designated MORE tables as $1.00 blackjack tables, right?  You do know what's coming next... they raised the table minimums to $5.  Idiots.  During the week I can gamble on five dollar tables in MUCH NICER casinos.  Why the hell would I go to the Sahara if you're not going to offer me something better or cheaper?

OK, so then, and this is the final straw for me, they had this one game of blackjack where you could put another dollar down and if you got  natural blackjack you could push a button and win up to a grand (but you normally only won like five or ten bucks).  It was fun, and once again it filled tables.  So, what do you think they did with it?  Yep, they did away with it.

Friggin' IDIOTS.  So now the Sahara is mostly emplty and the people that are there are the 80 year old smoking while carrying their oxygen tank around crowd and people from the 909.  This is why I give the Casino one star.  You average my score for the hotel with the casino and that's how I arrived at two stars.

The good thing about this place is that it actually has a monorail stop, which means you can get from point A (the Sahara) to point B (as far as possible, which would be the MGM, or anywhere in between) in a snap. The second star out of 5 would be the pool. Although I didn't actually get in, I had the chance to spend some side-by-side time with it, and I thought the scene was pretty charming. The size of the bed was nice, and the water pressure was fine.

For about 5 1/2 hours myself and two friends played countless hands of blackjack, had about 10 free drinks each, and between the three of us we'd only lost about $40.  That's a bargain for the amount of fun we had.

After this place goes, the award for the lowest blackjack minimums on the strip will probably belong to Circus Circus. We spotted a few $2 and $3 tables there.

The Sahara had a ""Caution: Wet Floor"" stand pushed against the urinal, this amongst what looked and smelled like piss on the floor.  Used paper towels strewn all over the place, unflushed toilets with you-know-what inside. I kind of wanted to puke all over the floor, but then again I doubt anyone would have noticed.

Okay, glad that's out of my system.  The rest of the casino just looks dingy.  The prevalence of the NASCAR theme inside did a lot to make me really truly hate this place.

5465931,2011-05-14,8,ry-FLqYclt7okJbdYcmOhw,"Honestly, it doesn't really matter what I write here.  In a few days, the Sahara Casino, a 59 year old Vegas institution and the last of the ""original"" casinos is closing its doors.  It doesn't matter if it was amazing or a total dump.  In fact, I've argued with many that cheer its demise because people confuse ""original"" and ""older"" as being synonymous with ""demolish fodder"".  And to be fair, it's a little of both these days, but it never should have reached the point of these last few hours.

Instead, I'll write about my experiences here, and what the Sahara meant to me.  2002 was the first time that I ever stepped foot in this city as a tourist, and it was the place that I stayed in.  I clearly missed to the ""Golden Days"" when the Rat Pack, Elvis, Beatles, Liberace, and so many  vintage stars graced the locale.   I clearly missed all that, as the bitter and entitled pointed out to me, but I didn't miss its value and history. 

I still periodically stopped by the Sahara from time to time.  I got excited finding the (still to this day) preserved Room 2344 in the Alexandria Tower where the Beatles stayed.  When I moved here and was at times broke, I ate at their buffet.  Not the most amazing food in the world, but it definitely had its place in that time of my life.

Two months ago, when I heard that the Sahara was closing, I decided to really give the old place a real chance.  I bought a few souvenirs before fans and eBay scavengers picked the place clean.  At an unofficial Yelp event, our group tried their crazy fast rollercoaster.  I spent years scoffing at their NASCAR Cafe, only to discover that they serve a delicious hot open faced turkey sandwich.  In retrospect, I guess the joke was on me.  I even ate at the House of Lords, and was treated to exceptional customer service.  Even just last night, the missus won over $300 on slots there.  

SBE purchased the place in 2007.  I hoped they would recognize Sahara's rarity and renovate it, because it needed work: New carpet, new wallpaper, new paint, a better ventilation system, non-scary elevators....  But none of it ever came, and over time, some of the eating places closed down months before the announcement.  Considering Vegas' disregard and total lack of interest for its own personal history, I figured one day they would just kill Sahara off and leave it an empty lot with other ""legends"" such as the Stardust and the New Frontier.

I've heard that in 2014, something will be put in its place, but it won't be called ""Sahara"".  Instead, it will invariably be yet another trendy corporate created venue that will tell an all too receptive public that this is the place that they will HAVE to frequent in order to be ""cool"" these days.  And people will (already) eat it up for the same celebrities who are famous for simply being famous, repetitive music and overpriced drinks you can get at every other venue on the Strip.  Modern progress.   If you can't Twitter it, it's not worth the time.

But this is it: The last of the originals closes its door.  I'd like to believe that one day, people will come to understand the value of what these old places meant.  Sahara housed LEGENDS.  Not the impersonators that people can pose for a photo op with these days, and certainly not wannabes.  If not for those ""firsts"" that populated this once remote desert oasis, Vegas would probably not have been much bigger than Baker, California these days. 

So yes, I am saddened and more than a little disappointed that Vegas lets yet another ""first"" slip away into the history books where it's somehow strangely easier to value and appreciate once it's gone.  

I'm definitely ""late to the party"" on ""Sahara Appreciation"", but I still built nine years of fond memories of my own.  Its closing also marks the end of a chapter in my personal life.  It is, and always will be, my very first taste of Vegas.  The last two months, though sad, filled me with a lot of wonderful and lasting stories of the place. I'm glad I took the time to get to know it one last time, and I'll see it off come Monday as it closes down.

Have fun!",WUbg61aynUeETjo3AL3pIQ,4,1,2,F6q7dnOlCerFqI5XBLNAtA

I think I'll always have a soft spot in my heart for The Sahara, though. I liked how they put your name on the television set, welcoming you to your room. I also liked that they made decent drinks in the casino... you know, the free ones you get while gambling?

PLUS, I won over $500 here in one day, which is pennies to some people, but for a novice like me, it was A LOTTA DOUGH!!! I was totally kvelling over my winnings! There were a mix of people in this place, too... young, middle-aged, old.... though not as many old people as were at The Plaza. 

My hubby, sister, her friend, my mom and my new step dad all had a great time here! The food in the restaurants wasn't bad, either. The breakfast buffet upstairs was actually pretty darned cool, even though it's in a cafeteria-like setting. They had anything you could ever want for breakfast, and it's 'all you can eat', which is why we go to Vegas in the first place, baby!

The Sahara is a bargain for a Strip hotel. I recommend it! (Just don't expect fancy shampoos or soaps in your room, or mints on your pillow. At least the rooms didn't REEK like the ones in The Plaza.)

Go, have fun. Win some money! Just save some for ME!!!",o2UkwgSKx8i-YtUtDD5vNg,0,0,4,YpyxKJrb2O_l1GJ5f8NuPw

This is a great place for Vegas first-timers. Relaxed and completely non-pretentious atmosphere. The people (both dealers and patrons) are all pretty cool and will help you out if you're not quite sure what you're doing. It's not fancy or ""upscale"" but that was just fine with us - I'm a little turned off by the more extravagent venues anyway.

Drinks are free when you're gambling - that might be how all of the casinos work. This is the only casino I played in during my week in Vegas and we spent a few hours almost every day here playing blackjack and roulette.",z5ubBt92XMGRuKNFLf01Hg,1,0,4,83rdD_f_POTct4QU4abGvw
