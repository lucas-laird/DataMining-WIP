Now granted, I'm in a desperate state trying to find some variety on the Eastside for my lunch fix.  Luckily, i'm only out and about 2 times / week so i  usually hit catfish alley,  Pho Thanh, las pupusa and a few others.

I think this place comes close to  Capriotti's - darn close.  And come on, at a run down gas station ? Now granted, i'm not a cheesesteak expert, though i've eaten at geno's and Pat's ( i prefer Pat's )  but on one of my visits i brought along a PA born cheesesteak ""expert"" - he gave the place a thumbs up   

 I tried the Cheeseburger my last visit - $3.95 for a 1/2 pounder with cheese and grilled onions ...ehhh ok. 

I noticed a south philly cheesesteak place at trop and pecos near the BofA - I'm thinking a two hour lunch - hit them up and then off to play me  some pinball !",N044aCKJv3G5WuvwT5AJcA,3,2,4,qaEqX9y2U2c4Oe5N8BcHTA

I got a medium chicken cheesesteak with wiz and onions.  Medium is 12"". The large is 18"". Definitely wasn't that hungry. 

The sandwich was awesome! Next time I'll add some hot sauce but thats just me. I dont remember one ever being as good from pops.. I doubt I'll ever go there again now that I have tried this place.

If this place can come up with more options like Garlic cheeseteaks, bacon cheeseteaks for example, they would be even better.

In fact, two different places served up amazing ones in gas stations.  So I don't know why I would doubt that the best Philly's would be in a gas station here.  

There are not words to adequately describe the pleasure of eating one of their Philly Cheesesteak sandwiches.  No it's still not as good as the real thing in Philadelphia, but it is as close as I've had especially out here.  The pricing is so cheap, and if you're really hungry they offer a 24 inch option.  Yes that's 2 feet of amazing deliciousness!  

It's easy to miss this place, as it is located inside the gas station.  However if you're hungry don't overlook this amazing establishment.  

The bread was full of flavor, the steak was cooked well and mixed great on the griddle with the peppers, onions, mushrooms, and cheese.  The steak was full of flavor, and the toppings were a perfect addition.  The first bite was like meeting an amazing memory of taste of the best cheesesteaks I've had in my life.  Subsequent bites were enough to convince me that I will be back whenever I'm looking for a cheesesteak.

The only downer- though the gas station is always open, the Cheesesteak shop is not.  You have to catch this deliciousness between ""normal"" lunch and dinner hours.

He handed me two sandwiches assuming it's pretty large and he cut it half. Right off of the first bite, I knew I did not enjoy it.. It tasted like regular skirt steak, unflavored meat with a lot of provolone cheese on an Albertsons hoagie roll.

The price is right, portions are generous, and your cheesesteak is ready in less than 5 minutes. 

The hoagie roll is steamed and softened. Each cheesesteak comes with fried onions, cheese, mushrooms, and peppers at no additional charge. (They're not out here trying to nickel and dime you.) I've had them with provolone and Cheez Whiz, but prefer Whiz because it makes for a juicier cheesesteak.

I heard through the grapevine that this place is so popular, our armed forces regularly place orders for the legendary cheesesteaks and have them shipped.

I was disappointed in the quality of the meat....it was like steak em. The seasoned fries were cooked perfect but was a small portion. I will give them another try someday....",lPiV7OBtN20GnINAnYNe-A,0,0,3,IupwKfRn4Bo6ADEU9QHhyg

The cheese steaks are delicious, down to the bread, the thinness of the meat, the seasoning.  

Just show up, place your order, pay at the register and pick up your delicious cheese steak with the grumpy cook of the day.",Kdw_YdRebcR8v4ZYz_fMEA,0,0,5,4v594iHx9R1UXOG4OKFWsQ
5391253,2017-01-31,2,ml9WFLPNAIryG6zQnd9qBA,Before Yelp this was mine and my brothers little hidden secret. Now I try to get a philly and it's super packed with blue collar folks raving about how a gas station serves these great sandwiches. Thanks Yelp for making this place a trend. Now all you Yelp elites should move on to a different gas station. The beef philly is great and so is the chicken philly. Get over it.,kpbUJB-Gq40o7ObDbt5TUQ,0,0,4,nDWv-NJLbMa6dUUUT1fAGQ

It could be from the fact that the 7 sandwiches we ordered had no cheese on them at all.  First when we called about it they stated that the cheese was mixed in the meat.  After calling bs on that one person took their unbeaten portion down to them. They said well we fold the meat around the cheese is in the middle.  He owned the sandwich and ask I'd they could identify the cheese in the sandwich they could not and made a new sandwich.  I called after to ask why they didn't replace the other sandwiches as well  after a few choice words from the male employee u spike to I decided to hang up instead of listening to his rant anymore. I will not be visiting our eating at this place again.",1IWeDxCP2gmQBGlsJa1bwg,0,0,1,r__v9fLxZ7iCiRsZJVbmpg

Our order was ready in 15 minutes- that should of gave it away because they are not the fastest in getting food out. The cook - not very personable had our bag ready to go. My error I did not check our order before we left. When we got home we were disappointed- there were limited fries (we ordered 2 large) and not very fresh. Needless to say, we will not be going back. Customer service is poor and the food was horrible.",y_WActRdNf3BGUhdQCqUqg,0,0,1,6euvj-4ECqpqSpEF0fF38Q

Don't be fooled by the gas station, this is by far the tastiest Philly chicken and steak sandwiches. 
The bread is soft, quick service.

Great prices!",WuXAHFRLv6DLp26HMzpAVA,0,0,5,N9tTXx2vQvtQpdMrla9UKw
