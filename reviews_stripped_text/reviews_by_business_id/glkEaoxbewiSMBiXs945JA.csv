So you order your Pizza a lot like subway sandwich shop, I just had sausage and cheese  thin crust, for  $12.00  for about a medium sized pie. To sum this up it was the worst Pizza I ever had, for it to be natural burning oven, the cheese did not melt very well and it was very rubbery, the sausage was pre-cooked which meant when the put it in the oven it really dried out, the sauce had no flavor just bland, no spices at all. If you plan on going here do yourself a favor and don't.  Worst Pizza Ever!!!",G1ndiCwXXOC8m6nQxo_H5Q,0,0,1,mMbq4ChHUBqJ5dcAElQAcg

The red sauce was average at best but I thought the basil pesto sauce was slightly above average.  I noticed when the place became busy, they struggled with timing of food delivery.  Salads were released at the same time as the pizza which meant the entree was cold by the time you finished with the salad.  Also noticed a tendency to overcook (burn) the crust when busy which I found strange - would have expected a more raw crust as cooks hurried.",wiXcVSxpJGCfZ-AeyUBLRA,0,0,3,SzApf6B86d2zcrd7lsyaMw

You'll see an assembly line of employees upon entering. Pick the pizza you want and any add ons are an additional $1.50. We got the margherita with added rosemary ham, mushrooms, and spinach as well as ""the carni"" with salsiccia, pepperoni, meatballs, and rosemary ham with added artichokes. Also got the burrata with melon and proscuitto that comes with bread. Pay up then you'll get a number they'll call out when your order's ready.

Verdict: it was okay. You get hints of wood burnt taste from the way it was made. I appreciated that. Although, the carni surpassed in flavor compared to the margherita. Tip: the more add ons, the more difficult it'll be for your pizza to hold up since it's so thin. The burrata was good. Prosciutto and the melon blended well but I don't think I'd get it again for the price.

Also got a glass of Prosecco for $10 and a glass of beer for $9. They serve gelato too. 

Overall, it was a good lunch although it was more on the pricier side when everything totaled up. Would I come back? Maybe, just because I have had better. I admit, while I was in a piece of carb heaven and even eating my date's crusts, my mind and taste buds were thinking of how I couldn't help but compare it to Settebello Pizzeria...",Ucn8yabLDIiDasbLkNy0Ng,8,7,3,URN9XnNzJ7vGKYIoQPufhw

Great value though for the size of pizza, $14 including a tip for a pizza that could probably feed two not so hungry people or satisfy one really hungry person.

109879,2016-02-09,0,glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA,"I love this place. People complain because they don't put so many toppings and Chinese. People are  used to   pizzas with toppings, that you can't taste individual topping. This is a very clean and flavorful pizza. Yes it's a little  pricier pizza but it's worth it, if you know what a good pizza is supposed to taste like. I like the Bianca pizza that's a no tomatoes. I get truffle cheese that's an extra $3 but only recommend that if you like truffles because truffles are very strong in flavor or sometime I get African water  Buffalo cheese $6 more very good love this cheese. I also sometime get an egg on it wow . When you go, ask for your pizza to have a chewy  crust. Sometime I go and they give me an employee discount which is 50%off  But not always just because I give them a good tip, but if you go there and get a pizza like I did YOU would pay over $20 for a pizza that's for one person this would be $8 for the base $3 prosciutto 1.50 soppressata 1.50 one egg organic 1.50  sausage $6 for extra bufala cheese and or $3 truffle cheese. But I only get all of that when I  want to pig  out like an American. Yes it is an assembly line but that's the only way they can get your pizza done by time you get to the register.

You have a choice of creating your own pizza order or ordering a pizza off the menu. Each topping was extra, and I ordered a mushroom and spinach pizza. My boyfriend ordered the spicy meatball. It took about 20 minutes for our order to come out, and they ended up somehow losing my boyfriend's order and had to remake it, which took another 10 minutes. The pizza crust was slightly burnt and overall the pizza was not tasty. I've definitely had better pizza.

284665,2015-01-18,0,glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA,"Wanted to stop somewhere for a quick bite before a show last night.  First choice had a huge line waiting to get in (place just opened), so I continued down the strip and ended up at 800 Degrees.

Really cool concept, you walk in, and there's a guy working the pizza dough (all pies are same size, 12"").  When he's finished, your dough moves to the next station: sauce, cheese, the basics.  Then if you'd like to add any more ingredients you can for $1.50 each.  I chose the basic Margherita pizza, reasonably priced @ under $8.  Move down the line, pay for your order, and your pie goes into the 800+ degree oven.  It's cooked in a couple minutes, and your ready to eat.

At first I was kinda disappointed when I picked up the first slice and all the toppings slid off.  However, upon further investigation (there's a brochure right by the entrance), I learned that you're supposed to eat this type of pie with a knife & fork, I guess that's ""Neopolitan"" style.   Once I armed myself with the proper utensils, it was a much better experience.  The pizza was a little soggier than I would like, but it did have a nice flavor, the crust was great.  It did get cold a bit quicker than expected, however.  My last couple slices were at room temperature by the time I finished.

Overall, I'd say this place is a decent value, especially for a strip eatery.  Definitely better than a Sbarro, or other franchise place. However, as a LV local, I'll probably stick to my neighborhood joints in the future.",4QnjCKq__RCVVhYvFwfb6g,1,0,2,I02e5IQDbkJYYa7D6BZpSQ

Here, however, It turns out that they charge you $1.50 (plus tax, of course) for EACH and EVERY topping you choose, even if it's only one or two little pieces. To make it worse, the sign that informs you of this is the FOURTH one on the wall, and it's in smaller letters, so it's unlikely you would ever even SEE it. I was appalled, and I felt like I got snaked.

I am convinced they did this on purpose. I felt that this was very sneaky, and highly unethical.",mD8_Xb0mCTwHdqOZpAti-A,0,0,1,KY0FG0PzknH4v93kWZTZgw

I had eaten there once before, and I was pleased with pretty much everything I ordered, from the pizza to the salad, even the burrata (though priced a bit high) was tasty and delicious. In fact I was impressed enough that I told my boyfriend who loves pizza all about it, saying that we would try it the next time we visited Vegas. I was even able to grab a $50 MyVegas dining credit so we would be able to try pretty much anything we wanted.

We went ahead and got the voucher, then walked out of the Monte Carlo, excited for some pizza debauchery. Only we found the doors locked and the employees cleaning up for the night while a few patrons finished up their meals inside. We arrived right around 10pm (it's Vegas right?), easily inside posted hours, it's not like we were trying to sneak in 5 minutes before closing. Their stated hours are 11am-2am on their own website, 11-12am on Monte Carlo's and 11am-11pm on Yelp (inconsistent much?) so we didn't even think twice about the late hour, we were excited for some pizza.

Talk about being let down, this was our last night in Vegas so there was literally no tomorrow. We had to run back inside and scramble for another place to eat. We even had the super nice lady at the desk check the hours again, and then sat around while she changed the voucher to another restaurant at the Monte Carlo. (The Chinese place Dragon Noodle was solid, but we were pretty bummed at that point.)

Our most recent visit, and likely our last, we ordered and left. I told the guy working the dough (and I've seen more than once them picking something out of it which isn't at all appetizing to watch - what are you picking out?!) at the beginning of the counter that we wanted a margherita with toppings. He said, ""okay,"" and I moved down the counter to where the toppings are. It always seems to take FOREVER for these guys to get the dough perfectly shaped. A little pat here, a little pat there... This isn't art class and your little pats are doing nothing to improve the pizza and I'm yelling, ""hurry up!"" in my head. Then I hate watching them put sauce on, because it reminds me of how little they put! It's like they are challenging themselves to how little of it they can spread around and make it look like there's something there. So I'm standing there and waiting for someone else to finish it off with breaking apart and spreading around the blob of mozzarella cheese so that they can finally take my toppings order, when suddenly all of these customers that came in AFTER me are working their way past me at the direction of the counter guys. The guy with my margherita is pointing at a guy behind me to follow him to the toppings counter. The staff behind the counter pay no attention to me. HELLO?! Do any of you behind the counter think I might be standing there for a reason?! You guys left me high and dry and I'm now just a road block for all of the customers you DID remember. I worked my way back to the beginning of the counter and told the dough guy that took my order that this ordering line system sucks and that I'm leaving. He offered no apology and said he could make my pizza right at that moment, but I left on principle. I walked through the Monte Carlo to Sbarro's and got a couple of slices of pizza without incident. 
As far as the pizza goes, it's always soggy in the center. If you order sausage, beware of it being undercooked. My daughter loves sausage but I wouldn't let her eat the pink sausage crumbles. Their pizza is cooked in 60 seconds, which isn't long enough to safely cook pork.
Yea, I know it's Neapolitan style pizza, to be eaten with knife and fork, but I've had better and this place just doesn't do it for me. I wish Monte Carlo had a better pizza joint on the plaza than this.",xQDRytksJkMPErWHvC1xjA,1,0,1,EpYSBoL2xtqCd9imNmYSUQ

There was a bit of a line when we arrived, but the vast restaurant space with high ceilings and excellent detail made the wait enjoyable. Also, provided us time to figure out what to order. 

800 degrees offers individual pizzas which are made to order. They feature both traditional and some modern takes on pizza. They are all very reasonably priced for a 13"" hand stretched pizza. 

We ordered the piccante and zucca both were good. The piccante was very spicy due to the Calabrian chilies which were put on it. However, ours had more of the oil and less of the peppers than I would have liked. This made the crust a little soggy. 

The zucca was very good, but I felt that it was a little light on the toppings, I would have liked to see a little more quash on it and onions. 

I felt that the oven was a little hot and therefore the bottom of the pizza didn't get golden brown. But I guess it is called 800 degrees. 

We also ordered a couple of their beers on tap and they paired perfectly. Overall good experience, although my card got rung up incorrectly and a $15 tip was placed on a $40 order.

I went for the Sausage & Peppers, which is their thin crust pizza topped with Italian sausage, peppadews, and caramelized onions.  I also added artichoke as an additional topping and I gotta say, I was quite impressed.  All the toppings' quality is tops and that sausage was straight up addicting.  I sorta wanted to give them a bad review just cause I wish there was more.  Usually I don't like crust but couldn't get enough of the thin crust here!  Mozza and sauce was great as well.
 
Since it is the Strip location, it is much pricier.  Pizzas are a few bucks more and for each topping added, it is $1.50.  Oh well.

Tried two salad here: Caesar and the Gorgonzola.  Definitely go for the Gorgonzola if a salad is a must.  The candied walnuts did it for me.  The Caesar was just way too bland.  But really, just get more pizza instead of salad.

Burrata options on the menu.  Will definitely try that some other time.

They also have some craft beers on draft, and at the time, Goose Island!

So they do have a list of pizzas if you're super indecisive or not sure what you want, ranging from about $11 - $15. 

If you make your own pizza you choose your sauce - Marinara, Bianca (white pizza), Pesto, or Margherita

Then you can choose as many proteins, cheese, vegetables as you like! All toppings are $1.50 except for special ones like truffle oil, shrimp those are $3  , and $6 for buffalo cheese. 

I went back there twice during my stay in Vegas , very yummy and fast and honestly prices aren't terrible considering you're in Vegas.

As for the salad, also underwhelming.  I got the burrata with artichoke tapanade and olives.  There was almost no arugula.  The olives were extremely salty.  Also of note, nobody bothered to make the salad while my pizza was cooking despite there being almost no wait.  I had to wait first for the salad, then for the bread to be toasted.

I have typically gone with the Margherita base on the traditional crust and have yet to be disappointed. All of the ingredients are fresh and packed with plenty of flavor.

I am a vegetarian and this turned out to be a great option as you have a couple of non meat options to choose from. You can control the amount of cheese so that you can enjoy a pizza with the taste of toppings and not have a cheese rush. 

They have nice toppings to choose from. The only thing missing is a selection of bell peppers. But there are many others to choose from. 

For the extra cautious vegetarian, they even have separate pizza cutters for vegetarian and non vegetarian pizzas. 

The downside is the lack of beverage options. They boast that they have over 150 coke products, but people are trying to avoid them now a days. So some other options will be appreciated. 

The salad bar lacked some ingredients and dressing choices as well IMO.

So, we had this as a light lunch because the boo and I split the pizza after a day out by the pool. It was very tastey. If you're staying at the monte carlo, having a pizza place just down stairs is a very nice convenience. I did not go down with the S.O. to buy it but he came back within 20-30 minutes with a Margherita pizza and he added ham to it.

When my wife and I arrived, the man shaping the dough greeted us and had some small talk. The ordering process was smooth and fairly uneventful. The menu is simple and that's suiting to a place like this. You don't want to over complicate a place like this because of the way orders are placed. 

We ended up going with the Verde (pesto) base with extra garlic, oregano, smoked gouda, pepperoni, and chicken. The process was speedy and we had paid and got our drinks pretty quickly. By the time we got to our seat, our pizza was done. Nice and quick. 

My first impression was that, due to such high temperatures, the crust can get a little too done in spots. However, that didn't really bother me. The crust was good and the toppings were pretty good, too. The pesto base was about right, but the pizza overall was a bit heavy on the olive oil. The reason for this is because pesto is made with olive oil and then they also put more olive oil on the pizza after all toppings are on. I think they do this with all pizzas, but for a pizza with a pesto base, this is unnecessary. 

That all being said, my wife and I still enjoyed the pizza and would not hesitate to go back. The speed of service is excellent and the price is one of the better deals on the strip, in my opinion.

The first warning sign:  There were only 4 customers in the entire restaurant when we walked in.  There were 11 people behind the counter working.  It was weird... they were all kind of just standing around, and a few of them were just watching others work.  Restaurants that aren't busy (and are empty) are usually like that for a reason.  We soon learned why.

The pizza I ordered was a pepperoni, olive & pineapple.  The woman making it was nice, but I have to admit the pizza didn't even look all that great when it was being made.  She used very few ingredients, it seemed.  For roughly $15 for a personal size pizza, it seemed average at best while it was being made.

I got to the cash register to pay, and a new cashier was being trained that day.  It took quite a bit longer than I expected.  As I looked around, I'm thinking now that maybe even the cooks and prep people were being trained as well.  There were what appeared to be a few managers just standing around watching them like a hawk.  It was odd.  Three months into a new restaurant, I would've expected things to be running smoother.

The pizza arrived.  The edges were black on the crust and I like them that way.  However, a closer glance revealed that the entire interior of the pizza was either undercooked or uncooked.  Picking up the first slice, it was clear that the thing was a complete mess.  The entire pizza toppings slid off, including cheese and everything.  I was left holding a wet piece of literally uncooked dough with some tomato sauce.  It was a rubbery mess and the entire middle of the pizza was drowned in wetness and was more of a soup than a pizza!  The whole thing was gooey, wet and runny.  The crust was so thin and undone that it was a drooping disaster.  Each slice was like that:  watery, dripping, and unable to even stand up like a normal pizza slice.  

It was inedible.  Before I left, I scooped some of the soup-like toppings on a fork, and it didn't even taste good.  The crust had no flavor at all.  I will never be back, and would implore anyone reading this to think twice about ever stepping foot in this place.  There's a reason it ended up on one of the lower-end Vegas properties like Monte Carlo rather than someplace like the Cosmopolitan, Aria or Caesar's Palace.

Situated along Las Vegas Blvd right at the front of Monte Carlo Casino, this is a great pit stop for quick lunch/dinner while strolling  around the area.

I like how you get to customize any pizza as the staff whips it up.  I say start off with Margherita and pile it up with desired toppings.  Being a NYC pizza fan, I prefer picking up and folding my pizzas in half.  Unfortunately, this is not the case for Neopolitan pizza as they're quite thin and soggy; we were even adviced to use silverware instead of picking it up.  Nonetheless, the crust was tasty and ingredients were fresh.

Due to its location, a pint of beer costs $9 which I succumbed to since theres really nothing better than washing down amazing pizza with a cold glass of Moretti.

Overall, 800 Degrees Pizza has delicious pizzas and superb customer service.  As a local, I probably won't come back as often especially since Settebello is just right around my neighborhood.",6jQIcIkPbztzZ3rq0NNclg,1,2,4,-RfwEGWOpTbhXciE-m31Ag

You can watch them make the dough fresh for you which just seemed to make it taste that little bit better somehow, and I liked that it wasn't too heavy. They have a number of suggested pizza classics or you can go off piste and create your own entirely - which my sister and I ended up doing as the list of ingredients was just too inviting.
We split a pizza and a salad half each - and were impressed at how huge the salad portion was. We also liked being able to add things like pepper and chilli flakes ourselves at the condiments counter - ok clearly we got carried away by the novelty factor given we don't have anything like this in the UK!

Staff was ok, but not inviting or helpful. You have to remember that EVERYTHING you put on this pizza will cost you 1.50 each, which adds up quick. I don't mean just meats or cheeses, but even veggies of any sort. Puts them below Subway in my eyes at this point.
Anyways, it was expensive. They put the pizza in the oven and you wait. Took a while, but not agonizingly long.

2291661,2014-12-15,0,glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA,"I will preface this review with service can certainly make a difference, but alas in the end can not save a meal. However, with what I review I feel I am fair and I leave it up to the yelper reading this to decide whether 800 degrees deserves a shot or if it should be essentially passed up..With that said ""eat up"" the following

Upon walking to 800 degrees (located on the right as you walk out of Monte Carlo towards the strip side) I pieced together that it does really have a subway feel to it and it's almost borderline cafeteria style preparation of the pizza which is nice because you won't get the ""chef special""..=OP

The journey began with a gentleman who prepares and flips the dough..Onwards to the topping area where I do admit the ingredients for being ""out"" did seem to keep their freshness from an observational stand point at least..I had my heart sold on the tropicale (roasted pineapple, ham, and jalapenos), but I was the one left saying aloha in the end!

I took the pizza back to my hotel room and portion wise it is possible to share it amongst 2 people so there's a plus at least..Upon opening the pizza box I did find the crust to be paper thin and didn't seem to adjust well to being picked up as the toppings and sauce slipped right down and I was left with essentially a soggy piece of dough. It did look a bit heavy on the grease at the bottom of the box which attributed I'm sure to that. There was a sign by the register upon paying which did say they are willing to remake it if it falls short of your expectations so had I been closer I would have requested a re-fire of the meal so I can't knock them for that. In fact I do respect that they are willing to go that extra mile for the overall satisfaction of the customer if their product falls short of expectations.

I do have to comment on the staff as they were quite inviting and weren't pushy during the preparation. I think taste wise the experience would have been much different in house vs. my hotel room so I am open to giving it another shot and if it disappoints me in round 2 I will make the trek to project pie who at least for now blows them out of the water!",o0TZ2hroc7DK6CM73ll-1g,0,0,3,gXjYiv1TOtI6HkOG5r6T3g

2435720,2015-09-01,3,glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA,"Came to this location twice in a 3 day Vegas bender. By bender I really mean a nice quiet stay on the strip, with my husband, to escape the Minnesota cold. We pick a different hotel every year. This time we stayed at Vdara Hotel and Spa, a quick monorail ride and some escalators later we found ourselves at Monte Carlo, home of 800 Degrees. Where the magic happens. 

When I think of my favorite pizza, I think of Punch Neapolitan Pizza in Minneapolis. Well let's just say, as I was eating, I feared that I had to move Punch down to the Number 2 spot. 800 Degrees has every single aspect of the perfect pizza, for me. Fresh ingredients that you can see and choose from, cooked in an alarmingly hot fire for about 2 minutes until it's done, put on a plate, sliced in front of you and handed over with a smile from one of the nice staff members. Quick, efficient, cheesy, and a fire burnt crust. 

The fact of the matter is my Margherita with pepperoni and gorgonzola was so damn good on our first visit that it made me come back on our last day for another pizza. This time I got the Margherita with feta cheese, kalamata olives and pepperoni. For some completely strange reason, I couldn't finish it, which almost never happens. I swear. The first pizza I almost inhaled and nearly got started on the plate. I attribute that to a long flight, and nothing to eat for 8 hours, a raging cold and sore throat, made me one cranky ravenous traveler. So on the last visit, I got a box to go, and had it for a late night snack high up in my Corner Suite on the 51st floor, where it had been resting in the fridge and waiting for the microwave. Yes, the Vdara is that awesome - all the rooms come with a full kitchen. 

Maybe next time we should stay at the Monte Carlo so I can be close to my pizza. I am infatuated with that damn pizza. But I still love you, Punch!",yOADvvEUHheLZs1BSoxTDw,6,4,5,qfFp8ftHetNFelv72GsrHg

Of those I have to say that the Spicy Meatball and Sausage & Peppers pizzas are my favorite. I love spicy and they both provide the perfect amount :) I also really enjoy the option of the Marinara Pizza because it has no cheese and I'm lactose intolerant (sometimes I like to live dangerously, people), and it's a nice break from the stomach cramps LOL. I've also had the Gorgonzola and Caesar salads and they are AMAZING.

The prices aren't too bad. All pizzas come in the same size (gluten-free dough is available) and are about $12. They can feed two people about 3 slices each (big slices). 

The only down side is that the sauce makes the dough really soggy so when you pick up a slice it falls apart because the ingredients are also heavy. Other than that I have no complaints.",zgFpxIm2_I86lhtHOdmjsQ,0,1,4,ID1C_JmndlQ3XVAeI1aphQ

Ordered the base margarita pizza and truffle cheese bread. The staff was friendly and it was cool to see the pizza dough chucked into the air spinning. It did take about 20 minutes standing in line and other patrons were getting frustrated as it seemed like they were not operating like a well-oiled machine. 

Food reviews- Good thin pizza. Nothing mind blowing. Truffle cheese bread was more like a calzone stuffed with cheese and plenty of grease. Ordered for two people but cheese bread could easily serve 4-6.

2535521,2017-01-05,0,glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA,"Items I tried:
- Sausage and peppers pizza
- Baby Kale salad 

800 degrees is located right off Las Vegas Blvd in front of the revamped entrance to the Monte Carlo Casino. 

I wanted a casual and quick place to have dinner while in town for business. Pizza looked good and I dropped in for a quick bite. 

The layout and large dining room make 800 degrees really inviting. Ordering is similar to Blaze Pizza where you either pick a pizza from their menu or build your own. Build your own comes with a base you select and each addition topping was $1.50. 

I went for the Sausage and Peppers for $14.95. Yes you read it right. That's quite expensive for a personal pizza with six slices, but this is Vegas mind you. 

The pizza was ok, it lacked sauce in my opinion. While the dough was nice and chewy I was expecting a nicer crunch on the bottom of the pizza that just wasn't there. I was let down to say the least. 

I also went with their Baby Kale salad for some greens in my diet. The salad was tossed in balsamic vinaigrette and topped with pine nuts, dried figs, and goat cheese. All this for $8 for the small size which was actually pretty big. 

I enjoyed the salad far more than the pizza honestly. However there were a few not so pleasing looking pieces of leafy greens that should have been picked out. 

800 degrees is a good spot if you must grab a quick bite and don't want to deal with a wait. But their are better options in terms of food quality and taste.",OiOR2NtTkfe-SPxsxSa85g,1,0,3,1kD0lRbkd1NIgAQCT0q77w

Then the chick who took care of the second part of the station came back with the crust with the biggest attitude ever. I said I wanted onions and pointed to the caramelized ones and she threw raw onions on top. I corrected her and she started flicking the raw onions off and tossing them into the area where all the toppings were. The raw onions were landing in other toppings. God forbid someone has an allergy to onions. Moving on we get to the third section and the guy starts counting each toppings up. I was literally in shock and was like what the f***!

I chose the pesto pizza and added spinach an mushrooms on top.  I only chose two toppings mainly because they toppings are so expensive -- at most similar eateries, they don't charge for each individual topping.  Here, it's $1.50 for each topping, which is excessive.  Yes, it's vegas, but $1.50 for a handful of spinach is close to highway robbery.

Then you had to wait in line and choose a make your own pizza or speciality Pizza. I chose the Zucca with squash, rosemary, onion and bacon.
Everything was made well and it had fresh ingredients but this pizza really didn't have much flavor it was salty, greasy and tasted like rosemary.

So he made sure to patiently say exactly how he wanted his pizza and she was nice about accommodating. She just finished putting together his pizza when another employee took his pizza and said that he needed to give that pizza to another customer because theirs got ruined in the oven. My boyfriend specifically said no because she spent a long time making that pizza the way he wanted. They didn't care and still gave it to the other customer. We were very annoyed to say the least. After finally getting our pizza I lifted one piece and everything fell off, it wouldn't even stay up. I took a bite and it literally tasted like dough. It was slimy and not cooked all the way. I was extremely disappointed, but then it got worse. I noticed a large black hair cooked in my pizza! I almost vomited it was disgusting.

I convinced my brother that this was the place we needed to go for our final meal. I didn't have high expectations because the restaurant was less than 24 hours old but everything about the place was professional. 

The staff was amazing, friendly had no errors or fumbles with orders so that's a huge plus. I didn't see a single person there that didn't smile or have a friendly demeanor. 

Now for the pizza, there are so many options but we went with spinach, feta and chicken over their pesto. We were completely blown away. This is real pizza, not some Pizza Hut deal, the cheese is in chunks and they cooked it over in a fire stone oven, as it should be. My brother wasn't sure if he would like the pizza but when he finished his first slice he exclaimed ""this is the best pizza I have ever had"" and went in for more. We had originally planned to take the pizza with us to the airport but it didn't make it past five minutes. 

I had never been to an 800° pizzeria before but as a college student who has had many pies before I can say without a doubt that this is the best pizza I have ever had and I will be coming back for more, at this place or one of their other three locations.

After having my first slice of pizza I could tell that it was under seasoned and I did not taste any salt on top of the pizza. The Caesar salad came with big pieces of uncut lettuce and stale croutons. I did not like the Caesar dressing either because the anchovy flavor was too bold.

If you're ordering salad, ask for the dressing on the side, or ask for light on the dressing. I would love to try their broccolini as a side dish. I had it as a topping and really liked it.

This a make your own pizza place. You can start out with certain pizzas - no sauce, red sauce, red sauce no cheese, or pesto. The basic pies are between $7-8, which is not bad... but when toppings are $1.50 each and special toppings $3 each, it can add up really fast! I ordered a red sauce pizza with 2 toppings and my pizza was already $11 for an individual pie.  You can also order their specialty pies that come with predetermined toppings for average of $14.  ... I tried many other pizza places that are WAY cheaper! For example, places like Pieology and Project Pie are much cheaper with just one price and unlimited toppings. I have not tried Project Pie (there is one inside MGM for $12 a pizza), but I love Pielogy as it's only $8 for a pizza with unlimited toppings. Frankly, I think Pielogy tastes better for much less. 

I'm guessing the prices are higher because 800 Degrees is a ""higher"" end pizza place... but the pizza was not all that tasty to me. The dough was good, but it was soggy in the middle of the pizza! I think pizza crust should be crispy! 

The location in Los Angeles has cheaper prices than this location in Vegas. I don't mind paying $11 for a pizza, but I do want it to taste good. Now that I've tried it, I don't have to wonder anymore as it is not good enough to make me want to come back. Next time I'll try the Project Pie inside MGM.

The Angry Bee is my go to here, and if you love sweet and savory like I do, definitely give it a try! Anytime I'm down on the strip this is what I want to eat. 

This is the perfect place for entertaining guests on the strip because of the perfect location right on Las Vegas Blvd., the quick service (this one is usually busier than the one at SLS, though) and the absolutely delicious pizza. This one gets a bump over the one at SLS because the food was slightly better, and this location serves Coke unlike the one at SLS which serves Pepsi... I know, not a huge deal but I like Coke better. 

So if you don't mind wading through the drunk 20-somethings on the strip to have the best pizza in all of Vegas, then definitely visit 800 degrees.",_WwL7lYbcNJR854iYO3AAw,1,1,5,6qaR3MXC0UpXWnJykk6Mig

I LOVE the 800 Degrees in LA, so I was super excited to find this restaurant on the strip!

All the pizza options are awesome....I especially loved the verde one, cause I'm a sucker for green sauce. 

The toppings are yummy and fresh.....love the capers and kalamata olives. If you like spicy pizza, DEFINITELY get the chili sauce topping! It's to die for!  I even bought a bottle of the chili sauce on my 3rd visit here.

This location is really nice, with high ceilings and clean decor, but the most beautiful feature of the restaurant is all of the pizza toppings! A twenty-foot-long buffet of them, I think...perfect cubes of butternut squash, fresh mozzarella, bunches of thyme, sweet roasted garlic, slices of eggplant, a variety of different hot peppers, caramelized onions, artichoke hearts, rosemary oil, on and on. 

You can choose from the list of pre-designed pizzas on the wall, or customize your own. Plus, there non-pizza options as well--salads, and burrata with your choice of accompaniments (beets and balsamic, prosciutto and melon, etc.), meatballs, broccolini.

The pizzas are perfect, though, with crisp edges and soft middles. If you like spicy, request some of their chili pepper nonsense on the side. Spicy and incredibly flavorful, almost a buffalo sauce type of thing going on. Perfect for dipping bites of crust. I love the Tartufo, with truffle cheese, mushrooms, roasted garlic, and arugula.

I came in here a few nights ago and ordered a margarita pizza on gluten free dough. The dough was brought in from the back and the employee kindly removed his gloves, wiped down his outfit and arms and put new gloves on. It really makes my day that he took that extra step to avoid cross contamination. As I went down the line I added mushrooms, pine nuts and rosemary. Since they charge you a flat rate based on your sauce plus $1.50 this stopped me from going crazy on the toppings. I also ordered a Zuppa pizza which comes with rosemary olive oil, mozzarella, butternut squash, caramelized onions and bacon (we ordered it without the bacon) and opted to add pine nuts as well to add back in the saltiness. As I get to the cashier I was greeted by Rashonda (sp?) who had the most amazing energy to her, I wish I could describe it but her energy told me that she loves her job and genuinely was happy to be at work (hard to find). Thomas was also a hoot as he was energetic and friendly as I stood there waiting as he spun my pizza in the oven making sure it was perfectly cooked. Overall I would rate this as a five star experience. The only drawback is the fact they charge $1.50 per topping when not much is given. I understand charging that for meat, but it's kinda a bummer when you pay for half a handful of pine nuts or squash. 

I look forward to coming back in again soon to try more delicious combinations or even talk them into letting me make a gluten free Nutella pizza since they have the Nutella calzone!",9SiaKMfoX7hsWxqNd-CKaw,1,0,5,J5bs7WBIo9v6tnQWwnQDxA

This pizza was awful. I had the pepperoni and my Bf had something else, don't remember the name of it (one of their specialty pizzas). This pizza was not good at all. It pretty much feel apart as you were eating it. In my opinion, the sauce and cheese, mainly the sauce determines the taste of the pizza. This was so bland, tasted like they had sauce and tried stretching the sauce with lots of water. I was all excited as they made the pizza in front of you, but I would rather have gone to the store and bought frozen pizza. FYI, the staff were really nice and were very helpful.

So back to my diet, you know when you are on a diet and you chose to cheat, and eat something good. I honestly wasted my calories space on this. It was late so we got through as much as we could to get to a satisfying state (not taste specific) and left the rest. We were so traumatized, I did not want to eat anything else on the Strip.

The Monte Carlo did a nice job of renovating their facade with some of these new restaurants. The pizza here is relatively the same as the one in LA.

So I convinced her to come along with me and give it a try. They have the same concept, which is basically a Chipotle for pizza. You pick your crust (crispy, Neapolitan, or gluten-free), your base (margherita, bianca, marinara, or verde), and then add your toppings!

Food-wise, we both got what we expected. I ordered a gluten-free crust Bianca with roasted tomatoes, pineapples, and chicken while she got an original Neapolitan crust with margherita meatball and corn. Quality of our toppings was great! I love love loved the roasted tomatoes while she loved the roasted corn. Our crust turned out just right, we were slightly worried that it would be covered in charcoal as experienced at other places but we were pleased to see it baked to perfection.

What surprised me about my visit was the service. I understand that people don't typically order the gluten-free crust but I guess I should apologize to the servers for the inconvenience I brought upon them by asking for it. The first server I was talking to asked if it was just a preference or if it was for an allergic reason. Would there have been a difference if I was allergic rather than it just being my preferred type of crust? Would they have acted more urgently? But that did not leave a negative impression on me until what had happened after. I stood off to the side of the line since I was waiting for my crust as the server was fetching it from the back kitchen for a couple seconds. However, I was approached by another server who told me that since I did not have my pizza, I should stand farther away because I'm blocking the other customers (that had no problem moving right along the line). I had already stood off to the side and here he was asking me to stand behind the line where I basically lost my place. The original server came back and tried looking for me and obviously could not find me since I was directed by the second server to wait basically out of the line. After all the confusion, I found my way back to the first server and who assisted me with my pizza. Why did it have to be so complicated?!

It is essentially a Pizza Fast-Food joint, but with quality fresh ingredients (sort of like MOD Pizza). The pizza's are cooked in a traditional wood fired pizza oven. 

The prices were typical for the strip. My girlfriend and I picked up a couple of pies to-go and brought them back to our Spa Suite at the Monte Carlo. 

Here is my reason for 4 Stars instead of 5 Stars (obviously I still thought the food was good). We ordered our pizzas, which is the part that takes the longest, especially if you have a family ordering all custom pizzas instead of picking pre-configured pizzas from the menu. They cook them in order or preparation. So my girlfriend's pizza was done and then my pizza was burnt or something. I saw them chuck it into the trash.

I saw that they make their own dough and uses the freshest ingredients. Price for Vegas is about right but I wish it was a little cheaper! How it works is an assembly line from what kind of sauce on your pizza to pick your topping's. They do have select specialty pizzas. 

I chose their specialty 'Tartufd' pizza which was a white sauce base with lots of garlic, mushrooms and truffled cheese with arugula leaves as garnish. We also added pepperoni. The pepperoni made the pizza a little greasy though. All pizzas are the same size and can fit 2-3 people depending on your appetite. The thin crust was very good and really cooks in 90 seconds! Unbelievable? it came out quick! They do have special salads. We had their 'Gorgonzola' salad which had dried cranberries, Gorgonzola cheese, candied walnuts on butter lettuce with a light dressing. That was very good! Beer was good and served cold. 

I like that they sell beer here and open late! Beer and pizza are the best combos! Restaurant is spacious with modern decor; good for big groups, too.

Upon entering you see few options.  But it's a trick.  At the very bottom they say each topping above what they list as a basic option is an extra $1.50.

Not seeing this I added toppings as I like just like at Blaze or Pieology.  But those places don't charge extra for each topping.  You can load as much as you want of each for free.  The same pizza at Blaze or Pieology is about $8 before tax but with more toppings. 

Anyone who knows me knows I'll pay ANY price for food.  I don't bat an eye at $200 pp dinner bills.  But i expect value for anything I pay.  This personal sized pizza came out to be $21.45.  And while the price is daunting I wouldn't mind it if it tasted great.  

Needless to say it didn't.   It came out very oily and sour.   Like spoiled.  And yes it did result in severe stomach pain and several rounds of discomfort in the bathroom.   I will not detail further. 

Now I did ask how it came to be so much while I was in line and before I paid.  They pointed out the fine print at the very bottom of one of their massive signs AFTER the pizza was made. And I'm not the kind of douchebag to complain and have a new pizza made because I didn't know how something worked.

But it's just not clear how it works and is incredibly deceptive, especially with the proliferation of Chipotle style pizza places everywhere else.

Yes Vegas Strip eateries are expensive.  This I am well versed in frequenting places like Delmonico Cut STK Mastros Ocean Club Picasso Aureole Kabuto Raku Carnevino Gordon Ramsay etc.  But at least their menus are clear and the food isn't rancid, especially for a quick bite place like 800 degrees.

Don't go.  You've been warned.  Get a cheap bite at the cafe or somewhere else if you have to.  Anywhere else for the sake of your own intestines.",mkJSCIBWuga8845-Zu4y3w,0,0,1,2UBOVxbJRTitf_fuVu4fhQ

This place was perfect because it was a nice big patio right in front of the Monte Carlo to sit and watch while also enjoying your meal.

Food wise it's pretty good too. It's got that make your own pizza feel very similar to pieology. We went with the Bianca base on traditional crust with mushrooms, garlic, sausage, and half roasted tomatoes. One pizza was definitely enough for us to share. We also had the prosciutto and mozzarella starter. The pizza turned out very well and was perfectly crisp. I recommended adding their fresh red peppers on pretty much anything. My favorite through was the starter. All the ingredients were super fresh and delicious. I just wish they had some vinegar and oil to top it off with. 

The only downside to this place is that it gets super busy and the line can get pretty long to order. It also was a little confusing since they hand you a separate receipt just for your pizza that you then take to the middle register to check out, kinda weird but guess that's their process.

Fountain soft drinks cost a few buckeroos, but it is all you can drink.  An integrated beverage machine features a myriad of mix-and-match brands and flavours.  I always love the option of putting a touch of vanilla or peach or strawberry etc. in cola and ginger ale.

So let's start with the positives:

It has a great location facing the Las Vegas Strip. It has indoor and outdoor seating. The interior is well decorated. And I feel that the pricing is very reasonable, when you consider the other eating options on The Strip. Also note that one of the features of this chain is that you can ""customize"" you own pizza.

But with regards to the food.... Personally I can only give ""an average"" rating based on my one meal.  I ordered the sausage with caramelized onions, and did not ask for any special customization. I wanted to see what their interpretation was. The pizza was beautiful to look at. But I prefer a dryer, crispier crust. The rim of my pizza's crust was crispy--but the bottom (flat area) of the crust was ""wet"". 

Maybe this is what a traditional Neapolitan pizza is supposed to be like, and I am used to ""American style"" pizza (?). The European tourist seemed to enjoy their meals.",psU9IaROPzivxgO2jDcmJg,0,0,2,YT_1DxJZtkDdEMDHxs1NiA

The idea of $11 QSR pizza from a wood fired oven is fabulous. In practice, it makes for a mouth watering, shareable, thin crust pie from heaven!

My secret off-menu pie is a ""Bianca add Marinara and Basil"" which ends up tasting like a cross between a Garlic-herb-EVOO and a Margherita.  My eight year old swears by the crushed meatballs on her Margherita.

We decided on 800 degrees on a whim, we were heading to a hockey game (go Knights) and thus couldn't spend too much time on food beforehand, and the place we were originally planning on going to was closed. The smell of fresh pizza led us to 800 degrees and I'm very glad it did.

You enter the restaurant and begin your pizza journey by choosing a signature pizza or a base to create your own. They roll out the dough for your pizza and add sauce (if any) and fresh mozzarella then add toppings. There was about 15-20 choices for toppings, so there is definitely something to please everyone. After your pizza is put together it gets put in line to go into the oven and you pay for the pizza and you can add on an appetizer, salad, or dessert at the register. Once your pizza is in the oven it only takes about 1 to 1 1/2 minutes to be cooked to perfection. Our pizza was done before we were finished paying for it. 

We added on an anti pasti plate, which was a good choice, and something I'd recommend if you enjoy salami and cheese. 

Our pizza only cost about $13 and for the two of us to eat here it was about $30 which is pretty reasonable for the strip and makes this a place I'm going to come back to.",ny5uD7wcIZ01hUXE50Qz2Q,0,0,5,hP64XywHMgmmKtJy0NPNIg

My sister is obsessed with this place so when we came to Vegas last year and found out there was an 800 degrees that recently opened, we had to go! And during our most recent trip, it was definitely a stop we had to make yet again. 

There are a couple of bases to choose from for your pizza but I went with the margherita. Each topping is priced at a little over a dollar so keep that in mind when you're choosing what to pile on top of your pizza. Their toppings bar is extensive, and there's just so much quality items you can pick from. Plenty of veggies, cheeses, and meats along with many more for your liking. Just make sure your pizza won't be too heavy when choosing your toppings or else you'll be eating your pizza with a fork and knife, which is usually the way to go at these types of pizza establishments. I tend to go overboard with what I put on my pizzas. 

The pizzas are wood fired which gives it the perfect smokey flavor and slight crunch to the toppings. The crust stays fluffy, and your entire pizza creation just comes together so nicely in the end.

When I picked up the pizzas one was not cooked longer nor was it ""cracker thin"" and it no longer had any basil.  When I told the clerk she asked the cooks if they had an extra cheese and extra basil pizza and right in front of me they were flippant, curt and unknowing.

Since it was a Sunday, most of the restaurants and kitchens closed at 11pm and our only option was 800 Degrees. The employees are extremely friendly and patient with nine of us telling them what we wanted on our pizzas, which was great. If you've ever been to Pieology or Blaze, the concept of 800 Degrees is pretty much the same with the freedom of picking any and every topping. If you don't want to customize your pizza, you can opt for one of their specialty pizzas!

My family and I ordered a chicken and pesto pizza, a pepperoni pizza, and one of their specialty pizzas, which was sausage and peppers. Immediately I noticed that they don't have grated mozzarella and simply just distribute a ball of mozzarella on their pizza. Other than the cheese, they're not skimpy on the toppings! Our pizzas arrived less than 5 minutes after I placed the orders and each of us had 2-3 small slices. Honestly, for the price ($9-$15 a pizza) I would have rather saved the credit and use it the next day at a different establishment. The pizzas, except for the chicken and pesto, were bland and the crust was extremely thin. I also want to mention that there was some sort of bubble on the pizza on the specialty pizza and the employee remade it and checked on us to see if we were satisfied with our food. Great service!

The pizza here is just terrible! My friends and I were shocked at just how bad it is. We stayed at the Monte Carlo Hotel, currently under renovation, and this was the only place that was opened after 11 PM. We thought... Pizza?... It has to be easy. The line was impressively long, likely because this is the only restaurant open after 11 PM at this hotel. It is slow service so we waited in line quite a bit, which is likely why the line is so long. I ordered a margarita pizza and I also ordered a Filetti pizza ( pesto, tomatoes, and basil). There was an option to upgrade to a better quality mozzarella and we chose to do that. It was an up charge of six dollars per pizza.
The pizzas might as well have been 'dunked' in water. They were too watery with a watery and soft crust that was just disgusting. The cheese came right off the crust so you practically almost ate it separate from the crust/bread. The margarita pizza was OK except for the fact that it was too watery and soft. The other pizza was just disgusting, laden with garlic that was overkill in those tomatoes, but that is nowhere explained in the menu. 
So why one star only? Simple... Because of the exorbitant price for such poor quality. The total for these two pizzas that were small size pizzas with two diet Pepsi's was almost $50! Just no!

Those should pretty much wrap together the experience here.  I think everyone should try a couple of these fast-fire pizzas places at some point.  It's a very fast-food-esque way to enjoy an amazing class of food.

My thoughts on this place... For starters, it's pricey! Each add-on ingredient is pretty expensive, which really limits the kind of pizza I would have liked to build.  The pizza is pretty much meant to be enjoyed right away.  It is a thin-crust pizza with not a lot of weight to it, so it doesn't stay hot for long and will get soggy quickly if you don't eat it.  One of the downsides to a 800-deg oven is that some (not a lot) of the crust will get burned.  I really don't care much for eating blackened crust pieces, and I'm too lazy to pick them all off.  

Very cool to try once.  Now that I've been to this chain here and in LA a couple times... I'm over it.  I've had better fast-fire pizzas places that also maintain very high quality ingredients for a better overall pizza at a lower overall price.",raIRUt4xr9XrUExiTKmTGQ,1,0,3,AJD_e4z3ZHoapMSKOzixfQ

5895137,2015-12-11,0,glkEaoxbewiSMBiXs945JA,"800 Degrees has a very special place in my heart because I frequented its other location in LA so often (probably 4-5 times a month I wish I was kidding) being that it was in my alma mater's neighborhood (UCLA/Westwood - GO BRUINS). This is comfort food. It brings back college nostalgia. Also it's really high quality pizza. It's almost like a fast food joint, but it's too fancy to be one? 

800 Degrees is not like the other make-your-own customizable pizza places like Blaze or Mod or Pieology, because I think the toppings and bases are a lot more gourmet. I don't think this place is comparable because the quality is higher!

I always get the margherita base, so I did the same for this location. On top, I added butternut squash, mushrooms (there are literally 5 types of mushrooms in their blend like are you kidding me), pine nuts, soppressata, broccolini, corn, and arugula. Yes - my pizza is aggressive, but it's so good. After you customize your pizza, it is wood fired for a short time and your food is ready. 

**Note: You can have your pizza cooked a little longer to make it crispy because the toppings tend to slide off pretty easily since the pie is very thin. I always eat my pizza with a fork and knife to get all the toppings in one bite. 

Other bases are marinara, verde (pine nut pesto), and bianca (white with no sauce). There are a ton of meats to put on top of your pizza, and the cheese selection is also great - I have added fontina on top of my pizza before. 

Also, I can eat an entire pizza by myself in one sitting, but I am pretty stuffed by the end and thinking of names for my food baby, so be warned that you will be very full.

The only reason I'm giving this location 4 stars instead of 5 like the LA locations is because Vegas is a little more expensive. Makes sense given the tourist location, but still sad.",8YUo5Jx-ZCB_hHuGTmo35g,4,1,4,OgRTZ-5JWd5b1fwy6Hw07g

Maybe I just don't know my high society toppings but it would have been nice to know what everything was.

So after picking out everything our pizza's go down the assembly line and into the ""800 degree"" oven (gasp).  From there they bring out the pizza and cut it and call out people's number to come pick it up.  What a let down this pizza was.  Some parts of my cheese didn't get melted all the way.  Crust was soggy.  Everything was blah.  Considering that this was basically a $17 pie it was a total bomb.
