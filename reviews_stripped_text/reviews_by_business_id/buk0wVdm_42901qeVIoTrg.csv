If this is what you do say so on your menu. My burger came dry no dressing, and one bite of burger and done. Meat does not taste good, fries ate old and cold. I'm not a picky eater but none of this is good. $27 later and I'm hungry.",QFDskC0bde9HACqGndCZGQ,0,0,1,ZhEcMqv84adJ4bwQQXYUxg

They have traditional bar fair with some nice additions, like a blackened chicken quesadilla and a hot pastrami wrap.
We've tried the fingers,  fries, onion wings, a couple of the wraps, and the patty melt. It's all been good food for a decent price with really good service.",F_-1IBg81xMObSNhglSyGQ,0,0,4,Bkg26NRC9ITcw8gEQIpCHg
5734161,2016-07-07,0,buk0wVdm_42901qeVIoTrg,The pics looked great ordered dinner for my family at 4th of july that they were completely unprepared for. Over an hr for a couple sandwiches and chicken tenders. The WORST french dip ever. It looked like leather that had been left in the Las Vegas desert. All fries were still frozen. The 2 chicken tenders had been so left out and dry no one would touch them so my kids and i ate my leather sandwich. (We were starving) But was worse we all got food poisoning from it. Never again! Be safe don't do as I did and eat from them.,dcerf0rmXXEDKflx9G9IaQ,0,0,1,dFzaEHzoopgDkYtqGXT2vA
