The food was slightly more salty for my tastes (kung-pao chicken). I'm a large fan of pizza but each different piece was lacking in terms of taste. I did enjoy some dishes I never seen at any other Station casino (egg foo young, pork chops with saurkraut). They even had little M&M cookies which reminded me of childhood. Service and decorum was great. For a place that's out of the way I'm more of a fan for the Texas Station.",EDbiVMbjPHaNYSBYM0Y0Ig,0,0,3,8Zjb6pQaxU1YqXSgK7jaMA

The bad: rude service from start to finish, hosts are super rude act like you should tip them, then when they seat you they act irritable.  Manager Mary Anne is by far the most unprofessional manager I've ever came across.  

The ugly: Yesterday night saw a chef preparing fajitas while chomping down on some food.  Absolutely disgusting and unsanitary.  Not to mention health department violation.

This is the first time I have been for breakfast. It was on Sunday for their Sunday Brunch. I have to say that I was very impressed with the brunch. Lunches and dinners have been very lacking, but this Brunch was very good. The bacon was cooked just right. It had a wonderful flavor and it and was cooked as to be not to crunchy or limp. I had a slice of ham that was so succulent and tender. I also tried three different types of potatoes. I had some mashed, au gratin, and hash browns. Each was done quite nicely and had a good flavor to them. Most of the time when I have fruit at the Feast Buffet it is not flavorful at all. This time both the watermelon and honeydew were very juicy and flavorful. I grabbed a bit of cherry cobbler and was impressed. The cherries were not to tart or sweet. The cobbler had a nice texture and flavor to it. It wasn't the best I have ever had, but I did enjoy it.

We were seated pretty quickly. We arrived before the big rush and did not have to wait to long. Our server got to us soon after sitting down.

Food: Turkey was quite good, tender and juicy. Roast beef a bit dry.

Carb dishes were fair, scalloped potatoes, mac and cheese, etc. They do have a chef made pasta bar available as well. Salad bar had a decent selection. Biggest complaint was that all the veggies were cooked beyond well done. Dessert bar was average. Ice cream machine could not keep up with demand, it was too soft for cones.

Also, there are signs stating that children have to be attended at all food stations. They were not. Hubby waited 10 minutes to get some ""ice cream"", due to there being two little girls taking there time dressing their ice cream. Making a huge mess by the way.

Highlights sadly do not include the sushi, which I usually run to first, as it wasn't refreshed very often and didn't seem to have much variety- there were probably three rolls out the entire time we were here, and we took our time. Oh well- plenty of sushi places in vegas for me to overlook this minor detail.

The highlights DO include some large and meaty meatballs, large calzone slices, some thai chicken dish that seemed to be an experiment but tasted amazing, barbecue, and about a million salads.

But none of that compares to the shrimp and cheddar grits. I would go back JUST for these grits. As it is, I probably had three servings, which is now reflected in my ongoing battle with the scale. But they were damn amazing.

Been a long time since I have had clam chowder that taste right.   It was delicious and had a lot of clams.  Next was the salad which I was able to enjoy for once since I  didn't have to worry about getting my money's worth.   The vegetables were very fresh and I liked the way they cut the carrots in  small pieces   the blue cheese dressing tasted nothing like it should. The carrot salad was a bit off.  Time for main course and I was impressed with the selection.   Asian,  Mexican, American, Italian, wow.   The calzone was almost on the mark but missed it by omitting the Italian Meats and substituting with chicken,  blah.  The creamy spinach was very good.   Thumbs up for having Brussel sprouts but they didn't taste right .  Tasted a bite of my husband's rib and the meat was a bit old tasting.  The dessers were standard fare.  why 4 stars?  My son loved it.   The variety was super.   The service excellent. But the price cinched it.  $35.00 for 3 people for a dinner buffet that did have some excellent choices nowadays is amazing.

2291035,2018-02-24,2,djAWtGq2IxKaxMIMw-P58A,"Not impressed...

I don't know how to say this any other way but if you are a white male, you should probably avoid this place. On two different occasions, one in the players club line and one in the buffet line. Today was a pull tab day so I went to the players club to open mine and to inquire about the buffet my host mentioned I would have. I tried calling Bryan yesterday to inquire about it but he never returned my call. The line at the players club was long and I could see there were several people in the Presidents or chairman line that weren't supposed to be there. But, it was really obvious when a white kid got to the front and wouldn't leave. I'm pretty sure he knew it wasn't but the lady was trying to tell him to go to the other line but he ignored. It got a little tense but eventually he left. Ok, so over to the buffet. Two gold cards in front of me in the President and Chairman only line just like the white kid in the players club. This time, they were Hispanic, though. Not only did the girl tell them to go to the other line like they did to the white guy but she actually helped them AS IF they were the highest limit people. Even to the point of interrupting my convo with her to answer their question. I think she could sense that I was a little annoyed so she tells me to go to a separate line after paying, to be seated. She said that it was the president line. So, I'm standing there and the seating host sits 4 groups before me. 4! I have always asked what is the point of being loyal and being higher card status and every time, the employees first response is...'you get to be in the front of the line'...ummm, well, apparently not. I physically pulled out my card and when the seating host saw it, her eyes nearly popped out of her head and she ran to me. So, here's the thing. Yeah, the Hispanic couple in front of me was two people so I was like...whatever they cut in a line in front of me just like the white kid did at the players club and the couple got special attention when the kid didn't but if she is going to try to fix the ""hookup"" she gave to the couple, MAKE SURE YOU FOLLOW THROUGH. The seating host clearly didn't know about separate lines or else she would've at least asked (I think). The cashier should have motioned to the seating host to make note. But, the seating host should have paid attention also. Just a horrible start. I'm not really big on pushing my player card status around on people but I almost feel like I need to. Because, otherwise, why am I being loyal to stations? I get the same crap server service either way. In fact, I think I even get worse because I don't tip 5 bucks like I used to anymore, per drink. I give a buck and 2 if I'm winning. I would give 5 and still get bad service so I stopped that. Tired of being disappointed. I will still give 5 to servers that have been consistently good, They know who they are. Anyways...so, I finally sit down. Took a good minute before the server got my order for my drink. I usually wait until I give the order to start eating. Finally, she comes. Off to the food. I hate to say but not one single thing looked good. Not one. And I had to search for a plate. There were no plates. Very small selection of food items. Very basic things. But, honestly, nothing looked good at all. Everything looked old, dark, drab and unappealing. The Asian section looked like complete garbage. Like it was leftover from some other restaurant that they just dumped in the steam table. Ugh. Even the Tex Mex looked pretty bad. I really have no words. For the price, it was not worth it. Yes, mine was comped but I would never pay for that. Especially if I'm a higher tier card. They don't seem to even recognize it. It's a ""who you know or what race you are"" vip. They completely ignore the card tier levels here. And, after returning from my second run, I was almost run over by my own server. Apparently, I'm less than anyone and I just always get this feeling that it's because I'm white especially after witnessing what I saw within the same hour that I mentioned in this earlier in the review.

I would not recommend this to anyone. Now that I'm staying on the west side, I do not see myself coming back.

P.S. Don't get me wrong, I didn't like the white kid in the wrong line just like I didn't like the Hispanic couple in the wrong line either. But, the players club ""chose"" to handle it the right way when the buffet ""chose"" to ignore and let it slip. Coincidence? Maybe, but, then it also happened to me and only when I revealed my card (even though I was supposed to be in the ""Presidents"" line, ) did it change. Coincidence? 3 out of 3? I don't think so. I think the staff is conditioned that way. Am I asking for them to change? No. I just know that white males are not really accepted here and I think anyone reading this review should know that.",FgyvflZtqRF03j5bIrlnlA,3,0,1,r00zYBhHqAFzu3YWmoqNwA

2746900,2015-07-23,1,djAWtGq2IxKaxMIMw-P58A,"For a lower tier hotel, Feast Buffet is pretty strong overall.  

I've only had the breakfast and was pretty impressed with the overall selection.  In addition to a fresh cut turkey, ham, endless bacon, and a strong omelet bar (made to serve) they have some regional fare as well, such as Mexican and Tex-Mex offerings.  Throw in some Italian pastas, and Asian cuisine as well.

Many of the items are fresh and surprisingly pleasant for a $6.49 breakfast such as the smoked salmon and cheese blintzes, however, a few items could use a bit more care.  The pizza dough seemed of the generic variety, and a few seemingly frozen bulk varietals like the popcorn shrimp dot the landscape.  It's also weird (at least to me) to see generic chocolate pudding and lime Jell-O offerings for a breakfast bar.  But again, there was some great Mexican machaca, tex-mex potatoes, and southern style cheesy hominy.  Also, don't pass up the eggs benedict, very nicely done.

On Sunday's they have bottomless mimosas for adults, which was cheap champagne and generic orange juice, but again, you're paying only $6.49.

Actually, if you get a casino rewards player's card, you can even bring the price down further, I think it was $5.99.  Not bad.

Staff was very friendly and accommodating to our large party, including access for wheelchairs and were prompt at cleaning up our used plates and coming around checking how we were.

The one drawback was the check-in process.  It did seem abnormally confusing at first for them to coordinate our large party (12) and check all our cards and get our headcount
...multiple times...before they were confident to seat us.  But once seated it ran pretty smoothly.

My 4 stars is based on speed, quantity and value more than overall 'quality', but it's a buffet in old Vegas, and for a buffet, there were more stars than duds in the offerings presented.",trRStPEwvlDzTtbfuqBveA,2,0,4,DN_wprHJWrvn29WQctI3ng

The food is bland and I don't know why this place is packed so often.  I went again today, knowing better, but I haven't been here in a year and I'm having trouble believing that something is seriously wrong with their food, but there is -- not just the bland taste and the poor, very limited selection.

Every time I eat at a buffet at any Station Casino, I get nearly instant diarrhea.   I mean, my stomach starts rumbling just minutes after I eat.  If I get a second plate, I'm never able to finish because I'm already on my way to the toilet.  Ka-whoosh...  instant, liquid diarrhea every single time.  This happens at any Station Casino buffet at also at Sam's Town Firelight buffet (although it doesn't hit me nearly as quick at Sam's Town).  This does NOT happen anywhere else... no other restaurant, no other buffet, not even with Fast Food.  I could eat McDonald's and Wendy's every single day and not have any stomach problems... but as soon as I eat the food from Station Casinos, I'm rumbling and running to the toilet.   As I said, I tried staying away for nearly a year... not a single problem anywhere else.  I go back once and it happens again.   I've tried eating a totally different selection of foods and that doesn't seem to make a difference.

What are they doing to the food?  What are they adding to cause this disgusting problem?   And I feel horrible for the next few hours, going to the toilet sometimes five or six times...  with the same type of stuff coming out of me.",-vTIOBkGfZ6JdP0RROs6Fw,0,0,1,yWEGGVih5Dx5CpKjbOs5cg

I don't live on the Hender-tucky side of town so rarely do we ever go to the Green Valley Ranch for a visit.  But with getting that Station Casinos coupon buy one buffet get one FREE just about every month (a wonder what $20 a month gambling with their members card can do) we finally gave in and took the trek down there.  I know, I know the coupon is good for the Red Rock Casino too but with over 25 check ins there (yep and I'm still only 5th place for a regular) I thought it was time to change it up a bit.  Glad we took the journey!

We went on the most expensive nights, Saturday for dinner.  Since it includes prime rib & shrimp for the buffet on this night the price goes up to $17 a person + tax & tip.  But with our BOGO coupon 1 is FREE!  Oh yeah!  That is a deal to me!  Don't care if people say buffets are 'whack' or 'the stuff no one wants to eat'.  Save it all for me then!  Eating on a budget is hard enough as it is, but doing it with a buffet?  Yeah, sign me up.  Let's see...$10 each after coupon for all I can eat of just about anything, or $10 each trying to pick out food to cook from my local supermarket?  I like to cook but nope, that BOGO coupon is tough to beat.  Plus, no clean up!

For us, the Feast Buffet at Green Valley Ranch didn't disappoint.  Yes, there are lines, yes, there are crowds for high ticket items (like prime rib), and yes, some of the food is downright mediocre.  But tell me where you gonna get as much meat as your fatty mcfatfat self wants, when you want it?  Don't get me wrong, quality is just as important as quantity...but that's why you only eat the things at a buffet that entices you!  Don't be wasting your calories on those rolls of bread!  Skip the cottage cheese please!  

And believe me, we ate like kings!  Prime rib, which was actually pretty good by the way!  Rare!  With au jus!  And a side of roasted mushrooms!  Pad Thai that was actually edible!  Orange Chicken that whaddaya know?  Tasted like there was real orange in there!  Roasted Brussel Sprouts!  Sauteed Broccoli Rabe!  Carne Asada Tacos!  Hell I could have got Mongolian BBQ made for myself too!  The list goes on & on.

Had a rarity in the buffet, made to order Gyros!  They honestly weren't that great (or that pretty) but it was offered!  Choices!  I like me some choices when it comes to food because half the time I don't know what I want to eat.  Buffets fill that perfect medium.

This Feast Buffet even offers shakes & malts!  Really!  Not a bad way to end the evening after your feast.

A: Only a fraction of the great city it is.

Q: What would I be without Las Vegas buffets?
A: About 30 pounds less.

I like the feast buffets at all the Station Casinos but the one at Boulder Station holds a special place in my heart.  This buffet used to be in regular rotation for me when I still lived on the Eastside.  I was going there long before they updated to the Feast it is today.  An update I am happy about.  Before it changed, the former buffet was good but not great.  I usually got sick within an hour of eating there.  Not that it ever stopped me.  It sort of reminded me of that buffet in the great comedy classic ""Vegas Vacation."" Sometimes the food was not identifiable.  

Now, however, the Feast at Boulder Station is top notch.  The salad bar is always fresh.  The Mexican section has some good food.  The Chinese section has great orange chicken and egg rolls.  The place is now modern and more classy than before.  It is clean.  The service is good.  Drinks are always filled as if by magic.  I leave for a new plate of food and when I return, my drink is filled and my empty plate is gone.  Who could ask for more?",eOIMO2wT_WbNqmavhnCRxw,2,0,4,7LQ3pPcNsDC0kzdABPJIlQ

Everyone working was very in sync and efficient when it came to service, moving people in and out, it was quite pleasant to see such professionalism.

Bacon - YES! It was decent, you can't beat all you can eat bacon.

Fruits and Veggies - They seem to be always fresh, so good job non-obese people! (Yeah, stereotypes....weee)

The prices are on the cheap. CHEAP. You can get breakfast for $5.99. Okay, that's a whole buffet for the price of a combo meal at a lot of places. 

I think it's a decent buffet. Usually they have a very large selection of Mexican foods, even menudo soup sometimes. The ""ethnic"" (see: Chinese) section usually boasts your typical fair and of course there is pizza and pasta. Meat station usually has turkey and roast beef, although on occasion they do cornish game hens or something else meaty-tastic,

Best of all is the omelet station. They can make dang good omelets here. Although I usually always go with ham, cheese and jalapeno. However my sister had a spinach omelet and to me it looked pretty tasty!

       - Quality - Nothing was cooked, everything tasted nice, and the service was excellent.
       - Value - If you go in Mon - Sat at 3:30pm, you're essentially paying lunch price for a dinner buffet.
**Price**
       - $4.99 Breakfast 8am-11am Mon - Sat
       - $6.99 Lunch 11am-4pm Mon - Sat
       - $9.99 Dinner 4pm-9pm Sun - Thurs, 4pm-10pm Fri & Sat
       - $9.99 Brunch 8am-4pm Sun
**Available**
       - BBQ Beef Ribs - Friday and Saturday nights, they have BBQ Beef Ribs on the BBQ carving station. Decently meaty and pretty great for the price. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/djAWtGq2IxKaxMIMw-P58A?select=PF1DKVOMCtrbFMAS-E-_GQ)
       - Sea Bass - Their sea bass is moist and flaky.
       - Roast Beef - They didn't have prime rib, but it was tender on the inside.
       - Ham - Giant ham that wasn't too salty and was cooked right.
       - Everything else is just normal things you find at a buffet.
**Recommendations**
       - I'd recommend this place if you're looking for a cheap buffet. Save the ribs, nothing particularly stands out. However, given the price, you're getting a lot of bang for your buck.",37S80IUIfb8yMsSwWWDsFA,4,0,4,hS9-ap3ccDIk0zO3GT5YNQ

I have to throw the race card in here because people are always saying that certain race of children are so mannerable; HA!

The area where she put us, it seemed that there was only grown people, no kids! Why, Why did those children insist on every time they got food, they walked or ran through that area?!! I saw Latino children, white children and black children who were on their best behavior; I better not ever hear anyone say that Asian children are so well mannered! The 8 year old was throwing food. My sister asked me to not say anything to them. We told our waiter and he just shook his head and said that if they reprimand them, they get scolded! WOW!!! Okay...

Food for supper same-o, same-o, NOTHING different these first two nights. Irish lamb stew and colcannon potatoes did not appear to have had many takers... Italian pasta bar selection nothing to write home about. Not many gambling... Has there been another casino opening, something is happening to the amount of guests... Good thing: You must use your guest key to operate the elevators now... Still get that sewer gas smell from the bathroom sink (Been that way for years, also smell the phew coming from the pool area)... Guess it's time to go casino exploring...",1wfX6kF4Mt5grbi-s9Q9Tg,0,0,3,Sa6LBzTCm2hG-wIqtM7wUQ

 We had a table with a clean high chair waiting for us. That impressed me. 
Food quality is medium...not bad enough to complain but not good enough to crave.  
My dad was in town and he's a picky eater so I figured out of these 100 options he could find something to eat...and he did! 
James, our server, was great.  There was a table full of drunk old ladies hitting on him for at least an hour and he was a good sport.  You're going to heaven, James :) Old ladies need lovin', too.",VigsAph76fP7pechJ743EA,1,1,3,ilOkbSjW-PSkCdxfXTztQg

Alright, so I came here with a few friends for breakfast. The line was kind of long but it turns out one of my friends had some bonus card that reduced the line and price on groups of up to 4. That was pretty cool to pay like 6 bucks for breakfast.

French Toast- generic, solid french toast triangles. you can dress them up in cinnamon and powdered sugar later on if you want.
Waffles- tiny belgian waffles that are surprisingly very good! This was the item i was pretty impressed with and went back for many.  
Bacon- most of the time the pieces were very thin and a bit too crispy for me.
Sausage- Juicy thin pork sausage. they went well with the french toast. I love buffet sausage though.
Chicken Fried Steak- small (maybe 3 bites), but had a lot of flavor, especially with the gravy, which was being rotated consistently. A high point.
Eggs- Buffet eggs....I can't stand them at all, but they had a choice of regular scrambled eggs, or ""spanish"" style with some peppers and onions in it which actually made them tolerable to me.

There was an omelet station but the line was ludicrous. It seemed to be legit, with 4 stations and a chef assigned to 2 each with all the traditional omelet toppings like mushrooms, ham, cheeses, peppers, etc. I'm a huge fan of buffet omelets because they are real eggs cooked fresh and to order. However I passed on it this time because of my own time constraints.

Overall, for the special price I paid for this breakfast, I definitely would have given it 4 stars, but if I had to pay full price (which is how I'm judging this), it would be 3. Definitely not the worst breakfast buffet, and matches anything you could find on the Strip.",AIfBNzCdizvgib_j9vhl8A,1,0,3,9PvMErcynjcr3H_6UWjeEg

My boyfriend and I were looking to eat during our date night, and he stumbled upon this during his ""Best of Las Vegas."" Search. I must say I was shocked at first, but decided to give it a try because there has a be a reason why they are rated the best buffet in Las Vegas. From the moment I walked in, to the moment I left, I was impressed. The restaurant was clean and the decor was really nice! Also , it was not extremely loud much like a lot of buffets on the strip. The service was amazing, very tentative. The food was the best part. Fresh, hot, and the bbq was amazing. (We kept coming back for the ribs.) the only advice I would give is to make sure you have a players card, you get a discount on the Price for the Buffett. :) I recommend this place to locals if your looking to get away from the strip, and want some good grub!",32EBqjpqQq18ooW9ZYRt5g,0,0,4,Eu0jJiO_51CavGHAU7ENzw

We always go with our rewards card its only 8.99 for dinner and drinks are only 3 bucks and they always load it up with booze, from the bottle not cheap tap liquor either, it's the best! Their selection is great, their ceasar salad dressing is my favorite and their asian curry noodles and pad thai and dumplings are great! Their decor is really nice and modern too. Service is good. Love it! We are regulars! I can't think of anywhere else I would bother to go. Only thing is its smoky in the casino so your hair ends up smelling like smoke, make sure you have time to shower otherwise you are going to bed with smoky hair!",tORKMQQnMJLzCEsRXQikyg,2,0,5,KsX-Q6PXgyBv4aXYbw9EXA

So I had the roasted and fried chicken it was OK but not all that. The pizza was very salty so we're the mashed potatoes. I tried the Brussel sprouts and they lacked seasoning.  Everything I tried was mediocre and there was a limited selection for lunch. Definitely not trying this place again, you're better off eating at the grand cafe",864uMSFGP4_muuDV6hJsbQ,0,0,2,TRJ4Z1hY9aHk-qSJgqpcPw

The setting is enticingly romantic, nice and dark.
 it is great for locals and the price is right! Food is good, but I can cook better.
Service is always spectacular.
I really enjoy the cheese enchiladas, but they don't serve them often enough.
I was super super super excited over the Italian Linguini!
I just wanted more and more.
I do recommend this place and the line is long but a short wait.
That's why it is called, ""The Feast Buffet"".",F2av57ztcbYiPADtT-YpdA,0,0,4,5gyzliZKjKn0ZzAr3f2g3A
5959808,2013-09-17,3,djAWtGq2IxKaxMIMw-P58A,"I could have sworn I wrote a review for this place before. I can't say I'm a fan of this buffet, or any buffet really, but I do get dragged here from time to time and since it's not too expensive, I don't put up much of a fight. 

The food is very basic and I often can't find too much that I actually want to eat. On busier days, they don't seem to replace the food as often as they should and there are often empty pans sitting there for longer than they should. Spills all over and lots of reaching over food in the front to get to the back items. Not very hygienic in my opinion, but maybe I'm just overly sensitive to stuff like that.

Service is friendly and they do keep up with drink refills and can handle larger parties easily.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,5,4,2,v0zZSVoIf_dlyRh4lNeaFA

They recently force you to merge yourself in with the regular line (always very busy). It's very embarrassing and uncomfortable as I have to explain ti the healthy people why I am cutting in. I would go back if they revert to the special handicap line but not until then.   UPDATE- they changed and went back to the separate handicapped line.
