So thats why I kept returning even though their coffee and hot chocolate is crap and their bottled drinks are, of course, ridiculously overpriced.

It changed for the worse. The other day I came here again, ordered the mixed berry crepe (used to be called a Favorite crepe, thats another thing - they got rid of the French names for the crepes and are now naming them by their toppings). What a huge disappointment - the crepe was folded into a triangle with only a pitiful serving of berries and sauce on top. They used to stuff the crepe with berries and fold it only in half.

Upon arrival, there was already a small line forming. I figure that must be a good sign, especially for about 10:30am in Vegas which is like 7am everywhere else in the country.

I realized that the line was long partially because only one person was working. That person not only took orders and payment but also made the crepes themselves. I must have waited 15 minutes for a light breakfast snack.

I ordered the Nutella crepe and honestly was not disappointed at all. It was sweet but not too sweet. The crepe resembled almost like a dumpling in that most of the filling was towards the back and the front was mostly just the crepe layer itself. Not a terrible thing but I would have liked it more even.

There is a decent size sitting area right next to this place to enjoy the crepe.

Le Creperie offers 7 savory and 8 dessert crepes, all made in front of you. Takes about seven minutes from order to plating.
They'll pack it to-go if you want. 
Some of these are crazy rich--my husband's cinnamon bun crepe was so sweet I just couldn't take a second bite.

Four stars and not five because:  
A-the checkout staff were not very friendly; I dunno..I guess I just wanted them to be smiling and interact with us, but maybe after doing this day in and out, they get jaded..? Especially the cook wearing the huge poofy white chef's hat--he looked like a character you'd want to get a hello from. 
B-there just isn't a large selection of crepes. I thought we'd go and see double the options...or maybe just a mix and match option..? I just now saw that their website suggests you add ice cream or other add-ins/mix-ups, but these items/options are not listed anywhere around the venue.  
C-they used processed meats in some of these...my ham and cheese crepe had sliced lunch meat in it--for their prices, and for a place that calls itself ""French inspired"" I feel that actual ham should be used. 
D-they really use brand name Nutella. There was a massive jar of it behind the counter. That disappoints me. Nutella is ""just ok"" to me..it is pure sugar. Why not try something like Justin's brand of hazelnut spread? It's different because of the lower sugar content.

I chose a sweet and my wife chose savory. We were both happy with our selections. 

The biggest downside to ordering from here during breakfast hours is a lack of somewhere to sit. La Creperie is right next to another food stop (and across from a buffet) and seating can become a bit of an issue.

I arrived around 8:25am yesterday, and ordered a roasted chicken crepe for breakfast. (I REALLY wanted one of those delicious-looking dessert ones, but I had a busy day and didn't want to be in the bathroom all day later)

I think I paid around 8:40 (and there were only like 5 people ahead of me in line, too) and FINALLY got my crepe around 9am. 

That being said, the reason that it takes so long is that they make them fresh, so they are delicious. I will say I asked for no asparagus, though, and was told they couldn't do that, because they use a mix or something strange like that ... but it tasted fresh.

The roasted chicken one had chicken, asparagus, sundried tomatoes, I think onions, and a pesto sauce, and was pretty good. Price range from $9-11 or $12. 

I will say that my parents have been to Paris's ""Le Village Buffet"" before, though, and you can have made-to-order crepes there, so if you think you'll want more than just a crepe, you should check that out - they have both crepes and omelettes.

When I was told that the Paris had an amazing crepe place I practically started running toward it. But when I finally saw the restaurant I got kind of bummed. I was expecting an actual restaurant and not a walk-up stand. But after realizing that it's supposed to resemble the walk-up creperies in Paris, France I was okay with the idea.

The line didn't take too long (maybe fifteen minutes or so) but when we're all about to eat our left hands out of hunger, fifteen minutes feels like an eternity. Finally we got to the front of the line. The menu has several savory crepes with meats and cheese as well as dessert crepes with berries, whipped cream, and other sugary additions.

I pretty much only like dessert crepes so my eyes lit up when I saw their abundance of fruits and sauces. I went with the Favorite crepe (with fresh berries, whipped cream, and topped with raspberry coulis). It was served to me at the pick-up counter on a cafeteria trey and a plastic plate. Lame. I then had to turn the corner and grab a plastic knife and plastic fork. Lame. Then came the really fun part; watching over people like hawks until a table opens up. The small seating area is just next door to La Creperie but it's open to anybody that wishes to sit there (surrounding snack stands, or people just giving their bunions a break).

After a couple minutes, we snagged a table and began digging in to our lovely crepes. They were almost impossible to cut into. The plastic utensils, plastic plates, and plastic treys made the crepes slide about relentlessly. After finally wrangling the thing down and cutting it up I got to taste it. Sheesh.

Update 
7-17-15

Ok, since I came back to Vegas, I had to hit this crape joint again. I decided to try something new: 
The blueberry crape.
If the Nutella crape I tried last time was the best I ever had, this is even better. I think the fruits are organic, and the mix of warm crape, cold cream on top and the very tasty blueberry, mulberries and strawberries mixed all together will leave you impressed for sure. Try it out, it's not a common crape place that tries to impress you. I let you, the reader be the judge. If you know of something better message me ;)

They specialize in crepes of course, and have about a half-dozen savory versions and half-dozen dessert versions.  Maybe that's why they open 7am to 11pm!

We wanted something sweet after lunch to neutralize the salty aftertaste from eating at Bellagio's Noodles.  The Banana Foster Crepe was a great antidote!  Huge, thin crepe stuffed with slices of bananas and drizzled with rum and caramel sauce.  I liked the nice touches with the candied pecan topping and side of Chantilly cream.

The crepes themselves are super buttery. I could eat it with just the homemade chantilly cream and I'd be happy, but why stop there? I go for the nutella crepe without bananas. Have asked it with strawberry a few times and have gotten it with it twice; sometimes they'll say yes, most times it's a no lol. The hazelnuts are addicting. The fresh berry crepe is also a good choice. They don't lather the crepe too much with the strawberry compote, then you got the fresh blueberries and blackberries on top. That big dollop of chantilly cream will be gone before you know it.

Going the savory route, anything with the bechamel sauce is good imo,  because that sauce is just luxurious. Do try the shrimp scampi and roasted chicken, you'll find yourself craving it at times. Sometimes they skimp on the shrimp though..

Ordered the roasted chicken crepe during a busy time and they completely forgot the bechamel sauce.. without it the crepe was so dry and bland. No biggie though, told them there was no sauce, they handed it to us on the side and we got more bechamel than had they put it on.

Sometimes it's really busy,  sometimes it's not, but you gotta be patient for sure. It'll be worth it.",mt9mKxvSo1c_8DarT29RGw,4,1,5,q_hwetGI__7UtWAhZvqLbg

FRICKIN. GOOD!!!  But the crepe I had here was excellent!  The D'Anjou is a crepe filled with pears, candied walnuts, and almond paste with a caramel topping and lots of whipped cream.  Num!

Since we were staying in Paris, I brought it up to the room, but forgot to get it 'to go'.  So I just carried the plate up.  While leaving La Creparie, a lady saw my dish and, with a thick French accent, asked ""Excuse me, what kind of crepe is that?""  I told her ""the D'Anjou crepe"" in what I thought was my best French accent.  She didn't understand me (what can I say?...I took Spanish in high school  :P), so I translated for her and told her it was ""the pear one"".  Then in the elevator on the way up to the room, a French family was going up to their room.  They were all eyeing my crepe and talking about it in French, then asked where I got it from.  I let them know it was just downstairs.  Thankfully, they didn't ask me what kind of crepe it was because I didn't want to have to say the name again.  Who knew there were so many French people who fly half way around the world to stay at the Paris Hotel and eat crepes?!?  But I did a lot of free advertising for La Creperie with that D'Anjou!

Downsides:
Long wait?  Yes.  There's usually a line.  
Overpriced?  Yes.  It's $10/crepe.  Pricey, I know.

Thank you, wandering eyes.  If you could distill Beethoven's fifth symphony into a dessert, this crepe is what you'd get.  Ripe bananas bursting with sugar.  Peanutty, not-sweet peanut butter for contrast, and then a pound of whipped cream and carmel sauce all accompanied by a crepe make for one of the best desserts I've ever had.

Walking up to the window, the chef greets us. 

How many I assist you? One Ham & Cheese Crepe please.

A few minutes later, his masterpiece is ready. My wife grabs a knife & fork, I know to sit back and let her take the reins. She takes a bite. She shakes her head. She's in the zone. I know I can proceed without getting shanked.

When I tell you this crepe is so light, so flavorful, so bangin', its too legit to quit. Made with the freshest ingredients, the ham & gruyere cheese crepe is our go to crepe spot when we're on vacation in Las Vegas.

La Creperie sells dessert crepes as well as savory crepes. I never had them. We keep getting the Ham & Gruyere cheese crepe the day we land.

-*Breakfast*: roasted turkey, creamy eggs, avocado, pickled red onion, mozzarella, and bechamel 

The *Breakfast Crepe* was pretty tasty and fresh! All the flavors came together with the bechamel sauce and the roasted turkey was delicious with the eggs and mozzarella. The avocado and red onion was a light touch on top. 

For those that want basic coffee they offer that here and hand you the coffee cup where you fill it inside the adjacent JJ's Boulangerie, otherwise you have to go JJ's Boulangerie to order other specialty coffee drinks.

I actually yelped a crepe restaurant while we were on the strip and we purposely went to Paris only to go to La Creperie. You would think a crepe shop inside Paris hotel would be really pressured to perform up to a certain standard. All I can say was it was DEFINITELY not worth the price. 

The crepes itself didn't stand out. Mine looked like it was literally thrown together. The whipped cream was sliding off the crepe and pretty much off the crepe and on the side by the time we sat down. The nutella was plopped on the crepe like as a splatter. The presentation was simply just ugly. 

As for the service, I was appalled by how rude the lady was. I had asked if they had a crepe with strawberries and bananas, she said they could do the fresh berries with bananas. She then proceeded to tell me they charge for extra banana, which I was ok with. After getting my order however there were no banana. I asked her and she replied with ""oh you didn't order banana, you asked for nutella."" I replied with an assuredness that I DID ask for banana and she continued to be rude saying I didn't.

The boyfriend and I came here this past weekend, and were delightfully satisfied.

I ordered the D'Anjou. Which is a sweet crepe, with Almond Paste, Pears, and walnuts, topped with caramel sauce. Now, when they say ""topped with a caramel sauce"" they actually mean: ""3 skinny lines of caramel, carelessly scattered across your plate and crepe""

It was delicious though. The pears were canned, which at first, i was against, but then as i was eating it, i came the the conclusion that they were perfect because fresh pears would've been too hard. these still had a nice bite to them though, they weren't soggy. The almond paste gave a sweet, smooth, nutty blanket in the background.. it wasn't over powering with almond flavor.

The boyfriend ordered The Favorite. which was also a sweet crepe, stuffed with all types of berries (blueberries and strawberries come to mind, but i know there were more) topped with a berry sauce. It was very tangy, which complimented the sweet crepe perfectly.

The down side to this place, is the line. You order, and then spend 15-20 mins (depending on how big the line is.. more or less.) standing off to the side, waiting for your number to be called. Oh, and bottled water is $4 (for the small bottle) and $5 (for the bigger bottle.) 

The crepes are about $9... so for both our crepes, and 2 waters, the total came to $30. Was it worth $30? No. Not at all. But that's Vegas... you're mostly paying for where you're eating, secondary is WHAT you're eating.",l617rkPsrAj9igaSqXK7pg,5,4,4,P5bBbjeKwpk-m03PfklwqA

There are times when the crepes get too thick, sometimes too thin.

The crepes are absolutely amazing. Except for a hole-in-the-wall shop in Ireland, these are the best crepes I've ever had. Even after I give you the bad, I definitely urge you to stop by for a crepe. 

Now the reason for three stars...

The customer service is HORRIBLE. You can clearly tell Liliana despises her job. We planned on walking the strip for a bit so asked what time they would be closing. She ignored us, did a couple tasks, then sharply responded with ""midnight."" No smile, no other words, not even eye contact. Then, when we went back, it didn't get any better. She didn't say anything upon approaching the counter; just waited for us to order. We wanted a couple ingredients taken off of a crepe and she snapped back with it being the same price. We stated that we were aware of this and she instantly cut us off mid-sentence. I'm not expecting Disney World-esque customer service, but at least pretend you enjoy your job. I would say maybe she's had a bad day, but this is not the first negative encounter we've had with her and upon reading other reviews, other people have had negative customer service experiences as well. 

The only other negative would be price. I'm not too concerned with this as we expect nothing less being on the Las Vegas strip, in a tourist trap. They running at about a 21% food cost which is equitable to a bar, not a cafe. Elsewhere, the exact same product would be closer to $7, we spent $10.50 per crepe.

I think it is one of those must hit places when we come to Vegas. I have to thank my wife for that, she is the crepe connoisseur. They don't skimp out on the toppings, that is to say that even though we've been here several times, we only get the fresh berry crepe. I can't speak on any of the savory crepes, they have quite the menu, but for us it's fresh berries, or I believe we got Nutella and banana once, also very good.

For $9 apiece,  the crepes are really passable. They do stuff it chockful of fresh ingredients. 

Three of us shared the Napolean. The crepe is stuffed with berries and a generous amount of lemon curd and whipped cream are ladled on top of it. A perfect blend of sweet and sour.

We also had the St. Louis, which is ham and fresh basil with bechamel sauce. Not disappointing either.

Yes, if you go when the lines are long, you won't find many places to sit as it's not a restaurant. 

Definitely a good snack if you want to save room for dinner. Beats eating junk or McDonald's.

You're probably staying at the Paris Las Vegas on a weekend discount package.

As you come to realize you should go to bed with that question weighing heavily on your mind, you respond to a moment of weakness and come here. 

It's open late, well late for me, not for Vegas. 11PM. It's fairly quiet at this hour with the faux-Paris hallway with only a smattering of drunken tourists. The main dining room is closed, so you just walk up to the kiosk and order. Jamie and I split a $8.99 ""Favorite"" which was all sort of berries hidden under a large folded crepe. Lot of whipped cream, powdered sugar and berry puree oozing all over it (see my photo). In other words, it hit the spot. We sat in the dining area adjacent to the place and were perfectly content to discuss whether Cher has ever ordered one of these.

Since visiting the real deal in actual Paris, France, I thought it'd be a kick to visit Paris Las Vegas and see what was replicated from the original spot. While walking the casino, we passed by La Creperie and decided to see how it'll stack up with the crepes we tried in Paris.

We picked a sweet crepe (butter and sugar) and savory crepe (roasted chicken). There was limited seating nearby so I went to save a table while BF ordered. Since BF placed the order, he got to see the crepes being made. He was sad the crepe maker needed two gloved hands to flip the crepe, unlike the one-handed expertise we witnessed in Paris near the Tuileries Gardens. While both crepes were good, the sweet crepe tasted much better than the savory one. There's just something yummy about a simple crepe with some sugar and butter.

Luckily I was with friends, so I got to try a few different kinds.

Every stand is a little different, and being that this stand is on a busy walk way in a busy hotel in Vegas, they tend to me more about speed than anything else. So don't expect mind blowing crepes here. But if you think of it as fast food rather than fancy French pastries, you should be fairly content.

The prosciutto, gruyere, & b√©chamel crepe was the clear winner for me. I love bechamel sauce when it's done right. This was not perfect, but for a fast food stand I thought it was better than I expected, and it paired great with the prosciutto and gruyere.

The spinach and artichoke with bacon and cheese was also really good. I generally have more of a salt tooth than a sweet tooth, so I wasn't surprised that I preferred the savory crepes over the dessert ones. 

It's hard to screw up strawberry and chocolate crepes, and these were pretty good as well. But it's not real chocolate, it's Nutella. (I like Nutella, so this wasn't a bad thing, just not what I expected) But the strawberries were either over ripe or over cooked. Great strawberry crepes (in my opinion) have crisp strawberries laid in the crepes right before pulling it off the burner, so they are just starting to get warm, but not cooked.

Same thing with the chocolate banana. It had overly ripe or over cooked bananas with Nutella. 

So in my opinion, it's a good fast food option for the favors crepes, but if you want dessert, look elsewhere.",Br8LOacyANG7nI9r0DRqLQ,1,2,3,cCb5yjwlrp3SVK54lBkFew

My family got the savory crepe, I had a try at that, but even then it wasn't anything special, very loosely wrapped, everything falls out right when you cut into it.

Both were very good, I think I would have like to have had a little more strawberry jam spread over my Monte Cristo, but some how I managed to survive.  There was plenty of seating around the area, but I could see on a busy morning you may want to think about taking these to go since seating would be limited.  If you get a soda you'll be going inside the bakery to get that filled, they do not fill it for you at the counter.  Over all I would recommend La Creperie, but just be forewarned your wait time might be different than mine.",P-NTOAMFVSDFGkhcj4GaIQ,0,0,4,d2WlIXbrBPYjeqha_iEMzA

To eat we ordered a few different crepes, I ordered the breakfast crepe. Inside was roasted turkey onion mozzarella cheese, outside bechamel sauce with avocado.

I come here a few times a year for a quick, casual breakfast.  Notice I didn't say ""cheap,"" because that's one thing it is NOT.  $8.99 a crepe is a lot of money.  I guess they have to pay for their charming location on Le Boulevard inside Le Casino.

La Creperie only offers food for takeout, although there's a charming seating area to the left of the stand.  Go with a friend and have him or her save you a seat.  The seating area is pretty small, and you might have to get creative about getting a table.  The crepes are made to order, so get ready to wait 4-5 minutes for your order.

Since I have to order two of everything, I opted for two crepes: one breakfast crepe and one dessert crepe  They offer 6 breakfast crepe choices and 6 dessert crepe choices.  I went with a St. Louis crepe (pronounced ""sen-loo-WEE,"" like the Tampa Bay Lightning player, not like the city in Missouri) and a Peanut crepe (no pronunciation tips necessary).  

The St. Louis had prosciutto, cheese, basil and was drenched in bechamel sauce.  The sauce was thick, but a bit mealy.  Actually, now that I think about it, it looked pretty disgusting, kind of like milky cream of wheat.  The crepe was very tasty and filling, though.  The second crepe, the Peanut was chock full of chunky peanut butter and bananas.  I would have called it The Elvis (in loving memory).  The Peanut was very sweet, but it still made for a pretty good dessert.  It's not the best dessert crepe out there, though.  Berry and fruit crepes are much better.

Piece of advice: skip the coffee.  It's too weak and taste-less.  I saw people walking around with Starbucks cups.  If I hadn't been so lazy, I would have stopped by a Starbucks before ordering my crepes.  Starbucks is not very Paris like, but . . . you know how they say that Seattle is the Paris of the Pacific Northwest?

Assuming that every customer orders 1-2 crepes each, it is not surprising that the service was very slow. I ended up waiting for 15 minutes to get one crepe. 

The portion is pretty general, though. One crepe is definitely split-able between 2 people. 

Moreover, I think they lack some serious variety of crepes. There are only about 6 kinds for each of the sweet and savory crepe categories. And none of them specifically sounded appetizing to me. I ended up ordering one sweet and one savory crepes.

Granted that it is very hard to screw things up with chocolate, this place has miraculously produced crepes that were too sweet and creamy for my taste. I felt a bit queasy afterwards.

St. Louis ($9.99) - imported ham and mozzarella and fresh basil with bechamel. The description mentioned imported ham. Maybe they meant imported from the local grocery store, because the ham didn't taste any better than what I get at Albertson's. The bechamel sauce was too thin and runny for my liking.

Toulouse ($9.99) - ground sausage, pepperoni, saut√©ed mushrooms, mozzarella, basil, topped with marinara. This was the better of the two that we ordered. Tasted just like a pizza. The marinara lacked the depth in flavor that would make it special, but was good enough to satisfy.

I went with the Fruits de Mer( http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/z1163PZ9voGYg4HawDXrkw/l ) which had shrimp, scallops, mushrooms, Swiss cheese and Bechamel sauce.

Not even a crepe suzette! I had the D'Anjou - a pear, almond paste, caramel, whipped cream and walnut concoction

The pears were so-so and mixed with the paste, produced a not super flavorful milky juice that kinda grossed me out and the whipped cream was a bit ""cool whip"" tasting. I did manage to make it almost all the way through, however because the crepe itself was delicious.

My friend had the seafood crepe, which I got to when it was a little cold. It was buttery and I imagine very good warm, but the bechamel sauce on the top was a little floury.

One of my favorite places to go eat in Vegas is here!  I love crepes and this place satisfies my cravings. 

When in need for good food quick, come here (only during the non rush hours and non-holidays week).  They don't have an actual restaurant.  La Creperie is a food stand that has a large kitchen.   It is located in Paris.  You order the food at the cashier and just wait for your number to be called.  

My favorite crepes:  St. Louis ( prosciutto, cheese, basil with bechamel sauce) and the Napoleon (Lemon Custard with Raspberries, Blueberries, and Strawberries).  We also ordered one that had salsa on top, but I can't remember the name.  It was also really good.

Good crepe:  Toulouse.  It taste like a Calazone. 

All the crepes cost about $8-10.  The portions are HUGE.  My 3 sisters and I shared 3 crepes.  It was very very filling! 

Cons:  When you go during a holiday week, expect the wait to be LONG.  We went during Christmas week and it literally took us about 40 mins just to order and get the food.   However, when I ate here during a non-holiday week, I got the food instantly (10 mins).  Also, there is a seating area right next to the stand, but finding a table and chairs is INSANE!! Honestly, it's like a whole new world... you see the ugliest side of a person.  There's so much tension and hostility when people are looking for a table and chair.  My family was lucky enough to find a table but just trying to get one more chair took 20 minutes.  Also, while you're eating, you can feel and see people lurking at your table and ready to grab your table once you are done.  It's like a jungle.  *Survival of the Fittest!*  However, please remember that I went here during Christmas week.

Overall, I totally recommend this place!",9ob7FJ4pESsJdfrr32679w,1,1,4,5soMhT2hFCV5pTcQIcxk5Q

The line of customers didn't move that quickly and while the cooks hustled, I wondered why it looked like they were busy assembling a meal at a 1-star Michelin restaurant. 

So much activity for crepes? Crepes are simple & fast to prepare.

(I wonder if someone didn't show up and do the prep work?)

At any rate, the crepes were good. I had the breakfast crepe with roasted turkey, red onion, b√©chamel and avocado, hit the spot.

My little boy had one that was all sweet and whipped cream, etc. I tried to redirect him to something with a protein but he was on vacation, why not. 

Seating, while plentiful, was in a drab, dark room. I wondered if they could lighten it up, add some ""Parisian street charm"" if you will, so you didn't feel they were saying,

""Finish your food and get...out.""

My staple was the Normandy, warm apples, caramel, and the ton of whipped cream everyone talks about. I was happy with this, content you could say. I have strayed in the past, trying a savory as opposed to sweet crepe, but it just wasn't the same. 

This most recent trip to Sin City I was messaged by Mr Z and told about a new delectable crepe being offered: The Peanut Butter and Banana crepe. Anyone who knows me, knows my love affair with peanut butter is a long and satisfying one. Bananas are a new love and I recently discovered that the two combined are an unstoppable force.  Throw in a thin, chewy crepe, and some of the whipped cream and you have yourself... well just look at the picture.

We went with the Seafood Crepe which included Bechamel sauce, shrimp, scallops and spinach. It took about 10 minutes (they are all made fresh) and you can watch yours being made. 

This was one of the best crepes I ever ate. Thick enough that it wasn't falling apart, fresh ingredients, and the Bechamel sauce was outstanding. We both felt this was the hidden gem of the trip.

I had looked at the menu the night before and knew that I had to decide between a savory ham & cheese crepe and a more sweet blueberry lemon crepe.  That morning I was feeling savory and so I went over to find a seat in the seating area while my girlfriend did the ordering.  Due to that I don't really have much to say about the place itself since I did not see much of it.  My ham and cheese crepe came out to me looking nice and covered in a b√©chamel sauce which I mistook as cheese.  The crepe was pretty tasty as ham was good and salty which paired nicely with the Gruyere and it quickly disappeared from my plate.  Whenever my girlfriend had also finished her crepe we started talking about ordering a sweeter crepe for a dessert of sorts.  My girlfriend decided to spoil me and let me have both of the crepes that I had thought looked good the night before by deciding to split the blueberry lemon crepe with me.  She once again went over and ordered and came back with an amazing looking plate.  The crepe was in the center covered in a berry sauce, blueberries and powdered sugar with a Chantilly cream on the side.  In the middle of the crepe was some lemon curd which gave the dish some sourness that worked really well with everything else that was sweet on the plate to keep it from being too sweet.  In the end there was nothing left as we both had enjoyed our meal.

The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  While I believe that it is a bit overpriced to enjoy on a regular basis, the food is great and it could easily be a nice little treat every now and again.",4m9NXICYBC5i9t4aTt-I6w,0,1,4,LBBbSzLWQy7XPEoP4yyl9A

As we waited for our crepes I will admit it was a fairly long wait but hey its Vegas what do you expect.  After finally getting our crepes we looked for a place to sit.  About the only downfall to this place is the fact that that there are definitely  not enough places to sit.  We walked all around the area without a seat to be found. So we saw a tall table and decided what the heck let's just stand and eat.  I will say standing and eating can actually be good because I didn't feel as stuffed.
All in all this place for me was worth the wait. The Crepe was perfectly cooked with the right amount of food to get you going. I will be coming back

However, the dining room is poorly maintained.  It is usually not clean, and most of the chairs are broken - many are mismatched extra banquet chairs.

Both times I have dined here recently, they have gotten my order wrong.  One time, they forgot one of the crepes, and were rather rude when we brought this to their attention.  The next time, they tried to charge us for two crepes even though we only ordered one.  Not sure why the staff here has such a difficult time taking orders properly.

My biggest complaint is that they charge for water.  I find it to be unacceptable service when I pay for food and tap water is not available free of charge.  Furthermore, if you are going to charge me for a cup, it would have been nice to give me a full size cup, rather than a very small one, which I had to refill multiple times.  I asked if I could have the larger cup instead, and the answer was a firm no.  I understand that they want it to be plastic, so that it is see-through, and more difficult to steal a drink other than water, but make it a bigger size.

~ Caramelized Pear $10.25 caramelized pears, raisins, maple syrup, candied hazelnuts & chantilly cream. This was wonderful- sweet, warm, and the combination of soft pears and crunchy nuts was wonderful. One needs a tea or water to cut the sweetness after a while though.

~ Ham & Cheese $11.45 parisian ham, gruyere & b√©chamel sauce. WOWOWOWOW!! This was AMAZING! If you only have room for 1 crepe get this one. The meat  has a wonderfully smoky flavor and the gruyere is the perfect addition to the dish. The creamy and salty flavors mix well and leave you very full.

This will be my 3rd or fourth time to this yummy creperie place.

 What makes it special is the quality and yumminess of the crepe itself and the creme they put on top. Its addicting! Seriously! Plus the fact that they do NOT use canned ingredients for the fruits and veggies. 

The best selections are the dessert crepes - they use real fruits which is beneficial because they do not soak through the fluffy crepe batter.
I had the ""Favorite"" which consists of fresh berries and cream...so good! 

The nutella with strawberries and bananas is also yummy, 

The Toulous is good for marinara lovers, while the Spinach Cheese Mushroom is also really good. 

Their crepes are quite sizeable as well! 

For coffee lovers, this place is quality.  They offer smooth and well-flavored quality coffee.

The only bummer is the slow service - it's a walk up window and there's almost always a line, whether weekday or weekend. I've tried both and stood in a line no matter what. (mind you this is around the holidays).",2TPODjHaHQ-cThz-oahpXQ,0,0,4,KjyBe1wAzhaA87ozBI8Qhw

My last trip to Las Vegas, I had a delicious ""Seafood Crepe"" featuring scallops and shrimp smothered in a sauce that I still think of to this day.

Later in my trip i stopped in for dessert and had my usual ""The Nutella"", Peanut butter & Banana's smothered in chocolate syrup and whipped cream. This has got to be the greatest dessert on earth...

Location wise it's easy to miss La Creperie. As you walk through the Paris ""food court"" (more of a hallway) it is stuffed between two large restaurants. There is VERY limited seating and sometimes you have to battle it out for a table but people seem to come and go fast enough that you shouldn't have a problem.

Price-wise it's extremely reasonable when you consider the quality and quantity you are getting. Let me speak from experience.

Reasonably priced, for the portion you're getting. And when plated, it looks beautiful and decadent. Can get a small discount if you're a Total Rewards member.  Everything fresh and made to order. And a large and very filling crepe! 

Hazelnut/banana - I thoroughly enjoyed this hearty crepe and by the time I finished, I was stuffed! Full of banana chunks and generous layer of Nutella. Every bite was oozing with it, and the light, airy cream complimented the crepe perfectly. Comes with candied hazelnuts but I nixed that. $11

Blueberry lemon - giant blueberries on top of the crepe! Looked so fresh and delicious. No mushy blueberries here. But my husband was not a fan of this crepe, because of the lemon curd filling. There was no texture, and to him it seemed a bit gooey. He said the crepe itself was tasty and was not overly sweet. $11.25

We took ours to-go. The girl taking our order was very pleasant. The girl forgot this, but easily popped a lid onto our plate. Utensils and napkins to the side!

They didn't serve full coffee, which I think they should(lattes, mochas, etc.) to complete the crepes experience.

One of the most reasonably priced places to eat in all of Vegas. They are consistently good. When in Vegas I have a crepe for breakfast, and another for a midnight snack.

Tips from a regular.....

 - They stop taking orders about 15 minutes before they close. So if when they close at 11 pm, you need to be in line by 10:45 pm.

 -  Order the combo. No matter the crepe's price, if you order a combo, you get the crepe and drink for 10.99. Depending on the time of year, the combo might be 9.99. The combo is a better deal than the rewards price. 

 - If you get a soft drink or coffee, just ask for your drink cup, then go next door to JJ's Boulangerie, for your drink. The crepe window is part of JJ's, and inside JJ's they have a larger selection of soft drinks and teas.",fLoGVNP5bTvjvIdvubecnw,1,1,5,_O16BLYU_NKb6KlkBDPPuQ

There wasn't much special about it and the berries weren't very sweet or fresh. And the service took a LONG time for just a simple berry crepe. They also mounded half of my plate with really heavy whipped cream, and although I'm biased because I only like whipped cream from starbucks, it was just bad whipped cream in general. The only good thing about this creperie is that for about $10, the huge crepe will fill you up, whether you get the dessert or savory crepe because they're both the same price there.",EHhWhy5qvPo4Y5wrEK6PpQ,0,0,3,xBNoTdXLLDdo7E_08PJ_1Q

You'd think that the Paris Hotel would have a great place to get a nice dish of crepe, but like some of the fake shit on the Strip this wasn't the case.  

The line was miles long and that got me excited.  I was thinking, ""Fuck.  All of these people can't be wrong.  They are waiting for a crepe in the Paris Hotel of all places.""  Seating in this area is a bit of a reach because in the same vicinity lies a confectionery serving chocolate, the omnipresent buffet, and several high end restaurants.  

The Toulouse was my crepe of choice.  I had to wait another 20 minutes or so because there was only 2 crepe makers (Some advice for the legion of owners of the Paris Hotel who might be reading this review. Make the place bigger, or move it to a different part of the resort).

Merde***.  This crap, um crepe was horrible.  The pancake part resembled a tortilla.  If I wanted Mexican, I could have gone elsewhere on the Strip.  The pizza like filing was like what a former co-worker described....gahbitch!!

One last note.....when one of the crap makers was making our crepes, some of the filing from the various crepes landed on her fingers.  Instead of wiping it off with a towel, she audibly and overtly slurped it away and proceeded to finish our crepes.........  

I didn't know that culinary arts degrees were awarded from gumball machines.

We didn't know where it was, so we asked the gentleman working behind the Players Club Desk ""where are the crepes?""  Not only did he give us directions to the location, he gave us an ""Insider Tip"" card - personal handwritten coupon for us (buy a crepe, get a free coffee or drink).  Sure you think, free drink, no big deal.  Well, at $2.99 a drink, we were appreciative of the insider tip card!

I have had crepes before - the best being in Vancouver, BC.  But here, in the end, the crepes were ok.  We got one of the salty ones -  the size was enough for 2 people.  I think they were unable to keep up with the volume of orders b/c the veggie filling inside was cold.

My favorite savory crepe was one with seafood in a creamy white sauce. My favorite dessert one came with Nutella and I always added bananas. I don't think people know that you could customize your order.

I would of suggested this place when it was cheaper. Not sure if it's worth the two dollar raise in prices. Also, since it is just a window front, you have to look for your own table. That area is by the bathroom and it's always pack. So I don't think it's worth the effort paying the price you do and then having to stand around waiting for a table and most likely having to bus it yourself. The way they serve the crepes is on a plate and you definitely need a fork and knife. You can't just pick it up and go and eat it like an ice cream. Someone needs to open up a crepe place just like it, fix all the problems and I know they would make a killing.",xA_upwVTOVtXkS0NGISGng,0,0,3,5G4XV1ZcT4o2bcY2L4md1w

This is arguably my favorite stop in Vegas.  It's a special place for me, because on our first trip to Vegas very early on in our dating times, my now-fianc√© and I must have eaten like 6 crepes from here.  I think I've tried nearly everything on the menu that isn't meat-y.

The crepes are $9.99 and come in sweet and savory varieties -- we mostly go with the sweet -- my favorite is the peanut one, but strangely I don't order it much due to its richness.  My second favorite is the D'anjou pear one with walnuts.  The apple one is the most basic, and they all come with this yummy whipped cream on top that melts into the crepe -- we get it on the side to save my stomach from lactose issues.

The one savory one I've tried is the one with ratatoulle and egg... very tasty and fresh.  I love that all the crepes are made-to-order and generous.

The only downside is the seating.  Except for the one time we showed up shortly before it closed,  we literally have to circle the eating area to the left of this place to be able to sit our butts down the second someone leaves.  Otherwise, you'll have nowhere to sit and enjoy your yummy crepe.  Overall, a cheap snack or meal.",GbhQXcNU-4--jFzJe4H0Mw,0,1,5,UQBG5jjlekyGtt46tpBTqQ

CREPE: 
-*Breakfast*: roasted turkey, creamy eggs, avocado, pickled red onion, mozzarella, and bechamel

I got La Forestiere, which had spinach, mushrooms, boursin and mozzarella, though I was tempted to get the crepe with ratatouille so I could have been reminded about cartoon cooking mice....

It looked like they covered all the savory crepes in bechamel sauce, which was congealy but tasted kind of good -- it was late, I was hungry.  Sure, it was almost ten bucks, but I probably would have spent just as much on something at one of the cafes, and for those with girly appetites, there was plenty for two people to share.

I've only given into the temptation one time though.  Actually, we stopped that time cause our niece and nephew wanted crepes, and there were no lines on that occasion.

They've got the usual crepe choices.  Both savory crepes and dessert crepes.  I always prefer the dessert crepes cause I am such a sweet tooth.  The prices are expensive compared to most crepes that I've had elsewhere.  Although, if you are a Total Rewards member, then you get a discounted price of 50 cents off.  Still expensive though.

Our niece and nephew both enjoyed their choices while my wife and I thought our orders were just average.  Both my niece and I ordered the Nutella crepe which contained nutella, bananas, candied hazelnuts, cream, and caramel sauce.   She said she would give it 8 out of 10.  I thought that for the price, it was just average.  It tasted fine, but it should be priced 2 to 3 dollars lower.  Same for the other crepes that we ordered which were the mixed berries crepe and the ham & cheese crepe.  

Overall, just 3 stars because the crepes are overpriced.  I know that we're on the Las Vegas Strip, but come on!

Even though I was super tired at 6:15 A.M. and wanted my bed at that point I decided to stop at this place. at that point they were getting ready and stated that they would open at 7. So I decided to go back and gamble until 7 A.M. since I was really hungry. (I do not recommend you continuing gambling once you have decided to stop haha). Once I get back at 7 they stated that still needed another 10 minutes to open. So I waited. Even though I was the second person in line it took 20 minutes for them to make two crepes which I though was more then it should've taken. I got the Nutella banana fosters crepe which was absolutely amazing! I would defenitly get it again next time if I stay at Paris. The reason for the 4 stars is due to the amount of time it took to make two crepes and them not opening when they promised it would be open.,oHKuvhYdT9O5i1msyamzGA,1,0,4,WbLN8Sy1RttZq_bHeRVcmQ

Crepes:
1) Nutella Crepe with Bananas - Very soft and delicious, but it was a little too sweet with the chocolate and the whipped cream. A crepe with nutella and fruit is enough.
