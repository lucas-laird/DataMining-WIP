My really only complaint is the size of the black cod portions in the lettuce cups. I understand what it takes to cost food out and make a profit but these cod pieces were literally .5 oz or less. Almost couldn't see it , the pieces were so tiny. For 6 bucks , I thought I would get more fish.

392708,2016-02-03,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"This was from several months ago.  I was delighted when a friend alerted me to a recent ELV post about Japaneiro. Mr. Curtas said it had one of the best steaks in the valley. So off I went with a couple friends to sample some delightfully balanced and wonderfully flavored food presented by a proud and friendly staff. The first impression when you drive to this location (7315 West Warm Springs Road, exactly a 15 min, easy drive from my hotel) is that it better have good food to bring people in. The specials board is front and center when you walk to the smallish but well layer out dining room.

I made what I though was a huge mistake by leaving my glasses back at the hotel so I was blind trying to read the menu, which may have turned out to be a blessing! But after reading the specials board (Fresh Japanese abalone, prime dry aged rib eye, uni here and uni there, Nigerian giant prawn, and so on...) I knew the menu would have to be explored another time.

I will not go into each individual bite and dish as my time is limited this morning (trying to qualify for WSOP) but will say that the flavors that chef and owner Kevin Chong (what a nice and proud gentleman) coaxes out of his dishes along with the laser like focus and layering is at times mesmerizing (salmon belly cevich?, uni bites, Foie/scallop bite...). Does everything work with absolute precision? In my opinion no. Pretty damn close though! I found the bone marrow and the bone marrow filet to be a bit clunky (although the filet was cooked PERFECTLY and of top quality) and the duck and Foie too rich (to be fair about that dish though, it was ordered late and was the final of something like 12 full sized dishes so maybe try it again).

Finally, to address Mr. Curtas' claim about one of the best steaks in the valley...it could be (we did not sample the tomahawk chop and I am referring to the dry aged ribeye only). The steak was perfectly cooked, sliced and presented on a wooden board adorned with 6-8 different types of salt and two dipping sauces. My preference and what I would suggest is to skip the sauces. Again, they were not bad (actually very tasty) but I felt it detracted from the quality of the beef. Also one word of warning about this steak. Ribeyes are inherently fatty and when the steak is presliced before it comes to the table many pieces of the glorious meat still have some fat attached. Personally it doesn't bother me and if proportioned right will enhance the experience.

Price-wise, I think one can dine for a very reasonable tab (at the moment they are BYOB so that keeps tabs reasonable). Our bill for 3 was close to $200 each. BUT, and that is a BIG BUT, we had about 12 dishes, 2 of which were the $90 a piece abalone.

Kevin, server Jeffery and the rest of the staff (please forgive me forgetting the name of the wonderful sous chef!) have much to be proud of. This is a place that should be on everybody's radar.",AeQbL7ZA-dbMLf4I--l2_A,1,0,4,eeoFHXFsK17ooNqQx2vSvw

The rock shrimp was super yummy, portion size was a great deal for the happy hour price.  We also tried the truffle oil edamame, it was ok.  I have to say I really like traditional or a hot and spicy taste better than than the truffle oil.  We tried one each of the skewers.  The chicken was not that flavorful, but the steak was much better.  For the cost it's a bit on the expensive side, but since it's a good cut of meat I don't mind the extra expense.  The gyoza beef was very tasty.  Lastly we had an order of the house special fried rice.  Portion size was surprising for cost.  It's definitely shareable with lots of meat.

507364,2015-01-17,3,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Somebody please enlighten me about what I'm missing!

Live close to here so noticed it when it first opened. Didn't go right away, but kept seeing awesome reviews so we decided to try it out. 

We arrived about 10 minutes after they opened for lunch on a Saturday, already 3 tables seated so we thought to ourselves, this is going to be awesome!  

First of all, the club music was so loud, I couldn't hear the hubs sitting across from me. Easy fix, asked the server to turn the music down. Much better. 

We ordered:
-Edamame - this was delicious, fresh edamame with nice truffle flavor. Not worth the price though...
-Firecracker shrimp - this was pretty good, but I'd rather spend $6 at bonefish grill's bang bang Wednesdays and get a heaping mound of it. Wasn't ""wow""
-Lotus chip tuna - similar to the tostadas at Soho. I really liked the lotus chip, but felt the tuna was lacking (both in portion and in taste/freshness)
-All 3 tacos - this is when things started to go south. The first one I tried was the tuna, and the only thing I could think of was ""wow, this tastes like that powdery Mexican spice you get from a packet with some mush in the middle"" The Mexican spice was so overwhelming that I couldn't taste the tuna at all. The second one was the beef and I thought ""hmmm, Mexican spice taco shell with Korean bugolgi"". The salmon was the best (nice freshness of fish/avo/sauce), although still too much Mexican spice on the taco.
-Bone marrow - I think these came from a starving cow. Very little marrow, too much crap on top, and greasy tortilla chips on the side. Why would you need salts/spices on the plate if the marrow itself is already seasoned? (if you want to try an amazing bone marrow for less the price and more portion-wise, try Gordon Ramsay Steak at the Paris)
-Scallop - too much sauce, couldn't get the scallop. Scallop wasn't quite seared enough on the outside so tasted too mushy.
-Foie gras - ehhh, have had better. Sauce tasted burnt.
-Banana dessert - pretty good, nice caramelization on the outside.
-Green tea creme brulee - you know those crunchy strips of noodles you get at a Chinese buffet to dip in the bright red sweet/sour sauce? The crème brulee was topped with something that reminded me a lot of that (besides, if there is good caramelization on the brulee, why would you need noodle strips?)  It also tasted way tooo burnt, like I was spooning burnt custard in my mouth. 

I think we got something else, but neither one of us can remember what it was...  I guess it just wasn't memorable enough.  On the plus side, service was awesome and the plating is beautiful. Prices are a little steep for what the food is. Don't get me wrong, we don't mind paying for good food. But this just wasn't it. They also need to figure out that a Mexican spiced taco shell plus some salmon poke does not fusion make. 

I really like to see little businesses succeed and I hope they do, but unfortunately, I cannot recommend this place to anyone nor will we be back.",dcSLz5d9xiSFb8zsqn2zKQ,3,2,2,-_wc_dSakHstKCu3hgBlXQ

I ordered the salmon tacos ($4) and the chicken yakisoba ($7). The salmon tacos came in 2. I had hoped hoped for a more poki style taste, but it was just mostly a salmon taste. the sides were crispy. They did have a yakiudon option, but I thought it was the soup option. Boy, was I wrong. I wish I had ordered the yakiudon because I prefer the fat noodles. It was pretty ordinary as in taste wise.

We came here last minute for Valentines Day.  After eating here, I'm surprised we were able to get a table.  My gain :)

It was an expected preset menu 7 course meal for $150 for two people - see pic.  Unbelievably reasonable.

We started off with the Teramoto Scallop with uni - with a refreshing yuzu soy.  Fresh and delicious.  Second was scottish salmon cerviche - this was just ok compared to the rest of the meal.  Next was kumamoto oysters - love the taste of the ocean.  Then escargot - not chewy and loved the butter sauce.

The next two is the MAIN reason why anyone should come here!  Nigerain Prawns and bone marrow fillet with foie gras.  We shared a full prawn which had to be almost a foot long and then one portion of the bone marrow which my mouth is melting just writing this review.  I'm told both of these items are always on the menu.

First, they now serve beer, wine and sake; including Ashai on draft.  I had some excellent sake.  Also, there is some pretty nice otuside space for those that enjoy eating al fresco; it's finally getting cool enough in LAS to enjoy that, and it's quiet and pleasant outdoors.  

We went at about 8 and we were the only folks there, which, based on our experience, is a real mystery.  We had a terrific meal, including top notch service.  Many of the itmes previously identified as specials are now on the regular menu, but htere was still a very signficant specials board.  Sadly, oysters, which we definitely wanted, were on the board, but had run out.  INstead, we had seaweed salad (simply but refreshing); salmon ceviche (ecellent, with a very fresh set of wonton chips and a nice zing to the ceviche itself); the 7 oz NY Strip steak grilled medium rare, with the sauces and salts (we really enjoyed this, including the portion size, which was just right to have a good tast of beef but not overwhelming); shrimp done on a sizzling plate with asparagus and onion (the winner of the evening; the shrimp were a perfect size, and cooked just to the point of doneness, and the sauce that accompanied them and vegetables had us wanting to lick it right off the red-hot plate); and finally, their combination friend rice, which was a very ample portion (we are still eating today) and nicely prepared, with a smoky rather than fatty taste.  As you can see, we did not go quite as deep into the unusal specials as we wil next time but everything we had was excellent, and clearly prepared with great care.  We spoke to the chef twice and assured him we would be back soon; he was cordial and clearly enjoyed the interaction.  He did send out two glasses of plum wine at the end of the evening, and it made a terrific and tasty finish to the meal.",esaN8m_u5te-GZi2dAdD_Q,0,0,5,JyVOndqFmmdwzd7GPr3H7w

I told our server that I was a vegetarian and Chef Ken came out right away to ask me what I liked so that he could prepare a special tasting for me.  I was impressed!  We started with truffle edamame which was super delicious. I also ordered the spinach salad which I loved. The dressing is great; buttery, sweet and salty.  Chef Kevin kept sending me vegetarian delights all night. First he sent avocado tacos in a wonton shell,  then amazing enoki mushroom bouquets and for the main entrée tofu with spicy cilantro sauce and hollindaise with a fresh vegetable mix.

The restaurant is in the back of a non-descript mall car-park, if for some strange reason you walked past you probably wouldn't look twice however this place is amazing.

Our server was fast, friendly and knew all the dish details, he provided great recommendations and kept our green tea cups full.  We shared a starter of beef gyoza, followed by salmon tacos and black cod wraps.  The gyoza had the right balance of crisp and soft with perfectly cooked filling.  Salmon tacos and cod wrap - nothing more to say other than wow.

At this point Kevin the head chef and owner came out to chat.  Interesting guy with a love of food and a very impressive restaurant resume to match.

Queue the mains of soft shell crab and Nigerian prawns with (our choice of) truffle butter.  The crab was perfect, if I was forced to critique I would say the prawn was a tiny bit firm but still excellent and the plate was left clean.

The food is on par and, with the starters, even exceeding some of the best high end asian fusion places on the strip.  Very highly recommended, will definitely be back.

The rib eye and filet mignon was cooked to our liking and the seasoning done well. They also plate it with additional side spices that you can use to add flavor. There are no side dishes that come with the entree so if you need a side dish like me, you'll have to order side ala carte's. 
The service was very slow. It was one of the slowest services I've had. It did take quite awhile for us to have our order taken and for the food to come out. That was the only downfall to the experience. The waiter was nice though.

We were seated promptly and greeted warmly by the kindest server. She was quite knowledgeable about the entire menu. 
Which for me was a huge help. This was my first experience in Japanese fusion. 
It was 5PM when we arrived and still happy hour. We ordered the Goyza, the beef taco and the butter lettuce wraps from the happy hour menu. All of the items arrived beautifully plated. My favorite was the beef taco. The beef so tender it melts in your mouth. The aioli with wasabi was the perfect creaminess.   
We also ordered the spinach salad and noodles. My Dh loved the spinach salad. We both enjoyed the noodles with Jadori chicken. I am not a seafood eater, it was not my favorite. Still perfectly done, and presented beautifully. 
The shining star of our meal was the 24 oz ribeye. This plate was so pretty we hated to eat it. It was more than enough for the two of us. I have honestly never had a better steak, even at fine steak houses. The chef brought out the true flavor of the steak. It was presented with a puree of mushrooms and truffle oil, a Peruvian spice dip, and a small sprinkle of salt and pepper. Each bite tender and flavorful.
There was no room left for dessert, maybe on our next visit. 
The service was outstanding. It was a pleasure to meet the chef. I enjoyed learning of his background. He appeared to me to be a chef who took pride in his craft.

Some of the specials were sold out when we got there and the waiter had gone through letting us know which dishes he recommended.

Truffled Marrow Filet: OH HELL YES.  This dish was so freaking good.  After we finished most of it, we got a bowl of rice to soak up everything we didnt get the first time around and it was so damn good.  
Scallop Sashimi 
Escargot
genmai ice cream (the brown one)

Good:
Scallop with Foie Gras - the foie kind of over powers the scallop

Started with the tuna tacos and lettuce wrap Seabass which both were bomb and tasty.

Walking in you immediately take in all the goodies that are on the grill! The aroma is phenomenal! 

We decided to check this place out and took advantage of the happy hour which didn't disappoint. We literally tried everything from the small menu and it was all filing. Every little bite was really packed with flavor and let's start from the beginning - 
The gyoza's were filled with tender meat and steamed to perfection. The tuna trio which was tuna, salmon & beef were crispy and all fillings tender. The tuna & salmon lotus chips were all one bites and sweet, creamy & spicy. The beef & chicken skewers came over hot off the grill, so delicious! The sea bass & cod bites were by far my favorite and I wanted more! And now to the desserts - both very unique. The tiramisu came with a side of green tea ice cream which was a fun combo of flavors and the fried banana egg rolls had chili powder sprinkled over them along with some honey. This dish came with milk tea ice cream that was fantastic! I could eat that ice cream anytime...

The intimate space was very cute and it felt very cozy. Service was fantastic and the chef came out to say hi to the first timers. He was very sweet! I am looking forward to going back and trying things off the main menu!",LNPyE5X1K5B_flcTCH9StQ,16,13,4,gVDy_9UiBhXtVR1yrc266g

To give you an idea of how badly my friend and I wanted to come here during our stay in Vegas, we did a 1-day car rental just to drive here to eat. (We are very serious about our food adventures!)

Our waitress, Lolo, is an absolute sweetheart. She totally understands the importance of our camera eating first ;). When she brought out the scallop with uni dish, the uni slid off the scallop while she was putting the plate down. Without us even asking her to, she immediately brought it back to the kitchen so the chef can put the uni back on top of the scallop so we can take our picture.

We came on a Wednesday night around 9:30pm, so we can do the late happy hour in addition to the special dishes. We ordered:

Uni Bites
Truffle Bone Marrow
Uni Scallop
Shigoku Oysters
Uni Chawanmushi
Tuna Lotus Chip (HH)
Salmon Tacos (HH)

My favorite was the uni chawanmushi. The seafood broth with steamed egg custard was such a perfect, delicate balance. I think I would've liked the scallop with uni better if it was a raw scallop. I personally don't like cooked or seared scallops.

Everything we tried was delicious and Japaneiro definitely met and went beyond our expectations. Just when we thought things couldn't get any better, the chef brought out an extra dish for us on the house!! He found out we came all the way from NY and rented a car just to eat here. He gave us black cod with foie gras in a lettuce wrap! And oh my god, it was so good. He also added caviar onto the oysters for us. (Thank you!!! ^__^)

This meal was definitely on the pricier side, considering we came here for more of a ""snack."" We already had dinner around 6pm and came here just to try the special dishes. Between four people, we each paid around $40 after tip/tax.",HWsp32vzf9S4ui05l2vqXQ,7,4,5,3o6Hkz8DDY5fOQOLQuezvg

1791208,2016-06-08,1,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Very friendly service, but it all went downhill from there. I looked at the reviews (here) and it was mostly great, so I decided to take my girlfriend here to celebrate our anniversary. Horrible mistake!

When we arrived (and even when we left), we were the only ones dining. We were greeted by our waitress Lolo, who was very nice and knowledgeable on the entire menu. However, the list of dishes were somewhat confusing: no images nor descriptions on the menu, and the specials on the wall board were lengthy and all required a vocal description from the waitress. It required a good 5 minutes to understand the menu.

I ordered the lotus chips w/ scallops, fried rice, yakisoba noodles, Nigerian prawns broiled w/ truffle butter, and the tobanyaki w/ filet mignon. The lotus chips were expensive ($10), but somewhat worth the price. Don't expect to be filled, but it was good representation of what Asian fusion food is all about. The fried rice and yakisoba noodles were, on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the best, an 8. The Nigerian prawns were delicious, but for $26... again, don't expect to be filled. Finally and unfortunately, the tobanyaki w/ filet mignon... it just never came out. I waited patiently for 40 minutes and after I politely inquired to the waitress, I was told that the order was never placed!

I'm torn how to feel about the service. The waitress was very nice and seemed forgiving, but after saying sorry twice, she acted like the situation never happened. For a restaurant that only had one customer dine-in for the two-hour window that we were there, you would think that they would make efforts to make me a happy customer. Perhaps offer to serve me the filet mignon on the house or if that's too much, maybe discounted? Or compensate by waiving another item off the menu, or offer a substitute that can be made fast.

As my girlfriend and I left, we didn't sense much sympathy. As we walked out and into our car, we passed by a couple staff members who didn't greet or thank us.

- If you are looking to be filled, DON'T COME HERE. Portions are too small for the price.
- If you are on a date, DON'T COME HERE. If I was the only one dining and received a questionable experience, what makes you think you'll receive exceptional service?

I could have taken my girlfriend to an AYCE sushi restaurant and we would've been much happier. I don't like wishing bad on any business, but it's hard to imagine this place staying operational for much longer if they couldn't give great service to the only two customers they had for a 2-hour window.",ezIORV7xsOnbfyGAEaQCag,3,0,2,rFJWpYZUeeT2oQbLq8tZMg

When walking in, you are instantly greeted and shown to a table - depends on how busy it is I'm assuming. They hand you a menu and tell you the daily specials and what's popular. The daily specials are also written on the wall! The only downside is they don't have any alcohol yet but they will soon.

For the appetizers, we got the beef, tuna, and salmon tacos. One order comes with two so you can easily share with someone. We also got the rock shrimp. The shrimp were big and the sauce wasn't too overpowering so it was delicious. The presentation of the food was really nice too - I felt like I was in some type of super fancy restaurant on the strip. 

For dinner, we got the miso black cod and chilean sea bass. And oh boy! it was soooo good. The presentation of the food was also on point. The miso black cod literally melted in my mouth. It was cooked to perfection and I plan on going again this weekend to eat it again haha It came with seaweed salad on the side. The chilean sea bass was  little bigger but it was also equally delicious. It came with two sauces on the plate that was used as decor - one was green, the other was yellow - I personally preferred the green sauce over the yellow. 

I didn't have enough room for dessert because I had stuffed my face with the appetizers but I plan on trying one this weekend when I go again! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!!!!",sz6mhYqelucFzEATxsEuGQ,6,4,5,BGbKnOl0eZpRJpUyOxBNgA

The owner even came and talked to us for a bit and he used to work at Caesars palace at Nobu the very high class restaurant and he decided to open a restaurant with cheaper food than the strip of his own off the strip and I think that was a fantastic idea because us locals need some of this quality food too. If I could I would give this place 6 stars for how wonderful my dining experience was. Oh and to add they had beautiful interior design and their desserts were ON POINT.

Between the 2 nights, we had tacos, lettuce wraps (both the black cod and Chilean sea bass), rock shrimp, house salad, salmon on lotus chips, European sea bass, beef Tobanyaki, bone marrow, duck confit. chicken and beef kushi (yakitori-like mini skewers). For dessert, we had yuzu/orange sorbet (1st night) and coconut/lychee sorbet (2nd night.)  
Loved everything, with favorites being the chicken kushi (really tender and flavorful chicken with an amazing sesame dressing). European sea bass (so good we ate the bones which were fried and dramatically presented), bone marrow (with mouth-watering truffle butter), and duck confit (tender and delicious).  The salad dressing was awesome, and the sea bass had a sauce that nicely balanced the delicate fish.  Both sorbet desserts were outstanding.  
Chef Kevin (formerly at Nobu in Caesars) is talented and creative. As others had pointed out, the restaurant is in the process of getting a liquor license, but you can bring your own wine/sake.
Definitely 5 stars for the food.  I would also give 5 stars for the wait staff who were attentive and very welcoming.  
The only downside is that the ambiance is not exactly of a ""special occasion"" restaurant caliber even though the cuisine itself is very high caliber on both the quality of the ingredients and the chef's skills.  The place is in a strip mall southwest of the Strip.  Inside, you can see the ice machine and drinks refrigerator from the dining area.  Of course, you're not paying special-occasion restaurant prices either.  Their regular prices are very good compared to similar caliber food one can get on the Strip. The prices are downright fantastic during happy hours (from lunch time to 6p) and the late-night happy hours (approx. half off on select menu items.)

The tuna had amazing flavor, and was complimented by the light crispy texture of the shell.  The seaweed was plated like a work of art.  The beef was plated with two sauces, both complimenting it's flavor profile.

Hubby and I originally were supposed to go to the oyster bar for our post Valentine's date, but due to the long wait, we just decided to try something else. We checked yelp reviews for restaurants around our house, and saw the high ratings for Japoneira, so we decided to check this place out. I'm actually really glad we got the chance to come here as all the food we ordered were excellent, not to mention the great happy hour deals. 

We ordered a bunch of items from the happy hour menu, including the salmon and tuna tacos, rock shrimp, and the cod wrapped in lettuce. The tacos were great but quite generic with other fusion restaurants and their tacos, as mentioned in another review, nevertheless still quite good. The rock shrimp was yummy, crispy on the outside embellished in great tasting sauce. The cod was to die for~ it was so good that we just had to order the regular sized cod from the dinner/main menu. We also ordered the salmon ceviche that tasted like the salmon inside the taco, oysters which tasted really good considering I'm not really an oyster fan, and also the foie gras mini blinis. My husband, who had bad experience with foie gras, really liked this dish as it was buttery and the sauce drizzled over it paired really well. Lastly, we ordered the japoneira fried rice and, as I mentioned above, the cod. I just have to say it again... I absolutely loved the fish! My mouth is watering just thinking about it!!! 

The service was exceptional. Our server was very friendly and accommodating, and explained each dish to us at it came out. Too bad we didn't catch her name though, but for sure we'll see her again next time we go. All in all, great service, excellent food, awesome experience.

Staff is incredible! I have as of yet dined anywhere in Las Vegas were servers a re truly passionate, incredibly knowledgable, and so incredibly kind! Excellent direction in navigating the menu to find what you'll like along with perfectly timed dishes. They are so helpful and approachable!

The owner came out often to talk to tables ensuring they enjoyed their experience, as well as chat and answer any questions first time diners might have. He was so nice and gave me suggestions of specials that they would have in the future he thought I would enjoyed. He extra effort added to the experience.

Now onto the good stuff... The food!!! Everything was beyond expectations. I had the  uni sampler, which consisted of a tasting of uni from Santa Barbara, Catalina Island, and imported from Japan. They were served on spoons with seaweed and ikura. The seaweed gave great texture against the soft uni and the brininess of the seaweed and ikura paired perfectly with the soft sweet uni.

I also had the seared scallops and foie gras. I swear if I had been standing my knees would have given out. It was the most spectacular bites I've had in quite some time.

I also had their baby octopus with miso and once again if you are a fan of octopus, you'll love this dish.

Right now it's BYOB so I suggest bringing your favorite ""inebriator"", a couple friends, settle in and share a little bit of everything. Also they have double happy hour and early and late.

I came here on Thursday night and it was completely empty. The ambience was not what I excepted. It's very small and narrow and the decor needs a little change. 

There's only two sides on the menu. I just went with the cod wrap, salmon taco, tuna taco, and udon fried noodles, and rock shrimp with the check in offer.

The cod wrap was good but not memorable. The tacos were also good but very very tiny. I do have to admit that the shell they used for the tacos were addicting to eat. The udon fried noodles were surprisingly amazing to me! It had very good flavor and the noodles were cooked perfectly al dente. 

The service was awkward from beginning to start. I wish I can explain but it was that awkward.

2153252,2018-02-13,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Gem!! Love this place! I wandered in one evening on a whim and I'm so glad I did. 

First visit, I had the NY Strip with Foie Gras. It was drizzled with a heavenly sauce that was similar to teriyaki, but there was something about it that was different than I'd ever tasted. Can't put my finger on it. But I LOVE when I get to taste flavors that I have never experienced. The steak was cooked perfectly, was beautifully presented, and the service was excellent. 

A couple days later I couldn't wait to go back, so I brought my hubby. We shared a few small plates: scallop w/foie, salmon lotus chip, gyoza, and truffle edemame. For my entree, I chose the filet with truffle bone marrow, my hubby chose the NY steak Tobanyaki. The scallop w/foie was insanely good and a must-have if you enjoy seafood. And as funny as it sounds, the edamame was quite delicious. Not your typical steamed flavorless starter. Hubby's entree was delightful, served on a sizzling platter. Personally, I preferred the other preparation (I'm less of a sauce person) but it was very similar. The truffle bone marrow filet was incredible. I'm not much of a filet person (too lean) but it was actually a nice balance between that and the marrow. Everything about this dish was wonderful. Another dish I must mention is the Nigerian prawn sigh uni butter. Do not pass this one up!

The format of the menu is basically a list of the names of the dishes with no explanation or description, so it can be a little confusing. Don't be afraid to ask the awesome servers to explain it to you. They're very helpful and lead me in the right direction.",7AKWPQLa4QxKOVE_FBRtUA,1,0,5,RjJDl5f9UeM2GoJaGuWK_w

We got to the restaurant and were handed different menus and realized that the first result on google I clicked on was for a restaurant in Texas with the same name. After looking at their menu we weren't really sure about eating here because we're not the most adventurous eaters and the menu had some very interesting and unique items. We wanted to give it a shot so we ordered a seaweed salad and a steak qyoza. The gyoza were quite possibly the most flavorful and delicious gyoza I've ever had and we could not believe how amazing they were. We ended up ordering a second order of gyoza because they were so amazing. I wish we were brave enough to step out of our comfort zone and try some of there other menu items but at least we now know where to get the best gyoza in town.

2360882,2014-11-25,9,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Have you ever been to a restaurant where you ordered a light meal thinking that was going to be enough but after you ate your food it was a battle for you to say no more, cause the food you ate was just delicious? Well that's what exactly happened to me today. I wasn't hungry, just killing time, and Japaniero was just there. I ordered a few of their apps and after eating most of it the battle happen. You can say I'm writing a review a little prematurely. The 4 star that I gave could possibly be higher, after I have more of the food which I'm pretty sure will happen in the next couple of days. Expect an update soon and more pictures.

The #1 thing that got me, before I even ate anything, was their customer service. I just left my car and was walking to the building when I was already being welcomed by one of the girls who worked there, I was probably just lucky since it seemed like the only business in that building and I was walking towards her. Once inside everyone, which included one of the chefs, was very nice and friendly, asked how I heard about them, recommended items, briefly conversed with me while I was there. They all even stopped what they were doing and said thank you as I left. They seemed genuinely appreciative of me being there. 

So as it goes for food I ordered only a few items, all which were from their Happy Hours menu. I believe Happy Hours runs 12:30pm-6pm and 10pm-midnight Mondays-Fridays and 2pm-6pm Saturday-Sunday, which are pretty sweet.  Went with a beef taco, an order of black cod butter lettuce wrap, and an order of tuna lotus chips. Each item was reexplained as it was brought out but I don't remember the whole details because I was enjoying and savoring the item that came out before. They were small in size but everything was delicious.

The rest of the menu sounds delicious, look at the pictures posted. Also check the chef special menu http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/japaneiro-asian-infusion-restaurant-las-vegas?select=02DBC79VhN80Y-RRzyh3BA#02DBC79VhN80Y-RRzyh3BA There was mention of dessert by the server, a milk tea ice cream and a green tea creme brulee, need to try those.

The chefs of the restaurant get their supplies every morning and their menu and specials change everyday according to whatever they buy that day. You can have something completely different one meal and the next time you're back, they can have a different menu! I love places like these because you know that you are getting something fresh and different every time. 

The chefs of this place used to work for Nobu so do not expect anything mediocre. You are getting Las Vegas Strip quality of food, but at a local price with no hassle of going to the Strip. This restaurant is brand new, but for how it is going so far, this restaurant is only going to go far! Everything is amazing and this has to be my new favorite modern Japanese spot off the strip!

Ambience:
The moment you walk in, you are greeted kindly by servers. The restaurant is small, but it is very intimate and romantic. The designs are simple, but elegant and they have a chalkboard where they write their specials that day.

Service:
Yet again, LAS VEGAS STRIP QUALITY! The servers may be young, but they are energetic and they know what they are doing. The chefs and owners come out and talks to you. How often do you get that from chefs? They care about what you think of the food and your experience so far.

Food:

Tuna, Salmon & Beef Tacos
Potstickers
Sugar Daddy soft shell crab

Foie Gras 
Green Tea Tiramisu
Home-made black sesame ice-cream
Fried banana 
Green tea is BOMB! They use the highest quality of green tea straight from Japan!

2410988,2017-12-29,2,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"I've literally eaten the entire menu.  This is my favorite place in Vegas. I have gone very often since this place has opened.  There are so many foods that I will only eat here. As for people who don't understand why some of the plates are so small, I feel that we need to keep in what this restaurant is know that it is possible to get complete full there and not break the bank.  To keep this review from being incredibly log with detailing out each dish I've had and what it is and what I think.  I'll just hit the highlights.

-Japanese Teramoto Scallop: Get this one.  Just cough up the extra few bucks for the this one instead of the Hokkaido scallop.  Yes, you can taste the difference. Get a side of rice.  Dump the left over sauce on the rice. Smile and enjoy your life.

-Rock Shrimp: This has actually gotten smaller from the original portion size back when he first opened. I'm fine with that. It was very large for an appetizer; now, it seems about right.

-Bone Marrow Filet: The dish that holds the distinction as something that made me stop and phone a friend to tell them how good it is. It was originally on the specials board. Rightfully so, it has made it to the actual menu.  The new bone in filet is fantastic too! Very good quality.  I'm just a bit of a steak snob, so I will say there is better in Vegas.  For the price, it is a stand out.

-Scallop Foie Gras: It's the perfect bite to me. Point blank. Period. 

-French Escargot: If you've never had one, this is a great place and price to try one. I've had better in other places in town, but it is still solid here.

-Black Cod Butter Lettuce: Solid item. Crazy good for a happy hour dish.

-Gyoza: On the menu is the black Angus beef which is fantastic.  I believe there was a kobe beef one on the specials board a few year ago. Mind blowing!

-Yakisoba: It's really good here if you are trying to fill up and are a fried noodle kind of person.

-Tasting menus: I think there has been a 10, 5, and now 7.  If you want to check this place out, grab a friend and try this. Nigerian prawn and scallop ceviche typically make this menu.  Both are solid.  The marrow filet is also usually on here.

Other notes: If you are fan of Japanese beers, there is a decent selection here of stuff you would actually want to drink that is not widely available in town.  I've done the sake flight.  It was good, but I'm not a connoisseur. I feel like my opinion would be uninformed at best. The sparkling jelly sake was interesting in a good way. Also know the special board can change often. The hairy crab 3 ways is a great one if available.",PpaIA3DA_0Y_XpGHPxgjLg,3,2,5,6brQYPAju34hyzOIY3ZS2A

2424324,2017-05-18,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"I came here to celebrate graduation with my family and it was the first time I got to enjoy Japanese-Brazilian style food. The restaurant itself is nestled in a sleepy little plaza just off the highway to the southwest, so it had a rather humble appearance from the outside. The prices were amazing for the quality of food that we were getting, something that I became keenly aware of by the time the main entrees began to roll out.

My table ordered a whole collection of dishes that I had trouble recollecting all of them: lamb chops, sashimi plates, oysters, seaweed/house salads, fried rices, and yakisobas, I believe. They were all quite pleasant, and I had no complaints of their flavors (well, the lamb was a tiny bit dry), but I wanted to zoom in on two dishes that really ""did it"" for me.

I ordered the Alaskan black cod and it was my first time ordering this particular fish. It was a perfectly-cooked strip of fish served with a lotus chip, a nice little leaf garnish underneath, and a mizo glaze. When I took a bite, the meat was so delicate that it practically melted on my tongue and released all of the sweet, savory, almost buttery flavors of the miso it was cooked in. I ate the skin separately and it was even better, as it concentrated all of that sauce under a lightly crisped exterior.

At the end of our dinner, we were served a set of desserts, mostly different ice creams, and this curious yuzu-coconut mochi served on a little mound of green tea ice cream in a goblet-sized wooden spoon that, for whatever reason, absolutely amused my entire table; some of my family requested the owner's permission to take the spoons home (I don't get it either). The mochi was decidedly refreshing and, for me, a nice change of pace from the standard green tea and red bean mochis served at many Japanese-themed restaurants.

The real kicker had to be the tiramisu. I was not ready for it. I didn't realize that I've been having garbage tiramisu until this point. First off, the plating was charming. The tiramisu was a square-cut piece of heaven, with a little pink flower and a leaf cutting on an angle into the cake adding a nice touch of aesthetic. I casually removed the aesthetics and took a bite. The cream was rich and wholesome, pleasant in the way it coats your mouth, but not in such a way that was overwhelming. I could catch the sponginess of the underlying biscuit and the coffee was ""just"" right, strong enough to wake you up like it was morning again, but not enough to overpower all the other flavors present in the dish. I don't care if I sound like I'm overselling this thing, it was freakin' delicious. I wanted seconds and thirds, my wallet be damned.

The owner was extremely attentive and accommodating to our table. Orders came out in a timely fashion and he had the kind of attitude that made it really easy for my table to engage him in conversation as the last bits of sunlight were going back behind the mountains. Initially, my dad had been wary about going to restaurants that serve food in this style, but I'm very happy with the earnest and welcoming attitude of the owner as he conversed with him. The owner even went out of his way to provide us sample plates of some of his dishes to try out, such as these cuts of seared NY strip that were tender and downright juicy. Throughout the dinner, I felt quite welcome and comfortable thanks in major part to the owner, and for that, I appreciate that he put such a good impression forward that made my dad warm up to this style of eating.

If I had any nitpick about the restaurant overall in this review, it was that my family and I expressed some discomfort over the broken A/C unit, which made our dining experience a bit warmer than we would prefer. This might be problematic for any future diners coming in about a month from this review. However, this was a minor problem at best in early May.

To the owner, thank you for making my graduation dinner such a pleasant experience for both my family, friends, and I. I look forward to my next visit.",zWl3tG_BZ50r6yfD2hJdkA,0,0,5,WalpDMon1deHMvbqhfBsmw

Nigerian Prawns with Yuzu Cilantro!... 
Bone Marrow with Truffle Butter!...

Japaneiro Asian Infusion Restaurant is what you get when a couple of Chefs at Nobu (Kevin & Michael) decide to open up their own place. The menu is saturated with high quality products that are out of the price range of your typical Southwest Las Vegas neighborhood restaurant, but less than the ""Strip-prices"" where these products are so often found. As expected, there are several items similar to Nobu dishes on the menu.  It is also evident that Kevin & Michael have a fondness for Uni, Truffle Butter, & Yuzu, as these options come up a lot between the menu and the Board Specials.

A great intro can be had during Happy Hour from 4pm-6pm (M-F) and again from 10pm-12am (M-F). My favorites from the Happy Hour menu are the Sea Bass & Black Cod Butter Lettuce Wraps. You can also find Tuna, Salmon & Beef Tacos, the same Tuna & Salmon prepared on a thin slice of Lotus Root, flavorful Chicken Kushiyaki, quality Gyoza with Angus Beef, and a couple other items to round out the Happy Hour menu.

One of the highlights of Japaneiro is the Specials Board. We came in twice in two different weeks, and saw several interesting items...wished we had come in with friends to taste more! The Uni Chawamushi was amazing and the Nigerian Prawns were a sight to see! We ordered the later with Truffle Butter that was aromatically spectacular! ...also spotted Soft-Shell Crab and Whole Maine Lobster on the Board in addition to other attention-grabbing items.

The interior is just as awkward as it was when it was Volcano Grill. That's a shame considering you are likely to spend ~ $50 per person...and that's a bit unique in this neighborhood. Even more than other places, Japaneiro will live or die on their food alone. I am certainly glad to have this type of an option in Southwest Las Vegas and hope it does well enough to stay open. I'd love to stop in every couple months.

Come in for unique food options!
Come in for good eats!
Come in for high quality proteins!
Come in if you love uni!...pretty sure they'll put it on anything for you and it's already an option for 1/3 of the menu!
Don't come in for a romantic setting...
Dessert?...well. let's say, it's not their forte.",A5A34ixb-yy6nwL42iZsnw,26,28,4,V0ssRvE95Pa3wFnI1azG7A

Thanks to the chef for our complimentary truffle edamame. He probably heard us say how hungry we were because he knew it'd take a long time. I would have ordered appetizers, but we really didn't know it would take so long for our dishes to be done. The truffle edamame were really good. Better than your average. 

My hubs and I shared the 24oz bone in ribeye with 7 special salts and a yuzu truffle dip. We asked for Medium, but it came to use Medium rare. We didn't complain because omg we were starving and it took a long time for this to get to us. The flavor of the beef was ok. For a $65 steak, I usually expect flavor without having to use sauces, dips (or 7 salts). It was good with the dip and salts though.

We also shared a Nigerian Prawn w/ some kind of truffle flavor. This cost $26. That was pretty good. We each also got our own bowls of the Japaneiro Special fried rice $6/bowl. That was really, really good. Staff and service was great despite the wait. We'll be returning for more.",LgFDWZTLi1w9OGi5BtKORg,1,1,4,8lXEKzdxTkfwIr8a4hj15w
2536146,2016-03-08,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"My siblings and I wanted to find some places we haven't tried yet for dinner last night and was looking on the Internet for unique places in Vegas we can try. I ran across pictures of Japaneiro on Instagram and was sold. 

For 70% of restaurants in today's age and our culture of today who love taking pictures of everything we eat, most pictures interpret the flavor of the picture they represent. THAT IS NOT THE CASE AT ALL AT JAPANEIRO. Everything we had a Japaneiro seemed to have a burst of great flavor and new surprises as you kept eating. 

My favorite of the appetizers was the Tuna lotus wraps, which I highly recommend if you're going to Japaneiro. I'm not usually a black cod fan but the way it was prepared last night had me thinking why I don't eat black cod more. The angus beef gyoza was made from scratch in house had us wanting more of them ! But we resisted because we needed to save room for the main courses. We had the Australian lamb chops, truffle marrow filet and the NY strip foie gras. Each of the main dishes we had came highly recommended by our server Lolo, I can't really describe the dishes in no other way than to just let the pictures speak for themselves (how ironic since I started this review with a rant on pictures not matching taste and flavor) she was very knowledgeable of the menu and guided us through the menu really well like a good server should. 

Throughout the meal we were asking Lolo if chef Chong had any plans for opening up a new location or moving his establishment closer to toward the Henderson/Green Valley area so we wouldn't have to drive so far anymore for his incredible dishes. We did not get a definitive answer but the thought of them thinking about it will have us praying that they do open a new establishment. We will definitely be back for more !

2637022,2016-02-07,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"We found this place thanks to Yelp on a visit to Vegas a few weeks ago.  We went later in the day and I thought we were lost in the boonies with all the road construction and what looked like abandoned strip malls.  Turned into a small center with a Bruddahs restaurant facing the street.

On entering it looks like a hallway of a restaurant, albeit a warm, cozy, well designed hallway.

I ordered an iced tea and got what looked like cloudy water.  Turns out it was rice tea.  If you know the sweet rice tea at the end of Korean meals, that's what this is minus the sugar, cinnamon and actual bits of rice floating in it.  Taste was not bad at all, just not what I expected.

Service was fast, informative and friendly.  I was tempted to try some of the more exotic (read: expensive) specials, but we just got to Vegas and I didn't hit Megabucks yet.  So we ordered the rock shrimp to start and I got the chawanmushi and Japaniero Special Yakisoba Udon.

The rock shrimp was outstanding!  Reminded me of honey walnut shrimp at Chinese restaurants, but this was so succulent with a little crunch.  Taste was perfect.  I could eat a heaping plate by myself.

The chawanmushi came out with dried seaweed sprinkles on the top.  The sprinkles were like concentrated ocean and a little distracting, but the chawanmushi itself was beautiful.  So creamy and flavorful and seemed to melt on the tongue.

The Yakisoba udon was the best Yakisoba I've ever had.  Even the squash blossom purée, which I thought was odd, worked well.  A couple friends got the regular noodles, but I felt the udon noodles really complemented the flavors more and gave a better chew to the dish.  I savored the last few bites.

The only reason I didn't give a 5 was that it was a little pricey for the portions.  But that's it.  Everything else was wonderful.  It was an unexpected gem on our first night in Vegas and worth the drive from the Strip.  I will definitely make an effort to go back next time.",6yRNYTnvV1jIG88RWdeMAg,0,0,4,lCNLeOVAbtg_LoPqLmD6hw

The food itself was wonderful! My wife had the seafood udon (not on the menu, but the server suggested it after speaking to my wife). It has a miso soup base with plenty of shrimp, sea bass, scallops. I had the steak and foie gras which was simply fabulous! The foie gras was as good as most any you get in France!

It is a simple decorated restaurant in a hidden part of town, but it was worth the trip as I was fairly impressed by their dishes! 

They have a good variety from affordable snacks to exotic upscale dining experience. I started with some tacos, Rock Shrimp(Must have!), black cod Butter Lettuce Wrap(my fav!), then I ordered the NY Strip as my main course. In a small humbled restaurant like this, I wasn't expecting a beautifully presented dish as if I'm dining on the strip. Every dishes was described in details by the waitress. The chef's passion and dedication for top notch food were well presented by the food itself. I was very satisfied, indeed. 

Highly recommended and don't forget to check out the SPECIFIC BOARD(off menu), be ready to try out some baby octopus, Escargot, Foie Gras, TRUFFLE BONE MARROW(TheBOMB)! If you are a seafood person, don't fret none, cz they have it all! NIGERIAN PRAWN, Salmon Belly Ceviche, and Uni!! They have Santa Barbara Uni, Catalina Uni, to Japanese Uni is the best! 

 Whenever your up for a quick and simple meal but delicious? Go for their happy hour menu! It's the HIT! 
In the whole, this place is different, Chef with immense Passion and reasonable prices! No other place like this in town so far! Definitely don't miss out!! Get your stomach ready for some FOOD ADVENTURE

2887694,2014-12-29,5,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Following one of my favorite Yelpers review (shout out to Philly T!)  I stepped in for a quick bite the day we had a sitter for the evening.  Starved from luxurious cuisine for about a month I could not have been more excited to find Japaneiro to be the perfect amount of silver spoon in a strip mall.  The chefs are as magical as unicorns.  To find this caliber of skill in each plate offered at the most nominal of ranges is evident that the owners are either well trained chefs who love what they do, or are quite too humble for their own good.  

Japanese-French fusion has been happening for quite some time.  Japaneiro takes this genre of cuisine much more seriously.  Sure one could state that the location isn't quite Las Vegas Blvd.  Then again if you are that type of person, you still are only 7 or so miles away if you need something fancy to look at.  I based this review mainly on the dishes served.  Also upon entrance we were greeted warmly by the staff and chef was also very welcoming throughout.  There is not a lot of seating by normal standards.  Which just makes things more intimate.

""The Board"" was our menu that day.  We started with the Bone Marrow with Truffle Butter & wonton chips.  This was a most filling and decadent bone.  It could not have been more rich or warming for the season.  I found the broiled gelatinous goodness to be expertly timed and not losing much of it's substance or flavor as I've tried elsewhere.  The truffle flavor incorporates subtly with the entire entree and the light crisp of the wonton was a perfect binder.  5/5

Seared Scallops with Uni.  How could I explain this differently from the other times I have tried this combination?  Well, this time it was done right.  Large sweet snappy scallop subdued and surrendering oceanic sweet uni flavor deeper into each bite.  The warmth of the slightly seared scallop combined with a cool seaweed salad spoonful underneath it all.  Okay.  That basically explains it.  Next time I'm ordering 4 of these to myself.  5/5

Uni Chawamushi with Ikura.  A new adventure for me!  Strange are the ways that the honorable sea urchin has been mixed into cuisine.  This was certainly a change of pace for my Uni addiction.  Dig into the custard and divulge some uni and a few pops of roe on to your spoon.  The softness of custard gives uni a place to mingle and the salty Ikura contrasts the situation.  I need to study this Chawamushi dish further before I can give a premature rating.  I do know I love uni and ikura thats for sure!

Now for the Foie Gras.  I wish I could remember what exactly was in those sauces!  I really do because I am known to keep Foie stocked in my house and every month or so I have a break from my seafood diet and sear up a slice.  I realize that there is no way I could possibly replicate Japaneiro's version, yet still.  A thick sauce of a very umami tart miso-like consistency was cooked on top and a light and bright sauce was set aside that had a hint of acidity.  Appropriate.  5/5

Ny Steak with mustard and truffle sauce.  Ny is a perfect cut for medium rare.  I don't have beef very often but I had to try this.  Tender pre cut and organised beautifully.  Take a slice and dab onto the mustard then dip it into the truffle buttered sauce and take a bite.  Devoured this lovely slab of beef in record time.  5/5

Don't be put off by what surrounds the table.  Take a bite and close your eyes.  These plates hold exquisite quality and the value is the only thing at a premium.  You see my star rating.  I will be watching Japaneiro very closely.",ZngF2uBYrqyFjXd6LvuluQ,11,8,5,3p2XX3lfKPKtYWCopERzzw

My favorite was the scallop teramoto and the chawamushi. It's hard to find quality chawamushi and this place has the best I've had in the Vegas. Definitely want to try the uni chawamushi next time. 

The service was nothing spectacular. Our server just took our order and brought us our food. Left us alone for most of the time, which isn't a bad thing. 

I wonder why they didn't have a lot of customers. Maybe it was the time of day we went or the location. It's located in a small complex with about one other store open nearby. There was a pretty decent sized parking lot with only a few cars parked. So I guess there's never a problem with parking. 

The only complaint I would have, is that the beef in the fried rice was hard and was not seasoned. So that was a bummer. But even though the food portions were pretty small, it was able to fill us up pretty quickly.",u10yZbzBHkG-toqxGy9RqQ,2,0,5,Jq4uNwJTYicyPoEaLayT3w
2978953,2015-08-01,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"A sure fire disappointment. We came here on a Friday evening for dinner thanks to the great yelp reviews and I must say, it was a disappointment. I liked the fact that you can bring your own booze/liquor but I realized that was the case due to the fact that they don't have a liquor license as yet. The restaurant is HOT. I'm not sure if it's because of the open kitchen or because they don't have air conditioning, but dress light! 

Let's start out with our server. He seemed really knowledgable about the items served at the restaurant. But when I asked him for suggestions, he advised me to look away from the menu and into their specials board. He said himself that people don't come in and order off the menu. They come in for what they have on their specials board. So right off the bat, I didn't like the fact that he essentially said nothing on the menu was great and I should stick with specials. Either way, there were some staples on the menu that sounded like must haves. Rock shrimp tempura, tacos, yakisoba, salmon/tuna chips. Unfortunately, I felt everything was just eh. 

Rock shrimp-bland. Needed sriracha to actually have some flavor. 
Tacos-very bland. I was almost embarrassed asking for soy sauce. But it wasn't just me, my whole table asked me to pass some down. 
Yakisoba-Decent. But on the sweeter side. The flavor wasn't something I'd come back for. 
Salmon/Tuna chips-Fishy and missing basic seasoning. 

We all left full, and unlike others, I didn't think the prices were unreasonable. I think they were fair. But I just feel that this restaurant has so much potential, but was a big let down in their fish quality, flavors, and overall experience.

Angus Beef Gyoza: This is one great tasting dish! The beef was really flavorful that every bite made me went, ""Hmmm."" It is easy to overcook beef specially if you try to fry it but the chef cooked it so perfectly. My only concern was since the beef was a little fatty, it was a little bit oily/greasy. Still it was very good.

Rock Shrimp: We ordered this as an appetizer. It reminded me of the ""Bang Bang"" shrimp from Bonefish but instead of the sweet spicy sauce, it was in a Yuzu sauce that was tangy and spicy. Delicious! I fell in love with every bite. 

Chilean Sea Bass: This dish was listed under the Chef's Specialty part of the menu. It came with a cilantro sauce that paired perfectly with the fish. It was pan-fried to perfection giving it that crispy bite. Highly recommended. 

Scottish Salmon: This dish was also from the Chef's Specialty menu. The salmon was pan-fried to your preference. I always get mine medium/medium well. Like a perfect steak, do not get your fish well done. It really is a waste. The flavor was spot on good. It tasted like teriyaki with a hint of yuzu. It came with a house salad and the sauce they used for that you can dip your fish in to give it that extra ump. 

Yuzu Coconut Mochi with Genmai Cha Ice Cream: What better way to end a perfect dinner but with a perfect dessert. The mochi was the best one I've tasted so far. It is not frozen so it was soft and chewy. The ice cream totally hit the spot for me. I love Genmai Cha as a tea but for it to an ice cream flavor, it was heaven on earth. 

The chef's cooking skills are phenomenal. Every dish that came out that that kitchen was a work of art. Next time I come here, I will try and catch their happy hour. I heard a lot of good things about it. A good way to sample a lot of the items on their menu.",F1_WWxCjdHhMKBjPS9ljvQ,1,2,4,Whzba4-W5Sk7UDChsu5zqQ

I recommend checking out the specials on the black board upon entry, currently the Salmon Ceviche is my go to alone with BOTH Butter Lettuce Wraps. (Black cod & Chillean Seabass)

This fusion for a foodie, tickled my fancy - I love to try new cuisine. japañeiro is unique and will come back to try the rest of the menu and chef's specials. Menu  includes Foie gras, bone marrow, surf & turf, and Chilean sea bass for example. Dishes start at $4-$6 starters to $15-$41 chef specials. Portions mirror fine dining or tapas. The dishes I had fulfilled me just right. 

I am a pescatarian and from Hawaii ... enjoyed the salmon tacos, lotus chip ahi (tuna), and rock shrimp. The Chawanmushi with Uni and salmon roe was a chef's special and something I haven't had before. Interesting fusion of miso and my fave ingredients on their own (uni, salmon roe) in porridge form. Not for every palette. It was good but not something to add to my must have list. Perhaps some sriracha and warm sake would have changed my mind lol

Wish they had more vegetarian selections, however, as I look for these options every where I eat. No tofu?

My dates had the fried rice, udon special, and black cod. Delicious. 

I spent $30. About $85 for a party of 3. Look out for specials on the blackboard that's not on the menu.

They are close to the Arroyo shopping center on Warm Springs off of Rainbow. The restaurant is fairly new to the southern location- nice to see a restaurant like this in my neighborhood. 

4 stars if they had drinks and vegetarian options. But They will have a selection of drinks soon (beer, wine, sake).  Water glasses I'd suggest that they use taller ones.

Ambience:  The playlist playing I feel should be toned down by volume and the sappy Disney related selections.  Some chill, acoustic sounds preferably for example.  We were sitting right under the flatscreen tv and it was fairly loud.",PiDPwcqd01Wt07dEQIG1kg,0,1,3,zuzssGl06HAJdKafNCwMvw

We ordered:
1 Tuna Tacos (1 order = 2 tacos)
1 Salmon Tacos
1 Chawamushi
1 Salad w/sesame dressing and tobiko flakes
1 House fried rice
1 Truffle Bone Marrow

Everything was really good. We didn't order any entrees, which were def on the more expensive side. Everything we ordered above was very reasonably priced and made for a great meal. 

We both agreed that the Tuna taco was better then the Salmon. The flavors in the tuna taco were nice and simple. The salmon had too many things going on and the flavors kind of all got lost. 

The Salad was better then I was expecting it to be. The dressing was great, not too heavily dressed and the tobiko flakes were a nice texture. 

My favorite item of the night, the Chawamushi! We didn't get it with the roe and uni, as I wasn't sure if my dining partner was adventurous enough to appreciate. I didn't regret the plain Chawamushi at all! It was fantastic. I've been craving this since last eating it here.  And very cheap! 

I wasn't a huge fan of the Fried Rice as my dining partner described it as greasy, but she liked that. I didn't so much. But also another cheap dish. 

Truffle Bone Marrow was damn good. Although not sure I would order again, but happy I tried it here. 

By making a meal of the small plates we had a great dining experience at a reasonable price. I would definitely go back and eat this way again and try some of the other small plates...",OD6wbZ1jQOW30wYCDD6X3Q,4,2,4,6zcSFP5nNsaGPOtmlTxUcw

They are located off Warm Sprogs in a half empty min mall.   The mini mall is new and I would assume new residents will be filling it up by the summer.   One thing that stood out was the smell of sewage which is a concern.  Of they already have a drainage problem and the mini mall is half full what will happen when it is full.  
   Our server was very good and knew the menu like the back of her hand.  She explained the specials and other items in perfect detail.   I am impressed when they truly know the menu and you can tell they tried the items they are discussing.  
   We had the chicken and beef kushi which was on the dry side and very bland tasting.  The tacos my daughter had were OK but nothing special.  The Black Angus Gyoza was a real let down.  There was no real flavor to the inside and the meat was overcooked and there were pieces of hard grizzle in everyone of the Gyoza.  I would not order this again.  The tuna lotus chips were good and everyone enjoyed them.  The fish was fresh tasting and they were lightly spiced to enhance the flavor.  We finished off with a shared dessert of fried bananas with the tea ice cream.  This was well prepared and delicious.

.
** 2017 Yelp 100 Challenge #10**
.
This is what you literally call a hole in the wall restaurant in the middle of no where.... there are only maybe 6 tables inside & you could see the kitchen the moment you walk in. If you were to picture it empty you would think it was a take out joint. Nice thing is that each table is separated by long tall sticks so it's nice to not bump chairs w/ the person behind you.
.
The couple of times we went the owner & chef himself took care of us which was nice because he was able to recommend different things on the menu. Then the last time we went there was a waitress that took care of us & she was o so SWEET & quick as possible even though she had a full house & patio.
.
We ate every single item on the HAPPY HOUR menu 
Favorites:
 - Rock Shrimp w/ yuzu creme spicy sauce $5.5
 - Shrimp Kushi w/ a citrus spicy butter sauce $3.5 
 - Gyoza 2 pieces home made from certified Angus beef $2.5
 - Hokkaido scallop sashimi w/ jalapeno yuzu soy $12.5
 
Everything else was just OK but our least favorite was the LOTUS chips which were Salmon. Tuna. Scallop & they just shocked us since it said YUZU SPICY MISO but it was just PURE SWEETNESS that overpowered it & we had to force ourselves to eat the FOUR piece that came w/ each order!! O__o it was very hard to eat but we just swallowed & washed it down w/ our beer. 
.
TRUFFLE BONE MARROW W/FILET $38 (don't quote me on the price I lost my receipt picture) this was an AMAZING dish w/ the yuzu sesame sauce that came on the side to dip it with!!!!!! I just crave that DERICIOUSNESS & we devoured & sucked in the bone like a cave woman. The FILET was a perfect medium too!!

Banana harumaki w/ hojicha ice cream was the best out of all the desserts!! $10.00 LOVE the hojicha ice cream",x-8ZMKKNycT3782Kqf9loA,6,4,4,QpITprHJKk8hNht5dIdCDw

No liquor license yet, but you can bring your own..  server said they're in process and should have it soon.  A little bit of sake would have been the perfect compliment to my meal...looking forward to when I'm able to partake.

I love foie gras, and I'm really picky with how it's made, and they did a really great job with the flavor.  Great combination to put the foie gras over NY Steak.  The NY Steak was also fantastic!  Juicy, tender, and perfect.  

The truffle bone marrow was filled with flavor, but I wish they had bigger servings of it.  

We shared all the dishes since it's tapas style, and we left comfortably full.  

The deserts were awesome too.  Mango Cheesecake and the Banana Harumaki with milk tea ice cream.

This hidden gem is parked away on a small street in a corner plaza. Even though the rave reviews and large sign show off the restaurant there is never a wait time. The restaurant itself though is quite small with limited seating.

Japaneiro primarily focuses on French and Japanese food, however most of their items do fall under the Japanese category. They have a variety of options with both a daily menu and a set one.

The Japanese options are very thorough, with seasonal fish, selections of sashimi, even tobanyaki. Meanwhile their French fusion is a little more limited (Yes they have escargot).

I have been here multiple times and have tried most of their menu. While the flavors they capture are excellent, the price will add up quickly on you. The unagi and the New York Tobanyaki are two of the main courses I preferred with Rock shrimp probably being the best appetizer. If you enjoy bone marrow, they also offer it.

Great things- The service. Fantastic service. Our server Rusty was attentive and descriptive about every item down to the ingredients and flavor profile. I was impressed. Even the manager came out and asked us how everything was and welcomed us back. 

The atmosphere is casual and intimate. Great food without the ""frills"" kind of experience.

Must try: 
TRUFFLE EDAMAME! They ran out last night and only had a handful of it left. (Not surprised, it's delicious!) Rusty still brought the item out but didn't charge us because the half order size. I'm so glad he did because this item is going to keep me coming back to Japaneiro! 

Salmon w/ spinach (crispy or sautéed in a sweet chili sauce, so yummy)

Fried rice- simple but delicious. Loved the mushroom they add to it. 

I would have rated them 5 stars but there were a few flaws. There are a few items on their menu that I've enjoyed at other restaurants a lot more. (The NY strip steak was tough...the rock shrimp was too tangy...and the black cod was so tiny and the flavor was completely lost in the gigantic lettuce wrap). 

They're working on getting a liquor license so it's dry for now. BYOB (and a designated driver) ;))

To get foie gras and bone marrow right down the street is a dream come true. 
No need to fight The Strip traffic for quality Strip food. 

The chef is from Nobu and is very hospitable to clients right as you walk in. Reminds me of Chef John from Soho (right now the street). 

As soon as I saw Japaneiro food on my IG feed, I gathered few friends to sample the food. The more the merrier and the more food we can sample. 

I wish I wrote this as soon as I ate the food - we ordered SO much food and I wasn't even hungry - I could barely walk out of that place. I hope I'm able to write a decent review.

Beef gyoza - tasted fresh and homemade. I wish we ordered more (but, I'm glad I didn't cuz we have do much food coming!)

Pork belly - very clean, thick cuts or pork belly. Almost with they were caramelized like that of Goyemon. 

Seared tuna steak - extremely beautiful plating. Perfectly seared. 

Duo of uni and Ikura - pretty fresh uni and not too salty considering its topped with a large amount of ikura. 

Tuna on lotus root - this was a different way of eating tuna. Reminiscent of Soho's tostadas but, I love lotus root so, I'm more biased on that. 

Tacos - we got one of each taco. I love crunchy bite size mouthfuls :) I would recommend NO WASABI AIOLI tho. In my opinion, I think there was too much so, it over took the flavor of the fish. 

Baked cod in lettuce wrap - can never go wrong with this. Marinated cod went well with the lettuce and perfect bites of rich flavor. 

Bone marrow - dear lord, I could just eat that on rice but, it would be a crime against my body and healthy. So rich without the need of the salt and accoutrements it comes with. 

Foie gras - it's duck liver amazing butteriness. I wish it did come with a baguette or something to spread on cuz it's texturally hard for me to eat on its own. 

Lamb - three pieces of baby lamb (had to be baby cuz they were so small); perfect for eating like a caveman -- just hold onto the bone and chomp on! Do not expect large portions, as I did. 

Chilean sea bass - fairly large piece of goodness. Perfectly cooked and not rubbery and/or over done with sauce. 

Yakisoba - wasn't my favorite. I could've prolly been better without it and ordering something else (granted, we might have ordered the whole menu as it was). 

Green tea creme brûlée + matcha tiramisu + green tea ice cream + banana lumpia was my favorite part of dinner. Not cuz I like desert but more so cuz they were all rich with flavor that wasn't sweet and very neutral which I like more often than not. 


Service was very attentive. Too attentive at times but, they are a new restaurant trying to see what's a hit or miss with the patrons.

My noodle dish was overdone as well. I didn't send it back because I lost my appetite because of the heat. All of us were extremely disappointed with the food as well as temperature of the restaurant. 
Then when I was presented with the bill I was overcharged. I explained that I did not order this item to the server who did not speak English well. She called over the owner. He tells me that this is the price. I tried to explain  that the server quoted one price and now there's a $12 difference for two peoples orders. The owner  is an impossible person. He would not listen. The people in my party were uncomfortable so I just paid in full. I told him that the food/ service are terrible. He replied that other people don't think so.

The waiter took our order - truffle edamame, bone marrow, salmon, the salmon and tuna tacos, and other items that I did not try (but my family ate).

The food started coming out one by one - and when I say one by one, I really mean one by one. The edamame first - small portion and ok. Not worth $5. Then five minutes later, the tacos - too much wasabi and ok. Not worth $4 for two tacos. Then the bone marrow - oh so salty that I couldn't even eat it. I had to take it back! Obviously, not worth $17 - they didn't even ask me if I wanted anything else since I didn't like it. The salmon - it was good, but it was drenched in sauce which I am not a big fan of. 

Everyone was practically done eating - but there was one more entree we were waiting for and it was specifically for one person, my fiance. His came last - he had to eat his food uncomfortably while we sat and watched him since we were done eating. It practically took 20+ minutes from the first item was set on our table until he got his food.  That is ridiculous!

We didn't even see our waiter after he took our order, which annoyed me even more. We had to ask for our check from another employee. Overall, the flavor was not that great and the portions were so small that they were like appetizers! We actually left the restaurant hungry as hell that we were thinking of going somewhere else to eat! What a joke. 

Seriously, I was questioning if I just got punk'd. I think I did. Japaneiro, you're good - you punk'd me!",pwQ8E-hbDUJe3qtKt_IBBg,5,4,1,aOBIVdcZsGP4__e33heb9g

Service was really great when we first got in since there was only one other table seated. Once it got a little busier, our waitress seemed to get a little frazzled. Our waitress was friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu items though. They have a permanent menu that they give to you and their specials that constantly change, which is located on the wall which was really hard to see unless you got out of your seat. 

We ordered rock shrimp which said it had a creamy, yuzu spicy sauce. It was alright. The dish was more sour than anything else. We also got the salmon and tuna tacos. The fish seemed fresh but other than that, nothing really to rave about. For my main dish I ordered the NY steak tobanyaki, which comes with a side of white rice. The presentation was nice because it comes out on a sizzling plate and the waitress pours the sauce right in front of you to caramelize. The dish was good but tasted similar to teriyaki. 

Overall our experience was ok. I'm glad I tried it and the food selection is unique but I don't think I would come back.",TuoqT1x5SY6RvJ4LLGCKmQ,1,0,3,BxmQsX_AGds3JXTOudsP8g

However, the real fun comes from the seasonal specials. Seems like they have a ton of items that are only available as they have stock for them. They just got Salmon in stock last night, so the Salmon Belly Ceviche was super fresh and delicious. Also had the truffle bone marrow which is just as great as it sounds. They even gave us the bones to take home because it was my dog's birthday! So he signs off on this good review as well.

For dessert we had both the Egg Roll banana dessert with Milk Tea ice cream (some of the best ice cream) and the Mango cheesecake desert. Both were amazing. I am not a huge cheesecake fan, but the texture of this one was awesome. Also comes with a little kick of cayenne and honey on the side. The waitress was also telling us that the owner's wife makes gelato, but is currently on leave and will be back in 6 months. 

Overall, wait staff was super friendly and helpful offering up menu choices based on our tastes as well as providing us with a unique experience by thinking of my dog.

The interior looks like any other casual Japanese joint, but the food stands out. The dishes compare to some fine dining spots on The Strip, but without all the hoopla. The plating of each dish is exquisite as it is art. An ever changing chalkboard has daily specials from the chef. 

There are multiple small bites to choose from. Sharing is highly recommended. Start every meal off with an uni bite with ikura. The uni pairs with the roe to form a small taste of the ocean. The black cod lettuce wraps were little bites of heaven. But the best bite of the night was the mini foie gras blinis. The sauce on that foie was out-of-this-world good. Thank god for foie gras! 

Main courses included the sizzling filet mignon and shrimp toban yaki with asparagus and enoki mushrooms. The certified angus beef was perfectly cooked to a medium rare. The yakisoba special was a nice noodle dish, but nothing attention-grabbing. For dessert, get the banana harumaki (spring rolls) served with milk tea ice cream. The milk tea flavor was spot on.

The shopping center is literally empty with two other restaurants with chains and locks on the doors with another bar in the parking lot.  They don't serve alcohol and the decor was very univiting in my opinion.  There is bamboo shades separating the kitchen from the public with at least a dozen holes in the ceiling where they were trying to install them and obviously were too lazy to patch the holes.  I saw a spider web above our table on top of the light and the color scheme was confusing to me.  I do interior design for a living, so I just notice these things immediately.

The real reason for this review is the food and it didn't live up to the hype.  We had some appetizers and the tacos were some raw salmon sushi with goat cheese and it was just awful.  Some things just shouldn't be fused together...leave the tacos to the Mexican restaurants.  I also tried the shrimp and it was nasty as well.  I eventually had to order teriyaki chicken and that was okay, but anything else outside of normal was just not very good.

3970199,2015-07-27,11,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"I was surprised by how underwhelmed I left Japaneiro after having dinner with two friends.  The three of us ordered the following items:

Spicy rock shrimp
Japaneiro special fried rice
Baby octopus
Japaneiro uni chawanmushi
Truffled marrow filet
Nigerian prawn with spicy yuzu sauce
Nigerian prawn with truffle sauce
Nigerian prawn with uni
Tiramisu
Hojica nice cream
Yuzu coconut mochi with genmaicha ice cream
Banana harumaki

The standouts were the spicy rock shrimp, the truffled marrow filet, and the banana harumaki.  The spicy rock shrimp were very good and I could have gotten another order of them but it's not a dish you can't get other places.  The truffled marrow filet was quite good.  The marrow from the bone made the dish while rubbing the beef slices in the truffle sauce gave it some flavor.  The banana harumaki was a tasty bite of banana in a spring roll shaped to a point.  Delicate and nicely done.

The prawns were difficult to extricate from their shells.  While the meat was juicy, even three orders was very little food to split three ways with two prawns per order.  Of the three, the spicy yuzu sauce was the most flavorful.  I was not fond of the chawanmushi.  There were small pieces of uni in the custard that was watery.  

Service was good.  I got green iced tea and my dining mates stuck with water.  Our glasses were refilled throughout our approximately two hours there.  Presentation was very appealing.  The restaurant is quite small with perhaps 10 tables.  The music was on much too loud for the small space.  

Considering the meal came out to $60 per person before tax and tip, it was a pricey disappointment.  It's also in a location off the beaten path.  The meal was OK but it's not a place to which I'll return.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,18,14,3,qtX2e_blG6HEK1OfFjV3Iw
3977813,2015-04-18,7,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"I stopped by Japaneiro on a late night and we ordered a few items. I specifically ordered the sashimi lettuce wraps, but my friends ordered items such as the Lotus Tuna chips which they commented were quite good, Angus Beef Gyoza, Chicken and Beef Kuchi, and Banana and Milk Tea Ice Cream.

The sashimi lettuce wraps which were good and they came with a good amount of chopped tuna and came with a mild dressing and tasted good. The lettuce cup was fresh and crisp and I enjoyed the crunchy thin noodles a top that which provided nice texture. I thought two per order was quite minimal. 

I miso black good was pretty good, but the cod was a tad over cooked and a little dry. It's flavor was nice and a little more miso would of been nice. I did try a Angus Beef Gyoza which was okay. It was a lot of beef and it could of benefited from some scallions or leeks inside mixed with the beef to cut down on the plain beef flavor. Also, the beef could of used some seasoning. 

I tried a beef and chicken kuchi which were good. The meat was tender on both, but a nice sprinkling of coarse salt on both would of been nice. I thought the marinade they both spent the night in was quite mild and needed more levels of flavor. It was quite one dimensional. 

Service was very good. In fact our server was very attentive and was in very good spirits, and had a great personality. I wish I could remember her name. I all remember was that she had blond hair.

Regardless, everything we had was delicious, and we had just about everything. A few minor notes: the wasabi aioli overwhelmed the fish lettuce wraps and the taro chips with tuna and salmon were a bit salty.  I did not care for the mango cheesecake, mostly the texture. 

The miso black cod was stunning! The sizzling shrimp with caramelization onions, asparagus and enoki mushrooms in a sweet sauce was delectable and a value at $14 for 6 plump shrimp. The beef on everything from the skewers to tacos was tender and flavorful. We really enjoyed the gyoza; they were so beefy and interesting. Such a departure from the average light filling. This was like biting into a cheeseburger gyoza. Yum. The bone marrow was tasty but we agreed you need 4 people to share the decadent dish. Too much for 2.

The fusion menu is delicious, specifically the tacos and tostadas.
Service was super friendly, with the chef coming out to check on us, and the waitress putting on the Frozen soundtrack specifically because my daughters said they liked it.
They have a lunchtime happy hour, during which everything is on sale (I think that puts the tacos at $1.) Don't get too excited, though, because these tacos are literally one bite.

My main gripes:
First of all, location is ok - southwest vegas - but it's in a random strip mall that is totally dead. Not too cool.
Second of all, it's not exactly a lunch spot. The menu is pretty fancy and although the prices are good for this fancy-ness, they're definitely not cheap.
However, it's not quite a dinner spot yet, either, since they don't have a liquor license! (I was there about a month ago, so maybe this has changed).

4085537,2015-07-30,2,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"After seeing this featured in the Weekly, decided to check it out. I really loved this place. 

It's located kind of in the middle of nowhere and the place is small. The upside is that it's intimate. 

Started off with salmon belly ceviche with wonton chips. This is like the fancy man's salsa and chips. It was so fresh and they pour on the salmon belly. The truffle bone marrow was great as well. The rich fat of the marrow went well with the garlic. They even gave us three bones (instead I'm f the normal two) as they said the bones on their batch that day were a little smaller. The Uni bite was delicious at first bite but, as with urchin, you get that nice low tide aftertaste. I was happy the first bite was good. 

If those items are a little much for you, their Japaniero fried rice is delicious without being weighed down by a ton of grease. What makes it special? I can never say. 

Okay it's because it has chicken, beef, and shrimp. 

For dessert, I inquired about the banana harumaki. It's fried banana wrapped in dough served with mango sauce and sprinkles of cayenne pepper. Of course I got that! Loved the warmth of the banana, the crispiness of the dough with the sweetness of the mango sauce finished off with a touch of heat from the pepper. It was a great way to end the meal. 

What I particularly loved about the place was the service. The servers were knowledgeable, they explained the menu well and could explain the dishes when they came out. Sounds like a little thing but I've been to plenty of places where the servers didn't know half of the menu. Even the chef came out to check out how we were doing. Love those little touches. 

It's a bit of a shame it is out in the middle of nowhere. They have happy hour and reverse happy hour menus which looked great. Going to have to trek down there one day to experience it.",y1b_9KmwNUWG1AS3CazFLA,5,3,5,wOWA-epL_2ktkUOYDI4CVA

What we ordered: 

Chawan Mushi - Not steamed in the typical cup-size, but rather a wider, slightly shallow dish. Also, their version did not have any meats or veges in the custard. Regardless of the variations, I enjoyed the creamy texture of the custard and the flavor. I did not miss the meat and veges, and liked the fine slivers of pepper garnish as the added texture and flavor. 

Beef Gyoza - 
I'm still undecided about this dish. I know the gyoza were made with good quality Angus beef, but I'm not sure I am ok that the beef was cooked medium-rare inside. 

Bone Marrow - It was good and it was certainly a larger portion than expected. The salts on the side were not needed, as the top of the bones were sprinkled with enough salt. Not a huge fan of the tortilla chips that came with it and there was not enough for the two large pieces anyway. 

Chilean Sea Bass - Always a solid bet with Chilean Sea Bass.. and was no different here. The fish was pan-fried, not overcooked and seasoned well. The jalapeno sauce sounds overwhelming but complemented the white fish, and added a freshness. It kind of reminds me of dishes they serve in the tropics. The menu tells you the oz. the fish will be, but the one we received looked larger than what was stated

Fried banana dessert - the fried banana with the Phllyo Dough was good, the Green Tea ice Cream was good... separately though. 

Yes, it's true, they have large bottles of Panna for $3 - that's a steal for a restaurant.

As soon as I walked in I was greeted by a warm welcome from the chef and a waitress. We sat down and was explained all of the specials and clarified what the kushiyaki (skewer) was and what a tobanyaki (hot skillet) was. We ordered a few appetizers: gyoza, rock shrimp, truffle bone marrow, uni bites, salmon tacos, and the butter lettuce wraps with black cod. The gyoza was soooo good. I've never tried dumplings with only beef inside (usually it's filled with rubbery meat and veggies)  and the eel sauce on it was just the cherry on top. I wish they sold these at the market. The rock shrimp is fried jumbo shrimp cut into pieces and mixed in a Yuzu creamy sauce which isn't overwhelming at all. I usually stay away from anything with mayo and I was afraid I wouldn't like this too much but the Yuzu in the sauce made it tasty and I couldn't help but finish it! I've never tried bone marrow cooked this way before! It's definitely something you have to try before you cross it off the list. The wonton chips on the side with the truffle dressing on top of the marrow was excellent and so rich in flavor! The uni bites were the best uni I've ever tried in my life. I don't think I've ever had uni with a different sauce than soy sauce with wasabi! The sauce in the uni bites were a better combination overall. The salmon tacos were my favorite because I think I could eat this all the time. The wasabi aioli on top and inside the tacos made such a party in my mouth with the raw salmon. I hate raw onions but the ones in the taco actually changed my mind about uncooked onions. I was surprised by the chef's creation. Lastly from the appetizers, the black cod butter lettuce topped with some crunchy flakes were wonderfully done. The juicy cod marinated in sweet miso with the buttery flakes were truly amazing.  

Going on to the main entrées, my mom and I ordered the Nigerian prawn with uni butter, scallops and the filet tobanyaki. The Nigerian prawn was the biggest shrimp I've ever seen. I love shrimp and it totally had a juicier and meatier taste than other shrimps. It was also cooked on the Tepan grill so maybe that's the reason why it was so good. The uni butter had chunks of uni and who could ever dislike that? Next we had the scallops and MAN..... I never knew scallops could taste like this. How the scallops were seared and raw on the inside truly was an orgasm in my mouth. Just when I thought I couldn't handle anymore exciting flavors, the tobanyaki came out. The waitress was extremely good at handling the skillet and waited until the smoke was fairly safe for it to be placed in front of us. It was a sight! 

Overall, the food came out quickly despite the fact that it isn't a fast food restaurant, the drinks were filled constantly, we were checked up on by the server about our food and how we found out about the place,  the chef personally talked with us and made us feel important, therefore we were impressed. This restaurant knows how to treat their customers! We will definitely come back and try more of their items with our friends! Can't wait for them to surprise me next time! It is pricier than your bowl of pho but come on it's Japanese fusion with high quality selections! I'd rather pay it here than at yard house or Cheesecake Factory.",kYRyLtGD6FebXYaN7HCGjw,3,1,5,hHd7Cj-Qcw_XlCJDuELPhw

Im not too big on spicy, and while the rock shrimp had a bite, it wasn't too spicy and I loved it. It was a filling meal for my girlfriend and I who ordered about 6 dishes, which came out around $60.

Here are the delicious items that I sampled last night:

Truffle bone marrow 
Uni bites
Fried rice
Salmon belly ceviche
Banana harumaki
Iced green tea

The bone marrow was such a treat and the truffle oil complimented it very nicely. It was also very nice of them to throw an extra bone in because it normally comes with two and the batch they had were too small. The salmon belly ceviche was so fresh tasting. Salmon can get a very fishy smell or taste and it absolutely did not have any of that. The fried rice was delicious and I really dug their special fried rice that has a combo of all three meats, in case you cannot choose just one! The banana harumaki was just amazing. Warm and gooey banana on the inside with the hint of heat from the dusted cayenne pepper. 

The chef even checked on us and asked us if we wanted some extra wonton chips for our dish. You can tell that he has a try passion for the restaurant business. This place also has amazing service. Super attentive and willing to answer any questions. I also really liked that every time our waitress dropped off a dish, it wasn't just a dash and go. She explained all the parts of the dish and the best way to eat it (such as with the dessert, that if you move it around on the plate, you will catch more of that cayenne pepper). 

A little tip: at this time, it is bring your own bottle! No corkage fee! This may change once they have a liquor license though. I also looked at that happy hour and reverse happy menu. I will definitely be back with a bottle of wine and an appetite to dive into their amazingly-priced little happy hour bites.",dwl0NrgPtTZWT_AKJ0ezjQ,4,2,5,fOMouPbZ7eIc05NxV8pN1w

We ordered the uni bites with ikura, foie gras, Japaneiro yaki udon and sashimi lettuce wraps. All were amazing; yaki udon and uni bites were my favorite. 

The three uni bites were from Santa Barbara, Catalina and Japan. The sauce on top made it difficult to taste a difference between the three, still really good!
The foie gras was good, but did not stand out for me. Same with the lettuce wraps. 
Yaki udon is one of my favorite meals to eat in Japan and the Japaneiro version did not disappoint. 

Japaneiro does not have a liquor license yet! If you're looking to have some sake/wine with your meal, you might want to check them out a little later :)

Let's begin with the items that blew my mind and every body part that has feelings. Japanese A5 Wagyu Beef. Wtf?! Yes I'm serious Yelpers, this is the highest grade of wagyu available and it was melting in my mouth. It came with different ingredients to top off each bite of heavenly steak. The yuzu and truffle oil made an excellent dipping sauce.

Bone marrow with truffle oil and garlic chips. Let me tell you when the bones arrived and I was scooping, yes scooping, the marrow I felt like Fred Flinstone. You know what I did with some of the bone marrow? I ate it with some of the wagyu! (Microphone drop) 

Nigerian prawn truffle. What is in the Nigerian waters because these prawns were huge! My girlfriend and I fought over these bad boys. Topped in truffle oil made it so irresistible. 

Bluefin Toro and Uni. Two of my favorites tucked nicely in a spoon. Three spoons of this amazingness was getting better after each bite. Very creamy.

My girlfriend fell in love with the chicken udon yaki. No broth because it was stir fried. She destroyed it. 

I also had a handful of the appetizers from the happy hour menu and by far the favorites are the rock shrimp, beef gyoza, chicken kushi, and salmon lotus chip.

Presentation of each item was a piece of art. By far the best dinner of my life. Everything I tried was wonderful. The owner, Kevin, was very entertaining and the service from Sarah was impeccable.

I had the Beef Yakisoba, a tad sweet but with the sauce from the gyoza added it was perfect. I didn't leave anything in the bowl when I was finished.

4529979,2015-03-10,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Experience:  met some friends for lunch. High ratings on YELP and in the area, so we picked this spot. We arrived at 11:30 to be completely surprised that it doesn't open until noon. I can imagine they miss out on some business as many people take 11:00 lunch. 

Facility: it's has clean, modern feel with not very many tables, but perfect for 2-6 people. 
It's located in the corner of a small strip mall, that is pretty much empty. 

Service:  I will chock the service up to being new?! I was immediately turned off by the fact they had no diet drinks to offer.  
Ok, not the waitress' fault, so that's not a strike against her. 
But I didn't like that I went to the bathroom and as I walked up, she was going over the entire menu and I missed it. Besides, we were still waiting for one more person. Then, I asked for straws twice, refills on drinks and we had to ask for Sriracha twice. She was nice enough and took her time to explain details when we asked questions. I just think her mistakes are rookie and hope she will get better with time. 

Food:  I ordered a few appetizers because they have a happy hour that starts at noon on appetizers. 
Sea Bass lettuce cups - these were very small one bite cups with a small portion of fried sea bass.  I think this is the first time I ever had sea bass battered...I'm used to it grilled and detracted from the usual buttery flavor of the fish. Would not order this again. 
Beef taco - I ordered this after I saw someone else's come out. It is a two bite mini taco, but it had a nice crispy shell with good flavored beef and a wasabi flavored aioli on top. It was good, but looked a tad better than it tasted. 
Spicy rock Shrimp - this was a decent size portion compared to the other apps. The shrimp were fried and coated with a spicy citrus sauce that wasn't very spicy, but still tasty. 

Tasted the following of other people's plates:
chicken yakisoba - good flavor...a tad sweet. 
Beef kushi - this had a good flavor, but I was a little disappointed in the quality of the meat. Definitely not top shelf meat. 
Fried rice - good flavor, but not amazing. 

Overall: I wanted to give this place more stars, but our lunch was just not that impressive. 
One person at lunch suggested we were probably the fail, because we did not try some of the more specialty items like foie gras or bone marrow. I will give this place another try at dinner, and I'm absolutely going to order the bone marrow!!!!!",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,2,3,3,aCA0XebjHt7KnU4zb5YdWg

Coming from Oklahoma we don't get this type of food so this was going to be a special treat to try something so new and unique. I came in during happy hour because I like to base my return on whether they have good apps or not and japaneiro did not fail to amaze me. I pretty much tried everything they had to offer or until I ran out of room in my stomach! 

Tuna/salmon tacos with wasabi aioli 
Tuna/salmon on lotus chips
Alaskan black cod on butter lettuce wrap
Rock shrimp with spicy yuzu creme sauce
Black angus beef gyoza 
Beef/jidori chicken kushi 
Japaneiro fried rice

Everything was crisp, fresh and flavorful! I rotated from one item to the next. It all complements each other even though they are completely different. If I had to chose one item out of them all to order seconds it has to be the black angus beef gyoza. It wasn't the typical gyoza I find at other places and they definitely do not skimp on the beef. It was plump and juicy! Punched me right in the mouth with its flavor! 

I returned a few days later to try the blackboard menu. Japaneiro serves seasonal items so you know everything will be fresh. The blackboard can change frequently and it shows the skill and creativity of chef Kevin to create dishes on the fly with whatever he gets that day. 

Yakisoba noodles
Truffle marrow with chips
Truffle marrow filet
Banana harumaki
Yuzu coconut mochi with genmai cha ice cream

Speechless...that was my reaction after eating my first bite of truffle marrow with chips. So good I ordered the truffle marrow filet. That was my first time to eat marrow and I was highly impressed. This was definitely an amazing dining experience. Everything I had was delicious and beautifully presented. The staff was nice and attentive.

Woah. Absolutely AMAZING. I ordered quite a few things to split with the party I was with and was extremely pleased with everything we ordered.

Salmon Taco: the sauce has a slight wasabi flavor. I typically don't like wasabi but this was so light and beautifully done. The fish was very fresh!

Chidori Bento: This free range, hormone free, dark meat chicken was incredible. The bento was complemented with a small seaweed salad, a spring salad, tempura (omg that sweet red onion), and a steamed egg. Yummy!!!

Chilean Sea Bass: Wow! My favorite thing so far! (I'm coming back to try that certified angus beef ribeye steak, looks freaking amazing!) This outer layer was seared to a perfect crisp. Wow. Just wow. Eat it.

[DECOR]
This small boutique restaurant has beautiful chairs  and large wall to wall windows. They kept the hand painted murals from Volcano Grille which was a full wall of bamboo on one wall and a Japanese Caligraphy art inspired Volcano on the other wall.

[SERVICE]
The server was very nice. The chefs took the time to greet us and talk about the food, they are all so sweet! The beautiful pastry chef also came out and described the desserts in detail, I was in such awe that I ordered everything! I was not dissapointed! I'm so full I might die though! Haha!

[PRICE]
A great deal for the quality of food. The specialties such as the filet mignon, the Chilean sea bass, and the certified Angus beef rib eye (24oz!) are all top notch quality. I'm happy they described in detail other menu items, I want to try everything here! I will be back!",qTp_3k0vStaUVTt1EzBp6Q,6,3,5,-tpL6N46DLVSPDfLREgPBA

Ambiance: 4/5, tucked away in the back of a random shopping center, cute white hanging lights outside, nice music, inside was pretty casual, nothing too special

Service: 5/5 everything came out quickly and the server was very attentive

Truffle edamame: 5/5 the truffle flavor combined with the salty flavor was amazing, lightly  toasted

House salad: 4/5 fresh spring greens, amazing sesame dressing that was very flavorful QQ, would have preferred some toppings as it was a little plain 

Hot green tea: 5/5 very nice subtle flavor, high quality leaves and had a nice color

Rock shrimp: 4/5 sweet, tangy, and SPICY! Really good flavorful but I'm a pansy and can't eat spicy.  Would have given 5/5 if I liked spicy

Truffle marrow filey: 5/5 OMG, insanely delicious! This dish is a MUST try! The marrow was so tender and flavorful. I scooped up every last bit of it. My bf got his with the foie gras which I highly recommend.  It was excellent.  

Banana harumaki: 5/5 amazing! Sweet bananas baked inside of filo dough with a sweet glaze. My favorite part was the milk tea flavored ice cream that it came with.

They don't serve alcohol yet but they're totally down for you to bring your own booze.  BYOB! Say whhaaaaa!? :) 

Service here is phenomenal. They really want to make sure you have a good experience. Because it is a fusion menu, they are willing to answer any questions you may have. 

The food here is unexplainable. Though I've only tried four different things, everything I've had was delectable and it leaves me wanting more! Everything is fresh and full of flavor! The presentation is great too. I'm in love with their tuna and salmon tacos and obsessed with their rock shrimp. Their menu changes every week to ensure freshness and quality of the food. There's always something different to try! Their weekly menu seem to always consist of bone marrow, exotic fishes, uni, and foie gras.

The house chardonnay and Asahi were the best parts of the meal unfortunately.

Our first item, the beef skewers: inedible. They were so gummy and chewy I spit them into a napkin.

So we weren't off to a good start, but some spicy mayo rock shrimp... how in the heck could that go wrong? No. The rock shrimp were covered in a ginger-ish / citrus-ey flavored spicy mayo. The flavor was complex and thoughtful, but to us it just didn't taste good.

The black cod butter lettuce wraps were just meh, not really any flavor to speak of. There's no special glaze on the cod, so it's just a crunchy-cod and lettuce wrap.

The yakisoba noodles... again, the flavor was interesting and complex... tasted kind of like barbecue or smoky-ish flavor, but it just didn't taste good.

Salmon Lotus chips, just OK. Probably the 2nd best thing besides the alcohol.

Maybe this place just isn't right for us; the food all had interesting and unique flavors that we've never tasted before and although we didn't like the food, clearly other people do, so yeah. Great service though!

Oh-- I forgot-- the edamame!!! Ok, so their garlic edamame (which we got for free for checking in on Yelp!) is seriously legit. Possibly the best edamame I've ever had. So Japaneiro wasn't a complete bust.",mYNZLYcnZol-oSfU-WP4CQ,1,1,2,ITOHv2GnvtL4BPDQRUwN8Q

4918517,2015-01-12,2,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"I have been wanting to try this place since it opened. I've heard some good reviews from friends and seen on yelp. I also heard this place is run by former Nobu chef. I have some friends in town and decided to try this place last night. We had a large group of people. There was 18 of us. We made the reservation prior since it was for so many of us. 

When we got there, the table has not been set up yet. We waited for them to arrange our table. After we sat down, it took our  server four times back and forth to get our drink order right. He kept forgetting what we ordered and we only ordered either hot tea, ice tea or water. I really didn't  think it was that difficult. Then we ordered by section for the food and asked to split the check by section. Some sections got appetizers and their main entrees while some other didn't even get their appetizers yet. They forgot quite a few things that we ordered and we had to keep asking. The sever wasn't apologetic at all when we asked our missing orders. After we got our check, it wasn't the way we asked to split either. Overall, services was 2 out of 5 for me and it ruined everyone's experiences. Most of my friends said they would not go back. I feel kind of embarrassed by recommending this place for us to try. 

Food 

1. Salmon tacos (3.5/5): it was average. Nothing really special about it. 
2 . Rock shrimp with yuzu sauce (3.5/5): it was average too. Nothing great about this either. Kinda like honey walnut shrimp but not as good. 
3. Catalina Island uni (4.5/5): I love uni from Catalina island. They have pretty fresh ones here. 
4. Chilean sea bass (3.5/5): the cilantro dressing was not flavorful enough for me. Sea bass was fresh. 
5. Truffle bone marrow (4/5): it was pretty good except it was bit salty for my taste and I couldn't use any of the seasoning that came with cuz it was bit salty already. 
6. Japaneiro fried rice: (4/5): it was pretty good combination fried rice. 

All in all, I would not recommend to come here with big groups. I like the food but I was not in love with the stuff I've tried. I may come again in the future and try other stuff on the menu when they have a system in place and with a smaller group.",b7rchNJEp6Gaw0bHR-4s4g,3,2,3,JUt-M8PFav8lLz9bbQadDQ

Started off with the edamame & house salad. You can never go wrong with edamame or at least I have yet to find a place that has managed to screw it up. The sesame dressing on the house salad was so yummy even my meat loving boyfriend liked it! The tacos were good (we had beef & salmon), but I'm not a big fan of wasabi so the wasabi aioli was a little too much for me. The beef in the tacos were a little more on the dry side. The rock shrimp was definitely on point! The gyoza was delicious! The black angus beef inside the gyoza was well seasoned & juicy. I just wish they would cut off the fat, but I guess some people like that rubber stuff sometimes. Next, I had the butter lettuce wraps. The Chilean sea bass comes fried with the wasabi aioli on top...not bad once I wiped some of the wasabi off. The black cod comes grilled...the flavor was great, but the fish itself was definitely NOT fresh. Lastly, our dessert was green tea ice cream with coconut filled Mochi on top. I've never had Mochi that didn't have ice cream inside so it was something new to me but overall a good dessert. 
I would normally give this place 3 stars based off the food quality; however, they earn an extra star for being open late since it's difficult to find a quality place that is open late, especially in this area.",i4SBiZHVK3vTYqie4M8P6Q,2,2,4,Z0Kp8M2oH1Ln8hGmNLv9vQ

We ordered from the appetizer list and pretty much just stuck to that portion of the menu the whole night. 

Rock shrimp- 5/5. Really good portion, flavors and crisp. Can be a little too heavy if you eat the whole bowl all at once. 

Salmon ceviche- 5/5. Again a pretty good portion. Comes with chips and you can always request for more chips. Salmon is fresh and the sauce is great!

Scallop ceviche - 4/5. I like the salmon one better. This one was good too but a bit oily and has too many big chunks of raw onion. 

Tuna taco- 4/5. The tuna isn't quite seasoned. But it comes with a wasabi aioli that pairs well. I just wish it had some avocado or another ingredient in it to brighten it up. 

Scallop lotus chips- 5/5. Yumm. This has a sweet note to it and was really good. Lotus is not super crispy but really good. Scallop was so fresh. 

Chicken yakisoba?  5/5 It's the thin noodle with mushrooms. Really good flavor. On the sweeter side but I like sweet. 

Chicken kushiyaki 4/5- chicken on w skewer. Really tender and juicy. 

Baby octopus 2/5. I like the octopus. It was slightly chewy and meaty. But the yuzu sauce was very very overpowering. I made the mistake of eating it in one bite so all the sauce was in my mouth. The best way is to wait it is take off some of the sauce, request a knife and cut it up into a pieces.

Came here over the weekend on our way to Muse. BTW, Muse in concert = astounding. 

This place is a bit pricey, so be prepared. For me, it was somewhat worth the price. As any other place in town (off the strip), I feel that you can really pay for the quality of the food you're getting. I get really tired of people complaining about prices when it's good food. So another reminder: if you look online prior, you can see how much their dishes average. If you don't like those prices, try a place that's more to your price liking. But keep in mind, this should be about quality, service and atmosphere. 

We had a lot, so let me go over what I thought was WELL worth the price. 

The Rock Shrimp - the waitress told us that it was popular. It was super tasty. Large pieces of shrimp, fried and served with their creme sauce. 
I ordered a special - Wagyu beef. First off, this was $22 an ounce. I only ordered 2 ounces, but it was so fucking good. They served it with their truffle sauce and numerous salts/spices. Amazing wagyu. 
Tobanyaki - Filet Mignon. I didn't order this, but my friend did. And I ate some. And it was sooo good. I don't usually like filet. 
Black Cod lettuce wrap - Insanely tasty, to my surprise. I don't like cod. But however they prepared it, it did not taste near as fishy as I'm used to. 

The only thing we didn't like was the Gyoza. It was very oily and it seemed to make the dish overbearing. 

Overall, this was place was excellent. It's tiny, so be prepared for a wait on a weekend. But the service was excellent. Our waitress was very well informed and was very happy to answer any questions we had. Worth the $115 for two people.",-xDW3gYiYaoeVASXywTPgw,19,15,4,o_QPuo4Kh9QYCo-3jnAC7w

I tried each of their tacos - the samon, tuna, and steak. All 3 were delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that they give you 2 of each so I was already full by the time my fried rice came.  And even though the taco shells were crunchy, their portions made it so you could eat it in 2 bites (without making a mess).  

The shrimp in the fried rice was fresh, although the rice was a little bland. My bf ordered the noodles and maybe next time, I'll do the same. For dessert I had their coconut mochi ice cream. I'd never had coconut mochi before but I plan on keeping an eye out for that option in the future.

Aside from these dishes, the main dishes here to try is the bone marrow w/ filet mignon on top, uni and scallops, and their rib eye. Each of these main dishes were mouth watering and very tasty. this place really likes to top things with truffle oil which i think really enhances the flavors of each dish.

Designated as an Asian ""Fusion"" restaurant, and tucked inside an out-of-the-way strip mall with a former chef from Nobu manning the small kitchen, Japaneiro has received quite a bit of praise since opening earlier this year and sitting down with two friends in the small space where Taylor Swift, Maroon 5, and Kanye West boomed overhead the results proved an underwhelming mixed bag - the Strip-side pricing rarely in step with the quality of the product served across nearly a dozen plates.

Admittedly a 'locals-only' sort of spot, and removed from Spring Mountain a bit of a novelty considering the locale, entry to Japaneiro sees the diner face-to-face with the kitchen and flanked with enough seating for a total of just thirty the service trends friendly without really being transparent, a limited laminated menu joined by several chalkboard specials that are detailed with limited explanation while costs are even more obscured - several numbers written next the name of an ingredient with the staff not really going out of their way to describe the upcharges or price per serving.

Sipping water and iced green tea, both provided with copious refills at no cost throughout the course of a ninety minute stay, it was in three rounds that orders were placed after asking a few questions and beginning with two modestly priced menu items the first bites of lightly battered shrimp in spicy cream sauce offered a brief glimmer of hope, the house 'special' fried rice tossed with beef, shrimp, and pork a competent rendition, but certainly nothing to write home about.

Moving next to several specials, three baby octopi were next presented with a good char and snappy flesh beneath light citrus at a cost of $4 each and although the nicely seared filet dramatically draped over a delicious charred marrow bone was indeed a dramatic presentation, the $34 surcharge for flavors marred in cheap truffle oil were still quite excessive - the use of the oil additionally making one wonder what other shortcuts the kitchen may be willing to take.  Thoroughly  underwhelmed by watery Chawanmushi carrying an upcharge of $13 from the five dollar base due to the addition of one meager tongue of Japanese Uni, it was onward to prawns that the meal progressed, and with confusing menu pricing seemingly the rule than the exception each ""6oz"" Nigerian specimen carried a unique charge ranging $23-$28, all but the yuzu and wasabi-tinged cheapest featuring the crustacean overcooked and more than a little tricky to liberate from its shell with the use of only chopsticks, spoon, and fork.

Seemingly offering a bargain with desserts, and at this point certainly nowhere near full despite the eventual tab of $75 per person, suffice it to say that neither the tiramisu or mochi are particularly memorable save for the high price per bite, and although the Banana Harumaki with $3 ice-cream supplement was admittedly well made with creamy fruit tinged in sweet cheese beneath the lightest of shells it still was not enough to save the meal from regrets of not going elsewhere, a situation admittedly unexpected and leaving one to wonder what others see in this place that the group clearly missed.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,11,6,2,vgcWYjbKyftSpr_uZp3M7g

5319254,2018-02-05,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"With the many Japanese restaurants in town, how can another one stand out? Don't offer AYCE sushi - that's a good start. Have excellent service with attentive and friendly servers. Have a smaller variety on the menu but execute them well. And that's exactly what Japaneiro does.

Their menu only has two pages and a board with their specials. Sometimes, having a huge variety can be problematic. But their small menu covers everything even for a group with dietary restrictions/ preferences. Beef, fish, shellfish, veggies, chicken, and lamb - they have it.

Truffle Oil Edamame:
Free with Yelp check-in. They grill the edamame drizzle then with truffle oil and lightly salt them. The grilling makes a huge difference giving the same old edamame a nice smokey flavor. My friends and I kept talking about this (for reals)! 5/5

Scallop Lotus Chip:
Thin crisp lotus chip with a big piece of fresh scallop. Good flavor and texture. 4/5

Escargot:
You get 2 garlicky buttery snails in shell on a bed of seaweed salad and umeboshi on the side. I wish I had bread to soak up the warm garlic butter. 5/5

Scallops with Uni:
Scallops topped with uni in a citrusy savory sauce. Light and refreshing + the creaminess of uni. 5/5

Salmon Tacos:
Crispy tacos with fresh salmon with a creamy citrusy sauce. Simply yum! 5/5

Grilled Baby Octopus:
I was the only one in our group that love and crave octopus. If I see it on the menu, I just have to have it. Nice char and smokey flavor. However, the tentacles were a bit tough and chewy. 3/5

Black Cod Lettuce Cup:
Think miso black cod on a lettuce cup - yup, that simple! Slightly sweet black cod with a light sauce. Our table got a 2nd order. 5/5

Uni Chawanmushi:
Savory custard with a nice broth, and generous portions of uni. 5/5

Their desserts all seem good: hazelnut cheesecake,  banana harumaki with hoji ice cream, matcha/ hoji ice cream, and yuzu coconut mocha with matcha ice cream. Since I can't have dairy and it's a very long drive home, I didn't get to try any dessert.",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,8,7,5,VPhSQGqeW3Jkcedt0K29lw

Items that came with it:

Teramoto Scallop - My first thought was fuckkkk I hate scallops and the times I had scallop they were cooked. The plate came out and they were raw scallops...tried it with the ponzu sauce and god damn it tasted like any other sashimi...this was a great start

Scottish Salmon Ceviche - Came with what I believe is wonton chips....very flavorful however a little bit too salty and sour...

Kumamoto Oyster Uni Foie Gras - This dish was fire. Sad it was only one oyster per person but this shit was fire. You can taste the sea in the uni and oyster and the foie gras brought out this buttery goodness. The butter of the sea with the butter of the land aka butter of the world. One of the highlights.

French Escargot - Never had this in my life and was slightly intimidated, just like eating them crickets at El Dorado. Did not know what to expect but it tasted earthy as fuck. I thought I was eating spinach gum. That's my way of describing it.

Nigerian Prawn - Great dish and the meat closest to the head was juicy. Flavorful and juicy. Great light transition into the....

Truffle Marrow Filet w/ Foie Gras - This shit was overkill in a good way. Like you playing Madden and you 21 skunk somebody but they still wanna play so you blow them out 56-0. First there is a bone marrow and then they stacked with medium rare filet then on top of that you can put foie gras. This was pure goodness for any meat lover and was the excalmation point to the meal. Must get if you go here for sure (will cost you around $50 w/ foie gras...)

Last thing was the desert. 

Banana Harmaki w/ Milk Tea Ice Cream - Nice way to finish off the meal with something that is light but flavorful. The milk tea ice cream was crazy...don't really fuck with that boba shit but this really did taste like milk tea....

Drinks:  there was a large variety of sake to try from. We tried the hot house sake as well as the coconut sake which were both delicious and reasonably priced.

The server was very friendly as well as open to answering all the questions we had about the menu.

The worst thing We tried was the soft shell crab which had a weird odor and smelt like it was old. Overall the dishes were bland and no dish was really good but also no dish was really bad with the exception of the soft shell crab. For the amount we paid and the food we got it wasn't worth it..

5529548,2014-12-24,53,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"With so many notable spots for fusion cuisine having popped up in the middle of the desert over the past few years, Japaneiro kicks the door down and slam dunks their excellent menu into the Asian fusion ring with authority. 

Like a lot of the gushing reviews already mention, the chalkboard specials by the entrance is where the gold is.  My advice would be to take a picture of it to look over with your tablemates so you're not like me and getting up to look over the board again and again as if it were on display at a museum.  

I can never say no to foie gras.  If foie gras told me to jump off a bridge, buy it diamond earrings or crash my car through a convenience store, I'd do it.  It was well cooked and those tasty notes of fatty tenderness in a savory sauce were music to my mouth.  I even showed some restraint by offering the last bite to my wife. :P

The Nigerian prawns tasted as impressive as they appeared.  Large and succulent, the truffle butter sauce that it was accompanied by took it to another level.  The green salad offered a nice balance to the whole dish.  I admit I sucked on the shrimp shells to savor the flavor and only felt 3.1% ashamed/embarrassed about it afterwards.  

Our meal luckily managed to carry over to the late happy hour that occurs M-F 10pm-midnight.  Ending the meal with some great small bites like the salmon/tuna/beef tacos and miso black cod lettuce wraps.  The standout was the rock shrimp with its terrifically crispy fry, micro wasabi kick and cream sauce made it an absolute steal for $5.50.  I guess that shows how good these chefs are; they even managed to make rock shrimp interesting!

The lack of description for many of the items caused me to underestimate things like the ""European Sea Bass"" until I saw it brought to another table near the end of our meal.  The fish looked marvelous with the meat being filleted post-grill and the rest of the carcass twisted up for an interesting look.  I was practically seething with jealousy!

My absolute favorite dishes that night were the gyoza, salmon ceviche, and black cod butter lettuce wrap.
I don't even know where to begin with the gyoza--the meat was sooo tender and flavorful. I like that they drizzled the sauce on top of each individual piece. The sauce was so tangy and just the perfect amount for each piece.
The salmon ceviche!! My goodness. I just wanted that dish on a bowl of rice or noodles or just plain because it was sooo good. Only complaint is there wasn't enough of it! Lol
The black cod butter lettuce wrap packed a big punch in just a small bite, which was very surprising. Cod was cooked & seasoned perfectly.

Things I like:
Kushiyaki Beef- very tender and flavorful.
Scallop lotus chip - the chip was nicely fried and the scallop was sweet and delicious.
Black Cod butter lettuce wrap - the fish was moist with different texture contrast in one bite.
Oyster Uni Foie Gras - good combination of flavors but not the best in town.

Things I don't like:
Hazelnut Cheesecake - lack of hazelnut flavor and cheesecake taste.
Whale soft shell crab - the sauce was too overpowering. I could barely taste the crab.

He can  refund my money if I want. So he told him that yes he can just refund it. I told him that that is not the way to approach costumer, he told me "" I AM THE OWNER AND THIS IS A PRIVATE PROPERTY PLEASE STEP OUT"" Some costumer service!",R38ThijNWeyKTCvY3AwNmA,0,0,1,_GT-9DnM8NZ2NziLsxwzuQ

5 stars for the service

I love this place already. I was welcomed the second we walked into this restaurant. The server, named Sarah, was very knowledgable about the whole menu, answering every question without needing to ask the chefs in the back. Even the green tea is great too! It's not too bitter too! So in the end, we ordered tuna tacos, a side of miso soup, and a beef yakisoba.

The tuna tacos had a good crunch. With clovers and wasabi added onto the tacos, the flavors bursted in my mouth! For some reason two small tacos were filling, maybe it was the spices in the tacos. After this, the miso soup came out. The miso soup is actually unique. There were micro chives in there, and that gave the soup a unique taste! Last, but not least, the yakisoba.

The yakisoba was interesting. It's pretty much fried ramen noodles, but better. The top of the bowl had thin fried fish, and it was moving around! That kept me amused for a good minute before I destroyed the food. Everything was actually pretty filling!

Overall though, this is a hidden gem. I hope many people find out about this place so they can bloom with business. They definitely deserve it.",fcra9uhtCHmpXdhDamb5cg,2,2,5,SRul7cSPylni9BcuKTO6qQ

the Japanese and  French food fusion concept just didn't work for me. I'm an experienced traveller and I have lived in japan, Hawaii and other Asian countries . I don't consider myself a food expert , but I've certainly had my share of exotic Asian foods.  It was an ok experience but nothing to get excited about. I wouldn't recommend to anyone wishing to try Japanese food ( because it's not Japanese food) 
Small portions and pricey, there are better eateries out there .

We went for happy hour and picked a few items to start. 

The chicken skewer came out which I originally ordered for my child. I tasted it first and after biting into it, I spit it out right away. It wasn't fully cooked. I sent it back. 

The Edamame with truffle oil was my favorite. The shrimp dish we got with sauce on the side and it was a lot of batter. The Lotus Chips with tuna was okay. Nothing tasted fresh to me. Maybe it was because of the semi-cooked chicken. 

I am a little sad after this. I know we only had Happy Hour but after reading all of the excellent reviews, I was surprised to get the quality of food that we did. Our server was great and extremely professional. 

I would like to say that we would try it again because of how great he was but unfortunately our experience with the food was not good.",Q7bLDV2RGKF5KJyasrwZ6A,1,1,3,JjMQXs3Txe6DfEboi2eHcw

Chef Kevin Chong is from Nobu which I dine in a lot due to my work. My clients from San Diego even emailed me to recommend Japaneiro after they tried it! 
I walked in with really high expectations, and Japaneiro put smiles on all of us, party of 4! Everyone is satisfied, and each dish we had is never a disappointment. 

TRUFFLE EDAMAME: freshly made, not the frozen ones, you can taste the truffle sauce, simple and tasty to open your taste buds.

RAW OYSTERS: certainly high quality that it will be a waste if they were cooked.

BONE MARROW: rich, creamy, and full of flavors, comes with chips.

SEAFOOD UNDON SOUP: the chef told me that he doesn't have the special broth for undon soup tonight, but he can stir fried the undon for me! Hell I am determined and shameless to ask him to put undon in miso soup as I am craving for hot soup in this drizzling weather. The flavor is not the main concern. But the chef surprised us with this amazing undon soup with great broth and fresh assorted shrimps, sea bass, scallops and vegetables! Thumbs up to Chef Kevin's flexibility and cooking skills!

DRY-AGED STEAK: even it's not Wagyu beef, but it's a wonderful piece of perfectly cooked steak. We order medium well, and it's still tender and juicy! I love the two types of sauces on the side: mustard and the truffle oil is awesome!

FRIED RICE: the simplest dish is how you can see the skill of a chef. This fried rice made by teppanyaki is so tasty with beef, shrimp, chicken, and crunchy sesame. Best fried rice in town!

FOIE GRAS: I love foie gras, and yes, order it. 

DEEP FRIED BANANA WITH GREEEN TEA ICE CREAM: the ice cream is special, not the typically biter green tea taste but fresh and with the touch of sesame, we all love it. 

SCALLOPS: after I ""FORCED"" (lol) the chef to make the undon SOUP, my bestie shows him the picture she saw on line and asked the chef to make something ""Scallops"". And what the chef presents us is the HEAVEN of scallops!!! These SWEETEST Scallops with jalapeños create a happy universe in your mouth. It's that good that after the dessert, my bestie has to order it again before we end this happy meal!!!! 

This place is hidden, the menu is simple, but the food quality is to die for. The chef told us, he can make almost everything, just name it, and everything on the menu is great!

Again, I eat at Nobu a lot, and I love SOHO, but Japaneiro beats them both!!!!",BFFDzZR0ixxD3azljG5ysA,14,9,5,PFDXLtPHiw1I2CV1iPPGSw

Now i know your probably wondering why i only gave this place 3 stars... lets break it down. This place is good but there were some key things that eventually brought it down. First the place is located in a strip mall that has maybe one other store in it so the parking lot is empty (better for me because i like my service) second when we walked in the door we were literally the only people on a sat night?! good or bad sign. We were greeted by the owner and the staff with delight and welcomes. Lets get to the food, started with the bone marrow, black cod lettuce wraps and the oyster shooters. I love bone marrow, ill eat it everyday if i could the bone marrow here was amazing one of the best I've had. The black cod lettuce wraps were nothing special, I've had them at many other places before but the only difference is this place they are really small, like eat 2 at the same time and its still one bite very small. Now to the oyster shooter... i don't know if you've ever had a bad oyster shooter but you will know when you've had one and well unfortnetly we got 2 bad ones. They were so bad that i almost puked! have you ever drank the juice from a not so fresh oyster? yeah taste like ocean and bad fish. Next we got the rock shrimp, fish tacos and the chawanmushi. Lets start with the rock shrimp they were cooked perfectly but the problem i had with them were the flavors were so overwhelming they didn't compliment one another. The fish tacos were good but again they were very very small. Last but not least one of my most favorite japanese dishes chawanmushi a very delicate egg custard some are made with seafood and some vegetables. Unfortunately i was not a fan of their chawanmushi, once again they just had too many complex flavors which didn't compliment one another and eventually just ruin the dish.  The service here is on point, maybe it was because we were the only people in the restaurant but it was still great, very attentive and friendly so great job. Now down to the price, on happy hour its a decent price but almost everything we ate was not on the happy hour so the bill was still pricey but average. Overall i want to like this place but my girlfriend was not a fan, but im willing to give this place another try.",xcW5lXyjxODJQATvB8xN5A,0,0,3,_QLUup3p28y6WnELNgifEg
5871052,2018-01-17,0,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"There's no way for me to even begin describing this restaurant. I have been here twice so far (and many more to come). I came on a recommendation of a colleague. Each time I was here, I was greeted by the chef/owner, Kevin. If you didn't know, he was trained by Japanese celebrity chef Nobuyuki ""Nobu"" Matsuhisa so you know he's a big deal.

Anyway, I was suggested the 7 course meal by the chef himself. If I go into details, this review will never end. Here's the summary of what my experience was. It was amazing! Vegas has some stunning restaurants, but this is my absolute go to place. I can easily say it's my favorite restaurant in Sin City. 

There is no quality place where the owner will be your chef and server at the same time. As he brought out each course for us, it progressively became more exquisite. The 6th course is their flagship dish. That plate had a sliced filet, cooked medium rare topped with a generous portion foie gras and bone marrow. That plate absolutely blew me away. There were so many different flavors going on at the same time and it all complimented each other very well.

Before I left the restaurant, I was already thinking about what to order the next time I make a trip to Las Vegas. This place is a hidden gem. I see big things happening real soon.",TrOonlMB34j-XFQHKZ4dvQ,0,0,5,GAU-cmdyABMseRYNnf-OcA

5921341,2017-05-01,1,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Due to my favorite sushi spot being closed early on Sunday's.

I took it up to Yelp to help with our sushi or sashimi cravings. I've been wanting to try Japaneiro out for awhile since they appeared to have good reviews and their pictures of their food got my attention. However; My husband, daughter and I had high expectations and we came out disappointed. 

At about midnight there were only 2 tables that were dining so we were seated inside right away. They had specials written on a chalk board. The restaurant isn't big, they have openings for seating outside or inside. It was a little hard to the server's his attention first since he appeared to have a table of frequent diners. They seemed to know each other, talking and laughing luridly but once we got his attention, he was helpful and answered all my questions since we mentioned that we were first timers. 

We ordered pretty much everything on the Happy Hour Menu. Their main menu only had 2 pages, there weren't many options and little description. My husband ordered a NY Steak as his main dish.

A. For presentation. The pictures are deceiving, the portions sizes are definitely small.

C. They were a bit bland. 

A. For service. There 

A. For having a Happy Hour menu.

I think Japaneiros is pretty much a tapas place so I could understand the portions. However, for my husbands NY steak, we were a little confused if his plate was already brought out or if it were the beef from the Happy Hour or his main course due to the portion lacking in size. I asked the server and he said he already had brought out the NY steak. My husband and I just looked at each other in shock disbelief. My favorite dishes was the scallops and the rock shrimp were my husband and daughters favorite.

With the amount we paid, we walked out content and headed to the gas station for some snacks. We could have spent the same amount elsewhere and walk out with full bellys. My husband and I try to live a healthy lifestyle but we also believe in treating ourselves once in awhile. I'm sorry to say that we won't be returning, but please don't let my review discourage you from eating here.",at41ymjb1OVu34ii08bCEw,5,2,3,MszmoCkUuSXutAG-VbEczg

In the mean time they do have a liberal bring your own bottle policy, the chef (Kevin) always comes out to check how each creation was.

5959852,2015-08-08,9,O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"Despite all the rave reviews I read on Japaneiro, I was still in no rush to visit. The location didn't seem very appealing. 

On an early Saturday evening we arrived and were seated quickly. The restaurant was pretty empty and the music was blaring. The menus didn't consist of many options, a majority of their specials are vaguely listed on a chalkboard near the entrance. Make sure you snap a picture so you don't end up standing up blocking the aisle while you decide what to eat.

Service was friendly and attentive but nothing from the specials or the menu had me too excited. We decided on a good assortment of items and waited for the onslaught of food.

The first round consisted of the rock shrimp that were a table favorite. I think I was the only person that didn't enjoy this dish. The flavors were a little sweet for my taste and I've had better versions with more spice and flavor elsewhere. 

Of the dishes we tried the standouts for me were the bone marrow filet, prawns and the octopus. The rest of the items were good but forgettable. 

We closed out our meal with several dishes from the dessert menu. All were perfunctory but needless to say, I was not wowed by a single one. The addition of red cabbage to the mochi dish still leaves me puzzled.

The pricing was a bit confusing on the chalkboard and most of the menu was a little pricy considering the awkward off strip location and the lack of inventiveness.
