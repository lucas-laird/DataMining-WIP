Nathan's hot dog joint at the top of the Manhatten escalator in New York, New York is a great retreat for a quick classic American dog. We ordered a cheese and bacon, a sauerkraut two times and relish.

The fries are always crispy golden brown and plentiful. The onion rings are also yum. They are large and the onions are sweet. 

I recommend asking for any topping to be served on the side. They tend to have a heavy hand so the bun becomes soggy and the sidevoverpowers the taste of the dog.

She took her meal to go, where I took my business to Bruxie, located down the escalators, passing the Zumanity theater, out the glass doors to your right, I had an enjoyable tasty meal that consisted of Waffle-Cut fries, delicious chicken tenders AND a choc-pb shake for a WHOPPING TOTAL of $9.86.

This particular Nathan's is located in New York New York Casino and fortunately this restaurant was located away from the smoke filled casino.  It's located on the second floor next to the arcades.  This was a positive thing because we hate smokers.  

Always heard about it but I never tried it until today.  Sure you can get the dogs at your local supermarket and put one together at home but nothing beats going to one of these hot dog places and chomping down on a Nathan's Original Classic Hot Dog with fresh crinkle cut French Fries with it.

Stopped by the New York New York location with friends after I was told by one of my friends that the hot dogs were good...and good they were. I got a chili cheese dog that was about the size of an average hot dog. Lots of flavor came from the link with a nice crunch from the outer layer when biting into it. The chili was decent as well. To top it off was a liquid cheese that didn't add nor take away from the hot dogs flavor. I do prefer shredded cheese but you work with what's available.

This cost $8 and some change. Pretty steep for the portion especially when you can grab a Vegas foot long hot dog with chili and cheese within the $2 to $4 range if that's anything to compare portion wise. However, Nathan's hot dogs are a lot more flavorful which will leave you wishing it was bigger for the cost. I actually wanted another one but wasn't going to fork out another $8 or so. At least not during the same visit.

Nathan's is convenient especially when it comes to late night eats that are fast to get to within the hotel to help ease any alcohol consumption. With that being said, I'd be lying if I said I wouldn't pay the cost again sometime in the future. Great taste but needs to ease on the prices.

Since it's a hot dog, I figured I probably wouldn't be back so I thought kill two bids with one stone and got the Bacon Hot dog covered with their famous chili.
Ok I'll give them the fact that it truly is a Coney Island/Board walk/beach style hot dog and I shouldn't expect more, but I expected flavor that was killer. Nope, tasted just like what I get from Zack's on the beach at Huntington Beach CA. A beach hot dog. The chili was pretty much average and had a good flavor, but nothing to write home about.
I've tasted better at Costco, really, and cheaper.

The onion rings were not good at all... period!

The garlic knots were actually very good! Bite size would have been better instead of the size of a roll.   

Atmosphere was a ""B+"" because I enjoyed the music they played, that 50's 60' Doo Whop style east coast thing.

We each ordered the chili dog with fresh cut fries. The chili dog was pretty awesome in my book, although I wish the sausage (wiener har har) was bigger. The size of it was the kind you can buy at a grocery store that comes in like a 12 pack. But, unlike making it at the home, the hot dog was more awesome; the wiener was cooked to be slightly crunchy on the outside, but very juicy and flavorful on the inside. As for the chili, you can see the beans in it, but it's not overpowered by them, and the chili itself isn't overwhelming as I usually find it to be in a hot dog joint. 
As for the fresh cut fries, think movie theater or target fries. The cuts are fairly large and plump but there's a certain offsetting smell to them, the smell of cafeteria fries or so.
One regular coke was more than 3 bucks which made no sense to me. How can a hot dog joint charge almost half the price of an entrée for a drink? This is not cool.

Was skeptical about a Nathan's that served pizza as well but it was shockingly not terrible! I've had MUCH worse pizza in Vegas, namely Grimaldi's in the Palazzo, which I had (mistakenly) thought would be fairly safe as it's an institution (though not my favorite) in Brooklyn where people line up around the block in below freezing temps for a pie. In fact, I've (on rare occasion) even experienced worse pizza in the real NY, NY. In fact, even the crust was edible and better than my favorite pizza shops in LA (Mulberry St Pizza - the one in the valley, not the Beverly Hills one - and Abbott's).

I was also missing Nathan's crinkle fries so gave that a whirl too. It's weird that here you can only get no-cheese, chili cheese, or bacon cheese fries instead of just cheese fries. Got the bacon on the side so I could test the authenticity of the cheese fries first, and was pleasantly surprised to find that they're pretty much the same. Good QC on your outposts, there, Nathan's. Was also happy to discover that the cheese fries were just as good with bacon. They gave us 2 condiment cups full of fatty bacon swimming in its own grease, more than enough to cover a serving, and I happily fished the rest of the bacon out of the cups of liquid fat using the weird but signature Nathan's ""fry trident"" (""fry-dent""?) and polished them off by themselves. I hope Nathan's has added this to their menus in NY/NJ because this was a winner, but I do hope they haven't done away with the traditional ovo-lacto option.

Everything was of course twice as expensive as it would be in NY (it's an expensive city but cheap eats abound).

The rolls they use also didn't really hold up to well to the product.  As anyone one knows, a cheese steak is 50% about the bread.

The toppings were fresh and the burger was very good. Also the bacon was cooked just right. Not too soft and yet not too crisp. The only thing I was not a fan of was the lemonade.

You can see through the clear windows and it looked tasty! Even at a hot dog place. The prices were just right, for Vegas standards, so this is my future secret gem, because it has a soda fountain with free refills, so if you were smart like us, but not lazy, keep your large soda drink that you paid five bucks for and keep coming back throughout your stay! We were staying at MGM which is right next door so it would make more sense that way and especially if you were staying at NY NY. Otherwise, disregard my comment! They have salads, chicken, pizza and dogs of course! A must try! The food comes pretty quickly, since they make it for you after you order, and they bring it to your seat! Classy touch!",Hhc5iKV5CDoFLruTunY7YA,0,0,5,3dWegmVu7isRLFyMca8mQw
