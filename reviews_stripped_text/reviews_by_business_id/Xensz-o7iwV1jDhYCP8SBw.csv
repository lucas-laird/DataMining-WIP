I sat at the counter as a single recently, but I wouldn't advise it.  There is less service there, and they kind of forget about you.",XWhXY9Xk-4JQE0Z96EvGqQ,0,0,3,7wx8bb8kBtIHOX2ppI_JCw

We had to get dinner before the show, so we found a restaurant in The Mirage that was close, and it just so happened to be the Caribe Caf√©.  This is definitely one of the better Casino restaurants that I have been to in my time here.  Even though the atmosphere is thick with the heavy hearts of the losers (I would later join this group...), it was still a nice place to eat.
 
 I ordered the P.L.T. - a Portabella mushroom, lettuce, and tomato sandwich -  I was then chastised by the waitress as to the why a ""big man like me was ordering such a woman's sandwich"".  Granted it was on the 'Light and Healthy' part of the menu...  Oh well, my manhood took a ding, but I made up for it by ordering and killing their amazing Chocolate Gelato.  Wow was that good.  As for the sandwich, it was ok, it was served luke warm when it should have been hot and the mushrooms weren't seasoned and bland.  

My friend (who had the milk shake trouble at the Paradise Club at the Hilton) got their Chocolate Cake.  Wow, that looked amazing and was fantastically tasty.  

 I recommend coming here for desserts.  The entrees are ok, but the desserts are wicked good and you do get what you pay for with them...",dI1xL1mipCf4MXj9_BRcuw,0,0,3,q1f9rsEYhwg6gJ7X-1kofA

Act 1, Scene 1

Setting: 10am, Vegas. Poolside Cafe. Cue Keri:

Keri (to waitress): ""Hi, can I have a Diet Coke and BLT?""
Waitress: ""Sorry,"" pops gum. ""We don't serve lunch until 11am.""[Looks at Keri and CK condescendingly. Thinks: fatties.]
Keri: ""Well do you have the ingredients???""
Waitress: ""Yes.""
Keri: ""Then I don't understand why you can't make me a BLT? Now.""
Waitress: ""Because it's not 11am."" [CK starts to cry. Waitress takes pity] ""OK, if you want lunch food, you should go to Crepe Cafe in the hotel.""
Keri: ""Crepes? CREPES? So what, I go there and get a bunch of crepes?""
Waitress: ""Uh, I mean if you want."" [Looks confused] But they serve burgers and fries and stuff 24 hours.""
[CK rips up menu and throws water on the ground. Keri tosses over the table. Exit.]

Act 1, Scene 2.

Setting: Crepe Cafe is actually Caribe Cafe. 10 people stand in line for a half empty dining room.

CK: ""Uh. What's the deal with this line? I see about 42 free tables?""
Person in Front: ""I don't know.""
CK: ""What do you mean you don't know?""
Person in Front: ""Uh, I mean I don't know..."" [CK rolls eyes, nudges Keri, points at Person in Front. Swears.]

Fast forward 15 minutes.

Hostess: ""Hi! We can seat you now! Follow me!""
[Keri and CK race after hostess. Jump in booth. Clap hands. Grab menus. Talk about burgers and fries. Stop. No lunch food on menu. Freak out commences.]

CK: ""Keri! Did you ask them if they serve lunch food?"" [CK agitated. Eye twitching.]
Keri: ""Well the other woman told me they did!"" [Keri starts to panic. Turns over menu. Grabs another.]
CK: ""I did NOT just wait 15 min in line to not get a burger!""
[Enter unsuspecting Salvadorean waiter.]
CK: ""Hey! You! They told us there'd be burgers here.""
Keri: ""And fries!!!!!!""
Waiter: ""I just take drink orders.""
[CK throws menu on ground again. Swears. Curtains close.]

Act 1, Scene 3

Setting: Keri is rocking back and forth in her chair. CK is lying on the ground, crying. Clouds part, Heavens open, Angels start to sing. Enter our savior, Lai, The Wonder Waitress.

Lai: You want burgers?
Keri and CK: YES!
Lai: You want BLT?
Keri and CK: YES!
Lai: Fries?
Keri and CK: YES, YES, YES!!!!

[Wait at least another 30 min. Food arrives. In any other setting, no self-respecting human being would touch with a 10 foot pole.]

Final Act:

Setting: Keri and CK shoveling food, quietly, into mouths. CK unbuttons pants. Keri steals fries when not looking. Lai gets big tip.

1491523,2008-11-05,1,Xensz-o7iwV1jDhYCP8SBw,"After a late Saturday night. Sunday morning called for breakfast stat! My group walked over to Carnegie Deli and saw a short line, so we said screw it and walked back to Caribe Cafe where there was no line. Turns out our group of eight still had to wait for like 20 minutes to get a table. Despite the fact that the cafe still had plenty of empty tables,  I assume they just did not have enough servers that morning?!?

Anyway Las Vegas Casino Cafe's are pretty much glorified Denny's. So their food is always just good enough, and pricing is fair. However the service here really really SUCKED big time. I mean it took literally forever for anything and everything. Probably about 10 minutes before someone took our drink order, another 10 minutes before we got our drinks. Another 10 minutes before they took our food order, another 20 minutes before we actually got our food...on top of that they forgot half of our drinks and we had to remind some of them like 3 times to bring certain drinks they forgot. Oh but the bill came real fast (hmm...) Yeah never again...go to Carnegie Deli short walk away, guarantee much better food and service.  No wonder this damn place was empty.

Not only was it insanely overpriced, something that I was expecting to happen, the quality was actually below that of Denny's.  The only reason we went in was to kill some time while the boys gambled.  Our food was delivered quickly which was nice but there was nothing satisfying about it.

1969131,2009-04-23,0,Xensz-o7iwV1jDhYCP8SBw,"Conveniently located right below the hotel elevators at The Mirage, Caribe Cafe is available at all hours. The food is a bit too expensive for what it is. It has all the regular Americana dishes that we typically crave (Hamburgers, cheesesteaks, salads, etc.) 

The decor is a bit nicer than regular Cafes. The service is decent but nothing out of the ordinary. The dishes range between 15-25 dollars depending on what you order. With that said, most Las Vegas restaurants base their price on service and experience. This one was typical of any diner and the food was good, but not great. Now Vegas is not a cheap place in general, but 8-15 dollars would have made more sense. I didn't see any specials on the menu like most Vegas eateries. 

Overall, it's decent. But hey, if you're a hotel guest and you're somewhat buzzed or drunk or just had a long night, something close to the room just makes more sense. But if you're staying at a different property, there's plenty of Cafes inside casinos with a more reasonable price.",chmWVpPMEyXcx8tgWdIcVQ,1,0,3,YOB_U7aiM5jotQFenXBfGw
2597970,2008-08-05,0,Xensz-o7iwV1jDhYCP8SBw,"I have not tried much here but what I tried was good.  I went for breakfast.  I had coffee (I got a whole pot to myself, too!) and cinnamon French toast.  I really wanted some fruit but what the menu listed was marinated strawberries which would seem to be some sort of syrupy strawberry thing.  Regardless, I wanted the strawberries so I ordered them with my French toast.

When my French toast was served, it actually had a side of fresh sliced strawberries and bananas which were not anywhere on the menu but were precisely what I wanted on my French toast.  It was as of the unseen cook somehow read my mind.  So, this really was a mess up but it happened to work for me.  And, the French toast was good and served with a little pitcher of maple syrup and a bowl of butter.

I thought they had a decent selection of breakfast options (there were several that sounded really good to me) and the service was good.  There was a line when we arrived but it seemed to go away very quickly.  Again, I am not sure about the non-breakfast items here but I would return here for breakfast quite happily.",tIP5tmJzK2jFKJh6lE-_Ag,0,0,4,cZj_B66dL2OROeTzhLmctQ

Drais hasn't seen the last of me!

Hungry from dancing 6 hours straight at Wet, one of my girls and I went out for a CHEESE BURGER.

Weird that this place has such terrible reviews. I was glad we found something open and decent to eat. 

We ordered a fresh jicama and mandarin salad, which to my surprise was reallllly good. I was expecting something yucky given the hour but again, its Vegas so it was good!

15 minutes later my huge, juicy cheeseburger with swiss and sauteed mushrooms arrives in all its glory... after 3 bites I'm full. I felt like such a sinner wasting 2 perfectly good burgers (my friend only took a few bites of hers too) I guess that happens when you deprive yourself of a normal eating schedule. 

Oh well. At least next time I know where to grab a burger and salad at any hour in a nice hotel.",cx6CMeztrzFYAY0gpaC3Mg,4,2,4,RYQSZvxZtiZ8PsX2uLFizg

HOWEVER, I had the worse soup ever in my life here. I ordered a bowl of French onion soup (basic, right?) and when the waiter took the soup out I was so shocked that even my friends noticed.

""Dude, you have the most surprised expression on your face!"" - My friend
""What did I order again?"" - Me
""Onion soup."" - The waiter from the back replied and left right after.

Visually: The soup had a huge blob of cheese all burn-melted on top and a slice of bread ALREADY soaked in it. Okay, whatever, maybe the chef was drunk. I mean who the hell would present a simple everywhere soup like that??!

Taste: I took a sip of the soup, it was really salty. My other friend Jonas ordered a normal chicken noodle soup and his soup was salty too. I made everyone at the table take a sip of my soup and everyone agree the soup tasted horrible and salty! 

Service & Overall: I was so angry that I was complaining the whole time at the table (in which the waiter NEVER come back to the table to check on us so that I can complain through out the whole dinning experience). When I got back to the hotel room around 4 or 5AM in the morning, I was just so dissatisfy and in disbelieve that I just have to share my worse soup experience with my roommates waking them up!

My dad used to take my sister and I there so that we felt ""included"" in the Vegas experience since we couldn't gamble, stand there while my dad gambled....basically do the things the adults could do.  
It's changed a few times (decor and menu) but I will always have a bit of a soft spot for it in my heart.  I ate a very late night/early morning meal there this weekend (grilled cheese and cole slaw).  I think the grilled cheese could have tasted better (how do you mess that up) but the cole slaw was great.  My friend's chicken fingers were great, and my other friends omelette was almost tasteless according to her.  Not so good this time.  
I've been many times and for the most part it lives up to high expectations.

Once we got our drinks, it took another 15 minutes to get our food orders.  We both ordered the complete breakfasts and it tasted horrible. The eggs were soggy, the potatoes were mushy, and the ham steak was disgusting. Don't get me started on the prices.  It cost $6.50 for a glass of orange juice! Horrible...just plain horrible.  We ended up paying for food that was similar to what we paid for in room service.

By all means, do not eat here.  The service is slow and the waiters are very, very rude. This is unacceptable, especially at the Mirage.  Do yourself a favor and walk across the street to McDonald's.  Trust me.",-hDRLqC8VqceLEXQbvrAIA,0,0,1,StoXMCp_smAnt7G2Ec6hgg

We got seated and ordered a d.coke,, ice tea, buffalo wings, raspberry jicama babygreen salad, and a patty melt!  Service was quick and accomodating my dad needed directions to the restroom to wash his hands and they said they would just bring him some wet naps and cloths which was nice since the bathroom is outside the cafe.  The wings were very buffalowy and tasty however they were a little cold and they tasted old as if they had been reheated once or twice bleh.  The patty melt was yummy super greasy but how else is a patty melt supposed to be?  Plus the fries were yummy except the occasionallly BEYOND crispy ones.
