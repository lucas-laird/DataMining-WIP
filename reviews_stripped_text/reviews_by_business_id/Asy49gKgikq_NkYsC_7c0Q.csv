578281,2015-09-24,1,Asy49gKgikq_NkYsC_7c0Q,"I want to give the guys working today the benefit of a doubt, but they didn't make it easy.

Capriottis is a good chain sandwich shop, well ahead of subway and on par with places like Jimmy Johns but with more calories. It's got a decent comfort food sandwich style menu. Prices are a little more expensive but the sandwiches are usually pretty well loaded.

I've been to this location before in the afternoon around 3pm. I was in and out.

This time, I stopped in at 11:32 am. There were two other people ahead of me already waiting for sandwiches. I ordered the pastrami and proceeded to wait. No problem: day off and have a fully charged cell phone.

It would've been nice to know the woman in front of me ordered a dozen sandwiches. The guy after her and I waited, cell phoned, and watched ESPN. While waiting one guy who called in an order walked in a grabbed his; but his was already done I'm sure. 30 minutes go by and eventual the 12 sandwiches are done. 3 more minutes and the guy in front of me gets his sandwich, and as he does two people walk in. A woman orders a turkey sandwich and a younger guy orders a pastrami. In 4 minutes the woman gets her turkey sandwich and is out the door. 

Okay, maybe a cold turkey sandwich takes less time and effort to make. Sure.

When the kid after her got his pastrami sandwich after me. That was when I knew It was bad review time. At 12:46, over an hour later, I did receive my pastrami. And it was good. But not worth over an hour of my time. 

I contemplated walking out multiple times, but I figured ""any second now.""

Advice for locals who plan on coming here: call ahead of you know what you want.

Please don't let this review deter you from other capriottis.",BYnnHEwIPRMnjpNVH7fEPA,1,0,1,XK7YkzKYnR9sOtCsTS3hBg

Although I can overlook rudeness when the service is quick and the food is good, that ended today. After waiting for 25 minutes to get a single sandwich, when I got it home to my surprise the sandwich was not only mostly bread but it was ""made"" and I use that term loosely, made incorrect.

I asked that the large sand which I ordered be cut in 4 pieces.... That didn't happen

Asked & paid for sweet and hot peppers but never received them.

Drove home to complete disappointment. Fiancé was exhausted from working the AM shift so I told him stay home I will run it back.

Starting to think that this was done on purpose  so no one could reach the number for services.
So on the fifth time, someone answered the line so we can place an order at around 6:55 pm. The male employee mentioned that they ran out of buns because they got a heavy catering or to go order- ran out of buns on a weekend? 
Went to the gas station across it to fill up gas with the intent of dropping by personally to buy sandwiches but saw that the employees were leaving as they closed the lights and doors.
Yes, the team has to go home - was this acceptable to you to pre- close on a Saturday?
The fact is the closing should be at 8 pm as stated in this yelp ad. If there were any changes then please update and do justice for your own sake.
Would completely understand but this was not the first time it happened, one time they ran  out of meat for the Philly cheesesteaks.

DO NOT GO TO THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET SICK. PERIOD. 


I've ordered from there many times and did again today. I've always felt it was one of the worst locations in Vegas and that there was little to no training for the staff. They are all very unprofessional, dirty, and grungy looking and the service is almost always terrible.  When we called to order today it took the woman on the phone a long time to get the order right and I was already discouraged but my wife and I went ahead and picked it up anyway. When she went in she said everyone there looked extremely dirty and questioned why a cook came from the back with gloves on to run the register. 

Still, craving a classic Capriottis sandwich we came home and started eating our turkey and cheese Steak. Half way through eating my sandwich I bit into something I thought was a fatty piece of turkey..when I spit it out I found out its something with the consistency of rubber. Im sure  it didn't come from any part of a turkey nor did it belong in my sandwich. I've attached a picture of it and will be happy to hang onto it should you need it for any reason. 

When I think of a Capriottis location I think of good food, nice people, clean restaurants, and this location has disappointed me for the last time. I have every intention of leaving a scathing review online and am tempted to contact the health district to find out why there was a foreign piece of rubber in the middle of my sandwich. I'm truly disgusted and will not only not visit this location ever again, I'm tempted to stop visiting any of them. This location has terrible Yelp and Google reviews and I find it extremely hard to believe that corporate would not be aware of the problems at this store. The fact that this owner is allowed to continue these terrible business practices is appalling and beyond comprehension.  I'm sure in your franchise contract there are provisions for keeping a certain standard and this location either needs to be bought out or shut down. 

I really hate leaving bad reviews for anyone and hate even more having to write corporate to complain about my experience but I cannot let this go. I'm sitting here writing this questioning what else was in my food that I might not have noticed and am feeling truly disgusted. 

I'm not looking for anything and I definitely don't want any free food or for this owner to contact me to try and make things right. I'm going to call the store and ask for a refund. If they are unable or unwilling I expect that refund to come from you.  If nothing else works I'll be calling my credit card company and issuing and chargeback for what we just paid. 

For the sake of the rest of your locations and their owners I highly suggest you investigate this location, the owner,  and the employees that work there. They have caused you to lose a loyal and die hard customer forever.",hEAezdxj08M5jsvt8M72IA,3,0,1,lFZryG4vaa94udZfXPwnRg

He wrapped it back up, took it to the counter, told them, and said he wants everything that comes on it EXCEPT cheese and onions.

Some of the dumbest people on the planet are employed by this whole chain. You're better off shoving a loaf of dry bread into your mouth and burning $8. You'll feel the same after both.

First of all, don't offer a call ahead and pick up service if your employees are so fucking lazy and stoned that they can not hang the phone up right. I called 10 times with a busy time in a span of 10 minutes. Are you kidding me?! 

I get there and tell the employee I tried to call to place a order for pick up but can not because once again your phone is off the hook, he looks at me picks the phone up and sets it back and says "" that's weird "" . No I'm sorry no nothing

I order a HOT bobby and a Italian sausage and NOW I have to sit in this establishment for 30 fucking minutes ! On top of it people who came in after me got my food before me! Of course I get my bobby and it's NOT hot, I ask it to be put in a oven and they wrap it tin foil and set it on the grill. I fucking can't with this establishment. 


The only good employee was the young girl working today! The others are completely fucking worthless. The guy you have working the counter has a set speed of -1 and no urgency to get anything done in a timely matter no personality no NOTHING. I am so fucking done with this establishment, it needs to be shut DOWN. Waste of space. NO reason with two people in front of me that I should have sat there for 45 minutes waiting for 2 sandwiches . And it all could have been avoided if your employees hung the fucking phone up or management bought new phones. Corporate will be hearing from me.",oNIaAW9_L7R3IyRrtpU86g,0,0,1,SYpPHrA0zzPY0tVQ1umL4A

I have been going to this location for many years & it always has been a sub-par location compared to the others.  I will actually travel out of my way and go to the Silverado & Vegas Blvd location rather then go to the Southern Highlands location if I can. 

I can't tell what is worse the customer service on the phone or in the store? There is no etiquette for taking orders over the phone. I order the same sandwich every time and each time they ask different questions on the phone, different ingredient options. I often get the feeling that they're not even sure what comes on their sandwiches. When I pick up the sandwich,  I never know what to expect.  

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers,  it appears the owner only recruits out of the skate park? Complementary ""F"" bombs and foul language at no extra charge.  On a positive side they always have sports on TV that he can watch while you're waiting for your food :) 

Do yourself a favor and skip this location. Sorry Capriottis :(",Z0m_sfnyJ-KWLcUi3TWHKA,3,1,1,Zf7XHMC5kMnfAgVPigyCZg

I ordered as soon as I walked in and then noticed over the counter the floor (all of it) was covered in food.  Obviously from the entire day's work as it was just before closing that I went in. Even the counters were gross!! 
4 more people ordered after me and all 4 received their food before me! I was forgotten. Finally I received my order to go and went home to find not only the wrong sandwich I ordered but there was virtually almost no meat or anything on the bun.  It was literally mostly all bun. And looked aweful. Thrown together without a care.  I didn't even bother going back for them to correct it.  
Because of this I will never go to any Capriotti's ever again !! Those guys totally put me off it. To bad!!

5499066,2012-04-01,0,Asy49gKgikq_NkYsC_7c0Q,"Overhyped. Capriotti's has some good sandwiches and some that just don't connect.

My favorite sandwich here is the Capastrami, greasy pastrami grilled with melted Swiss, generously topped with creamy cole slaw and Russian dressing. Reubenesque and held together well by the bread.

Unfortunately, that same bread is the reason why Capriotti's cheesesteaks and Italian subs don't work. The rolls on which its subs are served are hard and dense, which means they don't absorb the favors and moisture of the rest of the sandwich.

The cheesesteaks also suffer from meat that's grisly, dry and flavorless. Bland would be a word for it.

The Bobbie isn't my thing - I think mayo is gross, and without it the Bobbie sandwich gets unbearably dry. That being said, the store roasted turkey goes great on cold subs with provolone and hot peppers.

Jersey Mike's is better for cold subs and Pop's is the place to go in Vegas for cheesesteaks.",n-U5fa4B0hKfmRSZ-M7BMg,1,0,3,zeGoQvNPvOh8aOvdtbtRgw
5500694,2013-02-26,2,Asy49gKgikq_NkYsC_7c0Q,"I was getting ready to install a new stereo in our car and wanted to grab something quick for dinner that was still delicious and easy to eat so what better than snatching up some Capriottis right? Well, I was very very let down this time. We called into the store to make the order and everything seemed great at that point since they took down the order and read it back perfectly. Soon after that the things to come should have been a fair warning.

Upon walking into this location all of the tables were occupied by very gloomy looking folks almost pissed off looking and not a single one of them had a sandwich on the table. There was a gentlemen in line before me picking up a to go order and as I stood there waiting I watched as the guy cooking everything was literally running full sprints around the back trying to get sandwiches made, and the upset patrons seemed to get even more in the dumps by seeing someone get in line. 

Before I tell you what went down with my grub let me give you our order, 1 med capastrami with extra Russian dressing, 1 med capastrami with hot peppers and mushrooms, 1 med Bobbi. All seems simple right, considering it is basically a order of all things Capriottis the basic we are known for this type sandwiches. My order was ready pretty quick so we grabbed them and went on to the house to get our grub on and upon unwrapping what should have been a delicious monstrosity of a sandwich in turn was a dry overcooked lump of letdown... The bread was so crazy dry it was like eating dry oats and to top that off the pastrami was cooked so long it was truly like chewing leaves... Not that I have chewed on leaves before. The final straw for me was that I order Capriottis at work quite a bit and when you order it with hot peppers and mushrooms they are cooked into the meat just the way I like it and for some reason the cook put my sandwich together and then threw raw hot pepper on top of the slaw and then raw mushrooms... ummmm, that is not how its done.

In my opinion a sandwich is one of those things that you look forward to eating for some reason, that is great when your sandwich is awesome but when you get a bad sandwich it is almost as bad as if someone kicked your dog or something. I wish this review was to say how amazing the sandwiches were and that I am sporting a new Capriottis shirt and hat because that sandwich was so good I want to be a poster boy, unfortunately that is not the case.
