If you're in the mood for new and exciting flavors, illumilatte is the place to go. 

We got a Nutella macaron, a birthday cake macaron and a red velvet cake pop. The cake pop was moist and delicious. The Macarons where the best that we have been able to find in Las Vegas. 



The salted caramel latte is amazing and so is the green tea frap. My girlfriend got it with chocolate chips blended in, and it is a must try!!

They proceeded to assist me in even trying out a drink. I tried the famous Illumilatte frappe and it was quite delicious! So, I ordered that along with a Forbes Grilled Cheese panini. This place's atmosphere is quite modern and rusk. The theme is also quite different than most cafes that I've visited and this place definitely has a great and relaxing vibe.

Prices are also very affordable and not so expensive. I ordered a 24 oz Illumilatte frappe and a grilled cheese and with 10% off, it only came to about $9. That is a hell of a good deal if you ask me! 

Pros: Free wi-fi, great selection of drinks, prompt service, and great attitude of workers. The overall ambiance of the cafe is also great.
Cons: No cons except that there seems to be less chairs only because people choose to stay longer than they should because of free wifi. I don't blame them since the place is very hip and modern and actually very relaxing to be in lol.",UtUy4oOu92zOahLQAO34eQ,1,1,5,DR0m_421OTXY0hx7vGSqig

I was excited to come here because friends spoke positively, but I came here on three different occasions and was not satisfied on any of them. 

I was really eager to try their Turkish coffee (a personal favorite), especially since few places make it in this area. I asked how they prepared theirs - ""Turkish style."" ...I didn't push for explanation and just tried it for myself. It tasted more like a bland espresso. It definitely did not have the proper richness, was watery, and had no grounds at the bottom.

I ordered an iced chai on a different visit a few months apart, and although the description below it said ""spicy,"" it was not. It was way, way sweet and watery.

Also went with my boyfriend and he took a few minutes looking at their menu. Cashiers there were helpful in describing the different types of blended specialty drinks offered, but vocally expressed their disappointment when my boyfriend didn't order their ""most popular"" specialty drink. I ordered a flavored latte and the cashier said, ""After all those fun drinks we just talked about? How boring!"" Listen, I understand there should be a certain friendliness you maintain with your customers, but you also need to feel your audience. Some people just know what they want and they want to get whatever it is and leave. The latte was just okay. Weak flavor.

This place has a cool ambiance inside and I can see a lot of people enjoying being here, but customer service can be lacking and while the specialty drinks may be great (I can't say for sure because I haven't tried but my boyfriend did enjoy his), the coffee part of this place is inadequate.",ZSxrOliinraUSicPRiv2xQ,6,2,1,AgZrccgYLhFpRh91IDuZeA

1001085,2016-09-14,0,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"ILLUMILATTE CONFIRMED!

Around 20 minutes away from the strip, this little coffee shop is a go to place for coffee lovers, students and hipsters. The decor is very classic and makes you feel like a cliche poet or writer trying to make a break. Also, don't worry about parking, there are a lot of parking spaces available around the lot. The service here is excellent and because it was my first time the barista was very helpful. She was knowledgeable of all the drinks they offered and provided insight for those who are picky. My sister is a good example of this! She wanted something cold, something not too sweet, something with flavor, but not too bitter. Honestly, it was a pain. Thankfully the barista was patient enough to handle my sister and managed to recommend the shops popular s'mores frappuccino. While I, on the other hand, ordered the illumilatte. She prepared the drinks fast and even drew a cute design on my coffee. 

Now here's the truth. When it comes to coffee shops like this, taste is everything. Normally, these shops import specially grown coffee beans so their coffee has its own taste. The barista also supported this claim. This is why this shop received 4 out of 5 stars. I didn't expect much from my sisters frappe because it didn't have any coffee in it, but my coffee didn't have that uniqueness to it. According to the barista, the coffee I had was their staple, but for me it tasted like any other coffee I've had at other local coffee shops. I was very disappointed, but I have to admit that their frappe was on point. It comes in a milkshake type of glass and it topped with whipped cream, chocolate drizzle and crushed graham crackers. It was delicious and surprisingly wasn't too sweet. If I had to come back I'd come back for the frappes.",qDEubS2KNSJPKfb-CAG_FQ,0,2,4,_k8EkGaTlG6n7wre9rw2fA

However, it is the drinks that hold other worldy powers. They are delicious. Pick any of the specials that they have on the board, and you will be happy. The only weakness I see in this place is the pastry. I have tried the macarons, waffles, and cakes, and I am not so enlightened with them.

Then again I still have their whole menu to experiment :)  I did see that they have hot sandwiches/paninis and Hawaiian Shaved Ice!  Their customer service is on point.  The owner, a nice lady named Sam, took the time to introduce herself to us.  She was really nice and was open to suggestions like possibly having Honey Toast and Vanilla Crepe Mille cake available in their menu.  She said that she would only offer it if she knows how to do it well and she would also like to put her own spin on this yummy treat...I can't wait!

The house latte was perfect, everything a latte should be- tasty espresso flavor, rich foam, and topped with an intriguing foam design. The Truffle frappe was far better than anticipated, blended to perfection with bits of chocolate and coffee that added a wonderful texture to the drink. Beautiful presentation. We got a plain macaroon and, boy, did it pair nicely with our drinks- soft middle with a mild crunch on the outside. It was a little smaller than my palm. Both drinks and cookie, plus tip= $13.something.
We played games, y'all! Oh, they fancy! Hipster feel is real here- but inviting. The decorations are very eye catching, even down to the floor tiles (no joke). The seating varies from private to study group to social and everything in between. It was a rare sight to see and a very pleasantly well done one at that.

Disappointed that I have interest in the 3rd eye and coffee yet... you walk in and it smells like nothing. People say there's a secret to this place and the secret is they don't serve coffee. Long story short. 

Staring at the menu then two ladies greet my girlfriend and I which was nice. Then that was the end of any further exchanging words. Nothing was recommended,  no questions of preferred coffee. Seems to have little knowledge of coffee. Not that I'm a master myself still... promote something enlighten customers. Ordered our drinks and I don't even remember what it was.

We sat at the pac man table area. I was taking notice of all the eye catching things. Chess, art, books, and one of those long tables which soon after I took notice a group occupied the table. They seemed very interest in a lot of things and trying to adapt as much as they could.(I'll get back to this later.)

Well we received our drinks my girlfriend took one sip of her drink and that was it. She put hers down and I tried drinking mine and finishing hers not wanting to be rude. But hers was pure sugar no coffee. You can tell by looking at it there was no coffee. That's all I can say about our drinks. 

Now going back at the group.  They admired all the things I mentioned above then they got their drinks. Wasn't impressed. You can also hear them say not much of coffee. They then ask about the WiFi and the worker comes over to advise it should be working. Gentleman says the connection is limited and she says no it shouldn't be. Walks off shaking her head and the group was left WiFi-less and disappointed. They mumbled other things that could have been better.. haven't seen a review from them yet.. but that sparked my interest to post mine.

Pros: looks dope.
Cons: no coffee, no/bad WiFi connection, okay atmosphere.",gI5rih2YugV4N23tPcGudA,2,1,1,YOiEk7dA12038pwfJMlQBw
1460887,2015-08-09,3,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"Alright this is my hands down favorite coffee shop. It's a modern type of coffeehouse with you're illuminate inspired decor! 

""Only the chosen gets in"" says my cousin, and I believe it is most definitely true. This is a special place for those who are into deep secret conversations and holding down their homework like a boss. It's a badass place honestly, the interior alone says it all. 

Its actually very spacious with outdoor and indoor seating. There's a few couches towards the back near the restrooms for the bigger groups to come through. There's board games placed near the cashier because who doesn't want to play a clever game of chess? The place is very clean and gives off a chill vide with the alternating light colors going against the black and white designed walls. The music was pretty mainstream with your favorite rappers and DJs. 

Their coffee and drinks are served in tall classy glasses which is different for a coffeeshop to do. You also got macarons of different and unique flavors in an XXL size. It fits the palm of my hand! I got the strawberry lemonade macaron and it was delicious! It's a pricey place but it's worth the quality of their food and drinks especially with the bomb interior and the vibes you get. It does give you those ""feeling some type of way"" feels. 

Their workers are also super nice and friendly, they ask if you need anything else and clean up after you. They're on point and great with service. I'm also digging their bathroom, not to mention slender man pouring himself a cup of coffee. 

I'm glad my cousin told me about this place because its near my house and it's convenient! If you're having a hard time finding this place, try again next time because only the chosen get in.

1465575,2017-11-03,4,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"What is up with the oversized hotel furniture?

I've been looking forward to coming here for some time now, and was disappointed with the atmosphere. The name alludes that there is some mystique behind this place and the painted wall is really awesome. BUT that's where the decor and vibe end. The closeout hotel furniture which decreases seating capacity could use a deep clean! Along with knick knacks (which don't even align with the shop's theme) that need dusting and windows/bakery case (with all sorts of fingerprints and crumbs), that need wiping. And, all of this is ironic, considering that as you place your order you can see all of their cleaning products in plain sight (which was also a turn off).

9:45am in the morning and the baked goods look like yesterday's leftovers. Is that because they're open till midnight and don't restock? Additionally, the spot where you access stir sticks and various sugars is very impractical and, my goodness, I would hate to see what this place looks like when there is line, because there's no standing room if you're waiting for a drink and minimal (if any) ideal spot for staff to place drinks for you to grab. 

The manager seemed to know her menu well, though the far end of the menu boards need to be rewritten. My morning tea was fine (though missing the lemon I requested) and I gave an extra star for the tables that can sit four people; I did like the calm mood and lighting too. 

I hope when they change out the dated hotel furniture they still offer tables that can seat four, that's a rare find...and I am sure people are fans of the late night hours. 

But unless I'm jonesing for a coffee at 10 p.m. and have Clorox wipes in my back pocket, I don't think I have a need to come back.",SPo3N__DoDyzryGXWWS1IQ,2,0,3,K5GFR3BXgty7CVGOrUFzhg

Honestly one of the best decisions that I've made to date, I'm a HUGE fan of Cafe's with unique styles, not to mention that the name alone is amusing to me. As soon as I walked in my excitement hit its peak, the art on the wall is the first thing that catches your attention and really you have to take a moment just to admire it. The cashier stand has everything in clear view, you can stand by the side and watch your drinks being made, or take a look at the variety of desserts they have on display! 

On to the Menu, They have a great selection of Frappes/Teas/Iced Illumilatte's (ha) and much much more. Also can't forget the Hand Pressed Paninis, PIZZA, Nutella Croissant, PIZZA, and other snacks they offer if you're feeling a bit hungry. (Did I mention that they had Pizza ?!)

My friend had the Iced White Mocha, it was very delicious! The drink wasn't super bitter or too sweet, complimented by whip cream and Choco sauce, it was very refreshing~
As for me I took the time to check out their Instagram page to see some of the secret menu Items, I was able to find something that caught my attention.

The Elvis. A banana mixed drink with Nutella and Peanut Butter. I'm usually not a huge fan of banana mixed drinks so i usually opt out, but I really wanted to taste what Elvis had to offer because after looking at the picture of it, how could i refuse? Surprisingly the banana wasn't too overwhelming which is something I was hoping for. I was able to catch every flavor in the drink, really well made! Also had a Raspberry Italian soda to-go for myself, wasn't too big on the initial taste but after drinking it for a while I was able to enjoy it. 

Pros: 
- Open during good times (12AM-12PM)
- Good Prices
- Near Bachi Burger so a great place to have dessert after
- Location isn't hard to find
- Comfortable environment 
- Chess/Cards/PacMan machine if you're feeling bored(Beat my friend in chess gg)

Cons
- Small area, I could see this being a problem if more and more people start coming here. 
- Secret Menu is hard to know about if you don't research this place beforehand I understand that it's a ""Secret"" but I would like to see what else they offer without having to ask.


Great place to hang out and study and beat your friends in chess(like me)

Opted for the iced Nutella soy latte- service was quiet but sweet, and the drink was tasty. Needed a bit more mixing, as most of the flavored syrup was clumped near the bottom, but I would give this spot another try. 

There's signage about social media check-in discounts as well as 15% off coupon cards scattered around- grab one on your way to the register. I didn't notice them til after I'd checked in, wish the barista had mentioned the social media discount at check out.

Really like the interior here, menu board advertises free wifi, loos like a chill spot to get some work done over the summer. Didn't see one, but hope they add a cold brew to the menu. This area needs some perking up and Illumillate is a nice start.

1994838,2015-08-18,2,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"Love, love, love coming here to relax or to hang out with friends. Every time I come here wanting to try something new, the baristas always have something to suggest for whatever mood you're in. The menu is quite extensive and is overwhelming at best if you walk in without having an idea for what you want to have, but the staff is always ready to help you decide!

As you've probably already noticed, the interior design of this place is adorable. In my experience, it's one of the best designed coffee establishments in the Las Vegas area because of its unique vibe and comfort (and I've been to quite a few coffee establishments in the LV area.) Every time I bring a new friend, they always mention how they can just sink into the couches in the back and fall asleep.

Here's a rundown of a few of the items I've recently gotten at this place:

(Giant) pistachio macaron (3/5) // Even though the large size seems exciting at first, a few bites in and I had already felt regret buying such a large macaron (and I was even sharing it with my friend!) No way I can ever finish the massive treat full of sugar, but if you ever fill like indulging I say go for it!

Mint chocolate double shot affogato (4/5) // I was pleasantly surprised at how huge the affogato was when they brought it to me! I wasn't exactly sure what the toppings were, but they looked like chocolate biscottis to me. The only problem I had was that the espresso shots were a little too bitter

Andes mint latte (4/5) // It comes with an Andes Mint!!! ~*~olive garden memories~*~ Other than that surprise, the drink itself definitely made me feel like I was drinking an Andes Mint in liquid form. Unfortunately, I don't remember how minty it was, but halfway through it became a bit too chocolate heavy for me to handle.

Generally, the chocolate-y drinks can be a little too sweet for my taste, but any other type of drink have been a pleasure to drink (I've tried the matcha smoothie and it was delicious!) Every time I come back to this place, I always learn about something new that's on the menu (or it's been there and I didn't really pay attention to it until then) so make sure to be open to a wide variety of items from sandwiches, lattes, teas, and desserts!

Whoever painted the mural went hard. Props to them. But the decor didn't translate into the rest of the shop. Okay, okay - most people going there probably haven't spent as much time as me learning about the Illuminate conspiracy - but I thought they would go further into it if they were going to make it a themed place. It fell a bit short of the mark.
The food was also a slight let-down. My blended mint drink was a bit burnt, which I could handle - I typically get decaf, so I'm used to burnt coffee. But then the sandwich was bland, made with packaged lunch meat. Not even the deli counter quality.
The perk was that I got to sit on an extremely comfortable couch the whole time, staring at the mural. However, I think I'm allowed to expect a tiny bit more from the place than nice couches.",8GMPmX7vmViZJuYxfrHTYg,1,0,3,zpX3z5ate-XgyMH3j0fDwA

I learned about his location thru Uber Eats, because they were a featured vendor. So i was curious to try them out in person. The decor, wall mural and comfortable lounge seating all make for an inviting ambience. 

The menu has a variety of signiture drinks and small assortment of cafe food, unfortunately no vegan food options.

My party and I waiting 20 mins before asking where our drinks were. As if the barista forgot she said ""Ohh yeah!!"" And made them quickly. What was ordered was a nutella iced latte woth almond milk and a signiture Illumilatte with almond milk.

As our lattes sat there they separetes into sugar on one end and milk on the other. Where the coffee was... I dont know! Lol very unremarkable and unimpressive.

I love the interior and how there are different types of furniture that an cater to just you or a big party. It seems like a cool place to just hang out because there are games and such. 

The cashier Lotus was very friendly and helpful since I didn't know what to order. I told her I was craving a latte and she suggested an off menu item called the French tourist. Its lavender and dark chocolate & I got it with soy. Loved the suggestion! Tried their Nutella banana bread which was also delicious.

I'll definitely be coming back here again!",bijs3ZYsHIpQ1mNKpKScnA,1,0,5,qn3LZEpYjspT81jyAMUhmA
2502976,2015-07-21,3,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"Where do I start ?..
Ever since I heard about this uniquely themed caf√©, I was very excited to visit, I wanted to take tons of pictures of the mural that covers half the coffee shop.
We got there right when they opened, so we were the first ones in there.
Walking in I was a little taken away by the art, and super excited to try one of there signature coffees. I was extra excited to get my hands on one of the huge macaroons $6 each.  I got the decaf salted caramel Frappuccino, my mom had gotten the decaf salted caramel iced, and my uncle got the java chip Frappuccino. 
We decided to sit in the back with the super comfy couches, I loved the idea of the games you could choose , along with tons of books, and magazines to suit your fancy. I admired the iridescent lights that highlighted the neat mural, it also added affect to your mood, made you feel relaxed.Got up many times to take pictures , and the workers were totally okay with it, they were very friendly.
So now onto the coffee, I was loving the decoration of the coffee, nice tall 24 Oz glass, and cool gold and silver sugar balls on top( plus very generous whipped cream) But that was pretty much it coffee wise, I wasn't super duper impressed, it was ok, I thought I would be wowed by the taste of the salted caramel... but I wasn't, neither was my mom. It didn't taste distinctly like SALTED CARAMEL, but it was good strong coffee, mine seemed to get a little better flavor wise towards the end.. But I was just a little disappointed no caramel drizzled on the top, no salt topped anywhere on the drink. Although, my uncle did love his java chip.Frappuccino, he couldn't get enough.. Needless to say they know how to make good coffee drinks, but what happened to mine ?

 It took me a while to connect to their free Wi-Fi and that's kind of where it all went down-hill... So my mom and uncle had been connected to the Wi-Fi for a while, but it then there was no longer a connection for us , there were only about five other men in the coffee shop having a business meeting.. I tried connecting to the Wi-Fi on my phone and laptop and it wouldn't work at all. So we asked if there was anything wrong with their Wi-Fi? The worker told us that it ""sometimes slows down, and kicks you off if there is a lot of people on the internet."" She also said it was probably because of those 5 people who are having a business meeting."" This was the biggest disappointment, because you go to a coffee shop to relax and take in the atmosphere while embracing the free Wi-Fi ! Plus we were the first people in there, and we got booted off the Wi-Fi... that's not right. 
Also, walking in there was a nice selection of alternative music, but then switched to more mainstream pop which is okay.. but then it was cut entirely.. I don't know if that was because of the Wi-Fi situation. But that was pretty much it for us. We were pretty discouraged at that point and left.
 We were planning on getting another coffee, possibly getting a little sandwich and hanging out a lot longer. But now that there was no Wi-Fi for us, and the music was turned off, the only thing we could hear was the loud business men.
I gave this place three stars because of the limited Wi-Fi plus the music situation, and the disappointing coffee experience.
Don't get me wrong, I love the atmosphere and I could've spent all day here, but the Wi-Fi situation was a downer, and the coffee could have been a better experience. I would definitely love to come here again and give them the place my business, but only if there Wi-Fi situation is fixed.PLEASE GET IT FIXED",-ddbYKMzNc1_0JaQ0_ZqSg,3,2,3,jy3H2laPW7iMn_p9SUYokg
2521680,2015-11-30,0,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"It was my first time at Illumilatte this past Saturday with my friend because of a recommendation.  My friend and I were looking for a late night place to study and be productive.  We arrived at around 8ish or so. At this time, the place wasn't too crowded.  We put our stuff down at the round table at the front to claim our seats because the seats in the back were taken by a group of people. Seemed like this is the place to be.

We go to the counter to look at the menu and immediately the tea service caught my eye.  After telling Lotus, the barista working that night, that we were thinking of getting the tea service, I asked her what flavor she suggested.  She suggested what the employees called, ""the Kelsey,"" named after one of the barista there that combined the Red Fruit and Peach flavors.  We decided to trust her and go along with it.  THE BEST DECISION MADE ALL DAY! It was so good and the amount of refill was perfect for our visit there.  Lotus made sure we were well taken care of during the whole time we were there.  I really appreciated it. She knows how to make sure she has customers coming back to Illumilatte!

A few side thoughts:

- The bathroom is very creatively decorated. I am not sure if people care about that, but it was interesting to look at while i was doing my business in there.

- The long table in the back is very useful from group meetings but the chairs seat really low but really comfy.  I'm not sure if the comfy-ness outweighs super low chairs but its a non-issue for me.

- I guess on Friday and Saturday nights, the hookah lounge next door is poppin'. Its really annoying when the ambiance of a coffee shop is supposed to be chill. And the clientele of that  hookah lounge brought in some weird people.  For example, two males that reeked of ganja.  Not impressed. But hey, what can you do about that?

Honestly, this place in itself is probably 4 stars on its own.  But the customer service experienced from Lotus is what pushes it to 5 stars. Thank you, Lotus! We'll be back.",X_8rqYMhpqIK3K1tbdDOXA,0,0,5,DX20m4WeFNsHMEDnvs48qA

The London Fog is an earl grey latte. The latte tasted a bit bland for my taste. It did have a subtle hint of earl grey so tasted more like a creamy tea than it did a latte.

2651243,2017-01-24,1,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"When illumilatte first opened I absolutely loved it. We would come 1-2 times a week pretty consistently, we would post photos on our social media pages to get 10% or 20% off (whatever the promotion was I forget since it has been so long). We stopped going because I would get terrible headaches from the lights constantly changing - you don't really notice it but it can mess with your eyes. Headaches are definitely not a way to study so we stopped going. This was maybe a year ago, maybe less I really cannot remember I just know it was when they were still a new establishment. 

Now let's just go to today (1/23/17)- it was not busy when my sister-in-law and I came in to do some studying. We both ordered a drink and a food item. My food took a while to come out - I really did not notice until the girl who was working apologized and told me my next drink was on her (sweet!) we were there for almost three hours. Some complaints- The wifi disconnected me on the hour every hour which is fine because I understand the bandwidth and all that jazz so it did not bother me too much but when I'm in my zone and my music stops it is a little bothersome. But this issue I completely understand so I won't even take that into consideration with my three star review. 
My main complaint is the customer service. The staff is overall friendly but I just got rubbed the wrong way not once, not twice, but THREE times. First time was when I got up and asked for some water and the girl who was working just looked at me like ""is there not water in the thing right there?"" if I knew there was water offered right there do you think I would have asked? I know she didn't mean to come off as rude but it did come off as rude instead she should've mentioned that the water was self serve and located next to the registers instead of asking me if it was empty because I don't know and if I did I would've said something about it being empty. The next time was after I used the restroom and there were no paper towels- I washed my hands and noticed no paper towels so I walked over to the registers and asked for a paper towel and let them know that they were out in the restroom instead of offering me a paper towel she said ""sorry I'll fix it now"" I had to ask for a paper towel twice to dry my hands. Again not a big deal to me it's just that I had already asked and she ignored it and wanted to go straight to the bathroom to refill it. And the last weird encounter tonight is the big reason for me writing this review. Please let me start off by saying I used to really like this place, I spent a good chunk of money here when they first open and just stopped going because of how the lights affected me. So remember how I mentioned earlier about getting a drink on the house? Before leaving I walked up to the register and ordered a small drip coffee to go (and note I was ordering with the SAME girl who offered me a free drink) and she told me I owed $2.something. I did not mention anything about the free drink she offered me like two or three hours ago and just paid it and was on my way. No reason to complain over less than $3 but it's still the principle. Why offer me a free drink and when I go up to redeem and still end pay for it? 

Long story short: I came in and got weird service multiple times, was offered a free drink, yet still had to pay for said ""free drink"".",s1ZTkHxh0I0hFA9dI2pQMQ,3,0,3,966hfl2fcob0st1Z9suxFg

2662725,2015-08-15,62,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"The chai latte here tastes like water & service is fake with a splash of attitude. What the heck man? We are completely dissatisfied with the quality of the drinks and the level of service here. What a waste since the concept of Illuminlatte Brew Society is killer.

We ordered a large iced chai latte and
asked if it could be made extra spicy; the cashier explained that it will definitely be spicy since they use a strong masala spice chai. When tried our chai, we were immediately confused since it tasted like water.

After we explained to the cashier & the barista/owner that the chai was too watery for us, the owner said she would remake it. Shockingly, the second batch was just as watery as the first round. The other 2 in my party said to just forget it, cut our losses, leave the drink and head to another coffee spot. My conscience struggled with this, so I told my party that I think it would be fair to give them one last shot. You know, third times a charm?

Man do I regret saying that!!! We kindly
explained to the barista/owner for the second time that the chai here is probably not for us and that we are thinking about canceling the chai all together to try one of their signature drinks: Java Truffle Frappe. When the owner told us the full price of the drink, we said we would be happy to pay the difference, (wrong step.) She then said with frustration, ""you know what, it's on me."" - topped with an extra insincere tone and impatient body language.

Let's just say this, our last ""signature"" drink was ok. Not great, but it would suffice. We even nudged our friend to buy a drink, since he was hesitant. We also went out of our way to walk up to the counter to thank the owner and what do you know - she continued her fed-up charades, rolled her eyes at us and nodded her head with her back towards us.

Really!? You don't think we can see your attitude coming through loud and clear? Might as well just kick us out and slam the door on our face while you're at it. This was an incredibly passive aggressive experience. I'm in disbelief that for someone who is trying to build business, carry with them so much attitude. It was a very immature reaction to constructive criticism about their product.

While we were waiting outside for our
friend to get his drink made, our drink started to melt and quickly all we tasted was sugar - It was a serious sugar bomb. 5 sips into it, it made us feel sick. Our tastebuds coated in sugar, we tossed it. It's not a balanced coffee drink as the cashier explained; it's an extremely sweet dessert drink with no trace of coffee.

My friend took a few sips of his blended
drink and tossed it as well. His drink was overwhelmed with whipped cream filler that did nothing for him. He also noted that the ""barista"" here has a lot to learn about how to deal with adding an extra shot of expresso into a cold blended drink - their techniques here need work.

After our failed attempt to give them a fair last chance, we finally understood that we won't win either way here. My whole party was burned, by who else but the owner. I would never recommend that anyone receive attitude with mediocre drinks like we did today. Tread lightly.

P.S. The cashier received a nice tip from my friend as she was an innocent bystander.",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,75,63,1,rT0L1vZerfhUBItnJkJFDQ

So this morning I am suuuuper excited to bring my mom here for the first time and its SUPER dead, there is a woman at the counter that Ive never seen before, I express my excitement to her and explain that this is my new favorite coffee place, we order two cold brews with heavy whip.. which they were out of... okay,thats okay.. she seemed irritated that we were bummed out about the heavy whip which was weird. I also ordered two turkish double shots, which I was excited about and have had before else where. (Hence my excitement)

So our black cold brews come out ... along with our turkish coffee... the turkish coffee smelled and tasted of rust and tap water. As we were on our way out i placed the coffee we couldnt drink on the counter and when she asked if we didnt like it, I kindly said no it tasted odd.. i am never rude to anyone unless provoked.. and instead of demonstrating good customer service she told me that  other people like it and was annoyed with us even voicing our opinion... if it was starbucks they would of made us something else... jus saying

I ordered a lavender chocolate latte, an avocado spinach quiche, and a lemon chicken wrap. All 3 items were way better than the average coffee shops fixings. I honestly didn't know what to expect from quiche because it had been so long, but wow it was heaven. It was juicy, flavorful, reheated to perfection.

My favorite part about this place though is their service. They brought water pitchers for the table; they removed plates and cups as needed, and the staff was happy to service the board game crew.

Maybe it was the fact there was NO music playing in the background, or that there were random shelves and furniture placed here and there.  Personally I don't like when  you present yourself as one thing and then put other influences in your business.  Take away the Buddha head, the random shelves and definitely no magazines laying around (although I don't mind the Las Vegas Weekly, Rated or Seven magazines sitting in a rack by the door) to which there wasn't any.  Why not put pics of celebs doing the Illuminati symbols to go with the theme they are obviously trying to spoof.  How about  an owl, Skull and Cross Bone Society symbol, the American dollar, the Masonic symbol etc.  But don't do like some restaurants do, they get a bunch of crap around the counters and it looks like their storage closet from home, not professional at all.  Clean the clutter behind the counter and make it look really like a cool place to hang. Also what up with that goofy display case on the wall on the right when you first walk in?  Are you trying to sell something or display something?  I would take that out and if you had stuff to sell put it on one of those digital picture frames that keep moving.  I guess they are new and still trying to get established, but seriously be true to the theme.  Also get rid of the macaroons, put some legit food in your food case.

I came here with my husband after having dinner down the street and we were just going to get a couple drinks to go, but the interior was nice and inviting, so we decided to have our drinks at a table instead. I got the Mexican Mocha, half sweetened and my husband got the Lavendar Milk tea, iced. They had a selection of desserts and we ordered a Nutella cheesecake to share. We sat at a large table in the back with a chess board on it and ended up playing a game of chess while sipping on our drinks. They were actually out of their Mexican Mocha mix, but the barista substituted with mocha and cinnamon instead, which ended up being delicious. The drink gave me a much needed boost of energy for the night shift with my 2 month old baby. My husband loved his lavendar milk tea and finished it pretty fast. It had a nice floral/honey taste to it and came in a tall glass. The nutella cheesecake looked a little old, but nonetheless, it was still rich and tasty and a pretty good deal for only 3 bucks.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,3,2,4,UUcAM2j5aOKvhbHOXCY9bQ

Illumilatte Brew Society is tucked away in a shopping center that is also home to Bachi Burger, a hookah lounge and a few other Vegas strip mall staples. When you first walk in you'll notice a massive wall mural with pictures of the Illuminate logo, space ships and other conspiracy filled propaganda. It's gorgeous. 

Coffee time! - When ordering take notice of the coffee selections offered, most of the caffeinated beverages here are made stronger than the average corporate chain brew. Definitely ask the brew-master behind the counter before carelessly ordering drinks; you could be awake for the next couple of days. 

I ordered the iced vanilla latte and espresso. Yowza, this drink was strong, I'm glad I went with the vanilla option otherwise this would be a very ""bitey"" cup of joe. Beyond the first initial sip, this coffee actually smoothed out as I drank it, or my taste buds simply surrendered. The espresso was slightly bitter and surprisingly smooth, seeing a trend here? I eventually mixed the two together and lapped up the remaining liquid like a thirsty coffee-feigning K-9.

I ordered the Turkey Pesto Panini with Sriracha. This took quite a long time, to get made, about fifteen minutes to be exact, but I'll chalk that up to working out the ""new shop kinks"". The sandwich was good, the bread lacked that good panini crunch and the pesto flavor could have been more abundant, but overall it wasn't bad. I might try something else next time... Oh, and there will be a next time! 

I love the name of this place. The Freemasons, The Illuminati, intrigue me and anything else that triggers my coffee fueled paranoia... Did we land on the moon? Nope, I heard it was a sound stage in New Mexico. ;)

I came here to meet my friend to study and again, the thing I like about Illuminlatte are the comfy couches. I also noticed that they have games towards the back shelf near the bathroom as well. 

The worker clearly did not seem happy to be working there. My friend asked for a suggestion between the panini and the quesadilla and was told that they're the same. Maybe my friend should have asked, which one is more popular... idk. After hearing that, I was afraid to ask for suggestions from their menu. 

2/5 iced vanilla latte with whip cream. Pretty basic but I went on someone else's recommendation on Yelp. I'm glad I was offered the option of whipped cream but it wasn't the BEST vanilla latte I've ever had. The coffee wasn't strong, the drink wasn't very sweet and felt watered down to me. Yes I am aware that it is iced so the ice would water it down but even the first few sips were just eh. 

1/5 chicken quesadilla. It came with plain potato chips and the quesadilla was interesting. I ate half of it so I think the chicken may not have been distributed equally because I only got two small pieces of chicken. It also had a sour hint to it which I didn't like very much. Maybe it would have tasted better when it was hot. I didn't eat it until a while after we ordered it. 

I noticed that a lot of people come in to just chat or do artwork. The music was nice, not very loud. I'd say it's still a really good place to study but the I'm not too fond of the drinks or the service when there are so many coffee shops in town. Also, bathroom was out of paper towels and extremely low on hand soap. Or maybe the soap dispenser was jammed because I had to press it very hard and repeatedly for any soap to come out.

On my previous visit... 
customer service was great. Friendly and helpful cashier. 

I was told the dark & white chocolate or the Andes mint were quite popular. I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate so I didn't get it. 

3/5 The toffee nut was perfect in terms of sweetness. I did get a bit of a burnt aftertaste that reminded of the caramel macchiato from Starbucks but not as burnt. I got it to go so I did not stay long.",ukkRTJLkQTx95fCalVn6BA,1,1,2,sNdCerNTP-imXzPWRYqMPg

Well I have been exceptionally pumped about this cafe ever since I heard of its illuminati theme :-) The interior is pretty hip and the wall arts are iconic. 
Sadly enough, Illumilatte used to sell large macarons with cool flavors but now their display case is full of desserts like normal sized macarons to rose meringue sandwiches with chocolate ganache filling. They also have more filling things on the menu such as paninis, and they just added salads onto the menu, too.
Well I've had their signature Illumilatte drink and despite the heat, I do order it hot (it just tastes delicious hot).

If you enjoy coffee for its flavor, this is not the place to go. Many of their drinks are really sugary, which could be fine if you're looking for that. It's more of a place for a group of friends to chill and hang out over some dessert and stuff, rather than a place to study.

I came in to study after seeing the poor reviews about Internet, so I picked a day I didn't need Internet to study just in case. Boy am I glad. Internet was completely useless. But I was really just there for a fresh scene, so I was still able to get work done.

My two favorite drinks here are the Iced Nutella Latte and the Mexican Hot Chocolate. If you like chocolatey/sweet drinks, then these might be super tasty for you. My favorite food item now is the chicken quesadilla.

3666732,2017-01-11,1,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"I was looking for coffee places that are in the local side while visiting Las Vegas and I happened to catch this creative sign to get my latte and study on.  Unfortunately, I arrived at the last hour before closing, but I was still able to enjoy my drink while listening to beautiful music on open mic night, which occurred on certain Sundays.  Finding the place was not too difficult since it was next door to Vegas-based Bachi Burger, a great favorite that extended to a couple of places in California but they shuttered in 2016.  

Upon entering the place, I was impressed with the creative decorations appearing on the walls all over the room and the restroom.  There was an area of the room for tables and chairs to study or work on projects and another area for cozy couches, a long table for games, and seating to watch and listen to people performing their talents out during open mic nights.  The cozy couches reminded me of ""Friends"" as a place to chill and hang out over coffee!  As for the outlets, which are important for those long studying hours, there were plenty to be found at Illumilatte Brew Society.

I ordered their popular illumilatte, a black and white latte that tasted delicious.  Service was mostly okay.  I didn't receive my latte until 15 minutes after I ordered when I had to ask them where my drink was.  It was a busy night when many drink orders were being made for a large group so I understand.

3666823,2015-07-15,4,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"Another coffee shop in the neighborhood, YAYYYYY! 

I really wanted to like this place because who doesn't like the whole mystery of Free Masons and The Ilumminate --- and in coffee form??!!!
Yet, I found their drinks to be ""for people who don't like real coffee"" as my boyfriend would say it. 

Then again, maybe we just ordered the wrong things. 

Service was great as (I believe) the owner rang us up. She was very helpful and courteous. 

Ambiance is stellar. Super hipster. GREAT black and white art on the wall -- although the idk how this place got labelled as an art gallery. Lighting in the back changed from orange to red to yellow, which kept our area lit well. Great soft sofas; our area had vintage a Ms. Pacman arcade as our table. 
This place would be ideal if I was in college and in study groups! 

As soon as I saw Andes candies as an ingredient in a drink -- I knew that was the one for me. I added an extra shot of espresso to that, which cost $2.50. 
Boyfriend got the Nutella and butterfinger macaron. 
Overall we paid $22 on 2 coffees and a macaron. 

The macaron was gigantic. And they had a large array of flavors! Crunchy and soft. I liked it a lot. But, quite LARGE for me or him alone. 

My 16oz was bigger than expected, which was good. But so sweet that I didn't really taste the espresso. It basically didn't taste strong enough for me. I did like the side of Andes candies. 

As soon as my BF got his drink, he knew he ordered the wrong thing. For his part, he normally likes unsweetened coffee so he (nor I) doesn't know why he ordered the Nutella. He was hesitant in returning the drink but, I told him to just exchange it for his regular (his drink of choice is ice coffee black with a shot of espresso, no sweetener of any kind). 

He got his ""regular"" and the girl said ""if you need more sweetener, there's some on the side."" 
To which I said, ""more???"" He didn't want any sweetener or creme but, they had put creme in there. 

After that he just had a bad taste in his mouth and was just upset that he paid $12 (for his part) on something that he didn't like. 

Like I said this is not the place for people who like coffee. This is a specialty sweet coffee kinda place. Not to say that I won't be back with other friends but, this first impression wasn't a great one =(",uERlyO-ASZag6XXouCrkhg,5,3,3,LyEMy18plAFwkgaX3OYnVQ

Walked in and I was immediately impressed by the interior. Loved the comfortable seating with intriguing artwork. Great spot to study with free-wifi. 

There was one lady working and she was taking care a family of five, bringing one drink at a time to them. It seemed inefficient but we patiently waited.  She had absolutely no smile on her face and talked like a robot. Not a good vibe. 

I ended up getting their golden milk and matcha milk. Total came out to be around $10.

Golden milk: Wow, sounds like one amazing drink. I mean ""GOLDEN milk"" ? Bish pls. I will tell you all, there is nothing ""golden"" about the color or taste. It just tasted like 2% fat milk you can get at any grocery store. Good business charging a whooping $4 for a small cup. 1/5

Matcha milk: Didn't have that authentic bitter matcha taste. It had an unpleasant artificial flavor and was extremely powdery and sweet. 2/5

After our lack luster let down of a visit to Bad Owl (See Review) last Sunday I had some trepidation about venturing outside my normal coffee shop circle to try this place out.

I am so glad we did!

Incredibly appealing visually. You can tell they have a set theme and they ran with it. Very Hipster/Millennial vibes. 

They had a vast menu of adorably named smoothies, frappes, espressos, and lattes. Plus they had a small but enticing selection of food options as well.

S'Mores Frappe (16oz)- 5/5 Cost me about $5.00 which is the average cost of a frappe in that medium size range. Perfectly blended, great flavor, and beautiful presentation.

Andes Mint Iced Latte (24oz)- 3/5 Cost her around $6.00. And while she loved it it was a little too strong for my liking. If you are a big coffee drinker you will probably enjoy but it was just not for me.

Grilled 4 Cheese Panini- 5/5 Amazing taste! Huge portion for what i paid plus they serve it with house made potato ships on the side! Will definitely be back for this!

Illuminati Cookie- 4/5 Cute and unique to this spot. Good flavor and not dry!

We also ordered a couple macarons (hazelnut, raspberry, and lemon) to snack on. I'm not sure if they're made in-house, but they were really good. Actually except the lemon. It was so lemon-y, it tasted like a cleaning solution. Not even the munchkins wanted to eat it.

The name of the coffee and being located next to a hookah lounge should should already hint at the hipster vibe this place gives. Artwork adorns the walls, plenty of comfortable seats to relax in, and an array of boardgames to choose from.

Walking in, I was immediately overwhelmed by the amount of choices they had. Since it had been my first time, I decided to ask the barista behind the counter of any recommendations she may have. However, I seemed to have disrupted her more-important conversation with the UPS (or FedEx, if it really matters) guy and her friends. Met with an ice-cold stare, she proceeded to then tell me that ""all the drinks we have our awesome"". With an eye-roll, she continued on her conversation with the two. Oh. Well, then.

Being into the Halloween/fall spirit, I decided to try their hot seasonal pumpkin latte. After receiving my drink and taking a sip, I immediately noted the lack of ""hot"" in my hot drink. I also had a hard time detecting the taste of pumpkin anywhere. However, I had no problem tasting the humongous amount of sugar inside the drink. Not wanting to be rude, I tried mustering up the ability to drink the diabetes in a cup, but I called it quits no more than a few more sips in when I started to feel nauseated.

Maybe it was a bad batch. I would've been more than happy to ask for a remake if the barista stopped talking to her friends and shut her phone off for more than a few seconds.

4126161,2017-01-09,1,HaWU8ICNtjIkCN_ZNrx1hw,"Came by here for an impromptu coffee stop after dinner Friday night.  From the outside the place looks small but once we got inside the toasty coffee shop (which was super nice after the chilly walk from our car) I saw ample space for people to lounge around and enjoy their drinks.  There was plenty of chairs and tables to sit at and towards the back comfortable couches you could relax in too.  Illumilatte also provides free games and books for their patrons to utilize.  We only intended to stop in for a few minutes but once we sat down in the comfortable space we ended up spending 4-5 hours there chit chatting/enjoying the coffee shop.  Staff was super friendly and I never felt rushed or pressured to leave even when we were getting up to leave a couple minutes before closing.  Two things I wasn't too crazy about this place was that our drinks were served in paper cups instead of cute glassware like in the photos I've seen.  Also around 10 pm the hookah lounge's blaring music next door can be heard but that's something Illumilatte can't really control anyways.         

We ordered:
-The Illumilatte 16 oz. (around $4.95) - My friend ordered this and I had a taste and it was good!  From the menu board description it was a mixture of black and white latte and had good flavor to it.   
-The Mexican Mocha 16 oz. (around $4.50) - This tasted exactly like a churro in a cup, it was absolutely delicious!  I do wish I had gotten a smaller size though because as time went on and as the drink got colder the drink got too a little too sweet for me.  Next time I'll just have to drink faster ;)   

Overall, I enjoyed my experience and will definitely be back! Be sure to check in on Yelp for 10% off too!",hgfqysg2htnJI5bvtIIUjg,3,4,4,IyL1hYO5fzoA0Gf-74imsQ

The brewed coffee has been hit or miss. It's been luke warm a couple of times, but they've warmed it up for me. This place is definitely a coffee shop and not for food. They seem to always be missing ingredients or forgetting things. No tomatoes one day, no pesto another, no toilet paper next. For $7 the pesto turkey paninini was pretty disappointing. The turkey was salty processed sandwich meat. 
I love Illumilatte for the study atmosphere. The music isn't too loud (acoustic pop songs) and there isn't any loud blenders distracting you. The communal table has outlets under the table.

I like that they don't blast their music and what's playing is more relaxing than upbeat.
Drinks do take a while to come out, especially when it's packed, so be patient. Lattes and frappes ive gotten seem to be on the sweeter side, so be sure to ask them to make it less sweet if you don't have much of a sweet tooth. They are quite accommodating to your drink and give you recommendations when you can't decide. Baristas are all very sweet. 
Swap out milk with soy for $0.50. 
My favorite drink is the CREAM green tea frappe, which includes matcha and macadamia and is quite filling. The Y.D.D (yabba dabba doo) is popular, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you enjoy drinking your fruity pebbles.",e3c6w6sM8sJ_g0IlF6CSog,4,3,4,89r3p6CEI0RIVdjHq9IWoQ

The price points for their food and their coffee are VERY reasonable. I ordered the sriracha chicken wrap which came with a side salad for $6 and a pour over with almond milk for $3.25. Side note: they were out of a lot of items- several food items on their menu and cold brew which I wanted to order, BUT the friendly and knowledgeable barista offered to make the pour over instead which was delish!

It was something along the lines of a mix of peach passion and red fruit passion teas. The perfect flavors for me. I also ordered a berry yogurt shooter which she brought over to the table I was set up at.

I was ultimately looking to get some work done on my computer. I took a small table with only two chairs. I worked away for about an hour and it started getting really crowded. A group of what I believe to be 10 people came in all at once, excited to hang out and see each other but the only option they had for seating (since it is on a first come first serve basis) was the other two really small tables with two chairs exactly like my table right beside me in the corner. So here were 10 people crammed into the corner next to me having fun and enjoying each other's company. Don't get me wrong, I am not complaining about them. I was just a little upset that I could no longer study and keep to myself and listen to my study music playing through my headphones so I immediately packed my things and took my drink to go.

I ordered a pour-over coffee and a turkey pesto sandwich. It did take about 30 minutes but I was outside soaking up some sun, so I didn't mind.

When its in a to go cup, its seriously only 70% filled. 30% is just foam. Kind of annoying because once I pick my cup up, its obviously NOT full. 

Sigh. I like this place but I haven't been happy. Also, I feel they add way too much sugar now. What happened?

One more thing... the later shift crew seem a bit better than the earlier crew. Earlier crew is kind of fake with a splash of tude.

It's not just the expertly crafted coffee that brings you in, they also have a variety of fresh brewed tea, pastries, and hand made paninis. 

Really enticing environment inspired by the Illuminate/free masons theory. Eclectic art by local artists on the walls and impressive lighting and artifacts. While you're waiting for the baristas to bring you your selected vice of choice you can read any of the many interesting books on the shelves. The couches are heavenly clouds to lounge on and there are also a variety of games such as chess, checkers, dominos, cards, and a multi video game arcade table soon to be set up!

The decor and ambiance is A+. I like how the seats are super comfortable as well, which is something that I sometimes see lacking in other coffee shops. I can see this place getting really busy as more people start learning about it, but it's been really mellow every time that I've gone so far.

For drinks, I've tried a couple of frappes, a latte, and tea. I have yet to be disappointed. Also, whenever I ask for any adjustments (I like my drinks on the sweeter side), they always accommodate. For food, I get the chicken panini on a croissant and provolone cheese, and it's a nice meal to have during lunch. I've also had the smores waffle which is also delicious little desert to share. I think the prices are reasonable and comparable to other non-franchise coffee shops. 

I definitely see myself going here a lot, no matter what time of year. I always feel welcomed by Sam, the owner, and her staff.

It's hard to get anything but my go to lavender milk tea but when I do the French tourist is great so is the Moroccan mint milk tea or I guess latte. Their grilled cheese is delicious and they have a lot of healthy and inexpensive food. Perfect for a cafe! They also make a variety of homemade pastries and desserts. Always something new to try here!

The customer service is great. They always know me even since the beginning when I first started coming here. They pay attention to their customers and regulars and make relationships with them. They always remember my drink down to the size and type of milk (almond!). If you love feeling like a regular somewhere this is the place for that!

The decor is awesome too. The couches chairs and tables are all Mismatched but in a cool vintage looking way. Also they have books and games! So the part that stands out the most about the decor is the big painted murals on the wall. It incorporates illuminate theme with coffee but it's so cool to stare at. The bathroom is just as cool and has interesting thought provoking sentences on it. You'll always discover something new about the art on the walls.

LOVING the creative name. Anything Illuminati intrigues me. If you're like me, you'll love the interior walls here. Great spot to write, study, hold meetings to take over the world, or just chill. They have big comfy sofas and a bookshelf with a variety of books. Love the owls as well. 

Was looking forward to trying the turkish coffee, but I went at 8pm-ish. I didn't need to be up all night. So next time I'll get there earlier and try it. 

Instead I had the Red Fruit Passion Tea. It's a $5 Tea Service that comes with a tea pot filled with tea of choice (they have a variety of flavors). Also includes a free refill and up to 4 cups. It was more than enough to share among 3 people. 

The Red Fruit Passion Tea, is a blood red color and very sweet. Not recommended if you just ate a load of desserts. Which we did, no beuno. Will be back for that turkish coffee, I'll need it to take over the world.",825Ol4rTvAZnUyFMke37jA,7,7,4,52YQZOneGXosjGZQiNntUg

I heard this place made super sweet drinks so I asked if they can make it less sweet and it came out perfect. I also was intrigued by the large macarons they have and had to get the mint chocolate one! My best friend and I couldn't even finish one and we shared! It was so sweet but the texture was on point! One thing that stood out to me was one of the woman that was working was super nice and made sure everyone was enjoying their drinks and food. It took kind of a while to get our drinks and they forgot our macaron until I asked for it. It was understandable though because they were short staffed and had a lot of orders to me. I'm a very understanding person so that didn't really bother me that much but I'm sure would bother most impatient customers. Also, it was already hitting midnight where most places get bothered by customers who stay later than operating hours but the woman was still very sweet and made sure everyone was okay.

While the couches are comfortable for chatting with friends, I came back a second time with my husband to study and found the large dining table to be a little uncomfortable. The large table is convenient with the installed outlets between each chair, but the seating is a little too low (extremely low, if you choose the larger chairs at the head of the table). 

The employees are quite friendly and willing to help you choose a drink. They are good at suggesting which non-dairy alternative goes with what drink. However, I did not experience a drink that I absolutely loved. They were all just ""ok."" I tried the Andes Mint and the London Fog (earl grey latte). The giant macarons are fun and my sisters raved over the sandwiches (I will second that the pesto sandwich is quite flavorful!).

I had the salted caramel frappe and a giant pistachio macaron. I must say, the salted caramel frappe was exactly what I had expected it to be: sweet and that hint of saltiness that you can kinda notice which really balances the drink out. It's served in a tall glass, which (to me) makes the drink taste that much better. The macaron was so good and it's bigger than most macarons I see in other coffee shops! They also have a variety of these colorful confections that go well with any drink you decide to get -- hot or cold.

The staff is all super friendly and very personable. Who doesn't like big smiles and casual small talk with their barista?

As for the interior, the main wall (and the bathroom walls) are a cool black-and-white mural filled with illuminati/conspiracy-related imagery. It's super cool to look at, and it's even better to witness at night when the lights in the room change from color to color. They have such a chill vibe going on there, that it's impossible for you to not enjoy yourself. Plus, they have a good amount of seating (with soft, COMFORTABLE couches)! 

The place is great for groups or you can just roll in here solo, either way you're gonna like how everything is here.

Was here once from around 9pm until closing time with my laptop trying to get some work done, but the place became extremely loud and crowded, mostly traffic from the next door hookah lounge, making it incredibly difficult to get anything done. But was there on a different night around the same time and it was quiet with many others on their laptops. It's usually not too crowded during the day, but many times I've been usually there is only one person working. Went around noon one time and the place was only half-full, but service was very slow and took quite a while for the drink to come out. 
The drinks are okay. I don't usually order anything sweet, more so just coffees or teas. Had an iced chai once and it was very watered down. I don't usually like returning drinks but because they did verbally offer to make any adjustments, I thought why not and asked for a remake of the chai. The second round was better, but I wouldn't get it again.
I would probably only come here during the day, since nights are either a hit or miss on crowds and noise. It's a good place to stop by every once in a while, especially if you enjoy the selection of board games they provide.

The first time I got the grasshopper latte, I think that was its name, basically a chocolate mint latte, it was alright, even after the barista asked me if I liked it and offered to change it up, I got a pump more mint and still wasn't overly impressed. The service was fantastic and the grilled cheese was AMAZING. Probably one of the best I ever had.

We stopped in at this new coffee spot with the awesome name last Saturday around 6:00pm. Located off of Russell and Rainbow in the same plaza as Bachi Burger, the cafe was totally empty at that time, save for one friendly barista.  Decorated in such a way that invites you to bring your electronic devices (or one of those things called a book) and stay awhile, there is free WIFI and lots of seating.  From smaller tables and a community table to several comfortable couches that you sink into, there was even my favorite video game, Ms. PacMan (it wasn't plugged in, though.)  The menu boasts a plethora of coffee options as well as some pastries, but I went with my boring standard, a cinnamon latte with almond milk.  The boyfriend had a cold brew coffee and we both enjoyed our drinks.  I'd definitely come back and spend more time here, have another latte, and hopefully play a game or two of Ms. PacMan if it's working then.  Enlighten yourselves and pay Illumilatte a visit.

+ Service is always great. The owner and employees are friendly and accommodating.

+ Convenience is the main reason I bumped Illumilatte to 4/5. I live extremely close, it closes pretty late, there's wifi, and you can study there for as long as you want.

+ Chill vibes. Had to be mentioned! 

- Drinks...If only the drinks were good here more people would love this place. However, drinks are extremely hit or miss. Avoid anything sweet or blended. I stick to just the tea, tea lattes, and black coffee (which is mediocre at beast).

Most of the menu is not appetizing but I found what I liked and stick to it. Thanks to the tea lattes and convenient location, I don't find Illumilatte too bad. If I did not live so close, I probably would not come here.",QzXS25_FwIUrYTyDMZkUQA,5,2,4,SsloHGCb4j3tY_Zk702PhA

The atmosphere of this place is very soothing. Seeing people playing chess, reading a book, catching up, and studying. It's very chill. Definitely love the decorations and the painting on the walls. The couches on the back were very comfortable as well. Ended up sitting there with a group of friends for hours without even realizing it. 

The service was amazing. She was very helpful and patient with my indecisive self since there were many options to choose from. From macaroons, coffee and tea, and sandwiches.. she helped me figure out what I really wanted haha. I ordered the YDD since it was in colorful lettering. The YDD was definitely something I never tried before. I'm a die hard fan of green tea, but to mix that with fruity pebbles? Oh my god. Who thought of that? Such a genius! Since I was also hungry, I also ordered the turkey panini with pesto and cheddar cheese (you can pick your own cheese) on a bagel.The cashier and her colleague recommended me to put garlic butter on my bagel, so I did. They were completely right on how delicious it was! 

Oh and also, don't forget to check the black board for their specials on top of the baked goodies. My friends found something they liked there and ordered the Nutella waffle sandwich which consists of waffles drenched in Nutella, and mint chocolate chip ice cream. Not a big Nutella fan, but if you are, highly recommended.

I was driving home from my boyfriends house one morning and decided to stop in and grab a latte. 

I walked in, and loved the decor. It has such a chill vibe, and I was greeted immediately by the two ladies behind the counter. 

Looking at the menu, I was kind of taken aback. They have the traditional lattes, but they also had a gingerbread latte, Andes mint latte, and the original illumilatte. I was very tempted to get the original, but the Andes latte jumped out at me. 
I ordered my latte, and was given a punch card. 

The only thing I didn't like was that the hot lattes only come in two sizes. And to spend nearly $5 for a 14 oz latte seems a little excessive, when I can get a large latte at Starbucks for thirty cents more.

I ordered a toffeenut latte with almond milk. The barista was extremely friendly throughout our interaction with each other and even told me to let her know if the drink was any good. All in all, it was a good experience for my first time trying a place out. Very professional attitude and exceptional customer service.

The iced latte I got was similar from what you would get at Starbucks. It was delicious but not memorable enough for me to crave it again. The hot latte my girlfriend got was also delicious but I wasn't a fan of its presentation. The foam was a bit on the lighter side which was not the typical latte I was used to seeing. As in, you could hardly see the design incorporated to it. 

The rep behind the counter was an interesting employee. I couldn't tell if she hated to help us or she was indifferent about working there.
