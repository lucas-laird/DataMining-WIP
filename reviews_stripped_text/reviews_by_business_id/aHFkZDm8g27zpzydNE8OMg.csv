I purchased a Groupon for 7 Sinful Subs, and today was my first visit. 

I split the Knuckle Sandwich with my dining companion. We also shared the stack o' coins and the mac and cheese. We opted for the lettuce, mayo, tomato, and vinaigrette to come on the side, as I am not a fan of any of these things on a hot sandwich. We also opted to order the sandwich with their hot sauce. 

The hot sauce came in a tiny container on the side. We could have used more, but it was really good. It was the perfect addition to this sandwich. 

The sandwich itself is packed full of meat. The bread is soft but stands up to the toppings. I enjoyed it. 

The stack o' coins was unexpectedly awesome. I really enjoyed the level of spice, and the potatoes were not soft, not crunchy. 

The mac and cheese was the only disappointment. The potato chips were a nice addition to the top, but the mac and cheese lacked flavor. It needed an additional, stronger cheese or something.

Overall, I would go back. The food is solid, and the service is stellar.",cgUCtSaxZ4Mt_3k691UU2A,1,2,4,YeZ923_ZKc8SG_FdvY3teg

Seating: 2 side walls had high counter top with bar stools (nose bleed seats), rest is square table with heavy-duty plastic armless chairs

She apologized for the wait and said that if no one was at the front, I could yell out for someone because theyre all in the back. Well, what does that tell me about their customer service then? Maybe I'll come back and re-review this place because the sandwhiches we got (knuckle sandwich and skinny dip) were actually very delicious but not enough for me to change my ranking at this moment.

1448075,2016-09-12,15,aHFkZDm8g27zpzydNE8OMg,"Are you hungry enough for a knuckle sandwich? Well, come and get it!
The restaurant name is literal: there are only seven sandwiches on their menu. On the bright side, the portion sizes are huge and the prices are low, so they definitely picked the right location across the street from UNLV. I can see this being a huge hit with students with limited income. 

The knuckle sandwich contains grilled salami, pepperoni, and ham with melted mozarella, topped with what appears to be a small salad of lettuce, tomato, and champagne vinaigrette. I actually really enjoyed the salad part, which was fresh and helped offset the overall heaviness of the sandwich and also the overwhelming saltiness. Perhaps leaving the salami fresh may help with that? Sandwiches come with a choice of side- the ""stack o chips"" are coin-cut fries with a seasoning that was also fairly salty.  Might be a good idea to move the soda fountain to the dining room instead of behind the counter.

Service was quick and fast and the location has plenty of seating. Note that they close at 5PM daily, so unless you're a senior (citizen), it's likely a lunch-only option. The Italian Chick-en Vegas seems to be their most popular option, will try it when in the area again.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,14,3,K8nWzuhW1GNnwma-Kzpt6w

I had the Skinny Dip and Oh.my.goodness. it was AMAZING!! The portion was huge so I was able to eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner later.

But wait, there is more!

I HAD to go back Saturday for the 'Walk o Shame'. It looked so good, and is only served on Saturdays. This was enough for both myself and my husband to share and still have a little left over.

Let's see, last visit I had a meatball sandwich and some deep fried meatloaf with gravy to dip into. This visit I'm having some French dip type sandwich, pretty good. My daughter is eating the pizza bread and enjoying it. My mom has the sandwich that resembles a Bobbie- she might be enjoying it but she's still eating the corn that came on top. If I know her she'll not get to the actual sandwich until I'm done with this sandwich. Food is tasty but get it delivered if comfort suits you- both times I've visited the air temperature is easily in the sixties indoors. That might be great if it's super hot outside and you've been melting all morning but it's not comfortable to eat in such a cold environment and if you aren't already wearing a jacket GOOD LUCK! The lady behind the counter seemed to turn the temp up when I came back in for forks and explained it was so cold we had to go outside to eat. In the shade. And it's only seventy three. You can imagine how cold it is inside? Anyway, that's twice I've been miserable while eating, not likely I'll forget the experience AGAIN and visit a third time. I might call for delivery but likely I'll just forget this place. You gotta be in touch with customers.

Their menu is fun! Each sandwich has its own name and they're just not limited to sandwiches. They have salads, mac and cheese, meatballs Etc. They also have a couple desserts. They have a chocolate chip cannoli and funnel cake fries! I also saw a fun onion soup. So they got a variety of things they also have a vegetarian dish. The place is clean and the staff are very friendly and helpful. I chose to have there knuckle sandwich with fries and iced tea. Their knuckle sandwich is their 
 version of an Italian sandwich. Their fries are cottage fries and shaped as circles. The fries were very good crispy on the outside soft in the middle with a season all type of seasoning on it. It wasn't over seasoned and it wasn't under seasoned so it was just right. The knuckle sandwich comes out and it is a really good size sandwich. The bread is crispy on the outside as well as flaky and has a soft inside. Very good bread. They stuff it with the perfect amount of meat. Some places try to give you too much meat and some not at all. Sinful Subs had just the right amount. You felt like you were getting your money's worth and not being cheaped out. The meat was warm with cheese melted through it and It had this wonderful champagne vinaigrette that helped cut through some of the saltiness that comes from the meat. So was it real nice blend. I hate to tell you that I finished the whole sandwich. But I did! Not ashamed at all! I also finished the fries. But I left full and satisfied. I want to come back and try every single thing on the menu. I will be back! Good job sinful Subs! You rocked that sandwich and fries!",rJjcFkln3DLc29MzZSsIkw,1,0,5,kSY2z-mTwe2d3dIfbdAdWw

He subbed the chips for fries as well. Paid for it...seemed overpriced, but whatever - maybe it would be worth it. Looked at the receipt and she charged me for large fries and my husband for small fries. It's $2.99 to upgrade to large fries and $0.99 for small. Yeah, thanks for asking. So we wait for our food and when we get it, my large fries aren't even on there. So she gets it and then we start eating. Before I take a bite, I look at my grilled cheese and the cheese is clearly not melted. I take a bite where it doesn't look cold and it was cold. Even dipping it in the tomato soup didn't help. The fries were VERY over-seasoned and salty. I didn't bother saying anything. The French Dip has a bitter aftertaste. Not coming back.

The ""Meat Styx"" are delicious slices of home made meat loaf wrapped in a egg roll they come with gravy for dipping.
  I could swim in the gravy it's perfect to dip my meat styx in.

Unfortunately, there is only one of these shops in town.  That may change in the near future.  I was asking them if they are going to expand and they are looking to expand to both Summerlin and Henderson.  They hope to be in both neighborhoods in the very near future.

The baller had hand made meatballs made on the spot baked in the oven also with mozzarella cheese. Not to much of a meatball person but the Aller was pretty good. The sub come with these quarter size potatoes kind of like french fries pretty good.there's plenty of seating and the place is clean. I will be back when I'm in Las Vegas craving one of these sinful subs.",nC4x02Sv0YYT9CV0UcMSxw,29,26,4,4XtNx3zsRDy-u0AcpGCQZA

I just happened to see this place, while going to another store and I figured why not? Jesus Christ, the sandwich I had was heavenly. I got the ""Walk o' Shame."" It's a breakfast sandwich made out of triple decker french toast with eggs, cheese, sausage, hash browns and half a pig worth of ham, served with a side of syrup. It was huge and was cooked perfectly. It's only served on weekends, probably due to the shortage of pigs in the area. Seriously though, the menu isn't gigantic but everything has flair and looks like it'll taste amazing. See ya guys soon.

Maybe food tastes different when it comes with historical cache and mood lighting, but in this case, I don't feel a need to go to Rao's if I can go here instead.

The service was great. In the USA cheery service is a given, but here it didn't seem forced. Guess that goes with it being an owner operated place.

The other sub we tried was also well made.

MEAT HATER ($8.99): Vegetarians rejoice! It's a huge sub loaded with squash, zucchini, mozzarella, and roasted red peppers. Half was honestly enough, but since it's dubious this sub would be good as leftovers (what with the vinaigrette and lettuce), I'd say it's better to smash the whole thing in one sitting. 4/5

STACK O' CHIPS: Thin-ish potato rounds with seasoning. Soft and flavorful. All subs come with a choice of either these potato things or potato salad. Cool kids get the stack o' chips. Plus, the potato salad serving was rather tiny. 4/5

Originally titled Seven Sinful Subs, but since expanding that idea to a few more sandwiches and dropping the number, Vic Vegas' Sinful Subs on Maryland Parkway originally opened its doors just under one year ago and although a bit tucked away in one of the shopping centers near UNLV a late lunch on Saturday showed the product to be far better than one might guess from the outside signage or website.

Officially located at 4632 South Maryland Parkway, nearby businesses including the expected head shops, a US Post Office and other grab n' go dining ideas, it was just past 2:00pm that online ordering was accessed by way of the website and perusing the choices with a coupon in hand the decision was made to order three Sandwiches plus one Dessert, the quoted preparation time of forty-five minutes a little hard to believe and a quick call to the restaurant suggesting this was automated, a ten minute drive finding 2/3 of the items already hot, ready and waiting.

Now open for Breakfast six-days a week, the upcoming semester not yet in session and things still fairly quiet, it was with Mötley Crüe's Kickstart My Heart playing overhead that the store was entered, a lengthy space decorated in flames and pictures of menu choices traversed en route to a counter set next to the kitchen, a trio of servers all pleasant and hard at work slicing Deli-meat, frying Chicken and assembling what would turn out to be several to-go orders plus some food for another duo of dine-in patrons.

Certainly not an upscale spot, the soundtrack next transitioning to Metallica's Seek and Destroy before some KISS, it was with one Sandwich plated while the rest was boxed to go that a seat along one wall was taken, the ""Nosebleed Seats"" as good a place as any to tuck into a dastardly combination entitled ""Walk o' Shame"" that sees three thick slices of Cinnamon and Custard seared French Toast wrapped around two Eggs, crispy Bacon, Ham, Fennel Sausage, two types of Cheese and Hashbrowns, all of it exactly as ridiculous as it sounds and best eaten disassembled as the whole is really no better or worse than the sum of its parts.

Chuckling at the Fruit Cocktail served alongside the Sandwich, a variety of Chips or upgraded sides such as Macaroni and Cheese offered alongside other Sandwiches, it was with Hot Cheetos packed up for the lady that both the Jive Turkey and Italian Chick-en Vegas were next given a taste while still warm, the former clearly a riff on Capriotti's famous ""The Bobbie"" but bettered by way of a toasty Roll, Mashed Potatoes and Gravy plus Cranberry Sauce on the side while the Parm was on par with many local sit-down restaurants thanks to a hand-breaded and fried-to-order Cutlet topped in housemade Marinara and melted Mozzarella.

Admittedly intrigued by The Baller and its housemade Meatballs as well as the bargain New York Breakfast Sandwich on a Kaiser Roll with Coffee and Hashbrowns for just $6 it was instead with Dessert that the meal came to a conclusion, Vic's family recipe Cannoli a bit disappointing in that it had clearly been pre-filled with some notable sog, though the Chocolate dip and Chips did help a little bit with both flavor and consistency.

***1/2:Sort of an overwrought concept, though executed far better than it need be given the location, Sinful Subs offers several unique and hearty Sandwiches as a price that is a bit higher than the Chains but justified by good customer service and far better ingredients, plus the obvious support of a local business.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,5,4,4,6KJDNQO8nFvs2TK6vAexhA

As soon as we walked in we were immediately greeted & asked if we were first time customers. You honestly don't get that often and that little gesture can go a long way . The female employee who helped take our order & also made our meal made sure to satisfy whatever we were craving.

We ended up getting broken fingers , the French dip type sandwich , & the funnel cake . OMG BOMBB . Were def going to return.

All in all , top notch food , but the customer service made the biggest impression for me . People like feeling noticed & with our service we definitely were treated how every customer should be treated ..

Thanks 7 sinful subs . Will def be returning",oIz0s4hPss0C6fesohTAPw,0,0,5,V-WTrqDqblexBHAAo_iOdA

Cashier was okay just rushing me to order young man making the sandwiches is very immature. Will never purchase this deal off groupon again. Outrageous, prices for anything in this place. Small portion you pay 2.00 for double meat tgey don't put it on. You ask for fries you get 10 flat potatoe shaped ones. Just a really bad experience  won't b e vack. I've enclosed photos too.

5492348,2018-06-11,0,aHFkZDm8g27zpzydNE8OMg,"The sandwiches here are creative and delicious!  I love anything with au jus so naturally I went for the skinny dip.  The meat, cheese, the bread, the au jus....everything was packed with flavor.  The bread is the perfect consistency with just a little crunch on the exterior but soft as you bite into it.  For lighter eaters, I suggest splitting a sandwich.  I ended up eating the filling after eating half because my eyes started getting droopy already from the amount of bread.  The fries here are not your normal fries, they are seasoned crinkle cut potato slices.  The fries are nice and crispy on the outside but still soft on the inside.  Very addicting...I was full but kept eating these.  The broken fingers were also really flavorful, but perhaps not my favorite since I'm pretty sure they are made with white meat chicken.  The mac cheese was really good as well, very creamy and saucy. We also ordered the funnel cake stix with the marshallow creme.  These things are dessert heaven.

So I was super excited when I found out about 7 Sinful Subs. The cleverly named subs are delicious and I love the atmosphere. My favorite sub so far is The Baller, a sub stacked with some large homemade meatballs and marinara. Everyone that works there is nice and welcoming. So glad to have Vic back in business.

The decoration was fun and humorous, the music a little loud since the sound bounces off. As we approached to order and were looking at the menu, there was an employee that seemed angry. She told us ""this will be to go since we close in 10 minutes,"" in a rude tone. We felt rushed to order, unwelcome, and practically kicked out, but ordered anyway. I realized that there was no welcome, goodbye, or thank you. When we finally arrived at home, I was disappointed with my philly and round fries.

The skinny dip was reallllllyyyyyy delicious (unless it was one of those hangry moments where I imagined how good the food was but it was really bad). The fries were hot and seasoned well. The side salad left room to be desired and the pastrami was well flavored but a little blahzay compared to the skinny dip.... at least in my opinion. The service was subpar and the price was a little steep. Therefore, I feel 4 stars is suitable. I'd go back to try more of the adventurous sandwiches.

5902774,2016-09-10,5,aHFkZDm8g27zpzydNE8OMg,"Great subs, just not for vegetarians! I also loved how committed they are to the theme, and that their menu is very specialized, rather than cluttered. Review as follows ~

Service: 5/5
Everyone was super friendly and helpful! I initially thought it took a little while to get our food, but it's definitely not the kind of sandwich you get Subway or Capriotti's. It's a meal, and they pay attention to every order. 

Pricing: 4.5/5
$9 for a sandwich is a little steep, but the portions are huge and they come with fries or potato salad. It would probably be more reasonable to skim a dollar off the price of the sandwich, and then opt in for a meal, but oh whale 

Food:
Skinny Dip: 4.5/5
My boyfriend loved this sandwich, and it looked amazing. This not so skinny sandwich was loaded up with melted, gooey cheese. He said it was one of the better French onion dip sandwiches he's ever had, and he will definitely be back.

Meat Hater: 2/5
I, on the other hand, will probably not be coming back. I was really excited and surprised when I saw that one of their 7 signature subs was vegetarian (and absolutely loved the name lol). The sandwich itself is very bland, however. It's loaded up with roasted veggies and mozzarella, topped with lettuce and tomato tossed in a very light dressing. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the sandwich was healthy (gasp), and admittedly, not what I want in a sandwich. There was a lack of flavor and texture, and I got a quarter of the way through my sandwich before I got really bored with it, and I was just forcing myself to finish the entire half (and I couldn't). The sandwich wasn't inedible, it was just... boring and tasteless. ""A"" for effort, but load that shit up with some flavor.

Fries: 3/5
Potato salad: 4/5

Overall: 4/5
I know I was hating on the meat hater, but I do really think this place is good as long as you don't get it. Great service, reasonably priced for huge portions, and good food for meat eaters. As for vegetarians? Try somewhere else.",ZIqkcApOQh8QfiydYSiLaQ,7,4,4,wuXT3bsnoNZf_Fqc9teQ7g

We ordered the knuckle sandwich and the skinny dip sandwich as these are the two favorites. The knuckle sandwich had a good amount of ham, salami, and pepperoni. The lettuce and tomatoes on top was so fresh. You get the warm sandwich with the cool topping, it's a great combination! Their skinny dip was definitely out of this world. It was really good! I devoured it all. It's hard to find a good French dip in Vegas but this one was delicious. It's comparable to the one at the Bar.
