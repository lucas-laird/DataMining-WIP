However I'm always amazed at how unfriendly some of the staff is, and how long it takes them to prepare anything. I understand that anywhere on the Las Vegas strip prices will be very high but for that I'd expect at least decent quality. On my most recent visit, we ordered a cup of house brew coffee. Upon ordering they didn't even tell us they were out until I finally asked where our coffee was. It took them 25 minutes to make a new can, that ended up being very watered down, at $4.50 a cup. My acai bowl didn't have all the fruit in it that was on the menu, out of season is ok but you could let me know? The fruit that was in it was not sweet, unripened banana and hard mango. Better luck next time..",0QjzzOkD6HH3KJ9_L7uNHQ,0,0,2,11adSt87Ldp_JbWb2yOjtg

This was my first froyo stop while on a girls trip to Vegas.  It was pretty standard- self-serve froyo with a few flavors and lots of toppings.  The flavors could stand a change to something more unique, but they did have a wide variety of toppings.  Price was decent, too.  Overall not a bad place for a quick foryo stop if you really need a fix, but with the many other options for froyo, ice cream and other treats in Vegas, you may want to look elsewhere.

Other options we were debating included an all-berries crepe or the crepes with the beloved Nutella...but we decided to go more classic.

The crepe was descent sized. They are big enough for two people to share as a light breakfast or dessert. We had it with some coffee for an afternoon snack and it was a good idea. Got a sugar boost to walk down the majority of the strip!

We will not be returning to this place nor do I recommend it.  Gross food, expensive and poor customer service.

The photos of the waffles and crepes are deceiving .  The waffles and crepes are very expensive and are yucky.

We had their crepes & waffles and we did not like them at all.   The crepes were flavorless, stale & hard to even cut through with a knife.  The strawberries, bananas & black berries were not fresh tasting and tasted gross & old.  The waffles were flavorless and stale.

The bill was over $60 for two crepes and two waffles. Not worth it at all.  

Don't get me started on the employees, not only were they rude but they're not on the ball about handing you forks and napkins unless you asked them to.

On another occassion, we came here for frozen yogurt as this place is along the way coming from the swimming pool.   To our dismay, their frozen yogurt machines were malfunctioning  & were pouring melted yogurt.  There was really no customers and the employees were not on the ball about maintaining the frozen yogurt machines.

Also, a friend of mine made herself yogurt, which was also way over-priced! 69 cents an ounce! I know it's vegas, but really? On top of that, the fruit was soggy... and frozen yogurt? More like cold soup. The yogurt melts way too fast, it was melted by the time we walked down to the pool.

Had to wait until she was done. What happened to customers always first? Apparently she doesn't understand professionalism.

Stay away from this place. It's so expensive for crappy quality. The lobby was also messy and the floor was sticky. I would rather go somewhere worth spending my time and money at. Never coming here again.",q0trJLNtRnnJ1F8P-VXzrg,0,0,1,fcsrUSxMpzWB0EpeC0XR0A

But wait! They have fresh cleansing juices. Oh my! I've never been into juicing but this place changed my mind for sure. 

Have you ever become FITTER during a Vegas trip?!? Well, it happened to me. I was very pleased with the surprising results. How did it happen?

All hail the **Detoxifyer**! Densely packed with kale, celery, apple, beet, ginger, and lemon, the juice is delicious compared to many of the healthy concoctions out there. Of course it can't compare to a sugary juice, but it does soooo much more.

I had arrived in Vegas knowing I would be attending a pool party at Wet Republic after 4 days of eating terribly. There were no vegetables or good salad options anywhere around. So I had a feeling I'd gain weight by the time I had to don a bikini. But hey! Detoxifyer to the rescue! One juice once a day for 3 days was enough to do the trick. On the 4th day I put on my swimsuit and was actually impressed. I couldn't believe it.

If you need something more substantial to eat (I did), try **The Fitness** crepe and add Alfredo chicken to the mushroom spinachy mozzarella goodness. I split one of these with with my friend and also had the Detoxifyer.

The only thing I'd change about this place is the system to indicate when orders are ready. They have to shout the order number out and then people come up and take items without having to show a receipt. Maybe a more automated system that shows a number and patrons have to show proof of purchase. My order was stolen twice! Granted the MGM Grand was overrun by about 15,000 people from my company's convention. But still, such a system would help even on a daily basis.

Overall I love Blizz for introducing healthy juice options to me. Thank you to the clerks for the recommendation! And special thanks to the Detoxifyer! You've really opened my eyes.

DATE TIP: The Detoxifyer will definitely get you ready for your next hot Vegas date. 

TIP: [[[ T.M.I. Alert ]]] Remember that what you put in must also come out. You may have to use the restroom slightly more often than before, and things may look the same color as when you consumed them. The Detoxifyer is a vivid pomegranate color.

4684850,2012-11-26,0,-hzQQ8tbXThpp0k5E_y1Dw,"This review is purely for the frozen yogurt.  This is my first 1-star review.

I really feel bad for the people who gave this place 4+ stars for their yogurt because that means they don't know what good froyo tastes like!!  It breaks my heart :(

If you're from southern California where froyo shops are plentiful, steer clear of this place.  The yogurt has an odd flavor.  The fruit wasn't ripe either.

My friends and I had a $50 room credit to use that night since we were leaving the next morning so we thought we'd shave some of it off by getting a little froyo and using the rest for drinks or food later.

Well a little froyo (i.e. 3 yogurts) cost us a whopping $25.91.  Are you shitting me?  Even the highest-priced yogurt shops like Pinkberry and Red Mango will cost you an average of $5 a pop.  So yes, close to $9 per really-shitty-tasting yogurt is an outrage.

The kicker?  Even though we confirmed with them that they accepted room credit, they weren't able to pull it up on the system which meant we had to pay for said yogurt.

Let me tell you right now that when we reached the front desk, I raised an uproar until the woman would change our room credit to $75 since it was their fault that we were in this mess in the first place.  Though, it's Blizz's fault for having such crappy yogurt.

I have yet to try any of their other items.  After my experience with their yogurt, I don't want to.",hJpFGEvKO-o3eVaQKVQDGA,3,0,1,ont8ooZmav5wASNSAJ4ueQ

4753458,2014-07-11,1,-hzQQ8tbXThpp0k5E_y1Dw,"Ok snack time in Vegas. One thing to say about MGM is they do have a nice sized food court. If you are looking for a cheap meal or a snack then they have plenty of places for that. I saw that this place had Nutella crepes. That is all I needed to see Nutella crepes. I was sold. I make a mean Nutella crepe so I was curious to see how there's was. The verdict: ok. Mine is much better and I am not saying because it is mine. I am saying that because it is true. If there's was better I would gladly admit it and improve mine based on there's but can't do it. The actual crepe itself tasted pretty plain. There was no real flavor to it at all.  It was also rubbery in consistency and and the plastic knife they gave me to cut it was not doing it. I practically had to take it apart with my hands! A nice fluffy crepe you can cut through easily.  If I would have known how plain I would have opted for the whipped cream on it just have to a little extra flavor because they did not put much Nutella on it. Most bites I got a mouthful of crepe and that's it.  It also set me back $11.95 and even for Vegas I thought that was steep!  The Nutella was good, lol. The crepe itself was a decent size I guess but regardless it was still overpriced.The customer service was not really there either. I mean they rang me up and gave me a pager for when my order was ready and that is it. No greeting or smiles or anything really welcoming. I am not asking for my butt to be kissed but at least act like you want to serve your customers. It was a ""I don't want you here"" kind of vibe. It also took a while to get my crepe. The wait was a little excessive.  Also when I ordered they asked if it was to go and I said that it was but when I got it the had prepared it for me to eat it there. When I asked for a to go box I guess that was a problem because I got an evil look. She rolled her eyes and got me the box.  Overall if I were to get a snack here again I would opt for the frozen yogurt and avoid the crepes. But after seeing  some of the other reviews I may just avoid the place all together.   Not only are they overpriced but the quality does not match up and if it did the price would not be an issue.",upQW7sPfOfh0brmyq2byEg,0,0,1,rC7VuPh-Mt60CW9mjn8h8w

Blizz is IMNSHO the best place to have breakfast in MGM if you aren't one of those 'would rather eat massive amounts of crappy food from the trough' buffet types.  For ten bucks plus tax you can get either crepes or waffles (made to order) with all sorts of fruity, nutella-ey, or savory toppings.  And either a soda or a smoothie  (extra charge of course).

They also have one of those make-your-own fro-yo bars with lots of flavors and toppings at 59c an oz.

I had ""The Congo"" nutella + banana crepes and they were pretty good.  Not the best crepes I've had but decent compared to the crap at the food court and more interesting / less expensive than Studio Cafe. (Where all the breakfasts are about $15+)

I also visited Blizz for dessert one night during my trip and got a piece of chocolate molten lava cake for $4.95.  It was pretty good too and they packaged it to go so I could have my chocolate orgy in private.

I think they open at 8am during the week, which sadly wasn't early enough several days of my visit but it was the most satisfying breakfast I had during the week.",51Dg7npqsTegnd1ZDxVb3w,2,0,4,km6UdiSzEWWl6xmAoKdzWQ
