The bar itself was clean and looked nicer than what belongs in the neighborhood. We were greeted by the bartender whom we ended up feeling very sorry for by the end of our experience. Not only was she the only bartender but was the cook as well. We were soon informed that the website wasn't correct because the owner hasn't updated it. Also, many of the items on the menu weren't available because the owner hasn't been around as he just had a baby. We ordered a pizza and wings to go and a couple of bloody Mary's while we waited. The drinks were good but the bartender was working hard because of other patrons and our food order. I overheard the bartender let other patrons know that she was out of their preferred alcohol. Now the food: the ""pizza"" was a small flat bread that got cold really fast and was served in a box usually reserved for an extra large pizza. The food is mediocre at best and there are much cooler bars to hang at downtown. Sorry, I just can't recommend to anyone. The bartender was nice though, she just didn't have the tools to do her job.",V5DYKPxIl-RxeP-L-vDHSA,0,0,2,lW1XVod_85liyUiKZ2fk3A

The bar is very nice..I was surprised to see how classy of a joint it was! However I was extremely disappointed with the service! Some guy introduced himself as the bar manager and it all went downhill from there! The drinks are a bit overpriced, we came in during ""happy hour"", ordered a pizza and it was completely wrong! The manager had the pizza remade and it was wrong yet again!!! You think they would come a drink or something for the screw up! Also, one drink per $20 in gaming (I've never heard of this)..he failed to inform of us this ""rule"" and we got a hefty bill at the end! That explains why he was overly pressuring us to order drinks! The bar made me feel very uncomfortable! I probably wouldn't recommend it to anyone! Classy joint but the service is not classy at all..bad food, bad manager or whatever he was, bad service, and overall just a bad experience! However, there was a drunken old blonde lady that provided quite the entertainment!

A hidden gem by Boulevard Mall- this is the spot for pizza. Carne Asada or Margherita Pizza are served piping hot with a side of awesome bartender. Forget Metro Pizza, Midtown is much more chic and a place for adults to dine without the hustle bustle of families with children.

1506512,2013-01-24,1,rLMsz9ams_xrlX_weejhtQ,"I would give this place 3.5 stars. Came to this place because I pass it on the way to work. It looks like a cool, hip, place to hang out and it definitely seems like it should be on the strip of bars downtown. 

They also advertise they sell coffee, pastries 24 hours but when we went there, the pastry case wasn't set up and lit, and to my dismay the poor pastries were suffocating in saran wrap sitting in the pastry case. 

The interior decor was very modern and everything was new. Since it recently opened (~3weeks from when we visited), there were empty spaces on the walls where the TVs should have been.  The gaming wasn't installed yet either.

Service was OK. Our bartender wasn't really knowledgeable about the drinks on hand and right away we noticed they only had Guinness on tap- which happened to be out that night but we only discovered that after we ordered the Guinness. I noticed that the owner/manager was there, he helped our bartender find the wine that I had ordered because she had no clue where it was. 

The place we extremely lit. I would have appreciated it more if it was a little dimmer. I'm a big fan of the low light setting, because it doesn't feel like someone could watch your every move. 


For food, we ordered two different pizzas: 

1. The Midtown- classic margarita pizza, the pizza was really good the tomatoes were giant chunks. 

2. Lobster pizza was definitely a hit! It's probably the main reason I would come back here. There were chunks of tasty lobster on top (not tiny little pieces as you would expect) and for a wooping $15 the pizza was totally worth it. No where on the strip could you find a lobster pizza at that price and that tasty. I totally recommend this pizza!

I'd come back in a couple of months when everything is set up a little better.",u0bAtrQrgEoHjFybAl9FeQ,3,2,3,bwMjcLFVV8BS82g2Et-6uA
1665849,2015-03-09,1,rLMsz9ams_xrlX_weejhtQ,"Found this place just east of the strip. It's a small bar that serves great pizza. My wife has a knack of finding these ""hole in the wall"" places. 
There are quite a few TVs around the bar. The decor really matches a modern style bar with a wide variety of spirits and beers. 
The prices for the pizza averaged $12.95 and the salad was around $5.95. Happy hour is 4-6 pm where all dine-in pizzas are 1/2 off. That's a deal!!!!  
We ate a spicy Hawaiian: ham, pineapple, jalape√±os. If you spicy, you gotta eat this. 
The 2nd pizza was the Tuscan: chicken breast, spinach, garlic, red onion, mushrooms. Both pizzas had good portions of fresh toppings. 
The customer service was excellent. The waiter/bartender was very nice and personable. She checked on us regularly and also would also strike up a conversation. 
This is one of the best pizzas we've eaten, customer service was awesome, and good prices. What more can you ask for?

Ordered a house salad with added chicken, plus a 10-piece order of wings with Midtown sauce. The salad was covered in croutons, hiding the fact that they covered up rotten lettuce and spoiled vegetables. The chicken on top was hard, dry, and crunchy as if it had been made days ago. The wings were tiny and the sauce was a basic mild sauce- and sparingly applied. I swear one was actually a sauced bone, there was literally nothing on it.

 I realize it's a bar, but if it's so dark inside that you can't tell if the food you're serving is spoiled, you shouldn't be selling food.

So glad I happened to stumble upon them a month ago.  took my boyfriend with his discriminating NY pizza taste buds.  Even he was impressed.  Pizzas was balanced with just the perfect amount of sauce, cheese, meat (for him) and veggies (for me).  Had their Caesar salad which was delish!!  Had such a great evening there. Relaxing in a bar with a sophisticated ambiance but no pretentiousness there.  Had such a pleasant experience that I decided to throw a surprise birthday party for a friend there.  Unbeknownst to me they will post photos, a playlist, video messages and a birthday message on their large screen T.V.'s for a special touch.  They even let us go the extra mile and put up our balloons, flamingos, have our own cake and let us add our own touch.  This all made for a very special evening and everyone loved it.  I kept asking all of our guests what they thought of the food and everyone of them enjoyed the delicious pizza, salads (by the way, I highly recommend the Midtown).  Kevin and Roland really hit a home run with us.  Without any reservation, I recommend Midtown for a special evening.  They are truly a hidden gem.  I want everyone to know about them.  We have a downtown here in Vegas now let's make Midtown the place to be with swanky joints like this.  I also love the fact that they don't have gaming only because its refreshing and you don't think you're in Vegas when you are there.  If I can recommend anything, I would recommend that they have some vegetarian appetizer options such as zucchini strips, or some type of veggie dish for us Veggies/Vegans.

The person on the phone told me it would be about an hour for delivery because they were backed up. I have worked at a restaurant so I understand this.  After about an hour and 15 mins I patiently called to see how much longer the wait would be. The gentleman on the phone apologized and told me the order in front of us had given the wrong address, so she was delayed an additional 15 mins or so. He apologized which. Was nice, but the situation should of been nullified with more than just an apology. Another 10 mins went by and I received a call from the driver asking our location, in which she was very short and unprofessional. Another 15 mins and she finally showed up. When we playfully said to her, ""did you forget about us?"" She responded wiith, ""no. Just stupid people in front of you."" After paying her, and still tipping her an adequate 20%, I asked if my side of ranch was in the box. It wasn't. There was never an apology or so much as some way to make it up to us, like half off your next pizza. In addition, our pizza was definitely not hot by this time.

 Customer service could really be fine tuned.

But there are problems. 

I ordered a pizza. It was okay. It should have been as good as Settebello or Ferraros for the price, but it wasn't. 
The crust was waaay too thick. The toppings were good, and fresh, and it was edible. But it should have been GREAT dammit. And it was just okay.

The other problem is that the food menu is quite limited. All the pizzas are specifically-designed, although the charming woman behind the bar said one could modify them if so desired, even though it wasn't clear that was an option on the menu.

For example, they have wagyu sliders (good) but no half-pound pub burger. No fries. 
Hello? Go to Dispensary. Go to Badger (Rumrunner). Go to any number of neighborhood bars, who have artery-clogging, delicious bar food. 
Go to Fat Choy, which is in a dingy, smoke-filled, casino of the living dead, but has duck bao, potstickers, and a monster fat choy burger!
Even Naked City Pizza, which is in one of the diviest of dive bars of Vegas, is constantly creating inventive dishes like the Turducken Burger.

In a crowded, competitive marketplace, a business has to find a way to stand out.

Midtown COULD be the coolest hang in the area. 
But they have more work to do.

I'm told their official opening is not until Feb. 1. Between now and then, I hope they have some brainstorming sessions centered around the question: How can we be great and different, and stand out from the crowd.

I wish them well. 
But for my neighborhood pizza outing, I'll be going just down the road to Sicili's on Twain. Tastier and cheaper.",yi_4YTVS6XL7s5atKPbmpA,3,1,3,gBY4D0GI7I7qM5CihawDVQ

There are tables by the booth seats and there are very comfortable stools to sit at the tables.

I had eaten at home and all I wanted was a diet Coke.  The barkeep last night was a very delightful young woman with a tremendous smile and a very welcoming demeanor.  She got my Coke and then some of the members of the group started to arrive.

While I was there, one of the partners in this new business came by and introduced himself and the executive chef stopped by to talk about the menu.  Everyone was very polite, friendly, and accommodating.  It was a pleasant place for us to discuss our book and for those that had food, they enjoyed what they had.  I have uploaded a photo of some meatballs one of the members ordered.  They have a meatball sandwich, but all she wanted was a few meatballs--no bread, no cheese, just the meatballs.

I know business may be a bit slow for them, but my roomies and I try to pop in at least once a week. Help give these guys a shot!!!

Oh and wine Wednesday? Give that a shot! Also be sure to check out happy hour Monday- Thursday 4-7. 5 dollar specialty drinks :D",HVAIta_VkB9W8O88RftXXg,2,1,5,t9pt54Qo2xW27LYKjPdmjg

Crust could have been a little crisper; will ask them to leave in oven a few extra minutes next time.  They get a gold star for having Coke products and I got a lemon in my diet Coke without asking.  Bartender was polite and efficient.  I did get there a little early (11:30 am) and their meatballs weren't quite ready and I may have those next time. 

Overall great experience.  Parking appeared to be limited; I counted about 11 - 12 spots and don't know how it would work if they were busy as there's no street parking on Desert Inn here.  I'll be back!",bvnu6ts51ICEPI0p3HMm8g,0,0,4,PPbFweXe9wmhehFMpvEIAA

I REALLY love this pizza! I really don't care for the prostitutes showing my man her boobs or the constant smoking. I guess I will have to do take out!",KrT4LHYdRt-m1DMPtVKN4w,0,0,3,4H1A6jbRSr8minDyfKIE7w

You would have thought I was one of his long time regular customers. I was a little early and my pizza wasn't quite ready so I ordered a drink at the bar. Immediately I felt like I was back home in my regular watering hole, everyone was friendly and were glad I was there. I ended up eating my pizza there which I will have say was excellent, cooked to perfection you would have thought I was in NYC having a pizza in the Broncz. I ended up staying 3 hours and had one the best times I have ever had in Vegas. This place is a must for your place to visit while in town or if you live here you need to check it out before the line is so long you will have to wait an hour or more to be seated. I will defiantly be putting this place on my short list of places that are a must visit every time I am in town. Great job Kevin and staff keep up the great work.",cOGfWSifqCBz4YP3Y7FO_Q,0,0,5,34Srgw0FEHZeq-RflzpwdQ

They also have a selection of food, but I did not sample anything on my first visit. However, I was impressed when the Chef came over and said, ""If there is anything you want that's not on the menu, let us know. It's like Italy. We'll try to make it for you.""

Their cheapest red wine ($5) is delicious. The interior is downright swanky.They have a nice large TV for watching sportand a high-tech jukebox. Our waitress was great. More interesting fun facts: They have wine Wednesdays with 50% off all bottles of wine 5-10pm, and I hear lobster pizza is divine. Late night hours are great too.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,7,4,eAVeA24kgS1phsvkC4dhmw

The staff greets you and you feel like you definitely made the right choice by stopping by instead of just driving by because of the exterior looks/location. With that said, staff seems a little disorganized at times. They are not always on the same page. Being a big foddie, this place does not disappoint in that area. Never had anything I didn't like. Even though owner seems to be focusing on  more of a restaurant menu rather than bar menu, I feel there should be some kind of bar menu or at least an appetizer menu. Other than that I would highly recommend a visit.!!!",l4Ew7h2owu0MtI3tr2T-1A,1,1,4,etSKUo0GLPXPdZwbcCoQWg
