The waitress was very attentive and sweet, the food took a little while to cook but they had just opened and probably were just starting up for the night.

I've given it a few chances to redeem itself but the last few times I have been there have just been disappointing. We used to have these really friendly Japanese girls as and now they hired some guy that doesn't even know how to properly serve a Big Stick (their signature drink). He's very rude and inattentive even if my party is the only one present in the restaurant. Their sushi and fusion Komex food is not what it used to be. I've had their bulgogi fries and pork belly tacos a ton of times before but now it's bland and not worth the price. Their Korean food is still pretty decent I suppose.

1949289,2014-03-03,5,zL3x_UWvNYLTtxJzO8sKmg,"The best Korean food I've found in Las Vegas. This is a family operated business, and you can feel how passionate they are from the food they put out and the way they take care of patrons.

Their menu is a mix of traditional and contemporary Korean cuisine. Both styles they execute perfectly. They have a true sense of pride in everything they put out. They go the extra mile and make all their own side dishes and soy sauce.

Do yourself a favour and go there, get a drink, order a couple things. You won't regret it.",Vug2Akn65dza1JLCfAGugA,5,5,5,3NKZaHxj0Z5e49CC3zPahQ
1983919,2013-11-21,6,zL3x_UWvNYLTtxJzO8sKmg,"I debated giving 4 stars, but really... I am a big fan. 

I was debating the 4 stars instead of 5 mainly because I feel like some of the decor was done a little sloppy (I'm a little OCD, I can't help but notice) and the bathrooms didn't seem to get the same amount of attention during the remodel as the rest of the space. The bathrooms aren't horrible, but it just seems like they could have done a little more. Also, they smell - like... gas from the kitchen or uncirculated stale old poopy air. I think they should have upgraded the fans... 

This was my soup place when it was Min Sok Chon. I was REALLY bummed when it closed and also bummed when we were at Remiix for the first time (small single panel menu if I remember correctly) and there was no soup. 

The first time we went, we were there with a friend and all we had were drinks. The bartender/server (blonde girl, very friendly) was awesome. We chatted with her the whole time we were there (we sat at the bar and were the only customers that night). 

It had been a while since our first visit and we heard from our friend who was with us the first time that they expanded the menu and also brough back quite a bit from the old menu. (!!!!) I was excited to hear this as I have been craving good Korean soup since they closed as Min Sok Chon!

So, the other night (Tuesday? 11/19?) we went in because we didn't know what else we wanted. The boy ordered from the new items and ordered the chicken quesadilla. Unfortunately, he didn't read the description carefully and it came with avocado inside (he doesn't like it - but it was on him for not reading carefully and asking to keep it off). Can't take them down for that... 

I ordered the Ojingo-bokkum Jjigae (Spicy squid soup)!!! Ohh.... heaven in my mouth... I didn't realize just how seriously I missed good soup. GOOD SOUP! The only thing that could be improved upon is the frequency of service (or size of their water glasses). I ran out of water twice (with a spicy dish) and the second time I feel like I had to wait too long... even after SHE mentioned how little water the glasses hold, especially for people who order spicy dishes. 

I honestly just drink a lot of water (plus the spice) - maybe next time I'll just ask if she can leave a pitcher or something. This was not a big enough issue to take any stars away. 

I also ordered the $4 spicy tuna sushi roll... I will be sticking to the traditional Korean food. The spicy tuna was not appealing in terms of taste or texture. I didn't find it to be like the other spicy tuna I have had, and it was just not worth even the $4 I paid. I managed to eat half the order (hate wasting food), but couldn't bring myself to eat any more (plus, my soup had arrived by then). 

I would still visit - and it is still my soup place. So very happy they returned some Korean meals to the menu!",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,8,6,5,157WQ2C-p5DJtByH7jrVTw

It has great food, good ambiance, and great prices.  Along side a great staff that's attentive and helpful with helping you pick what you want to drink and eat, there is also plenty of parking for your party.  

I especially loved their themed nights throughout the week where they host playing house to 90's favorites.  Upon entrance you will see how urbanized and noticeably chic Remixx is by their sleek furniture and lighting.  I absolutely love the over-sized projector and their comfy couch chairs. 

If living in Vegas, I would be here every night trying out their different appetizers and specials. An added bonus is they make sure to put on the game or put on the fight if you're a sports person! A great spot for dinner and drinks to meet with friends after work or happy hour with the co-workers.

The Bulgogi beef tacos have some of the same ingredients minus the fried rice. These are both under $10. The spicy tuna roll is sooo good $3.99! Unbelievable.

Atmosphere
I came here during their happy hour (5p-9pm everyday and all day Sunday). And I must say I'm happy it was happy hour, otherwise I would have been pretty upset with paying full price for the quality I received. It was a Thursday night and it was pretty dead, just the bartender and the chef that were sitting at the bar. The music that was playing when I first arrived was soft rock. Not something I want to listen to as I'm having a cocktail with my friend. The bartender did change the music eventually  to something more upbeat. I don't think they had AC either because there were a bunch of fans around the room.  

Service
Our bartender was very nice. She told me her name but I'm horrible remembering names. I just know her middle name is Marie because she looked at my ID and said that my first name is her middle name. Anyway, she was very friendly. She explained what was on the happy hour menu to my friend and I and she answered the questions that we had about the items. She was very attentive and made sure that we were doing ok. One star to her. Plus our orders were delivered quickly. That's another star. 

Drinks
For happy hour, it was 2 for 1. I ordered the spiked passion fruit lemonade, I think that's what it was called. It had citrus vodka, passion fruit purée and lemonade. She said she was out of the passion fruit purée and could substitute it for strawberry or mango. I was kind of bummer but I opted for the strawberry. It was actually really yummy. Not too sweet like I thought it would be. By the time I finished it, I could already feel the alcohol. (I did drink half of it on an empty stomach so that's probably why I felt it quickly.) For my other drink, I don't even remember what it was called because I didn't care too much for it. It had champagne and other stuff but I could not finish it. You pretty much could only taste the champagne. My friend liked it, but as for me, not so much. So one more star to te yummy lemonade drink. 

Food
This is why they only got 3 stars. The food was awful. We ordered from the happy hour menu which was only $5 per appetizer. I know you get what you pay for, but other places offer better food for the same price during their happy hour. The carne asada wontons were cold and soggy when I bit into them. I also ordered the pork sliders with taro chips. The taro chips were so oily and undercooked. Some weren't even crispy yet. The slider itself was horrible. The sandwhich fell apart as soon as I picked it up. I had to eat it with a fork because the bread was so soggy it could not support the weight of the extremely overly sauced pork. Only reason I ate it all was because I hadn't eaten since 1130 in the morning and it was almost 9 pm when we got there. 

All in all, our bartender was the saving grace for the visit. I won't be back and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.",BI4jBJVto2tEQ0NiaR0rNQ,4,1,3,6to4LgJRc-xSnQAaTuySQw

They also host parties there ( retirements, birthday, etc. just ask about the catering).  Don't let the neighborhood fool you. This is a great place !!!!",LJks-DkJdPH-lA0oTtyRuQ,1,1,5,o1aAjP_Q32YJwUeVQmHVfA
4683397,2015-02-07,1,zL3x_UWvNYLTtxJzO8sKmg,"Food was VERY SPICY.

I came to try it based on yelp review. We had 4 people with us. We got beef tacos, pork tacos, bulgogi fries, stuffed jalapeños, street corn, and stuffed mushrooms. Somehow, EVERYTHING we ordered came out excessively spicy.

We had 4 people, some of which actually really like spicy food. However, none of us could handle the level of spicy and one person even just didn't eat their food because it was too spicy for them.

Street corn had a TON of Chile on it but no mayo. Tacos inedibly spicy. Everything had the same spicy sauce.

House drinks are almost pure alcohol. But the rasberry sake was good. No one liked the pear at our table. I did enjoy the music. The environment was very clubish with padded black walls and white chairs and tables. And the waitress was very nice.",ngTuw9W7pOWZfP1XaSHaLg,2,1,2,h3QXN_2CdCIP9F3ELvLiEQ
4779985,2013-03-17,2,zL3x_UWvNYLTtxJzO8sKmg,I returned to remiix and the food was even more amazing that I remember than the first time. I had Steak and frites and it was delicious. I love the chimy churry!!! Fantastic meal and great value. Will be back with my new friends soon!!,sf8w4vCA_ppXUAje04FjOQ,4,3,5,PA685rM6C16QBTcCxg1RLA

The only thing is that I feel like they take there time preparing the food. Takes about 25-40mins to get the food. Like today I ordered a sashimi salad and it took 30mins.
 
Overall its a great place to eat, good vibes, and good food. May not be the best place for people who have very little patience. I come here about 2-3 times a month and I still come back for more!",JHFn7YgzAwIxX9VE0MVc0g,1,0,4,T9_Lq8diRLoGj-iV6_91kw

5258896,2015-08-17,0,zL3x_UWvNYLTtxJzO8sKmg,Loved this place when it was Min Sok Chon...It is still the same owner so that is awesome. They totally re-did the interior and it's nice but liked it the way it used to be with tiki's everywhere. But the food is still excellent! Wait times do suck and the service could be a but faster with the waiter but great food for a great price!,aJNqwJJVNcUk4Qh-p6e3NQ,0,0,4,wIjo4Ptsgn7Dcku7AUFurg
5303161,2014-06-01,4,zL3x_UWvNYLTtxJzO8sKmg,"Wonderful restaurant/bar with creative food and top-notch service. It was completely dead when we went in, which surprised me, but it WAS the day after Memorial Day. 

The lovely Japanese girl took very good care of us! I was craving nigiri and, though it isn't on the menu, she informed me that they could do it, no problem! My boyfriend is super picky and she was way too understanding (more so than me lol) and tried to help him.

OK so the spicy crab mussels...OMG amazing. Just an orgasm in your mouth. The nigiri was great, too; very fresh fish and especially for not having it on the menu. The sushi rice was falling apart a bit, but no biggie. OH I also got a spicy tuna hand roll which was huge and bursting with deliciousness. 

They have so many other great-looking things on the menu that I want to try next time; Korean stuff, etc. Oh and they have great American stuff, too, like fries and quesadillas. Wow! AND they are open until 2am! What a win!",1HtGcjZehXY8odctlBSIiQ,5,4,5,k_rPJaj9YbdCNIjKd7nURg

The staff are always so kind. No matter where you sit you'll be comfortable and be able to see the tv! Because there are flat screens everywhere. The Bar is beautiful.

5534786,2014-10-03,2,zL3x_UWvNYLTtxJzO8sKmg,"This is a super friendly little place that is really close to UNLV. The atmosphere is casual and there is a separate bar area and a dining area. The staff are cheerful and helpful and even gave us separate checks despite there being over 10 people in our group.  

I had the  (spicy rice cake) and it was hot but not too hot and very flavorful. Just a tad bit on the sweet side.

Also awesome were the extra large beers. :)  Mmmm. Hite was the brand I drank and it is a very nice lager style beer.

Prices are reasonable, the hours are great (I'm a night owl) and the staff is wonderful. Can't go wrong here.",AxYrBBCMJ1r6_Z7NF6uDng,4,3,4,uHD00qIRU9hlSXks_JK4_Q

We went back and it was not the same taste, it took 30 min to get our food! There was no beer on draft, and the waitress was inexperienced. Will not go back.",wfV05cpejcwjiqf1IrgeXQ,4,2,3,X0Rx7enwnBC-txeob9Co0g

There was also only one server who also doubled as the bartender, so he often times mixed up orders or forgot things. I also ordered a specialty cocktail and he wasn't quite sure how to make it and my friend ordered an adios and the bartender had no idea what is was either. He really did try though, but I think they should work out better schedules, so that we were not waiting for a long time for food or drinks.  I would give them another shot in the future and maybe on a different night?",6LO3hkrSt1-mAU1oR8sbhA,1,1,2,TQnYtwCRIK8EqyoIV1LwXw
