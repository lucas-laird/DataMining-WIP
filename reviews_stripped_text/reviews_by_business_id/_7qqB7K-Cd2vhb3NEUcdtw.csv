344995,2011-05-01,0,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"We ordered the lamb shawarma plates (for a mere $8.95 each) tonight for take-out after my brother recommended this place.  The man on the phone, who I am guessing was the owner, was so kind.  Good start.  The food was ready when my husband picked it up.  He also ordered a rice pudding to go, and the owner was worried that moving the pudding to a take-out dish would ruin the presentation, so he let my husband take the pudding in the glass dish it was in, asking us to bring it back some time.  This kind of friendly service is nearly extinct.  Our shawarma plates were delicious, with tender lamb, fresh salad, moist rice, and a surprise garnish of cucumber yogurt sauce.  Additionally, it came with a generous side of hummus and pita, which we were actually too full to eat until later.  The owner threw in two ice cold cans of pepsi as well, for no extra charge.  It is a bit of a drive for us, but I think we will make this a regular take-out treat because the food, service, and prices are simply outstanding.  
PS - I am from southeastern MI originally, and this quality and value made me feel like I was in Dearborn again, where this type of food has much competition and is always delicious and cheap.  This was the highlight of our weekend.",6A1KvY0sqirf-8zyjNbHzg,0,0,5,lUaMKUEcEGgGYA72P8Hc1A
519172,2012-04-03,0,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,I went to eat at Filfila on 2/05/12 and enjoyed my experience more then any other resturant in town. The owner tends to you personally and treats you as if you are a member of his family. The food is cooked fresh to order and is excellent. I am from Egypt so I can tell you if you are looking for middle eastern food this is the place to go. I really appericated the service that I was given I have eaten at 7 star resturants in Las Vegas and the owner of this resturant really cares about your experience and that you enjoy your meal in every aspect. He blows everyone in town away for his service and middle eastern food. It was so good that I asked my wife were she wanted to go for Valentines day diner and she said that she will only go to Filfila for now on when we go out to eat.,FdH4OV7ofT243yuJYlQTHA,0,0,5,JjexZMJwMIHh0dZcYUjKEA
622632,2011-11-10,0,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"I found this place tucked away in a little strip mall after reading a couple other reviews on yelp. Upon walking in for a late (2pm) lunch, I was warmly greeted by the owner. I had intended to get a large Greek salad and a lamb kebab but he explained the plates to me and saved me a few dollars. I ended up with a Greek side salad, side of rice, a large portion of lamb schwarma, pita bread, baba ganoush, and hummus, with a drink. 
I was hesitant about the baba ganoush- I have had it at many other restaurants and found it to be bitter or too garlicky. This was outstanding, literally the best baba ganoush I have ever had anywhere! I commented I the owner on its deliciousness and he brought a freshly cooked eggplant to show me that he had indeed made it fresh while I waited. Let me again emphasize I was the only person in there!  The food took a little while to come out, but it really wasn't that bad considering that he made everything right then himself. I was delighted with the friendly owner and his exceptional culinary skill. He brought me free Turkish coffee and was going to sit down and drink coffee with me but he got another customer. The food was the best I have had in a while and even better was the owners exceptional hospitality. I love feeling welcome in a restaurant and genuinely want to come back again and again.

831902,2011-07-30,0,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"We grabbed some takeout from Filfila this afternoon for lunch and we will be back.  This is now my favorite casual med place in town.

We ordered the fool plate, hummus, baba, the cucumber yoghurt, tabbouleh and spinach pies.  This is a family run place and everything is made to order.  Other reviewers have noted that this is not a quick-stop place.  Whether they realize it or not, they're doing slow food here and it shows in the quality and the taste.

For example, my husband is not generally a huge tabbouleh fan, but he was fighting me for forkfuls of Filfila's because it was so fresh that you really taste the herbs and lemon juice and the tomatos aren't all mushy.  It's miles away from the pre-made salad bar stuff.

The fool is an unusual dish for Vegas med-style restaurants.  It's a stewed fava bean dish which is served with olive oil and tahina sauce.  The beans were cooked perfectly - soft enough to be edible but not soft enough to loose texture.  The tahina served with it is very fresh and made with a good balance of lemon and garlic.

Decor-wise this is pretty much your standard strip-mall ethnic restaurant, but the food more than makes up for the lack of ambiance.

Service is friendly but a little scattered.  When we first ordered there was no one else in the place, so both the owner and his daughter in law were in the back putting together our order.  A few more tables came in after we'd ordered and they were still waiting when we left.",SADM8dCUog0oGG8aYiy9pQ,0,0,5,66daG4vfrdVSbDgY5FFJIg

The food is cheap, fresh, and flavorful. It's close to one of my home-bases in the valley. The staff has been nothing but incredibly cordial to me. The cashier even told my ex what a pretty lady I was. Damn right, buddy! 

They have Turkish coffee. By the POT. Take THAT Paymon's, with your espresso shot-serving! And it's good coffee, too, with a rich almondy, mocha-like flavor that could possibly convert  some coffee-haters.  

Belly dancing on the TV is a wonderful way to entertain your eyes (and mind?) while you wait for your gastronomic delights. 

I substitute a salad for the fries with my lamb shawarma gyro. It's FABULOUS. Light and super refreshing with a briny bite from feta and kalamata olives, zing from fresh onions and the lite vinegarette, it's worth coming for the salad alone. Perfect for these dry, sunshiney summer days.

After 9 they offer Hookah. Get your grub on, get your smoke on, and joke around with the cool-ass people who own it. They're good people.",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,3,5,5,BslXcLplWmB1Q8lNhiQbXg

I had the lamb swhermi (sp?) plate, and my friend had the beef swhermi.  The server was so sweet and helpful to recommend things we might enjoy and very attentive.  The wait was kinda long for our food to arrive but I looked in the kitchen and it appeared like only one man was cooking at the time.  

The lamb was just perfect, usually I have the trouble with the lamb being too gamy or raw tasting but this was perfectly seasoned.  I enjoyed the homemade hummus and pita bread which perfectly complimented my food and the side of Greek salad that accompanied.

The atmosphere is a bit like a hole-in-a-wall but it's clean, quiet and homey at the same time. The portions are generous for the price. The only thing I noticed is that the gyro doesn't have as strong a flavor as other places I've been to, but it's still tasty. I also tried the Turkish coffee here, which didn't disappoint at all.

4092828,2011-01-12,0,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"Open 2 weeks, and I found it today accidentally -- but on Yelp.  After doing some pre-visit research, I had a an idea about what I wanted to order -- was taking my adventurous foodie coworker who isn't offended by the overordering thing - and is always willing to try everything I order.  

And order we did, we tried the gyro, the falafal, the eggplant, the fool, the greek salad (because he hadn't made the tabbouleh yet), the dolmas, the fries, and Turkish coffee...  the check was under $25.  

Wadi, the owner, who used to work at the Bellagio - handled uniforms, from opening, and when sprung, leapt on the opportunity to live his dream -- so he spent his retirement, enlisted his daugher and her husband, and opened Filfila.   

We were charmed by Wadi's winning personality, his enthusiasm for the stove and his customers, and his food.  While his son in law is still trying to remember what each item costs, he's amicable enough.   His wife, Wadi's daughter was equally as earnest in her enthusiasm for her father's food and in the success of their newly opened restaurant.

We wish them well because...the food was terrific.  Standouts were the dishes that you can't find everywhere in town.  The fool -- a soup or side dish - made of favas or broad beans - is chock full of garlic, lemon, cumin and olive oil - with hummus, green onions and perfect tahini - it knocked our socks off.  His eggplant is brilliant.  Deep dark roasted and salted, it was a real treat.  His falafel were crisp tender, hot out of the fryer delicious.  

My only real complaint - and it's not really a complaint, just a personal preference, is that I'm not a huge fan of large chunks of raw onion -- I'd prefer them had he had a more delicate hand and soaked them in ice to tame them a bit, and his tomatoes were crappy - (but then it's January and all tomatoes are crappy)... but this isn't enough to keep me away, nor should it you.  

I also loved that all his dishes had a large generous hunks of lemon. 
The gyro was basic.  Nothing special - but there are so many delicious things to love about this family run new business, let the gyro go and eat like a fool...don't forget to order it, too.

Whether you're Egyptian or not, I hope you'll be as charmed by Wadi and his food as we were.

Enjoy!

p.s.  They're located in the strip mall on the southeast corner of Flamingo and Sandhill, next to the Blue Ox, behind the Starbuck's.  It's other neighbor is Long Life Vege Restaurant, another spot that could use a little Yelp love.",-Fy91nyOFqPv9M_MaZ4W2g,5,2,4,lgJwjHMJ4flTb2CYqOZHXg
4173767,2011-11-13,1,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"I really wanted to like the place and the food since it's Egyptian style Mediterranean restaurant.  We sat at our table and the owners son was serving us.  The service was not what you call traditional and it was very, ""if you need something holler at me"" style. Totally fine with that and we proceeded to order. 

I read the review before coming so, I was waiting to see if we were gonna get the bait and switch a la charging us for something we didn't order. 

The food itself is honestly not the best I've had.  it was very heavy on the garlic and lemon which drowned out any other flavors.  it was LEMON and GARLIC hummus, LEMON and Garlic baba ganoush, LEMON and GARLIC salad. Meat was tough and chewy.  Still forgivable tho.

The old man is sweet and he does not understand a word of english.

The baclava and some other pastry thing starts with a B was stellar tho and his wife makes them (i think she might have the chef's tongue in this family)

And right at the end we got hit with some weird charges added about $11 to my bill. The son brought out a hummus and baba ganoush and I asked if it came with the plate we ordered and he said it did and he was just bringing it out first.  When we asked for the check from the grandpa there was the charges for the hummus and baba ganoush

I politely brought it up to him and then he started haggling with me politely.  I guess it might be a cultural thing.  It was cool tho.

I just paid and left a big tip.  The owner is really a nice cute grandpa and

he is very kindly towards the customers.  Alas, I can't afford being overcharged consistently or I wouldn't be able to eat out.

If the food was good I would go there and just be careful how I order so, it would be impossible to be overcharged.  But, the food was mediocre when I went.  Maybe, his wife is the one who can break it down in the kitchen.",qd16czwFUVHICKF7A4qWsQ,1,0,3,2C9wwFuWRPV72Bb4MQECCA

5156393,2011-09-29,1,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"After a falafel craving of nearly three weeks and extensive Yelp stalking, I decided to satisfy my fix at Filfila with a friend. I had high hopes for this place after reading my brother's review, and hearing so many commendations for it. When it comes down to it, it's all about the technicalities - all of which brought my high hopes to smoldering crash stop. 

When my friend and I arrived, the proprietor (a very sweet, older gentleman) treated us like we were extended family - eating in? Oh, sit down! We ended up both ordering the falafel plate, and we could see the owner promptly shaping and frying our plates. Soon, he brought out a plate of hummus and pita - when we mentioned that we didn't order it, he assured us in eating it. The wait was a bit on the European side: lengthy, but easily bearable with a few rounds of card games. Very adorable, may I add.

A small dish of hummus with baba ganoush in the middle with warm pita? Now this man knows the way to my heart. Throw in a few olives, and I'm in love. The dips were addicting. Awaiting my friend's move in Goldfish, I'd find myself mindlessly snacking on more. Oh, but the falafel. After twenty minutes or so, five falafel disks atop a salad came out. Halfway through, my fix was quickly satisfied. Crisp, piping hot, and so flavorful. Egyptian style? I couldn't tell you. I was too enamored with them to notice.

So why the low rating? Two reasons in particular: the terrible feeling I had after the meal and a price discrepancy. I was still at the table when a surge of nausea and stomach pain hit me. I blamed it on the hummus, but after eating leftovers of my entree the next day, I immediately knew it was the falafel. When my friend gave her leftovers to her boyfriend, who has a stomach of steel, he couldn't bear the aftermath of the fried chickpea madness. Next, we were charged for the hummus and pita that we specifically mentioned we didn't order. I wasn't about to argue extensively over it considering our two falafel plates ($6 each) and the hummus/baba ganoush ($4) came out to $18 after tax. 

An hour after leaving, I was truly upset. Not speaking purely on physical pain. But really? Don't be deceiving me in chickpea form!",rzatTfGhdFwgyfAP9yhPLg,1,0,2,BboKW2JuVZapNGgCFJdRZQ
5199557,2011-09-02,4,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"Total eclipse of the sweethearts! When your waitress blesses you with some free fries because no one at your table is nice enough to accept the guilt of ordering them to share, you know you've found a winner! Truly, the service here was a highlight of our day. Yes, the food took a minute to come out, but they were busy making everything fresh to order.

This is a casual spot, but with plenty of charm. The music was delightful, and I had the feeling that you could stay here for hours chatting and they wouldn't ask you to leave. It feels like a spot to savor the moments, and the food.

We ordered big: a falafel plate, tabouleh, roasted eggplant and fool. The menu also features some hard to find Egyptian dishes that you have to order in advance. The waitress told us the falafel were Egyptian-style. I love falafel, but can't say I am expert in the different styles. These seemed a bit more dense with the consistency of a potato pancake? The flavor wasn't quite as zesty as some of my favorite falafels, and the shape was disc-like. The plate came with a big salad. All-in-all a good win, even if it wasn't my absolute favorite falafel. Now, the eggplant was downright delightful! Roasted perfectly. And, I can't resist: You'd be a fool to not order the fool! Mr. T shouldn't pity this fool...The puns are half the fun, but the taste isn't a slacker either.

5308427,2011-04-17,1,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"We got to the restaurant at about 6:20 pm. I ordered two falafel sandwiches, and Dan ordered a beef shish kabob combo from the sandwich menu, which comes with fries and a drink. The guy said the beef was still thawing, so Dan said chicken would be fine.

There was one other party of about 8 people there. They seemed to know the owner. While we were waiting for our food, the two men from the other party would go back to the kitchen and help the owner prepare food. 

The other party was served plate after plate of food, and our food came out at least 45 minutes after we placed our order.

I got my two falafel sandwiches, but what Dan ended up getting was basically chicken strips over a bed of salad, and not the sandwich with fries and a drink like he wanted. We aren't confrontational at all, so Dan just went with it and ordered a drink.

Here's a comparison of what we ordered, to what we received and the menu prices for those items, and what the receipt said

2 Falafel sandwiches (2 * 3.95), shish kabob combo (6.95) = 14.85
2 Falafel sandwiches (2 * 3.95), shish kabob plate but without grape leaves, hummus and pita bread as listed on menu (8.95), drink (1.00) = 17.85
Dept. 03 8.95, Dept 9.95, Dept. 04 2.00 = 20.90
 

1) It took at least 45 minutes to get the food ready.
2) Though they probably didn't help with the preparation of our order, there were customers preparing food in the kitchen.
3) The order was wrong and we were overcharged.

5374134,2011-08-02,0,_7qqB7K-Cd2vhb3NEUcdtw,"I will attest to the fact that the food takes some time to come out, but patience is rewarded. I am not sure how long it took for all our food to get to the table, but it was a while. I did not mind because they were waiting on the rice to finish cooking and I am glad that we were not in a rush. The rice was worthy of being eaten alone. Plus the European style of eating is better for you. Food, similar to life, should be enjoyed at a slower pace. 

Between the three of us; we ordered the gyro with fries (6.95), babaganoush (2.95), lamb plate (9.95), and a Turkish coffee (1.75). The gyros meat was juicy and a generous portion, but a little salty. The tangy tzatziki sauce helped mellow out the meat though. The accompanying fries were room temperature, but crispy. The babaganoush was perfection in its strong garlic flavor. It lacked a little kick, but otherwise it was delicious. It came with three large, warm pitas. The lamb plate was moist and tender. The large plate came with a Greek salad, tzatziki sauce, two dormas, and the heavenly rice. The dormas were not my favorite, because the rice was dry and tough. Due to how long we waited, the older gentleman gave us an extra basket of fries and made sure to check up on us frequently. Even though they are set up like a fast food joint, the man was attentive. The Turkish coffee was a great way to end the meal. The natural sweetness of the coffee was exquisite and the ever present taste of cardamom was a plus. The generous amount was more than enough to share between the three of us. 

Filfila will definitely be my go to place to eat Greek food at night. Although there were only two people running the restaurant and kitchen, their guest service was better than the other Greek restaurant I normally frequent for dinner. 

With such wallet friendly prices, it is worth a try. Next time I want to try the ful (fool) plate since it is a classic Egyptian fare. Always on the lookout for new cuisine.",N3oNEwh0qgPqPP3Em6wJXw,2,3,5,Eyivahja9DF8CSlWbjjuLg
