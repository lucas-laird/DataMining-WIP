The first time in I had the fried strips which were cooked perfectly. The batter was excellent and not greasy at all. The chicken inside was moist and tasty. It comes with two dipping sauces. I tried the teriyaki and the honey mustard. Both were very good. Along with the strips I had the vegetable skewers, which also were really tasty. The meal came with a small piece of garlic toast and a drink.

My second time in I had the baked chicken strips which were moist and tender, and because I liked the veggie skewers so much the first time I got them again. Once again they came with Texas toast and a drink. All this for under 6 bucks.

During the first visit my friend asked me how these chicken strips compared to Cane's. It had been a long time since I'd been to Cane's, so today I went there to compare. Cane's was decent, but nowhere close to as good as the chicken strips here at BFG.

The service, as has been mentioned already here many times, was excellent. In fact the only complaint I have about this place is that it's so far from where I live. If they ever open one closer to me I'll be in there all the time.",EmIdjVdvb8EOo2yDf_OIaw,0,0,5,tsvfE91iPn_nFy0RQ43rXg

My husband found this place on his phone and the ratings were really good, so we decided that trying something new is always good.

wow...the food was amazing!    The chicken was cooked perfectly, it was not heavy or greasy and it felt like the perfect amount of food.

we ordered the grilled chicken meal with the mac and Cheese and an order of the baked chicken with fries, and just decided to mix and match pieces from each plate. the Mac and cheese was to die for and the sauces were really good as well.

We shared a bit  of everything with our one year old. He scarfed everything down...he loved it :)

Not to forget .....on top of the great food, the service was amazing as well. Jin checked on us twice, and even sat down to talk with us for a little bit.  He is the nicest guy and you can tell that he cares how the customers are doing and if they enjoyed their meal. 

In small restaurants in this town, great service is very hard to find. 

We were very happy with our choice, and will go back there again in a heart beat.

BFG stands for Baked, Fried, Grilled which are the 3 options for how to have your chicken strips. They have a variety of sauces to accompany including ""Wasabi Cream."" Sides for the chicken are fries, grilled vegetables, garlic bread and mac&cheese. There's something for those who come just to stuff their face and something for the more health conscious.

The owner, Jin, is super friendly and he definitely makes it his mission to have a relationship with each of his customers.

The artwork on the walls are cute and inviting.

This is a great mom&pop shop. A definite cane's replacement. In fact, they are even cheaper than cane's! I LOVE THAT!

Speaking of canes, I could choose BFG's garlic bread over Cane's texas toast ANY DAY, HANDS DOWN. The garlic bread is smaller, but it tastes way better.

Only downfall, it's nowhere near my house. HAHA.",_5i-gReOmEts7CLmnZXZ6A,1,0,4,-FjZC9s48PEQ5p_TNP0ZxA

As my daughter and I both walked in we were greeted and he knew instantly that we have never been there so he explained the menu, which is pretty basic. I ordered the number 1 which was the baked chicken pieces) with mac n cheese and a drink. YUM! I ordered my daughter the kids menu which she picked grilled chicken (2 pieces) and french fries. As for the sauces there are a lot of choices I might say from your basic ranch to some Wasabi sauce, which I find interesting with chicken wings. I got ranch (yeah I know boring) and the BFG which is kind of like Raising Cane sauce.

Baked Mac n' Cheese, comes in a small mini pie tin. It's very cheesy! And unexpectedly the best item was the nachos! Really good. Tip: ask for a side of BBQ sauce and drizzle it on top of the nachos for a little more enjoyment. The owners name is Matt, he said he was ""Chicken Charlie's cousin!""

Service is great - staff is friendly and happy to answer any questions etc. After going a few times, a couple of the staff address me by name, which is a nice touch!

I like to compare this place to In-N-out..... not that it is the same type of food, but it is similar in simplicity! They only have a few items on their menu (like in-n-out). It's just genius. I hate going to places that have a billion items on their menu and it takes me forever to look over everything and then the food is blah. This chicken strip place is awesome! 

Get your chicken strips either Baked, Fried, or Grilled! Simple as that! 
And the fried strips are coated in panko crumbs, which makes it taste better then regular battered fried chicken. 

Their frys are as expected.....BUT the baked Mac-N-Cheese is what makes it.
It comes in a round tin container, which doesn't seem like a lot, but it is plenty. It has this layer of cheese on top that is slightly burnt, not the gross burnt, but that slight cheese burnt. If you are a cheese lover, there is no denying this place's Mac-N-Cheese! 

It is also family owned which I love to support in this town! 

Lastly, their prices are reasonable, on the cheaper side. Its great that this place is in business. I hope they do well and open up more locations!",OmlnynW07ofmMYqdD9rhZA,2,1,5,EbArhEKpX5FEpwYawy4BuQ

No not the type you drink, but Jin, one of their young proprietors who can be seen greeting every guest by name (and remembering it) before during and after your meal. You can tell he truly cares about his customers and wants them to come back with a smile and an empty stomach. One of the nicest persons I can remember meeting in many many years.

Now on to the food. Baked fried or grilled. Your call. A nice way of choosing how heathly you want your strips with a bunch of exotic and traditional dipping sauces to choose from which really mix it up unlike normal chicken strip places. Also they have a chicken strip salad which looked great if your watching your figure. 

Now I have 3 words for you. Panko. Bread. Crumbs. Thats right, get the fried chicken strips that come lightly breaded in panko bread crumbs and you may not want to get your chicken strips fix anywhere else. They taste so light and tasty yet not greasy if you know what I mean. 

Next to it is the piping hot baked mac n cheese oozing over the foil bowl it comes in which was spot on good, sided with a small slice of their tasty garlic bread and a drink of your choice and you feel like you just went a level above fast food into a level of pure comfort food for a whole wopping $6. That's right. Who said food prices have gone up? Not for Jin and company. 

Also they give little BFG chicken stickers to the kids and give out a repeat customer loyalty card as well. BFG and Jin are a win in my book.

423419,2010-12-28,3,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"As others have explained, their menu is very limited, offering only 3 types of chicken strips (baked, grilled or fried) and 3 types of sides (baked mac n cheese, grilled veggies or french fries)... and all combos come with Texas Toast.  Oh and I think they offer a salad too, but I didn't even look at that. haha

For our first BFG experience, there were 3 of us, so we thought we should try all 3 types of chicken fingers.  We ordered 3 combos -- the baked, the fried, and the grilled.  None of us wanted to be healthy and have the grilled veggies, so we subbed another order of mac n cheese on that one.

To our surprise (being the fried chicken strip lovers we are), we all decided the GRILLED strips were the best!  I think because we were comparing the fried ones to Raising Cane's.  Sorry, guys, but I do think Cane's has ya beat in that department.

BUT... Cane's doesn't offer delicious, creamy mac n cheese baked in a cute little individual-sized bowl.  And they don't offer.... drum roll.... NINE DIPPING SAUCES.  Mmm mmm... we got to try 6 of them and they all made our chicken finger experience EXTRA deelish.  I especially loved the wasabi cream sauce (thanks to all the Yelp recommendations for that)! They were all really good, though.  Can't wait to go back and try the rest.

As everyone has mentioned already, the owners are SUPER nice and make ya feel very welcome.  In fact... yes you can call me anti-social and I'll probably get blasted for this.... but I kinda thought Jin was a little TOO nice.  I love eating somewhere where the person behind the counter actually cares about pleasing the customer.  I really do.  But I also think there's a fine line between being friendly and being annoying.  Jin was teetering on that line throughout our lunch.

I do think it's impressive how he really makes a point to learn everyone's names, but I'd really be ok if he didn't keep saying my name (followed by a question) every 3 or 4 minutes while I'm trying to eat and socialize with my family.  Know what I mean?

We approached the counter with our three daughters, who were very excited that a restaurant's main entree was chicken strips. The cashier/order-taker is by far the nicest person in Vegas, though there are lots of nice people there (he wasn't wearing a name tag). He asked us if we'd been there before (first time), thanked us for coming in & quickly explained the menu as well as offered suggestions. 
We ordered the Family Meal and per his suggestion split the chicken strips three ways: fried, grilled and baked. The meal came with four sides so we again went with his suggestion: 3 homemade, baked macaroni & 1 french frie(s). It also came with 5 slices of garlic bread and lots of homemade sauces. There are only four tables inside but we were able to snag one and eat in.
All three ""types"" of strips were really good! None of them were dry. My husband really liked the wasbi cream, I think their buffalo is great. Their baked macaroni was a hit from our toddler to us parents. 
I'm a people watcher (okay, yes an eavesdropper!) and noticed that the cashier was super nice & helpful to everyone that came in. Seriously, having such awesome customer service makes patrons come back for great food or try a second time. :)",3dx8zcm3igDKbtI0v_lEpA,0,0,5,Aq2GijodSBnYfagdD95pJQ

The food is as delicious as it is simple.  The service is incredible and when I had to move back across the country I felt bad that I would no longer be able to give Jin my money anymore for his delicious chicken strips.

The chicken strips are great whether you get them Baked, Fried or Grilled.  I was always partial to the Fried due to the breading being so crisp.  The Mac and Cheese is wonderfully cheesy and stays hot and gooey for a very, very long time.  They offer a wide variety of dipping sauces and you really can't go wrong with them.  Pick as your mood/taste dictates.

The weekly rotating specials are also all very good choices to get.  I am partial to the nachos but the Bi Bam Bap is also fantastic.

There's a reason why BFG has consistently ranked in the top few spots for food in Vegas.  What it does it does extremely well for the food and Jin goes to great lengths that are no longer common at all to make you feel welcome and valued as a customer.  Its really strange to see how customer service has more or less died but it makes it easy for a well-run place like BFG to endear itself to so many Vegas dwellers.  I look forward to the next time I am in Vegas so I can get some fried strips, mac and cheese and hopefully, it'll be chicken nachos week.

839026,2011-05-06,1,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"So I visited the BFG establishment about a month ago and I have been agonizing ever since on how to find the words to describe how awesome this place is.  Had never heard of the joint before but based on the outstanding reviews I thought it deserved a visit.  My husband and I took my two nieces (ages 5 & 6) as anytime you ask what they want for dinner their response is chicken and french fries.  So they are essentially experts in this field.  

Upon arrival we were greeted by Jin.  May I just say if everyone ran their restaurants with the friendliness and attentiveness as Jin the world would be a better place.  I thought to myself if the food is as great as the service this place is a godsend.  Finally, a nice easy menu - would you like baked, fried, or grilled?  Simple enough.  The meals come with (4) strips, a side, garlic bread, two dipping sauces, and a drink for the bargain basement cost under $6 dollars!  The kids menu comes with (2) strips, one side, small drink, and one dipping sauce.  

We ordered the fried chicken strips meals (2) adults and (2) kids meals with macaroni & cheese.  Niece #1 decided to go rouge and ordered the french fries with her meal but after being ""forced"" to try the mac & cheese it was all over as she began sampling the mac & cheese from all of our plates.  Niece # 2 asked ""How did they get the macaronis to taste so good?""  This is a question I am sure the gang at BFGs gets a lot.  For first timers I would recommend each getting a different preparation of the chickens to share... we had a rookie mistake that won't happen again.  

I will keep it short and sweet.  This is the real deal Holyfield.  Visit BFG's.. tell them Dana sent you.   

To Jin - how about we expand and open up a second location on our side of town ... or perhaps a food truck?  =)",GbHckhaFyxErPGKAP0PJQw,1,1,5,oPEw9JvNRVBOk0SGA2y5mg

They are incredibly fresh and a rather great compliment to the chicken fingers. For the fingers themselves, they are made of great tasting white meat but at the same time do not have much taste. The real magic is in the restaurant's choices of sauce. Depending on your meal, you can choose either two or three sauces from their menu of over 10 sauces. My absolute favorite is the sweet chili sauce.

I always feel the need to compare anytime I eat at multiple places that offer the same types of food.  Prior to coming into BFG, I frequented Raising Cane's quite a bit.  At the time, I believed Cane's to have the best chicken fingers around.  In my opinion, they still do.  However, BFG has more variety and variety is the spice of life.  Here's what I mean:

BFG offers a wide array of sauces, six to be exact.  I don't remember the names of all of the sauces that are offered, but I know that I was pleased with the Wasabi Cream and the Sweet Chili.  Cane's offers one type of sauce and not much else.  I ordered the Number 2, which included four fried strips, fries (crispy and delicious) and a side of garlic bread, all for around $6.00.  I was also able to sample a baked strip, which was good and a side of their mac and cheese which was creamy and very filling all on its own.   The Chicken Nachos were also good (my friend ordered these, I swear I'm not a total fat-ass).  

I am most impressed with their options.  They also offer baked or grilled strips and replace french fries for vegetables, a very good choice for those on a diet.",acIm1t76GjS63KxT0c2G2g,1,1,4,dso9j4h7ZhlU5-JdGiZhnA

You know what taste better than these chicken strips, EVERY OTHER CHICKEN STRIP YOU HAVE EVER TASTED.

Honestly, the chicken tenders I ate here were terrible. They are of frozen bag variety, just like the ones you get in the grocery store freezer, which is probably why they all look the same. The tenders were unreasonably bland, not even that used-chicken grease taste. I got a side of Mac n Cheese and, that too, lack any flavor whatsoever. The Mac n Cheese is actually Identical in look and taste to KFC. 

Whats funny to me is all these reviews that talk about the atmosphere. PEOPLE (shills), this place is no bigger than a gas station mini-mart, and it smells like fried food. It sits on a corner  next to a Home Depot filled with day-laborers. WTF is so appealing and ""cozy"" about that?

Ah, it makes sense. It takes a lot to have me unimpressed, but I'll let the photo of my meal speak for me. 

I ordered the TWO STRIP MEAL COMBO. (about $5.00) This comes with 2 chicken strips, 1 side, 1 sauce... and I decided to go with the grilled chicken, baked mac & cheese, and sweet chili sauce.

Sigh. Please analyze the photo. I received a strip and a half at best -- definitely not two. Not only that, they were more like shards of chicken, not strips at all. How was this even considered a meal? This is more like a snack...

I'll give an extra star for the baked mac & cheese, which was surprisingly good. At the end of the day, I wouldn't say this is ""worth"" the money by any means though. My coworker got the 4 strip combo and for almost double the price, the quantity was not impressive either. 

Oh. Plus the grilled chicken was supposed to have a ""asian marinade and honey glaze?"" No. Not really. Did we get a bad batch? We both agreed it was bland and very lackluster in taste. Same with the sauces we chose... nothing worth mentioning.

For those of you who aren't hip enough to know what BFG stands for, it means Baked, Fried or Grilled. You have the choice of choosing either of those three options. Upon walking in, I noticed that this placed had to be good because it was packed the whole time I was there. I ordered the 6 finger meal, which comes garlic bread, your choice of side (macaroni and cheese, fries or grilled veggies) and your choice of three sauces, too many to name right now. I got fried chicken tenders, mac n cheese and my sauces were ranch, BFG and the yasabi sauce.

The wait for the meal was not long at all, before I even expected it I was already greeted with a tray of my delicious foods. It's kind of hard to ruin chicken tenders, but there was something about these tenders that blew me away. They were delicious and cooked to perfection. The panko breading was a perfect compliment to the succulent chicken that was surprisingly juicy. Although I got fried, I will go back and try those baked tenders because I looked at a strangers plate and they looked freaking delicious. I got 6 tenders and I could only eat 4 of them, they are sized just right and not too small or too large.

I was super excited to try the macaroni and cheese and that was, admittedly, the first thing that I ended up trying. The M&C was baked in this generous tin and my gosh. Something so simple tasted so great. It had this layer of cheese baked right on top and I didn't want it to end, but my stomach did and I got super full really quick. But it was amazing.

The sauces were great, ranch was ranch. The BFG sauce tasted something like Thousand Island but I LOVED the Yasabi sauce. It wasn't spicy or anything, but it just tasted great. I loved it and kind of gave it all my love with my tenders. 

I'd recommend this place to anyone and I'm glad I was able to visit one of my Yelp bookmarks after numerous failed attempts to go. If you go, let me know cause I am down!",cDrNm3ybIQF24wm-lr672g,4,2,5,z0N64cpZ0RPmXKQUHy1rbA

The chicken itself was fresh and of high quality.  If I were to return (I won't) I would try the grilled or baked chicken.  They do offer some flavorful sides to dip the chicken in.

I had the Mac & Cheese as a side.  The Mac and Cheese was not great.  The macaroni was way over cooked and the sauce itself tasted like Kraft Mac & Cheese.  It was very orange and tasted like it was derived from a powder.  I did not taste any breadcrumbs on top (that is what the menu stated).  There was however a nice amount of real cheese melted on top of the side.

Since it was my first time, I ordered the 4 pc basket w/ the baked mac 'n cheese combo. I made sure I told the guy at the counter it was my first time here and I consider myself a fried chicken expert. Plus, I wanted everything cooked to order as that is the only true way to test the food. The chicken was hot 'n juicy with a coating of the light tempura breading. But, the star of the restaurant was the baked macaroni 'n cheese! This item was worth the trip. It was baked in an aluminum pot pie tin and had oddles of cheese, creamy noodles and just the right amount of butter. Very good quality ingredients! 
So, for under $6 BUCKS, including drink and a toasted garlic bread w/ 2 dipping sauces...what a great deal! 

Now, there are a lot of restaurants out there that offer chicken tenders. I have to rate this #2 on my list. 

My number #1 pick is Carl's Jr... I know, what about Canes? But, if you go to Carl's Jr. and make sure you tell the cashier you want them ""cooked to order"" and it's OK if it takes longer to wait....you may agree with me, they are hot & juicy with just the right amount of seasoning and breading! Finally, the fries at BFG were hot & tasted OK, but my number #1 pick for french fries is Nathan's. Yes, the hot dog place! 

OK, so according to this writer, you go to Carl's Jr. for your chicken tenders, Nathan's Hot Dogs for your fries and yes, of course, BFG for the baked Mac 'n Cheese. Got it? 

Oh, I almost forgot drinks & dessert. Circle K for a 44 oz Soda of your choice for 85 cents and for dessert, try the No-Bake Chocolate Fudge at....I hate to say, but at the Wal-Mart Bakery! lol",xrKvtKSHBmILOUtyzf4EGQ,0,0,4,huCKGLJDHeOAywSECCZpWg

The sauces were all so good, it was like a game which one I'd dip into. As everyone here says, wasabi cream was the best. Immediate wasabi flavor but dissipates afterwards which I appreciate so it's not too overwhelming.

The new staff is cool and the customer service is average now but in my old review I mentioned that I felt like a friend or a family member rather than just a customer.

1458428,2013-07-11,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"Well, where can I begin about the rise and downfall of BFG? First owned by two nice guys by the names of Jin and Tin. Their goal was to make a place dedicated to chicken and pleasing the customer. Jin the front man of the whole operation was a genuinely nice person who was always trying to keep the customer satisfied and happy. He was always willing to listen and give his opinion but  in a way that wasn't offensive.The man even went as far to remember everyone's name that came through those doors But that was only half of it, their food was amazing, the line would lead to the door . My favorite things to order were the fried strips with macaroni and cheese, wasabi sauce and bfg sauce.  This went on for about 2 years. By then Tin had gotten a career he wanted and Jin had decided that it was time to pursue what he wanted in life so they sold the restaurant.
 I had been a month since they sold it when I decided to come in one day with a friend. As soon as we walked in I was greeted by one of the new owners named Jessie I believe.  He asked us for our name and if we had ever been there before stuff like that. While ordering he seemed to push us into getting the large cup for our drinks but in a way that sounded like some terrible salesman. For an owner this kid seemed as if it was his first day of working he was just so awkward. As we were waiting to get our food we see Matt another one of the owners go over to check up on customers and we see him approach a table of highschool aged girls to which he very awkwardly started to hit on them and make everyone very uncomfortable. After this very unprofessional stunt he comes over to us  and tries talking to us asking us our names stuff like that. We answered him but he still kind of stuck around he might as well as had his nose in our butts and licking our shoes he came off a little desperate or as a total kissass. By now we had been waiting a good 15 minutes for our food which is a little late for their usual delivery. We later found out that Matt was the second cook so when he came out to talk to everyone he left the other cook there by himself to take care of everything. We get our food , eat, and leave. After being dragged into going again about a month ago by some friends we walk in to see that the whole restaurant is no longer the comfortable quaint place it used to be. New tacky marble tables, they had stuck in a giant beverage fridge that seems really out of place and awkward, they had replaced the old menus with tv screens(2 of which were turned  off so you couldnt see the whole menu), and on the counter they had a very out of place beverage thing? Its like they really stick it in your face about trying to by their beverages. The new owners must be trust fund babies or something to be able to throw away this much money. Matt who is now at the counter greets us and takes our orders. Jessie is now no where to be seen( I guess blue collar work was too much for him!). We receive our food and the first thing I notice is that the fried chicken is no longer that crispy. Afterwards I noticed that their macaroni had become very soupy like they dont let it dry anymore and that the wasabi cream no longer had a kick to it. All in all I am very saddened to see how terribly the new owners have crashed this restaurant.",mfd3MuwpPNCVNxYoZsu-iw,3,0,1,m-FZeMwsvMHa5CmfEqhBuQ

You pretend ""they"" are not talking to you, but you realize they are; because no one wants to accept the overall responsibility of making one of the most important decisions of day.  I have the yelp app.  I don't have that problem.

BFG with all it's raves was an easy choice.  Though I will admit that upon arrival and finding out it truly is a hole in the wall in terms of space, I almost panicked.  Tight space and seating was quickly going by the wayside.  As luck would have it we staked our claim for a table for four.

The menu is simple and consists of chicken strips be they baked, fried or grilled.  I chose four of the panko fried.  Succulent meat with a light crunch, delicious!  The wasabi cream sauce was an awesome compliment. 

There are three sides to choose from...Man-N-Cheese, fries or grilled veggies.  I did not try the mac but it was highly received by the eater who ordered it.  The fries...basic but the veggies made me regret not ordering them.

What really caught my eye was the chicken nachos for $3.50.  One of my partners ordered them and I could not believe the quantity and quality for such an incredible price.  I stood up and immediately ordered another!

Service is top-notch: we were immediately greeted, walked through the menu, invited to join their loyalty program, and made to feel that our business was appreciated. Our food was brought out, we were checked on throughout our visit, and given a goodbye as we walked out the door- all with a smile by the gentleman behind the counter.

As for the food: BF got a 6 piece fried with a side of mac, I opted for the 4 piece rotisserie with a side of veggies, and we added on a hot chick and a thai tea- the latter mostly because since when have I ever been able to get chicken strips and thai tea in the same place? Bizarre but lovely. The drink was out right away and just a smidge less sweet than I am used to. $2 cup is well-priced.

The chicken arrived hot and tasty: BF surprisingly preferred the grilled while I preferred the panko breading for the fried version. We tried several different sauces including the ranch (nothing interesting), wasabi (nice with just a little kick), honeymustard (light but not my thing), strip sauce (my favorite), and buffalo (my second favorite, dude's preferred dip). BF put it well: he'd come back for the grilled strips tossed in buffalo sauce, but the rest of the menu seemed too similar to Raisin' Cane's for his liking, and he's a huge fan of theirs.

As for the sides: the mac was super indulgent and better than the mac I've had at more formal or high-end places. Loved that the dish was still gooey and cheesy instead of dried out, which I run into a lot at places that call themselves ""southern"" or boast about being ""homestyle"". Dude, if I made this mac at home, I'd never leave... because I'd weigh 500 pounds. It's good, but definitely only get if you went to the gym that day, there's a lot of guilt involved with that much pasta and cheese.
The grilled veggies were a surprise hit with BF, he'd tack those on to his future grilled-with-buffalo purchase.

Lastly, the hot chick was oddly again one of my favorite things: a simple fried strip doused in buffalo sauce (sensing a theme?) and placed in a small bun with lettuce and tomato, it's simple and it's delicious. There's  meal option for two of those with a side, and I'd likely consider it in the future.

Final note about their loyalty program: tracks your purchase spendings by the dollar, when you reach a $60 total you get a free meal. I didn't ask for more details but I do like that it tracks with your phone number rather than yet another pesky key tag or card to keep track of.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,6,1,3,9PA9PwqI95aPZVKK5D1Enw

food//*****
usually i don't like white meat and there have only been a handful of places that can fry chicken right for me
strip n dip is one of them!~ the chicken is lightly breaded and fried to a beautiful golden crispness....leaving it crunchy w/ just enough tenderness for the chicken to be yUM

what makes them UNIQUE
- chicken is completely unflavored so you can
- USE THE DIPS (combos come w/ 2-3 dips depending on how many you order)
  *wasabi cream was the unanimous favorite...spicy kick w/o clearing your sinuses unnecessarily
  *sweet chili is just that...cuts through the chicken
  *honey mustard is a safe bet!
  *bfG: big f-ing glutton? haha i'm not sure what it stands for but it's fun...yet i still prefer wasabi

- baked strips are good...but you really wanna try the fried strips

sides
- chicken nachos are a bit salty for me, otherwise it's fine
- baked mac n cheese is in a cute snack size serving
- garlic bread comes w/ the combo and is fairly garlicky =D

Lots of mixed feelings on this place. I came here for two reasons: Yelpers seem to love this place & they have funnel cakes! It's hard to ignore funnel cakes! 

This place is located in a very large strip mall & walking in I have to say I was not impressed. It was run down. The decor itself is nothing special but I let that slide when things are tidy. They weren't. It was also dirty. Trash on the floors, everything seemed out of place & the kitchen area which is open shouldn't be because there was shit everywhere. For a moment I thought to myself, this can't be it. 

We ordered the fried strips that come in panko which were great. Fries were ok. Garlic toast was really good & my man loved the hot chick. We also had the baked strips with mac & cheese, both good. Overall the food was good. They gave a wide variety of side sauces & I loved trying most of them. My favorites were the honey mustard & sweet chili. The Thai tea was my least favorite item of the evening as it was bitter & needed more sugar (super disappointing). Now to the funnel cake. AMAZING! It was perfect & couldn't get any better. By far the highlight! 

I appreciated the pop art (always a good thing to see) but the place really needs a facelift. It also really needs to be cleaned. I didn't take pics of all the issues but someone needs to rescue this place. The food is good & it would taste even better if the atmosphere was improved.

Yelp led me here.

I ordered my food to go, 4 baked chicken strips, mac 'n cheese, 1 BBQ sauce and 1 Honey Mustard. A drink is NOT included with the meal, when places do not include drinks...I opt for the free water. Total was about $7 and some change.

I got my food to go, went to my car to eat and noticed they gave me the wrong meal. Went back inside and they realized their mistake, switched it out, and I went back to my car. I received two honey mustards with my order and no BBQ.

The food was good for what it was, but I felt like a lard ass after I ate the extra cheesy mac 'n cheese. Next time, if there is a next time, I'll opt for the veggies.

And you get a good song that you would gladly listen to? Yeah kinda like that, no skipping. Just let it plaaaaay.

After we ordered, Jin (co-owner) asked for my name.  I thought it was just to call it out for the order, but no, he took a mental note and made conversation with us.  Even though we met just seconds ago, we talked like we were homies.  That's hella cool. Shout out to Jin! I got your back if anyone gives you problems homie! Lol. Anyways, he kept our drinks filled at all times.

As for the food, I enjoyed it like it was my last meal.  A fork and knife came with my 'Baked' order.  And the chicken was perfectly cooked, with the perfect seasonings.  It came with 'Baked' Mac n' cheese, and a slice of garlic toast. The Mac n cheese was good but tasted like it was missing something. Hmmm, butter. Yeah that'll do the trick. And probably cheddar cheese on top instead of mozzarella.  The sauce selection is real nice, cuz what if you don't want cane sauce or ketchup with your fingers!!!! their sauce called the BFG is really good and I recommend trying it. 

I will be paying BFG alot more visits for the equal reason of the food being excellent and well prepared by Tin, and the super excellent attentive service provided by Jin!",wLc6l8v7O9hXjrDi3Q7tyw,6,5,5,0w3GL5vckPPMPhguzYNhGw

This place is pretty awesome. For6 dollars you get chicken (BFG, which is what I will always call this place) , garlic bread, a side, and 2 delicious sauces. The honey mustard and strip sauce, ahem, I mean BFG sauce are the best IMO. The mac and cheese is also pretty good. As long as it isn't busy you get your food super fast.

1942829,2011-03-08,1,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"""#1 Restaurant Best of Yelp"" Need I say more?.. I'm on my way!

Came here on a Sunday evening, they were half full but no wait. The Gentleman at the counter, Jin was Extremely Personable and guessed that I was a Yelper! Haha, nice. I found that he was the owner and his partner/owner, Tin was handling the backend/cooking. I did go with the Combo #1 with Grilled Chicken Tenders/Strips with the Wasabi Cream sauce and the suggested Sweet Chili sauce. It also came with Mac N Cheese, a slice of Garlic Bread and a Drink. All for under 6 bucks, Not bad.. Then, ordered their Special of the Day: ""Hot Chick"" - fried chicken tender, in a hotdog bun with their hot sauce and veggies.. Plus, I ordered a side of their baked chicken tenders and fried chicken tenders (just to have a taste of all the chicken variety they offered). And I also tried their buffalo and ranch sauces too.

My take on the items:

Baked Chicken Tenders: 3.5 Stars. Tasted healthy but didn't have much flavor.. The sauce took care of it though.

Grilled Chicken Tenders: 4/5 Stars. Mildly flavored, a bit sweet and tasty.

Fried Chicken Tenders: 5/5 Stars. The Breading (Panko?) was absolutely delicious with the chicken. Like a Tempura Chicken Tender!

Wasabi Cream Sauce: 3.5/5 Stars. Unique and mild wasabi flavor. Nice and creamy but didn't Wow me like I was expecting.

Sweet Chili Sauce: 4/5 Stars. Sweet, a tiny bit spicy , like a teriyaki type sauce. This was pretty good.

Buffalo and Ranch Sauces: 3/5 Stars. Both decent, as expected

Hot Chick (special): 3.5/5 Stars Think of Fried Chicken Tender hot dog with hot sauce and veggies. Not bad. But it did make me order more Fried Chicken Tenders!

Mac N Cheese: 4/5 Stars, Easy. Not the Best I've had but Way Better than KFC's! I think there were a couple different cheeses working together with that Nacho cheese oozing in the middle of it all! I'm a Fan!

Service was Superb, No Question! For a place like this, I never would of expected to feel like a V.I.P.! I think Jin asked me twice if I wanted a refill for my drink but Annie (the wife of Tin, the other owner) was quick to give me a refill before and after Jin already asked me.. Also, follow ups on the food and.. It goes on.. The Food and Value was better than Average. This Local Business Got My Support!!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,6,2,4,zKIWi0WNhLuxCRXe9fJIMg

I love this place. Matt (owner) is super friendly, remembers his customers and shows genuine interest in them. His staff is also very friendly and shows connection with their customers. We have never been in and had anything but stellar service. 

The food is great, too. I stick with the fried strips with fries. I get ranch for the fries and then wasabi cream and sweet chili for the strips. (dip in the cream then the chili, fantastic!)

I've tried the mac and cheese and also the vegetables. They were good, but nothing for ME to write home about (I know a lot of people love them!). I also tried the grilled chicken, which was good. 

There's just something super special about their fried strips. Love them. 

And the fries are pretty darn tasty, too. I am picky about fries - and I love these. 

I would say, though, if you take it to go, crack the box open when you get in the car - the fries do not really travel too well with the condensation in the boxes - learned that the hard way, couldn't eat them. I was so bummed out.",sDlRFzGHzfpFHaxvJ1JtTg,0,0,5,uiknnyblAwaNj39BUAJrVw

I am on the once a week Taco Bell Nacho Bell Grande kick for the past month. (don't ask me why!  they just taste so good!) and these chicken nachos kicked its ass.  Chips, cheese, chicken, pico, sour cream, beans, scallions... delicious!

Sadly we didn't bring our little guy with us (he had plans!) but we did pick up the Baked Strips and Mac n Cheese to go and that lil bugga MOWED down the mac n cheese en route to the airport...and asked for MORE!

We chose their fried strips and grilled strips and both had to admit that their fried chicken strips are the best that we've ever had.  The coating on fried strips are light and flaky, exactly how anything battered really should be. We sampled their wasabi cream (yum), buffalo, ranch and the BFG sauces...all delish!

Their french fries are amazing.  The Hubs was giving me a stink eye the entire time since I was hijacking those fried potato morsels and in reality, I should have opted for the less healthier choice rather than their grilled veggies (I'm not a fan of onions!).

The garlic bread is yummy, very nicely flavored.  

A big standout really (aside from the food) is service.  I am not high maintanence by any means but I really did enjoy having Jin come by and check on us.  I noticed that he greeted everyone that walked in and took the time to chat with the patrons in there which made it such ""welcome to our place"" feeling.  THAT you have to love.  Jin gets major props for just being awesome.

Would be come back?  Yes we have to now since our lil man tasted the mac and cheese and the the strips and is addicted now.

I've been itching to come here for the longest time, but since it isn't close to my house, my visit has been delayed, but since my gf and I were on vacation for winter break, we placed BFG on our Go-To list and we should've placed it on our Go-To list a few more times!  After reading the rest of my fellow Yelpers' reviews, I already decided on what to order before I even went there.  And when my gf and I showed up here and ordered without even having to look at the menu twice, Jin, the co-owner, knew we were Yelpers!  How cool!

I ordered the #2: Baked Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Sweet Chili and Cheese.  My gf ordered the #3: Fried Chicken, Baked Mac and Cheese, and garlic toast with Wasabi Cream and BFG sauce.  It was semi busy so Jin gave us a heads up that the food might take a minute and I thought that was cool that he was honest about it.  I saw the other owner, Tin, working up a sweat cooking in the back, but he was never too busy to give a welcoming smile and hello to everyone who came in.  I sat there and looked around and noticed how very welcoming and friendly Jin was with everyone who came in.  He called everyone by name and the best thing about it was that he remembered everyone!  He made sure everyone's drinks were full and had small talk with everyone like they were best friends!

When we got our food, we dug right in! Wasabi cream and Sweet Chili is THE BEST SAUCE EVER!  Definitely memorable and kills my other favorite Cane Sauce.  The chicken was perfectly cooked because even if it was baked, it wasn't dry, but full of juice and flavor!  The mac and cheese was a great addition to the baked chicken and complemented my palette! After we devoured our food, we had some small talk with Jin and got to know him a little bit more.  He even asked to take our photo when we finished our food!

The best part about our visit to BFG wasn't just the delicious chicken and friends, but the hospitality and winning attitude shared by Jin and Tin!  I wish you the best of luck and look forward to the future surprises that BFG has to offer!  The food was soo good, I had to order some to-go to bring home for my mom to try! BFG, son!

For the food, it's mainly chicken strips either baked, fried or grilled. They also have a chicken sandwich and nachos, but I always stick with the strips. Sides consist of baked mac and cheese, fries or grilled veggies. They have combos where you can get 2,4, or 6 strips with a side, garlic bread and sauce. The fried strips are breaded in panko and then fried to perfection. They have some yummy sauces too- the wasabi cream is unique and delicious as well as the honey mustard. The food is nothing spectacular though, it's just okay and I have had better.

My complaint is the owner/manager named Nick. He is really friendly but he is ALWAYS multitasking. While this is not a bad thing, he does it in the middle of helping people. So you will walk up to the counter and he's like ""HEY how are ya, what can I get you?""  And then you go ""I'll have a...."" and then he's gone off delivering food to a table. Or cleaning up baskets. Or wiping down tables. And you're like wtf just happened? He always apologizes about it, but it's totally not cool to be in the middle of taking an order and then just leave. And I've seen him do it multiple times, not just to me either.  1. If you need to excuse yourself, say EXCUSE ME. And 2.

Location
First off, I hate the location but it's forgive-able because the food is so damn yummy. So far away! :(

Service
The girl who took our order had such a good personality. You could tell she really enjoyed talking with customers and when she heard it was our first time she even introduced us to the GM. THe GM gave us a short history lesson on the place and then we were on our merrily way to order. 

Food
Mac and cheese- bomb af
Fries- super crunchy and tasty 
Grilled strips- love that they have a non-fried selection of chicken ... personally got the strip sauce which was described as a Cane's sauce and the teriyaki sauce. 

I will def be back again. I want to try the nachos and the funnel cake

I ordered the standard fried chicken strips with Mac-and-cheese and a small piece of garlic toast. I'm usually not big on mac-and-cheese but theirs was so so tasty.

The owner is very friendly and walks around and takes the time to make sure that everything meets with your approval and also satisfies the taste buds. They have different specials of the week and this week it happened to be the chicken nachos. Wish I could have sampled that but I will definitely do that on my next business trip to Las Vegas.

2150575,2011-05-11,8,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"The Skinny: great fried and grilled chicken with awesome unique dipping sauces with some so-so sides(4) Service: even though it's counter service, you get the warm and fuzzies when the owner makes it a point to get to know you (5) Value: a great plate of food (plus fountain drink) for only $5.75 plus get your 10th combo plate for free? - bring it on!(5)

Planted in a rather large strip mall, this place is rather inconspicious. Situated next to the Home Depot, there were plenty of people even at 1:30 on a Saturday afternoon waiting for their plate of fried goodness.  And what a plate of battered deliciousness it is!

Combo meals ($5.75 each) are easy. Choose your style of chicken (baked, fried or grilled) and your side (grilled veggies, salad, mac 'n cheese, french fries). Each meal comes with two house-made dipping sauces, a drink and garlic bread. We ordered two combo meals - 1 plate of fried chicken with a side of mac 'n cheese, 1 plate of grilled chicken on a bed of salad  and tried 4 different sauces. We also returned for a second run to try their fries and 3 other sauces (neither my hubs or I like Ranch).

The grilled chicken was wonderfully succulent, and had a nice flavour and texture - very similar to Korean barbeque. Fried chicken had a perfect consistency - tender and juicy on the inside with a lovely golden crispy panko crust on the outside without being too greasy. It had a perfect ratio of coating to meat and completely satisfied our cravings.

The other attraction is the interesting combination of sauces they offered. We tried teriyaki, BFG sauce, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream, sweet thai chili, and bbq sauces. Our favs: the honey mustard had a bit of a nice hint of heat to it( as mustard should) while the sweet thai chili offered a lovely combination of spice and sweetness. My hubby, who loves wasabi, adored the creamy concoction.

The reason for the 4 stars is probably the sides. While the salad was wonderful (the veggies were incredibly fresh) and the fries were great, the baked mac 'n cheese was only okay. The cheese sauce, perhaps little too generic tasting for us, but it's prepared well with ample amounts of cheese topping and perfectly cooked macaroni. Definitely comfort food. The garlic bread was flavourful but lack the density of a nice slice of bread.

These are really minor quibbles and I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some good eats at a fantastic price. The variety of the menu really makes this place a crowd pleaser especially with the healthier options. This place definitely gives other casual dining places (ahem! the Golden Arches) a run for its money.

Finally, the staff made a point to get to know you and make sure you have a good experience. They are more than helpful with making sure you have everything you need (utensils, drinks - you name it).

While driving through this part of Vegas, I was surprised to see a Raising Cane's close by! But in all honesty, let's get one thing straight. You cannot compare the two. I mean, you can but they aren't the same animal. SND has more options for sure... And they both have crispy chicken that relies on their sauces for overall flavor. So, there you have it. Just my two cents.

What I enjoyed:
-Crispy panko crust. Hot and juicy. Practically burned my tongue off. 
-They are never frozen, meaning it's fresh.
-I like having options. Want to be a tad bit more healthy? Order it grilled. Maybe baked.
-Grilled veggies? Yup! We had a vegan and vegetarian in our party so they liked that!
-Staff. So friendly! They even took an Instagram photo of our party.

What was okay:
-I thought the Mac & Cheese was on the runny side. So sue me! I loved the cheesy meltyness on top, but I didn't like cracking open the inside.
-The sauces. Not terrible. Might give the wasabi cream a try next time!",ceC9qIoD6MDCmENjN11_mA,2,1,4,rfgMhd5WuzCvkZjguMyFeg
2154901,2013-09-11,2,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"Color me impressed.  I decided to go to this place after much self-debate on what to eat, and I am really REALLY glad I went here.

$4.95 gets you a kids' meal - 2 strips, 1 side, 1 sauce and a  16oz drink.  That's awesome, and is also the perfect size for me.  Of course they have larger, too!

The BFG sauce is what I tried and I definitely liked it a lot with their tender, well-coated fried chicken fingers.  Downright delicious.

For my side, I chose the baked macaroni and cheese... it is so creamy and southern that it filled a hole I didn't even know I had from leaving Texas.

While the food is great, the customer service is on the same par.  Interactive, friendly, helpful but not to the point of invading your space.  They make it a point to remember your name and go above and  beyond.  Being in fanatical customer service myself, this gets crazy points in my book!

Sure so many reviews not sure much more could add but think every great establishment can always use another great review! It all starts with the customer service and the personnel touch both co owners show from the minute you walk into BFG. It was my first visit so looking at the menu little confusing but he did awesome job of explaining everything too me. Very clear, friendly, and understanding manner. Each step you get choice way chicken cooked, different sauces (thinking just get one; my surprise get two choices!!!), and the sides. Not just one option but few options on the sauces and sides. If get the combo comes with garlic bread. I needed too add honesty earlier because I was looking too try as much things being my first time. He told me comes with the garlic bread since going too order one on the side. Little things or sense of personnel touch gets lost in restaurants. They have stamp card too. Woot! Woot! More reason too keep coming back for more.

The chicken strips LOVE the breading anything with panko winnah. It such cleaner breading for any protein, just lighter and crisper breading outside. The meat is perfectly cooked, moist, and juicy on the inside. The sauces Wow so many too choose from need too got back try more. I had the honey mustard and the BFG. I fan of both. The sides looking at other customers going fries but it looked too good pass up. I was not disappointed. You would think fast food type of chain thinking mac and cheese. Not sure. The mac and cheese was da bomb. It was rich with the cheddar flavor, creamy, the pasta cooked al dente, and the cheese melted top it off was just perfect topping. All this for under ten dollar if that not steal of deal not sure what else there is in life. 

I went for lunch talk about packed. I had too wait too get place too sit down. It soooo worth the wait. They have couple tables on the outside too.

My thing is this...when I review a restaurant, it is comparable to its peers, not every restaurant ever.  I do not put E by Jose Andres, and Cuginos Italian Deli in the same category, even though I enjoy them both.  Both are awesome and I give both 5 stars, but that is not to say they are the same.  My 5 stars for BFG is in the sense that among similar type restaurants, it is excellent.

The staff working the counter were excellent here.  He guy at the counter knew most of the people who came in by name and was very friendly and engaging with them.  When I got to the counter, he was very friendly and welcoming.  Definitely a good atmosphere.

The menu is simple.  3 types of strips..Bakes Fried Grilled.  A few sides and garlic bread.  Thats it.  I ordered some of each type for a total of 8 strips and got it with a side of grilled vegetables, a drink and a piece of garlic bread for a little under $10.

The grilled vegetables were simple, yet very good.  I enjoy getting 2 skewers of grilled veggies, even if they are just tomato, onions and zucchini.  A simple, healthy dish with a good flavor.  The garlic bread had pieces of real garlic on top, which was nice.  It had a good strong garlic flavor, yet did not feel super buttery or greasy like some garlic bread can be.

The strips were a mixed bag.  The baked strips were very plain.  They were not bad, but they did not taste like anything special.  They had some seasoning on them and tasted simple.  I would not get them again.  

The fried strips were very tasty.  They did not feel greasy at all, and had a very delicious panko breading on them.  They were very juicy inside and had an excellent flavor, rather than just tasting like fried garbage like a lot of chicken strips do. 

The grilled strips were also very tasty.  They had a little marinade in them which gave them a nice flavor, and were very juicy as well.  No dried out strips at all, quite the opposite.

Despite the fact that the baked strips were subpar, the other parts were very good in all respects and the service was very good.  They even said goodbye to me by name when I walked out.

I ordered fried strips with baked mac and cheese, honey mustard, strip sauce and ranch. 

Fried strips: Now they use a panko breading or something similar. The strips have a nice crunch, but they lack flavor big time. A little salt and pepper would help. You definitely need sauce with these bad boys.

Baked mac and cheese: The best part is the cheese on top. The noodles are overcooked and under-flavored. Pass!

Honey mustard: Way too sweet and thin. It's more like a vinaigrette. It would be great in a salad, but too thin for dipping.

Ranch: Salty and probably store bought.

Strip sauce: Good attempt at trying to imitate the Cane's sauce, but not impressed. It was palatable. 

Garlic toast: Sigh.. they really need to go back to the drawing board with this. It's a small slice of a baguette, soaked with butter without the slightest hint of garlic. Awful!

The garlic bread was delicious, garlicy goodness.

The chicken strips were smallish but good. They come with two sauces and I selected sweet chili and wasabi cream. The sweet chili had a nice balance of sweet and spicy. I really enjoyed the wasabi cream which had a little kick and was quite delicious.

I remember thinking chicken strips? What? Boo!  Instead of stopping at BFG, I ate at several other mediocre spots in the area. Shame on me for being a HATER!

A few weeks ago, one of my coworkers had lunch at her desk and it smelled terrific. I peeked in, and asked what she was eating. She told me she was eating grilled chicken and veggies from BFG. She then proceeded to tell me that you can order your chicken baked, fried, or grilled. I then made it a point to review it on yelp and noticed all the wonderful reviews this place received.
 
This past weekend, my family and I wanted to try something different. I suggested BFG, and off we went. At this point, I still didn't put it together that the place I was searching for was the same place I dissed time and time again. 
When we pulled up, I was like oh -this place? We ran in because it was freezing cold outside, and ordered the family special. 

We ordered 10 fried strips, 5 baked, and 5 grilled. I can't even make an argument on which version was better. I loved them all equally--just like my kids!  The baked chicken was seasoned perfectly, and no dipping sauces were needed.   I added a dash of hot sauce to the grilled chicken and I was in heaven. The best thing about eating the fried strips was the Chile sauce that was available for dipping. Oh man-that was good! 

The sides were good too! The baked mac n cheese was done perfectly, and the fries were crispy and delicious. The garlic bread was mediocre, but who cares!  I have never seen my kids eat so fast.... 

Co-owner Matt was super friendly and even gave us a sample of their chicken nachos to try! He mentioned that they were starting to cater on the side. Immediately, my wife booked him for our daughter's birthday in February. Oh, and my Son's birthday in April! Sorry Matt--you asked for it!

They say you get four chicken strips with your order, but with the baked, it seemed like I got a few more...which was a good thing because they were small.

The service here was as impressive as the food itself. We were greeted by a nice gentleman who asked if this was our first time in. We said yes and he immediately asked if it was from Yelp reviews (nice!). Obviously he follows whats going on in the Yelp community. He gave us some details on the many dipping sauces they have and checked on us twice throughout our meal. There are sit down restaurants that don't do this! 

I never knew that selecting dipping sauces for strips could be so stressful. With the combo meals you get to choose two sauces (which is more than enough). I went with BBQ & the BFG sauce, my wife with the Ranch & Wasabi sauce. They have several sauces to choose from, next time I'll definitely try something different (these were great, but variety is the spice of life).

Now the chicken strips deserve a paragraph dedicated all to themselves. We made the mistake of both getting the Fried Chicken Strips. Next time we will mix it up and each get a B-F or G (not the same). For a whopping $5.75, yes, fie dollar an sevety fie cent, you get 4 chicken strips, a side, a piece of garlic bread, and a frosty coca-cola beverage. For rizzle. It's a glorious deal. When it came to sides there was no other option as they offered homemade baked Mac N' Cheese. Schweeet! Topped with mozzarella cheese it was ooeeey and gooey, two things M&C should always be. Back to the strips though. Their not your atypical fried chicken strips. They use panko bread crumbs which is a HUGE bonus in my book. They weren't drenched in grease. In fact after eating them I didn't feel that heavy sadness that normal chicken strips cause. The chicken was so moist and juicy it was actually dripping. The bread crumbs weren't overwhelming, but just enough to get the perfect amount of crunch in every bite. I can only imagine how awesome the Baked & Grilled strips are. A definite must next time. Key words are next time. We will be back. This place is rad!

As far as I'm concerned, Strip n Dip simply has the best to offer from every aspect whatsoever, including the quality, the taste, the service, and even the value. I first went to this restaurant with a recommendation of a friend based on the Baked Macaroni and Cheese, and it surely didn't disappoint. Nice crispy edges, and extra cheddar inside meant the macaroni was scrumptious and baked to perfection. Some of my friends think it needs a bit more flavor, but I'm personally satisfied. Another side star are Strip N Dip's french fries, which are McDonald's-sized but with crisper edges and great flavor. But of course, how could I forget the chicken? Strip N Dip's chicken strips come in three options: fried, baked, and grilled. All, somehow, are great on their own merits. Personally, I (like others) prefer the fried strips, as their panko breading adds texture and flavor to the already great tasting meat. For those on a stricter diet, guests are given the option of baked strips or grilled strips. Baked strips come with a sort of red seasoning that gives the chicken a taste of its own, while grilled strips are left alone, making it a chicken canvass for many of Strip N Dip's great tasting sauces. The honey mustard is extremely high quality, and the wasabi is fantastic for any spice fans. I also had a Thai Tea which was pretty good, but kind of odd compared to the rest of the menu.

Strip n Dip also shines with its incredible service. Every employee is happy to be there and eager to learn if you're a new customer. They'll give you their own recommendations and ultimately make the experience that much more wonderful. The best thing? 6 strips, 2 sides, and a drink all can be had for under $10. Somewhat comparable to Cane's, but with chicken that actually has flavor. It's an awesome place and I can't wait to try their hot chicks!",r8_eFH3w7d8j_Ig3WuAADg,1,0,5,S-F8kysrrmLEAeVsPIP10Q

Highly affordable awesome value and taste!

This place was one of the biggest surprises on our recent Vegas trip.  We had seen the high ratings on Yelp prior to our visit so the wife and I had to make a stop and I'm glad to report that we can't help but concur with all the positive praise for this place.

Chicken strips...what more can I say.  You can get them Baked, Fried, or Grilled.  We both decided to build our own combos and seeing as how we were on vacation and not worried about being healthy, we opted for the fried strips with baked mac & cheese and garlic bread.

The strips were crispy but not heavy like something you'd get from Popeye's or KFC.  The breading is definitely more panko crisp than buttermilk batter crunchy.  Delicious and moist.

The baked mac & cheese was awesome as well.  Very hot when it shows up at your table but once you're able to dig in, cheesey explosion and tender macaroni are headed your way.  I like how the macaroni noodles themselves were tender without being mushy like KFC's.  The garlic bread was a nice finishing touch and not something you'd typically expect from a more fast food-esque establishment.

You get your choice of 2 dipping sauces and we chose BBQ, Sweet Chili, Buffalo, and Wasabi Cream.  Two words: WASABI CREAM.  Perfect.  You get a slightly spicy wasabi flavor without being over-powering and the creamy texture helps smooth it out.

The food was so good that we stuck around and added an order of fries which were perfect as well.  Golden, crispy, and lightly battered.

The service was awesome and the staff super friendly.  The guy who took our order was very nice and engaging and was making sure to check up on us as well as the other patrons which is refreshing to see in a small establishment.

I'm happy to say that we will definitely be making this a regular stop.  At about $12 to feed 2 people with awesome food, how could we not?!",BVd4an8GlezPjavFnz4urQ,0,1,4,RwK2S2WYbmGA7UYWyYsPVg

Hubby got a #2 - fried chicken, fries and garlic bread and I got the #1 - grilled chicken, baked mac & cheese and garlic bread. I really liked both types of chicken so much that I can't decide which I liked better. I did really like the fact that the baked was really moist and the seasoning added some nice flavor even before the dips. I really liked the crunchy coating on the fried, like another review said it was very much like panko breadcrumbs, which was a change from a breading texture like I'm used to, but a good change. 
The fries were good and not greasy but OMG that mac & cheese was AWESOME! The noodles were well cooked, not mushy, and the sauce was creamy and mild but that stringy crust of shredded cheese on top was heaven - I would go just for a serving of the mac & cheese.
We tried 5 sauces: BFG, buffalo, honey mustard, wasabi cream and ranch. I really liked both the honey mustard (not too sweet or too tangy) and the wasabi cream (could probably use a little more wasabi but still good and different). The garlic bread was good nothing amazing but in no way bad.

You are also granted two sides: chose BBQ and honey mustard. I would skip the BBQ and get honey mustard and maybe their wasabi. 

Side Mac in cheese was also very scrumptious, and had a nice crust on top.

If you have trouble finding it, it is next door to Home Depot, to the south.  

I ordered the baked chicken strips, with the mac n cheese, and chose the wasabi and strip dip as my two dips, all under $8.  The chicken was juicy and tender, very good!  The mac n cheese was awesome, perfectly caramelized on top and not overly rich in the cheese department.  The sauces were bang on as well, especially the wasabi.  It was lightly sweet, but still gave that classic wasabi nostril burn! 

I am definitely coming back, especially considering it is pretty close to my house.

As far as chicken fingers goes, this place is the place to be. I'm not often finding myself craving chicken fingers, but it's a simple and no-fuss type of meal.

We went with the 6 piece fried chicken finger combo with garlic bread, and added a side of fries, baked mac and cheese, and extra, extra sauce. The chicken fingers were simple, nicely seasoned, super crispy, and surprisingly moist inside. You can also opt for baked or grilled chicken and add vegetables for a lighter fare.

The side of fries was a heaping size. They topped off an entire to-go container. They were standard shoe string fries, crispy and simple. I loved dipping my fries in their sauces. Also, the baked mac and cheese was bubbling hot, comforting, and very cheesy. We enjoyed every cheesy bite. 

My favorite thing about this place is definitely their sauces! They have a great variety of unique sauces. We tried the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and sweet chili. The wasabi cream and honey mustard were both delicious, but the wasabi cream is what dreams are made of! It had a sophisticated flavor, like it was from a classy upscale dining establishment. I dunked all of my fries and chicken into that sauce, it was incredible. On the other hand, I didn't care for the sweet chili too much. It tasted artificial and bottled to me, but my boyfriend enjoyed it.

Came here for lunch. They had combos with six, four or two chicken strips. It comes with your choice of one side. Drinks NOT included. Customer service was great. I told the cashier this was my first time here and he explained the menu to me and a little bit about how Strip n Dip came to establishment.

I ordered the ""kids meal"" with 2 baked chicken strips (choose between: fried, baked or grilled) and I chose the infamous mac n cheese that other Yelpers raved about as my side. You also get your choice of one dipping sauce. The buffalo sauce was yummy. Total cost was $4.79 I also ordered a 20 oz. iced thai coffee for $1.99. Two dollars for iced coffee!?! Sure...don't mind if I do. The coffee was pretty good too. They also had thai iced tea too. Hmmm...interesting...I would NEVER imagine they would have thai drinks at a chicken strip place. 

This would be a perfect lunch size for all you small/light eaters. The two chicken strips were kinda on the small side but with the mac n cheese...it filled me up perfectly. (don't want to over-indulge here). I'm not a fan of mac n cheese but this.....THIS was DELICIOUS!!! The baked cheese they added on top really made this stand out from your typical boring mac n cheese. The mac n cheese alone was enough to make this review a four star rating. 

So...the reason why I can't give this a full 5 stars is because of some ""rounding fee"" they do on our transaction. I wasn't even aware until a fellow Yelper told me about it. I checked my receipt and it said ""due rounding: $0.01."" Yes, yes I know...it's only 1 cent. But still...what's up with this!?! I've NEVER, EVER seen this before in my life. Literally. 

But even with this ""due rounding"" fee, would I be back?? Of course I would. Whenever I'm craving for some chicken strips..I'll swing by here. Next time, if I have a bigger appetite, I would order 4 strips and I would like to try the fries.",9ks-80ZxeCZWNObzEbW4-Q,8,3,4,VroOROLpVmxl-6M3S_QXtQ

Looks like Raising Cane's just might have some competition! When you think of chicken strips, what comes to mind is deep fried battered chicken strips. Traditionally, that's what has always been known. 

But then this place turns it up a notch, actually two notches, not just by offering you FRIED, but also GRILLED and BAKED as well. 

It's not just your typical battered fried, but they use PANKO breading, which makes it very crispy on the outside while it stays juicy on the inside. 

At first I thought the GRILLED would be kind of dry, but with the first bite, I was pleasantly suprised at how tender and juicy it was with the taste of Asian marinade and honey.

Same goes for the BAKED. It has a wonderful rotisserie flavor to it.

As for the sides, you have BAKED MAC N CHEESE, FRENCH FRIES, and GRILLED VEGGIES. You can't go wrong with these selections but make sure at least one of your choices is the baked mac n cheese. Not only is it what you expect, but they also put MOZZARELLA on top of it!

Of course you gotta have a sauce to dip you chicken strips in so here's the lowdown.
You get your choice of 9 sauces. (in alphabetical order)

1. Barbeque
2. BFG
3. Buffalo
4. Cheese 
5. Honey Mustard
6. Ranch
7. Sweet Chili
8. Teriyaki
9. Wasabi Cream

These are all self explantory except for BFG and Wasabi Cream.
The BFG is there secret signature sauce comparable to Raising Canes. The Wasabi Cream tastes just like a sweet, cream cheese type of sauce with just a little bit of spicy kick of wasabi.

Since this is the only location in existence, any time you are in the area, try to take advantage if you are close by. If you are gonna dine in be aware that they only have about 6 tables inside and about 3 tables outside. They are located to the left of Home Depot.

All in all, I would definitely go back and recommend this place to anybody. Service was nice and they get your food out to you pretty quick. The one only negative I can say is that the strips are just a tad bit small. If you are really hungry, you just might have to order extra strips or sides to compensate.

Okay, I will.

1. Let's face it; people of all ages love chicken strips. I love chicken strips. My husband loves chicken strips. If you love chicken strips, you should come here.
2. We had them baked and fried. Both styles of chicken were super juicy and flavorful, even without the sauce.
3. Oh yes, their sauces. We tried the honey mustard and sweet chili sauces. The honey mustard was a perfect balance of sweet and savory, and the sweet chili wasn't the cloyingly sweet sauce you might find elsewhere. 
4. THE MAC AND CHEESE. It's as good as everyone else says it is. I almost wanted a second tin, but decided that it was the perfect amount.
5. Service. Wow. The cashier was very friendly, asked us how we found out about them (Yelp!), checked on us every so often, and thanked us for coming all the way out there.
6. They have a freestyle Coke machine. Win!
7. The prices are very affordable for fast, yet fresh and tasty food.

So if you're in Vegas, and you have a car (or are willing to pay the cab fare), make the trip to this little place. It'll be worth it.",xEzDkpwXTU6Nh2HnE_HFRw,2,0,5,YLXIcJRe1e9AqmpcRqDdLw

I ordered the 4-piece combo: grilled chicken, a side of mac n cheese, garlic bread, and 2 sauces. I opted for the house dip and honey mustard.

Mac n cheese was crispy at the top, almost like they baked it. I loved it! So cheesy and delicious! The grilled chicken was pretty tasty and fit well with the sauces. The garlic bread was expected, just a small piece of bread with garlic butter flavoring. Nothing too special, but it was good to eat with the mac n cheese.

I also got a Thai Iced Coffee - very unique! As an avid coffee drinker, I think it's one of my top iced coffee drinks!

The owner, Jin has a memory like a elephant, and remembers almost everyone of his customer.   I have say his customer service skills rivals the folks down the street at  Komex,....perhaps even better than them.

I love their concept of baking, Frying, or Grilling chicken. because this one place you can have it your way...sorry Burger King, I had to do it.     Well, I choose the fried chicken strip combo with french fries, Garlic bread, and a diet Pepsi; and added the Mac and Cheese to this order.

My order didn't take too long, and this Chicken Katsu inspired combo was pretty good.    My chicken found themselves being soaked in Ranch and Teriyaki sauce, and sauce were good, but I kind of wished there was some Katsu sauce in house.  
The Mac and Cheese had a nice touch of being baked, and had enough cheese to fatten whale....damn, it was great., and the Garlic bread was a nice touch..

My feeling what separate this restaurant from the other Chicken joints in Vegas is Jin, the owner;  he's the person who make you want to come back and patronize this business.

2934868,2016-12-14,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"If you want plain, fried chicken strips, you gotta try this place. I have to imagine that location is the only thing that has people convinced that raising cane is the best bang for their buck. The breading here reminds me of what you find on katsu, just a light amount of panko crumbs. The chicken to breading ratio is the best I've found outside of a sit down restaurant. And the sides are great. 

The mac and cheese is super popular and if you like mac and cheese, I'm sure you'll like theirs. If you want fries, they'll give you way more fries than one person should consume. And the fries walk the line between crispy outside and soft inside. The grilled veggies are actually better than a lot of the veggies you'd get at a sit down restaurant. 

I haven't tried all the sauces but I tend to get honey mustard every time. Don't over think it with the sauces. Get what you know you like. The tenders are the star here. 

Overall, there's a lot of sit down restaurants with good chicken tenders. If I were to make a best chicken tenders of las Vegas list, it would probably include a lot of dive bars and single $ restaurants because, chicken-wise, you'd likely get more bang for your buck there.

The chicken strips are panko breaded, large, and the sauces are great!  I love their wasabi cream sauce the most, to be honest.  What makes their strips fantastique are the sauces and that panko.  Damn good.

Seasoned well, crunchy, and hot out of the fryer, these strips will make you dream for more the next day.  That's exactly what happened to me!  try it out.  Oh, and check online for their specials.  They change daily.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,2,5,juhGmmp44sV-eCn9AZ1GWQ
3022747,2014-11-08,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"I really, really want this place to succeed because they focus on one of my favorite things, chicken, and they also have grilled and baked options. However, the total package (when you add a drink) is a little high at about $10+ if you get the 6 strip combo (which you will want if you get baked or grilled because you won't have batter 'adding mass'). 

The fries seem like they are from a distributor, which is weird coming from a place that wants to elevate the chicken strip to an art form. I understand that this is likely to achieve economies of scale not possible in a one-location business. Additionally, several of the sauces (including barbecue, but I forget the others) are from a vendor as well, and not made in-house.

This is important, at least to me, because for about $7.60, you can get a 'naked strips' combo at Popeyes and get basically the same amount of product, and arguably of similar or better quality. (Popeyes is fresh, not frozen, and has invested in test kitchen R+D for the various marinade/spice mixes used on the naked strips.)

If I were getting the fried ones, I would have a hard time coming here frequently, just based on the quality and price of other options that are equally fresh and made-to-order such as Raising Cane's.

The strips can be ordered fried, baked or grilled.

You have a choice of sides, fires, mac and cheese or grilled vegetables.

They have one of the mega selection soda machines, which I like, better than the burger kings, with the same machines, which doesn't have the add-on flavorings like cherry. ( To be fair, the burger king I was in, was the first time I saw this mega machine, the other locations may keep their's stocked)

We both had the four strips fried, with mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was great, I saw the person at the next table was having the grilled vegetables, they looked great, I asked, he said they were excellent. I will definitely have to try them. First time there, I didn't know.

They have a large selection of dipping sauces, buffalo, ranch, teriyaki, wasabi cream, sweet chili, bbq, honey mustard, bfg (think Cane's) and cheese.

Now to the strips. I don't understand this, I had 4 strips, two were perfect, two were rubbery. I got the impression they cooked them when you order them, I still have that impression. The strips were the same size, how can they come out different.

If I had four of the of the perfect strips, I would have given a 4. if I had four of the rubbery ones, I would have given a 1.

I gave a 3 because of the mac and cheese was great, two of the strips were good and the soda mach was fully stocked.

Be warned I am going to make a comparison to canes, I fell like it's fair because they are obviously copying them a bit, which is okay with me.   

So I give strips themselves like 3 stars maybe 2, I just love canes so much and I always compare everything to them.  When you get down to the nitty gritty the food is better at canes, I like the batter better and the sauce is awesome.  BFGs panco breading just dosen't do it for me and the chicken isn't as tender, it does however come out fresh, crispy, and not greasy.  I think at BFG they cut strips out of breasts instead of using chicken tenders and this is probably part of the culprit. The garlic toast is small but tasty, canes delicious texas toast is better still as well as their fries.  

Now there is a lot of redeeming points this place has, so many I have to make a list;

*Healthy versions, but the baked kind of sucked, the grilled was decent

*Many many sauces, some better that others

*Pretty delicious mac and cheese

*Service, AMAZING, seriously when I left I felt like the owner was my BFF

*Dirt cheap

I struggled on whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars.  Here is the breakdown

Strips 2.5 stars

Other food 4 stars

Service 5.5 stars

Value 5 Stars

So that is an average of 4.25 stars so 4 it gets I guess, for some reason I still want to give them 3.",WANhIVSoD5oIIu2LfKx5Ig,2,2,4,IYkEsaHEu1d4o0UWt5tXNA

To accompany my fried chicken strips, I opted for the strip sauce and the BBQ sauce. I did not like the strip sauce at all. It tasted like tartar sauce mixed with ketchup.

Sides--grilled veggies on a skewer, french fries, or mac-n-cheese. They're all tasty, but I usually order the grilled chicken and grilled veggies.....and steal a few french fries off my husband's plate! You pick how many strips you want plus a side. The 4-strip meal comes with a small piece of garlic bread. And there are several dips to choose from including a ""house"" strip dip which is my favorite because I'm partial to Thousand Island dressing. It's great for lunch or a light dinner. The food is cooked to order, but if you're in a hurry, you can call and order ahead. The staff is always very friendly and will change out your dip(s) if you aren't happy with your first choice.

We ordered teriyaki, buffalo, honey mustard, and BFG sauce. My favorite was the honey mustard and BFG for the fried chicken and teriyaki for the grilled.
The fried chicken is breaded and fried like fish and chips, it was really good, the mac n cheese seemed like Krafts with cheese on top and baked.. It was really good that way. Fries were awesome, found myself dipping them in the BFG sauce a lot! The garlic bread is not Texas toast so just expect French roll style garlic bread.

All combos are under $6 and come with four nicely sized chicken strips, a side, garlic bread, two sauces AND a drink! Everything is made fresh to order which I love. I ordered the #2 because I am not dieting today:) It was Fried Strips with a generous portion of crispy fries(yum). My sauce selection was Ranch and Sweet Chili. Both were sooooo good, but I was left wanting to try all the other sauces! I did also taste the macaroni and cheese which was the perfect marriage of cheese and pasta that melted in my mouth. (Double yum) The crispy Panko crust on the chicken was a nice touch to separate them from their competitors. The way I see it, BFG is the BFD and blow the other chicken strips out the water.

3226331,2012-08-09,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"Here's the cool thing about BFG: customization.  Unlike Chick-Fil-A and Raising Canes, BFG is a small and quaint restaurant that can be easily missed, tucked away in a plaza, and doesn't draw a lot of attention, except for the unusual design of its exterior.  However, unlike Chick-Fil-A and Raising Canes, you make your order in steps, which allows for multiple combinations of your meal, and is something that I like:

Step 1: Chicken
You can order either baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips.  I ordered the fried, panko-crusted, chicken strips.  I was surprised how small each chicken strips were (so if you're hungry, order the 4-piece combo).  However, what they lacked in size, they made up for in quality.  The chicken strips were very meaty, very moist for white-meat, and the panko-crust made the strips feel light and a healthier choice as opposed to flour-crusted chicken strips.  Hint: fried chicken strips go especially well with the wasabi cream sauce.

Step 2: Side dish
I've yet to try the baked mac & cheese and the grilled veggies, but the fries were pretty good.  I ordered to-go, so unfortunately, the heat and steam in the box made the fries soggy and less enjoyable, but I could still taste how potato-ey they were.  Hint: if you're going to order fries, don't order it to-go.

Step 3: Sauce
BFG offers a plethora of sauces (Remember?  I like having choices).  I ordered the BFG and Wasabi cream sauce.  The Wasabi cream is hands-down the better of the two.  It has a touch of sweetness and a touch of spiciness, but is at a level anyone can tolerate.  I highly recommend it.  The BFG sauce wasn't as special.  It tasted similar to Thousand Islands.

Step 4: Drink
Nothing different from other fast food restaurants.  Although, I bet you can switch out the drink in the order for Thai Iced Coffee for a little extra.

Last, but not least, BFG has especially quick service.  I got my meal in about 5 minutes.  Good food, fast service.",ToTacqVX4uLc19QInL2wxw,3,0,4,7RDnXyFklSxGSmdeLUcEPQ
3230057,2014-05-16,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"Meh, so-so...don't really see what the fuss is about.  This was my first visit here.  The chicken is decent (small pieces, mind you), but that's about it.  Stick with the Sweet Chili or Wasabi Cream dipping sauces...their Ranch and BFG sauces were outright awful.  The sides and bread were average at best, including the Mac & Cheese other reviewers raved about.  Bottom line...they ain't got nothing on Raising Cane's!

Service on my visit was definitely sub-par.  The boss (the only guy not in uniform) was very preoccupied giving freebies to a scragly looking biker customer and his two little miracles...a big, bald Ginger complete with ZZ Top beard, a black ""Vatos Locos"" t-shirt and unkept Ruger P-85 semi-auto strapped to his side.  Further, the cashier was perturbed that I would not forfeit my phone number for text specials.

3245922,2015-10-24,1,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"I had heard about this place several times from friends of mine who are chicken strip enthusiasts and decided to check it out since it was going to be in the same part of town I was going to. It's in a shopping plaza tucked into a little corner, we almost missed it!

It's small inside, maybe six tables or so. The customer service was great, aside from in-n-out I've never encountered such friendly and enthusiastic food service workers. You have a choice of 4 or 6 strips and sides. They also had a lot of sauces you can choose from, since I like anything spicy I went with wasabi cream and buffalo. I also ordered a side of mac and cheese. 

They take the food out to you which I thought was nice. Everything came out extremely hot and fresh so I had to wait a minute to enjoy it but that's how you know it's going to be amazing. The chicken was better than raising canes, in my opinion. I think it's tempura fried? Either way, very crispy and light. I loved the buffalo sauce (it was actually spicy instead of all vinegar) and the wasabi cream definitely had some heat that burned my nostrils. The Mac and cheese was extremely cheesy, I was in heaven. I would put the Mac and cheese on top of my garlic bread (carbs on carbs, delicious). 

If you want fast, friendly, efficient service and fresh, delicious food, stop on in. I've been converted, raising canes won't scratch my chicken itch anymore.",S5Eld1fZx6D8d9i5YbFOaA,3,4,5,DIC6eqb01g-hd-fYzOHHSw

Move over, Raising Cane's. I have found a new joint for chicken strips. Their menu is simple and limited, but you can't go wrong with anything there. You can choose your chicken strips to be baked, fried, or grilled, hence the name BFG. You also get to choose 2 sauces for your strips. I liked my grilled chicken with teriyaki sauce and the fried strips with their wasabi cream sauce. For the sides, the baked mac n cheese is to die for (sooo cheesy), and their shoe-string fries are really crispy and tasty as well. If you want to go healthy, choose the grilled veggies.

For me, it was Okay.  I would've given 3 stars except that the service was phenomenal.  

We got here around 9:15pm at night and the place was pretty busy.  By the time we got our orders taken, however there were some free tables.

I ordered 4 grilled strips an the grilled veggies. I was disappointed that I was told that you could not mix n match grilled / baked / fried chicken. I wanted to try them all but wasn't allowed to, so I just chose the grilled.

My wife chose the 6 fried chicken strips with mac n cheese.

The sauces that we chose were: Chicken Strip Dip, Wasabi, Ranch, Teriyaki and Buffalo Sauce.  

The Teriyaki was awesome.  My second favorite was Buffalo and third was Wasabi.

I was disappointed on the extra charge for sauces that are not included in your combo meal.

My wife also wanted to try the chicken nachos.  The nachos were good, they reminded me of Taco Bell nachos with chicken instead.

I like that they got the new soft drink machine where you can choose tons of combinations.  My killer combo is Diet Coke with Cherry in it.

The food was okay, I expected the serving size to be slightly larger.  The food took a LONG time to come out.  They make it to order.  We came starving and was just about out of backbone when the food finally came out.

One thing was that the music was so loud in the restaurant that I could barely hear the guy taking my order, let alone talk to my wife.

The customer service was AWESOME!  If we were ever around this place again, I'd give it another whirl... just turn the music down a little bit.",dLrMDYQ9TwfodJxYLfaKDQ,2,0,4,LWkxAxw9Y9EMmwZaWxslJA

We drove wayyyy west to try this chicken strip place on a Sunday afternoon for some late lunch.  The restaurant is in a strip mall near Home Depot and it can be easily missed.  Just drive along all the stores until you hit a square chicken head on a blue awning.

The menu is pretty simple:

1.  First you choose your combo, 2 pieces, 4 pieces,  or 6 pieces.  If you have 3 or more people the party platter of 20 seems like a good deal.  

2.  Then you choose your type of chicken.  BFG baked, fried, or grilled.  The baked chicken was my fave, tender and moist.  The fried had a delicious panko crust.  The grilled seemed like the healthiest of the bunch.  

3.  Next you choose your sauces.  This is when it gets fun.  The teriyaki goes well with the grilled.  The wasabi cream is unique sauce that is pretty popular.  My fave sauces have to be the regular BBQ and Ranch.  I love double dipping into those two and making it a mixture.  

4.  Get a side.  Grilled veggies, baked macaroni and cheese, or fries.  The veggies were well seasoned and the baked mac and cheese was super cute in a baby pie tin haha.  

5.  Last get your drink.  

Very reasonably priced for good quality chicken strips.  The customer service here is great too!  The sauces definitely make the meal.  An awesome place to pick up some appetizers for a party.  I would definitely consider a party platter next time I have to bring something over to someone's house.

It was an excellent lunch, made us feel like kiddos again during a long day of meetings.

One night there was a special request for chicken fingers, which resulted in me bookmarking BFG for future enjoyment, since the thought of panko-breaded fingers was too much for her to handle.

Last night the hubster and I were in the area, and decided to finally give it a try. We ordered a four and two finger combo, with four fried fingers and two baked fingers, one mac & cheese, fries, and three sauces - BBQ, BFG, and wasabi cream.

I wish we would have had a dozen of the baked fingers - they were honestly that good. Extremely moist, well-seasoned, and flavorful. They were even better with a bit of the wasabi cream (although I was hoping that the sauce would be slightly more pungent.

The fried fingers were a little disappointing. They were definitely crispy, and still moist, but I was surprised by the blandness. The BBQ sauce was pretty standard, but the BFG sauce was too sweet and 1000 Island-esq for my liking. The cheesy crust on the mac & cheese was nice, but I thought the noodles/sauce needed more seasoning.

Overall, this is a solid place, and I'll definitely be back when I'm in the neighborhood - specifically to get the baked fingers, wasabi cream, and probably the grilled veggies.",kkYsGbpZadE9skXgf9m9lw,0,0,3,vMW8kCAVy175ofrLfJaETg

My fiancé and I took a trip to Vegas this past weekend and after a long 4 hour drive from Cali, we were definitely ready to eat some good food. I personally was craving mac n cheese so we decided to look on yelp and happened to come across Strip N Dip - we were sold by the pictures! As soon as we walked in, we were welcomed by friendly workers. I ordered the mac n cheese but wasn't sure if it would be enough food since it was a side dish, so I was on the fence about ordering the chicken nachos. The sweet lady at the cashier (didn't catch her name) recommended the chicken fries that were not on the menu. Let me just say I HIGHLY recommend the chicken fries to anyone who loves carne asada fries. I would seriously make the trip back out to Vegas from Cali JUST for those fries. The mac n cheese was incredible too (I'm very picky about my mac n cheese and I ended up buying a second serving in the same sitting). We were so impressed by the food here that we came back the next day and were lucky enough to meet Matt Boghos the owner! Matt was friendlier than can be and made us feel like he genuinely cared about the well being of his customers AND workers (which is very rare to find in this day and age). I even needed to charge my phone and he brought out a portable phone charger for me and treated us with a chocolate funnel cake (wow!) Matt was very humble and gracious, and it was very clear that he treated his workers well. My fiancé and I were so impressed by the quality customer service here and will definitely be returning next time we're in Vegas!

Not sure why some of the low ratings. People need to understand costs are going up everywhere, hence, why business owners need to increase prices. ""If you no like, go to KFC!"" Simple as that.

Let's start with customer service: This lil family owned hole in the wall that is easily missed if you are not paying attention is on a fine mission to smother you with niceness! One of the workers held the door open for us as we walked in :-0 ...Oh-and as I walked in, I overheard her tell another customer if their experience eating there was not up to their expectations, she would ""take care of them"" at their next visit! That's a strong statement, Strip N Dip, we will hold you to your word! The cashier was extremely friendly and helpful in explaining their menu items and filling us in on what the popular picks were. The wait was not long and our food was delivered promptly. 

Establishment: Took off a star because we did not have the option to eat at the restaurant due to overcrowding. Seating is very limited so we took our food to go. Maybe if the place was a little bigger, people would not be forced to take their food to go and have to experience a case of ""cold food."" No bueno.

Food: The deep fried chicken strips were amaze-balls! Very tender and flavorful. The Mac & Cheese.......OMG, the Mac & Cheese......SO F'ing GOOD!!!!!!! (for a lack of better words.) Do not come here and NOT order the Mac & Cheese because you will miss out on the full experience. Also, a hot pick here is the nachos. Holy bejezus! These are addicting! 

Honestly, for a first timer, I would recommend the nachos, Mac & Cheese and if room available, have the fried chicken strips. :-)",LZ6IVvfitr_eFGxaFmND-A,1,0,4,3ZOZg5l3As_ywczNSmepNA

I went back about 3 weeks after having gone the first time.  Jin remembered my name, thanked me for my previous Yelp review, and then we got down to business.  It was Monday at 6 PM and I don't know if this is a normal time for a restaurant to be busy, but they were fairly busy.  It really emphasized how small the place is, with just 5 tables and a small counter.  I saw a couple of customers peek their head in and say something like ""Oh they're so busy"" and immediately leave.  Shame, really. 

I got a grilled chicken combo with fries and also got the weekly special, chicken nachos.  I'm a food nit so I got the nachos without pico de gallo, onions, or sour cream.  Still, though, they were excellent and a larger serving size than I expected.  The tortilla chips aren't overly salty, the cheese reminds me of Taco Bell nacho cheese (a good thing IMO), the beans and chicken add some flavor and texture.  Note that the chicken is shredded and seasoned -- it's not large chunks like if they had cut up some of their strips.  I think Jin should add nachos (with or without cheese) to his menu as a side item permanently, rather than rotating the weekly specials.  The grilled chicken strips are great.  I felt like they were smaller than the big fried strips I got the first time I was there, but the taste was great. 

Service, as usual, was great and fast.  Prices are excellent, as usual -- less than $10 for the combo and the weekly special combined.  What more could you want?  Too bad it's a 25 minute drive for me :(",ykWNHp1RXcmx6PYH921UrQ,1,0,5,5nt4Tcti6lrDF7Qwu-riOA

Nooooow... lets pretend I am married to Raising Canes then.. BFG would be my mistress, cheap, hidden, ultra friendly, gives more than receives, and satisfies. Since I've cheated it would only be fair that I compare my lover and my new mistress. 

Raising Cane's Box Combo (6.89) versus BFG anything (5.75). 

The drink
- Both locations offer similar drinks, coke, diet coke, orange fanta, sprite, and etc.. so thats a tie . 

The dip
- Canes has ketchup and that brown gravy cane's sauce. BFG has 8 dipping sauces (guessing here), from a range of sweet honey mustard to the wassabi cream that brings a little spice to your life. My mathematical logarithms are not so good contrary to stereotypical beliefs but I know that BFG sauces (insert greater than sign) Cane's.  

The side
- At Cane's you can only get crinkled fries, a little cup of cole slaw, the delicious toast and... thats it. BFG offers you baked mac and cheese, vegetable skewers, garlic bread from a baguette and shoe string fries. If it wasn't for Cane's having that beautiful master piece of toast then they would have been completely dominated instead of mostly dominated by BFG. 

EL POLLO (CHICKEN)
- Cane's crispy chicken reminds me of what any other place that offers fried chicken strips would be like, but BFG's fried chicken is more.. homey, its a mostly unified and equally crispy deep fry of moist addicting chicken. BFG other offerings are grilled and baked, my favorite, which is seasoned and juicy. Sorry Cane's but you gave me no choice (literally) thus checkmate by BFG. 

Oh there is also a grilled chicken salad which I have yet to try since I am not too fond of salads.

It is a bit difficult to find it you aren't familiar with the area, which is somewhat fine for me since its my secret mistress anyways. I also would like to see some more tables, seems to have a lot of free space in the little shop.",kDGhswMrYIOaFJAViW_nCA,19,18,4,MyrFbWw7Tqk4kS6OfrKi0A

Be sure to try the Mac and cheese. I'm not big on the name change either. It used to be BFG chicken which stood for Baked Fried Grilled.

The  Mac and cheese is pure gold, a must have for the side. The fried chicken is worth the extra calories, it's fluffy, crunchy, and juicy all in one bite. And the wasabi sauce was the best dipping sauce I ever had, I want to dip EVERYTHING in it.

I wish there wasn't that awful sewage smell. It was pretty putrid.

3824320,2010-09-06,11,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"This place was on my 'To Do List"" for a little while. Since I was in the neighborhood I decided to stop by today.  It's kind of difficult to see from the street, so the easiest way to describe the location is that it's in the shopping mall right next to the Home Depot....on the left side if you're facing Home Depot.

Before I entered, I looked on Yelp and saw that they had a Special Offer for $1.50 for Hot Chicks.....decided I would investigate further.

Since this was my 1st visit, I didn't know what a Hot Chick was and was pleased to find out that it was a Fried Chicken strip on a Hot Dog Bun w/Lettuce, Tomato, Onions, and your pick of sauce.  This sounded like a winner....so I ordered 2.....one with their BFG Sauce and the other with Honey Mustard.  For a side, I ordered Baked Mac 'n Cheese.

The restaurant is a small business owned and operated by a couple of friends and their family members.  While I waited for my food, we chatted it up a while.  They are genuinely nice people, which is a huge plus for me.  They asked each and every person who came into the joint what their first name was and called them by their first name when calling the order and saying goodbye....and it doesn't sound fake either.

After a few minutes my food was ready.  I decided to try the Hot Chick with the BFG Sauce first.  The proportion of Lettuce/Tomato/Onions was just right and the amount of Sauce on the Sandwich was just right as well.  The Chicken was moist and tasty....it wasn't greasy (bonus)....it was like a Chicken Strip Hot Dog....awesome!  The BFG Sauce is sort of like Thousand Island Dressing, but with a slightly different flavor to it....definitely worth a try.

While I was devouring the 1st Hot Chick, I took a few bites from the Mac 'n Cheese....it was gooey and Cheesy....it's making my mouth water just thinking about it.  The Mac 'n Cheese portion size is pretty good too for $1.50.  I then went for the 2nd Hot Chick....covered in Honey Mustard Sauce....again, it was explosion of awesome in my mouth!  The Honey Mustard wasn't too sweet and balanced the flavors of the Chicken and the other toppings.

Overall, it was a good day.....2 Hot Chicks & a Side of Mac 'n Cheese for around $5...isn't that every guy's dream?  Shh!!!  Don't tell my Wife!  Ha!

Will I return?  There are so many other options on the menu I want to try....Grilled Chicken, Baked Chicken, and the Fries...You bet I will!",QJI9OSEn6ujRCtrX06vs1w,19,13,4,EbpVGdKHrmbebcn_6xQbXg
3839346,2015-09-10,10,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"It's a good sign when a place is packed with people because that usually means the food is bomb! It wasn't even an hour into Strip-N-Dip being open, and it was packed in there... I decided to order the food to-go because there wasn't enough seating, even after waiting and receiving the food. That wasn't a problem, though, because waiting for these chicken strips was so worth it. 

The place may be hidden by the building next to it, so if you're getting directions through your phone or GPS, then just keep driving and you'll see it. The interior was black and red with checkered flooring. Everything looked clean and well-maintained. It's a bit small with limited seating, so if you come in on a busy day, chances are there will literally be no seats available. 

I got the 6 fried chicken strips, which comes with a small slice of garlic bread, 3 sauces, and your choice of side. I also got one baked and one grilled strip a la carte, so I can taste the differences... I am not disappointed in what I got!

The baked strip was juicy and tender. I feel like sometimes when chicken strips are being cooked, no matter the method, they run the risk of becoming dry on the inside. I think Strip-N-Dip nailed their cooking techniques because none of their strips came out dry. 

The grilled strip had the distinct ""grill"" taste. It was juicy as well, and would be the best thing in between bread for a chicken strip sandwich. 

The majority of the other strips I had were fried. The fried strips were perfect! The panko breading was a golden brown with a good crunch, and the chicken inside was tender... They hit the bullseye on all of their chicken strips, so I don't think anyone would be disappointed in ordering a certain type. 

As for the sauces, I got: the wasabi cream, honey mustard, and their strip sauce. The wasabi cream had the subtle taste of wasabi, but with no spiciness. It's a more of a creamy sauce (like their strip sauce), so it's better paired off with the fried strips. The honey mustard, which is a classic, was sweet and paired well with every type of strip. 

Oh! And they offer Thai iced tea/coffee and funnel cake -- perfect menu items to satisfy your ""just desserts"" appetite. 

Strip-N-Dip did not fail to deliver. If you're ever looking for a spot that serves chicken strips that are NOT from Cane's, then this is the spot for you!",QtGXr3Y74fnWfdWpGJIldw,12,10,5,vAKfGzoMZu9vBuQg-19zyg

Came here the other night and ordered the 6 piece strip meal with fries. I got 2 strips fried, 2 strips grilled, and 2 strips baked. I would definitely give the grilled and fried strips 5/5, while the baked strips I think leave a little bit to be desired. They're definitely good, just not...wow. 

Their sides are delicious. My girlfriend ordered the baked mac and cheese with her strips and it was scrumptious. The garlic bread was also pretty tasty.

Now for the condiments: definitely get the honey mustard. It's amazing. I was, however, super disappointed in their ranch dressing. Half of what makes a good chicken strip amazing is the ranch dressing, and this ranch dressing leaves quite a bit to be desired in my opinion. Definitely need to find a new recipe/supplier. 

All in all, this place is great!

Idk what the grilled strips are marinated in, but they're always so juicy & flavorful. The bonus garlic bread is perfect for scraping the rest of your mac sauce off the sides too.

Just when I thought i've seen it all.....you guys throw out Bibimbap as the weekly special?

I even had a hard time trying to find a seat. I ordered the number 2 with BFG and wasabi sauces. The chicken was really moist especially considering the fact it was baked. Also, nicely seasoned. The mac n cheese was absolutely amazing.  Gooey texture, while not being too overwhelmingly cheesey. Although I would of liked it more of there was some crunchy texture on top like crumbled crackers or something?  It actually came out piping hot, which I loved. The sauces were great as well especially since I'm a sauce kinda guy. BFG definitely beats Canes. I can't wait to come back and try the fried chicken strips.

This has been on my 'to try' list for so long. I enjoyed my experience before I even tried any of the food. 
Service: The cashier was very friendly. My friend and I were very indecisive because we wanted everything. We also changed our minds a couple of times an he was patient and helpful. At first I thought it was just that one cashier, but another guy was coming around and helping us out. Now, I know they just have awesome service all around!

Sauces: Yes, the sauces get their own category. We basically got all of the sauces and took a dip in each one to make sure we got the whole experience. The winners? Wasabi Cream, honey mustard, and the chili one (I forgot the name). You must get those three! You'll regret it if you don't, trust me.

Food: We got the the grilled and baked chicken strips. I enjoyed both. I feel like with the right sauces you can't go wrong with these. 
Macaroni and cheese - it's like a pizza, but with macaroni! Can't go wrong with baked macaroni and cheese. 
Chicken nachos! YES! It's a decent size for $4.00 It goes great with the meal if you're sharing with your friends!

The point system is also a plus. I spent $11 but since I also did the survey and whatnot I ended up with 30+ points, so I guess that's pretty cool.

Anyway, I become acquainted with BFG from walking by it from the CSN Las Vegas campus. (Yes, human being are still capable of walking, believe it or not.) This is where the locals go, I had heard, but I was a local and I had never heard of it (or the former owner Jin). 

In any case, they changed their name (unrelated to Jin) and subsequently included desserts to their very basic menu. It just so happened to be a dessert I yearn for on a regular -- unnaturally, regular really -- basis: funnel cake (2.25$). Score!

And their chicken is ultimately delectable. I prefer the Baked, then the Grilled, and finally the Fried. BGF. Always get the 6-piece (8.79$, as of this writing). The mac & cheese tastes so delicious, it makes me want to become a fan of mac & cheese (I am not). They have a bunch of sauces as well but I do not mess with anything besides cheddar cheese (is this the only place that has it?) and barbecue, since it is all that is truly needed in life.  

The service is so friendly, personable, and funny, they make you want to return sooner than you intended. The loyalty programme has teeth too: there is a place for your birthday and anniversary (it could be your Yelpversary if you have no partner!) online and succeeding completion of your first survey, it should be only one more visit to go before receiving your complimentary Four-Strip Meal. How cool is that? 

SDCS does not have the same roll of the tongue as BFG (Fuck Bone Grill), but there is room for some SDCC (ComicCon) parodying when it is that time of year (especially with the nerd [comic] store next door). 

Needless to say, I vociferously recommend this business. It is not like there is really much else around anyway, especially if you are walking. Look both ways at the crosswalks. - E",KtIh1kjkVESCqd2CCsQnhA,5,3,4,sTM1Xzhe3Zm9XsWIOuOpog

It's located in a strip mall on the NW corner of Charleston and Rainbow- which is right in my neighborhood, making it one of the only restaurants I frequent near my home.

The owner, Jin, is seriously the friendliest person I've met. He knows everyone's name- seriously, everyone! He always remembers me and everyone else who comes here, which makes us all keep coming back!

So now, about the food.. These chicken strips are delicious. I've tried all three varieties. The baked have so much flavor, and the grilled are great too. My favorite is the fried. These are not your typical American chicken strips- battered, sodium laden, and fried. These chicken strips are panko breaded and fried to perfection- coming out steaming hot, crispy on the outside, and perfectly moist on the inside.

I like to pair my chicken strips with a side of their incredible mac and cheese. They make it extra special by melting some fresh cheese on the top of your portion- adding some texture and oozing cheese fun!

Their french fries are great too, crispy and flaky. They obviously know what they're doing, unlike in-n-out burger, whose fries are chewy and flavorless.

Their choices of dipping sauces beat the pants off any fast food restaurant, especially your average McDonalds or Chic-Fil-A. It's fun to experiment with different flavor combinations with your strips- and it'll keep you coming back.

The prices are also extremely low. You will leave here satiated for only a few bucks. The thing that impressed me was how you can add more strips to your meal for low price as well. And an extra side of mac and cheese is only a buck fifty. Score!!

Try this place- it's more than a hipster teenager hang out. To me, it's the best bang for your buck in Vegas. If you're looking for some good food cheap, BFG is your place.",6TSQGF2-pSITBb9aXVCNAA,4,2,5,EmpWRt0_B6Xf9P4iJ0VPjw

The fried ones are crispy not oily or soggy (panko crumbs) and not dried out. The grilled strips were great too. The fries were fresh and crispy and not soggy, bland or overly salted but perfect. The sauces were perfect compliments to everything, there's a flavor for everyone. The chicken nachos were bomb! It was tasty without being overly done, like it was enough to eat the entire thing without being stuffed to the gills. Best thing is it's good value for your $.

We came here for an early dinner after an appointment.  I had read the great reviews of Yelp friends when the restaurant had its former name but somehow I never stopped here.  That changes from now on!

We ordered two four strip dinners with chicken strips fried.  We each got French fries as our side and two ranch sauces, a wasabi, and a cheese sauce.  Within a short time, we were brought our dinners that were served in a to go box for convenience and to take with you if you don't finish.

The chicken strips were great!  The French fries were quite good.  I didn't think the garlic bread had much garlic taste but I may be too jaded by overuse of garlic.  My wife really liked the ranch sauce and the wasabi was my favorite.  For dessert, we split a chocolate funnel cake.

Everything about our visit was really good.  The staff was super friendly, the prices are reasonable, and although it's a really small space we enjoyed dining in.

3985816,2013-01-30,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"This tiny little place is soon to become one of my favorite chicken joints.

BFG stands for Baked, Fired, Grilled.  The chicken strips here are, obviously, served 3 ways...

I have tried fried & grilled and I am impressed with the flavor.  The wasabi cream dipping sauce is divine.  As for sides, I have tried & enjoyed only the grilled veggies (2 skewers of zucchinni, onions, & grape tomatoes) and the baked macaroni & cheese.  Again, very good flavor & 2 kinds of cheese on the mac & cheese.  The other item I have tasted isn't strictly in the BFG category : the Chicken Nachos.  Refer to Angela H.'s review on this item of which I wholeheartedly agree.  After I have tried more items and the quality remains consistent, I'll probably upgrade my rating to 5/5...

Last visit here I went with a 2 strip combo. This comes with 2 chicken strips (duh), one side, a dipping sauce, & a 12oz drink for $4.95 (I think).  I decided on the healthy route & got grilled strips (with some type of lightly sweet Asian marinade) and the grilled vegetables.  The taste was outstanding. 

The owner came out, knew the person I was with and remembered my face from my last visit.  He really wanted to know my name and it seems he is genuinely interested in pleasing his customers.

Lastly, it is open until 10 pm every day, so you can get your eat on relatively late.",K2-KRkqecWxmwqPHQWVZbA,1,1,4,sQd6YlLgBAt8V26tYbdhkg

I would have to agree with Tien, the staff is what really elevates this small, mom and pop restaurant to 4 stars.  The staff is very friendly and really tries to engage you conversation.  They are also constantly checking on you while you are waiting and eating.  Making sure you have utensils, napkins, enough to drink, etc.  They will happily refill your drink for free if you are running low.

The food is also pretty good.  I opted for the fried chicken vs the grilled or baked.  And I chose the grilled vegies, which a nice healthier side order option.  The fried chicken fingers were panko breaded so it was very crunchy, but not oily.  I picked the BFG and wasabi sauce.  The BFG sauce is best described as a sour thousand island dressing.  The wasabi was mild, but definitely identifiable.  The wasabi was a good choice for the chicken, while the BFG was better on the vegies.

My only gripe with this place is they do not allow you to mix and match chicken styles.",gqpnDoFx42U5NdtejYfKOg,8,6,4,I22arVgQR8sHDcfb1bDuIA

Chicken strips can be easy to dry out, if not done right, but man...whether it was fried or baked these strips were always moist and seasoned just right. My boyfriend loved the fried because he loves panko breaded chicken :)  The mac n cheese....ohhh gooey cheesy goodness. Actually baked in the oven.

well, long story short, we were in town for less than 48 hours and we managed to come back and eat here twice! Thats how good it was. It was the best $6 meal I'd had for as far back as I can remember...

Located next to Home Depot on Rainbow, b/t Charleston and Alta. Seems like a mom n' pop shop with great chicken strips. Service is friendly and fast with simple menu. 

I went with their 6-piece chicken strip combo ($9.70 with tax) which comes with small piece of bread, a choice of side (baked mac n'cheese, fries or veggies) and 3 choices of sauce. For side, I went ahead with baked mac n' cheese that everyone and their dog raved about. As for sauce, I decided to try bbq, strip sauce and ranch. 

They have 3 different options for their chicken strips. I got the baked one which is rotisserie style, but they also have fried which has panko breading and grilled option for more healthy choice. 

Baked chicken had light seasoning and went well with all 3 sauces I got. Mac n' cheese was cheesy and good. I wish the piece of garlic bread they provided was a bigger piece. Perfect size to feed the pigeon walking around but not enough for a starving human being. 

Great comfort food. I wish they made 8 or 10 piece combo too because 6 is just not enough..I would come back again though.",mEzc6LeTNiQgIVsq3poMbg,8,8,4,0j0L3G5N3aooiYdzF_eyHQ

And if you go to the gym down the street I heavily recommend BFG's baked or grilled chicken strips pre or post workout!  If you want to something completely healthy then come here (minus the bread). 

The skewered veggies (that must take a while to put together) is made perfectly.  

Because of a recent intern-yelp-event I was able to sample all of the sauces that you get to choose with your chicken strips.  My favorite is the wasabi and sweet chili!  With the buffalo and bfg coming in 3rd and 4th.

The reason this place is bumped up to 5 stars is because of Jin and his family that run the place!  Jin is usually seen in the front counter and is really personable and remembers every customer who has ever been there!  If you go I would recommend you put the chicken hat on and take a picture with Jin!

After hearing about BFG Chicken Strips for months through the grapevine, I was finally able to get over there today and check this joint out.  And boy was I a happy camper once I got my delicious lunch!

As the name states, you can get chicken strips baked, fried, or grilled.  I went for fried because is there really a choice when fried is an option?  So I ordered the 4 piece combo and went for the mac n' cheese as a side.  I was with my mom who ordered the same except went for the fries, so I got to sample both.  

The mac n' cheese, as stated in so many other reviews, is simply amazing!  It was cheesy heaven with a bit of pasta thrown in to make it easier to eat.  Yummy!  The fries were right on as well.  Great crispy fries without being too crunchy.  They also have grilled veggies, but if it's healthy, I never get it, so I can't comment on that side option.

A great addition to the food were the numerous dipping sauce choices.  I love dipping stuff into other stuff. The more dipping options I have, the better!  I heart condiments.  With that being said, BFG has 9 sauces to pick from to dip your delicious chicken into.  We went with the BFG, BBQ, Honey Mustard, and Ranch sauces.  All were good but I do have to say the BFG sauce really complimented the chicken nicely.  As for the Honey Mustard, they must put crack in it, because I am addicted.  I don't even need to dip anything in it because I think I would drink it, if I could.  I'm a classy chick, can't you tell?

So yes, BFG Chicken Strips is a great hole in the wall place.  If you are in the area or love good chicken fingers, go check them out.",8DBH3BpLINfTAK_Up5BtUQ,15,9,4,CnscpGpbTvhhYVZnrlWOBA

After months of eying this place, we finally made it for a spur of the moment lunch. We wanted to actually stop by on Sunday, but thanks to Yelp, it told us that they were closed. I made my fiancé meet me up at BFG's for lunch today. It was definitely worth the drive and being late for work.  I walked in and #1 combo caught my eye....the mac and cheese sold me. The fiancé ordered the #2 combo. 

Service was pretty awesome. One of the owners noticed that we were newbies to BFG's and took the time to explain to us what the different selections of chicken were. He also came back repeatedly to check on how we were doing. For a ""fast"" food joint, that's some pretty dang good service. 

For the food, I definitely did not go wrong with the #1. The baked chicken was so tender and juicy, it makes my mouth water thinking about it. It was seasoned with a rotisserie spice and baked. Also, the fact that it's juicy white meat wins them the 5 stars. I am not a dark meat fan and for those dark meat lovers, this white chicken will have you fooled. I liked that you could choose the different sauces although I ate most of my chicken without sauce. Mac and cheese was definitely cheesy. I'm a cheese whore, so this definitely met my standards. I was able to try the fried chicken and it was tender and juicy inside. I do think I prefer the baked chicken over the fried chicken though BUT that's just MY opinion. 

Overall, the chicken is very delicious and anyone who hasn't tried this place is missing out. We definitely will be back for more baked and fried goodness.

4238449,2015-12-14,3,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"Ok so I came across 'Strip N Dip' while yelping a couple of weeks ago.  As per my check-in comment ""my fat-ass saw a picture of the NACHO FRIES"" and made a detour on the way home.  

There is only one location at the moment, and it happens to be on the other side of town for me.  However, I happened to be in the northwest yesterday and what a co-wink-a-dink they are too...so on to the review

Very small menu, you have the option of chicken, um chicken and oh yea chicken.  Also, baked mac&cheese, grilled vegs and funnel cake.  Chicken comes grilled or friend and like 10 different dipping sauce options, I;m not sure if those ore homemade or not.  Small interior space yet very very clean, friendly staff, and received a coupon for my next visit.

My item of choice: NACHO FRIES, hmm...where do I start???

I mean you get a lot of food for a reasonable price, the amount of fries and topping that was in the tray would had easily cost me $10+ at the competitors (which happens to be in the same business lot as Strip n Dip, ends with the letter ""O"") but that neither here nor there

For my personal liking the cut of the french fry was too thick, the plate is layered as: 
FRIES on the bottom
REFRIED BEANS on top of the fries
CHOPPED CHICKEN on top of the beans
ONIONS and TOMATOES on top of the chicken
SOUR CREAM and NACHO CHEESE on top of the onions and tomatoes
topped off with GREEN ONIONS

don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, it was just bland, it reminded me of a Nacho Bell Grande and its been over 5+ years since I've eaten one of those.  As I was waiting for my food, I said to myself ""should I get get some dipping sauce"" then thought otherwise...I should've got some dipping sauce, because I surely did make up a quick dipping sauce to drizzled atop of my nacho fries and topped it with some JALAPENOS.  It was missing that kickback of SPICY-NESS, you hear nachos you think of HEAT of some sort.  It was not there for me, but a great meal for my 5yr old.

I'll go back (I have a coupon) to try the mac&cheese and the funnel cake, if I find myself on that side of town again. But this is only my opinion, go check it out for yourself and see what you think...",ikEbNrDG-0Qtmo9FFb2qwg,2,1,3,eds5hEojXEQzI9cl5x8U2A

First of all the strips are a little small. Too much breading and not enough flavor. The sauces however are great, I will say that. I think that buffalo sauce was excellent. 
For the sides, I just found most of them to be lacking in flavor. Mac and cheese as well as the veggies the same. Not my cup of tea I guess, and I just find Caine's to be a superior product to this place. This is not a chain however and I would not want to discourage people from coming in and giving them a try.

The Mac and cheese was also delicious.  Very cheesy and a great crust of cheese on top.  Could have used a little more salt though.  Garlic bread could have just been left out.  Nothing special there.  

Dipping sauces were the best part of the meal.  The wasabi cream was the best.  The sweet chili dipping sauce and the honey mustard had great flavor.  The BFG sauce was just a plain old fry sauce with a little extra acid.

1) their chicken strips are really freaking good. I got them fried, and they had like a light panko breading. I was impressed! 

2) the sauces were also delicious. I got the buffalo, wasabi, and strip sauce. Strip sauce was pretty good but the other 2 were unbelievably good. 

3) the fries were really good too. Nicely fried, as you would expect with such perfectly fried tenders!

4) they have the new coke machine where you can make any drink you want! The large cup for the soda was also the nicest cup I've gotten in a fast food place. I'll be keeping it and using it at home. 

Now for the reasons it's not a five, and was even close to being knocked to a 3:

1) the place stunk like shit. No exaggeration. My fiancé and I were looking forward to a casual sit down dinner, but we couldn't stand the smell for more than a minute or so. I asked the staff, and they said the place next door doesn't do their sewage sometimes so then the smell makes its way over to strip n dip. I get its out of their hands, but omg it was disgusting 

2) the Mac and cheese was weak, like real weak. You know when you get excited about mac and cheese, and then it's tasteless? That's what this is. Tasteless. Very disappointed. 

3) Value. Well, I'll maybe say I was neutral on this. I spent 20 bucks, one drink, a 6 piece meal and a 4 piece meal. Too much? Yes. However it was a bunch of food and we were stuffed. 

I'll be back for the chicken fingers for sure, just hope the place doesn't force us to take out because of the smell",x-W0OQiUdNLsoMhg6GfXSg,4,0,4,Lcqdgz2r040RVQA6wbBpgg

Fried tenders 2/5 stars
they seemed way over cooked when I saw the lady box them up but it was from a distance so I wasn't 100% sure. But when I got home..definitely over cooked. Tenders without any sauce just was bland. 

mac and cheese 1/5 stars
Very boring mac and cheese, tasted like the box kind and they just put shredded cheese on top to melt it. 

Ranch 3 stars, 
I'm a huge ranch lover so I'm picky and their ranch was decent. 

House sauce 2 stars
I guess everyone now has their version of 'came sauce' but I didnt care for it, to tangy. 

toasted garlic bread 4 stars

Was comfort-foodin' it since it was 25 degrees outside and the mac-n-cheese was steaming hot.  

The great part about this resto, besides the above, is that you can dial in how healthy you want to eat. Go grilled chicken, steamed veg and/or salad and you're on track. Feelin' a little carbie/cheesy - mac/cheese and garlic bread. Want to get your fried grub on, there you go - fried strips.

Drive to St. George for Chik-Fil-A? Nah. Cane's? Hmm. Ah, so I consulted Yelp and up came Strip N Dip. I remember bookmarking this one awhile ago as BFG Chicken Strips. Apparently the restaurant has gone through some changes since then, and it had a stint where it was closed, but - it is back open and man, is it good.

The location is a little odd, tucked into a shopping center sandwiched between Albertsons and Home Depot. It is small, few tables and a bar, with a few tables for outdoor seating. But the inside is cool with vibrant posters and a digital menu reader board. 

My husband and I both opted for the fried 4-strip meal with the baked mac and cheese. The mac and cheese reminded me of a little personal pizza sitting in my basket. When I dug in its ooey-gooeyness and delicious cheesiness was sublime! I think more people should put cheese over macaroni like they do. 

As for the strips - absolutely perfectly done. Juicy and tender on the inside yet fried to a crispy, but not hard outside. The panko breading I really enjoyed, my husband said he would have rather had a normal batter-like outside like Cane's does. *shrugs* Dipping sauces - I went with the Strip Sauce, of course, had to try that one and it is very good and addicting. And I opted for the buffalo because I wanted a bit of heat. Both good, but next time I'm definitely going for that wasabi one. 

The service was SO NICE! These guys are really trying hard to make customers feel very welcome. You could even say it is a familial vibe here.

If you like Cane's, you must try Strip N Dip. Just for an alternative because they are really doing chicken strips right.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,5,3,5,mcvuePLDZk0sDHV5lWy5lQ

At first was a little skeptical as this is located at a slightly run down plaza.  

After we arrived there were a lot more people coming in to order food. Now we know why 

Probably by far one of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  Ordered both the grilled and fried 
Fried chicken retained its juiciness and the panko fried chicken was nothing I've ever had before.  Crunchy yet melts in your mouth.  Lots of different sauces to choose from.  I recommend the sweet chili.  
The grilled chicken was delicious as well.  Wrapped in aluminum foil reminded me of backyard bbq. Very tasty and juicy.

I enjoyed the Honey Mustard more because it wasn't bitter like the Wasabi. I also loved the veggie kabobs which were full of flavor!

We tried the bakes, fried, and grilled strips.  My favorite was, of course, the fried.  The batter was light and crisp - I think someone said the breading is panko?  We got two sauce, the Chili Thai and the BFG sauce, which is similar to Thousand Island.  The Chili Thai sauce was dark brown rather than red and had a kick to it, but it was good.  I liked it more than the BFG sauce.  However, I do think that the sauce at Raisin' Cane's is the best.  We also ordered the Thai Ice Coffee.  My friend really liked it bc it wasn't very sweet, whereas I had to put more sugar in mine.  Thai Iced Coffee is  usually pretty sweet, but this one wasn't.

It can be a little difficult to find in the big parking lot/strip mall, but just drive over to Home Depot and you will see it's right there. 

We decided to try all the sauces, but the BBQ, because they don't make the BBQ in house. (They don't make the ranch either, but I like it with the buffalo sauce). The other sauces were as follows:
Sweet chili - great
Teriyaki - good
Buffalo - good
Wasabi - good 
Cheese - good (they don't make this either)
Strip sauce - my fav!!!

I order the 4 piece fried with a side of Mac and Cheese. The strip are crunchy with the Pablo breading and the sauces made them super yummy. 

The Mac and Cheese is pretty good too.  They make it with a creamy cheese sauce like a velvetta, and then cover it with a cheesy topping to make it gooey and delish!
Even the garlic bread was good. 

We split a serving of the funnel cake with the strawberry and whipped cream on the side. Both of us agreed that it didn't need the toppings and it was perfect with just powdered sugar. 

I even had leftover Mac and cheese, and I stuck it in the over for 10 min the next day and it was just as good as the first time.",-50XWnmQGqBgEI-9ANvLlg,4,1,5,X69-URD4lcYtnqfF5YxoxA

So we take our food home and start munching! A lot of people suggest this place is like raising canes but besides the fact that BFG serves fries, chicken, and garlic bread, all 3 of which are very different from raising canes! I love both places!! The fried chicken strips were fried using panko bread crumbs and were still crazy crunchy when I got home! The grilled strips were flavorful and cooked perfectly. I didn't care for the fries...I think they could one up raising canes even more by cooking fresh cut fries, probably more cost effective too!!

The place is cute and little and the boys that were working there when my family and I stopped by were SUUUPER friendly and helped us out a lot since we told them that it was our first time coming in.

I ordered the grilled chicken strips and my bf and baby got the crispy ones. The grilled chicken was delicious, I liked the panko breaded crispy ones and we ordered a bunch of sauces but none of them stood out like the creamy wasabi did. I honestly just want to go there and order a tub of that stuff so I can slather it on whatever I eat at home and other restaurants. Their grilled vegetables still had a lot of crisp to them (which I appreciate) and their french fries were......I can't remember. They're french fries. They were hot, crispy, and they had carbs.

I liked that the macaroni and cheese has a crusty top, but when I ate a spoonful of it, it really didn't blow me away. I mean it's faaaaaaar from being the disgusting kraft mac and cheese with the gross cheese powder, but I feel like the Velveeta Shells Mac N' Cheese is better.

4659396,2016-12-09,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"Probably the best chicken fingers I've had outside a bar. 

Puts PDQ to shame - and I like PDQ a lot. Makes Cane's seem even more inedible than usual. 

Nice light crispy crust, chicken had a quality taste and texture. At some restaurants you get gamey or tough chicken strips, or worst of all tendons, or enough crust to seem like some kind of 2 year old savory donut. Not at all the case with these. Delicious and tender are all you find here. 

I had a 6 strip meal delivered by Uber Eats. I hadn't eaten all day so the loaded fries won me over as an upgrade. I got wasabi cream, ranch, and strip sauce as my dips. And a Thai iced coffee. 

The chicken strips have won me over. Done. 

The loaded fries were okay...I'm glad I got them...they were actually really tasty. I don't know where I'm going with this. They reminded me of ""carne asada fries"" but easier to consume and brighter in flavor. 

The dips were mixed. The ranch is underwhelming but not bad. The strip sauce is unique - pretty much what you'd expect from the genre, creamy, tangy, and a little strange. The wasabi cream though...new favorite dip of all time. Unabashedly in love with it. 

Lastly. The Thai iced coffee. Not my favorite. I've never had Thai iced coffee...but I'm familiar with the concept, and an unapologetic coffee nerd. I was expecting a more unique spice flavor, but it mostly tasted like oxidized coffee concentrate with a little more sugar than i would normally use to make coffee from a continental breakfast drinkable. Maybe this is just me not liking this preparation method. Maybe it's not very good. Who could say. 

Anyway...aside from the coffee being mediocre...the food is incredibly good, and I've already determined I'll be a return customer, and probably sooner than later. Very highly recommended based on my first experience.",YG-Vg20GYIA6dHRg5SRJZg,1,1,5,C0qjsSBXGC0jL0xnEbUlQg

4719732,2011-02-19,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"Honestly I would say  BFG is a  2.5  (I always round up.)

The location itself is very small. Upon walking in you can tell its a High Schooler hang out. Which is kind of a bummer seeing how there was a group of HS kids that took up half of the whole restaurant. 

The prices are very affordable. But the food I thought was lacking. Mind you I haven't tried the entire menu but over all I found it lacking. The fried strips are tempura style. They are light and crisp but in the end I have had many more flavorful tempura encounters. I will say that I enjoyed the grilled fingers but they weren't anything to write home about. With your fingers you get to choose 2 sauces. Based on other reviews I chose the wasabi cream and sweet chili. The wasabi cream had the taste of wasabi but no kick. The kick being the only reason I like wasabi made this sauce very disappointing. The sweet chili sauce was very flavorful and tasted great with the grilled strips and fries. Last but not least was the Mac and Cheese which was incredibly bland. As soon as I tasted it I knew what was missing; onion. But I guess I shouldn't expect such things from a restaurant such as this.  

The highlight of this establishment is the owner; Jin. He is very friendly and talks to all his customers and even remembers your name from previous visits. But after being here twice I don't think I will revisit. 

The bottom line is: They serve affordable food aimed towards teenagers and broke college students. Great service but mediocre food. Common sense states ""You Get What You Pay For.""

4744307,2011-10-24,6,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"BFG...now THEY do chicken right.  Whether your appetite is calling for baked, fried or grilled chicken, Jin will do you right.  The menu is kept simple and sticks to what they do best.  There are several combos to choose from, but I think many will customize their own meal: choose your chicken, your side and two sauces.  Easy peasy mac'n'cheesy!

I'm a big fan of the grilled chicken.  The baked is easily some of the best baked chicken I've had and the fried is the most unique fried chicken I've had (thanks to the panko flakes used for breading).  But the grilled chicken gets you the grill flavor without drying up the poultry.  Go for the wasabi sauce to give your chicken some kick.

With your chicken you're given a choice of side, and you also get a slice of bread.  The mac'n'cheese is awfully cheesy in the best way possible, making it one of those foods you enjoy eating because you know you shouldn't be eating too much of it.

Service here is great, with Jin checking on all of his customers during their stay.  He's a really personable guy, seemingly remembering every customers name once they step through the door.  (He remembered my name after one visit!)  The one thing that bummed me out in the past was that my BFG cravings always came on a Sunday, the one day they're closed!

4787737,2011-05-26,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"*Best Chicken Strips in Las Vegas*

Really enjoyed this place, easily some of the best chicken strips I've ever had. They have a simple menu but it is by no means limiting with the various options you can mix and match your meal with. BFG lets you know everything you need to know about the chicken choices Baked, Fried, or Grilled. Once you chose the chicken you have the tough decision of which of the 9 dipping flavors to choose from; Wasabi Cream, BBQ, Ranch, Buffalo, Honey Mustard, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, Cheese, and BFG (their house dipping sauce). And finally accompanying each meal is a piece of toast and your final decision between a side of Mac n cheese, grilled vegetables, or fries.

Now let me start off by saying that all the different types of chicken are delicious. I was a bit skeptical about the baked chicken but let me tell you, they know how to do it right. Whenever I picture baked chicken, it seems bland but at BFG they spice it just right to give it a kick in flavor. The grilled chicken has a bit of sauce giving it a unique flavor setting it aside from the baked. And finally the fried chicken is amazing! These aren't your run of the mill chicken strips you get at a bar. You'll notice the difference immediately due to their use Panko instead of regular batter which I love because it gives the chicken a nice crispy texture with just the right amount of breading. 

Now the sauces are really up to personal preference. and the majority are pretty run of the mill so I'll just get into their ""unique"" sauces. The BFG house sauce has a very light undertone flavor resembling thousand island and other flavors that will need more tastings to get down. The sweet chili sauce is an asian style sauce with the spices in it working very well with the sweet flavor of it. I was very surprised by how well the sweet chili worked with the chicken. When I first saw and smelled the Sweet chili sauce it seemed like it did not belong next to chicken strips, but when you take your first bite of a chicken strip covered in this sauce it will all make sense. It's a delicious flavor explosion in your mouth with the sweet chili enhancing the flavor of the chicken. Easily on of my favorites. Now the wasabi cream is pretty straight forward, it tastes like wasabi. But it is not nearly as overwhelming as actual wasabi and it has none of the burn. It is another surprising flavor that I have not seen anywhere else and that taste delicious.

I haven't gotten a chance to try the grilled vegetables but to me the mac n cheese and fries were not really anything special. And the toast tastes like toast. Also every week they have a new special which I have yet to try any of so when I get a chance I'll update my review.

Overall good service, good food, and decently priced. There really isn't much else to say other than if you haven't tried BFG yet, try it!",eSo5hmAF_UW1N5XFsx0q7Q,2,1,5,FFSARYt_I8nOOVYKeiAuOw
4798002,2013-10-16,1,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"I was so excited to try out BFG (now Strip N Dip), since I've been seeing the excellent reviews pop up on Yelp for a few months now. *sigh* I didn't like it, and man I wanted to like it. I got the baked chicken (it was just kinda wet and slimy and the flavor didn't wow me at all), mac and cheese (mostly bubbly cheese, which tasted alright but too much for my guts), garlic bread (overwhelmingly garlic-y), honey mustard (not the best but also alright), and sweet chili (blech). 

I am NOT a picky eater, but this was just a bummer. Maybe the fried strips are better? Maybe I should have tried the wasabi sauce people rave about? I don't know... Money is tight these days, so if I'm going out for lunch it better be good. I won't be rushing back for sure.

4891766,2013-01-14,1,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"My new fave American food in town. My hubby and I like to search yelp and see what is a 4 1/2 to 5 star place and try it. No matter how far it is. That's what brought us from Henderson to Rainbow and 95. 

We were greeted by a friendly person who ended up being one of the owners, Matt. I noticed right away that he really did have a passion for what he does. I think that the most successful people differ from the others because of their passion. With his help, we ordered the family meal which more than fed me, hubby, syd, cam, and luke. And might I add that we are all big eaters and all have active Yelp profiles detailing our eating escapades (except for luke, he's 3). First, the baked mac n cheese was a revelation. I can make some good stuff, but this one closely rivals my own personal recipe. It's sooo delish. The fries and the veggies were stellar. The chicken comes in 3 styles: baked with rotisserrie season, fried with panko, and grilled with asian marinade. My hubby asked which I liked the best and I couldn't even choose. 

They are embarking on a catering biz, too. We have committed to Matt to use him for the whole next year of kid birthday parties. This is the perfect food for a crowd, or to drop into for a quick lunch.

The new owners have kept it consistent for awhile now and that's a good thing. The rewards system no longer constantly changes. 

CONS: We've had the fries be soggy on a couple of large meals, so that kept us away for awhile. Smaller batches are always good. My biggest gripe is that the price of garlic bread and extra sauce, just like the rent, is too damned high.

If you are selling $45 worth of chicken, charging fiddy cent extra for less than two tablespoons of sauce is ridiculous. Ain't nobody got time for dat nor for paying half a buck for barely garlic butter bread when the whole loaf costs a buck.",yExLpVbCfVqVixYwzMaeZw,3,1,4,om76MS1C6t7kATmyC11FWw

I really enjoyed the meal. The chicken and the sauce it was served with tasted really good and I ate it all!

BFG...it stands for Baked, Fried, or Grilled if you missed that part.  

The menu can't be any simpler - it puts In N Out's menu to shame.

With five combos to choose from and a create your own combo, it makes ordering super easy. 

Their fried chicken strips come in a four count and they are special because they are panko covered and deep fried.  Yes, that makes all the difference.  But wait, there's more beyond the chicken!  I'm talking about the wasabi cream dipping sauce that we can't get enough of.  Sure, there are other flavors and you get two with your order, but we're all about the wasabi cream!  Yum!  I've also tried their grilled chicken and was impressed with how moist it was.  Next time I'll have to check out their baked version.

Of course, I have to mention their individually baked mac and cheese side, right?  They are so gooey and hot, and that's what you call a serious baked mac and cheese.  They definitely got that right!  A little more work on their end but definitely appreciated and worth it!  Or if you must, you can have grilled veggies or fries as a side.

And there's still more to rave about - the garlic bread is good too!

Another perk - loyalty stamp cards!  Yes, that's right!  You get a stamp for every combo meal you order, so it's easy breezy to get a free combo meal with this plan!  

And finally, I cannot say enough about the customer service there.  Jin is the nicest guy around - not only does he make a honest and sincere effort to know who you are (and remember your name), but he also comes around to check on you if you're dining in.  They really make you feel at home and special and I have to give major props to that alone because it really makes a huge difference.

I also have to give props to the rest of the staff because you don't have a lazy bunch working here.  They are always coming around to wipe down the tables, push in chairs, offer free dessert, and just make sure you're happy.  

Their only real fault is that their location is too small!  But that only means they should open a few more locations to make our lives easier!  Yes, that's right.  Check out their weekly specials too!  They have a great thing going on here!",rt3PC7WCgCKsoufmQJELfw,12,8,5,t0H34Xjp4-t-Fb4cqUimvw

The chicken is always perfectly prepared in whatever form.  Baked, Fried, or Grilled. (BFG get it?)   The perfection of the chicken strip, what ever the cooking method  would easily make for a 5 star review, but wait, let's talk about the mac and cheese.  Bubbly hot, silky smooth and simply delicious. From the first mouth searing bite to the bitter end of licking the bowl clean, it is simply heaven. Woo-Hoo this sounds good, but wait, there is a another layer to drool over, the signature dipping sauces.   My personal favorite is the Wasabi cream.  Just enough heat to bring the tears, but so good you can't stop.  Bring  a straw and love the burn.  The thai sweet chili is very unique with a mild heat and a multitude of flavorful back tones. The honey mustard is subtle and is a nice counterpoint to the more powerful flavors mentioned above.  If you prefer something a bit more mellow,there are several more varieties for your consideration

We have perfectly prepared chicken, exceptional side dishes and incredible dipping sauces, what else could you ask for?  How about an owner that is the penultimate example of customer service?

This place has a small menu, and everything on it, they do right. The prices were incredible, too! We ordered a whole bunch of food, got plenty full, and only spent $14!

Before I start, BEST GRILLED VEGETABLES EVER. Perfectly cooked, great grill marks, fresh, tasty veg. YAY!!! If you like spicy, grab the sriracha on the counter and squeeze it on the veggies. A-mazing.

The fried chicken strips, with a crispy panko crust, are the best. Our next favorite were the grilled, followed by the baked. They were all plenty good, though!

Their sauces were awesome. Loooved the honey mustard. BBQ sauce was good!

The baked mac and cheese is really cheesy--medium cheddar sauce, mozzarella crust. Rich, but it's a small side portion and ends up being perfect.

Service was great too--the employees looked like they might be a bunch of punks, but they were super polite and courteous and even made friendly small talk with us as they came around and cleaned up tables! They even remembered that we were in town on a road trip when they came out and chatted with us about that. Good employees!!!

I am however pleased that the food is just as good, tastes the same. I got my favorite like always - the perfectly crisp fried strips, grilled veggie skewers or fries, honey mustard and wasabi. 

I like that the weekly specials like the hot chick and the nachos are just on the permanent menu instead of a weekly rotating special. No teriyaki bowl or bibimbap that I noticed being still on the menu. Sucks, teriyaki bowls here are great with the strips and I used to always order that. 

Service is efficient. They're friendly and smiley enough, but I guess things will never be the same if people aren't as personable. I know, I know. I sound like I'm whining over something trivial...

SITREP

I have to give mad props to both my Vegas Yelp-buds Anthony and Jade since they turned me onto the GREAT CHEEESY establishment BFG Chicken Strips while I was hangin with them in Vegas for the Yelp Convention back in May 2012.

THE MAC MENU

Mac N' Cheese here is TRULY an ultimate ""Classic American Eats"", as a SIDE dish OR get a BUNCH like I did at just under $2 a pop, and why not? - I took them back to my hotel room at the Stratosphere one late night and make it a MAIN dish.  Mmmm, delish!

SPECIAL PREPARATION!

BFG Chicken Strips meets a cheesaholic's strict-standards of ""cheesification"".  They make incredible BAKED Mac N' Cheese in individual containers with a Mozzarella Crust!  (HOLY HELL.  I feel my arteries hardening with joy just thinking about this festive cheesapalooza!)

I got the baked chicken, but I wish I'd just gone ahead and gotten the fried (damn me and my new healthy lifestyle initiative!). The baked chicken was good, but it was too salty for my taste. Maybe I'm just really sensitive to salt?

Went with the fried and grilled sets.  Both were good, but I liked the fried ones best....the breading is soft and yummy, and chicken is tender on both.

The real winner here are the sauces.  If I was eating everything without the sauces, it would be pretty boring IMO.  They have a handful of sauces, and our favs were the wasabi and the sweet chili.  The honey mustard was good, as was the teriyaki.

And the mac and cheese is very good!  Easily the best mac and cheese that isn't in a gourmet setting that I have enjoyed so far.

The baby loved all the food, and had tons of fun dipping into all the goodies here.  Should be a cool place to bring the little ones!

And just like everyone else said, the portions of chicken are a little on the small side...the 4 piece combo filled me up for the most part, but don't expect Canes sizes or you should be ordering extra pieces.  They really just need to offer a 6 piece combo, and I think that will fill up most everybody.

I read the reviews for BFG Chicken Strips and was even inspired with all the reviews made by all the members of Yelp.  I made the suggestion to my boss to eat here for lunch and she happily agreed.  Considering we always order to go, I placed a call for pick up.  Towards of the end of the conversation, the cashier over the phone advised me it would be ready in six minutes.  Whoa!  Wait a minute, I'm about a good 15 minutes away!  He was kind enough to tell the cooks to start cooking six minutes before I arrive.  

Off I went immediately after I hung up the phone.  Almost there I thought, however I got lost.  Who gets lost in Charleston and Rainbow?  Because I couldn't find the place, I made a few u-turns and finally decided to go towards Home Depot.  Yup, there it was hiding next to Home Depot.  That hardware retail store has a way of keeping any small establishments from being seen on Rainbow Road.

Luckily, it wasn't swamped with a ton of people like I thought it would be.  I walked straight in and there were a few people seated and another few lined up to order.  It was awesome how the cashier would talk to each customer as if he's known them for a while.  First names of each customer were said at least three times before they were done ordering.  That's very impressive.  But, that is the difference between a mom and pop's shop and a big corporation fast food chain.  It's more personal.

My boss and I ordered the same lunch, #4, Build Your Own!  We decided to get four fried strips, baked Mac and cheese, garlic bread, two sauces, and regular drink all for $5.75 plus tax.  :D  I was excited to take this back to the office and just devour it as the aroma was teasing me and calling out my name.

As soon as I got back to the office, we sat down and I just delved in as though I hadn't eaten in a month. What can I say?  I love to pig out.  To describe my meal:  A swirl of rainbows just came over me as I bit in to the chicken strip.  The breading was so lightly crisp and the meat was just so tender; the seasoning, was just right.  It didn't even need sauce, but I got the BFG sauce which is like a Thousand Island dressing with more zest to it and Ranch.  Mmmmm... you are just so yummy!  I'm still imagining it right now.  The baked Mac and cheese was heavenly too with gooey cheese of awesomeness!  That garlic bread was one of the best garlic breads I've had with lots of flavor and the right texture when biting in to it.  I'm closing my eyes as I'm typing this and reminiscing Tuesday's lunch.  

My boss even said, ""Good call on lunch!""  Yup, I got brownie points that day.  Thank you BFG!  Now I have to figure out what to eat for lunch today.  I hope it'll be equal or top this lunch.",QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,7,7,5,nIGIKPpofmRMfg8n6LISSg

Maybe, you can find a job as a door stop or stand-in food on a local tv shoot, but I wouldn't plan on staying in the real food business for too long because personally I'd much rather have one of the tasty strips from BFG. 

Of course, the fact that I have never enjoyed foods that still have bones helps my appreciation for a fine chicken strip, but I am confident most anyone would devour these treats. First, props for a simple, creative concept: baked, fried, or grilled chicken strips with matching sides. If you want baked, you can get the combo with baked mac 'n' cheese; fried comes with french fries, and grilled comes with grilled veggie skewers. You can mix it up too if you like, which we did.

We were in the mood for just a snack, so we shared a make our own combo with fried strips, mac 'n' cheese, tasty brewed iced tea, and we added some grilled veggie skewers. Everything is made to order, and comes out hot enough to burn your mouth, so be careful! Don't cram that delicious fried strip down your throat immediately. But, eventually, you will do just that. The breading reminded me of a delicious katsu, superior to most fried chicken I have sampled.

As for the sides, mac 'n' chese lovers rejoice, as the creation here is super cheesy. The cheeses might not be fancy, but it will put you in a comfort food coma for sure. For the healthier peeps, the grilled veggies are simple and delicious, too, with zucchini and onions and tomatoes. Fresh and served piping hot like everything else! 

You get two sauces, and they have a wide selection of mostly homemade options. We went with honey mustard and buffalo, and here is my one teeny complaint: the buffalo was not very spicy. I definitely think they need at least one sauce that delivers a big heat punch! I will try sweet chili next time. 

Still, that won't me prevent me from coming back. The owners are two young Asian blokes who are super personable and knew everyone's name. Regulars are always a good sign! The place is smallish and very casual with counter service, so don't get dressed up for your visit.

Creative, friendly, and tasty. I can't really think of what else you could want from a strip. Add spicy, and BFG may become the hottest local strip club. (I couldn't resist.)",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,26,24,4,fS2fr4FWm10cc2QAqIQ2pA

I feel silly for not asking for his name, but our receipt says Matt, so I hope I'm getting it right when I say Matt was really nice! he checked up on us a few times when we ate, chatted a bit, and came out and waved when we got in our cab and left.

5216791,2014-08-27,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"I odered a five piece fried strips with grilled veggie skewer. The veggies were AMAZING! The chicken was just okay. I suppose they're better than Raising Cane's (not really saying much) but that's probably because of the variety of sauces, which are also just okay, but at least they have 'em. 

Service was quick (no line) and friendly. The fried chicken strips, as a specialty, was not great. 

They do have one of those big red Coke machines with all the different flavors, which is nice, but skinny, thin straws: not nice. 

I can't imagine ever going back, except maybe to get the veggie skewer. The chicken is just not worth the time, money, or effort.

5228396,2011-04-06,3,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"It's a rare occurrence that I even post a review at all, so take it for what it is: that it is damn amazing... and I haven't even touched any food yet.

Now why can it be amazing? The service was awesome. It may be just talking to the guy and giving him a form of payment, but man does he make a conversation out of it. He even remembers a lot of the people that have come and gone, asks them how the days been, explains the menu... hell, the man pretty much did everything but explain to me how taxes work. That's called service.

(EDIT: HIS NAME IS JIN. I feel bad that I forgot the first time around. Sorry dude!!)

Anyway, let's move on to the actual food... 

 Imagine a juicy chicken strip that's moist on the inside and yet somehow crunchy and flaky on the outside. It almost doesn't seem possible (the close comparison always is Cane's, but I'll explain why that's an impossible comparison), but that's exactly what BFG has done with their Fried Chicken. It's almost unthinkable as to what madness occurred for this to be possible, but it's been done. Not only is their Fried chicken that moist, but pretty much everything else is as well. The Baked chicken strips were peppered with some seasonings and baked to perfection, it comes out very moist and tasty. I'm not one for Baked Chicken Strips, but I'd try it every once in awhile if it had come down to it.

In addition to the chicken, their sides are very well done. Naturally, if you like/love/adore/lust after Mac and Cheese, then dear god go for the Mac and Cheese; it's baked goodness in a tinfoil pie thing. Their salad was enjoyable, but if you're going there to get fried chicken in a salad, you really need to get some priorities in order and really just stop kidding yourself. 

Naturally the big kicker is their array of sauces. I'm officially a big fan of their ""BFG"" sauce, simply because it's got a bit of everything in the flavor spectrum in ""BBQ, spicy, and sweetness."" None of that made sense, but that's the only way to describe it. Their Honey Mustard is something unique as well, so if y'all love it, go for it.

All in all, BFG is a chicken place that I might very well swap for Cane's from time to time, because (1) It's good food; it's good chicken... and (2) It's closer to me than Cane's. I mean, I'll still go to both equally (Cane's is open longer, so that's always a reason I won't abandon Cane's), but somehow BFG will make it into my routine.

... oh, and having a stamp card helps too. (b^^)b =7

SIDENOTE: So I was saying why you can't compare Cane's Fried Chicken with BFG Fried Chicken... I (personally, ie. MY OWN OPINION) believe that you can't compare two different styles of fried chicken strips. Cane's uses a batter of some sort, whereas BFG uses more Panko bread crumb-type food source. It's like comparing Apples and Oranges; useless. You just need to know that Cane's is good and BFG is good too. (b^^)b",5hMoSaLGjzXUr-1W_8L32w,3,2,5,52YH2-zGo2R0J4sTRBsRnQ

Although I was basically trying to eat ""healthy"", I tried the grilled, fried, and baked strips (I did it for Yelp - how can I rate a place without trying it all?)! I'm with Ann Marie - the grilled were actually my favorite. They put just enough glaze on them to give them flavor without being overpowering. They were grilled to order (guy threw them on the grill right when I placed my order!) and were so delicious. 

Baked wasn't all that special, but fried were awesome ! No idea how they aren't greasy ? Panko ..mmmm.. so light, so fresh, and so ""not fried"" tasting. Love it ! 

I was thrilled to death to get 2 skewers of fresh delicious veggies with my chicken (green peppers, onions, tomatoes - yum!). I also tried a plethora of sauces. For you wasabe peeps, you'll love that wasabe cream sauce. My coworker was very pleased to find liquid cheese (like that kind that put on nachos at ballparks!), but I couldn't stop eating the BFG house sauce. It kinda reminds me of In-n-out special sauce, but yummier.

5237197,2010-08-23,2,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"More of a 4.5. BFG is GOOD chicken! get ready for me to say ""really good"" 100 times.

(Full disclosure: I know the owners/chefs, but that won't make me go twice in a week. The FOOD makes me go back 2x!)

Portion sizes are plenty! The meals are $5.75, I think, and that is 4 strips, plenty of fries/sides with dipping sauces. Here's what we've had:

Grilled Chicken is juicy and has a very nice, fresh yet mild marinade. The quality of the chicken seem higher than grilled chicken you get at KFC or other fast foods.

Fried Chicken is panko-breaded which is a great switch from the norm, and just as juicy as the grilled chicken. If you want a fuller meal, go for these! My husband thinks this portion size borders on large. I don't love fried food, because I tend to feel the grease in my mouth for hours (cough cough, CANES). But these are fresh and leave the plate dry! No grease there. Super good.

The french fries are super good. They are the kind of fries that have that texture like they've been rolled in a batter, on the skinny side, with just enough salt to make them irresistible.

The grilled veggies (zucchini or squash, onions, roma tomatoes) are a point of contention for me. I thought they tasted great (they seem to be lightly marinated in the same sauce as the grilled chicken), but the cuts of veggies were on the small side. That is a personal preference for me, though. I would rather have a crunchy bite of zucchini in there still. 

THE DIPS: Oh Em Gee!!
BFG rounds out their high-quality chicken with amazing, freshly made (I think they are homemade?!) dips that range from regular to wacky.

Honey Mustard like I used to get in the south! you can see the mustard seeds in there! I loved it with the fries and fried ckn.

BFG sauce is good, it seems to be something like a soy with a thicker base, with a little sweetness and seasonings? I can't figure it out, but its really good on the grilled chicken.

Wasabi Cream! Nice Choice BFG. Talk about something different and very good! Its not overly strong (maybe they could offer a dollop of wasabi so you can change the strength? I like wasabi A LOT), its a wonderful change to a world of ketchup/ranch.

Sweet Chili is another welcome change. if you like a little heat, mixed with a little sweet, this is for you!

The only dip I didn't love is the Ranch, but that's another personal thing. I love buttermilk Hidden Valley Ranch (hey! i'm a southern girl) and no other. and this isn't that. but with the other dips, I don't mind!

They made me a taste-test of fried mac & cheese balls, if they put that on the menu, get it! it was good (panko breaded too).

All of the meals come with good garlic bread, great friendly service, and its made when you order it. So be prepared to wait about 5 minutes (worth it).

I would think this would be great family stop on a weeknight or a weekend, or good take out (I'm going to try takeout sometime to see how it holds up). The place is small, like probably seats 15 people, but its definitely a place to try. Several times.",dReFOT8jzpxHibXP0cKKKw,2,2,4,oAOYI4_9E52CaIg-mNxTkg

""This place would've been 5 stars if they hadn't painted over the mural""...seriously? Did that mural make your food taste better?

I was impressed by the super friendly service. I was surprised a chicken place had Thai tea so of course, I got that since I love Thai tea and it was pretty good.

Chicken:
You choose from baked (with rotisserie seasoning), fried (breaded in panko) or grilled (marinated in Asian honey glaze). I got the panko-breaded fried chicken strips. It was light and not greasy. The chicken was cooked perfectly but still juicy. 4/5

Side Dishes:
They have baked mac n cheese, French fries and grilled veggies.  I went with the mac n cheese and fries. The mac n cheese was delish with the melted mozzarella on top. The fries are crispy but you have to dip them in sauce to make them tasty - eating them sans sauce is pretty blah. 4/5

Sauces:
Your options are BBQ, buffalo, cheese, wasabi cream, honey mustard, ranch, sweet chili, strip sauce and teriyaki. I tried the wasabi cream, strip sauce and ranch. Ranch was a stupid choice since you can get ranch anywhere but that was my back-up plan in case I didn't like the other sauces. It was ranch. The strip sauce was similar to Cane's dipping sauce so I liked it. I didn't like the wasabi cream. You can taste wasabi the first few seconds and then sweetness takes over. I'm not going to get that again. I have about 4 sauces that I'm willing to try next time I go. But for having lots of options for sauces... 4/5",tH0uKD-vNwMoEc3Xk3Cbdg,6,4,4,G4uD6P9hBeklT8XK6l16FA

The customer service is what it should be anywhere you go. The food is great and the price is right, but I keep coming back because the owner makes it a point to know your name and if you're a first-timer, he'll ask if you'd like to have your picture taken and posted on social media, usually FB. The owner is a local kid in his mid-twenties and a graduate of UNLV who seems to have a passion for quality and not quantity. 

He seems to be on point with staff selection because his staff is a reflection of him. They recenly expanded their menu to include deserts and other items. They have a very wide variety of soft drinks and healthy drinks. They have a reward program that they recently kicked off but I haven't had it long enough to give a review on it. 

The establishment is always clean including the bathroom and the decor is appropriate. This is place you have to try at least once. The only reason I'm giving it 4 out of 5 (I'd give it 4.5 if it was possible) is because of the fact that the place is small. The bathroom is basically right in the middle of the place right off the dining area, which is probably why they maintain it so clean.

Definitely worth a try --- it was pretty awesome!",sAEUJb9C6_ekgc8BIScZ5w,0,0,4,05W_ZqoWpadJZC6Vky-XXA

Stopped here after school one night based on Yelp reviews and this place did not disappoint.  Ordered the 4 piece meal with garlic bread and baked mac n cheese.  Everything was delicious.  You get a lot for the price.  Baked mac n cheese is smothered in cheese with a little extra cheese added to it's cheese.  Garlic toast was fairly small but who cares when you have the mac n cheese and chicken strips.  Employees were very friendly and service was fast.  What more could you ask for?

5390404,2014-01-07,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"I first visited this restaurant back in 2011 (as BFG) when Yelpers all over Vegas were fawning over it.   Not only was the food raved about but everyone seemed amazed at how well the owner at the time could remember names to faces and naturally I wanted to test it out.   True story: the 2nd time I went back he had no idea who I was.   Nice parlor trick!   The fact that it's extremely close to my work didn't hurt either.   As of a few weeks ago I visited it again for the 4th time (the 2nd time under the new monikor).   I feel like that fact pretty much exemplifies how I feel about about it.   If I hated it, I probably would have never returned.   If I loved it, I'd probably have been 15-20 times at least.   Yelp math!   In those 4 visits I have tried all 3 variations of their signature chicken strips, and the grilled veggies, mac and cheese, and fries for sides.   

Grilled:  This is what I was most excited about.   Every so and so months I decide that I need to stop gorging myself on red meat and carbs as I usually do, so reading about tasty grilled chicken strips accompanied by grilled veggies made my deep deep inner skinny person rejoice.   Unfortunately I was pretty underwhelmed both times I tried them.   The chicken and the veggies both just tasted very bland to me.   Maybe every delicious fried chicken finger I've had from Raising Cane's and other establishments has tainted my taste buds.

Baked:  Tried this for the first time a few weeks back.   Better than the grilled for sure due to the seasoning, but not anything that has me craving a return visit.  With this order I had the fries, which I did enjoy quite a bit.   But I mean, they're FRIES.   Hot, crispy and well seasoned though.   

Fried:  The best of the three, but to reiterate the point: it's fried chicken, of course it's good.  The panko breading definitely make it unique to most other versions you can find elsewhere, but not necessarily better tastewise.   And to make an unhealthy choice worse I got the mac and cheese with it the one time I tried it.   A good version for sure, but it didn't exactly set itself apart from most other mac and cheeses that I've had.

The stars of the show here are the dipping sauces.   The wide variety of them provide for a lot of different tasting experiences and most of the ones I tried were extremely tasty.   My favorites are the sweet chili and wasabi cream, and in particular I liked combining those two for a sweet/spicy combo.   You can be like Bill Nye the Science Guy and experiment on your own combinations.  Bring the kids, they'll have a blast.

So overall it's good food, and the price isn't too bad, but it doesn't exactly light my world on fire either.   See you in 8 months or so Strip N Dip!",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,6,2,3,qVGrhPTOy-ExUZud1dbeZg

The breading is a very light panko mixture and it makes for some juicy chicken fingers. The sauces I'm still trying out, but the standouts are the BFG sauce, the teriyaki and the honey mustard. The accompanying garlic bread is consistently fresh. The mac and cheese comes out hot and gooey and tasting like homemade. It's a generous portion although it's so good I rarely leave any leftovers.

We went in for a quick dinner after work. The place wasn't super busy. There was only 1 family waiting for food when we arrived. My boyfriend and I both ordered 4 piece strip meals (grilled) with grilled veggies and 2 drinks. Our order was placed at 6:05pm. By 6:30pm, the other family (who had ordered before us) finally got their meal. At 6:40pm, we were given our food in to go containers even though we had ordered to eat at the restaurant. 
35 minutes for chicken strips and veggies! When we got our food it was cold and a weird combination of rubbery and hard. The chicken had been put on the grill when we arrived and stayed in some sort of ""holding"" area for over 30 minutes!
To say customer service is lacking at Strip N Dip is an understatement. There was a younger man and woman working the back area. Working is a stretch...they were playing around and not really doing much of anything other than bossing around the girl working the register. The girl behind the register was the only reason I'm even giving 1 star. She was sweet and trying to be helpful (and it was only her first day on the job).
When my boyfriend and I finally got our food (we had just about given up and were about to ask for a refund since it had been SO long), we were disgusted by the fact that our food was barely edible. Almost $20 for rubbery, burnt, gross chicken bits (no where near big enough to be considered strips by any stretch). We didn't even look at the rest of our food and asked for a full refund. The young woman who had been working in the back was on the phone by the register and the young man was just kind of hovering around, not doing anything helpful. The poor girl on her first day asked us what was wrong after we had stood at the counter, right in front of the woman on the phone, for at least a minute. We told her and she asked how to do a refund. The woman on the phone finally hung up and asked her what happened. She NEVER acknowledged my boyfriend or me and the young man simply acted like we weren't even there. 
We have told so many of our friends in the past how great this place was, and now we're telling EVERYONE we know to stay away. Service is non-existent as is quality and consistency.
What a joke! Never again will we return to Strip N Dip, which is a shame. Another good place in Vegas destroyed.

5534000,2018-06-12,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"This was one of my favorite spots in town, slightly overpriced, but worth it as a treat. They moved inside of the Inn Zone on Rainbow and Westcliff and that alone I was not impressed with. I don't want to have to go into a bar to get my food. But I had ordered online before I realized they had moved and I ordered a lot so I committed. 

Family meal with grilled, baked, and fried strips. The only ones I had a problem with were the grilled, they were over cooked. I could tell they would have been great had they been cooked properly, really nicely flavored etc. But I couldn't believe how charred they were, I wouldn't have served those, especially since it was an online order, so they had time to correct that. 

I got fries, mac n cheese, and veggies. They changed the fries from thin fries to thicker steak fries, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Very tasty. Mac n cheese was ok. It always tastes a little empty to me so I add the cheese dipping sauce to make it a bit more robust. 

Ordered a funnel cake with whip cream and both chocolate and strawberry sauce. When I got there they still had to make the funnel cake so I was waiting 10 minutes. There was no whip cream. I didn't eat it but my partner and kid enjoyed it. 

Now the saddest thing about my visit...I have to SND JUST for the thai tea several times and this is the worst thai tea I've ever had, let alone that they've ever made. The color was a really pale orange, like it was more cream than tea, and there were a lot of tea leaves floating in it, leaving me to think that they stretched what little they had left in the pitcher to try and make 2 drinks. I was really disappointed, they were not drinkable at all. 

Overall, I'm not likely to visit as often as I did before with the location change, the cooking quality, and the thai tea all being a down grade. Nothing against the bar, it's a really decent bar with a cool layout, but if I wanted to eat in a bar, I'd have gone to a bar. I use to bring my kid and nephews to SND, and I'd have regular dates with my GF's and mom there and now that is very unlikely to happen in the future. May to go order again sometime because it was so good before and they may just be having growing pains...I also don't think I got any point for my visit because I ordered online and I don't think they entered my PTN and I spent nearly $50, disappointed in that too.",S_7OkmN0BicgWEt2oMmzIQ,1,1,3,1NKgc2t11aF6_xKNEco4UA

The fried chicken strips are like katsu chicken, breaded with panko.  While expertly cooked and juicy, I will admit I am still more of a fan of Chick and Benny's ""barely there"" breading on their chicken strips.  The breading on these are a little too thick for me.  I do find these on the same level as Raising Cane's.  But what BFG does better than the other chicken strip establishments in Vegas are the dipping sauces, which are pretty spectacular.  The hype on the wasabi cream sauce is completely true - it really is that good.

They also do a really good veggie skewer - and veggies usually aren't cooked this well.

But the chicken nachos, while tasty, was so rich and greasy from the cheese that I got a really horrible tummy ache the rest of the day.  Really wish they would put actual real cheese on these.

Their chicken strips looked and tasted panko-encrusted (japanese bread crumbs)...and that- folks, is what sets them apart from the rest.  Sounds basic enough, but its genius in the most simplistic form.  The chicken is moist, the breading is crisp, the dips are fantasmo. (you get your choice of 2)  Their mac n cheese is a mentionable, especially if you like yours baked.  Be careful though, it's extremely hot when it comes out.

They also serve weekly specials, and my friend ordered the bibimbap.  A Korean dish made up of chicken, vegetables, rice, eggs, and a chili sauce.  Each ingredient in bibimbap is separated and pretty at first glance, but you'll have to mix it up and ruin the picture in order to eat it correctly.  Their bibimbap is pretty decent.  

The service?  Awesome.  Jin was taking orders at the cashier, and upon encounter, we were fast friends.  By the time he came around to each table to check on the customers (provided they weren't too busy) we were BFF's.  He'll make you feel special.  He'll give you stickers.  He'll dance for you.  (ok so he didn't dance but I bet he would if you asked).

So now when my friend asks me if I wanna go to ""The Strip"" I'll be thinkin BFG.  And Jin.  And Tin.  And Sister Tin.  And 2 other Sister Tin's who slave in the back preppin stuff.

5574062,2014-05-08,0,wX1ORSDKPkA5ftE7F6UONw,"I have found my chicken strip spot next to the vicinity in which I call work. The name of the game here is OPTIONS, ALL OF THE OPTIONS. It merits caps, really, it does. It also has an awesome name. Come on, admit it, it does. 

Food: They have 3 meal deals. They are the following: A 6 strip combo, which comes with 6 chicken strips, 1 side, 3 sauces, a garlic bread, and a drink (20 oz).  3 Strip Combo comes with 3 strips, 2 sauces, a garlic bread, and drink. (That's the one I usually get, as it's just the right amount of food and it's ohhh so good.) Lastly, the 2 strip meal which has 2 strips, 1 side, 1 sauce, and a kids sized drink (12 oz). 
- Here is the fun part. THE OPTIONS, YAY! You can get your chicken either baked, grilled, or fried. I'm a fan of their grilled chicken, since deep fried food doesn't like me. Their baked chicken is decent, but in my option grilled is the way to go. They have a good variety of sauces too, and oh man, if you like sauces, you'll like this place. What kind of sauces do they have, you ask? Well kids, here's a list: BBQ, Buffalo (one I always get), Strip Sauce, Cheese, Honey Mustard, Ranch, Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, and Wasabi Cream. I've tasted the Buffalo, Ranch, Strip Sauce, Cheese, and Teriyaki and I'm a fan. The teriyaki was a little weird and not one of my favorites, but it wasn't by any means horrible.  Oh yeah, you also get that side! Their sides are mac and cheese, french fries, or grilled veggies. Their mac and cheese is decent for fast food, and their french fries are pretty good as well. None of them are something to write home to mother about, but hey, you are coming here for the chicken anyway, right? I hope so. 
- Service: So far so good! The people working there are friendly, tell you about their loyalty program and like to make you smile. It can get busy during lunch so there is a little bit of wait time, but nothing compared to some places. 

I say try it once, at least for the sauces and chicken. Everything I've tasted there has been om nom nomable to the extreme and it has now became my go to place for chicken at work. :D Keep it classy Strip N Dip.",1hJVutieYDBwGx8INWv3IA,2,0,4,0Do0L5sjemJzOBqM9j6Psg

They also have baked and grilled chicken (the B and the G of BFG).  They also have several choices of sauce, honey mustard, ranch, BFG (their take on russian), BBQ, and several others.

Our favorite sauces were honey mustard and the spicy Asian sauce, combined with some good 'ole fashioned sriracha.

They are known for their fried chicken, but I wanted to be difficult and try all of their different types of chicken: fried, baked, and grilled. All were great but the fried was the best! It's may also be due to the fact that I wanted to be bad after doing a lap in the pool lol. They use tempura batter to fry the chicken. You get a nice crunch with every bite you take. You can see the grill marks on the grilled and it's good too. The baked chicken was juicy! So I love em all! The baked mac n cheese was really good too. The slightly burnt top layer of cheese and the ooey gooey inside made it great! 

There's also different sauces you can pick. My personal favorite is the wasabi, but I like wasabi too. It's not overpowering where your eyes would water, however, it's a pretty good kick! So be careful and try at your own risk. The house sauce was explained to me as thousand island but it kinda tastes like ketchup mixed with mayo we call that fry sauce in Utah!",KDuWv96lLrfkKQ-4KtaU8w,6,5,5,cBm2de-Hxv2NEr3NSuCO-A

I've been wanting to try this place for... a really long time, but alas, I live in Henderson so I wasn't about to make a trek out for some chicken strips. Luckily, it's close to Jen's place, as in, spitting distance, so we checked it out. Let's just say my expectations were through the roof. I found out the nachos weren't available for another two weeks because this week is the hot chick week. *tears!*

I got the #1:
Baked Chicken Strips: Just okay. Lacked flavor. 2/5
Mac & Cheese: Pretty tasty. I liked the melted cheese on top. 3/5
Garlic Bread: You can't mess up garlic bread. 5/5
Wasabi Cream Sauce: Flavorful, yet not overpowering. 3/5
Sweet Chili Sauce: Definitely the best - not Mae Ploy sauce, pleasant sweet taste with a hint of onion flavor. 5/5
Soda water: Heck yeah, I love it when that's offered. 5/5

Jen got the ?:
Fried Chicken Strips: I only tried a bite. I'd say they're 3.5/5
French fries: 4/5
Buffalo Sauce: Tastes exactly like Louisiana Hot Sauce + Butter that's been mixed together and cooled so it's creamy. My family makes this all the time so it's nothing that knocked my socks off because I'm so familiar with it. 3/5.
Honey Mustard Sauce: Decent. 3/5
Mix of different drinks: I'm not going to try that. Ew!

Jin was pretty pimp. He was cool and talked to us a bunch while we ate and was a good sport for taking Jen's ""attitude"" humor. (She's from Jersey, need I explain more?)

My only thing is that I think they should give up the sauce more. That is a pet peeve of mine when a joint charges for or limits ""extra"" sauce. I mean they are called strip n dip chicken right?

Weather you order it baked, grilled or fried, it will be served hot, cooked and still moist inside. And Jin is seriously a master at friendly and personable customer service.

It is not rocket science, but when restaurants can deliver the winning combination of serving good food + exceptional customer service, it pretty much means the customer will have an awesome experience.  And for someone that dines out daily it really is a refreshing change to dine somewhere that do all the important things right. 

I tried Combo #1 (maybe not the ""healthy"" combo, but it certainly does pack a lot of tasty flavor).  The fried chicken strips were very good (my second favorite).  I also ordered 2 strips each of the baked and grilled chicken strips, just so I  can do a little taste test and find out my preferences.  I really love the grilled chicken, it has nice flavor and was nice and juicy.  The baked chicken was good, but came in last for me when compared to its grilled and fried brethren.

About the restaurant, it is small but still perfect for accommodating patrons dropping by for a quick meal break from work or school or the modern day hunter gathers here to pick up a little something for the rest of the family units impatiently waiting at home.  It has WiFi, in case you want to surf the web/blog about your visit on your new iPad 2 while you get some nourishment.  It is located in a large strip mall, so parking should not be an issue.

Tinh and Jin's Mom + staff, runs the kitchen, while Jin mans the cash register and handles customer service, 12 hr/day, 6-days a week. Pretty tough schedule running a small restaurant, but they do a great job!

Food: 5/5 They have the techniques down when it comes to making chicken strips.
Service: 5/5  There are more than one way to provide awesome service, and BFG has certainly mastered it.  I think even more established restaurants or potential restaurateurs can learn a thing or two about what great customer service is here.
Location:  Close to the Rainbow exit on the 95.

The premise is pretty simple. They sell chicken strips. You can get em baked, fried, or grilled. Hence the name. 
The chicken, is finger licking good. They have a wide array of sauces but the most unique one is wasabi cream. I love that and the sweet chili, but they have about 8, so you might like something different. 
The sides are where they really make their name.  The baked Mac and cheese is extremely creamy and a must try. They have chicken nachos, but I prefer to have them as chicken fries instead and mind= blown.

The punch card is awesome, giving me eating goals is always a good idea. BFG, I will be back! (once my stomach can hold down food)",cuCf5ydDSmXAgAeCf8ELtA,0,0,5,ZSyvxWuiovQES1fFVSu7pA

In general, baked chicken worries me because I never know if I'm going to get a a dry piece of chicken.  However, the baked chicken strips here were moist and well seasoned.  They were so good that I almost ate all my strips without the sauce.  And then I threw in some wasabi cream sauce  that everyone keeps talking about.  It starts off so sweet... and ends with a kick to the nose!  Wow, what a great combination.  I think I'm in love.

And finally... the mac n cheese.  I've never had anything so cheesy, gooey, and oh so delicious.  

You can't beat the good and the price of this place.  I will definately be coming back for more.",YG54z87sI6jQTjaqW14Emw,1,0,5,eOu3tYbtjSiyYNPUOs337Q

The strips were very good, better than one of the more famous places.   The sauce... not so much.   I did like that they give vegies as an option and baked, grilled or deep fried strips.   My one observation was the place needs a facelift or deep cleaning.  Other than that, the staff is overly friendly and the service was great",oUCaxUBcruhxU4XhCF523w,0,0,5,wW__v7ypJ02G9yJERgukBQ

I came with my mom for a late lunch after a full day of shopping. We shared the grilled chicken strips with veggie skewers and the fried chicken strips with the baked mac n cheese. Everything was out of this world delicious and the service was so incredibly friendly and welcoming. I'm a big fan of the fried strips, but I think I almost liked the grilled ones a little better. The mac n cheese was phenomenal and super duper cheesy. Just how I like it. They have an incredible sauces too! My favorite was the wasabi cream. So perfect!

The food was incredible, so was the service and on top of all that the prices were beyond reasonable for the quality and quantity that you get. Winner winner, chicken dinner! I'll be back... and soon!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,8,6,5,RTkpEDOvRmT4aA51u5rbDQ

They are very small. So if you're debating between how many to order, order more !",ZApCAOHduXde1ZFiY1QT3g,0,0,4,QF9xLNPH_ryVJ5NBaP6SVQ

I have had BFG on my list of ""must try"" for awhile and we finally ventured in last week.  We ordered take-out and ordered the BFG trifecta. 1 Baked meal, 1 Fried meal, and 1 Grilled meal, and selected 6 different sauces to accompany them.  

We live less than 10 minutes away and the meal was still fresh and piping hot by the time we laid it out on our dining table.  Everything tasted pretty good, but didn't wow my taste buds like I had expected.  My husband preferred the fried chicken and baked mac n cheese, while I preferred the the grilled chicken and grilled veggies.  The extra .5 is because the service was awesome, and it truly is an amazing value- and because of that, I will be back.  Besides, I still need to try their specials!",sEpOSEvfLgatlavQKYE7GA,2,0,3,Xe-RJdARw5sLW55-oLI4ug
