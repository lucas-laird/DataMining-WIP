Long: Went here for lunch. Ordered three beef tacos. They're the typical three inch tacos with meat, salsa and sauce on top--at $1.25 each, it's quite the average deal.

1588359,2014-08-11,9,CVECSCW-7zDzjpIPxsew4g,"Religious murals, a candle-laden Catholic altar and arcade games coexisting in the dining room, and tacos. This place is... well, all over the place.

THE GOOD NEWS: they're no longer cash only and accept credit with a 50-cent processing fee. There's also an ATM in the dining room. There's a panaderia next door and a paleteria further down the strip center to continue your Mexicano dining adventure!

THE NOT-SO-GOOD NEWS: Apparently prices have gone up from most of the ones posted on these reviews. Tacos are $1.25-$1.50 each, my two-taco take-out order was basically $3. But when I opened the bag at home, there was a foil packet roughly the size of a slice of cheese. I wondered how they could have given me the wrong order, given that I was one of only two orders at the time.

THE REALITY: My two tacos were both mini-tacos, and the condiment container of grilled onions I'd grabbed at the salsa bar seemed to dwarf the actual tacos. I know street tacos are on corn tortillas and run a smidge smaller at traditional places than, say, Taco Bell or Del Taco, but these were absurdly small.
Similarly-priced tacos at Tacos Gil or the guys on Decatur are all easily twice the size of what I received here. Key words: similarly-priced. 

That being said, the lengua taco is fairly good and I liked the mild salsa verde, but the asada was lacking and overpowered by the ranchero-style sauce included when you ask for ""everything on it"". 

THE VERDICT: Disappointing. For tacos, anyway. Maybe I'll go Jade's route and try the soup next time.

Side note: also watch out for the guy in the parking lot with a bottle of Windex. He'll spray down your vehicle while you're inside, unprompted, then expect payment afterward.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,8,7,2,y7_xxl66m-ro4H4wtVA5JA
1592605,2010-12-21,0,CVECSCW-7zDzjpIPxsew4g,"I visted Tacos El Compita #2 afew months back and today I came in to check out their #1 shop. I must say I would prefer their #1(this shop) because it's more spacious. The other place was tiny and cramped. Just to add, both places had great service-- the workers were nice and friendly.

Despite my preference for spaciousness, the tacos at both places were crazy-good! Each taco was $1.05 and I ordered 4-- tongue (lengua), pulled pork (carnita), steak (carne asade), and marinated pork (pastor). All you need is to Squirt some lime for a hint of sourness and drizzle some extra smoked chipotle sauce on the tacos and it will be complete. All the tacos came out hot with generous amount of meat (see pics). The tongue was super soft, like butter in your mouth. The pulled pork and steak was my two least favorite-- not because it wasn't good, but bc if I had to chose and recommend, it will be the tongue and marinated pork. The marinated pork was super tender and tasty that if you look closely at the pork, you can actually see speck of spices!

Yummy in my tummy! Come here and get their lengua and pastor tacos at $1.05 each. Totally worth it!!!!",QEQYldM0S2uvjhbjJAuH3w,1,2,5,9B0ytNkFZF3VCz8JeX82rA

We had planned on only getting tacos but after looking at the menu and smelling the goodness coming from the kitchen, we decided to also order a combo burrito and pork with verde sauce.

From the outside, it doesn't look like much. It's right behind a car shop amongst other businesses that seemed out of place. Going in, it doesn't look like much either. The walls are adorned with figures and paintings of Catholicism and Mexican culture. The furniture, the walls, and the floor shows signs of aging. Overall, the place doesn't look like much.

The food shines through all of this. It is amazing. I've always been a huge taco fan and this is my go to taco spot. In my opinion, Tacos el Compita is better than Tacos el Gordo any day. There is usually no line to order, minimal wait time, and the price is such a bargain! They have a five taco plate for less than $8! My go to tacos are the lengua and tripa. The carnitas are pretty damn good too.

FINALLY!!!!   I've found real Mexican food in Las Vegas!  I've been searching for over 4 years.  It's been an emotional roller coaster of getting my hopes up only to be disappointed time and time again.  Growing up in Southern California I guess I have high standards.  But no more let downs, my search is ended.

This place is no joke.  It's as good if not better than many of the taco trucks I've eaten at in L.A.

They serve the best, most perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned tripas.  

The buche was awesome - tender and juicy.  

Carnitas - not tex mex crap - this is the real deal.  Like southern pulled pork.

Cabeza was great, the carne asada solid, the al pastor was up there.

I've had better tortillas but I'm not complaining - these worked.

The food was so delicioso it actually brought a little tear to my eye.  

And talk about cheap eats.  Tacos are like a buck each.  Be sure not to order more than 2 or 3 tacos per person at a time - they're best served hot off the grill.  You can always go back to the counter and order again, and again, and again....

And be sure to throw a five spot in their tip jar, they deserve it.

3229643,2018-04-22,0,CVECSCW-7zDzjpIPxsew4g,"The asada tacos here are BOMB.  Nice little hole in the wall right by a self-serve car wash.  Tacos are $1.60 +tax, and there's a $0.50 charge if you use a credit/debit card.  The tortilla here tastes so good, it's not oily.  The asada was chopped into very small pieces and was very tasty.  My girlfriend and I ordered them with ""everything"" on it which includes hot sauce and some onions.

They have onions, sauce, radishes, lemon/lime, peppers and seasoned onions available at the self-serve condiments bar.  Let me tell you, the seasoned onions are so good, but be prepared for a full day of onion breath (worth)!  Bags are available for you to take them to go as well.

3514836,2010-06-05,1,CVECSCW-7zDzjpIPxsew4g,"With all the recent Yelp talk about a taco crawl, I was craving tacos more than usual. So I decided to hit up El Compita during my lunch break. I didn't have a lot of time so I had to grab and go. It was crowded during lunch and I was the only non-latino/hispanic person in there. That's always a good sign that the place is ""authentic"" and good. I was too intimidated to order in my broken Spanish, so I just ordered in English and the guy behind the counter smiled. It was probably the only English he heard all morning.

I got an order of 4 tacos (2 carnitas, 1 asada, 1 pastor). Each taco was $1.05. Despite the crowd my order was up in about 10 minutes and the guy behind the counter was nice enough to tell me in English that my order was ready. Everything was good, but I still have to rank Los Parados and La Mexicana ahead of this place. The carnitas here are good, but the asada just doesn't come close to what you can get at the other two places. The pastor was decent, but my least favorite of what I tried. It just wasn't as tender as other places. But, it did have a lot of heat -- at least for me. I can't handle really spicy foods, so while it was spicy to me it's probably mild to most people. Ten minutes after I was done eating I could still feel the heat on my tongue. I had to wash it down with a few glasses of water.

There was a guy selling CD's and movies from one of the tables. He had a huge box full. It may have been the same guy that Lisa mentioned in her review, but the guy was quiet and low-key about pitching his stuff.

3837751,2016-02-23,3,CVECSCW-7zDzjpIPxsew4g,"The food is fantastic. But what ruined the experience for us was the amount of people  crammed inside, the number of running, screaming children, the uncomfortable religious portraits of a suffering Jesus, and the absolute dirtiness of the restaurant. 

The food was great, nonetheless. The menudo was menudo, which is usually decent, and the chicken mole was immensely flavorful. The mole was sweet, the chicken was moist, and the plate itself was literally overflowing with the amount that they generously lumped on. You could taste the chile clearly, as though it'd been slow cooked.

My fiancé ordered five asada tacos. The meat had a nice charred flavor and was the perfect texture. Unlike most places, it wasn't dry. 

Despite the wonderful food, which should have earned a five star, I'm afraid that the ambiance and the clientele just pulled this so far down. People kept staring at us...one man in particular. It was odd. There was so much yelling going on from both the customers and the kitchen that I could barely hear myself think. The floors were disgusting, to be blunt. The tables were not clean; I watched a bowl of old, half-finished menudo sit on a table the entire time were we there. There was no horchata (what I'd hoped for most) and there was no posole (also what I'd come for, but the menudo was alright). 

The Jesus portrait. I wish I could have sat across the room to avoid the somber, condemning stare. I don't mind religion, because that's an owner expressing themselves and their beliefs...but he was crying, bloody, mouth hanging open, and staring directly at us. Damn. Guadalupe's alter was fine. Like I said, I usually don't mind. 

The children's prize machines were just gross. I don't think they have been cleaned in years. And the children around them were pretty calm compared to the ones being forced to sit down and eat. This resulted in screaming. Wonderful. 

Service was alright. The woman at the front was pretty okay - nothing severely noticeable. But she was pretty busy, so I can't say anything negative. The total was a little much for what we ordered. Nowhere near as inexpensive as I'd assumed based upon other reviews. Taking a five minute drive over to Sweet Tomatoes or, hell, even Robert's would have cost less. The mole was definitely worth the cost, everything else was pretty ""meh"". 

If it'd been clean, I don't think the Jesus portrait, nor the costs, would have bothered us much. But honestly, and personally, cleanliness is almost as important as the food. Definitely would have rated it five stars for such awesome authentic cuisine.",2YOWAF4_uQZ3ToABzRh4hA,4,3,3,tDSM2Sf78SmOf4uEcHWGZw

What does perplex me is, with all the south-of-the-border folks here, legally and not, why the hell doesn't Vegas have some of THAT level of Mexican/Oaxacan/Salvadorean food options? I have to go to Santa Barbara for truly amazing gorditas. I have to go to San Jose for effin' phenomenal pastor ""devil"" tacos. That kind of food makes you want to drive three hours out of your way to enjoy. I'm left stunned with all the five star ratings with this joint. Have to assume our collective level for what makes real 5-star food has dipped. I it like an LA ""4"" is a Vegas ""10?""

Back to Compita and the plus-es of the experience... service was nice, prompt and pleasant. The place was as clean as possible. The salsa bar was arctic-ly cold so all the goods were nice and fresh. They kept a good eye on the salsa bar and kept it stocked and clean. The caldo is enough to feed 2-3 people. The cemita will kill any hunger within three bites - man that thing was crammed full of meat chunks. (Quantity is not a problem here). Also, parking is easy, and its next to a panderia if you have a sweet tooth.",7Pxx2FehELyKthPj0OY1sg,0,0,2,GNTL3FAcbPDmOYDphYheqQ

the meat. moist and fatty, but not too fatty. just the right amount of fatty

the tortilla. surprisingly subtle

the salsa bar. oh holy salsa bar. one of the best hot sauces ive had a chance to taste. giant jalapenos. radish, fresh onion, cilantro, lemon. and the pickled onion...i would make the 4 hour drive from so cal to lv just for those pickled onions, whose hotness factor can pwn even the most experienced of taste buds.

must return one day for their soups, which you will often see mexican locals slurping down just about every time you visit.

4571040,2010-04-25,3,CVECSCW-7zDzjpIPxsew4g,"My 100th review is a tribute to ""street food"" - Tacos El Compita is in a strip center, and was fast and authentic.  We were limited on cash (forgot it was cash only in other reviews), but scraped together enough for a 5-taco plate (I got the juicy tongue/lengua, and the boy had 2 beef, 1 carnitas and 1 pollo), a side of sliced avocado, and 1 Mexican coke (bf only drinks h2o).  The food was fast, the salsa bar very nice (radishes, whole raw jalepenos, pico, onions and cilantro, very spicy salsas - loved the green especially).  The tacos had onions and salsa on them, and my poor bf doesn't do spicy food too well, so he got the avocado to cool him down while I was dipping it in the green sauce!

This place is cheap and yummy, a solid bet.  I would definitely return when I have cash.  The salsa bar had cups with lids so if we hadn't been on our way to Popcorn Girl, I would've taken some green salsa home!  I ate only one taco due to our limited budget and the bf's big appetite, but next time I may try a torta (highly recommended by the lady in front of us).  The guy sitting right behind me was selling pirated CDs and peliculas :)  No one seemed to bite every time they walked in and he called CDs! Peliculas!  CDs! Peliculas!

The best part was watching my bf go to his car to get change and count out quarters and dimes to buy me the Mexican coke :)",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,5,4,3,JmwQ7NsYcchsipTb0SK3wA

I have tried their menudo there, and it is pretty decent, and by that, I mean it is greasy enough!  My favorite is the lengua (tongue).  I'll have it either in tacos or mulitas.  

Another thing to love about Tacos El Compita is that they are FAST.  We would order 15 tacos, and it would be ready in 5 minutes.  The kitchen is an open kitchen and it is right there, so you can see everything for cleaniness and what not.  

One downside is that it is a cash-only ""cafeteria"" so be prepared; otherwise, you'll be stuck with a $3 fee for using their ATM inside.

The Caldo was good. The meat was tender enough and the tortillas very hot. I just prefer the meat to be on the bone and it wasn't. The onions and accompaniments were just fine for us. 

The broth was very simple and delicious overall. 

I think that using plastic bowls, thin paper plates and plastic throw away spoons kind of affected  my thinking of this place and I don't feel the food was that fantastic to overcome this. It is hard to eat soup with chunks of meat and vegetables using a small plastic spoon.

5049609,2013-02-14,2,CVECSCW-7zDzjpIPxsew4g,"While I think the cabeza here is on point, this visit some of the meats were a bit fatty and gristly compared to my last review. It was more noticeable in my MILs pastor torta and she's more of a ""taster"" taking small bites so she had to pick at hers. 

I still thought the flavor was good on their meats, but just a noticeable difference in quality with the pastor mostly. The lengua, cabeza ones I ordered were fine. Everything came out piping hot and fresh though. I noticed a few reviews that's touted this fatty gristle from the past so perhaps it's inconsistent with trimming.  This is just my second time so not exactly sure if there are more good days than bad. Pick out the bites you don't like? 

I noticed a ton of people on this day were ordering various soups. Caldo de res seemed the most popular so I might come back for that. I saw on the menu menudo, caldo camerones and birria as well. I went on a weekend and most places serve that stuff on a weekend only so I am not sure if this is a all week item as I didnt really pay the most attention to the wall menu closely.

It may be tacos el Compita but it seems that the Hispanic community seems to go caldo route. I'll come back and follow what everyone else is ordering next time.",n86B7IkbU20AkxlFX_5aew,4,3,3,V9YDj3IdWxLKOZK_syE2ew

As I opened the door, I was greeted by 115dBs of Mexican tunes, brightly painted walls including a depiction of Jesus and the Virgin Mary, a man selling knockoff movies, a horchata machine and a cooler filled with paletas. I was transported south of the border. Directly behind the counter, you could spy their huge grill with flames shooting out from beneath simmering pots.""Nice,"" I thought. ""Bring on the tacos!""  

I ordered a taco plate with one pollo, 3 pastor and one carnitas and awaited a taco symphony. The tacos were definitely cheap, like $1.25/taco, and unfortunately, for me, the quality of the taco reflected the price tag. I found the meat to be of low quality, and the toppings to be meager. The flavor profiles were disappointing as well. I love a street taco that tastes as if it is straight off the grill; here, they tasted like they were just reheated. And, I left with the mediocre-quality belly ache. I decided the only remedy was a bike ride. 

As we were leaving, I noticed a lot of people who appeared to be regulars were ordering the soups, so perhaps that's the jam here, but the tacos disappointed me.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,17,10,2,qsNyFOm-ZGtT0ERlLsxZtQ
