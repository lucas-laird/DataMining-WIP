You can order take out off the menu for fresh cooked meals, or order off the buffet setup for a quick and easy bite. Prices are really reasonable and the woman who's always there when we visit has been nothing but a sweetheart to us. My boyfriend and I can get four meals worth of food for less than $20, which is less than we spend at most fast food joints (like the burger king in the same parking lot) and there's more veggies! The food isn't going to win any Michelin stars but this is American-Chinese comfort food at a hard to beat price AND the location is really convenient if you live in the area. Even if it hadn't won me over with the convenience and low-cost, the employees have been so kind and pleasant that I'd still give them 5 stars!",vpSruwUEfZw_TyaTDHEFDA,1,1,5,cqNU4wBO_vqSsMw0mYdgrA

3272859,2015-06-12,0,CTsLzuZ_AR841SiSacdEvg,"Finally!! Affordable, quick, tasty Chinese food by my work. I work by Cashman Field and occasionally need my fix of Chinese takeout. Their setup is basically like Panda Express. You start at one end and pick whatever dishes you want from the food trays. As far as quality I'd say on par with Panda Express or China go go. I got a 2 dish combo with half n half of fried rice and chow mein for $6.77. A similar order at PandaX would have been $8-$9. They throw in an egg roll with the combo to boot. I used to go to MB China pretty regularly until they were on Dirty Dining. For the record I think this place is better than MB. I checked Panda Bowl's rating on the health district's site and they had an A rating from Jan. so off I went. By all means this isn't fancy Chinese but for the market they're competing in I give them 5 stars. I'll definitely be a regular.",07T3KSHLXO-vUzVxXSXTBA,2,0,5,48naI1MdbwL2Hpc1yggFKg

The lady is very nice and gives me a free soda when I buy 2 plates to go.

4845887,2017-08-22,0,CTsLzuZ_AR841SiSacdEvg,"I really wanted to like this place because it looked good and they are so friendly. 

I don't like Chow Mein, so I can't rate that but others did like it.  

The General Tso's chicken was better than the Orange chicken that was mostly dark meat.  

The rice was decent neither good nor bad, just rice.  That goes for both white and fried. 

The sweet n sour sauce was good, I am pretty picky about it and theirs was good! 

Eggrolls were good, but I like them mushy and not crispy so everyone's opinion may be different on those. 

Great prices, great portions, great service.  2 free can cokes with our order. 

I would not eat there again, but my hubby would eat their Chow Mein again over and over.",SJuSiO27FTKi5qKrNDa8Lg,0,0,2,aAsc1155SOebsNN1mdaGnA

5939252,2014-02-28,20,CTsLzuZ_AR841SiSacdEvg,"If you have ever been to Pat's Chinese Food on MLK, you might have noticed that the vast majority of customers are African-American. This demographic has encouraged Pat to modify his recipe to better accommodate his customers. That's why he specializes in chicken wings and fried chicken dishes in general. Panda Bowl Chinese Restaurant is similar in that the owner has established his restaurant in a heavily Mexican-American district, right next door to a Cardenas and a Mexican post office. This has encouraged him to modify his recipes slightly to incorporate Mexican cuisine. That's why instead of Srirachi you get Tapatio. But, besides for that the food is excellent. This place is located next to the Family Court, and Child Haven. If you are an attorney, clerk, or mental health worker in the area who wants Chinese food during your lunch break, this is the best place to go. Also, no matter how many Asian people on yelp 1-star this place, it's gonna be around for a long time since it's heavily supported by the local Mexican community, and we all know that Mexicans don't use yelp.
