336464,2012-12-10,0,YeYtDdGRonHddnviDc1q7g,"I thought the concept of this place was good, although basically the same thing as the Flame Broiler restaurants. 

The problems began when we started ordering at the counter and the cashier wasn't very friendly at all. Not only was she grumpy and seemingly scowling, but she wasn't very helpful. 

My wife ordered the Mahi Wrap, but we were quickly informed they were out of Mahi, so we switched the order to a salmon wrap. I ordered the chicken noodle bowl. We ordered a kids chicken bowl with noodles for our daughters to share. We asked if they could have some vegetables with the kids bowl and she said no because it doesn't come with vegetables. She did not seem interested in offering any other solutions for this inquiry.

We waited about 10 minutes and the food came out. My wife was served a salmon rice bowl instead of the wrap. The cashier was so unfriendly-seeming that we opted to not say anything about the incorrect order.

The food was pretty ordinary. I did not feel this there was anything special about the food. Perhaps the cloud of the unhappy employee clouded our taste buds. Needless to say, we will not be returning to this restaurant and if we having a craving for this type of food, we'll simply go to one of the other similar restaurants in the area.",4CDQnnCtSxk-c8hDPZtOmA,2,0,2,aSOrKQOciOTKQXjRdTtHdw

I ate in this restaurant on 10/13/17 at 8:15 pm. I ordered the Chicken Yaki Soba Bowl, with dark meat. It tasted good and looked good good too. I drove home, and by 11 PM I was drifting into a weird state of mind; confusion, blurry vision, tingling in arms, head feeling hot, and a ringing in my ears. I tried to stand and almost fell over, being too dizzy to walk. I felt like I was drugged and couldn't control it. I started vomiting which went on for 2 hours and tossed up everything I had eaten at this restaurant. It was so bad, I thought I was going to die! I'm not exaggerating. It was so bad I didn't think I was going to make it! The only reason I did not call an ambulance, is because my wife was nearby and she recognize the same symptoms that she experienced, from food poisoning she got from a different restaurant.  I have never experienced a level of food poisoning to this degree as I did this night. After a few hours I woke up and the symptoms subsided, and I was fine. 

The cook was handling a lot of chicken and I could see him behind the counter cutting and cooking at a fast pace. He was preparing several different orders at once, and nothing looked unusual from my view. The girl however, who took my order and handled the money, had chew bitten dirty fingernails, dirty hands, and she didn't look to clean either. I was turned off from that and hoped she wasn't touching the food. 

I filed a formal complaint with the SNHD and I hope they investigate the food handling practices within this establishment. I will NEVER set foot in here again, and I hope no one else gets sick from eating here! I don't know if I got sick from the chicken, the teriyaki sauce, or from something else in the meal (noodles, vegetables, etc) but it definitely was from this restaurant.",uy7wNEpzE9tIJSZHeZEkNw,0,0,1,8QVlO78tbW7ebP4Mz_aSNw

Walking in I got a fast food meet Chinese restaurant vibe. It was very small with few seatings. There was only 2 workers one working the front and the other was the cook.
The menu was limited and when my friend and I were trying to ask about the menu the girl didn't seem to know herself what was in what or the kind of veggies in it. We told her it was our first time here and she didn't try to explain anything to us. 
My friend ended up getting a chicken teriyaki rice bowl with brown rice and I got the chicken teriyaki soba noodle bowl. We waited awhile for our food and when it came out it wasn't even hot. More warm closer to cool. My friend didn't get brown rice but didn't even want to ask them remake it since we waited awhile already. My noodle bowl was meh. I had to add more sauce and hot sauce for flavor and my chicken was very dry. The veggies were cut up too big and chunky filling more then half the bowl ( I love my veggies don't get me wrong) but with the noodles being at the bottom there was no room for me to stir or mix my food. We ended up throwing around 3/4 of our food.

I didn't walk into Teriyaki Boy with a lot of expectations for great cuisine.  Here's what I wanted: a nice, healthy, quick food option with Teriyaki flavor.  But the restaurant somehow managed to dash those expectations.  I'm just not enthusiastic about anything we ordered.

The crab Rangoon tasted like it had been thawed and served up (i.e. all flavor was lost long ago while the food waited in a freezer).  The eggs rolls were appropriately crisp, but tasteless.  We drowned them in sweet and sour sauce in order to produce a taste.  We finally found a little flavor in the Teriyaki chicken bowl -- and the Teriyaki flavor wasn't bad.  But the dish came with boatload of rice with a meager serving of vegetables and chicken.  Sigh.  When you find a dish with a little flavor in this place, they skimp on the flavor and cover it in unseasoned rice.

Basically, I walked in hoping for the McDonald's of Teriyaki cuisine.  Problem is, McDonald's actually works hard to make sure it's food is flavorful use a whole lot of chemicals to keep the flavoring even after the food is frozen.  So, skip Teriyaki Boy.  It's a step under McDonald's.",wOSHvuJEJflUEesNLno51A,3,1,1,aptMkSpBIA7y5Rn0T4G8nQ

Not that big of fan but look at it as more of an inexpensive meal. I normally go too Teriyaki Madness since its closer too my side of town. Always enjoy mixing the food palate up.

I ordred the large teriyaki chicken bowl. I enjoyed! I thought the chicken was grilled right on nice char grill marks on both sides and nice moist. I like the vegetables they served sliced carrots (unlike more mass market or dime dozen teriyaki chicken bowls either shredded or big chunks sometimes not even cooked but raw), zucchini (again usually broccoli find), and course traditional pieces of cabbage. The teriyaki sauce not fan of overkill. So for me liked fact they have enough covered the chicken and get into the vegetables. The white rice was cooked perfect.

I surprise that the menu was pretty diverse from the appetizers, the alternatives comes too brown rice, or subbing different things in it. They even offer Jay Cutler size bowl. If you don't know Jay Cutler he won the Mr Olympia before. So its big boy bowl one that if your hungry should think about ordering.

2741653,2013-09-07,2,YeYtDdGRonHddnviDc1q7g,"I have always been a big fan of all things teriyaki. Unfortunately, im not a fan of this place. Let me explain.

Any time I go to a teriyaki place, I always get the chicken n beef combo because come on, you get two kinds of meat and you cant really mess that up right? Here they kind of did ok. You have two choices of sizes. Regular and Large. The large is only 50 cents more so might as well right? 

So here's why im not too fond of this place. The chicken was dry. I had to douse it with teriyaki sauce and sriracha just to make it edible. I wanted brown rice instead of white. They charge you 40 cents for that while some other places don't. The large was not that much bigger. My total came out to 9 bucks and some change. That's without any drinks included. Easily would of been over 10 bucks if I did.

So I stand corrected. I never really had much of anything negative to mention. Until I ate here. The only saving grace that is preventing me from giving them 1 star is that the beef is actually good.  I have actually been here twice. Once with company that wanted to go here and this second time around because I thought the first time was a fluke. Unfortunately, this second visit verified what I thought all along.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,11,4,2,s770lgK3HTHe77AS3P76aA

As I think about working out I get hungry.  This is when I notice the Healthy grill.  Then I always say I'm going to check that place out someday and then forget that I need to work out.  

I was at work and couldn't decide on what I wanted to eat.  I really didn't want a boring sandwich or something fried that was going to put me down at my desk.  Just then I remembered about this place by the gym.  I read some of the Yelp reviews and then I was off to go get my bowl on.  When I arrived the restaurant wasn't packed, but there was a few people and no line.  

I really struggled to give this place 4 stars.  The reason was because the girl at the counter was really rude.  This was the first time I have ever been here and was asking some questions.  She seemed annoyed and just wanted to take my order.  I was upset because there wasn't anybody behind me.  After asking a few questions I finally gave up and realized she was visibly upset.  I though maybe I caught her on an off day or she just had a rush.  Oh well, there's really no excuse to be rude.  

In case you were wondering I was asking about the Jay Cutler bowl.  This bowl looked like a man's bowl of food.  It was huge!  I will have to order it someday.  

I ended up ordering the small bowl because I didn't want a big lunch.  It was priced pretty well.  and it had vegetables.  I am amazed that the other places charge you for vegetables.  Really?  Other than the girl be rude the overall experience was good for my stomach and wallet.  If you are in the area or at the gym go check it out.  I hope you get a friendlier girl or guy at the counter.

A quick little check of the Yelp found this little gem, and with a free order of pot stickers upon checking in; I could not make the walk from my car fast enough.

From the outside I thought the place was going to be bigger; as there is not much seating room and the tables are very close together.  I made my routine route around and through the bathroom before I order.  Place was super clean, very impressive.  

Made my way to the menu and everything was well priced for the portion size.  I went with the ""Jay Cutler Bowl"" with steak and my free order of pot stickers.  The lady running the front counter was a little lost when I tried to use my check in, but the manager quickly rectified this small lapse.  Nicely done sir.  

I took my seat and the atmosphere was nothing special, but nothing bad either. A few people walked in and left after eating their bowls, and mine was out in a reasonable amount of time.

Upon viewing my meal the bowl was a lot larger than I anticipated with loads of meat.  Very nice portions. The flavor was not bad but not amazing.  The soy sauce that came on the side increased it.  There is an option to have the sauce on top while prepared (Will defiantly try that next time).  

All in all this is a great place for a healthier side of quick dinning.  Nothing off the charts, but again they are doing nothing wrong.

We had some groupons laying around for this place but it's reasonably priced so you don't really need such a deal to eat here. Much like Teriyaki Madness, they tout their high protein, brown rice meals (with the options of a low carb version). Add to that their association with Jay Cutler and it's no surprise you'll find them located near gyms. It's a great post workout meal-- you can replenish carbs if you're a a body builder or go for a meat and veggie meal if you are watching your weight. I've tried the chicken yakisoba meal as well as the mongolian beef. If you compare them to a sit down restaurant, then obviously the food wouldn't be much to right home about. But for a fast food establishment, they churn out some decent quality eats. The portions here are generous and should be enough to fill the appetite of any serious lifter. The yakisoba noodles are not overly soggy and come with a fair amount of tasty vegetables. The chicken is adequately prepared. Throw some sriracha sauce in their and you've got all you need. The mongolian beef is a pleasant surprise but also benefits significantly from some added sriracha. THe meat is plentiful and not overly tough. The veggies are a satisfying combination of mushrooms, green onions and green peppers. No complaints about the brown rice. The citrus chicken is also a nice way to go if you're more into the sweet side of the story.

Spicy Korean BBQ- I chose steak, super chewy, good flavor, ordered extra sauce on side and didn't need it, was not spicy enough even though I ordered it with more spice 

Kung pao chicken bowl- super strong ginger flavor, just enough spice, good sauce to rice  ratio

They said the first time that they verified before the order left and blame it on Uber.

The second time they again didn't give me any assistance with delivering my food even though they admitted it was their fault. I suppose is slightly better than blaming it on Uber .

The meat is far improved from my initial visit many moons ago.  Instead of thin strips, I got small chunks.  Instead of brown, lifeless beef, I got a little char and a hint of pink.  The broccoli was cooked middle of the road - not too limp but with a little crunch to it.

I got a small amount of cabbage, some zucchini, 2 carrot slices and 1 piece of broccoli. I also was given a spice level option. I chose medium and let me tell you there was no hint of spice on that food. I had to get the bottle of sriracha out of the fridge and do it myself.

Service:  The service here is absolutely awful.  It really blows my mind how the cashier can stand there and treat me like a second class citizen and she gets paid for it.  I really hope the management sees this so something can be done about this.  ITS RUINING YOUR BUSINESS.  Green and protein is right there where the customers are treated well why would we want to go to you to be treated rudely?

Food: Being a broke college student, all i look for are cheap eats.  The $2.99 chicken bowl is the only reason why i come here.  The bowl is composed of dark chicken meat, white rice, broccoli and zucchini.  Vegetables and meat are fresh but that depends on when the meat is grilled and how recent the vegetables were cut.  I'd recommend adding sriracha to the bowl as well.

4767064,2012-02-26,1,YeYtDdGRonHddnviDc1q7g,"Before I came to Las Vegas I was worried about finding anything healthy to eat, that is, until I discovered this little gem. A Japanese food restaurant with a healthy spin on it?!  Vegas -really does- have it all! 

-- 

Sometimes, when you see the word ""healthy"" slapped on anything, it can mean dull/boring food with no flavor... but that's not the case when it comes to Teriyaki Boy: Healthy Grill. 

Not only does their food taste good, but it also LOOKS good too. They use fresh vegetables, grilled chicken, lean cuts of meat, with low-fat sauces, and they don't cover their food in tons of fatty oil or batter. And their food doesn't look boring -- the food presentation is quite nice. In fact, I was shocked at how great their Yakisoba Bowl tasted and looked.  (Not to mention the fact that their Yakisoba noodles are made out of wheat!)

I noticed that they also have gyouza on their menu, but I didn't try it.  The reason is because I know that gyouza tastes the best when its deep fried, and crunchy, but that's by no means healthy. So I was surprised to see it on the menu at all.  But in all honesty, to me their gyouza looked a bit soggy from the picture, so I didn't order it. Perhaps next time I will.

I thought the prices were reasonable and the service is friendly and fast. They even remember your name and bring the food out to your table.  How many other fast food restaurants do this?  Not many. And even fewer can claim that their food is healthy. So that says a lot.

The interior of the restaurant is small, but not cramped. I also like how they have pictures of all of their popular menu items up on the walls so you can see them. The restroom is SPOTLESSLY clean. I thought that I was in a fancy hotel restroom. I was honestly impressed.

Now, for all of you people who are saying that their food ""needs a little more flavor"" (you know who you are), you are wrong. Your taste-buds needs to learn to eat healthy food, and pass on going to McDonald's a little more often. After eating junk food for many years, you have to re-acquire a taste for healthy food. And this right here, is your opportunity. Bon appetit.

To sum things up, in my honest professional opinion, this place is awesome.  I love Teriyaki Boy Healthy Grill. And I would most certainly come back here if and when I pass through Las Vegas again.",R32C3HGRzwT1Y22B1bPF_A,1,3,5,8EezVWrkm-wm44wBmDPg4A

This location is located right by the LVAC so the parking lot is always full. Beware on where you park! Some spots due to traffic make it difficult to back out. 

We walked in and immediately noticed it was pretty packed. It's a small space to begin with. Since I knew exactly what to we wanted I placed my order. I got a bit of an attitude from the girl that rang us up. Like she was bothered that we were there. I just smiled and said ""thank you"" and grabbed our cups. Joel and I both ordered the chicken and steak Yaki Soba bowls. Normally I love their food! I've even recreated it at home, but today the noodles tasted burnt and I had pieces of the core of the cabbage that tasted off. ( The cabbage is normally my fav part of the dish.) It was very disappointing. Joel finished his food and by this time I was ready to go. I didn't want to waste my food and figured Joel might want it even if it had a burnt taste. On our way out I waited in line to ask for a lid for my bowl. There was only one person in front of me and the girl that was ringing her up looks at me and says""Can I help you with something?"" (In a very snotty tone.) I asked for a lid and was happy to get out of there. 


Needless to say I will not be returning to this location any time soon. The staff is rude and the food just isn't as good as it's been at their East side location. Too bad! They are in serious need of a staff switch up! Beware!",pUQdU4MlkB46jIdYs9oMUA,6,1,2,cBiLdhLcXF1Oa_Rm6Tx1YQ

The food is ok. They charge you extra for everything so the menu price isn't accurate. If you want white meat and brown rice it's extra. The total cost for a chicken bowl is around $10. My biggest issue with this place is that like some other reviewers, on more than one occasion I have received chicken that seemed under cooked or at least very borderline!

I have had the yaki soba (sp) A type of noodle that tastes grilled ( its wonderful). I either get it all veggie or with chicken. These noodles are yummy.

I have also had the salad a few times. They put light noodles in there as well. The salad is really good and filling, you get a good amount, and it is fresh. I am a salad snob, so believe me when I say they have a decent one.  

I have had the boba smoothies many times. I have had the watermelon and the honeydew. Fantastic I have had them blended both times,  I suggest it this way.

They have a diy drink bar, and they also have fruity  green tea as an alternative. I love when places offer green tea!

And they also deliver through Uber so you can order from home. :) They also have delicious boba smoothies, protein shakes, wraps, and salads. Check them out!",YwbBk29LlXMukwLLGCKibg,0,0,5,O4qMWZEqJECnzgsVU0aRJQ

5877929,2016-11-28,0,YeYtDdGRonHddnviDc1q7g,"I had such high hopes based upon the reviews but.......customer service does not exist.  Stopped by after the gym to order some healthy food for the family.  Ordered 2 low carb chicken bowls with sauce on the side and the hubby ordered a steak bowl. 
Waited almost 30 minutes for our ToGo order but was entertained by the young girls at the counter giggling and playing around between orders.  There was no adult supervision in the house.
Got our order home and it was not right.  Both low carb bowls had salmon instead of chicken and no sauce on the side.....in fact, no sauce to be seen, including on my hubby's steak bowl.  If I wanted dry smelly fish on over cooked vegetables with no sauce, I would've cooked at home!
Sooooo.....I call the restaurant and ask to speak to a manager.  I was told by one of the giggly girls that the manager is not there and they can do nothing about our problem. She took my name and number and would have the manager call me.  After several days, called ""Dry Smelly Boy Healthy Grill"" back to find out why the manager had not called back. Was told that the manager was at a different location and she would remind her to call me.  
I waited 2 weeks hoping they would make it right but no go. So beware of this place.....I wasted $16 on food I had to throw away. Check your order before you leave!",1lK5wLkqXwui7GhhDAC6QA,2,0,1,d_koRklSVVkOmDiHF6Ov5A
5878427,2015-11-14,1,YeYtDdGRonHddnviDc1q7g,"If you're craving some teriyaki flavors, I do recommend this place.  There's nothing quick about it, as it seems to take a long time for them to prepare each dish.  I don't mind the wait as long as the food is good.  Plus, this is a cook to order place, nothing sitting under warmers.

You'll notice a lot of healthy freaks will come here and I think it's because they do offer some healthier options.  They have brown rice, good cuts of meats and decent pricing for their quality of food.  This is a big plus for them.  

I was given an entertainment book as a gift, so I downloaded my app and just showed them the deal for a $7 discount for 2 plates of food.  

I recommend the Jay Cutler bowl, with a good serving of green onions and super tender beef.  Another option is to get a chicken bowl and nix the sauce.  I always ask for light sauce, they inevitable ruin it for me, so now I just ask for no sauce.  They are definitely heavy handed on the teriyaki and hot sauces, so just add it on yourself.  

Oddly enough, they even offer boba drinks here.  I guess if you're not into protein shakes, you can always go for boba.

5959466,2012-02-09,1,YeYtDdGRonHddnviDc1q7g,"Driving around looking for a quick lunch on the cheap. 

I skim my Entertainment book and decide to get a bowl from Teriyaki Boy. There are quite a few bowl options and flavors. I noticed they even have tofu, which I might check out the next time I stop by. On this occasion I ordered the garlic chicken and broccoli over brown rice. The sauce was a little lacking, it definitely needed a little more flavor and the chicken was really dry. Not a fan of that, but overall the meal was ok.

I will try the place out again if I'm in the area and happen upon another coupon. The prices didn't seem too bad for the quantity you get, I'll just stay away from the chicken next time and take a few more sauces and condiments with me on the side if I take the food to go.",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,3,1,3,A2jwThyMAx6GaAM3lc1WdA

Some problems is that parking is a disaster. It's a little bit hard to park in this lot, but it's doable.

Know that the chicken teriyaki bowl comes with dark meat. If you prefer white meat, it is extra but not too much more. If you are not familiar with your sauce, I recommend that you place it on the side (they will give you a lot of sauce on the side). 

The service is always friendly and efficient whether you order by phone or in the store. When I order from here, it's usually takeout so that I am able to get in and out.

In general, it's fine, but there are better places to eat. However, if you're looking for a quick chicken and noodle or rice bowl, this is the place to go to!",lqrfzgZUKl0dXt6HAim2kQ,0,0,3,mEl1IVdsKDU3fwoZO_5cKA
