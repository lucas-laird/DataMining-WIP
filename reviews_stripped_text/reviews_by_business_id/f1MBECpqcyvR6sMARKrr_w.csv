1579556,2018-01-25,1,f1MBECpqcyvR6sMARKrr_w,"Great place for a group of friends celebrating a birthday!  

We started out with some appetizers which were great for sharing such as calamari, chicken meatballs, spicy edamame, and some crunchy spiced pork pieces.   All were delicious. 

The area we sat at consisted of 2 flat grills 2 cooks and so our table was divided in half.  Sam really added to the experience as he was very engaging with everyone with his great humor.  

Dinner included a salad with some ginger dressing, onion soup, and for the main course I had their NY steak, lobster, and sea scallops.  They were nicely seasoned and cooking temperature was on point. 

It was a great time gathering with friends, food was yummy and service was excellent!!!!",lT49-Xggq_VAB2E9dce0yA,3,3,4,zJlz53QatBj7V4Oxfz5P-A

1673217,2018-03-19,5,f1MBECpqcyvR6sMARKrr_w,"Hibachi is not one of those foods or meals I crave, it's always someone else's idea. Dinner and a show is a good go-to plan for special events like birthdays, which is how I made it into Ohjah's newest location. 

Order your meals based on your preferred protein, and then the soup, salad, rice, and veggies are included, along with dipping sauces. You can add on apps, sides, drinks, and more but the base meal is quite a bit of food on it's own. Dishes are coursed out and you get to enjoy watching the chef make your meal with fire, sound effects, and commentary. If you're especially lucky, you might get to catch a shrimp in your mouth as part of Sam's show. Start practicing now to avoid looking like an idiot.

My favorite protein here has been the scallops: they're HUGE, seared to perfection, and served juicy with garlic sauce. My meatatarian dining companion liked his NY Strip so much he barely gave me a bite, while the birthday girls loved their lobster tails. 

As is expected for this style of restaurant, your experience will vary based on which chef you are assigned to. I highly recommend Sam, who was engaging and friendly; another chef's actual cooking was a bit better (perfectly nailed med-rare!) but whose presence was less engaging.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,18,13,4,S5oq--95hFJBXQNxCSwmRg
1947826,2018-02-11,1,f1MBECpqcyvR6sMARKrr_w,"Amazing experience!!! 

Came here last night with all my lovely mom friends and we had a total blast. From the welcome greeting to the chef that cooked the food, we couldn't stop laughing and smiling!  

The appetizers were so good. Must try their edamame, calamari, and try their Tempura appetizer. Since our group was so big, we ordered a variety of food and I was able to try a little of everything.  Every person all gets a salad and soup. Salad had some time of ginger dressing and the soup had like an onion flavor!
I ordered the scallops but my friends next to me ordered rib eye and lobster. I tried all of them and they were sooo good!

Each person all gets to choose noodle or fried rice and again I was able to steal some noodle from my friends since I ordered fried rice! I was sooo stuffed!  I'm definitely coming back again with the family!!",r6bTtMJ26w3Vy46CxYJu0w,6,4,5,nlzjwdJ9U3mn5xfkfjj0dg

This place is amazing! Came in the night before Father's Day. Called in to make a reservation with pretty much short notice and they took care of us. Upon arriving we were seated right away. The waitress was so friendly and attentive. Normally I skip on the soup & salad appetizer at these places but it was so good at this location I just had to indulge. The hibachi grill master came out and worked his magic. He was nice and gave us all of our food just the way we wanted it. For dessert I definitely recommend the green tea cheesecake. It's absolutely amazing. The waitress even brought my daughter extra cherries because her cherry fell on the floor.

I took my family that is here from out of town and we all enjoyed our experience. We had the best waitress & Chef (Sam). I wish I got her name. They were both very entertaining and everyone at our table was enjoying their comic relief. They were feeding off each other's energy. Totally, made this experience stand out over any other Tempanyaki style restaurant. Food was great.

2383384,2018-05-19,0,f1MBECpqcyvR6sMARKrr_w,"TERRIBLE!!! WORST teppanyaki I've ever been to. Came here and was not greeted, didn't feel welcomed, no hospitality what so ever (unusual for a japanese restaurant). We were the only people in here besides another family so there's no reason for this. You could tell our waitress was an unhappy person. She didn't smile once and gave us the feeling that she hated her job. She didn't come to ask how our food was amd was hardly even around so I couldn't ask for more tea unless I stood up to look for her.  This is pathetic in my opinion esp when we're your ONLY table. This was our first and last time here. It's literally the worst food I've ever had and wouldn't even pay 10 bucks for the filet and fried rice i had. Filet was supposed to be cooked medium and it was actually burnt. The sauces tasted like complete crap so don't bother using it. The chef said weird things and was awkward and couldn't cook to save his life. I can make a better filet on the stove lol. Salad they give was nasty af. Idk what kind of cheap dressing they use but the lettuce was cheap af too. Felt like some chinatown sh!t. Not your traditional japanese salad. Also the appearance of this place is terrible. Plates and napkins out in the open all piled up on the side. Makes the place look like a mess/hole in the wall. I guess all the people who gave good reviews are not asian and don't know what real teppanyaki is supposed to taste like. The ones in Hawaii are a million times better, even with their worst chef.",Y9O0zHhZhWZFcwwo4E5QKQ,0,0,1,9wTLoFyMmyzanC9ppQYPxw

Started with a variety of appetizers: 
edamame -- so good and a must try. Prepared with a light soy sauce, red chili peppers, and roasted sesame seeds.   
Shrimp and vegetable tempura - delicious. 
Calamari - another favorite. 

Each of us got a salad with ginger dressing - which I love and can eat all the time. Along with a bowl of soup. The chef prepared mixed grilled veggies at the grill. And you got a starch too - fried rice and fried noodles were factories last night. You could also get plain rice or even brown rice. 

We each got different proteins - steak, shrimp, scallops, lobster, and sea bass. All delicious and well prepared. The chef was so entertaining and made the night even more fun.

My beau and I love Japanese style grilling, and we Come from Chicago where there is a lot of option in the Japanese category. Ohjah did a fantastic job impressing us with wonderful personality. The chef was a lot of fun talking to the table, tossing shrimp to us to catch in our mouths, lighting the fires, etc. But the Best was our waitress Yanny, who was super friendly and joking back and forth with us. She was an absolute joy!! She came by frequently and was personable and so much fun!

To mention- the food was fresh and great too. I really enjoyed the garlic sauce they put in the rice and veggies which was unique and delicious. Everything else was hot and fresh as you would like. 5 star hibachi and they hit it out of the park!",9yccZkhkCpIoZsX7sY5Fpg,5,3,5,oADMRi-X1PEXBojJxpitUw
