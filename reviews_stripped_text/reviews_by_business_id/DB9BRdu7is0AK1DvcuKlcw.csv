We usually get the bacon cheeseburger (I order the ""little"" since two patties on the ""regular"" would be too much for me).  I love the FREE toppings you get which include grilled mushrooms and onions.  I always  order mine with extra mushrooms as I am a mushroom feign.  They also pile on the bacon which is awesome since most places gimp you on that.  Their bacon cheese dog is also delicious.  I just wish they had sport peppers.  Oh well, you can't win them all.  

Their cajun fries are also a must!  I'm not a big french fry fan (especially the thick cut kind), but the fries here are to die for!  The cajun fries are extra addicting (which is probably why they have such generous portions).  

This place does not fail to disappoint and has grown to be our go-to place for burgers.",EfOhaQ-J5s9t2EmH0uBELw,0,0,5,UHyP7y4t-mZ6tmq_lFZpwA

They have a lot of options for the burgers which is nice when you get sick of the more standard choices of In-n-Out.  But it comes at a price higher than I like to pay when I go to a fast food burger joint. I got a bacon burger with no special ingredients with fries and a regular coke. The total was over 12 dollars   The regular fries are good, the Cajun fries were overly salty for my taste but I can see the appeal for some people. I really did like the burger but next time I go I will forgo the fries and get the Jr. version of the burger to save the money.",LS5bB39El2G35zEj1bcVyA,0,0,3,zZ7ZR7J3YJTGBB8g3I6kWQ

Ordered a hamburger, small fries, regular drink.  Total, with tax $12.52!

323501,2011-10-02,3,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"A lot of people had hyped this place up - so my sister and I took it for a spin. I was not wowed. It literally was just okay. 

My best description for it would be a cross between In-N-Out and Fatburger. Reasons why: Burger tastes like a fatburger patty. Large in size and similar consistency, except they don't have the topping I normally put on a fatburger (fried egg). Fries are an attempt at being similar to In-N-Out but fail. Tasted more like potato skin than potato and were overcooked.

On the plus side the place is bright, inviting, clean, and the workers are extremely helpful and polite.

I think this is just a matter of taste buds - you're either an In-N-Out fan or a Five Guys fan and I'm just an In-N-Out fan.",7qisKMCj9ONJF6gSEFHj3w,3,2,3,Q9YWKmDUtwNTOVUzOF_pJg
340477,2011-07-25,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"Most fast food places have introduced a pricier, fancier burger to their menu. McDonalds has the Angus Burger. Carl's Jr. has the Six Dollar Burger. They cost between $4 and $5 and include some fancy ingredients and maybe a bigger patty to help satisfy the more discriminating fast food connoisseur. But if you spend just $1 more at Five Guys, you'll get so much more burger. Much much more. The basic burger starts at $5.19, but you'll get two meat patties, along with your choice of condiments. You can also get grilled onions and mushrooms at no charge (hey, mushrooms aren't cheap). Definitely a huge step up from fast food, for just $1 more. You can probably find that underneath your seat cushions. If you wanted to keep your bill below $6, you probably won't be able to get their fries, but you can have a side of peanuts for free. Probably better for you, too. Taste-wise, the burger is most similar to Fuddrucker's, except $2-$4 cheaper.",_Ac7EfJcJoIFRJf6a9Tcag,2,0,4,4ML0L9TJLoi4Xs7Yp9PlWQ

Being our first time the cashier was helpful at explaining the menu. My husband decided he was in the mood for the double patty bacon cheese burger. I on the other hand chose the smaller cheese burger and added on the complimentary yummy mushrooms. We decided on a large order of Cajun Fries to share. My husband had yet to experience the fancy soda machine where he can create his own flavor beverage. I didn't believe he would be as impressed as I was the first time I tried, but he thought it was amazing and actually tried something new. I made cherry coke which was a-mazing!  The food was good. My husband commented that it was the best burger he had in quite some time, including in-and-out. The fries were tasting but the large was too large for the two of us. Perhaps snacking on the complimentary peanuts filled me up, but they were worth it.

The quality of their burgers is wonderful. I ordered a cheeseburger with mayo, mushrooms and onions. The bun is soft and sweet, the meat is flavorful, condiments were tasty. I used to love Fuddruckers burgers, but honestly this place takes the cake... er, the meat patty. The facility itself is clean and inviting. The staff was hospitable. No complaints here. The price may shun some people, but it's really not that expensive. You get what you pay for and even more in my opinion. You get a quality burger that tastes great. If you're looking for a cheap, previously frozen, premade burger type place, I can give you the directions to the nearest Mcdonalds and you can order a $1.00 Mcdouble.

I wasn't a huge fan of the fries but I'm a tad bias since I don't like spice. It seems like they toss the fries with a spicy seasoning so it's too much for me (I'm the girl who can't even eat a bag of Andy Capp's Spicy fries without chugging on some milk). If you like that cajun side of fries, then you will probably be a fan of these.

All in all, definitely a great place for burgers. You can customize your burger to your liking with whatever condiments they offer. Pretty good in my book.",53hTHxGUy7AC8Oz7BE7-3g,3,1,4,vc2qFcUwM_RVcFFghzUxLQ

To my surprise, the restaurant was slow, as every other time I've been in a Five Guys they are very busy!  This was great for us because we didn't have a lot of time.  We ordered and filled our cups with delicious sugary soda concoctions from one of those amazing soda machines that you can put almost any flavor in your cup!  . We received our food in about 5 minutes.  Then we realized we had ordered regular fries instead of Cajun. (Who does that?!). No problem the employees  gave us 2 condiment cups of Cajun spice and a bag to shake on our fries... Perfect!  Almost better when you shake it on yourself... Weird.  Anyway, the fries were delicious.  I bit into my burger and realized there was a mix up in our order I had pickles on my burger.... Not good . So I brought my receipt with toppings and burger to the counter.  The young woman was super nice and changed my burger right away.  And my boyfriend got to eat my 'mistake burger'.

797872,2013-10-21,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"We tried Five Guys for the first time this weekend.  The food is very good and you get big portions so you don't leave hungry.  However the burger where actually very greasy.  We did not realize that the regular burger are all double patties, for a normal size burger you get what they call a little burger.  I would not normally order a double bacon cheese burger, but I did not realize this fact until our food arrived.  There is no sign letting you know they are double patty burgers.  It's cool that they have a whole list of topping and you just choose whatever you want on the burger.  Every thing is made fresh and to order.  Word of caution to those who have peanut allergies, everything is cooked in peanut oil and they have boxes of peanuts lining the entry way.  The place is very clean and the people working seemed very nice.  

The reason I only gave it 3 stars instead of 4 stars is due to the high price.  I would say this is in no way a 5 star place.  This is basically a glorified fast food place.  You come in and stand in line to order get your number and drinks and wait for them to yell out your number.  Weather or not you are dining in you get your food in a paper bag.  However, you pay prices like going to Red Robin or some sit down place, and the quality is not that of a sit down place.  My suggestion is to go a block down to Trop. and have In-N-Out and pay a fraction of the price or go someplace where they don't yell out numbers for you to pick up your food.  For 3 people (2 adults and 1 child) we paid almost $40, at In-N-Out we usually pay about $20.  I don't mind these prices if I am not having to stand in line to order and getting my food in a paper bag and then sitting in hard metal and plastic chairs.  

So my advice save the money and go to another fast food place, or spend maybe $10 more and go someplace where you can sit and have your order taken and get the higher quality.",6BM8sUttDP3DY08BJ1hpHg,0,0,3,HFwD3lvc1B-N9MxeFt-WTA

Sure you can throw unlimited toppings on your burger, but once you get 2 or 3 on there all you are accomplishing is creating a burger that you can't fit in your mouth. The hero of a great burger is the meat, right? You start tossing around multiple toppings all willy-nilly you end up with a burger that might have had a nice juicy patty of wonderful beefy goodness in there somewhere, you just can't remeber anymore.

The large order of fries is definately large and enough to feed Kate, plus her eight, plus her douche-bag ex and still have some to take home. And while the cajun fries are tasty, they get a little old by the end of the bag.

I am sure this sounds like a negative review, I promise, it's not. Just honest. I will be back. It's a good burger. I will refrain from comparing it to In-N-Out; apples and oranges as far as I am concerned.

1228966,2012-04-15,1,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"About time I've tried this place.

So I walk in to the most unexpected sight. A crowded, noisy mess with giant bags of potatoes and boxes containing peanuts at the front door. I'm still confused over why there's so many peanuts, but moving on, I just get in line. 

The menu is fairly basic, which from my perspective is a good thing! Since I can be quite picky when it comes to burger toppings, it's very convenient for the burger to come plain and just let them know which toppings you would like afterward (at no extra charge). What can I say? I'm a mayonnaise hating machine who believes that putting cheeses like Swiss or Monterrey Jack on a burger is blasphemy, so it gets quite frustrating having to constantly explain that over and over again at other burger joints. 

I was a bit worried about the price. $12.08 for burgers, fries and a drink isn't expensive, but that's not exactly my idea of a deal either, not at a fast food restaurant at least. After finishing the meal however, I can say that it was totally worth it, even if it's something a poor college student can't eat on a regular basis. 

I ordered a regular cheeseburger with grilled onions, ketchup, mustard and lettuce. The thing was HUGE. I just loved how it was a double cheeseburger as well, even though the menu didn't say so. Hate to jump on the comparison bandwagon, but it really reminded me of In-N-Out, just much bigger, juicier, sesame seeds on the bun and no yummy special sauce. The part that most reminded me of In-N-Out was how when you get close to finishing the burger, the meat, cheese and toppings start to outweigh the bun. Still too soon to say which one I prefer though. 

The fries were also a surprise. I can be quite a weirdo when it comes to fries. As someone who can appreciate crispy fries and soggy fries, I was quite impressed with the balance of sogginess and crisp. They also overload you on them. They already come in a cup to begin with, and looking behind the counter, it appears the cup is just thrown in there which leads to the bag being overloaded with fries in addition to the cup. And this was the regular sized cup! There was enough of those things for two people.

One thing I really had fun with is the soda fountain. It's futuristic in the sense that it works on a touchscreen which dispenses every drink through the same sprout, but old-fashioned in the sense of ""syrup."" Like those old-timey soda fountains you hear about, it offers several bases (such as Coca-Cola, Sprite, Mello Yello, etc...) that you can choose to make all sorts of concoctions from thanks to the flavored syrups (such as Peach, Orange, Cherry, Vanilla, etc...). Peach Sprite in particular is VERY good. 

As for the ambiance of the place? I can't say I cared for it. It was so ridiculously loud in there, you basically had to yell if you wanted to talk to someone. And in spite of the large space the restaurant is in it still felt a little bit too crowded. 

The Final Verdict:

Pros:
Big, juicy, delicious burgers.
The ""create-your-own"" type menu.
A tad steep, but totally worth it for what you get.
Exceptional fries, of which you're given much more than enough of them.
The out of the ordinary soda fountain. 

Cons:
VERY noisy. Not the type of place to have any kind of meetup (which is what I was here for in the first place), that's for sure.
Cramped layout of the restaurant. 

WTF?:
What's with all of the peanuts?

Suggestions: The kitchen should be semi-closed off from the rest of the restaurant. That would probably help out with the noise problem A LOT.

Would I return? In spite of my gripe about how hectic the ambiance of the place feels, yes.",w2PyT_BYJSHOlCyxh8LzzQ,3,3,4,LCeZ9C2KJPcG3T_aUQXDXg

1312291,2011-09-29,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"Living in Las Vegas, you hear a TON of people wanting to compare Five Guys with In-N-Out.  They are both of a higher standard than the normal fast food burger-joint.  My opinion?

Burger = Still goes to In-N-Out.  That being said, Five Guys has a really tasty (and HUGE) burger.  Their standard burger is actually a double-burger.  One of my favorite toppings on a burger is grilled onions.  I don't know what they do differently, but theirs just don't have the same caramelized... ""goodness"" that In-N-Out has.  That being said, if you order a Bacon burger/cheeseburger you will get a LOT of bacon, and it is crispy and delicious.  The burger is a solid 7/10.

And now, the reason you WANT to go to Five Guys...

Fries = Five Guys by a MILE.  I ""like"" In-N-Out's fries.  They are a strong 5-6 out of 10 in my book.  The burgers are magical, the fries... eh.  I've had a LOT better.  Five Guys fries are the reason to eat there.  Not only are they delicious, but even with a small order, you get a TON of them.  They are fresh-cut (yes, I know In-N-Out's are as well, but it's a different cut with a different flavor) and seasoned just right.

The fries will be the reason I go back, and I'll have a pretty-good burger with them while I'm at it.",vFiwwcmzSEXNKMsTdvWVhg,1,0,4,LAxYNZ_T7rKdPEsudnhabA

 My friend brought me here claiming these are the best burgers in town. I've been to other five guys in town and always thought they were ok but not the greatest, five guys is on my ""I don't mind going if my friends want to go there"" list. We placed our order, got a number and grabbed some complimentary peanuts while we waited for our number to be called. 
  Is hard to write a review about this place without comparing it to In N Out burger when everything reminds me of it especially the red and white checkered tile that is so much of an In N Out trademark. Here at five guys the burgers are huge and you get so many choices for toppings but no matter what combinations I've tried I always end up with an ok burger. The fries are some of the best I've tried, even better than In N Out but on the burgers In N Out takes the prize.
  Employees are very friendly here, they help you with the menu and all the choices you have and when I tried to order two orders of fries she told me that one order would actually be enough for two people, when we finished eating we still had some fries left! 
  They also have those new freestyle soda machines with more than 100 soda flavors, I'll provably be back if friends decide to stop here but with more choices in vegas for good burgers than their soda machine has to offer there's really not many reasons that would bring me back to this place.....ok there's a few...but they're just peanuts.

Meat is corn- or grain-fed (every time I ask I get an ""I don't know but I know it isn't grass-fed.""), so no 5-star. Veggies are pretty darn fresh, fries are delicious (although nobody has been able to tell me what kind of oil they're fried in yet).

The flavors here are much fresher and more distinct than at In'n'Out. Less of the over-powering fake-cheese and sauce and more of a subtle mix of all the veggies and the beef, which I find to be a much better overall experience. 

Best part: when you ask for fries they fill your cup ""fullish"" with fries, set it in the bag, and ""top it off"" by dumping another entire helping of fries on top of your fry cup.

I brought my daughter, who zoomed in on the boxes of peanuts and immediately poured a scoop for us. We bought one cup just to try the stellar soda machine; this thing is awesome, you choose on a touch screen which type of drink (coke products, lemonade, powered, etc.), then you choose a flavor for it. Most drinks have more than the usual cherry and vanilla options. We LOVED the peach sprite, tried vanilla root beer, and coke zero cherry/vanilla. Next time we'll try all the fanta flavors.
By the time we finished sampling sodas, our order was ready!

Five Guys Burgers and Fries has a wide open kitchen where you can see the hustle and bustle of your burger cooked from start to finish.  The crispy bacon is sitting in a HUGE basket ready to go.  (Aside, I'd love a bacon basket in my kitchen.)  The burger guy is grillin', flippin' and scrapin' non-stop.  The fry guy literally has 10 baskets going from prep to fry to rest.  

We ordered ""little"" bacon cheeseburger with ""everything,"" which means, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, ketchup and mustard.  Keep in mind ""little"" only means 1 beef patty vs. 2 for the regular burger.   We also shared ordered a regular sized order of CAJUN fries.  Always a fan of any cajun seasoning, we ordered those over the regular five guys fries.   As I watched them layer all the ingredients fresh and wrap it up, I hoped that they wouldn't let it sit too long and let things get soggy.  Soggy texture is not my favorite texture at all.  Happy me, they quickly packed up and delivered everything in a bag that we ripped open immediately to devour the food.

The bite of all the fresh ingredients was fantastic, however, here are my two gripes:
- I wish that they toasted the bun because I like my bread toasty and able to hold all the wet ingredients to the very last bite.
- I wish that the fresh cut potato fries were extra crispy.  I think that being so thick and fresh they release too much moisture and end up limp and soggy.

The burgers are available any way you want them with about 12 different items for making it your own.  The regular burger is 2 patties which makes for a pretty substantial burger and little burger is one party and is about all I can handle.  The fries which are made for fresh cut Idaho potatoes are quite tasty and plentiful again a small is a cup of fries with about another cup of fries that are loose in the bag, again a small is more then enough for 1 or even 2 people.  And are available with Cajun seasoning if you wanna spice It up.

The restaurant It's self is a well lite fun place they offer peanuts by the giant box full to snack on while you wait.   For beverages the have the new future coke machine that can add selected favors to your favorite coke products...
Bottom line.  If you love burger you will love five guys and come back many time jut as I have!!  Enjoy",Y-MZ52J82c0culy39QM_VQ,1,1,5,dWLu27IY7rKpgz88f5kqHQ

First thing I noticed were sacks of potatoes, complimentary peanuts and some bright pink red patties cookin' behind the counter.. 

Double Cheeseburger: Got it with mayo, lettuce and tomato. Not the most architecturally constructed burger but not nearly as sloppy as a Tommy's Burgers either. This thing hit the right notes for me! In regards to the the patty itself, it was Absolutely packed with that great burger taste! I liked it better than Smashburger (smashburger's slightly over salted for my taste) and I'd probably take this over In-N-Out, 7/10 times (don't get me wrong, in n out is awesome).. I did notice the bottom bun starting to sponge in some of the juices from the patty but it didn't bother me much.

French Fries: Large was more than enough for 2. Their fries were fried more over done than the usual and with skin-on. I liked them, and the thought of them utilizing fresh potatoes may have mentally helped..

Service typical. Ambiance was cool and interesting with all the peanuts shells scattered on the floor surrounded by potato sacks. Value was fair for quantity But I thinkt the quality of the Burger makes up for it!",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,1,1,4,DLaU2Dq9FbSPCinJlrP2hw

I didn't realize that a regular cheeseburger was two patties.  So it was way too much food for me.  The bun got pretty soggy.  But I liked the burger and the unlimited toppings.  I would recommend getting the Little Hamburger or Little Cheeseburger and less toppings in order to preserve the bun.  Or just eat it with a knife and fork.

I agree with the other reviewers that the restaurant was super noisy. Not sure where the noise was coming from because it wasn't crowded. But the staff was super friendly.  The unlimited peanuts was a nice touch although the warnings all over the store about peanut allergies and not giving them to kids made it seem like it wasn't worth it for the business to offer them.

It took the cashier a little bit to figure it out, but she did.  Our orders came out just fine and my secret menu ""patty melt"" was SO GOOD!

Went in on a different day for an online order like I have in the past and was not greeted as usual nor acknowledged while I stood at the pick up side. I just looked at everyone no one asked if I needed assistance. I tried to say excuse me and they just kept their heads down. They weren't even busy.  I just wanted to tell them I was there to pick up my online order so that they could start on my fries. They do not start your fry order until you arrive so that they are fresh when you pick up your order. Since they didn't acknowledge me for at least 5 minutes of standing there, I sent my daughter to at least tell them we were trying to pick up our online order. Finally after her saying excuse me a few times they acknowledged her. We got our order a couple of minutes after that and left. Maybe they were having an off day?

Fries: They give you more than enough fries. Like twice as much you can fill in one order. Not too salty, but still are unique in flavor. I recommend the Cajun seasoning. 

Cheeseburger: Crispy but not dry. There's different sizes you can choose for your patty. A regular is like a double cheeseburger. Made in peanut oil & tastes delicious! I usually put jalapeño peppers, hot sauce, grilled onions, lettuce & mayo. There's lots of options. But with any combo you like, the meat makes it even better.

My wife took a bite of her burger and said they didn't include the bacon. I'd already tried mine and knew I had just a cheeseburger, so not hers. I told her I'm sure the bacon is in there, it's just hidden in the middle with the cheese. She continued to eat without bringing it up again. It wasn't until we were home and talking about our lunch that she told me again there wasn't any bacon.  Our fault for not bringing it to their attention while we were there, but clumsy for them to forget, especially since we paid extra for the bacon. I've never had a problem with Fudruckers.

I've definitely experienced better.

My boyfriend ordered a cheeseburger ""all the way,"" meaning that it has all the toppings. I ordered a hamburger with mushrooms and grilled onions (boring, I know). We also got seasoned fries to share and two fountain drinks. We spent almost $30 on two burgers, seasoned fries, and two drinks. Honestly, I wouldn't mind spending that much or even more if this was some fancy burger joint, but it wasn't. There were piles of peanuts everywhere, fries in cups, and burgers wrapped in foil. All they need now is a ringmaster and an elephant to justify the pricing. 

Our food came out within 7 minutes or so. We ripped open the fries bag for easy access and the first thing I noticed when picking out my first fry was that they were all pretty soggy. Don't get me wrong, I used to love soggy fries as a child,  but nowadays my boyfriend and I both like our fries nice and crisp, which is not what we had here. The burgers were in the same state as the fries. I understand that they're known for wrapping their burgers in foil, but c'mon, that just makes them all sweaty and soggy. Since my boyfriend got everything on his burger, the bottom was soaked in sauce and not in the delicious Carl's Jr. lookin' way. He said it was okay, but didn't end up finishing it. Mine on the other hand wasn't drenched in sauce, BUT it did look like someone wrapped it in foil and b*tch slapped it. It was all round except for one side that was flat. How does that even happen between the time they finish making it and giving it to us? The mushrooms were all droopy an didn't exactly look fresh. I finished my burger, but I was not satisfied. It was just boring. I could've gotten a better tasting burger for much cheaper at many other places in town.",AuvaQaRHBowFaFtoEMqkVg,5,1,2,dy5KqI3QlsWSqG2ktoA5xw

I was very intrigued, and I love how Chick Fil A uses peanut oil to fry everything, so I figured it would be something like a beefy version of Chick Fil A. I ordered a little bacon cheeseburger with bbq sauce, grilled onions, jalapenos, lettuce, tomato alongside some Cajun
fries. 

The burger was delicious. It was really juicy, and I loved how the crust of the meat was very crispy. The cheese was delicious as well. The jalapenos added a nice kick to the burger.

The cajun fries were really bad though. They needed some salt, and they needed it badly. Otherwise, they were well seasoned, but I couldn't eat more than a couple of fries without feeling this immense dryness in my mouth. Another pet peeve is that they only have malt vinegar and ketchup for the fries. I tried the malt vinegar with the fries, and I thought it was disgusting. It didn't taste like malt vinegar to me. It tasted more like apple cider vinegar. Since I'm not a ketchup fan, I didn't end up eating a lot of the fries. You could really taste that they were fried in peanut oil by the way. It wasn't a positive or a negative; it was just very prevalent.

Sure they have one of those fancy soda machines that let's you customize your drink from 5 billion possible flavor combinations and not to mention free peanuts that you can break and eat at your leisure. And sure, they have exceptional customer service, but for me personally, the negatives outweigh the positives.

I guess perhaps the three main issues I have with the joint are the noise, price, and the fries. Every time I have come to this Five Guys the employees are shouting orders to each other while customers are sometimes sitting less than 15 feet away. Not sure if this just a quirk about the restaurant, but it's kind of annoying and prevents me from effectively conversing with the people at my table if I am forced to sit too close to the front counter when the place is busy. As far as the french fry situation goes, I am all for Five Guys hooking it up with giant portion sizes but this all comes at the expense of having to eat said extra fries directly out of their brown paper bag.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,0,1,3,yaNS9TKPyBLbMVyKo2Lwlw

The burgers are good and can be customised. I like that you can get a low carb burger like in-n-out (they taste better @ 5 G). One comment would be the buns. They taste a bit sweet to me and can get soggy quickly, but that also has something to do w wrapping them in foil instead of paper which would be the way to go. If you like your fries crispy, ask for them well done.

I got the mini cheeseburger and it was still a large burger. The cheese was perfectly melted, the tomatoes and lettuce were super fresh, the mushrooms were sautéed to perfection and the freshly fried French fries were an awesome side.

3881900,2011-12-05,2,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"Move over In-N-Out!  Five Guys gets 5 stars from me!  

Numerous toppings to select from and a great ""classic cheesybugery flavor"" that sticks to your ribs.  You have  to pay a little more for cheese and/or bacon, but all of their burgers, hotdogs, and sandwiches come with the option to add up to 15 different toppings at no additional charge.  Mmmm...I love the grilled onions & mushrooms option.  You know you've done some eating when you leave FGBF.  

Have you ever had 2+ people in your party order the same thing (ie. cheeseburgers) with completely different toppings and then have them all tossed in the bag with no markings??  At FGBF they label each burger with a # that coordinates to the order in which your party placed their order.  I know it's a little thing, but it sooo delights me to not have to play musical burgers, trying to guess which one belongs to who.

Have no fear if you decide to make a pit stop while hanging with your cool vegan friends; they offer Vegan Sandwiches, which I've heard are quite tasty.  

I'm no newbie to Cajun Fries, as I'm originally from North Carolina, where I grew up eating Bojangle's Cajun Fries.  With that said, I did find FGBF a little overseasoned.  Next time I'm planning to ask if they can do lightly seasoned Cajun Fries, otherwise their regular fries are outstanding.  

The wait isn't long, but they offer peanuts to snack on (if you're not allergic) as you complete the final stage of your ""Get Some Beef in May Bellay"" mission.  

My favorite part is an often overlooked place to excel in the customer experience, the soda dispenser.  As I approached this fancy pants machine, I'm noticing all of these buttons!!  I press the Diet Coke button and then receive another (no less than) 6 options for flavored Diet Coke, ranging from cherry, cherry vanilla, vanilla, orange, lime, and one more.  They even offered all of these choices in the Caffeine Free Diet Coke variety as well.

They explained that the regular was a double patty so I ordered the ""little"" bacon cheeseburger.  I got my burger with lettuce, jalapeños, and grilled mushrooms.
The people I was with took care of ordering two medium fries for the five of us and that was plenty.

The burger was a nondescript piece of cooked, ground beef.   There was one half of a piece of lettuce that was only partly on the patty.  There were no mushrooms that I could see anywhere.  The bacon was crumbled pieces of bacon on the bottom bun under the burger, not the more common bacon slices you'd get at most places.

The fries were good. I liked the amount of salt they used.  Had I been ordering for myself, I would have ordered cajun fries but alas I wasn't.

The fact that they have free peanuts to snack on before the burger comes or after or to take a bag home with you didn't phase me at all.  I think I had three peanuts and that was good enough.

The place doesn't deserve a 2 star rating but I really hate to round it to three.  The fries will push it to a three.  Let's just say it's not a place to which I'd return!  Also, the music was BLARING!  It was awful!!!",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,3,3,3,Xy-YhFbPlCDW4r456bsG6g

Seriously, a cheap meal to be had!  But oh, the possibilities!  Going here reminds me of going to a classic diner with all the red and white inside.  Place is pretty clean, and damn that smell of fresh burgers and fries is intoxicating.  I go here when McDonald's or Burger King just don't do it for me.  

Menu is simple, you got your burgers, your dogs, your sandwiches, and your fries.  Oh yeah, and they serve Coca-Cola!  Rejoice!  Alright, today we'll just focus on their specialty, the burgers.  Five Guys has several offerings, hamburger, cheeseburger, bacon burger, bacon cheeseburger, as well as a 'little' option for the above mentioned burgers.  The little burgers offer one meat patty instead of the regular size two patties that come on each of Five Guys' burgers.  I'm a big dude, but I usually opt for the little cheeseburger because I like lots of fixings on my burger.  Plus, it's cheaper!  No joke, I'm a bit of a cheapy...except on health insurance and collectible toys.

Don't get me started on the free toppings that you can include on your burger, I go nuts!  My burger always comes out HEAVY because of the stuff I add to my burger.  If you're a purist, you won't like me.  I like colors when I eat!  Anyway, free toppings include:

-Mayo
-Mustard
-Ketchup
-Lettuce
-Tomatoes
-Pickles
-Onions
-Relish
-Grilled Onions
-Grilled Mushrooms
-Jalapenos
-Green Peppers
-A1
-BBQ Sauce
-Hot Sauce

As many as you want, on your burger.  Now I haven't seen anyone get all of them on a burger yet but here's what I like on mine, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, grilled mushrooms, mayo, BBQ sauce, A1, and a touch of hot sauce.  Killer!  But I'll just as easily go lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles, mayo, mustard, and ketchup to keep my cheeseburger classy.

Fries here are good, but I always get them well-done.  I just like em' super crispy and not so soggy.  I like the cajun style fries too, nice and spicy.  They come in two sizes, small and LARGE.  Go for the large, so you can share!  Or be a wee lil' piggy like me and keep them all for yourself.  Don't forget your drink!  Get one because their fabuloso Coca-Cola machine is from the future!  Use the touch screen to try over 100 drink options or create one of your own!  For some reason I always stick with a Diet Cherry Coke.  Hey, don't judge!

While you are waiting for your order don't forget to get messy with a dish of their roasted peanuts.  Can't miss the huge bags sitting there on the way to the counter.  Ask your server for some.  They're free!  I can't tell you how much I don't mind free food.  If you're nice, sometimes they'll let you take a bag of peanuts home with you.

The taste?  On par with other specialty burger places like In N Out and Smashburger.  It's not uber gourmet, but it's hot, fresh, and efficient.  Nothing artificial, nothing sitting under a heat lamp, and nothing microwaved.  It's a decent meal for a decent price.  For two people, you can get a couple of loaded little cheeseburgers, large fries, and a large drink to share for around $15!  That's not bad for a date night!

Note to diners! I had forgotten.  The regular burger is really a double patty and the little is a single patty.

Unfortunately I don't think it lived up to the hype - but I still rate them A-OK with 3 stars.  First of all one single burger, one double burger, a large fries, and one drink came to almost $20.  Steep for a burger meal for two in my opinion.  Ok, the peanuts was a nice touch.  I loved that they are free and I enjoyed them.  I also loved the fancy Coke machines with lots of drink choices.  I really, really like when I have the option of more than just 5 sodas.  

Ok on to the food.  The burgers were overly dry.  They were severely overcooked.  At a ""gourmet"" burger joint I like to have the option of a medium cooked burger.  There is nothing I hate more than an overcooked burger.  I did like that there was a good choice of toppings including grilled onions and mushrooms.  The bacon on my burger was a little to dry and crumbly.  The buns are strangely crushed and looked really bad.  I wished I had a camera, but below here I see a burger bun that is exactly what I am talking about.  The fries were pretty terrible.  Soggy and really strangely cooked.  Half were brown and soggy.  The other half seemed to be cooked less.  It was almost like they were different batches of fries mixed together.  Needless to say the two of us only ate about half of the fries and tossed the rest.  I do like that they have both ketchup and vinegar.  I heard after that they had Cajun fries which I didn't notice on the menu board and were not suggested.  I would have ordered them if I had known.  Maybe next time.  One odd thing is that even though you say it's for there everyone gets their food in a bag.  I would have preferred a tray instead - it's just more convenient and less wasteful of packaging.  

The employees didn't seem really happy, but they were cordial.  Service was a little slow I'm guessing because they cooked the burgers too long.  It was not busy when we got there, but it picked up towards the end.  When we left the line was really long.  It seemed like they needed a couple more employees on hand at lunch time.

I got mine with ketchup, mustard, lettuce, tomato, and grilled mushrooms... And it was messy messy messy. My advice is to eat it there, these don't seem to travel well.  The bun on mine was getting soggy from the juices.  We split an order of the regular friends. While plentiful, were nothing special. 

Overall, it was an a-ok burger. I think if I had eaten there, I would have given this location 4 stars but I just can't say I am a fan of soggy buns.",Ae4uXwFHp-5fGrt6OONaXw,1,2,3,Urwi1Xaz8P08BJnMylAG6Q

This location has seemed to give up on even a glimmer of hope for their quest to become the best burger.

I can see why the place is never packed like some of it's nearby competitors. It starts with the careless employees and ends with a burger fit for someone who just needs to consume.

And at roughly $8 dollars minimum per person, you might as well go to a decent restaurant if they are going to make you wait for the food served at this location. 

This last experience was the last straw. Cashier/order taker seemed to comprehend English but it was not the case as somehow our regular cheeseburger and bacon cheeseburger turned into their Little Cheese Burger, which is the kids sized overcooked and overseasoned hockey puck that they feature. The bacon on the cheeseburger was overcooked to the point where it all fell out of the burger onto the table when the burger was picked up.

It took 10 minutes to overcook our order incorrectly so we just left not wanting to be late for work.

You know, where the fries are hand cut, thick with their skins on? Fried on the spot and a ton of salt? Yessir! Well Five Guys fries are just.like.that. Only here you don't have to wait until the summer to get them. I like ordering the large and taking home my leftovers. I could eat them fr a whole week. And the burgers are awesome too. This is like, real meat, and really flame-grilled, not like BK flame-grilled. And the toppings you have to choose from? Holy moly! Super fresh, creative toppings! The hot-dogs are really good too. Hot dogs in this country are usually kind of bland; in Mexico they actually have flavor. The hot-dogs here kind of taste like Mexican hot-dogs. You can also get the toppings on your dog as well.

They have a bin full of peanuts that you can snack on while you wait for your meal. The decor is Red and White just like In -n -Out but this restaurant had more seating.

4506547,2011-10-30,1,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"Daughter, Kathy, and I were in need of Lunch; and we wanted to stay in this area... Five Guys was the choice, since Kathy knew I had been taste-testing one-pound Burgers in Northern California... where I live.

It was last Tuesday, a half hour before Noon, and there was no line at all at that time... Lucky, I guess.

If you're into Burgers, the menu is divided between the Single-Pattie Burgers preceded by ""Little"" in the name... And the double-Pattie kind... about a buck fifty difference in general. Toppings are free... Mayo, Lettuce, Pickles, Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Grilled Mushrooms, Ketchup, Mustard, Relish, Onions, Jalapeno Peppers, A1 Steak Sauce, BBQ Sauce, and Hot Sauce.... whew! If you say ""Everything"" (or some synonym), you'll receive Mayo to Mustard piled on.

Question to clerk... ""What is your favorite Burger?"" Answer... ""I don't eat Burgers. I'm a Vegetarian."" Five Guys must be paying this clerk well... to have a Vegetarian work at a despicable Hamburger Stand.

Well... decided on the...

Cheeseburger (** 1/2 $5.79) Toppings consisted of Extra Mayo, Onions, Lettuce, Tomato & Mustard.

Everyone Brown-Bags it at Five Guys... everyone... including dine-in customers. My first impression after unwrapping the Cheeseburger was the thought that this tastes like something familiar... couldn't come to a definite conclusion. But the general impression... nothing that would knock your socks off... in essence, Just a Burger! And an expensive one at that... especially with the Fries as an additional purchase! (See similar double-pattie from Burger King called a Buck Double...)

Regular Cajun Style Fries (** $2.89) if it weren't for the fact that the Fries came out cool and over-cooked.. this would be a pretty good pile of Fries... especially with the sprinkled Cajun Spice Powder. 

As you all know... once the Fries get cool... they also get clumpy.... and you have to eat them faster, faster and faster before they get COLD!

Question to audience... Does Five Guys deliberately throw the Fries into the Brown Bag? Seems like it...

4539254,2011-09-28,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"I really like Five Guys Burgers. A few of my friends were underwhelmed by the burgers/prices/whatever, but I'm definitely a fan. It seems that people constantly draw comparisons to In-N-Out (and I get why), but the burgers are a lot bigger here and there are so many toppings to choose from; it just isn't the same thing.

Pros: 
Gigantic Burgers! I got a bacon cheeseburger (with 2 patties, which is the default size) with jalapenos, onions, lettuce, tomato, and a bunch of other stuff I can't remember. This thing was about 5 inches tall and weighed like 20lbs*. 

Fresh Jalapenos!! This is a big one for me. It's very, very rare that any place uses fresh jalapenos as a topping. It's always the slices that come in a jar soaking in vinegar and are dark green and not spicy. Those are good on nachos. You know what's better on nachos? Fresh jalapenos! They're better on everything, and Five Guys recognizes this. Well done, chaps! 

Peanuts while you wait! I don't really care for peanut, but the option is nice. You just grab a paper tray and fill it with some peanuts while you wait for your monster burger to be cooked.

Flavor! As with the jalapenos, the other toppings are all fresh and delicious. The bun has a nice flavor to it, and the beef tastes great. I like my burgers medium-rare, but these patties have a nice charred exterior and taste great. 

Bacon!! I feel like I don't have to comment on this one. It's bacon.

Cons:
The bun. While it tastes great, it isn't really substantial enough for mammoth-sized burger duties. It's really soft, which unfortunately leads to the bottom bun getting overwhelmed with burger juices. About halfway through my burger I had messy hands and was essentially just holding on to the patty on the bottom. The top doesn't get as bad, but it still doesn't hold up. Toasting the bun would likely help, or even putting the lettuce on the bottom would prevent the bottom from getting soaked. 

The fries. I don't usually like fries, but I felt like I had to try these. A lot of people talk about how good the fries are, and it's in the name, so, why not? I didn't care for them at all. They do give you a lot, though, so if you like fries, you might like these. 

Five Guys is quickly becoming my favorite burger chain. With it's gigantic, flavorful burgers and it's fairly reasonable prices (I think the bacon double cheeseburger is like 6 bucks. Not bad for almost a day's worth of food), you can't really go wrong.

I walked in today after getting my eyes looked at the awesome eye doc above this place. I asked the girl working the counter for a cheeseburger with everything, plus fries and a drink. At most places, this would constitute some sort of combo meal. Here they seemed to charge me for everything piece meal. All together it was right north of $12, which seemed kinda steep. Thinking it might be totally worth it like Smashburger, I was cool with it. 

While waiting for my burger and fries, I went up to their cool-looking future soda tron. It's essentially a soda machine with a touch screen that allows you to pick from a bunch of different types of soda. So far, so good. A few minutes later, someone walked by and asked me if they could get me ketchup or something while I waited for my food. I said yes, thank you, that'd be swell. Plus points for that. Then a few moments later my food was ready. I ate a few of my ""spicy"" fries for a minute and headed home. Twenty minutes later, I was home and ready to tear into my burger. O opened it up, and... how to put this nicely... my expectations were not met. I found a smallish burger topped with all the usual fixings. $12 worth of food? Nope. 

I tore into it and was even further depressed. The burger was ok, on par with the burgers my dad sometimes makes at home. Good meat and seasoning, sure, and probably well worth $5, but not 12. It wasn't even a big enough burger where you can say at least you got your money back in volume.

The appeal of Five Guys is in the charming set-up; the casual diner concept is cute, with the free peanuts at the door, and the lack of standard fast food corporate decor. The experience is refreshing; being able to personalize your burger, waiting for your order number to be called out, interacting with pleasant, happy staff. They do a great job keeping the place upbeat and clean! 

It's a unique place, and fun to eat at, definitely. Depending on preference, I can see why these burgers/fries are a favorite of so many, but they're not mine, so I'll probably be back only when someone else decides to tag me along. Plus points for the endless possibilities, though - I'll definitely branch out and try again the next time I end up there.",KcBC-1eQ5ycshERutvKccw,0,0,3,65-U4JuyteTzKeZMtB2H_Q

 Bacon cheeseburger with everything. I swear it tastes homemade with the grilled onions and mushrooms. Only change I would do is no ketchup and maybe ask for a different sauce next time. Fresh cut fries always a plus, got the cajun fries. Fries come in a paper cup that is filled then overfilled! Lots of fries were spilled in the bag too! That's a good thing!

Free roasted peanuts, help yourself! Never seen that before.

While eating two different workers came by and asked how everything was, very friendly. I also seen another worker helping a little girl get her soda from the new soda fountain.

4701473,2013-09-17,2,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"I was truly excited to try Five Guys because of all the wonderful things I've heard and basically, the hype around it. My brother and I ventured one afternoon and I was less than pleased. I did enjoy the fact that everyone was extremely friendly and not being charged for extra patties! Plus, the restaurant itself is nice and I was mesmerized by the high-tech soda machine (I wish I were able to utilize it, but no soda for me!). 

Our cashier, also really nice and friendly, was clueless about their ingredients! Their menu states one of the toppings to be ""green peppers"" and since I was unfamiliar with their burgers, I asked her what type of green peppers the menu was referring. Confusion. I continued, ""Are they green BELL peppers, green CHILI peppers..?"" The cashier responded, ""Oh yeah, they're peppers, but, uh, I don't think they're spicy."" All right...so I thought, okay some roasted or marinated green peppers? That sounds good on a burger. So I ordered two patties with green peppers, onions, lettuce, and tomato. My brother and I shared regular fries and cajun fries.

You can imagine my disappointment when I opened my wrapper and realized that my first assumption of green bell peppers was right, but the cashier failed, not only to acknowledge that thought, but told me otherwise. How can you not know that your restaurant serves green bell peppers?? I amounted this to, hopefully, ignorance. It didn't add to a good experience for me because had I known they were bell peppers, I wouldn't have ordered it. Who wants raw bell peppers on their burger? It was so awkward. Plus, my burger was absolutely flavorless. I actually had to season my own burger with salt and pepper. I probably should have ordered cheese and condiments, but a good burger shouldn't have to rely on those accompaniments. The burger was tender and cooked well though. The fries were also good. I love handcut fries, so this was no exception. The cajun fries though, I will pass. I love cajun seasoning, but I felt like I was inside their shaker of cajun. It was SO overwhelming that it took away from the pleasantry of the fries.

I don't know; my brother really enjoyed his burger and I take partial blame for not ordering my burger with cheese and other condiments to add flavor (I was trying to be healthier), but the burger shouldn't be flavorless alone! The fries are really great though (without the cajun drowning). So, I may take another stab at Five Guys - get a completely different burger and enjoy the fries..we'll see.",TdYKJgSgY2GF_YJnwsi5yQ,7,4,2,T6yTozF1DLD4FGf9EEO6Qw

Try saying that three times really fast. It just rolls of the tongue.

 I have always admired this place since my days in Florida. Honestly the only thing that I would change is the noise level. 

The burgers are cooked in 100% pure peanut oil. The ground beef taste fresh as well. 

They have a plethora of peanuts in multiple places. At the entrance and near the cashier looks like they have stacks and stacks everywhere, plus they are free.

5048438,2012-06-24,1,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"Out of all the things my mom in law and grandma in law wanted for a late Mothers Day they wanted a burger. They never tried Five Guys and neither has the BF and it's been forever for me so off we go. 

We each got a burger and got a large plain fries to share. You pick your basic burger which gives you the choice of amount of patty, with/without cheese and bacon then there are ""free"" toppings you can do. The one thing I don't like is how it is wrapped in foil and put in a bag so it got a bit smushed. The burger itself was really juicy. Because it is fresh made and wrapped in foil, I don't really feel this is good take out food and will get soggy. 

I don't get the In N Out comparison at all. I was talking to a friend online and the first thing they asked is if it was better than In N Out. Yeah they're both simple menus and serve it up fresh but the taste is apples to oranges. They're both good, and just different. If you like more toppings than standard, this is probably more of your place. 

I like their fries a lot. It's a good mix of a bit of a soft and crispy like a hybrid between a steak fry and a french fries. A large was shared between four people and we had some left. It is big servings....if you want fries it's probably good to share a regular between 2. 

Everyone talks about the machine and I pictured when people said they have ice tea that it would be attached to the machine and I can flavor it however I want. It was separate and standard Peak tea flavors so I was a bit sad about that. I ended up trying a few of the Dasani waters instead since I'm not really a big soda person. 

They were really efficient with the line and came to even check on us at our table which is a positive unusual for a fast food place.

Overall, it was pretty good and more importantly mom and grandma was happy. They are looking forward to the one opening on Lake Mead by their place and they really want to return. As much as I enjoyed the food at that moment, I had major itis and angry tummy. I just can't eat good and greasy stuff so it's not their fault at all.

Went to this location about a month ago with my sister as my maiden visit to a Five Guys. Place was nice and clean. Open kitchen so you could see what exactly they were doing. The free dry roasted peanuts were a nice touch but it seemed a bit odd to wanna dig into any more after our food arrived. I am partial to boiled peanuts too hehe.
The cashier was friendly but yea, it was a bit weird she couldn't answer or ask what type of green peppers they had. I did notice later I got charged for a regular burger when I did order a double. I couldn't be sure if they forgot to charge me the extra or that's how it is there. The size of the burger was decent. The burger patties themselves did seem a bit bland. Cajun fries seemed over seasoned, drowned in the red powder. Regular fries were good, could be a bit crispier, but that's just my preference.
I wasn't exactly blown away. Not sure if I'd prefer it over normal fast food burger 'n fries but maybe I didn't get the best they normally had to offer. Another visit is possible in the future to fully gauge that.",zL2wX9mGV1p1nUSOk5mKxg,0,0,3,GyJgcihz3dwuxjdToDN9YA

I did not finish all those fries. I just had a simple hamburger and it was pretty small patty for almost six bucks. I like the idea of choosing toppings for free though.

On a side note, the soda fountain machine is tremendous.  It's truly straight out of a Jetsons (automatically dating myself bigtime!) episode.  I've never had that many choices for beverages at a burger joint with quite a few flavors I've never seen like raspberry diet coke.

I took it back up there and indicated the bacon wasn't hot, and her response was its made in the morning. Okay.... so I handed back the bacon and said never mind. I mean who wants cold or room temperature bacon on their burger?? They could at least throw the bacon on a flat top for a minute to warm it back up.

I think In N Out or Fatburger produce a much tastier burger, and In N Out is a hell of a lot cheaper.",H0tfWQsGjEBuhXD4WUtpHw,1,0,2,XK8r7xTGnriGvfGmyrwovg

I am writing this review not on the food, but more so on the staff.  They were so friendly and went out of their way to accommodate us.  They went above and beyond and made us feel very special.  We have some special food requests and they were so kind!  On a side note, I tried his burger and fries, and they were both pretty amazing.

5767488,2011-12-15,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"Don't believe the hype...  This place was all over the broadcast and print news when they first started opening in Vegas, so when I wanted a burger, I figured 'What the heck?'.  Well, as 'cool' as the interiors are, and as nice as the employees were, I have to say I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe it's a case of too much hype, since they have quotes from other city reporters and periodicals posted all over the place stating how they're the best burgers ever.  I don't know, it just seemed ordinary to me.  Not bad, but not worth trecking there if it's not on your way to somewhere else.

Everything is served in brown paper bags, which is ok I guess.  Conserve water you'd waste washing trays, but kill more trees with paper bags?  I guess it's a tradeoff.  One cool thing I enjoyed was the boxes of peanuts everywhere, and you nosh on those while you wait for your order.

Like I said, I wouldn't NOT go there, I just wouldn't go out of my way to go there.  I'll stick to IN-N-OUT.",btUugfufQAe-QD6gC_Ckmw,0,0,2,ka75VwdEGIGpEruqEeSJvw

Atmosphere 3/5: It's a fast food joint so no big surprise. The place a little bit dirty but beside that, it was alright.
Food 4/5: I was pretty shocked by the Burger. It was pretty good actually and I really like that I was able to choose the garnitures on my burger and it was free. The burger is pretty decent size and actually preferred the bun from 5-Guys vs. In-N-Out. The Cajun style fries are really good.
Service N/A: 

Overall, a good experience at Five Guys and Fries. But In-N-Out stays my favorite for their Secret Menu.",L4S915BUVypnswOLWUWlYw,0,0,4,qaHBxnWA30ZztJzbEsT9_w

Go ahead, throw your money away.

The employees are well rehearsed with answers when people complain of the prices.
Try them out,, and if you fall for the high prices,, you'll fall for the lame answers.
Ask them was that reply number one,,, or was it reply number 8?

Service is usually great and friendly but for my visit today I have to take two stars off. Came in late afternoon no one in line At all. Usually in this place you can barely get in the door without the whole staff  yelling out to you and welcoming you. I was never greeted at all even when I got up to the counter. Just a blank stare from the cashier no hello anything. I'm the one that had to greet her to which I got ""what can I get you"" . Not the biggest deal but was for sure a little off service wise today.",BDmxm7aeWFOLT35gSvkmig,2,0,3,4oSiYjK2zHv2X3uxVlONnA

I have tried In and Out, Smash Burger, and Five Guys and they all have their strengths but if we are simply talking quality meat and quality burger...Five Guys all the way.  

The menu is short and straight forward and you can add as many toppings as you like, no additional cost.  I realize this place is more costly than In and Out but its in a different class and at least they HAVE bacon here. Bacon is a must.",AjyjpkhcU2IWdgD8VTwN7g,1,1,5,aVzXtCa3gULQ3xbyDr2U3w
5868428,2013-04-16,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"I don't get the hype about this place. The cheeseburger I got was a hot mess. Standard is a double patty so if you want a single get the ""Little"" version. What bugged me was the meat was about as flavorless as what you'd get at a McDonalds, the burger was saturated with mayo, and it looked like it was thrown together before the bun was smashed on and wrapped in foil. Disgusting to look at and eat. I've had much better at Burger King.

Only reason it got 2 stars was their fries, both regular and cajun, were great. Save yourself and get a way better burger at Smashburger or In-N-Out.",bYE5X-TTejK1yVMdKfRYdA,0,0,2,j4qtJ5mluiIYveGhocaGyQ

Mostly all the staff smile and makes sure I'm okay. A young lady even came up to me to ask if I wanted her to get me a refill or more fries! What great service! Now there's the most important part, the food. The burgers are near flawless, with the abundant amount of choices you have for toppings. You must get bacon in your burger as well! Now, I know what you're thinking. A lot of places, when you order bacon in your burger. You get this rubbery, chewy piece of meat. But Five Guy's bacon is as crispy as can be. Fries are also tasty, Cajun is what I prefer though. So if you're in the mood for a burger. Five guys is a must try!",rMwYUSvoDOaGQvGqSj_6gw,0,0,5,nd6ltw726iku_cmL81bZ8w
5918514,2012-01-10,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"The most memorable part of dining at Five Guys Burgers and Fries is the suped up soda machine.  It dispenses ice, and has a touch screen that let's you select amongst 121 drink options (sodas, sweet teas) and another four brewed teas.  Thank the Forerunners that the burger ordering process here does not involved that much overwhelming choices.

As far as burgers go, it is a decent burger made with fresh ingredients. And the toppings are already included in the asking price, and you can customize your burger with as much or little of it as your heart desire.

Taste wise, I still think In-n-Out is better. But it definitely beats out burgers served at your typical fast food joints.  Plus they do not have the flexibility of allowing you to customize your toppings as you would at a Five Guys Burger location.

Grab the peanuts if you want, it is complimentary.  But the soda machine is my top reason for coming back.  Seriously, where was this machine when we were little and have friends that make drinks with every flavor sodas that comes out of the soda fountain???

Decor/Ambiance:  4/5  Simple no frills fast food restaurant tables and chairs.  Brightly lit.

Food:  3.5/5  No complaints, it is like burgers you get at a back yard BBQ, without the burnt patties or lighter fluid flavoring.  Solid but not gourmet.

Value:  3.5/5  Costs more than other fast food, but uses better ingredients. You get what you pay for.

Service:  4/5.  The cashier was great at describing what they serve making my first visit here as un-daunting as possible.

Cleanliness:  4.5/5  The staff here keeps the place nice and clean, even during the dinner rush.  Good job!

Parking:  4/5  Should not be an issue.

Overall, I would rate Five Guys Burgers and Fries more than just A-Ok (3 stars) but not quite 4 stars.  Will be back though, especially to explore what else the soda machine is capable of serving up.

Only thing missing, IMO are milk shakes.",RQlnSCjuqMnhR3Qk6j4KoA,5,2,3,wYvsufyhtlnwr54Ln2IBdQ

5928801,2011-07-21,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"I was excited to see that they were opening a Five Guys that was closer to where I lived because I have heard so many good things about this place. This location just opened up a few days ago. Today I was in the area and decided to try it out for lunch. 

When I walked in, all the friendly employees immediately greeted me. When it was my turn to order, the cashier asked me if this was my very first visit, and took a minute to explain the menu to me. This is what I learned:

-The regular burgers have 2 beef patties
-The little burgers have 1 beef patty
-Toppings are free, you pick which ones you want
-They also have hot dogs and grilled cheese sandwiches
-They don't have any combo meals, so you just order everything separately
-They offer free peanuts
-They pack your food in a brown paper bag, regardless of whether you are eating in or taking it to go

I ordered:

-Little Cheeseburger (with lettuce and ketchup): nothing wrong with the beef patty, it was pretty juicy and tasty. The problem was the bun. It was waaaay too soggy, to the point where eating the burger was not enjoyable. I guess I just prefer grilled bread, or slightly crispy buns, like how they do it at In-N-Out.

-Regular Fries (Five Guys style): nothing special. Most of it was soggy, so I only ate a few and had to throw the rest away. 

I do have to say that this place is very clean. I think I saw three employees wiping down the tables, the windows, and sweeping the floor while I was waiting for my food. 

I'm glad I got to try this place. But unfortunately, I wasn't impressed and feel it is over hyped. If I ever come back, I would probably try one of their hot dogs. 

I'll stick to In-N-Out and Smashburger.",FOoN3DJzDUnl4EAQaTJIGg,1,0,3,eh7r88I77EG7XwXXTxo9Jg
5937003,2012-03-17,0,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"Ok, am pretty sure you have heard of Five Guys Burger & Fries, and had probably thought what a peculiar name for a burger joint, like couldn't they could've come up with a much better name? Thankfully the burgers and fries live up to its reputation. Once you walk in you will get that home grown American vibe, they have complimentary roasted peanuts you can munch on, no throwing peanut shells on the floor though like I've seen in some good ole American steak houses. Make sure you have your order ready by the time you get to the cashier in order to avoid the other hungry customers glaring at you. The menu is pretty simple, yet you might find yourself confused when you get to the counter. Yes it is pretty pricy for a fast food burger joint, I mean we are talking about $5 burgers here. The cheapest burger is called the little burgers and they are about $5. The name is a bit deceiving because you would think that little would be the size of sliders, but they are actually regular size burgers with only 1 patty. The ""Bigger"" burger will have 2 patties. Pretty much it is a build your own burger, you choose what goes on your burger like grilled onions, mushrooms, jalapeños etc at no additional cost. They have hot dogs too as well as vegetarian items. The drinks are like almost $3 each, but that's because they have a state of the art soda dispenser with a plethora of choices where you can drink to your heart's content. The steak cut fries are definitely the highlight of this establishment! Crunchy on the outside, moist on the inside, plus a bonus of extra helpings just to keep you satisfied. They put a sign telling you where the potato used for the fries came from so you know that it's fresh.  To sum it all up it is just good ole American burger and fries, nothing fancy schmancy about it, but as they say simplicity is beauty. Once you figure what and how to order, it doesn't seem that pricy any more. For me this is my go to place for a guilty pleasure. If I have to compare this place to our local In N Out Burger, I have to say its a totally different flavor, In N Out is good too, this is also good as well, I guess you just have to decide for yourself.",UAO-fiRQl0Why09SjUaMjw,1,1,5,vUXeF07CTSUaOwDymVJXog
5983643,2013-04-26,1,DB9BRdu7is0AK1DvcuKlcw,"It was OK.

I got the little bacon cheeseburger (which was actually not that little) with everything on it and added jalapenos.  The bf and I split unseasoned fries.  Everything comes out in a brown paper bag whether you're dining in or taking it to go.  If you did get a drink, they have one of those fancy Coca-Cola machines where you can add stuff into your soda.  Too bad I'm not a soda gal.

At first, the bf pulled out a small cup of fries and I thought we got jipped.  Then, he ripped open the brown paper bag on it's side to reveal a crap ton of secret fries!  It's basically like they took two cupfuls of fries, dumped it in the bag, then stuffed the cup full of fries again and put that in the bag too.  But I was happy; I love fries.  The unseasoned fries were good.  The burger was just OK.  Mine eventually fell apart though and I gave up trying to hold it together. 

If I have a burger craving, it won't be for Five Guys unfortunately.  I'd still rather run to In-N-Out to get my beef on.",V93YZAMFAF4eejiIPRs0zw,4,1,3,RYbj-wd5Jo1ufG65560z_A
