Usually I go late night but today I went in around 5 ish. Was greeted by the kitchen employees and when they asked what I wanted I nicely replied with ""I need a few minutes"". This man I never seen working there before said in Spanish a rude remark back to his coworkers about me saying I'm not ready yet. I was so offend, and he totally ruined my appetite so I left without ordering anything. Horrible experience for a loyal customer.",r_xmrF17FH07DeKVp_topQ,0,0,1,KujyTphKbEzYb_q0jddMMQ

If you're not a fan of LOTS of raw onion, ask for it on the side. I'm a fan of it but even I thought it was a bit much. You've been warned. 

Like other reviewers have mentioned, a salsa bar would be nice but they do have lime wedges and sliced radishes available for the taking. However, you do get salsa on your tacos and a side of grilled onions (yes, more onions) & peppers. 

The BF and I got a plate of Al Pastor and Carne Asada, each for $9.99 and they came with a couple packets of hot tortillas. We went the DIY taco route. I'll be back for another fix soon.",GLp5vueztLtd8HtcvqvhBw,1,0,4,UTy3z8adwlfoZpQVVMxGNg

While El Gordo is the big name joint, I think Taco Tijuana is better for two reasons. One is freshness: for some reason El Gordo's taste a little old, while Taco Tijuana is always juicy and tender and amazing. They have the same style and menu, so the nuance of preparation is key. The second is portion. Taco Tijuana tacos are MUCH larger, bursting with more meat, than their competition. I was disappointed by the skinny taco I got at El Gordo last time. You get double your money at this place, so it's become my go to, and I figured it was time I wrote them a much due review. The staff is friendly as well.

I used to like it so much that friday nights was Taco Tijuana night.Last night was the last straw i dint finish my burrito that was stuffed with dry rice and bits of carne asada. The tacos de lengua were rubbery and oozzing green tomatillo sauce .The tacos some how have shrank.The asada fries are shoe string fries coverd in sour cream and cheez with bits of carne asada.

After a few bites it went in the trash. The carne asada burrito meat was overcooked and tasted burnt. The pastor burrito tasted horrible like old meat and had this weird pink tint to it.

746366,2013-07-14,0,2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg,"""Simple food cooked with fresh ingredients and passion, is sometimes the best food you can find""
FOOD: My husband and I had 4 Al Pastor and after a free testing of Buche also had 4 of those. The meats tasted great, they were hot to the touch and juicy as if just recently cooked. The tortillas were also soft but not to the point were they would break with the heavy weight of the meats and toppings. The salsas, both the red and green were very tasty, not too hot not to mild. The mulas, which we had never had before are actually an upgrade from a regular quesadilla, which we loved! The addition of melted cheese along with the meats and fresh guacamole made them a wonderful experience.

SERVICE: Service was exceptional, not only did they explain every cut of meat but offered a free tasting so we knew what we were ordering. Yes, there are other Tijuana Style tacos out there, but the personal service and attention to detail made this one our best experiences yet.
SITTING AREA: I agree with the other reviewer, sitting may be an issue during peak times, but we were there at approximately 6pm on Thursday and we had a table with no issues.
PRICE: You can not beat a total bill of under $20 dollars for 8 tacos, 2 mulas and two free-refill drinks, to include Aguas Frescas if you choose, amongst the variety of sodas.
You can definitely bring the family for a great time and they will be full!

My only concern is that as with other ""recently opened"" places they will change in time, cut on the servings, forget about the customer service and raise their prices....unfortunately we have seen it too many times with both restaurants and grocery stores. As for now, you have new faithful customers who will pass on the great experience to others!",YoeGd8zvTHHrSSW__5rScA,2,2,4,ebwy1t4IJtNMWenohcn2Cg

We ordered a tripas burrito with everything and a large order of carne asada fries... I was excited to go home and eat it and the second I unwrapped it I could tell something was wrong.

I usually am very picky about the tripas meat too, and found myself almost puking from disgust from the stale and over-salted meat; there was no beans or rice... Nothing I've ever had in a burrito but this cheesy mess and over cooked meat. 
My boyfriend opened his meal and found a weird minty green sauce over the fries.

Sure, it would be nice if there was a better selection of sauces, but that's ok, we can't have it all. 

Ordered al pastor and chicken tacos and I'm so glad I did. Got some veggies grilled up at the same time and the food couldn't have tasted better. Only downside is that they didn't put pineapple on the pastor. I guess you have to ask? I didn't know until I got home, so next time for sure I'll request it.

1057524,2013-04-16,6,2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg,"Hands down these guys have the best al pastor taco I've eaten in Las Vegas. We can quibble about texture, moisture, seasonings, and toppings, but I cannot believe that anyone is doing it better than Taco Tijuana.

They've been open for about a week and today was the first chance I go to stop in and see what Taco Tijuana (TT) is all about. When you walk in things are a bit confusing. There was only one other family when we arrived, but we had a time trying to figure out where to go to order. 

That is not a negative.  Just an observation. What seemed a bit confusing to me, could easily be a specific method for keeping the taco ordering flow moving smoothly when they get busy. 

A sweet employee can to our aide and chatted with us while we were deciding and ordering. Like many places they have a few different stations. The gentleman at the pastor station offered us a sample and I stayed there and ordered the rest of my meal. 

Can we have a moment of silence for the al pastor? The tortillas are homemade and soft from oil and heat if the grill. The meat itself was succulent and delightfully seasoned (ancho chilies? cumin?) and had a bit of char still on the edges. If you haven't had an al pastor taco, it's a distant cousin to to Lebanese shwarma--both use the vertical spit.  The Mexican version consists of pork cooked with pineapple to bring out the sweetness in the meat. At TT they top the taco with a dab if salsa and some light green sauce. Was it a thin guacamole? I honestly don't know. It had a hint of cilantro and chile. But with the ingredients combined, that taco hit every note.  It's been a while since I had tacos in Tijuana. But TT has captured the soul that I remember in a small bite. 

The suadero taco was well prepared. It's a tougher piece of meat, but you wouldn't know it from the taco at TT. Their meat was moist and very tender. It lacked a bit of flavor (which the meat generally has), but TT wisely adds a different topping to this taco. They added a thinner, spicier salsa atop the suadero. It was a lovely bite.

The asada taco was not extraordinary, but it was nice enough.The meat was nicely seasoned and it was topped with a simple, fresh salsa. 

The staff was kind and added extra meat (without us asking) to a skimpy looking taco. In addition, they gave us roasted peppers and onions for free. I don't expect that to last long. 

In short, this place was delicious. I cannot wait to go back.",2k8OVAPxlXHsA5X6EIoQpQ,11,9,5,SDz35HQEXusWfaqaY_elvg

Like I said, the asada is my preference here at Taco TJ. The suadero is nice and spicy, the al pastor lacked the crispy bits and pineapple I was craving, and the lengua could have been a bit softer. Note that lengua here goes for $2.25. Have yet to try the tripas.

First time here this type of taco was amazing but the second time around the tripa was not crispy so we thought maybe we need to remind them that we would like it crispy, so we ordered a couple more EXTRA crispy we told the gentleman and he confirmed our order.

We kept it simple and ordered the Carne Asada Fries and a Carne Asada Quesadilla. The Carne Asada Fries were about 80% cheese and sour cream, which even when scraped off had almost no flavor. The Quesadilla was very odd to me. For some reason, the bottom of it was a flour tortilla, and on top of the somehow bitter meat was a tiny corn tortilla. I would hardly call that a quesadilla by any standards. We definitely will not be returning to this place since it is a waste of money.",KOSnQ86O-6hyLiYbfLv7qQ,0,0,1,lvEza97r5wY4m_LBV2gMqw

Ok so do you really want me to compare Taco Tijuana and Taco Taco!? Or how about Tacos El Gordo, notice how I still haven't written my review for Tacos El Gordo I'll get to it eventually.

Taco Tijuana setup shop in the former Farm Basket place it is a small place.  I came here one night and well the parking lot was DARK, not well lit at all and hard to see parking lines.  The best lit parking is next to the bus stop.  There's a couple tables and chairs outside to enjoy your tacos on a nice cool night or if you want during those 100+ degree days.  When I came there was another only one other person eating which ended up being an employee.  There were 2 ladies tending the cashier and a handful of guys in the kitchen area.  The guy at the counter was pretty friendly and so was the one cashier that rang me up.  Having already eaten at another taco place earlier I still had room for more and wanted to try something different.  Looked at the menu and asked about 2 items that just looked different to me, I don't speak Spanish so it was pretty easy, just ask for something I've never ordered. I asked about the adobada and he pointed to the layers of pork meat on spit.  My response was ""Oh cool I'll have that."" I'm so confused now I needed to Google it and I'm still confused, all good as long as it taste good.  For my second taco I just asked if they had a shoulder and how it was.  I ended up ordering it.  

So my two orders were Taco De Adobada and Taco De Suadero http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-tijuana-las-vegas?select=2Yf2rbXK2qiaTDXpn4ZjFA#eFPW_eaFgixHKQKHNrkFbA both were very delicious, tender, topped with cilantro, onion, and their own sauce.  No pineapple but I guess you have to ask for it. It also came with some freshly hot of the grill green onions and pepper. After placing my order the cashier rang me up, she asked if I wanted to cup for soda and I said no.  Well she gave me a cup and I paid thinking it was a cup for water.  After looking at the receipt I noticed that I was charged for the soda, I just took the cup proceeded to the drink dispenser.  On my way to the drink dispenser I noticed the condiment area being pretty disappointing so I skipped it.  The drinks varied from your regular soda to Mexican drinks. 

Not going to lie I do prefer these tacos by themselves, the way they were served to me, versus the other new taco spot down the road but as a whole I like the other guys more cause like those AT&T commercials MORE IS BETTER.  Both places make good tacos though and I'd eat at both so it's just a matter of what I feel like eating at the time.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,4,2,4,QxYSWolwOS1IL7_SetOt9Q

2720009,2013-05-14,5,2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg,"Taco Tijuana, you have made me a firm believer that not all El Pastor is created equal. On my first visit I tried the El Pastor, Cabeza, and Lengua tacos. Man the tenderness and flavor of all three meats were good down to the last bite! The El Pastor had tons of flavor and it still had the juices to it. A little greasy but isn't that what gives it its juicy flavor? All their tacos are 2 bucks except for one which is 2.25. I think its either the Cabeza or Lengua. 

Another plus is that they ask you if you want grilled chiles and green onions to go with your tacos. Hell yeah! Why would you say no to such grilled goodness? Also don't forget about asking for a little slice of pineapple to add to your Pastor Tacos. Gives it that little bit of sweet kick to it.

As for their extra fixins, well all they have are cut up limes and sliced radishes. I was hoping they would have more options like onions, cilantro, and salsa along with pickled jalapenos and carrots. Im sure for the salsa you can ask for some on the side. This is probably the only area where they lose the one star because there are other places where you get all these readily accessible.

Service is something worth mentioning. From the moment you walk in you are greeted with a ""Hola! Buenos Tardes/Noches!"" If you just so happen to eat there, they usually come around asking if everything is ok and grab your empty tray of garbage to put away if you are done. These little things that they do actually go a long way in regards to remembering a pleasant experience.

Some tidbits: From memory I recall them having about 8 booths inside and a couple tables outside, so at really busy times you might not be able to even sit down to eat. Their two bathrooms are singular, meaning you can only have one gal and guy occupying them at one time. For their drinks you have Pepsi products, Tamarindo, Jamaica, Horchata, and Pina. Im wondering why they don't have Orange Bang.

The hours they are open are not quite established yet and its obvious for they don't have anything on their doors to indicate this. For now what they have told me is that they open everyday at 10 am and close at 2 am on Friday and Saturday nights. I recommend that you give them a call before heading out there the other days if you are out and about late so you don't make a wasted trip.

So overall, TT you will win the battle with Arby's next door most days because I do happen to like a roast beef sandwich every now and then. But to most people, El Pastor will beat out roast beef any day and I don't blame them.",0FMte0z-repSVWSJ_BaQTg,11,8,4,yrZLooglWUi1zkAkMEuyBA

After reading on yelp it seemed this place was supposedly decent after reading reviews hoping we wouldn't get the crappy food that some reviews suggested and we would be given some at least decent food at worse well I'll be damned if we didn't spend an incredible amount for 12 tacos (6/carne asada, 4/pork, 2/chicken) freaking $31.00 total. Well I am just disgusted companies get away with serving this quality of food and still can keep the lights on this stuff was absolute garbage the beef that they call carne asada has to be the cheapest grade of meat you can get soooo much fat and grizzle by the time I picked all that waste off I didn't hardly have a pile of meat left in my taco I don't purchase carne asada tacos to be given fat, grizzle, mushy vegetables (idk wth that was I guess it's their salsa another disgusting tasting product), and mushy shells (they were disintegrated to nothing so you couldn't even pick the taco up to eat) the chicken was just about the same plain, grizzle, and fat I didn't even want to try the pork at this point but the pork tacos messed up my wife's stomach so folks please save yourself the trouble and go back your normal place at least you know what you'll get. I am also allergic to beans telling them this you think they would've payed attention a little bit to what they were doing and try not to cross contaminate our food but no that didn't happen some where along the line someone got beans on some of the tacos not a lot but heck it doesn't take much for me to have an allergic reaction! my throat swells cutting off my air supply then I die just because someone was to lazy to care what they were doing. pay attention when people say they have allergies it's not always because they don't like your specific product. The pale skinned guy at the front acted as if we were bothering him by entering the place and wanting to order some food from this place that serves food he's probably in the wrong industry if he doesn't like to deal with people last and final deal about this place was how stingy they were with there hot sauces we purchased 12 remind you we asked for some sauce we were asked how many said a couple of each they only have red or green the light skinned guy said one each I was like wth at least 2 a piece please he made some kind of face and noises and his worker gave us what we asked for but really is the extra hot sauces savings gonna save the place from tanking. After my 1 1/2 asada tacos and the couple bites I had of a chicken I trashed my share of this garbage my wonderful wife went in kitchen and made me the tacos that are in the pictures now those were awesome and tasted like something beware beware beware is all that can be said have a good one",pOlnC4R_mbqoLZZD_vRlrQ,0,0,1,foT3krws_qZjZx9n9Wvbtg

But your charging me these stupid prices because y'all don't have it as an option to get a regular taco.

To give you an image of how it looks like. Imagine a piece of tracing paper soaked in water. They weren't even good.

It's as if before putting the tacos in the plate they let them swim in grease. The grease took the flavor away. Won't be going here anymore. A completely disgrace as far as tacos go.

My brother and I took an Uber from the T-Mobile Arena to come across that our adovada/pastor fries that we ordered, were mainly fries and only fries. The adovada/pastor fries had hardly any meat or the other toppings that are normally added the past few years that I've gone. As soon as I noticed the poor fries after taking several bites, nicely, I immediately took them back to the cashier by the name of Ana. Once I took them back to the cashier, I told her about the situation and she instantly took them back to the cooks to fix it. 

As the cooks appeared to finish my new order of fries, Ana appeared to grab the order as they were all laughing for what ever reason. She walked up to the table that we were sitting at and gave me the order. She sarcastically made sure that I looked at them and made sure I was satisfied. The fries looked perfectly fine to me since they were covered with the salsa. As soon as I got halfway to the bottom I noticed why the employees were all laughing, they had filled my fries with the old, crunchy, greasy bits of meat that fall on to the grill after cutting it. I got up and left, didn't make a deal out of it.

Ever since then, she's wanting to try more and more taco spots with me. Yeah, I know...awesome, right?! Taco Tijuana came up on Talk a while back and we decided to hit it up. It's a small joint located right off Eastern & Trop. I imagine it gets busy in here at times and much like TEG, you might have trouble finding a seat during their peak times. 

I ordered a couple adobada tacos and an asada taco. The asada had great flavor and was spicier than most I've tried, but it was slightly dry. I came here mainly for the adobada though and that's where the money's at. It's a bit greasier then I'm used to but I think that only adds to the overall taco goodness. It is extremely moist and tender, a bit spicier than most and like the asada, these guys really pack some meat on for $2! About the only thing I didn't like about it was the pineapple. I dig the pineapple sweetness with the spicy pork but if you look at the picture, they kinda just slap a big square stick of it on the taco. I prefer the smaller chunks but I'm sure that can be requested. 

They also have really great customer service. Everyone was friendly and the restaurant was organized and clean. The lack of a salsa bar is a bit disappointing but since the tacos were on point, it's not a huge deal.

We got married in Mexico because even though we are Gringos,  we love MEXICAN FOOD like there is no tomorrow! We read the Yelp reviews and couldn't get to Taco Tijuana fast enough.  When we got there,  it was bright and clean.  I guess that's worth the one star minimum you must give.  The picture menu up on the wall to order from looked like everything was pretty much the same dish with a different Spanish word under it.  After several frustrating minutes of trying to figure out what was actually on the menu,  my wife,  who speaks a marginal amount of Spanish tried to speak to the people who take your order at the counter.  Hearing the confusion,  another customer kindly started translating for her to have some basic questions answered.  Questions such as, ""What comes in the burrito you have pictured?""  (Um,  shouldn't it be listed?!) and ""Do you have any cups for water?""  (The answer was No!).  What we did find out was the menu consists of authentic Tijuana tacos.  Now,  I don't know about you,  but now that I think about it,  Tijuana isn't exactly known for being a ritzy destination get-away.  Quite the opposite. Now I understand why they chose to name their restaurant after that specific city.  It is low rent and so are all the meat choices at  Taco Tijuana.  Would you like a tounge taco?  How `bout a pig stomach lining taco?  Would you care for a brain taco or some intestinal  tacos?  They did have a version of Carne Asada,  the flavor was good,  but the meat was clearly the grisly stuff  some other butcher threw away.  There was no pollo/  chicken,  no carnitas  (they had ""pastor""  but  God only knows why it was dyed a pink/red color. It tasted even worse when they gave a sample. ) Basically,  it was odd parts of a cow on your taco---or bust.  We ended up trying to order the safest bet  (the Asada)  but had to spit most of the cartilage laden meat out.  Needless to say,  we will never return.  (As a side note,  even though the employees didn't really speak much/any English,  they were all extremely nice.  But at the end of the day,  if you have nice employees and terrible quality food,  it just doesn't matter.)",pVWdUjBJGt3xoeQUtUA9GA,1,0,1,qGzghmGmkv9_HLgQN5kcCg

We are already looking at the marinated pork on the spit. The young lady immediately gives us a sample of the goods. Probably the most flavorful marinated pork I've had in Vegas and the most greaziest. I wish I had the appetite that day to eat a whole bunch, but I had eaten earlier. My great friend buys me three and they were devoured soon after. 

The place has a simple, but clean setup. A lot of Mexican street fare taco joints are popping up in the valley which is great for the taco head in you. Haha Mikey C!!! It's getting hot, so that brick and mortar and AC is looking very accommodating. Combo that with dem tacos and you got a happy customer. I think the only thing missing is that Orange Bang to set dem tacos off.

Taco Tijuana is one of the best places to purchase Al Pastor tacos in town (located on Tropicana and Topaz), and for about $2 a taco with a friendly staff making them, we are going to be repeat customers whenever we get a taco craving.

Unlike other places, your tacos will be packed with meat and swimming with flavor (I order mine with everything on it). Personally, I squirt a ton of lime juice on mine because I love the taste. The meat in the tacos have great texture variety with some crisp that makes every bite more addicting. 

Refreshment options available for purchase: bottled water, canned soda, and there is a horchata fountain with many flavors available.

They somewhat have a flavor that regular tacos do not have, not even tacos in Mexico.  The tongue taco was ok.  The tongue was just not too flavorful (probably not seasoned enough with salt).  The tripe taco made me disappointed.  The tortilla to this taco was warm because they had just warmed it up but the tripe was kind of cold :( which was sad because these are my favorite tacos.  The color of the lard was white with clearly shows also that the tripe was cold.  My tacos came with grilled onions and peppers.  These were good.

We step up to peruse the menu board, and the other two cooks start offering suggestions!? I'm thinking WOW, what service!? Any time I see an Al pastor/Adobada Carousel, that immediately becomes one taco choice, Don't forget to request it with pineapple! Another favorite of mine is crispity, crunchity tripas, so I request it extra crispy, along with a lengua. Wifey was quite stuffed from our previous stop, so she just got a cheese quesadilla.

The best way I can describe this set up is a condensed set up of El Gordo. They don't have a salsa bar, just limes and radishes but I'm sure they can hook you up with salsa upon request. The grilled chiles and scallions are complimentary which goes well with the tacos, and they're pretty generous with the meats here. The Lengua was topped with a salsa verde which was very soft, tender, and tasty. The Adobada was very flavorful and is way better than Gordo's IMO....The Tripa was served with salsa rojo and so perfectly crispy, that gave me the ""Exorcist Effect""
(You know, where Linda Blair's eyes roll to the back of her head?) that's how great that first bite was, and I was happy to find my new favorite taco de tripa in town!

A small counter place orders, a smaller seperate area for orders of al pastor tacos, and the cashier. A soda fountain and condiment bar are located near the entrance and a small seating area is in the back. When you order the counter person will ask how you want your tacos dressed, grilled onions and peppers are also ordered from the counter.

On my visit, I tried the al pastor, lengua, cabeza, and tripas. The al pastor was a little disappointing, even though I asked for everything on it, I could not find any pineapple. The lengua and cabeza were both very tender, but the best of the bunch would have to be the tripas! It kind of surprised me to find this out. The tripas is washed very well, so there is no earthy, grassy flavor to it and there is a light smokiness to it. Also, the tripas was not chewy at all.

=Food=
I only came here once as I wasn't all that thrilled with what I had gotten. Not sure if it's just me or the food was off that day. I had gotten a small order of Carna Asada fries and my guest got the Quesadilla with Carna Asada meat. The meat was drier than I'm used to and didn't have much flavor. Fries were crispy, but no salt was added to them. Also, the guacamole didn't taste fresh. This cost me around $7 and it was more than enough for me and my guest to share.

My guest's quesadilla was stuffed full with the Asada meat but didn't have much cheese in it. They weren't thrilled with their food either as it was filled with too much meat and the meat was dry and had no flavor to it. Cost $6.

Another disappointing thing about this place was that they didn't have a salsa bar. I always get extra for my food. If I had been able to have some salsa, it might have been able to add more flavor to my food and made it not seem so plain. 

=Customer Service=
The people that work here are very friendly. Although they don't speak very clear English, they try their best to communicate with their customers to make sure their orders are correct. Also, the person at the register is also very nice and had a smile on her face when I paid for my food.

4106817,2015-02-04,2,2XkVexeY_8zyc9nriSElQg,"After passing by and passing over this place dozens of times, I finally was drawn here by a special event. Thank goodness.

Located at Tropicana and Topaz, Taco Tijuana is almost in the shadow of Taco y Taco. Arby's is the only other notable business in the plaza, which is accessible from westbound Tropicana or Topaz. I was surprised that they were already doing brisk business when I stepped in not long after 11am.

The ordering system is more practical than TyT and Tacos El Gordo. You pay for your tacos (or burritos, vampiros, etc.) at the register in the corner and take your slip to the cooks, where you can express your preferences (no jalape√±o for me) and ask for semi-grilled onions (some raw parts still) and roasted peppers. Sliced radishes and limes, but no salsa bar, are on the side near the beverage dispensers. Prices are still $2 for most tacos (cheaper than TyT) and $2.25 for lengua, but for their ""Taco Madness"" event, they were just $1 (except for lengua, and they happened to be out of sesos).

I wanted to eat everything, so I tried the lengua anyway. It was a little spicier than everything else, but it was delicious. Suadero was up next, and while the tomato salsa was nice, the beef was a little too tough for my taste. Stick to Tacos El Gordo for suadero. I had to taste the al pastor (aka adobada) at that point, and while I forgot to ask about getting pineapple, it was still delicious with some crispy bites and balanced saltiness. I actually went back and tried it with pineapple, and it didn't change my opinion about it too much.

I finally arrived at the tripas, ordered extra crispy a la Nelson. Great crunch, a little chewy intestinal flavor in the middle. Next, the asada was delicious, with just one tortilla (that's apparently a normal thing for this specific meat), guacamole and a great char from the grill. Buche was in the same tomato salsa as the suadero, and while it wasn't too chewy, the flavor wasn't especially distinctive. Cabeza was last, and it was as delicious as any that I've had even though it didn't have the fatty bits that I'd hoped for. It has the same spicier green salsa as the lengua, but my taste buds were a little numb by this point.

Not only was the ordering system easy and the food delicious, but the employees were really nice. The cashier offered to bring my food to my table, and one of the cooks wrapped my leftovers in foil and even threw in more onions. I could see myself eating everything again except the suadero, and I'll probably return here for my next taco fix.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,6,3,5,Tmm7I8-eFM2j27w3JC16BQ

I came here with a measly $5 restaurant.com coupon, in order to be redeemed one had to purchase $7.50 worth of food, which shouldn't be a problem because each taco here costs $2+. 

The girl ringing me up got her (what I assume to be) boss/owner/whatever on the phone and although I can only pick up a few words of Spanish here and there I knew what was going down. After much consternation on her part (and by the cook) they decided they would not honor my coupon. Why? Because, and I quote, ""They've been taking money from us."". Whom? Restaurant.com? Well yes, I would assume so because they probably get a cut. I pointed out there's no expiry date, but they were not impressed. I've never had this happen to me before with a Restaurant.com coupon, but I've assumed it could happen.

Here's the thing though, I've had Restaurant.com coupons expire before. The website alerts you to the fact the owner has stopped accepting the coupons and allows you to exchange your coupon for another. Obviously Taco Tijuana just decided to stop honoring the coupons without telling Restaurant.com, which, in my mind is very bad form. Especially for those that had already purchased the coupon with intention to buy eventually. If it expires, or you don't want people coming in to use it - than just say so, don't leave people out in the lurch.

Also - here's another issue, if you have a customer that has a coupon from a reliable source, with no expiry date, shouldn't you just honor the coupon in order to keep a customer and save face? I would. In fact, I know a lot of very good establishments that would. Especially when the price you would be eating was only $10.95 (minus $5) which bring us to a whopping $5.95 they would have had to just let go in order to honor my non-expired coupon. 

That being said what I ordered and subsequently paid full price for, even though all I really wanted to do was ditch my order and go down the street to Taco y Taco.

2 Adobada Tacos
2 Lengua Tacos
1 ""Especial"" Quesadilla
1 Orange Jarittos

The adobada tacos were good, but definitely could have used more meat. Spices were on point, but way too much freaking cilantro and onions. Lengua was okay. I've never had it before, so I'd be interested to see what it's like somewhere else before I make my final call on if I actually enjoy eating cow tongue tacos.

The especial quesadilla was disappointing. Hardly any cheese at all, and mostly meat. I asked for carne asada in it. The carne asada was really spicy - like everything here. You do not really need any salsas with these tacos because they are pre-seasoned to the spicy side.

There is no salsa bar. They grill up onions/peppers for you and you get that with your order

Eric R. ordered a mula with flour tortillas and suadero, and a cabeza taco.  The mula is like a tortilla sandwich with cheese and meat, so a deconstructed quesadilla of sorts, and comes with choice or corn or flour tortillas.

I ordered a lengua taco and a lengua sope.  The sope is like a corn cake that is stuffed with the meat, and here topped with a crispy corn chip.  The chef insisted we take an adobado taco con pina on the house, which was very nice but he did that only after I told him I do not eat pork.  Eric R. ate it.

There are radishes and limes but no salsa bar.  The lengua was delicious.  I have a hard time disliking any lengua taco in general, and this was very tasty.  The sope was great too - for me it was a fork-and-knife situation because it was very thick but too wide to lift up and bite.  Eric R. enjoyed his cabeza (""tastes like suadero"" he said) and his mula.  He was so full but ate the adobada too.

We were only there for like 15 minutes but we smelled like burnt meat the rest of the day.  It was in my hair and my clothes, and same with my hubs - it was like we went to a local casino and smelled like smoke in a way.  Because of this affliction and the lack of a salsa bar, I knocked off a star.  Good food and great service, so enjoy!",T5KBc5QbwZ-Oj9ApE4vZJA,8,5,3,xVv0ZiZPPaI-_MRnzENzWw

Taco Tijuana doesn't have the usual salsa bar that most taco joints have, but they make the tacos with specific toppings, rather than just the onion/cilantro topping.  I loved this, I was more than happy to trust them with how to dress the tacos.  The carne was a little lacking in flavor for my tastes, but that doesn't mean I didn't care for it.

I like to think I know tacos. Tacos Tijuana does a variety of Mexican foods well but their tacos and steak fries are truly tough to beat anywhere. I always go for a steak taco, plus either a carnitas or a delicious pastor and then split a steak fries with my wife.

The avocado cream sauce that they put on their steak fries is the best I've ever had anywhere, it's amazing. 

I imagine based on how wonderful their steak fries are that they also make a mean California burrito.

The lines are never long, the location feels slightly unsafe- but such is the case with all of Vegas's best fast eats spots. The danger is well rewarded.

The service was quick and we got our food pretty fast.  I liked the condiment bar because there was a LOT of ice and the pickles seemed totally house made (they use clove! depth of flavor is on point) and had great flavor (even if the jalapeno was too spicy for me to eat).

They also have pretty good horchata, jamaica and tamarindo. I like to ask for cheese on my taco, but it comes automatically with salsa, onions and cilantro. Also, they don't charge extra for guacamole!",hPv5xh4cETVINMduWfLFVQ,1,0,5,ABq4-LQt4EOze7i-3J7FQA

Everything else was a fail. Asada meat was not good in tacos or fries. Service from the staff is not welcoming or helpful. You literally have to ask for everything. My sister ordered a glass bottle coke & the cashier gave it to her without offering to open it or showing her where a bottle opener is located. You know taco spots are supposed to give you cebollas asada, chiles, & pineapple. They didn't offer it to us so we asked & they were quite stingy. I ordered an elote as well. No chile powder & they use Valentina. Bathrooms were not clean. Overall, it's not terrible but there's definitely better tacos spots in town.",eZrS8SeTgX4c7ir3G1-8VQ,1,0,2,hidJ1xbRUVq20KqPkAdcUA
