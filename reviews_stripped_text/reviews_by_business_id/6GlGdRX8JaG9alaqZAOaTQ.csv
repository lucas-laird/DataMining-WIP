1293864,2013-08-10,0,6GlGdRX8JaG9alaqZAOaTQ,Go somewhere else. Long wait at the drive thru. After they take your order. They make you pull up and make you wait for a long time for your order.  Like I said. Go somewhere else.,D91w6vl4dAGcYmgIBWr7lw,0,0,1,6KBYnmTyYyQGjUW-0MBADA

I can not tell you how nice it is to have someone greet you. Vegas is not known for this.",esUYubJPnyFhjcrxsef2fg,1,1,5,aus9X1FibeXbR54XqmPqhA
2185709,2014-08-22,0,6GlGdRX8JaG9alaqZAOaTQ,"Ah curly fries, I've loved you since I was about  10yrs old. Hot fresh seasoned curly potatoes, such perfection. And now let's add the hot cheddar cup of cheese to dip them in!!! And that's just one of their sides potato cakes, mozzarella sticks, they also have onion rings, but I've never had them.
As for the sandwiches the hubby always gets the french dip (pretty good choice) sometimes he'll surprise me and go with the beef n cheddar. I love the onion roll it comes on.
Overall even the chicken cordon bleu is also very tasty.
I think of Arby's as the upper level of fast food. If you have enough room in your belly try a turnover! 
Maybe I'll have to try a mega meat stack next visit.",_MYAzzeHgA7BtyG66AIF6A,0,0,4,luBGFmgFRpIH3PcxivUHig

I had the buffalo chicken sliders and natural fries with a chocolate shake, my wife had the French dip.

2245384,2012-07-09,0,6GlGdRX8JaG9alaqZAOaTQ,"Your basic run of the mill Arby's nothing really stood out for me. The service was good, the food was hot and delicious. I wasn't disappointed, just wasn't wow'd by any aspect. 

Pros: Close to my home, good service, food was hot and fresh. 

can't say anything for the interior of the restaurant as I went through the drive through.

It was nice inside, oddly a small portable boom box was on the counter for music. 

Ordered food with ease, there was some issues. But hey it's fast food.",vT1Nhxx-dci5Q05YEbxWPw,0,0,5,IJYRCynL3vbaSVIewUxMVQ
