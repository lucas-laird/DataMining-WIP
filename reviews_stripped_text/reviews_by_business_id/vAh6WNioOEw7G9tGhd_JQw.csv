For 2 adults and 1 kid, we ordered:
- salt and pepper pork chops... very very good, it is dry not too oily, has the perfect spice and crispiness even my daughter likes this a lot. The best salt and pepper pork chops i've ever had.
- honey walnut shrimp.. very good also, generous portion with generous walnut
- sea bass with tofu claypot... very good, not too salty, just the right amount of spice and very tender.

overall, we were happy with our food and plan to go back here again if we visit Vegas.",_3hGfxXkeYr9n2ngqCno6w,11,4,5,GxHxLtvn9gQRvc5z-iqL0Q

The food was really good, but when it came time to pay the check, all of us chipped in cash to cover the bill with a 25 percent tip.   The bus boy picked up our check.  A little while later our waiter came to bring us change.  We had $2.00 on his tray.  We were all surprised, as we had carefully counted the money to assure that there was a sufficient gratuity.  The waiter put the tray on the table and very rudely said, ""no tip.""  We assured him that we had put a $30.00 tip.  He stood there insolently waiting for us to make up the difference.  It was awkward, embarrassing and very unpleasant.  None of us has ever gone there again, and I would urge you not to go there either.  If you must, be sure and pay with a credit card as they have thieves in their employ.",fuqlhEv6x4Ko845ZLqxFYQ,1,1,1,25r7bbXd6U6JvNflZk9UYg

I was with a group of six so when the bill was brought to the table we added a 20% tip and divided by six.  We each contributed the appropriate amount in cash and triple checked for accuracy.  The busboy came and took the tray with the $168 in cash.  Shortly afterward our waiter returned to the table and slammed the tray down, accusing use of not leaving him a tip. His voice was was so loud patrons at surrounding tables turned to view the scene.  When we explained we had left him a substantial tip he all but called us liers.  No matter how we explained what we thought had happened,  the waiter refused to believe us and continued treating us rudely.  One member of our group was so embarrassed over the incident,  he left an additional $25.

Many locals refer to this place as THE Best Place for Chinese Food.  I was introduced to this place over 10 years ago when i first came to visit.  It was good then, and it's hella grub now.  yeah, the name is weird.  when i first heard that i was going there, i was saying, ""food express!!!....sounds like chinese take-out or cheap fast-food.""  oh man, i spoke too soon.  the salt-pepper crab, salt-pepper pork chop, house pan fried noodle, and crispy green beans in XO sauce were all so delicious.  i just recently had the steamed chilean sea bass in black bean sauce.  that thing was so buttery!!!  i also had some of the salt-pepper shrimp w/skin and head w/jalapenos.  and finally, i loved the deep fried tofu b/c it was so warm and silky in the middle and crunchy on the outside.  i just love dipping it in the accompanying mixture of soy sauce and hot chili oil.  
also, the place does not look all too spectacular.  it is small.  it is in front of the Fantastik Swap Meet, but hell it the most yummy chinese food in VEGAS!!!",Zr4N9sG31fybEa-l3a_46Q,2,2,4,EJFjPf4UNWXoZ0Ln1Z5zZA

When I arrived, the place was packed with Asians spinning their lazy susans around, which is always a good sign of a good hole in the wall chinese restaurant. The interior had strip mall written all over it from the Casino carpet (probably from Station's Casino) to the cheesy neon fish light fixture, i don't even know what to call it.  
I came here because of the yelp reviews and i was not dissapointed but not wowed. Take into consideration i tried only two dishes, the Mongolian Beef and the Shrimp in black bean sauce. The beef was very delicious, tender, juicy, not over sauced and just the right amount of spice. The Shrimp was standard but i thought they skimped a little on shrimp, all i saw were chunks of bell peppers and onions. The service was good and friendly and i enjoyed my time here. I would give them 3.5 stars and would go back. I did notice a lunch special they had mon-fri for $4.25, looked like a good deal for under $5.00, will try that next time.",DHuiHkIyLKM0AH6himreEQ,0,0,3,9Y15CEuwd6muRPDq1hhADg

They let you roll 3 dices in the end of the meal and if you get the same numbers then the next meal is on them.  Well our first try we didn't get it and the next we did!!!!!  And they REALLY do follow through with what they say and came back with a matched receipt of over 200 bucks for our next meal in which we redeemed before we left Vegas!  I don't think it can get better than that.  they also give some great free dessert, depending on which day, and free ""lion's eye"" fruit.

We ordered food at the same time as drinks. Out came 2 drinks. 11 minutes pass before I have to flag down a waiter to get the 3rd drink (I was ready to go but my husband is more patient)- then one dish comes (orange chicken) but he forgot the white rice, all waiters disappear and had to go to kitchen door to get one of them. He was so confused he went back to kitchen to get the other waiter. White rice comes. We all picked at the order of orange chicken (which was subpar) and 16 minutes later, lomein was brought out.....still missing one dish. By the time we finally were done watching the 3 waiters TRY to figure out WHICH table ordered the house fried rice and they gave it to the wrong table (who sent it back and waiter took to the kitchen), our patience were no longer existent. We called waiter over to kindly tell him, keep the fried rice and give us the check. He tried profusely apologized and wanted to get the rice - no thanks, we're done & we won't be back!

My parents ordered this exotic dish, which my mom claimed was duck intestines in black bean sauce. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. Much to my delight it was a hit. The other hit was the stir fried duw miu sprouts with abalonushrooms. The gravy was very tasty and the sprouts had the hot wok taste. The empress chicken was acceptable, but it seemed more like regular bak jam gai instead of empress chicken (gwei fei gai). The big disappointment was the beef in XO sauce. I could not taste the XO sauce at all and the beef was a pile of thinly sliced cheap meat, not like the tender little cubes of high quality meat used in a really good version of this dish.

This place is definitely HK style, with the fish tanks, spartan decor, and dirty bathrooms. Contrary to HK style, the service was surprisingly good. They were very attentive and changed our plates midway and ran over with napkins when my Dad spilled water. However, the service did taper off near the end and they were busy with the large number of customers rushing in.

The final sting came when we received our bill, which was $64 for the three of us including tip. This is on the high range of what I'd expect to pay for HK style cooking, maybe at a ""high end"" restaurant, without the word express in the name.

Best chinese food in Vegas? Possibly. Compared to what you can get in Sacramento, LA, or SF? Nope.",huUq7cTpNnKbt8kQENu4aQ,2,1,3,10tAsYXJzeg8-tX_cj6TZg

Was told it would be ready in 10 minutes. That's like Jimmy Johns fast.
The drive alone took me nearly 10 minutes because I didn't know where it was- it's easy enough to find though, adjacent to the drive-thru Subway on Decatur. 

Interior of restaurant initially smells like the Subway it's next to- very odd. Service is about what you'd expect from a Chinese restaurant with four large tables of Asian families dining on traditional dishes. That is to say, lackluster service. Somehow I even had to ask for chopsticks. I was a little bummed that they didn't include fortune cookies with my check as they did for dine-in customers. Oh well, it was late (almost 10:30).

Got home and was pleasantly surprised by the packaging; the corners of the shrimp balls' styrofoam box were removed to vent so that the condensation didn't build up and make them mushy. And the crispy pan fried noodle was in a box alone, with the accompanying gravy in a lidded soup cup. Genius!

Plated the noodles and gravy, and BF tore in. It was super, super hot (temperature) despite getting there a little late and making the trek home. Hot and delicious, though I prefer a few more veggies than I got. The shrimp balls though, were legit. Small and crispy and shrimpy and tasty, with a cup of that pinkish red sauce that wasn't too ketchuppy but just right.

Food Express kills most places in China town when it comes to the quality and taste of their food. Every item we ordered was so fresh and full of flavor. Hell even the mushu appatizer was the best i have had.Then you add in that it's almost half the price of every place in China town. It's a no brainer Food Express best Chinese resteraunt in town hands down. Your doing yourself a true injustice if you haven't been here. O and another thing to add our server was great to which I know this place in the past is known for bad service.

We were hoping for spicy food after we asked our server to make everything spicy.  What we got was very mild food with a few chilis thrown in for color.  Perhaps the most unfortunate thing about this meal was that after I had told our server that I don't eat any meat and confirmed with him that there would be no meat in the dishes we ordered other than the seafood, I found several pieces of chicken in the Singapore Noodles and pork in the Mapo Tofu.

For two years I've searched Vegas for the same authentic Chinese cuisine I are in hong kong and on Guam. I've tried many, liked them, but this is the only one so far that is authentic and tastes EXACTLY like home. 

Yelpers, I tried it based on your reviews and I'm so glad you are all right--this may look like a hole on the wall but it's far from it. The restaurant has nice seating and great staff. I love the fact that the cooks and staff speak Cantonese. It's a sign that the food is genuine. The prices are ridiculously cheap! Walnut shrimp was only 9.95!!! Everywhere else sells for 14 and up. 

The food:
-jellyfish appetizer: I love cold jellyfish and theirs is awesome. With kimchee seasoning and on top of pickled white radish and onions, it's a great way to start dinner. 

-fried shrimp: light and seasoned well. Served with great sweet and sour sauce. A must try. 

-walnut shrimp: crispy with a nice lemon mayo sauce and sweet, crunchy walnuts with sesame seeds. My favorite dish and they make it right!

-marinated crispy chicken with seasoned salt: OMG. So good. Well seasoned, very crispy skin and lots on the plate. A must have when you come here. The chicken is marinated for a day, at least, because the marination was down to the bone. 

-salt and pepper pork chop: finally made right. Light and crispy, sliced with bone and topped with fried garlic minced up with peppers. It was heaven. 

-egg drop soup: thick, eggy and mushroomy. I loved it. 

Overall this is the only place I will be from now on when I crave Chinese cuisine. It's not out if this world orgasmic, but comforting and very, VERY good. I'm already craving more!",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,10,8,5,rAOX5LogHtbxBw7aiKuCbQ
3043834,2008-03-14,0,vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw,"Hands down, the best Chinese food in Las Vegas, without breaking your wallet unlike places like Jasmine in the Bellagio. This place is a ways off the strip, a pretty expensive cab ride. If I recall correctly it was close to 20 bucks from T.I. 

My family used to have property in LV and whenever we would be in town we would frequent this place a lot. You would expect to that this place would be in Chinatown but its actually off of Spring Mountain and closer to auto-row. And it's next to a Subway so you can't really miss it. 

Service here isn't upscale, its not even close to Vegas. It's more HK than anything else. You sit down, get a pot of tea and that's pretty much it until you order. So when the time comes, what do you order?

From my experience, the best things to get there are:

1. Ginger and Green onion oysters- They lightly fry the oysters first and then wok toss them with ginger, green onions, and their sauce. The oysters come to your table piping hot, steaming and fragrant. One bite and it's almost instant nirvana. Hands down, quite possibly the best oysters in this style that I've ever had. 

2. Dry Beef Chow Fun- Yeah i know it's a common staple everywhere and almost everyone knows what this is and can find it at any Chinese restaurant. But is it ever GOOD? They say that although it may seem simple. this dish takes a master chef who knows what he's doing to make it taste the way it's supposed to taste. By far, this place has the best version I've ever had. It's so aromatic, so flavorful, the balance between the light soy sauce and the marinated beef, the onions and bean sprouts, it's all so perfect. But the best part is literally the time and effort that they take to make this dish. Usually whereever I go, the ho fun noodles come to me either completely brown, smothered by soy sauce, white with a few tinges of brown, or the yin yang effect where one side of the noodles are brown, and the other is white. At this place, you'll find your noodles perfectly golden brown, with a bit of 'crust' on the side. This is where you know they spent that time on it. The extra seconds the chef spent on this dish, tossing it in the wok, results in the edges of the noodles being burnt ever so slightly, thereby giving this dish a characteristic taste you won't find at most places. 

3. Corn sauce Fish- dunno what to call this in English, but basically what it is is batter fried fish filets, smothered in a corn and egg drop sauce. It's so good I can't even describe it. 

4. Garlic and Chilli Eggplant- You can optionally get this with Duck feet, but altogether this plate is awesome. It's tangy, its spicy, its decandent, it's delightful.

Overall, I must say, coming from San Francisco where the Chinese population by far shadows the population in LV, this place has better Chinese food. I'm serious. It's seriously comparable to Hong Kong style. Maybe they imported their chef. Almost everything on the menu is awesome. Forget those high end places like PF Changs or Jasmine. This is the place to go for affordable, authentic, and REAL Chinese food.",ze0lePcoThiDyhEG7fA9tQ,4,0,5,Z5R_0iEPIEfiQn_Hm8gkzA

The prices seem to be in the average for the Chinese food industry here in Vegas.

They have a menu for a quick lunch plate or, you can dine in for Family style dining.

I don't want to judge to harshly but I know my 808 peoples from Hawaii may not like this Americanized version of chinese food.

So, here's what a group of us locals from the islands ordered:

Gau Gee [Potstickers] : umm, obviously it was the frozen brand you can find in the asian section of most grocery stores. Pan Fried.

Salt and Pepper Chicken Wings: definitely the rockstar of our meal - because there were 9 of us, we order 4 portions! :)

Orange Chicken : it was like eating Chicken tenders in Orange Sauce with Orange segments as garnish, very basic and simple presentation.

Mongolian Beef: This was good - definitely give this one a thumbs up.

Hong King Style Short Ribs: Skip this one - nothing like how it's supposed to be, instead you get a breaded version of pork spare ribs drowned in sweet and sour sauce.  Just order the regular sweet and sour pork and save yourself the trouble of having to bite into bones and cartilage.

Deep fried Chicken - Half Order : Just like its name. Needed ketchup...

Pan Fried Noodles [Beef & Seafood] - Both selections were pretty good.

Egg Drop Soup: Egg Drop Soup - 'Nuff Said :)

The waitstaff are friendly and pretty attentive, you do have to request the Chinese Hot mustard and chopsticks, our waiter was smiling and knew we weren't from the states, he stated only people not from the states order those items.

I gave 4 stars because the Family Dining experience was a nice laid back atmosphere, the food portions are adequate, and the look and feel of the restaurant was typical of its kind and clean.

However, I felt the food was pretty average - but for some dishes, not in a positive way.

I would definitely come back for the wings when I have wing cravings, but I think this is and will be, a onetime stop for my O'Hana and I.",HO-OEQgDzGq3fOK5sQP5Lg,22,8,4,csyRxwJO6lfGOO8QXlcDTg

The limited foods I've tried were on the authentic side. I had West Lake Beef Soup, and dry Beef Chow Fun. My friend had S&S Pork. But portion was average despite some reviewers had claimed to be large. I had a lot more elsewhere on the plate for cheaper price.

Talking about the price, it might be the cheapest in town but it's about average in big cities like Sacramento and Portland, OR. It's more than those in LA and its suburbs by $2-3 each. The cheapest main dishes here was $7.97. The seafood items cost $13.95 minimal.

I thought the restaurant was hole-in-the-wall, based on the namesake and reviews. But it's actually more a standard Chinese restaurant. Apparently it was renovated recently according to my friend. The service was OK. The wait staffs tended to ignore things when they were busy. But they were quite attentive and friendly when the crowd had died down.

It was not very well-lit outside the restaurant. The cemented ground was not even. My friend took a fall outside.

I ordered the moo shu pork for an appetizer for the two of us and chicken with green beans for a main course, also to be shared.  The moo shu was brought out in a relatively quick time.  There were four plump pancakes filled with goodness.  It appears that Food Express used the tortilla like wrappers instead of the thinner, traditional pancakes.  The rolls were flavorful but before we even had one eaten, the server was back with our main course.  I hate that so much.

When the chicken arrived, it was not chicken with green beans but chicken with broccoli.  That was a language problem or simply an error on the server's part.  We took the meal.  I wouldn't waste that food for one vegetable.

When we were finished, I asked if there was a dessert menu.  The server mumbled something, pointed to the kitchen, and then left the table.  A few minutes later, he came back with two small bowls of warmed, sweetened red bean soup which was our dessert I guess but he never said anything more.

My wife didn't care for her dessert so I finished two.  I'm glad it was small.

There are many things on the menu I'd love to try but I'm a little gun shy.  I'm not sure I'll be back.  Spring Mountain Road, I think I'll go your direction next time.",PKEzKWv_FktMm2mGPjwd0Q,13,6,3,XbZ4Z17sXpsk1wLyJVFiTA

Despite the fact that I've already had an early dinner, I was craving some salt and pepper pork chops so that was my target all along!  

Well... gotta say that their S&P pork chop was pretty good... but since I'm from LA, I guess I've had similar quality?  But nevertheless it was made pretty tasty.

I wanted to try other dishes so there will most likely be a future review from my next trip...  Thus hopefully increasing the star rating at least one star higher...

If the food is good, you may ask why I gave it a 3 stars?  

To me... if a customer gives you a bill to break for your bill even though it's not much of a change, you should always give back the change and let the customer decide what to do with the rest of the money... well, the guy hands me my food and said thank you....  I was going to give him the tip anyway but I didn't understand why he didn't place it in the tray and let me make that decision.... why does he have to make that decision for me?  Yes... I'm Asian, but I definitely would never do that because the change is still ""not my money until given""  So that irked me quite a bit even if it's a little bit of chump change...

Hopefully my next visit all the food will be fanstastic and that they will actually give me my change back.... if not, I'm gonna once again raise hell on yelp about it for sure!

Their Peking duck was really juicy and the skin was very crispy. Everyone loved that.
We also tried their dried scallop fried rice with egg white....super yummy!
The salt & pepper pork chop was on the greasy side but the taste was good.
Gai lan with Garlic was very tasty...fresh and lots of garlic!
My least favorite was the Mongolian beef....the beef texture was kind of strange and too thick.

Think they WANT to sound crappy to deflect all the traffic they can barely handle? But alas, you can't keep the best Chinese food in LV under wraps, same way you can't keep a brotha down. 

Their XO sauce is top secret and top notch. Anything flavored with it is awesome - such as Green Beans and Prawns. My fav dish remains the Snowfish (Halibut) Tofu Bao (Soup in Ceramic Pot) .. the fish is so tender and lightly crispy on the outside. Salt Pepper Pork Chops are perfectly battered and not too salty. I would not order the market price fish here, a 2-3 pounder will cost you upwards of $60. 

Definitely worth the drive, especially if you're looking for some cheap good grubs after clubbing / gambling. Beats anything you can find on the Strip at 2 a.m.!",_rHwSq8T4T-FbfqgM20ciA,9,4,5,T6momjI39dImjqSzdUg7NA

Our big boss had tried it the week before and wanted us all to go for an office lunch.  A lot of different food was ordered.  Pot stickers, kung pow chicken, sweet and sour pork, cashewnut chicken, sauteed fish and vegetables, shrimp with brocoli, Mongolian beef, chicken chop suey, and chicken wrapped in lettuce.  The soup served to all was a cup of hot and sour soup.  Not my favorite but good nonetheless.  For $4.95 most of us got a plate of fried rice, an egg roll, our entree, and the soup.  Don't forget the pot of green tea.  It was delicious.  I was full for hours after leaving.  That is a big deal for me.  

Most of my co-workers ordered from the lunch menu.  If you focus on that, there is a good selection but nothing when compared to the grand scheme of things.  The rest of the menu is huge.

Open 7 days a week. The filled parking lot ensured a crowd inside- just a few tables. A large menu with the basic Chinese dishes such as Fried Rice, Chow Mein, etc. and exotic dishes like Shark's Fin Soup and Pig Intestines. Since my long absence from this restaurant, another location opened inside the Palace Station casino which I think is related, and closer to my house.

This clear broth soup had shrimp, chicken, pieces of squid, white fish, roasted pork, broccoli, and carrots. My husband added salt. I am watching my salt, though not as so strict as when I was pregnant. I liked it- the seafood was a nice surprise. The broccoli was tender but not mushy.

They also do a sautée of mustard greens with garlic- also delicious. 

Fried Salt and Pepper pork chops is a customer fave. I've recommended this to many customers and they love it as well. 

The salt and pepper shrimp without the shell is a must have appetizer for he seafood lovers. So good I usually have to order 2 orders for my family. We will fight over these. Lol.

4669636,2010-01-20,6,vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw,"This is the probably the best authentic Chinese restaurant in Vegas right now, with probably one of the worst names.

Food: 
Asians love their seafood, so I had to go for the Lobster & Crab with ginger based on Steven's recommendation. It was really good and fresh.  For $25, didn't expect to get the good parts of the crab or lobster, and didn't. I was questioning if the lobster was a big crawl fish, because that lobster was small. I also got the sizzling beef tender. Really delicious. The second time with more people, got to try the beef chow fun, which was really okay, but nothing special. Didn't have the flavorfulness that I'm accustomed to. The pineapple chicken, fried crab, oysters, and lobster in ginger sauce were all stellar and flavorful. Desert was on the house. Soup was on the house as well, if you bring enough people apparently.

Service:
The service here is average, isn't winning any awards but isn't bad either. One of the waiters was helping this family with learning how to use chopsticks. However, this is not without incident free. When we were out of tea, we had the lid raised up to signal we wanted more tea. Didn't get it for a good 10 minutes. When I got a fork, there was a piece of lettuce stuck to my fork that needs scrubbing to come off. Lastly, one of the ladies sitting in the table next to us got gum on her dress from a chair, sucks for her. The wait staff admitted to any mistakes they made have made, which shows some class. But, the service could use some help to prevent this from happening in the first place.

Price: 
This place has a lot of inexpensive items, but you can also splurge out on the seafood where it would get very pricey quickly. The lobster & crab in ginger and onion sauce came out to $25. A group of us also got a live lobster in the same sauce, I would say no more than 2.5lbs, that came out to $88. Holy crap. While we should have asked, that is one pricey lobster. Excluding the incident with the $88 lobster, this place is a great value for what you get, just be sure to ask how much is everything first.

The WTF Name: 
How can a restaurant with the name Food Express be deemed as one of the best, if not the best in Vegas? By having great food! I straight up asked the owner, why the name. He explained that 14 years ago when this place opened (good sign), it was like the hot thing to call a Chinese Restaurant. This idea died like pEoPlE tHiNkInG iT wAs CoOl To TyPe LiKe ThIs and Asian guys wearing baggy pants with bangs long enough to use as nun-chucks. The place lasted through this whole era, and the owner kept the name. He consider changing the name, but claimed that many people know about this place and has already been established. Sure it may attract more new people, but I guess the people that know about this place will keep this place thriving.

Summary:
Great food, if not the best in Vegas for this cuisine, but be careful of the pricey items on the menu. Service is above average for a Chinese Restaurant, but a notch below American ran places. The WTF name is staying, so we just have to deal with it. Yes, this better than Sam Woo in Vegas.",j4oWAVprCdwAjyI3VGATBw,11,5,4,YwngO9teEM0MAkmYgqtIeg

My understanding is that this was THE go to hole in a wall place that was busy from open to close with constant wait back in the day.  Place has had its share of drama over the years apparently.  Now it's a fraction of former glory.

The space/decor shows it's age.  Service is blah.  They really are not that helpful.  

Food wise, place is solid.  Food is tasty.  We ordered roast duck which was moist and flavorful.  Also got salted fish clay pot.  Seemed a little soupy but flavors were good.  And got garlic sautéed green vegetables.  Nicely done too

If you are looking for ambience and service, this will not be place to go to.  But if you want a solid Chinese meal, then it will.  

Not sure where else to get good Chinese in Vegas.  Likely other places off Spring Mountain Road.  Little suspicious of places inside the big casinos. But it makes sense for casinos to cater to Asian clientele",0L6IVyPKeYMstsmGZ8Q4xw,0,0,3,EXHvx0A5Bvfjlh7lgx5PMg

With a black bean and spicy garlic sauce. Teach that fish to look at me....Grrrrr
But in reality. You can order chinese food on the menu. I like things off the menu that only the cool asians know. So my advice - learn some chinese food that's not americanized with sugar and sweetness. And order off the ""cool secret menu"".

The pan fried noodle was sooooo good. Crunch noodle, soft beef and cai lan (Chinese broccoli). The salt/peper pork chop was crunchy on the outside and yet juicy inside. Will definitely come back to this place to try other items later.

A.  Steamed Flounder - Steamed fish is an essential add to any true cantonese meal and this flounder was enjoyable, with the right amount of fish sauce, cilantro and onions to give it a nice taste. Would have been AWESOME if the fish was fresh and not frozen. 

B.  Salt Pepper Pork Chops - Served with fried jalepenos.  I found this to be very good overall, not outstanding but good!

C.  Steamed Pork with Salted Fish - Ah, this is a real tasty dish and I also enjoyed this one

D.  Half Chicken with Green Onion and Ginger - Met my expectations. tender, on the bone meat that is very tasty in a natural way. No overpowering flavors at all.

E.  Beef with Bitter Melon - Mom used to serve this to me all the time and I hated it. I love it now and if a restaurant has this on the menu, you can be assured that it is an authentic place. Here it was very good.

F.  Pea Pod with Garlic - Yep, this is not your Bok Choy or Broccoli. this is Pea Pod sautéed in Garlic and it is kind of like Spinach. 

G.  Oyster Sauce Chinese Broccoli - Had to order this as the kids always love it. This is prepared the way my mom and grandmother prepared it all those years.

The food here is truly authentic, and so I cannot tell you or rate how their fried rice, chow mein, wonton soup, orange chicken or any other normal type of chinese food is. I went right for the down and dirty normal food I had growing up and was not disappointed.

Why the downgrade? 

1. No other Chinese people in the place other than the waiters.
2. Nearly empty for the longest time.
3. Did not automatically serve us the ""soup of the day"" which for some of you may look like dishwater but is actually a very light double boiled pork bone soup with bits of veggies in it that is the best. Real places always serve the soup as a free appetizer.
4.  Took away our soup bowls and only had plates and forks. Hello, if you are having the Half Chicken, the Steamed fish and the Beef with Bitter Melon, all these dishes have a sauce on them that the rice absorbs oh so well and you can only eat rice properly with a bowl and chopstick.... Why set us up with plate and fork. Must be what their normal clientele use? No respectable place makes you ask for the bowl and chopstick....
5.  Prices are a few dollars higher than i would imagine.

4946523,2009-12-29,4,vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw,"Since this is the first listing to pop up when searching for a Chinese restaurant in Vegas, we just HAD to try it out. We went to get take-out to bring to eat with others so I'm basing the service and food on the experience I had from that. First of all, there's nothing 'express' about this place. It's a sit-down restaurant, not a 'scoop food' place. There is also a location inside the Palace Station hotel.

We arrived and the staff were very helpful. We ordered a bunch of dishes and were told to take a seat while they prepared it for us. The man even offered us tea while we waited and then chatted with me in Cantonese. I thought they were extremely friendly (but again, it might be because I spoke their language). Throughout the whole time of waiting for our food, all the staff stopped by to chat with me.

So take into consideration that it was about 20-30 mins from the time the food was cooked to the time it was consumed.....

Beef and broccoli (okay, not my choice) -- was really flavorful, the beef was tender and the broccoli was fresh and not overcooked.

Shrimp fried rice (once again, not my choice) -- not bad for fried rice although as a Chinese, we don't really like only shrimp in our fried rice. We like a bunch of stuff.... but it was good.

Garlic gai lan -- nice garlicky taste -- they didn't skimp on the garlic! 

Salt & Pepper pork chops -- these were very tasty even after sitting in the take out box for 20-30 mins. In fact, these were so popular the people who ordered the shrimp fried rice and beef broccoli ended up eating most of this! *grrrrrrrrrrrrrr*

Braised tofu -- also done very nicely with stalks of choy sum and dried shiitake mushrooms. 

I thought everything was really tasty and wished we had dined in instead. This place is definitely staying on my list of places to return to on subsequent trips when craving Cantonese style Chinese food.

Wasn't too pricey either. For all of that including steamed rice was $40 (tip not included).

I had avoided Food Express because I had read somewhere that the servers could be mean if you didn't speak Chinese, and I go out of my way to avoid mean people. Well, I should have known if I am not reading it on Yelp, it can't be trusted because the servers here were super friendly, and I definitely do not speak Chinese (Hao doesn't count!).

The inside appears to be freshly remodeled, and it is a sit down establishment despite the name suggesting that you should expect to carry out. They have plenty of big, round tables for you and your closest pals.

We ordered from the lunch special menu available from 11am-3pm. Everything is right around $5 and comes with soup, fried rice and an egg roll. Cheap lunch winner! When we went, the soup was an egg corn chowder with a great taste, but it was bit too porridgey. I still ate the whole cup, but in an ideal world, I would prefer a thinner consistency. Alas, Chinese restaurants love their gloopy soups sometimes. 

For the entree, I had chicken and broccoli, as there was not a tofu option on the lunch specials menu. I didn't ask if subbing tofu was a possibility, however. When the dishes hit the table, we were a bit concerned. Based on appearances the food looked a little ""heavy,"" as if their cooking oil was thick or perhaps used too generously, and we had ordered spicy and could see no evidence of spice. However, after a bite, all of our concerns flew out the door. The flavors were quite delicious with heavy garlic and ginger (my faves), and the spice was there! Unlike some Chinese restaurants that use red chili oil or sauce to give their dishes a quick kick, Food Express used lots of sliced jalapenos. They delivered a perfect heat to the dishes. For meat lovers, they are generous on the meat. I was left wishing there had been more broccoli and less chicken, but I realize I am probably in the minority there! 

The egg roll definitely appeared to be homemade, and the fried rice was fine. It had chunks of pork, so be warned vegetarians! I think that pork may show up in unexpected spots. Of course, I would prefer brown rice, but so far I haven't found a true sit down Chinese place in Vegas that serves brown rice, so I don't expect it. 

Fresh ingredients, good flavors, amazing value for lunch, and smiling servers... a place I would take my in-laws: Sorry Spring Mountain Road, but I might have found a lunch mistress.

5390873,2012-05-03,5,vAh6WNioOEw7G9tGhd_JQw,"Tried this place for lunch a few weeks back based on the Yelp reviews, and SOLELY on Yelp reviews as based on principal alone I don't think I'd ever randomly walk into a place called ""Food Express""   Just on a whim I could come up with at least 515,129 better names (list coming soon!), but I digress....

Not sure how others use Yelp but I like to type my address and then find the Highest Rated and ""Best Matches"" within driving distance.   This one kept coming up extremely high on the Best Match list.   Sold.

I then like to find the dishes most people seem to agree on.   Salt and Pepper Pork Chops.   Check.    Called it in and picked it up 15 minutes later.   So far so good.  Upon trying the pork chops, I was slightly underwhelmed.   Perhaps I had too high of expectations?   They were definitely tasty, but I thought they did seem a little greasy/gristly as I was eating them, and they didn't scream ""freshly prepared"" to me based on the lack of warmth.   Did I eat them all anyway?   Shut up.

So yeah, definitely tasty, not quite as impressive as I was hoping I'd find them, and I havent mentioned it yet but the price was a good value for the amount of food I got.

Won't be in any rush to try it again but it also wouldn't take an act of God to make me try it again (hello Applebees)",v3YOx9T4jRSw8XP9Rd9H4g,4,1,3,7qPrjDhWMszoZQ8Y2oNPvA

Yes I ordered takeout because I can't eat alone in public, there I said it. I also ordered the salty fish fried rice. They were both better than I could have ever expected. The batter on the pork was crispy and savory. They were spiced perfectly. The salty fish fried rice was completely new to me so I ordered it based on the reviews. I am a self admitted saltaholic so the salty fish pieces were bits of briny heaven sprinkled throughout the rice. 

The portions were very generous. The fried rice fed me three times and the pork twice.  I will definitely be back and order the exact same thing as last time!",erJ1HQwavgZx4996SMIxrA,9,6,4,Pg2MaVfx1eYWLv62n5M7Yw

I've been to almost every chinese food place in china town but, this place is worth driving a little extra. When we visited, a friend of my dads had paid for and ordered the nights meal and it was so delicious. The Peking duck was everyone's favorite because it was so flavorful and beautifully crafted and presented. I also enjoyed the duck wraps as well. They had a lamb stew and I'm not a fan of lamb at all but, the chef seasoned it to perfection and I liked it. They're also very clean as the dishes didn't have the normal piece of food from a previous meal like most chinese restaurants in China town. Our waiter was very friendly too and he constantly checked on us. Overall I just love this place and hope to return soon.

the soup at the beginning is piece of corn in corn syrup essentially. not even swallowable without alone edible

next came the entries, chicken and broc and kung pow chicken. the kung pow chicken actually wasnt bad, it wasnt good, but it was ok. the chicken and broc however... the sauce was wayyyy to gingery, the broc was way undercooked and hard, and i had pieces of raw chicken.... 

on top of that.... in there ""seafood tank"" 3 were empty and 1 had all dead prawns in it.... gross....  (atleast 7)

absolutely vile. 
only reason its getting a 2 instead of a one is because the spring rolls were decent and the kung pow chicken was ""ok""",7jrhS2KtnpBfewdn1mNFzw,1,1,2,NFkcR2M0cUOR8o2wa7Tcmg

My parents don't usually order from the menu, but this place can make what you want - if you don't see it on the menu, just ask.  The worst thing they can say is no.

This place is actually a full-service Chinese sit-down restaurant. They even have the tanks of live seafood. I grabbed some takeout to take back to my hotel.  It was ready very quickly and it was pretty inexpensive.  I ordered 5 items and it was about $40.  The portions were also huge.  They threw in about 5 lbs of steamed rice for free.  

The fried pork chops were amazing.  I couldn't eat them fast enough.  They were perfectly crispy and not greasy at all.

The combo fried rice was very good and full of flavor.

The mabo tofu was tasty with a spicy kick.  It wasn't overly oily.

The pork chow mein was very good as well.  The portion was very large and there was plenty of pork. 

The mongolian beef was nice and spicy and had a very good, bold flavor.

I really enjoyed the food here.  The staff was nice and helpful.  The portions were large and the prices were great.  Each item was around $8 and I the portion was large enough to fill one of those large styrofoam take-out boxes.
