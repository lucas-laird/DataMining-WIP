We haven't been to the party for a couple of years but this was a complete joke. NO IRISH FOOD, NO IRISH MUSIC, and Green Coors or Bud ???? They had food trucks serving hamburgers, and rented booths selling overpriced garbage. We paid $10 each for cover and paid $7 for draft beer?? Then we got ripped off for $40 for three burgers and fries from the food truck?? It used to be THEIR food and it used to be cool.
 Now for the music. I have no idea who thought this up? Some guy on stage attempting to be a one man band trying to do mixed up covers of Eminem and other rap/ R&B radio crap... They used to have an excellent band that rocked! 
  Not sure who put this together, but the only thing Irish about this party was the green clothes. 
  Next year we will find a pub that is actually an IRISH pub... Good luck",U_Knj23UeFPr0nPRDfCM5Q,4,1,1,ruWxv6twDiz7g4yLWi3Nuw

339567,2014-01-02,1,LJt-NO2FhvQxTmBoaaLhTg,"I rarely write reviews, however, our experience here was so unpleasant that I wanted to share it with potential customers. 

My experience on day shifts has been okay, although I agree with Brent V. that the service has been slow, and ""uncaring"". However, the other evening my wife and a family friend went in to get a late night bite on the Graveyard shift. The main area is smoky to the point of causing nausea, and we went into the ""sealed"" dining room. My wife and her friend went up to the Bartender, Dan, to ask if it would be okay if we ate in the dining area; we'd be willing to pick up the food at the bar. I waited in the dining area. 

What I overheard was possibly the most insulting bit of customer service that I have ever experienced. After my wife asked if we could eat in the dining area, Dan said, ""You two are in the wrong place, you need to leave!"" After he reiterated his feeling that the women had no business in the establishment (this conversation took less than 30 seconds), I decided I would go see what was going on. I asked Dan, ""What is going on?"", to which he said, ""Are you with those two girls?"". I said, ""Yes"" and Dan said, ""You need to leave, you're 86'd"". 

I was flabbergasted! I assured Dan that I would be making my displeasure known, and he said, ""Good luck with that"".

Ordinarily, I would approach the owner about this type of behavior, however, short of terminating Dan, there isn't anything that ""The Wives"" could do to assuage my displeasure. Maybe he feels because he had a decent sized crowd around the video poker bar (I'm sure due to his charming personality) that he is untouchable. I don't know. All I know is that until the day comes that I hear, or receive an email that Dan has been summarily terminated I will not return to that establishment, and I will tell everybody I know about my experience with him.",1dC4PyxAIC6cAuO6jpLZ-w,14,1,1,Jf5IN6vy_k4qdc4YYLDJnA

That's where the positives stop.  After a pretty long wait, the server comes to our table saying, ""I have good news and bad news.  The good news is that your order is ready.  The bad news is that we are out of baked potatoes and it will be over an hour until they're ready.""  This is an ""Irish"" pub.  I'm thinking that 6:15 on a Friday evening would be a good time to expect a higher demand for baked potatoes.  

About ten minutes later, our previously ready and nothing more than warm meal arrived.  The ribs seemed oven-cooked with barbeque sauce poured on just prior to serving.  The vegetables were bland. The chicken was white meat.  When I mentioned this, the server said, ""I asked for dark.""  No offer to replace it with the correct item.  It was dry and chewy, so I left it unbeaten.  

When she brought our check, it had an 18% gratuity already figured into the total.  We are good tippers for good service always figuring it based on the value not the reduced amount when using a coupon. IT is pretty presumptuous to have a tip amount selected and added into the total on the bill.

The chips/salsa came with nacho cheese and home made salsa. The salsa was average and the cheese tasted like a true nacho cheese.

The Grilled Greek came with pita bread, gyro meat, tomatoes, cucumber, artichoke hearts, feta cheese, and tzatziki sauce. The pita bread was soft and warm. The rest of the items were about average in taste.

I'm sure they have better items on the menu but the service needs to improve.",UBnmI0Ee3wPF2SmDCVKk8w,1,0,2,ob2L4HaE9lx9wkyP2lMUEA

We sat in the back dining area, and my only complaint is that it was super dark. It was hard to read the menu, and we had no luck at all reading the beer list that was sitting on the table. Good thing Miller Lite is a staple at most bars (like it was here), so we didn't have to ask for a rundown of our choices. (I opted for iced tea, but my husband had a couple of drafts.)

My husband had the fish sandwich, which was really good. Lightly battered cod served with cheese, lettuce, and tomato. I liked my sandwich even better. The corned beef and sub slaw is like a lighter version of a reuben. Although I didn't think I'd like this on a sub roll, the bread was great (nice and chewy), and the corned beef was about the best I've ever had. We both got fries, which were fine, and I had a nice crisp pickle, although they left that off my husband's plate.

Service was good, and the prices were fair. And it looks like they have half-price beers and apps for happy hour, which is a bonus.

He told her that she wasn't playing, that the credits were still the  same as it was. I spoke up and said but she has been playing she hasn't been winning or losing staying pretty much equal his reply this is not a casino. I was kinda shocked, never experienced  that in this establishment before. Then while sitting there a friend of mine showed up so I bought her a drink price $9. A little while later she want another one and purchased it it was only $7. So she question him (same bartender) he said that the bartenders really don't know the prices and a double is $9 in a single a $7. Nobody ordered a double. He may think that we are stupid but we are in the industry.  I would have to say about 80% of the population here in Vegas work in the industry, I know when you punch it in the computer the price is there, so you don't need to be idiot to know the price.

Service is HORRIBLE

My friend and I intended on going to the bar to get a drink then find a table and order some food. Many of you have done it before, go to the bar, get your drink on, go find some place to lounge. 

WE WERE DENIED SERVICE because we weren't playing the video slot machines. We sat for 20 minutes getting stupid looks from the bartenders and rude remarks.

We put money into the machines and were later told that it's not enough to rate service. There's no sign that says there is a minimum amount to be spent to quality as 'playing'. What if that's just my system? What if i put small amounts in at a time because that's my play style? I put a few bucks in and play a few hands and apparently because Jackson didn't go into the machine i'm not really 'playing'. BULL SHIT

How would you like to be corrected? A bartender walks by and rudely says 'cant sit there' or someone coming up and saying, excuse me fellas these seats are reserved for individuals who wish to use the gaming machines, i can get you a drink but we're going to have to relocate you elsewhere. 

I flagged down a bartender and three of them came up and said we were being rude. Seriously, is this how you treat PAYING customers? What kind of establishment treats their customers like shit? There are MUCH BETTER ways to address customers. 

If it was one person behind the bar giving us a hard time because of a bad day i can understand that. NOT THE WHOLE STAFF.

And of course, the bar has built-in gaming for those who feel so inclined.

Service was okay- our waitress was friendly and checked in on us regularly, seemed to be the only one working a dinner rush on a Thursday which was a bit odd. There was another guy running around clearing tables and greeting people who seemed a little overwhelmed or distracted, and didn't follow up after bringing us our first drinks, but the majority of our service was provided by the waitress- I think her name was Kandi?

Had a BOGO coupon for dinner entrees from a local publication.
I went for the grilled chopped and topped greek salad- plentiful portion, surprisingly good pita for a bar, lots of fresh veggies, and  waitress was happy to give me both the greek feta and the bleu cheese dressings on the side to pick and choose which one went best. Only criticism is that there was very little meat on the salad, portion was more similar to bacon topping on a salad rather than a main protein for an entrée.
BF opted for the corned beef and cabbage plate, which was also a giant portion, and again, better quality than expected. Sides were a side salad (also fresh), and mashed potatoes, which were super creamy. I kept stealing bites when he wasn't looking (he saw anyway, but the portion was huge so he didn't mind).

Overall this is a place I would return to- but only armed with another BOGO coupon. While quality is better than expected for bar food, prices are considerably higher too. Not a place I expect to drop $50 for dinner for two and two drinks.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,0,1,3,9w0YRRI_w_hFrBfraYLQPg

However, every once in awhile, there are some patrons that come there that are screaming and yelling and partying in a bar that is more of a chill place.  They have a great St Patty's Day celebration and know how to throw a party, but they also know how to have the cool, lounge type of bar atmosphere which I like.

I usually go in there on Sundays and its a great place to hang with friends, eat some good grub and have a beer.  I go there to do homework since I need the white noise to make me concentrate and its great.  Lots of TVs, video poker, a few arcade games and the staff is super friendly.

Seriously, if you don't fit this criteria, you will be ignored by the steriod infused bartenders.  This is a serious flaw and the owner needs to take a hard look at it.  There are fairly heavy gamblers like myself that will be completely turned off by the non-existent customer service.  There's one more criteria that will get you a drink, if you're a female employee.  For example, I was at the bar, gambling the max amount every hit.  Both wannabe jock bartenders looked at my empty beer at least three times each as they checked in with the female employee three seats down on every pass.  I don't even think she was gambling.  This is outrageous.  I spent a few hundred dollars and had to ask them every time for another beer.  

The other issue is there are virtually no comps for gamblers (unless of course you meet the aforementioned criteria).  You have to go out of your way to get a free beer, no free food and I literally only racked up $3 in free machine play after betting the max at a fast rate for over two hours.  

To the owner... your team needs to focus less on comparing MMA stories, less on trying to get in the female employees pants, less on trying to appear like a tough guy, and more on basic customer service.  Never walk by a gambling customer, look at his empty beer and ignore it.  Gamblers are your bread and butter, not showing off that you've doubled your dose of steriods.",wW_gck7poHuNSopTSZ9euA,11,0,1,YRAbnpVq-YwGxYMlb4kiZw

Three Angry Wives Irish Pub caught our eye, just on the name alone. We walked in and it took a few minutes for our eyes to adjust to the dim lit room...which was great. The atmosphere was great.

We forgot about Vegas still allowing smoking in their bars, and there were plenty of smokers and cigar smokers drinking and playing games, but the air system made it very comfortable...in fact, it wasn't really noticeable after a while (great job).

The service was great...very friendly, and energetic. Our server told us it was happy hour and appetizers were 1/2 off. We had to try the chicken nachos...$4.99.  Every head in the place turned as the over-sized mountain of melted mexican munchies were delivered to our table. And the three of us weren't sure if we could finish the foothill-sized plate of flavor...so the back up plan would be to climb them and repel down the other side just to work off the calories.

Even a local diner came over and commented on the huge portion...as she snapped off a picture. They were not only plentiful, but delicious. They should come served with a velvet rope and stanchions to keep the onlookers at bay and crowds of gawkers orderly. A must order!

I can't say enough about the frosty cool beverages, the atmosphere and the service. These nachos will soon be a must-see attraction in Vegas, right up there with the Bellagio Fountains.",Sy6Uwey7gRoH2jaNUzyT4w,3,4,5,G1Sesufbk-M8aGBCoEOBWw

The cigar-smoking, loud-mouthed and despicable Notre Dame football fan who I presume is the owner of this bar was unbelievably inhospitable to me and Misti Y. in the following ways:

1. Blowing plumes of cigar smoke in our general direction when he saw that we weren't cheering for his team, but instead for Michigan in a concurrent game.
2. Changing the channel on the TV directly in front of us from the Michigan-Nebraska game we were watching to the blowout game between Texas A&M and Auburn without warning, care or apology.
3. Demanding that his server turn up the volume of the Notre Dame game to ear-popping levels - no less than 105-110 decibels. ""I am tired of having this conversation with you - turn up the volume!"" we heard him say impatiently to one of the servers.
4. Constantly screaming at the top of his lungs at the TV screen in reaction to every single tackle or positive play while maintaining a distance of no more than 5 feet away from us.

We were literally smoked out, tuned out, drowned out, and screamed out. Never before have we experienced such persecution at a bar.

For the record, this was our 5th visit to Three Angry Wives for food and drink, but our first encounter with the 'owner'. It was certainly our last visit, as it is clear that customers will always take a backseat to the owner's desires. Avoid this bar (especially on College Football Saturdays) and especially if the owner is present.

The pizza, a different reaction...Compare to Taco Bell's 'pizza', this pizza is the same size and is accompanied by a salad; the salad is romaine lettuce, some croutons and a hint of shredded cheese with your choice of dressing (I chose the Caesars salad). The pizza is heavy with cheese, hiding the other ingredients..lotsa marinara sauce with pineapple chunks and cubed, thin sliced breakfast ham.

Went back there last Wednesday, working with the same co-worker and noticed a chicken fried steak sandwich on the menu, so I ordered it. It's served on grilled sourdough, with cheddar cheese, bacon, tomato, lettuce and ranch dressing. It was the bomb, the best sandwich I have had in a long time, and I eat out every work day.

So glad I gave the place a second chance, will go back often, if for no other reason than the chicken fried steak sandwich.

3270180,2015-02-24,0,LJt-NO2FhvQxTmBoaaLhTg,"I have visited this bar on several occasions and have never had horrible service. I usually go in to eat so my review is based on the food and the service. Best places to sit for food:

1. Dining Room (when it is open)
I am not sure when they close it but it's probably some time after dinner. They have booths and tables and it is usually self seating. Occasionally it is too busy so they will take names down and put you on a wait. I have never had to wait longer than 10-15 minutes. 

2. Bar top
I only sit here when the dining room is closed and the bar is relatively empty. (Try not to sit here, especially by video poker machines, especially when it is busy.) I feel I get the best service here when the dining room is closed, but I would never sit here and order food on a busy night, unless I am drinking and/or gambling as well. Since the bartender is readily available it is good service.

3. High top
I don't usually like high tops since I feel it sometimes isn't enough space. Cocktail servers usually take care of this section. I guess on slow nights when there isn't a cocktail server the bartender will take over.


Food is always good. The best appetizers I have had are the spinach dip and the white mussels. The spinach dip is incredibly smooth and delicious, and comes with a side of garlic bread and chips. I usually skip the chips and order double bread, The mussels also come with some sort of garlic bread, which to me is salty, but ends up pairing well with the mussels. Their fries are amazing. Deliciously crispy without being burned. They charge for sides of ranch, but this isn't a dock, it's just a comment. I only know because I love ranch... especially with my fries.

The only complaint I have is that no matter where I sit I feel like I wait an unnecessary amount of time for refills.",-BcXmYLYjOB27JijGkzfLA,4,1,4,KvcC1YFIMndibo5CqDY8lA

So in the event of a zombie apocalypse, feel free to meet me at the Wives while we can have a nice cold pint and wait for everything to blow over.

This dimly lit bar/restaurant adorned with numerous TVs is a great spot to go watch a hockey or football game if you don't mind being around a little bit of cigarette smoke. Some of the cool features this bar boasts include a self-service beer tap system built into a couple of the tables, Golden Tee golf video game, separated bar/restaurant/lounge areas, and a TouchTunes music sound system. If you end up doing a little too much day drinking at the Wives, conveniently located next door is a vitamin shop where I am certain you could try to drunkenly stammer out your request for some hangover prevention goodies.

The bar food here is top-notch. I have had the Reuben sandwich served with fries and a pickle, pretzel bites with cheese and mustard, and the nachos. The Reuben was spot on in terms of quality of corned beef and sauerkraut and portion size on the bread. The pretzel bites are one of those appetizer items you order that you simply can't keep your hands off, and before you know it you are reaching for another bite only to discover you had sadly already eaten the last one! The nachos came with the standard fixin's and were rather mediocre.

The beer selection at the Wives isn't bad at all. I believe they have around 12 beers on tap, plenty of bottled beer, and of course a full bar in terms of liquor for any number of various mixed drinks. The bartenders mixing up these drinks are very attentive, fast, and friendly. I wish the same could be said for the waitresses, as this was sadly the only problem I had with the Wives.",pzMvoRhpuwwC3jHZtZSCeg,5,3,4,jfozZqEAweoXJrPq6unQMA

My first visit didn't go over so well, but it may have something to do with my fear of actually running into 3 pissed off Irish girls at once. But the place is real close by, so it was hard to stay away from.

I have made many visits to three Angry Wives since then, with each time getting better than the last. I wasn't sure I was ready to review it until last week's breakfast.

I had eaten from their menu before, but this was my first foray into the breakfast side. I ordered the hash and eggs. Mmm, mmm, good! The corned beef hash was delicious - and separated from the hash browns, so I could be allowed to choose my level of mixture. 

The eggs were done perfectly and the presentation, with these little wedges of tomato and cucumber were, well, just more than I would have ever expected from a bar.

I have yet to meet anyone here who even sparked of anger, much less the women who provide the bar's namesake - and I'm just fine with that (well, maybe if they come one-at-a-time).

Employees (servers and the woman who eventually seated us) were going all around us, doing things, not one bothered to make eye contact and say they would be right with us.  I've worked as a hostess and I find that really annoying - it only takes a second.  Finally after about 10 minutes, a guy says there's no open tables and there will be a short wait.  That's fine - except there isn't really anywhere to wait that's out of the way.  The bar section was full.  So we had to kind of stand in the doorway and move every time someone wanted/needed to get thru.  The layout of the place is weird.  Also, it was really warm inside.
Anyway, after about another 15 minutes or so (felt like forever), we were finally seated.  The menu is very blah - didn't have the traditional Irish Pub charm we were looking for.  The music was super loud and plain old American radio crap (no Irish music!).  It absolutely stunk of cigars.  
I don't remember exactly what we ordered but pretty sure I had a burger.  All 3 (friend joined us) of us were unimpressed.  The food was just bland and boring.  Again, it was typical American diner/restaurant food, which isn't what we were hoping for going to an Irish Pub.  And it wasn't even good!  We definitely left food behind on our plates and didn't bother to bring home any left overs.
So after all that waiting, the food was crappy.  The service was fine, unremarkable enough that I can't remember even whether we had a man or a woman.  Overall, we definitely won't be coming back any time soon and I won't recommend it to any friends.  There are plenty of other Irish Pubs here that are far better!",p0xGJ_-QMWF8Bp6uCC1j5g,2,0,1,y2VWnDzvggGvyzEIk8XwgQ

Even better during Happy Hour!  Breakfast is always great too!  We've never been disappointed with anything on their menu.  The staff is usually pretty friendly, not always quick, but hey - if you holler, they'll be right over!!

Their breakfast burrito is one of the best ever and is huge, so we usually end up sharing it . . . we also love the crispy shrimp wrap, baja chicken wrap, philly chese steak and their potato skins are great too!  My 8 year old daughter loves the sliders and actually asks for them from time to time! :)  

We don't usually partake in gaming there, but the few times that we have, we've had no problems with our comps -- we've always been comped while playing.  

Nice neighborhood gem -- we love places like this and always try to support the community.

I have introduced my family and friends to the pub and have never had a problem at the Charleston location until of course today. I was at the pub on Friday specifically to ask if one of the football games on Sunday you would be airing was the Raider/Miami game. I was told by both the bar back and server that yes, if I brought my group of people in, we would be able to watch this game. We arrive this morning early and asked that one of the TV's at the bar could be turned to the game and were told that no  - you were only airing four specific games, the Raiders not being one of the four. Then to insult us more, it wasn't good enough that we are paying customers who would be there for well over four hours eating and drinking, we were told that since no one asked the female bartender's permission to watch our game, she could put it on one screen but if someone came in and wanted to play the machine and watch a different game, she would just take it off.


How dare she! REALLY??? Our money isn't good enough to view something we had already been told two days prior that we could watch????


At any rate, I am never coming back to spend money at your pub - nor will my friends or family. You need to have your bartenders get schooled in customer service. I am disgusted by the way we were treated.

4484363,2010-03-27,4,LJt-NO2FhvQxTmBoaaLhTg,"Last Sunday my husband and I went to Three Angry Wives Irish Pub in Summerlin specifically to get a sandwich that was recommended to us. This was the Chicken Cobbler Ciabatta ($9.99)- breaded chicken breast topped with cobbler baked apple slices, dried cranberries, cheddar cheese, lettuce, and honey Dijon sauce - sounds intriguing, doesn't it? I am a fan of the Bobbie sandwich at Capriotti's, which is basically Thanksgiving on a hoagie, so I was looking forward to trying a similar version here. Well, this was the perfect example of how sometimes something can sound good in theory but in reality, or in the hands of the wrong person, becomes a failure. In this case the sandwich was not totally without merit, but left plenty of room for improvement nonetheless. It seems appropriate to make a compliment sandwich for the Chicken Cobbler by pointing out something positive, followed by its problems, and finishing on another high note.

Dear Sandwich,
The ciabatta bread you were served on was fresh and performed it's job well. Unfortunately, you were too sweet and one dimensional. Your apples weren't necessarily a bad choice but the 'cobbler' didn't work for me. Additionally, I would like to see you served with crispy chicken that wasn't fried thirty minutes ago when I placed my order but not delivered until now. I hold this more against the slow kitchen and servers than you, so don't feel too bad. At least your chicken was still juicy. Finally, I'd like to commend you on your choice of plate partner - I very much enjoyed the fries!
Sincerely, Frugal Foodie

In addition to the sandwich, we had a bowl of chicken and dumpling soup ($5.99), which was flavorful but a little too thick. I won't quite compare it to gravy but it was moving in that direction. Ian also had a Bloody Mary that was one of the better he's had in town. The award for top Bloody Mary goes to Hash House, and is the only reason to ever step foot in that restaurant (Hash House exemplifies everything that is wrong with dining in America by encouraging people to eat enough food for a week in one sitting).

As I mentioned in my letter to Sandwich, the kitchen was ridiculously slow and the servers were sweet but not entirely competent. It took ten minutes to order our food and another thirty five to get it out, and this was on a Sunday morning in a Pub. I'd be weary of going back during peak times. My soup wasn't hot when it came out and we overheard the kitchen staff gripe, so I wasn't left with the best taste in my mouth (or maybe that was their spit?). Overall, we walked out of Three Angry Wives as Two Semi-Angry Customers, and will not likely be returning for the mediocre pub food.",RiU99Ze8UEoUutHMl73HIg,5,0,2,MqERaNF8DdtsFrLwRsjVwQ

While digging through my fries, i found a piece of hair underneath the liner of my container. Gross. My fiance got the ""Get Some Burger"" for $11.The burger was supposed to have jalapeños, cheese sauce and shoestring onions. All that came with it was the cheese sauce.

We have returned on several occasions, and sometimes the experience is great. Other times, it is a bit lackluster and reeks of cigar smoke. For optimal eating enjoyment, I recommend sitting in the smoke-free side room or directly at the bar. The middle area receives less than stellar service and the majority of the smoke. Also, if you're a Notre Dame fan, this is definitely a spot for brethren. If you're not, you will want to avoid when the Fighting Irish have a game, as the game definitely takes precedence over anything else that may be happening, including you trying to enjoy dinner. Still, I do think they do bar food well, and they definitely serve an ice cold beer. I appreciate both!",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,14,10,3,tQ1STy0ifgVDTd85wo4Xwg

I ordered one of the chicken sandwiches and it was cooked just alright.  Five hard pieces of iceberg lettuce was a little bit of a turn off, but it was alright.  I felt that the machines were a little stiff but only played a few hundred.  It was packed for the Michigan Ohio state game.

At first glance the crowd is a bit older and mellow for a Friday night. The staff was friendly and not overbearing. We started off with a couple drinks that were nicely poured ;-) I don't consider myself a light weight but 3/4 into my long beach tea I was feeling it! I ordered the southern comfort, which is a heaping pile of deliciously smooth and fluffy mashed potatoes swimming in chicken noodle soup. It was so good! Definitely a comfort food. OH and did I mention the garlic toast!? After my stomach settled and I downed my second Long beach tea I was ready for mashed potato heaven round two. 

We sat away from the bar in the dinning section and they let us hang out at our booth well after they closed the section down. The music was good and I'm sure geared more towards the staff than patrons but that worked perfect for us 20 something girls. Everything was very clean, food looked and tasted great, and drinks were reasonable. I  will definitely be back. Only reason I rated it 4/5 is because I didn't get a chance to experience the bar atmosphere.

Located in the Boca Park shopping center, Three Angry Wives doesn't immediately come to mind as a breakfast choice, but I had a coupon for a buy one get one free entree in my local Entertainment coupon book handy. My husband and I opted to sit in the quiet smoke-free dining section of the restaurant for this visit.

REESE'S FRENCH TOAST ($9.99): Battered in Captain Crunch peanut butter cereal and topped off with melted peanut butter and hot fudge. Tasted as good as it sounds. I was in fat girl heaven. And yup, I slathered on Ms. Butterworth's syrup to top it all off. Talk about a high-calorie meal! Came with 3 pieces of french toast, but I only finished half. I'll ask for the half-order next time. 4.5/5  
 
MAYDAY MUFFIN ($9.99): Sausage, egg, and cheese inside two english muffins with a side of hashbrowns. Husband approved of the breakfast but hashbrowns could've used more flavor. 4/5

SERVICE: Waitress was quiet but efficient. An 18% auto-gratuity is tacked on when using the Entertainment coupon. 

VIBE: A good old-fashioned Irish pub.

Worth a Return Visit?
Breakfast is better than lunch here! Trust me, I know from experience (said in Chris Farley's voice from Billy Madison). The Reese's french toast is calling my name.

I'm not a huge beer fan but the Angry Orchard beer tasted like a hearty apple cider, it was crisp and refreshing without being the least bit bitter. The mushroom sliders weren't part of the happy hour pricing but they were worth every penny. They were served piping hot with the sauteed mushrooms and onions melding perfectly with the cheese and sweet bun. The burger patty was seasoned perfectly for my taste. The Nachos were HUGE. They were quite tasty as well with so many toppings including chili, and marinated jalapenos. We ordered the white steamed mussels (also not on the happy hour menu) and the portion was also generous with several pieces of garlic bread to sop up the delectable broth. The onion rings were okay, nothing special but the cajun mayo sauce that accompanied it was a surprise treat. Service was excellent, however as it got busier in the bar, the drinks started coming out slower. I was also annoyed that a whole family complete with small kids came in and sat close by with a screaming kid.

There is nothing like visiting from Boston and starting my football Sunday with an egg white omelette and sucking it back w a fresh poured Guinness! Patrons are friendly and will even deal with and treat non-Pats fans well.  

Service was excellent and Pricing was reasonable. Uber and taxi service readily available.  The only issue I had was walking out of the bar and having to adjust my eyes to the bright sunlight... but adjusted quickly enough after a huge Pats Win!",yyjc3yGhJvnbwic2uDrKfg,3,2,5,rQ47lCd_QWrJiaTOaGSrmA

Amazing quality for the price. Family owned and a regular spot in Summerlin for many years.,151tXagCBaCJhpZfefhjKA,1,0,5,hrDaOFJXHvreOuBtio4sQg

Anyhow, we picked our spot and a server came right over. We asked for menus, which she promptly brought over. We ordered chicken-fried pork chop and wings with fries, Blue Moon for drinks. Everything was very good. Music was a good mix of alternative rock. We will definitely be back.
PS - The only negative I have is the wood chairs are a little hard on the backside. But the seats were much more comfy at the bar when we moved over after dinner. We were glad our bartender was nice, the other one did look a little pissy. :)",DCAi-GeI94fiDLC3l3acEQ,0,0,4,4ZTW61Ft0ZNak2DsC9cukQ
