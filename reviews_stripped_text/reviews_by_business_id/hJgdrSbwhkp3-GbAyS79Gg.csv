Goes without saying that I obviously never made it in to try the food. If the service is that bad over the phone.... *sigh* enough said.

P.S. Only reason I gave it 1 star is because that's the only way I could post my comment.",_11zBMQe-3xAPMOCZnUzAg,1,0,1,4df-e03k13dCy05P6cIbMg
1761509,2011-11-27,0,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,"I came here after I got an anonymous tip from a fellow Yelper who told me to try out the brisket and ribs.  Since I never turn down unsolicited advice from strangers (I would make a good rape victim), I decided to try it out.  And I'm so glad I did.  I had the 2 meat combo with brisket and ribs and a side of fries (they're not on the menu, but they said they could make it for me) for about $15...it came out to $18 when I threw on a drink and they charged 50 cents for credit/debit.  But no matter...the brisket was delicious, just the right amount of fat and yum.  I found the ribs a little stringy, probably because they were sitting there for a while.  I would definitely recommend coming here for the lunch special (M-F 10am-2pm) and getting the brisket/side/cornbread for $5.99...that seems like a great deal.

The food is comparable to H&H Hick's BBQ Pit Stop in quality, except I guess this place is a little classier...it's located inside of a gas station (come for the gas, stay for the BBQ).",QZDS5x8YE7KWsOBhXmw0Fg,2,2,4,_dpE37cHC3IJNwuuFmBLhw
2682197,2010-07-23,0,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,Went by again and ordered a dinner plate of ribs and got mac and cheese and rice and gravy as my sides.  It was a lot of food.  Ribs were meaty with nice light smoke and tender.  The mac and cheese was really cheesy and good.,qbq4zC9SrZuaQ4-J-wtRuw,4,1,4,3oOlSBp-qDwXJUMbqDI14g

Pit Boss is a great stop on MLK when you're in the mood for some southern fare made by Asians.  Yes--Asians.  I admit that sounds strange, but they can fry up some chicken, catfish and round up ribs like the southern belle next door.  I hate to sound racist, but when you see a couple dozen southerners ordering here on a regular basis, especially on Sunday after church in their neon bright dresses and overlaced hats, you know the food is gonna be good.

I like the fried chicken.  It's salty, crispy, and juicy.  With a side of smothered potatoes (it's semi-mashed potatoes with onions mixed in) and some potato salad, it's a nice meal.  The ribs are tangy and have just enough bite to them, which makes for some good eats.  As for the corn bread, it's not my thing.  I'm not sure if it's supposed to be kind of flaky and dry, but I like mine moist.  

With a menu ranging from Chinese fried rice to fried catfish, this place has everything you need.  Thirsty?  Grab a drink at the gas station side.  Need some Tom's Hot Fries? They have that, too.  

I like this place, and despite the location, it's not scary like others have mentioned.  Then again, I'm a shade of brown.  Maybe that helps my situation.",o68A_3bAJTge-ioGXHdxKA,1,1,4,aNPdXPOZveLB2oNPg_6nJw

Damn, I was scared to walk into this place and order lunch.  As I walk up a homeless black dude asked if he could wash my windows for money.  Grrrrreaaaat!!  I was the sole white girl and wasn't sure I'd make it out alive.  Alas, I ordered, paid at the gas station counter and waited for my grub.  The ribs were effing amazing.  Fall off the bone yumminess.  Candied yams were super yum.  Baked beans were...interesting...but not bad.  The brisket was eh and kinda tough.  There are several more things I'd like to try on the menu though and will be back again (with protection lol).  All in all, a good deal for the price.  $5.99 lunch special gets you your choice of meat, one side and 2 slices of bread or a piece of cornbread.",zbRjeEkON8EXFk_VrcTAiA,1,1,4,VNtmNYD24z6oreIjlt5EsQ
3362458,2012-04-13,3,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,"Something was fishy when we walked in. I didn't see the nice little Korean lady behind the cash register. I didn't see the posters of food all along the back wall.  Certain signs were missing, like the MENU of Pit Boss BBQ. We walk up and ask for the brisket... ""We don't serve brisket here"" was the answer. Is this some sick April fools joke? This twilight zone nightmare starts to become a reality and starts to sink in... The menu says Q's B.B.Q. 

TOO BAD SOOOO SAD :(

Got the b.b.q. chicken. Dry and barely any B.B.Q. sauce on it. The beans and corn bread was good. I didn't come here for beans and corn bread...

Under new management. Not the same. Very dissapointed.  Where did these Koreans go yo!?!

4051489,2011-03-18,11,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,"Hell yea.. this place has everything..  gas, BBQ, and fucking shoes man..

I couldn't believe it.  I had to see the store for myself.
I was told that this spot had the best chicken in waffles in town, so i rallied some of my east side friends to join me on my escapade to the never, ever land.  Scared? Petrified.  

I'm not a big fan of BBQ by all means.  In fact I'll throw a hissy fit when Wendy's brush me off w/ BBQ Sauce for my nuggets, but i can finally say I found a BBQ spot that i'd risk my life for.
Reason being is because their ribs and brisket are the best i ever tasted, ever.  Not too sweet or vinegary with a hint of smokiness, and sauce neither too thick or too running.  The flavor never got old, it's just perfect.  Real southern touch. The meat were not crazy falling off the bones tender, but enough it can be consume easily. No flossing require.

Chicken and Waffles and the Smother Pork Chops were just OK.   Def not something I would order especially since I'm putting my life at stake just being there lol jk..  It is a little hood, but that's the chance ill take for some food for the soul.

Oh and the sides.. how can i forget about the sides? Mac and Cheese, BBQ baked beans (omg!! this is the business), and Rice and Gravy.  You can tell everything is made from scratch and lots of love put in to everything they make except for the Kim Che we came up on because one of my buddy use his Korean speaking tongue to subdue the sweet Korean lady behind the counter.  Yes, Kim Che is comfort food too, and we got some with our soul food, son!! 

Portions are huge, so bring an appetite.  Every orders comes with your choice of sliced bread or cornbread.  Corn bread has been sitting out so don't expect too much there.

Order in the back, grab a fountain drink or your choice of beverage at the store, pay at the cashier, and check out the freshest kicks in town while you wait for your food. 30days layaway available.  Ya 'rly.",pDvDLpD7CiMlIebsDPCRSQ,9,7,5,bnKF6JbrrjsSGCWMHIIgjw
4229017,2016-04-08,3,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,"Not in the greatest part of town. Corner of Vegas and Martin Luther King. Maybe that's what made this food taste even better. The thought of possibly dying or getting mugged just to get pounds of delicious brisket and ribs. Sigh. I have yet to come across any other BBQ joint that is any type of comparison. 

Located inside a gas station where 10 year olds would try to prevent you from walking in as they try to sell you bootleg DVDs and CDs. This gas station would sell knock off sneakers and some amazing fruit punch. 

However, the brisket, ribs, mac & cheese (also best I've ever had) and rice & gravy was insanely good. I would purposely buy pounds of meat everytime I'd venture to this side of town to make the drive worth it. 

The Korean owners recognized me after the 2nd visit as I was probably the only Asian that ever went there. Good times.",bRzr5YuEIncFzG6_vYSwcw,4,4,5,usLG9N7nexrMF1upyJsR6A
4406597,2009-03-29,2,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,"First to Review? I have no idea how. Everytime I have been to this place there is a 30 minute wait & one hell of a line.

It's inside a gas station and they have great $5 lunch specials.

All their sides are really good. The sauce is sweet and the ribs are nicely smoked and meaty.

They participated in the 1st annual BBQ Battle and gave out full meal portions.

Good stuff.",3Vd_ATdvvuVVgn_YCpz8fw,5,4,4,SfG_rYdX2iA2jcByQoTi_g
4783136,2011-07-16,0,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,"This place has some good ribs and fried chicken. The brisket was a bit tough but there was a nice bit of flavor in the meat and sauce. The ribs were the definate star of the menu. The flavor of the Ribs plays off the sauce very well. There was a nice pull but also a good giving point. The chicken was good as well but nothing special, just fried right. the potato side were very tasty too. I would drive all the way there again just for the ribs and to restock my Tom's Hot Fries supply. As far as the environment, I had no problem with it. Does this mean that I am the type of person that causes concern in others? I swear I'm cuddly, just give me a chance.",ssz4_Rj8p1CLgO2WWnIoTA,1,0,4,w8M9pZ_QoM8LPxa5mggs7w
4924540,2016-04-15,3,hJgdrSbwhkp3-GbAyS79Gg,"This was the best F*CKIN BBQ I've ever gotten to taste. 

Me and my old roommates would always come here. My best friend told me about this place since they were one of his clients with hood cleaning and told me how wonderful they were. I was instantly hooked and I had to tell the world.... well, my friends. 

I miss the Korean owners... I miss the main cook. I miss that damned brisket and corn bread. 

I came here so many times and I did not give a rats butt that it took forever to get here since I live across town. 

COME BACK or open up a new restaurant. 
I hear they're in Texas. Anyone ever get their names or anything? Haha. I'm craving seriously bomb ass bbq again.",GLFFf8XbOoRJuxZxGfUd8g,3,3,5,KBcHUV3lYG8YP94zEqLakQ
