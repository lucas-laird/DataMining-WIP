We have tried many places around town and lucky for us Big Paul's was by far the best ribs we've had. The full rack of Baby Backs were very juicy, tender, smoky and flavorful. The sauce was excellent as was the macaroni salad and bbq beans we had on the side. 15 chicken wings completed the meal which was their special for $25. We felt the quantity and quality was well worth the price. The only negative was the wings could have been more saucy but they were cooked crispy they way we like em.

Two slabs of pork spare ribs 
One whole smoked barbecue chicken

Any two large sides 

I call and place the order to be picked up and I gave the lady my order and she tells me I have to pay taxes on the food, then tells me I have to pay extra for my large sides because the Okra and Red Beans and Rice is extra. Then to top it off they add a tip on to their check. I thought it's the customers option to tip, not be told what they are going to tip! WTF?? I picked it up, not like they served it to my table or dropped it off at my door step, or washed my dishes. So $34 for the Groupon and a extra $17.00 once I got there.

So we get home, that is NOT 2 slabs of ribs 5-6 ribs in each. The chicken and the chicken wings.....DRY! Even for dark meat dry as could be. They were so bad the cat wouldn't even eat the chicken!

I've never been disappointed. Starting off with the Sweet Tea, it's always delightful and refreshing.

The food is excellent. I can't help myself with the catfish AND shrimp Poboy. The shrimp is HUGE and tastes incredible. The bbq beans are always a perfect side dish. The sauce itself, spicy or regular, always does the trick. They never hold back on the meat. The food is typically messy, and good BBQ/Southern food is supposed to be. And I would know ;)

They have a fairly good size selection of food. Missing a few things like some homemade macNcheese, but you'll suffice.

Big Paul himself is a super nice fellow, and it's a VERY family orienated place.

The BBQ is very good, maybe the best in Las Vegas. If I was just rating the food it would probably get 5 stars, but I have to consider the whole experience.

Back to the Groupon part of my dissatisfaction:  

http://www.groupon.com/las-vegas/deals/big-pauls-bbq

Your supposed to get $70 worth of food, the discount is the cost of marketing and acquiring a new customer. I'm exactly the kind of customer these places want to attract. I spend a lot of money out on food every month and I will often try out new restaurants using a discount and then be a return guest without a discount.

They absolutely do not give you what they say your are going to get.

The two slabs of ribs was really about 1.5 at the most, they chop them up before they put them in your to-go box to hide the fact they shorted you.

The large sides are supposed to be 16 ounces according to their website.  They are actually 12 ounces (yes I measured them, because I was already leery about the place). I mean come on, Seriously, how much does 4 ounces of baked beans cost. Give the portion you say you are going to get.

The other crappy thing about their offer is they have nice sides like candied yams, Black Eye Peas, and Corn, but when you try to redeem the family pack they only offer you a few basic sides and not their entire sides menu which is all priced exactly the same ($3.99 for 16 oz)

You get about $40 worth of food, and the food is actually very good, it's to bad they try to short change you to make up for their discount.( They only get about $17 from Groupon) Typical restaurants like this run about a 35% food cost, so $40 worth of food (not the $70 its supposed to be) would cost them about $14. I don't think they realized until after they made these promotions. Or maybe they just make these offers trying to survive (cause Groupon sends them the check right away). I really don't know, Only Big Paul knows but the summary is you definitely don't get the amount of food your are supposed to when using a discount.

The place also needs a thorough cleaning and organization, the cashier where there computer is setup is a major mess. 

I really have mixed feelings about posting here, because I'd like to actually return to Big Pauls, the BBQ is that good but their deceptive business practices really bother me, and my publicly posting bothers me too as they might read my review and recognize me and ??

If they cleaned up the place and were a little less deceptive on their offerings it would be an absolute Gem of a BBQ joint in Las Vegas.

Big Paul, If your reading this I wish you  the best of success, but you will need to clean up the joint in more than a few ways if you want to succeed in the longterm.


Original review Below:

This place is a joke. 

If you are using the groupon they offered a few weeks ago, they treat you differently than if you are a ""Paying"" customer.

I called to redeeem the ""Family Meal Package"", but was told that they had sold out of them for the day. I asked if I could substitute some other items since it wasn't my fault they ran out of food. The quick and rude 1 word answer= NO. I asked if I could subsitute some other items like ""Beef Ribs"" and pay the difference in price =NO.

I asked to speak to Paul (the owner). He matter of factly told me that they had already redeemed 65 packages (seems like BS to me) for the day and were sold out of the promotion for the day, come back on Tuesday. I said, I wanted BBQ today, not on Tuesday. He said ""If you don't like it, just call Groupon and ask for a refund ???""

After a little further complaining from me about this being counter intuitive to good business and the whold idea behind using groupon is to attract new customers not chase them away, he gave me the song and dance about how he was just a small mom and pop place that can't afford to give food away every day, that's why they have limits in place, yada, yada, yada.

Needless to say I was rather irritated.  I decided to call back about 5 minutes later using a different phone and no coupon. Miraculously, they now had the items that were previously sold out. Talk about shady & unethical

He didn't have a problem cashing the check Groupon sent him, but seems he doesn't want to pay it back in a timely manner

This guy might no BBQ (didn't actually try it) but he doesn't know caca about how to run a business.

Caveat Emptor (Buyer Beware)

As soon as I opened my car door, I took a whiff of the smokiness that fillled the air and that just totally got me in the mood..

Lunch (and leftovers for dinner):

Spare Ribs and Red Beans & Rice: I wanted riblets but they ran out. The lady told me that the Spare Ribs are exactly the same just bigger. It came plated with 3 large ribs, side of corn bread, bbq sauce and I asked for a hot bbq sauce as well. The ribs were delicious, not finger lickin' but just had a great smokey flavor. Not fall off the bone but just right. The bbq sauce was on the sweet side and the hot version wasn't much different just had a little kick to it. The cornbread was a mini muffin and nothing special. I didn't care too much for the red beans and rice. 

Beef Brisket: 1/2 pound of meat in between Burger buns = Hefty Brisket Burger. ""Just right"" to sum it up in 2 words.. 

Service was Great, lady at the counter was sweet and the owner was very observant. When I started working on the ribs my Brisket Burger wasn't getting any attention and was getting cool at the moment. He came over and placed paper cover over it. Why thank you, sir! Prices fair, Ribs and Brisket recommended and atmosphere was chill (staring at the smoker, for some reason may the food taste better).",mY3mROf28N-vY1fpR-FFUw,2,0,4,P9uParRbdUWLFNcJGu3tOA

I like BBQ, especially slow smoked meats. And their smoker is great. You can see it smoking in the side-patio. I've tried their spare and baby back ribs, pulled pork, beef briscut and hot links. I like the tenderness and smokey flavor they all contain.

For the sides, all I've really tried, but really like, are the BBQ beens.

Sadly, the food was surprisingly bad. I ordered rib tips and brisket, and requested spicy sauce. I'm 99% sure I got mild sauce by mistake, but if somehow I did receive the 'spicy' sauce, then I'm offended by what they call 'spicy.' Either way, the sauce was dull in all aspects - not sweet enough, not salty enough, not packing any other flavors well enough. Besides the sauce being bad, it was poured over my meats in extreme excess, vastly overcompensating for their poor preparation. My food was DRENCHED in sauce, so much that I could hardly distinguish the meat from the soupy red mess.

The rib tips had decent texture and were cooked satisfactorily, not much to complain about there, and definitely nothing to praise. But the brisket was somewhat like soggy cardboard. I was only able to eat about 3 rib tips and 2 pieces of brisket before I actually threw the rest of it away. I really hate wasting food, but there was just no chance that I could actually eat any more of this. The beans were ok - somewhat odd, but I can't put my finger on exactly why. I don't think I can directly criticize the beans, and I'll probably finish eating them as leftovers tomorrow.

Nonetheless, I could tell that somebody probably knew something in their kitchen, and I could probably find something else on the menu that I would really enjoy. If I'm ever in a jam for some reason, I'll give them another try, and just avoid all of the items I ordered today.",3w-Mto6hHy5XxXO163bHTg,1,1,2,urOsv4HOBw7sOMhXM-UnYA

Visiting LV and had a need for ""Q"". Took the family; three kids and two adults.  Happened to be near Paul's and chose it for the reviews.
We didn't order a varied selection; spare ribs, baked potato with pulled pork and lots of sides that served as appetizers.  Beans, jalapenos, fries and mozzarella sticks.
The ribs were excellent.  A little too much sauce but the meat was smoked and cooked perfectly. Meat almost fell off the bone.  Not too fatty and had a great texture.  
Pulled Pork was cooked perfectly and tasty.

Soon after I got my first car I would spend every weekend filling my car up with gas and driving in the hopes of finding a new barbecue joint in the middle of nowhere. Many weekends I was very successful others not so much. Since then I've made it a point to try every barbecue joint I get a chance to since I spend a lot of time on the road. Today I would say I was successful and this place is a success! The smell of the barbecue as I walked in the door was amazing. The lady behind the front counter was very courteous and took my order quickly. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time I ordered pulled pork and fried okra. It came out without much fanfare on a bun, dry with a bottle of sauce to go with it. Overall the pork was very good moist and flavorful. The fried okra was clearly made on the spot from scratch. Not the best I've ever had but certainly no slouch. Although the fried okra was a little bit overcooked for my taste. The restaurant was very quiet and there were no other visitors although I did come in at 2:30 PM. Overall I would say successful. I will be back. I saw a fantastic deal for chicken and ribs so I'll have to try that.",2cwu3mjtBWWU94OnrOWOfA,0,0,3,fVM4pet5Z7-Q3UUpg2R85g

The guy on the phone was very pleasant, he even said at the end of the convo, ""And I'll see you in 45 minutes!"". So I guess that's the same guy who dropped off my food. We ended up ordering their $19.99 combo. 3 meats and 2 sides. We went with the ribs, brisket, and pulled pork. 

Delivery time was perfect, just about 40 minutes when our food arrived. 

As for the food. Pulled pork and brisket were pretty decent. But the pork seemed overly shredded. It will work well for BBQ pork sandwiches which I plan on making tomorrow for dinner. The brisket pulled apart really well, but the seasonings were not exactly right.. The ribs tips: meh. Fatty, and the parts that were not fatty were kind of like eating jerky. I'll pass on those next time. 

Sides. I ordered french fries, which I know is a terrible idea considering they have to be delivered, but I REALLY wanted some starch/carbs because I've been keeping them out of my diet for awhile. They were okay, and had some cajun seasoning on them. Macaroni salad... blah. I think it came out of a can or something. It was bland. Although the noodles were at least not soggy/gross. 

Extra side - I ordered mozzarella sticks because my fiance loves them. They were, um, kind of weird. I'm pretty sure they came out of a box and were just warmed up. Plus - no marinara sauce to dip them in. Womp womp. Lesson learned.

Honestly I'd probably order from here again just because they deliver BBQ to my house, which is awesome and better than driving to Famous Dave's for super mediocre BBQ.",hZfzVrhsCQ9JDAb2jYoJNQ,4,1,3,8O20iDyHyWe1Rr4h6mjbYA

My wife and I have ordered from here 4 or 5 times over the last month, and have tried most of their BBQ options, the Fried Chicken, and quite a few sides.  

I have enjoyed it every time, and the flavor of their meat is very good, though i will agree with several of the other posts that they go WAY overboard on the sauce.  We like sweet sauces, and theirs has a nice tang to it, but MAKE SURE TO ORDER THE SAUCE ON THE SIDE.  I cannot stress this enough.  They put enough sauce on the meat to make it more like a BBQ soup.   .  

I also recommend ordering early in the day, and getting their smoked ham.  They always run out of it by late morning or early afternoon, because it is phenomenal.",5F0NmbrckzAGIkbJ6lHLlQ,2,0,4,yfVCa0cfrXwS28n6uvaSQw

The service is friendly, so that gives them a star. Well, the brisket is OK as well, but it's not worth a second one.

Where did they go wrong? Well, the sides all seemed like they came out of a tin or container, rather than being made fresh. The beans tasted bad, the macaroni salad tasted like it came from Albertson's, and unfortunately, I've had better yams from a can. 

The rib tips were tough as leather, the pork lacked any real taste, and the sausage link kind of tasted like something from Hormel. 

They rushed to open in the new location, so when we went, they only had canned drinks available. 

The brisket was quite good, but, I just can't think of a reason to go back to this place. It's a real shame, because the place came very highly recommended.",mySDXsBhY3u0yI-G2oVDkA,1,0,1,yxxyL4sLvxLzvCMQkCwsnA

I was going to give this 3 stars because it doesn't really suck but it isn't really BBQ either. The style is what I would call East Texas Church Picnic; the meats are all overcooked and the sauce is way too thick and sickeningly sweet. OK, their sauce does really suck. The potato salad was bland and insipid as well.

Brisket is the King, Here the king is undersmoked and over trimmed. Brisket for a Brave New World, or sadly just for the 21st century? I watched the video on their website and it appears they use modern digitally controlled ovens instead of traditional pits. These smoker/ovens produce a very consistent product but it tends to be a little sterile and soulless.

If you like this style of BBQ and many do, go for it. I hope that maybe some of their Southern specialties are good but I doubt that I will return. After I read my review I could not justify 3 stars.",6fr-cVNPoa5lQmGvqkIhFw,0,0,2,hM4zikdDxLzdJkwnOrB_pw
5529453,2011-07-10,2,UQTKPKEzm6513DknF7Scqg,"The second BBQ restaurant at this location post Shish Kabob House.  I was a fan of the last place and the only person to ever write a review on it :(  The menu seems to be about the same as the last with a couple of additions to the sides menu and some pretty good food combos for 2 or more.  

It was July 4th.  I left work late and we didn't feel like firing up the grill.  My initial plan was to just go pick up Famous Dave's but ended up taking a quick right while driving west on Flamingo due to this overpowering smell of barbecued meat!  What the heck right?  Better off supporting a local mom and pop place than a megachain anyways.  

I ordered the combo of baby back ribs slab, 20 hot wings and 2 large sides for $24.99.  The slab of ribs with 2 small sides was almost $20 so this was a no brainer for $5 more.  The ribs were pretty awesome.  They had a fantastic smokey flavor to them that one could only get by slow cooking those babies all day.  Wings were pretty standard.  About the same as any other pizza joint in town but good enough.  

The cashier recommended the red beans and rice along with the macaroni salad for sides which were both spot on.

5765788,2012-06-04,4,UQTKPKEzm6513DknF7Scqg,"Honestly, I'd give this place negative stars if I could. The food was ok, but as a paying customer, I expect to be treated with courtesy and not like a criminal.

I live very close (less than 5 minutes by car) to this place and was very excited to have a bbq place in the neighborhood; so excited that when my cousin came to visit, I recommended we give it a try. We drive up there and place our order with who we later found out was the owner (yes, Big Paul himself). He was not the friendliest of guys, but the prices were reasonable, we were hungry, and the place smelled great so I overlooked it.

We brought our food home and I was ready to sink my teeth in to a juicy smoked rib, only to bite down in to a tough, rubbery piece of meat that I literally could not chew. But the sauce was pretty tasty and we'd ordered other items so though I was disappointed by the ribs, I moved on to the brisket and pulled pork. Neither was anything to write home about, but the meat was at least chewable and as I said before the sauce was good. 

We finished eating and my pregnant cousin reached in to her bag for dessert, only to find that they had forgotten to include her peach cobbler. No big deal, we lived close and they deliver. She called the restaurant to inform them of the mistake. They did not offer to deliver it to us, but agreed when asked. My cousin also asked if she could be upgraded to a large as compensation for the mistake. The girl on the other end said ""that shouldn't be a problem."" 

The delivery guy shows up at the house with a small peach cobbler. My cousin asks about the large and the driver knows nothing about it. She repeated what the girl on the phone had told her and he said he would call and find out what happened. The delivery guy gets in his car to use the phone and a minute later we hear his car drive away, assuming he was going to get the large cobbler. We wait half an hour and then my cousin calls again. This time the owner gets on the phone. My cousin politely explains what happened to him and we were both STUNNED when the owner begins shouting at her and saying that he ""waisted gas"" sending his driver to her and if she didn't want a small, that was ""her problem."" Still in shock, my cousin explains that there must have been a misunderstanding. Still rude, the owner says that she can come pick up her money (which was only $2.99 by the way) but he was done with the whole situation. He would not even listen to her speak.  At this point my cousin is becoming upset (not to mention hormonal, because she is pregnant). She tries voicing how displeased she is with the way she is being treated and the owner asks her is she BELIEVES IN GOD!!! WTF?!?!? What did that have to do with anything? How unprofessional can you be?!  

Incredibly annoyed by now, I accompany my cousin back to the restaurant. Again, it was only $3 but she still wanted the peach cobbler (again, pregnant).  We walk in and she says to the owner, ""Sir I ordered a peach cobbler and..."" Before she could finish speaking he opens the register and cuts her off to say ""There's your money, now you can go."" Shocked again, my cousin says ""I would just like to say that I am very disappointed with..."" He cuts her off again, ""You made your point, now get out. If you don't leave now, I'll call the cops. I've got you on camera and I know your address."" (Which was actually MY address because she doesn't live here in Vegas). 

By now, my cousin is PISSED. ""Call the cops."" She tells him, ""I've done nothing wrong. All I wanted was to upgrade a small peach cobbler to a large, no one even bothered to ask me if I was willing to pay the additional money for an upgrade! I'm a paying customer!"" He gets on the phone and dials the police. To avoid any trouble, we left the restaurant both disappointed and confused. As we are getting in to the car, the owner follows us outside to read off the license plate number to my cousin's rental car to the police (supposedly) on the phone. 

My experience here was so horrible and so disappointing, I will NEVER eat here again. I wish the opposite were true, but in my opinion bad service out weighs good bbq sauce. Never in my life have I been so disrespected and treated like a criminal just for ordering dessert. Especially when it was THEM who made the mistake in the first place. They really need to learn how to do business with people or they surely will not last long.",ru1KJdPX4Di-ZCa38XB_JA,13,0,1,Z6_UmBF65ey4M-QBMQ089A

This time I had a rack of ribs, wings, cole slaw and green beans.  The wings are pretty good, cole slaw was yummy as were the green beans (fresh).  I am very happy Paul's is in my neighborhood and delivers promptly.  I met him the first time and he was very nice- I don't know what happened in these other instances but I found him cool.
