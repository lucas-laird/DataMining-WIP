There were some people seated at the bar with food and drinks already, but no bartender, host, or waiter in sight. We stood around for a few minutes wondering if it was self seating or not. We wanted to sit at the booths but there was a large partition and we didn't want to be overlooked so we decided to sit at the bar, seeing as how there were no waiters to be found. Through the small window in the door we could see ""employees"" in the back walking around. It appeared that one was either eating or drinking something in the back. 5 minutes pass by.... what seemed like 10 minutes passed by until someone finally walked out. At this point we were about to walk out. No apology. He tended to the customers that were already there first. Finally he came over and handed us menus. He clearly had no service industry experience. We basically had to flag him down to order drinks and food. It took about 5 minutes in between each order because he kept walking away and talking to other people and wouldn't check in on us. We basically had to interrupt him to order things. And when we did he just gave us a blank look and said OK or YEAH. We ordered the loco moco poutine with has option of spam or hamburger and he didn't even bother to ask which we wanted. We had to tell him to make sure he knew. We had to order our Bahn mi through the other bar tender, who was a smidge more personable. Our food came and it smelled and looked amazing. But once we took a bite of the poutine... it wasn't very good. Gravy was too thick and bland. The Bahn mi sandwich was decent. The pork belly was cooked well but all I tasted was raw jalape√±o. We finished our drinks and No one asked if we wanted a refill. We asked for the check and waited forever because the guy was talking to other patrons. We had to ask again because we thought he forgot. Then I think he realized we were upset and then started being friendly. A little too late. He made small talk about my tattoo and informed me that he was a tattoo artist. Not sure why is was working the bar. Overall... this wouldn't such a bad place if the service was even decent but the customer service is non existent and the bar was dirty, it had a bunch of dried beer on it and had not been wiped. Not sure if I came on an off day or what, but I really don't understand how it has such  good reviews.",V-Y2bJWLjKlxr_gn-YIkUQ,1,0,1,r-W5gLBoNb_HG30uR7cwkQ

My wife and I shared the spring rolls to start. I had the traditional poutine, which was a great portion size and had excellent flavors.

Smaller on the inside than it looks from the outside, definitely a good place to go with a group of friends.

We ordered the wings. Those are a must! I almost never clean to the bones... these were good enough to. Crispy wings, moist meat, incredible sauce.

We also both ordered pub burgers, cooked medium. I added a farm fresh egg - they broke the egg, probably while building, bummer. He got his with bacon. This made them $15 burgers. Were they? Not really. Probably would've paid $12 total. They were cooked great, good size; a little fatty. Probably a 70/30 ground beef.

Last note: they have games there including cards against humanity, in case you don't want to watch sports on one of their three screens.",mjbHPwsvpGkM83rqgVf_SQ,2,0,3,wu4Guh1DoJwK76mYZmnshA

I highly recommend it. The fried deviled eggs were pretty good, but I've had better before. The pork belly Banh mi was very good and very spicy. We also got a burrata chutney that was good, but where we sat by the window it got cold quickly. So we ate about half of it, then it then it wasn't very melty anymore.

Our server, Tristan, was very friendly and knowledgeable, explaining that all the food dishes were prepared fresh only after the customer orders since everything the kitchen prepares is ordered daily. We ordered two Pork Belly Bahn Mi sandwiches, a Chicken Bahn Mi and Veggie Spring Rolls-everything was flavorful, fresh and very tasty! I asked Tristan for some beer suggestions and she sold me on the Occidental Dunkel, which was very nice with lunch-smooth and perfect with my Pork Belly Bahn Mi!

I like the variety of music selections and/or genres at 595. I also appreciate multiple flat-screen TV's at the pub for people that enjoy watching sports.

We shared the FRIED DEVILED EGGS
5/5 on those. They are beer battered and fried to perfection! The spicy aioli it comes with is delicious too!

We also shared the PORK BELLY BUHN MI
5/5 sooo good! The pork belly is seasoned so well and melts in your mouth and the fresh veggies in the bun are crispy.

Nice chill beat coming from the speakers.

Again and again and again. 
I think my naive and I who live in Alaska patronize 595 as much as a local. 

Can't stop coming here. 
Stopped by yet again. 
I thought I'd be good with a song order. 
Nope!
I had to order a second serving. 
So juicy , flavorful, easy to bite a chunk of chicken protein off a bone. 

Between the gourmet fries
The artistic salads , and the beer. 
I wish I lived next door. 
Well..... then I'd be drunk and stuffed all the time!

Hmmmm
Not a bad idea. 

Wanna get stuffed and buzzed. 

Come in!

4-16/18.  AGAIN!!!
Damn the fries here are fantastic. 
I've tried to make my own at home.
Water soaking 
Double frying, getting the best counter top Grier I can get...( no such thing)

595 soaks their potatoes for thee hours in cold water to draw the starches out, then fries them. 
Then......
Fries then a second time. 
Makes me want to spend 400$ on my own 220v fryer to use next to my outdoor grill..... 
hmmmm maybe not. 

It's a lot easier to get served these delicacies at 595 and get s beer to boot. ( faster too)

The wings are so juicy. 
I'm afraid to try to poutine, it's also made from scratch.  My bellies big enough.  I have enough addictions.  
The fries are one of them. 

Servers and ambiance are so warm. 
Thanks 595!

I love the vibes and decor here - industrial, modern design. I was greeted by the bartenders and you could tell that they were really proud to work there. I came here for lunch and it was also happy hour. 

I ordered the ""bad ass"" poutine which is spicy chili, smoked bacon, cheese, and beer on top of crispy fries. It is definitely spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle. 

The Vietnamese spring roll is a classic and I love how they made it. Fresh ingredients.

They have an array of beer, and they even let you test a few! I ordered quite a few, I cant remember which ones. So, I guess you'd have to stop in to try! I met Van, the owner, when he served me one of my beers. He is a great guy. Can't wait to go back again!",cGok9ycGn_HvZaht9xkyPw,20,15,4,wdrDrM9HTvQYMaohRjEEdw

She greeted us right away and made us feel welcome. She helped us choose beers and we got our food....but then all of a sudden she was gone??? We were done eating and there were two other people there. We needed more water, beer, and the tab. We were ignored and not helped. My husband had to ask for more napkins, drinks, and wet naps after we sat there for 15-20 minutes with dirty dishes in front of us. Where did my other bar tender go? We wanted to thank you for your awesome service and leave you a good tip! Anyways the food was ok, nothing out the normal bar food. We ordered the pork spring rolls, home made fries, and chicken wings. The pumpkin patch beer was pretty good.

Our bartender took the time to ask us what kind of drinks we liked, to better compliment our tastes. Incredibly friendly and easy to talk to. When you walk in, its open seating. You'll find that the atmosphere is friendly and cozy. Perfect place to catch up with a friend or watch the game.

But what I came here for is the Vietnamese geared food, with a twist. Yes, they do have food such as fries and chicken. But what caught my attention was their Beef Brisket Banh Minh Sandwich and Pork Belly Burger. Both of which were delicious! Both dished we ordered were a blend of tender meat, cooked to perfection, fresh and crisp radish and carrots. I will say that their meat does lean on the salty side. These are great when paired with their fries.

But if a burger or sandwich isn't what your craving, fear not! You have the option to opt for a salad or taste something light from their appetizers. Or, if you feel like having sweets they do have something to help you satisfy that as well. They have bread pudding, cheesecake, and chocolate budino(kind of like a cake/pudding hybrid)!",AAUPbv9rhQs8LDeqGgWVCQ,3,4,4,9L_hsO3kl8-iOcRM1_DhMQ

1808593,2017-07-09,14,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"595 is definitely a gastropub- the dark, industrial redesign of the former Elements space is highlighted by a menu focusing on brews, burgers, and shareable apps. Visited with some of my favorite dudes and tried a handful of stuff on the menu. Overall consensus was that the slow-cooked pork belly is a standout but most other dishes were on the salty side- maybe this effect is lessened when there is more drinking involved.

The beer cheese app (featuring pretzel rolls from Great Buns bakery) was accented with flaked sea salt that it really didn't need. The roux-based sauce was decently smooth though. The classic poutine arrived to the table slightly cold and with an egg verging on over-hard rather than runny, but the portion size was large and the fries are made from fresh-cut potatoes which always makes them tastier. Needed more cheese curds! The sandwiches seemed to fare a bit better, with the pork belly bahn mi being thick and savory while the fried chicken sandwich (warned as being spicy) was also notably salty. Opting for a side salad over the fries might be a better option if sodium intake is an issue.

Though I don't drink, I'm told the beer list is pretty interesting. There's seating at four-tops, high-tops, and the bar, as well as a small (currently unused) patio space. So far, no word on a happy hour or any brunch offerings, but those will likely come in time. I'm open to a revisit to try a couple of other dishes; the burrata app, bundino dessert, and brisket bahn mi all sound good on paper but I'll give them a bit more time to get the kitchen flowing better.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,25,19,3,vfD4veFcdN2rB9aerm6r4Q

My frist impression nothing new reading past reviews was dam walking into dark abyss. We went for early dinner so lot of natural light out. Soon walk in think someone moved the clock forward. I missed cool buffalo head on one of the walls. Thankfully my roommate caught it in the darkness. The rolling garage door on one side that assume better weather might open it up. The bar area is small not many seats but love the way all set up. The whole place is really small. Later in the night once got pack it can get loud. Overall fan of the vibe of the whole look just think weird that the place is so dark. 

The craft beer list is TOP NOTCH. I am in no way craft expert but they have lot of beers that hardly see and nice selection from IPA, and list goes on. Our server made two great recommendations based on thinking red ale or new castle style. She like can give you sample of each. She found the perfect beer celebrate my birthday.

The food was awesome!!! It was not planned but got in on some of the HH food. We got three items for appetizers. The Fried Devil Eggs, Beer and Cheese Poutine, and Mini Banh Mi sliders (we got the signature chicken ones; if going get them HH it one per order and basically half size regular size Banh MI). The Devil Eggs never really had them fried traditional size many times. It adds another element with either panko or breadcrumbs coated on the outside. Its nice crispy outside then have perfect hard boiled egg with the filling that creamy, delicious, and addicting cause pop one in mouth just want more. The poutine fries was solid. It interesting that they have five different ones. Not many places serve it so kind of cool seeing few options besides traditional. Honest need try the traditional next go around cause not having brown gravy on it  feel off. Beer and Cheese great combination. The portion size is nice. It definitely made to share cause for one that lot of food. The little Banh Mi slider was winnah winnah chicken dinner. The bread was on point. The bread for me makes or break Banh Mi. The whole sandwich was tasty. The price was great for HH and think about portion size. One of the better HH food menus. My entree had Banh Mi before got HH ones. I got another one but tried the beef brisket one instead. It was really good. But honestly if had choose between the two would go back to the chicken or signature one. The beef brisket felt like little dried out but the filling with the sauce, vegetables, and the bread all good still. Just if had choose not order it again. 

The service was awesome. Maybe cause went for early dinner and not as busy. She was very attentive, friendly, made great recommendations on beer selection, and great service.

2315479,2017-07-25,1,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"Went here on a Saturday night around 11pm.
I liked the space, small but nice. Seemed like a cool little neighborhood bar. 
Unfortunately the food and service left something to be desired...
I tried to order a specialty cocktail from their menu, however it was unavailable. Then I tried to order a bacaradi and coke - no Bacardi so I had to settle on house rum. Then I tried to order pretzels and beer cheese - no pretzels.  The server offered to serve the beer cheese with pita, which I accepted. I also ordered the classic poutine.
When my drink came out it was without a straw, as they were even out of straws!! What kind of bar runs out of straws?? Very strange, especially since there is a Smiths right across the street.
The food took a long time to come out, about 20 minutes from the time I ordered and it was disappointing to say the least.... everything was cold and just not good. The beer cheese was too thick and bland. The poutine was just ok - the gravy was good but the fries were cold and soggy and the cheese curds were almost non existent.

We ordered pickup and customer service was pleasant. I'm giving two stars based on the food. The chicken skin had too much breading on it and I could barely taste the skin. It literally just tasted like breading. My boyfriend ordered buffalo wings and we could barely taste the buffalo sauce!! It was just fried chicken wings/thighs.

First of all it closes at 2am. I know, typically, people hate this but I'm born and raised in Vegas and any place that doesn't let me stay there all night is a win in my book! That means that I know for certain my boyfriend can't convince me to stay out longer than 2, and we get to say we closed the bar down ! Second of all, there's no gaming and you can't smoke inside. Yes and yes ! I won't lose extra money feeding the game machine after I've had too much to drink! I also won't come home smelling like an ashtray. 

We came on a Friday night and it wasn't packed but they were busy enough. It took awhile for anybody to come around and take our order which is where the one star drops off. Whenever they did come around (which wasn't often) they were really nice though. In the corner they have a ton of games you can choose from to play with your friends. Our group chose exploding kittens! We had a really great time :).

Also we all ordered different things and every one of us was pleased with our selections. The deviled eggs, hummus, spring rolls, and pork bun were all a hit at our table ! Will definitely be back to try out more craft beers, more of their food menu, and to play some games while doing so.

The first time they tasted plain or too salty if anything. Today they had a little pepper flavor to it. I enjoyed my chili cheeseburger AGAIN and I added bacon this time I also got more into the craft beer this go/round since I've been trying to step my craft beer game up. I tried the green flash IPA and I'm not an IPA guy. It was solid. I ordered a heffawizen and an orange blood kolsch. All of the beers were good. What's cool is if you are into craft beer is that they continuously switch up their beer menu. The bartenders and other servers were very attentive . I noticed they had a power outlet up front at the bar which was a plus for me since my phone is always dead lol .  The 1st time I came by they didn't have wifi . This time they did.

FOOD:  The fried chicken skins were pretty bland. The sweet chili sauce was the only thing that saved it. I think they should use soy sauce + vinegar + chopped onions as a dip instead.  Their signature banh mi was pretty good. It looks like they use higher quality ingredients. But, for $9 I don't think it's worth it .

SERVICE:  3/5.  Im guessing it took around 15-20 min for all of us to our food.

AMBIENCE:  3/5.  It's a small restaurant with a bar.  It's quiet in there, too.

I am only giving this place 2 stars instead of one just because our server Amy was very friendly. 
The beer selection is nice. 
My friend had one of their specialty drinks and she wasn't crazy for it..
We had the hummus which came with super hard pita chips... suggestion, maybe something softer like pita bread..? Otherwise hummus itself was tasty. 
The chicken wings were dry and over cooked. Didn't care much for the sauces. 
The ""crispy"" chicken skins were ok. They weren't too crispy and a bit soggy. Maybe just not fried long enough. 
My friend asked for no tomatoes in her $9 salad. Tons of tomatoes in it! Good thing she wasn't allergic but did end up getting real sick.
The deep fried deviled eggs were just ok. One piece was enough for me...
The Bahn mi slider, or whatever it's called was not good. Hardly no taste and mostly just bread. Waste. 
Overall, we were not satisfied with the food. Service was great! Beer was yummy. 
Small and cozy place. They just need to improve their food. 
Oh and those sheets the food comes on....really? 2 eggs on something that big? We hardly had any room on our tables for everything because of all those metal sheets. Cute but not necessary.

2569332,2017-12-18,3,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"Excellent gastropub in Spring Valley that isn't obnoxiously loud with patrons drunk on beer. Everything from the food to the service was five stars for me. The gastropub itself isn't too big, so we had one server serve us the entire time. She had a smile on her face the entire time when she attended to us and did so genuinely. Everything from taking our orders promptly, to filling our water cups, to correcting a minor hiccup along the way was spot on. You can tell, this business truly emphasizes excellent customer service. 

My boyfriend and I skipped the variety of beers they have on tap because we aren't avid beer drinkers and can't appreciate it. But we did try their burgers and sides.

The badass pork belly burger ($13) was really badass. There were slices of fatty pork belly on top of a burger patty, and cole slaw. I also added a farm egg for $2 extra. The combination was filling and tasty. The red peppers in the cole slaw gave the burger a mild kick and was surprising to the tongue. I added a simple salad as a side for $3 extra. The salad came with mixed greens, carrots, cumcubers, tomatoes, radish and a light citrus vinaigrette. 

The chili burger ($12) was chili atop a hamburger patty. Although the chili was tasty, the burger itself was a bit dry. Be prepared to get down and dirty with this burger because it will get messy. A side of fries were added to this order for $3 extra and it came with a side of aioli dipping sauce. 

For dessert, we tried the Reese's bread pudding. Save room for dessert because this decadent peanut butter and chocolate dish is too good to skip. Sticks of bread are stacked atop one another and served with a side of sweet whipped cream and crumbs. The portion is pretty hefty too and can serve up to 4 people!

I will definitely be coming back to try all the other dishes 595 has to offer. This place is truly a gem.",g_4zySOI_HisK5rG_2dw6Q,9,4,5,yaomyodBL7Bke225r8xD6Q

To be honest, she is the kind of person who makes all experiences memorable, all bad days better and all heavy days lighter. Isn't that why most regulars frequent places such as these? Yes. And that is why 595 became my regular dwelling place.. Now that this special soul is gone, I can't imagine myself coming back here. It feels empty and lifeless.

They support local business and promote local brews, which makes this place a cornerstone for good eats. The ambiance is fantastic, with tables that have that butcher block nouveau feel. It's comfortable and the service is fantastic. What's even better is the food.

The menu has an amazing variety of Asian and American fare, from their in-hoise cured pork belly to the Butcher Block (the Vegas meat vendor, yes) burger, and their varieties of poutine. We have the chicken wings, Asian style, and their made from scratch burrata with ginger apricot chutney a try for starters. The wings hit hard with great soy and gochuchang flavor, crispy on the first bite, and finger licking good--literally.  The burrata is a gentle cloud of cheese goodness that is enhanced by the chutney. 

The butcher block burger is so well seasoned and cooked to perfection that squeezing down with my fingers against the bun bring out a lot of juice. The toppings don't overpower the great flavor of the burger itself, but compliment it with every bite. On top do the beautiful bun, it's a perfect meal with or without fries. However, the fries here are made with love, so I strongly suggest ordering a side with aioli. The hot Fried chicken is spicy, crunchy goodness topped with cool lettuce and pickles. It's just a great chicken sandwich that satisfies any southern chicken cravings. I highly recommend the poutine made with gravy made in house and some cheese curds and a fried egg. Lovely, crispy fries that don't get soggy even with gravy, it was creamy, perfectly flavored goodness. I wanted to lick the paper! I know now that every visit here will include poutine no matter what.

Dessert was amazing, served in the cutest jars and with crumbles that felt like my childhood cookie dreams on a plate. The dark chocolate dessert topped with sea salt and crumble, olive oil drizzle and roasted hazelnuts was crunchy, chocolate goodness. Almost close to a ganache but still at a mousse consistency, I enjoyed every chocolatey, nutty bite. Their cheesecake topped with yuzu and served with strawberries and a shortbread crumble with olive oil drizzle made my night! Light, citrus tones and sweet cookie crumble made this dessert a must for those wanting a sweet but light finish.

Paired with local beers, each part of the experience was fun and a true experience. I love the fact that the owner and chef work hard to make everything from scratch, because it shows with every bite. I appreciate the care and love in the food, and look forward to our trip through the menu soon.

I'm kind of new to las Vegas and came to the unfortunate conclusion that the craft beer scene here is horrible. 595 craft and brewery is a hoppy oasis in the barren desert of las Vegas. Not the biggest selection but it's beers you actually WANT to drink. Well done 595. Well done.,q9ddKjUIm9yo3Xv6y8e7xw,1,1,5,kE_b8EKpNo-BypnRbwir3A

We sat at the bar and were greeted by the bartender. The service was okay. I felt like because we ordered regular cocktails  it wasn't the full on craft experience. We had trouble with some of the ingredients on the menu and the bartender helped us out but I felt like she was annoyed. No biggie we ordered our drinks Queen Bee, Daquiri and the C + E. The drinks were good. Really strong. There happy hour menu was pretty good. We ordered the spicy crab dip. The dip was a 10. Served with crackers and pita bread.

Since I'm not too knowledgeable about what kind of beers I like, I asked the bartender for recommendations and he gave me a couple different options to taste to find which one I want to commit to. I've been here a few different times and each time I had a different style of beer that I really liked! Their taps are constantly rotating but I know that there's always going to be something I'll like when I come. I give them a ton of props for bringing more craft beer to Vegas!

Now onto the munchies! There are so many good things on the menu that I love. 

For appetizers I highly recommend the fried deviled eggs and the chicken skins. Both are super addicting! 

For main dishes all the banh mis are fiiirrree. If you don't know what a banh mi is, crawl out from under that rock and welcome to the best sandwich you've ever had. The hot fried chicken sandwich is also everything I've ever wanted in a chicken sandwich. Make sure to ask for the home made buttermilk (ranch) dressing for your sandwich and fries. It's bomb diggity. 

Right now they have a pumpkin spice bread pudding that makes you forget it's still 80 degrees in October. I also love that it comes with home made whipped cream on top.

Beer: the selection was awesome! The prices were really good for draft beers. This is the only part that deserves more than 2 stars. 

Service: our waiter seemed seriously annoyed that he had to wait on us. Party of 6 that included 2 kids and 4 adults. If you can't act happy to serve people you need to be sent home. 

Food: mediocre at best. We ordered a salad it was ok. 2 appetizers that came out with our meals. The kids food came out very last and it was the chili. The temperature of the chili was so hot we had to add several ice cubes to it. Not acceptable. We also ordered A bob mi sandwich that was tasteless.

The beer menu is quite good with a bunch of unknown San Diego breweries on draft.  They let you sample which I always enjoy, though no flights were offered.  The entrees ranged from $9-13 and the beers were around $6-7.  Plenty of TVs and high tops make it a great spot to watch some sports if in the area.

Not only was the manager Van accommodating, we loved our server. I don't remember her name. Sorry! She was really sweet and upbeat. I almost thought she was gonna cream me with my birthday cake. Lmao. But my friend had already done that -_-.

I got the Bahn Mi special. People said they don't toast this but it is toasted. It's just lightly toasted, it's not rock hard like Lee's sandwich. But a little extra toasty would give it the right texture. Flavor was good however my friends had a hard time because of how spicy it was. 

I loved it because I'm always asking for extra jalape√±os. But if you're not digging the spicy, I'd suggest asking for none. I had two in mine and it was pretty kicking. 

I also ordered the poutine! It was so good! I haven't had it since I was in Vancouver. But it was just delicious! I honestly wanted to eat all of it but I was too full. 

My friend got the crab dip that we shared. It was with imitation crab. I think this was my least favorite item.

Went in Wednesday night (the place is tucked away behind the rainbow Walgreens) - and was blown away. Cute place (tiny, but still seemingly ample seating), great decor, awesome vibe with the music - reminds me of a bar I would visit in beach town Charleston, SC. 

Amazing service on Wednesday. Offered to sample many beers I wasn't familiar with. Ended up doing a beer/food pairing. Van, took great care of me and was very enthusiastic about my food selections. Always a good vibe when they get hyped about how you're eating the food. 

Outstanding food. Seriously. Incredible. And very very fair priced. A side of out-of-this-world pork belly is very generous for $5. I went in alone, and crushed..

-an appetizer of the fried deviled eggs (being from the south - this was a foodgasm) // paired with blueberry wheat
-Mixed greens salad with the garlic chicken and pork belly (omfg. Awesome. And they have chopsticks to enjoy the food slowly as intended) // paired with farmhouse ale
-Nutella Dark Chocolate Almond Bread Pudding (I shared a photo with a friend.. this is a party in your mouth) // paired with cali' creamin. 

The dessert was so damn good I almost ordered a second round. Except by this point I was stuffed. 

SO I CAME BACK ON THURSDAY. I had to try the burgers. Had to. And god, am I glad I did. Also incredible. Perfect bun. 

Only downside? Menu offered grilled or fried onions.. grilled onions gross me out so I asked for fried. They're still grilled.. bartender told me he meant to tell me that. Service tonight was okay, but not as mind blowing as Wednesday - they seemed preoccupied with personal convos. But no biggie. The food made up for it!! And the place is new, so turnover is bound to happen while ironing it out! Besides, once I got my bread pudding, all was forgotten.

Me and my girlfriend have pronounced 595 as our numero UNO favorite bar/gastropub in town. It hits all the buttons and makes for a great experience consistently every time. Upon 5 visits I find more reasons to love the spot and plan on making a habit on coming more. 

The food is SO DARN GOOD. Perhaps the biggest distinguishing factor of this spot. True personality dashed on each dish, it's really hard to go wrong anywhere on the menu. The Vietnamese fusion of classy gastropub dishes is evident throughout the menu and makes for tough selection every time. So far our hands down favorites are that ridiculous dynamite dip (R U kidding this idea is gold) and the banh mi (classic, porkbelly WHATEVA). The beer selection is great too I always try a new IPA every time I stop in!

One of the biggest reasons for our returning is the consistently amazing service and company of the bartenders, especially Charles. That guy is truly awesome, remembered us after our first visit and is so welcoming every time we come back. He balances his dope company with solid service like a true professional and really completes the whole visit.

When I asked for it I was told that this bar rotated through their beers so they don't always have the same selections. I thought that was an awesome way to keep people coming back to try different beers. The  counter is super cool! I didn't realize it until the end, but the silver panel is meant to keep your drinks cold.

They let you sample if you want. They have a nice selection of sours which a lot of breweries don't have in Las Vegas. Their happy hour menu is good, I definitely recommend pairing the food with a beer or a drink. It is definitely drunk food lol, salty and fried everything. But even if you don't drink the food is still a plus. 

I ordered
-fried chicken skins
-fried deviled eggs
-chicken banh mi
-original banh mi

I liked everything! I love fried chicken skins (especially from Carson Kitchen), but these were different. They reminded me more of chicharon with the texture and the breading on it and the sauce was like vinegar. If you're Filipino then you'll know what Im talking about lol. I liked it, they give you a large portion. The deviled eggs were delicious, I've never had them fried before. And both of the banh mis were good! I appreciated the fact that the bread was on the softer side because nothing sucks more than bread that cuts the inside of your mouth (ahemmm Lee's). 

The bartender there was awesome, she definitely was cool to talk to and told us a lot about the place. The owners are from San Diego, which to me, made more sense of the beer selection, decor, and ambiance. They have cool events to look forward to, and they are planning to come out with a brunch menu on Saturday's and Sunday's. I can't wait for that because who doesn't love brunch?

Upon entering, found this place small but hip and chill. 

Athough beer is the main attraction, the owners are seeking to establish the gastropub as a family-friendly community hangout. It's great it's a no-smoking and no-gaming place.

The menu is interesting, unique and reasonably priced.

I skipped the variety of beers as I'm not a beer fan. I had their Sparking wine and my bf had their Cocktails called Gordon's Cup that consists of Gin + Cucumber + Mint + Fresh Lime. It was tasty but not strong.

Their craft beers are from all over and they let you sample if you want.

Some of the food ordered were-
Garbage Nachos from the Special menu
Pork Belly Burger
Chicken Skins: breaded, slightly spicy.
Pork Belly Bahn Mi: added an egg on it, it's my fave. The pork belly was cooked to perfection and flavorful.

I went to get lunch with a friend during their happy hour. The appetizers were cheap but the portions were large for the most part. I was only disappointed by the pork tacos coming with 2 per order, it was best to get them for $5 during happy hour than double that at their usual price. I ordered the tacos and a set of nachos which I had to power through to finish. I can only wonder what the size of their entres are.

 My friend ordered wings, chili fries and the unbelievably delicious deviled eggs which she had to take home due to the large serving sizes. The eggs were breaded and baked, I've never seen that done before.

Tried both the original banmi slider and the chicken one. I'm not sure which was which because the server didn't tell us, but I think I liked the original one.

fried chicken skins: Delicious, but I would go between ""omg this is so good,"" and then realize I'm eating pure fat and think ""omg I can't keep eating this."" It's very interesting dish and they give you a lot. I would recommend it, just don't think too much about what it is because you really forget it's chicken skins. I was a big fan of the chili sauce.

fried deviled eggs: Pretty self-explanatory. I liked the sauce it came with.

Deviled egg: recommended appetizer which turned out to be the highlight. Fried egg white with creamy/paste-like egg yolk on top. Came with a dipping sauce. This is one of those simple but great appetizer. 

Furikake tuna burger: tuna was seared and perfectly cooked. I liked how the sauce had a hint of spice, but wish they sprinkled more furikake or offered extra furikake on the side. This was one of my favorite.

Chicken sandwich: sadly no bueno. Chicken was waaaay to greasy and there was aftertaste of old oil or grease that lingered in my mouth. 

Loco moco poutine: Choose spam, came with 3 slices. Egg was cooked perfectly with runny yolk. Fries were not too crispy as it was covered in gravy that instantly turned all the fries soggy. Gravy itself was mediocre and not my favorite.

We came late on a weekend night for some nosh, not an entire meal and there was absolutely no wait. We were greeted immediately by our awesome waitress Ruda. She and Chelsea who brought us our dishes, filled waters attentively, and made recommendations were super personable and should absolutely be commended. They made our entire visit extra enjoyable. 

The table shared:
 -Fried deviled eggs with Gochujang Aioli. Beautifully plated and well received by hubs. 

-Thai Cashew Hummus with Pickled Veggies and delicious light crispy House Crackers. So different than any hummus I've tasted before! It definitely had a kick but not too much the littles couldn't enjoy it. The house made crackers were awesome! 

-Hand Cut House Fries perfectly fried and salted, served with Sambal Ketchup, Gochujang Aioli or Roasted Garlic Aioli. I hear their poutine is popular and came recommended, but plain was a veg friendly option that was certainly delish. 

All plates were very well liked and we would recommend them all. The menu has a heavy Asian influence, but you'll find anything from burgers to a handful of Bahn Mi, even a popcorn of the day. Love that last one!

Vegan and GF options available. 
Lighter options such as salads too. 

For a sweet ending the crew went for the bread pudding of the day which was a salted caramel they really loved. The Chocolate Olive Oil Budino Chocolate Soil + Sea Salt + Candied Peanut seems to be a fan favorite however. 

The craft list which is an obvious huge draw was very impressive and interesting and included many locals. It offered something for every beer drinker's taste...ambers, pilsners, IPA, blondes and pales, porters and stouts. They are heavy on the fruit here ...blueberry wheat, boysenberry sour, tangerine pale ales, a blood orange option, even pear or pineapple cider. I'm personally happy to see any pumpkin brews on a menu in the summertime! Oh, and beer aficionados, they're on tap finder if you want to see what's happening. 

If brews aren't your thing, the cocktails were creative and included the oh so trendy shrubs and bitters. They had intriguing rock and roll-ish names too. 

If you're looking to stay off the beaten path in a more casual, neighborhood bar type atmosphere and just taking a load off while enjoying brews and smaller bites, this place should be considered.

That being said, this review is about their food and service.  Overall service was good. Our server was very attentive and our items served quickly. If I had one complaint about the service, it was our server's negative comments about Yelpers. I'm not going into details to what she said.  She basically accused all Yelpers of being unethical. Bottom line, her comments put a bad taste in my mouth. What didn't put a bad taste in my mouth was their Fried Crispy Chicken Skins. This was so good, crispy, tasty, and not greasy.  If there's one food item to get at 595, this is it.  I also tried their Beer Cheese (pretzel bread w/beer cheese) and the Craft Burger.  The beer cheese lacked flavor and the burger was on the salty side.  Actually, I think everything was on the salty side.  Overall, with the exception of the fried chicken skins, everything I tried was just okay.  On the bright side, the pretzel bread and bun was fabulous.  Overall, 595 gets 3 stars from me.

4107109,2018-04-21,4,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"I might've been a little hard-pressed to give more than 4 stars if I'd visited here only for food, but now that I'm also a fan of craft beer, this is one of my new favorite spots.

595 Craft and Kitchen is a gastropub in an area of town which isn't as well-known for that sort of thing. As I suggested above, the highlight is their craft beer selection, which is comprised of 24 rotating draft beers from local and remote breweries, more so the latter. That's great for someone like me who wants to have new tastes, and so are the $5-7 prices for most of the taps (with a few understandably pricier choices).

I won't spend (relatively) too much time on describing the beers themselves, but considering my enjoyment of each of my choices, it's a feather in 595's cap that they've procured such a selection.

I started with some beers priced awesomely for happy hour ($1 off non-local beers, from Mon-Fri 3-6pm and midnight-close), namely Mikkeller (San Diego)'s Big Hazy NE TIPA ($4 for about 10-12 oz) and the Mother Earth / Melvin collaboration Four Seasons, Spring 2018 edition (also $4 for about 10-12 oz). The Big Hazy was delicious and somewhat reminiscent of the trendy hazy IPA style, while the Four Seasons stayed more toward traditional yet fruit-tinged IPA territory.

Next, I ventured into the specials of this particular day, the $4.20 beers. I got the New Belgium Hemperor HPA first, and I'm glad to have had such a unique experience. It smells exactly like the smoke produced by one method of usage of a particular recreational/medicinal drug which has been legalized in certain states, including Nevada. The burps also have that scent. Then I went for the Lagunitas Waldos' Special Ale, which is inspired by the group credited with creating the term 420, but certainly doesn't have as much of that ""dank"" quality. However, I still enjoyed the rich, relatively ""sweet"" flavor and would gladly order it again.

Food-wise, I mostly stuck to the aforementioned happy hour deals. They'll be more than enough to satisfy my palate next time I come here, although I wouldn't mind branching out.

The banh mi slider ($3) was surprisingly true to what you might expect if you miniaturized a grilled pork Vietnamese sandwich, including all the veggies, a small baguette, a hit of something spicy, and even mayonnaise. I won't make any claims due to my inebriated status, but I would order that again.

The fries ($3) were a gigantic portion of somewhat thickly cut potatoes, and I liked them despite most pieces ending up relatively soft. They came with one helping of ketchup and two helpings of something that's like a fry/special/secret sauce, but slightly different - a higher amount of horseradish, perhaps? I enjoyed them from start to end of meal, hot to cold (room temp).

The chicken wings ($5) came out with a less-than-ideal sauce, after the bartender defaulted to buffalo style without asking me for my choice, but I still enjoyed them. Five moist pieces arrived with a mild version of buffalo sauce, proper seasoning, and a moist if not juicy interior. The ranch and celery were therefore not strictly necessary, but they were fun. These aren't battered, but you'll be able to find enough carbs elsewhere I'm sure.

I was also able to try the special of the day in the food realm, namely 2 tacos for $4.20. They were pork belly ""chicharron"" tacos, and both came out with properly cooked(!) tortillas, which sometimes is a challenge for restaurants for some reason. The belly was rich in flavor and had crunchy bits, and the guacamole added enough creaminess to make it not so boring. Hopefully they'll consider making this a more permanent menu item.

Atmosphere was great, although I should disclaim that having the proper amount of beer makes every place pretty tolerable. It was on the louder side, but not so much that you couldn't hold a conversation. Service was pretty solid aside from denying me the chance to try some of the fancier chicken wing sauces (but I've decided to try those in the future already, so I'm not too bummed).

I will definitely return to 595 Craft and Kitchen, especially for weekday happy hour.

I hate deviled eggs. I like theirs. Deep fry anything I think I could at least try it... anything. I took one bite I was like this is yummy, and then I tasted the hard boiled egg, it's the texture really, but I highly recommend it to the deviled egg inclined.

Beer cheese and pretzels. It is hard to screw up a pretzel so, they nailed that. The beer cheese I had low expectations for. Just the perfect amount of beer flavor. Too many times I have had beer cheese that tastes like... just beer, not cheese at all. It was delightful.

Pork belly sandwich. I wish we would have got so much more of this. Delicious, tender belly. Tasty sauce and overall just a stellar experience without much expectation. 

THE VERDICT:
Go and get yourself some pork belly. The perfect amount of food for three people who weren't very hungry when they went, and it still tickled our stomach to the maximum. No leftovers and nothing was overly expensive. I don't know what the number 595 stands for... but you need it. Believe me. Okay... maybe not need.",Yxj8O3t-szlSK6zGETYUSQ,5,6,4,WiPpYHWsh7kMnerQLmnX7Q

I came to eat by myself on a late Sunday night, and Tristan, the server was very welcoming! I ordered a water and hot water, mentioned how I was feeling it a little in my throat, and she brought back this magical mix of hot water, honey, lemon, mint and ginger syrup. It was delicious, almost like a hotty toddy, mint mojito drink for a sore throat. She read my mind! Tristian was also helpful with helping me decide what to eat and what to expect. 

I got the house popcorn, which was furakaki that day, fried deviled eggs and house bhan mi. All was so good! It was a good portion, but since I was hungry, I finished it! Popcorn was perfectly flavored, not too strong or salty. Great to munch on. I've eaten  a lot of Bhan Mis, but this was one of the best! The baguette was warm, but not overly toasted, meat was tender and filling was flavorful. The fried deviled eggs was crispy, yet the yolk was smooth.

4529665,2017-08-24,0,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"Summary: Good service, dark industrial pub interior/atmosphere, good/great food depending on what you get.

Service was very friendly and attentive. I appreciated the advice on the poutines! While we ordered the bad ass chili poutine, we ended up with the beer cheese poutine. It wasn't the end of the world, since the beer cheese poutine was pretty good anyway.

I liked the industrial overhaul from what the Elements restaurant was, but I'm not a fan of the not well lit interior. I like to see my food, and my company, and it makes taking food pictures a lot more challenging (I realize that's a dumb reason :) ).

We ended up with beer cheese poutine, pork belly burger, and crispy chicken skins. Beer cheese poutine was tasty, even though it wasn't what we ordered, but it wasn't really a poutine, more like fries with cheese sauce. The crispy chicken skins were good, it wasn't greasy, but the sweet chili sauce it came with was a let down. The pork belly burger was the highlight of the meal. So. Delicious. Nothing needed to change about it.

The service was a little spotty. It took a while to place our drink order and get menus, but I'm assuming it's because they're new and not entirely organized. Food wise I had the Signature Banh Mi which was amazing. The flavors and spices were very well balanced and everything tasted very fresh.

You can find it easily, as you approach the intersection of Rainbow and Tropicana. I would describe this enterprise as a tap house featuring a great selection of craft beers.

During my last visit, I tried the ""furikake tuna burger"" ($14.00). For additional $3.00, I got a small salad. I've had tuna burgers at other restaurants. That said, the taste and texture was very good; the price point, relative to the portion, was fair. As for the salad, it wasn't just chopped lettuce. It was a quality bend of mixed greens, diced tomatoes and sliced cucumber.

The complete menu, along with pricing, is available on their website.

HOWEVER, this place had so many craft beers to choose from. Our server let us try samples until we could decide what to order. We even told her that we are a blonde ale fan and she knew immediately what to reach out for (Super chill and sweet). Each server checked up on us on a timely manner and it wasn't difficult to reach out to them even if the table/bar area is a bit segregated.

Now with the food, the fried deviled eggs were amazing. The crispiness with the soft boiled eggs were an amazing combination. The gochujang aioli wasn't super spicy and overpowering either. The pork belly banhmi had a nice jalapeno kick to it and the craft burger was extremely juicy.

Besides the sweltering daily humid heat of vegas this restaurant was nice and modern. The server was great and nice and she offered me suggestions of whats good. So I ended up getting the pork belly burger and accompanied it with a Belgian sour cherry beer for the drink. The pickled slaw they had on the pork belly and the sauce went pretty well with each other and the fries were crispy. I loved the Belgian sour cherry beer I got and everything from start to finish was great. This place definitely didn't disappoint and it was like a tall glass of shade in this desert heat. Being checked upon if everything was great led to some great service even though their were only a couple people there but mostly at the bar. Itll be one of my go to's when I visit vegas again so I can have a pork belly burger again and try another beer as well. Thanks guys,ajkFs7lzRaUTIA0R_k-nZA,1,0,5,ljypqPQER7JiYjHiLhgGIA

If he was busy I would have understood. Really small bar for 2 bartenders to run and still give shitty service. Only reason I gave 2 stars was because the USB shirt guy was awesome and came out at the end and actually provided customer service.

Clean, local, service on point and their food choices weren't the usual bar food you'd expect. 

Deviled eggs, chicken skins and Pork Belly Banh Mi? Excuse me, what?

I love the aura of a local bar. Everyone was there just to hang out and relax, maybe watch a game. Talk to each other and see what they're eating. lol. So chill. 

The last time I was there, we couldn't stop ordering the deviled eggs! Please try those! And it was the first time I tried the Pork Belly Bahn Mi. Tender and melts in your mouth and punches with flavor!

The prices were mouth dropping, affordable pricing but such quality with the food. I had the burger, tuna burger, and poutine. When I lived in Canada all I did was sample poutine and 595's is very very authentic tasting. They just need to add more cheese curds and they'll be solid! The burger and tuna was cooked to upmost perfection. Weird that I paid 2$ for ONE slice of bacon on my burger though.

Drinks ordered Mother Earth beer, powderfinger and after the gold rush. The after the gold rush drink was disgusting and the server was so so nice to me and offered his own drink called the Trinidad sour. THANK YOU ERIC!

The week after we took our in laws they loved it and have talked about going back constantly even though they live in Henderson. This place is awesome!! Great food and great drinks.

Unfortunately I can't give 5 stars due to a few days ago me and my husband brought our friends to have them try since they all live around the area as well.

We made sure we only used half of the table Incase other people showed up ( we know these places always have to share seats so not a big deal. However at the end of the night after buying drinks, apps, entrees, and more drinks and spending over 100$. We go to the restroom and as I am walking back to the table one of the waitress who didn't even help us rudely says "" are you already done we have people waiting you know"". We immediately get up pack up and leave my husband didn't get to even finish his beer he just ordered. I understand we were in the wrong here we should have tried to stand or go to the bar since we were only 4 at an 8 table but I have to say I was very disappointed in the way we were talked too.

The lack of lighting and the good drinks (per friends who drink) are your friends.

I've tried several dishes here...

Fried Deviled Eggs: 
Just what it is plus, a gochujang aioli dipping sauce. I think it's the dipping sauce that makes this salty. Eat without the dip and it's just fine. 3.5/5

Crispy Chicken Skins:
Lightly breaded chicken skins, deep-fried. Comes with a sweet chili dipping sauce. Possibly the best appetizer on their menu. Savory and crispy. 4/5

Beer Cheese:
Pretzels you dip into beer cheese. I didn't like this. I don't even know how to describe it other than add beer to Cheez Wiz and dip bread into it. 2/5

Banh Mi:
Pretty good but nothing spectacular. Comparable to banh mi you can get from Chinatown. 3/5

Pork Belly Burger:
I was under the impression I'd get like a pork belly sandwich. What I got instead was a thick beef patty topped with pork belly! Yum! But what was missing was the acidity to cut off the fattiness and richness of the beef and pork belly. Texture-wise, they could've added more crunch to this burger with some fresh crisp veggies. 3/5

Fries:
Really crunchy fried potatoes. Well-seasoned. I think they fry them twice to get the perfect crunch. Ask for regular ketchup if you don't want their salty dipping sauces. 4/5

Dynamite Crab Dip:
Chunks of imitation crab in sriracha aioli with a side of different types of bread/ cracker. I think they could've shredded the imitation crab a bit so when you scoop up some dip, you get a nice even ratio of crab and aioli instead of a big chunk of crab coated in aioli. 2/5

Vermicelli Noodle Salad:
Not sure why this is called a salad as there was not enough greens/ vegetables for it to count as a salad. You can add proteins to it like grilled garlic chicken, pork belly, etc for a few bucks more. The dressing is watery, vinegary and has a nice spicy kick to it - it goes well with the dish. 3/5

Furikake Tuna Burger: 
Ground tuna patty - yeah, I don't like the thought of that. I'd have to skip writing about this.

Hot Fried Chicken Sandwich:
Crispy fried chicken.

Chocolate Budino:
Bittersweet chocolate that's smooth and creamy. 

As you can tell, I just got lazy towards the end of this review. This place isn't as exciting as the other reviews make it seem.

Pros:
The warm buratta cheese dip is AMAZING! It comes with crispy pita and chips (a variety with some being salty and some being bland).
The staff is friendly and easy going.
Great selection of beers especially since they have some sour ales (a favorite of mine!)

Cons:
The table was messy like sticky messy. Whoever is cleaning kind of need to be aware of that.
The seating area was small so if you have a party of more than 4 be aware because you may need to grab two tables.
Burgers were just mediocre which is negative because if in paying 10-15$ for a burger I expect it to be different than whataburger. Not bad but nothing special.
Fries are 7$??.... that seems kinda high to me but that's my opinion.

Overall dinner cost 60$ for two people getting burgers ... too pricy in my opinion. I'd check it out simply because of the beer selection though!",0aGMVKiNqmY1kCc5983UkQ,4,1,3,o2gb4ennFBzmb1sbIpeiEA

One day, I went there by myself after work and I had an order of chicken wings that didn't agree with me.  I noticed it was bloody inside, sent it back to the kitchen and they voided it.  Mind you, I work in a restaurant on the strip and using a thermometer prior to sending out an order of chicken wings will save you the headache.  I had chicken wings here before and when it's not busy without no issues. Things happen when your busy with happy hour and it being a newer restaurant.  Please don't justify your not wrong by telling the server/bartender to tell you the temperature it came out after my wings were served bloody inside.  If you have a oven and a warmer, please pre bake your wings in the oven, hold it in a warmer, and then fry the wings to order will solve that issue.

The tuna burger was just okay, but I really liked the Craft Burger. During happy hour, I like getting the Bahn Mi slider and my boyfriend LOVES the Chicken Skins, which I personally don't like, as it basically tastes like all fried breading and barely any actual chicken skin. 

On nice days out, they slide the windows up so you can feel some breeze, adding some more *chill* to the bar. They also have wifi, games (like Cards Against Humanity, Cranium playing cards), and coloring books!",2aQUl1yFzfim7WWi-g2D-w,0,0,4,WnXR3e4peKZdMF3HTSs2gg

Well 595 has all three with out a doubt. 24 taps of Stouts, ales, IPA's, Sours, constantly changing line up of kegs so always something new to sink your taste buds into. Now for the really ""cool"" part. The bar counter top has an ice cold steel rail built into it that you set your beer glass on top of to keep you drink ice cold.(I've included pictures) I've only seen this at one other bar before (in Salt Lake City) I can't believe more places haven't incorporated this awesome experience enhancing addition. 
 The bar and table area is not too big so it can fill up fast. We were in on a Saturday evening and it started out real quiet but a few hours in and the place was bustling. People laughing, drinking, eating and having a good time. The decor is pub style, clean and comfortable. Two unisex bathrooms that are well kept also.  
 The food menu is just the right size and will satisfy the hardiest of beer munchies. Items range from finger foods, salads, Springs rolls, nachos to unique sandwich and burger choices. Tonight we snacked on the Thai hummus appetizer (flavor explosion )while sipping on bar tender recommended IPA's. 
 The whole staff seemed to take on any duty necessary to keep everyone eating, drinking and having a good time. I especially enjoy that there is no video poker and that they're not just another run of the mill, cookie cutter, average, smoke filled Vegas strip mall bar. 
 Unique, fun and satisfying. Get down and get join the party for yourself. What are you waiting for!!!?????",DYNHc9IxYwdJuGuC4bvpAw,3,3,5,7Mx-0cQGYmvAYdIxrpMNcA

The Thai Cashew Hummus was REALLY good. A little spicy and different than anything I've had before. They give you quite a lot. I would definitely go back just for this hummus.

Beer Cheese Poutine is definitely an appetizer to share. So good though!

Crispy Chicken Skins were a nice snack, but the batter was a little to heavy for my liking. A little less and it would have been perfect.

I do not recommend getting the wings if you're expecting Gochujang flavor because it definitely was NOT that. They were ok, a little too dry. The buffalo wasn't anything special. I asked for a side of Hoison sambal sauce because I was curious what it tasted like. NOT like Hoison at all. it was too vinegary and I did not like it.

Beef Brisket Banh Mi was also a tad dry. Pouring some of the chili sauce from the Chicken Skin helped make it much better. So I'd recommend asking for some on the side if that's the case for you.

Surprisingly we didn't try any of the beers. I'd definitely come back for some of the food we liked and to try some beers.",4QbBRaY_L1OhS-CfYIKBmw,0,0,4,G1XEwupoQfi8Funl6Db-BA

A very large portion, each bite perfectly crispy and seasoned (salty with a slight kick).  The batter is light and crunchy and paired with a sweet chili sauce.  This was definitely a great side to my furikake tuna burger.  The tuna burger was quite possibly just slightly under seasoned for my taste but seared perfectly.  To clarify, one review scared me when they mentioned ground tuna....the tuna was a seared tuna steak cut into slices...no ground tuna here.  I thought the garlic aioli, arugula, heirloom tomatoes, and shitake mushrooms were a perfect pairing for the tuna.  
I might see if they can turn this into a salad for me next time, the bun was a little underwhelming.  The chicken skins were so good, I wanted to shove them inside my tuna burger....  My husband got the loco moco poutine, opting for the hamburger patty.  I sampled a fry with the gravy and the gravy was on point.

595 was highly anticipated and much needed in the area. The menu is great and the food is delicious. This is a fantastic place to enjoy craft beers and they are very supportive of local breweries. They also regularly host the local beer community for bottle shares and special events.

The reason they don't get 4 stars or more from me (yet) is because of the service. The 1st time I was in there was for a bottle share, which had been planned pretty far in advance. The server who was scheduled to work that day had apparently called in (which is no fault of the restaurants, that stuff happens). In a pinch, they had the wife (I think) of the Manager fill in. It didn't go so well, unfortunately. She wasn't familiar with the beers and we ended up with not 1, but 2 issues with our bill. She charged us for someone elses tab.

Anyhow, it wasn't a major deal breaker - I would still consider them a new place with some kinks to work out, but overall it's a great vibe and we need more places like this in town. Definitely check it out if you get a chance.",rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,3,2,3,IdN6W_sjzH3qoPdwF2l38Q
5688122,2018-05-21,1,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"So far I'm here because 1. I realized my first review was very shallow and I can't understand why as usually I go into detail in regards to review. 

Also, I had take out last time which I failed to mention. 

So I thought to myself , well that is not cool. I decided to come in again by myself so I could really soak up the experience. 

One of the first question I ask the lady at the bar in regards to the Poutine was ""How is it prepared ?"" 

She hit me back with a side look and said ""what do you mean?"" And just stared at me a bit. 

She then said ""fries , Gravy a fried egg scallions. "" 

...... so far I'm displeased just by her asinine attitude. 

The crowd at the present are mostly middle aged or late 40's. 

So while I appreciate that you went into great detail being the public representative of your company I'd more so appreciate a person who isn't obviously miserable to be here at her job. 

I deal with many people through out the day and she isn't as welcoming or informative as me id like, however I'll not dote on. 

She asked me what type of wings did I want I said I didn't know she told me the selection. She said what she liked best so I decided to pick those. 

So now I await my poutine and these wings made with a Korean marinade with Hoysen and gochujang. 


I'm Korean so I'm taking her suggestion. I'm also understanding so I'm not going to assume this will be the attitude for the remainder of my meal. 

I do dish off a heavy attitude myself when disrespect is concerned. 

I'll brb.

Ok as far as the wings and using Korean ingredients. I'd honestly love for them to have more flavor. Korean food is well known for being super flavorful. 

They weren't horrible they just didn't hit that high peak of Asian expectations I have when using my homeland ingredients. 

I'd love to come in and show you the best way to prepare these to be honest. 

Also the poutine was much better. The fries were freshly made. The gravy is way too thick in my opinion. The curds were perfectly melted as opposed to my ice cold curds I had prior. 

Overall the atmosphere was super chill. Everyone was enjoying the Golden Knights game , the bar maid's attitude didn't bug me as much as she seemingly is there only for the drinkers and I was sitting at the bar. 

The quality of the food is good and I only had a few things. I took some hummus to go and even though we are super Asian we just could not get past all the sweet notes and how you pair it with cracker or pita bread. 

I think some veggies with that sort of hummus would be spot on. It wasn't as velvety as I like my hummus, which does tell you they make it in-house yet they could work on the texture a bit.",I-A5Ho70uwJWZWiZRgnNmg,0,2,4,G4f1J9ZjdhXm4qkEppVO_w

We ordered the brisket banh mi and a burger for the lady with fries. The brisket was $11 with an extra $3 for a side salad. The burger was around the same. The burger came out and was good but small and overpowered by the lettuce on top. The brisket sandwich lacked any brisket. A $11 brisket sandwich should have more than one layer of brisket. It also didn't complement the bread (which was good). The bread was large and at least three times the height of the brisket which further made the lack of brisket even more significant. The sandwich had good flavors but ultimately would have been happier eating at subway.  Hopefully they're able to add some more meat to that sad sad brisket sandwich.

The food was pretty average in terms of bar food.  I really liked that they try to make it funky and fun but I think the execution is off.   For example, the fried chicken skin and the crab dip were so salty that even my beer couldn't tame the salt but the cabbage salad was seriously lacking in flavor.   That item was close to being my favorite if it only had some seasoning or pizzazz.   

I was surprised at the portion size of everything.  They were very large for the pricing in my opinion. 

The service was ok too.   You seat yourself which is fun but it also means you wait a hot second for the server especially if it's busy.

Place is super cute, and I love the aesthetic.

Service is super friendly and I loved that our server was very attentive, but I would've appreciated a little more space and time to ponder the menu and enjoy our meal. Otherwise, she gave some great recommendations and was knowledgeable about the menu.

I really enjoyed the fried deviled eggs. Super original and delicious idea. I was super skeptical, but it wasn't greasy at all. Plus, the breading was very well done.

I was not a fan of the heirloom tomato salad. I thought the food quality was good, but I wasn't a fan of the dressing. Something about it reminded me of barbecue sauce, but my boyfriend loved it, so I think it's just up to preference. 

My boyfriend loved the signature banh mi. He thought the pork was amazing and said it was the best Viet sandwich he ever had.

After observing the menu and getting feed back on the food, I decided I definitely wanted to try the Deep fried devil eggs and Vermicelli Noodle salad, they said the dressing would be worth it. Boy was he right Themis salad was so good, the dressing amplified the greens and I am a sucker for noodles.  I would definitely recommend the salad and the Deviled eggs was a good starter, it had a unique flavor and the textures was good, I even try dipping it In my dressing and it was soooooo good. 
Another recommendation was the bread pudding of the day- so of course I had to jump in dessert, the current flavor was Reese Peanut Butter cup, and boy was it good, I loved the cream and sauce m, it was a perfect balance and it was moist and not soggy, so the texture and flavor was in point.

5913305,2017-06-27,0,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"Came here on a Sunday evening.  

I had the noodle salad topped with egg and seared pork belly.  My friend and I also shared the popcorn of-the-day: kochujang and honey.  

The popcorn was a little overly ""wet"" or mushy which I guess was to be expected when mixing it with honey and spicy bean paste.  But we did not get a choice on what kind of popcorn we wanted.  After about halfway in, it became too salty for our palate.  I understand the need to be unique and the blending of flavors, but to me it did not work.

The ""noodle salad"" was reminiscent of the Vietnamese ""bun"" dishes at any pho restaurant.  I thought the chef might have been going for some type of fusion--so naturally I expected more melding of differing flavors East and West.  I saw none of that.  It really looked like an imitation of a pricier and less authentic bun dish.  The noodles used were a bit stiffer and slightly chewier than the vermicelli used in pho restaurants.  Despite the menu's description, it didn't taste any better.   It also got saltier towards the bottom of the bowl.  In a pho restaurant you can add as much of the sweet/savory nam pla as you want, but here it's added when prepped.  It's also more saltier than your traditional nam pla fish sauce.  

The pork belly was cooked fairly well--tender and semi-moist.  

They had 1 waitress and 1 or 2 bartenders.  Service got slow when the relatively small dining area filled up to about 50-75% capacity.  We were checked up on once after the main course was dropped.   I didn't use the bathrooms, but my friend said they were very clean and immaculate.

We will def be back to eat more of that and try the rest of the menu.",Y5Hl2fhl4OKvIckphulpEg,5,2,5,3bGFFjG5YJt3xBzIQWIgTA

5959891,2017-11-04,2,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"595 Craft and Kitchen has quickly won a place in my heart. Serving up an intriguingly tasty variety of dishes, they have everything from banh mi to deep fried deviled eggs. I haven't had a single dish that wasn't exceptional and made with love. The burgers are juicy and flavorful, their chicken sandwiches are spicy and fried to perfection and even their popcorn is enhanced with beautifully creative flavors. 

What makes this place even better is their ever rotating selections of beer. Focusing on craft beers from all over they carry some of my local favorites as well as breweries from out of state that are exceptional. 

Service is always on point as well. Friendly staff, delicious food and a lovely beer selection has easily made this one of my favorite new spots!",UYcmGbelzRa0Q6JqzLoguw,9,11,5,sMheRcYFWIQZLFFmfpq27w
5963840,2018-01-10,0,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,I've been wanting to check this place out for awhile and finally popped in for a drink with a group. We sat at the bar and the bartender was very chatty and fun. I had the rum based cocktail I can't remember the name but it was very strong and so good! Not so strong it tastes like pure liquor but not sweet either. Delish. I then had fried chicken skins and shared the fried deviled eggs they were so yummy. I think this will be a fun to hang out to come to and they have a good deal on happy hour,RXSFT4K09Ta6oTdrvFGmCA,0,0,5,kt1OoDGeV5vhDk3Q7jyDkw

Had a good beer that I wouldn't have normally tried. I'll definitely return for more fries with different toppings. :-) hopefully on a second date!,4IVtQfL1jRv_83y46eiY5Q,1,0,5,bOqwy0y-oqKwa9oi-UiADg
5996392,2017-06-23,1,ZG8PZgaMKhdJUpNxkc9Diw,"Came here tonight for dinner. Saw on yelp it is a recently opened business and wanted to try something new. Inside the ambience is casual and the first thing you see when you walk in is a bar area go the right and then seating area to the left. 

It's self seating and the bar was full so we chose to sit in a small table for four. It took a little while to get our drink order. I ordered an apricot cider which was a bit sour but good. My glass had some lipstick stain on it and I was not wearing any lipstick so I had to send it back unfortunately. The waitress was very apologetic and was happy to get me a new glass. 

The food was good. We got fried chicken skins and dynamite crab dip for appetizers. The crab dip was pretty good and had a kick to it. The chicken skins were good and reminded me of calamari but everyone on yelp raved about it so far so we had to give it a try. 

I ordered the signature banh mi. It was okay. Not the banh mi I'm used to but the bread was soft which I liked. My husband got a pork belly burger and he ate that all up. 

Overall, we had a good experience and will most likely come back to try other things on their menu.the random Buffalo head adds a nice touch to the place since it's the only decoration they have on the wall.",P0rGN5mDue55uIiAzkrRlw,5,4,4,hcgipEeyTfel4iT6ObCmkw
