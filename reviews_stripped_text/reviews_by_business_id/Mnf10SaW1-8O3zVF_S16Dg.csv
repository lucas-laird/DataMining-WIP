I like the BBQ sauce, and the fries (steak) were really good.  I don't usually like steak fries, but these were nice and crispy.  The ribs, however, were really fatty.  May have just been a bad slab, but quality control should have kicked in before they ever made it to my table.  All in all, nothing special.",Fnzdbnl-Myzl3Ug_eLnRcw,0,0,3,zzZel6aux6ipkjuJArGiMw

It wasn't very crowded but the waitress rarely visited our table, didn't refill drinks and brought food for my friends that was almost room temperature. My friends were halfway through their meals when my food came and a friends fries to go with wings. 

The wings tasted good to me but were not hot, my friend said the chili in the bread bowl was bland, my french dip came out with one side soggy and the so called parmesan fries were fries with way too much dry parmesan cheese on top. I thought parmesan fries would be tossed in parmesan and then fried. They weren't very good. 

Our waitress had cleaned a nearby table dropped some items off her tray one of them being a reddish brown sauce of some kind that spilled all over my and my friend sitting next to me who was wearing white. I had so many spots on my shirt, sauce running down my leg and so did my friend. The waitress nonchalantly apologized and brought out wet napkins but took way too long to do so, we had already been cleaning ourselves with napkins and water. No manager ever came by to smooth things over which I thought was strange. So after we paid the bill I got the managers attention to tell him what happened. He then apologized but didn't offer us anything. I wasn't intending to ask for money off or for anything free but i've had lesser problems at restaurants and recieved a better response from the manager. 

So I wouldn't visit this place again as the service was bad, and the food wasn't good.",WITw6s1LS5tOd583_klnnA,1,0,1,nu9JVdPqHAI4DumSC0zuXQ

This place to-date is by far one of the best places to go to watch sports.  We were watching several games simultaneously and loving it.  The food we ordered was great as well.  I am a vegetarian and got the portabella philly and it was tasty.  My friend ordered the typical sports diet of pizza and wings and enjoyed it.  

I would have given the place a higher rating but the waiter ignored and did not acknowledge that I told her we were there for my friends birthday.  The drinks were weak and sadly the service was slow and did not warrant the 20% I kindly gave her.

463785,2012-03-28,0,Mnf10SaW1-8O3zVF_S16Dg,"Went here for a pretty late dinner. We were looking for something quick and filling that won't bust the wallet.

Food: 
- Chicken & Ribs: Actually pretty good. Chicken is tender and juicy, ribs were well cooked and the bbq sauce was pretty good and had a bit of a kick. Fries are decent. In case you can't figure out from menu description, with half a rack of ribs, half chicken, and fries on top of that, this is a big plate. 
- Fussili Marinara: Good while it was hot. Bleh after it cools. Grilled chicken addition not recommended -- it was bland and sort of rubbery. Plus the pasta itself is plenty of food (with the chicken & bread, I could've split it into 3 light meals or 2 big ones). Accompanying garlic bread was pretty good. It was the only thing I thought worth eating after pasta is no longer hot.

So, definitely quick and filling. While price is not bad for what you get (decent food and lots of food), you (or at least we) could really do without the humongous portions. With a hotel room that doesn't have fridge space (it's all used up by the bar), leftovers are useless to us.

What i like most about this place and what IMO set it above the average sports bar is the friendly, efficient service and reasonable prices.

As for food we had the happy hour special nachos. They were a large portion for $4 but the processed cheese it came with was disgusting and it was not worth it. 

We also had dessert and it was pretty standard but huge portions.

We did not have dinner so I can't comment on that. It is definitely a great place to drink beer and watch the game.

My most up to date visit came in March of 2011 and felt indifferent about it. First, I want to start off by saying that it was Sunday, during the 2011 March Madness Tournament and they were extremely busy and I was apart of a group of about 10 or 12. Two of my friends were pretty intoxicated and did not make it easy for our wait staff.

With that being said, I ordered a NY Strip (med rare) and it took a long time to come up. When it did finally come up, it was over done and cold. I waited a few minutes for our server to come back, but it being so busy I understood why she had been gone. I finally decided to get up and try to find a manager, when she walked up. I explained what was wrong to her and she apologized and said she would take care of it. My second steak came out a lot quicker and was to my liking. 

All in all, this is a great place to catch whatever game your trying to watch. On busy game days, stay away from the bigger items and opt for something simple along the lines of a sandwich, burger, nachos, etc etc.",h-oHdcEJ3Ke7WmWGa2KJRg,0,0,3,xAizBeY6Z9y6rQHiKIDdcg

I told the bartenders how I was ignored and snubbed over at Gonzalez y Gonzalez. They seemed geniunely surprised.

I perused the menu and the lady bartender recommended the prime rib special. Sounded good to me. I asked for it rare and she said there might not be any rare slices left, but she'd see what she could do.

Nice friendly banter from the bartenders. They made me forget my grouchy. When the prime rib arrived (in a few short minutes), I was happy to see a perfectly pink, rare piece of beef saddled up next to a generous scoop of mashies.

Granted, it wasn't the greatest prime rib I've ever had, but it was served quickly and with the kind of attitude that made me feel like my business was truly appreciated.

There were several dozen flatscreens mounted behind the bar. Certainly enough TV sports action to hold my attention while stuffing my face with tasty, tasty beef.

A group of friends and I decided to watch a 1:30 game here. There were no spots available for a group of 10 on the first floor so we decided to try upstairs. When we sat down we asked the waitress which screen the game we wanted to watch was going to be playing on. She informed us that it would be one of the smaller screens in front of us. As soon as the game started someone changed the channel to a different game. We asked if it could be changed back to the channel it was on before, but the waitress said there was nothing she could do.  She was kind enough to bring out the manager for us to speak to. Now at this point it's a group of 10 of us plus a family of six in front of us that want to watch the same game. We pleaded our case to the manager, Matt, who was extremely rude and stand-offish. He ended up throwing his hands up in the air and walking away leaving us in mid sentence. Now up until this point, our experience there was average. The waitress was very attentive and friendly, but some of our food items came out cold. After speaking to Matt the manager we asked if there was anyone else we could speak to. A different manager came out and in a more polite manner told us the same thing. We asked if we could close out our tab and requested that he speak to Matt on his customer service skills and maybe look into a different system of how to organize the way that the games are displayed so that this type of incident doesn't happen again. I'm not the type of person to complain but when two separate tables, 16 people total, request to have one tv screen changed to the game they want to watch, it makes lots of business sense to grant those request.

It was really really good and they didn't skimp on any of the good stuff!  The portions are large and definitely could have been split between two people.  

We also ordered fried cheese curds, baja fish burrito, california turkey burger, and cheese filled meatballs and spaghetti.  Overall everyone thought their food was pretty good.  The only complaint was the spaghetti and meatballs.  Apparently the meatballs were a little dry and the spaghetti sauce was a bit acidic for her tastes.

In the main area, on the two big screens, they were featturing the College Baseball ""world"" series (understandably), and then they were featuring Golf's US Open (WTF!?!?!?). I guess it had started before the soccer game and there was some golf fans.
HOWEVER, There were more of us Soccer fans and they would not change the channel for us. I asked if they can have it at the bar area, and they told me that they were going to have the baseball game there too. WTF!!!!
Then what really pissed me off was finding out that the place was featuring the Mexico vs Guatemala the day before. 
The Gold Cup is our regional championship and it is being hosted in the United States. I find the lack of disrespect towards us soccer fans to be an outrage especially since it was OUR NATIONAL TEAM which was playing. No offense, but most people don't care to watch a boring game of golf. Like I said, they had fans, but they could have moved Golf to a smaller screen and let most of the customers enjoy our game.

Looks like it's a nice place, but our service was bad. I didn't get my food well into the second half of the game. It was a day time game. Perhaps if it was a nighttime featuring a real competitive game or fight the place could have been better.",ieML9K5gdVWetSEFP3ct4Q,0,0,2,X8vx-tfU-lKr9YGih3qYkA

we still just got appetizers cause their food were pretty pricey. I had the nachos for $8.95 added pieces of steak for $4 more. it was a huge plate of tortilla chips and what looked like a lot of toppings on top but after eating a few chips i noticed that there was way too much chips and not enough toppings, also I noticed that there wasn't a lot of pieces of steak so i would recommend no even adding the steak and it tasted pretty plain. we also had the waffle cheese fries which was loaded with chili, cheese, and bacon for $10.95. this was also a huge plate but again not a lot of flavor. last was buffalo wings for $10.95. they were kinda small size and had about 8 wings, pretty salty and over cooked, came with two small sticks of carrots and celery. 

their beers are around $7 typical for the strip. 

overall the food is OK just needed more flavor its like eating a huge bag of plain popcorn it'll get you full but you wont be satisfied. 

i do like that they have a lot of TVs showing all the baseball games. some booths even have a their own TVs. you can sit in a recliner instead of at a table or booth. above average sports bar restaurant design and environment. 

they did get irritating towards the end cause they kept asking us if we needed anything else, if we needed a container for our food, for the bill etc we had a lot of food in out plates still and were just enjoy our foods watching the games.

2387741,2012-11-11,0,Mnf10SaW1-8O3zVF_S16Dg,"I think this place is a wonderful place to catch a game if your trip to LV happens to coincide with the big game (which my happened to be) a few weeks ago.

Located in the New York, New York Casino, the restaurant is situated next to the area where sports bets can be made.

Once you arrive, the hostess asks if you are here to watch a major game and they will give you options of locations to watch it. If you watch it in the bar area you don't need to spend a minimum/person but if you want to eat in the restaurant area, they have a $15/person minimum per hour that they keep tabs on.

I understand this policy because it dissuades customers to come here and hog a booth ordering only one beer. 

Our party was seated in one of the booths facing the huge mural of TV screens. The personal booths had built in speaker systems and a personal TV screen on the table. You could pick the different feeds labeled clearly from the mural to be transmitted to your own TV so it was extremely easy to catch different games at the same time. It's the perfect set-up for any sports fan or sports fan's girlfriend :)

Once we were seated at the booth, we clarified the $15/person/hour policy with our server who was extremely professional and nice.  The $15/person policy is making sure you order about that much in food and drink per hour but she's not going to be too strict with it. (E.G. make sure it's $15/hour on the dot) 

The menu itself is pretty standard sports-bar food with burgers, sandwiches, salads and appetizers. Everything we ordered was pretty well made so I have no complaints there.

The pizza was especially well made with a great chewy crust!

The chips in the Nachos seemed housemade and it was perfectly crisp.

Overall, I would definitely venture back here if my goal was to watch a game. I don't think I would come here purely for food though since there are so many yummy and unique options on the Strip.

The hostess was rather cold and uncaring but the servers were all extremely helpful and efficient.

There's a storefront located near the entrance of the restaurant that sells sports souvenirs and trinkets of most of the major teams.",aY7Tuiui3BbrLGgVpgziZA,4,0,4,159Qgf7Suzt32zsRzl-BVA

Also, it was my birthday and my friends told me later that they tried to get something--you know birthday song, a tiny scoop of ice cream, shoot a paid dessert with a candle in it.  The most they would do is put a generic greeting on the sports ticker.  It was unique but the message wasn't even personalized.  The message kept scrolling throughout our meal and halfway through a second birthday greeting to someone else ran right behind my greeting.  Honestly, I feel worse for the poor soul whose greeting had to follow my greeting every time.

My buddy and I shared the Tailgate Party Platter which included a quesadilla, hot wings, buffalo wings, four sliders, artichoke dip and chips and some pork ribletts.  The quesadilla and artichoke dip were disappointing.  The cheese had cooled and wasn't very stringy or tasty.  The sliders were well done and the meat off the ribletts came right off the bone.  The hot wings were good, but nothing special, while I thought the buffalo wings were sub-par.

Bottom line:  I think this place is past it's prime.  I remember trying to get in when it was the ESPN Zone in 2007 and it was packed.

We both felt that Kevin, our waiter, had done us a great service and left a big tip....in hindsight we should have add the $20 we saved. I'll keep an eye out for him in the New Year.

In terms of atmosphere, if you think you are going to watch your favorite team play think again. Restaurant dictates what games they show and do not accept customer request. Waitress actually lied when I asked and said they don't have a specific channel in the main dining room that they had in the bar.

Since NY/NY was right across the st from MGM (and it's still a hefty walk) we decided to check it out. Reading previous reviews we realized it was a ESPNZone before it became The Sporting House Bar & Grill. Anyway, we sat down at the bar that was full of TV's. Place wasn't all that busy and our server was prompt/friendly. For apps we ordered wings. They were eh. Breaded, drenched in buffalo sauce and not all that great. Kind of tasted the freezer burn. For a meal everyone ordered burgers. The meat was solid, the bun - not so much. Saturated in grease but the burger itself made up for the lack of bun power. Their prices were reasonable and what was even better is that they had all the NJ/NY local games on (without requesting it). 
If I was from the area, definitely a cool place to catch a Sunday game...

Actually, what better way to celebrate my Spartan review (you know... 300) than with a post-Rock N Roll Wine recovery session with the Sambalatte diva, Thao T, and the one and only Misti Yelp (yes, that's her actual last name).

Truth be told, it's not just a generic sports bar on the strip. It used to be the ESPNZone. While it no longer bears the ESPN name, it seems to have retained all of the features. There are a plethora of HD screens to catch your favorite team and the upstairs game area is intact. In fact, this place may be the closest thing we have to a Dave & Buster's. (There's also Gameworks across the street, but I haven't been there in years).

On this visit, we were just interested in some grub. I wasn't that hungry, but I went with a plate of Honey Hoisin Chicken Wings. They were surprisingly delicious - sweet but with a nice spicy kick on the tail end. Thao ordered a Three Cheese Quesadilla with Chicken. I tried some and it was pretty standard but flavorful. Misti ordered some Garlic Steak Fries that just also happened to come with a California Turkey Burger. Clearly, she was enamored with the pommes frites.

I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place, but it's nice to know it exists. I'm almost never in the New York New York, but if I am, The Sporting House is worth a revisit.",YwaKGmRNnSa3R3N4Hf9jLw,2,2,3,taIm8dx8QbTpEhgjr3meyA

It came back probably medium but I just ate it. My boyfriend got his medium it came out well done as well but he just ate it. It was really good and the mushroom sauce was awesome. Overall I enjoyed my meal as did my boyfriend.

Beyond that, it's only okay.

First the positive - the beer selection is fine enough for a sports bar, and the prices are good for the strip. Craft beers are $10 for a 24 oz, which is about as good as you can hope for. 

From there, it's all disappointing. The service was not rude, but not terribly friendly either. She was slow, inefficient, and dragged things out. We also grabbed some appetizers, most notably nachos, that came out fast enough but were extremely disappointing. The equivalent of cheap nacho cheese, plain chips. Also, an added $4 for steak that wasn't huge on quantity or quality.

The one star is just for the fish and chips (15.95), which was fresh and fried perfectly.  Everything else we ate seemed to be defrosted and cooked in a microwave, hence the comparison to some restaurants on the shows.  Our server was Wendy, who made it very obvious she did not want to serve us, maybe we were not her type???  We were one of few tables there for a date night.  The Lakers game was on and even though the small screen at our table did not work we were still able to watch both a basketball and hockey game on the larger screens.  It was not busy so Wendy apologized for taking so long to take our order.  She recommended the Grand Slam cocktail ($10) which did not even give me a buzz, I think they forgot to throw the alcohol in it.  We also ordered fish and chips and the large sampler appetizer ($39.99 and so not worth a dime).  This is one of the restaurants where the waitress takes the order and brings drinks and everything else is done by someone else, I always wonder how the tipping works since the waitress does not do much of anything.  It took over 45 minute for the food to come out.  During this time, others were seated at the booths behind and in front of us.  Wendy took extra good care of them, they all got their food before us and some even finished before our food came.  She would check on each table, skip us and not even offer a refill on the bf's soda.  When our food arrived, it looked horrible.  Buffalo wings both boneless and bone in looked like it was the pre-seasoned frozen and microwaved out of a bag.  Cheese curds were soggy.  Riblets were also microwaved.  Chips were stale and the spinach artichoke dip had maybe one artichoke leaf in it, some spinach and the rest was all microwaved cheese and the grease layer had risen to the top, the dish never hit the burner.  We were using a comp so we did not have to pay which was good.  Since Wendy ignored us, we did not leave her a tip.  We dined at a different restaurant in the same casino during the week and left a big tip.  It is not that we are cheap, but tips are not mandatory, especially for horrible service.  Everyone is entitled to their personal opinion about people, but it should not come out as so obvious to customers in a restaurant, since the key to restaurant success is all due to customers.  One star is just for the fish and chips, good, but not so good that we would return.  If the comps were a way of promoting restaurants in this casino, they should take this one off the list.",p3rQEm0gp2UsR4Rwh6FirA,1,1,1,bLqa1FIYWKgfSAJnBLkgLg

It had been a while since I had seen a nice, wide steak fry, and when I realized they were smothered in garlic, my stomach grinned. They were the ideal thing for soaking up the buckets of wine I had just consumed at the Rock N Roll Wine bash. I can still taste the garlic today!

The garlic fries came with a turkey burger, and once again, I was pleasantly surprised. The burger was topped with avocado and jalapenos. The little additions impressed me! Plus, the burger had vegetables in the patty, and the bun was big and soft. It was a tasty little turkey, and it cost me $11.95. 

It could have been the wine talking, but I thought for bar food, it was getting the job done well. My only concern was just how healthy these creations were for me, but hey, I was trying to soak up some wine. I am sure all that resveratrol canceled out something.  

With 130 high-definition televisions, I am pretty sure you won't miss any game. They apparently have FREE WIFI, and their premium draft selection was nice, including a local Tenaya Creek Hef. 

Service was friendly and quick, but he didn't let us know that they give 20% off with valid Nevada ID! (That is what their website says.) That's a good thing, but only if you happen to know about it!

I probably wouldn't head back there routinely, but if I happen to be at NYNY or suggesting a good place to catch a game, this is a solid call.",qewG3X2O4X6JKskxyyqFwQ,9,8,4,c8tURbWs3OlD_VWwIM0mMQ

I got into town and wanted to see the Packers-Raiders game, the place was packed and I was somehow able to get seats at the bar. There are a ton of TVs here so you should be able to see your game from anywhere. 

Jeni is an awesome bartender! She's friendly and gave me samples of a couple different beers before I made my selection. She even promised to put the Capitals game on a few days later if we made it back (sorry, Jeni, we'll be back next trip). I tried the fried zucchini which wasn't greasy and I would recommend as it's much better than it sounds.

BBQ Chicken Wings - We were going to get buffalo wings, but our waiter suggested the BBQ ones since that's what they're known for. They were good, but nothing extraordinary. I guess he hyped it up too much? Idk. Ended up trying my friend's buffalo wings later. Not bad either. I guess it's just whatever you're in the mood for.

Chicken Tenders - What a MISTAKE! You'd think...can't go wrong with chicken tenders, right? Well, not here. We didn't like them at all. I enjoyed the celery/carrot sticks more. On our second round of food, we made sure not to get this again.

Fries - Just fries. Nothing special about them. 

Luckily, our waiter was super super cool! He forgot some orders a couple times while we were there...but we were there for a longggggg time, so it wasn't that big of a deal to me.

We went here in need of a good bite to eat in order to effectively continuing partying in Vegas, and by partying I mean drinking. In doing so, we stumbled upon The Sporting House Bar and Grill. The menu was relatively full of a variety of options from burgers to nachos to fettuccine Alfredo. In addition, beers were a must as alcohol and sports bars go hand in hand. 

Our waiter was pretty cool, laid back and knew what he was doing. We all ordered our own meals but the usual meal was a sandwich or burger. Personally, i favored ordering a Philly Cheese Steak which came with french fries. The Cheesesteak itself was very delicious although i was a bit upset i only received about 10 french fries. The cost of this meal was $11 but i feel that it was well worth it as the Cheesesteak was a nice size. 

I was told there was also an arcade upstairs which is pretty cool. The 130 HD Tvs are also incredible, but it would be cooler if they had a variety of sports on and not the same game all over the place, for example, the Royals vs the Angels game were on while other games were also in progress i.e. San Francisco vs. Cincinnati Reds and the fantastic walk off win.

Others might say ""well they have beer"" and while that certainly can help, so do most bars so there's more to it than that!

As a result, and also partially because I'm determined to use some unusual adjective to describe this phenomenon I'll just go with, I seem to have some kind of odd simpatico with sporting bars!

Part of it is definitely that when I'm in the mood I just enjoy the general emotion, noise and fast paced atmosphere of these places.  I have a stressful work life, and these places seem to help me to disconnect from that for a bit in a way that other places just don't - it might sound odd, but believe me it actually works (for me at least) and in the case of the visit here I was just starting a well needed vacation.
