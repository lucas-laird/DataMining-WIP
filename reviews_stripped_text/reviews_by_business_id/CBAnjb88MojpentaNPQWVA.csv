But they also do have plain dogs to dress as you like and the Chicago dog which I had which was good. Also tried the carne asada fries and the fried pickles, both are excellent.",reDk21yGrkUGAVZx4Fg8Tw,0,0,5,gJElkQuGcfYsz27c1iCzFg

348707,2014-06-16,0,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,Since I was craving a hot dog place I decided to yell a nearby locations and this popped up. I'm fan of komex so a korean hot dog fusion seemed interesting. The staff was nice and informative when I asked for suggestions. I ordered the bulgogi hot dog and the soul to Seoul order of chicken wings. the flavors of the bulgogi dog meshed well together and was a great combination. the bun was soft and chewy and the toppings were well spread out and distributed along the hot dog. one suggestion though was although the hot dog  was tasty it was a bit over cooked because the skin was rubbery. despite that though the hot dog was still juicy on the inside. the chicken wings were massive in size and came freshly cooked. I asked for the SS korean sauce on the side and it complemented the well seasoned crispy chicken wings well. the kimchi was okay and  the other side which was not listed on the menu but was sweet with vinegar complemented the wings well. I would have given 5 starts but for $11 I was disappointed that it was only 3 wings with pretty basic sides. for that price range I would have expected a little bit more for my money. overall I'd come back for the bulgogi dog.,VHpFuEmsEWg3EMnlaaoK0w,0,0,4,K2tJd-Y1NdYigYqzPzdiRQ

Since we were the first customers of the day, we were able to chat for a while with the owner and learn all about the food fusion they created as well as get killer recommendations.

We decided on the bulgogi dog, a Chilli cheese dog, and carne asada fries. OH MH GOD. SOOOOOOOO good!!

Just wow.

When I went to Buldogis Cafe, I went to order a philly dog. They told me that they couldn't make this for me but this is what I always get at Buldogis in Summerlin. I ended up getting the carne asada dog and it was decent. But for some reason, it just wasn't as good as their other location.

1661955,2014-09-28,0,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,"I found this cafe because of the food truck at First Friday.  I'm not even sure where to start here other than I'm in love with the sweet and spicy Korean chicken wings.  I brought a friend here one time, and my mom another time, their reactions were different and I think the make or break it really depends on your mentality going in.  This place is a culinary playground, there are no rules here. I am a fan of this method. There are fusion hot dogs, a hangover soup reminiscent of a chicken yukgaejang, my favorite wings, you can get gluten free chicken and waffles here and they serve breakfast all day long! 

The bibimbap my mom ordered was very ""Japanese style"" in her words, meaning kind of bland and ""missing"" things.  She requested some sesame oil and I think gochujang paste to dress it up.  Again, this isn't a traditional anything. I'm sure someone looking for something easy on the stomach and healthy would really go for this. Other items on the menu are full of flavors that go well together.  Where else are you going to find Korean wings, rice, and collard greens, AND sweet tea?! I'm gonna try the waffles next time if I don't default order what I've been getting.

Something else to add,  the nature of food trucks are fast, it sounds like their Summerlin location is quick (haven't been there), but you need to set some time aside if you're eating here.  It's not super fast, but Shaun (I'm so sorry if you see this and the correct spelling of your name Sean) is awesome and friendly and we've chatted about what's in the area while waiting since I'm new to Vegas. It's a little confusing walking in, but check out a menu and walk up to the counter when you're ready to order.  It's a very relaxed casual dining environment.",hDzgJUST9jdBrtnUK5085w,1,1,4,Gi3Sc_2mbE6jRzInp452Aw

1962824,2014-09-13,1,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,"Enjoyed their fusion dogs at the Sahara location, stopped into try some other dishes at this location. Didn't realize the menu expanded to add some southern dishes: wish they'd named the new location to reflect that. The wings are a star here, and for good reason. They're good!

Meaty, full size wings, in three or four different sauces: the soy caramel is the best though, and the sweetness is almost reminiscent of maple syrup. In a good way! The southern kick is that these can be served with grits and greens! Or order just one of the two as a side. Mac and cheese is also available here, and it's better than some southern places in town I've ordered it.

Location is new and super-clean, almost feels like it hasn't quite been broken in yet. Service is friendly, food is cooked to order (to ""put some love it in!"" as they say), so there can be a bit of a wait ordering the southern options compared to the 'dogs, but either are worth getting.

I keep meaning to try the hangover soup- it looks and sounds amazing, but I'm never hung over. And also, I keep getting seduced by those wings! Location is a bit odd and doesn't seem to get much traffic. Menu also has some breakfast options but they don't actually open until 11am, which is a bit odd to me.",bLbSNkLggFnqwNNzzq-Ijw,2,2,3,DQYQOSrpNGv8H1ZhKsZi7w

2084442,2014-11-08,1,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,"I've had this place bookmarked forever, so yesterday on my lunch break I decided to check it out. The inside is small, but homey. You can grab a table and look at the menu, and when you're ready to order you have to go up to the cashier and order there. The cashier was a nice girl named Mikayla. She was working alone and although there were only a few tables, she stayed busy! I looked at the menu for a few before I decided on the angry dog and the euro fries. I paid, just about $14, and sat down and waited. 

The food took about 15 minutes, which wasn't bad at all considering everything is cooked to order. My food came out steaming, a good sign! The angry dog came piled high with spicy bulgogi, jalapeños, slaw and spicy mayo. I had to eat it with a fork and knife it was that big. The flavors were wonderful. It wasnt too spicy at all, even with all the chopped jalapeños. That was a damn good hot dog. The fries however, were just ok for me. They came with pork belly, cheese and garlic mayo on the top. I liked the pork belly and the mayo, but probably could have done without the cheese. The actual fries themselves were seasoned and wayyyyy too salty, so that ruined the dish for me. I ended up eating everything off the top and left almost half of the fries. 

All in all I enjoyed everything and I will definitely be back because I want to try the chicken wings and the breakfast.",JYcCYNWs8Ul6ewG5kCYW4Q,2,1,3,s6RpAEzT2B3Nr0T8lckPGg
2388748,2014-09-18,7,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,"Lets see I've been to Buldogis Cafe 3 times in the last 9 days and twice in the last 3 days. Am I a fan!? Haha am I a fan. Hell yeah I'm a huge fan. 

Angry Dog is my #1 favorite item here. It's a good hotdog and bun on its own with some Spicy Pork Bulgogi, Asian Slaw, Diced Jalapeno, and Fiery Mayo piled on top. Ok so if I'm ever gonna rave about any item I've Yelped about this is it. I would eat this every day if I could and I'd probably wouldnt get sick of it. When you do Buldogis, either at the original location, cafe, or truck, you do it right and order the Angry Dog. It's filling, it's spicy, it's delicious, and it's reasonably priced. 

Banh Mi Dog is my #2 favorite item. It's the same hotdog and bun but with Pork Belly, Banh Mi Slaw, Herb Blend, and Sriracha Mayo piled on top. It's less spicy than the Angry Dog but delicious also. I've had it twice at this location.

The menu really has expanded. They offer their usual dogs and fries and added Southern comfort food with a Buldogis twist which I haven't tried yet. Fried chicken wings with various sauces, chicken and waffles/pancake, cheesy gritts. And they've also added some rice bowls and soups.

This location seems like it could fit a large number of people and has a nice interior. Customer service is fast and friendly. Its a little closer to the strip than its original location, being in the Chinatown area. Definitely will be back.",vWP8-aQX0rYJszqkWVL7Ew,12,9,4,H5vIkWT38lGV4q0ghrdJbA

2662728,2014-08-06,6,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,"Update: We're baaaak! And this time around we left much more satisfied, though, the flavors offered here are still lacking the asian-fusion-pizazz that our adventurous palates crave (you know: explosive and exciting flavors, umami!) The service here is always top notch and beyond excellent. That is a definite reason to return again and again. 

Here's what we ordered:

Hawaiian Hotdog ($6.95) - Pork Belly, Chunky Pineapple Salsa, G-Onions, Honey Dijon Mustard, and...hell, let's add caramelized onions to that bad boy for good measure (for an additional cost of 75 cents.) - The dog was good, but leaned closer to the boring side. I felt like it's missing something. The pork belly was very plain and no real strong flavor of Korean or asian marinade comes through. Also, maybe the sauce that they use needs work, honey Dijon just doesn't cut it for us. It's really boring. Overall, It's too simple, no wow factor, and no asian flair. Flavor rating: 3/5

Angry Kimchi (sweet Potato) ($7.95)
Spicy Pork Bulgogi, Kimchi, 5 Cheese Blend, Fried Egg, Green Onions, Diced Jalapeño all on top of crinkle cut sweet potato fries. - Very large portion and very filling. This dish had a flavorful Korean flair with the kimchi. The kimchi's acidity added surprising pops of necessary flavor and excitement to the dish. However, each bite I took without the kimchi, fell flat. The pork bulgogi was on the dry end. The cheese was lost in everything else, so I didn't even notice it was there. Still a tasty creation and we would probably dabble in this dish again - but ask them to add extra, extra, extra kimchi! Flavor rating: 4/5

Iced sweet tea - This drink is stupid addicting! Delicious deep black tea flavor, perfectly sweetened and icy cold. It's the perfect refreshment for our hot summers in Vegas. Plus, free refills!!!! I probably had about 6 cups of this deliciousness. So damn good!! Flavor rating: 5/5

Add: 
Ranch (75 cents) - Not the best ranch I've ever had. Not too creamy or special. Almost tasted like the hidden valley ranch, bottled version. Flavor rating: 2/5

Scalded Dog Hot Sauce (75 cents) - Not too spicy (we're spice lovers.) Plus, it's very oily. But the chilies added a necessary excitement to the hotdog and the angry kimchi fries. It really helps wake up the asian flavors on these dishes. I wouldn't eat here without it! Flavor rating: 4/5",u_wqt9RshdZsoj8ikLqoEQ,6,5,3,wDqHgVNUFYc-NYGJwK6Hpg

3758584,2014-06-19,7,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,"I'm a sucker for any crazy fusion type Hot Dogs or Burgers, so a visit Buldogi's Cafe was a no-brainer for me.  I came in pretty hungry for an afternoon snack, so I ordered two of their Specialty Dogs.  But that's kind of where I made a mistake since I really underestimated these Hot Dogs.  They were massive!!

Beef Bulgogi Dog --  http://bit.ly/1tMKhAm
Bulgogi, Asian Slaw, Grilled Onions, Seasame Seeds, Bulgogi Mayo
Basically just take your normal hot dog and top it with fat layer of BBQ Beef Bulgogi and you've got a protein packed beast!

Gangnam Dog --  http://bit.ly/1tMKfIR
Roasted Pork Belly, Cucumber, Nori, Seasame Seeds
This one is really crazy because not do you have a good sized hot dog, but now it comes topped with a huge hunk of pork belly!

Even though I'm a big eater, I actually had a hard time finishing these two.  Basically one of these alone was a meal in itself.  So having myself eat two of them was a pushing it a little bit.  Despite the struggle though, I really enjoyed them!  The flavors were incredible.  Picking a favorite between the two isn't easy, but I'd say edge goes to the Beef Bulgogi Dog.  Their Bulgogi is really good and I wouldn't mind trying it with their Bibim Bowl or Special Carne Asada Fries.

Now that I've had a chance to try their awesome Hot Dogs, I will definitely be back to try their other specialty items like their Wings, Chili Fries, and Breakfast items.  I'll be looking forward to my next visit!!",F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw,12,14,4,XgXU8ukQuEUrSz8TiYGiMw
4108218,2014-03-25,0,CBAnjb88MojpentaNPQWVA,"Never been to the original place. Too far. I like this one though! It's at the Mediterranean Market plaza on Spring Mountain. Watch for the Red Rock street sign if you're approaching from the Strip.

So anyway, I walked in at maybe 10:45 and didn't see any other customers. The front-of-the-house guy (sounds better than server, right?) invited me to the register to read a menu there and to tell me all about the place, after figuring out that it was my first time. I kinda zoned out, but doesn't everybody know by now that it's pretty much Korean fusion hot dogs plus some sort of new breakfast items to differentiate it? The guy actually confessed that they hadn't held their grand opening event yet and were still working out some kinks in the menu, but I'm sure they'll be fine if they stick to their bread and butter, so to speak.

I settled on the bulgogi hot dog ($6.95). It's a nice footlong sausage topped with beef, bulgogi mayo, green onions, grilled onions, and sesame seeds on a fairly nondescript but satisfactory bun. There aren't a ton of layers of flavor, but the flavors that are there really shone for me. Loved the texture and thickness of the beef for sure, and the mayo works very well. The depth that is possibly missing includes sweetness, spiciness (although I deliberately avoided testing my palate for this go-around), and maybe egginess. +$1.50 for a fried egg next time maybe? By the way, the portion size is very lunch-appropriate.

Now that I can get the fusion goodness without driving all the way out to who knows where, I think I'll definitely return. You should visit Buldogis Cafe as well.",_VMGbmIeK71rQGwOBWt_Kg,4,4,5,m7wIJhxuy9N6Cg_QreQqtg

Angry Dog - This had a pretty nice kick to it. I personally wouldn't order this for myself, however my boyfriend loved it.

Had been bookmarked but never in the mood to try Buldogis. I should have known this would be a letdown when it was dead when we entered. 

We came in with a open mind while seeing mostly the dogs being shown in photos I wondered about the bowls and the cashier was helpful in explaining the menu and some of their popular items. We ultimately decided on the bulgogi dog and the Hawaiian dog and an order of seasoned fries as we weren't sure if loaded fries would be too much food.

Our fries and dogs came out shortly after and I thought to myself, hmmmm that was offly quick. I'll tell you why. Everything was cold except the fries. The bulgogi on the bulgogi dog was cold and lacking flavor. The Hawaiian dog had some sad ""pork belly"" on top which seemed more like sad bacon. Not pork belly. The pineapple which was canned sucked and added nothing to this ""Hawaiian dog"" I know hawaii and there was nothing Hawaiian about it. The best part of the meal was the garlic mayo that we dipped our fries in. Besides having cold boring dogs the fries were fresh and piping hot. Who could serve cold fries. That would give it all away. Worst part was that my future husband and I were sick for two days after. Yikes! Definitely not someplace I would try again. I would give 1 & a half stars because their citrus water was good but I can't do that. So one sad little star for you Buldogis.",r0j4IpUbcdC1-HfoMYae4w,3,1,1,q-aAXZCfkRXwwRycEnuiag

From a small storefront and food trucks peddling Korean inspired hotdogs to a proper restaurant serving up breakfast, lunch, and dinner one could best describe Boyzie Milner's new Buldogi's Café an expansion on concept; all the familiar faces accounted for and joined by a few new friends in a homey little space on Spring Mountain Road.  Originally opened as early as 7am but since trimming its hours to an eleven o'clock start it was just after 1:15 on a Saturday afternoon when my family and I entered the lightly decorated space and without another patron present as Biggie Hypnotize'd us a bit too loudly from overhead the menu was perused - a quintet of items both time-tested and trendy ordered and paid for at the counter even though full table service was provided by the lone waitress/server/busser/hostess from beginning to end.  Beginning first with three Buldogi classics, two all-beef hotdogs and one order of fries, it should go without saying that both the franks and the house-made toppings were excellent and although fries proved a bit limp the combination of garlic and pork proved surprisingly light, the later gracing the briny Gang-nam for a smoky sapor that I only wish would have been present in the watery ham atop the underwhelming, bready, and overcooked Monte Cristo that arrived alongside an equally doughy waffle thankfully rescued by reference standard Korean Fried Chicken, crispy and lacquered with briny soy-caramel - by far the best bite of the afternoon and the best Korean Fried Chicken I've found in town.  Obviously a work in progress and still looking to find its footing amongst the staunch competition of Spring Mountain suffice it to say that sticking to the classics is a safe bet at Buldogi café while wandering to more Americanized novelties is a risk; one Milner and team might better approach by being as creative as they are with the dogs - the pork belly and a quick trip to the deep fryer could do wonders for that sandwich.",U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,4,3,3,BkT5F0Y_oAGnjysw929FXQ

Before stepping inside, an Oprah Magazine featured hot dog is posted on the door (West Coast Dog; ordered it!). Once inside I was impressed. I expected a hole-in-the-wall mom & pop type shop with stools, a soda fountain, and a fast food type vibe.  But no, the decor was a pleasant surprise with a relaxing Pandora station playing in the background ideal for casual dining. 

I had the West Coast and the Bulgogi - both of which met my taste expectations. Damn, that Bulgogi beef was delish! Like I said at the top, I came in for a better hot dog and got much more.

Only suggestion would be to use different bun types. Overall, they were great dogs and I know I'll be back for the wings and fries.",HixtBO7z5OW5bo_6qo6D_g,1,0,5,9uLk1dYngm6yz9f6j-q1aA

The bulgogi dog was as good as usual,  just like the sister restaurant at Fort apache.  The chicken wings were something new.  It was absolutely delicious. It was cooked perfectly!  Light crisp coating and the chicken was nice and juicy.  The spicy korean sauce was also yummy. I like ordering the wings with the sauce on the side. The spicy korean and the soy caramel is perfect together.  Along with the good food is good music and awesome customer service. The citrus water is also one of my favorites. I could drink it all day. I will always come back here for the wings.  Too yummy!",ZsjuEgOdvx9l5GKZdtwYIw,3,4,5,4x0i44c-FCdr-K3hei5YMQ
