1537785,2017-08-06,8,YfpcrQbCMDE89aAlqg1SJQ,"Great place for an inexpensive quick bite. Located at Caesars Palace forum food court. Different $ options such as Smashburger, Difari Pizza, Phillips Seafood Express, Earl of Sandwich, Tiger Wok & Ramen, La Gloria Mexican, & Romaine Empire (create your own salad). 

Great for people staying at the hotel because its inexpensive (compared to Vegas prices) & open until 11pm. Most of the restaurants in Caesars are upscale so this is an affordable alternative. 

I had the Holiday Turkey: wheat hoagie w/ turkey, dressing, & cranberry sauce. Also had broccoli cheddar soup. Tasty.",q1tg4-cLJWcy3HTEn9NlGQ,22,17,3,AKpBxaOpAZ3hN6Q5ilaaVg

While studying the menus of the walk up counters, I see nothing that would make me want a meal here.",7dnh9OrD8LekBwvachGH5Q,2,1,3,hv-4BdRkeLGTK6w9Zg3AhA

We went to a very popular restaurant hoping to have some yummy breakfast, however the line is very long so we decided to go to somewhere else, and ended up we are at the food court because everywhere is busy.  Thank you Caesar to have such a food court in this very very busy area!",Iqs3sn0QdgW8xpVuRQaz2Q,0,0,4,u-zyeNEmrXih582VLa5zMg

The food court had a diverse selection (sandwiches, mexican, seafood, pizza/burger and ramen) and is one of the best I had been to.  Price is on the higher side and lots of clean tables for seating.",htE8uyw7nru5Cie0OLu10A,0,0,4,nq8PwBcXX8JRe02GZZTp2g
5962722,2016-09-08,3,YfpcrQbCMDE89aAlqg1SJQ,"Diverse selection of fast food places here.  Had never tried any of them before our stay with the exception of Starbucks.  DiFara Pizza, Earl of Sandwich,  Smash Burger,  Phillips Seafood,  Tiger Wok & Ramen, and La Gloria are the other headliners at the Forum Food Court at Caesars Palace.

During our stay at Caesars, we ate from Smash Burger and Earl of Sandwich.  Neither impressed us.  Food was good enough, but price tags of our meals made it not worth it.  Based on those two places, I would say the prices at Forum Food Court is higher than normal.

On a positive note, there is plenty of available seating.  The staff does a fine job of keeping the dining area neat and welcoming.",whINg-cC-FiAv_ATDGMDTg,6,4,3,Lsw0valdCY2VKlDqEcI17A
